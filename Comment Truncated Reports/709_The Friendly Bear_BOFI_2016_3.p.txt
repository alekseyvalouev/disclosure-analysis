30 For 30: Signs Of Internal Audit Shake-Up Ahead Of Crucial 10-K
Filing

Summary


BOFI's troubles date back to March 2015, when two internal auditors abruptly left the
company under questionable circumstances; these departures ultimately culminated
in a whistleblower lawsuit.


The New York Times exposed these departures in August 2015; investors who
exited their BOFI positions following the exposure of these departures saved
themselves from a 50%+ sell-off.


We found new evidence of another major shake-up in the internal audit department,
including what appears to be the departure of the Chief Audit Executive after only
~1yr of service.


Our findings confirm our view that the company is falling apart; the timing is rather
ominous given that BOFI is in the process of completing its FY16 10-K.


The Probes Reporter also recently suggested that BOFI is involved in an ongoing
SEC investigation, which may help explain why audit/compliance turnover has
suddenly picked up in recent months.


Imagine this hypothetical situation for a second. You are a publicly traded and heavily
regulated bank. A March 2015 shakeup in your internal audit division (including the
resignation of your head of internal audit) and a subsequent October 2015 whistleblower
lawsuit are followed by a massive collapse in the value of your company's shares. Law
firms open up investigations into your company's business practices and their research
points to a toxic work environment fraught with turnover and loose internal controls. You
launch a process to combat the negative PR. In an effort to calm the market's fears, you
try to strengthen your internal control function. You bulk up your internal audit team,
including hiring a veteran internal auditor with over 30 years of experience. You then
publicly tout this new Chief Audit Executive's background in both conference calls
as well as in litigation in which you refer to him as an "expert witness" on matters

pertaining to internal audit and controls. You also start highlighting the strength of your
internal compliance and controls on conference calls, in an effort to assuage the market's
concerns.


June 2016 rolls around. You know this will be an all-important period in your company's
history. It is your fiscal year-end. But not just any run-of-the-mill fiscal year-end. A series of
serious allegations have been made against your company and the market will be closely
scrutinizing your 10-K filing and any disclosures pertaining to your relationships with
regulators. In fact, one of your biggest cheerleaders at Craig Hallum points to the potential
future filing of a clean 10-K as a positive catalyst for your heavily shorted stock.


This whole scandal, the whole reason your stock has been under intense scrutiny for the
past year, all started as a result of the mysterious turnover in your audit organization.
Given this tenuous backdrop, what is the one thing that you would not want happening
right before the filing of your 10-K?


How about what appears to be the mysterious and sudden departure of your Chief
Audit Executive in June 2016, right in front of the filing of your 10-K? As well as the
departure of numerous other internal audit/compliance executives in the past few
months?


BOFI's CEO proudly boasted about this Chief Audit Executive's qualifications in a
September 2015 call, in which he stated that the individual in question has "30
years of experience." Following a tweak to his Linkedin profile, the title of "Chief
Audit Executive" is now claimed by a BOFI employee who does not even appear to
be 30 years of age.


In other words, did BofI (BOFI) just pull off a…

Chief Audit Executive Profile LinkedIn Profile Side-by-Side:

Source: Chief Audit Executive through June 2016, Interim Chief Audit profile


The profile on the left, which ties to the individual that was highlighted in BOFI conference
calls from last year, as well as in BOFI litigation from last year, suggests that the Chief
Audit Executive left his role in June 2016. He lists no new position in his LinkedIn profile.


Our suspicion is further bolstered by the profile on the right hand side of the image above
which points to another employee at BOFI now holding the title of Interim Chief Audit
Executive. Readers can come to their own conclusions as to what may have happened
that could have caused the Chief Audit Executive to leave in just over one year's time
right ahead of the company finalizing its 10-K for the FY ended June 2016, but we
want to take a moment to make sure that BOFI does not try to spin a tale of the executive
in question being underqualified for the job he was tasked with (i.e. what they did to Mr.
Ball following his resignation in March 2015).


In a September 2015 conference call, BOFI's CEO made the following commentary
regarding the Chief Audit Executive in question:

Finally, BOFI itself cited this individual's merits as an expert in one of its court motions as
part of the whistleblower litigation.


Tomlinson is providing testimony within the scope of his employment. Even if
characterized as "expert testimony," Tomlinson is the First Vice President, Chief
Audit Executive at BofI and possesses the necessary knowledge, skill, experience,
training and education to be qualified as an expert on internal audit and compliance
in the banking sector pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702.

Finally, we note that the Chief Audit Executive in question happens to have joined in May
2015, at a time when he may very well have not been fully apprised of the problems at
BOFI. The whistleblower lawsuit did not break until October 2015, meaning the individual
in question may not have realized what he was stepping into when he first took a job with
the company.

The circumstances surrounding the Chief Audit Executive's potential departure are
clearly uncertain and we will leave it to BOFI management to comment on the
circumstances surrounding any changes to titles and roles within the internal audit
division. However, we also note that the Chief Audit Executive does not appear to
be the only person from the Internal Audit/Compliance department at BOFI who has
left the since the whistleblower lawsuit broke.


The last time there was a mass exodus in Internal Audit at BOFI (March 2015),
management did not mention the turnover to the public until it was forced to do so after a
New York Times article in August 2015. Following the article, BOFI played down the
turnover and claimed that it was simply "upgrading" staff. These claims managed to
somewhat calm investor fears. However, since that time, allegations of wrongdoing have
picked up materially, including, but not limited to allegations of related party dealings
involving the Chairman of the company's Audit Committee.


Therefore, longs are now facing a major dilemma. If our analysis of Linkedin
profiles is in fact accurate, which appears to be based on the tweak of both the
Chief Audit Executive profile as well as the introduction of an "Interim Chief Audit
Executive" title… then one glaring question remains for BOFI shareholders.


Were the employees that left the company in June 2016 uncomfortable with BOFI's
business practices and worried about being there for the close of fiscal year 2016?
If so, do these departures signal trouble ahead for the company's financial filings?


We note that the Probes Reporter has recently highlighted BOFI in a tweet suggesting that
the company may be the subject of an SEC investigation. An article discussing this tweet
can be found here. This tweet is perhaps just one of the many reasons for the turnover we
have identified at BOFI.

We also note that the turnover appears to be far more widespread than just the Chief
Audit Executive's.

2016:

We strongly encourage longs to diligence these troubling changes. As a reminder, the last
time there was a major shakeup in BOFI's audit division, the stock nose-dived:

The stakes are far higher this time. Relative to August 2015, the circumstances
surrounding BOFI presently are far more troubling. Allegations have exponentially grown,
and the company continues to try its best to silence its critics and deflect blame.


When a company is dealing with the major accusations that BOFI currently faces, a strong
and stable internal audit and compliance team is critically important to keep the ship on
the right course. This is also something that bank examiners will look into as they probe
BOFI's operations. Management turnover in key audit roles is one of the key issues that
bank regulators probe as part of their CAMEL ratings.


We therefore believe that if our suspicions in this article are in fact accurate, BOFI and its
shareholders that continue to trust management are on a collision course. Instead of
acknowledging issues and building a stronger and more compliant business, we believe
BOFI has gone out of its way to attack its critics and ignore the harsh realities about its
business.


While we are sure management will attribute turnover to its "tough love" culture
and its focus on minimizing efficiency ratios through low bonus retention
payments, we think that these arguments are in fact just excuses for a company
that does not care about investing in a culture of compliance.


Readers who follow The Friendly Bear will recall that in response to our last article, BOFI's
CEO made the following statement in the April earnings call:

Before I turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results, I'll provide some
brief commentary on the recently filed amended complaint and the recent
anonymous short-seller hit piece that appeared coordinated with the legal filing
and the timing of the recent options expiration.


We vehemently disagree with his comical and factually inaccurate characterization of our
last article. But, given that the next options expiration date is this Friday, we do have an
idea for how the CEO can respond to this article.
