Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of
One Alleged Customer
Jan. 2, 2012 5:56 AM ET26 comments
by: The GeoTeam


The Raystream (OTC:RAYS) story has it all - a too good to be true product, excessive
company sponsored paid promotional campaigns and ties to promoters of other
companies that have been pumped before they were dumped. The stock has gone from
$1.00 to $2.51 at its high since completing its “corporate restructuring” on October 4, 2011
and has already been exposed by two well-known research sites: The Street Sweeper
(Dec. 1) and PumpsandDumps.com (Dec. 5). We also believe that TimothySykes.com
views the RAYS story in negative light.


RAYS 3 Month Chart


We believe that RAYS is worth no more than what it would claim as a shell company
or at most about $0.004 to $0.01. ($200k to $500k divided by 50M outstanding shares).
Even when applying RAYS's claimed shareholder equity (which virtually consists solely of
goodwill) as shown its October 2011 10Q, a price target of just $0.19 can be derived.


Some of the red flags which you may already be aware of and others that have certainly
flown under the radar:


Raystream’s Technology is not a Secret

The company’s claims of a proprietary high definition video compression technology,
related to AVC/H.264 video codecs, are flat out misleading. In fact, it is and has always
been available as free and open-source software on other sites. Furthermore, RAYS
claims “No other company specializes in HD compression technology.” To verify
Raystream's claims, we decided to do a simple web search. As expected, we found
several companies that specialize in HD video compression technology.


Excessive Promotion


Raystream has spent millions of dollars on a self-promotion campaign just to disseminate
details of its story. Over a dozen sites have joined the pump train to fuel what we believe
is a sensationalistic campaign designed to dupe investors who are none-the-wiser about
exactly how ubiquitous the technology really is. In fact, Go Daddy suspended the
Smauthority.com domain, a pumper for RAYS.


The Usual Suspects


The people involved with Raystream include a cast of characters that have had a long and
lurid history with rogue development stage companies that eventually failed. The same
people are continually tied to one another with each new venture. (Evidence to be sent
to SEC Task Force.)


Dilution Imminent


Investors are likely to get slammed with massive dilution due to Raystream’s need for
capital. RAYS admits it will have to raise funds within the next 3 to 12 months,
depending on which SEC filings are referenced, just to sustain operations.


Loss of Customers


Exactly who are Raystream’s customers? We contacted one of three alleged RAYS
customers only to find out that it no longer has a relationship with RAYS? Does this
sound like someone who was excited about a technology that would revolutionize the way
things are done?


RAYS has no problem name-dropping when it comes to large players like Netflix
(NASDAQ:NFLX) and YouTube possibly lining up to use their product, but they fail to
recognize that these and other notable names are already AVC/H.264 licensees, as you
will learn.

Investors who have placed long bets on Raystream (RAYS) should know that the SEC is
stepping up its efforts to get in front of pump and dump schemes taking place on U.S.
shores…


Dec. 20, 2011 
SEC Charges California Company, Co-CEOs, and Attorney in Series of Fraudulent
Schemes Pumping Company Stock


[...] Mitchell J. Stein was controlling most of the company’s business activities, hiring
promoters to tout Heart Tronics stock on the Internet, and reaping nearly $8
million from secret trades that he orchestrated unbeknownst to investors. [...]


Dec. 16, 2011 
SEC Charges Daniel “Rudy” Ruettiger and 12 Others in Scheme to Pump Stock in Sports
Drink Company


Some issues referenced in this case include:


False and misleading statements in press releases, SEC filings, and promotional
materials
A product claimed to be "something special" and to outperform the other
competitors
Selling unregistered shares to investors
Panamanian companies that sold shares during the scheme
A person who has inspired a motion picture (Daniel Ruettiger)


In addition to the fact that RAYS has not disclosed that is has already lost one of its three
alleged customers, we could not help notice the parallels that each one of the points
above has with the RAYS case.


False and Misleading Statements


Again, RAYS clearly stated in its SEC filings that “No other company specializes in HD
compression technology.” We found this to be false.


Special Product


RAYS is portraying itself to be a pioneer in video compression when it is in fact relying on
already existing technology.


Unregistered Shares / Convertible Loan



http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-271.htm

http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-268.htm
5/23/2018 Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of One Alleged Customer - Raystream Inc. (OTCMKTS:RAYS) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 4/35


On September 19, 2011 after only two months of possession of its loan and with
essentially no trading market for RAYS shares, Unlimited Trade (largest and newest
shareholder) opted to convert its loan into 5 million (unregistered) shares of common stock
at $0.40 (equal to $2 million or the amount of their original loan), well below the going
market price of RAYS at the time.


Famous Character


There was a movie made about Tan Siekmann, an individual tied to Unlimited Trade,
Raystream’s largest shareholder. Siekmann’s past is checkered with failed businesses,
one of which eerily shows characteristics of a pump and dump scheme of its own.


Panamanian Company Ties


Information on Panama-based Unlimited Trade brings to light questionable share
transactions seemingly structured to line the pockets of various parties.


While other truth seekers have already touched upon the RAYS story, we have gone a
step further to point out information that investors MUST read to learn about the web of
deceit constructed by RAYS and certain parties. Because we know that RAYS will
continue to assault the public with information on its role in “revolutionizing” video
compression technology, we intend to go step for step with the company so they cannot
escape the legal consequences of their actions.


What now?


So now it seems that the jig is up for RAYS. Of no surprise, one of the company’s only
three named “customers” (not clear whether or not they are paying) has already severed
ties with them, as discussed later. It appears that the company’s large campaign to inform
investors of a “proprietary” and “revolutionary” technology, claimed to have the ability to
compress video like never seen before, has finally backfired on them. Investigations into
the morality and intentions of their dealings, present and past, has uncovered disturbing
truths and historical events shady enough to make even the most risk-tolerant investors
run for the hills.


In a revealing commentary, The Street Sweeper released a column that discussed
questionable business practices, delving into RAYS’ botched and weak attempt to fool
what they obviously thought were naïve investors, presenting to them a product put
together from free and open-source software and calling it their own.
PumpsandDumps.com counted twelve stock promoting sites that were engaged in
touting RAYS, but something tells us that this number is conservative.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 5/35


The Street Sweeper’s article also covered a brief look into the intertwined cast of
characters charged with molding the RAYS fraud into what it is today and the cast’s
evident conflicts of interest in doing so. We decided to go a step further and uncovered
eye-opening instances of recurring relationships tied to failed ventures and brazen
pumps.


The fact that GeoInvesting was concurrently looking into RAYS speaks volumes to the
extent of the “company’s” pump tactics. In fact, on October 21, 2011 we stated on one of
our premium blog pages (Open Short Positions) that we were already short RAYS.


What follows is our assessment on RAYS, an effort to supplement the research of prior
authors with additional information.


Going Public Details


The history of RAYS is quite brief.


November 4, 2010


A “real estate development company”, Interdom (stock symbol prior to RAYS: ITRD), with
no revenues went public through an S-1 filing. Interdom Corp was incorporated by Igor
Rumiantsev in Nevada on December 8, 2009 with an authorized share count of
75,000,000. Interdom never progresses with its strategy but still has an asset as a public
vehicle.


June 14, 2011


A change in the control of Interdom occurred when Igor Rumiantsev sold all of his
3,500,000 common shares (83.8% of the Company’s outstanding and issued common
stock) for $200,000 in a private share purchase transaction to Unlimited Trade Inc.


The Raystream Connection is Born


On the same day (and SEC filing) Igor Rumiantsev resigned and Interdom appointed
Roman Rumpf as its new President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer, Treasurer, CFO,
Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and as Director.


The 8K filing offers the following biographical information about Roman Rumpf:

Currently, Mr. Rump is the general manager of Raystream GmbH, a private
technology company, a position he has held since March 2011. From April 2010 to
February 2011, Mr. Rump worked as a technical consultant at Elogic GmbH, a
private electronic FX Trading company. From March 2008 to March 2010, Mr. Rumpf
worked as Head of Development for Burg Lichtenfels GmbH & Co. KG, a private
IT-Security company. From June 2006 to February 2008 Mr. Rumpf was Project and
Product Manager at Qnective Inc. a private Social Networking company.


Note: GmbH is the German equivalent of LLC.


We'll examine this information later. For now, just remember the bold items in the excerpt
above and note that this is the first time (June 14, 2011) that the name “Raystream” was
referenced.


On July 12, 2011


The company appointed Brian Petersen to executive positions.


On July 18, 2011


As its new controlling shareholder, Unlimited Trade lent the company $2 million via a
convertible loan, due in July 2013, (we will revisit this item). (Related party loan) (see July
21 8k)


On August 22, 2011


Interdom completed a 37 for 1 forward split and changes its name to Raystream as it
prepares for the inevitable acquisition of Mr. Rumpf’s affiliated company, Raystream
GmbH.


On September 19, 2011


Raystream Inc. acquired Raystream GmbH in a ZERO cash transaction using 20 million
shares as consideration.


Also on September 19, 2011 after only two months of possession of its loan and with
essentially no trading market for RAYS shares, Unlimited Trade (largest and newest
shareholder) opted to convert its loan into 5 million (unregistered) shares of common stock
at $0.40 (equal to $2 million or the amount of their original loan), well below the current
going market price of RAYS.


Let the Pumping Begin

5/23/2018 Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of One Alleged Customer - Raystream Inc. (OTCMKTS:RAYS) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 7/35


On October 4, 2011 RAYS issued its first press release.


After trading a combined volume of 5 thousand shares in recent trading sessions prior to
this release, volume exploded to 5.2 million shares on October 10, 2011 and never looked
back.


Shortly thereafter, the company sponsored a $3.25 million promotion campaign.


This story smells of a classic shell game. Take control of a public shell and develop a
“sexy” business plan. Next, enter into a related party convertible loan where potential
shares will cover the cost of the “riskless” loan that you essentially control. Next, instead of
having to spend cash which the company does not have, the company purchases non-
patented “ground breaking technology” from (Raystream GmbH) using stock, where the
R&D capital has allegedly been spent. Finally, create enough trading volume to sell your
unregistered shares. At the stocks high the company’s convertible loan shares were
valued at $12.5 million. This easily covers the cost if the $3.25 million promotional
campaign. Better yet, the 20 million shares that were so graciously given to Raystream
GmbH were worth $50.2 million. Not a bad day for a company with essentially no
revenues.


What Happens Next?


Ultimately, we surmise that the stock will plummet:


as investors realize that RAYS may not be what it purports itself to be.
as investors realize that even if some legitimacy exists, the company will have to tap
the equity markets.
if the company just goes dark after selling its convertible shares and the promotional
capital dries up. 


As you will read later in the report and what has not yet been discussed by other authors,
RAYS admits it will have to raise funds within the next 3 to 12 months, depending
on which SEC filings are referenced, just to sustain operations. This deadline is
approaching fast and has likely accelerated now that it has a “revolutionary”, unpatented
product to market. At best, substantial dilution, an investor’s worst enemy, is around
corner and should continue well into the future. Investors who purchase RAYS shares now
could soon be blindsided with an equity offering and a sharp hit to the share price.


These are some of the Red Flags encompassing the RAYS story, often shared by other
P&D’s:

Sexy story,
Possible exaggeration of “proprietary’ product function or technology,
Insignificant customers relations
Promotional activities
Usual Suspects of fraudulent accomplices
Dilution


Claims of a “Disruptive Technology”


Rays is a small development stage software company founded on March 21, 2011 which
allegedly owns a “proprietary” ground breaking online video compression technology.
According to their website this “technology drastically decreases bandwidth costs by
reducing the file size of HD videos up to 90 percent, with an average of approximately 70
percent, and with no loss in clarity or quality -- so they can be streamed online without
buffering or stopping.”


According to a recent article by Streetsweeper.com: RAYS of Sunshine ... or Clouds of
Doom?


They appear to be selling open-source software – available at no charge – to
anyone who wishes to use it. That software, known as “x264,” can be downloaded
here for free” which is given away as shareware.


While we are by no means video technology compression experts, it was easy enough to
substantiate Street Sweeper’s claims that the x264 encoder (one of the many
implementations of the proprietary H.264 format) used to compress video is “free and
open-source software” (defined) licensed as GNU GPL. Just follow this link you can
clearly see that the technology can be characterized as such.


Even more startling is there is a list of companies that have already registered as
licensees to use AVC/H.264 – some of which are the same companies named in the
P&D material that claims they will be lining up to become RAYS customers! Among
them are Netflix and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). RAYS needs to offer more clarity on this
issue.


Too Good to be True?

Beware if the company claims to be an industry leader (do you really think a penny
stock can be a leader in anything except possibly scams?) or has made a
breakthrough discovery. A company with legitimate breakthrough technology is
unlikely to be promoting itself on the penny stock market and will most likely have
funding available to it within a variety of partnerships with major companies. These
same companies will not likely be interested in dealing with a penny stock company.
Also, question the likelihood of a fairly new company being the leader in anything
other than schemes.


Let’s see what RAYS declares to be…


From the company profile on Yahoo!Finance:


Raystream Inc. provides proprietary video compression technology to
businesses and consumers worldwide. Its technology reduces the file size of high
definition (HD) videos with no loss in clarity or quality. The company enables HD
video over Internet connections through its online video platform. Its automated
content management system enables users to manage uploading, editing,
conversion format, and queue management, as well as storage, analytics, and client
side utilities. The company offers commercial conversion for large-scale content
owners, content distribution networks, advertising groups, and telecommunications
companies; personal conversion for smaller video content developers, individuals,
and person users; and live-streaming for large and small businesses, news
organizations, sporting clubs, and individuals.


From the “About Raystream” in a recent press release:


Raystream Inc. is bringing its proprietary video compression technology to
businesses and consumers worldwide. This technology drastically decreases
bandwidth costs by reducing the file size of HD videos up to 90 percent, with an
average of approximately 70 percent, and with no loss in clarity or quality -- so
they can be streamed online without buffering or stopping. Raystream’s technology
puts high definition video in the reach of nearly every Internet user on the globe.


In their October 2011 10Q, RAYS makes what we thought looked like an absurd statement
coming from a company with no financial backing from industry giants or venture capital
firms

Raystream is the first company to offer HD compression technology…No
other company today specializes in HD compression technology.


Wow. It seems they have discovered one of the most disruptive video technologies
of the century, with the potential to revolutionize the entire web.


To verify RAYS's claims, we decided to perform our own simple web search. As expected,
just by conducting simple web searches, we found several companies that specialize in
HD video compression technology. You can do the same.


Interestingly enough, in a recent development on Reel SEO’s website, freelance writer
Christopher Rock published a glowing follow-up to his originally skeptical column about
Raystream’s technology. Well, we have only to read the second sentence of his first
paragraph to maintain a skeptical eye on the results that Mr. Rock publishes further down
in his column:


I sent them a 271MB video file and asked them to do that voodoo that they do to it
and send it back.


This is where we again say that Raystream’s secret sauce is no secret. Of course they
can show that an existing technology works, but what they fail to do is show, by
technical example, how they have added any value to x264. Anyone familiar with x264
can pretty much see this, as described in Lucian Gregory’s blog post, Raystream (RAYS):
Trying to Market Essentially Free Techology?, that came out after Reel Seo’s column. An
excerpt that we whole-heartedly agree with follows:


In any case, the measurements here appear to show that Raystream's technology
does not offer a compelling solution for video compression over the freely-available
x264 encoder. The test of this was easy to put together and shows that Raystream's
claim that "before Raystream," compressions such as the ones Raystream achieves
were not possible, is patently false. Virtually the same compression ratios are
achievable using a free product.


So why hasn’t Raystream protected its only asset with patents? On the company’s
website, the answers to this frequently asked question sheds light on this issue:

Q: Does Raystream have a patent or patent pending on its technology?


A: Raystream did not apply for a patent for its HD video compression technology due
to a number of factors, most specifically as a measure to protect its proprietary
nature and maintain it as a trade secret claim. Other factors include:


Applying for patent protection of our various technologies requires disclosure and
full description of how the technology works. If accepted, the patent details would
be published, opening our technology to possible replication by competitors without
patent infringement even if minor modifications were made.
Securing a patent for software takes a long time, is expensive, requires
government action and approval, and involves a significant amount of uncertainty.
Trade secret protection is quicker and less expensive, aligns with our strategy, and
is more certain.
Patent protection offers only civil (monetary) remedies. Trade secret protection
offers federal criminal remedies.
For these reasons, we have made the strategic decision to use trade secret
protection instead of patent protection.  


You can judge yourself, but in our opinion these considerations are simply unconvincing.
How do you explain the fact that practically all the other major proprietary codecs are
patented (Exhibit 8)?


Another important reason to patent video codec is that their underlying algorithms are
easy victims of "reverse engineering". The hackers Jerome Rota and Max Morice (Link 1,
Link 2) needed only a week to reverse engineer Microsoft’s MPEG-4 Version 3 video
codec!


On November 8, more evidence was provided supporting the argument that RAYS
technology may not be what they claim it to be. A simple test was published here,
reproducible by anyone with a minimal Linux OS expertise. The author was able to reach
the same rate of compression claimed by Raystream - even 3 MB less – with the freely
available tool mencoder and the H.264/AVC codec. By the way, one only needs to
download the RAYS showcase video to see that it was also compressed with this codec.
Opening the file “ray_480p.mp4” with a video player and looking for its properties will
show you that the RAYS proprietary codec is in reality a common H264 (Exhibit 2)

A few days after that test was published, RAYS modified the see-for-yourself-page,
removing the section on the left (“Watch original version - 686 MB”) and on the right
(“Watch standard compression 214 MB - 214 MB”). The only video that remained was that
one with the text “Watch Raystream version - 28 MB”. One of our investigators tried to
reconstruct the page’s previous appearance, shown in the Exhibit 3. At any rate, the old
code was not removed (just commented) and it's still visible in the page “source view”
(Exhibit 4).


By now, it should be obvious that this story is too good to be true. Investors need to
ask themselves a question that is often asked by ChinaHybrid skeptics such as Muddy
Waters and Citron. Why would a company with such a game changing technology choose
to go public via a transaction with a shell without assets? The answer - we believe it is
unlikely that the company has some game changing technology and in the slim
chance it does it will have to spend millions of dollars just cultivate it, diluting
shareholder value along the way.


We find it impossible to believe that the firm that claims to possess unique technology
could not raise substantial capital as a private firm, culminating in partnership
arrangements with reputable industry giants or in an impressive IPO debut when it could
maximize its return on its investment. They instead chose to come to the market with a
public shell company (where their reputation would surely be tarnished) that has limited
funds to enhance or market the alleged Raystream “product.” This is a very important
point to understand. That would have been like YouTube choosing to go public via an
RTO transaction as opposed to combining forces with Google. If you have revolutionary
technology the giants will find you, and you will want to partner with a firm that can
back you. You will not want to go public and then embark on massive dilution activities to
fund your business plan, nor will your shareholders prefer this scenario. RAYS already has
50 million outstanding shares and to date has barely raised any capital.

SIDEBAR – All too Familiar Story 


How the big boys with game changing technology do things 


To this point, we suggest investors read the story of DiVx Inc., a company in the same business


RAYS claims to be that after several initial rounds of investment and funding by some venture


capitalists went public with an IPO price of $16.  


The company started with an initial investment as they began their journey to NASDAQ, with an


initial investment of $5 Million in 2000, growing to $35 million in invested capital by 2005.


They solidified their position in the market place in 2006 by having their software downloaded with


over 180 million downloads and over 50 million DivX Certified devices shipped. Their partners


included Samsung, Sony, Toshiba and Philips, working in multiple devices such as DVD Players,


Blu-ray Players, Televisions, Game Consoles, Mobile Phones, Media, Streamers, Multimedia


Storage Devices, Portable Media Players and In-car Players.


They went public in September 2006 with annual revenues tracking at about $60 million. The


registration statement covered 9,100,000 shares of common stock at $16.00 per share, raising


proceeds for the Company, before expenses, of approximately $111 million. They closed at $18.70


per share, giving the San Diego-based company a market value of $625 million.


According to an excerpt from the DIVX 8-K filed Oct 30, 2006, third quarter consolidated revenues


were $15.4 million, an increase of 83 percent from the third quarter of 2005. Non-GAAP Net


income in the third quarter of 2006 was $3.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to net


income of $821,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. Revenue for the nine-


month period ended September 30, 2006 was $42.7 million or 90 percent more than the


comparable 2005 period. Non-GAAP net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006


was $9.15 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $373,000, or $0.01


per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.


They were acquired four years after the IPO in September of 2010 for $323 million by Sonic


(SNIC), developer of digital media software (its flagship brand is Roxio). The price amounted to


$9.25 a share. At the time DivX employed 371 workers worldwide.


Sonic in-turn was then purchased three months later in January 2011 by Rovi Corp. for $725


million.


So what did Raystream GmbH sell its ground breaking technology for? Well they certainly
did not require any cash or follow the route that a respected firm like Divx took.

5/23/2018 Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of One Alleged Customer - Raystream Inc. (OTCMKTS:RAYS) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 14/35


From the SEC Filing dated 09/23/2011:


On September 19, 2011, Raystream Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an agreement
whereby it acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Raystream
GmbH in exchange for the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the
Company. The acquisition of Raystream GmbH makes it a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company.


They paid Raystream GmbH with 20,000,000 common shares. How much was it in U.S.
Dollars? The answer to this question isn't so easy because at that time the stock was not
actively traded in the market. Anyways, considering that about a month before (August 22,
2011) Interdom Corp (ITRD) affected a 37:1 forward split and that all the shares issued in
the past had a value of $0.03/share, it's reasonable to estimate a value of $0.0008. That
means, that Roman Rumpf, the 29 year old founder of Raystream GmbH and inventor of
this breakthrough technology gave it away for $16,000 in stock, and no cash!


Where/Who are RAYS Customers?


If you had a revolutionary product wouldn’t major companies like Netflix, Youtube, Hulu
and the like be chomping at the bits to access your products? The RAYS promotional
campaign wastes no time tossing these names around as potential RAYS customers. So
who are RAYS customers? Well surprise, these big boys are not customers of RAYS.
What is interesting is that if you visit the site that hosts the free and open-source software
that RAYS applies to its product you will notice that all the big names have registered to
this site and are keenly aware of AVC/H.264. These include Google (who owns YouTube),
Netflix and YouTube. Apparently, this technology is not a secret.


So far, Raystream has only named three customers, one of which is here in America
called EdgeFactory OmniMedia. We called and spoke with a representative and
discovered they had already severed ties with Raystream and will no longer do
business with them.


The second is Laterna Magica located in Germany. We called and left several messages,
stating that we wanted to find out more about RAYS video compression technology and
how effectively it was working for them. We were clear in conveying that we were
considering RAYS as a potential investment and thought that speaking with a client like
Laterna, named by RAYS on their website, was a good start. We did not receive a call
back. Our last attempt was successful in getting in touch with the CEO, who would not
comment regarding their relationship with Raystream.

5/23/2018 Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of One Alleged Customer - Raystream Inc. (OTCMKTS:RAYS) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 15/35


Finally, RAYS just recently announced the Christian Broadcasting Network as a
“customer” who will be using the technology on a trial basis for 60 days. We take this to
mean free of charge. Are all of their “customers” on a trial basis? Is this why there is no
revenue stream?


Massive Pump Campaign: So Where is the Money Being Spent?


So far we have confirmed that RAYS largest shareholder, Ultimate Trade, has spent at
least a grand total of $3.25 million on a promotional campaign to disseminate the RAYS
story. RAYS management should be advised to put that money to better use by spending
capital to develop its market and customer relationships. We find this unbelievable. RAYS
is not even hiding the fact that it is essentially as we see it, pumping its own stock.
Per its 2011 second quarter 10Q the company has spent no capital on R&D and only
$6,774 to market its revolutionary product. We plan to send information on this and
more to the SEC Special Task Force.


This is not the first time Ultimate Trade has been involved in a stock promotional
campaign.


The RAYS-LEXG Connection


The original change of control filing mentioned earlier in our report says nothing else about
Unlimited Trade Inc, but we will learn though some subsequent filings (on September 23,
2011) that it is an offshore entity.


Before the September 23 filing, an iHub user posted the addresses associated with the
domain unlimited-trade.com:


Unlimited Trade Inc.


Frankfurt Office  
Bockenheimer Landstraße 17/19, 60325 Frankfurt/Main, Deutschland/Germany  
P: 0049 69 710 455

5/23/2018 Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of One Alleged Customer - Raystream Inc. (OTCMKTS:RAYS) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 16/35


We also learned that Unlimited Trade Inc. is a sort of German-Panamanian entity. To be
more precise, there is no entry about Unlimited Trade in the German Company Register,
and the address above is a virtual office – not the first one that we will reference in this
story.


Looking at the Panamanian Company Register, we have more luck in finding some
interesting information.


The company was created on October 5, 2010 and the following persons are its officers
(or more likely straw persons):


Marcos Antonio Gomez Sanchez (President)
Francela Ivonne Findlay Silva (Treasurer)
Orlando Zamet Reyes Saldaña (Secretary)


Thanks to a very useful site (http://ohuiginn.net/panama) we can do a search with these
names and quickly discover that there is another Panamanian company with two of the
same officers:


Gekko Industries Inc.


Manuel Mauricio Monge Acuña (President)
Orlando Zamet Reyes Saldaña (Treasurer)
Francela Ivonne Findlay Silva (Secretary)


The name of Gekko Industries came into the public eye in relation with one of the most
successful pump-and-dump promotions of the year: Lithium Exploration Group Inc.
(OTCPK:LEXG) (A story discovered by The Street Sweeper when LEXG traded at $4.02,
and now trades for less than $0.70).


But this is not the only link between RAYS and LEXG. In looking at the Html code of any
Raystream web page, there was a small piece of commented code that referred to
LEXG.

This appears to be clear the evidence that RAYS webmaster used the same Html
Template that was used for the LEXG site. It was removed on November 28, 2011 after
the connection became public on a forum but it's still visible in this video.


Strange coincidence, isn't it? But this isn't the last one. RAYS and LEXG are heavily
pumped by many paid stock promoting newsletters and on many message boards like
those one of Yahoo (YHOO) and iHub. Starting on October 12, 2011, RAYS was promoted
by more than 19 paid newsletters and in the first week of November was among “The
Most Promoted Penny Stocks This Week” according to stockpromoters.com. 


By far, the most well paid RAYS campaign was one orchestrated by The Stock Market
Authority (smauthority.com, now a dead link). In their Disclaimer they say that they have
indirectly “received and managed a total production budget of $3,250,000” to provide
public awareness for RAYS. According to the disclaimer, the campaign was financed by
Unlimited Trade. Recall that Ultimate trade is the controlling shareholder of RAYS. During
its short life, Smauthority promoted only one other stock, LEXG. The LEXG campaign was
also expensive, with a total production budget of $3,296,800 and was financed by Gekko
Industries. We believe that it's not beyond the realm of reason that whoever controls
Gekko Industries, Unlimited Trade, RAYS and LEXG are also tied to Smauthority.com.


On November 22, 2011, Go Daddy suspended the domain Smauthority.com for SPAM-
AND-ABUSE.


As if the newsletter promotion hasn’t been massive enough (More info on this - Link 1,
Link 2, Link 3), the company has just embarked on a prolific IR campaign. On October 6,
2011 they "announced it has retained Halliburton Investor Relations (“HIR”), a
Dallas-based, full-service investor relations firm". Since that alert until the end of
November 2011, they released 8 announcements on Business Wire with a lot of not-so-
detailed claims or announcements.


For example, in a recent release (“Compression of Full High Definition 3D Videos”) they
use the “sexy” term “cloud-based architecture”. This is exactly the same term used by a
substantial fraud we busted earlier this year, the Chinese RTO Subaye (OTC:SBAY).


In another recent press release, they were pleased “to announce our office in Paris,
France, opened on November 10, 2011” but as of now no Paris address is available on
the contact page of the RAYS website.

In further dissecting the contact page, we noticed that the office in Germany is the
medieval Cast of Lichtenfels (as we'll see later, this cast dishes out a lot of surprises!)
while the address in Orlando is a Da Vinci Virtual Office. Another Da Vinci Virtual Office
is the address reported on every SEC filing but omitted on the web site: 219 Redfield
Parkway #204, Reno, Nevada (Address of principal executive offices). Regarding the
office in Texas, it is only 1.8 miles from another company that we will encounter later (it
belongs to Raystream's CEO Brian Petersen): Petersen - Hines, LLC, located in 15305
Dallas Parkway, Suite 300, Addison, Texas... another Virtual Office. But this time from
Regus.


SIDEBAR - The Classic "Pump and Dump" Scheme


It's common to see messages posted on the Internet or sent by e-mail that urge readers to buy a


stock quickly or to sell before the price goes down. Often promoters of the stock will claim to have


"inside" information about an impending development or to use an "infallible" combination of


economic and stock market data to pick stocks. In reality, they may be company insiders or paid


promoters who stand to gain by selling their shares after the stock price is pumped up by the buying


frenzy they create. Once they sell their shares and stop hyping the stock, the price typically falls, and


investors lose their money.


On the following pages below are a few companies with the most recent pump and dump scheme.


Lithium Exploration Group went from 12 cents to almost $4 a share in just under a month and at


one point had a market cap of almost $200 million.

outstanding, giving it a market cap of around $100 million.


AMWI 2 Month Chart


Looking at both of these most recent examples will give you a feel to how pump and dumps work.


The SEC is investigating these type of companies but it’s usually too little too late for the investor.


Here are some recent actions by the SEC.


SEC Charges N.Y.-Based Penny Stock Promoter with Fraud


Washington, D.C., Jan. 14, 2011 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an


upstate New York-based penny stock promoter and his affiliated website with fraud for failing to


disclose that he was paid by certain issuers to promote their stock while simultaneously liquidating


millions of his own shares for profits of at least $2.95 million.


The SEC alleges that Christopher Wheeler of Victor, N.Y., received compensation at various times in


2007 and 2008 to promote several thinly-traded penny stocks on his website,


OTCStockExchange.com. Wheeler's website claimed to "have compiled a long list of successful


stock picks" and to afford investors the opportunity to "make a fortune."


SEC Freezes Funds in Trans-Atlantic "Pump and Dump" Scheme, August 15, 2008 —The Securities


and Exchange Commission announced today that it obtained an emergency court order freezing the


profits from an alleged $13 million international fraud involving a Seattle-area microcap company


and a Barcelona stock promoter. The Commission charged Bremerton, Wash.-based GHL


Technologies, Inc., and its CEO Gene Hew-Len with issuing a series of false press releases touting


the company's business dealings. The Commission also charged Francisco Abellan (also known as


"Frank Abel") of Barcelona, Spain with coordinating the scheme, sending glossy promotional mailers

to over 2 million U.S. recipients and unloading over $13 million in GHL stock on unsuspecting


investors. "The Street Stock Report," a full-color glossy mailer sent to millions of U.S. addresses


urging investors to purchase GHL stock quickly to see huge trading profits.


Around the same time, Hew-Len issued nine press releases over a nine-week period hyping the


company. Among other things, according to the SEC, the press releases made false claims about


contracts with large customers, fraudulently touting millions of dollars in potential revenues.


Following this concerted promotion campaign, GHL's stock price doubled and trading volume spiked


nearly 1500%. Abellan and his entities sold their GHL stock holdings for profits in excess of $13


million. The stock, which reached a high of nearly $9 per share at the height of the scheme, now


trades at under a penny.


SEC Charges Seven in Global Warming Pump-and-Dump Scheme


Washington, D.C., Feb. 18, 2011 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a


group of seven individuals who perpetrated a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of a


sham company that purported to provide products and services to fight global warming. (OTC:CTTD)


SEC Charges Company CEOs and Penny Stock Promoters in Kickback Schemes


Washington, D.C., June 30, 2011 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities


fraud charges against several CEOs, their companies, and two penny stock promoters alleging they


used kickbacks, a bribe and blast e-mails to manipulate trading in microcap stocks.


Persons and Places involved in RAYS- No Strangers to Pump and Dump Stories


German Leg


The Raystream's site is hosted in Germany, it was registered by Roman Rumpf, that
provided the Texas office address as its Registrant Address. The Admin and Tech
Addresses are the same: Ringstrasse 13, Berndorf, Hessen. This address doesn't not jive
with any address in SEC filings, but as we will learn later, it's the private address of
Roman Rumpf.


The address for the Raystream's German Branch is Burg Lichtenfels, 35104 Lichtenfels.
“Burg” is the German word for “Castle” and in fact the Caste of Lichtenfels is a real
medieval castle.


Castle of Lichtenfels and Tan Siekmann

5/23/2018 Raystream Remains Under Scrutiny, Even Fails To Disclose Loss Of One Alleged Customer - Raystream Inc. (OTCMKTS:RAYS) | Seeki…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 21/35


The Castle of Lichtenfels was built in 1189 and is located in the German State of Hesse,
whose largest city is Frankfurt am Main (remember that Unlimited Trade has/had a Virtual
Office in Frankfurt).


Since the late 1980s this Castle has belonged to the German entrepreneur Tan Siekmann
and his parents.


Tan Siekmann is well-known in Germany because his company, Biodata AG, also based
in the castle, was one the most famous bankrupt companies when Germany's Dot-Com
bubble exploded. After Biodata AG’s first insolvency in 2001(There is even a movie
about it), the CEO and major holder Tan Siekmann founded "Biodata Systems GmbH".
Three years later (2004) "Biodata Systems GmbH" was also declared insolvent. Tan
Siekmann, in this case, bought some of the insolvent assets and founded "Safe-Com
GmbH & Co. KG", and like the others was domiciled in the castle. Information on Safe-
Com is scarce, but its website, Safe-Com.com, is no longer active, although some
archived/crawled parts of the site are still available to view. It is also known that Roman
Rumpf had a key technical role in Safe-Com.


In another instance, as reported in a four year old article published by the German
business magazine "brandeins", the company Demuth & Dietl (a mobile telephony service
provider) accused Tan Siekmann of being responsible for its own bankruptcy. Even more
interesting, the same article states that in 2007 Safe-Com bought 65% of BodyTel
Scientific Inc. (OTC:BDYT). BodyTel was a development stage company in a "sexy"
sector (telemedical monitoring). After having touched $3 in 2008 it declined to 2 cents only
a few months later!

There is still more…


When Tan Siekmann was one the Major Holder at BodyTel, the company signed an
investment agreement with Michael Kang and Francis Villena , who acted as agents for
Bridge Capital LLC (June 11 , 2008)


In the Panama Companies Register there is a firm registered on June 6, 2008 called
Bridge Capital Inc. (yes, we know the first was a LLC and this one is an INC.). Who were
two of the three Bridge Capital Inc.'s managing directors? (Note that they all resigned):


Maria Lucrecia Martinez (President)
Marco Antonio Gomez (Treasurer)


These names are now quite familiar to us:


Maria Lucrecia Martinez is President at Foresight Media Inc.
Marco Antonio Gomez is President at Unlimited Trade Inc. , and RAYS’ largest
shareholder (the name there is longer: Marcos Antonio Gomez Sanchez)


To supplement the information we already have on Unlimited Trade Inc, Foresight
Media Inc. (FM) enters the mix within the P&D campaign…


The Stock Market Autority (SMA) disclaimer for RAYS states:


[...]Raystream, (OTC:RAYS), the company featured in this issue, appears as paid
advertising, paid by Unlimited Trade to provide public awareness for RAYS.[...]


[...]SMA and Foresight Media (FM) have used outside research and writers using
public information to create the advertisement coming from SMA about RAYS.[...]


[...]FM has received and managed a total production budget of $3,250,000[...] 


…confirming that Unlimited Trade paid itself in a certain manner to promote RAYS.


A medieval Castle, the same young entrepreneur, four collapsed businesses (one of
which looks to be a U.S. pump and dump story), and conflicts of interest...an impressive
record, making RAYS quite a good candidate for an SEC investigation.


Michael Kang and Francis Villena


Together, these individuals were behind BRIDGE CAPITAL.

But who is Francis Villena, aka Francisco Abellan Villena, aka Francisco Abellan, aka
Frank Abel? 
He lives in Barcellona, inherited an important printing company from his father, but above
all it's an “old friend of the SEC’s”, which on August 15, 2008 froze his assets, accusing
him having earned over $13 million in a Trans-Atlantic "Pump and Dump" Scheme
related to shares of GHL Technologies, Inc (Link 1 and Link 2)


Regarding Michael Kang, there was a Nevada corporation founded early this year called
eLogic North America FX. On its contact-page, eLogic GmbH makes reference to "eLogic
North America", which suggests that they’re the same company. The Nevada
Corporation’s president is Michael Kang, making him the fourth person in our crew of
usual suspects to be tied to this company.


Roman Rumpf


Roman Rumpf was born on July 29, 1983 in Twistetal-Berndorf, a very small town in the
German State of Hesse and he is currently domiciled in Ringstrasse 13, Berndorf,
Hessen, one of the addresses registered for the raystream.com domain.


He is Co-founder and CTO of Raystream Inc and he also had a key technical role in Safe-
Com as stated in his bio on Raystream's site.


The June 24, 2011 8K states:


From June 2006 to February 2008 Mr. Rumpf was Project and Product Manager at
Qnective Inc. a private Social Networking company.


There are some discrepancies between this statement and other information available on
the Qnective web site and in the SEC filings.


As the company itself declares in its home page, Qnective was founded in 2007 (April 2,
2007 is the first date where the company name appears – its former name was Sotech
Inc.). It is quite odd that it appears that Mr. Rumpf was Project and Product Manager at
Qnective 10 months before the company was even founded.


The second and most important discrepancy is that this time (“From June 2006 to
February 2008”), Qnective WASN'T private. Before going private in 2011, the company
was listed on the OTC BB under the symbol QNTV. On May 5, 2011 the price of the stock
was $1.00. The last price before going private on January 28, 2011 was $0.20. Tan
Siekmann was a Beneficial Owner (10% or more) and the CTO of Qnective Inc.

Let’s take a closer look at Raystrem GmbH, the German firm created on March 21, 2011,
its first CEO being Roman Rumpf (See Registrar for German Companies). Although
the company was formed on that day, it was only communicated to the German Company
Register on May 2, 2011. The sole owner of Raystream GmbH was the Panamanian
Unlimited Trade Inc (Exhibit 5). Here is the timeline of events leading up to the
acquisition of Raystream GmbH by Raystream Inc.


August 16, 2011


Roman Rumpf resigned as CEO and Thomas Friedli (Frankenberg, 1977-05-12) came
on board to substitute him.


June 14, 2011


The same Roman Rumpf became the new CEO and only officer of Interdom Corp when
Unlimited Trade Inc bought it.


June 16, 2011


Unlimited Trade Inc (Exhibit 6) sold its shares in Raystrem GmbH to the German holding
“TOM Beteiligungsgesellschaft GmbH” (“TOM”). On June 24, 2011, Thomas Friedli took
the place of Tan Siekmann as the CEO of this holding is (Lichtenfels, 1966-10-29).


Until June 7, 2001 Tan Siekmann was the only owner of TOM before selling a part of his
shares to Thomas Friedli and Roman Rumpf (note that TOM had also a role in the
Biodata saga).


July 12, 2011


Roman Rumpf resigned as CEO and become CTO. Brian Petersen was appointed as the
new CEO.


August 22, 2011


Interdom changed its name to Raystream Inc and did a 37:1 forward-split.


September 19, 2011


Raystream Inc. acquired 100% of Raystream GmbH.


The Panamanian Unlimited Trade Inc purchased the German Raystrem GmbH through
the American Raystream Inc. on September after having sold it in June of the same year.
Unlimited Trade was presented in front of the German Notary by Tan Siekmann (Exhibit

7). Here you will find more than one clue of non-disclosed related party transactions.


The list of the company owners for Raystream GmbH and TOM Beteiligungsgesellschaft
mbH is presented in the Exhibit 5 and 6.


Thomas Friedli


Referenced above for having been part of certain share transaction, Thomas Friedli is
known as the manager of the German branch of RAYS.


He is also Founding Partner and Chief Operations Officer of eLogic GmbH. The CEO of
eLogic (also located in the Castle of Lichtenfels) is Tan Siekmann.


U.S.A. Leg


The American staff of RAYS is practically the same as those who work for Petersen-Hines
LLC. When Brian Petersen was appointed as CEO at RAYS, the same SEC filing covering
this appointment stated that he “has grown Petersen - Hines, LLC to a $35 million dollar
company within six years”, even making it debt free. Is it feasible that they can devote
enough time and resources to this development-stage RAYS venture? We are in the
process of trying to determine if Petersen-Hines is aware of the past dealings of those
associated with RAYS.


Nadia Christian, Vice President of Marketing at RAYS


Ms. Christian should be the busiest person in the staff. Not only is she presumably
working simultaneously at Raystream Inc and Petersen-Hines LLC, but she runs also
businesses of her own as a Cognitive Fitness Therapist. See also, this link.


Dane Butzer, Business Development Manager


We only had to view the html code of Raystream’s site to find a special surprise, another
key staff member that was seemingly hidden from view:


Mr. Butzer has worked in intellectual property law with such renowned firms as
Fitzpatrick, Cella, Harper & Scinto, and The Swernofsky Law Group. He also
maintained a highly successful solo practice. Mr. Butzer has witnessed many start-
up ventures and ongoing businesses both fail and succeed over the course of his
career, resulting in a deep understanding of the fundamentals of applying technology
and business processes in the real world.

In performing a web search on his name, he seems to be a reputable U.S. patent
application attorney.


It's our opinion that the heads of the RAYS operation are based in Germany, but they
made sure to appoint a recognizable U.S. management team to possibly give a façade of
legitimacy to the company.


Clues of an Off-Shore Scam ("Regulation S”)


On April 30, 2011Interdom had 4,175,000 outstanding shares:


3,500,000 owned by Igor Rumiantsev and purchased for $.0010/share on April 14,
2010.
675,000 issued at $.03/share


On June 14, 2011, Igor Rumiantsev privately sold all his 3,500,000 shares to Panamanian
Unlimited Trade Inc for $200,000 ($.0571/share) making it the new major holder:


3,500,000 owned by Unlimited Trade and purchased for $.0571/share


On August 22, 2011 Interdom changed its name to Raystream and did a 37:1 forward
split. After the split Raystream now had 154,475,000 outstanding shares:


129,500,000 owned by Unlimited Trade and purchased for $.0015/share
24,975,000 purchased by someone for $.0008/share


On September 19, 2011 three important events happened:


Raystream Inc bought 100% of the German Firm Raystream GmbH for 20,000,000
shares
Unlimited Trade converted its $2,000,000 financing into 5,000,000 common shares at
$.40/share).
Unlimited Trade cancelled 129,500,000 shares and now owns 5,000,000 shares


All the transactions occurred on September 19 pertain to off-shore entities (based in
Germany and Panama) therefore these shares were exempt from registration (Regulation
S). That led to the following situation:


20,000,000 owned by Raystream GmbH (paid price unknown).
5,000,000 owned by Unlimited Trade and paid $0.40/share
24,975,000 owned by others and having an initial price of $0.0008/share
for a total of 49,975,000 outstanding shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/316946-raystream-remains-under-scrutiny-even-fails-to-disclose-loss-of-one-alleged-customer 27/35


Considered that to qualify for a Regulation S exemption, the shares may not be sold back
into the United States for one year the effective count of shares available for free trading is
currently only a little less than one half (of course they do not risk to loss the control of the
company).


But... did Unlimited Trade really cancel those 129,500,000 shares? Nobody knows since
they were not registered with the SEC.


Now the risk is that they will resell “Reg. S” or claimed-to-be-canceled stock to U.S.
investors, diluting the float, pocketing high profits for themselves and causing the price to
collapse.


Unlimited Trade already owned both Raystream Inc (NYSE:USA) and Raystream GmbH
(Germany), but all of those transactions occurred between the same these related party
entities. What exactly could be the rationale behind these moves?


Dilution is a Certainty


Let’s assume for one moment RAYS has a piece of legitimacy. Since Raystream is a
development stage company generating no revenues we need to assume that it will
have to raise substantial capital to implement its goals. RAYS agrees (from various filings):


“The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit
of $189,286 as of July 31, 2011 and further losses are anticipated in the development
of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. Although the Company obtained debt financing in July (See Note
4), the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company
generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary additional
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due.”
“We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating
requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the
sale of equity or debt securities.”
“We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a
combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities.”
“Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash
flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months.
We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have
financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity
and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates

additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i)
acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up
business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with
further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need
to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating
requirements.”
“We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain
and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will
obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form
of equity financing from the sale of our common stock.”


What does all this mean? These comments imply that RAYS only has enough cash to
sustain it operations for the next 3 to 12 months, depending on which SEC filings are
referenced, just to sustain operations.


TICK TOCK


Well, this deadline is approaching fast and has likely accelerated now that it has a
revolutionary, unpatented product to market. This means that substantial dilution, an
investor’s worst enemy, is around corner and should continue well into the future.
Investors who purchase RAYS shares now could be blindsided with equity offerings and a
sharp hit to the share price. Worst yet, if the company is unable to raise capital the story
could end badly in 3 months.


Valuation & Conclusion


Until RAYS clearly demonstrates that it can secure industry giants as customers or book
meaningful revenues we believe that RAYS is worth no more than what it would claim
as a shell company or at most about $0.004 to $0.01. ($200k to $500k divided by 50M
outstanding shares). Even when applying RAYS claimed shareholder equity (which
virtually consists solely of goodwill) as shown its October 2011 10Q, a price target of just
$0.19 can be derived.


Furthermore, even if RAYS has a semblance of legitimacy, dilution is a major risk further
limiting EPS performance. To put this into perspective, Divx raised a total of $146 million
(pre IPO and IPO) to develop their business. If RAYS needs to raise a similar amount of
capital, shareholders will be slammed with massive dilution. For a company with limited
revenues, equity offerings will likely have to be accomplished at a major discount to its
current market price. Even in the unlikely case that RAYS had a product that people could

sink their teeth into (in other words an honest company with a promising product), you
would still only end up with a company with a horrible equity market presence, not only
due to the manner in which it went public, but also by having gone public prematurely.


Although the company talks a big talk, Raystream cannot boast solid customers to initiate
to a meaningful revenue stream. In fact, we were unable to get much out a former
customer of Raystream, who consequently terminated its need for whatever technology
the company offered, effectively reducing the number of paying customers RAYS has
to just one, to the best of our knowledge and until proven otherwise. The mention of
large industry players such as YouTube and Google is a tactic promoters are using to
draw investors into a web of deception. Would respected companies like these seriously
want to deal with executives whose pasts are as shady as Raystream’s story?


Raystream is hardly letting the product speak for itself. The company instead chooses to
promote the stock through hype and related party funds and what amounts to a weak
attempt to demonstrate how much more superior their so called “proprietary” product is
when compared to others. If Raystream was a respectable company, it wouldn’t use pump
outfits and stock promoters to throw industry buzz words around and spread innuendo of
an eventual acquisition by an industry giant. The company would instead go much further
into actually proving the product.


One of the most compelling facets of the RAYS story that has convinced us that there is
no way to trust anything that comes out of the company’s camp is the cast of characters
involved, a crew that can be referred to as the Usual Suspects due to their involvement
with other failed ventures/promotions. If your head was not spinning by the time you
finished reading about the business relationships of RAYS personnel, then you need to
read it again. Let it sink in, and then decide if this is a genuinely honest business venture
hell bent on over-achieving in a market that already appears saturated with the same
technology RAYS claims to have developed.
