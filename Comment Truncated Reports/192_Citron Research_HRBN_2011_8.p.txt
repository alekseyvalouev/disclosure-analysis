THE LAST AND FINAL
WORD ON HARBIN
ELECTRIC


Citron believes it is time to offer its final comments on the long


drama leading up to Harbin Electric's purported going-private


transaction (NASDAQ:HRBN). 


If Harbin's private buyout falls apart at the last minute, consistent


with the many other “fraud calls” we have made, Citron will not be


taking a "victory lap".  Likewise, if this deal ultimately closes, we will


not issue a mea culpa or comments full of sour grapes, as we are


convinced that our research on the fraud committed at Harbin


Electric was always honest and thorough.  Not one analyst, US or


China-based journalist, stock commentator, or even the company


has been able to rebut any of the voluminous data points presented


by Citron documenting the many indicators of malfeasance Harbin's


operating results, including:


 


The sole audit on which the buyout is based, from a firm that


no longer exists, after being sanctioned by the SEC for


improper audits on other China stocks.  This is the single most


important document in the entire transaction.


An "independent director", the audit committee and "special


committee" chairperson, is also on record as a director of


Harbin's private equity funder Abax – a glaring conflict of


interest.

A multi-year track record of operations funded by a crazy-quilt


of one-pocket-to-another band-aid financings


Consistent track record of cashless profits


Crazy fake asset purchases consistent with the behavior of


other Chinese fraud stocks


One point on which longs and shorts agree is that the fulcrum of


this deal is a massive multi-year, low interest term loan commitment


from China Development Bank, upon which the deal depends for its


core funding.  Longs' position is : "It’s a done deal, so just deal with


it.", while skeptical shorts have pondered "Why would the bank


make such an un-economic, high-risk loan?"


Harbin Electric is no longer a stock; it has become a leading


indicator for a debate about business corruption in China.  Those


who are long the stock have committed their capital, not to


investing in the company, but to go long on the corruption that


exists in China. The premise of this deal closing is that corruption


has no boundaries in China and has moved beyond rogue CEO's all


the way to the policy making bank of China. 


China has become a country whose economic stability has been


plagued by fraud.  These are not allegations; these are facts that


have played out over the past year.  Beyond the collapse of many


Chinese RTO's, we have also seen two multi-billion dollar market


cap companies delisted from US and Canadian exchanges for fraud


(Sino-Forest and Longtop).  This has also been the year of the fake


Apple Stores in China.  And now we are left to ponder the


implications of a massive regulatory black hole created by the


complete breakdown of a working relationship between the PCAOB


and Chinese accountants, as well as between the SEC and its


Chinese counterparts.

China bubble is about to burst.  In the midst of this uncertainty, the


riddle of Harbin has not helped anyone.  Can someone really get a


loan in China for $400 million with no business basis, knowing the


only outcome is default, just because of political connections?  The


market has handicapped "Yes", but Citron still thinks the real


answer might be "No".


Citron looks forward to moving beyond Harbin.  We have been


publishing this column for 10 years and have no plans on slowing


down.  We are proud of the work we have done, and stand behind


the research, analysis, and writing on Harbin Electric.  Readers are


encouraged to reference  the "Citron Knows China" tab on this site


for a summary of research on China companies.


As Citron waits like every other investor to learn the eventual fate of


Harbin, we only hope for sake of the country of China that fraud


and lack of transparency is just one of the temporary growing pains


in their economy and society; and in the future, US investors will


not have to rely on hope and faith as the principal factors in their


investment decisions.


PS. For a little lighthearted humor, this news story just came out


about the level of fraud in Harbin Province.  We couldn’t make this


up if we wanted to.
