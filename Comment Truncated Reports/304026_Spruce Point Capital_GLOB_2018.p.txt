Executive Summary

Spruce Point Is Short Globant (NYSE: GLOB)
For The Following Reasons:


Organic Revenue Growth Is Slowing: Globant has “optically” achieved the fastest top line revenue growth within its peer group posting 
revenue growth of 27.1%, 27.2%, and 28.1% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.  This top line growth has led investors to award Globant the 
highest multiple in its peer group.  Globant's management team consistently touts that its organic exceeds 20%. Management goes out of its 
way to avoid quantifying the attribution from M&A in discussing its revenue growth. In Globant’s year over year "results of operations" 
discussion filed in its Form 20Fs, there is not a single mention or attribution to M&A when it discusses the drivers of revenue growth year over 
year.  Our work uncovers a slowing organic growth profile versus the robust top line growth story that Globant portrays.  In 2017, we estimate 
that almost half (>47%) of Globant's growth in 2017 was from acquisitions. 


Globant SA (NYSE / LUX: GLOB) is a poorly organized roll-up of digital IT outsourcing companies. GLOB receives the highest 
valuation in its sector by convincing investors it achieves consistent 20% p.a. organic sales growth. However, our forensic analysis 


disproves management’s bold claims, and suggests that its growth is in fact rapidly decelerating below target. Once investors
realize GLOB uses aggressive accounting and financial presentation methods to paper over a cash degenerative business, while 


insiders quietly unload millions of dollars in stock, we expect shares to be materially re-rated lower by 40% to 50%.


Cash Flow And Adjusted Earnings Metrics Reported By Globant Are Potentially Deceptive:  We warn investors not to rely on Adjusted EBITDA as 
a cash flow proxy.  Globant’s bulls will point to a growing upward trajectory in Adjusted EPS and EBITDA.  We caution investors to be skeptical, 
since Globant’s Adjusted EBITDA of $64.6m in 2016 translated into a paltry $7.4m of free cash flow. Globant does not even provide investors 
regular cash flow statement reporting.  Globant does not appear to generate recurring cash flow from outsourcing technology services.  Rather, it 
generates cash from trading investment securities. Globant regularly trades securities and its stellar track record has generated a cumulative 
$68m of cash flow in the period from 2011 to 2016.  In regards to earnings, we have provided an adjusted income statement based on Globant’s 
core business of outsourcing IT and software solutions.  We arrive at EPS results that are on average 36% lower since 2013 than the Adjusted EPS 
that Globant reports. Recent 2017 IFRS results declined 15% YoY, and didn’t grow at all based on our normalized Adjusted EPS calculations. 


Evidence of Accounting Games:  Globant lacks consistency with adjustments and add-backs, and even tries to convince investors to ignore 
depreciation and amortization expense when presenting its adjusted results.  We have found instances where the same category of expenses are 
not treated uniformly in its reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income; Globant makes the adjustment when it is favorable to add back the one-time 
item and ignores the adjustment when it is unfavorable. There is also a pattern where Globant continuously revises IFRS or adjusted numbers.   
The 2016 financials have been published three times (4Q16 press release, FY16 20F, and the 4Q17 press release) and we identify changes in each 
subsequent release. We also found potential evidence of manipulation in quarterly earnings to meet consensus expectations.  Globant’s 4Q16 
Adjusted EPS was originally reported within its guidance and matched consensus expectations of $0.31   When 4Q17 was reported on 2/15/18, 
we found that its 4Q16 Adjusted EPS was subsequently revised to $0.27 which would have represented a $0.04 miss versus consensus.

Spruce Point Has Established A Short Position 
In Globant (NYSE: GLOB), Sees 40% - 50% 
Downside For The Following Reasons


Corporate Strategy Initiatives Are Not Showing Signs of Progress:  In 2016, Globant introduced a new company wide model called 50-Squared.  
The main goal of 50-squared is to focus Globant's team on the top 50 highest potential accounts that have the capacity to grow exponentially 
over time.  We took a close look at its top 5 clients.  Four of its top clients (excluding its top client, Disney) only grew by an average of 2% in 
2017.  We don’t see evidence that this strategy is gaining acceptance with its most important clients.   


Insiders Selling Is Staggering:  Insiders have sold (or transferred) over 70% (+$80m) of shares since Globant’s IPO in July of 2014.  We think 
investors may be unaware of the magnitude of selling by Globant’s founders and other insiders.  Globant’s status as a foreign private issuer 
allows it an exemption from reporting the customary insider disclosure via Form 4s to the SEC.  Globant chooses to file paper forms with the SEC 
via Form 144s.  Ironically, since the Luxembourg dual listing in August of 2016, Globant now files insider selling transactions electronically with 
the Luxembourg stock exchange.   We find it peculiar that Globant now files insider selling transactions electronically with the Luxembourg 
exchange and does not follow that same protocol with the SEC.  Further, the four founders all set up both revocable and irrevocable trusts.   
All four founders in aggregate transferred over 3.0m shares (~$40m and ~10.4% of total share count) to irrevocable trusts at some point between 
August 2014 and January 2015.  We believe that this transfer was done quietly with the potential motivation to allow for further insider selling


Corporate Governance Should Be Questioned:  Globant has not maintained an independent board since its IPO. Given Globant's status as a 
foreign private issuer, it is able to adhere to different corporate governance standards.   Globant has chosen home country status of Luxembourg, 
and must adhere to its corporate laws.  There is no legal requirement under Luxembourg law to have a majority of independent directors.   
Although, Globant states that its board is "currently" independent.  We analyzed the board independence over the last three years since its IPO.  
The Board was not independent at the time of its IPO.   Furthermore, in both 2016 and 2017, the majority "independent" status was achieved by 
a single board member, Francisco Alvarez-Demalde (founder of Riverwood).  Mr. Demalde at the time of its IPO represented Globant’s second 
largest shareholder (Riverwood).   Although, this former major shareholder may not need a "cooling off" period to be considered independent, 
we question why Globant would choose to achieve an independent Board in this manner.  Also, its latest addition to the board, Linda 
Rotternburg (Endeavor), was also a pre and post IPO shareholder.


Analysts See 10% Upside, A Terrible Risk/Reward Given Our 40% - 50% Downside Estimate: GLOB is trading at peak valuation on the belief that 
it can maintain 20%+ organic revenue growth. Management continues to embrace the “organic” growth story while not sharing with investors 
the underlying contributors to growth that would reveal its slowing profile. GLOB does not lead its peer group in any key metrics that warrant its 
industry leading valuation (e.g. organic growth, EBITDA margin, FCF conversion, employee retention, or client diversification). Yet, the Street is 
valuing GLOB at 3.4x, 19.7x and 31.0x 2018E sales, EBITDA, P/E, respectively. Furthermore, analysts ignore obvious accounting and financial 
presentation issues that would give any prudent investor pause for concern. Once investors realize that GLOB’s organic growth rate is slowing, we 
believe investors will recalibrate GLOB’s valuation in-line with industry peers. Our simple regression analysis linking valuation to organic growth 
rate among IT outsourcing peers suggests 40% to 50% downside (approximately $24.50 to $29.50 per share)

Sir Martin Sorrell


Globant’s Largest Shareholder Is WPP, A Company Under Pressure And Its CEO Are Under Investigation:  


“WPP Is Looking at CEO Martin Sorrell’s Possible Misuse of Assets and Allegations of Improper Behavior​ Questions come as advertising giant 
is facing cost-cutting pressures from clients and stepped-up competition from Google, Facebook”  Source: Wall St. Journal, 4/3/18


• WPP’s financial results are under pressure 
• It’s company structure has been described as “complicated”
• Its CEO is being investigated for misuse of company assets and allegations of improper behavior
• Spruce Point believes that WPP’s large ownership stake in Globant could be a major overhang on the share price. Mr Sorrell is a 


member of Globant’s Board of Advisors, and WPP represents $6m+ of related-party revenue for Globant

Potentially Misleading Organic Growth Profile


Globant consistently tells investors that most of its growth is organic (vs. from M&A).  
We have done the work to prove otherwise.


M&A represented approximately 50% of its total growth in 2017.  More alarming: organic growth is decelerating

Spruce Point Adjusted EPS Estimates


Globant does not include D&A in its Gross Margins or Adjusted SG&A.   Further, in its adjusted income statement, Globant does
not exclude one-time gains found within the finance and income line items on its income statement.  Lastly, unlike its peers, 


Globant does not tax effect adjustments in its Adjusted Income Statement Reconciliation


Sources:  Spruce Point Estimates and Company Filings (IPO Prospectus, 4Q14 Press Release, 4Q15 Press Release, 4Q16 Press Release, 4Q17 Press Release)
(1) Spruce Point estimates eliminates finance and other income, tax effects all other one-time adjustments (Globant does not), and assumes a normalized 35% historical corporate tax rate. 
As the operations of the Argentine subsidiaries are the most significant source of net taxable income for Globant, the 35% corporate income tax rate of Argentina is used.

Globant’s Claims vs. Reality


On Globant’s last conference call, it stated that two acquisitions contributed in the range of 4% to 4.5% of 2017 revenue 
growth.  Our analysis assumes that at  approximately half of Globant’s growth was attributable to five acquisitions made 


in 2016 and 2017


Sources:  Bloomberg and Seeking Alpha Conference Call Transcripts and Company Filings (FY16 20F, 1H17 6K)
(1)  Incremental revenues from M&A are deduced from the footnote section disclosure -- "impact of acquisitions on the results of the company"


Revenue contribution for the first year are disclosed in the same footnote section -- "impact of acquisitions on the results of the company"
Revenue contribution for the second year, which is likely conservative, is the difference between the implied annual revenues less what was implied in the first partial year period of the acquisition


(2)  Implied revenues for Ratio and PointSource are half year periods ending June 30, 2017 and then annualized assuming a full 12 month calendar year


4Q17 Conference Call – February 15, 2018:
Alejandro Scannapieco (CFO): “We don't really disclose the organic/inorganic [Growth] . . . if you do a quick math on the two
acquisitions that we made in 2017, PointSource and Ratio, roughly 110 people. If you take the average rate for a typical rate for 
the U.S. [employee] and you [assume] 80% - 82% utilization. . . you're going to get to 400 - 450 basis points of contribution for 
the full-year 2017. So still, organic growth was very strong in the year. We ended up the year growing 28% and probably 400 bps 
to 450 bps of that came from the acquisitions of PointSource and Ratio.”

3Q17 Conference Call – November 16, 2017:
Alejandro Scannapieco (CFO): “[The] growth. . . it's pretty much organic. . . we have some tailwind from the acquisitions. But 
keep in mind that PointSource and Ratio were very small tuck-in acquisitions. . . So, pretty much the growth is organic. . . So, the

years, called 50 Squared. The main goal of this new approach is to focus our team in the top 50 high potential accounts that 
have the capacity to grow exponentially over time. To do so, we have appointed our most senior people from Sales, Technology 
and Operations to lead these teams and take our company to the next level. This account focus has become the most important

Historical Adjusted Income Statement – Add 
Backs Are Not Consistent 


Adjustments to Net Income each year are not treated uniformly  


Sources:  Company Filings (4Q15 Press Release, 4Q17 Press Release)


A reversal of impairment for tax credits aided net income in 2014 and 2015, yet was not adjusted for in the 
adjusted net income reconciliation.  In 2017, the exact opposite occurred, and Globant recorded a loss of $1.6M 
related to the recognition of the allowance for impairment of tax credits.  In this instance, Globant treated this 
item as an adjustment and added it back to adjusted net income.

Foreign Private Issuer Exemptions And 
Departures From NYSE Corporate Governance


Globant’s status as a foreign private issuer exposes shareholder to an unfair playing field.   
Globant does not have to report insider selling via Form 4s electronically with the SEC


Foreign Private Issuers are:
Globant’s Significant Departures from NYSE listing 


standards:


•No Legal requirement under Luxembourg Law to have a 
majority of independent directors


•Luxembourg law recommends the Board of Directors have 
an appropriate number of independent directors


Majority of 
Independent 


Directors


•No Legal requirement under Luxembourg Law (nor articles 
of incorporation) to require the Board, on a case by case 
basis, to express an opinion with regard to independence 
or lack of independence of each individual investor


Standards for 
evaluating director 


independence


•No Legal requirement under Luxembourg Law (nor articles 
of incorporation) to require shareholder approval for 
equity compensation plans.


•Further, Globant does not require shareholder approval 
for the compensation criteria for executive management


Shareholder 
voting on equity 
compensation 


plans


•No Legal requirement under Luxembourg Law to have 
regularly scheduled executive sessions with non-
management executives without management present


Non Management 
director meetings


•CEO is not required to provide the NYSE with the annual 
compliance certification in regards to NYSE corporate 
governance standards


CEO Certification

Exempt from Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure)


Exempt from filing insider trading reports 
(Forms 3, 4, and 5)


Able to adhere to different Corporate Governance 
standards than U.S companies listed on the NYSE


Globant’s status as foreign private issuer means they are exempt 
from filing the traditional insider trading forms (i.e. Form 4s.)  
Globant does file its transactions via form 144s, but these forms 
are paper forms and are therefore not filed electronically with the 
SEC.   This is important because many investors are likely unaware 
of the magnitude of the insider selling.   


We find Globant’s insider reporting methods to be deceiving as we 
are unsure why Globant would now file insider sales electronically 
with the Luxembourg exchange and not with the SEC.

We Estimate GLOB’s Founders Have Sold (Or 
Transferred Ownership) of >$80M In Shares Since IPO


We estimate GLOB founders sold (or transferred) over $80m of stock in the IPO, each of the subsequent secondary 
offerings, and multiple open market sales.  Additionally, we believe that the irrevocable trusts may not have to file its 


sales in the open market, making it difficult to track their current ownership

Insider Selling (And Maneuvering)


The four founders have sold (or transferred ownership to irrevocable trusts) over 75% of their holdings since the IPO


Each of the four separate trusts created by the founders 
were selling shareholders in the secondary in March and 


July 2015 -- that is how we are able to follow the partial trail 
of the shares transferred and sold by the trust.  


Shares beneficially owned by the four founders have been reduced from 6.3M (21.5%) to 1.6M (4.5%).   


Approximately 3.0M shares were transferred by the 
four founders into four separate irrevocable trusts prior 


to January 31, 2015.  Each of these four irrevocable 
trusts were formed under New Zealand Laws and their 
shares were subsequently transferred to four separate 


Uruguayan wholly owned companies. 


We don’t believe these 
trusts have to report 


sales and can sell in the 
open market without 


disclosing in the U.S. or 
Luxembourg.

Disclosure Of Trusts


The four founders all set up both revocable and irrevocable trusts.   For all eight trusts that were set up, Marcelo 
Cabrera Errandonea is the sole director and holds dispositive and voting power (+12% of all Globant’s shares 


outstanding) for all shares held by all eight trusts


Source: Company Filings (March 2015 Secondary Prospectus, July 2015 Prospectus, FY16 20F)


Marcelo Cabrera Errandonea is the sole director, holding both dispositive and voting for all eight of the trusts that were set up by the four founders.  The 
footnote disclosure in the prospectuses filed for Globant’s two secondary offerings (March 2015 and July 2015) disclose that Mr. Errandonea controlled the vote 
for 13% and 12.3% of Globant’s shares as of January 31, 2015 and May 31, 2015, respectively.  Outside of the prospectus disclosure where these trusts were 
selling shareholders, Globant does not disclose the voting power held by Mr. Errandonea.  We believe a person or party having this much voting control as well 
as changes in the voting control should be disclosed to investors.

Easy To Debunk The Bull Case


Bullish Promoters Spruce Point View


Globant is a high growth company and will 
continue to grow revenues +20% organically


Globant has surpassed either revenue or 
earnings expectations every quarter since it has 
been public


Acquisitions are used to strategically expand and 
strengthen verticals


Committed management team and investor 
base with meaningful stake in the company


Company wide initiatives such as “50-Squared” 
are increasing wallet share for their largest 
customers


Globant’s organic revenue growth has slowed to 
the mid-teens and we believe organic growth is 
trending towards high single digits


We found instances where adjustments have been 
made to enhance EPS, as well as unexplained 
retrospective revisions to prior quarters that would 
have resulted in earnings misses


Acquisitions are used to mask the organic 
growth deceleration


The four founders have sold or relinquished 
control of over 70% of their holdings since the 
IPO in mid-2014


Four of Globant’s top 5 customers grew their 
revenues in 2017 by 2%


Premium valuation justified by differentiated 
services, and superior financial performance


Undifferentiated IT outsource provider with higher 
business risk than peers (greater employee 
turnover, more client concentration), and 
inconsistent free cash flow generation

A Look At GLOB’s Two Closest Peers


Globant has the highest valuation amongst its two closest peers, EPAM and Luxoft. We do not believe this is justified 
given higher business risk, and lower financial transparency

(1) Annualized turnover of workforce
(2) Percentage of revenues

One of the few public companies 
Spruce Point has ever seen that 
avoids providing quarterly cash 


flow statements


Globant appears to spend more freely 
on providing nice office fixtures for 


employees, than on computer 
equipment or software (3)

Organic Growth And Valuation


We ran a regression analysis to aid us in our valuation framework.  
We included peers that had organic growth rates of at least 9%


Source: Bloomberg, Company Filings and Spruce Point Estimates
Tickers included in the analysis above include CTSH, WNS, TTEC, EXLS, VRTU, SYKE, EPAM, LXFT
LXFT and WNS revenue growth rates have been adjusted to reflect our estimates of organic growth rate based on its recent acquisitions


2018E EV / EBITDA vs. Sales Growth 2018E EV / Sales vs. Sales Growth


Our linear regression on similar companies suggests a valuation 
based on EBITDA of approximately 11.0x which equates to a 


price target of approximately $28.00   


Our linear regression on similar companies suggests a 
valuation based on Sales of 1.8x which equates to a price 


target of approximately $26.50

Globant Acquisitions


Globant consistently tells investors that most of it growth is Organic (vs. from M&A).  
We have done the work to prove otherwise!


M&A represented at least 47% of its total growth in 2017.  More alarming is that organic growth is decelerating


Sources: Company Filings (FY14 20F, FY15 20F, FY 16 20F, 1H17 6K)
(1)  Implied annual revenues are deduced from the footnote section disclosure -- "impact of acquisitions on the results of the company”
(2)  Revenue contribution for the first year are disclosed in the same footnote section -- "impact of acquisitions on the results of the company"


Revenue contribution for the second year, which is likely conservative, is the difference between the implied annual revenues less what was reported in the first partial year period of 
the acquisition


(3)  Implied revenues for Ratio and PointSource are half year periods ending June 30, 2017 and then annualized assuming a full 12 month calendar year
