Summary


We are short AeroVironment (NASDAQ: AVAV) because the CEO,
Wahid Nawabi, has orchestrated a cover-up of illegal activity and
dangerous conduct, according to allegations in an undisclosed new
whistleblower suit. The suit was �led by AVAV’s former chief of top-
secret government programs, Mark Anderson, who had worked at
the company for a decade.  Some of the allegations in the suit
include:


AVAV staffers allegedly transported live bombs on a
commercial Delta Airlines �ight in 2015.  According to
Anderson’s suit, this risked “the lives of approximately 230
passengers and innumerable civilians”.


Nawabi pressured employees to mislead the government
about ongoing security violations and mishandling of top-
secret information, according to the suit.  Anderson says
company lawyers “made an effort to threaten him” and that
he was �red in retaliation for his whistleblowing activities.


Nawabi purged those who “would not ‘play ball’ by
participating in a cover-up” and forced out most of AVAV’s
compliance leadership, according to the suit. Our research
shows that at least 56 senior employees and executives have
left the company since the inception of the alleged cover-up.


Nawabi touted AVAV’s purportedly robust safety systems and
processes to investors the exact same month that Anderson
alleges the company initiated an undisclosed internal
investigation into security failures. While investors have been
kept in the dark, the Chairman has dumped over $17 million
worth of stock.

AVAV shares currently trade at over 3.3x EV/Sales and 21x
EV/EBITDA, a lofty valuation that anticipates signi�cant future sales
growth. But it is our opinion that Anderson’s whistleblower
allegations introduce material risks to the company’s growth story
that simply are not discounted at current prices. We therefore see
substantial downside potential.


AeroVironment is a defense contractor that sells small weaponized
drones to the military.  The stock has been promoted to growth
investors as a thematic “pure play” on the secular trend towards
unmanned aircraft. But history demonstrates that whistleblowers are
often the �rst to alert investors and regulators to fraud or graft
lurking beneath the surface of growth companies (Insys
Pharmaceuticals and MiMedx are two of the latest examples).  A
whistleblower, Mark Anderson, has now emerged at AeroVironment
to allege that CEO Wahid Nawabi has led a cover up of extensive
illegal activity in a newly �led lawsuit (available here).  Anderson
worked at AeroVironment for a decade and managed security for all
the company’s top-secret government programs. He says he was
threatened and then �red last year in retaliation for joining his
superior in reporting the company’s misconduct to the government.


The whistleblower suit depicts a corporation with a corrupt culture
that regularly violated the law.  For example, AeroVironment staffers
allegedly transported at least one drone with live bombs on a
commercial Delta Airlines �ight from Utah to California in April 2015,
“risking the lives of approximately 230 passengers and innumerable
civilians”.

Source: Case No. BC 702904 Superior Court of California, County of
Los Angeles.  Note: You should assume that the company denies all
allegations discussed in the complaint.


According to the whistleblower, AVAV was able to conceal this
incident from the government until he told the United States Defense
Security Services and the FBI roughly seven months afterwards in a
November 2015 meeting. When authorities subsequently demanded
more information, the whistleblower states that the company
submitted a false report that “massaged key facts” and attempted to
downplay the incident. Anderson says that he and his superior jointly
engaged in whistleblowing to report additional illegal activity to the
government and “refused to participate in or turn a blind eye to
ongoing violations of state and federal law relating to security and
information handling”.  These other alleged violations include
mishandling of classi�ed and top-secret information and other
unspeci�ed security issues.


Anderson states that he was repeatedly called into meetings with
Wahid Nawabi, who made “statements to indicate that Anderson
should stop reporting potential security violations to government
staff and should stop preventing AeroVironment staff and senior
management from commingling Secret and Top-Secret information
in violation of federal law”.  Anderson states that AeroVironment
attorneys also made “an effort to threaten him and dissuade his
ongoing reporting and enforcement of security protocols“.

In August 2016 AVAV apparently initiated an undisclosed internal
investigation that resulted in a purge of senior compliance
executives.  The whistleblower states that Nawabi’s true “motivation
was to rid the company of anyone who would not ‘play ball’ by
participating in a cover up”.  The terminated compliance executives
were offered generous severance in exchange for non-disclosure
agreements as “part of an effort to conceal and avoid the
consequences” of the company’s illegal activities, according to the
complaint.  Anderson says that he continued to engage in
whistleblowing but was removed from every top-secret program he
had previously run and ultimately �red last year in retaliation.


We discovered that at least 56 senior employees and executives
have left AVAV since the inception of the alleged cover-up, a
signi�cant amount of turnover considering the company reports
having only 661 employees in total.  Multiple senior employees have
left each of the company’s key departments and include the former

CFO, Accounting Director, Internal Audit Manager, Director of Product
Safety, Chief Legal O�cer, and numerous Program Managers,
Engineering Managers, and Sales Directors.  The extensive
managerial turnover at AVAV, in our view, adds credibility to the
whistleblower’s assertion of an internal purge and calls into question
the culture established by Wahid Nawabi.

These whistleblower allegations, if proven, may directly threaten
AVAV’s growth story. Management promotes itself as having the
opportunity to grow its government sales exponentially over the
coming years to over $1 Billion from just $155 million today (sales to
the US government account for 55% of the company’s total
revenues). But if Nawabi has covered up extensive illegal activity it
seems self-evident that AVAV’s relationship with government
agencies could be disrupted.  The political dynamics alone of the
government contracting with a company that allegedly attempted to
conceal putting the American public at risk by transporting live
bombs on a Delta �ight are extremely problematic, in our view. 
Especially since AVAV also allegedly mishandled top-secret
information, a violation that we understand would be treated very
seriously by authorities.  AVAV is also facing increasingly �erce
competition from companies that would likely be eager to seize on
any missteps to displace AVAV. The company’s own SEC �lings
speci�cally warn that:

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/aerovironment-ceos-alleged-cover-exposed/ 7/9


The alleged incidents create risks that are clearly material and the
company’s failure to disclose them is a serious issue, in our opinion.
Incredibly, Nawabi even touted the purported “sophisticated
differentiations that we offer with our defense business, safety
management systems, processes, an all that” to investors at the
August 2016 Jeffries Conference (transcript here). This statement
strikes us as highly misleading because it was made the exact same
month that the company allegedly initiated an internal investigation
into incidents caused by the failures of these systems and
processes.  At minimum, if AVAV found its problems severe enough
to investigate and then terminate leaders of its compliance team,
why weren’t investors informed? With such limited information, it’s
di�cult for us to gauge the precise impact of these allegations and
also impossible for us to know what interaction the company has
had with government agencies or investigators. This is precisely why
the company should immediately offer complete transparency to
investors.


We �nd it troubling that AVAV’s Chairman, Timothy Conver, has
dumped over $17 million worth of stock held by himself and his
family trust since the inception of the alleged cover-up (list of trades
here). The fundamental problem is that Conver has sold his shares
to investors who likely are completely unaware of the risks that
appear to have been concealed from them. We note that Conver
retired as AVAV’s CEO in May 2016 to become Chairman, just �ve
months after the whistleblower allegedly told the government about
the Delta incident and several months prior to the beginning of the
alleged internal investigation.  Conver was succeeded by Wahid
Nawabi, who was previously the company’s COO.


“If an audit or investigation of our business were to
uncover improper or illegal activities, then we could be
subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative
sanctions, including termination of contracts,
suspension of payments, �nes and suspension or
debarment from doing business with the U.S.
government”.

It’s hard to for us to give AVAV the bene�t of the doubt because the
company displays a variety of other red �ags:


AVAV was subject to a Department of Justice investigation
into government billing practices that it settled in 2013.


In 2014, a former executive turned whistleblower �led a Qui
Tam suit against AVAV (here) alleging the existence of a
fraudulent government billing scheme (the suit was dropped
without explanation in 2016).


The company’s most recent 10-K states that AVAV has
voluntarily disclosed export violations to the U.S. Department
of State and warns of potential “signi�cant �nes, penalties,
and sanctions”.


Last November, short-selling research �rm Spruce Point
released a detailed report (here) that highlighted issues
including the company’s lackluster �nancial performance,
poor capital allocation record, bad disclosure practices, and
threats from increased competition.


An activist investor, Engaged Capital, sent a series of letters
taking issue with bad governance practices that “eschew the
interests of shareholders in favor of the Board’s misguided
self-interests” (here, here, here).

We believe the equity is signi�cantly riskier than promoted. It is our
opinion that Anderson’s new whistleblower allegations introduce
material risks to the company’s growth story that simply are not
discounted at current prices.  We therefore see substantial downside
potential in AVAV shares.
