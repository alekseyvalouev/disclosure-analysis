Spruce Point Has Re-Established A Short Position 
in Echo Global Logistics (“Echo”) For The 
Following Reasons:


1
Our Initial Concerns About ECHO From September 2016 Proved Prescient: In our initial report entitled “Logistical 
Nightmare”, we warned about ECHO’s terrible management, failed roll-up strategy in the transportation logistics 
sector, aggressive use of Non-GAAP results, and its inability to maintain its competitive position in an increasingly 
technology-centric environment, would all lead to severe disappointment. ECHO’s analysts were calling for a $29 price 
target at the time, but with shares at $27, we argued the risk/reward was skewed towards 50% - 60% downside. With 
successive earnings disappointments, and mounting evidence that ECHO’s acquisition of Command Transportation in 
2015 was a bust, ECHO suspended long-term guidance and its acquisition strategy in July 2017. ECHO’s share price 
reached a low of $13.00, hitting our long-term price target range


2


3


Just A Little Luck Bails Out ECHO (Temporarily): Since hitting a low in July, ECHO’s share price has rallied an astounding 
117% back to $28/share with a little help from tightening of spot rates in areas affected by natural disasters such as 
Hurricane Harvey and Irma. This temporary phenomenon led to “surprise” upside to numbers: in Q3’17 sales 
increased YoY by 10.7%. However, even in such a tight rate environment, ECHO’s YoY GAAP earnings increased just 1 
cent from $0.08 to $0.09 or 6.6% - this underwhelming earnings increase demonstrates the lack of leverage in its 
business. ECHO’s management confidently proclaimed: “Given the strength of our recent results and the trends in our 
business, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter of 2017 to between $460 million and $500 
million, which also raises our full year 2017 revenue guidance to a range of $1.855 billion to $1.895 billion.” Recall just 
a few months earlier ECHO’s management suspended long-term guidance, which illustrates how little credibility they 
actually have in understanding their own markets and operating environment
Command Deal Increasingly Looks Like A Bust:  Our initial report warned that ECHO significantly overpaid for 
Command Transportation, and encumbered its assets with $230m of debt for a people-intensive asset light business. 
ECHO hyped $200 - $300m of revenue synergies, and an integrated technology platform that would provide significant 
earnings leverage. After millions spent on integration costs, capital expenditures and even a fancy new headquarters,  
ECHO has failed to come even close to its revenue synergy target. In Q3’17, the CEO indicated just $85m of 
“qualifiable” revenue synergies, and that he could not even quantify benefits from its “improved” technology 
platform. We note that ECHO’s Chief Technology officer quietly resigned in June 2017, which marks the 5th CTO ECHO 
churned through in 10 years. Based on our research, many former Command employees have fled to Arrive Logistics

Spruce Point Continues To See Long-Term 
50% - 65% Downside Risk In ECHO


4
Our Early Warnings of Technology Disruption, Margin Compression Coming To Fruition: We initially warned that a 
wave of new technology start-ups were poised to steal share and compress ECHO’s margins. In particular, we 
highlighted the coming threats from Uber and the application of its ride-sharing app to match supply and demand for 
trucking freight. We also pointed out that Amazon was likely to offer its vast logistics services as a business. Now with 
both of these companies (and others) competing for capacity, ECHO’s margins appear in structural decline. ECHO’s net 
revenue margins have compressed from nearly 35%+ in 2016 to 17%, and even declined by 50bps in Q3’17, 
supposedly a “strong” quarter. While management and some bulls might want you to think its margins are cyclically 
lower, we believe the issue is more structural and company-specific in nature 
Blockchain Now A New Worry For ECHO: Blockchain has received attention for its applications in crypto currency 
trading and finance. However, the supply chain and logistics industry, headed by the Blockchain In Transportation 
Alliance (BITA) are already working on ways to apply it in a manner that improves visibility, accountability and control 
along the logistics value chain. While still early days, in all likelihood any intermediary or middlemen in the 
transportation delivery process that adds cost (e.g. brokers like ECHO), are most at risk as contract terms and 
processes become standardized and transparent. Industry heavyweights such as UPS are already adopting blockchain 
and working on a decentralized brokerage system - essentially an open marketplace for shippers and carriers. 
Leveraging the transparency of information on the blockchain, the marketplace will let shippers optimize cost and 
time for every shipment. We interpret this UPS development as a substantial negative for ECHO


5


Terrible Risk / Reward Owning ECHO, Still See 50% - 65% Downside: Our conviction that technology is displacing 
ECHO has increased. Besides a temporary improvement in rates, we still believe ECHO is poorly positioned to succeed 
and has a much weaker balance sheet having burned through half its cash (near an all-time low). Its $230m busted 
convertible bond comes due in 2020 and is an overhang from its failed Command deal. Some analysts, remaining 
forever optimistic, see in excess of $30/share as a price target, but on average are at $25.75/share, representing 8% 
of immediate downside risk. Wall St. extrapolates recent earnings, and assumes ECHO will produce 11% sales growth 
and nearly 30% earnings growth, but we believe this is wildly optimistic and could set investors about for further 
disappointment from this perennial laggard. Trading at the richest 2018 multiple in the sector at 28x and 15x P/E and 
EBITDA, we believe ECHO should trade at discount to reflect its terrible management and poor positioning

ECHO CEO and 
CFO dump shares


Worse company and unchanged share price? ECHO’s share behavior is irrational and reflects a misunderstanding of 
its business. There is ample evidence to suggest that the Command acquisition was a bust, leaving ECHO saddled 


with debt and a near record low cash on its balance sheet. Its margins have contracted significantly, which we believe 
is due to structural changes in its industry

ECHO’s Command Acquisition A Bust


Echo CFO Kyle Sauers (8/16/15): “I'm excited to update you on our long-term targets. You will recall that the 2017 targets 
that we issued last summer included plans for $2 billion in revenue and $100 million of non-GAAP EBITDA. We are already 
well ahead of plan toward these targets, and as such, we're issuing new 2018 targets of $3 billion in revenue and non-GAAP 
EBITDA of $150 million. Embedded in these targets are annual organic revenue growth rates of 10% to 12%, annual revenue 
synergies from the Command integration of $200 million to $300 million by 2018, and an additional $200 million to $300 
million of new acquisition revenue”


ECHO CEO Doug Waggoner (10/25/17): “Sure today we've got about $85 million or so of qualifiable revenue synergies 
from the CBU business unit formerly Command. And that number continues to grow with their penetration on the LTL and 
the parcel side. On the Truckload side it's quite difficult for us to evaluate synergies that we might be getting from 
improved technology platform that we have, as well as newer operating procedures that we think are very effective in 
terms of operating our Truckload business.”


ECHO’s acquisition of Command Transportation in 2015 brought it more exposure to the spot truckload market. 
Yet, even with the acquired revenue and some synergies, it was unable to materially boost earnings during a 
tight spot truckload market. We warned that ECHO’s Command acquisition synergies would be a total failure. 


ECHO guided to $200 - $300m of revenue synergies, a target so astronomically high, they were hard to believe in 
relation to Command’s $561m of 2014 sales. This is just further evidence of ECHO’s terrible management.

technology methods to disrupt ECHO and its competitive positioning

CIO revamping transportation system as ‘killer app’


“Kutz is directing the company’s 110 IT staff to build the “killer app.” That means refactoring the company’s proprietary transportation 
system so that it can adapt to new business models or respond to dynamic market changes. “The ability to change at will is my strategic 
imperative,” he says. To do that, Echo Global needs to trim software development lifecycle time for new features and functionality from three 
months to four to six weeks. For example, if a shipper requires better visibility into how their shipments are being tracked, Echo Global must 
deliver that change more quickly. That requires new IT processes and aggressive project management, largely in the company’s engineering 
practices.”  Source: CIO Sept 24, 2015


Since our initial report, Mr. Kutz, ECHO’s Chief Technology Officer (renamed Chief “Information” Officer), 
mysteriously resigned. Mr. Kutz left in June 2017, having never realized the dream of building a “killer app”

ECHO Is Still Fundamentally Challenged By 
Tectonic Technology Changes Happening


Uberization of Trucking: Uber and its location based app technology has disrupted traditional 
transportation businesses such as car rental and taxi/limo companies by empowering drivers to 
supply car capacity, and offer users more options often at lower prices.  The concept of “Uber 
for Trucking” is analogous and may be giving rise to deflationary pricing as start-ups seek to 
undercut traditional brokers such as ECHO 


Amazon Push Into Logistics:  Amazon has finally moved into the logistics space after much 
speculation. Known for its desire to gain market share at the expense of profits, Amazon’s 
model allows anyone to chose a focus territory and leverage Amazon’s technology. The long-
term implications are negative for fringe logistic brokerage players like ECHO


There are three elephants in the room that will fundamentally weigh on ECHO’s future earnings 


Blockchain Technology Movement:  Blockchain has received significant attention for its 
applications in cryptocurrency trading and potential applications in finance. However, the 
supply chain and logistics industry is already forming working groups to apply this technology 
in its industry. The traditional brokers / middlemen such as ECHO stand to be big losers in a 
fully blockchain automated world where contracts are standardized, and transportation 
capacity and pricing become more transparent
10


1) Uberization of Trucking Technology Set 
To Disrupt ECHO and Others


Uber Freight was officially launched in 2017 and its location-based app technology has disrupted traditional 
transportation businesses such as car rental and taxi/limo companies by empowering drivers to supply car 


capacity, and offer users more options often at lower prices.  The concept of “Uber for Trucking” is analogous 
and may be giving rise to deflationary pricing as start-ups seek to undercut traditional brokers such as ECHO.  


Uberization of Trucking Offers Many Advantages to the Market 


• For carriers, benefits could include lower operating costs, increased loaded miles (wasted downtime), higher revenues (due to less 
brokerage fees), better fuel efficiency and asset utilization, more transparency, and reduced admin / paperwork costs


• On the shipper side, larger app-based marketplaces should give small shippers more access to ready capacity, at price points that they 
can more easily control. Large shippers, on the other hand, should be better able to manage exception freight that falls outside of their 
typical contract agreements, such as freight surges prior to holiday


According to a Frost & Sullivan Study (Uber for Trucks: Executive Analysis, May 2016)


• Believes that the Uber model for trucking is poised to revolutionize freight mobility
• Mobile based freight brokerage generates ~$100m in revenues. By 2025, the mobile freight market is expected to grow at a compound 


annual growth rate of 74.65% and generate $26.4bn in revenue for the entire market. Estimated that by 2025, 16% of 3PL will be 
enabled through mobile platforms


• “Mobile-based freight brokers are strategizing to grow their network by offering as much value as possible for free to customers on 
their apps. In addition to strengthening their freight brokering capabilities, mobile-based freight brokers are bundling transportation 
management solutions together to attract customers”


According to an Oliver Wyman recent study: (Uber Trucking is on its Way, 2016)


“Many of the new trucking apps are being developed by non-traditional technology companies with brokerage authority, and these are 
looking to increase their appeal by undercutting the middleman fees charged by traditional freight brokers, while offering more 
comprehensive solutions. Thus much like the taxi industry, which is now fighting back against ride sharing with its own streamlined apps 
(such as Hailo and Arro), traditional truck freight brokers will need to embrace “uberization” as well – or risk being displaced entirely.”

2) Amazon: The 10,000 Pound Gorilla


• Amazon has “hundreds of Ph.D. mathematicians” who spend their days optimizing logistics; “It’s just one giant 
math exercise,” a Deutsche Bank analyst recently wrote 


• UPS and FedEx have shrugged off Amazon’s threat to their business, in public anyway (2). On a conference call in 
February 2016, UPS CEO David Abney was diplomatic: “Amazon’s a good customer of ours. We have a mutually 
beneficial relationship.” In an investor call the following month, FedEx CEO Fred Smith scoffed at the notion that 
Amazon might challenge his company, calling it “fantastical.” 


• Lieb, a Northeastern professor, who’s been talking to CEOs in the shipping industry for 23 years, says they’re less 
confident in private. “When Amazon was talking about same-day delivery, people said, ‘Who cares? We don’t want 
that business anyway,’ ” Lieb says. But once Amazon began leasing planes, they started to worry. “Amazon’s market 
entry strategy has pretty much been ‘I’m going to come in and I’m going to beat you to death with low prices,’ ” he 
says. “If Amazon follows that tactic, they would destabilize this industry rather quickly.”


• The fear has spread to Wall Street, where analysts say investors worry about what Amazon’s strategy means for 
the shipping industry. “The natural inclination among any observers of the market when they see Amazon is to be 
scared,” says David Vernon, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst who tracks the shipping market. “Amazon is the epitome of 
a zero-sum game.”

3) Blockchain: The Looming Disruptor


To date, the popularity and application of blockchain has been well publicized in the use of cryptocurrency trading 
and applications in finance. However, blockchain technologies will be adopted in the transportation and logistics 


industry. The Blockchain In Trucking Alliance (BITA) was recently formed, and is working on major issues including 
1) smart contracts,  2) freight payment, 3) asset maintenance and ownership history, and 4) transparency and chain 


of custody in freight. We view these developments as in all likelihood negative for pure brokers such as ECHO

accurate transparency

negative for a broker

major negative for Brokers
