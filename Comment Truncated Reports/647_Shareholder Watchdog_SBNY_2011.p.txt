Signature Bank: An Obvious Financial Short
Sep. 28, 2011 5:54 AM ET7 comments
by: Shareholder Watchdog


Our track record of identifying opportunities to make money in bank stocks has resulted in
significant profits (and avoidance of losses) for investors that have followed our work. In
April 2010, we highlighted PCBC as the most extreme example of speculative capital
chasing distressed banks. In June 2011, we exposed HMPR's temporary spike as a great
short opportunity based on its unusual addition to the Russell 2000 index.


Both bank stocks declined by more than 75% following our articles. While the dramatic
sell-off in financial stocks has created a few long opportunities, we believe that a
significant short opportunity has arisen due in part to the actions of the Federal Reserve.
Based on our work, investors do not yet understand the negative impact that the collapse
in interest rates will have on certain banks. As a result, banks with large securities
portfolios (especially those that have been large relative outperformers), are setting
investors (and sellside analysts) up for major earnings disappointments.


We believe the largest dislocation between investor perception and a probable earnings
collapse is Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY). SBNY has been one of the best performing
bank stocks this year and has been rewarded with one of the most expensive earnings
and price-to-tangible book multiples in the financial universe. We believe a nasty surprise
awaits the complacent investor community that has been "hiding" in SBNY once it
becomes clear that current estimates are wildly aggressive.


The math is simple and the numbers don't lie. SBNY has one of the largest allocations to
residential mortgage backed securities (43% of assets) and one of the highest yields on
their securities book (3.9%) among all publicly traded banks. RMBS yields have been
DECIMATED by the collapse in the 10-year Treasury rate. In the first half of 2011, GSE
mortgage securities were yielding between 3.75%-4%. Today, they are yielding LESS
THAN 2.5%. SBNY's security portfolio yield is highly correlated to the Fannie Mae
mortgage yield index that has collapsed - a fact that has been ignored by investors that
will be blindsided by the earnings collapse. SBNY earnings will likely come under
significant stress as it reinvests maturities and prepayments into dramatically lower
yielding assets.

We believe that SBNY's premium valuation is at risk with the inevitable earnings collapse.
Despite our burgeoning constructive stance towards banks, we view SBNY as a unique
short opportunity - one that should underperform on a relative basis, as well as decline in
absolute terms. Based on very optimistic asset growth and yield assumptions, we believe
SBNY's earnings will decline by 5-10% in 2012 (versus expectations of 13% growth). If we
use our generous EPS estimates AND give SBNY the benefit of a premium multiple, we
still arrive at a $32 price target, or 35% downside from current levels. Under more
draconian scenarios (such as greater NIM compression, higher refinance activity, limited
growth, and/or credit issues), the shares could face even more downside.


Background on Signature Bank


Signature Bank has $13 billion of assets and is headquartered in New York City. Unlike so
many high quality banks, it was recently founded in 2001 by a team of bankers from
Republic National Bank, which was acquired by HSBC (HBC). The 2007 takeover of North
Fork Bank by Capital One (NYSE:COF) accelerated the pace of new bankers joining
SBNY. The bank has built a solid deposit franchise, which has likely caused the strange
complacency among investors. However, with interest rates near zero and a relatively flat
yield curve, the inherent value in any deposit franchise has been greatly diminished. The
securities portfolio has always been an outsized characteristic of SBNY. It represented
over 60% of assets in 2004 and has been between 40%-50% of assets over the last five
years.


RMBS constitutes $5.6 billion of the $6.3 billion securities portfolio. With the additions of
the North Fork lending team, SBNY rapidly grew their commercial real estate portfolio at
the height of the commercial real estate boom. To date, SBNY has not experienced a
large degradation in credit. Interestingly, credit does not need to deteriorate, yet we
believe investors still face greater than 30% downside based on obvious earnings risk.
Beyond the earnings decline we discuss later, should the rapid and aggressive loan
growth catch up with SBNY, the shares would likely face greater than 50% downside.

Why the Stock Outperformance is Unwarranted:


Asset sensitive banks have performed miserably since mid-year. We define asset
sensitive banks as those with large C&I loan portfolios where loan yields are tied to LIBOR
and Prime. The stocks of three larger C&I lenders, Comerica (NYSE:CMA),
PrivateBancorp (NASDAQ:PVTB) and FirstMerit (NASDAQ:FMER), have declined by
35%-45% since June 30th. This collapse in asset sensitive banks has been closely
correlated to the collapse in the 10-year Treasury rate.

Both accelerated at the end of July with the downgrade of the US Government's AAA
rating by S&P and took another leg down following the August 9th announcement by the
Fed that they would "hold interest rates at ultralow levels at least through mid-2013." The
most recent drop has been the result of anticipation of the Fed's "Operation Twist"
announcement. We believe the drop in the 10-year is much worse for SBNY than it is for
the asset sensitive banks. Despite this, SBNY has actually outperformed the KBW Bank
Index by over 1050 basis points and the asset sensitive banks by 1800 to 2800 basis
points since June 30th.

The decline in the 10-year and the Fed's promise to maintain low short term rates for an
extended period of time is not, on its own, a negative for asset sensitive banks. LIBOR
and Prime are about as low as they can go (the Fed cannot cut the fed funds rate below
zero), so incremental margin pressure would not come from lower interest rates. An
extended period of low short term rates does put a lid on asset sensitive banks as a higher
fed fund rates is likely required for an expanding net interest margin.

As a result, analysts have reduced their estimates over the past month and the recovery
to "normalized" earnings power of these banks has been pushed out. Also, competitive
pressures in C&I and weak economic activity is expected to pressure loan growth
(although this is likely the case in all loan categories).


While an extended period of low short term rates is delays a positive reversion trade for
asset sensitive banks, it is not necessarily a reason to sell all asset sensitive banks.
HOWEVER, declining 10-year yields (vs. stable yields at low levels) is undoubtedly a
negative for banks with large securities portfolios. Banks with high security yields have
been "over-earning" relative to today's reinvestment opportunity-set. As such, they face
large earnings holes going forward as the "true" earnings growth rates are reset.


Our experience suggests that when earnings streams become impaired for secular
reasons, multiples tend to collapse on these lower earnings, which is a "double whammy"
to the stock price. As the table above highlights, the 10-year Treasury rate has declined
41%, or over 125 basis points, in the past two months to historic lows. For banks with
large security portfolios, the mounting pressure is two fold: reinvestment risk on maturing
securities and reinvestment risk on prepayments. The pressure will be most intense on
portfolios with large weightings in residential mortgage banked securities.


SBNY Faces Massive Headwind


Of the 150 largest U.S. banks by market cap, SBNY has one of the highest concentrations
of assets in RMBS securities at over 43%. By comparison, the top 150 banks in the U.S.
hold on average only 10%-15% of their assets in RMBS according to SNL. We could find
only four other banks with a higher percentage of assets (three of those four were only
slightly higher). SBNY's security portfolio yield of 3.9% is also unsustainably high; ranking
it in the top quartile of banks in the U.S.


However, since SBNY's last earnings report, RBMS security yields have been
DECIMATED as they trade off a spread to the 10-year Treasury rate. To better illustrate
the degree of the carnage, GSE mortgage securities were yielding between 3.75%-4% in
the first half of 2011 (inline with SBNY's security yield). Today, they are yielding LESS
THAN 2.5%. As the table below highlights, SBNY's securities portfolio yield is highly
correlated to the Fannie Mae 30-year mortgage yield index. As that Index has completely
collapsed, we believe SBNY's securities yield is also poised to collapse - a probability that
has NOT been priced into the stock or reflected in analyst expectations (see chart here).

*The index yield is based on par value. With securities trading at a 5% premium to par, this


represents a 2.4%-2.5% yield.


Booming refinance activity should only accelerate the pressure on the securities yield as
SBNY will be forced to reinvest current maturities AND payoffs into dramatically lower
yielding assets. Also, should the Administration's plans to revamp the HARP program
have any success, SBNY will see incremental pressure. Our understanding is that an
enhanced program is expected to be announced shortly and will likely target 2-5 million
high LTV mortgages for refinance. Prepayments could also hit book value at some point.
SBNY is currently carrying their GSE, CMO and RMBS investments at a $114 million gain
above par (this gain represents 10% of book value). If prepayments increase, SBNY could
see this gain diminish as the securities pay off at par. Under this scenario, the bank could
face disastrous earnings and book value pressure.


In the past, SBNY has tried to mitigate lower yields by extending duration. Adding duration
with RMBS securites (almost their entire securities portfolio) offers little offset today. As
mortgage rates drop precipitously, refinance activity will drive much shorter than expected
durations. The only option SBNY has to mitigate the reinvestment risk is to
DRAMATICALLY increase the credit risk of the portfolio (in theory, they could also buy
exotic and risky mortgage securities, but we don't consider this likely). The only Fannie
(OTCQB:FNMA) / Freddie (OTCQB:FMCC) / Ginnie securities or structures today that
offer yields near SBNY's current yield are very risky and volatile securities like inverse IOs
or inverse floaters. These markets are relatively small and illiquid (so difficult to put a lot of
money to work) and given their inherent leverage and volatility, are undesirable
investments for banks. Alternatively, they could add junk rated or subprime securities to
the portfolio. If this occurred, we believe SBNY's premium valuation would come under
pressure given the increased risk profile.

The securities portfolio is not the only factor that could stress the financial model. As
business confidence wanes, loan demand will dry up. As banks stretch for loan growth,
spreads are likely to tighten. As a result, we expect incremental pressure on loan growth
and incremental pressure on asset yields in CRE. A recent high profile refinance provides
an example of this competitive pressure. SBNY had a $31.5 million mortgage on a class A
property in Manhattan that was paying them 6.5%. In July, HSBC refinanced the building
with a loan at LIBOR + 250, or only 2.85%. SBNY will benefit from a one-time prepayment
penalty, but at the expense of future earnings. Further, with their competition willing to
write loans at rates 365 basis points below SBNY's current rate, their ability to find
attractive, low risk, high yielding loans is greatly diminished.


Below is an estimated income statement for the next several quarters. We believe it
includes relatively optimistic assumptions, such as $2 billion in balance sheet growth (in
an environment with limited loan demand) and total cost of funds increasing by less than
$5 million a quarter by the end of 2012 (so basically funding that $2 billion of growth at
nearly zero cost--the FDIC insurance on new deposits alone would increase funding
costs). We also assume there is a very gradual reduction in the yield of securities (so we
do not assume HARP 2.0 is successful in driving refinance activity).


Our model also assumes the historically high correlation between the MTGEFNCL index
and SBNY's yield completely breaks down (another generous assumption). The index and
the yield have been within 17 basis points of each other for five of the previous seven
quarters. We generously assume in our model that SBNY's yield leaps 75 to 85 basis
points higher than the index. We are not sure how this can be accomplished, but it
highlights the friendly inputs used in our base case earnings assumptions. We also
assume very little degradation on the yield of the loan portfolio despite intense competition
for loans in SBNY's markets and no incremental credit deterioration.

Even with these unrealistically optimistic assumptions, we still calculate earnings that will
decline over the next six quarters. Based on our generous assumptions, SBNY would
conclude 2012 with earnings that would be 25% lower than current consensus estimates.
If we again were overly generous and assigned SBNY an earnings multiple that was 47%
higher than the KBW Bank Index's current multiple (11x vs.7.5x 2012 estimates), SBNY's
stock price would be around $32 per share.


Despite all of these rosy assumptions and a massive relative premium multiple, we still get
a stock price that would represent 35% downside from current levels. If SBNY were to
trade inline with the bank group (let a lone if we adjusted the rosy earnings assumptions),
