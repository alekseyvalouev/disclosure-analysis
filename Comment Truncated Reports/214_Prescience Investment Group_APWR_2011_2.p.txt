Clouds Thicken Over A-Power Energy Generation Systems

A-Power Energy Generation Systems (“APWR” or “the company”) is a U.S.-listed Chinese
company with accounting and audit-related issues. We originally published our research
findings pertaining to APWR on Friday, June 17. The analysis can be found here. The
company has yet to file its 2010 audited financial statements and is currently under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


As a cautious investment manager, we have gone to great lengths to verify A-Power’s
claims made in SEC filings and in press releases. Although our investigation is ongoing,
the data we have gathered up to this point has cast serious doubt over management’s
reporting of A-Power’s financial condition. Our evidence, discussed in this and our initial
report, includes the following:


Several events have transpired since we originally published our research that can be
interpreted as glaring red flags. These events include director and auditor resignations,
a halt in trading by the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, and the opening of an investigation
by the SEC regarding APWR potentially having violated federal securities laws.
APWR has a history of internal weaknesses over financial controls, which has resulted
in an adverse opinion from A-Power’s (now-resigned) independent auditor. A-Power’s
recently resigned auditor issued an adverse opinion in the 2009 audit and APWR has
yet to publish its 2010 audited financial statements.
APWR discloses a number of “Related Party Balances” in which APWR is both lending
money to and borrowing money from related individuals and businesses. However,
management does not adequately discuss the actual transactions occurring between
APWR and these related businesses. The relationship between APWR and its related
parties is one that will undoubtedly require SEC scrutiny and could possibly result in
material financial restatements.
Our attempts to locate and/or contact distributed generation facilities mentioned on A-
Power’s website and in recent press releases have failed. Our investigation team in
China has prepared a report for us in which 39 companies out of 39 companies on our
list have either not been locatable, or refused to answer even a preliminary set of
questions. Our spreadsheet includes addresses, phone numbers, Chinese and English
names, websites, and some other information we have put together. We also searched

for evidence of distributed generation facilities on Google Maps and found many
vacant lots (although data is sometimes outdated).


GLARING RED FLAGS


Several material events have transpired since we originally published our analysis that
can be interpreted as glaring red flags, validating our initial concerns:


The same day our initial analysis was published (June 17), APWR board member
Robert Leckie resigned “as a result of concerns that his views on process and best
practices were not necessarily shared throughout the Company”.
On the following trading day, Monday, June 20, APWR issued a ‘pre-response’ to our
analysis, stating that it was reviewing the issues raised in our article and that it
intended to provide answers ‘by way of a press release as soon as possible’. It has yet
to do so.
One week later, APWR’s auditor (MSCM LLC) resigned, announcing that it had
refused to sign off on the company’s financial position, and the NASDAQ stock
exchange halted all trading in APWR stock.
On Tuesday, June 28, another 2 independent directors resigned.
On Tuesday, July 5, APWR announced that its CFO Peter Mak would be stepping
down. (More recently, Mak stepped down as head of the audit committee of Trina Solar
Ltd. (NYSE:TSL), purportedly a result of his ties with A-Power.)
On Tuesday, August 18, APWR issued a press release entitled “A-Power Receives
SEC Subpoena,” announcing it is currently under investigation by the SEC. The SEC
is investigating whether the “Company or any of its personnel violated federal
securities laws.”


More recent decisions from the company indicate little intent of regaining investor
confidence.


DEAR AUDITOR – A WORD OF CAUTION


On Tuesday, September 20, APWR issued the following press release: A-Power Appoints
BDO Daejoo as its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The announcement
contained the following statement.

…the Audit Committee of A-Power's Board of Directors has approved the
engagement of BDO Daejoo LLC as its new independent registered public
accounting firm and has specifically engaged BDO Daejoo LLC to audit the
Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010. The
appointment was made on September 16, 2011, effective September 15, 2011.


BDO Daejoo LLC is currently registered with the Public Company Accounting
and Oversight Board.


The engagement by the Company of BDO Daejoo LLC follows the resignation
of the Company's former independent registered public accounting firm, MSCM
LLP, effective June 26, 2011. As previously reported, MSCM LLP stated that it
had resigned because the Company had not retained a qualified independent
forensic accounting firm to evaluate certain business transactions that MSCM
stated was necessary for MSCM to complete its audit of the Company's
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 on a timely basis.


Strangely however, two weeks later on October 4, APWR announced that BDO Daejoo
rescinded its acceptance and engagement to serve as A-Power’s independent auditor. As
a replacement, A-Power appointed Simon & Edward, LLP as its Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm.


A-Power last reported a net cash position of $111.5 million. In 2009, it paid its recently
resigned auditor MSCM LLP a whopping CDN$581,275: It can afford to hire a top-tier
auditing firm with a strong, well-established reputation. Especially during this time of
severed trust and regulator scrutiny, hiring a Top-4 auditor -- or even a Top-100 for that
matter -- would seem the optimal deployment of cash on hand and a worthwhile
investment in restoring the trust of the investment community.


Instead, it hired Simon & Edward LLP. According to the APWR press release,


The selection of Simon & Edward, LLP was based on the firm's extensive
experience auditing public companies in the United States and China. The firm
is a U.S. based accounting firm with its offices in City of Industry, California and
Beijing, China. The firm's partners include individuals with significant
experience with S.E.C. reporting requirements and S.E.C. audits.

Simon & Edward is not a Top-100 firm. As a matter of fact, according to its most recent
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection, it appears to be a tiny
firm with 3 partners and 5 issuer audit clients. Notably, Simon & Edward seems to be
making a late, ill-fated plunge into the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO space. In the past few
months, it has engaged other issuer clients that have been accused of hoodwinking U.S.
investors.


On April 6, 2011, Chinese RTO China Agritech (OTCPK:CAGC) announced it had hired
Simon & Edward LLP. LM Research has accused CAGC of being a scam set up to make
fraudulent transfers of wealth from the pockets of outside investors into those of inside
management. LM Research’s findings indicate the company’s reported facilities were non-
operational and that reported clients denied having a business relationship with CAGC.
Like A-Power, CAGC has yet to file its 2010 audited financial statements with the SEC.
Trading in CAGC common stock was halted by the NASDAQ on March 14, 2011. The
company was delisted by the NASDAQ on May 20, 2011. As of the writing of this report,
CAGC stock is down 93.7% in 2011.


It is no wonder that CAGC has made a mockery of the auditor institution, with Simon &
Edward LLP being its third in only a 2 year timeframe. But it is baffling that Simon &
Edward LLP is willing to take on such reputational risk.


On July 13, 2011, Chinese RTO China Green Material (OTC:CAGM) announced that it
had hired Simon & Edward LLP. For the sake of brevity, we’ll point out that CAGM has had
recent turnover in its CFO position, and has had 4 auditors since its reverse merger on
February 9, 2007. As of the writing of this report, CAGM stock is down 84% in 2011.


There is growing caution amongst auditors resulting from a renewed focus by the SEC on
the auditors of Chinese companies. We encourage A-Power’s auditor Simon & Edward
LLP to navigate with caution, and to carefully weigh what evidence they’ve collected that
would indicate that APWR is accurately reflecting its financial position.


‘WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS AGAIN?'


With help from our investigators in China, we were able to put together a list of A-Power’s
recent distributed generation clients in China. Part of this list came directly from APWR’s
website: When we began researching the company several months ago, both the Chinese
and English versions of the site offered a list of completed projects. Interestingly, APWR
appears to have removed the list from its site.

Fortunately we took snapshots of the old website. Here are a few: Changchun
Biochemistry Group Co., Ltd., Wuhan Iron and Steel, Wanshunda Starch Co., Ltd.


It had appeared to us that the list on the unaltered website had not been updated in recent
years. To supplement it, we also looked back at the press releases announcing project
wins since January 2010. Our final list contains 40 entries:


With this list in hand, we hired a reputable and independent third-party due-diligence
investigation team in China to contact as many of these organizations as possible. This
team is staffed with both American and Chinese citizens, and has been working in China
for over a decade. A spreadsheet of our investigator’s findings can be found here. To
summarize, only a handful of these customers were reachable, or even locatable in any
way. The few we were able to locate were unwilling to speak. Some of these companies
had websites which appeared “fake” to our investigators. Many had a locatable address
with no signs of construction or distributed generation facilities at the expected locations,
and many companies had no locatable address using common internet mapping software.
