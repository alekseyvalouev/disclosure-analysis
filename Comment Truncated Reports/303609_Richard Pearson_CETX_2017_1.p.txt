Summary


On Tuesday, Cemtrex fell 13% on huge volume. On the preceding trading day,
Cemtrex’s banker Source Capital quietly had its SEC and FINRA registrations
terminated following multiple violations.
Over $1 million has been paid to notorious stock promoters sending CETX soaring
from below $2. Heavy undisclosed selling by CETX insiders during paid promotion.
DOCUMENTS: Founder Aron Govil is secretly paying promoters via an undisclosed
entity with little or no other activity. Using same promoters behind imploded frauds
Force�eld Energy and Code Rebel.
PHOTOS: CETX’s supposed audit �rm traced to vacant strip mall in Texas, no
operations. Controlling partner was banned by SEC for multiple fraudulent audits,
under multiple �rm names.
Nearly $100 million in revenues, from 4 countries on 3 continents. Cemtrex pays
auditor just $20,000 per year in audit fees to sign off on �nancials. Non-sense.


Note: This article represents the opinion of the author. Nothing herein comprises a recommendation to buy or
sell any security. Following exposure of the problems listed below, I expect that many of the links cited may be
changed or removed by the parties implicated. I have made various e�orts to retain pdf copes and screen
shots where possible. The author is short shares of CETX. 


Note: The short interest in Cemtrex (NASDAQ:CETX (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CETX)) is extremely
low at just 400,000 shares (just a single day’s trading volume) such that this has created a very interesting
situation.


Recent trading


Yesterday we saw shares of Cemtrex fall by 13% on nearly 1 million shares of volume with no apparent news.
But in fact, on the previous trading day (Monday was a holiday), Cemtrex’s investment bank, Source Capital,
had its SEC and FINRA registrations terminated
(https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_36719.pdf) nationally and in all states.

7/5/2019 Short CETX. Documents and Photos, All Signs Point to Fraud - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 2/36


There was no announcement and no press release that I could �nd. The only way to �nd out was by checking
FINRA’s Broker Check (https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_36719.pdf) website. FINRA has still not
uploaded the details of the latest violations, but we can see from a Florida lawsuit that Source was forced to
pay a massive settlement to retirees who were sold risky and unsuitable investments that quickly went
bankrupt.


To me, this looks like the end of Source Capital. And it followed past violations by Source brokers
including forgery (https://stockbrokerfraud.com/source-capital-group-broker-barred-forgery/),
selling unregistered securities (https://stockbrokerfraud.com/source-capital-group-charged-sale-unregistered-
securities/), withholding material information (https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_36719.pdf) from
investors and dealing at unfair prices (https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_36719.pdf).


The fraud


As my regular readers know, I often express signi�cant concerns about problems I �nd with publicly traded
companies. But these readers know that I will seldom come out and actually use the word “fraud”.


But I feel comfortable that the extensive use of the word “fraud” is entirely appropriate in this article for the
reasons below. The points I will make below are supported by on the ground photographs as well
as o�icial government documents from various agencies.


1. Cemtrex is being heavily promoted by a promotion �rm known as “Small Cap Specialists” (AKA “SCS”).
Past SCS promotions have been repeatedly halted or delisted due to �nancial irregularities or outright fraud.
(Examples include delisted frauds Force�eld Energy and Code Rebel, among others). On its website, the SEC
has gone so far as to speci�cally warn investors about these exact type of promoters as an indication
of micro cap fraud.


2. Documents indicate that Aron Govil is paying this same promoter SCS to promote Cemtrex via wire
transfers from an undisclosed entity in New York. The paid promotion by Cemtrex insiders has not been
disclosed to Cemtrex investors. In the past, I have seen numerous examples (https://www.justice.gov/usao-
edny/pr/chairman-board-force�eld-energy-inc-arrested-securities-fraud-conspiracy) of other companies
engaged in similar undisclosed paid promotions that resulted in Federal charges or lawsuits for securities
fraud.


3. As the share price has soared due to promotion, documents show that shares held by Cemtrex insiders
(Aaron Govil, Saagar Govil and CFO Dela Rama) have been decreasing substantially during 2016,
yet Cemtrex insiders have failed to disclose any sales on Form 4’s during 2016. On places like Twitter,
the Govils continue to tout the stock, encouraging retail investors to buy.


4. The controlling partner behind Cemtrex’s auditor was banned by the SEC
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/34-77542.pdf) and PCAOB
(https://www.law360.com/articles/836553/sec-judge-�nds-texas-auditor-failed-independence-standard) for
conducting fraudulent audits or reviews of public companies while performing little or no work and without
even being licensed. Cemtrex’s auditor continues to claim that the �rm is run from an o�ice in Texas.
But photos show that this address traces to a long-since vacant strip mall. The audit �rm is not even
licensed to practice in Texas. The only listed phone number in the US has been disconnected. That partner
has repeatedly audited public companies under the guise of di�erently named audit �rms which have then
been shut down. When one audit �rm gets shut down, he has repeatedly created new ones and then audits
the same clients, using the same personnel, reporting the exact same address in Texas. Cemtrex’s prior
auditor was shut down by the PCAOB and is now classi�ed as a “prohibited service provider

page=1&pageSize=50&id=1380&�lterOn=5)“. Despite having revenues of nearly $100 million and operations
in 4 countries across 3 continents, Cemtrex has only paid these auditors a mere $15,000-$20,000 per year to
“audit” its complex �nancials.


5. The investment banks and IR �rms hired by Cemtrex (including Source Capital) have repeatedly
represented other heavily promoted companies that have been promoted by SCS or other promoters. There
has been long running and signi�cant involvement with companies, individuals or activities implicated
in securities fraud.


Background


Over the past few years, I have exposed dozens of stock promotions, pump and dumps and outright frauds.
The result tends to be the same in each case. After these stocks are exposed, their share prices fall by at
least 80% to just pennies. In some cases, after I have exposed these companies, we have seen SEC
investigations, criminal indictments, management and auditor resignations and other fallouts. In some cases,
this has happened within just days of my article being published. In other cases, the stocks have simply
imploded without further fanfare.


With Cemtrex, there is a reason why the numbers appear to be “too good to be true”. There is a reason why
there has been a surge of glowing media articles touting Cemtrex and its management. And there is a reason
why the stock keeps selling o� even when supposedly good news is released.


There are clear reasons why hundreds of small retail investors have been duped into buying the stock
and these are all thoroughly debunked and exposed below.


Company overview


Cemtrex has two business segments (http://www.secinfo.com/d1DY5f.wfRr.htm#1stPage):


Electronics Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) provides electronic manufacturing services, including product
design and sustaining engineering services, printed circuit board assembly and production, etc.


Industrial Products and Services (“IP”) o�ers services for in plant equipment erection, relocation, and
maintenance; air �ltration and environmental control products; and monitoring instruments, for measurement
of emissions of Greenhouse gases, hazardous gases, etc.


Cemtrex was founded 15 years ago by Aron Govil. Govil also runs Ducon Technologies which operates out of
the same address as Cemtrex and which owns Cemtrex shares. Through his personal and Ducon
holdings, Aron Govil is the largest shareholder in Cemtrex.


In 2008, Govil appointed his 23 year old son, Saagar Govil, into various executive and board positions at
Cemtrex. Young Saagar had just graduated (https://www.linkedin.com/in/saagargovil/) from undergrad that
same year in 2008, with no prior reported work experience.


Just 2 years later, at the age of 25, Saagar was appointed CEO of Cemtrex and father Aron took the role of
executive director and board member.


Following the appointment of Saagar Govil as CEO, Cemtrex quickly embarked upon a slew of acquisitions,
primarily of obscure companies in foreign countries well outside of the US.


Cemtrex has employed an aggressive IR and media relations �rm to obtain an avalanche of positive media
coverage around the Govils and Cemtrex.


Saagar has recently been the subject of a �ood of glowing media attention due to his young age and the
apparent rapid growth of Cemtrex’s revenues.

7/5/2019 Short CETX. Documents and Photos, All Signs Point to Fraud - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 4/36


Between 2012 (http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.n2hd.htm#1stPage) and 2016
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1DY5f.wfRr.htm#7z9z), reported revenues grew from $12 million to $94 million,
largely driven by acquisitions of insolvent companies in overseas markets, which then contributed heavily to
Cemtrex’s results as soon as they were acquired.


Key points underlying fraud thesis


Again, based on my past experiences and observations, I believe that there is a very strong chance
that Cemtrex gets delisted outright and will go to zero.


The key points I will address are as follows:


Point #1 – The massive paid by promotion, secretly paid by Cemtrex management


Point #2 – Cemtrex insiders make undisclosed sales while pushing retail investors to buy


Point #3 – Cemtrex’s defunct auditor gone missing, history of fraud


Point #4 – The 3rd party service providers


Point #5 – Financial and disclosure “irregularities” and inconsistencies


Point #1 – The massive paid by promotion, secretly paid by Cemtrex management


In 2016, the SEC put out an Investor Alert Bulletin entitled: Fraudulent Stock Promotions
(https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ia_promotions.html).


In this, it warned that:


Be especially cautious regarding stock promotions if there are any warning signs of microcap fraud
including:


· The SEC suspended public trading of the security or other securities promoted by the same
promoter.


· Increase in stock price or trading volume linked to promotional activity. …


This is precisely what we see with Cemtrex and the promotions being run by a �rm known as Small Cap
Specialists (AKA “SCS”). SCS has been behind dozens of imploded stock promotions including a number of
high pro�le frauds which were halted and / or delisted by the SEC.


SCS happens to be the exact same promotion �rm that Aron Govil is paying under an undisclosed
entity name to run a pump campaign on Cemtrex. SCS has now been promoting Cemtrex for over 1 year.
During that time, the share price quadrupled.

First I will show how SCS repeatedly runs paid promotions on fraudulent companies which are then halted
and/or delisted.


Second I will show the documents which show that Aron Govil is paying SCS to promote Cemtrex, using an
undisclosed entity name.


And in the next section I will then show how Cemtrex insiders are secretly selling shares during the paid
promotion campaign, without disclosing the sales to investors.


Evidence of various paid promotions on Cemtrex along with the payments involved can be found at promotion
tracking sites such as Hotstocked.com (http://newsletter.hotstocked.com/stocks/view/CETX-Cemtrex-
Inc.)and Stock promoters.com (http://stockpromoters.com/View-Stock-Promotions-By-Symbol.aspx?
symbol=cetx&ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolderyy%24Footer1%24Image2.x=0&ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolderyy%2
But these sites typically only capture a fraction of the promotions under way.


As we can see from these sites, a well oiled stock promotion machine began aggressively pumping Cemtrex
through a wide variety of online channels. So far, over $1 million has been paid to stock promoters.


I include a partial screen shot showing various paid promotions on Cemtrex at the bottom of this
section, or just click the links above. Here are just a few of the examples. There are dozens and
dozens more, each of which tend to cost from $10,000 to $50,000 a pop.


I will demonstrate below that Aron Govil is behind Southern Steel & Construction which is
paying SCS. SCS has been responsible for numerous paid promotions on Cemtrex.

This aggressive paid promotion is what took the stock from below $1.70 to over $7.00 in 2016.


(For more details on the past frauds or promotions by SCS which were halted, delisted or imploded,
see Appendix A)


Aron Govil’s hidden paid promotion using SCS promoters


Here is just one example of an SCS promotion of Cemtrex (http://stockreads.com/Stock-Newsletter.aspx?
id=89162) which was paid for by an entity called “Southern Steel and Construction”. This promotion was dated
October 2016, but it notes that SCS had been covering Cemtrex for a full year prior.


We can see below that just two or three days coverage cost “Southern Steel” $30,000, which was paid
via bank wire.


(Note: This single payment to SCS for just 2-3 days of stock promotion is more than all the audit fees
paid to its auditor Bharat Parikh for the full year for any of the last 3 years !)

Good morning everyone, This week’s featured pro�le is one of our favorite small cap’s since our
initial coverage in October 2015. Cemtrex, Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX (http://stockreads.com/Stock-

going forward.

First o�….so New York’s corporate records for Southern Steel, which is paying for Cemtrex promotions by
SCS, lists only Aron Govil at the same address as Cemtrex.


And then second….Southern Steel’s entity status is listed as “inactive,” meaning that since August 2016 it
has engaged in little or no other business activity other than paying SCS to promote Cemtrex.


In fact, this information is a bit di�icult to �nd. By default, the NY State database only shows “active”
corporations. So when searching for this, one must opt to explicitly search for “all” corporations, both Active
and Inactive.


Again, this is just a single example of a paid SCS promotion.


(For a screenshot of additional Cemtrex promotions please look in Appendix B)


Point #2 – Cemtrex Insiders make undisclosed sales while pushing retail investors to buy


When a corporate insider makes sales of their own stock, this is very material information to outside
shareholders because presumably insiders know much more than the rest of us.


When an insider (management �gure, director, or 10% holder) makes an initial purchase, that insider
is REQUIRED to report the transaction on SEC Form 3.

https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 9/36


Subsequent transactions by such insiders (either buys or sells) are then REQUIRED to be reported on SEC
Form 4.


The Form 4’s are very important because they REQUIRE the insider to disclose:


· the date of transaction


· the number of shares transacted


· the share price received


Retail investors in Cemtrex have tried to remain con�dent under the assumption that management is holding
strong and not dumping shares.


Precisely during the time of the paid promotion campaign, and along with the soaring share price, the number
of shares held by Aron Govil, Saagar Govil and CFO Renato Dela Rama have all decreased signi�cantly. The
total decrease in their shares amounts to nearly 1 million shares, amounting to as much as $7 million in
proceeds in 2016. You can do the math yourself: During 2016, Cemtrex’s share price ranged from $1.65 to
$7.38.


Yet no form 4’s have been �led to disclose any share sales from any Cemtrex insiders whatsoever.
Here is a link to all of Cemtrex’s SEC �lings (https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?
action=getcompany&CIK=0001435064&type=&dateb=&owner=include&count=100).


It truly de�es all common sense that ALL members of managementhad their shareholdings decline
substantially while precisely NONE of them has �led a single Form 4 to disclose it.


For those who wish to double check for themselves, here are the reference SEC �lings.


Ducon Tech Form 4 �led 2015

The table below shows the number of shares held as of each of those dates. We can see that for each of
Ducon, Aron Govil, Saagar Govil and Renato Dela Rama, the number of shares has declined
substantially.For the directors, we do not know, because they never �led the required Form 3’s to disclose
their ownership.

Ducon Technologies


In November of 2015 (exactly when the paid promotion from SCS began), Ducon Technologies
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1435064/000114420415066269/xslF345X03/v424941_4.xml) disclos
a purchase of 65,732 shares at a price of $2.55 for a total amount of $167,617. As disclosed, this took
Ducon’s holding of Cemtrex common stock to a total of 433,219 shares. Ducon Technologies is controlled by
Aron Govil, who is behind the entity paying for the undisclosed stock promotion.


But according to the most recent Proxy �led in January of 2017, Aron Govil’s Ducon Technology now only has
102,951 shares. It therefore got rid of 330,268 shares during 2016. Because there were no Form 4’s �led, we
don’t know the dates or the amounts of any sales. But we can see that the share price ranged from below $2
to above $7 in 2016. Therefore, depending on when its shares were sold, Ducon Technology could have sold
up to $2.3 million.


Aron Govil


By comparing the Proxy’s issued in 2016 and then 2017, we can also see that shares held under Aron Govil’s
own name declined by 222,049 shares in 2016. Again, depending on when these were sold, they could have
been worth up to $1.8 million.


Saagar Govil


As we will see, Saagar Govil’s share holdings increased by 100,000 during 2016. But during the year he also
awarded himself 400,000 new shares via option grants, such that his position should have increased by
400,000. So clearly his net position actually declined by 300,000 shares.


For Saagar Govil, the 300,000 decline amounts to up to $2.1 million in 2016 assuming the sale of stock at
share prices up to $7.00.


In September 2016 (with the stock having just hit new highs for the year), Saagar Govil also purchased an
upscale condo in New York valued at precisely $2.25 million.


(The timing, the prices and the disclosure omissions around Saagar’s 400,000 option grants also leads me to
the question of if these were backdated to occur at arti�cially low prices. I will show the detailed
documentation of in a section below).

CFO Renato Dela Rama


Moving on, we can also see that the number of shares held by the CFO also declined by 19,833, again with
no Form 4’s being �led. Depending on when the sale was made, this would have a value of up to $138,831 (or
more than triple his reported salary).


The Directors


With directors Sunny Patel and Shamik Shah, we can see that both directors report owning a few thousand
shares worth up to $30,000-$40,000. But no initial Form 3’s were ever �led to disclose when they received
these shares or at what price. We also don’t know how many shares they initially received in total, such
that there may have been substantial selling here as well. Typically, new directors are awarded shares as of
the date they join the board. For both of these directors, that would have been the Spring of 2015. New
shareholdings by directors are ALWAYS required to be �led to the SEC, but NONE were ever �led by these
directors.


The use of Twitter, StockTwits and online message boards to promote Cemtrex


In my past articles I have exposed clearly how paid stock promoters will also in�ltrate online message
boards, social media (Twitter) and online �nancial blogs. They then pose as independent individuals who
rally the enthusiasm behind their promoted stocks. Once you know what to look for, these paid promoters
often become obvious online. They suddenly appear out of nowhere and begin aggressively cheering on a
certain stock. At some point (when the promotion is ending) they disappear just as quickly and this is when we
see the stock start falling apart.


In addition, all throughout the paid promotion campaign, both Aron Govil and Saagar Govil have been actively
cheerleading Cemtrex’s stock price on places like Twitter, encouraging retail investors to BUY BUY BUY.
Obviously, this is highly unusual for any executive of any publicly traded company. They are supposed to be
running a company, not sitting in front of their computers, Tweeting to promote the stock price. It also raises
the potential for Reg FD violations. This is why we almost never see CEOs publicly touting their own stock on
Twitter. SCROLL

Point #3 – Cemtrex’s defunct auditor gone missing, history of fraud


Up through 2014, Cemtrex was using a defunct auditor called Li & Co. But Li & Co. was shut down by the
PCAOB. During the investigation, Li & Co. simply refused to provide
(https://pcaobus.org/Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/105-2016-022-Li-Company.pdf) subpoenaed
information to the investigators. That defunct audit �rm is now listed as a “Prohibited Service Provider
(http://www.otcmarkets.com/research/service-provider/Li-&-Company-PC?id=1380)” and is no longer allowed
to provide audit services.


Following that, Cemtrex began using Bharat Parikh & Assoc as an auditor. Bharat Parikh is a small audit �rm
based in India, not the US, but with a supposed o�ice in the US for auditing US clients. Even in recent weeks
on Cemtrex’s just issued 10K �ling (http://www.secinfo.com/d1DY5f.wfRr.htm#1stPage), it continues to list
Bharat Parikh’s o�ice address in the US as 4940 McDermott Rd., Plano, TX.


Here is a screenshot of Bharat Parikh’s signature from Cemtrex’s form 10K �led with the SEC just a few
weeks ago, dated December 28, 2016.

In fact, this corresponds to a vacant strip mall o�ice in Dallas. Here are some photos of that vacant o�ice
space at 4940 McDermott Road. The photos were taken just a few days after that SEC �ling came out.

Clearly even though these o�ices appear to have been vacant for quite some time, Bharat Parikh
continues to claim to the SEC that he is running a team that is performing audits out of this o�ice.


In addition, the US phone number listed on the auditor’s website has been disconnected.


We now encounter a host of problems:


First, (obviously) the fact that Cemtrex’s auditor claims to be running a busy audit �rm out of a long-
since vacant building in a strip mall is troubling. Likewise, the disconnected phone number is equally
troubling.


Second, Texas State Board of Public Accountancy
(http://www.tsbpa.state.tx.us/php/fpl/spnlookup.php) has no record of Bharat Parikh even having
a license to provide audits for public companies. Click the link above to search the database. Enter in
any combination of Bharat+Parikh and / or BPA, etc. There is nothing.


Third, Bharat Parikh & Associates is actually controlled not by Mr. Parikh, but by Mahesh Thakkar who
holds a 51% stake in the auditor. Thakkar was banned by the SEC and the PCAOB
(https://www.aicpa.org/forthepublic/disciplinaryactions/2016/pages/thakkarmahesh.aspx) due to accepting
fees to provide fraudulent audits, and also for operating without a license to even provide audits at all.
At the time, he was running an audit �rm under a di�erent name (Thakkar CPA / The Hall Group). But it
was actually operated out of the same address (4940 McDermott), with the same group of personnel
auditing the same clients. It is no coincidence that past clients from that partner then ended up simply
switching over to the “new” �rm using the “new” name Bharat Parikh (i.e. Cemtrex’s auditor) out of
the same exact address. Thakkar has operated audit �rms using multiple names, changing the name

of the �rm each time he gets shut down. Various names used by Thakkar include: The Hall Group,
Thakkar CPA, and Bharat Parikh and several others. Most recently he has attempted to use the name
TMK LA (in which Mr. Bharat Parikh is listed as his partner).


Fourth, as we will see, Cemtrex pays this absentee auditor a mere $15,000-$20,000 in audit fees per
year, despite claiming revenues of nearly $100 million from operations which span 4 countries and 3
continents. As highlighted by CFO.com, smaller �rms tend to pay roughly $5,000 in audit fees per
million dollars of revenue. That should place Cemtrex at nearly $500,000 in expected audit fees (even
without sprawling international operations).


Here is how we know all of this.


If you look closely at the picture of 4940 McDermott, you can make out the glue outline of the words “Perfect
Tax and Finance“. Perfect Tax was founded and operated (http://www.perfecttax.com/�rmpro�le.php) by
Mahesh Thakkar, CPA and lists 4940 McDermott as its address. Thakkar partnered with Bharat Parikh out of
this same address, which is again the same address that continues to be listed for Bharat Parikh in Cemtrex’s
SEC �nancials even now.


Here we can see (https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2iups8/tmk-cpa-lp) that Bharat Parikh and Thakkar listed
as General Partners in an LP called “TMK LP” that claims to provide CPA services, again from 4940
McDermott Road.


We can also see below from the Texas Secretary of State that Thakkar was listed as the CONTROLLING
PARTNER in Bharat Parikh Associates, with a 51% stake and he uses the same address as Bharat Parikh,
both in India and the US. Once again, this is 4940 McDermott Rd.

HERE we can see where its registration was revoked by the PCAOB
(https://pcaobus.org/Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/105-2016-015-Hall.pdf).


We can see then that prior to taking control of Bharat Parikh, Thakkar had previously run his audit shop under
a di�erent name in Texas, again covering public companies. This �rm was Thakkar CPA d/b/a “The Hall
Group CPA’s”.


As with all of the other �rms listed here, of course Thakkar CPA’s operated out of 4940 McDermott
(http://www.tsbpa.state.tx.us/php/fpl/frmlookup.php?x=DkjQ4ZJAOR0%3D), the same vacant strip mall. (In the
link above, simply type in the �rm name of “Thakkar”).


Here we can see that Thakkar has now been o�icially suspendedfrom practicing accounting due to
various violations including “violating auditing standards“, “violation of rules of professional
conduct” and “lack of �tness to serve the public as a professional accountant”

In its previous incarnation, Thakkar had formed Thakkar CPA’s to perform public company audits. But he had
two problems. First, he had no PCAOB license to perform audits and second he had no clients.


As a result, he simply bought an existing audit �rm called “The Hall Group CPA’s” which had a number of
existing public company clients. Thakkar then began signing o� on audits for these clients. But according to
the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/34-77718.pdf), he never became registered with the
PCAOB, which is required for auditing public companies.

And here we can see where audit clients such as Pink Sheets traded Inolife
(http://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form+8-
K+INOLIFE+TECHNOLOGIES,+For%3A+Feb+20/10317344.html) simply switched over from the audit
�rm calling itself “Thakkar/Hall Group” to the one calling itself “Bharat Parikh” to complete their
audits by a supposedly “new �rm”operating out of the exact same address by the same group of
people.


According to the SEC complaint, there were actually a host of deep and concerning violations by
Thakkar/Hall. You can click below to read them all, but we will focus on just a few of them below.


According to the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2016/34-77718.pdf):


These proceedings arise out of Thakkar CPA, PLLC d/b/a The Hall Group CPAs (“Thakkar CPA” or
“successor �rm”) issuance of 15 public company audit reports while it was not registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). Thakkar CPA’s audit
reports misrepresented that the �rm was properly licensed and registered with the PCAOB
and falsely stated that it conducted audits in accordance with PCAOB standards.


The Hall Group, Hall, Helterbran, and Cisneros collectively failed to conduct at least 16 annual
audits and 35 quarterly reviews in accordance with PCAOB standards in at least three ways: (1)
they repeatedly failed to prepare adequate audit documentation in connection with audit and
review engagements; (2) failed to conduct – or failed to obtain – an engagement quality review
(“EQR”) of audit and review engagements by a quali�ed reviewer; and (3) on at least four
engagements, The Hall Group and Hall performed audit services while the �rm’s independence
was impaired. As a result, The Hall Group falsely stated that it conducted its audits in
accordance with PCAOB standards in at least 16 annual audit reports for eight issuers.
Additionally, Hall, after becoming CFO of DynaResource, Inc., allowed Thakkar CPA to provide audit
services to DynaResource, Inc. even though he knew he had a direct �nancial interest in and a
business relationship with the company’s external audit �rm.


So Bharat Parikh’s controlling partner / predecessor was banned because on 35 separate occasions it did
not prepare audit documentation, it did not have a partner even conducting audits and it falsely attested that
it had properly conducted audits.


Basically, Thakkar was getting paid small amounts of money to sign o� on these audits without really
doing any work at all !


In addition, the �rm signed o� on audits in a company with which it clearly had a direct �nancial interest and
was therefore not independent.


Here is why this matters. (And this should become quite obvious).


Cemtrex purports to generate revenues of nearly $100 million coming from 4 international subsidiaries
spanning 3 continents. Presumably this makes Cemtrex relatively complicated (and expensive) to audit. This
audit then gets even more expensive when the company needs to integrate ongoing acquisitions of totally
new businesses. Any realistic cost assessment of such audit work for any normal company could run as high
as $500,000-$1 million. Easily.


Yet in Cemtrex’s 10K we can see that paid it’s absentee Indian auditor a mere $20,000 to perform its
audit work in each of the last two years! And in the previous year, audit fees amounted to just $15,000.SCROLL

Even for a small company with operations in just a single city, no auditor can justify even preliminary work for
just $15,000-$20,000. For a company operating in 4 countries across 3 continents, this is just patently absurd.
And it seems very consistent with the history of Thakkar / Hall etc. signing o� on so-called “audits”
without actually doing any real work.


In my view, the $15,000-$20,000 looks like little more than a convenience payment for a rubber stamp
signature.


The situation on the inside of Cemtrex is no better. Cemtrex’s CFO is Renato Dela Rama. Presumably in this
role, he would be responsible for coordinating the audit with Bharat Parikh, if one were actually being done.


But in 2015, Cemtrex reported in SEC �lings (see below) that Dela Rama received zero compensation
(http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.w2dWx.htm#1stPage) for this role in 2014 as well as in 2015. In fact, on his
LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/renato-delarama-40aa9031/) Dela Rama does not even disclose
that he even works for Cemtrex at all. Instead, he only lists that he is the controller for Ducon Technologies,
which is run by Aron Govil.

So, lets get this straight: Cemtrex’s CFO doesn’t even report that he is the CFO of Cemtrex and for the
past several years, Cemtrex also discloses that he wasn’t even getting paid for that role.


In fact, he is actually getting paid by Aron Govil via Ducon. And Aron Govil is the guy who is using an
undisclosed entity to pay notorious stock promoters to �nance a touting campaign on Cemtrex.


Got it ?


In 2017, Cemtrex’s SEC disclosure suddenly contradicts its 2015 disclosure. The fact that a change was
made is never noted and certainly not explained. Years after the fact, Cemtrex began claiming that it had
actually paid Dela Rama $40,000 per year in each of those previous years.


In fact, the $40,000 number becomes even more troubling.

https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 20/36


Even at $40,000 this is exceptionally low pay for a CFO of a supposed multinational conglomerate. It is also
well below what he gets paid by Aron Govil at Ducon, where Dela Rama is not even CFO. No one would be
expected to devote full time attention to a multinational company for just $40,000 per year, especially not in
New York. My secretary in New York used to make over $60,000.


For reference, here we can see that average salaries
(http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010915/whats-average-salary-chief-�nancial-o�icer-cfo.asp) for
any full time CFO in the US was $315,947 as of December 2014 (about 8x what Dela Rama is supposedly
being paid, if he is being paid at all).


And to be clear, over $1 million has been paid to notorious stock promoting �rms to pump up the
share price while only $15,000-$20,000 has been paid to supposedly “audit” the �nancials for the
entire company. Meanwhile the CFO is only supposedly paid $40,000.


For the reasons above, I have precisely zero con�dence in the �nancials being reported by Cemtrex.
This will become especially clear below when we look at the spectacular performance which Cemtrex
has reported immediately after acquiring obscure foreign companies which are revealed to be entirely
insolvent just before being acquired by Cemtrex.


The Cemtrex �nancials signed o� on by Bharat Parikh and CFO Dela Rama have now shown 20
straight quarters of apparent pro�tability and soaring revenues. This “success” has then been widely
echoed and ampli�ed by the aggressive stock promoters being paid by Aron Govil through an
undisclosed entity. And this is exactly the formula which caused the stock to soar from below $2.00 to
over $7.00 in 2016.


Point #4 – The 3rd party service providers


Whenever I come across another paid stock promotion, I always, always, ALWAYS know exactly what I will
�nd next. Each of these companies relies on the same 3rd party service providers such as law �rms,
investment banks and “IR �rms“. The world of small cap stock promotion is basically a small country club
and all of these guys know each other.


With Cemtrex, we can see that the company has relied heavily upon Chardan Capital and Source Capital as
its bankers. For IR, Cemtrex uses Irth Communications. Each of these �rms will be detailed below. But it is
safe to say that there is very notable overlap between the client lists of all three �rms. They all work for
many of the same �rms and people. From there, we also see that they also service the exact same
companies which have been heavily promoted by the exact same stock promoters, including SCS,
listed above. In each case, these client companies have then repeatedly imploded or been halted or
delisted, due to fraud.


This raises two issues:


First, if the last 20 or so companies represented by these third parties generally skyrocketed due to excessive
promotions and then imploded, it seems like a safe assumption for any objective investor to suspect that
Cemtrex might do the same thing. This is just common sense.


Second, when this pattern of shareholder destruction is so obvious with their client lists, why on Earth would
any company ever select these 3rd parties to represent them (unless they simply had no alternatives,
because they too were nothing more than a blatant stock promotion). Again, this is just common sense.


Source Capital and Cemtrex’s recent rights o�ering


Cemtrex relied upon Source Capital Group (http://www.cemtrex.com/news/431-cemtrex-announces-
commencement-of-subscription-rights-o�ering-and-determination-of-warrant-exercise-price) to run its recent
rights o�ering which was completed a few weeks ago in January, raising $13 million.

In February, just days after the completion of Cemtrex’s rights o�ering, we saw the following headline:


Goodman & Nekvasil, P.A. won a FINRA arbitration award against Source Capital Group on Feb. 3
while working on behalf of three retirees, William B. Lashlee and Keith and Joyce A. McCrea. Lashlee
is an 88-year-old retired native of St. Simons Island, Georgia, and the McCreas are a retired couple
who live in Yorkville, Georgia.


Both groups alleged they were sold unregistered and unsuitable investments in IPG stock by Joseph
Hooper, who was working as a representative. Lashlee invested $220,000 and the McCreas invested
$590,000 for a combined total of $810,000 in IPG stock.


IPG quickly went bankrupt and Source was found to have been negligent.


As of last week (February 17th, 2017), we can see that Source Group had its FINRA
registrations terminated (https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_36719.pdf) in all states in which it
was operating. FINRA notes that Source Group ceased business operations in February 2017.

From Source’s website (http://www.sourcegrp.com/index.php/recent-transactions/) we can see that the �rm
has raised money for a number of other heavily promoted microcaps which then imploded. Like Chardan
below, this includes a number of tiny Chinese reverse mergers which were delisted (but only after they raised
substantial capital from US investors). SCROLL

https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 22/36


My regular readers will remember back when I previously exposed a massive stock promotion ring
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena) run by “The
Dream Team Group“, which also operated under the name of Mission IR. Dream Team / Mission IR had
recruited numerous authors to write extensive undisclosed paid promotions on dozens of micro cap stocks.
These authors would pretend that they were industry experts or hedge fund managers and would write
aggressive articles recommending the client stocks. These stocks then soared in price, allowing the
companies and their management to sell stock at in�ated prices. After my expose
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/2086173-behind-the-scenes-with-dream-team-cytrx-and-galena), each of the
implicated companies ended up plummeting by as much as 95%, and a number of civil suits and SEC
investigations ensued.


Dream Team / Mission IR were the architects behind a widespread ring of stock fraud and promotion. I
even produced the internal documentation to prove it.


Here we can see that Mission IR lists Source Capital as its “conference partner
(http://www.missionir.com/brokers.html)“. Here we can also see Mission IR promoting Source Capital’s
“Disruptive Growth Conference (http://sourcecapitalconference.missionir.com/)“.


Note that a number of the companies which attend Source’s investor conference
(http://sourcecapitalconference.missionir.com/) also happen to be banked by Chardan and/or are clients of Irth
Communications as well. These attendees of Source’s disruptive growth conference also happen to be
heavily promoted by the same promoters listed above, including our favorite, SCS. This is easy to see by
logging on to either Hotstocked.com or Stockpromoters.com.


At FINRA’s Broker Check website (https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_36719.pdf), we can also see
where Source was �ned by FINRA for having sold investments to investors “without disclosing material
facts” and sold investments by making “exaggerated promises in multiple emails” as well as selling
securities “at prices which were not fair“.


Either way, following the termination of its FINRA registration in all states, it appears that Source Capital is no
more.


Chardan Capital Markets


Cemtrex retained banker Chardan Capital Markets to run its S3 o�ering in 2016. Cemtrex was then forced to
withdraw the o�ering because Cemtrex did not meet the requirements as a result of failing to �le
required SEC documents .


Chardan and its management have a long history of run-ins with the SEC and FINRA. This includes various
reports of manipulating small cap stocks
(https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/marketregulation/NASDAQ/DisciplinaryActions/CHDN_NQ_2015.pdf), 
trading (http://4closurefraud.org/2010/07/27/did-david-j-stern-djsp-disclose-that-13-owner-kerry-s-propper-
was-the-subject-of-doj-investigation-and-sba-law-suit/) activity, failure to disclose various stock holdings and
transactions as well as defrauding (http://4closurefraud.org/2010/07/27/did-david-j-stern-djsp-disclose-that-13-
owner-kerry-s-propper-was-the-subject-of-doj-investigation-and-sba-law-suit/) the US Small Business
association out of $35 million. Chardan then launched into the Chinese Reverse Merger / SPAC game.
Geoinvesting subsequently highlighted no less than 17 di�erent examples
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/299068-17-reasons-not-to-take-chardans-wavering-opinion-on-zhongpin-
seriously) of Chardan Chinese reverse mergers/SPACs, the majority of which completely imploded following
exposure of or allegations of fraud.

Cemtrex’s IR �rm is Irth Communications. As with Source Group above, Irth is listed as an IR partner of
Mission IR (AKA the Dream Team Group) which was found to be behind a massive illegal stock promotion
ring.

As shown on its website (http://www.irthcommunications.com/services/media-stratagy), Irth has been
responsible for various aggressive media placement campaigns for its clients, getting the stocks and their
management strong favorable mentions in mainstream media outlets.


But as we can see below, many of these stocks are the same stocks that have been heavily promoted by the
promoters listed above, including our favorite, SCS. These stocks have then eventually imploded despite
tremendous positive coverage generated by Irth.


Many retail investors have been lured into buying Cemtrex stock solely as the result of seeing these
high pro�le, positive media placements on Cemtrex which have been entirely arranged on their behalf.


As for the glowing media coverage that has suddenly exploded upon Cemtrex and the Govils, this is
something that I have seen on many occasions.


For example, in January of 2011, China Media Express (formerly CCME) obtained the following headline from
none less than Forbes:


China MediaExpress Holdings, Inc. Ranked #1 in Forbes China List of Small-to-Medium Sized Chinese
Companies with the Greatest Potential
(https://article.wn.com/view/2011/01/12/China_MediaExpress_Holdings_Inc_Ranked_1_in_Forbes_China_Lis_


Just 60 days later, CCME was delisted when it was uncovered as an abject fraud. Thanks Forbes.


In the US, the micro cap Organovo shot up 3.5x from $4.00 to $14.00 following the publication of this article in
Popular Science, which was a full feature on that microcap stock �lled with hype and hyperbole.

How 3-D Printing Body Parts Will Revolutionize Medicine (http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-

Organovo subsequently fell from $14.00 to its current levels of $2-3 when it became apparent that the “3D
printing of body parts” was pure fantasy. Thanks Pop Sci. In these cases above, there is certainly no evidence
that this coverage was paid for. However, it has been my observation that anyone can obtain glowing media
coverage if enough money is paid to a PR/IR/Media agency. Given that millions of dollars have already been
paid to stock promoters, it should come as no surprise that aggressive media placements have proliferated
covering Cemtrex and the Govils. Irth was founded by brothers Andrew and Robert Haag. The Haag Brothers
had both previously worked for small cap investment bank Auerbach, Pollak & Richardson. Auerbach folded in
2001 after its securities registration was revoked following a variety of regulatory violations. In 2002, Andrew
Haag then went to work as CFO and director of microcap reverse merger Quintek Technologies, a former
Auerbach client. In 2002, Quintek’s CEO was sanctioned by the SEC for having put out a variety of false and
misleading press releases regarding phony purchasing orders, causing the stock to soar dramatically,
coincidently just as the company was looking to raise money. Haag stayed on with Quintek until 2008.
He notes that (https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-haag-2b65512/) as CFO, he “Raised $5 + million in capital,
Increased Valuation + Liquidity, Expanded Shareholder Base 10 fold, Responsible for Cash Management,
Responsible for Public Filings, Corporate Development”. But we can see that by 2008, the SEC was
already hounding Quintek (http://www.secinfo.com/dsDSs.ta.htm#1stPage) for putting out delayed �nancials
which contained material inaccuracies (ie. Just like Cemtrex). These �nancials then needed to be publicly
restated. As CFO, Hagg stated to the SEC (http://www.secinfo.com/dsDSs.ta.htm#1stPage) that he would be
retaining a PCAOB audit �rm to rectify the inaccuracies in the �nancials. But instead, the members
of management simply resigned (http://www.secinfo.com/dsDSs.u5d.htm#1stPage) and Quintek stopped
making further SEC �lings. Quintek just went dark leaving investors with nothing.


Following the implosion of Quintek, Haag and his brother then founded Hampton Growth Capital
(http://www.hamptongrowth.com/) which focused on “Investor Relations” and “Capital Formation“. Like
Chardan and Source above, Hampton placed a heavy focus on servicing Chinese reverse mergers, helping to
promote them so that they could raise money from US investors. By 2011, following the wave of fraud among
Chinese reverse mergers, Hampton’s Chinese reverse merger clients had been completely delisted. With
Hampton in disgrace, the Haag brothers then ceased using that name began using a new name, “Irth
Communications”, and promoting US based micro caps.


Below you can see the stock performances of some clients of Irth Communications. You can see that most of
these have imploded by as much as 90% from their highs following the promotion.


For those who wish to check on their own, you can see that most of these Irth clients happen to also have
been the subject of heavy paid promotion including via our favorite promoter group SCS. Checking this is
easy by simply going back to Hotstocked.com or Stockpromoters.com.

Point #5 – Financial and disclosure “irregularities” and inconsistencies


Given the state of Cemtrex’s auditors and bankers, seeing blatant errors, “irregularities”
and inconsistencies should come as no surprise. But as I have shown repeatedly in past articles, when we
see such repeated irregularities in a company’s SEC �nancials it generally presages an implosion in the share
price and/or a delisting of the stock.


Again, here is a link to all of Cemtrex’s SEC �lings (https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?
action=getcompany&CIK=0001435064&type=&dateb=&owner=include&count=100).


Anyone who has performed a detailed review of Cemtrex’s SEC �lings should know that Cemtrex tends to
play very fast and loose with its SEC reporting requirements.


The �lings that Cemtrex is required to make have been late, they have been inaccurate, there have
been blatant inconsistencies between various �lings that are never reconciled.


This includes even the most major �lings such as the annual 10K and the Proxy. Cemtrex originally �led its
previous 10K �ling in December of 2015. Almost 9 months later, it was still �ling amendments
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1435064/000114420416121189/v447525_10ka.htm) and correction
correct blatant errors in that �ling. The mistakes included very major items, such as the details of its liquidity
position, as well as many minor items such as various spelling and grammatical mistakes which should never
be found in a 10K.


The delayed and inaccurate �lings are the reason why Cemtrex was forced to cancel its S3 equity
o�ering in 2016, which was being run by Chardan Capital. Instead, Cemtrex was then forced to conduct a
much more lenient rights o�ering, which would then be run by Source Capital Group. Rights O�erings can be
completed even by those companies who become ineligible to do an S3 o�ering.

https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 26/36


Because of this negligence / omission in SEC �lings, Cemtrex was forced to disclose in the most recent 10K
that:


We did not timely �le with the SEC (NYSE:I (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/I)) our de�nitive proxy
statement, which includes the information required by Part III of Form 10-K, within 120 days of our
�scal year ended September 30, 2015, (ii) our Form 8-K in relation to our meeting of
shareholders held on March 7, 2016, or (NASDAQ:III (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/III)) several
other current reports �led during the preceding 12 calendar months. All of these reports were
ultimately �led, but their lateness caused us to become ineligible to use Form S-3, a shorter
registration statement that is often used for “shelf” registrations. If we are not able to �le our current
and periodic reports and other documents with the SEC in the future in the times speci�ed by the
Securities Exchange Act, we will continue to lose our eligibility to use Form S-3 for future capital
raises, and that could impair our ability to conduct more e�icient and expeditious public o�erings of our
stock o� of shelf registrations. Our inability to timely �le current and periodic reports in the future
could materially and adversely a�ect our �nancial condition and results of operations.


Examples


As we saw above, Cemtrex originally disclosed that it pays its CFO nothing. Later on, it quietly revises this
previous disclosure after the fact and without explanation. The new disclosure indicates that this CFO of a
$100 million revenue multinational is paid a mere $40,000.


And then next we saw how the number of shares of each and every member of management has declined
substantially over the past year (during a paid stock promotion), even though none of them �led a Form 4 to
disclose any sales.


So now let’s explore the issue of possible backdating of option grants by Saagar Govil, just before the
paid stock promotion campaign really took o�.


As we saw above, the bulk of the promoting campaign began in March of 2016.


In the 10Q released in May of 2016 Cemtrex discloses that:


On February 12, 2016, the Company granted a stock option to purchase 200,000 shares of Common
Stock to Saagar Govil, the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive O�icer, President and Secretary.
These options have an exercise price of $1.70 per share and expire after six years.


So, apparently by pure coincidence Saagar Govil happened to award himself 200,000 shares worth of options
on the exact day of the exact lowest closing share price over the past two years ! So either Mr. Govil was
preposterously lucky or else this looks a lot like options back dating. As we know, options backdating is quite
illegal, as noted here (https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/end-of-the-options-backdating-era/):


Because publicly traded corporations must properly report the value of options on their �nancial
statements, any backdating could result in a misstatement that can be the basis for a charge of
securities fraud.


This becomes more of an issue when we look at the quarterly �nancials that Cemtrex �led with the
SEC AFTER Feb 12, 2016.

7/5/2019 Short CETX. Documents and Photos, All Signs Point to Fraud - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 27/36


In that 10Q �led in May of 2016 (3 months AFTER the options had supposedly been awarded), Cemtrex
disclosed no change in “Share Based Compensation (http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.w343w.htm#1stPage)”
for the quarter despite the 200,000 options which had supposedly been granted to Govil in February. By the
time that quarter was reported, the share price had already risen by around 30%.


Upon receiving that options grant, Saagar would have been required to disclose it on Form 4. However, no
Form 4’s were �led in all of 2016.


The second grant to Govil is just as curious. In the most recent 10Q �led with the SEC in February 2017,
Cemtrex disclosed that it had awarded another 200,000 shares of options to Saagar Govil. It had noted that
the options were granted on December 5th 2016, at a price of $4.25 per share.


Looking back from February 14th, 2017, we can see that again the week of December 5th again
corresponded to the lowest closes for the stock over the preceding 3 months. Once again, Mr. Govil had
impeccable timing.


What gets really curious again is the fact that when Cemtrex released the 10K on December 28th
(i.e. AFTER the supposed options grant had already been given) the company only disclosed the earlier 2016
option grant and not the new one, supposedly made on December 5th. Again in January 2017, Cemtrex
released its Proxy Statement. And again, the company only disclosed the earlier February stock grant to
Govil. No mention was made of the December 5th options grant.


And just as in the past, Saagar Govil never �led the REQUIRED Form 4 to disclose the new shares given to
him.


In January, the stock really took o�. By the time Cemtrex disclosed the new options grant to Govil, the share
price had repeatedly broke through new highs north of $7.00 and had brie�y exceeded $8.00, such that
backdating the options just before releasing the 10Q could have resulted in as much as $800,000 in instant
pro�ts for Saagar.


These discrepancies are particularly notable given what we have seen with the auditor and the CFO.


Cemtrex directors


Separately, we can also see that Cemtrex’s outside board members consist of Shamik Shah and Sunny Patel.
Both of these individuals are young hedge fund traders who focus on trading stocks, futures and/or
derivatives. They show no experience in anything related to running a public company, engineering or
environmental controls or accounting issues. They have no business being directors of Cemtrex, aside from
potentially around issues regarding trading the stock.


Just like Saagar Govil, we can see that 30 year old Shamik Shah (https://www.linkedin.com/in/shamik-shah-
092b5751/) went to school in New York and graduated with his undergrad degree at exactly the same time
as Saagr Govil in 2008.


Diretor Sunny Patel (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-patel-cfa-3823997/) is also now 30 years old also
graduated from the same school in New York in 2008 and also worked as a derivatives trader with a hedge
fund.


Just like Saagar Govil, these two were brought on as directors for Cemtrex despite having no relevant work
experience.


Both Shah and Patel were appointed as directors in April and May of 2015. That happened to be precisely
when Cemtrex was applying to uplist (http://www.cemtrex.com/news/371-cemtrex-announces-reverse-stock-

https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 28/36


that process, the company is required to have outside board members, which is why Cemtrex appointed these
two then 28 year olds with no relevant experience those roles. By ful�lling this simple requirement, Cemtrex
was then able to uplist to the NASDAQ just a few weeks later.


Either way, as directors of a public company, these individuals are presumably now fully on the hook for any
potential issues which may arise from any potential undisclosed paid stock promotion, auditor
misrepresentations and/or selection issues, �nancial statement irregularities, back dating of options and etc.


HERE IS THE CONCLUSION !!


Based on the information laid out above, I believe the following:


I believe that it is highly likely that Cemtrex will face delisting and go to e�ectively zero.


Cemtrex management is paying for an undisclosed stock promotion via an undisclosed entity called Southern
Steel & Construction. Aron Govil is behind Southern Steel & Construction, and that entity reports the same
address as Cemtrex.


The promoters being paid include SCS, whose past promotions have imploded, been halted or delisted,
including due to fraud.


During this undisclosed paid promotion, the Govil’s have actively encouraged investors to buy Cemtrex shares
via social media. At the same time, members of management have been making large sales of stock without
disclosing those sales on Form 4 as required by the SEC.


Cemtrex’s auditor (Bharat Parikh & Assoc.) is actually controlled by an individual (Mahesh Thakkar) who has
been banned by the SEC and PCAOB as a result of multiple past audits, sign o�’s or reviews which were
fraudulent. Cemtrex’s auditor continues to report to the SEC that it is running its operations out of 4940
McDermott Rd., Plano, TX. Yet that location is actually a completely vacant strip mall. The phone number has
been disconnected. According to Texas State records, the auditor is not even licensed to practice in Texas.
Thakkar has run multiple di�erent audit operations out of 4940 McDermott under various di�erent names
(including Thakkar CPA, The Hall Group CPA, TMK LP and now Bharat Parikh). Each one of the previous
ones has been shut down. Thakkar then changes the name of the �rm and keeps auditing the same clients,
all from the same vacant address.


Cemtrex claims to generate nearly $100 million in revenues from subsidiaries across 4 countries and 3
continents. Such a company would normally expect $500,000-$1 million in audit fees per year. Yet Cemtrex
pays Bharat Parikh a mere $15,000-$20,000 per year.


Cemtrex’s 3rd party service providers include Source Capital, Chardan Capital and Irth Communications.
Each of these parties has a long and noticeable history of doing business with small cap stock promotions
which have been promoted by SCS or the other promoters behind Cemtrex. There have also been past
involvements with companies, individuals or activities with have involved imploded stock promotions or
securities fraud.


Cemtrex’s �lings repeatedly contain information which is either inaccurate or inconsistent between �lings.
Many �lings comes extremely late. Many required �lings have not come at all. It is clear that shares owned by
members of management have declined substantially during the course of the paid promotion. Yet no Form
4’s have been �led to disclose sales to investors or the SEC. Past disclosure states that the CFO was working
for years at zero salary from Cemtrex, while he was being paid by Aron Govil’s Ducon. Option grants to
Saagar Govil occurred at times when the share price was hitting deep lows. These grants were not disclosed
until after the share price had appreciated substantially. Earlier �lings, which should have disclosed the impact
of those new shares under the option grant, made no mention of the options until much later, after the share
price had already risen.

Again, to me the case for fraud and delisting seems obvious.


Appendix A – past frauds or promotions by SCS which were halted, delisted or imploded


SCS clearly matches the exact type of promoter that the SEC is warning us about in terms of “microcap fraud”
because numerous promotions from SCS end up getting quickly halted or delisted by the SEC.
Examples of halted or delisted stocks from SCS have included:


– Code Rebel (formerly CDRB)


– Force�eld Energy (formerly FNRG)


– Grow Life (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2014/34-71924.pdf)


– Fusion Pharm (https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?
tab=mm#search/matthewpatrickgravitt%40gmail.com/159f446948ef20b8?projector=1)


– Petrotech Oil and Gas (http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PTOG/quote)


– Among others…


Just like Cemtrex, each of these stocks surged by hundreds of percent following aggressive promotion
campaigns by SCS promoters. Just like Cemtrex, each of these stock promotions had a very well crafted
investment story speci�cally designed to lure in retail investors.


Each of these stocks were then halted or delisted outright when the SEC found �nancial irregularities or
outright fraud.


So again, these are the exact promoters that Aron Govil is paying using an undisclosed entity in New
York.


Both Hotstocked.com and Stockpromoters.com continue to list the paid promotions of these stocks which
were run by SCS.


Just like Cemtrex, Code Rebel was being promoted by SCS (https://www.goodetrades.com/2016/05/code-
rebel-cdrb-sec-suspension-only-2nd-ever-sec-suspension-of-listed-stock/) as an acquisition play. Paid
promotion and press releases around the acquisition hype caused the stock to surge by several hundred
percent shortly before it was delisted and went to zero.


Just days after the latest SCS promotion, The SEC noted
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2016/34-77774.pdf) that it had suspended trading in Code Rebel:


because of questions regarding the accuracy of statements in CDRB’s Forms 10-Q for the quarters
ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, and the Form 10-K for the year ending
December31,2015, concerning the company’s assets and �nancial condition. This order was entered
pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).


Similar promotion e�orts by SCS (http://smallcapir.com/important-message-from-the-team-and-updates-on-all-
2015-picks/) caused Force�eld Energy to soar by hundreds of percent. In the case of Force�eld, the stock
quickly fell by 60% immediately after my own article exposing the fraud. In fact, within just a few days of
my article exposing the fraud, the stock was halted by the SEC and then delisted. It was a zero within just
days.


At the time, the SEC noted that (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2015/34-74770.pdf) it was
suspending trading at Force�eld: SCROLL

7/5/2019 Short CETX. Documents and Photos, All Signs Point to Fraud - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 30/36


due to concerns about the adequacy and accuracy of information available to investors concerning the
funding of recent articles and promotions touting FNRG, including for example in articles published on
December 9, 2014 and February 26, 2015. Questions have also arisen concerning potential
manipulative activity of FNRG’s stock, including transactions between February 25 and April 2, 2015
and the funding of those transactions. This order was entered pursuant to Section 12(k) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).


For reference, here is my previous article on Force�eld, which I published when the stock was at $7.50 – just
a few days before that suspension from the SEC.


Appendix B – Additional Cemtrex promotions


Here is a partial screenshot showing just a few of the recent promotions, click the links above to see dozens
and dozens more. I encourage interested readers to go to Hotstocked.com or Stockpromoters.com to read
more examples.

7/5/2019 Short CETX. Documents and Photos, All Signs Point to Fraud - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/cetx/ 31/36


(https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/2017/2/22/4238561-14877648094985936_origin.png)


These sites show that the promoters and payors behind Cemtrex include:


– Broad Street Alerts, Small Cap IR, and Small Cap Street (under the umbrella of Small Cap Specialists
(“SCS”)


– Third Coast Media


– TSX Ventures


– Stock Market Leader


– Micro Cap Research


– Small Cap Leader


– Southern Steel & Construction


Despite the warnings from the SEC, there seems to be a never-ending stream of new retail investors who
continue to fall for the well-constructed schemes of stock promoters. And aside from those stocks that have
been halted and delisted, these promoters have been behind dozens of additional stock schemes which
simply imploded to the pennies without ever being formally halted or delisted.


Appendix C – Looking at the short interest


The Govil’s have repeatedly made it a point to blame “the shorts” for any weakness in the share price and
for any criticism that comes to their company or management. This is a very common diversionary tactic with
stock promotions. Unfortunately, many naïve retail investors continue to fall for it.


But with Cemtrex, the math simply doesn’t add up. As of January 31st, there were only around 400,000
shares (http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cetx/short-interest) sold short, amounting to just over $2 million in
total. This is virtually nothing. Cemtrex typically trades around 500,000 shares every day.

The short interest has also been steady at 100,000-400,000 shares for the past 6 months, such that there has
been very little increase relative to the volume. Every share sold short could easily be covered within 1-2
trading days while having minimal impact on the share price. Likewise, the entire short interest of 400,000
shares would have minimal e�ect of Cemtrex’s share price over this time.


Here is the link to the NASDAQ showing short interest as well as a screen shot for your convenience. Note
that the “days to cover” indicates that the entire short interest could be covered in a single day’s trading.

SCS’s promotion of fraudulent Force�led Energy was just the same. Despite a very low short interest,
Force�eld tried to distract retail investors by blaming its problems on evil short sellers. But this diversionary
tactic from management didn’t slow the immediate 60% plunge in the share price of Force�eld.
Clearly inside share holders were the ones selling big even as they were trying to persuade retail
shareholders not to sell or to even buy more. But this would only be revealed once the subsequent criminal
indictments came out against Force�eld Management.


For your reference, here is a press release
(http://www.force�eldenergy.com/ForceField%20Energy%20PR%20%2004%2017%202015%20Final.pdf) put
out by Force�eld Energy just after my article in which the Chairman accuses “the shorts” of disseminating
false and misleading information. He also claims that he was initiating a regulatory investigation with the SEC
to supposedly pursue “the shorts” in defense of his shareholders.


Instead, the Chairman was doing no such thing. Right as he was issuing press releases to reassure retail
holders, he was actually in the process of attempting to �ee the country while he was simultaneously dumping
his shares. Within just days, he was arrested (https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chairman-board-force�eld-
energy-inc-arrested-securities-fraud-conspiracy) by the FBI as he attempted to board a �ight to Central
America. Force�eld’s stock was halted, going quickly to zero. The Justice Department
(https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/nine-individuals-including-�ve-registered-brokers-indicted-orchestrating-
131-million) later announced that 9 individuals were arrested and indicted on massive securities fraud charges
behind the promotion of Force�eld.


I have frequently come across many similar examples of stock promotions who try to distract retail investors
by diverting attention to “the shorts”. They all typically tend to end the exact same way (with a trading halt, a
delisting or a simply share price implosion).
