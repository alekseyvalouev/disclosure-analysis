Implications Of Organovo Lawsuit

I last wrote about Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) on July 24th. Since my last
article, there have been several new developments, which further reinforce the short
thesis on the stock. The stock has continued to fall as expected.


First, the S3 registration statement for up to $100 million of new shares and/or warrants
has now become effective. Some individuals had previously taken comfort that no offering
would be impending because the S3 was not yet effective. It is now the case that
Organovo is free to issue up to $100 million of equity securities at any time.


Second, I have uncovered an undisclosed legal action against Organovo by their own
investment banker, Spencer Trask Ventures ("STV"). The initial arbitration filing was
submitted on June 27th, when STV demanded compensation, which is now valued at
around $28 million. Under the terms of the original Placement Agency Agreement,
Organovo had agreed to binding arbitration. However, on June 28th, Organovo filed in
New York Civil Supreme Court to attempt to fight the arbitration.


There have now been a flurry of arguments and counter arguments in New York Civil
Supreme Court during the months of June and July.


One issue is that this may prove to be a significant financial issue for Organovo. But as a
totally separate issue, this is already a significant disclosure problem for Organovo
investors.


None of this has been disclosed to investors, including in the S3 registration statement,
which just became effective a few days ago.


Preliminary points


Before getting into these issues, there are a few preliminary points that deserve to be
made.


Following my article, Seeking Alpha contributor Jason Napodano wrote a forceful rebuttal
to my article. It was his 4th bullish article on Organovo in less than 1 year.

In his article, Mr. Napodano makes it clear that the points in my article are either entirely
irrelevant or else downright inaccurate. The author supports these statements with a mix
of facts, opinions and anonymous postings from a Yahoo message board.


There are now three main issues, which investors need to resolve for themselves.


1. How much (if any) of the 32 million share overhang is currently depressing the share
price?


2. How much (if any) equity is Organovo likely to issue under the recent S3 registration
statement?


3. How much (if any) revenue is Organovo likely to generate in the next 1, 5 and 10
years?


Clearly, I disagree with Mr. Napodano on each of these points.


A substantial overhang pressing on the share price from the 32 million shares from 2012
is evidenced by the fact that Organovo still filed a subsequent prospectus on these
shares. Once the overhang is fully removed, there will not be additional prospectuses.


Organovo is likely to complete a very large financing under the $100 million S3 sooner
rather than later. It has been less than one year since the company deliberately reduced
the exercise price of the existing $1.00 warrants to just 80 cents in order to get money in
the door at that price. We can also see from the STV lawsuit that Organovo tried to
incentivize STV to exercise by reducing the strike price to just 60 cents. This means that
Organovo was attempting to issue new shares at a price of just 60 cents as recently as
February / March.


For revenue, Organovo may have some prospects with liver cell modules at sometime in
2014. But we have been given no indication of the certainty or the amounts, which may be
involved. The key point here is that the hype surrounding Organovo is in connection with
the 3D printing of human organs. Not even the most bullish authors expect to see
manufactured human organ revenues any time in the foreseeable future. Instead, we will
continue to see small amounts of revenue from grants and research collaborations.
Historically these have typically been in the range of six figure amounts.


In the meantime, we can see that Organovo has been successful in two areas:


- selling stock to investors at $1.00 (or below)


- elevating its share price to above $6.00

The company has recently been sporting a fully diluted market cap of nearly half a billion
dollars, despite the following financial metrics:


- lifetime revenues of just a few million dollars (coming from grants and research)


- non cash assets (including all intellectual property) of less than $2 million


Metrics like these do not justify a market cap anywhere near half a billion dollars.


A very small but vocal minority of readers continues to post their emotional comments
below these articles. However, a much larger (and silent) majority chooses to express
their views by selling their stock rather than typing up rabid comments.


Prior to my article, the stock was hitting $7.70 in pre-market trading. Following my article
the stock fell to $6.50.


It is now the case that all investors have the benefit of full information from these various
articles and comments and the share price continues to slide rather than recover any lost
ground. Following his article on Organovo, Mr. Napodano left a subsequent comment
stating that he believes that "fair value" for the stock is around $4.00-5.00 - an additional
decline of as much as 20% from the current level. In the near term, I would agree with this
statement, which is why I continue to be short the stock. Although any potential equity
offering could potentially push the share price even lower.


An undisclosed legal action


In its past financings, Organovo used the services of Spencer Trask Ventures for raising
what now totals roughly $28 million in proceeds from stock and warrants. As of March,
Organovo had $15 million in cash remaining.


The lead individual involved was Adam K Stern, a Managing Director with STV. Mr. Stern
also became a Director of Organovo.


According to the terms of the Private Placement Agreement, Organovo would pay to STV
a cash fee equal to 10% of the proceeds along with "agent warrants" ($1.00 strike price, 5-
year maturity) equal to 20% of the stock issuable to investors. There was also an 18-
month "tail" provision allowing for additional fees to be payable to STV based on
subsequent capital raises. A key point of contention in the current lawsuit is that it was
agreed that STV would be appointed as an exclusive Warrant Solicitation Agent at least
20 days prior to any notice of redemption. Organovo agreed to not contact any of the
investors introduced on STV's proprietary investor list.

In 2012, Organovo Director Stern left Spencer Trask and went to Aegis Capital. Shortly
thereafter, the arbitration suit states that Organovo began the warrant solicitation to raise
new money from STV customers. But instead of using (or even notifying) STV, Organovo
used Mr. Stern's new firm, Aegis.


In total, Organovo raised $14.8 million through the warrant exercises. In fact, Organovo
lowered the exercise price on warrants to just 80 cents in order to raise new money at that
level.


STV did not find out about any of this until it became public information through Organovo
filings.


STV and Organovo are now in a protracted legal battle in which STV is demanding the
disgorgement (and payment) of $14.8 million along with $1.3 million in cash fees and the
issuance of 2.9 million warrants owed. The warrants alone would currently be worth
around $12 million. Total consideration is therefore now in the area of $28 million.


During 2013, and after the warrant transactions conducted via Aegis, Organovo and STV
began negotiating a Warrant Agreement, which would arrange for payment of
compensation to STV. A second draft of the Warrant Agreement was also provided.


On March 1st, Spencer Trask's attorneys sent an email to Organovo CEO Keith Murphy
rescinding the proposed agreement. A copy of the rescind email can be found here.


Following the rescinding, Organovo still sent small payments to STV, however these
payments totaled just $115,000, instead of the much larger sum demanded by STV.


Section 13 of the Placement Agency Agreement states (in ALL CAPS) that any "dispute,
claim or controversy" which arises with respect to this agreement will be submitted to
Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") in the State of New York.


STV filed for arbitration on June 27th.


The next day, on June 28th, Organovo filed to fight the move for arbitration, stating that
the Warrant Solicitation Agreement voided both the compensation earned by STV as well
as the need for arbitration.


As is often the case, many dirty secrets get spilled out in lawsuits. Organovo reveals that it
had already agreed to pay to STV $23 million in exchange for helping Organovo raise just
$15 million in proceeds. The need to pay such a fee is staggering in and of itself.

The lawsuits also reveal that Organovo was willing to lower the strike price on STV's
warrants to just 60 cents, in order to raise equity at that level. This was not in the distant
past. This was in February / March.


Both of these facts speak loudly to the fact that Organovo has always been eager to issue
equity at just about any price, no matter how low. The company has virtually no non-cash
assets and continues to generate only minimal and non-commercial revenues. So getting
money at any price may well be the best strategy.


But it also reconfirms my suspicion that if the company is eager to issue substantial equity
for just pennies, then it will likely be a very large issuer of equity with the price sitting at
just over $5.00. A normal discount for an equity offering like this would be around 20%,
meaning that an offering would likely take place at around $4.00. One would also expect
heavy warrant coverage once again. The stock price would then react accordingly.


Investors now need to ask themselves two very important questions:


First, how much of the $28 million in demanded compensation will Organovo end
up paying to Spencer Trask ?


Second, why are investors hearing about a potential $28 million legal liability from
me, rather than from Organovo in an 8K or S3 legal disclosure ?


Reverse mergers in perspective


Commercializing a new product or service in the real world is an arduous and time-
consuming task. Successes are rare and often take decades to make themselves evident.


Reverse merger stock promotions, in sharp contrast, are far easier. It is very simple to
achieve 8 and 9 figure fortunes in the space of just a year or two.


Step one is to acquire the busted shell of a defunct company. Step two is to complete a
reverse merger and inject some token amount of assets. Step three is to change the
name. Step four is to heavily promote the story.


A few years ago, when China was hot, it was possible to create $500 million dollars by
simply creating a reverse merger with the "China" in the name. Hundreds of these
companies were uplisted to the NYSE and NASDAQ. Before that, when solar was hot,
there were numerous half billion-dollar companies created just by having some hint of a

solar business. Prior to that adding ".com" to a company's name would often create similar
valuations for reverse mergers. But in the end, when these companies failed to produce
profits, we saw them ultimately plunge to the pennies.


As noted in "Get Rich or Die Tryin'," there are two kinds of investors in these promotions.
The "Get Rich" crowd gets in early at very low prices.


It is important to note that the Get Rich crowd has no intention of waiting for the product
to be an ultimate commercial success. Instead, they cash out when the promotion of the
stock and the story hits a peak.


Many authors (such as Mr. Napodano) have clearly expressed their views that the early
investors in Organovo have already sold their stock - well before any commercial
success is even close. They had no intention of waiting around for real world success
because they were simply playing a stock promotion - not a product.


I agree that these investors will sell well before commercialization. But I also believe that
they would be smart enough to wait for the price and liquidity, which is provided by the
uplisting. This is why I believe that they are selling now.


Early investors cannot sell unless someone else is doing the buying. Likewise, investors
who buy these stocks should be aware that every time they buy, it is the result of someone
else being eager to sell. This is where the Die Tryin' crowd comes in.


It is well known that institutions tend to steer clear of reverse merger promotions. As a
result, reverse mergers rely heavily on promotion to retail investors.


For example, Organovo has made ample use of a service called
RetailInvestorConferences.com.


Retail investors can often take comfort from various sources of "validation" which may not
be appropriate.


For example, some investors believe that an uplisting to the NASDAQ or the NYSE is
reflective of some sort of judgment on the investment merits of a stock. This is quite
clearly not the case.


In recent years, there were hundreds of Chinese reverse mergers which uplisted to the
NYSE and the NASDAQ. It was ultimately uncovered that many of these companies were
empty shell frauds with virtually no assets or employees. Most of these companies were

delisted to the pink sheets just as quickly. Taking any confidence from the uplisting was
clearly a mistake.


The only point I am trying to make is that an uplisting will improve liquidity, but does not
have any implication for the investment merits of a company. Note: I am not making any
suggestion that Organovo is a fraud.


Likewise, many investors assume that obtaining a research grant is also validation of the
long-term potential of a company. Sometimes this can be the case. But we can also see
that the list of non-productive research grants is very long and very large.


Examples include a $3 million federal grant to study the game World of Warcraft and a
$2.6 million program to teach Chinese prostitutes to drink responsibly.


My point is not to suggest that Organovo's grants are without merit. Instead, my point is to
suggest that obtaining a few million in grant money is a very common occurrence for many
creative ventures in the US.


So far, Organovo has not achieved any meaningful degree of commercial success. But the
stock promotion has been extremely successful.


Despite minimal assets and revenues, the company has been able to briefly exceed half a
billion dollars in market cap. The recent rise briefly put the value of CEO Keith Murphy's
stock at nearly $40 million in a very short time since coming public.


Fortunes like this often take decades to achieve when one is dependent upon the actual
commercial success of a product. But with reverse merger stocks, they often take just a
year or two.


Ultimately, Organovo may end up being the reverse merger that transforms the nature of
medicine as we know it. If so, it will end up being worth many billions of dollars.


On the other hand, if Organovo fails, someone will come along, acquire the defunct shell
and start over with a new billion-dollar reverse merger idea. The name will be changed
and so on.


Fortunately we are all able to come to our own investment conclusions with respect to
these divergent potential outcomes and we are all able to act accordingly.


I am short Organovo.
