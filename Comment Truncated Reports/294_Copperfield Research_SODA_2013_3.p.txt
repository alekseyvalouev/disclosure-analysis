SodaStream
(SODA) - Sorry
SodaStream
Traders, Pepsi
ALREADY Has A
Partner
Feb. 7, 2014 1:16 PM ET12 comments | Includes: SodaStreâ€¦


In the wake of Coke's (NYSE:KO) notable endorsement of Green Mountain
(NASDAQ:GMCR) as the in-home vending machine of the future, SodaStream's
stock has jumped by 20% from its after hour lows Tuesday night. As is
typically the case, investors/traders have shot first with the prudent questions
and facts to follow later. This actually includes other short sellers whom we
have a great level of respect for that are simply off the mark believing it is a
fait accompli that Pepsi will partner with SODA. The linear assumption Pepsi
must partner with somebody or risk falling behind in the home soft drink
market is somewhat correct. While we certainly cannot rule out that Pepsi will
partner with SodaStream, we believe anybody that has bought, or promoted,
SODA stock in the last 48 hours has missed a critical fact that we have not
seen in any sellside reports thus far. PEPSICO ALREADY HAS A PARTNER
IN THE HOME BEVERAGE MARKET.


It has come to our attention that Pepsi has quietly partnered with the
European multi-drink in-home company Bevyz.

It is somewhat understandable how investors have missed Pepsi's choice of
partners, Bevyz is after all private and European, a combo that can often fall
off the radar of most stock market speculators. And if you are buying SODA,
you are speculating. The Bevyz dispensers (4 different models in total) provide
cold drinks, hot drinks, as well as still and SPARKLING filtered water. Like the
future Green Mountain Cold system, Bevyz uses a patented packaging
technology that creates a consistent consumer experience. How committed is
Pepsi to Bevyz? They have already made several of their most important
brands available on the Bevyz system, including Pepsi, 7 UP, and Lipton Ice
Tea. We would expect much more visibility into this partnership as Bevyz
begins to commercialize their machines domestically.

We cannot rule out the possibility that Pepsi will partner with more than one
machine manufacturer. It would not seem logical that Pepsi and Coke will
ultimately view in-home dispensers agnostically, the same way they view
vending machines. They would still compete viciously for consumer mindshare,
but the likelihood of consumers having separate dispensers for separate
brands seems completely unreasonable. Green Mountain's CEO, Brian Kelley,
seemed to understand this obvious dilemma and his remarks suggest there is
a high probability Pepsi partners with Green Mountain as well. On its earnings
call from February 5th, Brian Kelley was asked about Coke exclusivity, "So to
me that tells me that they're [Coke] being exclusive to you, but you can sign
on other brands. Is that the right way to think about it?" To this question
Kelley seemed to unequivocally state Pepsi is in the works as well, "It is
[exclusive]. Although, we're going to bring on the best brands. There are
many, many cold brands in North America and in the system. And obviously,
we can't bring on every brand at once. We want to bring on the biggest and
the best brands, and that'll take a little bit of time as we cycle through it. But
what you stated is accurate. And that's the way the platform has worked in
hot. And that's the way the platform will work in cold. And it's because that's
what the consumer wants." As a reminder in hot, Starbucks, Peets, as well as
Dunkin Donuts sell K-Cups for Keurig, despite vicious competition among
brands.


While it appears to us that Green Mountain is aiming to serve all beverage
brands with the vending machine analogy, it would also seem SodaStream has
further removed any possibility of relevance with Coke and Pepsi. SodaStream
has proudly taken every opportunity to incessantly insult and alienate the two
beverage giants. Its own website explicitly antagonizes Coke and Pepsi with
the slogan "Sorry, Coke and Pepsi." This was also a jab that was used in their
unedited Super Bowl add which can be found on YouTube. Really, Scarlet
Johanssen and a Super Bowl commercial? Levying insults and attacking Pepsi's
business model would clearly be an odd way to treat a potential partner.
Finally, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out yesterday in an article titled,
"Secret to homemade Coke: Instant Cold, No Canisters", Coke is adamant that
the key to the home market will be a system that is easy - meaning no
dangerous and clumsy CO2 canisters.
