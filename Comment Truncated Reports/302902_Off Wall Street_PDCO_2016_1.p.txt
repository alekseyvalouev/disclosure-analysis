1. PDCO appears to be losing share to HSIC in its high margin Dental business (46% of 
revenue/71% of segment operating profit).  Expectations for a reacceleration in Dental revenue 
growth are unlikely to be met.  
2. PDCO appears to be losing share to HSIC in its Animal Health business (53% of revenue/29% 
of segment operating profit).  Share losses have been masked by an acquisition that has now 
lapped.  Expectations for mid-single digit organic growth are unlikely to be met.  
3.  Capitalization of software expenses in F2015 and F2016 improved operating margins.  
Recognition of costs associated with the ERP rollout, beginning in F2017, reduce operating 
margins for several years. 
 
Summary:   Patterson Companies (PDCO) is a distributor of consumables and 
equipment to dental practices in the US and Canada, and to veterinary practices in 
the US, Canada, and the UK.  In F2016, 46% of revenue and 71% of segment 
operating profit came from its Dental segment, and 53% of revenue and 29% of 
segment profit came from its Animal Health (veterinary) segment.  Corporate 
revenue (equipment financing and other miscellaneous sales) was 1% of revenue in 
F2106.  About 80% of PDCO sales come from the US, and 20% are international 
(UK, Canada). 
 


PDCO has been rolling up dental distributors for decades, increasing its 
share of the North American market from 12% in 1987 to 33% in 2015. 
Competitor Henry Schein (HSIC) has also pursued a roll-up strategy, and now has 
about 40% of the market, with most of the remaining 27% of the market 
concentrated in three privately held distributors, Benco with 10%, Burkhart, and 
Darby.  With 83% of the dental market controlled by PDCO, HSIC and Benco, 
antitrust concerns make further acquisitions by PDCO in the US dental distribution 
space unlikely.  


 
PDCO entered the North American companion animal (i.e., household pet) 


veterinary distribution market in 2001 with its acquisition of J.A. Webster (11% 
market share).  Additional acquisitions have increased its share of the companion 
animal market to 25% in 2015. Its August 2013 acquisition of National Veterinary 
Services (NVS) gave it a 40% share of the UK companion/production animal (i.e., 
swine, cattle) market, and its June 2015 acquisition of Animal Health International 
gave it a 40% share of the North American production animal market.  HSIC has a 
35% share of the North American companion animal market and negligible share 
of the production animal market, while MWI (now owned by Amerisource Bergen) 
has a 25% share of the companion animal market and about 40% of the production 
animal market.  With 85% of the North American companion animal market and 
80% of the North American production animal market now tied up by PDCO, 
HSIC and ABC, anti-trust concerns again limit opportunities for further growth by 
acquisition.
3 


Low organic growth in the veterinary segment in F2016 has been masked by 
PDCO’s $1.1B acquisition of AHI in June 2015.  In addition, in early C2016, 
Zoetis shifted some drug sales to distributors rather than selling direct, creating a 
revenue bump that will begin to lap in PDCO’s F3Q17.  Removing AHI and the 
higher ZTS sales, PDCO’s Animal Health segment revenue was flat y-y in F2016 
versus 96.7% reported growth.  Pro forma total revenue growth for FY2016 was 
just 2.3% y-y versus 37.7% reported.   


 
PDCO’s attempt to expand outside of the dental and vet distribution markets 


was not successful.  In 2003, it acquired AbilityOne (renamed Patterson Medical), 
a distributor of rehab and physical therapy supplies, for $575M (2.6x 2003 sales of 
$220M).  In July 2015, PDCO sold this business to private equity for $715M, or 
1.5x F2015 sales.  The medical distribution market includes numerous submarkets 
(primary care, extended care, alternate site, acute care) and distribution is highly 
fragmented. HSIC has about 20% of the primary care distribution market.  Other 
players include OMI, MCK, and privately-held Medline. 


 
With few acquisitions remaining the North American dental market or the 


North American/UK companion animal and production animal veterinary markets, 
and no presence in the medical distribution market, PDCO appears to be out of 
opportunities to grow through further acquisition of distributors.  It also appears to 
be losing share to HSIC in both the dental and veterinary markets, with revenue 
growth for both consumables and equipment falling below HSIC’s.  Results in 
dental equipment have been particularly poor, with growth in the exclusive 
CEREC line falling short of internal goals, and with PDCO losing its semi-
exclusive distribution agreement for A-dec chairs, which A-dec allowed HSIC to 
start distributing in 2015.  


 
Industry sources think a key reason for PDCO’s dental share losses is its 


focus on maintaining above-average margins by keeping expenses low.  For 
example, PDCO appears to have fallen behind in IT and analytic systems that 
would allow management to better understand business trends, putting it at a 
disadvantage to more tech-savvy peers like HSIC and Benco, who seem to be 
winning share.   Management appears to be finally addressing this issue with 
investments in a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to replace its 
homegrown system that began in F2014.  As we discuss below, however, costs for 
this system appear to have ballooned well beyond original plans.  PDCO has also 
controlled costs by shrinking its dental sales force.  PDCO had 1,575 dental sales 
reps and equipment specialists at the end of F2014, and 1,300 at the end of F2015.  
In June 2016, it announced layoffs that industry sources pegged at about 20% of 
the total, which would mean it now has as few as 1,040 dental reps.
4 


Faced with the same saturation of North American dental and vet 
distribution markets, HSIC is pursuing a very different strategy.  It maintains a 
North American dental sales force we estimate at about 1,600 that it trains to help 
dentists build their practices and improve profitability.  It has aggressively 
expanded into international markets, invested in information technology for its 
dental and veterinary customers, expanded its private label consumable lines, lined 
up exclusive diagnostics and equipment distribution agreements, purchased a vet 
diagnostics company, and expanded its dental lab business.  As we discuss, these 
moves appear to be helping HSIC win share from PDCO in both the North 
American dental and North American veterinary markets.   


 
PDCO’s total adjusted EBITDA margins, restated for the sale of Patterson 


Medical, declined from 9.4% in F2014 to 8.4% in F2016.  Reported operating 
margins in the dental and animal health segments each improved 25 bp y-y in 
F2016, so the reported decline was due to the higher mix of lower margin animal 
health sales with the acquisition of AHI.  Management justified this low margin 
acquisition at 16x ttm EBITDA by saying it would provide better top line growth 
opportunities and increase ROIC, which has steadily deteriorated from 21% in 
F2007 to 8.3% in F2016.  So far, neither higher top line growth nor increased 
ROIC have materialized.   


 
For the past two years, PDCO has been making significant investments in a 


new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which it says will allow it to be 
more efficient, expanding operating margins and reducing working capital.   
Industry sources tell us that this ERP investment was necessary because PDCO has 
chronically underinvested in IT and data analytics for years to maintain above-
industry operating margins.  Its homegrown ERP system and lack of staff to 
analyze data appears to have left management in the dark about aspects of its 
business.  It is now reported to be playing catch-up to more IT-savvy competitors.   


 
When it first began the ERP project in F2014, it estimated that it would 


capitalize $35M of the estimated $55M-$65M in total expenses over five years.  
Just two years later, however, the tally of just the capitalized portion of expenses 
had ballooned $88.7M.  


 
PDCO expects to being implementing the ERP system in the fall of 2016, 


and has told investors to expect a $25M step up in costs, including depreciation, 
rollout expenses, and infrastructure support, in the second half of F2017 (October 
2016-April 2017).  Management has said cost saving measures will offset the ERP 
step-up in F2017, and efficiencies will improve margins in later years.  We expect 
the added ERP expenses in F2017 and beyond could make it difficult for the 
company to meet the “street’s expectation for a flat to slightly down operating 
margins in F2017, and slightly improved margins in F2018.
5 


 
The “street” expects revenue of $5.75B in F2017 and $6.2B in F2018, with 


adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.3% in F2017 and 8.4% in F2018.  “Street” EPS 
estimates are $2.68 for F2017 and $2.95 for F2018.  We model $5.68B in revenue 
for F2017 and $5.77B in F2018, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 7.8% in both 
years. Our EPS estimates are $2.40 for F2017 and $2.50 for F2018.  


 
  Most investors seem to value PDCO on a PE basis.  At 18x F2017 


earnings, PDCO trades at the midpoint of its five year PE range of 14x-22x, and at 
a discount to HSIC’s 23x.  Calendar year 2017 revenue and EPS growth 
expectations are higher for HSIC than for PDCO, even after HSIC’s recently 
lowered 2016 guidance.  Investors seem more confident that HSIC can beat 
consensus due to its ability to gain share in saturated North American markets, and 
due to international expansion efforts providing growth opportunities outside of 
North American markets.  We think PDCO’s business has more in common with 
drug distributors ABC, CAH, and MCK, who, like PDCO, derive 80%+ of their 
sales in saturated North American markets.  ABC and CAH trade at 15x 2017 EPS, 
while MCK trades at 14x.  We apply a 15x multiple to our F2017 EPS to arrive at 
our target of $36.  At our target, PDCO’s 2017 FCF yield would be 7.5%, 
compared to ABC’s 10.7%, CAH’s 8.2%, and MCK’s 7.4%.

Background: 
 
 PDCO, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, started as the Patterson Dental 
Company in 1878.  It began acquiring dental supply distributors in the 1980s, and 
went public in 1992.  In 1993, it made its first acquisition in the Canadian dental 
supply distribution market.  In 2001, it made its first acquisition in the veterinary 
supply distribution market, and in 2003 made its first and only acquisition in the 
medical supply distribution market (which it subsequently sold in 2015).  In 2013, 
it acquired a National Veterinary Services (NVS), a UK veterinary supply 
company, and in 2015 it acquired Animal Health International (AHI), a US 
production animal veterinary supply distributor.
6 


 The recent acquisitions continue a long term shift in PDCO’s revenue mix 
away from 12%+ margin dental toward 4%+ margin animal health. Dental revenue 
was 76% of total revenue in F2005, and reported operating margins peaked at 
12.5%.  In F2016, Dental revenue was 46% of total revenue, and reported 
operating margins were 7.3%.  In the tables below, we show the changes in 
revenue mix and operating profit for F2014-F2016, restated for the sale of 
Patterson Medical in F2016.  During this period, Dental declined from 65% of 
revenue to 46%, and adjusted operating margins declined from 8.5% to 7.6%. 
Comparisons to prior periods are difficult because following the sale of Patterson 
Medical it reclassified some revenue to “Other” (financing revenue and other 
miscellaneous sales), and it no longer includes corporate expenses in its Dental 
segment.

As we discuss below, PDCO faces several significant challenges to its 
growth, including limited opportunities for further growth by acquisition, slowing 
growth in its dental and veterinary markets, and market share losses in both the
7 


dental and veterinary markets. In addition, PDCO appears to have underinvested in 
its business operations, and is now trying to catch up by investing over $85M in a 
new enterprise resource planning (ERP system).  The company capitalized these 
expenses, but with implementation beginning in Fall 2016, we think the project 
should reduce PDCO’s margins.  As shown in the table below, we think these 
factors should lead to lower revenue, operating income, and EPS than the “street” 
expects.

Discussion: 
 
1.  PDCO’s Dental and Vet markets are highly concentrated, limiting further 
growth by acquisition 


 
PDCO estimates it has a 33% market share in the North American dental 


distribution market.  This makes it the second largest distributor in the US after 
HSIC, which as 40%.  While PDCO argues it its 10-K that the dental market is still 
highly fragmented, with 15 “regional” and hundreds of small distributors, in 
reality, three privately held distributors (Benco, Burkhart, and Darby) control most 
of the remaining 27% of the market.  Indeed Benco has become a bonafide national 
distributor, with operations in over 27 states.   


 
We think it would be difficult for PDCO to make additional sizable 


acquisitions in dental, limiting growth.  Recent antitrust lawsuits brought against 
PDCO, HSIC, and Benco supports our view.  The complaints allege the companies 
have taken anti-competitive actions, including fixing prices and threatening to 
boycott trade shows if smaller competitors are allowed to exhibit. 


 
PDCO has a 25% share of the North American companion animal vet 


distribution market, with HSIC and MWI (now owned by ABC) controlling 55%.  
Remaining regional distributors include Victor, Penn, Merritt, Nevsco, and 
Midwest.  As in dental, with 80% of the market controlled by just three 
distributors, we think further sizable acquisitions are unlikely.
8 


 
In F2016, PDCO moved into the production animal (e.g., cattle, swine) 


market with its acquisition of Animal Health International (AHI) for $1.1B in cash, 
or 16x ttm EBITDA of $68M.  Industry sources with whom we spoke suggested 
there is very little overlap between the companion and production segments.  The 
companion market is primarily small animal practices with 2-5 vets treating dogs, 
cats, and other household pets.  The production animal market’s customers are 
primarily veterinarians and purchasing officers at dairies, feed lots, and factory 
farms. 


 
With the AHI acquisition by PDCO, 85% of the North American production 


animal market is controlled by just two distributors:  PDCO with 40%, and MWI 
(now owned by ABC) with 45%.  As in the dental and companion animal markets, 
it seems unlikely that PDCO can meaningfully grow its share in the production 
animal market with further acquisitions. 


 
PDCO made an initial foray into the medical supply distribution market with 


its acquisition of AbilityOne in 2003, which it renamed Patterson Medical.  
Patterson Medical provided supplies to rehab facilities and orthopedic groups.  
Sales growth and profits were disappointing, however, and PDCO sold the 
company in F2016.   This sale suggests PDCO does not plan to compete in the 
physician office medical supply market, which is dominated by MCK and HSIC. 
 
2.  Growth in the dental and vet supply markets is slowing 
 
 According to PDCO’s filings as shown on the table below, growth in the US 
dental supply market has slowed from a 5.9% five year CAGR in F2007 to a 1%-
2% five year CAGR in F2015/F2016.  PDCO maintains that its market share 
during that period has remained steady at 32%-33%.  As we discuss below, HSIC 
reports meaningfully higher growth than PDCO.  This, along with our discussions 
with industry participants, suggests PDCO is losing share.

 Growth in the US companion animal/equine animal health market also 
appears to have slowed, from a 3.1% CAGR in F2007 to 1%-2% in F2014 and 
F2015.  While PDCO maintains it has held share steady at 21% since 2011 (25% 
after the acquisition of AHI), HSIC’s US veterinary revenue is growing faster than
9 


PDCO’s, suggesting PDCO is losing share in the companion animal sector as well.  
We discuss this further below. 
 
Table 6:  US Companion/Equine Veterinary Supply Market, 2007-2016

The June 2015 acquisition of AHI gave PDCO a 40% share of the $9B US 
production animal vet supply market, which third party market research groups 
estimate is growing 4%-5% per year.  As we discuss below, growth seems to have 
slowed to about 2% y-y recently, raising questions about the wisdom of the AHI 
acquisition. 
 
3.  PDCO sales growth below HSIC in the North American dental market suggests 
share losses. 
 
 As shown in the tables below, during period June/July 2015-March/April 
2016, PDCO’s constant currency, ex-acquisition North American dental sales grew 
more slowly that HSIC’s.  HSIC had better growth in both consumables and 
equipment. HSIC’s equipment sales growth was significantly higher, particularly 
in the Dec/Jan and Mar/April periods.  This may be due in part to HSIC’s 2Q15 
addition of market-leading A-dec dental chairs (previously only distributed 
nationally by PDCO) to its product line, and to the slowing growth of CEREC in-
office CAD/CAM milling equipment, which we discuss further below.

 As shown above, HSIC reported slower North American dental growth in its 
quarter ending June 2016.  It blamed unexpected softness beginning in June 2016.  
Results in equipment were particularly weak, up just 2.7% y-y versus an easy 
comp, slowing from double-digit gains in the prior two quarters.   
 


June 2016 quarter results from XRAY seem to confirm the recent slowdown 
in North American dental growth reported by HSIC. As shown on the table below, 
XRAY’s US dental sales growth slowed to 1.2% y-y versus 5.7% y-y last quarter 
and 2.6% y-y a year ago.  XRAY does not break out US consumable and 
equipment sales, but blamed the weakness on lower shipments of its Schick 
intraoral cameras, which are sold by PDCO.

US Dental Sales  2.6% 6.1% 6.7% 5.7% 1.2% 
Source:  XRAY earnings releases 
 


Given the 1.2%-2.0% US/North America dental growth seen this quarter by 
XRAY and HSIC, “street” estimates for PDCO’s F1Q17 may be too high.  The 
“street” expects PDCO’s dental revenue to increase 0.2% y-y constant currency in 
F1Q17, but the quarter’s 13 weeks compares to 14 weeks a year ago.  Adjusting for 
the extra week, the “street” expects dental revenue growth of 3.4% y-y in F1Q17.  
Expectations for the rest of F2017 also appear to be high, with y-y growth in 
F2017 expected to be 3.3%, or 4.2% y-y without the extra week.  We expect dental 
growth of 0.2% y-y, or 1.1% y-y without the extra week. 
  
 Notably, PDCO has responded to slower growth by laying off about 250 
dental representatives, or about 20% of its 1,300 reps.  Message boards used by 
dental representatives and discussions with industry participants suggests this 
move was sudden and unexpected.  Benco, HSIC, and Burkhart appear to have 
quickly hired many of these laid off PDCO reps. Our search of a well-known 
business social networking site shows that, so far in 2016, Benco Dental has hired 
14 PDCO sales reps, four equipment reps, and one service technician who left
11 


PDCO in 2016, while HSIC hired seven sales reps and five equipment specialists, 
all of whom left PDCO in 2016.  Finally, competitor Burkhart hired three sales 
reps and two equipment specialists who left PDCO in 2016.  The average tenure at 
PDCO for these 36 representatives was 9.4 years, suggesting either that PDCO let 
go representatives with very deep customer relationships that are now benefiting 
the competition, or that PDCO management was carrying unproductive reps for an 
extended period of time.  We suspect the former. 
 
 To confirm that representative churn is happening disproportionately at 
PDCO, we also searched the networking site for representatives that had moved 
from Benco, HSIC, or Burkhart to PDCO in 2016.  We found just one equipment 
specialist who left Benco for PDCO, one telesales rep who left HSIC to be a 
“practice growth advisor” at PDCO, and one sales rep who left Burkhart for 
PDCO, each with 11-12 years of tenure. 
 
4.  PDCO appears to be losing its dominance in dental equipment distribution. 
 
 PDCO’s equipment sales include both core equipment, such as chairs, lights, 
and dental supply cabinets, and high tech equipment including digital x-ray, digital 
impression, CAD/CAM devices for in-office manufacturing of crowns and inlays, 
and cone beam 3D imaging devices.   This equipment generates significant revenue 
at the time of the sale, in addition to service revenue, office design service revenue, 
and, in some cases, a stream of related consumables.  Equipment sales can also 
help to solidify the distributor’s relationship with the dentist. 
 


For many years, PDCO was the dominant equipment supplier in the North 
American dental market.  In F2013, it had a 33% share of the overall US dental 
supply market, but a 49% share of the large equipment market, including 42% 
share in chairs, 56% share in cone beam 3D imaging equipment, and 93% share in 
CAD/CAM.  It was able to use its exclusive distribution of Sirona CAD/CAM and 
digital x-ray equipment, along with its position as the only national distributor of 
top-rated A-dec dental chairs, to win equipment supply contracts that it could 
leverage into consumable supply contracts. 
 


Strong growth in PDCO’s high tech equipment offerings increased these 
products from 46% of equipment revenue in F2011 to 56% in F2015. At the same 
time, however, sales growth of these products slowed from 30% y-y in F2011 to    
-2.8% y-y in F2015, leading to lower growth of PDCO’s overall dental equipment 
revenue.   In the April 2016 quarter, total equipment sales fell -6.9% y-y.  Low-to-
mid single digit growth of CEREC CAD/CAM equipment in the quarter was offset 
by lower digital x-ray sales.

Core equipment revenue growth has been highly variable, but declined at a 


4.7% CAGR from F2011-F2015.  Industry sources tell us that PDCO has failed to 
win contracts with the growing group dental practices, which are instead going to 
Benco and HSIC.  This may account for some of the core equipment revenue 
deterioration.  In addition, in January 2015 PDCO lost its position as the sole 
national distributor of top-of-the-line A-dec dental chairs when A-dec signed HSIC 
as a distributor.  In the same month, PDCO began distributing entry-level and mid-
range chairs from other manufacturers (e.g., Pelton & Crane, Belmont), perhaps 
cannibalizing its own higher-end A-dec sales.  
 
5.  PDCO is growing more slowly than HSIC in the North American animal health 
market, again suggesting share losses. 
 


The North American animal health supply distribution market has undergone 
a number of changes over the past 24 months.  In October 2014, PDCO and HSIC 
began selling Abaxis veterinary diagnostic equipment and consumables for the first 
time.  In January 2015, PDCO, HSIC, and MWI lost distribution of IDXX 
consumables when IDXX took those sales in-house.  In February 2015, 
Amerisource Bergen bought MWI.  In June 2015, PDCO bought AHI, and in 
January 2016, Zoetis (ZTS) began selling to distributors, rather than using them as 
only agents to collect orders for commission. This change increased the 
distributors’ revenue, since they are now shipping product and recognizing the 
final product sale.  


 
PDCO and HSIC provide top line Animal Health growth rates adjusted for 


currency, acquisitions, the ABAX/IDXX changes, and ZTS’ distribution change.

On its F4Q16 call, PDCO blamed its disappointing animal health sales on 
slow growth in the production animal market, which it estimates is growing about 
2%.  This should be disappointing to bulls, since the rationale for the AHI 
acquisition was expanding into a market growing at 5% per year.  
 
6.  PDCO has limited offerings of exclusive veterinary equipment, unlike HSIC. 
 
 PDCO and other veterinary distributors were dealt a blow in August 2014 
when Idexx (IDXX) announced that, beginning January 1, 2015, it would sell its 
popular SNAP heartworm tests and consumables for its diagnostic equipment 
direct, totally bypassing distributors.  At that time, distributors predicted that 
IDXX’ strategy would fail, and that they would soon return.  Two years later, 
IDXX appears to be stronger than ever as a direct distributor.  HSIC, MWI, and 
PDCO each pursued a different strategy to deal with the loss of IDXX. 
 
 HSIC chose an aggressive strategy to remain relevant in the companion 
animal diagnostics segment.  It became an exclusive distributor for Heska’s 
(HSKA) diagnostics equipment, which competes directly with IDXX.  It also 
began marketing a private label heartworm test manufactured by HSKA that it 
priced at a discount to IDXX tests.  In addition, HSIC bought scil, a small 
veterinary equipment manufacturer with diagnostics equipment that competes with 
both IDXX and HSKA, as well as veterinary ultrasound and digital x-ray 
equipment.  We think this broadened product offering is helping HSIC gain share 
versus PDCO and MWI in the more profitable companion animal market. 
 
 MWI pursued a different path, selling itself to drug distributor Amerisource 
Bergen (ABC) in January 2015.  This move seemed designed to increase ABC’s
14 


leverage with pharmaceutical manufacturers, who were themselves merging (e.g., 
Novartis sold its animal health unit to Lily in January 2015). 
 
 Rather than pursue growth in companion veterinary diagnostics like HSIC, 
or gain distribution leverage by joining a larger player, PDCO chose to enter the 
production animal veterinary supply distribution market via its June 2015 
acquisition of Animal Health International.   This strikes us as an odd acquisition, 
because the companion and production animal markets have very little overlap in 
terms of call points or products.  Management pitched the deal at the time as a way 
to enter a market growing 5% per year, faster than the companion animal market’s 
4%-5% growth.  As mentioned above, however, now management puts production 
animal growth at 2%, and blames it on softness in the livestock industry. 
 
7.  PDCO has underinvested in information systems for years, and is now catching 
up with significant investments in a new ERP system. 
 


Industry sources tell us that for many years PDCO has been maintaining a 
low-cost, home grown computer system to manage its business.  While this 
approach helped PDCO keep its operating expenses low, management appears to 
be at a disadvantage to competitors who have invested in sophisticated enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) systems to help identify problems and opportunities.  


 
In June 2011, PDCO hired a new Chief Information Officer.  In a profile 


posted on a well-known business social networking site, she describes her role 
leading the shift from a “traditional in house developed solution” for enterprise 
management to a purchased solution from SAP.  By April 2014, PDCO had 
invested $10M in the project, capitalized as software expenses, and estimated it 
would capitalize a total of $35M of the project’s $55M-$65M in total expenses 
over five years.  In June 2014, it signed CapGemini to a $25M implementation 
contract for the project.  By April 2015, total capitalized expenses for the project 
had ballooned to $43.6M.  In September 2015, PDCO’s CIO left the company, and 
no replacement has been named.  By April 2016, about three years after the 
project’s start, the total of just the capitalized expenses for the ERP had reached 
$88.7M, 2.5x the original five year budget. 
 


On its most recent earnings call, PDCO said it would begin implementing 
the ERP system in the fall of 2016, and has told investors to expect a $25M step up 
in costs, including depreciation, rollout expenses, and infrastructure support in 
F2017. Management has said cost saving measures will offset the ERP step-up in 
F2017, and efficiencies will improve margins in later years.  Nevertheless, we 
expect the added ERP expenses in F2017 and beyond could make it difficult for 
the company to meet the “street’s expectation for a flat to slightly down operating 
margins in F2017, and slightly improved margins in F2018.

8.  By our calculation, return on invested capital been in decline, and, by our 
estimate, has not shown improvement following the AHI acquisition 
 


PDCO’s ROIC has been on a steady downward trajectory, declining from 
21% in F2007 to 10.4% in F2015, coinciding with the shift in its mix from high 
margin dental to lower margin veterinary sales.  Since at least June 2014, PDCO 
has told investors one of its goals was to increase ROIC.  Indeed, one rationale for 
selling Patterson Medical and buying Animal Health International was to achieve 
higher ROIC.  


 
We calculated ROIC as ttm NOPAT/(Total Assets less Non-Interest Bearing 


Liabilities) for PDCO, adding back one-time expenses, from F2012-F2016.  As 
shown on the table below, in F2016 ROIC was 9.6%, below the 10.4% reported in 
F2015 before the Patterson Medical sale and AHI acquisition. 
 
Table 13:  PDCO ROIC, F2012-F2016

ROIC  10.3% 10.2% 9.9% 10.4% 9.6% 


Source:  PDCO 10-K filings, earnings releases 
 


We note that in its October 2015 investor day slides, PDCO says its F2015 
ROIC was 12.8%, above our calculation of 10.4%.  There are several ways to 
calculate ROIC, and we get closer to PDOC’s number if we exclude goodwill from 
total invested capital, as is sometimes done for acquisitive companies.  As shown 
below, this method yields an ROIC of 13.7% in F2015, closer to PDCO’s reported 
12.8%. 


 
Table 14:  PDCO ROIC excluding goodwill from Total Capital Invested, F2012-F2016

ROIC  15.4% 16.5% 15.3% 13.7% 12.2% 


Source:  PDCO 10-K filings, earnings releases
16 


Either way, the trend of ROIC matters more than the exact number.  In both 
calculations above, ROIC continued its downward trend in F2016 following the 
AHI acquisition and sale of Patterson Medical.   


 
Interestingly, the only other mention of the company’s ROIC we found is in 


its recently released proxy for its upcoming Shareholder’s Meeting (September 
12).  In the document, it reports that its F2014-F2016 ROIC was 14.9%, close to 
our F2014-F2016 average ROIC of 13.9% in Table 14.  Perhaps the downward 
trend that yields this average is why in F2016 management changed its long term 
incentive compensation structure from goals for three year operating income 
growth and ROIC to three year total shareholder return versus the S&P 400.  


 
9. Exclusive distribution deal with Sirona expires in F2018, but seems unlikely to 
end immediately. 
 


PDCO is the exclusive distributor of Sirona products in North America, 
including the company’s CEREC CAD/CAM in-office dental restoration (e.g., 
crowns, inlays) system and its Schick imaging equipment.  Its 20 year agreement 
with Sirona ends in September 2017.  Industry sources suggest that the agreement 
is unlikely to end suddenly, since PDCO has met certain performance goals that 
extend the life of the agreement.  


 
However, these sources suggest that Sirona’s recent acquisition by XRAY, 


along with PDCO’s share losses and representative layoffs, could eventually cause 
the terms of this agreement to change.  Distribution could open up to HSIC, Benco, 
and others.  Alternatively, XRAY may pursue a strategy like IDXX, and take sales 
of the CEREC and its consumables in house.  We note that XRAY said on its 
recent earnings call that it is expanding its specialty sales force.  Perhaps this 
foreshadows changes to come. 
 
10.  Anti-competition lawsuits against PDCO, HSIC, and Benco 
 
 In September 2015, a start-up web-based dental supply company called 
SourceOne Dental filed a complaint against PDCO, HSIC and Benco, alleging that 
the companies conspired to eliminate SourceOne as a competitor.  Then, in January 
2016, a number of class action lawsuits were filed by dentists alleging that the 
companies agreed not to compete on price, forcing dentists to pay higher prices for 
the supplies they use for their businesses.  All of these suits remain outstanding.  
While any outcome could be years away, we think the suits represent a distraction 
for management, and may lead to more price competition in both the dental and 
veterinary distribution markets as the companies seek to prove they are not 
misbehaving.
17 


11.  Recent results and guidance 
 
 PDCO reported F4Q16 revenue of $1.454B, below expectations of $1.465B, 
and EPS of $0.77, above estimates of $0.75 on lower administrative expenses.  It 
guided to F2017 adjusted EPS of $2.60-$2.70.  Consolidated operating margins 
guidance is “flat to down slightly” versus F2016’s 7.6% after absorbing the $25M 
step-up in operating expenses related to the ERP implementation in F2H17, most 
of which is being allocated to the business segments.  The company guided for 
F2017 dental operating margins of 13%-13.5% (versus 12.8% in F2016) and 
animal health operating margins flat with F2016 at 4.6%.   
 
12.  Financial assumptions 
 
Dental Segment:  For F2017, the “street” expects 2.1% y-y growth in consumables, 
5.7% y-y growth in equipment, and 3.0% y-y growth in other dental, for total 
segment growth of 3.3% y-y.  Recall that F2016 included an extra week of sales, 
so the “street” expects 4.2% y-y growth from adjusted F2016 sales. We expect 
1.1% y-y growth in consumables, -1.2% growth in equipment, and 0.6% y-y 
growth in other dental, for total segment growth of 0.2% y-y, or 1.1% y-y without 
the extra week.  
 


For F2018, the “street” expects 3.0% y-y growth in consumables, 5.0% y-y 
growth in equipment, and 3.0% y-y growth in other dental, for total segment 
growth of   3.7% y-y.  We expect 2.9% growth in consumables, -0.6% y-y growth 
in equipment, flat y-y other dental revenue, for total segment growth of 1.4% y-y. 
 


The “street” expects adjusted dental margins of 13.1% in F2017 and 13.4% 
in F2018 versus our 12.4% and 12.2%.  Our lower margin reflects higher operating 
costs related to the ERP roll-out in F2017, with higher operating costs continuing 
in F2018 as the company continues to spend to improve its operating capabilities. 
 
Animal Health Segment:  For F2017, the “street” expects 11.1% y-y growth in 
consumables, 8.6% y-y growth in equipment, and 6.1% y-y growth in other, for 
total segment growth of 11% y-y.  We expect 10.0% y-y growth in consumables, 
6.0% y-y growth in equipment, and 7.5% y-y growth in other, for total segment 
growth of 9.9% y-y. 
 


For F2018, the “street” expects 4.7% y-y growth in consumables, 9.9% y-y 
growth in equipment, and 4.8% y-y growth in other, for total segment growth of 
4.8% y-y.  We expect 2.0% y-y growth in consumables on continued share losses 
and the lapping of the benefit to sales from the change to direct sales of ZTS 
products.  We expect 7.5% y-y growth in equipment, and flat other revenue, for 
total segment growth of 2.1% y-y.
18 


 
The “street” expects adjusted animal health margins of 4.6% y-y in F2017 


and 4.8% y-y in F2018 versus our 4.3% in both years.  Our lower margin reflects 
higher operating costs related to the ERP roll-out in both years, and negative forex 
impacts related to PDCO’s UK business (NVS). 
 
13.  Valuation 
 
 PDCO shares currently trade at 18x F2017 earnings, at the midpoint of its 
five-year PE range of 14x-22x.  This multiple is a discount to HSIC (23x), which 
recently saw multiple compression from a lofty 27x F2017 on disappointing 
C2Q16 results and C2016 guidance.  Nonetheless, investors seem confident that 
HSIC can continue to expand in international markets and win more share in the 
US.   We think PDCO is more like drug distributors CAH, ABC, and MCK, who, 
like PDCO, derive 80%+ of their sales in saturated North American markets.  ABC 
and CAH trade at 15x C2017 EPS, and MCK trades at 14x C2017 EPS.  We apply 
a 15x multiple to our F2017 EPS estimate to arrive at our target of $36.  At our 
target, PDCO’s 2017 FCF yield (where free cash equals cash from operations less 
capex) would be 7.5%, compared to ABC’s 10.7%, CAH’s 8.2%, and in line with 
MCK’s 7.4%. 
 
14.  Risks 


 
Risks to achieving our target include a large acquisition in dental, veterinary, 


or medical distribution.   As discussed, high concentration in the dental and 
veterinary distribution markets are likely to preclude additional large acquisitions, 
which could trigger anti-trust concerns (above those already raised in the dental 
market through recent lawsuits).  PDCO’s recent exit from the medical distribution 
segment suggests moves into this market are unlikely. 


 
A drug distributor, such as CAH or MCK, could acquire PDCO but its 


technology oriented, high touch dental business seems quite different from their 
businesses.   Uncertainties about the fate of PDCO’s Sirona exclusivity in future 
years may also dampen the enthusiasm of potential acquirers. 


 
Changes in the distribution of production animal antibiotics could benefit 


PDCO and other animal health distributors.  By December 2016, medically 
important antibiotics can no longer be used in feed as growth promoters (i.e., 
prophylactic against disease), and will require authorization from a licensed 
veterinarian to be used for prevention, control, or treatment of an identified 
disease.  If lower use of feed additives (12% of F2014 AHI revenue) results in 
higher use of antibiotics (23% of F2014 AHI revenue), the change could benefit 
PDCO’s animal health revenue.  However, industry sources with whom we have
19 


spoken, and PDCO itself, expect the change to have minimal revenue implications 
for PDCO. 


 
PDCO has been buying back shares and paying investors a dividend (at 


present a 2% yield).  We model continued declines in shares outstanding in line 
with “street” expectations, but increased share buybacks or a hike in dividends 
could make it more difficult to achieve our target price.
