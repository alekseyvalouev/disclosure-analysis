Summary


Top Idea Short Ideas Tech


CRNC


Cerence is an obvious short with 65%+ downside – investors who think Cerence is
a cutting edge AI/SaaS/Connected-Car play are in for a rude awakening.


Tech juggernauts such as Google, Apple, and Amazon, as well as blue-chip
startups such as Soundhound (backed by Mercedes, Hyundai, Tencent and Nvidia)
are devouring Cerence’s market share.


Cerence has tried to minimize competitive threats but revenue disclosures and
recent contract awards point to a secularly challenged company that will not be
able to mask degradation in 2021.


Nuance, Cerence’s pre-spin parent company, did not pursue a strategic/PE exit
which strongly suggests that logical buyers did not find Cerence attractive at price
levels of ~$15/sh (vs $55 today).


As legacy revenues/cash flow roll-off, Cerence will follow the path of Telenav – a
car navigation stock that saw its stock collapse in the face of identical competitive

Introduction


We Think Cerence’s Own Marketing Presentation Presents
Compelling Short Case on Stock


pressures.


Sometimes you don’t need a crystal ball to see the future for a stock. In the case of
Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC), Telenav’s (TNAV) spectacular collapse last year
foreshadows the end game for Cerence that we believe will play out in the coming
months.


At the end of the day, once you strip away the buzzwords surrounding Cerence such as
“AI” and “SaaS”, Cerence is just another boring legacy OE auto supplier facing unique
secular and competitive disintermediation. Yet, thanks to Cerence’s liberal use of
buzzwords and a market that is trigger happy to bid up hype, Cerence has (in our view)
wrongly captured the imaginations of investors looking for ways to play the “connected
car” theme. Cerence has been around for decades (previously owned by Nuance
Communications), has historically enjoyed a near-monopoly position with automobile
voice recognition applications, and is now coming up against much larger technology
companies that offer holistic suites that are synchronized with car-owner smartphones –
something Cerence can simply never replicate. This is not a growth stock. This is a
tired legacy company. To our knowledge, no well-known growth investors (e.g. Baille
Gifford, ARK) are invested in Cerence - and this dynamic does not surprise us. Instead,
the Cerence shareholder base appears to consist of fickle value-oriented investors who
believe they are buying “growth at a reasonable price”. In the never-ending bull market
that started almost 12 years ago, does anyone really believe that legitimate and
sustainable growth stories can be bought at reasonable prices?


We think Cerence’s recent investor presentation is the best outline for the short thesis
on the company, as it paints the picture of a company desperately trying to downplay the
competitive threats posed via tech juggernauts and well-funded disruptive startups.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4375534-cerence-this-legacy-auto-supplier-belongs-in-saas-trash-junkyard?source=all_articles_title 3/13


For example, Cerence attempts to minimize competitive threats from companies such
as Google and Apple and Amazon, claiming that it can “co-exist” alongside tech
juggernauts (p14), and that its voice product offers an “Apple-like” car experience (p6).
We are hard-pressed to think of any examples of companies that were successfully able
to “co-exist” against Google, Apple, and Amazon in product lines that these companies
deemed core (and voice assistance is core to all of companies – just think about how
much marketing muscle these companies have put behind Siri and Alexa, for example).
All three of these companies are in your phones, in your homes, and want to complete
the trifecta of watching your every move by being in your car. Furthermore, the very fact
that Cerence deemed it necessary to market itself as capable of providing an “Apple-
like” experience speaks volumes to the competitive threat from Apple.


Unfortunately for Cerence, the company best capable of providing an Apple-like
experience in a car is…Apple itself.


Sell side analysts have aggressively pushed the narrative that Cerence, a business that
we believe generates ~80% of profits from license revenues, is somehow a “software as
a service play”. Cerence naturally embraces this comparison because the market’s love
affair with all things “SaaS” is no secret – SaaS companies are traded on significant
multiples of revenue despite massive losses, while legacy auto OE suppliers such as
Telenav, Adient and Borgwarner trade at <1x sales.


The reality is that the most obvious comparable to Cerence is Telenav. Telenav is an
auto OE supplier that makes navigation systems for cars. In September 2019, when GM
announced that it was partnering with Android for its new infotainment system (
including voice assistance), Telenav shares fell almost 50% in a single day session.
The stock never recovered as reality set in that Telenav is being disintermediated
from the auto OE value chain.

As Competition Spiked, We Believe Cerence Has Had to
Discount to Maintain Appearance of Growth


We are extremely confident that Cerence is facing the exact same pressures as Telenav
and will suffer the very same fate. The only thing that we believe has kept the story alive
is a) an extremely promotional investor relations narrative focused on buzzwords and
that downplays competitive threats, and b) accounting nuances that have temporarily
masked the deterioration in the company’s business. Gravity will soon set in for
Cerence, and we expect the stock to retrace its entire move since 2019. We see 65%+
downside in the shares.


Cerence generates ~50% of revenues from selling auto OEs license rights to its
software, ~30% of its revenue from cloud-connected services that link its voice
technology to live information (e.g. weather updates), and ~20% of its revenue from
professional services that involve Cerence customizing its software solutions for OEs.
We estimate that high margin license revenues comprise ~80% of the company’s gross
profits.


Cerence claims that it has over 50% market share in new cars ( p23). In our view, this
means that Cerence is stuck in the unenviable position of being only a share donor as it
relates to voice applications in cars. As a result, if our thesis is accurate and Cerence is
in fact on a collision course with disaster, one would expect that Cerence is ceding price
and/or losing volume.

Cerence is Not SaaS – Legacy Toyota Contract is Accounting
Anomaly That Will Soon Lapse


Financial data from Cerence itself strongly suggests that the company is in fact
discounting its voice product. Cerence breaks out its crucial license revenue line into
variable versus prepaid revenues. We have spoken with industry consultants who
helped us understand the difference between the two sales models. Our understanding
is that Cerence offers discounts to auto OEs that prepay upfront (effectively a volume
discount) and charge a higher rate for auto OEs that prefer to pay Cerence only at the
time that a vehicle is shipped/delivered. As you can see below, Cerence has materially
expanded its exposure to discounted prepay contracts – the proportion of prepaid
contracts has exploded from a consistent ~25% of revenues to 44% of revenues in
2Q20. In the past two quarters, prepaid revenues have essentially been the only thing
holding up Cerence’s top line. This massive explosion in prepaid revenue growth – that
happens to coincide with competitive entrances in Cerence’s markets – strongly
suggests that Cerence has been price discounting to hold onto business. Taking
upfront prepaid fees at discounts to hold onto share is not the sign of a vibrant
SaaS company. Of course, the very fact that Cerence generates the bulk of its
revenues and profits from license fees itself illustrates that it is not a SaaS company.


We think the data above paints a compelling case that Cerence is caving on price – the
clearest sign of competitive stress flowing through the numbers. The high prepay
revenues also suggests that investors should be wary of extrapolating present revenue
and cash flow trends into the future – we expect this factor to be a material headwind
going forward.

Given that Cerence’s nosebleed valuation is propped by the notion that it is a SaaS
company, we felt it is important to highlight that Cerence is not in fact a SaaS company
and put this topic to bed.


As a reminder, ~30% of Cerence revenues come from cloud-connected services that
link its voice technology to live information (e.g. weather updates). This would be akin to
saying “Siri, what is the weather forecast for today”. This segment generates revenues
on a subscription basis. It goes without saying that this business line appears to have
little logical reason to exist going forward. Assuming the end customer must ultimately
pay for the service, we envision few customers opting to pay for a voice activated in-car
information service given how ubiquitous smartphones are. Given this is the only
“subscription” piece of Cerence’s business, it is clear to us that this company is not
SaaS in any way, shape, or form.


In addition to the earlier point regarding smartphones, we point readers to the
purportedly subscription component of Cerence’s business model and we take a deeper
dive into what has been driving this segment.


Cerence breaks out one legacy contract (that it admits is tied to one single customer)
versus the rest of the business. Our research indicates that the legacy contract was with
Toyota, and that certain Toyota car buyers were given a Cerence Connected voice
subscription for free for a set number of years that is set to lapse this year. Cerence has
been open about the fact that the legacy contract fades away, and that cash flows
associated with the contract largely accrued to Nuance prior to the spin. In other words,
the legacy revenues that comprise over 60% of the company’s connected revenue
segment are effectively “Diet Revenues” – they have no meat on the bones and should
not be capitalized in any price to sales analysis.

Competitive Dynamics


In February 2020, Cerence held an investor day during which it was open about the
nature of this contract and the revenues from this segment. See the relevant excerpts
below:


Source: Bloomberg


When you take a step back, fully understand what these Connected segment revenues
truly represent, and fully appreciate that the bulk of these revenues are “calorie-lite” in
nature – it seems clear to us that Cerence is not a cutting edge subscription business,
but instead just an auto OE supplier that licenses out its voice technology in an
increasingly crowded market.

On the contract wins side (effectively volume), a flurry of news announcements makes it
clear that Cerence is rapidly losing share to a wide range of competitors – both on the
tech juggernaut side as well as on the upstart side.


Our research and calls with industry experts suggest that larger tech players such as
Google (Android Auto and Android Automotive), Apple (CarPlay) and Amazon are
offering free substitute products for connected car services and virtual/voice assistants.
Additionally, well-funded start-ups such as Soundhound (backed by Tencent and Nvidia)
are gaining rapid share. Customer checks we have done indicate that Soundhound is
perceived to have better performance.


We assume all readers are familiar with the big three tech juggernauts, but for readers
less familiar with Soundhound we suggest reading the company's marketing materials
for its main product Houndify here. According to Soundhound:


Houndify combines the smartest voice AI with engineering expertise to help brands
build conversational voice assistants. From proprietary components to a
customizable and scalable voice AI platform, we have the tools to build a highly
accurate and responsive voice user interface.


Effectively, Houndify is a direct comparable to Cerence - it provides white label solutions
for voice in car applications so that brands can maintain control over user experiences.


Notably, all four of Cerence’s main competitors have been aggressive in their goal to
dominate the auto assistant space and have – based on recent contract awards - won
share away that would have historically gone to CRNC. As a reminder, with over 50%
market share, the voice market is Cerence’s to lose. It is therefore crucial to review OE
announcements as they come out to understand what companies are winning in voice.


Here is a non-complete review of contract awards that did not go Cerence’s way:


GM announced it would roll out Android starting 2021 (this is a 3 million annual loss
of vehicles based on our analysis)


Opel looks to be working with Android Automotive


Kia recently announced a Soundhound integration

Honda very recently announced a deal with Soundhound in Europe


Rivian announced Alexa/Amazon integrations – the hyperlinked article is interesting
because it talks at length about how much Amazon is investing in Alexa (e.g.
partnerships with Exxon Mobil to allow you to use your Amazon account and Alexa
voice commands to pay at the pump, or Amazon’s focus on getting into cars)


Fiat Chrysler Uconnect 5 is Using Android - however, FCA appears to be taking a
slightly different approach. Instead of Google maps and assistant, FCA will be
using maps and navigation from TomTom and Amazon’s Alexa voice services


Buick announced an Alexa (Amazon) integration


Some manufacturers are committing to a single voice assistant as Groupe PSA is
doing [voicebot.ai] with Android Automotive across all of its car brands,


Amazon is both partnering with car companies and pushing the Echo Auto
[voicebot.ai] device for integrating Alexa into cars.


Mercedes announced a partnership with Soundhound (and also invested in the
company!)


The Mercedes / Soundhound partnership is particularly of note for one simple reason. In
December 2019, Cerence put out a press release about its “long-term partnership” with
Mercedes – see here. A few months later in June 2020, Soundhound published an
article titled “How Mercedes-Benz Built A New Generation of Voice Control with MBUX”
(see here) that included multiple quotes from Mercedes-Benz employees and made it
clear that Soundhound has been actively working with Mercedes on a transformational
project relating to its MBUX system. This is worth noting because clearly Mercedes is an
important legacy customer of Cerence (our research confirms that German luxury
brands are a key piece of Cerence’s business). While the Soundhound announcement
does not suggest that Cerence has been completely kicked out of all Mercedes models,
it surely shows a) that Cerence is facing a serious competitive threat from Mercedes and
b) that Cerence is likely to face pricing pressure even if it is able to maintain contracts.
Conspicuously missing from the Cerence announcement is that Daimler AG
(Mercedes) put money into Soundhound in 2018. When you consider the facts
here, it is clear that Cerence’s relationship with Mercedes has been negatively
impacted due to the entrance of Soundhound.

Insider Selling Kicking Up Recently


Compare the two company’s announcements – on the left, Soundhound’s
announcement regarding Mercedes included multiple quotes from top R&D officials at
Mercedes-Benz, and on the right, Cerence’s anemic announcement included just a
quote from Cerence’s own CEO.


While this may seem like a trivial matter, when large leading brands offer support
through things like quote attribution and a direct venture capital investment, it speaks
volumes to the quality of the relationship.


It is clear that Mercedes has forged an extremely close relationship with
Soundhound which is unambiguously negative for Cerence given a) the clout of
Mercedes in the crucial luxury industry, and b) Cerence's prior ties to Mercedes
before Soundhound entered the market.


Simply put – we think the evidence is clear that Cerence is a share donor to the big
three tech companies and Soundhound. We suspect that the full extent of the ugliness
from the market share donations will play out in 2021 due to a) the timing of the
company’s spin (company financials are often are dressed up ahead of spins), and b)
the timing of the competitive ramp from Google, Apple, Amazon, and Soundhound.

What Is Cerence Worth?


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
Join the next boom » 


During the September sell off in tech stocks, Cerence was relatively unscathed. We
therefore find it noteworthy that the CEO sold approximately $2 million worth of shares
in a three day stretch in mid-September.


This is the first sign of insider selling of material size involving a materially significant
officer in the last year.


Next year as the competitive dynamics become clear, the cash flow hole from the Toyota
contract ending becomes clear, and the pricing pressure is impossible to ignore, we
expect Cerence will go back to trading at levels that are in-line with other auto OE
suppliers. With an EBITDA estimate for 2021 of around $100MM, we see Cerence
trading at an EV of approximately $800M to $1B, which, after backing out debt, arrives
at a market cap of $650M to $850MM, or ~$17 to 23/sh. The downside potential could
very well be worse if Cerence continues ceding share to competitors and the market
begins to value the company in-line with Telenav (in that scenario, we can see a
downside target price of $10-15/sh).
