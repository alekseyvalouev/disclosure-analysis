Spruce Point Has Established A Short Position in 
Matthews Int’l (MATW) And Sees 55% - 65% 
Downside For The Following Reasons:


1 Poorly Organized Company With Significant Fundamental Headwinds: Matthews Int’l (Nasdaq: MATW) is comprised of 
three unrelated businesses in the death care (“Memorialization”), branding and packaging services (“SGK Brand 
Solutions”), and Industrial Technologies. In our view, each business is mediocre and struggling from a variety of issues, 
resulting in organic sales to decline in aggregate. In Memorialization, cremation rates are rising causing less casket sales,
cheaper imports from China are causing price and margin compression, while virtual memorials are an easy substitute for 
MATW’s bronze/granite structures. Matthews SGK business is being weighed down by spending deferrals of consumer 
packaging companies and FDA regulatory delays. Its Industrial Technology business (just 9% of sales) has margins near all-
time lows while management has been investing for years into R&D for “new product development” with little details 
provided to investors; at best, it is a carrot to bait investors for some upside amongst its portfolio of lagging businesses

Recent Acquisitions Have Failed To Deliver: Hoping to spark growth, MATW has completed 10 acquisitions since FY 2013 
and spent $1.0 billion. Its two largest acquisitions were Schawk ($616m/Brand Solutions/2014) and Aurora Products 
($219m/Memorialization/2015). Based on our research, these deals have failed miserably to meet expectations. As a 
result, MATW is bloated and saddled with declining organic growth of 1-3% in Memorialization and 3-5% in Branding. All 
along, MATW has been promoting how its ERP investment would yield great benefits and allow for seamless acquisitions, 
but after six years of implementation (average implementation time is 21 months), investors have no clue how much 
MATW has spent on this project, and not a single accounting disclosure has been made on its software amortization 
policies. Don’t be shocked that years ago Schawk admitted software capitalization accounting issues
Mounting Evidence of Dubious Financial Results: MATW has taken classic measures to obscure its problems such as 
realigning segment reporting and promoting highly “adjusted” figures. MATW has reported $176.8m of pre-tax charges 
since 2012 (with ~$165m related to acquisitions and strategic cost reductions). Charges have totaled a whopping 16% of 
its deal costs. When put into context of other successful calls Spruce Point has made identifying companies struggling to 
integrate targets (eg. NCR, ACM, ECHO, CECE, GEF), MATW is the worst we’ve ever seen! When we look closer at its 
operational footprint, we find little evidence that it has accomplished anything. SG&A margin is rising as are other fixed 
cost of operations. Not surprisingly, management is now touting “adjusted free cash flow” metrics, which we think 
overstates 3yr cumulative cash flow by nearly 30%. With sales slowing, and accounts receivables ballooning, Matthews 
quietly initiated an accounts receivable securitization facility in April 2017;  in our view, a tacit admission by the Company 
its cash flow isn’t as robust as it appears
6


Spruce Point Sees 55% to 65% Downside Risk In 
MATW For The Following Reasons:


4
Debt Ballooning To Near A Billion Dollars With Very Little Covenant Cushion: MATW’s acquisition ambitions are problematic 
now that organic growth is declining, interest rates are rising, and nearly 60% of its assets are goodwill and intangibles ready to 
be impaired. MATW sells equity investors on its heavily Adjusted EBITDA of $238m. However, equity investors would be wise to 
look carefully at MATW’s credit agreement, which we estimate places the EBITDA for covenant purposes at closer to $220m, or 
7% lower. We estimate its Total Leverage Ratio is close to 4.0x vs. a maximum leverage covenant of 4.5x. Matthews recently 
issued a senior unsecured bond at 5.25% due 2025, but it has significant other maturities coming due in 2019-2021. Liquidity 
could become an issue of focus for investors in this junk credit. Almost 100% of cash and equivalents are permanently invested 
abroad, which makes MATW heavily dependent on its credit facility to balance its capital needs for $50m/yr of capex, $20m/yr 
in dividends, and to continue pursuing its reckless acquisition strategy (note: its last $50m acquisition “announcement” in Nov 
2017 was quietly filed as an 8-K, and MATW didn’t even disclose the company’s name)


5 Serious Financial Control Issues and Governance Concerns: We have little reason to trust MATW’s ability to maintain financial 
order. Setting aside the fact that Schawk had previously restated financials, reported material weaknesses, and received a Wells
Notice from the SEC, in July 2015 MATW revealed a material weakness of financial controls when it disclosed theft from a long-
time employee of nearly $15m, making MATW the subject of Western Pennsylvania’s largest corporate embezzlement in 
history. This event came after another MATW employee was sentenced to jail in Jan 2015 for running a fake invoicing scheme. 
By Nov 2015, MATW declared its Material Weakness had been solved, and changed auditors from PwC to E&Y in December 
2017. Spruce Point believes that investors should be extremely cautious in light of our own findings that MATW: 
1) incorrectly accounts for dividends and share issuance in its equity accounts, 2) has taken frequent and large charges that
don’t reconcile between its SEC filings and investor presentations, and have not resulted in meaningful cash flow gains, and 
3) management’s compensation has risen at a 30% CAGR during this same period of mediocre performance


6 Sum-of-Parts Valuation Gets Us To 55%-65% Downside: We believe MATW should fire management and split up the Company. 
However, we believe this would expose MATW’s extreme overvaluation. Shares might “look” cheap at 1.6x, 10x, and 14x 2018E 
Sales, EBITDA, and P/E but it’s because Street estimates take management’s highly adjusted results at face value, and pencil in 
low single digit growth. Even management doesn’t seem confident in its outlook, and only says adjusted earnings will grow at a 
rate consistent with FY2017, without further elaboration. Yet, the analysts covering MATW see 48% upside to nearly $78/sh – a 
major disconnect! Given our evidence that adjusted financial results appear dubious, we base our valuation on GAAP results, 
assume no growth, and apply peer trading multiples at a slight discount to reflect MATW’s mediocre businesses and below 
average margins and growth. Our sum-of-the parts valuation implies $18.50 - $24.50 or approximately 55% - 65% downside

Evidence MATW’s Largest Deal To Acquire 
Schawk A Major Disappointment


Matthew’s largest deal to acquire Schawk in 2014 for $616m was heavily promoted by management. Yet, relative to 
expectations set in the proxy statement, it is clear that the combined entity has been a bust. Even with the inclusion of 


the added acquisition of Aurora Caskets in 2015, we estimate Matthews has missed its internal sales and EBITDA 
projections by 15% and 30%, respectively. It should be no surprise that members of the Schawk family cashed out 


early in May 2016 by selling 970,000 shares at $50.69 back to MATW (1)

incremental financial contribution from Aurora

SGK Brand Solutions: 
MATW’s Largest Business Declined Organically


Based on Spruce Point’s research, MATW and its largest operating segment encompassing Schawk declined organically by 
5% in 2017. Schawk has outsized exposure to consumer packaged goods (food / tobacco) – a sector under pressure - and 
under-exposure to digital media marketing and advertising, an area that’s growing and becoming more competitive with 


global consulting firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, and McKinsey vying for client spending budgets.  (1)(2)

2) “Global Consultancies Are Buying Up Agencies and Reshaping the Brand Marketing World” - AdWeek March 12, 2017


CEO Schawk Deal Announcement, March 2014: “We are excited to be partnering with Matthews International and look forward to capitalizing on the 
opportunities this transaction will create.  With Matthews International’s trusted reputation in Europe and ours in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, 
this alliance is expected to form a stronger global offering and provide greater value to our clients and the markets we serve, along with enhancing our 
ability to expand into key brand-development markets.  Together, we will be a global market leader, with anticipated annual revenues of approximately 
$850 million for the combined business under the SGK banner.“


MATW Q4’17 Earnings Release: “The SGK Brand Solutions segment reported sales of $770.2 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $756.0 million last year. 
Sales growth in its U.K. and Asia Pacific markets and the impact of recent acquisitions were the principal contributors to the increase in sales. The 
segment’s sales in the U.S. and European markets were lower for the year primarily reflecting weaker brand market conditions. Changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of $12.1 million on the segment’s sales for fiscal 2017 compared to last year.”

Memorialization Segment And Aurora 
Acquisition Also A Bust


Memorialization, or products and services tied to the funeral industry, represent 41% and 72% of MATW’s 2017 revenues and 
operating profits. The business has suffered significantly, despite the acquisition of Aurora Casket in August 2015 for $210m, 
which was touted to have produced $144m / $21m of sales and EBITDA in 2014, and supposed to add $35-$40m of incremental 


EBITDA (1). We estimate the segment has declined 1.5% organically since 2014. Trends in the industry leave MATW poorly 
positioned; notably, cremations are rising and expected to account for >70% of death ceremonies by 2030. 


We estimate that ~10% of MATW’s segment revenues (5% of total revenues) are tied to cremations.

Trends Favoring Greater Cremation MATW’s Memorialization (Death care) Trends


Reasons why cremations are rising:  1) growing awareness that funeral homes offer cremation as an option, 2) increasing religious tolerance to 
cremation and weakening role of religion on society, 3) baby boomer acceptance of cremation, 4) cost of cremation (as low as $700) vs. burial 
ceremony and casket ($7,000 and up), 5) and regulatory change increasing public awareness that caskets can be marked-up as much as 300% 
between wholesale and retail
Alternative memorialization options exist and gaining popularity: MATW produces bronze, granite and other memorial products. However, 
online memorials have been growing in popularity as a cheap/fast alternative; even Facebook allows memorialization of deceased profiles (2)

Other Bad Trends In Caskets


Caskets are a commodity product and producers such as Matthews/Aurora compete on price, style and ease of purchase. By law 
in the U.S. funeral homes must give price transparency and allow families to use a casket purchased from any source (1). With
rising imports from China and mass online retailers selling direct to consumers, market share and margins are under pressure.

CEO Bartolacci (Q2’16): “During the quarter 
we have chosen to rename our industrial 
segment to better reflect the true nature of 
the underlining business. Many of you may 
recall this segment to have been our 
marketing products division at historical 
roots of our business. Today, given the 
evolution of this business and the scope of 
its current and future product lines there's 
no better descriptor that encompasses the 
core of this business other than industrial 
technologies.” Source: MATW Investor Presentation, Slide 14


Anything Complex About Printing on Boxes?


Spruce Point believes that MATW’s industrial segment is a “show-me” story, and just a repackaged old business. MATW claims 
to be working on a disruptive new warehouse control system for e-commerce. It has made several small acquisitions in the 


segment (RAF/DDI/Guidance), yet doesn’t disclose the acquisition sales contribution, making it difficult to determine if sales 
growth is organic. However, we note that segment return on assets and operating margins have declined to all-time lows.

Dubious Financial Results And 
Serious Financial Control Concerns
17


Financial Control Concerns


Four strikes and you’re out: Spruce Point believes that MATW’s financial controls are so poor that its Controller, CFO, 
and CEO should resign immediately. How can investors have confidence in a company that allowed the largest 


corporate embezzlement in Western Pennsylvania’s history and cannot even count dividends correctly?


Jan 2015: Matthews International employee Peter Kalemon sentenced to prison for theft from 2010 – 2013 in a fake 
invoice scheme amounting to systematic theft of $415,000. No mention of theft or material weakness in MATW’s 
annual reports from 2010 – 2013. July 2015: During the recent quarter, the Company identified a theft of funds from 
the Company by Cynthia Mills (a treasury and cash specialist at Matthews) that had occurred over a multi-year 
period through May 2015.  The cumulative amount of the loss was approximately $14.8 million. MATW determined 
the matter constituted a material weakness in internal controls. The embezzlement is believed to be the largest 
scheme in Western Pennsylvania history. Mills is sentenced to 8 years in prison


Jan 2011: Schawk receives a Wells notice from the SEC relating to a financial restatement for the years 2005-2006 
disclosed in 2008, and an admission of material weaknesses tied to revenue recognition, software capitalization, 
and accounting for taxes. 
March 2014: Matthews acquires Schawk in 2014 for a 49% premium and a rich 11.0x EBITDA


Spruce Point identifies a number of worrisome financial control issues and discrepancies
• Equity accounts inaccurate due to improper dividend and share issuance accounting
• Improbable amount of charge-offs with little evidence of improved financial condition or cash flow
• Discrepancies between SEC filing figures and investor presentations
• Irreconcilable financial debt balances 


Nov 11, 2015: MATW claims to remedy the weakness, “In response to the material weakness, management took 
immediate action to remediate the material weakness and implemented changes in the design of this internal 
control to ensure appropriate segregation of duties within the Company's treasury process.. The Company has 
completed the documentation and testing of the corrective actions described above for a sufficient number of 
periods in order to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated as of September 30, 2015.”
December 23, 2015: MATW’s Audit Committee dismissed PwC (auditor since 1983) and appointed E&Y

A Close Look At MATW’s ERP Odyssey


CEO on ERP (Q1’17): “We’ve entered the final phase of our SGK 
related ERP implementation and I’m pleased to say that for the 
most part it is expected to end this year, on time and reasonably 
within budget.”


MATW’s has hyped for years that its ERP implementation would provide great cost savings and facilitate acquisition 
integration. Started in November 2011, the project continued all the way to 2017, an astounding six years or 72 


months (1).  A recent consulting report by Panorama suggests that ERP implementations run 21 months on average 
(2). MATW has never disclosed the full costs of the ERP project, and MATW does not account for software or 


technology in its PP&E accounts consistent with best practice disclosures. These circumstances heighten our worry 
about potentially misleading charges on the income statement


Recent ERP Discussion in 2017


ERP Discussion in 2013


CEO on the ERP (Q1’13): “I mean, the ERP, as you heard in my 
comments earlier, I would tell you that we're past the 
challenging portion of that implementation. I'd say we have 
another quarter of some outside assistance in trying to get us to 
where we would like it to be from an efficacy standpoint. We will 
continue to tweak and turn it for years to come, frankly. But at 
that point -- by the end -- this past quarter, I would say the 
significant challenges are behind us.”

MATW PP&E Accounts Do Not Contain 
Accounts for Software/Computers


Recall: Schawk, which MATW acquired in 2014 disclosed 
material weaknesses tied to software accounting policies (3) 
Note: MATW doesn’t disclose spending on technology, have 
a line item account for computers /software in PP&E, or 
even discuss software amortization policies in its 10-K. Are 
earnings being inflated by leaving substantial costs in the 
“Construction in progress” account, which has ballooned 
from $10.4m to $36.5m since 2014

Perks and Benefits


Spruce Point’s research shows more evidence to suggest management is milking the corporation while business 
suffers. Subsidiary records show MATW owns Kedzie Aircraft LLC which has a Learjet registered in Pittsburgh. Flight 
records show many trips to Naples where director and SGK president Schawk resides. Who is footing these costs?

“In addition, the Company has permitted in the past the personal use of a 
corporate aircraft in which the Company owns a fractional interest by the 
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and his family provided that the 
Company receive reimbursement of all incremental costs to the Company 
related to its personal use. Effective 2010, as part of the Chief Executive 
Officer’s compensation, Mr. Schawk is entitled to personal use of 
corporate aircraft at the Company’s expense, provided that the value of 
the flights attributed to Mr. Schawk as compensation does not exceed 
$100,000 annually (excluding amounts to tax effect (gross up) such 
compensation). The Committee believes that personal use of the 
Company’s aircraft represents a valuable perquisite for Mr. Schawk that is 
appropriate considering his value to the Company and that such benefit 
can be provided by the Company for relatively minimal cost.”

Questionable and Distorted 
Free Cash Flow Presentation


In Spruce Point’s experience, companies under financial stress try to present their free cash flow in an overly 
optimistic light [see our reports on NCR (2015) and Greif (2014)]. We observe that MATW presents its adjusted free 


cash flow in an aggressive manner (bottom left) suggesting cumulative free cash flow of $387 from 2015-17. 
However, when calculated under the traditional definition, we calculate $278m of free cash flow (28% less).

MATW is precariously levered and experiencing declining organic growth. It presents an Adjusted EBITDA 
figure to equity investors that Sprue Point believes should be carefully evaluated. We believe investors should 
instead focus on its credit agreement EBITDA, which is 7% below the promoted EBITDA. We estimate MATW’s 


Leverage ratio is 3.9x vs. a 4.5x covenant – leaving it with ~$30m of “cushion” before tripping a covenant.

Liquidity Analysis


We think investors should take notice that MATW recently initiated a receivables securitization facility in April 
2017 and utilized 83% of the $115m program. This is a classic sign of financial stress. We also note that almost 


100% of MATW’s cash is in foreign subsidiaries and intended to be permanently invested abroad. MATW recently 
issued $300m of unsecured debt to reduce dependence on its credit facility

Red Flag: AR Growing Faster Than Sales


We wanted to investigate why MATW decided to start an AR Securitization program in April 2017. A classic red 
flag, MATW’s receivables have been growing meaningfully faster than sales after its two large acquisitions.


A significant number of the Company’s memorialization customers are small businesses and MATW has ~26% of 
sales to Europe and the UK which has struggled with lower growth. It’s very abnormal that its allowance for 


doubtful accounts has barely grown; suppressing this account would enable earnings overstatement.

Passive Index Chasers As Owners


MATW’s share price has been driven the past few years by the disappointing trend of passive index and ETF 
chasers, and not by insider buying or hedge fund positioning. We doubt the passive buyers have conducted an 


extensive forensic financial review in deciding to increase their ownership, and are likely just blindly buying 
management’s questionable adjusted financial results

Easy To Debunk The Bull Case


Bullish Promoters


“MATW’s cremation equipment business 
provides a natural hedge against the 
cremation trend”


Spruce Point View


“With modest top-line growth, memorialization 
provides a solid base of free cash flow. SGK 
offers top-line growth more in line with GDP 
while the industrial segment sees very strong 
long-term, top-line growth through the 
introduction of new innovative products”


“After the stock’s recent pull-back, the equity 
trades at a forward P/E under 16x. For a 
consistent 8%-9% annual bottom line grower, we 
find a sub-market valuation to be unwarranted. 
Over the last 3 years, MATW has generally 
traded in a range of 17x-22x earnings. Our $75 
target is derived by applying an approximately 
17x multiple to our revised F2019 EPS estimate 
of $4.34. If anything, this valuation could prove 
conservative, in our view.”


MATW stopped disclosing cremation sales in 
2014. At that point in time, it represented just 
10% of memorialization segment sales, and 
5% of total company sales


A majority of the top-line growth appears to be 
acquired and actual organic growth is negative. 
MATW uses an aggressive presentation of free 
cash flow to make it appear stronger than normal. 
How can memorialization provide a stable cash 
flow base when it is shrinking?


MATW trades at or above its recent average 
valuation, despite mounting evidence of financial 
strain, dubious pre-tax financial charges and lack 
of organizational improvement from failed 
acquisitions. Recent EPS has been flattered by a 
significant decline in the tax rate (which has 
average 32%, but fell to 23.2%) in FY17 and a 
lower share count from buybacks. Spruce Point 
believes MATW should be valued on a Sum-of-the-
Parts basis using GAAP results, not the dubious 
adjusted metrics provided by MATW management, 
which has demonstrated an inability to prevent 
theft and adequate financial controls
40


Trading Comparables For Each Segment


The best way to gauge valuation of Matthews is to understand what each business would be valued at on a 
standalone basis. Spruce Point has developed a set of comparable companies.

Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation Implies 
55% - 65% Downside Risk


It’s no surprise to us that none of the MATW analysts dare to conduct a sum-of-the-parts valuation. It is the natural 
valuation technique given the disparate businesses under its umbrella. Using our carefully selected group of public 


comps, we derive multiple ranges for each of MATW’s businesses. However, we note that most of its businesses have 
inferior margins and growth profiles, so it is natural we discount the multiple ranges.

inflated Adj EBITDA. We see no 


justification for a valuation premium for 
the combo of these mediocre assets and a 


mgmt team that fails to execute

Notes


MATW overpaid for 
Schawk at 11x  


EBITDA. Peers valued 
at around 7.0x with 
more growth and  


slightly higher 
margins. Top end of 


our multiple
range is 6.5x


Peers valued at 
9.5x – 11.5x, but 


Hillenbrand is most 
relevant peer. 


Hillenbrand’s casket 
business reports 25% 


casket EBITDA margins 
vs. MATW’s 19%. 


MATW should trade at 
a discount


Publicly traded peers small 
cap industrial peers trade 
around 10x, but MATW’s 


business has vastly inferior 
margins and less 


transparency
