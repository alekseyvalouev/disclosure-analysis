It’s in the Details: EPO High Court’s Final Fact
Finding Shuts Down Universal Display’s Hype for
good and for ever.


Posted on November 25, 2013 by asensio.com


Monday, November 25, 2013.   Last Friday’s Highest Patent Appeal


Court of the European Union Patent Office issues a  Final Decision


against Universal Display Corporation (“UDC;” NASDAQ: OLED).


 The Decision revoked UDC’s pioneering claim, which asensio.com


referred to as “ludricious” in a reserch report dated September 27,


2013 titled Universal Display’s ludicrous claim of owning


phosphorescence.


UDC can not appeal the Decision. The most significant part of the


Decision is in the Fact Finding.  The Decision’s Fact Finding  deny


UDC’s basic scientific claim based a review of all the data UDC has


available worldwide.  The Decision’s Fact Finding can be applied in


all jurisdictions, including the United States of America.  The patent


at issue is equivalent to the only patent referred to in UDC’s OLED


Patent License and Material Purchase Agreement with Samsung


Mobile Display Co., Ltd.  The patent and Agreement are set to expire


in 2017.  The EPO’s Decision eliminated the only known basis for


UDC’s assertion that it “owns” the exclusive right to sell


phosphorescent chemicals for use in OLEDs.


Not only are these appeals strictly limited by law, but legal experts


found UDC’s appeal especially inconsequential.  For instance UDC


requested permission return to the EPO’s lower court.  There is no


legal basis for this request; the ruling Court has jurisdiction over the


subject matter and authority to make findings of facts


notwithstanding the opposition panel’s lower ruling.


In all cases for all of UDC’s claims the Court found that as a matter


of fact UDC had made NO inventions whatsoever; plainly speaking


that UDC’s claims were fictional.  In other words that UDC’s patent

claims were so lacking in meaning, or senseless, that they were


meaningless even to a skilled person expert in the material.


The EPO High Court’s  factual findings is that UDC’s claims were not


supported by any data the UDC presented.  It could not find a single


shred of evidence supporting UDC’s claims.  The Court has wide


discretion to make its determination.  It could have ruled that UDC


had disclosed some invention and proceeded to test the


patentability of the invention.  It did not.  It found that UDC had


made no invention.  As a result to UDC’s lack of invention the Court


did not allow further argument and did not require further


deliberations.


Shown below are the first level of review and their requirements.


The Court found that the scientific evidence proved that UDC’s data


presented to support is broadest claim failed to meet the standard


for an “invention.”


There are four basic requirements for patentability: Art. 52(1)


(i)there must be an “invention”, belonging to any field of technology


(see G-II);


(ii) the invention must be “susceptible of industrial application” (see


G-III);


(iii) the invention must be “new” (see G-IV to VI); and


(iv) the invention must involve an “inventive step” (see G-VII).


http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-


texts/html/guidelines/e/g_i_1.htm


Below is a EPO’s description of the decision’s fact finding:


“The EPC does not define what is meant by “invention”,


but Art. 52(2) contains a non-exhaustive list of things


which are not regarded as inventions. It will be noted that


the items on this list are all either abstract (e.g.


discoveries or scientific theories) and/or non-technical


(e.g. aesthetic creations or presentations of information).


In contrast to this, an “invention” within the meaning of


Art. 52(1) must be of both a concrete and a technical


character (see G-I, 2(ii)). It may be in any field of


technology.” http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-


texts/html/guidelines/e/g_ii_1.htm


The Board of Appeal is the European Union’s Highest Court. The


Court has its own scientific investigation and Fact Finding


authority.  As shown below appeals from this Court’s final decisions


are extremely rare with only 90 appeals having been allowed in


28,000 cases.  Furthermore, allowance is not indicative of success.


 “Over more than thirty years, the Boards of Appeal of the European
