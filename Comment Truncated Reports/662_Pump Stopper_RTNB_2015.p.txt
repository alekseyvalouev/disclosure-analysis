ROOT9: -82.5% Downside On Management Fraud Allegations, Cyber
Failure And Bankruptcy - Strong Sell
Jun. 15, 2015 9:58 AM ET103 comments

Summary


RTNB is a worthless reverse-merger created by insiders with long history of penny-
stock wipeouts, fraud allegations, and disaster while CEO Grano embroiled in
"fraudulent concealment"and "breach of fiduciary duty" lawsuit.


RTNB’s claimed “cyber” business is minuscule and imploding, while not a cyber-tech
business but largely appears an old employee training program which RTNB resells
or other irrelevant, overhyped offerings.


Insiders enriching themselves with RTNB through curious related-party transactions,
abusive compensation and unloading their failing investments into the public shell at
overvalued prices.


RTNB insiders have funded their enrichment through astounding 1,000% (so far)
dilution while generating -$48 million in losses. Insider-owned preferred shares
convert at $2.50, capping RTNB stock at $2.50 .


Even assuming RTNB is “real” AND honest management AND fundamentals
miraculously turnaround AND using overly-optimistic peer valuations, RTNB has
-82.47% downside today. Given precedent of RTNB team, bankruptcy seems
inevitable.


I believe Root9 Technologies Inc., is a worthless reverse merger shell led by the "The A-
Team" of penny stock wipeouts, questionable board members who have presided over
untold shareholder wealth destruction, and a management team with ties to numerous
fraud allegations. Starting as far back as the 1980's, some of these insiders have been
involved in numerous securities violations and fraud allegations in what seems a very
"interesting" recurring pattern. While RTNB shareholders experience brutal losses,
deteriorating fundamentals and egregious dilution this "A-team" of penny stock wipeout
masters have gotten amazingly wealthy through questionable related party transactions
and foisting their failing private investment onto this public shell, all while collecting
unreasonably high cash and stock compensation.

As RTNB has attempted to ramp their promotional "hype machine" with absurd press
releases, real cyber security experts have pushed back, debunking their ridiculous claims.
Unfortunately unsophisticated retail investors have piled into RTNB on "cyber hype" now.
As a result, despite deteriorating fundamentals and RTNB's claimed miniscule "cyber"
business imploding -44%yoy to just $428k of revenue in Q1, RTNB shares have
temporarily rallied +400% to the unsustainable valuation of $140m+ for businesses RTNB
recently (over)paid just $35m for. Also supporting the view of RTNB's unsustainable
overvaluation, RTNB insiders just filed to sell 10m shares of illiquid RTNB stock.
Furthermore, through a convoluted preferred share structure, an additional avalanche of
RTNB stock becomes unlocked at $2.50, creating a stock price ceiling with even more
insider enrichment for RTNB shareholders.

Even if you somehow believe RTNB is a "real" company led by honest people AND the
currently imploding business fundamentals and cash burn miraculously turn around,
generously valuing RTNB similar to obviously superior peer companies STILL shows
RTNB has -82.47% downside. However, given this "A Team" of wipeout and past fraud
allegations, I think it's clear the much more likely outcome is RTNB fundamentals continue
to deteriorate while insiders get rich and the stock will go to $0, just like many other
companies this team has been involved in. I believe this likely outcome is likely why
insiders are trying to sell 100% of 10m RTNB shares right now.


I recommend extreme caution to anyone considering purchasing this stock or who is
currently invested in what I consider likely to become a complete wipeout for
shareholders. Below is a summary of my research, although I'm sure if time allowed,
investors in RTNB would find much, much more than what I have shared in this report.


RTNB Insiders: The "A-Team" of Penny Stock Wipeouts

In my view, RTNB insiders are clearly the "A-Team" of microcap shareholder wipeouts. To
understand who is behind RTNB and what is truly going on with this shell, let's take a look
at the company's frightening S-1 filing just filed in which insiders are aggressively trying to
cash out of nearly ~10,000,000 shares. None of the cash from this offering even goes to
the company! It only goes to insiders! If you buy this stock you are basically giving your
money directly to these questionable insiders, in my view. Notice the number of shares
owned after the offering is nearly 0% in almost every case.


I have highlighted some key, extremely "questionable" individuals for you to understand
below and will draw your attention to these people and organizations throughout the
report. You may want to print this page out to follow along so you can understand what is
truly going on at RTNB.

Let's start by reviewing the highly questionable cast of characters at Root9 Technologies,
Inc. one-by-one with all my research, estimates and views cited and linked for the public
good. I personally guarantee you will be amazed at what you read!


Joseph J. Grano Jr - RTNB's CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors



http://root9btechnologies.com/management.html
5/22/2018 ROOT9: -82.5% Downside On Management Fraud Allegations, Cyber Failure And Bankruptcy - Strong Sell - root9B Technologies, Inc. (…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3258735-root9-minus-82_5-percent-downside-on-management-fraud-allegations-cyber-failure-and-bankruptcy-strong-sell


Grano has an extensive history with both penny stock value destruction and questionable
related party transactions with RTNB, among many, many other issues. As I will outline
below, these transactions are so self-enriching to Grano that I think it is obvious what
RTNB truly is.


To date, Grano seems to have sold two private companies from Centurion Holdings, LLC
(a firm apparently controlled by Grano) into the RTNB shell and personally received an
astounding $2.7 million in cash from shareholders for sales of Ecological, LLC and IPSA
International, Inc. Unsurprisingly, both IPSA and Ecological appear to be financial
disasters and failing. On top of cash payments to Grano, Grano's affiliates were able to
enter into lucrative employment contracts that are absurdly generous and I don't see how
they could be in the best interests of RTNB outside shareholders.


In the first transaction, Grano is apparently the co-founder and owner of Ecological, LLC
and in December 2012 he successfully sold the company to RTNB for a staggering
estimated $7 million despite Ecological only having $430,000 in revenue and a $2.2
million loss recorded in the prior year. How likely is it that RTNB shareholders thought they
were getting a good deal by paying 16x sales for a low margin contracting business?


According to Capital IQ, RTNB recently sold Ecological, LLC apparently for an
undisclosed amount, which I can only speculate was a fraction of the price they paid for it.
Even though this transaction was in my view completely unreasonable, RTNB paid Brian
King the former Ecological CEO and current RTNB Chief Operating Officer a remarkable
$278,316 in total compensation for 2014, which for the mathematically challenged equals
more than 50% of Ecological revenue. It looks to me like non-insider RTNB shareholders
took a bath on this transaction.


Unfortunately for RTNB shareholders, King's record as a public company executive seems
terrible to me. King previously worked for two other public companies and in both cases,
shortly after he assumed senior positions things began unraveling quickly.

United Energy Corp


In what appears to me another attempt by Grano to unload a failing company of his, IPSA
International was sold to RTNB at the beginning of this year. According to CapIQ, RTNB
paid 8x EV/EBITDA for what appears to be a low margin consulting business with a very
concentrated customer base. I believe this too will clearly end up further destroying RTBN
shareholder value since, as others have pointed out, IPSA seems to be a mediocre
business with poor, deteriorating fundamentals. Once again, as part of the transaction
Grano's business partner Dan Wachtler entered into a 3 year employment agreement with
RTNB that included a $450,000 annual salary.


This of course does not even take into account the low strike options Grano and his
affiliates have been granted that are worth multiples of what has been received in cash so
far. Grano also receives a salary of $500,000 annually with a minimum guaranteed annual
bonus of an additional $500,000. To date, Grano has accumulated 9.7% control and now
wants to sell his stock. This kind of compensation and handing out paydays to associates
is clearly abusive in my opinion.


As we can see below that just in the direct and stated comppensation we can see insiders
have collected almost $10m in comp with virtually all of that happening in just the past 3
years!

In my view, this level of compensation is clearly abusive and unreasonable for a company
that has delivered little more than staggering losses, cash burn and dilution to its
shareholders. How has the RTNB A-team funded this mess?


Source: chart by me based on CapIQ Data


In my view, the only way RTNB insiders can get away with this is because RTNB is
primarily held by unsophisticated retail investors who probably don't understand what is
truly going on here. How much longer can this possibly go on?


(Table made by me based on CapIQ Date)


Based on the in depth research I conducted, it seems RTNB is not the first time Grano has
milked a low quality public shell. His involvement in another penny stock Amerityre
Corporation (a really awesome Boulder City, Nevada penny stock), resulted in Grano

receiving 7% of the company, most of it in low strike warrants. Through his holding
company Centurion, Grano entered into a consulting agreement with Amerityre that
required the company to pay him $500,000 per year for 2 years and granted him
1,300,000 in options. As part of the agreement, Grano's friend and associate Nasser J.
Kazeminy was granted 650,000 options. Not surprisingly, after Grano was enriched with
the limited assets that Amerityre had, shareholders were essentially left with nothing and
the stock basically went to zero.


Amerityre Corp: Shareholders Get Wiped Out….


Does big Joe just know how to pick 'em or is something else going on here?


Unfortunately, it actually gets much worse from here. Grano and Kazeminy were also
embroiled in a lawsuit which to me appears similar with what is currently happening at
RTNB in terms of insiders adversely treating other shareholders while themselves cashing
out at favorable terms.


The lawsuit is about a group of minority shareholders that suffered severe losses on their
investment in a company due to a group of insiders that allegedly used the business to
enrich their own interests at the expense of the minority shareholders. In my view, what
follows can only be called shocking and disturbing for anyone long RTNB shares.


The lawsuit alleges Grano and Kazeminy were a part of a group that enabled and
benefited from the gross "mismanagement and looting" of the company including
sweetheart deals for insiders, improper and dilutive transactions, and excessive
payments. According to the lawsuit, Grano gained "the trust and confidence" of other
shareholders. Allegedly, "Grano then used that trust - and his relationship with
Kazeminy - to enrich himself while deliberately placing [minority shareholders] at
the mercy of controlling shareholders who Grano knew were hostile" to non-
insiders.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3258735-root9-minus-82_5-percent-downside-on-management-fraud-allegations-cyber-failure-and-bankruptcy-strong-sell


Grano was accused of "fraudulent concealment" and intentionally deceiving minority
shareholders that resulted in their interests being wiped out. In what appears to me an
interesting pattern, Grano seems to have sold a large portion of his shares for $6.5 million
or $4.33 per share and just over a year later minority shareholders received $0.01 per
share resulting in a -99.77% loss on their investment! Recall that Grano is now
aggressively trying to sell his stake in RTNB stock via the recent S-1 filing. Is RTNB
rapidly headed to zero?


Based on my reading of the lawsuit, it's no coincidence the minority shareholders'
investment in the company was allegedly decimated by Grano and his friend Kazeminy
who appear to share a close relationship that includes co-investing in deals together,
sitting on the same advisory boards, etc. In fact, Kazeminy used to fly Grano around on
his private jet, according to the lawsuit.


The lawsuit goes on to claim "breaches of fiduciary duties" and "purposefully nefarious
actions". These claims are incredibly relevant and disturbing for RTNB shareholders, in
my view, given the recent and ongoing attempts of insiders to cash out after engaging in
what I believe were one sided deals to benefit these insiders, as I have outlined
throughout this report.


Questions you should be asking


What is actually happening at RTNB? Why is Grano trying to blow out his stock? Does this
explain the curiously timed and highly questionable "hype machine" press releases RTNB
has recently issued, at the same time insiders have registered to sell their stock?


This is the question: Who in their right mind would want to buy stock from Grano and the
other S-1 sellers listed here?


As the lawsuit alleges, "Grano was richly rewarded when he sold his stock" while other
investors were "decimated." I view RTNB as a high probability bankruptcy eventually given
what I perceive as a clear lack of viability of its products, and poor financial state, and
believe that non-insiders are likely to once again be decimated by taking the other side of
"Grano & Friends".


A product I really love and enjoy, which shareholders taking the other side of Grano's and
RTNB insiders may want to look into purchasing with their RTNB investment, is the One
Trip Grip Bag Holder (pictured below).

Unfortunately, it gets even worse: The RTNB Blech Family Connection


Although there is an overwhelming number of red flags with RTNB that would likely take
regulators months or even years to fully untangle, another huge red flag in broad daylight
is the involvement of the Blech family. Most likely RTNB's largely uninformed retail
shareholder base isn't familiar with the Blech family history, so allow me to shed some
light on these highly questionable characters.


I believe convicted and jailed fraudster David Blech is one of the original "wolves" of the
modern Wall Street era and the way David used family accounts were used is an
"interesting pattern". In the A-Team picture, I believe he most closely resembles Mr. T (no
disrespect to Mr. T intended). Blech seems to be a repeat offender penny-stock
manipulator and apparently a bipolar gambling addict sentenced to jail and lofty multi-
million dollar fines on criminal charges of market manipulation after a judge ruled that his
crimes deserve "no mercy". In fact, the judge recommended Blech serve time in the same
prison as "Fat Man Raj" Rajaratnam, convicted insider trader.

From what I can tell, Blech's business model was to acquire shares inexpensively through
backdoor financing agreements, pump the shares up through manipulative trading in over
50 related-party (mostly family) accounts, and then dump shares on unsuspecting
investors. He did this many times, with many companies, and used a wide variety of his
family members to execute his crimes, something I refer to as "pulling a Nelly" by doing it
"over and over again." David Blech is now in jail for these activities.


A recent 2012 lawsuit that is publicly available on the SEC website that should be read by
everyone includes the following excerpts about the Blech family circle:


involves a complex market manipulation scheme carried out by Blech, an
individual previously convicted of securities fraud and barred from
association with a broker-dealer by the Commission. Since at least 2007, Blech,
in furtherance of the scheme, established over 50 accounts using various nominees
- including Blech's wife, defendant Chassman; Blech's uncle, Aaron Eiger
("Eiger"); Blech's sister-in law, Elizabeth Moore ("Moore")…" and "Blech traded in
the Nominees' [his family members] accounts with the intent to artificially inflate
each company's stock price and to create the false impression of an active and
liquid market…" and on and on…

In addition to accounts in David's wife's name used above, David apparently has a
longtime business association with his brother, Isaac Blech. Given what we know about
his stock market partner and brother above, along with using accounts in family names, I
find it very interesting that Isaac Blech is so deeply involved in RTNB on the board, and
cornerstone investors along with his wife Miriam.


What does it say about RTNB these people are apparently the "best" investors RTNB
could find to partner with? Where are the "real" industry experts or othe credible
investors?

Isaac Blech is the Vice Chairman of RTNB and along with his wife (sound familiar?)
Miriam Blech, is a substantial shareholder in RTNB. We also know Isaac was also named
in some of the David Blech legal documents regarding securities fraud but apparently was
not prosecuted.


Furthermore, Isaac Blech has been involved in other disasters as well, for example Isaac's
involvement as Vice Chairman of Restorgenx (RESX) has been nothing short of a
complete disaster for shareholders as the stock fell a whopping -98.9% (so far) from a
split-adjusted $199 in July of 2010 to a current price of $2 per share.


RESX -98.9% Decline: The future of RTNB?


Source: CapitalIQ


If it were me, I wouldn't in a million years even consider investing even one penny in
RTNB as long as any of the Blech family is involved. RTNB's company filings themselves
seem to agknowledge the risks of Blech involvement, calling them out specifically by
name:


Miriam Blech and Isaac Blech have substantial influence over the business, due to
their large ownership stake in our capital stock, giving them the ability to exert
influence over us to the eteriment of minority shareholders, which will limit
shareholders ability to influence the outcome of key deicision."

Given how the Blech family has apparently "influenced" a number of shareholder wipeouts
in the past, I recommend extreme caution to all current and potential RTNB investors.


The Penny Stock General (of Wipeouts)


Wesley Clark is a Director on the board of RTNB, I speculate to provide some façade of
credibility with retail investors to this obviously absurd shell of a company. RTNB, which
clearly has insane insider compensation for a company that has lost money hand over fist,
paid The Penny Stock General a whopping ~$184,000 in additional compensation since
2012 (see insider compensation chart earlier in this report).


I'm not the first person to identify Wesley Clark's connections to stocks which wipe
shareholders out and face fraud allegations. After leaving the Army, Wesley had the goal
of "making $40 million," apparently by any means necessary given his involvment in an
uncanny amount of penny stock fail. Bloomberg Business did a great job uncovering
related shenanigans in this article that reveals Clark's ties to numerous bankruptcies and a
CEO who pled guilty to fraud. In fact, Clark's ties are so crazy that one of his colleagues
apparently formed the basis for the character Bud Fox in the famous movie Wall Street,
due to ties to Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Clark also served as Chairman of the
notorious and now bankrupt Rodman & Renshaw investment bank where analysts and the
chief compliance officer were fined and suspended from the securities industry by FINRA .
Apparently, all this disaster is highly lucrative business for Clark though who I estimate
makes as much as $250,000 per board appointment.


When confronted about alleged China stock frauds that Rodman & Renshaw participated
in under Clark's watch, Clark apparently refused to comment. Denial is not just a river in
Egypt!


The Penny Stock General: Just Say No

Hilariously, even after all of the above Clark is apparently proud of his "business record".

RTNB: Just Another Worthless Penny Stock Hype Machine?


Despite the shocking mess of awfulness that is RTNB, it gets even worse. After some
additional digging, it appears to me RTNB is also associated with members of a number
notorious stock promotion outfits, including Proactive Capital and Alliance Advisors.


The Unfortunate Proactive Capital Connection at RTNB


We know the Proactive Capital Group were famously humiliated for their role in a number
of promotion stocks, including Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS), a stock exposed several times
(including by me) for pillaging its shareholders and coming under investigation by the SEC
as it fumbles onward towards its own bankruptcy.


RTNB used to be called "Premier Alliance Group" before recently changing its name,
where Proactive Capital acted as IR firm. Also concerning, Proactive Capital and its
founder Jeff Ramson filed to sell 100% of their shares in RTNB as recently as May 1st,
2015.

Jeff also has what I consider to be a very "remarkable" past. When Jeff was the CEO of
the Great Eastern Securities Inc. brokerage firm, his firm the notorious Luchese and
Bonanno families accused of being involved with "mafia style" organized crime were
associated with his firm. To quote a publicly available article citing lawsuits:


"As part of their criminal activity, between 1994 and 2004, the mobsters 'controlled stock
promoters, brokerage firm owners and brokerage firm principals, brokers, traders and
other employees' of 15 branch offices" through violence and coercion.


Furthermore:


The defendants reportedly used both licensed and unlicensed brokers and cold
callers to flog more than a dozen penny stocks, most of them trading on the lightly
regulated and heavily prosecuted OTC Bulletin Board, in which the mobsters had
manage to acquire large blocks of cheap shares."


And perhaps most shockingly:


To protect their financial interest in and to ensure the success of these criminal
schemes, the defendants exploited their affiliation with organized crime to control
and discipline stock promoters, brokerage firm owners, brokers, cold callers, and
other employees at the brokerage firms through extortionate tactics, including
threats of physical harm, beatings and stabbings," the U.S. Attorney says."


Apparently, in order to pursue a "'pump-and-dump' scheme, the defendants purchased
vast quantities of low-prospect stocks, then cold-called investors and tricked them into
buying in and driving up the price.

A portion of this criminal enterprise apparently took place in connection with alleged
purchases and sales of securities at Great Eastern, while Jeff Ramson was CEO. Note
that Great Eastern itself was apparently not charged with any wrongdoing, nor was Jeff
Ramson. But how could the CEO not know what was happening at his own brokerage
business? Especially if people were seemingly getting beaten and stabbed along with all
this other craziness allegedly going on? And how did Jeff then go on to promote numerous
companies with SEC investigations and fraud allegations? You can make your own
decisions but to me these are obviously not the type of people I would want to invest with
or buy stock from.


Alan Sheinwald of SEC Lawsuit Infamy: Also Registered and Trying to Sell You His
RTNB Stock


Picture Credit


Alan Sheinwald runs Alliance Advisors, LLC, which was sued by the SEC for its
participation as an unregistered securities broker for a Chinese reverse merger company
that collapsed in 2009 with reports of fraud concerning its chief executive officer.
According to the lawsuit:


"Sheinwald assisted China Yingxia and received transaction-based compensation in
connection with two successful capital campaigns in which the Company raised
approximately $10.7 million for US-based investors." Further, Yingxia signed an
"agreement that provided that, in exchange for $8,500 per month 'credit to account
of Alliance Advisors' plus an allotment of China Yingxia shares, [Alliance] would
develop, implement, and maintain an ongoing stock market support system for
China Yingxia…"


Alan Sheinwald has also filed to sell 100% of his RTNB shares to anyone foolish enough
to buy them.

that I exposed last year prior to its collapse.


Based on this it seems obvious to me all investors should avoid any involvement
whatsoever with any company that Alan Sheinwald and Alliance Advisors are supporting.


RTNB's "Cyber products": A Complete Joke And Upsetting To the Cyber

RTNB claims to have an advanced cyber security product offering, but has recently been
exposed by insiders in the cyber community as being dubious. Specifically, famous cyber
industry expert and security genius Brian Krebs recently appeasr to have debunked claims
made by Root 9 related to an alleged Russian cyber-criminal attack.


Given the questionable timing of RTNB's "hype machine" press releases while insiders
register to sell stock. Let's take a closer look at what is actually going on by looking at this
as a timeline:


4/30/2015 and 5/1/2015: RTNB and the "A-Team" insiders file to sell vast quantities of
shares with the SEC. Importantly, the prospectus says, "We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of these securities." which means all of the shares sold will benefit insiders
exclusively and not the company in anyway. This is a highly questionable move given that
RTNB is badly undercapitalized and is burning cash at an alarming rate. If RTNB had such
revolutionary cyber products then why are they in such a hurry to sell hand over fist at
$1.75 and lower?


5/12/2015: RTNB releases a highly suspect press release touting Root, but which Cyber
experts later debunked. From RTNB's release:


"While none of the targeted organizations are clients of root9B, we felt it imperative to
disclose the findings to them…" said Hipkins. That's probably because these customers
are using real cyber security products such as possibly those offered by Palo Alto
Networks (NYSE:PANW) and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE)! It's absurd to me to think that a
large bank such as any of those mentioned in the press release would ever think of using
RTNB. I would like to take this opportunity to dedicate a magical song by Aerosmith to the
entire "A-Team" at RTNB.


5/19/2015: RTNB stock rallies close to the $2.50 preferred share conversion price (see
below) set to unleash an avalanche of stock for sale and insider enrichment. Any
unsuspecting retail investor purchasing shares at this price because of the original press
release is immediately and severely bagged.


5/20/2015: Krebs thoroughly and completely debunks RTNB's absurd claims:


Unless the company (OTC:RTNB) is holding back key details about their research,
their definition of APT can more accurately be described as "African Phishing
Threat."

But root9B appears to have scant evidence connecting the individual(s) who registered
those domains to the Sofacy APT gang.


From what I can tell, the vast majority of the report documents activity stemming from
Nigerian scammers who have been conducting run-of-the-mill bank phishing scams for
almost a decade now and have left quite a trail."


Where I'm from, that's called RTNB getting pwned by the truth. Furthermore, I've heard of
anti-phishing software: I get mine from McAfee and it costs me $4.98 per year.


Further quoting Krebs:


I wanted to know if I was alone in finding fault with the root9B report, so I reached
out to Jaime Blasco, vice president and chief scientist at AlienVault - one of the
security firms that first published the initial findings on the Sofacy/APT28 group back
in October 2014. Blasco called the root9B research "very poor". Actually, there isn't
a link between what root9B published and Sofacy activity," he said. "The only
link is there was a DNS server that was used by a Sofacy domain and the banking
stuff root9B published. It doesn't mean they are related by any means. I'm really
surprised that it got a lot of media attention due to the poor research they did, and
[their use] of [terms] like 'zeroday hashes' in the report really blew my mind. Apart
from that it really looks like a 'marketing report/we want media coverage asap,'
since days after that report they published their Q1 financial results and
probably that increased the value of their penny stocks."


In my view, there is just no reason to issue the type of press release that cyber security
experts know is obviously inaccurate unless you are trying to blow out of your stock, which
as we have seen, RTNB insiders are very aggressively trying to do right now.


Cyber Community has "never heard" of RTNB?


Furthermore, there are some interesting comments from people who are actually in the
cyber community in the article debunking RTNB's claims:


"I live in Colorado Springs and we have a strong ISSA chapter here. I have never
heard of this company. Looking at their website at their many "offices" really casts
doubt, especially when they evidently have less than 50 employees. [Author's note:
A large number of these employees do not work in the RTNB cyber business at all,
so really this number is much smaller than 50]."

I'll ask the two questions on everyone's mind:


Does RTNB even have a real cyber product?


2. If the answer to 1. is "Yes," then why are insiders trying to blow out of 10,000,000
million shares for their own benefit?


These questions answer themselves, in my view, but I would encourage all employees of
the company to ask this question as well since I believe the majority of employees at
RTNB are likely honest people unaware of the shenanigans that could leave them holding
the bag.

RTNB Failing Internally: RTNB Employees State Management "Full of False
Promises" with "No Niche"


To understand what is going on internally at RTNB, let's take a closer look at RTNB's own
employee internal sentiment based on glassdoor.com, where the company seems to have
a 2/5 star rating from its own employees (emphasis mine):

http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/root9B-Reviews-E884014.htm
5/22/2018 ROOT9: -82.5% Downside On Management Fraud Allegations, Cyber Failure And Bankruptcy - Strong Sell - root9B Technologies, Inc. (…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3258735-root9-minus-82_5-percent-downside-on-management-fraud-allegations-cyber-failure-and-bankruptcy-strong-sell


"Cons: The good people that were initially convinced to join by fast-talking higher-
ups have either left or are on the way out. Everyone has lost complete faith in the
leadership team and realizes they are at best full of false promises or at worst
delusional. The next deal is always "right around the corner" or "coming on fast," but
little ever materializes. The same goes for organizational changes. Management is
opaque,…


Cons: The company has no niche, and because of this they have lost most of their
technical talent. [-] Top level folks are full of open promises. During my entire time
there, they were unable to follow through on most of their promises. [-] Lack of work.
Went over 2 months without any operational work.


Cons: No overarching strategy or vision is present... "


Note these are comments from the people who make up RTNB itself and RTNB is a tiny
company. In fact, RTNB's CEO has a one of the worst employee ratings I've ever seen: a
dismal 34% approval rating on glassdoor. In my view, there are likely to be a lot of
innocent folks left holding the bag both in and outside the company.


Don't take my word for it, I talked to RTNB's CFO and he didn't even know RTNB's
"cyber" product name!


Since RTNB's "cyber" product is so obviously a bad joke while the cyber community and
RTNB's employees are publicly upset, I felt compelled to double check with the company
in case I missed something, how can there be nothing of value at RTNB. I called Ken
Smith, RTNB's CFO to get more perspective on the paltry $4.07 million in shrinking,
unprofitable cyber revenue and the company's product claims.


I was told a large portion of "cyber" was actually a one-time low margin hardware
installation, projects RTNB will be apparently moving away from going forward so it seems
we can expect even more cyber revenue declines. Best I can tell, another component of
revenue is largely what appears to me an old training and certification service for a
product RTNB acts as a reseller for. During our conversation, RTNB's CFO Ken didn't
even seem to know what the product was called! RTNB's investor presentation is also
literally one of the worst presentations I've ever seen in my life, full of useless blathering
about the "TAM" and listing global issues without discussing what RTNB actually does in
any useful detail and ZERO discussion of any of RTNB's financials or investment aspects
at all!

Doing more work, despite CFO's apparent ignorance and vague company rambling, it
appears to meRTNB's cyber claims are also based on a product called Digital Shield,a
product RTNB resells, and installs for other companies and municipalities with a price
point of $3,600 - RTNB is going to have to do an impossible amount of reselling this old
"training module" to justify the current market capitalization of $134 million!


In my view, the level of incompetence here even rivals that of The KEYW Holding
Corporation (NASDAQ:KEYW), another company with incompetent management and a
failing cyber product I previously exposed here. Similarly, it seems clear both KEYW and
RTNB are likely to fail and wipe out their shareholders.


Preferred $2.50 Share Conversion = No Upside for RTNB Stock


In 2011, RTNB issued 2,380,952 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the Blech family
for approximately $3 million. SEC filings show that these warrants convert automatically to
3 shares of common stock if RTNB trades above $2.50 for 30 consecutive trading days.
Not only does this indicate massive dilution is coming if the stock ever does trade up, it
means RTNB shares effectively have a ceiling already priced in. After the recent
"questionable" press releases, the stock immediately bounced off $2.45, which I view as
no coincidence. The stock that comes to mind for this type of selling pressure is Glori
Energy (GLRI), which I debunked last year and in which shareholders who ignored my
report met swift and brutal capital losses, and in my view, will end up bankrupt alongside
RTNB, KEYW, CDZI and others.


In connection with the Series C Preferred Stock, 3 warrants with an exercise price of
$0.77 expire in 5 years from the issue date. The Series B Preferred Stock has similar
dynamics except the shares automatically convert at a 1 to 1 ratio upon the stock price
exceeding $2.50 on any given day. Together, both of these preferred classes of stock
create a significant supply overhang and a ceiling in the stock price as millions of shares
would be created and insiders would likely be ready to begin selling their shares to retail
investors. As absurd as it is it ponder the idea of RTNB being worth $2.50 per share for
the right to own a collection of lousy businesses operated by overpaid insiders with a
history of fraud, I estimate that it would take years to liquidate the Series C Preferred's in
the open market in an orderly fashion. If liquidity were to dry up, for whatever reason, it
could take much, much longer than that.


In my view, based on this incredibly generous preferred share capital structure, RTNB has
basically given the company away to these highly questionable insiders. Based on all of
the proceeding information in this report, I think it's very clear that insiders are incredibly

desperate for the stock to get to $2.50 by any means necessary so that they can convert
their warrants for incredibly lucrative gains and enormous upside for themselves
personally. Of course this means shareholders who are not part of the "A-Team" of
insiders would get buried in a tidal wave of dilution, but hey, caveat emptor, right?! Don't
worry though, you would still apparently get a cyber security training course that helps
detect phishing threats.


RTNB Fair-Value Analysis: Current -82.47% Downside, Shareholder Wipeout Likely


Perhaps the most absurd part of this whole debacle is that even if you assume RTNB is a
"real" business lead by honest people AND the current trajectory of failure turns around,
fair value STILL shows RTNB is worth a maximum of $0.337 per share for immediate
-82.47% downside today.


(estimate chart built by me)


RTNB Value Based on Acquired Business Purchase Price: -83.04% Immediate
Downside


Another way to see what RTNB is truly worth is to look at the price RTNB paid for the
businesses which currently make up RTNB. In my view, it's clear they have overpaid for
these businesses and destroyed capital, a view their own goodwill write-downs also
support. However, even if we assume RTNB management are honest deal makers and
the deteriorating businesses they have acquired are worth what they paid for them, RTNB
still has -83.04% downside. Stated another way, how is it possible RTNB's deteriorating
businesses are suddenly worth 350-400%+ what they just recently paid for them?

(estimate chart built by me off Capiq numbers)


Further supporting this fair value valuation, RTNB just recently last year was trading at
~$0.52 per share and since then has diluted investors considerably more and destroyed
value with more overpriced acquisitions that enrich insiders.


Picture Credit


My price target for RTNB is one hundred trillion Zimbabwe dollars, or $0.0000 per share
but when all is said and done, I believe it is obvious RTNB faces inevitable bankruptcy.


Given the countless penny-stock wipeouts and fraud allegations this team has been
involved in though, I believe the clear outcome here is that as RTNB fundamentals
continue to deteriorate insiders will get even richer and the stock will go to ~$0. I believe
this is likely why insiders are trying to sell their 10m RNTB shares right now and I would
do the same if in their position.
