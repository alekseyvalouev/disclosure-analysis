Why Did Flotek Soar 46%?

Summary


Shares of Flotek soared by as much as 46% on what looked like a surprise earnings
beat.


However the “beat” was a result of a single customer who accounted for nearly 20%
of revenues.


That customer was under a long-term contract which expired in April, jamming 20%
of revenues for Flotek into a single month, which will not be repeated.


Even with the surprise contract sales, Flotek was forced to engage in heavy
discounting.


Without the one-time boost, Flotek actually recorded a very heavy “miss” on
earnings and on sales volume.

Approximately 65% of the company's revenues are derived from its Energy Chemistry
Technologies ("ECT") segment, which includes chemicals for specialized enhanced and
improved oil recovery markets ("EOR" or "IOR").


The company's key branded product line (within ECT) is its CnF ("Complex nano-Fluids")
line which is designed to be environmentally friendly, stable mixtures of oil, water and
surface active agents which organize molecules into nano structures. The result is
enhanced recovery from treated wells.


From the company website


The CnF® suite of technologies increases production while protecting the
environment. An alternative to toxic chemicals, CnF® technologies are a bio-based,
nontoxic technology that is developed from citrus fruit. We put d-Limonene, an
industry-proven solvent extracted from oranges, into our CnF® technologies to
facilitate the extraction of oil from formations, so you get higher production without
toxic chemicals.


Investment overview


On July 22nd, shares of Flotek Industries closed at $12.79, closing in on lows not seen
since 2012. The next day, the company reported a surprisingly strong beat on its quarterly
earnings announcement. The stock jumped to as high as $18.64 - a gain of as much as
46% for the day as investors registered their strong approval.


One key reason for the bullish response was that Flotek recorded a positive revenue beat
in an environment of declining oil activity across the board. But even more important was
the performance of CnF.


Flotek itself noted that "based on volume, Flotek's second quarter CnF sales grew 76%
sequentially and 34% year-over-year in a market in which activity has declined between
40% and 60% depending on your favored metric."


Management also noted that:

There is absolutely no doubt, the Flotek's Energy Chemistry Technologies segment
and more specifically growing acceptance of Flotek's CnF completion chemistries
drove the Company's strong second quarter performance. Moreover, as we noted
last night, there is a little down in our mind that CnF has now reached the tipping
point in most North American basins which suggests operators are more inclined to
consider using CnF than not. The growth in CnF volumes provides strong support for
that statement.


Author Kevin Quon was then quick to amplify this view in an article entitled, "Flotek Rises
On The Growing Success Of Its Energy Chemistry Segment."


Unfortunately, for those who are now long the stock, a closer read of various filings and
documents shows that the "beat" due to Energy Chemistry was entirely engineered and
the reported level of performance will not be continued or repeated.


We are not at a "tipping point." It is still the case that a weak environment for oil
producers results in predictably weak sales of CnF.


Based on the information below, Flotek should be expected to fall to well below its
starting level of $12.79 - a decline of 20-30%. This is because the "beat" was
actually a sizeable "miss" in disguise.


Here are the 4 reasons why we will quickly see a sharp drop in Flotek:


1. Flotek's "beat" was entirely the result of one unnamed customer who produced a
massive last minute surge in purchases. These purchases amounted to fully 19.5% of all
revenues and were concentrated almost completely in the Energy Chemistries Technology
segment (i.e. they were almost entirely for CnF).


2. The surge in purchases appears to be part of a 3-year old contract that was actually
expiring this quarter. (the purchases were not normal, were not representative and will
not be repeated).


3. Contrary to management statements, the surge in revenues was actually the result of
heavy discounting.


4. Without the purchases of the mystery customer, Flotek would have recorded revenues
of just $70 million - a 15% decline vs. Q1 and not the 5% increase that management has
touted. This represents a 33% decline year over year.

First off, let's look more closely at the unnamed customer. In recent filings, the customer is
referred to as "Customer A," but in prior filings it appears that the same customer was
referred to as "Customer B."


Flotek only discloses two major customers over the past 3 years. The other customer (not
this mystery customer) is widely known to be Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). Halliburton has
been a consistent customer at around 16% of revenues. In the 10-K, which shows
customer breakdown for the past 3 years, it is clear that Halliburton is Customer A. For the
two recent 10-Q filings, it is also clear from the history that Halliburton is now Customer B,
because it appears in every 3 and 6-month breakdown.


A review of the filings and other documents shows that it is quite clear that the other
customer was Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD).


Pioneer and Flotek signed a 3-year purchase agreement back in May of 2012. As shown,
that agreement was set to expire in April of 2015.


When the agreement began, we can see that there were large purchases (amounting to
10% of revenues) by a new customer described as "Customer B." But in subsequent
periods those purchases quickly declined to the point where they did not need to be
disclosed.


In the recent 10-Q for 2Q 2015, we can see that a new customer makes an appearance
again who had not been a 10% customer in 2014. The new customer (Pioneer) becomes
Customer A, while Halliburton has been renamed to Customer B.


In the prior 10-Q for Q1, we can see that Pioneer provided 12% of revenues. In prior
periods, purchases from Pioneer were too small to be disclosed.


Question: how unnatural were these purchases by Pioneer?

The point of this section is to demonstrate that the sudden surge of purchases were
unnatural and were related to the fulfillment of an expiring contract. This is what led the
surge in CnF revenues for Flotek. But far from being a "tipping point," it was a one time,
end-of-contract purchase which will not be repeated.


The chart below comes from FracFocus. It shows that completions using citrus terpenes
FELL from 330 in December 2014 down to 108 by May 2014.


This is a decline of 67% between December and May. This sharp level of decline is
basically in line with management's estimate about drilling and production activity falling
by 40-60%.


More important is the data as it applies specifically to Flotek's new largest customer,
Pioneer. The next table below shows two things:


First, between Q4 of 2014 and May of 2015 (the end of the contract between Pioneer and
Flotek), Pioneer's number of citrus terpene completions more than quadrupled from 7 to
31.


Second, by 2Q 2015, Pioneer suddenly had 31 completions - the largest number of
completions of any driller - and by a 50% margin!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3368685-why-did-flotek-soar-46-percent 6/12


So even as the rest of the space shows a dramatic decline in completions using citrus
terpenes, Pioneer showed a one-time surge, suddenly making it the largest customer of
Flotek.


How heavy was the discounting required to generate this volume?


On its quarterly conference call, management stated that, "based on volume, Flotek's
second quarter CnF sales grew 76% sequentially and 34% year-over-year."


Yet we can see that CnF revenues actually FELL by 9.7% year over year, despite the
34% rise in volume. The result is that these volumes were only possible despite
discounting within Energy Chemistry Technologies of around 33%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3368685-why-did-flotek-soar-46-percent 7/12


Investors should keep in mind that this heavy discounting was required even though
Flotek had the 3-year contract with Pioneer that was expiring in April and which resulted in
an unnatural, one-time boost to revenues.


As a result of this heavy discounting, Flotek's gross margin within the Energy Chemistry
Technologies division fell from 43.8% last year to 36.2% in the most recent quarter.


Conclusion


The bull case on Flotek is heavily dependent upon CnF reaching a "tipping point." The
reason why the stock soared by as much as 46% was that CnF apparently showed rising
sales despite sharply declining production activity in the oil space.


Yet a closer look reveals that this was not the case.


Pioneer's 3-year contract was expiring in April, resulting in a surge of last minute
purchases to fulfill the contract. We can see clearly from the data above that the surge in
purchases by Pioneer was very much unnaturally large. It was overly large relative to past
completions by Pioneer and it was also overly large relative to completions by others in
the space.


Yet even with that unnatural, one-time boost, Flotek was forced to engage in heavy
discounting of around 33% in order to maintain volumes.


Without the benefit of this one-time purchase, we can see that overall revenues would
have fallen by 33%, primarily attributable to CnF.


We can already see that the stock is starting to retreat from the $18.64 spike it hit after
earnings. This is likely the result of investors starting to realize the one-time nature of the
revenues.


The real result for Q2 should be viewed as a "miss" not a "beat." Investors should expect
to see the stock correct an additional 20-30% from here, breaking back below the $12.79
level where they started.
