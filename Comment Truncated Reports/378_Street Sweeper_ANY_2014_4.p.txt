Sphere 3D: A Ticking Time Bomb Set To Self-Destruct?
Jul. 24, 2014 12:31 PM ET40 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Sphere 3D has achieved phenomenal gains with the relentless support of a
conflicted portfolio manager suspected of stock manipulation in the past.


Even with that former regulatory target blowing millions on stocks that his firm owns,
Sphere 3D ranks as a rare winner in that ugly portfolio.


With Sphere 3D set to close an overhyped merger deal, much of its stock will soon
land in the hands of a less supportive firm with clear incentive to sell.


Sphere 3D (Nasdaq: ANY; TSXV: ANY.V) can thank a former regulatory target with a
lousy trading record for much of the buying pressure that has allowed its highflying stock
to resist the forces of gravity.


With Sphere 3D ranking as a standout performer in the portfolio that determines the size
of his annual bonus, Pinetree Capital CEO Sheldon Inwentash has repeatedly stepped
forward to bolster the value of that risky investment by purchasing much of the stock that
others have chosen to sell. Just go back a few weeks ago for a particularly striking
example. When TheStreetSweeper published the latest in a string of reports on Sphere
3D earlier this month, Inwentash responded by purchasing so much stock that he literally
wound up buying more than half of all the shares that changed hands on the open market
that day. (The next section of this report presents a full account of those trades in graphic
detail.)


A former penny stock that barely topped the 50-cent mark as recently as last summer,
Sphere 3D rocketed all the way to a record-breaking high above $11 a share with the help
of that powerful buying spree.


Sphere 3D better hope that it fares a whole lot better than most of the other stocks that
Inwentash has purchased after Pinetree blew millions on their ill-fated shares, however.
Just look at the performance of the investments that cost Pinetree the most. Even with
Inwentash splurging on all of those stocks himself - often at prices well above those
fetched on the open market today - most of them still trade in the low end of their 52-week
range.

Dangerous Firepower?


With its share price recently exploding into the double digits, and its stock currently trading
near the top of its 52-week range - an incredibly wide span that stretches all the way from
52 cents to $11.20 a share - Sphere 3D easily stands out as a rare winner in the crowd of
losing penny stocks that Pinetree has stuffed into its portfolio. Unable to maintain its
breathless momentum, however, Sphere 3D has finally started to display some early signs
of vulnerability itself. Down almost 20% from the lofty high that it set just a few weeks ago,
Sphere has fallen back into the single digits and now trades below the prices that
Inwentash paid when executing all six of his last open-market trades.

Pinetree itself sure has racked up steady gains throughout that frenetic buying spree,
though. Since Pinetree paid barely $5 a share for its original stake in Sphere 3D - already
trading 50% higher on the day that it first announced that multimillion-dollar position - the
firm has managed to practically double the value of that lucrative investment (on paper, at
least), with its CEO relentlessly buying the stock and supporting its share price along the
way.


Look how much of the stock Inwentash bought from others willing to sell, though.

* Dates when TheStreetSweeper published articles about the company


Thanks to that buying spree, Sphere 3D has bolstered the confidence of retail investors
who feel reassured to see the CEO purchase so much of that highflying stock - without
fully appreciating his likely influence on the rising share price - and even inspired them
enough to follow his potentially dangerous lead. Despite all of the losing bets that Pinetree
and its leader have placed on the stocks in its portfolio, the firm still manages to win plenty
of respect from admirers who seemingly never bothered to do their homework.


Take The Midas Letter, a promotional "research" publication that caters to retail investors
with favorable coverage of microcap companies. While The Midas Letter included Sphere
3D in a bullish report designed to highlight the 10 most promising Canadian technology
stocks, it actually seemed rather unimpressed with the bleeding rollup company until it
noticed that Pinetree had gambled a fortune on its highflying shares.


"Frankly, I can't understand why the valuation and its technology is esoteric, to say the
least, with a value proposition that strikes me as modest at best," The Midas Letter
conceded. "That being said, I will be conducting a CEO pod-cast with the company's
president, Peter Tassiopolous, later this week. And I'll see if I can begin to wrap my head
around what's got Pinetree Capital sufficiently intrigued to buy 12% of the company if it
exercises all options and warrants.


"To see Pinetree buying stock in the market at this high valuation is a very bullish signal in
my mind," it then concluded, "as the fund is not known for making foolish wagers."


Talk about a generous compliment. Displaying either ignorance or - even worse -- a
reckless disregard for the truth, as evidenced by the figures that Pinetree has published
on its own website (and TheStreetSweeper has further dissected below), The Midas Letter
sure offered some rather high praise for an investment firm with such a horrible track
record.

In contrast, The Midas Letter literally ridiculed TheStreetSweeper after it published an
investigative report on another overhyped Canadian stock that managed to stage a decent
comeback (thanks to some rather curious buying pressure of its own) but has long since
lost that useless war. An overhyped graphite miner that peaked at $5 a share last
summer, back when Sphere 3D itself still traded as a lowly penny stock, Zenyatta (TSXV:
ZEN.V) sells for less than half of that price right now.


The same critic recently blasted TheStreetSweeper after reading its latest report on
Sphere 3D, too.


Total Meltdown


While Zenyatta has obviously endured a brutal correction, many of the companies that
Pinetree owns have actually fared a whole lot worse. Of the 20 stocks that Pinetree
identifies as its largest investments right now, in fact, only Sphere 3D and two other
companies (one of them a volatile microcap name and the other a technology firm that
seems worthy of intense scrutiny, too) have managed to avoid significant losses -- most of
them downright horrific -- since landing in the firm's portfolio


Look how much those big-ticket investments have plummeted in value to date.

No wonder an astute portfolio manager has labeled Pinetree "possibly the worst closed-
end fund - ever." In a scathing review published just a few months before Pinetree
announced that it had established sizable positions in both Sphere 3D and Poet
Technologies (TSXV: PTK.V) (the latter since exploding into its biggest winner of all
despite its total absence of revenue) that Canadian fund manager declared the firm an
outright "train wreck" after scrutinizing its horrible track record.


"The company functionally operates as a closed-end fund that invests in extremely risky
microcap ventures in the mining sector," he explained last November. "I've analyzed this
one many, many years ago and dismissed the idea for obvious reasons. Nothing much
has changed since then, other than that management has blown about half-a-billion
dollars. This is an accomplishment that very few non-fraud artists can claim …


"Management is entrenched in the company, and they make a pretty profit from simply
being there … Suffice it to say, pulling a cool million a year out of this train wreck is rivaling
what Robert Mugabe has done to Zimbabwe over the past few decades. (NYSE:SO)
management has a clear incentive to seeing that this train wreck continues as long as
possible.


"It is a million-dollar-per-year vehicle to extract capital out of unwitting investors. (But) it is
clear that nobody rational would ever want to own the common shares of the business."


Simmering Threat?


Investors might see no reason to place risky bets on Sphere 3D, either. To be sure, Cyrus
Capital hardly seems inclined to follow in the footsteps of Pinetree when it soon emerges
as the largest shareholder of the overvalued technology company.


If anything, in fact, Cyrus looks far more inclined to simply dump that expensive stock and
bank the hefty proceeds instead.


A fund manager that specializes in debt financing for distressed companies, Cyrus has
already wound up stuck with equity in two bleeding technology firms that needed help and
fell under its control. After facilitating (if not orchestrating) an overhyped merger between
Sphere 3D and the second of those struggling firms, Cyrus now stands to receive a hefty

18.2% stake in the resulting company - generously valued at a combined $265 million by
the market right now - as soon as that pending transaction officially closes sometime
before the current quarter draws to an end.


Still paying for an old mistake that effectively forced the firm to accept stock in a company
unable to pay its debts off in cash, Cyrus has spent the better part of a decade basically
recycling equity that it never really wanted in the first place. So don't feel surprised if Cyrus
jumps at the chance to sell its lucrative stake in Sphere 3D - worth a tantalizing $50 million
at current market prices - when presented with such an attractive exit strategy.


After all, Cyrus has waited an awful long time for that sort of opportunity.


Start with the original transaction that left Cyrus in control of a broke technology company.
Way back in the summer of 2006, Cyrus provided the funds that allowed Tandberg to
purchase fading Exabyte - a former highflier well past its prime - in a deal that the media
would later declare a "colossal mistake." Already vulnerable enough on its own, Tandberg
sank beneath the weight of that extra burden for several years before finally spiraling into
bankruptcy when it ran out of money to cover its onerous debt load.


Inheriting the mess that it helped facilitate, Cyrus spent the next three years fruitlessly
waiting for Tandgerg to recover and survive on its own. Clearly out of patience by early
last year, Cyrus finally gave up and arranged for Tandberg to merge with Overland
Storage (Nasdaq: OVRL) - yet another bleeding technology player unable to properly
support itself - in an all-stock transaction that left the firm with a controlling interest in the
latter company instead.


Even without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, some experts regarded that merger as a
dangerous plan.


"The two firms are not in good shape at all," one industry publication emphasized ahead of
that deal. "Will the combination of these two old U.S. and German storage companies
reverse the trend? We doubt (NYSE:IT)."


Cyrus never bothered to wait around for an answer. Less than six months into that
challenging marriage, Cyrus fell in love with a more attractive prospect instead. Rushing to
capitalize on the cozy relationship that Overland had established with Sphere 3D - a
recent penny stock rapidly soaring toward double-digit territory - Cyrus threw its powerful
support behind an overhyped merger that would allow the firm to swap its majority interest
in Overland for a smaller, but incredibly lucrative, stake in Sphere 3d worth a whole lot
more.

Talk about a clever move. Stuck with equity in cash-strapped technology companies ever
since Tandberg defaulted on that $23 million loan five years earlier, Cyrus had just struck
a deal that would provide the firm with a valuable stake in Sphere 3D that's now worth
more than double that amount. Once that pending transaction officially closes, Cyrus
might feel understandably tempted to start unloading that huge pile of stock, since the firm
stands to book a tidy profit even if it hammers the shares in the process.


Pinetree better watch out. No matter how much stock that its CEO rushes out to buy on
the open market, Pinetree cannot possibly offset the intense selling pressure that Sphere
3D would endure if Cyrus started liquidating a massive stake in the company that's
virtually twice as large as its own.


Regulatory Heat


Once a celebrated highflier itself, Pinetree actually caught the attention of authorities at
the Ontario Securities Commission - who suspected both the firm and its CEO of
manipulating stocks that it held in its portfolio during the "glory days" that preceded its
collapse. Displaying the same kind of resilience that Sphere 3D would later enjoy,
Pinetree survived jarring news of that investigation without any damage after a conflicted
stock picker staged a dramatic rescue of its own pricey shares.


An influential promoter who trumpeted Pinetree as one of his favorite names at the time -
and reportedly stood to profit from its winning streak - James Dines responded to news of
that regulatory probe by urging his followers to "back up the truck" and buy even more
stock in the embattled firm. Thanks to that helpful intervention, Pinetree swiftly recovered
from an early 30% plunge and actually ended the day with a healthy boost to its
phenomenal gains.


Still, even some Pinetree shareholders who normally listened to Pines felt uneasy enough
to act on their queasy gut feelings in this case instead.


"I'm bailing out till the dust settles from the investigation," one shareholder decided a few
weeks later. "I firmly believe that, where there is smoke, there is fire. I love the Dines
newsletter, but you have to remember he is heavily invested (I'm sure) in both companies.
I'm going to take my profits and look elsewhere."


Instead of succumbing to the pressure that normally follows a regulatory bombshell,
however, Pinetree actually stormed even higher in the months that followed - with Dines
dutifully singing its praises along the way - before reality ever began to take its inevitable
toll. While the stock would soon plunge into the low single digits and keep right on sinking

to its current home below 50 cents a share, Pinetree managed to rocket all the way to a
record-breaking high above $16 a share by the time that the company finally ran out of
luck.


With Pinetree achieving such lofty highs even after the Ontario Securities Commission
started investigating the firm and its CEO for suspicious trading, the media started hunting
for potential motives behind the ringing endorsements that helped fuel those inexplicable
gains. That exercise proved quite revealing, as illustrated by the striking conflicts exposed
below.


"There's nothing better than having someone influential recommending your stock to retail
investors," The Globe and Mail determined after completing its fruitful research. "Take
James Dines, the man behind The Dines Letter - a stock-picking report with a sizable
following …


"These days, (Dines) is touting a company called Mega Uranium Ltd., as well as Pinetree
Capital Ltd., which holds a big stake in Mega and shares the same chairman and CEO …
Why does Mr. Dines like Mega Uranium and Pinetree so much? He didn't respond to
requests for an interview, but he received 150,000 shares of a company called Maple
Minerals Corp. in July 2005 for selling the rights to the name 'Mega Uranium Ltd.' Maple
Minerals of course soon morphed into Mega Uranium, and the share price has climbed
from around $1 since Mr. Dines received his stock to over $6" following his bullish touts.


In other words, by pumping that expensive stock to his dedicated fans, Dines helped push
the value of his own stake in Mega Uranium - effectively received free of charge - all the
way toward the $1 million mark. Who knows how much Dines scored on Pinetree itself?
With that stock racking up even more phenomenal gains, Dines stood to make a serious
fortune on any shares that he owned in Pinetree before convincing his avid fans to "back
up the truck" and buy some more.


Too bad those stocks soon collapsed. Pinetree shifted into freefall mode the following
year, with Mega Uranium promptly taking a similar plunge of its own.


Years later, Pinetree still lists Mega Uranium as the most expensive investment in its entire
portfolio. After placing a $15 million bet on that risky stock and losing almost 80% of that,
Pinetree needs Mega Uranium to explode out of penny-stock territory -- where it has by
now remained stuck for years -- and stage a miraculous rally just to get its money back.
