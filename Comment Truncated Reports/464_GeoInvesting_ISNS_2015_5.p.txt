Reassessing Image Sensing
Systems – ISNS Story
July 31, 2015 By GeoTeam


GeoInvesting was once bearish on Image Sensing
Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ISNS) due to the irrational move
the stock made when the body worn camera hype lifted a
broad basket of stocks with video/security business
segments. Shares moved from $2.38 to $9.94 in 6 days.
  We published our short thesis article on September 4,
2014 when the stock was trading ~$8.00. Now, after the
company reported strong bottom line Q2 2015 results and
offered some commentary indicating that a turn-around
process may be in place, we are taking a closer look at the
company to determine if there are fundamental reasons to
now be bullish.   From a technical perspective, the year-to-
date chart looks impressive.

Sales of $5.2 million vs $5.9 million in the prior year
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.09 vs loss of $0.20 in the prior
year


Quotes from management included:


“During the second quarter, we continued to see
the results of the actions we’ve taken over the
past few quarters to position ourselves for
profitable growth,” said Dale Parker, Image
Sensing Systems’ interim chief executive officer.
“Margin levels improved significantly in the
second quarter, and we believe that these levels
are sustainable going forward. We have been
successful in building scale into our operating
platform, and we were particularly pleased to see
an adjusted operating profit in the second
quarter, reversing prior period trends. We
continue to see our break-even point improve
and are confident that we will return the
company to historical profitability levels.”


We do not have a position in the stock but will continue our
due diligence and determine what valuation metrics to
apply to shares.
