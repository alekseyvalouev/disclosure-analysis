As Raystream's Customers Mount, So Does Skepticism

Here we are again with another set of customer contracts for Raystream (OTC:RAYS) and
their so called “proprietary real time HD video streaming application.” This past December
they signed the Christian Broadcasting Network (“CBN”) for a “trial run” of their software.
We look forward to hearing what CBNs software experts have to say about their
“proprietary software” or that of Raystream’s dubious beginnings and questionable
characters involved within their operation.


If a trial run wasn’t good enough for the fans of Raystream, the company recently
announced a new “contract” that was signed last week with Grencomm Limited, a media
content company that registered in 2006 but did not become fully operating until 2011. It is
based out of the Caribbean Island Nation of Grenada (population 100,000). We decided
that it was necessary to take a closer look at this Island Nation company and familiarize
ourselves with the “where”, “what”, “when” and “how” of Grencomm.


Many people may not be familiar with Grenada, however, if you’re a Clint Eastwood fan,
you may recall a character he had played called “Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway”. It was
one of the better movies he starred in during the eighties, called “Heart Break Ridge”. The
feature war highlight in the film was loosely based on a U.S. mission to invade Grenada in
1983. Their mission was to save kidnapped American students. However, if Gunnery
Sergeant Highway were investigating Raystream he would send a small recon platoon to
“take them out” because this is what he would find based on our ongoing investigation.


Our preliminary due diligence has revealed that Grencomm's website was established with
godaddy.com on April 29th, 2011. Raystream has claimed that Grencomm.com is
“Grenada's first online television station -- that has an audience spanning across more
than 35 countries”. We were surprised as much as the next investor to learn that all those
nations so quickly had an interest in an English speaking local news channel
broadcasting out of Grenada. In any event, they began broadcast operations on October
1st, 2011. The live streaming channel functions through “LiveStream.com”. They appear to
produce their own local news and program content.


Grencomm is also a reseller of VoIP which they aptly named “RUSH VOIP” which has
three very overpriced service plans. Their top of the line premium service is $69.95 per
month for just 800 minutes, but includes international calling. Grencomm also operates a

brick and mortar Electronics Store out of Bruce Street Mall in St. George's, Grenada ,
selling way overpriced LCD TVs, laptops and mobile phones, among other products,
which appear to have a 300% to 500% retail mark-ups (yes, the prices are in U.S. dollars).
However, while Grencomm can at least boast a price on its products, Raystream doesn’t
seem to offer any clarity on the value of their contracts with customers who will utilize its
“product” based on free and open source software.


The major problems with Grencomm are not their overpriced products and services, or
that this so-called progressive media company website dates back to April of 2011, or that
it has a half-dozen or so dead links on its web-site. The fact of the matter is that we
could not find any income generating ads on their website. Media web-sites rich in content
normally have simple video advertising or links that go to third party on-line vendors. We
question how Grencomm can even afford to pay a significant price for Raystream’s service
when it appears that the company’s business model doesn’t seem to have been currently
setup to generate a significant revenue stream…unless of course you need an overpriced
LCD TV and calling plan.


Furthermore, we performed some additional due diligence leading us to believe that
Grencomm’s relationship with RAYS is paper thin. To verify our suspicions of little
revenue, we called Grencomm and spoke to the only available person, but she was able
to answer some simple questions.


She acknowledged that:


Grencomm is not generating significant revenue
They can’t afford to pay RAYS much money
Due to economic slowdown, Grencomm is experiencing cash flow challenges


We are also not won over by the over-exaggerated statement from Grencomm’s Chief
Financial Officer, Garvy Lousion, who ecstatically said, “Discovering Raystream was a
godsend to us.” Why is the CFO making this statement instead of the Chief Technology
Officer? Maybe the technology officer’s absence explains all of the dead links on
Grencomm’s website. We suggest that investors perform their own due diligence on
Grencomm. Based on the recent price performance of RAYS, maybe they already have.


We also suggest that investors take a sneak peak at the press release that RAYS
promptly issued after last Monday's market close announcing an Evaluation Agreement
with its newest customer, Cinefly. We could not have written a better story line. We
presume this was in response to RAYS shares flirting with breaking down below $1.00.
Once again, RAYS is “partnering” with what looks to be some small time outfit to build its
