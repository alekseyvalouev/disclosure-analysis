Short seller: Best opportunity in
two decades

Once-in-a-generation stock bubbles have formed in three sectors, saysbub
John Fichthorn, co-founder of Dialectic Capital Management: solar
energy, software as service and 3-D printing.


"I can't call the exact top," he said Wednesday. "We think the
opportunity with any kind of reasonable time frame now is really the
best we've seen since starting our firm 10 years ago, and really, since
I've been doing this since '95, and I was a short-seller in the middle of
the Internet bubble. In many ways, this is more compelling 'cause itbub
makes even less sense that we're here today."


On CNBC's "Halftime Report," Fichthorn said the short opportunities
were driven by more than just the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

"To a large degree, easy money drives bubbles," he said. "But here youbub
have a bubble that is largely driven without fundamentals in certainbub
areas, and so you have this crazy, bifurcated market where you've got
incredibly cheap stocks and incredibly expensive stocks, really, inside
the same sector. And when this easy-money period ends, and maybe
even before as we see some of these fundamentals starting to soften,
you're going to have an opportunity to make a lot of money on the
short side."


Three-dimensional printing: "I am short 3D (Systems), and we think the
entire sector is compelling as a short," Fichthorn said, adding that it
"almost looks like a cheap stock."


"The entire industry has basically had, you know, a five to 10 times
multiple expansion on a revenues basis and doesn't generate any
profits. Certainly not any free cash flow," he said. "And 3D Systems just
cut their earnings guidance for the year."

Fichthorn added that three-dimensional printing was an industry with
"low profitability and just captures imaginations, and we think it's
about run its course at this point."


Solar energy: "We think the Chinese solar companies and even some of
the other ones are bigger shorts, although First Solar will have its day
of reckoning, as well," he said, adding that he did not have a position in
First Solar.


One of the biggest problems in the sector was overcapacity, Fichthorn
said, noting that the industry has 60 gigawatts of capacity in the face
of demand below 40 gigawatts.

Fichthorn, who is short the sector but didn't close which companies.

they are now in the cloud, he added.


"So, you've got a more difficult growth model. You've got a less
profitable model. And you have the same multiples you had in the
Internet bubble," he said. "I never thought in my lifetime I would seebub
the Internet bubble opportunity again, and here it is."bub
