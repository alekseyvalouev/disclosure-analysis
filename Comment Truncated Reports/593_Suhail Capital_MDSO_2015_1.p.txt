Medidata: A Short Thesis

Summary


Medidata is another Vertical Life Sciences SAAS that offers a fantastic risk/reward
short opportunity. The shares will fall by 45% over the next 12 months.


After an exhaustive several months of research, we have determined MDSO's TAM
is grossly overstated by a factor of 7x+. This is remarkably even worse than Veeva.


The evidence of the minute size of the non-EDC eClinical market is overwhelming
and irrefutable, and remarkably has gone largely ignored.


There are mounting red flags over the past year that are also impossible to ignore.
Terminating quarterly guidance, eliminating non-rave revenue breakdowns, and
broadening the back-log coverage definition.


The competitve environment outside EDC is a big problem for Medidata, and it is
getting even worse as large pharmas and CROs are opening up to small vendors.
