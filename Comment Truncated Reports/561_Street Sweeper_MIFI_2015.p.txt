Novatel Wireless: A Fundamentally Flawed Business Plan
Feb. 10, 2015 8:00 AM ET33 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Novatel’s biggest revenue generator, MiFi, is fizzling fast amid a shrinking market.
And, consumers are learning they have cheaper, simpler alternatives to MiFi built
into their iPhones.


Novatel’s backup plan, a machine-to-machine corporate service, can’t fill the MiFi
revenue gap. Revenues are miniscule and Novatel will continue to struggle in this
highly competitive arena.


Novatel will open the floodgates in March to millions of insiders’ shares that have
been held back from the market for months.


So, long term, Novatel is saddled with a weak business plan in a highly competitive
market. Near term, it faces the risk of significant insider selling next month.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Novatel Wireless (MIFI) rose from a virtual bodice-ripping, B-grade soap opera star into a
rather proper Wall Street darling in three months, with shares bursting to ~$5.50 for more
than a 78 percent gain.


But while Novatel has recently shed some drama (read the steamy shareholder letter
here), the company remains fundamentally flawed.


The wireless solutions technology provider primarily sells pocket-sized wireless modems
to allow Internet access anywhere and also machine-to-machine modules.


But we don't believe this San Diego, Calif.-based company is likely to return the love
investors have thrown at it recently.


*Why Novatel's biggest revenue generator is unlikely to reach expectations


Novatel is focusing on the MiFi system - a Wifi hot spot provided through a wallet-sized
box that consumers on the go can use to access the Internet with their mobile gadgets.


"They've been doing that for a long time. It's a brutal business. It's always been brutal,"
said a tech analyst who requested anonymity. "The margins are terrible."

In fact, the product produces less than 11 cents to a little over 20 cents for each dollar
sold. The margins improved last quarter - special thanks go to a $2.9 million inventory
write-down and a sale of $2 million in old inventory at near cost.


Indeed, Novatel must hate having a bunch of its obsolete China- and Thailand-made
inventory sitting around. Yet it says "increased competitive pressures" may force more of
these write-downs.


With these historically bad margins and declining revenue grabbing Novatel by the throat,
some leaders wanted to sell the MiFi division last spring, according to sources.


But, of course, the spinoff didn't happen.


*No buyers for MiFi is spooky enough, but there's more


With no other company apparently wanting MiFi, miserable share prices and a poorly
settled class action lawsuit, activist shareholders lobbed a rip-roaring fiery letter, alleging
Novatel had been mismanaged. The company booted executives and directors and
installed new ones, and even replaced its old "NVTL" stock symbol with "MIFI."


Emerging from this soap opera, activist shareholder/interim CEO Alex Mashinsky became
the permanent CEO. Fellow activist shareholder Richard Karp joined him on the board of
directors.


The leadership that emerged from the summer of 2014 bloodbath is now trying to pick up
the sagging MiFi business responsible for nearly 79 percent of Novatel's sales.


But the results have been disappointing.


Last quarter, revenue from MiFi dropped a blistering 59 percent. Yes, compared with a
year ago, MiFi revenue is a whopping $49 million lower. Net losses rose an unspeakable
58 percent to $8.8 million.


Results for the past nine months were slightly worse. So, why did the declines happen?


The company's SEC filings blame "lower sales of mobile broadband devices," and the
M2M result wasn't better due to "decreased sales of embedded products to M2M
customers." This shows customer acceptance problems.

The SEC filings say earlier low sales were "caused by increased market competition at our
largest customer", which is Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and by "lower average sales prices." This
points to the risks - largely beyond the new management's control - of Novatel's reliance
on one customer, as well as the bargain-basement prices caused by waning interest in
Novatel's product.


*Brutal competition, market decline expected


So Novatel is losing the advantage it once enjoyed because it got to the MiFi (or USB
modem dongle) party early. Now, the party is wild and "extremely competitive" - roughly 90
and these include Sony Mobile (NYSE:SNE), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL).


Additionally, this market is falling, according to Strategy Analytics' research.


The mobile broadband modem market fell 17 percent in 2013, and the 2014 decline is
expected to be even worse - a 24 percent drop. Though mobile hotspot routers were
considered the bright point, overall industry sales are predicted to plunge to half of the
2010 levels.


So, Novatel and its market rivals will chase fewer and fewer dollars.


*Most daunting: Hotspot tech is already built in


An analyst, who said he tossed out his MiFi box some time ago, pointed to another major
threat to Novatel.


IPhone and other smartphone owners are beginning to realize that they already have
cheaper, simpler access to hotspots built right into their phones. They don't need Novatel.


So, smartphone users can turn on their phone's hotspot feature to get free Internet access
to their phone, laptop, iPad or other gadgets.


In comparison, the MiFi hotspot costs ~$50-$200, and the carrier charges users about $50
extra per month. Why would customers pay extra for something when they've already got
the feature built-in?


*Competition in the overseas market


With little wiggle room left for MiFi in the US market, Novatel is looking overseas.

"So we want to go from basically 90% of our sales in North America to something less
than 70% of sales. So and to get there, we really need to have some substantial wins in
both Europe and South America and other markets," Mr. Mashinsky told analysts at the
last earnings conference call.


He also noted that "these (overseas) things take a little bit longer both to win and to
deploy." The problem is that major competitors are already digging into the overseas
market.


Strong rivals working in the overseas market include Chinese vendors ZTE Corp.
(OTC:ZTCOY) (OTC:ZTCOF) ($31 billion revenue) and Huawei ($47 billion revenue).
Another US-based public company targeting sales in other countries is Digi International
(NASDAQ:DGII), a company that isn't blowing up the sector, but at least isn't as weak as
Novatel. (Numbers are most recently reported; Digi and Novatel are set to report next
quarter earnings soon.)


Novatel Digi Sierra CalAmp


Cash Flow -$31.9 million +$7.5 million +$48.7 million +$24.3 million


EBITDA -$21 million +$4.7 million +$12.7 million +$30 million


Net Income - - - $4 million


Net Loss -$8.8 million -$0.3 million -$1.7 million -


*And more... Novatel lags behind M2M competitors


Novatel showed a slight increase in machine-to-machine, M2M, revenue last quarter. But
M2M brings in less than 22 percent of the revenue. And this is just too insignificant to
really help declining MiFi sales and poor margins, especially since Novatel appeared too
late and too small.


Much of the M2M market is dominated by Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) (see
financials highlighted in the chart above). Sierra Wireless spun off the equivalent of
Novatel's MiFi business, "AirCard," in 2013 and has been gaining in M2M ever since.
Sierra hyped a $90 million M2M deal last December, spurring the share price 48 percent
to $48. Novatel investors should note how Sierra got ahead of itself as shown by the

fallout when quarterly results released last week failed to live up to the hype. Within hours,
the share price tanked to a more realistic $34 because the market expected far superior
results and guidance here.


Other rivals include Gemalto (OTCPK:GTOFF) (OTCPK:GTOMY), Telit (OTCPK:TTCNF)
and Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE:FSL). Yet another big player is Oxnard, Calif.-based
CalAmp (NASDAQ:CAMP), with diversified products and $11 million in net income last
year.


*Internet of Things competition


Novatel is also eyeing the Internet of Things market. Internet of Things, IoT, connects
devices to address consumer and industrial goods such as smart appliances, smart
watches and smart parking meters.


This is another market targeted by well-funded Sierra Wireless. Less established
companies like Novatel would be hard-pressed to squeeze into this battlefield already
dominated by the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and
others. Intel Corp. just revealed a new platform that makes it easier for companies to use
Intel products when they build smart products.


*Millions of Novatel shares loom; Overhang expires next month


Besides the longer term risks, Novatel's stock faces a challenge in less than 30 days.


Novatel touted a neck-saving ~$23.7 million investment by HC2 Holdings just last
September. Novatel issued 7.4 million shares of its stock for just $1.75 apiece, preferred
stock, plus warrants for 4.1 million shares.


The kicker: Time is almost up on the stock warrants. Beginning March 8, with the right to
exchange the warrants for stock at just $2.26 per share, HC2 can sell any or all of those
4.1 million shares.


At today's share price, selling all those cheap shares would give HC2 about $11 million.
Two HC2 officers were installed on Novatel's board and one would hope they would sell
thoughtfully. But, with the allure of $11 million now versus the uncertainty of tomorrow, it
makes sense to sell.


Indeed, more financial pressures are looming right around the corner. In just two quarters,
Novatel is on track to burn through its $20 million in cash provided by HC2. So, Novatel is
likely to face the uncomfortable decision this year of accessing its revolving loan, other
