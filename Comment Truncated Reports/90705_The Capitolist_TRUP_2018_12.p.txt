TRUP


After receiving additional FOIA's it is clear that regulators have similar concerns
about the solicitation of insurance from the veterinarian sales channel.


As I predicted the company has responded by beginning to shutter questionable
sales practices (such as the payments to veterinarians) however, I think there are
more changes to come.


After performing additional research I think the solicitation of insurance by
unlicensed veterinarians is wide spread and totally uncontrolled.


Trupanion (TRUP) has asserted that all their sales programs are compliant and that they
have an excellent handle on their business as it pertains to regulatory issues. In fact in a
recent "Company Statement" several claims were made:

These Are Not Reasonable Conclusions


"Weâ€™ve owned our own insurance entity, American Pet Insurance Company, in the U.S.
for over 10 years, and have been communicating with insurance regulators regarding
our business practices throughout that time. We believe they understand our
business well, including how we interact with veterinarians. Recently, we received
some additional inquiries that we believe were driven by capital market
participants or competitors. We have had discussions with regulators on these topics,
and, as of today, we have no reason to believe that any state regulator believes that our
business model violates the letter, or spirit, of insurance regulations with respect to
these issues. Furthermore, we have no expectation that we will need to change our
business practices."


The two highlighted statements suggest:


The company believes that the regulators understand their business well and thus
offer a tacit approval of their business practices.


1.


The company believes the investigations are not organically derived from complaints
- but instead came from short sellers or competitors.


2.


I would like to point out that my first publication on TRUP was on August 9th, 2018. Lets
look at a conversation from April of 2018 between members of the Louisiana
Department of Insurance (well before "The Capitolist" got involved).

Admittedly we all lack the full context of the email chain as the initial request was
redacted or not included for some reason. My assumption is that the NAIC reached out
to various states in the process of drafting the recent white paper to see if there were
common complaints associated with pet insurance. Whomever reached out is less
material than the fact that the regulator was surprised by the voluminous nature of the
NASDAQ:TRUP violations and cavalier about the company's involvement. It's also clear
that they see the veterinarian sales channel as being susceptible to solicitation and
inducement concerns.

Definition of Solicitation


Although the regulator states that the policies look compliant - I have always maintained
this is a sales and marketing compliance story (it does not surprise me that the actual
plans are written within the rules).


I believe vets are routinely soliciting insurance on behalf of Trupanion. This effort
appears to be coordinated by Trupanion and it is widespread on vet websites and in
exam rooms across the country. There has been significant confusion among investors
about what this practically means veterinarians can and cannot do.


I find Michigan's Department of Insurance and Financial Services' FAQ page to be
extremely helpful in offering a real-world understanding of these prohibitions on selling,
soliciting and negotiating insurance without a license (here). Note that Michigan uses
the same definitions for sell, solicit and negotiate as Washington (here). According to
this FAQ page, some activities that are illegal unless the individual is licensed, includes:


"Discussing, interpreting, or elaborating upon the information contained in an
insurance brochure, application or other sales literature."


"Giving advice or describe the specific characteristics of coverages of an annuity or
insurance product."


"Explaining, discussing, or interpreting coverage; analyzing exposures or policies;
or giving opinions or recommendations pertaining to insurance products."


"Discussing the effect of age, health, or other risk-related conditions to a current or
prospective policyholder."


"Counseling, urging, or advising any current or prospective policyholder to buy a
particular policy or to insure with a particular company."


As a further reminder of the extreme limitations afforded to Vets in how they can
discuss/recommend pet insurance (it is a regulated product after all) here are the
definitions of solicit and negotiate in Washington state (LINK):


(14) "Solicit" means attempting to sell insurance or asking or urging a person to
apply for a particular kind of insurance from a particular insurer.

Solicitation In The Field


Hospital #1:


(11) "Negotiate" means the act of conferring directly with, or offering advice directly
to, a purchaser or prospective purchaser of a particular contract of insurance
concerning any of the substantive benefits, terms, or conditions of the contract,
provided that the person engaged in that act either sells insurance or obtains
insurance from insurers for purchasers.


I've collected and presented vast amounts of evidence of solicitation across multiple
reports. Now I've decided to call a few dozen clinics in Colorado, from another one-party
consent state (one-party consent states can be found HERE) that have website pages
stating "We recommend Trupanion pet insurance." Where state laws allow, I have
recorded these conversations. Importantly - I am assuming that the receptionist at
each of the veterinarian hospital is NOT a licensed insurance agent (I submit that
licensed insurance agents would be allowed to have these conversations with
me). Disclaimers aside the Washington definition of solicitation is very clear:
"Solicit" means attempting to sell insurance or asking or urging a person to apply for a
particular kind of insurance from a particular insurer.


This definition makes it clear that advertising a specific insurance company - verbally or
otherwise - is explicitly against the law. I covered some of this in depth in a previous
article, "Trupanion: NAIC To Address Pet Insurance This Weekend" so regardless of the
licensing status of the receptionist the hospital should not be endorsing a specific
insurance program.


Given the active investigation, let's look at two of my recent conversations in Colorado:


Male Speaker: Hi. I'm in the process of adopting a puppy and I was trying to learn a
little bit more about pet insurance. I wanted to give you guys a quick call and see if you
recommended getting pet insurance, and if so, is there a certain type that you
recommend?

Hospital #2:


Staffer #1: Got you. Okay. If we do do pet insurance, we recommend Trupanion. It's T-
R-U and then panion. Usually, pet insurance is good if you think that the dog could have
any potential problems. Certain breeds have certain things like arthritis, like all of that
crazy, difficult stuff. Usually, if the animal does have that, it would be beneficial to you if
there is any previous problems, but if you don't think that there will be or anything like
that, then pet insurance is just like I guess a safety thing. So if anything is to happen,
then you have the backup.We have a lot of clients who have gotten it before and then
canceled it just because they never used it. Then right after they canceled it, they were
like, "Oh my gosh, I need it now". That is again, completely up to you on what you think
would be more beneficial.


This hospital recommends Trupanion - recommending a specific insurance product is
against Colorado law- and it is also a good example of the adverse selection that
happens at veterinary hospitals.


Male Speaker: Good, thank you. I'm in the process of adopting a puppy, and I want to
reach out to you and see if you recommended pet insurance, and if so, if you
recommended a particular kind of company.


Staffer #2: Absolutely, we do highly recommend pet insurance just because of unknown
problems and what not, that puppies and dogs get. The one we use in-house through an
express portal is Trupanion. They cover 90% of the bill after deductibles met. The
deductible is based on the age, your zip code, and breed of your dog. As well--


Male Speaker: Okay.


Staffer #2: You choose what your deductibles to be so the premiums would be kind
depended on that, for higher deductible lower premium.


Male Speaker: Do you know if it usually covers everything or is it just major surgery or
accidents that happen?

Conclusion


Staffer #2: Trupanion covers everything from ear infections, UTI's, broken toenails, two
major surgeries. They don't cover preventive stuff. They don't cover spays. They don't
cover wellness, vaccines, annual deworming. Like if a dog has worms they'll cover it,
typically, but they won't cover their preventive measures. A lot of insurances are like that
though.


Not only does this hospital recommend a specific insurance provider the staffer enters
into extreme detail about coverage - both of which are against CO law.
