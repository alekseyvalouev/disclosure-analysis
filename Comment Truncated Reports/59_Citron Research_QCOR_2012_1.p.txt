5/18/2018 A Citron Prescription for Truth on Questcor — with the Documents and Statistics the Company Doesn’t Want You To See! – Citron Resea…

Citron publishes  “Questcor
(NASDAQ:QCOR):   A Single Digit Stock in
18 Months and Here’s Why”


Everyone knows the old cliché “snake oil
salesmen” – hawkers of mysterious
preparations promising miracle cures with
secret formulations that can’t be made by
anyone else.  Such tactics have been outlawed
since the Food and Drug Act was signed into
law over a century ago.  For very obvious
reasons, unsubstantiated claims cannot be
made when marketing drugs in the U.S. to
doctors or their patients.  Yet
Questcor(NASDAQ:QCOR) seems to have no
hesitation when it spins its multi-billion dollar
“snake oil sales” story – on Wall Street.  Can a
company tell one story to doctors and a
completely different one to Wall Street? 
Apparently, in 2012, the answer is yes.


Let’s be clear:  Citron is not claiming
Questcor’s sole drug HP Acthar Gel is “snake
oil”.  It is a real drug with a bona fide FDA


A CITRON PRESCRIPTION
FOR TRUTH ON QUESTCOR
— WITH THE DOCUMENTS
AND STATISTICS THE
COMPANY DOESN’T WANT
YOU TO SEE!

approval.  The truth is right there in black and
white in Questcor’s approval letter from the
FDA.  HP Acthar Gel is injectable corticotropin. 
It has one active ingredient:  a well known,
naturally occurring substance in humans called
adrenocorticotropic hormone, or corticotropin,
or ACTH for short.


The problem with Questcor as an investment
thesis is that this same hormone ACTH has
also been approved by the FDA as a generic
drug numerous times in the last 60 years – by
numerous manufacturers – with essentially the
same label for the same conditions.  Through
the Freedom of Information Act, Citron has
obtained the FDA’s approval history on ACTH. 
If you are a Questcor investor, Citron
recommends you read these file, which
completely negate the “barrier to entry” claims
of Questcor’s CEO.  Certainly the numerous
analysts “covering” the company’s stock with
generous buy recommendations and lofty price
targets have not done so – their projections
wouldn’t be so optimistic if they did their
homework.  On the other hand, it’s nice to be
ahead of the Street when you have the chance.


Then there’s the biotech advisory newsletter
BioPharmInsight, far from the company-laced
propaganda on Wall Street, full of the most
eye-popping quotes revealing the realities
behind Questcor’s claims about its sole drug
Acthar … Citron guarantees Questcor Don
Bailey does not want you to read this
article — including his own quotes.


So why is Questcor’s CEO saying these crazy
things about Acthar?   Because he needs to
create the illusion of a barrier-to-entry to
justify a purported “multi-billion dollar market
opportunity” — when it simply doesn’t exist.


If you are a Questcor investor, “Dr. Citron”
prescribes a dose of truth about Questcor,
easily digested from the attached .PDF file. 
Warning label:  It’s strong medicine.  It
includes:

a complete workup on the
competitive threats that can cause
heart seizure for Questcor’s
earnings at any time
a diagnosis of the insurance
industry’s tightening policies on
the all-important reimbursement
of Acthar Gel, without which
Questcor gets no revenue. 
an “X-ray” of Questcor
management’s indisputable history
of printing out and exercising
options while the company buys
back stock — which might make
you want to yell “Clear!”


This presents Citron’s most comprehensive
coverage of a US healthcare company since
Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED) and Arthrocare
(NASDAQ:ARTC), both of which lost over 80%
of their market value when Citron’s stories
were borne out by subsequent company
admissions.


Citron’s work doesn’t get caught up in the
“moral outrage” angle, which is all about
history: 


how a company takes control of a
legacy drug with no market
hangs an astronomical price on it
launches a high-priced salesforce
to sell it
and with no new science, no new
drug pipeline, and no intellectual
property protection …
gets its stock caught up with Wall
Street’s mo-mo crowd and winds
up with a 3.5-billion-dollar
valuation. 


For Citron, it’s all about the business, which is
about the present and the future…and the

truth.  Comprehensive, insightful and detailed
— 22 pages in all.  Truth you won’t read
anywhere else. 


Make no mistake, Questcor’s business is facing
severe headwinds.  As usual, don’t count on
the company or the analysts to tell you about
them… for that you’ll have to read for
yourself….
