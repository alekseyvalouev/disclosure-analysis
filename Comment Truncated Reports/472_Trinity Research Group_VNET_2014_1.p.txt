21Vianet Group Exposed
Sep. 10, 2014 9:30 AM ET
by: TrinityResearch


Summary


We rate VNET a zero due to overwhelming evidence that the company is falsifying
financials and reported operating metrics.


VNET overstates cabinets and utilization for its core IDC hosting business, about
two thirds of revenue.


A substantial portion of the MNS business, the other third of revenue, operates an
illegal bandwidth reselling network.


To make up for the overstated performance of hosting, VNET acquires non-core
assets and shells from which to fabricate revenue.


VNET uses constant financings and acquisitions to help deliver overpromised growth
and mask that it is technically insolvent.

We conducted a six-month investigation of 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) with an
expanded team of local accountants, lawyers, telecom and Internet industry
executives/insiders and VNET customers, partners and former employees. Our beliefs
based on our key findings follow.


· We rate VNET a zero due to overwhelming evidence that the company is falsifying
financials and reported operating metrics. We expect VNET will end up delisted.


· Since listing in 2011, VNET has reported falsified financials and operating metrics. At
least 31% of total revenue and 100% of EBITDA is fabricated (see Exhibit 1). An
incremental one third of total revenue is illicitly derived and therefore worthless.


· VNET's constant financings followed by dubious non-core acquisitions have all the
trappings of a Ponzi scheme (see Exhibit 2). VNET overstates cabinet growth and
utilization in the core Internet Data Center (IDC) hosting business which burns through
27% of (overstated) revenue in cash due to exceedingly aggressive construction. To make
up for the IDC shortfall, VNET fabricates revenue and profits by acquiring tangential
businesses that do not consume cash. The cycle is then repeated through constant
financings. Since the 2011 IPO, VNET has raised 5.7 billion RMB ($915 million) and done
at least 23 non-core acquisitions.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 7/157


· VNET is overleveraged (Exhibit 3), hemorrhages cash (Exhibit 4) and is technically
insolvent. If even a portion of our findings is confirmed by auditors or debt holders, VNET
will be in official violation of basic debt covenants. A run on the balance sheet from debt
holder redemptions would cause a liquidation that wipes the equity out.


· Our field checks of the acquired subsidiaries found mostly ghost offices, no visible assets
or operations of any kind and a litany of red flags in the local filings. iJoy (one of VNET's
two VIEs) in particular exists primarily to roundtrip cash into VNET.


· VNET's Managed Network Services (MNS), the other third of total revenues, is a front for
China's largest illegal bandwidth reselling operation that was blacklisted by state-
owned China Telecom after investigation (see Exhibit 5) but continues to operate illegally.


· The 2014 acquisitions of Aipu ("iPoo") and Dermot Holdings ("Dermot"), VNET's two
largest ever, are signs the acquisition-driven financing bubble is spinning out of control. As
previous acquisitions end their useful life as shells used to launder acquisition proceeds
back in as revenue, VNET was forced to go "all in" with these two deals reminiscent of
Longtop Financial's acquisition of Giantstone. iPoo failed to gain regulatory approval
to list in China, was banned by the government in Guangzhou (a Tier 1 city), Wuhan and
Changsha and was featured in an inflammatory CCTV (largest state-run TV channel)
exposé. VNET acquired iPoo at a monster 2,000% premium to, or 20x, its 2012 valuation.


· Management has pumped the stock through promises of huge cloud revenue and a
telecom license that will never materialize. Despite Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
subsidizing the cost of VNET's offerings (they are effectively free), revenue is still only 3%
of total. Recent regulatory actions against Microsoft include an unfavorable SAIC
investigation and a ban of Microsoft and IBM from the government's procurement
program. Telecom authorities indicate the national "basic telecom" license needed to offer
interconnection will never be issued to a private company, which explains why
expectations for its issuance were pushed back from 1H2014 to 2H2014 to now sometime
in 2015.

Introduction


At first glance, VNET's vision is attractive. VNET is purportedly in the early innings of
building China's leading Internet infrastructure company. The problem is VNET's vision
requires that industry dynamics support it, and they do not. It is not only that China's
Internet Data Center (IDC) industry is dominated by the monopolistic state-owned fixed
line telecom carriers China Telecom and China Unicom, the industry is in a state of
massive oversupply, with the average IDC running significantly below half capacity. This
has resulted in a mass exodus from hosting as data center operators refashion
themselves into providers of Content Delivery Network (CDN), Virtual Private Network
(VPN) and other bandwidth services.


Except for VNET. Citing insatiable demand for its quickly expanding IDC network, VNET
went public on April 21, 2011 setting irrational expectations for cabinet growth and
profitability. Unable to deliver what the industry could not support, VNET overstated its
assets and financials and embarked on a string of acquisitions to make up the shortfall in
revenue and profitability. Management executed record financing one after another by
pumping the share price with promises of continued expansion. And with the proceeds,
VNET continued overbuilding while acquiring non-core assets in between financings to
keep the acquisition-fueled growth going.


Management's hope all along was that the development of the Chinese Internet
infrastructure industry would catch up to the vision. That demand as well as margins and
new, legitimate sources of profits would evolve quickly enough to cover up the falsification
of the past.


But that hope never materialized. Instead, VNET was forced to do increasingly larger
financings and increasingly riskier acquisitions to feed the beast of cabinet expansion.
Over time, falsifying financials through the aid of acquisitions got harder, not easier, to
sustain. The capital intensive core IDC business burns cash much too quickly and the
fledgling cloud business VNET hoped would save the day is not ramping enough. Even
with Microsoft's partnership, cloud software revenue is under 3% of total, hopelessly
behind the pace needed to overtake the falsified growth promised to investors.


Three major structural problems signal imminent collapse.

1. VNET is technically insolvent with a balance sheet that will not sustain the recently
stated goal of adding 10,000 cabinets in 2014 (to a base of 14,000 cabinets from 2013)
and then another 10,000 cabinets in 2015. The additional debt and cash burn required to
increase cabinets by almost 2.5 times in two years will cripple the company.


2. The Managed Network Services (MNS) business that VNET uses to make most of
its dubious acquisitions is run illegally. VNET's SEC filings paint a very inaccurate
picture of MNS. In reality, aside from housing most of the highly suspect acquisitions, MNS
is a front for an illegal bandwidth reselling operation that has already been dinged for
violation by China Telecom and could be shut down any day. Moreover, recent regulatory
developments will soon make bandwidth reselling obsolete.


3. VNET hopes that cloud software revenue and the receipt of a basic telecom license to
provide high-margin interconnection services will solve the company's cash flow problem.
Neither initiative will deliver.


The cloud software business which at the moment is just Microsoft (soon IBM too) has no
hope of achieving the type of growth promised to investors. Our field work revealed that
VNET was only able grow cloud sales because Microsoft is subsidizing customer costs
(offering products for free) in an effort to gain share of a market it could not penetrate
otherwise. Even with those subsidies, if the Internet industry's preference for open source
platforms doesn't severely limit Microsoft, regulation will. Already, the Chinese
government's xenophobic policies have banned Microsoft and IBM from their procurement
program.


As for the telecom license, there is a reason why management has pushed back
expectations three times already from 1H2014 to 2H2014 and now to sometime in 2015.
Our regulatory contacts are confident that the government will never issue such a license
at a national level to a private company.


This report presents the results of six months of investigative work aided by an
extended team of local Chinese accountants, lawyers, telecom industry executives and
insiders, former VNET employees, current and former VNET customers and current and
former VNET service providers (e.g. data center construction companies). Throughout this
135-page report, we organize our findings and their supporting evidence into the following
sections.

We investigated all 72 data centers in VNET's IDC network for over three months, visiting
in person and conducting over 50 interviews of sales staff, partners, customers,
contractors and competitors. We found VNET overstates cabinets and utilization,
overstates 27% of IDC revenue and has negative EBITDA (not the 20% EBITDA margins
IDC purportedly has).


Our field work points to a highly overbuilt network of overpriced cabinet inventory that has
drained VNET's balance sheet. As management keeps delaying the data center rollout
hoping demand or the fledgling cloud business will eventually catch up, they have been
forced to lie about the assets and performance of their IDC business while fabricating the
shortfall in revenue and margins through dubious acquisitions of mostly shell companies.


· iJoy: A Ghost in the (Cache) Machine


A deep dive on iJoy, one of VNET's two VIEs. iJoy, with no fixed assets and nearly 100%
net margin, is a shell company whose acquisition was orchestrated by VNET to roundtrip
cash. We provide evidence of the acquisition's orchestration and the subsequent money
laundering so critical to VNET's margins.


· The MNS Shell Game


A deep dive into roughly one third of VNET's consolidated revenue, the MNS business.
We review key findings from our in-person investigation of all 10 of VNET's major MNS
acquisitions, including evidence collected from our in-person field work, review of local
government filings and review of public records. Although we found no assets, offices or
required licensing, we did find a long list of red flags in the government filings and public
records, e.g. fake business registrations, tiny registered capital and employee count,
suspicious asset transfers and most of all huge inconsistencies between their financial
contribution to VNET's consolidated numbers and historical performance reported to PRC
authorities.


· MNS, A Ticking Time Bomb


Light on assets and fragmented across dozens of acquisitions, MNS was the perfect place
to fabricate financials but has now become the weakest link as it faces shutdown and
technical obsolescence at once. We reveal evidence of the illegal operations and VNET's
blacklisting at China Telecom.


· iPoo: VNET's Longtop Moment

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 19/157


The massive back-to-back acquisitions of iPoo and Dermot make little strategic sense but
needed to be done to sustain the acquisition-driven falsified growth. As ridiculously
outsized IDC expansion looms and the MNS business used to prop margins deteriorates,
VNET had no choice but to acquire again, this time in enormous size. As with Longtop's
acquisition of Giantstone, these deals mark the top for VNET shares.


· Conclusion


Our concluding thoughts end with a detailed liquidation waterfall that shows what will
happen to every stakeholder across the capital structure in the event of a forced
liquidation of the company due to debt holder redemptions, a shutdown and/or further
erosion of the MNS business or a balance sheet event driven by sustained cash burn and
overleveraging.


Field of IDC Dreams


What VNET Does


VNET has two major lines of business and one minor. Through its core business, hosting
and related services, the company operates a network of Internet data centers (IDCs)
from which they lease cabinets to customers looking to outsource hosting of their Internet
servers. IDC is largely the product of massive capex-driven organic expansion over
the years and is the primary beneficiary of VNET's capital expenditures. All major strategic
initiatives, particularly VNET's partnership with Microsoft to offer cloud software services
on top of their hosting, have been undertaken through this business. IDC is the business
that investors value. Depending on the year, between 60-80% of VNET's business is IDC.


VNET's other major business, managed network services (MNS), is a mystery to most. It
is usually an afterthought few focus on. MNS purports to operate much of the technology
related to running and maintaining an efficient network, but as VNET acknowledges in the
2013 20-F, "our managed network services are primarily offered in the form of bandwidth."
[1] Through MNS, VNET buys bandwidth from China's major telecom carriers, mainly
China Telecom and China Unicom, and packages its own technology services such as
"hosting area network services" and "route optimization" on top of it. Unlike IDC, MNS is
not capital intensive, is low in value-add and has low barriers to entry. MNS is the result
of many small acquisitions.


Starting in 2013, the acquisitive VNET entered a third line of business, content delivery
network (CDN), also by acquisition. CDN offers content caching, like competitors
ChinaCache (Nasdaq: CCIH), China NetCenter (CNC, listed in China's A-share market),

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 20/157


and others. This is the smallest of the three businesses. Even though it does not belong in
IDC, VNET consolidates CDN into IDC and does not break CDN out separately when
reporting earnings.


Serving Two Masters, Cabinet Growth and Utilization


Because IDC is highly capital intensive and it is the majority of revenue, VNET's business
model is not that different from traditional offline retail. Just as a retailer's value is driven
off of the size of its geographic footprint and the trend in same store sales, number of
cabinets in the IDC network and their overall utilization are the two masters VNET must
serve.


If VNET can grow cabinets in its IDC network every quarter and keep utilization up, the
business model must be working. That is the hope VNET has sold to investors and those
two metrics are what ultimately drive VNET's stock price. The reality is VNET has never
been able to make this simple model work because capacity expansion significantly
outpaced demand.


Exhibit 8: VNET's capacity expansion vs. utilization


Management focuses investors on the cabinet growth story, consistently setting overly
aggressive targets they fail to meet.


Exhibit 9: VNET has consistently lagged guidance (per earnings calls) for capacity
expansion

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 21/157


Despite an expansion much slower than guided, utilization still dropped sharply in 2012
and 2013 from the previous three years due to the overly aggressive pace of cabinet
deployment.


Undeterred, VNET continues building and building like the construction companies
building out China's famous ghost cities[2]. Plunging utilization be damned, management
continues selling the story that if they build it, customers will eventually come.


In the latest earnings call CFO Shang Hsiao of Camelot (CIS) fame[3] provided color on
VNET's cabinet expansion plans for 2014 and 2015[4]:


"And like I mentioned earlier, this year, we will [be] adding 10,000 cabinets. Next
year, again, we will add an additional 10,000 cabinets."


As if that wasn't absurd enough, after breaking out the remaining portion of that massive
ramp (3,000 in Q3 and 4,000 more in Q4), he goes on to say that utilization won't change
much:


"But going forward, okay, this is starting from the utilization rate, right now, we have
currently around 73,9%. I think this utilization rate probably will be between 70% to
71% in the third quarter. Again, probably 69% to 70% in the fourth quarter."


Do the following two charts, which put Mr. Hsiao's words to the eyeball test, make any
sense?


Exhibit 10: VNET's capacity expansion by quarter vs. utilization (including 2H14 and 2015
projections)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 22/157


Exhibit 11: Historical versus projected impact of aggressive cabinet expansion


Utilization dropped 15 points in two quarters when VNET ramped capacity by 3,620
cabinets. Does anyone really believe that utilization is barely going to move when twice as
many cabinets are deployed in the next two quarters, and then another 10,000 on top of
that in 2015?


If that passes someone's eyeball test, we have a smell test for them.


China's Massive IDC Oversupply


If VNET hits the goal of 10,000 new cabinets in 2014, it is on pace for a 5-year CAGR of
42%, a nearly 6-fold increase in the face of serious degradation in utilization and industry-
wide oversupply. How much oversupply, you ask? The Chinese government has an
answer.


On July 30 of this year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the
regulatory body that oversees the technology sector, issued a report on the state of the
data center market[5], Circular No.225(2014), "Report on Planning and Construction
Schedule of China Data Centers since 2011." Among the various industry facts disclosed,
we highlight these to put VNET's insane capacity expansion plans through the smell test:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET10.jpg

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET11.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 23/157


· From 2011 through the first half of 2013, 255 data centers have been built and 177 of
them have been put to use. About a third of all construction has yet to be commercialized


· The 255 data centers break out as follows: 23 are super data centers (over 10,000
cabinet capacity), 42 are mid-sized data centers (3,000 - 10,000 cabinet capacity) and 190
are small data centers (under 3,000 cabinet capacity)


· The industry hugely overestimated demand, since demand was estimated at 7.28 million
servers but only came in at 0.57 million, less than 8% of estimates!


· Here is the kicker: Utilization rates for super, mid-sized, and small data centers are 1.8%
(1 point 8%, not a typo), 21.5% and 40%, respectively


VNET's IDC network contains mainly small and mid-sized data centers (some partnered
cabinets might be hosted in larger ones), so the benchmark for their purported
industry-leading 73.9% utilization is between 21.5% and 40%.


Does that not smell fishy? Against this kind of industrial oversupply, is VNET really going
to add 10,000 extra cabinets this year on top of the 14,000 they ended 2013 with, of which
30% were not utilized? And then another 10,000 extra cabinets in 2015?


Defying Gravity: VNET's Stable Margins


VNET's CFO himself has stated at conferences and road shows that VNET (as does any
IDC business) has a high degree of operating leverage because over 80% of the cost
structure is fixed, with bandwidth and cabinet leasing making up most of it. Operating
leverage, like any kind of leverage, cuts both ways. When business is booming and data
centers are running at full capacity, any incremental utilization turns into revenue that
flows right to the bottom line since the costs, being fixed, have largely been incurred. But
when you have high fixed costs and monetization drops suddenly, the negative effect on
margins is enormous as the shortfall in revenue has a disproportionate impact on the
bottom line for every point of utilization lost.


As dubious as VNET's capacity expansion plans may look relative to utilization or, even
worse, relative to the Chinese industrial backdrop, what is really unbelievable is that
margins - gross, EBITDA, net or any other - have held their levels throughout the
entire process. This is a huge red flag.


Any IDC business's margins are highly sensitive to utilization metrics. That is especially
true when utilization falls while capacity ramps by a factor of two or even three times the
base, as it did for VNET.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 24/157


Inconsistent Sales Force Productivity


A look at sales force productivity reveals another key operating metric inconsistent with
VNET's reported utilization trend. VNET breaks out their employee base by function in
their 20-F filings, including head count for "sales, marketing and customer support" (S&M).
S&M head count went from 241 in 2011 to 323 in 2012 and 252 in 2013.


For the full years 2011, 2012 and 2013, reported utilization was 80.6%, 66.3% and 70.3%,
respectively. Even though utilization dropped by over 10 points, which is a massive swing
for a business with high fixed costs, sales per sales and marketing employee almost
doubled in 2013 versus 2011.


Exhibit 12: Sales Force Productivity Inconsistent with Utilization


Even in 2012, when utilization plunged year on year, sales force productivity somehow
went up. Since management has consistently indicated monthly recurring revenue has
risen in the order of 10% historically, pricing cannot be the reason behind this discrepancy.


Moreover, we learned from our many interviews with management teams and sales
executives in the IDC industry that on average, it takes 12-18 months to fill a new data
center to more than half capacity. VNET appears to be a huge outlier in that they can fill
as much as half the new cabinet capacity coming online within a quarter. In their latest
earnings call, management reported that about half of the approximately 7,000 cabinets
coming online throughout the remainder of the year had been sold already.[6]


Whether VNET's numbers make sense is a rhetorical question. They don't. The more
interesting question is how VNET gets away with so much overbuilding without taking a hit
on margins or driving the balance sheet right into a wall with what must be an
unbelievable amount of cash burn. How does VNET feed the beast?


As the old saying goes:

"Lie, cheat and steal."


Let us first discuss the lies.


Feeding the Beast


Part I: Lie


VNET lists the locations of its 72 data centers on the Chinese version of its corporate
website. Click on each section of the map on this webpage to show a complete list of data
centers by region. (Interestingly, the English version of the corporate website does not list
the individual data centers. Clicking on the map does nothing.)


Investigation of IDC Network Shows Material Overstatement


Using these regional lists of data centers, which we confirmed with management are
updated and accurate, we conducted an exhaustive field study of VNET's national IDC
footprint throughout China. We determined the number of cabinets and utilization for each
data center by doing a 360 degree review consisting of:


· In-person visits


· Telephone interviews with data center staff, direct and indirect sales channels and
headquarter sales staff


· In-person and telephone interviews of key VNET customers


· In-person interviews with two contractors responsible for construction of VNET's data
centers


· In-person interviews with senior management of major IDC and CDN companies


· Telephone interviews with telecom carriers


Our investigation concluded that VNET has overstated the number of cabinets in its
IDC network by at least 2,460 (14.5% of reported) and overstated their utilization by
at least 11.1 points.


Exhibit 13: Summary of investigation of key IDC metrics (as of 2Q '14)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 26/157


Appendix A lists the results of our investigation of all 72 VNET data centers, both
partnered and self-built, by location.


Quickly Losing Partners


Of the 72 data centers that VNET lists in their IDC network, only 12 are self-built. 60 are
partnered, meaning VNET leases cabinets from other companies who own the data
centers and related fixed assets. As you can see from our investigation results in
Appendix A, 31 of the 60 alleged partnerships had been terminated at the time of our visits
and interviews. Given that the state-owned telcos from whom VNET provisions their
bandwidth are also VNET's biggest IDC partners, the fact that VNET has managed to get
blacklisted for illegal bandwidth reselling at the largest telco, China Telecom, cannot be
helping that partnership. As already noted, throughout our investigation, we gave VNET
the benefit of the doubt when the state of a partnership was inconclusive, but in doing so
we may have undercounted the terminated partnerships given more recent data points
such as the Wechat sales inquiry below. (As you can see from the breakout of our
investigation results by data center, we gave VNET credit for 40% utilization of 250
partnered cabinets in Nanjing.)


Exhibit 14: Wechat conversation with China Telecom Nanjing sales team
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 27/157


It makes a lot of sense that VNET has lied mainly by overstating partnered cabinets. It is
much easier to tell investors you are leasing some extra cabinets from the enormous
China Telecom data center down the road than it is to lie about having built a data center
from scratch or making your own data center appear three or four times busier than its
15% utilization.


Financial Impact of Overstatement


A hopeless optimist might say, overstating cabinets by 15% isn't that bad, is it? It's not like
they lied about half their cabinets or anything, right?


It might as well be half. Because margins are highly sensitive to utilization in a data center
business, 11 extra points of utilization is the difference between being profitable and
losing money.


Having 14.5% fewer cabinets running at 62.8% versus 73.9% utilization means VNET's
income statement gets hit with the double whammy of materially lower utilization off a
materially smaller base. This translates to a 27.3% overstatement in revenue. (If you have
100 cabinets running at 73.9%, you have 73.9 billable cabinets. If you have 85.5 running
at 62.8%, you only have 53.7, or 27.3% less.)



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET14.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 28/157


Due to the IDC business's high fixed cost, this 27.3% comes off the top line and hits the
bottom line almost dollar for dollar. Since VNET has an adjusted EBITDA margin around
18% or 19%, a 27% hit to EBITDA means the company goes from being in the black with
respectable margins to being deeply in the red.


VNET's Balance Sheet Problem


Obviously, if VNET is overstating IDC revenue, the overstatement has to come from
somewhere. The balance sheet is a sensible first place to look.


Accounts (Not) Receivable


Below is a chart that shows how accounts receivable changed as VNET built beyond their
ability to fill their data centers to acceptable levels.


Exhibit 15: Account receivable (right hand side) overlaid on top of cabinet deployment (left
hand side)


The 99% four-year CAGR in AR, nearly three times the aggressive pace of cabinet
deployment, raises all types of red flags.


All of VNET's IDC businesses should have little variance in collection terms. They are all
recurring revenue businesses and over two thirds of the revenue is IDC, a well-diversified
business. VNET's own investor presentation boasts that account concentration is low with
the top customer being under 5% of revenue and the top five customers being under 14%.


Exhibit 16: VNET's low account concentration (VNET investor presentation)



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET15.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 29/157


VNET has never had a problem collecting. Bad debt charges have never been an issue.
Very low churn proves VNET has a good relationship with customers. In the last second
quarter earnings, overall churn rate was down to almost zero with top customers having
literally zero churn.


So what is going on with AR?


A closer look reveals that it was not only AR that spiked as utilization started to plunge.
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) for AR started to spike upwards, eventually more than
doubling from a stable trend in the 40s throughout the year of the IPO.


Exhibit 17: Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) vs. Utilization


For a business with recurring revenue, minimal account concentration (one huge "bad"
customer cannot derail AR and DSO), good customer relationships with minimal churn
and minimal bad debt, how can these charts be explained?


There are only four possibilities:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET16.jpg

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET17.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 30/157


1. Billing terms have changed (they haven't)


2. Customer composition has turned from diversified to concentrated with huge customers
who pay really late (It hasn't… VNET has low account concentration)


3. Customer relationships have soured (they haven't, evidenced by very low churn)


4. The AR is not revenue waiting to be collected


We are convinced VNET is fabricating revenue to make up for the shortfall in actual
revenue from the massive ramp in cabinets that coincided with a massive drop in
utilization. Of course it makes sense that AR and DSOs would ramp most aggressively as
utilization plunged.


Hemorrhaging Cash


An analysis of VNET's free cash flow over the years shows what happens when cabinets
go from 5,750 in 2010 to 14,041 in 2013 while utilization goes from mid-80s to 60s and
low-70s, even if you fake those numbers substantially to make growth appear more robust
than it is.


Exhibit 18: Free Cash Flow Analysis: 2010-2013


VNET has burned through 28% of its past three years of inflated revenue in cash! Of
course, this 28% assumes every dollar of reported revenue is real, which we very strongly
doubt is the case. We believe VNET actually burns through more than half of its actual



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET18.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 31/157


revenue in cash.


The FCF analysis only goes through 2013 because VNET does not report cash flow
quarterly. We cannot wait to see what 2014 will look like when cabinets soar to 24,000 and
utilization sags back down to high 60s or 70% as management projects. Although we
won't know the official number until next year, we can guarantee it will be stunning…
Especially as we expect actual utilization to hit a level between 30-35%, more in line with
the top end of the MIIT-reported industry average of 21.5-40%.


Increasingly Indebted


So far, VNET's approach to creating shareholder value appears to be as follows.


1. Promise growth that defies not only the competition's but also the government's own
assessment of market demand


2. Burn 28% of (materially faked) revenue in cash to keep the growth story going by
building out the IDC network far beyond what is prudent


3. Deliver hugely outlying utilization and revenue performance by faking the difference
between actual revenue and what the street demands in utilization and cabinets to keep
the share price going


4. Let AR balloon at a 99% CAGR while DSOs are on pace to triple


With this approach, something has to give. And that something is the balance sheet.


Since VNET's April 2011 IPO left the company in the enviable position of having 1.1 billion
RMB of net cash, there has been an enormous 2.7 billion RMB swing in net debt.


Exhibit 19: Net Debt



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET19.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 32/157


Clearly, lying about IDC metrics and faking revenue might make the income statement
look pretty but it does a real number on the balance sheet. Most important of all, falsifying
IDC metrics does not put cash on the table. For VNET, as capital intensive a business as
we have ever seen, putting cash on the table to fund the enormous and sustained burn is
a matter of life and death, solvency and bankruptcy.


So where does VNET get all that cash to keep feeding the insatiable beast?


Part II: Cheat and Steal, All the Trappings of a Ponzi Scheme


They raise it. LOTS of it. Because to pay Paul, you must first rob Peter.


Master Pumpers


Nobody pumps their company better than VNET, which has successfully executed over
5.7 billion RMB ($915 million) in financings since 2011, the year of the IPO. That is greater
than half the entire market cap of VNET today, after the stock has shot up more than
300% in the past year and a half!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 33/157


(Ab)Use of Proceeds


And what has VNET done with all that money?


Obviously, a substantial portion of the proceeds has been burned to fund the massive data
center build. As we have discussed already, a cumulative $406 million in non-acquisition
driven capex has been burned from 2010 to 2Q2014.


Most of the rest of the proceeds (the majority) from all the non-stop financings went to buy
24 non-core subsidiaries light on fixed assets.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 34/157


There are some important observations that do not jump out of this chart.


· VNET has been about as acquisitive as any of China's largest Internet companies,
having done 24 acquisitions since it prepared to go public in 2011.


· But unlike Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu or Qihoo 360, VNET's total acquisition consideration
is a very large percentage of its market cap (almost 30%) and revenue (about 100% of
2014 revenue guidance).


· Despite having acquired a total consideration of 3.2 billion RMB ($516 million), close to
30% of its current market cap, only 0.5% of total acquisitions went towards assets for
its core IDC business, hosting, and that negligible amount was for an intercompany
transaction with aBitCool (one of VNET's own VIEs).


· None of the acquisitions targeted companies with substantial fixed assets, which is
surprising since an IDC network is essentially a large fixed asset. In the US, IDC
companies (e.g. Equinix) have claimed to be REITs and applied for conversion to REIT
status. VNET's highly unusual M&A strategy is analogous to that of a commercial real
estate company that only buys tangential service businesses with no buildings or other
fixed assets.


· The vast majority of the acquisitions have been tucked quietly into the commoditized,
slower-growth, asset-light MNS business that management rarely talks about.


· And yet, despite all the acquisitions, MNS revenue contribution is sharply declining.

they have no IDC assets and offer no hosting services.


· The consideration values have gone up consistently and exploded in size in 2014 with
the back to back acquisitions of iPoo and Dermot, which collectively represent over half
the total consideration paid throughout the entire period.


An Acquisition Inquisition


This pattern of constant non-core acquisitions begs many questions.


· It is unusual for a company in massive organic expansion mode to also go on acquisition
binges right before periods of high execution risk when the distraction of M&A is least
desirable. Why is that the only time VNET acquires anything significant?


· For example, why would VNET's management acquire iPoo and Dermot back to back for
a combined consideration significantly greater than VNET's own IPO in 2011 right before it
expands capacity by a combined 17,000 cabinets (over 120% growth)?


· Why is virtually all the capital deployed into non-IDC assets, especially the MNS
business the company acknowledges is much less strategic?


· Why does VNET only acquire service businesses with no fixed assets?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 36/157


· Why would a company confident in its core business bother with so many tiny
acquisitions into the non-core MNS business that is declining in revenue contribution?


· Why is there such poor disclosure about VNET's many acquisitions? Truly minimal
information such as the names of the acquired entities and occasionally some high level
valuation information is about all we get in SEC filings. Why is there little to no information
reported about the acquired entities' financial performance and corporate history before
acquisition?


· Why do non-hosting businesses get reported with core IDC? CDN and Microsoft cloud
software do not belong in IDC. The excuse management gave when we asked was that
they are not broken out separately because they are too small. Shouldn't management
want to report emerging businesses off a small base to show their strong growth? That is
what the large majority of other public companies in this situation do.


VNET's Midas Touch


Before we decided to investigate VNET's major acquisitions in person, we spent
considerable time trying to figure out their performance. Although VNET discloses little
information about its acquisitions, we were able to get our hands on filings to China's State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (NYSE:SAIC)[7] to get a view of their pre-
acquisition performance to compare to the post-acquisition performance reported in SEC
filings

It is not hard to see that VNET's acquisitions deliver stunning outperformance in
growth, profitability or both immediately after consolidation.


VNET's Impeccable Timing


It is very unusual for a company to acquire non-core businesses that outperform that
dramatically as soon as they are tucked in. It is even more unusual, and also highly
counterintuitive, for that to happen during critical periods of heightened execution risk, e.g.
before the IPO (MNS Entities), when margins plunged (Fastweb) and before substantial
ramps in cabinet expansions (Gehua, TWYL and iJoy, iPoo and Dermot). And yet that is
exactly what happens without fail for VNET. It is practically a law, as the chronological
chart of acquisitions overlaid with cabinet growth shows below.


Exhibit 24: History of cabinet expansion and suspicious acquisition timing

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 38/157


Six months before its April 2011 IPO, as VNET realized that a cash-burning unprofitable
data center business might not be well-received by the public markets, VNET got serious
about MNS, a business it was not in previously. On September 30, 2010, VNET acquired
the two parent companies of a seven-company network of MNS businesses it refers to as
"Managed Network Entities" in the 2011 20-F. As Exhibit 23 shows, the MNS Entities' net
margins from 2009-2013 were -2.4%, 7.7%, 18.5%, 19% and 8.6%. The effect of that
sudden peak in profitability between 2011 and 2012 was a successful VNET IPO driven by
a company that appeared to have turned the corner in profitability just in time for its listing.
We note that profitability was achieved by acquisition in spite of the core IDC business's
underperformance.

acquisition of MNS Entities

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 39/157


Fresh with cash from the IPO, VNET acquired another MNS company named Gehua
towards the end of 2011, right before the company's most aggressive period of cabinet
deployment theretofore.


Similarly fortuitous timing can be seen in the acquisition of Fastweb, a CDN business that
is also not core to IDC, right after the plunge in utilization we discussed in the last section
(see Exhibit 8 for utilization trend). Exhibit 23 shows a business that declined between
2010 and 2011, both unprofitable years, before it was acquired by VNET in 2012.
Suddenly, revenue doubled and net margins went from negative to a robust 19%. Our
calls to the IR team and the CFO over the past two quarters resulted in wildly bullish
projections for Fastweb in 2014 and 2015, although the level of wild bullishness varied by
the day and the source. We were told Fastweb would deliver anywhere between 150-
300% year on year growth in 2015, just in time for the huge 27,000 cabinet build out in
2H2014 and 2015 that will depress utilization and therefore margins.


Throughout our diligence of Fastweb, we were able to interview engineers from Microsoft
who can be found any day of the week at VNET's headquarters (they are easy to spot,
many being of Indian descent). Who does Microsoft, VNET's loyal and exclusive partner
for cloud software, use for CDN services in China? Apparently Microsoft's commitment
and loyalty to VNET only goes so far, since we were able to confirm with both Microsoft
engineers and the management team of industry leader ChinaCache (Nasdaq:CCIH) that
Microsoft uses CCIH and not Fastweb, a business everyone in the industry other than
VNET confirms is losing market share. How Fastweb loses share but projects 150-300%
growth next year is as curious as the explosion in growth and profit immediately after
VNET acquired it.


Another case of prescient timing occurs in 2Q2013 when VNET acquired another non-
core CDN business referred to as "iJoy" in the 2013 20-F. This was right after the plunge
in utilization that somehow had no impact on margins but apparently was bad enough to
stall cabinet deployment for three quarters until iJoy was acquired. Not only did cabinet
growth resume immediately thereafter, it is not hard to see how margins held throughout
that period from the analysis below.


Exhibit 26: iJoy's impact on VNET's consolidated margins



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCIH

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 40/157


It was only after consolidating iJoy that VNET was able to maintain gross margin around
26% from 2Q2013 to 2Q2014. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA margin was held between 18%
and 19% throughout that period. Without the consolidation of iJoy's gross profit, VNET's
organic gross margins would have dropped to as low as 15% and adjusted EBITDA
margin would have decreased to as low as 9% in the last quarter of 2013.


Most recently, right ahead of the exceedingly aggressive 17,000 cabinet build of 2H2014
and 2015, VNET suddenly decided to diversify into two other non-core businesses,
consumer broadband services ("last mile" broadband) and virtual private network (VPN)
services, by making the two largest acquisitions in their long history of non-core
acquisitions. The back to back timing of acquisitions of this size notwithstanding, more
curious is their timing ahead of an epic cabinet ramp as the acquired MNS subsidiaries'
revenue is stalling and margins are quickly eroding. Even for these much larger
acquisitions, VNET will not get much in the way of fixed assets, so investors might hope
there is at least significant strategic value to the core IDC business. Alas, there is not.
They are both non-core add-ons, with iPoo having practically zero synergy as it is a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 41/157


consumer business. By now the answer to why VNET, a purportedly high growth business
in a developing industry, would deploy so much of its precious cash to acquire low-growth
established companies outside of its core industry should be obvious. It will be impossible
for VNET to survive the massive cabinet build ahead without inorganic financial help.


Vicious Cycle


It is clear that financings are VNET's key growth driver. VNET raises a huge percentage of
revenue and market cap to acquire increasingly larger non-core companies to make up for
the shortfall in revenue from the core business. That core business consumes about half
the cash from financings to fund an IDC build that burns cash at an alarming rate. The
result has been a massive swing in the balance sheet from net cash to net debt in three
short years.


Exhibit 27: Financial consequences of feeding the IDC beast


While management waits for its nascent cloud software business to ramp, the IDC
business is burning a hole through the balance sheet that will require an enormous
amount of fundraising.


Between 2011 and 2Q2014, by far VNET's period of largest cabinet expansion, capex per
self-built cabinet (since partnered cabinets incur no capex) was approximately RMB
139,000.


Exhibit 28: Capex per cabinet



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET27.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 42/157


VNET plans to launch 17,000 incremental cabinets through the end of 2015, which at a
rate of RMB 139,000 per cabinet, would require over RMB 2.4 billion ($396 million) to
finance. Note that this is a conservative assumption since we are not charging the balance
sheet with commitments for the completion of ongoing data center construction and other
associated IDC network expansion costs.


What will that do to the company's net debt position, and how will the company's trailing
three-year track record of burning 28% of its total net revenue in free cash flow factor into
the company's liquidity?


More importantly, if VNET is overstating cabinet count and utilization to such a degree that
the overstatement alone wipes out all the reported EBITDA, an assumption for which we
have provided ample evidence (we have yet to discuss the acquisitions in detail…), how
will VNET stay solvent, let alone support its current expansion plans?


Investors, stockholders in particular, should respect their place in the capital structure and
act accordingly, because a liquidation of VNET today would render all of VNET's equity
worthless, even without the planned capacity expansion.


A Track Record of Value Destruction


Most companies use acquisitions to consolidate the industry of their core lines of
businesses. Less frequently, smaller acquisitions are used to gain access to promising
new lines of business as established companies saturate their slowing industries. VNET's
acquisitions fly in the face of these tried and true best practices. VNET only acquires
outside of its core business and uses acquisitions to troubleshoot growth problems in the
core.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 43/157


Since VNET tucks these acquisitions into only two categories, IDC and MNS, breaking out
only revenue separately, investors cannot track regularly whether their capital is being
deployed productively or not.


What happens to these acquisitions over the long term is a critical question-not merely
one of management competence but more importantly, solvency. We have seen that
roughly half the capital raised in VNET's non-stop financings has yet to deliver an
economic benefit as the IDC network bleeds cash like a stuck pig, making VNET
increasingly indebted. Does the other half of the funds from financings deliver acceptable
returns in future cash flows for investors?


VNET's track record suggests the answer is a resounding no.


Exhibit 29: A long history of value destruction through acquisitions


Out of the two dozen acquisitions the company has closed so far (Dermot has yet to
close), only two companies have yet to sorely disappoint: Aipu, which was consolidated
into VNET just last quarter, and the mysterious iJoy, an outlying winner (so far) from a long
list of miserable failures.


So naturally, we began our extensive six-month investigation of VNET's many acquisitions
with iJoy.


iJoy: Ghost in the (Cache) Machine



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET29.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 44/157


In April 2013, VNET completed the acquisition of 100% of iJoy, its subsidiaries and
consolidated affiliates (collectively known as "iJoy") with a purchase consideration of RMB
97.0 million as part of a purported strategic expansion into CDN/content caching. VNET
had previously acquired another CDN company, FastWeb, and appeared to be getting
serious about the CDN space.


We paid particularly close attention to iJoy because it is listed in the 2013 20-F filings as
one of VNET's two VIEs, an entity called aBitCool being the other. Also, iJoy appears to
be an incredibly profitable business with nearly 100% net margins.[8] Despite all that, we
wondered why VNET is so secretive about iJoy, disclosing so little about this company in
its 20-F filings despite its substantial contribution to consolidated margins.
Uncharacteristically, VNET never issued a press release about iJoy's acquisition despite
issuing one for the less significant FastWeb[9] and the two acquisitions of iPoo[10] and
Dermot[11] that were done immediately after. If iJoy is significant to VNET, it is certainly
hard to tell. iJoy doesn't even show up on a search on VNET's own corporate website:


Exhibit 30: There are no results for a search for "iJoy" on VNET's own website


iJoy's Filings: The Basics


As skeptical as we were going into our review of iJoy's SAIC filings, even we were
surprised by the number of red flags that our first cursory scan of iJoy's SAIC filings
revealed.


Corporate Structure

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 45/157


iJoy's consolidated PRC variable interest entity is called Beijing iJoy Information
Technology Co., Limited ("Beijing iJoy"). The wholly owned PRC subsidiary of iJoy Holding
Limited is named Suzhou Zhuoaiyi Information Technology Co., Limited ("Suzhou iJoy").
[12] The following diagram illustrates the current corporate structure of the principal
operating entities controlled by and affiliated with iJoy Holdings Limited:[13]


Exhibit 31: Corporate structure of iJoy Holdings Limited


PRC regulation currently restricts foreign ownership of telecommunications value-added
businesses.[14] The shareholder(s) of Beijing iJoy must be PRC citizen(s) who is (are)
forced to enter into a share pledge agreement with Suzhou iJoy to provide effective
control for Suzhou iJoy. According to SAIC filings, Peng Yang is the sole owner of Beijing
iJoy with a personal registered permanent residence in Beijing's Xicheng district.


On October 30, 2012, Peng Yang signed a definite loan and share pledge agreement with
Suzhou iJoy to pledge his 100% shares in Beijing iJoy (北京阅联信息技术有限公司, "北京
阅联"). Per Suzhou iJoy's SAIC filings, its sole investor is a Hong Kong company, iJoy
Information Limited which was renamed to Asiacloud Wireless Limited in late 2013. This
Hong Kong based company is entirely invested and controlled by iJoy Holdings Limited
(BVI). Below is the scanned copy of Suzhou iJoy's business license and share pledge
agreement entered into by Peng Yang and Suzhou iJoy.

Yang and Suzhou Zhuoaiyi


Translation of Business License of Suzhou Zhuoaiyi:


Name of Company: Suzhou Zhuoaiyi Information Technology Co., Limited. The sole owner
of Company: iJoy Information Limited (Hong Kong)


Translation of Share Pledge Agreement by Peng Yang and Suzhou Zhuoaiyi:


The parties who entered into the agreement include Peng Yang and Suzhou Zhuoaiyi
Information Technology Co., Limited. Pursuant to the share pledge agreement, Peng Yang
as the nominee shareholder has pledged all his equity interest in Beijing iJoy Information
Technology Co., Limited to guarantee the repayment of the loan specified in the Article 2.0
of the agreement.


The important points are that Peng Yang was the sole owner of iJoy before its acquisition
by VNET and that Mr. Peng apparently went out of his way to set up offshore entities in
preparation for a sale to a foreign-listed company such as VNET.


iJoy's Ghost Offices


iJoy is registered with the SAIC under a ghost office that is occupied by another company.

We tried to find iJoy's operations everywhere it made sense to find them but mostly struck
out. We obtained all of iJoy's registered addresses from Beijing iJoy and Suzhou iJoy's
SAIC filings, iJoy's website and other public sources. All but one of the addresses led to
ghost offices that could not have been used for real operations, and two of the ghost
offices were occupied by different companies.

A Ghost Board of Director [sic]

iJoy not only has ghost offices, it also has a ghost board. SAIC filings show only one
director who apparently runs board meetings with himself.


Exhibit 35: Suzhou iJoy's corporate structure with single-director governance


Undercapitalized, Low Employee Count and Other Peculiarities


iJoy's tiny 10 million RMB ($1.6 million) of registered capital and, depending on the year,
five to eight employees were also surprising given its acquisition by VNET, a nearly two-
billion USD market cap public company that runs a fundamentally different business. How
much strategic value could such a puny company really have to VNET?


Exhibit 36:Beijing iJoy's business license just before acquisition by VNET

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 50/157


We found it quite strange too that on March 14, 2013, a month before the acquisition by
VNET on 4/30, there was a sudden large increase in registered capital from 5 million to 10
million RMB. As we dug deeper, we noticed this was preceded by a transfer of ownership
to Peng Yang from the prior owners on July 2012 (see Appendix B).


As we dug deeper into iJoy's articles of incorporation and the various shareholder
resolutions filed locally, what went on between 2012 and iJoy's April 2013 acquisition
became clear to us, as did the purpose of iJoy's acquisition by VNET.


iJoy's Orchestrated Acquisition


The following timeline illustrates iJoy's corporate history.


Exhibit 37: Timeline of iJoy's Corporate History

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 51/157


Woeful Financial Performance


The first thing to note is iJoy's woeful financial performance for the first three years it was
in business. For 2009, 2010, and 2011, all iJoy did was lose money. Particularly notable
are the steep operating losses of 3.71 million RMB from a tiny 0.91 million of revenue in
2011.


Exhibit 38: Summary financials from Beijing iJoy with SAIC filings for 2009, 2010 and 2011

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 52/157


Right before the end of that brutal year, the founders resolved to cut the registered capital
of iJoy in half from 10 million to 5 million RMB. It is no wonder two of the three co-
founders, Shu Huaying and Hu Yiwen, could not bail fast enough after that. In three
transactions throughout 2012, Shu and Hu sold all their shares to Peng, who clearly had
other plans (See Appendix B.)


Peng Yang's Takeover


Before Peng even took possession of all of iJoy's shares, he began establishing a much
more sophisticated corporate structure that was clearly intended to put the company up for
sale. Why else would a tiny, struggling Chinese company with barely any revenue go
through the legal motions of creating an offshore structure to hold the onshore entities?
The result of Peng's efforts is the corporate structure depicted in Exhibit 31 which includes
a VIE and a WFOE wholly owned by an offshore company, not exactly a run-of-the-mill
structure for a Chinese company with registered capital of under a million USD.


A funny thing started to happen as Peng gained control of iJoy. The financial performance
started to improve, with a nice swing in profitability from being so hopelessly in the red in
2011 that two of the three co-founders threw in the towel to being very nicely profitable in
2012 after a near 10-fold improvement in revenue. Peng was suddenly proving to be some
kind of operator indeed.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 53/157


On March 2013, Peng Yang increased his investment in Beijing iJoy in the form of valued
intellectual property, rather than cash, to RMB 10.08 million. In China, it is a common
practice for shareholders without the necessary cash to contribute to increase their
company's registered capital via non-cash intellectual assets. The process involves
engaging a valuation firm to appraise the value of so-called "high tech intellectual
property." The valuation firm's report is then presented to the SAIC for approval. The
motivation behind this is to meet the minimum registered capital threshold of 10 million
RMB in order to gain approval for value-added telecommunication licenses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 54/157


Two Suspicious Transactions


Right around the time of this increase in registered capital, VNET issued a loan of 12.885
million RMB ($2.1 million) to Peng Yang.[17] No more than three or four months later
VNET acquired 100% of iJoy. The timing and size of the loan relative to the company's
registered capital made us wonder for what purpose VNET would issue a loan to the seller
of a company it was weeks away from acquiring.


We noticed an even more irregular transaction disclosed on VNET's 2013 20-F[18]:


For the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid RMB61.2million (US$10.1 million) to
Suzhou Aizhuoyi Information Technology Company Limited, a company controlled by
seller of iJoy, for the computer and network equipment purchased by us.


Recall from Exhibit 31 that Suzhou Aizhuoyi (not to be confused with Suzhou Zhouaiyi, i.e.
Beijing iJoy) the company from which VNET bought 61.2 million RMB worth of hardware is
a related party 99% owned by Peng Yang and 1% owned by Peng's father.


A review of Suzhou Aizhuoyi's SAIC filings revealed an even smaller company than iJoy
ever was, with registered capital of one million RMB.


Exhibit 40: SAIC filing of Suzhou Aizhuoyi


(Note: The registered capital was increased from RMB1m to RMB 10m on August 11,
2014)

We do not believe Aizhuoyi ever even existed, since its registered office is not only in the
same exact building as Suzhou iJoy (Technology Plaza, Qianjin Donglu, Kunshan
Development Zone), but also occupied the same room 1505 that we were unable to verify
(recall another unrelated company occupied that room) through November 2013, after
VNET had acquired iJoy, at which point Peng Yang filed with the SAIC to change the
registered office address.


It makes little sense that large publicly listed VNET bought servers from little Suzhou
Aizhuoyi when all logic would point to that transaction going the other way. VNET is
obviously the much larger and more financially capable company with much more scale
economies to exploit in the pedestrian act of buying servers. Interestingly, that was the
only time VNET has ever "bought servers" from an acquired company that we could find.


Both the loan to Peng pre-acquisition and the surprising large purchase of hardware from
a shell company reeked to us, leaving several obvious questions unanswered:


· How exactly did little Suzhou Aizhuoyi, the company with RMB1 million of registered
capital gain a hold of that much valuable equipment at the time of transaction?


· What was the real purpose of this transaction? Could VNET, with all its vendor
relationships, not find a better source from which to procure its hardware?


· What equipment exactly did VNET purchase from Suzhou Aizhouyi?


· How much profit did Suzhou Aizhuoyi and therefore Peng Yang make from this
transaction?


No matter how hard we tried, we could not reconcile the facts that VNET bought a
company with horrible financials not core to either of its major businesses, IDC or MNS,
with no registered office location, with no board of directors, with only minimal registered
capital and only eight employees for RMB 97 million and then immediately bought RMB
61.2 million worth of servers from a shell company controlled by the seller. That was really
strange. Then there was the change in ownership from multiple owners to a single owner
who sold his company less than a year after spending a year buying it for himself and
going through the pain of legally restructuring the company into a dual onshore/offshore
holding structure, right before receiving a large loan from VNET.


Things were getting interesting.


iJoy's Transformation

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 56/157


Literally Incredible Post-Acquisition Performance


The most telling finding related to iJoy is the financial transformation it made right after the
change in ownership in 2012 and then again right after it was acquired into VNET's IDC
business in the beginning of 2Q2014.


Exhibit 41: Summary of iJoy's income statement before and after acquisition by VNET


It is not only iJoy's explosion of growth that is rather difficult to believe. iJoy's improbable
profitability raised our eyebrows as well.


iJoy's gross margin in 2013 and Q1 2014 was 92% and 86% respectively, much higher
than that of the two dominant Chinese CDN players ChinaCache and ChinaNetCenter and
even higher than the number 1 global CDN service provider Akamai Technologies.

ChinaCache 蓝汛 [19] 31.4% 31.4% 30.3%


ChinaNetCenter 网宿 [20] 30.5% 38.7% 36.1%


Akamai Technologies [21] 61.4% 67.6% 69.2%


iJoy 82.0% 92.0% 86.0%


iJoy spent a mere 13% of total net revenues in operating expenses in 2013. Such
extremely high operating leverage is implausible.


What exactly was iJoy doing to turn in such incredible performance? And why was VNET
being so quiet about the cash cow it had clearly acquired for next to nothing? Why was
VNET only talking about Fastweb as its CDN play while never mentioning iJoy in
conference calls, investor meetings, press releases or industry events?


Increasingly Far-Ranging Business Scope


VNET claims iJoy is a CDN software business but before its acquisition in April 2013, the
registered business scope was computer hardware/accessories development and
computer technology service, neither related to CDN.


Exhibit 43: Beijing iJoy's business scope registered with the SAIC


On October 15, 2013, Beijing iJoy modified its business scope by adding technology
import and export. This is a very strange addition. Then on March 28, 2014, iJoy's
registered business scope was modified again to include a variety of data center and
networking areas.

The Taxing Search for iJoy's Products


Wondering how such a tiny company with historically atrocious financial performance
could reinvent itself so many times, we turned to iJoy's own website for answers. iJoy's
corporate website shows three different products for sale: UR-Market, UR-CDN and UR-
Cloud services.

UR-CDN Basic CDN software


UR-Cloud Basic cloud computing software


Confused by the product descriptions and failing to understand how CDN or cloud
computing could be sold as packaged software, which is purportedly what iJoy does, we
tapped our expert network and conducted dozens of interviews for several weeks.


A Complete Unknown Selling Useless Software


Our biggest problem was finding anyone who had heard of iJoy or any of the "UR"
products. We interviewed many management teams, including those of the three
dominant CDN players in China, ChinaCache, ChinaNetCenter (SH:600804) and Dnion
Technology, among other industry veterans. We spoke with over 20 of China's most
successful wireless application developers and operators. We asked them whether they or
any of their teams had heard about 北京阅联 or 苏州卓爱易 as an independent CDN or
cloud computing services provider. The feedback was unanimous. None of them had ever
heard of iJoy.


Towards the end of a multi-week effort, we finally met a telecom industry professional who
had heard of UR-CDN. According to our source, iJoy had tried to persuade China Telecom
to adopt their UR-CDN technology but China Telecom declined, citing poor quality and
reliability as well as lack of scalability as major issues.


We interviewed all the major telcos, all the major third-party CDN service providers and
dozens of content providers (both Web-based and mobile) and the feedback was once
again unanimous. Nobody could see a market for CDN being sold as software for
implementation by whoever would buy such a thing.


Turning to more developed Internet markets to see if there are any precedents for
companies that sell CDN software (as opposed to offering it as a service like all the
successful CDN companies do), we were unable to find any precedent. All our interviews
were negative on the concept of a company that sold CDN software.


After months of trying to find anyone else who had heard of iJoy or might buy their
products, we gave up and turned to the regulatory filings once again to seek clues as to
how iJoy could be making significant revenue and profit for VNET. This time, we struck
gold.


Clues from China's Tax Authority
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 60/157


VNET's 2013 20-F states the following[22]:


Our other income decreased fromRMB11.6 million in 2012 to RMB6.2 million (US$1.0
million) in 2013. Other income in 2012 was primarily attributable to a bargain purchase
gain related to the acquisition of 21VXi'an. Other income in 2013 was primarily attributable
to the value-added tax refund enjoyed by Beijing iJoy.


The VAT refund referenced in the 20-F can only be the result of the sale of qualified
software filed with and approved by China's State Taxation Bureau. On October 13, 2011
the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Bureau jointly announced a rule, Circular
No. 100(2011), with a term effective from January 1, 2011 which permits sellers of PRC
software to be eligible for a VAT refund only if the following conditions are satisfied in
accordance with the State Taxation Bureau's rules and regulation[23].


1. The vendor obtains a testing report issued by independent software test institutions
certified by the governing provincial qualified testing bureau


2. The vendor obtains a Software Certification issued by the local software registration
associations and the Computer Software Copyright Certification issued by China's
Copyright Protection Center


3. The rate of VAT refund is 14% of the contractual value excluding VAT (17%)


Our legal counsel advised us that in order to avoid abuse, the application process is
designed to be complicated and time-consuming, taking at least three months from the
day of application to the State Tax Bureau.


According to China's tax code, an enterprise that sells software must pay VAT rather than
business taxes. Therefore, whatever Beijing iJoy sells to its customers must be software
and not some kind of service.


Based upon SAIC filings and the 2013 20-F, we know Beijing iJoy received a VAT refund
of RMB 4.5 million in Q3 and Q4 2013 which corresponds to taxable revenues recognized
in the period from April 30, 2013 to the end of third quarter of 2013. We estimate iJoy's
software sales below:


Realized contractual value for the corresponding period = VAT refund * 1.17/14%


= 4491 * 1.17 / 14% = 37,532 million


Recognized revenue for the corresponding period = Realized contractual value / 1.17
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 61/157


= 37,532 / 1.17=32,078 million


The recognized revenues from software sales were about RMB 32.1 million, or 86% of
total revenues for the corresponding period.


Since iJoy collected a VAT refund, it must have sold software, and since it must have sold
software, that software must have been registered with China's Copyright Protection
Center. We searched www.ccopyright.com.cn for any computer software developed and
registered by 北京阅联 and finally found some signs that iJoy existed at all. Below is a list
of all of iJoy's computer software with copyright registration records:

These registration records help explain what happened throughout iJoy's timeline. Before
2012, iJoy was focused on developing software for mobile carriers for reading, education,
application download, mobile resource storage and other such uses. As the numbers
show, that did not go very well for iJoy's three co-founders. Having burned through much
of the capital they contributed in 2009 when they started the company, two of them called
it quits while the persistent Peng Yang decided to reinvent the company.


August 2012 was an inflection point. By then, Peng had become sole owner of iJoy and
was well on his way to finalizing the corporate structure that would allow VNET to
eventually acquire his company. As he was busy preparing his company for sale, Peng
ditched any prior focus on mobile software and began registering CDN software with the
copyright authority.


iJoy's Sale of Useless Software to a Trading Company


The nagging question of who would buy iJoy's products remained unresolved until we
remembered that one of iJoy's various business scope changes made little sense:
technology import and export. Why would a tiny Chinese CDN software company find any
business importing and exporting technology?


Exhibit 47: Change of Beijing iJoy's business scope to include import and export of
technology

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 66/157


We were able to obtain evidence that iJoy has in fact successfully sold CDN software
before, but not to anyone investors might expect. After months of due diligence, the only
iJoy customer we were able to verify was none other than state-owned enterprise China
Base Ningbo Group Company ("CBNB"), one of China's largest iron ore importers.


Exhibit 48: July 2013 receipt from sale of iJoy CDN software to CBNB, a top 5 Chinese
iron ore importer



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET47.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 67/157


CBNB's corporate website describes CBNB as a comprehensive trading company
engaged in import and export, trade logistics and automobile sales and services. Imports
include iron ores, asphalt, plastics, liquid chemicals, coal, copper and cotton. But no CDN
software. Exports include steel, textile, garment, hardware machinery and automobile
accessories. But again, no CDN software.


China-Base imports over 15 million tons of iron ore annually and is one of China's five
largest iron ore importers. Why such a company would buy CDN software from a tiny no-
name Chinese company not even its industry peers have heard of, and in such relatively
small amounts to boot, is incomprehensible.


A much more plausible explanation is that Peng Yang has taken advantage of a personal
relationship to forge contracts used to launder into VNET cash received from the pre-
acquisition loan from and the sale of his company to VNET.


The MNS Shell Game


VNET has been most acquisitive into the MNS business which made up roughly one third
of the consolidated revenue in 2013. Before 2014, the year of the monster acquisitions of
iPoo and Dermot, the company's most significant M&A transaction was the acquisition of
two companies referred to as the "Managed Network Entities" from a seller named Cheng
Ran.


Cheng Ran and the Seven MNS Dwarfs (the Fable of the "Managed Network
Entities")

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 68/157


In the children's fable that Disney made famous, Snow White is a plain scullery maid
destined to live a life of misery with seven nondescript dwarfs until she bites the infamous
poisoned apple that puts her in a coma. The fable ends well when Snow White awakens
miraculously to the kiss of a heroic prince who rescues her and makes her a princess and
then it's happily ever after.


The VNET version of this rags to riches fable is no less dramatic than Disney's animated
film. The story starts before the VNET IPO with a man named Cheng Ran who is the
owner of a funky roll-up of seven MNS companies consolidated into two related parent
companies called Beijing Chengyishidai ("CYSD") and Beijing Zhiboxintong ("ZBXT").
Collectively, these seven entities are referred to in VNET's 20-F filings as the "Managed
Network Entities" ("MNS Entities"). Below is a chart that shows the legal structure of the
Managed Network Entities from the latest SAIC filing (post-acquisition by VNET).


Exhibit 49: Corporate Structure of seven Managed Network Entities


MNS Entities Before VNET Acquisition


Like Snow White before her prince, Cheng Ran and his seven MNS dwarfs, CYSD, ZBXT,
ZYTL, YJHT, BKHT, XYHT and BZRH lived a nondescript life. The seven MNS Entities
together were barely profitable as they faced stiff competition in a commoditized industry

with little differentiation beyond price. Top line was growing for everyone as early demand
in the data center services industry grew quickly off a tiny base. But it was a race to the
pricing bottom that nobody could win for a long, long time and is still playing out four to
five years later. The already razor-thin margins were getting squeezed down to around 5%
gross margin and tinier net margins.


MNS Entities After VNET Acquisition


On September 2010, before the 2011 IPO, VNET came to the rescue like Snow White's
charming prince. VNET offered to buy 51% of both CYSD and ZBXT from Cheng Ran for
the fantastic total price of 172.4 million RMB plus a call option to buy 100% of both for the
total price of 270.5 million RMB. Giving the MNS Entities full credit for their run rate
FY2010 financials from Exhibit 51 that works out to a P/E of 104x. For Cheng Ran, it was
like being kissed by the proverbial prince and the deal was done.


What happened immediately after the acquisition was magical indeed.


Exhibit 50: Consolidated Summary Financials for Managed Network Entities Post VNET
Acquisition


Immediately after acquisition and as soon as their financials were consolidated by VNET,
the MNS entities cranked out a record growth quarter that brought in more than half the
prior year's total revenue at a 45% gross margin, a nine-fold improvement, and a 20% net
margin, a 10-fold improvement!

Suddenly, a deal so expensive only a moron would do it turned into the steal of the
century.

profitable, just in time for its 2011 IPO.

What kind of cost synergies might explain this miraculous jump in growth and profitability?
Were the MNS Entities operating under ridiculously punitive contracts with their suppliers
that VNET was able to immediately remedy with their superior ones? Were the MNS
Entities bloated with hundreds of employees that were suddenly laid off?


Looking for rational explanations, we dug through the MNS Entities' SAIC filings. We
found all the red flags iJoy had and then some.


Review of the MNS Entities' SAIC Filings


More Ghost Offices


Every single one of the seven MNS Entities is registered with the SAIC under a ghost
address, meaning none of them has an actual physical office. You can see for yourself in
the virtual tour of the MNS Entities that follows this section.


More Ghost Boards


As with iJoy, the MNS Entities do not just have ghost offices. They also have ghost
boards. All seven MNS Entities hold board meetings with a grand total of one director.


Tiny Registered Capital


Each MNS Entity has registered capital of under one million RMB, which is the minimum
required to enter the bidding process for bandwidth reselling run by potential customers
such as China Mobile and other large third-party bandwidth purchasers. Even stranger is
that several of the MNS Entities did not even pass that low bar despite purportedly being
in the MNS business. BKHT and XYHT only have 30,000 RMB in registered capital.


Minimal Employee Count


Aside from the magnitude of the MNS Entities' improvement in financial performance post-
consolidation, the fact that it occurred so suddenly while employee count decreased
makes the feat even more improbable.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 72/157


Inconsistent Registered Business Scope and Licensing


None of the MNS Entities had registered a business scope that made sense given their
line of business. BKHT, CYSD, XYHT and YJHT are examples, with bizarre entries such
as technology development, information consulting, cultural exchange, conference
service, advertising and logo design.


While looking to confirm business scope for the MNS Entities, we were unable to find
corporate websites for most of them. Only CYSD had a website which had no content
relevant to managing a network service and offered a bunch of consumer Internet service
products instead.


Cheng Ran Missing from Registrations


You would expect the MNS Entities to be registered under their owner, Cheng Ran. But if
Cheng Ran really does own the businesses, he certainly went out of his way to hide that
fact. All seven MNS Entities are registered under Cheng's wife, sister or friend.


It was only after we confirmed that the MNS Entities were really just a network of
bandwidth resellers (refer to following section: "MNS, a Ticking Time Bomb") that this
strange pattern made any sense. Bandwidth reselling is illegal for third parties (non-
telecom carriers), so there is plenty of reason why Cheng Ran would want to hide behind
the names of friendly parties who cannot be investigated since they are not involved in the
operations of his companies. The various registered names serve another important
purpose. In the bidding process for the resale of bandwidth, each bidder can only bid
once. However, some rogue companies register multiple subsidiaries under different
owners to enter multiple bids at once, a process called "wei biao" (围标). Wei biao (围标),
of course, is illegal.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 73/157


Suspicious Ownership Changes Before Acquisition


BKHT and XYHT transferred ownership to ZBXT right before being acquired by VNET. In
the process, XYHT's registered capital went from 30,000 to 100,000 RMB.


SAIC Numbers Show SEC Numbers 51% Overstated


Below are the revenue figures reported to the SAIC by the MNS Entities. Note that for the
full fiscal year 2010, which is the same as calendar year for the MNS entities, the MNS
Entities (i.e. CYSD and ZBXT plus their five subsidiaries) reported RMB 122.89 million.


Exhibit 54: Revenue Reported to SAIC by MNS Entities


VNET acquired the MNS Entities on 9/30/2010 and consolidated them for the full fourth
quarter of 2010. The following comment can be found in their F-1, on page F-33:


The revenue and net profit of Managed Network Entities since the acquisition date
included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
2010 were RMB 60,175,000 and RMB 11,869,000, respectively.


Later in the F-1, on page P-2, VNET breaks out how much revenue the MNS Entities
purportedly did for the first nine months of the year:


Exhibit 55: Revenue from MNS Entities Reported to SEC (F-1 filing) for 1Q2010 - 3Q2010

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 74/157


To state the very obvious, VNET claims that the MNS Entities did more revenue in the first
nine months of 2010 than the MNS Entities told the SAIC they did for the entire year. And
then, they have the audacity to claim that Q4 was by far the best quarter, generating a big
increase of RMB 60.18 million on top of the overstated RMB 125.43 million, bringing the
total to RMB 185.61 million for 2010, or over 51% more than the MNS Entities actually did!


Now we know where some of that fabulous synergy VNET and their accomplice Cheng
Ran found actually came from.


Other Notable MNS Tuck-Ins


On October 19, 2011, ABC acquired 100% equity interest in Guangzhou Gehua ("Gehua")
to expand its MNS business at a total consideration of RMB 77.5 million. To keep the MNS
gravy train going, VNET followed Gehua up with the acquisitions of Beijing Tianwang
Online Communication Technology Co., Ltd ("Tianwang") and Beijing Yilong Xinda
Technology Co., Ltd. ("Yilong") in February of 2013 for a combined consideration of RMB
73 million. We put these three MNS subsidiaries, Gehua and the combined TWYL,
through the same examination as the MNS Entities. The results are summarized below.

A Virtual Tour of VNET's MNS Shells


We visited all seven of the SAIC-registered companies known as MNS Entities as well as
the two subsidiaries TWYL and found that all of them had registered as their headquarters
either ghost offices that did not actually exist or offices that had no evidence of operations
whatsoever. Below are screen shots of the SAIC registrations for each of the seven MNS
entities and pictures that we took in person of their registered office locations.


Our first visit to the MNS Entities was to CYSD, which is supposedly headquartered in
Beijing No. 110, Zhaojia Rd., Room 423A.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 76/157


Our visit revealed that the SAIC-registered headquarters referenced a room that does not
exist, Room 423A. The last room on the floor was 422. Moreover, all the rooms in the
fourth floor were empty.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 77/157


Our next visit was to the wholly owned subsidiary of CYSD, a company called Jijujian
Zhongya Tonglian Network ("ZYTL") that is supposedly headquartered in the 3rd Floor of
Xingang Town in Jiujiang.

Next, we visited ZBXT, supposedly headquartered in Room 5307 of Beijing Zhichunlu No.
111 in Lixiang Plaza.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 79/157


There was a technology company headquartered in Room 5307 but unfortunately it was
not ZBXT. A company called Beijing Neteon Tech occupied that room and there was no
sign of ZBXT in the entire building. We searched the entire building and found in Room
5323 a company named Zhibo Lianhe Tech, which sounded close enough to ZBXT to
investigate. 5323 was a classroom, not a corporate office.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 80/157


We then headed to Fuzhou Yongjiahong Telecommunication Technology ("YJHT"), one of
ZBXT's four wholly owned subsidiaries, supposedly headquartered in Fuzhou No 21-1-
702, Longtingjing. We found no signs of YJHT in what was a residential area and not even
a corporate location.

The second ZBXT subsidiary we visited was Beijing Bikong Hengtong Network ("BKHT"),
supposedly headquartered in Beijing No. 42, Unit 3, Room 418, Shiliu Yuan Beili.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 83/157


By this point, we were not surprised to find an empty office room that had not been
occupied for two years.


The third ZBXT subsidiary we visited was Xinyun Hengtong Network ("XYHT"),
supposedly headquartered in Beijing No. 2, Room 9A, Youanmenwai Daijie.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 84/157


Again we found that the room was empty and has not been occupied in some time. To
make sure there had not been a careless mistake made in XYHT's filing, we checked 9B
as well but no luck. 9B was occupied by a company called Enjiwei where employees had
never heard of XYHT.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 85/157


Finally, we visited the fourth and last subsidiary of ZBXT, a company called Beijing Bozhi
Ruihai Network ("BZRH") supposedly headquartered in Beijing No. 72-B, Room 2605,
West Third Ring, Beilu.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 86/157


This time, we were not even able to check the room due to a sign on the door of Room
2605 that warned "This door does not open". Even if it were to open, it would open to a
company called Renrunda Culture and not BZRH, as the company listing at the lobby
suggests.

productive, as you can see below.

What Business Are They Really In?


Of all the purported facts about VNET's MNS subsidiaries we tried to verify, we had the
hardest time pinning down exactly what business they were really in. From the wildly
inconsistent registered descriptions in the SAIC filings to the lack of corporate websites for



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET72.jpg

most of them to the lack of recognition by any industry insider of the dozens we
interviewed, we found the task impossible.


Confusing the matter further was how some of these MNS companies described
themselves publicly. Some examples follow.


In a job posting on 51Job.com, China's leading consumer job portal, CYSD describes their
business scope as voice service, private line rental, corporate telecom, system integration,
SDH renting and bandwidth renting.


Exhibit 73: Job posting by CYSD on 51Job.com


But on their own website, they describe their core service as ISP (Internet service
provider).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 92/157


Also on 51job.com, ZBXT describes itself as a provider of ISP, private line, bandwidth
rental and fiber rental. Gehua is also an ISP, per their own job posting.

Not Licensed to Offer MNS Services

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 93/157


The main problem with these self-descriptions is that as ISPs, VNET's MNS subsidiaries
are not allowed to resell bandwidth. Only telecom carriers, registered properly with a basic
telecom license, can trade bandwidth among each other.


We checked the license registration records for all MNS Entities and found that CYSD was
only licensed for regional Internet Access Service and Information Services (B-15 & B-25).
Other MNS Entities hold the license for regional Information Services (B-25).

Music Player and Online Gambling: Managed Network Services?


We were thoroughly confused after our diligence of the two subsidiaries TWYL. According
to VNET's 2013 20-F, these two companies principally provide virtual private network
services and managed network services. If that is really the case, we found no evidence of
that in filings, registrations, other public sources or even in these companies' own self-
descriptions.


According to Baike (China's version of Wikipedia), Beijing Tiawang Online's self-reported
description is software developer that also provides internet dial-up, long-distance
telephone and IDC hosting services.[25] We checked their official website and were
surprised to see the website was actually China Unicom's Beijing website.

We later found that Tianwang Online's website is registered under the name Encrypt
Cyber Digital. You can see at the bottom of the home page that Encrypt's website is
owned by Tianwang Online. This website has the exact same content that CYSD's
website has, offering ISP application services to consumers, not businesses.

Our search for signs of life for Yilong Xinda (the other half of TWYL) was quite amusing if
not more productive. We found all job descriptions online for Yilong Xinda were actually
operated by Tianwang Online, which seemed to confirm that the two businesses are really
just one, split for optical purposes only. The job posting on public job board ChinaHR
below shows Yilong and Tianwang are actually the same company.

Our search for MIIT filings revealed that Yilong Xinda is only licensed as an Internet
Content Provider (ICP) and is therefore only allowed to provide Internet content such as
news, music, pictures and other online media.


Exhibit 80: Results of Check on www.miit.cc for Yilong Xinda's Licenses


Wondering why Yilong Xinda too was improperly licensed, and this time licensed for a
business that is very far removed from offering B2B managed network services, we looked
for evidence that it was operational at all, even as an ICP. We found that the website
www.Jeloog.com is operated by Yilong, as confirmed by the same registered address as
Yillong.

Recall that CYSD is one of the two holdcos for the MNS Entities. According to VNET's
2013 20-F, CYSD has operated a private line business (PLB) since 2009. Is it not curious
that during a period of strong double-digit growth, the allocation of IP addresses
decreased by not one but two orders of magnitude for CYSD as of June 30, 2013?


Exhibit 85: Comparison of IP address allocations to CYSD as of June 30, 2013 (L) and
December 31, 2012 (R)


How that technical fact reconciles with CYSD's reported financial performance is beyond
us.


A Sad Ending to the MNS Fable


Alas, it is only in fairy tales that the good times roll on forever unabated. In the real world,
there is only so much money you can launder in before you run out of it.


Predictably, the MNS Entities' explosive breakout performance was not long-lived, and
Cheng Ran had to start taking numbers down. In 2013, margins plummeted by 65% and
the profit contribution to VNET's consolidated financials sank by more than half the prior
year's.

The effect on VNET's consolidated bottom line was obvious as VNET went back into the
red without the MNS Entity gravy train running at full steam.


Exhibit 87: Effect of MNS Entities' Sudden Margin Erosion on VNET's Consolidated
Financials


So what did Mr. Cheng Ran do? Cheng RAN, for the hills, it appears. As disclosed in
VNET's 2013 20-F, he did not get any additional proceeds from the contingent portion of
the purchase consideration for his MNS Entities in 2013 as he missed his profit targets.

MNS, A Ticking Time Bomb


If we are to believe that the MNS Entities and other related acquisitions are mainly shell
companies, there is a good question that remains unanswered.


Let us give these subsidiaries a little benefit of the doubt and assume that they generate
at least a small portion of their reported revenue. Let us assume that they do not exist only
on paper and that they do not generate literally zero revenue, illegitimate or otherwise.


What kind of substantial business, legitimate or not, can be run by a handful of employees
without real offices to work in, without meaningful capital to spend (remember how tiny the
registered capital was for each MNS Entity) and with minimal supervision (hence, the one-
person board meetings and Cheng Ran's notable absence in any of the operating
records)?


The short answer is an illegal one.

Bandwidth Reselling


How Bandwidth Is Distributed in China


Due to antiquated networking infrastructure and a quickly growing Internet industry,
bandwidth in China is a scarce commodity. Even though China has the largest Internet
population in the world and one that is three times larger than the US population, the
country's legacy telecommunications infrastructure is not well-suited to handle all the
bandwidth consumption. This is why the Internet in China is notoriously slow and the
government controls bandwidth trading, allocation and pricing with a tight regulatory fist. A
license is required to do practically anything related to the Internet in China, build a data
center, operate a data center, run an ISP (Internet service provider), offer content to
consumers, etc. and a license to operate as a telco is especially required and practically
impossible to get for everyone but a handful of state-owned companies. These state-
owned companies control the underlying Internet in China and are heavily regulated as to
how they sell bandwidth, for how much and to whom.


At the highest level, bandwidth is mostly supplied by a state-owned monopoly in each half
of China. In the north it is state-owned telco China Unicom (CU). In the south it is state-
owned telco China Telecom (CT). Even other major state-owned companies like leading
mobile carrier China Mobile who may be appropriately licensed to sell bandwidth but are
not given enough allocation by the government must buy bandwidth from the two
dominant licensed telcos (CU and CT) by law. One of the ways the government controls
the bandwidth supply problem is by making it illegal for anyone other than a company in
possession of a general telecom license to sell bandwidth.


Of course, even as state-owned enterprises, the telcos compete with each other, so CU
and CT sell bandwidth at high prices to the smaller telcos to ensure their own industrial
dominance.


Chinese Law Prohibits Bandwidth Reselling


The Chinese telecom industry's laws have changed to suit the times over the years, but it
has never been legal to resell bandwidth without a basic telecom license. The only
bandwidth trading allowed in China is among the licensed telcos themselves through a
network of interconnections to facilitate the traffic flow. Anyone else without a basic
telecommunication business license cannot resell bandwidth nor can they operate
interconnections commercially.


Here are some relevant passages.

China Telecommunication Law 2000


Article 8 The telecommunications business is divided into basic telecommunication
services and value-added telecommunication services. Basic telecommunication
services provide public network infrastructure, public data transmission or basic voice
communication services.


………


Article 9 An applicant to operate a basic telecommunications business shall meet the
following conditions: A. The State-owned stakes or shares in the company shall be no less
than 51%;…


………


Article 13 A telecommunications business operator may not provide telecommunications
resources, public network infrastructure, public data transmission, or connection
services to an organization or individual which has not been granted a
telecommunications business permit.


Revised Catalogue of Telecommunication Services 2013


A14 The first category of data transmission service includes but is not limited to
transmitting IP data packets from customers' origin server to target network by utilizing IP
technology.


Revised Catalogue of Telecommunication Services 2003


Valued added telecom services


B4-2-3: The second category of Internet access services is defined as providing Internet
access services to various users by utilizing access servers and service nodes that are
built up on certain software and hardware sources and connected to public telecom
infrastructure…..Internet access services include two kind of applications, one is to
provide Internet access services to ICPs who provide contents, online trading and online
application services. Another service is to provide Internet access services to end users.


We interviewed several PRC lawyers to discuss the difference between Internet data
transmission services under catalogue of basic telecom services and Internet access
service under that of valued added telecom services. We were told that if the service
recipient is either ICP or end user, data transmission services are categorized as value

added services and the operator of value added services should apply for an ISP (B-25)
license. Otherwise, the provider of data transmission services to telecom carriers should
obtain a basic telecom service license.


With regards to MNS business, the service provider transmits Internet data packets from
one telecom carrier to another carrier by utilizing network address transfer technology. The
recipients of services are telecom carriers or Internet access service providers, rather than
either Internet content providers or end users. Therefore, MNS business is very likely to
be categorized as the basic telecom service (A-14) that requires at least 51% equity
interest invested by a state-owned entity.


China's Grey Market for Bandwidth


As Chinese bandwidth demand surged from the early 2000s, smaller Internet access
providers like China Mobile, China Railcom and the emerging cable TV operators became
so bandwidth-constrained and were so severely squeezed in pricing by the CU/CT telco
duopoly that they turned to an emerging grey market for bandwidth operated by small
traffic trading companies that stayed purposefully small to fly under the telecom authority's
radar and avoid discovery. They would buy bandwidth at favorable prices legally from the
telcos and then resell the bandwidth at a premium by diverting traffic illegally to their
customers using technology to mask their actions (through use of techniques such as IP
routing and optical fiber butting at self-built network access points).


These rogue trading operations became known as Third-Party Private Line Businesses
(PLBs), and the smaller telcos and other large corporate consumers of bandwidth
increasingly turned to them to lower their total cost of procurement.


Exhibit 91: Network topology for a traditional PLB



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET91.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 110/157


As technologies advanced, and competition within the obviously unregulated PLB industry
intensified, the PLBs evolved to offer additional services packaged with their resold
bandwidth, like security and content caching (an effective way to save on bandwidth costs
is to cache content on the network to make it accessible without another network round
trip to access it).


Exhibit 92: Network topology for a PLB2.0


China Telecom and China Unicom's Response to the PLB/MNS Industry


China's system of delegating literally 80% of its bandwidth allocation to two competitive
telcos is clearly not scalable, but it is the system nonetheless, and the dominant telcos
have the legal right and the industrial motivation to squash PLBs. It should come as no
surprise that CT and CU carry out strict network-wide inspections on a regular basis,
maintaining proprietary monitoring systems to ensure compliance and keeping internal
records of customer violations. And when they discover violations, the consequences for
the perpetrators are dire.


PLBs has hurt the financial interest of CT and CU and reduced their competitive
advantages against China Mobile and other carriers. Despite the strong market need for
PLBs, especially as mobile Internet usage has surged in China, CT and CU routinely
crack down on illegal private interconnections, which cause network instability and poor
service quality. In a recent example of how seriously the telcos are willing to pursue
perpetrators, in 2010 China Telecom stopped serving bandwidth to other carriers who had
procured bandwidth from illicit sources and as a result, many China Railcom and China
Mobile end users nationwide were not able to get access to Internet.

VNET's MNS Is Mainly a Front for an Illegal Bandwidth Reselling Operation


How VNET Describes Its MNS Business


In its F-1 registration filing, VNET explains the MNS business with this description.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET93.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 112/157


"Our managed network services are primarily offered in the form of bandwidth, which
is optimized through our proprietary smart routing platform and supplemented by our
hosting area network and our data transmission network. Our managed network
services primarily consist of the following:


• Hosting Area Network Services. Our data centers are distributed throughout China.
We connect most of our data centers with private optical fibers, forming our hosting
area network. Our hosting area network connects the servers housed in our data
centers so that data transmission among our customers can be achieved without
going through telecommunication backbones or internet hubs, enabling secure,
faster and more reliable data transmission.


• Route Optimization. In China, carriers generally operate their independent
systems, and their networks are not connected with each other. Because we are
connected to all major carriers, customers that use services from one carrier can
reach users of other carriers through our network or through other internet hubs. Our
proprietary system is a smart routing platform, which functions like an intelligent
switchboard automatically selecting the best and fastest routes and directing traffic
through our own or others' networks. For example, from our data centers, we can
direct data to the networks of China Telecom or China Unicom, or, when the
networks of China Telecom and China Unicom are congested or otherwise
experiencing problems, to our own transmission networks. Through our proprietary
smart routing technology, we are able to optimize the connectivity of our network and
deliver data in a fast and efficient manner."


Is it really plausible that Cheng Ran and his seven dwarfs can do all that?


That description, while full of buzzwords like "smart routing" and "hosting area network"
and "data transmission network," is a gross misrepresentation of what VNET actually does
in its MNS division.


VNET Is China's Largest PLB


What VNET mainly does in its MNS division is resell bandwidth, procuring it directly from
the only entities that can supply it legally in China, the state-owned telcos and some
smaller government-affiliated networks with the appropriate telecom licenses. And without
question, when VNET resells bandwidth, it does so illegally, because the only licenses

that VNET has are an IDC license to build and operate data centers and an ISP license to
offer Internet services to customers. VNET does not have and never has had a basic
telecommunications license.

VNET's MNS network is nothing more than a front for a major PLB operation, which we
believe is China's largest. VNET basically admits this fact in its own description, "Our
managed network services are primarily offered in the form of bandwidth…" All the other
flowery talk of optimization and hosting within its MNS division is largely a hoax. Could

knows how to trade bandwidth illegally. Our many interviews with industry insiders pegged
Mr. Chen as one of the pioneers in the PLB space and one of the larger operators of PLB
networks.


Chen's humble beginnings illustrate how low the barriers to entry are for PLBs and how
little resource is required to set one up. Cheng Ran was a telecom engineer who worked
at Beijing Teletron Engineering Company ("Beijing Teletron," 北京电信通电信工程有限公
司) and moonlighted as a bandwidth pirate while working a full-time job. His moonlighting
initiatives began in 2006 and by 2008, he found enough success to quit his day job and
run a PLB full-time.


VNET's network of PLBs which feature Cheng's MNS Entities has gone undiscovered
because it is spread out across many smaller acquired subsidiaries each with their own
shells to better hide their illegal trading activities from the telcos. This explains why the
MNS Entities' SAIC filings show an overly complicated corporate structure of shell
companies registered under various individuals' names without any physical locations, all
the harder to track. It is also easier for multiple seemingly unrelated companies to
provision bandwidth from the telcos without getting outed as a related PLB operation that
pools that bandwidth for resale.


VNET's Largest MNS (PLB) Customer Is China Mobile


We extensively interviewed some of China's more prominent PLB operators as well as
leading companies in the data center industry to gain a better understanding of how the
PLB market is split among its larger participants.


We found consensus on three key points.


1. There are three key purchasers of PLB services: China Mobile, China Railcom and
cable TV operators as a group. The total market for PLB is about 1,000 Gbps, of which
China Mobile represents about 600, China Railcom about 300, and the cable operators
about 100.


2. The level of sophistication varies widely among these purchasers. The execution price
paid by China Railcom is the highest, up to 100,000-150,000 RMB/Gbps/month. China
Mobile pays the least, roughly 60,000-90,000 RMB/Gbps/month. In 2014, with about 1,000
Gpbs of demand, the PLB market size is approximately 1.2-1.5 billion RMB.


While China Railcom pays the most, it is also the customer that is hardest to get. They
have trained third-party bandwidth purchasing organizations since 2002 that have built
relationships with small suppliers for over a decade, so newer entrants like VNET stand
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 117/157


little chance of servicing them.


3. Most of VNET's PLB efforts are focused on China Mobile. Unfortunately for VNET, CM
is such a sophisticated bandwidth buyer that they have their own systematic dynamic
pricing system based on local reverse auctions run for PLBs to bid for their business. This
has crushed VNET's MNS margins recently.


As we did our field work, it became obvious that China Mobile is indeed VNET's largest
PLB and therefore MNS customer. Screen shots of results from local China Mobile
bandwidth auctions follow.

Why does VNET not disclose very proudly a Tier 1 customer like China Mobile in its filings
and in its investor presentations and earnings calls?


The obvious answer is that there is nothing to be proud of in operating an illegal rogue
operation for as much as 35% of your total revenue.


The not so obvious answer is that the revenue is about to go away.


MNS Revenue at Great Risk


VNET Blacklisted by State-Owned Telcos


We confirmed with numerous industry insiders that the telcos were catching on to what
was going on within VNET's MNS business. Unbeknownst to VNET at the time of their
acquisitions, many of their illicit shells had already been blacklisted or sent "cease and
desist" warnings for violations.


Regulatory Intervention to Obsolete PLB


If law enforcement forces are unable to regulate the PLB industry as is often the case with
grey markets that service legitimate markets, market forces driven by regulatory change
will.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET98.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 122/157


Even more damning than the proof of VNET's illegal MNS operations is our finding that the
Chinese telecom authorities are finally waking up to the realities of their antiquated
method of managing national bandwidth procurement, allocation and distribution. We were
notified that recently, China Mobile and China Telecom have entered into a new mutual
agreement to set forth new standards for the financial settlement of inter-networks
bandwidth link-up. As stipulated in the agreement, CM and CT will increase the scale of
traffic peering with lower fees for Internet backbone interconnections. In the coming few
months, CT and CM will establish new NAPs (network access points) to enlarge total
interconnection capacity by an estimated 150-200 Gbps as a first step.


When this happens, it is inevitable that CM and CU will enter into a similar alliance to
solve the problems of backbone interconnection. Such a major unified step forward in the
commercial development of China's Internet backbone would effectively obsolete PLBs.


We were also notified recently that in recent months, as requested by the MIIT, more
NAPs have been built and opened to enlarge total interconnections among telcos.
Regions so far include Wuhan, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Chengdu
and Xi'an.


Whether consciously, by recognition that they need to start weaning themselves off the
illicit PLB teat, or because they recognize how fragile the MNS revenue really is as
violation notices from telcos keep mounting, PLB is clearly losing share of VNET's
revenue and VNET is clearly losing share of the PLB market.

How will VNET replace all the lost MNS revenue? What will VNET do if the primary place
from which it fabricates financials is obsoleted?


Enter iPoo and Dermot.


iPoo: VNET's Longtop Moment


Every Ponzi scheme reaches a critical point at which it begins to collapse under its own
weight. Similarly, we believe the massive back to back acquisitions of iPoo and Dermot
mark the peak of VNET's financing-driven bubble. Although sell-side analysts and
investors alike have focused on their potential impact to VNET's P&L assuming that VNET
is a going concern, we draw your attention to the balance sheet instead because we do
agree VNET is a huge concern, but not of the going variety.


As discussed previously (see Exhibit 28), VNET will require another RMB 2.4 billion ($396
million) if it goes through with the planned 17,000 cabinet ramp through 2015. That would
take its net debt from the current post-Dermot RMB 1.6 billion ($261 million) to RMB 4.0
billion ($657 million), not quite double. The acquisitions of iPoo and Dermot alone have
more than doubled VNET's leverage and next year's cabinet goal would nearly double it
again.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 124/157


Given the amount of balance sheet risk VNET is taking this year, can any reward offset
that kind of risk? What is VNET getting in their biggest purchases ever, which together
exceed the cumulative consideration of all their past acquisitions?


Persona Non Grata of the Broadband Industry


To say iPoo is a troubled, unwelcome company with little industrial support is not an
opinion. It is a statement of fact. We point investors to the following facts.


Rejected by the People


No less than five different government-affiliated organizations have already responded
negatively to iPoo to varying degrees over the past three years. Since iPoo is a consumer
"last mile" broadband company, we will start with state-owned CCTV, China's dominant TV
broadcast company which featured iPoo in an exposé warning consumers about
fraudulent consumer broadband operators. An online replay of the program can be viewed
here.


The exposé highlights iPoo's poor product quality, complete lack of customer service and
the illegal operations in the city of Changsha in which iPoo claims to have a business but
has not been authorized by the local telecom authority. Mr. Chen, a duped customer, had
the following to say:


"I cannot access my [iPoo] broadband, it keeps showing that the connection is not
working…. [Then in response to whether he had called customer service:] I called for
five, six days, but nobody answered the phone. I called the Telecom Administration
Bureau and they told me the only three legal broadband operators are China
Telecom, China Unicom and Great Wall. They don't have [iPoo] on the legal operator
list!"


The reporter then gives the following public service announcement:


"We received a lot of calls regarding [iPoo's] broadband problem and we encourage
viewers to call us if you find more issues and we encourage the government to look
into this issue."


The SAIC, a department of the central government, corroborates the key points from the
CCTV exposé in this article. We urge investors unable to read Chinese to use Google
Translate to give that report a skim. The article reports false advertising, lack of service

(as in, payment made, zero service provided), terrible customer service (as in, no
customer service at all) and technology that simply does not work upon installation. Is it
any surprise that Aipu's unhappy customers reportedly logged 120 complaints per day?


iPoo, on Watch by the Government, Already Banned in Three Cities


The regulators of not just Changsha, as reported by CCTV, but also two major Chinese
cities-Guangzhou (a Tier 1 City) and Wuhan-have already banned iPoo from building or
operating a consumer last-mile broadband network in their cities. iPoo admits these facts
in their own IPO filing from June of last year:


"根据《中华人民共和国电信条例》第七条规定"国家对电信业务实行许可证制度"，公司依
旧存在未取得用户驻地网经营资质，持因特网接入经营许可证经营用户驻地网业务，被武


汉、广州经营所在地通信管理局出具行政处罚风险，从而影响公司经营"


Translation: According to the 7th rule of China's Telecom Laws, Licensing and Permit to
Telecom service, [iPoo] failed to obtain the required local access network operator license
while using Internet access permit instead to operate local access networks.
Consequently, our business was affected by the government's penalty and ban from doing
business in Guangzhou and Wuhan.


The following notice from the China Telecom Administration of the enormous Guangdong
province make iPoo's own admission crystal clear.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 126/157


Stiff-Armed by the Chinese SEC, I-Poo-O Fails


So far, we count four government organizations whose opinions of iPoo are far from
supportive (CCTV, SAIC, Guangzhou government, Wuhan government). China's securities
exchange commission makes it five.


In June 2013, iPoo filed an IPO prospectus in anticipation of a public offering later this
year in China's A-Share market[28]. We have obtained and uploaded the document (in
Chinese) here. Those who cannot read Chinese need not fret, you will not miss much.
Suffice it to say the IPO was not approved when China's Securities Commission reviewed
the application on January 2014[29].


The state will probably never release the exact reasons for rejecting the application.
However, it is not hard to find industry executives who mention accounting problems along
with governance issues and iPoo's widely known past transgressions as reasons for the
failed listing, especially since some of those executives include iPoo's own employees.
Throughout our due diligence, iPoo's employees were among our best sources of
information about their own company.


A Commoditized, Overleveraged Declining Business


Aside from iPoo's penchant for angering customers with false advertising and lack of
service, the failure to obtain the appropriate licenses to operate in all its regions and the
bans in major cities that it was dealing with, iPoo had other more fundamental business
problems. For one, its business is shrinking rather rapidly:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 127/157


This trend is no surprise to anyone familiar with the telecom industry in China which, by
the way, includes iPoo's own Lei Ke, a Vice President who had the following to say to
government-affiliated Chongqin Evening News[31]:


"Aipu's broadband business has reached a bottle-neck with profit margin dropping
lower. Low-profit broadband operators are in urgent need of restructuring."


That was on December 2012, almost two years ago. "Immediate" already happened a
long time ago. Last-mile broadband access is not where the action was then and it
certainly is not where the action was last quarter, when VNET paid an enormous sum for a
declining commoditized business.


Why would VNET, purportedly growing at a long-term CAGR of 30-40%, buy a business
that is so saturated and commoditized that even its own executives admit it freely in media
interviews?


Although we cannot fathom a guess, it certainly could not have been for the financials. Not
only is iPoo low in profit and declining, it is also the most leveraged company in its peer
group even when compared to businesses many multiples larger in size that have much
larger fixed asset requirements.


Exhibit 102: Debt-to-Asset Ratio for iPoo and Comparable Companies[32]


An iPoo employee who was sick of working at the terribly managed eroding business that
he believes iPoo is went as far as writing a public letter neatly summarizing iPoo's various
fundamental problems[33]. Per the former employee's own admission (translated):



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/10/saupload_VNET102.jpg
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 128/157


"Aipu faces many problems such as a decline in user base, lacking capex to
upgrade its network, revenue lost every month and service quality issues … Aipu's
enemy is not China Unicom, Not China Telecom, Not Dr.Peng, but itself."


Apparently, it wasn't just VNET employees who felt that way.


Insiders' Garbage, VNET's Treasure


History of iPoo Insider Valuation Marks[34]


If insiders are most in the know at their own companies, especially when they are private,
then watching their actions are most telling. Indeed, iPoo insiders' actions speak much
louder than any angered employee's or duped customer's words. The history of insiders'
view on what iPoo is worth is tragically comical.


In 2010, Aipu Investment, a captive investment fund within iPoo, attempted a sale of
27.5% of its equity stake in its parent company iPoo for RMB 27.5 million in China
Southwest United Asset and Equities Exchange. This implied a valuation of RMB 100
million for iPoo. However, not one bidder showed up.


In November 2011, domestic private investment firm JD Capital invested RMB 46 million in
iPoo for 17% ownership, valuing the company at RMB 250 million. The 49.9 million of net
income that iPoo disclosed for 2011 in its IPO prospectus would make the JD Capital mark
approximately 5x trailing P/E.


In 2012, Chengdu Guotao Investment ("Guotao") sold their 22.5% stake in iPoo for RMB
27.5 million. The RMB 92.37 million in net profit that iPoo reported for 2012 in its IPO
prospectus sets the Guotao mark at a lowly 1.4x trailing P/E. Not exactly a vote of
confidence from the second largest shareholder.


Unfortunately, we did not get a mark in 2013 because the I-Poo-O flopped. However, we
got the mother of all marks in 2014. On June 4, 2014, VNET agreed to acquire iPoo for
the whopping valuation of RMB 1.4 billion[35], paying the first RMB 700 million installment
up front.


Our inquiries to VNET's management resulted in a vague response that stated about half
of the acquisition was agreed to be paid in cash. Our sources differ and confirm that iPoo's
sellers have asked for 100% cash. That would certainly be more aligned with past insider
behavior and the way the transaction will be consummated since the iPoo acquisition will
not use a VIE structure and iPoo's institutional shareholders are domestic firms that
cannot be paid in anything but RMB. The very large cash component (if it is not 100%
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 129/157


cash) would also explain why the Chinese media reported that VNET plans to raise an
incremental one billion RMB of debt to fund the acquisition of iPoo, which the company
has yet to discuss with US investors.


VNET's Whopper of a Price in Context


To put the enormous RMB 1.4 billion price tag that VNET put on iPoo in perspective, it is
not enough to simply refer to Guotao's 2012 mark. After all, that is bottom picking a bit and
2012 was two years ago. A lot can change in two years… such as iPoo's financials, which
shed 25% of its 2012 top line and 45% of its 2012 bottom line. That makes VNET's price
on a P/E basis over 2,000%, or 20x, higher than the Guotao valuation.


As far as comps go, the next best thing to an internal mark is a direct competitor's
precedent acquisition value. As luck would have it, Great Wall, the dominant non-state-
owned last-mile bandwidth provider in China was acquired by Dr. Peng, a publicly listed
company (in the A-Share market) in two tranches, 50% at a price of RMB 600 million in
December 2011 and 50% at a price of RMB 712 million in December 2012. Dr. Peng's
blended acquisition valuation was RMB 656 million.


VNET paid 2.13x more for iPoo than Dr. Peng did for Great Wall. Naturally, we must ask,
is iPoo more than twice the business Great Wall is?


After the iPoo deal announcement, CICC issued a sell-side report on June 5, 2014 with
the following stats for iPoo and its two largest direct competitors, Great Wall and Founder.


Exhibit 103: Key metrics for top three "last-mile" broad band companies


We note that CICC got iPoo's 2013 revenue figures wrong. iPoo projects RMB 500 million
for 2014. In 2013, their revenue projection at the time of the IPO prospectus was actually
higher, RMB 650 million.


For a business that is literally 6 times larger than iPoo by either revenue or by user base,
Dr. Peng paid less than half the price VNET paid for iPoo.


The Pony In the iPoo

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 130/157


In so many ways, the iPoo acquisition makes absolutely no sense. Certainly not from a
strategic sense, not from a shareholder value perspective and not from a debt holder's
perspective either. But as they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.


iPoo, viewed from the eyes of a serial acquirer with nefarious intentions, makes all the
sense in the world.


VNET has some major structural problems to deal with. They need to continue showing
strong growth in the core IDC business, which requires enormous amounts of cash to
sustain. That cash needs to be financed, which requires that the company be able to show
positive and growing EBITDA to be able to raise debt. Since the core business generates
no EBITDA, VNET has to find it in non-core businesses that it must keep acquiring to
manufacture revenue (AR and FCF be damned), since none of the acquired businesses
have proven to be able to keep up with the promises for core business growth VNET has
sold to investors. The great majority of them have not even sustained themselves, let
alone kept pace with growth.


The difficulty of keeping the financing-fueled growth has increased dramatically as the
financings and the acquisitions got bigger. That MNS revenue is being jeopardized by
regulators catching on and the MNS industry is in overall margin free fall are not helping.
And that little iJoy is being squeezed for all it is worth, all 100% net margin's worth, puts a
limit on where else the company can go to find the financial growth promised to investors.


iPoo is a critically necessary acquisition for VNET as all these problems increasingly
pressure the balance sheet as an epic capacity expansion period begins. The exact same
can be said of Dermot.


Have we not seen this movie before?


Giantstone, Part II


The similarities between VNET and Longtop Financial, arguably the most famous US-
listed Chinese fraud of all time, are endless. But we need to only focus on one: when the
music stopped, and why.


Like VNET, Longtop manufactured revenue by laundering cash into the business as
revenue, using both falsified core business contracts and round-tripped acquisition
proceeds to promise unending long-term growth to investors. Both companies' AR and
DSOs shot up as fast (for VNET faster) than any metric on the income statement that
public market investors seem to focus on at the exclusion of everything else. So the
mounting debt and AR went unnoticed until Longtop's Ponzi got so out of control that the
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 131/157


only way a balance sheet disaster could be averted was to buy more time with the largest
possible acquisitions that were available. Longtop acquired Giantstone in the largest deal
it ever did by a very large margin, and used the acquired subsidiary primarily as a vehicle
to roundtrip acquisition proceeds in as revenue, fueling the stock price until one of two
things was to happen: either the core business actually started to deliver or until the next
large acquisition was executed. Longtop collapsed and was delisted soon thereafter.


Those are the key similarities. Now on to the differences which are even more important.


The urgency with which VNET did two very substantial acquisitions, back to back, and the
incredibly low quality of iPoo in particular stand out even from the Giantstone precedent.
Then there is the severity of the balance sheet damage VNET is willing to inflict in its
quixotic quest to build what is, at the current ridiculous pace, destined to become a data
center ghost town. At least Longtop was a software and service business without the need
to invest so heavily in fixed assets that depreciate as they sit severely underutilized. The
sheer volume of acquisitions that VNET has done to date, which puts it on par with
Chinese peers ten or even thirty times its size, and the percentage of market cap and total
revenue that VNET acquires and raises every year makes VNET unique in the ADR
space. And let us not forget another VNET differentiator, its audacity to generate as much
as a third of its total revenue illicitly and acquire to do more of it. Also worth another
mention is the fact that management never decides to acquire anything that is truly
strategic, a core part of its IDC business, never putting their money where their mouth is.
Quite telling indeed.


Conclusion


VNET's story is one that we plan to continue telling. Consider this report part 1 of several
more. In future editions, we plan to cover less critical topics such as Dermot (since the
deal is not closed yet) and the cloud partnership (since it is but 3% of revenues at the
moment and in our opinion doomed).


The purpose of this report was to set forth our key findings from six months of
investigative work so that investors, long or short, could consider them and act
accordingly. While some of what we have stated is in fact opinion, we humbly suggest that
the majority of what we presented is inarguable. In our concluding thoughts, we would like
to remind you of some of these points.


· VNET has misrepresented its IDC network assets and performance. While some may
argue about the accuracy of our findings, as extensively researched as they were, there is
no denying that VNET has claimed to be operating 72 data centers when a significant
5/23/2018 21Vianet Group Exposed - 21Vianet Group (NASDAQ:VNET) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 132/157


percentage of their outsourced data center partnerships have been terminated. By our
count, it's over 50%, which results in roughly a quarter of the cabinets being overstated
and all the EBITDA being stripped away, but someone else may spend the three months
we spent and come forth with a marginally different number. In our view, the question is
binary and not one of degree. Either VNET overstated IDC figures or it did not, and the
evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the former.


· According to the SAIC, VNET has misrepresented the financials of at least some if not all
of its acquired companies. While the SAIC is not the SEC, the discrepancy is large and
impossible to ignore, particularly for a company for which M&A appears to be a critical
priority.


· Almost a full third of VNET's revenues come from a business unit that VNET rarely talks
about and is almost universally known as illicit in Chinese IDC circles. China Telecom, the
largest fixed line carrier in China and one of two monopolistic players in the telco industry,
has blacklisted VNET and various of its MNS subsidiaries for breaking the law. How any
investor attributes any value to this business line is beyond us.


· VNET has raised over half its market cap in various financings of equity and debt since
its listing in 2011 and burned a substantial portion of it building a highly underutilized (and
overstated) network of IDCs. The other substantial portion, more than half, has been spent
on two dozen non-core acquisitions, the majority of which have failed as businesses.


· Despite such poor return on invested capital (whether invested in fixed assets, non-core
assets or shells) and an IDC network that is clearly underutilized (even when you use
VNET's overstated figures), VNET's margins have held within a tight band for practically
ever. This makes zero sense and begs many questions as to how it is possible.


· VNET's balance sheet is scary. It is. The rate of growth in net debt, the even greater rate
of growth in AR and DSOs and the amount of acquisitions and their unknown impact are
not good complements to a free cash outflow of nearly 30% of the past three years'
revenues. If you cast the overstated income statement aside for a moment, VNET is the
very picture of a terminally ill company. That alone makes VNET a fantastic short. The rest
is almost merely icing on a very big cake.


· The timing of almost all if not all the many acquisitions VNET has done, all but one tiny
intercompany transaction being non-core to IDC, is uncanny. Right before an IPO, right
before a big financing, right before a large cabinet deployment or IDC build, right as
margins are beginning to show some compression, right as previously acquired
businesses are slowing or even declining… Uncanny.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 133/157


· That highly suspicious timing does not go well with the types of acquisitions VNET does.
The illicit MNS Entities with no visible operations anywhere, iJoy the shell with 100% net
margins that sells to iron ore trading companies a ridiculous product that no other software
company in the world sells and iPoo, perhaps the most overvalued company we have ever
seen. It is little wonder that VNET's M&A track record is horrific, with most of the
companies it has acquired being shut down, disposed of, or seriously degraded.


What does this all mean? It means the business you thought VNET had is not really what
it has. How different it is in actuality is up to interpretation.


An Educated Estimate of VNET's Actual Financials


The following summary financials compare key line items from VNET's reported income
statement to the same figures pro forma everything we were able to verify, particularly the
overstated IDC metrics and the overstated MNS revenue and margins. We would like to
remind investors that as bad as our numbers look next to VNET's, the reality is that they
still include a very significant portion of MNS revenue, which we value at zero but have
kept in our analysis anyway to give Cheng Ran and his cronies the benefit of the doubt
that they do not deserve.


Exhibit 104: VNET's reported income statement vs. pro forma without fabricated revenues


We have yet to make an investment recommendation throughout this entire report, so we
will make one now. Consider the following analysis. It shows what happens to your
investment, no matter which security you hold or where you hold it, if any significant debt
holder reads this report and agrees with even one or two of the points we just made
above.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2484305-21vianet-group-exposed 134/157


In other words, it only takes one significant lie or misrepresentation to bust a covenant,
and as we stated, VNET's balance sheet is outright scary. Know your place in the capital
structure because we believe a lot of investors are going to get wiped out.
