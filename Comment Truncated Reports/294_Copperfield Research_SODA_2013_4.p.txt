SODA - Here We
Go Again
Jul. 24, 2014 2:29 PM ET4 comments | Includes: SodaStreâ€¦


Every few months SodaStream seems to have a flurry of rumors that a buyout
is imminent. From Israeli newspapers, citing "anonymous" sources, to now
Bloomberg, citing sources a buyout with "a" financial buyer in imminent, the
rumors always seem to occur shortly before bad news. We previously shared
our opinions on SODA's severe accounting and business model-centric
challenges. The stock was in the $60's then, and we revisited the stock in the
$40's when a small, promotional hedge fund manager tried to create a short
squeeze by vocalizing his elevator pitch long thesis, supported by survey work.
Now could SODA get bought? Absolutely. While we believe it is highly unlikely
a strategic would buy SODA, it would be imprudent to discount private equity
(despite the cash flow challenges SODA has had, which would make debt
servicing problematic at a time the largest market opportunity, the U.S. is set
to roll over).


We'll keep this short and to the point. We think business at SODA is bad. It is
worth contemplating how bad business must be if Bloomberg is remotely close
suggesting SODA would consider a $40 take out. That seems like a sub-
optimal exit for a management team that as recently as their analyst day had
the goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2016 (which would seem to imply $10 of
pre-tax EPS).


Three points to consider:


1) Jonah Lloyd, who was an integral component of the SODA story since the
IPO left the company a few weeks ago. Would he have unceremoniously left
(regardless of his new opportunity) if a buyout were imminent?


2) Just last month, Daniel Birnbaum filed a Form 144 with the SEC, registering
approximately $2.6 million of stock for sale. Would Daniel have been able to
sell stock with the knowledge a buyout was possible? Would he have actually
sold stock had this been the case?

3) What would any potential buyer do about the significant risk of SODA
flavors at retail that are past their expiration dates? Yes, we believe this is an
issue, especially considering the lack of flavor reserves SODA appears to have
accrued. We look forward to hearing about the inventory issues we believe
exist on next week's call. That is of course assuming, the purported financial
buyer has not swallowed SODA for $40 by then.
