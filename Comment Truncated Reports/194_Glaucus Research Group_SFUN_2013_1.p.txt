THIS RESEARCH REPORT EXPRESSES OUR OPINIONS. Use Glaucus Research Group California, LLC’s research opinions at 
your own risk. You should do your own research and due diligence before making any investment decision with respect to the 
securities covered herein. This is not investment advice nor should it be construed as such.  We are short SFUN and therefore stand 
to realize significant gains in the event that the price of the stock declines.  Please refer to our full disclaimer on page three of this 
report.  


We believe that the founder and Chairman of SouFun Holdings Limited (“SouFun” or the 
“Company”), which owns and operates a real estate website in China, has diverted resources from 
the Company for personal use through a series of questionable transactions involving high-priced 
New York real estate and charities of dubious authenticity.  SouFun’s VIE structure demands that 
shareholders have full faith in the integrity of the Chairman because it is he, ultimately, who owns 
and controls the operating business in China.  We believe that SouFun’s Chairman has irrevocably 
broken the trust of shareholders, rendering, in our view, the Company’s shares only as valuable as 
the Chairman’s apparent respect for his fiduciary duties.        


1. Queen of Versailles. In 2011, a charity under the control of the Chairman and his wife 
purchased the Arden House, an iconic American palace.  Although, to our knowledge, the 
mansion is never disclosed in the Company’s public filings and is not included on the 
Company’s balance sheet, evidence suggests that Company resources are used to operate (and 
possibly were used to purchase) the mansion for the personal benefit of the Chairman and his 
wife: 


a. Real Estate Brokers Know Best.  The real estate brokers for the sellers of the Arden 
House claim to have sold the property to SouFun.


b. Registered Address. The Arden House deed lists SouFun’s New York headquarters as 
the owner’s address.


c. Staffed by the Company. An employee of SouFun appears to administer the Arden 
House website through his Company email address.  An investigator visited the property, 
and was greeted by the SouFun employee listed on the website, who gave our 
investigator his SouFun email address.  


d. Ineligible Charity? The charity that purchased the Arden House is not on the IRS list of 
organizations eligible to receive tax-exempt donations, nor could we find any evidence of 
bona fide charitable operations.  


2. No Training at 72 Wall Street?  In 2011, the Company purchased another New York 
landmark, the AIG building at 72 Wall Street, for $61 million, ostensibly to serve as a training 
center operated by another not-for-profit controlled by the Chairman.  


a. Missing Charitable Donations.  SouFun claims to have paid over $2 million to a charity 
operated by its Chairman in 2011.  However, publicly available IRS records state 
unequivocally that the same charity received less than $50,000 in 2011.  In our view, the 
likely explanation is that the Chairman misappropriated the funds as the charity never 
received the money.


b. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.  Site visits and interviews with the doormen at 72 Wall 
Street indicate that 20 months after SouFun’s purchase, the building is still virtually 
empty and has not been used as a training center.

c. Wasteful or Corrupt? The purchase of 72 Wall St. is inherently suspicious.  Why would 
the Company even rent, much less purchase some of the world’s most expensive real 
estate in downtown Manhattan to train employees based in China, 7,000 miles away?  
AIG used the building for training its 116,000 global employees (an estimated half of 
which were located in the US).  Why would SouFun require a 325,000 sq ft. space to 
train only 7,743 employees, almost all of whom work in China?  


3. National Lampoon's Corporate Vacation.  In March 2012, the Company purchased 44 
hotel rooms at a 5-star beach resort on Hainan Island for $13 million, ostensibly to serve as a 
corporate office and for “internal training.”  This is yet another example of corporate funds 
being used to purchase an ideal vacation property that does not appear necessary to SouFun 
training or operations. 


4. The Company You Keep.  The Chairman and his wife hired the disgraced former CFO of 
Longtop Financial, a notorious fraud that wiped out over $1 billion in shareholder value, to 
serve as the chairman of the audit committee of Shun Cheong Holdings (HKEX: 0650), a 
public company on the Hong Kong exchange which they control and in which the couple 
holds a 60% stake.


5. Adventures in Accounting.  SouFun’s parted with auditors in 2004 and 2007 due to concerns 
with the Company’s accounting.  Even though the auditors have changed, management has 
not. 


6. Costly and Unsustainable Dividends.  The bull case for SouFun centers on the fact that 
SouFun paid three special dividends in 2011 and 2012 ($273 million in aggregate).   In our 
view, this dividend policy is unsustainable and leads the market to vastly understate the 
Company’s cost of capital.  


7. The Vulnerable VIE.  SouFun’s VIE structure gives the Chairman ownership and control 
over the operating business in China.  Shareholders must therefore have full faith and trust in 
his integrity, because the value of their shares are contingent on the value of a call option to 
transfer control of the operating business to its foreign owners in the event of a dispute 
with the Chairman – a contractual right which may be unenforceable given that Chinese 
law does not permit foreign entities to own PRC-based internet companies.  Even if, in a 
perfect world, such a right was enforceable under Chinese law, shareholders can only enforce 
it by prevailing in a Chinese court against rich and powerful Chinese citizens who own 
the operating business – which seems highly unlikely.  


We are not aware of any foreign shareholder successfully exercising such an option to take 
control over an operating PRC business against the will of its founder or chairman.  By 
comparison, the capital markets are littered with cautionary tales of investors burned by 
unethical leadership in China who simply abscond with the operating business and leave 
investors in the US with few viable remedies.  Investors must therefore trust leadership 
completely.  We believe that SouFun’s Chairman has irrevocably broken the trust of 
shareholders, rendering, in our view, the Company’s shares only as valuable as the 
Chairman’s apparent respect for his fiduciary duties.

SOUFUN HOLDINGS LTD. (“SouFun” or the “Company”), owns and operates a real estate and home 
furnishing website in China. Unlike traditional companies in which the shareholders have a direct 
ownership interest in the operating business, SouFun is structured as a VIE in which the Chairman owns 
and controls the operating businesses in China.  SouFun’s VIE structure is vulnerable because rather than 
an ownership interest, shareholders hold only the contractual right to the economic benefits of the 
operating business – contractual rights which, if push comes to shove, shareholders can only enforce by 
prevailing in a Chinese court against rich and powerful Chinese citizens who own the operating 
business.  


SouFun’s VIE structure therefore demands that shareholders have full faith in the integrity of the 
Chairman because it is he, ultimately, who controls the assets and the business.  The Chinese ADR 
landscape is littered with cautionary tales of investors burned by unethical leadership in China: after 
management is caught breaking rules, they simply abscond with the operating business, leaving 
investors in the US with few viable remedies.  


We believe that SouFun’s Chairman has irrevocably broken the trust of shareholders.  In this report we 
present compelling evidence which, in our view, indicates that he diverted resources from the Company 
for personal use through a series of questionable transactions involving high-priced New York real estate 
and charities of dubious authenticity.  


I. Queen of Versailles


On November 18, 2011, the New York real estate market was abuzz over the $6.5 million sale of an 
iconic gilded age mansion, the Arden House, a 100,000 square foot palace with 97 guest rooms built by 
railroad tycoon E.H. Harriman in 1909. The Arden House is an American icon, located 40 miles from 
Manhattan and donated by the Harriman family to Columbia University in 1950 to serve as the home of a 
prestigious foreign policy study group.


The Arden House – An Iconic American Mansion


The Arden House’s buyer of record was a New York based not-for-profit named the Research Center on 
Natural Conversation, Inc. (“RCNC”).  According to public records, available by application to the 
Secretary of State of the State of New York, RCNC is controlled by SouFun’s founder and Chairman, 
Vincent Tianquan Mo (“Chairman Mo”) and his wife Jing Cao (an excerpt of the certificate of 
incorporation is included below).  The couple formed the charity four weeks before the purchase of the 
landmark property.

There is evidence to suggest that Company resources are used to operate (and possibly were used to 
purchase) the Arden House, even though the not-for-profit is ostensibly privately owned and controlled 
by the Chairman and his wife.  


Sellers Claim that the Arden House was Sold to SouFun


In an article published at the time of the transaction, the real estate brokers for the sellers, Colliers 
International, told reporters that in the process of marketing the property they approached SouFun
because the Company had recently purchased the AIG building at 72 Wall Street.  “I thought this would 
be a perfect adjunct, as this property has 97 guest rooms and various amenities on it,” said Richard 
Warshauer of Colliers International.  The article then states that “SouFun first toyed with the idea of 
buying the land through an established non-profit. The company ultimately started the Research 
Center on Natural Conservation as its own non-profit.” 


Another media account of the transaction states that “Richard Warshauer, senior managing director of 
Colliers International, who helped OSI broker the deal, said the Research Institute is part of SouFun 
Holdings Inc., a large China-based real estate company.”  There is certainly corroborating evidence to 
support this narrative that the Company formed RCNC to purchase the gilded age mansion with Company 
money. 


Property Registered to SouFun’s US Headquarters


Most notably, the deed to the Arden House, a copy of which is included on the next page, states that the 
registered address of the property’s owner is none other than the 16th floor of the AIG building at 
72 Wall Street, the building that SouFun purchased in 2011.

Below is a screen shot from a property report, available on a website administered by the county of 
Orange in New York (click here), in which the Arden House is located.  The property report, like the 
deed, clearly states that the owner of Arden House is located at SouFun’s New York headquarters
and not the registered address of RCNC (which, according to public records available by searching here is 
260 Middle Neck Road in Great Neck, NY).

The above property report, like the deed, clearly states that the registered owner of the Arden House 
abides at SouFun’s New York headquarters and not the registered address of the charity. 


SouFun Employee Administers the Property


Multiple data points show that Company resources are used in the operation and administration of the 
property.  First, the contact email on the Arden House website is the Company email address for 
SouFun’s employee and authorized representative in the United States, Yukui Hou: 
houyukui@soufun.com. 


Company filings (excerpted below) list Yukui Hou as SouFun’s authorized representative in the United
States and lists him as holding power of attorney for the Company’s US subsidiary, Best Work Holdings 
(New York) LLC.  Note that the SouFun employee lists his Company email address on the Arden House 
website.

Our investigator visited the property.  At the house, our investigator encountered SouFun employee 
Yukui Hou, the same person who is listed on the contact page of the property website.  Yukui Hou gave 
our investigator his SouFun email address.  


Where is the Charity?


The Arden House is listed on the national register of historic landmarks and a deed restriction limited the 
sale of the property to a not-for-profit organization.  Yet records indicate that RCNC has not been granted 
tax-exempt status by the IRS, it was set up immediately before the purchase of the Arden House and we 
found no evidence of any bona fide charitable (or other) operations.


The IRS database of tax exempt organizations, which permits potential donors to verify whether a 
purported charity has been granted tax-exempt status, does not list RCNC on any of the following lists: 


1. Organizations eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions (Pub. 78 data).
2. Organizations whose federal tax exemption was automatically revoked for not filing a Form 990-


series return or notice for three consecutive years.
3. Form 990-N (e-Postcard) filers and filings.


The IRS makes its list of tax-exempt organizations available to the public, so that taxpayers may “rely on 
this list in determining deductibility of contributions.”  The database is updated monthly, so if RCNC, 
which was formed in September 2011, was eligible to receive tax-exempt donations, it should appear on 
the list.1  


Moreover, we could find no evidence that RCNC is an operating charity.   It has no website (which we 
could find) and no records exist online (to our knowledge) of any charitable work, conferences, seminars 
or other activities.  


RCNC’s Articles of Incorporation state that the purpose of the non-profit is to:


“create, form and establish an organization to research innovative natural conservation 
methods; to hold, conduct and organize meetings, discussions and forums to consider 
community opinion or contemporary issues pertaining to the preservation of the environment … 
[and] to study the effects of global warming on the environment in the future.”


We can find no evidence that RCNC has conducted, since inception, any of the activities mandated by its 
charter.  We expect serious repercussions and public outcry if (as it appears) the Chairman established a 
sham charity to circumvent a conservation easement protecting the land, the house and its surrounding 
trees.  


Off-Balance Sheet Purchase? 


We believe that the evidence supports a simple narrative: sellers approached SouFun to buy the Arden 
House, so management set up a cosmetic charity to purchase the property, which is registered to SouFun’s 
NY offices and administered by the Company’s US employee through his Company email address.  To 
boot, the charity appears to be a façade as it does not appear to be currently eligible to receive tax-exempt 
donations.  Nor is there any evidence of bona fide charitable operations.

The application for tax-exempt status may be delayed pending approval by the IRS.  RCNC may also still be 


preparing to file for tax-exempt status.

If Company funds were used to purchase and operate the Arden House, the $6.5 million purchase should 
appear on the Company’s books in Q4 of 2011.  SouFun’s balance sheet reflects prior purchases such as 
the AIG and Hainan purchases (both discussed below).  Yet looking at changes in PP&E in the 20-F 
filings for 2011 and 2012, there does not to appear to be any room to account for the $6.5 million cash 
purchase of a house.  This would imply that if SouFun funds were used to purchase the Arden House, the 
asset is being kept off the books. 


But even if SouFun can prove that RCNC purchased the Arden House with charitable donations from 
wealthy individuals (and no Company funds were misappropriated to buy the mansion), there is ample 
evidence to support the notion that Company resources are being used to operate the property, despite the 
fact that the Arden House is privately owned and controlled by the Chairman and his wife.  This is a clear 
violation of Chairman Mo’s fiduciary duties.  


Marie Antoinette.


The French revolution was not kind to Marie Antoinette.  If Jing Cao and her husband used Company 
resources for their own personal benefit to operate (and potentially purchase) the Arden House, she will
avoid the guillotine but may face punishment from the IRS, the SEC, the DOJ and the State of New York.

II. No Training at 72 Wall Street?


In 2011, the Company purchased another New York landmark, the AIG building at 72 Wall Street, for 
$60.7 million.  According to the Company, it bought the building to serve as a training facility.  Yet 
almost two years after the purchase, the building appears dilapidated and empty, and according to on-site 
interviews, is barely in use.


Missing Charitable Donations


In conjunction with the purchase of the property, the Chairman established a New York based not-for-
profit, Wall Street Global Training Center (“WSGTC”), to run high-priced training courses at 72 Wall St. 
for Company employees visiting from China.2  


Publicly available IRS records suggest that either Chairman Mo made false statements to the IRS about 
funds received by WSGTC or that the Company made false statements in its SEC filings about the 
amount donated to WSGTC by SouFun.  Chairman Mo can pick his poison: the IRS or SEC, but we 
believe that either he or the Company made false statements to a government agency.


SouFun’s 2011 Annual Report states that: 


Wall Street Global Training Center, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation, provided 
training services to us in 2011. Mr. Mo, Shan Li and Quan Zhou are directors of Wall Street 
Global Training Center, Inc ... In 2011, we paid Wall Street Global Training Center, Inc. 
training service fees of approximately US$0.5 million. In addition, we also prepaid service 


fees of US$1.6 million for future services.


Even though SouFun claims to have paid over $2 million to WSGTC in 2011, the following IRS record, 
which any investor or regulator can access through the IRS website, states unequivocally that WSGTC 
received less than $50,000 in 2011.

Chairman Mo formed WSGTC in May 2011, according to the NY Division of Corporations.

16





















































www.glaucusresearch.comSOUFUN HOLDINGS LIMITED | NYSE: SFUN


The IRS defines ‘gross receipts’ as “the total amounts the organization received from all sources during 


over $2 million to WSGTC in 2011. Yet Chairman Mo’s charity reported to the IRS that its gross receipts 
were less than $50,000 in 2011.3  


Tax returns are filed with the IRS under penalty of perjury, and tax fraud is a felony punishable by 
incarceration, but Chairman Mo might find such penalties preferable to the consequences if it is shown 
that he is involved in diverting public-Company funds (which were ear marked for charity no less) for 
personal use. 


Empty Chairs at Empty Tables


In an effort to corroborate whether the Company was running a training program at its 72 Wall Street 
offices, as it claims in its filings, we had consultants visit the property on two separate occasions and ask 
for Wall Street Global Training Center by name.  


On both occasions, doormen at 72 Wall St. told such consultants that they had never heard of Wall 
Street Global Training Center and that we must have the wrong address.  The doorman also said that 
he was not aware of any training facility or training center in the building.  


According to the Company’s SEC filings, SouFun prepaid $1.6 million to WSGTC so that at least 300 
employees could attend training sessions (of at least one week in duration) at 72 Wall St. in 2012. Yet 
according to our conversations with a doorman at 72 Wall St., the building was barely in use, he 
had not seen anywhere close to that number of people, and there was no training facility on the 
premises.  The doorman told our consultant that 72 Wall St was in such disrepair (elevators were broken) 
that it could not possibly host a training program.  


We encourage any investor or regulator to visit the building.  The property appears empty and a big ‘AIG’ 
sign still remains prominently displayed over the front desk.  When our consultants visited the site, they 
saw what appeared to be construction materials strewn throughout the lobby. 


We believe that these accounts corroborate WSGTC’s IRS records and indicate that SouFun did not 
donate $2 million to WSGTC to conduct training courses at 72 Wall St.  So where did the money go? 


It is also suspicious that Chairman Mo’s non-profit charges more for a year of training than the annual 
tuition at Harvard University. The contract between SouFun and Chairman Mo’s charity, The SouFun
Overseas Training Agreement, signed December 20, 2011 (available here), states:


                                                       
3


Per the Company’s FY 2012 20-F, the Company booked $1.6 million in payments to WSGTC as expenses in 2012.  


But we know from the Company’s FY 2011 20-F that it prepaid the $1.6 million in FY 2011, meaning that it should 


appear on the charity’s gross receipts in its FY 2011 IRS tax returns.

The training program seems wildly overpriced at $55,000 for one year of tuition.  To put it into context, in 
the table below we have compared the value proposition of a year at Chairman Mo’s Wall Street Global 
Training Center to a year at Harvard University.

The comparison above is simply a thought exercise designed to show investors (and regulators) that 
Chairman Mo’s charity is charging the public Company a significant amount in tuition for training 
employees.  We will leave it up to regulators with full investigative powers to find out, but we 
believe that the evidence points to a simple narrative: the funds were misappropriated by 
Chairman Mo.  


Wasteful or Corrupt?


Ultimately, the purchase of 72 Wall St. is inherently suspicious.  Why does SouFun, which operates 
exclusively in China, need 325,000 square feet of New York’s priciest real estate to train employees who 
live 7,000 miles from the training facility? SEC filings state that SouFun’s US subsidiaries “do not 
conduct any substantive operations of their own.  No provision for United States income tax has been 
made in the financial statements as the subsidiaries in the United States have no assessable income for 
the three years ended December 31, 2012.”  If the Company does not have any meaningful US 
operations, why would it need a training center in the US?


Moreover, if the Company wanted to set up a training center for Chinese employees, why would it need to 
purchase some of the most expensive real estate in the world?  The AIG building at 72 Wall St. is located 
next to the New York headquarters of Deutsche Bank (60 Wall St.) in the heart of downtown Manhattan.

Why does a Company operating almost exclusively in China need 325,000 sq ft 
of Manhattan’s priciest real estate? 


AIG used 72 Wall St. as a training center. AIG at its height was the 29th largest public company in the 
world with 116,000 employees (an estimated half of which were located in the US).  By comparison, 
SouFun has only 7,743 employees, all of which are located in China.  Why would it need the same 
amount of space to train employees as a company with 15 times as many people? 


So why would the Company purchase some of the world’s most expensive real estate and then let the 
building sit idle more than 20 months after its acquisition in July 2011? At best, it looks like a giant 
waste of shareholder capital.  At worst, the training center is simply a fig leaf disguising the fact that 
public funds were used to purchase expensive real estate which is now being used for some other 
nefarious purpose.

III. National Lampoon's Corporate Vacation


At the time of its 2010 IPO, SouFun was a capital-light online business ostensibly generating $200 
million in revenue despite owning less than $10 million in property and equipment.  Since then, the 
Company has accumulated nearly $200 million in high-priced real estate across the globe, supposedly to 
serve as “training” facilities.


In March 2012, the Company bought another ‘training’ facility in an ideal vacation destination.  Six 
months after purchasing 325,000 square feet of ‘training’ space on Wall Street, the Company purchased
44 hotel rooms at the Sanya Bay La Costa Hotel in Hainan (http://www.sanyalacostahotel.com) for 
$13 million.


In its SEC filings, SouFun referred to the hotel rooms with the misleading moniker “commercial 
properties” and told investors that the Company planned to “use properties as our local office in Hainan 
as well as for internal training purposes.”  This transaction is suspicious for several reasons. 


Sanya is a popular vacation destination, known for all-inclusive resorts, tropical weather and packed 
beaches (pictured below).  


Sanya’s Beaches: a Popular (and crowded) Vacation Destination


SouFun purchased 44 rooms at the Sanya Bay La Costa Hotel, which, according to a map of hotels in the 
area from Agoda.com, sits right on the beach on a crowded strip of waterfront resorts (the blue dot in the 
picture).

More importantly the Sanya Bay La Costa Hotel does not look like an ideal spot for a corporate office or 
an internal training center.  Rather, it looks like a nice vacation destination.   A quick Priceline.com
search shows that guests can book a room at the hotel for an average of $105 per night.  The 
accompanying pictures (included below) reveal a typical resort.

www.glaucusresearch.comSOUFUN HOLDINGS LIMITED | NYSE: SFUN


The Sanya Bay La Costa Hotel looks like a nice resort, but does not appear to be an ideal corporate office 
or a facility particularly suited for a ‘training center.’  The purchase price also seems wasteful.  In the 
table below, we calculated the total number of nights the Company could have purchased at the hotel for 
the same price as paying, in advance, to purchase 44 rooms outright. 


For $13 million, the Company could have bought (at current prices) 113,322 nights at the hotel.  To put it 
into perspective, the Company could have booked every one of its 7,700 employees 15 nights at the hotel 
for the same price as purchasing 44 rooms outright.


This transaction appears at best, wasteful, and at worst, devious.  Why would the Company, which just 
spent $61 million on a giant training facility in New York, need more training space away from its 
Beijing headquarters? If the Company wanted to conduct training exercises, why not just book hotel 
rooms instead of prepay for them?  Why are investors, who bought shares in an internet company, 
comfortable with corporate funds being allocated to expensive purchases with seemingly little connection 
to the Company’s mandate of operating a real estate website?


We believe the purchase of the hotel rooms in Sanya Bay fits a familiar pattern: Company resources are 
used to buy expensive real estate in an ideal vacation destination, which SouFun justifies to 
shareholders on the grounds of ‘internal training.’  In our view, it is not unreasonable to conclude that 
Chairman Mo, his wife and his cadre of insiders are simply using shareholder funds to purchase posh 
vacation homes around the world as such properties seem to be irrelevant to the day-to-day operations of 
an internet company operating in China.

IV. Adventures in Accounting


Investors reading the fine print will already know that SouFun has a checkered history of auditor 
resignations and questionable accounting practices detailed in the Company’s F-1.  In 2004, SouFun
retained an accounting firm to audit the Company’s consolidated financials in preparation for an initial 
public offering.  The auditor:


“expressed discomfort with our accounting records and systems during the course of its 
review of our book entries relating to certain advances to our employees.  Our 2004 
accounting firm also noted inconsistencies between the information we provided and our 
accounting records. In December 2004, following discussions with our then-existing audit 
committee, our 2004 accounting firm …resign[ed] as our registered independent public 
accounting firm, citing concerns about the reliability and sufficiency of our financial 
reporting processes, including our internal controls and systems, the financial 
information provided by our management and certain representations of our 
employees.”


The 2004 accounting firm later withdrew its audit opinion on SouFun’s 2001, 2002 and 2003 financial 
statements.  In November 2007, history seemed to repeat itself as another accounting firm withdrew its 
audit opinion after informing the Company that it “initially recorded certain transactions in a manner 
inconsistent with U.S. GAAP.”  The following excerpt is from a Deutsche Bank Analyst Report, October 
27, 2010:


In February 2008, after two false starts, the Company found an accounting firm with which it could do 
business.  It hired Ernst & Young Hua Ming, which investors may recall was recently sued by the SEC 
for allegedly refusing to hand over documents sought in regulatory investigations into accounting fraud at 
Chinese companies.  Hong Kong securities regulators also sued Ernst & Young Hua Ming for failing to 
produce documents relating to another Chinese-based client, Standard Water Limited.

In connection with SouFun’s 2010 financial statements, Ernst & Young Hua Ming identified certain 
salient deficiencies in SouFun’s internal controls over financial reporting, including the “lack of a 
comprehensive computerized system to timely track operating data and integrate with the 
accounting system; and … ineffective information technology, or IT, control environment for accounting 
and key business systems.”


If SouFun were a mining company, perhaps shareholders could excuse the failure to set up an IT system 
to track operating data but SouFun is an internet company – tracking online advertising activity should 
be easy.  We find it odd that a business operating a website appears to have such poor grasp of 
information technology that it failed to set up a system to track data to its auditor’s satisfaction.
  


V. The Company You Keep


The Chairman and his wife hired Derek Palaschuk, the former CFO of Longtop Financial, a notorious 
fraud that wiped out over $1 billion in shareholder value, to serve as the chairman of the audit committee 
of Shun Cheong Holdings (HKEX: 0650), a public company on the Hong Kong exchange in which they 
hold a majority stake. 


Investors might recall that Longtop Financial collapsed spectacularly in 2011 after fellow short blogger 
Citron Research exposed the company.  If investors are judging Chairman Mo (and his wife) by the 
company they keep, it should raise eyebrows that the couple hired the CFO of a notorious Chinese stock 
scam to head the audit committee of their HK-listed entity.  


The Chairman’s strange bedfellows should worry investors, because their ownership interest in SouFun
exists at the pleasure of the Chairman, who directly owns the operating businesses in China.   


VI. Costly and Unsustainable Dividends


The bull case for SouFun centers on the fact that the Company paid three special dividends in 2011 and 
2012 ($273.2 million in aggregate).  In our view, this dividend policy is unsustainable and leads the 
market to vastly understate the Company’s cost of capital.  


  
We believe that the Chairman is saddling the Company with debt in order to extract as much cash from 
the Company as possible. In 2011 and 2012, the Chairman’s aggregate proceeds from the dividends 
exceeded $75 million by our estimate, which was especially valuable to a PRC citizen who cannot 
normally move cash offshore without regulatory scrutiny and a punitive tax.


On two separate conference calls, Chairman Mo admits that the Company is borrowing to pay dividends
in US dollars. 


4Q12 Earnings Call Excerpt


<A>: We had a second loan – we took out a second charge of loans into 2012. So that 
contributed to our interest expense increase. As you know, we're paying dividend, so that 
loan was actually taken out, part of that was for that purpose.


3Q12 Earnings Call


<Q - Alex Yao>: Got it. On two items on the balance sheet, in third quarter this year, I noticed 
that the non-current portion of restricted cash increased by $94 million from Q2 to Q3. And

also, short-term borrowings increased by $81 million from Q2 and Q3. Can you talk about why 
these two accounts increased by close to $90 million during the quarter?


<A - Tianquan Vincent Mo>: It's mainly the – our third quarter dividend. We had a 
dividend $1 per share, so that's the major reason here.


<Q - Alex Yao>: Okay. So, you guys used [內保外貸]4 to finance the dividend payment, right?


Why does a business that generates free cash flow from operations in China need to borrow money from 
offshore banks to pay a dividend? The answer is that it is incredibly arduous (and expensive) to get 
money out of China.  So even though the Company ostensibly generates cash through its PRC-based 
businesses, RMB derived from its onshore business will most likely not be used to pay dividends to 
offshore entities. 


The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) restricts the conversion of RMB to foreign 
currencies with respect to capital account transactions such as cross-border dividend payments and 
repayment of principal of loans.5  Thus any movement of capital from RMB to US dollars to repay USD-
denominated debt or pay a shareholder dividend would have to undergo a lengthy (and costly) approval 
process, and if approved by SAFE (which is not a guaranty) any money moved offshore would be subject 
to significant transfer taxes (15-25%) depending on whether the Chinese government deems the capital 
to be a dividend of earned income or a capital reduction of the operating company.   


So in order to repay the USD-denominated loans that the Company incurred to pay a dividend to 
shareholders, the Company will either have to move money offshore (from RMB to USD), which will 
increase its cost of capital by 15-25%, or it will have to raise money offshore in the future. 


Perhaps in 2008, it would have been possible for a $2 billion market cap Chinese firm to close a high-
yield bond offering or issue a convertible note.  However, in the current credit environment only Chinese 
companies of the size and reputation of Baidu (BIDU), which raised $1.5 billion in a 2012 high-yield 
bond issuance, seem able to tap the offshore debt markets.  We find it highly unlikely that unsecured 
offshore creditors would loan money to SouFun. 


As a result, the most likely means by which SouFun will repay the money it borrowed to pay the 
dividends is to dilute shareholders by issuing equity.  The bulls for SouFun, enamored by the 2011 and 
2012 dividends, do not appreciate that such borrowings will most likely be repaid through future equity 
issuances which will ultimately be dilutive to current shareholders.  


                                                       
4


We translate this phrase to mean a ‘loan secured by RMB pledged to the Chinese branch of the lending bank.’

VII. The Vulnerable VIE


In this report, we have uncovered what we believe to be multiple examples in which SouFun’s Chairman 
Mo has either diverted Company resources for personal use or presided over wasteful spending that is 
ultimately destructive of shareholder value and not germane to SouFun’s core business.  In our view, 
regulators will likely take such claims very seriously, particularly to determine whether Company 
resources were diverted to purchase or operate the Arden House and to determine why Chairman Mo’s 
Wall Street Global Training Center reported less than $50,000 in gross receipts when the Company claims 
it paid the not-for-profit $2 million in 2011.  


China bars foreigners from owning companies operating in sectors such as defense or technology which 
the government deems sensitive.  In order to attract foreign capital, companies such as SouFun have 
adopted a Variable Interest Entity (a “VIE”) structure in which an offshore holding company (owned by 
foreign investors) forms a new subsidiary in China (a “WFOE”) which has a contractual right to the 
economic benefits of the PRC-based operating entity (the VIE).  The VIE is owned by PRC individuals, 
in SouFun’s case, 80% by Chairman Mo and 20% by his nephew, Richard Jiangong Dai.  Chairman Mo 
and his nephew are the authorized signatories for the operating business in China.


The key risk in a VIE structure is that shareholders do not have any ownership interest in the operating 
business – rather they have a call option to transfer control of the operating business to its foreign 
owners in the event of a dispute with the Chairman – a contractual right which may be unenforceable 
given that Chinese law does not permit foreign entities to own PRC-based internet companies.  Even if, in 
a perfect world, such a right was enforceable under Chinese law, shareholders can only enforce it by 
prevailing in a Chinese court against rich and powerful Chinese citizens who own the operating 
business – which seems highly unlikely.  


SouFun’s VIE structure therefore demands that shareholders have full faith in the integrity of the 
Chairman because it is he, ultimately, who controls the assets and the business.   We are not aware of any 
foreign shareholder successfully exercising such an option to take control over an operating PRC 
business. By comparison, the capital markets are littered with cautionary tales of investors burned by 
unethical leadership in China: after management is caught breaking rules, they simply abscond with the 
operating business, leaving US investors with few viable remedies.  Investors must therefore trust 
leadership completely, or else.  


Just Ask Yahoo


Jack Ma, the controversial mogul, came under heavy scrutiny in 2011 for spinning out his online payment 
business Alipay from Alibaba (in which Yahoo and other foreign owners held a significant stake).  
Alibaba was set up as a VIE structure, with Alipay as a Chinese subsidiary over which Jack Ma had 
control.  Shareholders in Alibaba, such as Yahoo, owned a contractual right (or so they thought) to the 
economic benefits of the operating company, which included Alipay. 


In 2011, Yahoo was informed that Ma terminated the VIE arrangements in his capacity as authorized 
signatory for each of the Alipay WFOE and the Alipay VIE (a similar structure exists at SouFun), stating 
that he had no choice but to do so as Chinese regulators would not grant Alipay the required third-party 
payment service license if it remained foreign-controlled.  Ma then transferred Alipay to a domestic entity 
he controlled.

28





















































www.glaucusresearch.comSOUFUN HOLDINGS LIMITED | NYSE: SFUN


Yahoo was utterly blindsided and alleged that Ma acted without its consent, insinuating that he simply 
stole Alipay out from under shareholders.  Alipay was considered the crown jewel of the Alibaba empire, 
and Yahoo stock price duly plunged upon revelation of the news. 


Although the parties eventually reached an arrangement which capped the amount of money that Yahoo 
could make on an Alipay IPO, the takeaway for US investors is that shareholders of a VIE entity must 
have complete faith and trust in the leaders who own the operating business.  


In order to recover any assets located inside China, shareholders would have to win a court case in the 
PRC against a connected and wealthy PRC citizen.  Chinese courts are notoriously corrupt, arbitrary and 
protective of local businesses and industry. Notions of judicial independence do not apply. As a result, for 
foreign investors such as SouFun’s shareholders, we suspect that litigating against a powerful local 
Chinese businessman in a Chinese court would be a Sisyphean task. Further hindering any prospect of 
recovery are any relationships that Chairman Mo may have with the local government or state owned
enterprises, which would only magnify their influence over the judicial system.


Comedy of Errors


In December 2011, Glaucus issued a research report showing that China Medical Technologies (formerly 
a NASDAQ listed Chinese company) had defrauded investors. In response, CMED’s management team 
appears to have taken the money and ran. Almost immediately after the release of our report, CMED 
defaulted on a $5 million coupon payment for its corporate bonds (even though CMED claimed, at the 
time, to have US$ 206 million in cash in its accounts). Note holders were initially stunned and tried in 
vain to contact the company. Finally, in late June 2012, almost 6 months after CMED’s management team 
went dark, bondholders kicked off the asset recovery process by filing for bankruptcy in the Caymans. 
While creditors played by the rules, CMED’s inside ownership was busy rigging the game. 


According to a complaint filed in California by GLG Partners and other bondholders, CMED’s founder 
and chairman misappropriated the equity of the PRC operating companies out from under the foreign 
holdco companies to entities controlled by himself within the PRC before creditors could even begin the 
process to recover assets. While CMED’s foreign creditors were busy jumping through the proper hoops 
to seize assets in the PRC, it appears that CMED’s management simply stole the assets. We currently do 
not know how CMED’s story ends, but its creditors are not sanguine about a recovery.


A Visit from the Goon Squad


Chinacast Education (Nasdaq: CAST), structured as a VIE entity, presents another cautionary tale for 
SouFun shareholders.  CAST’s underlying assets and large cash balance were real (by most accounts), the 
company had a U.S. Deloitte partner overseeing the audit, as well as senior managers that maintained 
residences in the U.S.  The Chairman, Ron Chan, was eventually exposed by Kerrisdale Capital for using 
front men to disguise the destination of the Company's acquisition proceeds.  


The stock price plunged.  As soon as the Chairman, Ron Chan, decided he was better off without U.S. 
shareholders, accounts suggest he simply stole the company from under their noses.  A team allegedly
invaded CAST's PRC offices to steal computer hard drives, making a proper investigation impossible, as 
well as the company chops.  These chops, which control all banking activity and take months to replace, 
were meanwhile used by the Chairman to transfer the cash and university assets to private holding 
companies.  Because of the VIE structure, all the high priced attorneys in New York could not prevent the 
share price from losing 99% of its value after the Chairman, who owned and controlled the operating 
business in China, apparently absconded with the company.

CMED and CAST are cautionary tales, which highlight the material risk faced by SouFun shareholders in 
the event, as we believe is likely, a conflict arises between Chairman Mo and SouFun’s shareholders.  We 
have shown evidence, which in our view strongly suggests that Chairman Mo violated his fiduciary duties 
to shareholders and that Company resources are either being wasted or misappropriated for the personal 
benefit of the Chairman and his wife.  The VIE structure relies on an honest and trustworthy management 
team for shares to hold any value.  How could shareholders trust the same people to honor a pledge to 
cede control over the Company to overseas investors, when it would be easier (and more profitable) for 
them to walk away with the assets?
