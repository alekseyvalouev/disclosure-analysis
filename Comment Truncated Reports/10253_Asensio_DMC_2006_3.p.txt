When did DMC acquire the


Wicker Patents?


Prior to changing its name to Document Security Systems


(AMEX: DMC, $10.11) in February of 2003, the company


formerly known as New Sky Communications began a series


of acquisitions. Through the purchase of Lester Levin


Printing d/b/a Patrick White Printing, Document Security


Consultants, and Thomas M. Wicker Enterprises


(“Acquisitions”), DMC made the unlikely transformation from


a failed producer of campy B-List �lms to an anti-


counterfeiting document technology company.


The foundation for this newest venture was the collection of


patents acquired through the Acquisitions. Unfortunately, it


is unclear what DMC actually owns or controls. DMC has


changed the language characterizing its patents used in its


SEC �lings several times.


DMC paid $72,000 in cash, assumed $324,921 in debt and


issued 1,875,000 shares of stock valued at $262,500 in total


for the acquisition of all three companies. During the time of


the acquisitions DMC claimed to receive the ownership of


the Wicker Patents. Shortly after the acquisitions however


they seemed to change their tune as to what was received in


the acquisitions. So what interest in the Wicker Patents did


DMC receive during the acquisition of the three companies?

According to a 10-K �led on March 26, 2003 for the year


ended December 31, 2002, DMC acquired “Patents: USA


Patent #5,735,547, #5,707,083, Canadian Patent #2,045,580,


European Patent #0455750 U.S.A. and Trade Secrets.” Eight


months later that language was materially changed. An


amended 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2002 �led


on November 13, 2003 describes the technology acquired


during the acquisitions as “Nonexclusive Patent Interests:


USA Patent #5,735,547, #5,707,083, Canadian Patent


#2,045,580, European Patent #0455750 U.S.A. and Trade


Secrets.”


Buried at the end of the 10-K is a Schedule which describes


the technology gained in the transaction and states “Sub-


license of the license for USA Patent #5,707,083 Wicker 2000


Trade Secrets including plates and Films at Tucker Printers


subject to the terms of the license agreement with the estate


of Ralph Wicker.” The Schedule goes on to state that also


included in the transaction was the “license agreement for


USA Patent #5,454,598 Perf Product and Process, including


the right to sub-license.”


The answer as to what technology DMC acquired through


the acquisitions becomes further muddled when a


transaction is completed on February 25, 2005 to


consolidate the ownership of the Wicker Patents into DMC.


According to an 8-K �led on March 02, 2005, a total of


583,106 shares of stock valued at $7.25 a share were issued


to 42 individuals for the “purchase of various legal


ownership and economic interests in certain technology


(patents and trade secrets) from 42 persons and entities


(referred to as “Interest Holders”) who had purchased these


interests in the technology from the original inventors of the


technology, Ralph C. Wicker (deceased) and members of his


family the Wicker family.”


The schedule of Patents outlined by the Form 8-K lists the


Patents acquired as all of the same patents previously

mentioned with the exception of the patent ending in 598.


Also included in the list of acquired Patents is the 5,018,767


Patent (“767”) which had claims invalidated by the United


States Court of Appeals on March 13, 2000 and which was


allowed to lapse due to DMC not paying maintenance fees,


from May 2003 to March 2004.


An expired Australian Patent is also included in the list of


acquired Patents, as is a withdrawn Patent, and a Japanese


Patent whose registration status is listed as “unknown.” Of


the twenty patents listed on the schedule of acquired


patents one has claims which have been invalidated, one


withdrawn, one expired, one’s registration status is


“unknown,” and three other patents (those ending in 580,


083, and 547) were mentioned as being included in the


original Acquisition.


The remaining thirteen patents listed in the schedule are in


reality, one Patent registered in thirteen di�erent countries.


The European Patent 0455750 (“750”) is listed on the


schedule in all thirteen countries that it is currently


registered in. The 750 Patent is currently the subject of


litigation with claims of invalidity �led in 8 of the 13 countries


it is �led in, with the �ling of another claim of invalidity


imminent. According to the 8-K there were also


“approximately 5” entities that did not come to an


agreement with DMC who still have rights to the technology.


Perhaps the question that should be asked is not what was


acquired when, but if valuable technology was ever acquired.


Given the invalidation of previous patents, the current


counterclaims moving to invalidate nine more DMC patents,


and the lack of revenue from the licensing of DMC’s other


patents, it looks like DMC shareholders emerged from the


February 25, 2005 transaction with what they went in with:


nothing to show for their investment then, nothing to show


for their investment now.
