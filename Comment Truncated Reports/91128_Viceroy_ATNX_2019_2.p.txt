Athenex – Where there’s smoke…  
Athenex ’s revenue generating business is a house of cards, muddled 


with further ties to large scale frauds, fabricated management 


credentials, and photoshopped offices .  


October 23, 2019 – This follow up report focuses specifically on Athenex’s Polymed 


subsidiary, which accounts for a large portion of Athenex’s revenues and capital 


expenditure: 


▪ Our investigations have found ties between Polymed and its management 


team’s ties to the largest taxol smuggling ring in history Hande Yunnan, 


resulting in 50 arrests and 32 imprisonments. Major perpetrators and 


shareholders of this scheme now work for Athenex.   


▪ Polymed appears to continue sourcing its taxol from Hande Yunnan, despite 


the fact that our investigations show Hande Yunnan no longer produce taxol. 


▪ Further inspection of Polymed’s management show inconsistencies in prior 


executive roles, specifically of William Zuo. Zuo was also the US liaison of 


bringing smuggled taxol to the USA. 


▪ A deep dive into Chinese regulatory notes from the Ministry of Emergency 


Management, coupled with Polymed’s history of objectionable site inspections by Chinese regulators and 


the FDA, lead us to believe that Polymed’s manufacturing facility suspension was anything but voluntary. 


In any event, Athenex’s manufacturing facility does not manufacture anything. 


▪ Viceroy dismantles photoshopped Polymed advertisements for its facilities and expose chemical 


manufacturing facilities we believe are non-existent or outsourced. 


Viceroy remains short Athenex with high conviction. The quantum of red flags uncovered within the business 


and management team surpass any other company we have previously analyzed purely within data sourced 


from the public domain. 


We reiterate our target price of $2.83, now representing a 75% downside, and will continue to keep investors 


informed through further reporting. 


We conclude that Athenex exists to abuse capital markets and enrich its management through related party 


transactions and licensing deals, rather than bring revolutionary drugs into the market. This activity is 


masqueraded through overpromise in both its flagship drug, Oraxol, and its purported “supply-chain” 


businesses, such as Polymed. 


Athenex is a perfect storm of investor deception, insider enrichment and clinical trial risks. 


Investors should demand a full investigation of the issues discussed within this report: we 


are confident there is more to this story given how much was available purely through the 


public domain. 


Athenex’s operational and R&D cash-burn rate is over US$100m a year – the company would be lucky to survive 


until HY 2020 without needing a further cash injection from investors. Even if Athenex scrapped its R&D 


completely, the company’s revenue streams operate at a substantial loss. 


Accordingly, we believe our valuation of $2.83 is optimistic, and will be realized in the short term. We do not 


see a future for the company in its current state. Viceroy’s preliminary report on Athenex can be found in the

1. Polymed & Yunnan Hande  


This one is something of a rabbit hole. 


Athenex subsidiary Polymed therapeutics appears to source its Taxol and other raw API from Hande Yunnan 


Biotechnology Co.  


Hande Yunnan Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Was previously the second largest taxol supplier in the world, until the 


company was raided by Chinese authorities for illegally harvesting yew bark (the source of taxol), resulting in 50 


arrests and 32 imprisonments, and setting a precedent against illegal harvesting which has resulted in hundreds 


of arrests since1. 


Polymed founder William Wei Zuo was the director of a US Yunnan Hande subsidiary as far back as 1995 implying 


his involvement in the smuggling and illegal sale of Taxol – in fact, Hande’s US distributor and Polymed even 


shared the same offices.  


Wu Xiaojing, the American investor in Hande Yunnan and sister of its imprisoned Chairman at the time of its 


impropriety, continues to run alongside Zuo for Hande’s USA distributor, which now appears to operate as a 


subsidiary of Polymed. Her Facebook shows she is indeed an employee of Athenex.  


More recent documents show Hande Yunnan continues to supply Athenex’s taxol. 


On the ground checks at Yunnan Hande’s one remaining operating subsidiary show no evidence of taxol 


processing. This subsidiary, which used to harvest yew illegally, now owns a tent that dries tea leaves. 


So where exactly does Hande, and therefore Polymed, get its raw material? 


Yunnan Hande: corruption, smuggling, illegal sales 


Taxol is the primary ingredient in the manufacture of paclitaxel and is distilled from the bark of the pacific yew. 


Removing the bark from the Yew tree causes it to die: 360,000 mature trees per year would be required for 


production of taxol as calculated by NCI’s Gordon Crag2. As such the excessive harvesting and smuggling of yew 


bark is illegal in many countries, China included. 


Yunnan Hande was one of China’s first and largest taxol suppliers and a joint venture 80% owned by Chinese 


American Wu Xiaojing until it was charged with: 


▪ Illegally obtaining 55,519.12kg of yew bark extract and 10,765.475g of semi-finished product 


(chloroform) 


▪ Fraudulently obtaining export licenses 


▪ Fraudulently mis-labelling goods. 


▪ Evading customs checks and inspections 


▪ Illegally sold ~100kg of paclitaxel although the eventual buyers were not identified in the media. 


Among the 32 arrests, Chairman Wu Jun was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and a 2m yuan fine, President 


Li Song was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment and vice president Qi Wei was sentenced to 7 years prison. The 


period for these offences was between September 10, 1999 and November 2001, which will be important when 


showing the complicity of Zuo with this scheme. 


We believe William Zuo, Athenex’s President of China Operations was implicitly involved with this entity and 


that Zuo facilitated and may continue to facilitate this scheme.

Polymed’s connection to Hande Yunnan 


The 2015 acquisition of Polymed Therapeutics secured Athenex supply of Taxol which it uses in its API 


operations. The importance of Taxol is highlighted in sell side reports and the raw materials disclosure in 


Athenex’s own 10K. Polymed represented about US$20m of the company’s ~US$90m current revenues in 2018.  


 
Figure 1 Athenex 10K - 2018 


Polymed itself does not appear to own any taxol production facilities but instead procure them from a third 


party: Yunnan Hande.  


William Zuo: A “Hande” guy to know 


On July 31, 1995 William Zuo registered Hande Develop Co. USA Inc in Texas which owned and operated 


www.handetech.com (now defunct). 


 
Figure 2 Texas Taxable Entity Search – Taxpayer number 17604765481 


Hande’s third party distributor in the US was Hande Tech Development Corp USA and shared the same address 


as Polymed until Polymed acquired the company in 2004, all the while Zuo was listed as the agent for each 


company.  


 



http://www.handetech.com/
Viceroy Research Group 5 viceroyresearch.org 


The first archived copy of the www.handetech.com site dates to 1997, and touts Yunnan Hande as the key 


paclitaxel producer in China. There is also a profile for Hande Tech Development Co. USA, Inc, the owner and 


operator of the website. 





 
Figures 3 & 4 handetech.com archive dated December 21, 19973 


However the May 18, 2004 archive4 of www.handetech.com redirects to www.polymedt.com. The last link 


without a redirect is dated April 5, 20045. Comparing with the timeline of the events at Hande Yunnan we can 


see that this covers the period of Hande Yunnan’s illicit activities. 


There is more evidence of complicity between Polymed:  Hande Yunnan’s imprisoned Chairman’s sister, Wu 


XiaoJing, who was a major enough investor in Yunnan Hande to bear a mention in the media.

We also have to applaud Ms. Wu Li for concealing her involvement with Hande Tech by misspelling it in her bio

Zuo. More information on Inovachem can be found in our previous report.

We understand Hande Yunnan Biotechnology Co. Ltd (云南汉德生物技术有限公司) has remained Polymed’s 


supplier and business partner. Patent application CN102336726A filed September 30, 2011 by Polymed 


subsidiary Chongqing Taihao Pharmaceutical shows the company purchased taxol from Yunnan Hande.

Of Hande’s 5 subsidiaries, 4 have been deregistered with one former taxol collection company still operating as 


a tea company, and has changed its name accordingly. The company’s profile on TianYanCha.com shows part of 


its mandate was the growing of yew trees8. 





Figure 10 


Viceroy’s investigators found more complications on the ground in China. The following observations were made 


in Q1-Q2 2019. Investigators visited Hande’s remaining operation Jinghang Yikan Tea Co., Ltd (景洪市怡康茶业


有限公司) 


Yikan Tea turned out, predictably, to be drying tea.  


 
Figures 11 & 12 Photos at Yikang tea industries 


The investigator questioned locals who confirmed that there were no yew trees at the facility although villagers 


remember yew production many years ago.  


Investigators also visited Polymed’s Chongqing API factory. Note that this visit was prior to the voluntary 


temporary suspension of operations announced in Athenex’s 2019 Q2 10-Q (more on this later).

According to observations, only finished/semi-finished products entered the facility. 


These facts once again raise the question: where does Hande – and therefore Polymed – 


get their taxol from? 


It is of further concern that Hande Yunnan have been slapped by the FDA for multiple objectionable offences in 


routine inspections of their facility, and lack of corrective action, as determined by the FDA.

2. Factory shutdown 


In May 2019, Athenex advised that its Polymed facility in Chongqing was voluntarily suspended: 


 
Figure 16 Athenex 2019 Q2 10-Q 


This statement released by Athenex is totally contradictory to its voluntary suspension: why would a resolution 


need to be had with the Department of Emergency Management of Chongqing if the suspension was voluntary? 


A search of the Chinese Government’s Ministry of Emergency Management conversely showed that required 


local province investigators were advised to heavily scrutinize these types of plants upon back-to-back 


catastrophic disasters at two unrelated biochemical API factories, resulting in almost 100 deaths and hundreds 


of injuries. 


 
Figure 17 – Extract from in-pjarmatechnologist article12 


We understand guidelines for investigations were established around April 2019, per the following link which 


can be translated directly from the Ministry of Emergency Management:

Viceroy Research Group 10 viceroyresearch.org 


http://120.52.31.79:7040/ezweb/ctrl/news/D1BE086F5A667038644C0C910329AF2D 


Specifically, more recent communications from the Ministry of Emergency Management advised that the 


crackdown should not only be focused on the safety aspects, but also illegality of operations, following further 


accidents and biological plants: 


http://120.52.31.79:7040/ezweb/ctrl/news/6EBBB0F1EE61094101EC8322EF96CD25 


Most telling, however, is Polymed’s atrocious track record of safety inspections in the past. For instance, a 2017 


review of Chongqing Pharmaceutical Co’s occupational disease hazard assessment report by the Chongqing 


Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute concludes that the risk of occupational disease hazards 


at the site are classified as “serious”: 


 
Figure 18 Extract - Chongqing Pharmaceutical Co’s occupational disease hazard assessment report13 


Reviews by the FDA also reported objectionable conditions/practices were found during inspections, similar to 


Hande, who we maintain is a supplier of Polymed: 


 
Figures 19 & 20 – FDA Assessments of Chongqing facility14 & Classification Guide15 


Given its track record, we are cynical that Polymed’s voluntary suspension was voluntary 


at all, and believe the company will face heavily scrutiny both for its current and past 


failures in corporate governance and health and safety.

All else excluded, we have put together a comparison on what Athenex would like you to believe they run, versus 


the actual state of operations within Polymed. 


Here is Polymed’s website: 


http://polymedt.com 


As you will see, the company boasts headquarters in Houston, manufacturing plant in China, and offices in Japan. 


China 


The company’s manufacturing location is listed in Changshou National Chemical Industry Zone, with “communal 


facilities”. The depiction of the factory, however, is completely fabricated: 


 
Figure 21 – Extract from Polymed website16 


This is hard to spot unless you blow up the image, in which Athenex have blatantly photoshopped their name 


to a building, photoshopped a garden and bushes out front, and photoshopped an American flag on a pole 


outside. Further, it is laughable that this “communal facility” is entirely “branded” as Polymed Therapeutics.

http://polymedt.com/

http://polymedt.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=61
Viceroy Research Group 12 viceroyresearch.org 


Inspecting a bird’s eye view of the surrounding area of the site, nothing appears to resemble the photoshopped 


facility: 


 
Figure 22 – Google Maps view of Polymed Japan Site17

The Houston Headquarters of Polymed, depicted below, are not actually the headquarters of Polymed:

Viceroy Research Group 13 viceroyresearch.org 


A simple reverse image search of this location identifies it as 3050 Post Oak Boulevard19, a much, much nicer 


office than Polymed’s actual headquarters, 4 miles away, at 6200 Savoy Drive, Houston. 


  
Figure 24 – Google Maps Streetview of Polymed Japan Site20 


Japan 


In a laughable over exaggeration, Polymed shows depicts the Nagayo Bridge21 over the Tokyo skyline as its frame 


for their Japanese “IT Chemical Specialist” site, which allegedly custom manufactures pharmaceutical and 


specialty chemicals.

4. Fibrocell & Zuo – The man who wasn’t there  


It’s a lot easier to say you did something than to actually do it. William Zuo’s Athenex bio says he was the CEO 


of the Chinese operation for Fibrocell (NASDAQ:FCSC) from 2010 to 2013 and introduced the LaViv cell therapy 


product to the market. This is a mixture of untruths and outright lies. 


 
Figure 27 William Zuo, PhD24 


There is no mention of Zuo in any of Fibrocell’s SEC filings for the period except for his sale of shares in the 


company’s prospectus25 in which he is not mentioned as an employee. The Asia section is a little stranger. 


On November 3, 2010 Fibrocell announced the establishment of a joint venture with Hefei Meifu Bio-Tech 


Limited Co. for development and marketing of its products in Asia. This was the first mention of Asia in the 


company’s announcements. Coincidentally, Hefei Meifu Bio-Tech manufactures and distributes APIs including 


paclitaxel and docetaxel.

No website, Chinese name or other identifying information was ever given for Hefei Meifu Bio-Tech. The 


company had no other information available on the internet both at the time and now. Hefei Meifu Bio-Tech 


appears to disappear except for Fibrocell’s 2014 10-K and 2014 Q1 10-Q where it stated:

“In April 2010, we entered into a letter of intent with Chinese company Heifei Meifu Bio-Tech Limited Co. to 


form a joint venture… to date we and Heifei Meifu have not received Chinese governmental approval to form 


the proposed joint venture…”27

It appears as though Zuo oversaw absolutely nothing at Fibrocell, and we are unsure whether he was ever there 


at all. Crediting him with introducing LaViv to the Asian market appears to be an outright lie considering the 


company had no Asian operations during that time. 


As a side -note Fibrocell shares are now virtually worthless, having been at the center of a stock manipulation 


scheme during the time Zuo was “employed”28.  


What was Zuo doing from 2010 to 2013? 


Are investors aware of the falsehoods in William Zuo’s biography?
