Summary: Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE)
We believe that Bloom Energy, once touted as the prospective “holy grail” of clean energy,
is instead likely to wind up in the history books alongside failed companies like Theranos
or Solyndra.
Contrary to myths about Bloom, our research indicates that Bloom’s technology is not
sustainable, clean, green, or remotely pro�table.
We uncovered an estimated $2.2 billion in undisclosed servicing liabilities that the market
has missed, even in its most recent re-valuation of Bloom shares. These issues have
already begun to surface and we expect they will accelerate.
Bloom’s tricky accounting allows it to mask servicing costs and shift write-downs to other
periods, thereby avoiding recognizing major recent additional losses.
We believe that large debt maturities in 2020 and 2021, amounting to nearly $520 million,
make Bloom Energy an obvious bankruptcy candidate.
The company’s “clean” narrative is absurd: our research shows that Bloom Energy servers
emit signi�cantly more CO2 than the electric grid in key states where it operates. Its
emissions are comparable to those of modern natural gas power plants.
Court documents reveal that Bloom self-identi�ed as a “large quantity generator of
hazardous waste,” to the EPA. Bloom was even sued in 2016 over alleged deceptive trade
practices relating to the dumping of its hazardous waste in California land�lls.
Bloom has collected over $1.1 billion in federal, state, and local subsidies. Many of these
subsidies are being withdrawn or stepped down as jurisdictions wise up to the reality of

Bloom’s products.
A former Bloom employee and a fuel cell expert told us, respectively, that Bloom
“probably wouldn’t exist today” without subsidies and that Bloom “hurts the fuel cell
industry overall”.
Bloom executives have a history of making allegedly false statements, including ones it
was forced to retract in SEC �lings. In another case, Bloom paid $16.7 million to settle
allegations that it lied to its brokers.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of Bloom. This

Part I: Bloom’s Fantasy Origins


The market appears to be slowly waking up to the same unfortunate conclusion about Bloom
Energy that we have arrived at after several months of rigorous deep dive research. Instead of
being a great clean energy success, we expect Bloom’s “too good to be true” story will �nd its
place in history along the likes of defunct companies such as Solyndra and Theranos.


Bloom is a technology company that develops and manufactures stationary fuel cell systems.
Bloom’s systems, called “Bloom Boxes”, are essentially generators that businesses can use to
create on-site energy using solid oxide fuel cells, a technology that has been around for almost
a hundred years (https://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/so/sofcmain.htm).


The boxes take an input, usually natural gas, and convert it into usable electricity.

Fuel cells, in general, have been understood by the scienti�c community since the early 1800’s
(https://www.fuelcellstore.com/blog-section/history-of-fuel-cells) and have been a largely
unpro�table industry to date. Much of Bloom’s popularity (and funding) was based on the idea
that it could “break through” as the �rst pro�table and sustainable fuel cell company, they had
a solid business idea that would be able to provide Business Utilities
(https://www.utilitybidder.co.uk/compare-business-energy/) at a fraction of the price the
business was originally paying for their utilities.


The company was founded in 2001 (https://www.bloomenergy.com/company) by KR Sridhar, a
well-credentialed scientist who developed fuel cell technology at NASA before launching Bloom,
quickly gaining the support of brand-name venture capitalists, such as Kleiner Perkins.


By early 2008, a Department of Energy report (https://www.netl.doe.gov/sites/default/�les/netl-
�le/ASME-FY08-Fuel-Cell-Peer-Review-Report_Final.pdf) [1
(https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/992417)] ranking solid oxide fuel cell projects by
e�ectiveness placed Bloom’s dead last by a wide margin:


(Source: Department of Energy (https://www.netl.doe.gov/sites/default/�les/netl-
�le/ASME-FY08-Fuel-Cell-Peer-Review-Report_Final.pdf))


Nonetheless, later that year, the company booked a high-pro�le Kleiner Perkins alumni
(https://www.kleinerperkins.com/partnerships/) as its �rst customer: Google
(https://www.bloomenergy.com/google). The search behemoth installed a 400 kW Bloom
system at its main campus that year (and doesn’t appear to have expanded its relationship with
Bloom since).

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 4/66


Bloom’s big unveiling to the public took place in 2010 on national television. Upon its release,
Bloom was heralded as a scienti�c breakthrough (https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=RlzVAa7yT2o) by a litany of the nation’s top non-scientists. Senator Dianne Feinstein declared
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufU_-TqQ6PU) of Bloom:


“This technology is fundamentally going to change the world.”


Other notable non-scientists, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Secretary of State
George Schultz (of Theranos infamy), and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who is a
current Bloom board member, voiced their full-throated support for the company.


That same year, 60 Minutes ran a pu� piece on Bloom, introducing the program
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiozxOfCcr4) by saying “in a world of energy, the holy
grail is a power source that’s inexpensive and clean, with no emissions.”


With the wind at its back, Bloom rolled out its product to a “Who’s Who” of Fortune 100
companies, including AT&T and Home Depot, regularly guaranteeing them long-term attractive
energy prices with agreements that lasted up to 25 years. These agreements placed the risk of
the company’s fuel cell performance squarely on Bloom and its shareholders. Many customers,
seeing the attractive guarantees, took the deals and held up their Bloom Boxes as evidence of
a commitment to green, clean, and sustainable energy.


It was a storied beginning to a company that was slated to revolutionize global energy and
change the world as we know it.


But nearly a decade later, the company has been unable to ful�ll its ambitions of being
pro�table and the realities of our research have led us to one conclusion: We expect Bloom
Energy will become yet another tombstone in the Silicon Valley cemetery of dead unicorns.


Bloom’s Operational Reality: An Emissions-Spewing,
Hazardous Waste-Creating, Uneconomical Product That is
Failing in The Real World


Let’s start o� our series of inconvenient truths by making one thing clear: Bloom has never
been a “green” energy company.

While being capable of running on biogas
(https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/land�ll-gas-and-biogas.php) (a form of genuine
green energy), 91% of the company’s fuel cell products run on natural gas (a non-renewable
fossil fuel). [Pg. 5
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm)
]


Bloom is also not a “clean” energy company. Instead of reducing emissions, data we
collected from hundreds of Bloom projects shows that they generate more CO2 than the
electric grid in key states they operate in and produce CO2 levels comparable to modern
natural gas power plants.


Bloom’s generators also result in the creation of carcinogenic hazardous waste, which the
company has allegedly improperly dumped into public land�lls. Lawsuit exhibits reveal that
Bloom labeled itself with the EPA as a “large quantity generator” of hazardous waste. The
exhibits include pictures of Bloom employees wearing respirators as they handle 55-gallon
drums of what appears to be hazardous waste from emptied/cleaned collection canisters.


(Source: Unicat v. Bloom lawsuit exhibits
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/h2GD4H2okKKL1A))


To make matters worse, the company has procured over $1.1 billion in federal, state, and local
subsidies, often under the auspices of being green, clean, or renewable. As we will show, Bloom
is none of these and lately, multiple states have wised up and begun to withdraw or step-down
subsidies as a result – a move that we expect will further cripple Bloom’s business model.

Bloom’s Economic Reality: Never Been Pro�table, No
Expected 2020 Revenue Growth, An Estimated $2+ Billion
Undisclosed Servicing Liability and Losing Subsidies


Astonishingly, Bloom has never been pro�table despite its signi�cant historical revenue growth
and despite receiving over $1.1 billion in subsidies.


This chart shows Bloom’s quarterly net results, inclusive of its historic tailwinds:


(Source: Company �nancials)


With the company’s “bag of tricks” now empty and newly o�ered tepid guidance, we expect
these red bars to drop materially lower going forward.


Recent Conference Call: No Revenue Growth For 2020. The company recently acknowledged
(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4285021-bloom-energy-corporation-ceo-kr-sridhar-q2-2019-

achieve manufacturing economies of scale to lower costs and enhance its pro�tability, but in
the absence of growth, high overhead will further imperil pro�tability.


Subsidies Disappearing. Subsidies are disappearing entirely or being stepped down over time.
We estimate that the stepping down of the Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)
(https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/658), for example, will represent $247
million in foregone subsidies over the next 3 years.

Bloom’s Unsustainable Debt Burden: Large 2020 and 2021
Maturities Make this an Obvious Bankruptcy Candidate


Bloom’s debt situation has reached unsustainable levels. Per its most recently quarterly report,
Bloom has just $308 million in cash on hand, down from $325.1 million in December 2018. By
the end of 2020, $379.2 million in debt is coming due, with signi�cant 2021 maturities
thereafter:

)


Per the same quarterly report

menergyv4.htm), the company now has $701.3 million in total debt, with $431.7 million of that
total listed as recourse debt.


The largest chunk of the company’s debt is $296.2 million from its 6% convertible promissory
notes due December 2020. These notes present a problem for the company, as the conversion
price is now far out of the money, at $11.25 per share. This likely means that, upon maturity,

Bloom will have to put up the cash, unless it can enter into a re�nancing (which would likely
be on toxic terms).


Beyond the debt, we have also uncovered another massive liability, seemingly unknown to the
investing public, that we believe will seal Bloom’s demise.


Bloom Energy Has an Estimated $2.2 Billion In Undisclosed
Servicing Liabilities That We Expect Will Sink the Business


The Crux of the Problem: Bloom Places Itself on the Hook
for the Long-Term Performance of Its Systems (And Field
Data Shows They Don’t Last Long)


Backing up for a moment, one might ask—how does a new, relatively unproven company like
Bloom manage to sell so many fuel cell systems to so many Fortune 100 companies, when fuel
cell economics have repeatedly failed in the real world?


The answer is that Bloom’s contracts guarantee baseline performance levels—essentially
locking in the price of electricity for its customers. Per Bloom’s marketing literature
(https://www.bloomenergy.com/bene�ts/cost-predictability):


“We o�er the ability to lock in cost for electric power (other than the price of natural
gas) over the long-term…we provide a solution that includes all of the �xed-
equipment and maintenance costs for the life of the contract.”


These contracts place nearly 100% of the risk on Bloom and are very long-term—typically
lasting from 10 to 21 years [Pg. 101
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm)
] and lasting as long as 25 years. [Pg. 14

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 9/66


This is an incredibly attractive deal for customers, who can (and do) tout their forward-thinking
ways while also locking in cheap electricity.


Conversely, what this means for Bloom is that when the electrical output of its systems decline
—they are on the hook to replace them. Bloom has noted this as a key risk in its �lings:


“If our estimates of useful life for our Energy Servers are inaccurate or we do not meet
service and performance warranties and guarantees, or if we fail to accrue adequate
warranty and guaranty reserves, our business and �nancial results could be harmed.”
(10-Q Pg. 70
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x
10qxbloomenergyv4.htm#s40C1BD40B79150D1B9DD049C8BD12D2D))


Bloom is responsible for two types of replacements: its fuel cell servers (the system itself) and
the individual fuel cells that go inside the servers.


As experts have con�rmed to us, the high operating temperatures of solid oxide fuel cells
(800C or 1400F, and higher) make them extremely susceptible to wear and tear.


A fuel cell technician with 19 years of experience in the �eld made this clear to us and brought
up what would be a recurring theme with multiple experts we spoke to, durability:


“Bloom Energy is also a high temperature type application. They are using solid oxide
fuel cells, which is a very temperamental fuel cell in the �rst place. High
temperatures create a lot of issues whenever you’re dealing with the expansion of
di�erent components in it. I mean, you’re going up to 7-8-900 C. Whenever you’re
hitting those kinds of temperatures and then you’re cooling back down,
everything is expanding and contracting at di�erent rates and those type of
fuel cells su�er signi�cantly from breakage through those varying thermal
cycles.”


Our research has found that Bloom’s fuel cells and systems degrade signi�cantly faster than
expectations, yet the company barely records any liability for these issues.

No One Seems to Have Noticed the Accounting Trick That
Allows Bloom to Mask Its Liabilities: The Company Only
Discloses 1 Year of Servicing Liabilities Despite Servicing
Contracts that Last Up to 25 Years


So, how does Bloom justify largely ignoring its multi-year servicing liabilities?


We found a simple little line, buried on page 91 of Bloom’s 10-K, that explains it. (Note that this
line was NOT in the company’s IPO prospectus
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm)
):


“Customers may renew the MSAs (master service agreements) leading to future
expense that is not recognized under GAAP until the renewal occurs.” [Pg. 91
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000008/a2018q41
0kbloomenergycorp.htm)]


At �rst glance, this line looks rather benign. But what it means is that the company only books
the next year of servicing liabilities, rather than accounting for the liabilities across the full 10-
25 years of the contract.


Why? Because technically the customers have the option to renew their service contract every
year that they could – technically – choose not to exercise. Per the same �ling:


“The warranty and guaranty may be renewed annually at the customer’s option – as
an operations and maintenance services agreement – at predetermined prices for a
period of up to 25 years.” [Pg. 39
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000008/a2018q41
0kbloomenergycorp.htm)]


The obvious question is: why wouldn’t they renew? What customer wouldn’t push a ‘free money’
button that essentially guarantees them cheap, long-term electricity by renewing their service
contract?


Even Bloom acknowledges that customers don’t cancel these agreements:



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 11/66


“virtually no customers have elected to cancel their maintenance agreements”

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d4
24b4.htm)]


We found zero examples of customers not renewing these service agreements. Nonetheless,
Bloom records its servicing liabilities as if every customer will cancel every year. It’s no
surprise why this seems to have gone largely unnoticed given where it was buried in the
�nancials:


We have contacted the company and asked about its servicing liability accounting, as well as
the actual life of its new generation fuel cells and servers. We have not heard back as of this
writing. Should we hear back, we will update this piece accordingly.


Bloom: “We Expect to Average Over Five Years Between
(Fuel Cell) Replacements”


Reality: Field Data Suggests Replacements Are Needed
Before 3 Years, on Average


We have sourced extensive public data in order to track how Bloom’s systems are actually
performing.


As stated earlier, the major costs associated with Bloom’s long-term service liabilities relate to
degradation or damage to its (1) fuel cells and (2) fuel cell servers.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 12/66


We’ll start by discussing its fuel cells.


Bloom has claimed to have made big improvements to the life of its fuel cells, stating that fuel
cells installed in 2017 and onward will have a lifespan of over �ve years:


“Time to stack replacement’ primarily driven by our fuel cell stack lives—in the early
years, replacement was typically 12 to 18 months. Over the years we have made
steady improvements in our fuel cell lives, and from 2017 onwards we expect to
average over �ve years between replacements.” [IPO Prospectus Pg. 61
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518214115/d96446ds
1a.htm)]


We have tracked data on Bloom projects installed since 2017 through state utility records in
New York and California. There were 35 projects in all. After aggregating this data, we found
that even Bloom’s newest fuel cells will degrade below replacement thresholds in under 3
years, signi�cantly below the company’s “expectations”. We present this data later in the
report.


Our �ndings were corroborated by multiple experts in the �eld who were highly skeptical of
Bloom’s claim that solid oxide fuel cells could last 5 years or longer in the �eld.


We asked one professional fuel cell technician, with 19 years of experience, whether he
believed the company’s claims to be able to run solid oxide fuel cells for 5 years. He responded
with a curt “no”. When asked if the same fuel cells could operate for three years, he replied:


“Do I believe claims of 3 years before service is needed? No. I would be highly
skeptical.”


Another expert we contacted, with 14 years of experience working in Fuel Cells and Fuel Cell
Performance Analysis, who also has a B.S., M.S., and a PhD in Chemical Engineering, also
warned about temperature and durability preventing Bloom’s cells from running for 5 years:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 13/66


“They are using the high temperature materials, I think. So, there is advantages and
disadvantages. The disadvantage is that degradation is probably high. I doubt
they have 5 years life. They may have 1 or 2 max. They cannot achieve 5 years.
Or maybe if they have to replace part of the stack, they can achieve 5 years. In
general, it’s really hard for SOFCs to run 5 years.”


Bloom’s Unrecorded Servicing Liabilities: Project Data
Shows That Fuel Cells in The Field Will Need Replacement
Far Quicker Than the Company Lets On


Keep in mind that Bloom guarantees both the output (total electricity produced) and the
e�ciency (how much fuel is used to generate the electricity) of its servers:


“…we typically provide an Output Guaranty of 95% measured annually and an
E�ciency Guaranty of 52% measured cumulatively” [Prospectus pg. 75
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d4
24b4.htm)]


Bloom also provides tighter 80% quarterly output guarantees or 45% monthly e�ciency
guarantees on some of its projects. [Prospectus pg. 88 and 89
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/0001193125-18-
227590-index.htm)]


E�ciency and output decline together: As the systems become less e�cient, they produce less
electricity, making e�ciency degradation key to when fuel cells need to be replaced.


As we have seen from older Bloom project data in California and New York, fuel cell
replacements were typically done in the 48%-50% e�ciency range.


This chart, based on data from California (https://www.selfgenca.com/home/resources/) and
New York (https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/search/), shows how rapidly Bloom’s newer post-2016
installed servers are declining by month, on average. It also shows how the trend continues:

(Source: New York & California Utility Data & Author Analysis)


After only 25 months, Bloom’s newer fuel cell installations had deteriorated from a median
starting e�ciency of 58.3% down to 51.0%, a decline that puts them on pace to breach the 48%
threshold with 34 months (less than three years).[1]


The chart also shows that 45% e�ciency (which serves as a ‘bare minimum’ on some projects)
will be breached after only 42 months, or 3.5 years.[2]


This multi-year di�erence between expectation and reality will translate to an estimated $1.87
billion in fuel cell replacement costs:

Bloom’s Unrecorded Servicing Liabilities: Bloom
Estimates Its Fuel Cell Servers Last 15-21 Years


News Flash: They Don’t. The Company Has Historically
Replaced Servers A�er Just 4-7 Years

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 15/66


Moving on to the liabilities associated with replacing Bloom’s servers (as opposed to just the
fuel cells), our �rst check was to see how long the company estimates they will last. Keep in
mind that these systems run continuously at temperatures around 800C (or 1400F) in real-
world conditions.


Bloom shows, in its depreciation schedule, that it expects its servers to last for 15-21 years [Pg.
95
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000008/a2018q410kbloome
nergycorp.htm)]:


We think this depreciation schedule is horribly askew from reality.


For instance, Bloom sold servers in 2010-2012 that lasted only 4-6 years. They had been
replaced entirely by 2016. [Pg. F-39
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm)
]


Bloom also installed servers in Delaware in 2012 (https://www.bloomenergy.com/case-
studies/delmarva-power-case-study) that are now being replaced
(http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/Air/Documents/Bloom-Energy-Red-Lion-Brookside-permit-
application.pdf) after just 7 years (https://www.bloomenergy.com/newsroom/press-
releases/bloom-energy-upgrade-delaware-fuel-cell-project-investment-southern-power), as
announced this past quarter. [Pg. 11

menergyv4.htm)]


The company itself acknowledged that it had failed to achieve its own estimates previously:


“Early generations of our Energy Server did not have the useful life and did not
perform at an output and e�ciency level that we expected.” [Pg. 70
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 16/66


We are now being asked to trust the new estimates, which look to represent approximately a
3x improvement on prior server lifespans. Yet the company thoroughly disclaims its own
estimates, declaring them to be a key risk factor:


“Our pricing of [customer] contracts and our reserves for warranty and replacement
are based upon our estimates of the life of our Energy Servers and their components,
including assumptions regarding improvements in useful life that may fail to
materialize. We do not have a long history with a large number of �eld
deployments, and our estimates may prove to be incorrect.” [Pg. 70
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x
10qxbloomenergyv4.htm)]


Finally, our �eld research corroborates that Bloom’s servers have experienced trouble in the
real world.


We contacted several businesses to learn about the reliability of Bloom’s new systems. A Home
Depot in Greenbush, NY, told us that they had a system “blow” within a year of having it
installed. New York utility records (https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/reports/view/performance/?
project=750) show that the system was new, operating since December 2018. They also appear
to show sharp drop-o�s in electricity generated, consistent with what we were told.

We were told that another Home Depot, in Clifton Park, NY, [operating since September 2018
(https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/reports/view/performance/?project=753)] had its server come right
o� the building shortly after its installation, according to the same conversation. (We share
more details on this conversation, as well as conversations with other customers and experts,
in Part IV of this report.)


In short, Bloom’s expected server life is untested at best, and its history has demonstrated a 4-
7 year lifespan.


Even if we assume just 1 server replacement on an average outstanding contract life of 13
years, we estimate this to result in a nearly $1.5 billion unrecorded servicing liability:


(Note: For a full breakdown of our calculations and data sourcing see Appendix
A)


Bloom’s Undisclosed $2.2 Billion Liability by The Numbers


Bloom has been cagey about disclosing the actual life of its fuel cells/servers and other metrics
that would make its servicing liability clear to the market. In SEC comment letters
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000095012316019582/�lename1.htm), the
company redacts such information.


We have reached out to the company and asked what their estimate of servicing liabilities
would be when factoring in the full length of their contracts and have not heard back as of this
writing.


Below is our full breakdown of Bloom’s estimated undisclosed servicing liabilities, net of
expected servicing revenue during that same time frame. For the full breakdown of our data
collection and methodology, see Appendix A at the end of this report:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 18/66


Our overall view is that Bloom’s economics are reliant on unrealistic assumptions about the
useful life of its products. These are massive unnoticed liabilities that we expect will lead to
materially adverse consequences for the company in the immediate future.


In fact, we have already begun to see this issue rear its head. However, rather than recognizing
the reality of these costs, a troubling pattern has emerged where Bloom’s costs have been
masked by tricky accounting.


Servicing Liabilities Are Already Beginning to Show:
Bloom’s Accounting Methods Masked Service Losses and
Juked Revenue Numbers in the Recent Quarter


During the most recent quarter, Bloom disclosed it was commencing a project to
“decommission” 18MW worth of servers in Delaware. The servers are only about 7 years old,
yet the company is aiming to replace all of them.


As we know from Bloom’s service arrangements
(https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/119312518190488/38?cik=1664703), the company is on the
hook for the cost to replace servers. The company’s agreement on the project in question
makes this crystal clear:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 19/66


“Operator’s (i.e.: Bloom’s) responsibilities hereunder shall include, without limitation,
promptly correcting any Bloom System or BOF malfunctions, either by (i) recalibrating
or resetting the malfunctioning Bloom System or BOF, or (ii) repairing or replacing
Bloom System or BOF components which are defective, damaged, worn or
otherwise in need of replacement.” [Pg. 12
(https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/119312518190488/38?cik=1664703)]


One would think these unexpected server replacements would have represented a substantial
hit to Bloom’s servicing pro�tability in the quarter. Instead, we see that the company reported
one of its healthiest servicing margins to date. How could this be?


(Data in thousands. Source: Company �nancials)


In poring over the disclosures about the server replacements, we �nd that rather than
replacing the servers and taking the hit to servicing margins as we would expect, Bloom instead
engaged in a complex transaction that seems to avoid recognizing any servicing losses at all.


Instead, the company claims to be “selling” new servers to the same project and
BOOKING IT AS NEW REVENUE. [Pg. 35
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10qxbloo
menergyv4.htm)]


All told, we estimate the “decommissioning” transaction, net of supposed ‘new’ revenue, will
represent over $135 million in losses and cash out the door for Bloom in coming quarters.



https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312518190488/38?cik=1664703

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 20/66


The transaction is clearly cash �ow negative and will represent a near-term loss to Bloom,
yet its complexities mask the signi�cance and the timing of the cash outlays. These
complexities include:


$57.5 million to buy out equity in the project from one of Bloom’s �nancing partners [Pg.
33
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10q
xbloomenergyv4.htm)]


Post upgrade, Bloom’s remaining �nancing partner will receive 100% of the
revenues from the new servers and Bloom will receive none! This makes Bloom’s
newly purchased ‘equity’ a seemingly worthless piece of paper. [Pg. 33
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q
2x10qxbloomenergyv4.htm)]


$40 million in cash collateral, posted by Bloom, to indemnify against up to $97.2 million in
legal, regulatory, and tax liabilities.


Presumably, the partner views the risks of these liabilities as material, given the high
cash collateral, but Bloom has reserved nothing for them. [Pg. 34
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q
2x10qxbloomenergyv4.htm)]


$57.2 million in other liabilities, assumed by Bloom, that are vaguely contingent on
Bloom’s stock price. [Pg. 34
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10q
xbloomenergyv4.htm)] [Pg. 23-F
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/ex10-
1equitycapitalcontrib.htm)]
$72.3 million, paid by Bloom, as a partial payment to “repurchase” its old servers. [Pg. 33
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10q
xbloomenergyv4.htm)]


Despite these signi�cant cash outlays and assumption of liabilities, the decommissioning
transaction created the appearance of positive top line growth. In the recent quarter, Bloom
booked $91.7 million from the supposed ‘sales’ to replace its old servers, representing almost
40% of the revenue in the quarter. [Pg. 35
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10qxbloo
menergyv4.htm)]


This type of absurd transaction strikes us as textbook �nancial engineering. We �nd it
incredibly suspicious that, despite the transaction a�ecting numerous income statement items,
it looks to have avoided impacting ‘servicing’ items entirely.

Bloom’s Accounting Methods Mask Service Losses and Juke
Revenue Numbers: Part Two


This is not the �rst time Bloom has employed this type of accounting alchemy.


In Bloom’s IPO prospectus, it disclosed replacing 172 early generation servers in 2016 [Pg. 66
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm)
]. Once again, Bloom recorded the server replacements as NEW sales and classi�ed cash
outlays as investments instead of taking a servicing loss.


Bloom achieved this by determining that the server replacements involved such signi�cant
renegotiation of its old leases that it actually constituted a termination of the lease. We believe
this, in turn, conveniently allowed them to book substantial write-downs in the pre-IPO
period (where investors couldn’t see the write-down) while booking new revenue that
improved the �nancials disclosed publicly in the IPO.


(Source: IPO Prospectus Pg. 100
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm))


“Since the underlying assets under the arrangement were replaced (i.e., new
generation Energy Servers were installed in place of the decommissioned older
generation Energy Servers), the decommissioning of Energy Servers under the program
did not constitute a lease modi�cation, and was accounted for as a lease termination.
Through December 31, 2017, the Company has replaced 196 Energy Servers with
new generation Energy Servers sold as part of a new sales arrangement.”

million for the decommissioning of its PPA I Energy Servers.” [Prospectus F-39

We �nd it incredibly alarming that Bloom seems to be engaging in transactions that avoid
recognizing servicing losses in a forthright manner that is transparent to investors—or in some
cases, recognizing them at all.


The Edge of the Cli�: Why We Think These Servicing Issues
are An Imminent Problem


We believe that this absurd juggling act is coming to an end and will culminate in an erosion of
the company’s remaining cash over the next 6-12 months.


For starters, the company isn’t done replacing outdated servers and has acknowledged that it
needs to secure $92 million in �nancing to �nish the latest batch of replacements [Pg. 32
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10qxbloo
menergyv4.htm#s52B15F7CC3DB5C95BE9C6D5E6182A645)]


We have also begun to see a slew of ‘one time’ charges and write-downs that we fully expect
will continue in relation to upcoming server replacements. From the recent quarter alone [Pg.
35
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10qxbloo
menergyv4.htm#s52B15F7CC3DB5C95BE9C6D5E6182A645)]:


1. “We had repurchased and written-o� 10.0 megawatts of our earlier generation energy
servers for $25.6 million”


2. “We recognized charges related to the decommissioning of PPA II Energy Servers of $8.1
million”

3. “Additionally, in paying-o� the outstanding debt and interest of PPA II amounting to $77.7
million, we incurred a debt payo� make-whole penalty of $5.9 million”


4. “We had PPA II debt issuance costs written-o� of $1.0 million and additional interest
expense incurred for PPA 2 debt payo� of $0.1 million”


Finally, we took the current e�ciency of Bloom’s California and New York projects, roughly 200
in all, and found that almost 15% of its projects likely need imminent fuel cell replacements,
with almost 40% needing replacements within an estimated 14 months.


(Source: New York & California Utility Records & Author Analysis)


Extrapolating this data out, we estimate a $55 million imminent replacement liability with
another estimated $147 million replacement liability over the next 14 months. Once again, this
is just relating to fuel cell liabilities and does not include additional server replacement
liabilities.


The Edge of the Cli�: Bloom’s Servicing Liabilities Had
Historically Been Masked by Strong Revenue Growth. That
Growth Is Now Gone


The reason Bloom’s issues are now bubbling to the surface is a lack of new revenue.


The company’s revenue model is heavily ‘front-loaded’. When the company sells a new fuel cell
system, it collects 3 forms of revenue immediately:


1. Product revenue (for the physical fuel cell systems)
2. Installation revenue
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 24/66


3. The �rst year of service revenue in advance. [Pg. 61
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/0001193125-
18-227590-index.htm)] (Bloom also usually gets another 1-2 years of servicing revenue
before needing to replace systems, giving it up to 3 years of front-loaded servicing
revenue.)


After this jolt of initial revenue, Bloom collects a small ongoing annual servicing fee, but is
required to carry the burden of all servicing liabilities.


The company has reported strong historical revenue growth, which has allowed its servicing
liabilities to appear small relative to the in�ux of new money.


(Source: Company �nancials)


As mentioned earlier, Bloom acknowledged that it expects no revenue growth in 2020. The tide
has gone out. Without new revenue, we expect the replacement liabilities to quickly represent
larger and larger proportions of Bloom’s cost structure.


All told, we see a signi�cant deterioration in Bloom’s cash balance and net income over the
next year. With a large chunk of debt coming due by the end of 2020, we simply don’t see a
silver lining here.

a Hazardous Waste Producer Masquerading as
a Clean Energy Company

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 25/66


Putting aside economic sustainability, one of the biggest misconceptions about Bloom Energy
is the idea that the company is providing clean, green and/or renewable energy. As we’ll lay out
now in detail, this argument is severely misguided at best and deceptive at worst.


Bloom and its customers have consumed over a billion dollars in federal, state, and municipal
clean energy subsidies, yet Bloom emits more CO2 than the grid in key states it operates. In
fact, our �ndings show that the amount of CO2 Bloom Energy servers release into the air is
comparable to modern natural gas power plants.


Corporations and governments have begun to wise up to Bloom’s claims on the environmental
bene�ts of its products. Santa Clara California has essentially banned
(https://www.svvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BLOOM-ENERGY-PETITION-BASED-ON-
CALIFORNIA-ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY-ACT.pdf) new Bloom Energy natural gas installations
through recent legislation. New Jersey pulled the rug on subsidies to Bloom and other fuel cell
providers. [Pg. 16 (http://www.njcleanenergy.com/�les/�le/Library/6-29-16-8I.pdf)] California is
ending its program that subsidizes (https://fuelsave.de/cpuc-sta�-to-bloom-energy-your-fuel-

Would Bloom be alive today without receiving over $1 billion in subsidies based on
misconceptions around its product? Experts we spoke with, as we will detail later in this piece,
believe the answer to this question is “no”.


Bloom Produces Signi�cantly MORE Emissions Than the
Grid in Most States in Which It Operates


We compiled the average CO2 grid emissions in the states where Bloom primarily operates.
The majority of Bloom’s domestic deployments are in just 5 states (California, New York,
Connecticut, New Jersey & Delaware).


As can be seen in the chart below, Bloom is far dirtier than most of the states it operates in. In
Delaware, a state that is powered 98.6% (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/�les/2018-
02/documents/egrid2016_summarytables.pdf) by fossil fuels such as gas, coal, and oil, Bloom is
only marginally better:

Bloom Falsely Claims That Its Servers �unning on Natural
Gas Produce 50% Less Emissions than the U.S. Electric Grid


Bloom claimed in its prospectus:


“When running on natural gas, compared to average emissions across the U.S. grid,
Bloom Energy Servers reduce carbon emissions by over 50%.” [Prospectus Pg. 4
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000095012316015543/�lename1.
htm)]


This statement appears to be outright false, and by a wide margin. According to the latest
o�cial �gures (https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/unitedstates/) from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. grid emits 1,009 lbs/MWh of CO2.


Bloom’s own marketing documents (https://www.bloomenergy.com/datasheets/energy-server-
es5-200kw) show that its servers produce 679-883 lbs/MWh of CO2, a 12.5% to 32% reduction
from the grid average.

Our own review of 205 Bloom projects in New York and California showed that they are
producing an average of 835 lbs/MWh of CO2, a reduction of about 17.2% from the grid.


Bloom’s Carbon Emissions: Comparable to Those of a
Modern Natural Gas Power Plant


Not only do we believe Bloom’s statements about emissions relative to the grid to be outright
false, but comparing Bloom with “the grid” is the wrong comparison in the �rst place. The grid
is dirty and old. Coal accounts for about 75 percent
(https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/�les/2017/01/f34/Environment%20Baseline%20Vol.%201--
Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20the%20U.S.%20Power%20Sector.pdf) of the
grid’s greenhouse gas emissions and the average U.S. coal power plant is over 40 years old
(https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-dilemma-with-aging-coal-plants-retire-
them-or-restore-them/2014/06/13/8914780a-f00a-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html).


A proper comparison would be between a new natural gas-operated Bloom system and a
modern natural gas power plant. Using data from the U.S. Department of Energy
(https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/�les/2017/01/f34/Environment%20Baseline%20Vol.%201--
Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20the%20U.S.%20Power%20Sector.pdf), we
plotted data from Bloom’s new generation systems relative to the average for a modern
combined cycle natural gas power plant.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 28/66


The numbers are comparable. Bloom’s newest generation systems emit roughly 839 lbs/CO2
per MWh on average versus a modern natural gas plant that produces 896 lbs/CO2 per mWh.
[Pg. 18
(https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/�les/2017/01/f34/Environment%20Baseline%20Vol.%201--
Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20the%20U.S.%20Power%20Sector.pdf)] The
average across all 205 Bloom outstanding projects in New York and California was also
comparable at ~835 lbs/CO2 per MWh.


Note that as Bloom’s systems age and e�ciency goes down, they produce more CO2. (See the
appendix for the inverse relationship between e�ciency and emissions.) According to the data
we reviewed, after only about 24 months, Bloom’s systems will produce CO2 levels on par with
modern combined cycle natural gas plants (and then perform worse thereafter).


Bloom Also Wrongly Compares Its Emissions to the
“Marginal Grid” (We’ll Explain), Painting Another False
Picture of Its Emissions


Bloom has de�ected questions on its emissions by attempting to compare itself to the
“marginal grid” rather than the actual electric grid. So, what is the di�erence?


There are 2 types of power that feed the grid: baseload power and peak power.


1. Baseload power is the type of power that is meant to meet the normal demands of the
grid and is simply not easy to shut on or o�. (An example is a nuclear plant which takes
signi�cant time to “shut o�” once a nuclear chain reaction is commenced.)


2. Peak power (“marginal grid”) is the type of power that is turned on or o� during periods
of peak usage (such as during the dead of winter when people are using a lot of heat).
Peak power tends to be far dirtier because of the ine�ciencies introduced by starting and
stopping the generation process. When the term “marginal grid” is used, it typically refers
to (https://ww2.energy.ca.gov/2016publications/CEC-200-2016-003/CEC-200-2016-
003.pdf) peak power sources.


Bloom is clearly baseload power—after all, the �rst thing the company’s marketing documents
(https://www.bloomenergy.com/datasheets/energy-server-es5-200kw) tout is how it is “always
on”:



https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Environment%20Baseline%20Vol.%201--Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20from%20the%20U.S.%20Power%20Sector.pdf

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 29/66


This doesn’t seem to be by choice. Multiple experts we spoke with noted that Bloom’s solid
oxide fuel cells run into major issues if they are not “always on”. As we’ve noted, the systems
operate at temperatures of 800C (or 1400F), and higher. If shut o�, the drop in temperature
can crack and break the ceramics and materials in the fuel cells.


Nonetheless, Bloom has repeatedly, and wrongly, compared itself to the very dirty “marginal”
peak power sources, which make its technology seem cleaner on a relative basis.


We saw this in a recent interview with Bloom CEO KR Sridhar that aired in early September
2019. When an NBC Bay Area anchor questions Bloom’s emissions relative to the grid, Sridhar
responds:


“…we are lower in carbon footprint than the marginal grid, even in a state like
California which is very clean…”

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 30/66


This statement is technically true, but in the most incorrect way possible.


As shown in the earlier chart, Bloom’s systems are about 59% DIRTIER than the grid in
California when you don’t slip the word “marginal” into the sentence.


Bloom used the same type of ‘marginal’ misdirection when it was �ghting regulations in Santa
Clara California that sought to curb new carbon emissions. Santa Clara rightly rejected the
argument. (See an article on the subject here (https://www.svvoice.com/bloom-energy-

Santa Clara, California: We Are Moving Toward Fully

Bloom’s Response: This is a De Facto BAN on our Product


The �ght between Bloom and Santa Clara serves as an example of Bloom outright rejecting
renewables.


On May 7, 2019, the Santa Clara City Council required (https://www.svvoice.com/bloom-energy-
�les-ceqa-lawsuit-over-santa-clara-fuel-cell-requirements/) that new fuel cell projects in Santa
Clara use renewable biogas. This was e�ectively viewed as a “ban” of Bloom Energy, as the

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 31/66


company was forced to concede that the requirement to use biogas meant that Bloom
Energy Servers were infeasible. From Bloom’s own petition (https://www.svvoice.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/06/BLOOM-ENERGY-PETITION-BASED-ON-CALIFORNIA-
ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY-ACT.pdf):


“…the Resolution e�ectively bars residents and businesses in Santa Clara from
installing Petitioner’s fuel cells unless the fuel cells are powered by renewable fuels
sourced solely from within the State. It is infeasible, however, to satisfy this
condition because renewable biogas sourced solely from within the State is
virtually non?existent as a reliable fuel source or prohibitively expensive for a
commercial user.”


Rather than committing to move toward renewables, Bloom instead enlisted high-powered law
�rms to engage in aggressive lobbying (https://www.svvoice.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/06/Bloom-anti-trust-letter-May-2019.pdf) and ultimately litigation
(https://www.svvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BLOOM-ENERGY-PETITION-BASED-ON-
CALIFORNIA-ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY-ACT.pdf) in an e�ort to get Santa Clara to change
course from renewables.


Bloom Servers Accumulate Hazardous Waste, Including
Cancer-Causing Benzene


It turns out CO2 isn’t the only byproduct of Bloom’s systems.


In July 2018, Bloom disclosed that the EPA was seeking to collect $1m in �nes from the
company related to its disposal of benzene, which is hazardous waste found in Bloom’s
desulfurization containers. [Pg. 36
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518227590/d96446d424b4.htm)
] The company stated in its prospectus that it was contesting the �ne, and does not anticipate
‘signi�cant’ additional costs or risks from compliance with the latest guidance on hazardous
waste disposal.


The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined
(https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/benzene/basics/facts.asp) that benzene causes cancer. Long-
term exposure to high levels of benzene in the air can cause leukemia, cancer of the blood-
forming organs.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 32/66


Bloom’s S-1 (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/119312518214115?cik=1664703) from July 2018
seems to play down its exposure to benzene:


“… natural gas, which is the primary fuel used in our Energy Servers, contains
benzene, which is classi�ed as a hazardous waste if it exceeds 0.5 milligrams (mg) per
liter. A small amount of benzene (equivalent to what is present in one gallon of
gasoline in an automobile fuel tank which is exempt from federal regulation) found in
the public pipeline natural gas is collected by gas cleaning units contained in our
Energy Servers and is typically replaced once every 18 to 24 months by us from
customers’ sites.”


The above clever wording describes the relatively low levels of benzene found in natural gas.
What is not clearly conveyed, however, is that Bloom’s servers collect these small amounts of
benzene over long periods, eventually resulting in large quantities of the hazardous waste.


Bloom Has Been Sued for Allegedly Dumping Benzene in
California Land�lls. Court Documents Show Bloom
Labeled Itself a “Large Quantity Generator of Hazardous
Waste”


In 2016, corporate waste management company Unicat Services sued
(https://www.law360.com/cases/56b149e0fb48e44843000001/dockets) Bloom, alleging breach
of contract. Unicat had been hired to clean and dispose of Bloom’s waste canisters in public
land�lls but discovered that the canisters contained “extremely hazardous” and “toxic”
material. In the lawsuit, Unicat alleged that Bloom had been dumping benzene into the ground
in California instead of disposing of it properly.


For a company that has built its reputation on claims of being environmentally friendly, this
lawsuit essentially alleges that Bloom doesn’t care about the environment. From the complaint
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7up6B0KpCutebQ):


“Unicat Services was told [by Bloom] that Bloom Energy had the contents of the fuel
cell canisters emptied, canisters cleaned, and the extracted contents sent to public
land�lls for non?hazardous waste in Mexico and California. Unicat Services planned
on doing the same operation in Alvin, Texas…”

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 33/66


“Bloom Energy had e�ectively represented in 2013 that all of the canister
contents was nonhazardous and could be dumped at any public land�ll (the
process Bloom Energy told Unicat Services was being done in California and
Mexico).”


“As it has been trained by Bloom Energy, Unicat Services planned on emptying the
canister contents into the nearby roll?o� box and to transport the same to a public
land�ll as represented had been done in Mexico and California. However, prior to
taking the shipment to a public land�ll, [Unicat] as a matter of professionalism
and best?practices, decided to test the contents—just to be sure that it was
safe to take to a public land�ll. Their tests revealed that the Bloom Energy fuel
cell canisters that Bloom Energy had transported to Unicat Services (and,
according to Bloom Energy, had been previously emptied in Mexico and
California and dumped in public land�lls) contained an extremely hazardous
and toxic material – benzene, which can cause blood cancers under long
exposures, and which is a material clearly classi�ed as hazardous by federal
and state environmental authorities.“


The complaint showed that rather than rewarding Unicat for helping correct a major
environmental issue, Bloom tried to use it as leverage against Unicat:


“Unicat Services would have thought that an advertised “green” company like
Bloom Energy would have rewarded Unicat Services for bringing to Bloom
Energy’s attention the hazardous waste in Bloom Energy’s fuel cell canisters so
that Bloom Energy would not expose the environment and people to dangerous
toxins.“


“Instead of rewarding Unicat Services for �agging the benzene to Bloom Energy,
Bloom Energy used this as a renegotiating hammer to lower the per canister
price that Unicat Services could charge…”


Appended to the court documents were exhibits
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bN8HiY6oLwIKN1) that con�rm that Bloom is, in fact,
collecting large quantities of hazardous waste.

For example, in signed court exhibits (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bN8HiY6oLwIKN1) for
Bloom Energy �led with the EPA, the company calls itself a “Large Quantity Generator” of
hazardous or industrial waste.

The waste Bloom generates falls under 4 EPA codes (D018, D007, D008, D001) which, according
to the EPA hazardous waste codes (https://essr.umd.edu/epa-hazardous-waste-codes),
represent “Benzene”, “Chromium”, “Lead”, and “Ignitable waste”, respectively.


Attached to those same court documents
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/h2GD4H2okKKL1A), per an e-mail from a Bloom Energy
employee, are photographs of the “emptying/cleaning process of canisters”.


The employees undertaking the “emptying/cleaning process” are handling 55-gallon drums
wearing what appear to be respirators.

The lawsuit was settled con�dentially (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/HIREr0E3aYLVdp).


This hazardous waste generation seems to be starkly at odds with Bloom’s public image. For
example, in Bloom’s marketing video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?
time_continue=118&v=_aQiAWznaOc) touting its relationship with the city of Hartford,
Connecticut, it refers to its technology as “clean, reliable power without pollutants.”


Here’s our simple thought: before Bloom or Bloom customers receive any more government
subsidies, we urge authorities to investigate the allegedly illegal toxic benzene dumping by the
company.

As noted earlier, Bloom has consumed over $1.1 billion in subsidies on the Federal, state, and
local level, often under the incorrect auspices of being green, clean and/or renewable.


The company’s subsidies in California
(http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/E�le/G000/M156/K013/156013203.PDF) and New
Jersey (http://www.njcleanenergy.com/�les/�le/Library/6-29-16-8I.pdf) were curtailed after the
states determined they were not contributing to green energy goals.


(For a detailed state-by-state breakdown of Bloom’s subsidies see Appendix B.)


Delaware: Bloom Sold Us a Bill of Goods


In Delaware, the state and its residents have largely had a case of ‘buyer’s remorse‘ after
forking over $221 million (and counting) to Bloom in the form of grants and subsidies.


After a lobbying e�ort by the company, Delaware changed legislation
(https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/10/29/blooms-sweetheart-deal-del-keeps-
givin/92667946/) so that Bloom’s natural gas systems could be considered “renewable energy”.
The state has since come under much criticism for the subsidy, with Delaware State Senator
David Lawson declaring (https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2018/10/10/5-
surcharge-bloom-energy-your-power-bill-stay/1588381002/):


“I think we were sold a bill of goods.”

Bloom Has Complained That Green Energy Regulations
Are Threatening Its Business and Subsidies


Bloom has recently made it even clearer that it should never receive subsidies under the
auspices of being “green”. On Bloom’s most recent conference call, CEO Sridhar said that green
energy legislation in states like California (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-
aims-entirely-green-power-2045-gov-jerry-brown-signs-n908281) and New York
(https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/07/18/new-york-takes-lead-in-
climate-change-�ght-1107964) is creating “confusion” for its customers.


We disagree— the only confusion seems to have been the perception that Bloom’s natural gas-
fueled systems were ever green in the �rst place.


Contrary to Bloom’s complaint, the green legislation itself seems quite clear—states like New
York, California, Connecticut, and New Jersey are moving toward renewable energy
(https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38492):

This creates an obvious problem for Bloom, because the vast majority of its generators simply
aren’t renewable energy.


Customers Love “Greenwashing” With Bloom.


Home Depot: Bloom Provides Us “On-Site Renewable
Energy”…Such As Natural Gas


We agree with Bloom on one thing: its customers do appear to be confused.


For example, when Home Depot made an announcement
(https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/fuel-cells-providing-renewable-energy) in 2016
that it was working with Bloom, it called it a “renewable” energy source with “signi�cantly less
carbon emissions than traditional power sources.”

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 40/66


Once again, natural gas is simply not renewable.


Home Depot also parroted (https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/fuel-cells-providing-
renewable-energy) Bloom’s false claim that it produces 50% less CO2 than the grid average. It
then used this �awed metric to determine that installing Bloom’s systems had taken the
equivalent of 4,800 cars o� the road.


As we have shown earlier, Bloom is actually far DIRTIER
(https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/�les/2018-
02/documents/egrid2016_summarytables.pdf) than the grid in states like New York and
Connecticut, where Home Depot installed many Bloom systems.

Unfortunately for Home Depot (and for the planet) it’s more likely that installing Bloom Energy
Servers in clean states like New York and Connecticut added thousands of cars to the road.


This is the ultimate version of virtue signaling and greenwashing, and it’s all a result of what we
believe to be a false narrative peddled by Bloom Energy.


AT&T: “Our Bloom Natural Gas Fuel Cells” Count as an
“Alternative” Energy Source


Even though natural gas is hardly “alternative”, AT&T has counted its partnership with Bloom as
moving toward its alternative energy goals on its website
(https://about.att.com/csr/home/reporting/issue-brief/energy-management.html).


The renewable energy angle to the Bloom story is that its servers are capable of running on
biogas, though Bloom itself admits that biogas is expensive, isn’t readily available enough, and
is only used by a fraction of its customers.


Part III: Bloom Energy Executives Have a
History of Making Allegedly False Statements

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 42/66


Beyond the questionable value of Bloom Energy’s technology and the dubious “clean energy”
value proposition advanced by the company, we also see some red �ags with the executive
team.


The Company was Forced to Correct False Statements Made
by Its CEO on the Day of its IPO


In 2018, shortly after the company’s initial public o�ering, its Chief Executive O�cer, KR
Sridhar, had statements he made on the record “o�cially disavowed” after an interview with
MarketWatch (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bloom-energy-proves-it-should-not-be-
trusted-2018-07-31).


When he was initially asked on the day of Bloom’s IPO about the company’s pro�tability,
Sridhar told three MarketWatch sta�ers that Bloom was “a pro�table company as of [the
second quarter],” and he expected that to continue going forward.


MarketWatch asked a follow-up question to clear up whether Sridhar meant GAAP terms, to
which he answered “a�rmatively”. MarketWatch then used those comments as the lead for a
story published on July 26, 2018.


That statement turned out to be extremely incorrect:



https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bloom-energy-proves-it-should-not-be-trusted-2018-07-31

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 43/66


(Source: Company �nancials)


Following the piece, MarketWatch was quickly contacted by a spokesperson for Bloom Energy
with a “clari�cation”. The company explained to MarketWatch that Bloom expected to be GAAP
pro�table only on an operating basis, but not on a net basis.


But it turns out that wasn’t true either.


MarketWatch updated its story, but even then, the clari�cation – in addition to the original
statements – were deemed misleading.


Bloom Energy followed the clari�cation by making another clari�cation, this time a �ling with
the Securities and Exchange Commission
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518229785/d571586dfwp.htm)
itemizing its CEO’s misstatements and correcting them one by one.


MarketWatch then followed up with another piece
(https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bloom-energy-proves-it-should-not-be-trusted-2018-07-
31) summarizing its view of the experience:

Bloom Paid $16.7 Million to Settle Allegations That It Lied
to Its Brokers, Leading to Their SEC Sanctioning


In 2009, brokerage �rm Advanced Equities raised approximately $122M
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2012/33-9362.pdf) from 609 investors at a $1.45 billion
valuation for Bloom Energy. During the fundraising process, Advanced Equities allegedly made
several misstatements about Bloom Energy.


Advanced Equities and its founders were sued by the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-
release/2012-2012-191htm) in 2012 for those misstatements. The �rm placed the blame on
Bloom (https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-eve-of-ipo-bloom-energy-faces-questions-about-
settlement-with-former-investors-1532431801), claiming the company had “misled them and
caused them to get sanctioned by the SEC.”


The SEC lawsuit (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2012/33-9362.pdf) against Advanced
Equities alleged a series of bald-faced lies and fabricated documents, including that:


1. “[Advanced Equities] misstated that [Bloom’s] projected revenue of $2 billion “is currently
under contract and backordered”. In reality, [Bloom] only had between $10m and $42m
(10 to 42 individual hardware units) under contract as order backlog at that time.”


2. “…also misstated that [Bloom’s] CEO had shown [Advanced Equities] emails with a “$2
billion order from the CIA, which is not even in [Bloom’s] numbers.” In reality, [Bloom] did
not have any order or other agreement from the CIA for any dollar amount at that time.”

3. “[Advanced Equities] misstated again that [Bloom] was “getting $300m from the
Department of Energy” when in reality, [Bloom] had not yet received any funding from the
Department of Energy and had only applied for a $96.8 million loan.”


According to a July 2018 Wall Street Journal article (https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-eve-of-ipo-
bloom-energy-faces-questions-about-settlement-with-former-investors-1532431801), founders
of Advanced Equities had “threatened to sue Bloom, claiming that [Bloom] representatives
were the sources of false information…”.


At the time, Bloom Energy denied those allegations but still settled with the founders of
Advanced Equities, recording a $16.7M charge, according to documents reviewed by the Wall
Street Journal.


Co-founder of Advanced Equities, Dwight Badger, told the Wall Street Journal in 2018:


“I am currently under a con�dentiality agreement… and [Bloom] is currently seeking
to prevent me from releasing the information I have and claiming I breached the
agreement, a charge I deny.”


Part IV: Experts, Customers and Competitors
Reveal the Boring Truth About Bloom’s
Technology



https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-eve-of-ipo-bloom-energy-faces-questions-about-settlement-with-former-investors-1532431801
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 46/66


In preparing this piece, we spoke with dozens of people including experts in the fuel cell
industry, Bloom customers, competitors and former employees.


Our discussions indicate that Bloom’s technology is already well-understood, “pretty old”, and
still faces two major hurdles: cost and durability.


19 Year Fuel Cell Expert: Bloom’s Technology “Hurts the
Fuel Cell Industry” and “Public Image (of Fuel Cells)
Overall”


One of the very �rst conversations we had was with a technician with 19 years of experience in
the fuel-cell industry who has worked with everything from low temperature, low pressure
hydrogen air/hydrogen oxygen PEM fuel cells to high pressure hydrogen oxygen aerospace-
based fuel cells. His resume indicated a broad range of knowledge, from simple testing to
advanced lead design for aerospace applications.


We approached him as objectively as possible, letting him know we wanted to hear both the
good and the bad about the industry. When asked about Bloom Energy’s contribution to the
fuel cell space he didn’t hold back his immediate distaste; his �rst response was a long sigh.


“Not very excited about Bloom Energy,” he muttered, sounding disappointed. “My
opinion on Bloom Energy is that they may have gotten out a little father ahead of
themselves than they should have. Perhaps [they should have] spent a little more time
in research and gotten a better handle on what they were wanting to do before they
started bringing it to market.”


He continued:


“I feel like the general perception of Bloom Energy is that they kind of hurt the fuel cell
industry as a whole.”


When we asked why he thought they were hurting the industry, he responded:
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 47/66


“…they went out and made some pretty big bold claims, which would have been
awesome if it had been 100% accurate, but it’s looking like now that they made
some claims and got some money for some ideas that looked good on paper,
and didn’t necessarily have a lot of credence to it. So, in my opinion, when you do
that with the general public – when you promise them the moon, you better hit the
moon. Whenever you make big bold claims, you better be able to follow them up –
especially with something such as a temperamental R&D type subject as fuel cells. You
only get the one shot and whenever you don’t deliver, people aren’t super forgiving
whenever you invest a lot of money and don’t deliver on everything you said. In short,
my opinion is that they may have overstepped, and it is hurting the fuel cell
public image overall.”


Speaking about Bloom’s push to raise money:


“They were just making it very ‘oh yeah, this is great, it’s going to work, it’s no
questions’. I understand why they did it, but at the same time you can’t go to the
public and say this is going great, this is going to work and not address the
nuances…”


He also told us he thought Bloom had made these bold claims simply to raise money:


“For money. For the money. It’s my understanding they had tons of money coming in
from capitalists that were interested in – it’s kinda like, what is that show, Shark Tank?
You go out and you make the pitch and if you make the pitch well enough; they’re
going to give money to you. If you don’t make the pitch well enough, it’s not so much.
So, they were forced into making those kinds of bold claims to get the money.”


The technician continued, telling us again how he thought this was bad for the industry as a
whole:
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 48/66


“The problem is when you make those bold claims and then you can’t deliver, it really
turns everything sour. And it’d be one thing if it were just the investors, but they made
it so public and so widespread, that’s where I feel the disservice to the general industry
was. I’ve talked to multiple people that were not involved with fuel cells at all and you
mention fuel cells and they’re like, ‘Ah, I don’t know about that’. ‘You remember about
4-5 years ago Bloom Energy?’. ‘Bloom Energy, yeah I remember that. Did that work?
Didn’t that fall through or something?’ That’s not the image that the fuel cell
industry needs.”


Finally, we asked his opinion on whether or not Bloom was ahead of the rest of the industry.
He responded:


“No, I don’t think so. I think Bloom Energy is only recognizable by name. I think
your Ballard, your Plug Power, those are more industry leaders. They have more
equipment out there. They’re more involved with both the automotive and stationary
applications. I think – and they’re keeping a lower public pro�le until they can go and
get a lot of good solid data. They actually have quite a few busses up and running on
fuel cells.”


“I really think Bloom just made the misstep of going too public, too fast and not
having the ‘ooh’ and ‘ahh’ factor to maintain that approach,” he concluded.”


14-Year Fuel Cell Expert in Performance Analysis: “They
Use the Traditional Classic Materials”


We also contacted another expert with 14 years of experience working in fuel cells and fuel cell
performance analysis, who holds a B.S., M.S., and a PhD in Chemical Engineering. We asked
him if he thought Bloom had any intellectual property that puts them ahead of new SOFC
entrants. He responded:
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 49/66


“No, I don’t think so. These material developments are very real, very complicated and
very fundamental. So, in SOFC, we’ve made it better compared to 10 years ago.
But I don’t think there is revolutionary material [in Bloom’s products]. Based on
most of the disclosures, they’re using the traditional materials. It’s used in
other fuel cells. They use the traditional classic materials.”


We also asked about whether he thought the company’s marketing was accurate. He told us:


“I see in some news they said they have 5 year stacks. My guess is they may
have 2.5 or 3 year stacks. In that range. They probably have 50% [e�ciency]
they can reach for 3 years.”


“Based on their quarterly report, their cost is still much higher than other fuel cells. It’s
almost double in terms of cost. So that makes the electricity very high per kilowatt
hour. I would say, probably triple the electricity of the classic generation. I would
estimate their cost is probably 30 cents per kilowatt hour, based on my estimation
and their costs.”


Finally, we asked if he thought Bloom could operate consistently and pro�tably without
government incentives. He concluded:


“That is very hard for all the fuel cells now. It’s not easy.”


PhD in Mechanical Engineering and Fuel Cell Expert: Fuel
Cells Only Have a “50/50 Chance of Making It Long Term”


We also reached out to a U.S.-based PhD in mechanical engineering with research experience
assessing the life cycle environmental impact of SOFC systems using energy systems modeling.


We asked for his take on whether or not fuel cells could make it in the long term and he was
less than con�dent in his response. He also brought up durability and cost:
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 50/66


“I’d personally like to give you a di�erent answer, but I think based on the competition
I’m seeing from renewables and just conventional technologies, that I think fuel cells
have a 50/50 chance making it long term. Again, the issues being lifetime and cost.
The thing with lifetime is not only do you have to go through the maintenance
part of it, but when you replace a stack you’re basically paying for a whole new
stack. So, lifetime and cost are also very much intertwined.” 


“When it comes to the market, it also comes down to the cost. And I’d say even more
speci�cally to the lifecycle cost. So, there’s a capital cost, right? And that’s how much a
system will cost up front.  But then there’s a lifecycle cost which includes not only the
capital cost, which is that initial cost that you pay for the system, but it also includes
the fuel cost, it also includes the cost to replace stacks over the lifetime. And so it’s the
lifecycle cost that I’ve seen that is just not competitive at this point. It’s much higher
than internal combustion engines and microturbines.”


He continued, going into more detail on cost and calling into question what he thought about
Bloom’s costs versus what the Department of Energy is targeting. The numbers he used were
almost a decade old, but we thought the delta between Bloom’s cost versus the DOE target was
still worth noting:


“There’s very little information on Bloom’s costs that’s been made public. There was
one article published in 2010. Things have probably changed since then. There was a
cost that Bloom had released.”


“For a 100 kW Bloom energy system, it would cost $700,000 to $800,000. So the cost, if
I just do the math. That is $7000 to $8000 per kilowatt. So it’s about $7500 per
kilowatt for a Bloom Energy system. That’s in 2010. And DOE’s target is closer to $900
per kW.”


PhD and Fuel Cell Technology Graduate Professor: Bloom’s
SOFCs Are “Pretty Old Technology”


We also reached out to a PhD Professor of Engineering who teaches a graduate course in fuel
cell technology and studied materials for solid oxide fuel cells for his graduate degree.
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 51/66


We asked him how fuel cells would rank among other green technology in the line for
mainstream adoption. He told us:


“In terms of overall green energy, probably what’s best for the environment and
sustainable are wind and solar…”


He also brought up SOFC’s high temperatures as one of their key disadvantages:


“The main disadvantage with the solid oxide fuel cell is the high operating
temperature. They’re operating at around 700-800 degrees Celsius.”


When we inquired as to how likely he thought it was that Bloom had something extremely
unique with their patents, process or catalyst, he responded:


“Their technology is pretty old technology. It’s very well established.”


He also pointed to the main hang-ups in the solid oxide fuel cell industry as costs and
manufacturing.


“The science is solid. There isn’t anything thermodynamically that says that a fuel
cell will not work. That technology exists. It’s just now how you manufacture
such that you can deliver it in a low-cost way. I think that’s where the fuel cell
industry is at. I think even Toyota still has to handmake some of their fuel cells. The
components are not well suited for automation.”


Former Bloom Employee: “If Congress Didn’t Renew Their
Subsidies, Bloom Energy Probably Wouldn’t Exist Today”


We also spoke to a former Bloom employee who worked for the company in the late 2000’s
and has more than 15 years’ experience in servicing advanced energy products. 


He �rst recalled being recruited saying:
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 52/66


“The reason I turned it down was because of the product. Fuel cells have been
around forever. No one’s been able to crack the code to make it pro�table. Here
I am being recruited by a company that says otherwise.”


When we asked about whether Bloom had ‘cracked the code’ to get to pro�tability, the former
employee focused on subsidies:


“I don’t know how you do that without subsidies and the materials that are in that
thing are all rare earth materials which are pretty costly. There’s only a few countries
in the world – I think it’s China and Russia – that own the rare earth materials that are
being used in the thing. That’s my knowledge from 11 years ago. Things could have
changed, but it just seems like it’s just so expensive to make and produce and then
without the subsidies…


“…if congress didn’t renew their subsidies, Bloom Energy probably wouldn’t
exist today. I just don’t know how you make that. It’s just playing o� the green
energy/climate change things that are going on out there that people want to feel
good about this stu� and they’re buying these Bloom Energy boxes…”


He also talked about the company’s controversial project in Delaware:


“…the company was thrown a lifeline. They weren’t doing that well. You’ve got
the Obama administration – I think it was Joe Biden put the onus on the people in that
state to subsidize Bloom Energy. Bloom Energy made a bunch of promises about
employees that they never kept. But the people in Delaware are still paying. It’s crazy.”


He also commented about companies using Bloom products strictly for their PR image:
11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 53/66


“I think with Bloom Energy – like, Google and Apple and some of these �rms, are like
‘yeah, I want to get on the bandwagon because I can make my stockholders happy
because I’m doing something with green energy…’ A lot of green energy stu� that
was going out there maybe didn’t work well, but these people were willing to
take the risk and spend the money. Plus, they were getting subsidies so the pain
wasn’t that great, either. They all jumped in and took the risk.”


We asked the same employee about the idea of companies using Bloom Boxes to claim that
they’re using clean and green energy. He responded quickly:


“Well, they’re not really clean. They’re still putting out a bunch of carbon
dioxide. Everybody’s complaining about CO2 and yet, that’s a byproduct of this.
And over time it gets worse because the e�ciency of that fuel cell doesn’t stay 100%.”


Bloom Customers Weigh In


We also wanted to speak to people that had �rsthand experience with Bloom Energy servers.
After identifying project sites where Bloom servers have been installed through NYSERDA
records, we spent weeks calling and speaking to more than 40 locations where servers have
been installed.


Some people that we spoke to at businesses like Home Depot and Walmart (store managers
and assistant managers, mostly) told us that they didn’t really know much about the Bloom
Boxes on site. Most of the managers said they didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary unless
something went wrong. Several referred us to their corporate numbers, as the Bloom
installations were corporate-led initiatives.


The managers indicated that Bloom does all the servicing and didn’t have prescheduled
maintenance. They would see the service trucks come by from time to time but other than that
generally had no knowledge of how regularly they were serviced or to what extent.


Several of the managers that we spoke to, like one at the Home Depot in En�eld, said that the
energy boxes have helped their P&L, or that energy costs weren’t an issue. This was to be
expected, due to Bloom guaranteeing service at dirt cheap – and we believe unsustainable –
prices.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 54/66


The issue of durability was brought up on a call that we had with a Home Depot manager in
Greenbush, New York. As soon as we mentioned fuel cells to him, he launched into a story
about how one had “blown” right after being installed and how another, at a second location in
Clifton Park, “came o� the building”.


The Home Depot manager said:


“We had it blow once already and we lost power for about a day and a half. There was
a power surge and it blew. But other than that, it’s been quiet. You’d never notice it
until something’s wrong with it. We’ve only had it for maybe a year now, going on
maybe a year. A transformer blew on it.”


We asked him to con�rm whether the issue was with the Bloom boxes or the conventional grid.
He responded:


“It’s just hard when something does go wrong, you don’t know if it’s wrong with the
power company or the fuel cell, so everybody’s gotta �gure out who’s problem it is
before they’ll �x it. It took longer to �gure out who was responsible to �x it than
getting it repaired.”


“It was the fuel cell. It was them.”


We were able to corroborate the claims by looking into the public NYSERDA data
(https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/reports/view/performance/?project=750) for Home Depot
Greenbush, which shows an interruption in service in late January 2019. E�ciency numbers
dropped across the board for a three-day period.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 55/66


Finally, he o�ered up a story about another Home Depot store in Clifton Park that had
installation issues that were eventually resolved:


“They didn’t use the right bolts and everything came o� the building. They had to re-do
it. They didn’t use the right bolts. They had it corrected by the time they got to our
building. I guess there was an issue with the anchoring system.”


Conclusion: We Are Witnessing Another Falling
Unicorn


All told, we believe that Bloom Energy is facing numerous material and imminent problems.


With the company’s accounting issues now exposed, we hope shareholders will demand far
more detail going forward. We also hope the company’s various partners will be more vigilant
in understanding the company’s carbon and hazardous waste footprint.


Bloom’s story arc strikes us as reminiscent of other fallen Silicon Valley unicorns:


1. Lay out a grand vision to save the world
2. Overpromise
3. Draw accolades from everyone, raise billions of dollars
4. ‘Fake it ‘til you make it’
5. Never actually make it

https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 56/66


Simply put: the problems with Bloom’s technology, accounting, undisclosed liabilities, debt
burden, emissions & hazardous waste issues, in our opinion, put the prospect of bankruptcy or
a reorganization on the table over the next 12-18 months.


Appendix A: Methodology & Data Collection—How to
Replicate Our Work


Ideally, we want the company to respond to our questions and o�er the market a full
explanation of its economic liabilities, CO2 output, accounting practices and other key issues.
We welcome a response from the company, but in the event that they do not respond, we also
want readers to be able to fully replicate and understand our work.


This thesis required a lot of unique data collection and number crunching, so we view it as
important that we detail our methodology for both gathering and processing the data to help
readers understand how we arrived at assumptions and conclusions. We encourage readers to
download, examine, and question these datasets and our approach themselves.


Starting with our estimate of Bloom’s servicing liabilities:


The data and assumptions that went into it:


Cost to replace fuel cells: Bloom doesn’t disclose how much fuel cells cost relative to
total product, but EPA research shows that fuel cells represent roughly 29.3% of the total
cost of a server. [Pg. 114].

(including Bloom’s) show that the fuel cell servers cost roughly 2/3 more than the fuel cell
itself. [Pg. 21
(http://www.njcleanenergy.com/�les/�le/Library/NJCEP%20CHP%20%20FC%20Evaluation_
REV%20FNL_%2006_23_17%20(2).pdf)] We used the EPA metric to estimate cost to replace
fuel cell and applied this percentage to Bloom’s product cost per kW in the latest quarter:
$3,045/kW [Pg. 47
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10q
xbloomenergyv4.htm)]. We used ONLY product cost for this calculation (rather than total
installed system cost) because fuel cells can be “hot swapped” and therefore do not
require incremental installation costs.
Fuel cell life: This is based on our collection and extrapolation of Bloom’s new generation
5 servers from data in California and New York (more on this below).
Current replacement cycle: We are currently mid-way through the replacement cycle.
(In reality, we expect the company to replace many cells imminently, as shown by the
current Generation 5 fuel cells nearing replacement thresholds, but we wanted to err on
the side of conservative).
Recovery value: We examined what the recovery value of fuel cell/server replacements
could be. Department of Energy research has determined that recovery value for SOFC
replacements “would not be signi�cant” [Pg. 105
(https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/�les/2018/02/f49/fcto_battelle_mfg_cost_analysis_100
_250kw_pp_chp_fc_systems_jan2017.pdf)]
Total install base: The latest quarterly total install base was 412 mW per company
�nancials [Pg. 70
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000166470319000025/a2019_q2x10q
xbloomenergyv4.htm)]
Cost to replace servers: 70.7% (or 1-29.3%) of the company’s reported total installed
system costs (TISC) per kW for the latest quarter; $5,274. (This assumed that fuel cells are
not replaced along with the servers. If the cells must also be replaced the cost would be
signi�cantly higher.) We used TISC for this estimation because servers would require new
installation, whereas fuel cells can simply be “hot swapped” and therefore would presume
to only impact product costs rather than total installation costs.
Fuel cell replacement liability: Based on the expected fuel cell life from �eld data
tracked from New York & California, fuel cell cost, and length of time left on average
contracts.
Server replacement liability: All told, we assume 1 server replacement per average 13
year remaining contract life, given the company’s historic 4-7 year replacement rates.
Service revenue: We extrapolated the latest quarterly service revenue run-rate across
the 13-year average remaining life. [Pg. 48

11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 58/66


Monthly performance data was obtained in two states, New York and California. These are the
only states we could identify with robust and regularly-updated data on energy systems.


California’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) publishes performance data on its
website. See Monthly PBI Performance Report under Number 9 here
(https://www.selfgenca.com/home/resources/).


New York has a similar program. The New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority, known as NYSERDA publishes Distributed Energy Resources (DER) data on projects
they fund. To see Bloom generators in �eld we searched “bloom energy” in the
installer/developer section here (https://der.nyserda.ny.gov/search/).


To get a sense for how Bloom’s newest version of generators performed, the analysis focuses
on generators that were installed post 2016. We did this because Bloom stated that it expects
5-year performance from its fuel cell lives from 2017 onward and we wanted to test this
speci�c claim:


“Time to stack replacement primarily driven by our fuel cell stack lives in the early
years, replacement was typically 12 to 18 months. Over the years we have made
steady improvements in our fuel cell lives, and from 2017 onwards we expect to
average over �ve years between replacements.” [IPO Prospectus Pg. 61
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518214115/d96446ds
1a.htm)]


To isolate generators installed after 2016, the “interconnection date” in SGIP data and the �rst
month of generation in the NY data was used in the data set.


There were some instances where generators exhibited strange performance in the data (such
as generators operating at below 40% e�ciency or seeming to break). With the e�ciency,
output and emissions samples we attempted to scrub out data points that appeared to be
mostly negative outliers in order to give Bloom the bene�t of the doubt (such as generators
beginning to operate signi�cantly below or above standard LHV e�ciency between 40% to 70%,
then sharply reverting). Had we included these potential outliers, Bloom’s performance would
have likely been signi�cantly worse.


Higher Heating Value to Lower Heating Value E�ciency Conversion

11/4/2019 Bloom Energy: A “Clean” Energy Darling Wilting to its Demise – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/bloom-energy-a-clean-energy-darling-wilting-to-its-demise/ 59/66


A multiple of 1.107 (see page F-1 (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/119312518190488/38?
cik=1664703)) was used to convert the higher heating value e�ciency provided by NYSDER to
the lower heating value e�ciency Bloom uses on its guarantees. This is the conversion factor
found in Bloom’s contracts with customers.


Emissions: Pounds of CO2 per MwH


To calculate pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour emissions the following formula was
used


(3.412 MMBtu / 1 MWH)  /  HHV E�ciency * (117 pounds of CO2 / 1 MMBtu) =  x bls carbon
dioxide / MWH


1 MWH is equivalent to 3.412 MMBTU. This is the conversion factor Bloom uses in its
contracts (page F-1 (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/119312518190488/38?cik=1664703))
1 MMBtu unit = 117 lbs of CO2 see Natural Gas row from the Energy Information
Administration here (https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php)
Heat rate = (ideal heat rate)/e�ciency = (3412 Btu/kWh)/e�ciency


Fuel Cell Replacement Threshold


Bloom appears to be replacing fuel cells between 50% and 48% LVH e�ciency. Fuel cells
degrade linearly over time
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000095012316019582/�lename1.htm), yet
between these e�ciency ranges across Bloom’s project base we regularly see sustained spikes
in e�ciency. The reason inferred for this is because fuel cells are being replaced in order to hit
e�ciency targets.


The largest source of historical data obtained on Bloom generator’s past operating
performance is from the state of California’s SGIP program
(https://www.selfgenca.com/home/resources/). Of the over 10,000 performance months dating
back to 2012 in the SGIP data (each representing a historical month of operating performance
from a Bloom generator dating back to 2012) less than 1% (89 instances) were operating below
48% LHV e�ciency. (Of those, some were showing 0% e�ciency, suggesting a system
shutdown or other issue.) Less than 3% (256 instances) operated below 50% LHV e�ciency. The
data suggests that fuel cells are almost always being replaced before hitting the 48% LHV
e�ciency threshold.

Appendix B—Breakdown of Federal, State, and Local
Subsidies to Bloom Energy


Here’s a breakdown of Bloom Energy’s subsidy receipts to date:


Federal Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC): This program is often associated with solar
(https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-investment-tax-credit-itc) and renewable
(https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10479.pdf) energy. Bloom has received an estimated $360
million from the program, but these subsidies are stepping down
(https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/658) starting in 2020. We estimate that
this step-down will result in $247 million in foregone subsidies to Bloom over the next 3 years
at current annual run-rates.


We estimated the $360 million number by applying the 30% ITC to roughly $1.2 billion in
product & installation revenue since 2014. We based our estimate of the foregone subsidies
over the 3-year step-down period by using the 2018 annual run rate applied to the modi�ed
ITC percentage subsidies from the link above.


California Self-Generation Incentive Program: Bloom received $376 million from this
program as of 7/29/2019 (https://www.selfgenca.com/documents/reports/statewide_projects).
In 2016, California modi�ed the program (https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?
language=ENG&format=PDF&sourceid=emgpm&document_id=1080682181&serialid=i%2F1SK
wdgoxhhtAnpyo2ulNVUiPyYRMfQVjTy0pKNIMY%3D&cspId=1766843314440822784) after
releasing a report
(http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/E�le/G000/M156/K013/156013203.PDF) indicating that
Bloom Boxes were too expensive and released too much carbon to warrant incentives.


The modi�ed incentive system requires replacing natural gas with biogas. With 91% of Bloom’s
servers operating on natural gas, the change rendered the program largely out of reach for the
company. It is set to expire (https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/552) January
1, 2021 regardless.


Federal Recovery Act: Bloom received $152 million for two projects [1
(https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/�nancial-markets-�nancial-institutions-and-�scal-
service/1603-program-payments-for),2
(https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Documents/Website%20Awarded%20as%20of%

energy products, which mainly consisted of renewables but also included fuel cells. The

(https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Documents/Website%20Awarded%20as%20of%

Delaware: Bloom has received $221 million between grants
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1664703/000119312518190488/d96446dex991.htm)

Review-v2-003.pdf)]


New Jersey: Bloom and other fuel cell providers were ejected from the New Jersey Clean
Energy Program (http://www.njcleanenergy.com/) (NJCEP) in 2016 over concerns relating to
excess costs and carbon emissions [Pg. 16 (http://www.njcleanenergy.com/�les/�le/Library/6-
29-16-8I.pdf)] Prior to that point Bloom had received $18.6 million from the program, per a
FOIA request (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/IeKZ1575x227uu).


Connecticut: We submitted a FOIL request to Connecticut but have not heard back as of this
writing. We can con�rm however that at least $35.4 million in subsidies have gone to Bloom
from Connecticut from media articles (https://www.hartfordbusiness.com/article/ct-fuel-cell-
program-shuns-ct-fuel-cell-industry).


New York: The state has been mum about subsidies paid to Bloom to date. We submitted a
FOIL request but received no records back. We know that the state has awarded Bloom
subsidies at least twice (1

Announcements/2017-01-12-Governor-Cuomo-Announced-360-Million-for-Large-Scale-
Renewable-Projects)) but given the absence of speci�c data we did not factor any New York
subsidies into our estimates.

Massachusetts: Bloom tried and failed to “make non-combustible fuel cell technology eligible”
under a 2010 renewable energy program, according to media articles
(https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bloom-asks-massachussets-lawmakers-for-

Appendix C: Questions We Asked Bloom


We emailed Bloom and asked a number of questions. We have not heard back as of this writing
but will update this report with their responses should we receive a reply. We �gured it best to
share these with readers to give a sense of the questions we would like the answers to:


You have stated that your expectation for fuel cell life from 2017 and onward is over 5
years. What is the actual performance of the fuel cells thus far and how does that
compare with expected life?


Do you have any internal estimates of what the service liabilities would be over the life of
the customer’s contracts? If so, could you make that available along with expectations of
service revenue over the life of the customer’s contracts?


Can you con�rm whether the �nancials only account for the next year of expected
servicing revenue/liabilities?


Do you see any other potential renewable applications of the product? The company
announced hydrogen as a fuel source and alluded to other potential avenues recently.


What performance do you expect out of the gen 7 servers in development? What about
expected lifecycle, or is it too early to say?


How important is the price and supply of scandium to Bloom’s supply chain? Can you give
a sense of how scandium prices over time have a�ected the TISC?


How much does it cost to replace a fuel cell stack?


How much does it cost to replace an entire fuel cell server?


At what e�ciency levels do you typically start replacing fuel cells?


What are the criteria that determine whether to replace a server?

[1] We used the median starting point in month 1 because there were outliers in the �rst
month that would have skewed the results signi�cantly downward, likely because systems
needed to get fully up and running. We used average thereafter.


[2] Bloom states that its servers degrade linearly over time, thus we extrapolate using straight-
line degradation. Per Bloom’s �lings: “the e�ciency of the Energy Server decreases very
gradually from the beginning of life e�ciency toward the end of life e�ciency. This decrease is
very nearly linear in nature (i.e., a straight-line slope).” (Pg. 31
