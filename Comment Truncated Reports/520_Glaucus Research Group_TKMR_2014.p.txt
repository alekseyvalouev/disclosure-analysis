Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ: TKMR) ("Tekmira" or the “Company”) is a Vancouver-based biopharmaceutical 
company focused on developing RNA-interference ("RNAi") delivery technology using the Company’s proprietary lipid 
nanoparticle ("LNP") delivery platform.  In the last three months, Tekmira’s share price has nearly doubled because the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) temporarily lifted a clinical hold on the Company’s anti-Ebola RNAi therapeutic 
(“TKM Ebola”) to allow the drug’s administration to Ebola infected patients in emergency situations.   
 
Tekmira is hugely overvalued and its share price is poised to collapse.  Tekmira’s RNAi technology is unproven, the FDA 
halted TKM Ebola’s Phase I trial because of safety concerns, and despite limited use it appears that the drug is unpopular 
among treating physicians.  In our view, the drug is highly likely to fail the FDA approval process.  Once the speculative 
bubble bursts, we believe that Tekmira’s shares will crash to a pre-Ebola price of $7-10 per share. 
 
1. Dose of Reality.  In July 2014, the FDA placed a clinical hold on Phase I trials of TKM Ebola, reportedly because of 


elevated cytokine levels among healthy volunteers (which at higher levels can prompt dangerous inflammation and 
other negative responses from the immune system).  A failure at this stage over safety concerns makes it highly unlikely 
the drug will ever be approved.   


 
a. Doctors Fear that TKM Ebola is Toxic and Unsafe.  Temporary approval for emergency administration does 


not change the fact that the FDA halted Phase I trials because of TKM Ebola’s safety risks and potential toxicity.  
Indeed, experts have cautioned that treating physicians may be reluctant to administer TKM Ebola because of the 
perceived risk: “they may want to use a drug with the cleanest safety profile. You may not want to give him a 
drug that will push [patients] over the edge.”  Put simply, TKM Ebola has not been shown to be either safe or 
effective and its limited use in the current crisis does not increase the likelihood of approval by the FDA.  
 


b. Treating Physicians Seem to Prefer Other Experimental Treatments. To our knowledge, TKM Ebola was 
only administered after supplies of a competitive treatment, ZMapp, were exhausted.  TKM Ebola has only been 
administered to two patients (one in Nebraska, one in Norway) and the hospital in the US which first administered 
TKM Ebola chose a competitor’s drug, Brincidofovir, to treat a subsequent patient.  It appears that treating 
physicians clearly favor blood transfusions from survivors, Brincidofovir and especially ZMapp over TKM Ebola. 


  
2. Partners Know Best: Declining Interest in Licensing or Partnering with Tekmira.  Pharmaceutical companies who 


have signed licensing, collaboration or partnership deals with Tekmira appear unlikely to renew such arrangements and 
seem uninterested in pursuing further commercial relationships.  Specifically, Roche, Alnylam and Bristol Myers 
Squibb all signed deals with Tekmira at the height of RNAi excitement in 2008-2009, and subsequently each one either 
terminated this collaboration (Roche, Alnylam) or seem uninterested in increasing a paltry commercial commitment 
(BSM).  It therefore appears that developers and other insiders do not assign Tekmira’s technology a high probability 
of commercial success.   
 


3. Impractical Delivery Mechanism.  TKM Ebola is wildly impractical for distribution in Ebola target zones (Sub-
Saharan Africa) because it is administered intravenously, which requires trained medical personnel and resources.  This 
makes TKM Ebola’s widespread commercial use unlikely in Sub Saharan African regions that could not contain the 
spread of Ebola because they lacked trained medical professionals and such basic resources as masks, gowns and gloves. 


 
4. Tekmira’s RNAi Technology is Unproven.  Since Andrew Fire and Craig Mello’s groundbreaking 1998 paper, not a 


single RNAi compound has been successfully approved by the FDA for clinical development.  The technology has 
fallen into such disfavor that Merck, Roche, Pfizer and Abbott appear to have divested or abandoned their respective 
in-house RNAi research efforts. 


 
5. Valuation.  We believe that Tekmira is hugely overvalued and that its share price is poised to collapse.  RNAi 


technology is unproven, TKM Ebola’s Phase I trial was halted over safety concerns, and nothing since, including limited 
application to two patients under exigent circumstances makes it any more likely that TKM Ebola is safe, efficacious 
and thus likely to gain FDA approval.  In addition, there is evidence that treating physicians prefer other experimental 
treatments, and it appears that presumably due to concerns over TKM Ebola’s safety risks, Tekmira’s Ebola therapeutic 
is an experimental treatment of last resort.  We therefore believe that Tekmira should be valued at its pre-Ebola 
valuation, between $7-10 per share.

DOSE OF REALITY FOR TKM EBOLA 





In August 2014, the FDA’s decision to allow the administration of experimental treatments, including TKM 


Ebola, under emergency circumstances prompted an 80% jump in the price of Tekmira’s shares in just four 


trading days.  But it is critical to note that the use of TKM Ebola in exigent circumstances does not increase 


the likelihood that the therapeutic will receive FDA approval or in any way undermine the primary 


detractions of Tekmira’s technology, including credible concerns about the safety and toxicity of the 


treatment.     





1) Doctors Fear that TKM Ebola is Toxic and Unsafe 
 


The purpose of Phase I of clinical trials is to test a new drug in a small group of volunteers to evaluate its 


safety and identify any side effects.  60-65% of prospective drugs pass Phase I clinical trials, so a setback 


at this stage over safety and potential toxicity concerns makes it highly unlikely that a prospective drug will 


ever be approved.   





In January 2010, Tekmira reported that it had prematurely terminated a Phase I clinical study of TKM-


ApoB (the first clinical candidate to employ Tekmira’s proprietary LNP delivery platform) due to immune 


stimulations observed in healthy patients at moderate doses (0.6mg/kg).  This result did not come as a 


surprise to many industry insiders.  Indeed, one executive in the RNAi space who had been involved in a 


collaboration with Tekmira, admitted with respect to the Company’s LNP delivery technology that “the 


liability of the platform is absolutely its safety.”1   





In response, Tekmira purportedly addressed potency issues and was set to re-test the tolerability of its 


proprietary LNP delivery platform.2  Tekmira got its chance, and on March 5, 2014, the Company received 


Fast Track designation from the FDA for Phase I clinical trials of TKM Ebola.  It did not go well.   





In July 2014, Tekmira received a notice that the FDA had placed TKM-Ebola’s Phase I trial on a clinical 


hold because of elevated cytokine levels observed in healthy volunteers.  Cytokine release can spur deadly 


fevers in patients and cause negative responses from the immune system.3  Under the FDA's CFR Title 21, 


the FDA can put Phase I investigations on clinical hold if it believes that “human subjects would be exposed 


to an unreasonable and significant risk of injury.”   





This prompted a sell-off in the stock, both because of the apparent failure of the TKM Ebola but also 


because of the implications of the clinical hold for TKM’s other therapeutics, principally TKM-HBV.  TKM 


Ebola generated side effects which could make patients feel worse at the onset of treatment, which could 


deter its administration to very sick patients (many Ebola patients are, unsurprisingly, very sick when they 


finally seek treatment, especially in Africa). 





One month later, in August 2014, the Ebola situation in West Africa worsened and the first person died 


from the disease in Western Europe.  This prompted the FDA to modify its clinical hold on TKM Ebola to 


a partial hold, meaning that TKM Ebola could be administered in emergency situations to infected patients.  


However, the FDA cautioned that the study “[remains] on clinical hold as it relates to the multi-ascending 


dose portion of the Phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers with TKM Ebola.”

Investors do not appear to have heeded such caution.  Tekmira’s stock skyrocketed almost as quickly as 


stupidity regarding Ebola proliferated.  Jason Kolbert of Maxim (which, unsurprisingly, was a co-manager 


on Tekmira’s October 2013 round of capital raising) reportedly raised his price target from $23 to $31 due 


to accelerated assumptions for TKM Ebola. 





2) Treating Physician Prefer Other Experimental Treatments 
 


Seemingly forgotten in Tekmira’s stock bubble is that TKM Ebola was administered to treat patients only 


after the supply of the preferred experimental therapy, ZMapp was exhausted.   





Following the partial lift, TKM Ebola was administered to Dr. Richard Sacra, an American who was flown 


back to Nebraska Medical Center from Liberia for treatment.  He survived.  Tekmira’s stock soared in 


response, despite the fact that Dr. Sacra also received other treatments (in addition to TKM Ebola) and there 


was no conclusive evidence that Tekmira’s therapeutic had any effect on the patient’s recovery.      





Indeed, Dr. Angela Hewett, associate medical director of the Nebraska Medical Center's bio-containment 


unit, cautioned that it was unclear if TKM Ebola was effective: “we don’t know if it was Dr. Sacra’s own 


immune system, the supportive therapy we provided, the blood transfusion from Dr. Brantly, TKM Ebola 


or a combination of all these factors that helped Dr. Sacra recover.” 





Then the bad news for Tekmira started rolling in.  On October 6th, at the request of treating physicians, the 


FDA approved Brincidofovir, a drug offered by Chimerix, for administration to Ebola patients.  On October 


7th, Nebraska Medical Center disclosed that it would administer Brincidofovir, not TKM Ebola, to NBC 


cameraman Ashoka Mukpo.   Nebraska Medical Center was the only hospital in the U.S. (to our knowledge) 


to administer TKM Ebola, so many investors took its decision to administer Brincidofovir to Mukpo as a 


tacit rejection of TKM Ebola.   





On October 9th, a panel of WHO experts said that after reviewing the status of all the potential experimental 


therapies and vaccines, blood plasma and whole blood transfusions should have priority for the time being.  


Indeed, three Ebola patients who received a blood transfusion from Dr. Brantly, including Mukpo, Sacra 


and Nina Pham, have survived.  





To our knowledge, TKM Ebola has not been administered in the United States since it was used to treat Dr. 


Sacra. 





We have compiled, based on our review of the publicly available disclosures, a table setting forth the 


various treatments administered in North America and Europe to patients infected with Ebola.  Although 


this list is not dispositive, we believe it is indicative in that it shows that the preferred treatments appear to 


be ZMapp and blood transfusions from surviving patients.

As shown above, it appears that treating physicians have preferred blood transfusions and the drugs of 


Tekmira’s competitors (ZMapp and Brincidofovir) to TKM Ebola.  We could only find two instances were 


treating physicians administered TKM Ebola.  In each case, it appears that the treating hospital accompanied 


the administration of TKM Ebola with the administration of a competitor’s experimental treatment (ZMapp 


or Brincidofovir). This makes it appear as though TKM Ebola is a treatment of last resort.   





Even the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) appears to favor ZMapp as the preferred treatment.  The 


CDC’s webpage dedicated to experimental Ebola treatments discusses ZMapp and its application and 


availability for the first 10 paragraphs, whereas TKM Ebola only receives passing mention by the CDC in 


one paragraph at the bottom of the page.   





Admittedly, the sample size is tiny and investors should be wary of drawing conclusions.  But to our 


knowledge, the only hospital in the United States to administer TKM Ebola preferred the drug offered by 


its competitor to treat a future patient.   





As noted by University of Pittsburgh Medical Center specialist for infectious disease, Amesh Adalja, 


treating physicians may be reluctant to administer TKM Ebola because of the perceived safety risk: “they 


may want to use a drug with the cleanest safety profile. You may not want to give him a drug that will 


push him over the edge.”  TKM Ebola’s risk profile suggests that despite its temporary approval for 


emergency use, investors should not be pricing into its stock price a high likelihood that it will widely 


adopted as a treatment or that such limited application increases the likelihood of FDA approval.

CUSTOMERS KNOW BEST: DECLINING INTEREST IN TEKMIRA 





We admit that it is difficult to predict whether experimental treatments will succeed.  But we trust that those 


closest to Tekmira’s technology know best.  And it appears as though Tekmira’s customers and former 


collaborators assign the technology a low probability of success.   





1) Customer Churn 
 


Investors should be worried that customers who signed licensing or partnering deals with Tekmira appear 


unlikely to either pursue further commercial relationships or augment small commercial commitments.     





During the peak of the RNAi bubble (2005-2009), several major pharmaceutical companies signed 


licensing and collaboration deals with Tekmira to develop applications for the Company’s LNP delivery 


platform.  However, it is evident from the chart below that many such partners have since become 


disinterested in further collaboration.

Tekmira Pharmaceutical Corp. | Nasdaq: TKMR www.glaucusresearch.com 


In the irrational exuberance of 2009, Tekmira partnered with Roche and Alnylam for a Phase I clinical trial 


of a therapeutic for hypercholesterolemia.4  But Roche terminated the relationship following the premature 


termination of Tekmira’s first clinical trial of its LNP delivery technology in 2010, and Roche subsequently 


exited the entire RNAi space by selling its Wisconsin-based RNAi research assets to another competitor, 


Arrowhead Research.5 





Bristol-Myers Squibb, despite paying a few hundred thousand dollars per year to Tekmira, has so far 


refrained from increasing the scale of its de minimis financial commitment.  





By far Tekmira’s most significant collaborator, customer and partner since inception has been Alnylam. 


Some biotech commentators have described the relationship of the companies as an 8-year “marriage.”  


Alnylam was historically Tekmira's largest customer, accounting for $38mm (over 40%) of Tekmira's 


revenues from 2008-2013.  Following an acrimonious split, Tekmira sued Alnylam in 2011 for 


misappropriation of its RNAi intellectual property.   





In November 2012, Alnylam and Tekmira settled its on-going dispute, with Alnylam agreeing to pay 


Tekmira $65 million up front.  In exchange, Alnylam won the right to terminate its manufacturing 


agreement with Tekmira and amend a license to use Tekmira’s technology which had the effect of lowering 


the royalty and milestone payments to which Tekmira would be entitled in the event Alnylam’s therapeutic 


was successful.   





As evidenced by Alnylam’s current portfolio,6 Alnylam has made the conscious decision to terminate its 


relationship with Tekmira and develop its own proprietary LNP delivery platform, eliminating Alnylam’s 


reliance on Tekmira for the development of future therapeutics.7   





Although it is notoriously difficult to evaluate the prospects of complex biotechnology such as the LNP 


delivery platform marketed by Tekmira, there are short cuts.  It appears that larger pharmaceutical 


companies who sign collaboration deals with Tekmira either terminate such relationships (Roche, Alnylam) 


or are not sufficiently impressed to increase a tiny financial commitment (BSM).   





Tekmira’s former collaborators and partners had a clear financial incentive to participate in the development 


of a successful technology and a greater knowledge of the probability of such success than any investor.  


Investors could therefore infer that because such firms have all chosen to either terminate (or at the very 


least not expand) initial commitments to the Company, it would seem that industry experts do not assign 


Tekmira’s technology a high probability of commercial success.   





2) Department of Defense 
 


As of April 2014, Ebola had killed 1,700 people and infected only 2,500 since 1976.  The number of deaths 


has risen to roughly 10,000 (total) with the latest outbreak, with almost all of the fatalities limited to Sub-


Saharan Africa.  Given that experts admit that it is highly unlikely for Ebola spread in the United States or 


Europe, the commercial viability of Ebola drugs is thus limited.  Based on the impracticalities of TKM 


Ebola’s distribution mechanism (IV bags), in all likelihood the only customer for an approved TKM Ebola 


therapeutic is the U.S. government.

Tekmira Pharmaceutical Corp. | Nasdaq: TKMR www.glaucusresearch.com 


In 2010, Tekmira announced a $140 million contract with the Department of Defense (the “DoD”) to utilize 


its LNP technology in development of an Ebola treatment. In 2013, Tekmira claimed that this collaboration 


was “expanded” to incorporate new LNP technology. 





Although this contract has been Tekmira’s primary source of revenue since 2010, there is good reason to 


believe that this collaboration is not the coup that Tekmira claims it to be.  





First, it is misleading to characterize Tekmira’s collaboration with the DoD as a ‘$140’ million contract.  


Under the terms of the agreement, Tekmira was eligible to receive $34.7 million from 2010 through 2013.  


Thereafter, the DoD has an annual option to extend the contract.  If the DoD keeps extending the contract, 


the DoD has the authority but not the obligation to allocate up to $140 million towards TKM Ebola.  Just 


because the program gives the DoD the discretion to spend up to $140 million does not mean that Tekmira 


won a $140 million contract – at least not in the way that most investors, layman and bartenders think about 


contracts.  





The DoD chose to extend the contract (we believe on an annual basis) in both 2013 and 2014, but there is 


absolutely no guarantee that it will spend the remainder of the eligible amount on TKM Ebola.  The risk of 


early termination is real.  At the end of 2012, DoD threatened to cut the funding for TKM Ebola. Ultimately, 


it decided to continue, but continuing DoD commitment is by no means a certainty.   





Second, the government is also backing Tekmira’s competitors.  The DoD Threat Reduction Agency also 


provides funding for the development of ZMapp, BioCryst’s Brincidofovir,8 and a vaccine developed by 


Newlink.  Investors should not be fooled by Tekmira’s press releases, which seem to imply that the DoD 


has picked a winner in a crowded Ebola treatment field.

DELIVERY MECHANISM FOR TKM EBOLA COMMERCIALLY IMPRACTICAL 





Even if, in the unlikeliest of scenarios, TKM Ebola is approved for clinical development by the FDA, its 


adoption may be limited because its delivery mechanism is wildly impractical for distribution and use in 


Ebola target zones.  This limits the drug’s commercial viability and by extension, should temper the best-


case-scenario upside predicted by many Tekmira proponents. 





TKM Ebola is administered intravenously.  This presents a challenge in sub-Saharan African regions most 


at risk for Ebola outbreaks.  Such regions are underserved and characterized by the absence of remotely 


adequate medical infrastructure.     





Ebola has spread in countries such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Central African Republic, and the 


Democratic Republic of Congo who have few medical professionals and even fewer basic resources like 


gloves, masks and gowns, which are critical in protecting health care workers from infection.   





How likely is it that a facility without gloves, gowns and masks will have the resources and expertise to 


intravenously administer an IV therapeutic?  Administration of TKM Ebola requires careful dosage 


calibration from a trained professional.  In addition, the FDA has warned of a shortage of saline IV bags, 


meaning such bags will be even harder to obtain in Sub-Saharan Africa.  





Because of limited resources and medical expertise in Ebola-heavy regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, TKM 


Ebola’s IV delivery mechanism makes it unlikely to garner widespread adoption in the very part of the 


world it would be most likely to be administered.   





By contrast, Tekmira’s principal competitive threats other than ZMapp (Chimerix, Toyama and Biocryst) 


have delivery mechanisms much more suited to treating Ebola in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it matters 


most.  Chimerex’s Brincidofovir is an oral pill which can be stored at room temperature, making it far more 


desirable not only for manufacturing but also for delivery and administration to at-risk areas in sub-Saharan 


Africa.   





Drug Treatment and Therapy Administration Comparison 


Company Drug Name Treatment Administration 


Tekmira TKM-Ebola Bolus IV Infusion  


Sarepta AVI-7537 Bolus IV Infusion 


Mapp Boipharmaceutical ZMAPP Bolus IV Infusion 


Chimerix Brincidofovir Oral Pill 


Toyama Chemical Favipiravir (or T-705) Oral Pill 


Biocryst BCX4430 Intramuscular (IM) Injection  








The impracticality of administering TKM Ebola in regions lacking experienced medical personnel and basic 


resources undermines the commercial viability of the drug.  This is relevant to Tekmira investors because 


the Company’s current valuation implies both a statistical likelihood that TKM Ebola will be an approved 


and useful treatment for Ebola (an outcome that we consider entirely remote) but in the event of such 


approval, that TKM Ebola will be a widely disseminated and adopted technology to treat the disease.  We 


think not.

RNAi TECHNOLOGY UNPROVEN 





Most drugs fail.  A recent study published in Nature Biotechnology reported that the probability of FDA 


approval for drugs in Phase 1 of development was between 10-15%.9  Such a success rate would be the 


envy of RNAi biotechnology firms.  To date, not a single RNAi compound has successfully completed the 


FDA approval process to clinical development, despite billions in investment into the commercial 


application of RNAi therapeutics.  Tekmira’s RNAi based Ebola treatment is based on technology that is 


not only unproven, but has proved an overhyped wasteland of pharmaceutical investment since inception.  





DNA carries the genetic information of a cell, consisting of thousands of genes.  To create proteins, such 


genetic information is first transcribed into messenger RNA.  Once mRNA is transported outside the 


nucleus of a cell, the code in the RNA is translated into a protein.10   





RNA interference (“RNAi”) is a posttranscriptional process of regulating specific genes using small 


fragments of nucleic acid.  In theory, small molecules could be synthesized to inhibit the expression of 


proteins by causing the degradation (or inhibition) of specific messenger RNA molecules,11 preventing their 


translation.12  The promise of RNAi therapeutics is to attack the problem at its source by eliminating the 


creation of the very proteins that cause disease.13   





Following the landmark publication in 1998 by Fire and Mellow, which eventually landed the pair a 2006 


Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, research in RNAi technology moved quickly.  In 2001, Thomas 


Tuschl and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry published a seminal paper in Nature, 


cited over 9,000 times and counting, which reported the use of synthetic 21-nucleotie RNA duplexes to 


target and suppress specific genes.  This research ignited the commercial pursuit of RNAi drugs.   





From 2002 to 2005, small, adventurous biotechnology firms such as Tekmira (then named Protiva) and 


Alnylam leaped into the development of RNAi therapeutics.  Then, in a period from 2005 to 2008 defined 


by one commentator as an era of ‘irrational exuberance,’ big pharma invested $2.5-3.5 billion in the 


burgeoning field.14  Peak-RNAi, so to speak, was reached when Merck and Roche paid $1.1 billion for 


acquiring Sirna Therapeutics and $300 million for a limited platform license from Alnylam, respectively.  


Dollars invariably attracted speculative investments in a yet unproven science. 





In 2008, the walk of shame began.  Although big pharmaceutical companies had aggressively pursued 


intellectual property related to RNAi technology, a viable therapeutic proved elusive.  Setbacks, delays, 


negative clinical results and questions about the efficacy of basic RNAi therapeutics soon proved too much, 


and big pharmaceutical companies such as Roche, Pfizer, Merck and Abbott either divested or 


decommissioned in-house RNAi research capabilities.15   





The RNAi space has yet to recover.  From 2009-2012, pure-play RNAi therapeutics companies such as 


Tekmira generated a total of only $70-100 million in non-dilutive revenues (from licensing technologies

and platforms or from government contracts).  Compare this to the period from 2006-2009, when pure-play 


companies generated roughly $1 billion in non-dilutive revenues.16  





To date, not a single RNAi therapeutic compound has successfully navigated the FDA approval process 


into clinical development.17 Since the initial explosion of optimism, followed by a period of irrational 


exuberance, shoddy science and ill-advised investments, RNAi therapeutics have garnered a reputation as 


a wasteland of dollars and clinical disutility.  





Recently, there has been a limited recovery in the field and cause for tempered optimism.  Small NRAi 


molecules (“siRNA”) released directly into the bloodstream were degraded by enzymes and unable to  


penetrate cell membranes.  But some researchers, including Tekmira, have had limited success embedding 


siRNAs into lipid nanoparticles (“LNPs”).  Testing in animal models indicated that in some instances such 


particles successfully ended up in the liver.18  As a result, the bulk of promising RNAi drugs address 


diseases linked to the liver, including Tekmira’s Hepatitis-B therapeutic technology.     





The trouble is that Ebola infections do not specifically target cells in the liver.  Rather, an Ebola infection 


also targets endothelial cells (cells lining the blood vessels), macrophages and monocytes (types of immune 


cells) throughout the body.  The bio-distribution of Tekmira’s LNPs is focused towards the liver, making it 


an added challenge to address diseases that target cells in other organs.19   





It is not that TKM Ebola is certain to fail – it is just that it is highly, highly likely to fail.  And right now, 


Tekmira’s share price does not reflect the extremely low probability that TKM Ebola will be approved and 


adopted as a viable treatment.

VALUATION: A BRIEF HISTORY OF STUPIDITY 





Every so often, a small yet highly salient (and usually gruesome) threat emerges which, despite having a 


remote possibility of actually affecting a large number of people, captures our collective consciousness.   





Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, someone20 mailed deadly anthrax spores to NBC, the New 


York Post, and Sens Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy.  The attacks killed five people and induced a 


collective national hysteria.  Although deadly, the panic was disproportionate to the threat.  Anthrax is 


exceedingly difficult to weaponize, requiring advanced knowledge of biochemistry and sophisticated 


technology to grind the spores into small enough particles to infiltrate the lungs (where it can be deadly to 


humans).  Despite the very small possibility that Anthrax could ever present a threat to the general public, 


absolute panic ensued. 





One of the secondary (or even tertiary) effects of this delusional hysteria was that the stock price of 


companies with any connection to Anthrax soared.  The share price of one such company, Palatin 


Technologies (NASDAQ: PTN), increased dramatically when on November 1, 2001, the biopharmaceutical 


firm announced a collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Medical Center to “evaluate the clinical utility” 


of the company’s anthrax inhalation detector.  Investors seemed to abandon rationality, forgetting that the 


anthrax threat was overblown and that the presence of such a threat did not make Palatin’s unproven 


technology any more likely to succeed.  Predictably, the price of PTN’s stock collapsed when media hype 


regarding the Anthrax crises abated.   





The recent Ebola scare is strikingly similar.  In the United States, there have been nine confirmed diagnoses.  


One patient has died.  The survival rate is 80% outside of Africa, and will only improve as hospitals and 


physicians in the United States increase their understanding of Ebola’s pathology and become more 


practiced in available treatments.     








Even though Ebola is not particularly easy to transmit from person to person, stupidity regarding Ebola has 


afflicted most of the population.  A two-year college in Dallas recently denied admission to prospective 


students from Nigeria (a country who has to date reported roughly the same number of Ebola cases as the 


                                                             
20 Interestingly, the FBI never conclusively identified the culprit.

Year to date, Tekmira’s stock price is up over 100%, along with similarly massive gains in the price of shares of other 
Ebola companies such as CMRX (100%+ increase YTD) and BCRX (60%+ increase YTD).   


We believe that Tekmira is hugely overvalued and that its share price is poised to collapse.  RNAi technology is 
unproven, TKM Ebola’s Phase I trial was halted over safety concerns, and nothing since, including limited application to 
two patients under exigent circumstances makes it any more likely that TKM Ebola is safe, efficacious and thus likely to 
gain FDA approval.  In addition, there is evidence that treating physicians prefer other experimental treatments, and it 
appears that presumably due to concerns over TKM Ebola’s safety risks, Tekmira’s Ebola therapeutic is an experimental 
treatment of last resort.  We therefore believe that Tekmira should be valued at its pre-Ebola valuation, between $7-10 per 
share.
