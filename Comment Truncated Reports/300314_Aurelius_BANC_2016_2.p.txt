providing notice. The author encourages all readers to do their own
due diligence.


Summary


We believe that Banc of California (NYSE:BANC) deceived investors
in both its most recently �led 8-k with the SEC and public conference
call. Under the false guise of “Independence”, BANC hired Winston
& Strawn, defense counsel to both COR and Steven Sugarman
(personally) with leading the long-running and previously
undisclosed internal investigation into “potential impropriety”
involving COR, BANC executives, and Jason Galanis. In our opinion,
the company’s statements to investors concerning the independence
of the investigation are materially false and cast doubt on every
aspect of the company’s public statements regarding Jason Galanis.


We re-iterate our research conclusions which rely on publicly
obtained documents that indisputably demonstrate ties between
BANC’s senior leadership and Jason Galanis. While failing to address
the vast majority of our report, BANC has confused investors by mis-
characterizing the declaration of an FBI agent which merely
demonstrates that an unnamed COR Capital representative made
statements to the FBI denying ties to Galanis and entities he
controlled.


Numerous research �ndings directly contradict COR Capital’s
statement to the FBI as well as BANC’s contention that COR had no
“entanglements” with Galanis controlled entities. Undisclosed
litigation documents �led by the very �rm leading BANC’s
independent investigation show that Steven Sugarman’s COR made
a convertible debt investment in Burnham Financial alongside COR
Fund Advisors, an entity controlled by Galanis and named in BANC’s
retraction demand to Seeking Alpha.


We demand that Banc of California immediately retract its
censorship demands against Seeking Alpha and abandon its
attempts to infringe on our protected �rst amendment rights to
publish critical research opinions.

7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 3/13


We will soon release thousands of pages of our source materials at
www.bancexposed.com; we demand that BANC and Steven
Sugarman join our efforts in providing the disclosure and
documentation it has thus far failed to provide investors and
taxpayers.


Background


Earlier this week, we released a detailed research report that
exposed extensive and indisputable ties between Banc of California’s
leadership team and a notorious criminal, Jason Galanis. The myriad
of publicly sourced documents we shared in our report speak for
themselves and wholly support our research conclusions.


After our report was published, a lawyer representing Banc of
California, David L. Aronoff from Winston & Strawn LLP, sent a letter
to Seeking Alpha demanding an immediate retraction of our research
report. In the letter, Banc of California claimed that our report
purportedly contains “numerous false statements, lies and
fabrications” and threatened legal action. In making overt threats
against its critics, Banc of California has chosen to follow the failed
path of Gerova Financial, a NYSE-listed �nancial institution that
attempted to conceal a massive fraud by aggressively pursuing the
research �rm that exposed the company’s secret ties to Galanis.


BANC’s Purportedly “Independent” Investigation


The company has publicly stated in an SEC �ling that Winston &
Strawn is leading BANC’s previously secret “independent”
investigation into “potential impropriety” related to Galanis. The only
Winston & Strawn lawyer that has been publicly identi�ed is David L.
Aronoff, the attorney who sent the retraction demand to Seeking
Alpha.


Banc of Calfornia’s website speci�cally highlights Mr. Aronoff and
Winston & Strawn as an example of a California entrepreneur “who
we serve.” The pro�le of the purportedly independent Mr. Aronoff
calls Banc of California “my bank” and states that “I’m constantly
impressed with Banc of California.”

7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 4/13


On the company’s conference call, BANC’s General Counsel made
brief comments on Winston & Strawn’s ongoing independent
investigation initiated by unnamed Directors:


The Board of Directors determined to retain outside counsel to
independently investigate the matters raised and report any
information that might indicate the possible existence of any
potential impropriety. The results of that investigation, which has
continued over the course of more than a year, failed to disclose any
ownership interest by Galanis in the company or the Bank, and
a�rmatively con�rmed that he exercised no direct or indirect control
over the company or the Bank or any entity owned or a�liated with
Steven Sugarman or any other member of the Board of Directors.


In trumpeting the results of this purportedly independent
investigation, BANC also failed to disclose to investors that Mr.
Aronoff and Winston & Strawn have long acted as defense counsel
for both Steven Sugarman and COR. Mr. Aronoff, for example, is
currently representing COR Securities Holdings in a matter against
Burnham, a party to the internal investigation. He has also defended
Steven Sugarman personally against claims asserted by a judicially-
recognized whistleblower alleging that COR Clearing engaged in



http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/38682326-aurelius/4925647-banc-extensive-ties-notorious-fraudster-jason-galanis-make-shares-un-investible
7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 5/13


signi�cant anti-money laundering violations and that Steven
Sugarman allegedly engaged in “abusive behavior” towards the
whistleblower.


Mr. Aronoff also defended Sugarman family members against
previously undisclosed civil fraud allegations as well as attempts by
a civil receiver to recover alleged “net winnings” paid to the
Sugarman family from the Westmoore Ponzi scheme. In short, the
company has tasked Winston & Strawn, Steven Sugarman’s
personal legal defense �rm and a client of the bank, with
independently investigating Mr. Sugarman’s own conduct regarding
Galanis.


As a result, it comes as no surprise that, according to BANC’s
General counsel, Winston & Strawn has exonerated BANC’s
leadership of any wrongdoing thus far. In falsely presenting Winston
& Strawn’s investigation to investors as independent, we believe that
the company deceived investors in both its recent 8-k and its public
conference call. This, in our opinion, casts doubt on every aspect of
the company’s public statements regarding Jason Galanis.


Cases that Mr. Aronoff and Winston & Strawn have served as
counsel include:


1) Bussing v. COR Clearing (8:12-cv-00238-JMG-CRZ)


In 2014, Mr. Aronoff represented Steven Sugarman personally
against allegations made by a judicially-recognized whistleblower.


2) COR Securities Holdings, Inc V. Burnham Financial Group. Los
Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC 605755.

7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 6/13


Mr. Aronoff represented COR Securities Holdings in recent litigation
to recover its convertible investment in Burnham Financial. This
means that Mr. Aronoff was actively engaged in litigation with
parties his �rm was tasked with independently investigating. More
importantly, COR’s own lawsuit demonstrates that Steven
Sugarman’s �rm made an investment in Burnham Financial
alongside COR Fund Advisors, an entity controlled by Jason Galanis.


Mr. Aronoff’s assertion in BANC’s retraction demand that Galanis
entities, including Burnham, had no “entanglements” with COR are
rendered false by documents provided by Mr. Aronoff himself
pursuant to this case.


Furthermore, documents in the suit include a sworn declaration from
COR Clearing’s Carlos Salas (who also recently became BANC’s
undisclosed “Chief of Staff”) attesting to his knowledge of the
convertible note issued to Burnham.


3) David Gill v. et al 8:12-cv-02236-AG-JPR


In 2012, Mr. Aronoff defended Sugarman Family Partners LP (owned
by Steven Sugarman’s father) against attempts by the receiver to
collect “net winnings” that the Westmoore Ponzi Scheme allegedly
paid on Mr. Sugarman’s loan to Westmoore (the suit was settled in
late 2014).
7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 7/13


While neither Steven Sugarman or Jason Sugarman were named in
the Westmoore complaint or accused of any wrongdoing, we
discovered that Steven Sugarman has not disclosed that both he and
his wife held real estate licenses at Westmoore Realty. Westmoore
Realty is included as an entity subject to the Ponzi scheme
receivership efforts.


As part of the receiver’s litigation, Matthew Jennings, the head of the
ponzi scheme, made a 2014 court declaration. Discussing his
relationship with Jason Sugarman, Mr. Jennings states that “we were
so close that I named Jason Sugarman to the Board of Directors of at
least one Westmoore Company”.

4) Gottex Fund Management Ltd v. MKA (8:13-cv-00922-AG-JPR)


In 2013, Mr. Aronoff represented entities a�liated with MKA Capital
as well as Jason & Elizabeth Sugarman against civil fraud
allegations.


We Reiterate Our Research Conclusion That Jason Galanis Gained
Control Of COR


BANC has failed to address the vast majority of our research report.
We believe that is because the ties between BANC’s senior-most
o�cers and board members and Jason Galanis are indisputable and
evidenced by documents that speak for themselves.


In recent days, BANC has mis-characterized a short section of an FBI
agent’s lengthy declaration made pursuant to the tribal bond criminal
indictment. BANC’s attorneys have used this text to confuse
investors in an attempt to refute our research conclusion that Jason
Galanis gained control of COR.


In BANC’s retraction demand, David L. Aronoff, claims that his
undisclosed client, COR, “had no involvement with the allegations
surrounding Jason Galanis.” In support of this, Mr. Aronoff highlights
the following two paragraphs of the FBI agent’s declaration:


40. Based on my conversations with a representative of COR
Capital, I have learned that, contrary to the representations made in



https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/file/777856/download
7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 9/13


the June 3, 2014 email sent by JASON GALANIS, the defendant, to
MICHELLE MORTON, the defendant, (referenced in paragraph 39c
above), Burnham, CORFA and Wealth-Assurance AG were not
a�liates of COR Capital.


41. Based on my review of documents, I have learned that on June 3,
2014, JASON GALANIS, the defendant, sent an email to BEVAN
COONEY, the defendant, which forwarded the email JASON GALANIS
sent to MICHELLE MORTON, the defendant, earlier that same day,
attaching the description of COR Capital which fraudulently asserted
that certain entities were a�liates of COR Capital. In JASON
GALANIS’S email to COONEY, JASON GALANIS wrote “whoring it out
shamelessly[.] thank you [�rst name of COR Capital representative.]”


BANC contends that this section “clari�es that Galanis had in fact
lied about his connection to COR Capital, and that no such
entanglements actually existed.” The problem with Mr. Aronoff and
BANC’s logic is that the FBI agent clearly states that his declaration
is based on a conversation with a representative with COR Capital.


In our opinion, this text merely demonstrates that an unnamed COR
Capital representative made statements to the FBI denying ties to
Galanis and entities he controlled. Given that Mr. Aronoff is COR’s
counsel, we believe his use of COR’s comments to refute our
conclusions render the bank’s response meaningless and act to
further highlight the con�icts of interest in the independent
investigation.


COR Capital’s conversation with the FBI directly contradicts the
documented facts presented in our report. For example, the COR
representative’s contention that Wealth-Assurance AG (Valor’s
primary subsidiary) was not an a�liate of COR Capital is wholly
refuted by numerous data points:


Wealth Assurance AG’s current website includes a press
release naming COR Capital as its owner;


COR’s deleted website speci�cally named Wealth-Assurance
AG as a company that COR was a principal investor;


Valor, the parent company of Wealth-Assurance AG, lists COR
as its owner in a company factsheet;

7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 10/13


Valorlife’s website, a Valor subsidiary, currently lists COR as
its owner on its current website;


Valor was incorporated by Hugh Dunkerley while he was an
executive at COR;


An SEC �lings names Jason Sugarman (a paid BANC
consultant) as the “Founder, Chairman & CEO of Valor.” Mr.
Sugarman’s Linkedin Pro�le has been deleted and his
biography at Merriman Capital has recently been password
protected;


Mr. Sugarman’s fellow Valor board member is Rory Knight,
who was a former Gerova Financial board member. Mr.
Knight has been deleted from Valor’s website.


Both the FBI and SEC depict Valor as being integral to the
Tribal bonds fraud and controlled by Galanis.


As a result, we continue to question how Jason Galanis could control
an offshore insurance company, Valor, that was simultaneously owned
by COR and managed by Jason Sugarman?


Our analysis of the facts continues to be that Jason Galanis
controlled COR.


If BANC wants to contest this conclusion further, it should simply
provide transparency to investors by releasing the supporting
documentation that we demand below. Provided that unnamed
“disinterested” board members have spent over a year investigating
these matters, documentation should be easily accomodated.


We Demand that Banc of California Joins Us In Releasing
Documents To Investors And Taxpayers


In its SEC �led 8-k dated October 18th, Banc of California announced
that the board had already “been aware of matters relating to Jason
Galanis” and that “Disinterested Directors” had “immediately initiated
a thorough independent investigation” that remains ongoing. In brief
comments on the call, BANC’s general counsel stated that the
investigation began in 2015, which means that the company
concealed an obviously material internal investigation into
associations with a convicted fraudster for roughly a year. When

speci�cally asked, Steven Sugarman failed to even name the
supposedly “disinterested” directors involved in the investigation. In
fact, BANC provided investors with almost no explanatory disclosure
and dismissed legitimate analyst questions for transparency with the
General Counsel’s refrain of “We will not discuss Galanis.”


Our research conclusions are supported by hundreds, if not
thousands, of publicly obtained documents. By contrast, the
company publicly declared us liars while simultaneously refusing to
provide even basic disclosure regarding its long-running and
“thorough” internal Galanis investigation to its investors. As a heavily
regulated and taxpayer guaranteed �nancial institution, this is simply
unacceptable.


That is why we will soon be releasing thousands of pages of our
source materials to the public. We will post these publicly obtained
documents on www.bancexposed.com on Monday, October 24th. We
believe these documents contain additional research �ndings, and
we invite investors to download our source materials and come to
their own conclusions.


Similarly, we demand that the bank and Steven Sugarman publicly
release documents and disclosures to back up the bank’s claims and
offer transparency to investors and taxpayers. Given that BANC has
been investigating these matters for roughly a year, our requests
should be easily accomodated.


Below is a list of requested documents, questions, and disclosures:


Attestations from all of BANC’s senior o�cers and directors
a�rmatively describing any meetings or communications
with Jason Galanis, John Galanis, and/or their indicted
associates.


Attestations from all senior o�cers and directors regarding
their awareness of Jason Galanis and Hugh Dunkerley’s
claimed physical presence inside the same building as
BANC’s headquarters.


The date BANC was made aware of potential ties to Galanis
and the date BANC initiated the independent investigation.


The names of each “disinterested” board member.

7/10/2019 BANC: Our Response - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-our-response/ 12/13


How BANC made the determination that Winston & Strawn
was independent.


We also encourage Winston & Strawn to contact the SEC’s
staff to advise it of that law �rm’s interpretation of the word
“independent” as re�ected in the recent BANC �ling with the
SEC. This would be an important point for the SEC staff to
know since it is at variance with the use of the word
“independent” by other speakers of the English language.


Any interim or �nal reports made pursuant BANC’s internal
investigation of “potential impropriety” related to Galanis.


Have BANC, COR, and a�liated persons received subpoenas
or informal requests for documents or testimony from any
federal regulatory or law enforcement agency? If so, what
speci�c documents did BANC and COR provide and who has
given testimony?


An ownership chart naming the portfolio companies owned
by COR Capital and its a�liates.


All documentation pertaining to COR Capital (and its
a�liates) relationship with Valor Group, Wealth Assurance
AG, and Thorsdale.


An explanation as to why COR Capital has deleted its
websites.


An ownership list of all bene�cial owners of COR Capital and
its a�liates.


A full list of all bene�cial debt and equity holders of CS
Financial prior to BANC’s formal acquisition.


A list of all loans and/or investments made by Camden
Capital to BANC insiders, a�liates, and Jason Galanis. Have
these activities been disclosed to regulators?


Disclosure: I am/we are short BANC.
