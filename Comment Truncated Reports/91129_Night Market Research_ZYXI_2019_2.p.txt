Summary


ZYXI


Revenue growth masks deteriorating profitability: operating margins trend lower
(64% lower past two years) as Zynex accelerates hiring in face of early signs of
reimbursement pressure.


Tricare becomes first large health plan since Medicare to drop ZYXI’s device for
one of its largest indications citing poor efficacy - we expect other payors to follow.


Zynex routinely waives deductibles and copays, a practice prohibited by Medicare
and which likely violates insurance law pertaining to commercial payors constituting
breach of contract.


We have been in contact with commercial and government investigators examining
ZYXI claims, including the Department of Insurance of large state investigating after
an insurance company reported Zynex’s billing.


Analysts mistake Zynex as a Medical Technology company. It’s actually a DME
supplier - appropriate multiples would value the stock >80% lower before reflecting
the risks we have identified.

A Deeper Look Reveals New Concerns and Adds To Our
Conviction


Zynex (NASDAQ:ZYXI) shares are up 150% year to date vs the Health Care Select
SPDR ETF (XLV) at -2%. We believe ZYXI's outperformance is a function of retail
investor complacency combined with sell-side analyst carelessness and leaves the
stock extremely vulnerable to a major repricing lower.


In our previous report, we presented a bearish thesis predicated on two main points in
context with valuation. First, Zynex sells generic commodities at prices multiples above
market levels. Second, we were unable to reconcile ZYXI's revenue per device with
government payer reimbursement rates.


Since then, we took a much more comprehensive review of the company. Over several
months, we interviewed former employees, customers, and competitors. We consulted
healthcare lawyers and reimbursement consultants and spoke with investigators at
insurance companies and government agencies.


The bull case rests on several key assumptions. Revenue growth continues for years in
a largely untapped total addressable market. Margins expand after Zynex hires a full
sales force. Competition won't impact market share gains in a meaningful way. A new
device is technologically innovative and anticipated to successfully launch. And most
importantly, commercial insurer reimbursement rates for 9-volt batteries and electrodes
remain stable.


In our view, each point is flimsy, but when combined, the case becomes wholly
unsupportable. And in context of the most significant risks and Zynex's all-time high
valuation, the setup for investors is precarious. As a result of our research, we now
believe the value of the business is near zero, and the most probable outcome for
shareholders is near total losses. We have identified troubling issues that raise
immediate concerns regarding the fundamental and legal structure of the business:


An apparent lack of management transparency or awareness of financial details as
CEO maintains that revenue mix and reimbursements have been consistent for
years, contradicting financial statements which show a major, unexplained shift
beginning in 2017.

8/8/22, 9:17 PM Zynex _ Deteriorating Fundamentals And Signs Of Reimbursement Pressure (NASDAQ _ ZYXI) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352747-zynex-deteriorating-fundamentals-and-signs-of-reimbursement-pressure?source=all_articles_title 3/35


Supplies revenue per order nonsensically increased by ~400% in 2017, allowing
Zynex to reach profitability, but is now reverting to previous loss-making levels.
Revenue per order is down ~30% in the last two years, and we see signs of
reimbursement pressure going forward.


Zynex is totally reliant on supplies resales. In particular, we estimate electrode
resales alone account for ~50% of revenues and gross profits, highlighting the
absurdity of the business model and how exposed ZYXI is to any change in
reimbursement on this single commoditized product.


Zynex is accelerating hiring (SG&A on pace to be up ~400% vs three years ago)
while revenue per order is declining, and as a result, operating margins have
collapsed 64% from peak to lowest level in three years.


Zynex provides minimal disclosure on three products which may account for up to
20% of EBITDA. One product (back brace manufactured by Aspen) faces
reimbursement cuts next year, which could materially affect earnings.


Zynex recently expanded into medical equipment dropshipping, a business with
extremely thin margins. The company touted the announcement on social media
causing the stock to rally 10% before the actual press release.


Besides NexWave, every Zynex-manufactured product has been an unambiguous
failure. Zynex is touting a new device it calls a "Blood Volume Monitor", and we
expect it to follow due to woefully inadequate data and management's
inexperience.


Zynex routinely waives deductibles and copays, a policy which likely violates
contracts with payors who can sue for breach, stop paying claims and attempt to
recoup past payments.


Since October 2019, Zynex has reported continued growth in orders and revenues,
which isn't surprising as the company has almost tripled its salesforce in the last two
years, adding a net 15 sales reps per month this year alone. Retail has been drawn in
by this growth story, but actively-managed institutional ownership remains negligible. In
fact, no institution, actively managed money or not, has owned more than 5% of shares
since 2011.

Parasitic Business Model


In reality, Zynex is a parasitic business gouging insurers (and consumers), acting under
the pretense of helping in the fight against the opioid epidemic. We see similarities to
Philidor in Zynex's minimal R&D, monthly prescription auto-renewals, and routine
copay waivers.


Most troubling for Zynex in the near term is early signs of payors questioning
reimbursements. In Q1 20, gross margins fell below 80% for the first time since Q1 17,
due to lower reimbursement from commercial payors. We believe this is only the
beginning of payor pressure for several reasons. TRICARE's negative coverage
decision puts TENS units under a spotlight. Commercial insurers and state regulators
are paying more attention to Zynex, in part because of our allegations. At the same time,
Zynex revenues are becoming too substantial (consensus 2020 revenues are $80mn),
for health plans to ignore. We've heard from bulls who own Zynex in part because they
believe regulators and insurers have bigger issues to worry about, that Zynex is
inconsequential and can stay under the radar even if they are price gouging insurers.
We believe this view is shockingly complacent.


In this report, we examine additional irregular trends in revenues and inconsistencies in
management's attempt to rationalize them. We look at a recently public comparable
trading with an EBITDA multiple 80% below ZYXI despite equivalent net margins, highly
respected management and a credible business model. We disclose that several
commercial and government investigators, in response to our concerns, are examining
ZYXI claims, including the Department of Insurance of a large state. We also discuss
factors contributing to the stock's mispricing and present a valuation based on
comparative multiples and DCF which prices the stock at least 70% lower.


A copy of this report has been sent to commercial insurance companies and state
insurance regulators.


Zynex sells the NexWave, an unpatented transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS) device for the treatment of pain. TENS units are based on archaic technology
and commonly available over the counter. NexWave is not significantly different from
OTC devices, but it requires a prescription which allows Zynex to claim medical
necessity and - most importantly - bill insurance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352747-zynex-deteriorating-fundamentals-and-signs-of-reimbursement-pressure?source=all_articles_title 5/35


NexWave sales make up approximately 15-20% of ZYXI's revenue. Resales of the
supplies used with the device - 9-volt alkaline batteries and cloth electrodes - account
for 80%. Last year, Zynex collected $35mn on battery and electrode resales at roughly
90% gross margins (we estimate ZYXI collects ~10x prices for exact same product sold
at retail). The ability to bill captive and relatively price insensitive insurance companies
has allowed Zynex to distribute commoditized goods at prices wildly above market rates.
Similarly, Valeant and Philidor created an insurance-subsidized artificial market for
absurdly expensive branded drugs. Both business models are only viable if insurance is
paying and reimbursement is firm.

Zynex calls itself an "innovative medical device company" (beginning of every press
release), but it spends a negligible amount on research and development, an average of
$330k per year since 2007. R&D is so insignificant at Zynex that it's not even itemized
on income statements, unlike every medical device company in Exhibit 2. Zynex
operates as a supplies distributor in every respect yet realizes gross margins
above the most innovative names in the Medical Technology sector. We fail to see
how this model is sustainable over the long term.

CEO's Attempt to Explain Revenue Shift Contradicts
Financials


Source: Financial statements


Before we discuss our new findings, we mention a critical issue which management has
failed to adequately address, and which raises concerns around management
transparency and credibility.


Recall Zynex reports revenues in two segments: device (NexWave) and supplies
(batteries and electrodes). Between 2009 and 2016, supplies averaged 40% of total
revenues but then jumped to 80% starting in 2017. After we made this point in our
previous report, CEO Thomas Sandgaard claimed it was due to an accounting change
during the Q3 19 earnings call:


The split between device revenue and supplies revenue has always been fairly
consistent over the past couple of decades. If you look at historical results and
comparing those results, please keep in mind that we've reclassified our device and
supplies allocations beginning in 2018, and those reclassifications were pushed back
into the 2017 numbers, but not to any periods prior to 2017… [Reimbursement] has
been fairly consistent over the past 24 years.


However, Sandgaard's explanation is contradicted by the 2017 10-K, before the
reclassifications in 2018. As shown below, supplies as a portion of total revenues
doubled from 2016 to 2017.


Exhibit 3. Revenue shift occurred before 2018 reclassification

Profitability Declining As Nonsensical Revenue Shows Signs
of Reversal


Source: Financial statements


Zynex has not responded to requests for comment. As we discuss below, supplies
revenue (particularly one product) underpins the entire business, and it's concerning that
management appears less than fully transparent or unaware of an issue so important
and easily verifiable.


For this report, we took a closer look at the composition of revenues and find signs that
Zynex's business is regressing. Between 2008 and 2016, revenue divided by total
orders averaged $620, then suddenly increased to $1.4k in 2017. Note these figures are
only approximations as revenue typically lags by a quarter or so due to order processing
times, but the trend is what's interesting and important (Exhibit 4).


Exhibit 4. Revenues per order doubled in 2017

Source: Financial statements


Looking at each segment, average device revenues fell 40%, but the average for
supplies increased over 400%, spiking in 2017.


Exhibit 5. Revenue per order fell for device but increased sharply for supplies

Source: Financial statements


We know supplies doubled as a percent of total revenues, but here, we see revenue per
order for each category moved in opposite directions. Reimbursement for each
NexWave fell, but the increase in supplies has more than made up for it, revealing how
dependent ZYXI is on supplies resales.


Zynex doesn't disclose how supplies revenue is split between batteries and electrodes,
but in a one-on-one conversation, management told us the current split is roughly 35%
and 65%, respectively. This would mean ZYXI resold about $22.6mn of electrodes last
year. Electrode resales account for roughly half of Zynex's revenue.


It is not clear what caused the spike in supplies reimbursements. In its 2017 press
releases and financial statements, management generally attributed an increase in
overall revenue to "improvements in cash collections as a result of improved billing
efforts."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352747-zynex-deteriorating-fundamentals-and-signs-of-reimbursement-pressure?source=all_articles_title 10/35


We doubt better collections alone could result in such a big increase in supplies revenue
since collections were apparently consistent for the previous nine years. Besides, if
collections improved so much, why did revenue for NexWave drop? Also, recall that
Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services severely cut reimbursement for TENS
units and supplies between 2015 and 2017 as part of the Competitive Bidding program
(CBP). Afterwards Medicare payments on TENS units fell from approximately $400 to
$65 and from $32 to $10 on a monthly pack of supplies (which includes batteries and
electrodes) [Pg. 44]. We would not expect commercial insurers to in turn increase rates,
especially on supplies. Zynex has not responded to multiple requests for comment.


Exhibit 6. Medicare supplies rate per patient fell by 70% yet Zynex monthly
supplies revenue up 4-5x


Source: Financial statements


This leap in supplies revenue was crucial to Zynex's survival. The company was in
default of a credit facility and Zynex shares had not closed above $1 since 2010, trading
as low as $0.10 in 2016. The influx of supplies revenue allowed Zynex to reach
profitability and pay off its lender.

Exhibit 7. Zynex completely dependent on large increase in battery/electrode
reimbursement


Source: Financial statements


However, in our view, the period before 2017 represents the natural state of ZYXI's
business, and the anomaly seen that year is reversing (Exhibit 7). It's possible Zynex
experienced a surge of new patients covered by an insurer who temporarily allowed a
greater quantity of supplies per patient. If so, that grouping of higher margin patients is
being diluted by patients covered by payors with typical coverage policies. Or maybe
Zynex found a weakness in a large payor's reimbursement policies which has been
fixed.


In any case, this batch of abnormally high reimbursement appears to be running off.
Margins have narrowed, and we expect they will eventually move to levels seen before
2017. Reselling batteries and electrodes is unlikely to be a high margin, large scale
business in the long term, in our view. Anyone skeptical should ask themselves why no
other company has made a meaningful effort in the TENS business since 2015.

Even more concerning is the average revenue decline is occurring, while Zynex is on a
hiring spree. So far, this year Zynex has added 100 sales reps after attrition (60%
increase) and will add another 100 before year end with a goal of 400 total. SG&A is on
track to be up >5x this year vs 2017. This is hitting profitability - operating margins,
which in the first quarter fell below 20% for the first time in three years, are 36%
lower since our first report and 64% off the 2017 peak.


We note the large increase in supplies revenue in 2017 occurred at a time of
management disorder. Zynex was required to disclose material internal weaknesses
during this period:


Sandgaard was the only member of BOD after he requested the resignation of the
other four members in 2014. He remained sole director until January 2018.


Sandgaard assumed the role of CFO between October 2015 and June 2017, after
the previous CFO was "discontinued".


From the 2016 10-K [Pg. 18]:


As previously reported and not remediated as of and during the year ended
December 31, 2016, we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting (ICFR) as we do not currently have an independent audit
committee overseeing our internal controls, or an independent member of our Board.
In addition, we have material weaknesses due to a lack of segregation of duties
within our accounting and approval process.

deficiencies

TRICARE Concludes TENS Ineffective For Lower Back Pain,
Will No Longer Cover - Can Other Payors Be Far Behind?


Source: Financial statements


TRICARE, the health plan for military members, retirees and their families, recently
decided to stop covering TENS units for lower-back pain beginning June 1, 2020.
TRICARE based its decision on studies by the Defense Department, American College
of Physicians, and Department of Veterans Affairs which found "insufficient evidence" to
support the efficacy of TENS therapy as a treatment for lower-back pain. From the
above linked article:


"Additionally, reliable evidence in published medical literature increasingly finds that
TENS for lower back pain is no more effective than sham TENS (placebo)," a Tricare
official said via email.


Recall Medicare stopped covering TENS for lower-back pain in 2012 as it also found
clinical evidence was lacking. After extensive review, Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) stated:

Shades of Philidor: Focus on Maximizing Insurance
Reimbursement Not Patient Needs


TENS is not reasonable and necessary for the treatment of CLBP… We in fact found
that sham (placebo) TENS produces equivalent analgesia to active TENS... While we
agree that the apparent patient risks are low, we do not believe that outweighs the
direction of the evidence base considered as a whole - that TENS does not improve
health outcomes and therefore should be noncovered.


Zynex does not disclose how much revenue is tied to TRICARE patients, but in addition
to the negative impact on ZYXI profitability, the signal this sends to commercial payors
and worker's compensation plans is ominous, for one of the most prevalent
musculoskeletal disorders. According to a review by St Sauver et al. (2013), back
problems are the third most common reason for doctor's office visits. What's especially
alarming is how unequivocal TRICARE is in concluding TENS therapy is ineffective. See
also the extensive research done by CMS in reaching the same conclusion. It would not
be surprising to see other payors follow suit.


Unique to companies whose primary source of revenue is insurance companies, is that
as revenues rise, so does the risk that your business model - products, quantities, prices
- will be scrutinized. This is especially so if your products provide low value relative to
cost, or if you are distributing generics as were Valeant and Philidor and now Zynex.


We believe Zynex's model shares several characteristics with Philidor/Valeant. Philidor,
the infamous specialty pharmacy Valeant used as a channel to inflate revenues, was
criticized for using aggressive tactics to maximize volume and reimbursement on
several medications.


For instance, Philidor repeatedly submitted unwanted or unnecessary prescription
renewals to boost sales on drugs with generic alternatives. Zynex is incentivized to do
the same, but with generic batteries and electrodes. On the Q3 19 earnings call,
Sandgaard admitted to auto-renewing monthly supplies shipments to NexWave
users, regardless of need and without checking with patients:

Shades of Philidor: Medical Equipment Distributed by Zynex
is Only 5% of Revenues But Likely Outsized Earnings
Contributor


Analyst: "Can you remind us, is there a standard kind of quantity and cadence of
supplies that patients usually receive? And then, piggybacking on that, is there a
process for patients to either request more or less supplies? What percentage of
patients actually vary from that standard quantity?"


Sandgaard: "…it's really up to the individual insurance company and how they allow,
how many supplies they allow for the patients. Some insurance companies have
rules in there where we need to check with the patient every three months, and then
we can continue if we get a confirmation. So, it's really all regulated by the insurance
companies, and they obviously get an initial amount of supplies when we ship the
device, and from there on out, it's really what kind of quantities that the insurance
company allows."


Key to the auto-distribution strategy is ZYXI's choice of disposable rather than
rechargeable batteries since the goal is to bill for as many units as possible. We
estimate Zynex is reimbursed approximately $10 per battery. The same battery is
available at retail for $1.35, or less with volume discounts.


Evidence of over-shipments can be found on eBay where thousands of unused Zynex-
labeled electrodes are listed. And this doesn't account for completed offerings -
thousands more were sold in just the last three months in 80+ listings. Battery listings
are more difficult to spot since Zynex stopped reselling private-labeled Rayovac 9V
batteries, opting instead to resell the batteries in the original Rayovac packaging. Zynex
has not responded to request for comment.


Not only are the products egregiously priced, but Zynex is also apparently forcing
excessive quantities through the system. How long before insurers step in, especially as
revenues grow?

Shades of Philidor: Zynex Routinely Waives Deductibles and
Copay - Potentially Fraud, Likely Breach of Contract


In a 2017 press release titled "Zynex Continues Fight Against Opioid Abuse and
Expands Its Arsenal of Pain Relief Products", the company announced it would start
offering back braces, hot/cold therapy and cervical traction. Similar to its battery and
electrode segment, ZYXI does not manufacture any of these products - it
purchases them from manufacturers, distributes them to patients and bills
insurance - the standard durable medical equipment (DME) supplier model.


Source: Financial statements, CMS


The back brace Zynex distributes is the Aspen Horizon 637 LSO. As is common among
"prescription" braces, its name includes the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
System (HCPCS) code suppliers use to bill insurance. Manufactured by Aspen Medical
Products, the Horizon 637 can be found online for around $100, but reimbursement fees
range from $1050 to $1400. With such large margins, the back brace industry (and
durable medical equipment in general) is a common target of insurance fraud.


Zynex does not specify how much revenue is generated from these products, but CFO
Dan Moorehead told us the total is around 5%. If so, Zynex distributed approximately
$2.3mn of this equipment in 2019. Given the extremely wide margins, these
products - for which Zynex provides minimal disclosure - may have accounted for
up to 20% of 2019 EBITDA.


We note that another round of Competitive Bidding will take effect in 2021, and back
braces are included for the first time, cutting reimbursement for a potentially significant
ZYXI earnings contributor. The lack of disclosure here is concerning as any change in
reimbursement would have a relatively large effect on overall profitability.

Insurers use copays (deductibles and copayments) as a form of cost-sharing to
incentivize patients to consider cost thereby curbing overutilization. Copay assistance
refers to manufacturer sponsored programs that limit these out of pocket costs. Since
these programs can steer patients towards higher priced drugs or equipment instead of
cheaper alternatives, their use receives regulator and payor scrutiny. See Valeant for
instance, which at its peak was spending almost 10% of revenue on copay assistance.
CEO Michael Pearson was eventually forced to explain Valeant's use of copay programs
in front of Congress. The following is an exchange with Senator Elizabeth Warren:


Warren: "Well, let me ask you a question in a different direction. Why don't you use
these co-pay reduction programs with federal government programs like Medicare
and Medicaid?"


Pearson: "Um, my understanding is we are not allowed to."


"Yup," responded Warren. "Because it's illegal. And that is exactly the problem here.
These programs are illegal because Medicare and Medicaid understand that the
programs are scams to hide the true cost of the products from the consumers and
drive up the costs for all of the taxpayers."


Federal law considers copay assistance to Medicare patients to be fraud unless in rare
instances of a patient's financial hardship. Specifically copay programs violate Anti-
Kickback Statutes by offering remuneration to induce individuals to purchase medical
care at taxpayer expense [Pg. 22], and the False Claims Act by misstating usual,
customary or reasonable charges.


We have learned that Zynex routinely waives deductibles and copayments for
both in- and out-of-network patients. We have no evidence that Zynex does so with
Medicare covered patients, but several current employees told us it is company
policy to avoid billing commercially insured patients for any amount as long as
Zynex is reimbursed at least $250 per NexWave.


Patients who receive a NexWave prescription assign their insurance benefits to Zynex
allowing Zynex to send claims to payors. If a payor refuses coverage, Zynex directly bills
patients a monthly $25 "rental fee". If NexWave is covered, Zynex continues to submit
monthly claims:

NexWave purchase at $1,995 or


NexWave rental at $369 per month


Each pack of electrodes (2 pairs) at $99


Each battery at $9.99


For patients with an unmet deductible, Zynex will bill insurance until it's met and as long
as they eventually collect $250, Zynex will not ask for payment from patients to
cover deductibles nor will it attempt to collect any payor mandated copays. Not
bothering patients with copays makes it much easier for Zynex to send recurring
monthly shipments of batteries and electrodes and then collect from insurance at prices
multiples above retail.


As with Medicare patients, the problem is that by accepting payment from insurers net of
copay as payment in full, but then accepting a higher reimbursement for patients with
lesser or no copays, Zynex is misrepresenting its actual charge. In other words, Zynex is
filing false claims.


A close acquaintance was recently prescribed NexWave. With his permission, we called
Zynex customer service posing as him, using his account number, date of birth and
address. Several Zynex reps told us on separate phone calls that even though there
was over $800 in unmet deductible, he would not be responsible for any payment since
his insurance would reimburse at amounts large enough to meet the deductible and
copays and still leave Zynex adequately compensated. The reps told us this was routine
practice.


While federal law prohibits copay assistance for public payor patients, the law as it
applies to commercial insurance varies between states. Certain states like Colorado,
Texas and Florida have statutes that prohibit waiving copayments unless in
circumstances of financial hardship.


New York Department of Insurance states that routine waiving of co-insurance may be
"fraud":


If a health care provider, as a general business practice, waives otherwise required
co-insurance requirements, that provider may be guilty of insurance fraud.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352747-zynex-deteriorating-fundamentals-and-signs-of-reimbursement-pressure?source=all_articles_title 19/35


Colorado law specifically states that routine waiver of copayment is illegal:


Business practices that have the effect of eliminating the need for actual payment by
the recipient of health care of required copayments and deductibles in health benefit
plans interfere with contractual obligations entered into between the insured and the
insurer relating to such payments;... the general assembly declares that such
business practices are illegal…


The following is a good legal summary of the issues and legality of patient assistant
programs as it applies to commercial payors (h/t Bronte Capital):


Private insurers and the courts are not generally alarmed by occasional
accommodations for individual patients with documented financial limitations.
However, insurance carriers have successfully challenged the routine waiver of
copayment obligations in the courts on numerous occasions.


Courts dealing with challenges to discounts of copayment obligations have been
concerned with two basic issues. First, a provider who discounts established fees for
some patients but not others, without a valid distinction for the differing treatment, can
be subject to claims of false billing by a party not receiving the discount or
consideration, including claims by insurance carriers. Second, the routine waiver of
patient copayment amounts can be viewed as breach of contract. Almost without
exception, insurers impose a contractual duty on providers to make a reasonable
effort to collect applicable copayment amounts from patients, and benefits are only
available when the charge for the service submitted by the provider is the actual, and
the usual, reasonable and customary charge (URC). The reasoning in these cases is
that the uniform discounting or waiver of patients' copayment portion of a provider's
fee evidences that the provider really only intends to collect that portion of the fee that
is not discounted, making it improper to claim that the fee is the full undiscounted fee.


We spoke with several healthcare attorneys and reimbursement consultants. All agreed
it would be surprising if commercial insurers would not find Zynex in breach of contract if
made aware of the waivers.

There Will Not Be Blood: New Device Unlikely to Sell


We found numerous examples of case law. Aetna successfully argued a provider
committed insurance fraud by waiving copayments and failing to disclose (Aetna Health,
Inc. v. Carabasi Chiropractic, 2006). Aetna recently won a $37.4mn judgement against a
provider group in part for routinely waiving copayments (Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Bay
Area Surgical Management LLC, 2016). Blue Cross successfully claimed providers
violated contracts by failing to charge patients for coinsurances (Pennsylvania
Chiropractic Association v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, 2011).


The financial implications are considerable. Insurance companies could find ZYXI
in breach of contract, refuse to reimburse claims and attempt to recover past
payments. We emailed Zynex for comment, and asked questions including what
percentage of patients receive copay assistance, how much is spent on it and what if
any disclosure is provided to insurers. Zynex has not responded. Analysts would do
investors a service by asking such questions on the next call.


One former employee told us Zynex frequently uses the back brace to "bust
deductibles". According to her, salespeople are encouraged to promote brace
prescriptions in conjunction with NexWave, since the $1,000+ brace reimbursement can
instantly fill a deductible, allowing Zynex to pocket all reimbursement for NexWave and
supplies for very little upfront cost.

In late February, Zynex announced FDA clearance of its CM-1500 "Blood Volume
Monitor". Sandgaard has promoted a TAM of $3bn (20 units in 5,000 hospitals at $30k).
We think this is a wild exaggeration of the market and belies the actual technology and
usefulness of the device. We believe the device will follow a path similar to that of every
other device ZYXI has touted in the past and end up as a failure.


The CM-1500 has been in development since 2011. First filed under the 510(K) pathway
in 2015, it took over four years to receive clearance from the FDA. We suspect one of
the reasons it took so long was that FDA took issue with certain efficacy and marketing
claims. Zynex was originally calling the CM-1500 a "Blood Volume Monitor" as shown on
the webpage from 2018 but the current page refers to it as a "Cardiac Monitor".


Note another significant change in language - the prior page stated, "indicate fluid
balance or blood loss in the OR and potential internal bleeding in the Recovery Room".
The current page never mentions the words fluid or blood, instead focusing on cardiac
monitoring. On the Q2 19 earnings call Sandgaard is asked to comment on FDA's
outstanding questions and he hints that claims and phrasing were issues:


So, recently, we have submitted a response that should be aligned nearly word-for-
word with their suggestions as to how we should phrase things, so with a bit of luck,
the next response, they don't have any further questions or suggestions to us, and
else, we'll just keep answering the questions.


We also note the CM-1500 was cleared by the cardiovascular review panel and
classified as a Plethysmograph, Impedance device (electrical impedance
plethysmography is old technology - see this paper from 1950 discussing its
usefulness). Compare this to Daxor (DXR) which is marketing a blood volume monitor
called the BVA-100, cleared by the FDA's Hematology panel and classified as a Blood
Volume Measuring device.

The CM-1500 combines several basic physiological measurements such as heart rate
and skin temperature into a numerical index, changes in which are supposed to inform
clinicians of blood loss. We spoke to a senior official at Daxor familiar with the CM-1500
as concerned investors were calling him the day it was cleared. Even though he noted
Daxor's device would not in theory directly compete with the CM-1500, he believed it to
be redundant and was skeptical of its accuracy noting that tachycardia can indicate both
hypo and hypervolemia.


Indeed the only study results we found on the CM-1500 show its lack of precision. The
2016 "study", administered by ZYXI's Director of Strategy and Business Development,
consisted of eight volunteers whose index changes were recorded during a local blood
draw Zynex hosted at its headquarters. Results were mixed at best as the index for two
participants unexpectedly increased.


Judging by the limited information available, in our view, the CM-1500 is best
characterized as a cardiac output monitor (matching its name), which primarily uses
bioelectric impedance analysis to measure fluid levels. The non-invasive cardiac output
or hemodynamic monitor space is led by Edwards Lifesciences (EW). Other
manufacturers include Cardiodynamics, Deltex, Lidco and Retia Medical.


Experienced healthcare investors know that except in rare cases, commercialization is
an uphill and costly effort. Consider Cheetah Medical whose Nicom hemodynamic
monitoring system uses an advanced form of impedance analysis. Cheetah raised over
$90mn, published seven peer-reviewed studies of its technology over six years, and still
took five years to reach $4mn in revenue. Zynex has completed zero peer-reviewed
studies and we will point it out again - has only spent an average of $330k on R&D since
2007. In this context, it seems absurd to even consider the CM-1500 a serious, viable
product, especially considering that cost sensitive hospitals rather than obligated
insurance companies would be the paying customers.


Investors should note that Zynex has repeatedly touted new products in the past, and all
were unequivocal failures. These include a compound pain cream Zynex called a
$1.8bn opportunity, and various products in its now closed NeuroDiagnostics segment
(another $1.8bn TAM). Below is a slide from a 2013 investor presentation (our marks in
red).

And then there are two products Sandgaard has highlighted during earnings calls for
years. The NeuroMove, a stroke rehabilitation product Zynex claimed is a $200mn
opportunity and has tried to sell since 2001, and the InWave cleared in 2012 for urinary
incontinence (appears to be a NexWave reconfigured with a vaginal probe) with a
supposed TAM of $5bn. Both have had negligible sales despite being on the market for
years.

Source: Company presentation


On May 14 Zynex teased "Something BIG is coming" on its social media accounts. The
stock ran up 10% into the announcement on May 18, which turned out to be a catalog of
products manufactured by other medical equipment companies. Any revenues from this
business will be extremely low margin, as none of the equipment is reimbursable by
insurance. We think it's noteworthy that Zynex, which purports itself to be an "innovative
medical technology company", for its first new business effort in years chose
dropshipping medical equipment for other manufacturers.

Several Insurers Respond To Our Concerns, Examine ZYXI
Claims

After we reported our findings to large commercial insurers late last year, several
responded by examining Zynex claims, including Aetna and Humana. We have also
discussed our findings over the phone with several Blue Cross Blue Shield investigators
in several states.

Zynex reported Q1 20 gross margins of 78%, the first time quarterly margins fell below
80% in three years, citing "lower collections from certain commercial payors". It's
possible that insurers, spurred by our reported concerns, are finding irregularities in
ZYXI claims or issues with overall reimbursement policy.


We have since expanded our effort to alert insurers and relevant authorities, sending
complaints to special investigation units of the largest plans in multiple states [samples].
And we have had direct communication with an investigator at the Department of
Insurance of a large state which is investigating after an insurance company reported
Zynex's billings.

Source of Mispricing: Analysts Confuse Zynex For A Medical
Technology Company, Misunderstand TENS Market


ZYXI bulls may paint this effort as simply an attempt to help a short position. But we are
confident the market will reprice the stock lower once certain misconceptions about
Zynex are better understood (more on this below), even without our reports to insurers.
We firmly believe Zynex is a textbook case of corporate waste and abuse contributing to
higher costs in our healthcare system.


At a stock price of $24, Zynex has an enterprise value of $830m, yet we believe the
value of the business is zero. In our view, the disconnect is rooted in the misperception
that Zynex is a Medical Technology company and that innovation and superior execution
has allowed it to succeed where others failed.


Zynex management has successfully shaped this narrative, at least to retail investors.
Sandgaard maintains that larger competitors were shut down by the government (most
recently on a sell-side call) but this is unsupported. In actuality, the two largest
companies in the TENS sector - DJO Global (Empi) and RS Medical - essentially
ceased business by the end of 2015 since it was no longer profitable. See this note to
Empi customers and management's press release announcing the exit. What's more,
both companies were unable to find a buyer for even part of the businesses.


This healthcare environment has impacted our Empi business negatively despite our
investments and best efforts to return that business to sustained profitability. As
result, we have made the difficult decision to exit the Empi business... - Empi
management, 2015


Zynex shareholders are implicitly betting that every other operator in the sector was
unable to make the model work and that potential acquirers of DJO and RS missed the
value. Consider how implausible this idea is. After all, there isn't much room for alpha in
the non-patented, prescription TENS business. There may be some variation in
negotiating contracts with payors, but prices and margins are largely set for all suppliers.

Zynex clearly is not Medtech - recall the minimal amounts spent on R&D, or that 80% of
revenue is from distributed supplies, or that NexWave has been on sale since 2011, a
product for which it has never held a patent. ("NexWave" is not even trademarked. See
this USPTO suspension of application letter from 2012 and notice of abandonment in
2015.)


Or just look at its business model (Exhibit 1) and now its new catalog business. Zynex
is a DME supplies distributor, and it should be evaluated as such.


Yet the four sell-side analysts (B Riley FBR, H.C. Wainwright, Ladenburg and Northland)
covering Zynex all classify it as Medical Technology and comp it to SMIDs actually
engaged in innovation. Mischaracterizing Zynex as Medtech has allowed analysts
and retail investors to view the 80% gross margins and lack of competition as
fundamental positives rather than aberrations.


Part of problem is that until recently there has not been a publicly-traded pure DME
distributor since 2013 (Rotech filed for bankruptcy). The DME industry underwent
significant change beginning in the 2000s and leading up to the CBP in 2011, which
forced margin compression on an industry full of inefficient and debt heavy companies,
leaving it extremely fragmented among private suppliers. Traditional equity investors
had little reason to look at the sector and as a result, investor awareness is limited. This
is especially the case with the TENS sub-sector. To our knowledge, no notable public
M&A has occurred in the space since 2005 so investors and analysts have not had a
benchmark in over 15 years.

8/8/22, 9:17 PM Zynex _ Deteriorating Fundamentals And Signs Of Reimbursement Pressure (NASDAQ _ ZYXI) _ Seeking Alpha

Valuation: Best Case Values Shares 80% Lower


This has contributed to retail shareholders and sell-side analysts misinterpreting industry
dynamics including market size and risks, especially associated with reimbursement.
FBR applies an 20x multiple to 2021 EBITDA and the DCFs of Ladenburg and HCW use
discount rates of only 10 and 11%. In our view these analysts are not only underpricing
reimbursement risk, but ignoring it almost completely (not a single analyst on the Q1 20
earnings call asked about the impact of TRICARE's coverage decision). The potential
for competition is also underpriced - for instance HCW assumes competition does not
enter until 2028 and Ladenburg applies a 6x multiple to 2022 revenues.


In our view, the sell-side is also wrong or has done minimal diligence on the CM-1500.
Despite the inadequate data, Zynex's unbroken history of failed products outside of
NexWave and inexperience in cardiac monitoring, sell-side analysts have helped
promote the CM-1500's potential to retail shareholders, repeating management's $3bn
TAM and promises of commercialization. HCW is even modelling 2021 sales over $3mn
at full MSRP.


So when Zynex was up-listed from OTC to the NASDAQ in early 2019, retail investors,
attracted to the story of growth and limited competition, bid up the stock. Sell-side
analysts helped by evaluating Zynex as a Medical Technology company, applying
inappropriate multiples and downplaying risk. ZYXI shares then qualified for addition into
the Russell 2000 index in June which forced buying by passive index funds. As sales
headcount has grown, so have revenues, fueling another cycle of analyst price target
increases feeding retail investor interest. And now add excitement of a new device with
a supposed multi-billion dollar TAM. All has left ZYXI shares completely mispriced with
an earnings multiple 80% above its closest comparable.


Finding an appropriate DME supplier comp for Zynex was only possible recently when
AdaptHealth (NASDAQ: AHCO) went public late last year. AHCO distributes a broad set
of home medical equipment (HME) across a variety of product categories including
sleep apnea, supplemental oxygen, general HME and supplies. Started in 2012,
AHCO's strategy involves growing through acquisitions of smaller regional companies,
and realizing cost efficiencies with a differentiated technology system that automates
many critical parts of the DME business through e-prescribing, automated patient
outreach and order intake.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352747-zynex-deteriorating-fundamentals-and-signs-of-reimbursement-pressure?source=all_articles_title 29/35


In contrast to Zynex, AdaptHealth has a diversified product mix and gross margins that
make sense for a legitimate distributor of DME (17% in 2019). And AHCO is a
sophisticated business, with highly-regarded management - Chairman Richard Barasch
is former CEO of Universal American and "one of the most prominent thought-leaders in
the payor space" according to SVB Leerink.


AdaptHealth has equivalent adjusted EBITDA margins to Zynex, though it isn't growing
as fast. However, given that Zynex is operating in a constrained market (more on this
below) and in our view entirely dependent on abusive and unsustainable billing, we don't
believe ZYXI deserves credit for this growth. As we stated previously - as revenues
grow so do the risks.

Where should ZYXI shares trade? If we are being kind, Zynex's operating model is a
cross between an HME supplier like AHCO (without any of AHCO's technological and
service value add) and a retail pharmacy, dispensing generic products it does not
manufacture and processing reimbursements, profiting off of the difference between
wholesale costs and insurance payments. In our bull case, Zynex trades with the
average EV/EBITDA multiple of this comp group, valuing shares at $4.5 or 80%
lower. This is supported by a DCF using optimistic assumptions including margin
expansion from current levels and a steep increase in revenue per sales rep relative to
history.

models

However, the names in our comp group don't carry the same regulatory and
reimbursement risks that Zynex does. In our base case, these risks materialize and
reimbursement rates are reset to "normal" levels.

8/8/22, 9:17 PM Zynex _ Deteriorating Fundamentals And Signs Of Reimbursement Pressure (NASDAQ _ ZYXI) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352747-zynex-deteriorating-fundamentals-and-signs-of-reimbursement-pressure?source=all_articles_title 31/35


To approximate normalized revenues and gross margin for Zynex, we use average
reimbursement fees realized between 2013 and 2016. This period incorporates two
significant industry developments: 1) Medicare dropping TENS coverage for lower back
pain, a major revenue driver for TENS units and 2) the first two years of the CBP
adjustment (we exclude 2017, the final year of the adjustment since revenue per order
nonsensically increased 250%).


Applied to 2019 results, this would've cut average supplies revenue per order from $832
to $300 and total revenues by nearly 50%, dropping gross margins to 62%.


Exhibit 14. Zynex completely dependent on supplies reimbursement


Source: Financial statements, NMR


Zynex swings to steep losses here, even though 62% margin is only slightly below the
average of the Medical Technology names mentioned previously. Even if Zynex reduced
SG&A to 75% of revenues, its average between 2009 and 2016, the company would still
operate at a significant loss. These figures make clear why DJO/Empi and RS Medical
left the business during this period.

Current Stock Price Removed From Reality


What would the stock be worth in this scenario? NexWave itself isn't worth anything
significant since much cheaper and similarly unpatented alternatives are available at
retail for a fraction of NexWave's total cost. Its actual value for Zynex has been as a
vehicle for battery and electrode resales reimbursable by commercial payors, which we
have shown would turn unprofitable under a normal, rational reimbursement structure.
In our base case, the value of the business is zero and shares are only worth the
$14mn cash on the balance sheet, or $0.50/share.


The current price of $24 is pricing in nonsensical outcomes. Besides misjudging risk,
investors are severely overestimating the size of the TENS market, in our view.


We estimate US TAM for TENS devices and supplies at $250mn based on the following:


We estimate Empi accounted for 50% of DJO's recovery sciences 2011 revenue of
$343mn [Pg. 49]


Zynex estimated DJO/Empi had 57% market share in 2011 [Slide 17]


Empi 2015 annual run rate revenue was $140mn [Pg. 66]


Zynex 2014 investor relations estimated TAM at $275mn (before Competitive
Bidding) [Slide 12]


Independent research firm Grand View Research estimates market below $200mn


Empi, RS Medical and Zynex combined revenues were ~$270mn in the years
before CBP (so our estimate is likely on the high side)


If we assume Zynex quickly captures 100% market share in 5 years (40% CAGR), with
revenue per rep increasing to $625k, and doesn't lose share to competition until 2031,
operating in perpetuity we still get valuations 45-60% lower.


More simply, at a stock price of $24, ZYXI's market cap of $840mn is over 3-times TAM.


Exhibit 15. Assuming Zynex captures 100% market share, DCF values stock 70-
80% lower

Risks Increasing: Avoid Shares of Zynex

(Note: Implied revenue per sales rep of $625k in this scenario is also detached from
history. Going back to 2010, median revenue per rep is $184k, with a range of $64k to
$259k.)


Rarely have we come across a stock so simple to value yet so mispriced. Zynex isn't a
biotech developing new drugs with variable pricing or a technology company attempting
to create new markets. Zynex distributes a handful of basic items, most of which can be
found on the shelves of a local Walmart, and one of which makes up half of total
revenue. Pricing should be stable and we know the size of the market.


Yet Zynex shares are priced beyond perfection due to analyst and retail investor
confusion and complacency. Risks such as reimbursement cuts are being ignored.
Same with the potential for payor or regulator intervention (see TRICARE's recent
decision to no longer cover TENS for lower-back pain). Red flags like a lack of
competition are rationalized and viewed as positives. Sell-side valuations require inputs
completely divorced from reality.


Eventually, the market will adequately price the risks in ZYXI or insurers and regulators
will force it. Because Zynex has been collecting such egregious amounts and margins
on two generic items, and using abusive billing tactics such as regularly waiving copays,
the probability that regulators or insurance companies investigate has been rising. Last
year, Zynex resold $35mn in batteries and electrodes at ~90% gross margins.
Consensus supplies revenues for 2020 and 2021 are $60mn and $95mn, respectively.
Indeed, we already see evidence of insurers beginning to reexamine reimbursement
policy for Zynex products, with gross margins narrowing last quarter and many
commercial and state insurance investigators now aware of our concerns.
