Gentex seems to be overstating profit. If profit is overstated, the excess may be
tucked into the mysterious "other assets" line on the balance sheet.


Meanwhile, the chairman has been richly compensated with the highly valued

The technology in Gentex mirrors is relatively simple and commoditized, and we

We are equally skeptical of Gentex's capex. Costs look understated and capex

We suspect this is the plug for profits that are not actually there. The "mirror as a
technology platform" that forms Gentex's strongest argument for its competitive
advantage is challenged.


Executive Summary:


Gentex seems to be overstating profit. If profit is overstated, the excess may be

advantage is challenged.


We believe more realistic margins for these mirrors are about 20%. Applying that
assumption, we value the company on a DCF basis at USD 9.10 and recommend
that owners SELL.

Smoke and Mirrors


By Anne Stevenson-Yang


The Basics


Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) makes high-end mirrors for automobiles. While much larger
companies in this cutthroat industry struggle to make gross margins of 18% or 19%,
Gentex regularly reports margins of around 40%. The company attributes this success
to its commanding share of the market in auto-dimming mirrors. Auto-dimming is the
electro-chemical process that enables mirrors to darken automatically at night and avoid
the glare from oncoming headlights that can blind the driver. Auto-dimming has been
around for 30 years and is a mature technology, and several other components
companies also have auto-dimming technology - one of them, Magna, pretty much
exactly the same technology, because Magna's Donnelley subsidiary helped develop it.


Gentex itself admits that the auto-dimming mirrors are technological Trojan horses with
just so-so gross margins, but they are the platforms onto which the company packs
other electronics, such as a remote control device to open garage doors, turning signals
and compasses, a sensor that dims high beams, and other components. Gentex says
that half of its mirrors are sold with these additional features, many of which command
very high margins.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNTX?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
The company's secret sauce is complete vertical integration that enables Gentex to
exercise maniacal quality control. Gentex says that it designs and manufactures
everything from the chemicals used in the layer behind the glass on the mirrors to the
semiconductors that drive the lighting components.


Gentex is a happy company that gets positive reviews from employees who post on
Glassdoor, with a long-tenured, close-knit staff and a founder and chairman who is
highly regarded in the industry and still in control of the company.


This is the company narrative. Our narrative is different. It goes like this:


· Gentex margins exceed those of Apple (AAPL). Gentex reported a 32.1% operating
margin in the most recent quarter while Apple reported 25.1%. GNTX argues that it
makes a high-technology product. Common sense suggests that Apple has more secret
sauce and commands higher price premiums than Gentex. Why the difference? Is
Gentex genuinely more high tech or could the company be making it up?


· Gentex posted questionable numbers when it first listed over-the-counter in 1981. The
company then was making fire alarms for mobile homes, and 79% of revenue came
from a single, undisclosed customer.


· The broker was convicted of securities fraud later that year and fled the United States.
This 1994 SEC decision states that Juan Carlos Schlidowski, president of the
brokerage, was guilty of manipulating Gentex and other companies' stock.


· The Gentex founder's company, which sold the original mirror technology to GNTX,
was financed by Donnelly Corp., a large auto components company just five miles away
from Gentex that had extensive supply relationships with automakers. Donnelly appears
to have retained rights to the technology and at any rate has its own auto-dimming
technology. Donnelly, now part of Magna Corp., also has all the added electronics that
Gentex says are so profitable. Yet Donnelly has never managed to claim profits remotely
approaching those of Gentex.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/1994/id19940527ejk.pdf
· When companies overstate their profits, they are forced into overstating the value of
their balance sheets as a mathematical consequence of the phantom profit. In the case
of Gentex, we calculate that capital expenditure is roughly three times that of peers. Yet
we believe that only simple printed circuit board design and lamination is required for the
electronics portion of the mirrors.


· We estimate that the company is profitable but modestly so, and we think the plant and
equipment value is likely overstated. The principal catalysts we see on the horizon are
SEC action and shareholder demands that Gentex raise its dividend, because we are
skeptical that the company generates the cash reported.


· However, if Gentex is reporting inflated results, as we think it is, the company will need
to continue reporting industry-beating growth and trundling the phantom earnings into
acquisitions or capex. Where to find untraceable growth? Maybe in the supremely
opaque China market, where Gentex plans to sell garage openers, with profits offset by
a new acquisition. If any of that happens, we will be watching.


History


Fred Bauer founded Gentex in Zeeland, Michigan, one of a string of towns along the
east side of Lake Michigan in the heart of America's auto country. Zeeland lies just a few
miles down the road from Holland, home to the 80-year-old Donnelly Corp., now a
division of Magna, whose USD 32 bln in annual component sales include some part of
just about every American car.


Now 72 and still heading Gentex, Bauer appears to be a gifted inventor who in his 20s
developed a heat-control switch for furnaces and marketed it through a company he
called Simicon. In 1972, he sold Simicon to Robertshaw Controls in Zeeland. After
serving for seven years as general manager of Robertshaw's Simicon division, Bauer
formed a partnership called Integrity Design Company, which developed a photoelectric
fire detector and, later, a motorized mirror.


He formed Gentex initially to market a fast-reacting fire-alarm system for mobile homes.
The company then began to market the adjustable mirrors. It listed in 1981. Total sales
in 1980 were USD 4.31 mln, of which the great majority came from intrusion alarms sold
via a single direct-sales organization. Gentex became profitable in 1985.
Using the proceeds from the listing, Gentex acquired from Bauer's company the rights to
a motorized night-vision mirror that Bauer had developed with funding from Donnelley.


In 1983, Bauer met Harlan Byker, a research scientist from Battelle Laboratories, who
was working on an electro-chemical process for auto-dimming. Believing Gentex could
apply the technology to mirrors, Byker joined the company as a research scientist in
1985 and then as vice president for electrochemical research from 1993. With Byker's
help, Gentex added auto-dimming capability to its motorized mirrors and shipped its first
Night Vision Safety (NVS) mirror to Ford Motor Company (F) in 1987. In 1991, the
company developed an exterior auto-dimming mirror. By 1993, Gentex was shipping
mirrors with headlight control features, compasses, sensors, and interior lights.


Since the early 1990s, Gentex has made steady progress penetrating first the high-end
then mid-end auto models with this technology that is apparently so desirable and so
difficult to replicate that Gentex has margins well over double those of any competitor.
Gentex shipped 33 mln auto-dimming units in 2015, representing a 5% increase in
interior mirrors and a 37% increase in exterior mirrors and representing a near-90%
market share in auto-dimming mirrors. Back in 1995, Donnelley, then the world's
second-largest supplier of mirrors, was shipping just 70,000 auto-dimming mirrors,
primarily to Ford, Range Rover, and Jaguar, to Gentex's 1.8 mln units. Although Magna
Donnelly has raised its share of auto-dimming mirrors, Magna sits at a mere 10% of the
market.


In 2002, Donnelley merged with Magna International, Inc. (MGA), a Canadian
components company, but never expanded its share of auto-dimming mirrors. Like
Gentex, Magna also sells automatic garage door openers, electronic toll collection
devices, compass and temperature displays, and telematics embedded in the mirrors.
Magna's gross margins are less than half Gentex's, and Magna also trades at half
Gentex's earnings multiple.


Why is it that a much larger company headquartered very close to Gentex that
separately owns all the technologies that GNTX identifies as key to its success and that
has relationships with all major automakers around the world, why is it that this company
cannot achieve even half the margins that Gentex can? Even though the two have been
competing in this segment for 20 years?


Competition

Gentex reports that its competitors include Magna, Samvardhana Motherson Reflectec,
Murakami Kaimeido Company, Ichikoh Industries, Tokai Rika Company, and Grupo
Ficosa International and that it supplies auto-dimming rearview mirrors to "certain of
these rearview mirror competitors." In interviews, we have learned that Gentex and
Magna have the same technology, while Murakami and Tokai Ricoh have another, less
popular auto-dimming technology that is less cost-competitive. One executive told us
that Murakami had mothballed its auto-dimming technology and was purchasing
dimming glass from Gentex.


Gentex now ships glass assemblies to a few of these companies, for example,
Murakami. Tokai Rika has its own auto-dimming mirrors. In 2015, the company identified
a new group of competitors, adding YH America, Inc., BYD Auto Company, Steelmate,
Ningbo Kingband, and Beijing Sincode. In China's electronics markets, dimming mirrors
with embedded cameras can be purchased retail for about USD 30. The China market
swarms with competitors for this space, something that Gentex readily admits, but
Gentex says that no one else has the manufacturing rigor to meet OEM requirements
for mass production. The local start-ups come and go.


Maybe. But there is no good reason why mirrors should require a more sophisticated
process than, say, airbags, and the advent of new competitors suggests that the
technology is not that hard to master.


Outperformance


The auto parts business is a brutal one that has felled many great companies from
Delphi (DLPH) to Visteon (VC). The Wisconsin behemoth Johnson Controls (JCI)
restructured and divested its auto components division. Few survive the brutal cost-
cutting ways of the big OEMs, which act virtually as monopsonies and hold their supply
chain to very tight margins. The most technology rich of the companies, making drive
trains and continuous transmissions and air bags, struggle to make 20% gross margins.
Start-up companies may capture a bit more margin, but once they are supplying at
volume, no one gets 40%.

Gentex outperforms every single automotive components company in the world and not
by just a little - by at least 100%. Of these companies, Denso (OTCPK:DNZOY) is a
standout in the level of technological input to the components. Denso spends 9% of
much higher gross revenue on R&D (Gentex: 5.7%). High-value powertrain control
systems make up 36% of revenue, truck refrigeration and air purification systems 31%,
and safety systems including four-camera surround vehicle monitoring systems, blind-
spot detection, and night vision, 14% - non-trivial technologies.


Autoliv (NYSE:ALV), whose average margin is 19.5%, principally makes airbags, a
complex technology originally developed for heat-seeking missiles in which tiny fractions
of seconds in reaction time can make the difference in saving lives. Autoliv also has
significant business in "active safety systems" including: "... camera-based vision
systems, night driving assist, automotive radars, brake controls, positioning systems,
electronic control units, and other active safety systems, and passive safety electronic
products, such as restraint electronics and crash sensors." Autoliv, like Gentex, spent
5.7% of revenue on R&D in 2015.


It is hard to understand why mirrors with some added features should offer higher
margins than do these clearly higher-tech components.

One of the most consistent pieces of feedback from the big automakers is that they
centralize procurement, break down suppliers' components to analyze their costs, and
ruthlessly confine their suppliers to a reasonable but not an outlying margin. No auto
components supplier has enough leverage to command margins in the Gentex range,
much less a small company with commodity technology and a modest R&D spend.

Auto-dimming mirrors are clearly more expensive than dumb mirrors, but there are
significant discrepancies between management's estimates and those we got from
interviews with former employees in sales functions with Gentex. Management
estimated that a simple rearview mirror would be sold for USD 22-24; salespeople told
us the price was around USD 15-18. Exterior auto-dimming mirrors are cheaper,
perhaps USD 8. Gentex's Average Selling Price (ASP), derived from disclosures of units
sold and revenue, is USD 46.78 as of 2015. Given that the company discloses that 50%
of mirrors have additional features, that means that the ASP for mirrors with additional
features would be USD 78. The calculation is as follows:

The interviews we were able to complete with former Gentex executives did in fact
support this level of pricing. Call us jaded, but we are still skeptical. The types of add-
ons to the Gentex mirrors are simply not that complex. Some of them, for example, have
compasses or turning signals. Some have a remote to open a garage door. Some have
devices that control the high-beams. None of these electronic features is especially
challenging, and we find it very difficult to believe that a murderously cost-conscious
OEM would pay USD 78 for a mirror whose features are readily available on anyone's
smart phone. Former OEM employees involved with procurement also said that they
rarely buy fully loaded mirrors for pre-install. HomeLink is more often sold on the visor,
and this format has a lower margin than the mirror-installed HomeLink feature.
Not only is Gentex an outperformer in ASP and profit but the company has consistently
outsold the growth of the auto industry, a feat that competitors have found extremely
difficult. Gentex reported 14% unit growth in auto-dimming mirrors in 2015 even as U.S.
auto production rose 5.7%. Gentex reported higher penetration in Europe, Japan, and
Korea, although worldwide auto production grew only 1%. For 2017, IHS estimates light
vehicle production growth in the company's primary markets at 1%. GNTX forecasts its
own growth at 6-10%.


The company reported significant acceleration in the last quarter of 2015, with 22%
interior mirror growth, up 17% QoQ. Net income rose even faster, at 25% YoY in the
quarter. The gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 40.2% compared with
a gross profit margin of 38.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014.


The regularity with which Gentex revenue and calculated ASP rise defy trends in the
industry. Gentex admits that automotive OEMs target annual price reductions of about 3-
4% for all their component suppliers, and yet Gentex has managed a small increase in
ASP every year of the last six except for 2012, when the calculated ASP fell by 3.4%
YoY, from USD 46.71 to USD 45.19. Executives say that they are able to pass the price
reductions on to their own suppliers. But executives also claim that glass is virtually the
only component the company purchases.

The Gentex technology


Gentex's secret sauce, they say, is its ability to load the rearview mirror in a car, which it
calls its "technology platform," with add-on features. It does not break out the sales of
these add-ons, but it discloses that about 50% of mirrors ship with an add-on of some
kind and about 50% of revenue comes from value-added features.


In our work on fraudulent companies in China, we have found that many of them use a
high degree of vertical integration to obscure the real costs of manufacturing and push
costs off into R&D or Property, Plant, and Equipment. Gentex, which, relative to other
auto components companies, is a tiny flea, nevertheless claims a much higher degree of
vertical integration.


In this video Gentex boasts that it has hundreds of patents, 300 of them for chemistry
alone. Management says that pharmaceutical companies do not make chemicals to the
purity that Gentex requires and they must manufacture chemicals themselves. Gentex
also says that it designs some of its own machinery.


We did find more than 200 patents registered to Gentex on Google Patents (Note that a
Carbondale, PA, company that makes military equipment is also called Gentex Corp.
and also owns many patents). While we do not dispute the utility of registering hundreds
of patents, many seem fairly trivial. For example, Patent US 5689370 A,
"Image/information displays on electro-optic devices," described thus:



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqbQAzH2rEM
An improved electro-optic rearview mirror for motor vehicles, the mirror incorporating an
improved display, such as "HEATED" or "OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN
THEY APPEAR" or the like, and wherein the mirror colors and clears uniformly and the
display is effected in an aesthetically pleasing manner.


HomeLink


HomeLink is an automatic garage-door remote opening device that Gentex licensed
from Johnson Controls and began incorporating into its mirrors in 2001. Despite
requests from the SEC, Gentex has never disclosed how many HomeLink units are
sold. The device is sold by a number of distributors including Liftmaster, Mito, and
Brandmotion.


In September 2013, Gentex completed the acquisition of the HomeLink product from
Johnson Controls for USD 701 mln. In that year, Gentex recorded USD 307.4 mln in
goodwill as a result of the HomeLink acquisition plus USD 366 mln in intangibles,
suggesting that the acquisition might have been overvalued by about 300 mln.


JCI had never disclosed revenue specifically for the HomeLink product. HomeLink was
part of JCI's automotive electronics unit. In 2014, JCI sold the remainder of the unit to
Visteon Corp. for USD 265 mln.  Visteon disclosed that the portion of the business it
acquired had generated USD 1.3 bln in revenues in 2012 and USD 58 mln in earnings.


[1]


JCI had acquired HomeLink in 1996 with the acquisition of Prince Holding Corporation,
a USD 850 mln company making interior components such as sun visors.


The HomeLink feature had been integrated into Gentex mirrors since 2001. Yet Gentex
reported that the HomeLink acquisition would increase revenue by USD 125-150 mln
while also reducing cost since the company would no longer be paying licensing fees.


Gentex acquired some JCI customers who were buying the HomeLink feature as a
standalone or attached to a front seat window visor, but sales of that nature should have
dragged down GNTX's margins. The more likely answer lies in the terms of the
acquisition. When Gentex acquired HomeLink from Johnson Controls, the companies
also made an agreement under which GNTX would sell HomeLink products back to JCI
in perpetuity, at an undisclosed price.  Later questioned by the SEC, Gentex said that
the agreement was made on an arm's-length basis and at a market price.


[2]
This arrangement suggests that Gentex could have overpaid for the HomeLink
technology to seed its future revenue.


Making Too Much of HomeLink


The HomeLink acquisition in Q4 2013 cluttered up the Gentex balance sheet and could
plausibly have been made in order to accommodate overstated profits: HomeLink added
a big chunk of goodwill, which grew in that year to 15% of total assets, while goodwill
plus intangibles rose to 39% of assets. A plausible explanation for the HomeLink sales
growth post acquisition is that Gentex overpaid JCI in order to enable JCI to repurchase
HomeLink units at a higher ASP than it has commanded as the technology's owner. In
that way, Gentex could have double-dipped on its acquisition, setting up USD 300 mln in
new revenues from JCI while also booking the USD 300 mln as goodwill. If that narrative
is true, it suggests that Gentex has to work harder these days to maintain its purported
margins.


The second half of 2015 marked some of the fastest growth compared with growth in
the automotive market that Gentex has ever experienced. It also in some ways marked
the start of the new, more aggressive share-management regime post-Steve Dykman. In
2013, CFO Steve Dykman left abruptly to take a position as CFO of C.H.I. Overhead
Doors Inc., and the new CFO, Steve Downing, seems promotional. Downing is not
excessively paid for a listed company CFO but he does have incentive to drive the share
price higher. With an annual salary of USD 337,500 plus a bonus in 2015 bringing total
compensation to nearly USD 500,000, Downing was granted 17,730 stock options and
6,500 restricted shares after being appointed in June 2015. The option exercise price
equals the stock's market price on date of grant, and the options vest after one to five
years. A 25% increase in the share price would therefore mean roughly USD 70,000 in
additional compensation for Downing.


There are some signs that the situation is deteriorating for Gentex. The company shows
rapidly expanding accruals and deteriorating FCF margin, inventory growth, and
depreciation and amortization that are unsustainably low. We see HomeLink as a
warning sign.


In correspondence in November 2014, the SEC asked Gentex to disclose the revenue
and margin boost it achieved from acquiring HomeLink. In a June 2015 response,
Gentex refused to do so, claiming that current disclosures were adequate.

The range of universal remotes for garage doors is large. Chamberlain and Genie
appear to be the market leaders, and their products can be controlled using a smart
phone app. Universal remotes can be purchased at Home Depot for between USD 20-
49. Although there is some value associated with adding a remote to the overhead
mirror, we do not believe that the value is sufficient to bring ASPs for HomeLink-
equipped mirrors to over USD 100, as some former salespeople have represented in
interviews.


To estimate the portion of sales for which HomeLink is responsible, we look at Gentex's
disclosure in Q4 2013 that HomeLink sales would grow by between USD 125 and USD
150 mln in 2014 as a consequence of the acquisition. Guessing that the USD 150 mln
doubled Gentex's 2013 revenue for HomeLink, 2014 would have seen USD 300 mln in
HomeLink sales or 22% of the company's total.


SmartBeam


Gentex announced the launch of SmartBeam technology in 2001 and said it had
preliminary agreements from customers to install the technology in the first half of 2004
and in 2005. SmartBeam uses a light sensor to determine whether the high beams
should be used and turns them on and off as needed. The company says:


"SmartBeam uses a miniature, mirror-borne CMOS image sensor (camera on an
electronic chip) to monitor surrounding traffic conditions and automate high-beam
usage, making nighttime driving safer by maximizing forward lighting."


We think SmartBeam may be responsible for around 10-15% of company revenue.


A SmartBeam-like feature is also available from Bosch, Autoliv, and other components
companies.


Now that cars are all required to install backing cameras, companies like Mobileye
(MBLY) can add a highbeam-control feature basically for free. An engineer familiar with
the technology told us that adding the feature to an existing camera costs just USD 5 or
so while Gentex says it charges USD 70 for a second camera in its mirror.


Lane Keeping and Driver Alert



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MBLY?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
Starting in 2012, Gentex has used Mobileye graphics chips for a new High-Beam
Control, Lane Keeping, and Driver Alert system. The system uses a camera on the car
to identify whether the driver has wandered from his lane, triggering the Lane Keeping
function to vibrate the steering wheel and jog the driver to be more alert. In 2015,
Gentex stopped working with Mobileye and will make the camera itself. The Mobileye-
based cameras are on Ford, Jaguar, and Land Rover models; for new launches with
other OEMs, they will develop their own technology.


TransCore Toll Solutions


In 2015, Gentex made an agreement with TransCore LP to integrate that company's
Universal Toll Module in the mirror, enabling the driver to avoid adding a second RFID
tag to the windshield area. The module is designed to be integrated into vehicle
manufacturing rather than added in the aftermarket. The UTM is a prospective add-on to
Gentex mirrors.


Dynamic Forward Lighting


This feature is used to control high-beam glare by diverting the beam around oncoming
and preceding vehicles. The system has been approved only for sale in Europe.


Rear Camera Display/Full Display Mirrors


In 2006, Gentex announced that it had plans to supply Rear Camera Display (RCD)
mirrors to OEMs. The mirror was already available that year on the Toyota (TM) Camry
sold via Gulf States Toyota, with the RCD mirror installed at port by Gulf States. The
mirrors display images from a rear camera for backing.


Gentex's new Full Display Mirrors show images from behind the car continuously for
when drivers prefer to watch the road using the panoramic camera rather than the
mirror. Gentex said it shipped only 150-200 Full Display Mirrors in 2015 but will be
ramping the inclusion of these mirrors in many new vehicle programs going forward.


Other: telematics, wireless control systems, compasses, lights


Gentex also embeds in some of its mirrors compasses, turning signals (for the exterior
mirrors), LED lights, blind-zone indicators, and other features.


Breaking Down the Components



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
In interviews with industry and ex-Gentex executives, we have pulled together estimates
of prices that Gentex receives from automotive OEMs for its mirrors and added features.
Those prices generally seem to line up with the prices charged by competitors who have
far lower margins. Since it's unlikely that Gentex manufacturing is twice as efficient as
that of competitors, we think the margins are overstated.


Components companies typically charge different prices depending on the channel in
which the component is sold.


· The lowest prices are those at which the company sells to OEM factories. The
company sells two-thirds interior mirrors and one-third exterior. About half the mirrors
have add-on components. The typical interior mirror with add-ons has a compass and
the HomeLink feature. This channel represents about 75% of sales.


· Tier 1 distributors provide pre-assembled components to OEM factories. The Tier 1
partner may get the same price as the OEM but takes low-end components. Gentex
sells plain side mirrors and glass assemblies for exterior dimming mirrors through Tier 1
distributors. These are very low-value components. This channel represents about 20%
of sales. Tier 1 partners include SMR, Tokai Ricoh, Ficosa, and others. The company
claims that margins are much higher on these glass assemblies than on the interior
mirrors but we doubt it.


· Automotive OEMs have subsidiaries that attach components at port before the cars go
to the dealers. This might be done when components are added to certain trim levels or
certain regions of the world. The accessory channels pay around 20-30% more than the
factories. This channel is worth around 3% of sales.


· Consumers buy some components in the aftermarket, when the original component
has been damaged or by request to a dealer before buying the car. The aftermarket
pays 3-4x the price paid by factories, but the aftermarket is a very small portion of sales.


Based on our interviews, we estimate the following average prices for components sold
to OEM factory clients.

We were not able to obtain pricing estimate for the Full Display Mirror, which is Gentex's
hope for sustained margins in the future. But in the China market, there are dozens of
companies offering full display mirrors for a fraction of the price Gentex claims.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/1/10/saupload_Image_1.png
Chinese brand full-display mirror retailing for about USD 80. Retail prices are generally
around 3-4x factory prices. The company quotes much higher prices in meetings and on
calls. That is not strictly inaccurate - aftermarket prices are far higher than factory prices,
so it is not exactly wrong to quote USD 250 for a mirror with HomeLink, it's just
misleading.


The factory prices as opposed to the retail prices are roughly comparable to those
charged by Magna and other competitors, according to automotive industry sources.


It is important to note that the factory prices, multiplied by the volumes, do add up to
reported revenue numbers. But if Gentex is not getting premium prices, how does it
have premium margins?

The Margins


Gentex's gross margin contrasts with those reported by Magna, the largest
manufacturer in the world of automotive mirrors, which were 14.2% for the 2015
calendar year. Magna does not break out the margins for its Vision Systems division, but
the technological content and likely margins would seem to sit in the middle of Magna's
range of products, which run from seating and exteriors to powertrain and electronics.
Gentex used to claim that auto-dimming was the impossible-to-replicate feature that
made its mirrors much more valuable. Auto-dimming mirrors, they say, are gaining in
industry penetration, but, with a current 25% or so share, they still have a long runway
for growth.


But industry experts suggest that dimming is just not enough of a selling point to
persuade customers to pay a lot more.


Some say that Magna's auto-dimming technology is just not as good as Gentex's. One
accessories executive told of a case in which Magna dimming mirrors leaked and
damaged car dashboards. But the two companies are intimately familiar with one
another, and OEM clients routinely take bids from both and yet Magna, which could
easily undersell Gentex to capture market, has only about 10% of the auto-dimming
market. Says a former Gentex executive:


"I have a confused perspective like you do [about why Magna does not have a bigger
share of the auto-dimming market]. It looks like a great opportunity for Magna … and
OEMs are not so endeared to Gentex as they used to be. There's a price opening, a
technology opening, and an OEM relationship opening."


The principal reason, Gentex says, that it can earn margins 2.66x those of the industry
leader is because it adds electronics to about half the mirrors. This is an argument that
analysts have been buying for two decades, but it makes little sense, for two reasons.


First, Magna's mirrors - more than 125 million of them - like Gentex's offer proprietary
auto-dimming technology, lane-keeping assistance, glare-free high beam, collision
mitigation, rear-vision video, and other features. In short, Magna has all the features
Gentex has except for the garage-door opening feature, HomeLink. Magna also has the
advantage of enormous scale. Gentex reported producing 34 mln mirrors in 2015 (in the
Investor Day presentation, executives said 35.5 mln instead), meaning that Magna's
mirror division alone is 3.5 times the size of Gentex's business. Gentex says that its
production is more efficient, but we do not know of businesses that out-scale their
competitors by a factor of three and yet make the same devices at higher cost.
The second, more pertinent issue with Gentex is that its added electronics are neither
technically challenging nor, in most cases, proprietary. These are panes of bent and
coated glass backed by printed circuit boards that control simple circuitry to light up a
compass and a thermometer, activate a turning signal, or send a radio signal to a
garage door, all in plastic casing and stuck to a windshield.

The Capex Blowout


The portion of Gentex's financials that bothers us most is the capital budget. Gentex
brings everything in house, from the chemicals it needs for dimming glass to the
semiconductor packaging facility. Doing everything in house, though, makes costs non-
transparent.


Gentex reports an average of about USD 1.2 mln for every additional 50,000 mirrors in
new machinery alone purchased. The company has been adding production machinery
even when, as in 2010, it was operating at only 53% factory utilization. In 2011, with
utilization of 65%, Gentex spent USD 120 mln expanding its production capacity.

The Spike: 1996


Gentex debuted the interior electrochromic mirror in 1987 and the exterior EC mirror in
1991. It stopped selling the old motorized mirror in 1991 and started to add features like
a compass, reading light, and headlight dimming to the interior mirror starting in 1991.
Yet when the mirror offering was merely a simple, motorized mirror, gross margins were
37.3% (1990), 39.7% (1991), and 43.9% (1992). Margins for this mechanical device
were expanding. Why bother to invest in new technology?


The spike in capital expenditures began in 1996, when spending jumped from USD 4.86
mln in 1995 to USD 16.4 mln in 1996 and grew from there. There was a burst of capex
in 2001. Since 2005, with the exception of the auto industry's disaster year, 2009,
Gentex has been adding around USD 50 mln per year in machinery and equipment
spending that seems to be of dubious value; all it has achieved is unit volume growth in
manufacturing at an average of USD 32 per mirror produced just for the machinery.


As this has been happening, Gentex has been racking up "other assets" on the balance
sheet, reaching USD 752 mln in 2015. Those Other Assets consist of Goodwill, Long-
term Investments, Intangibles, and Patents.
There are few indications in the reports of what the capex is for. That fact alone is
concerning. In many cases, the capex increment is material: in 1998 for example,
Gentex added USD 25.6 mln worth of machinery and equipment to a base of USD 58.3
mln in machinery and total plant and equipment of USD 59.4 mln without disclosing
anything about why it was necessary to add 50% to the existing fixed-asset base. By
2011, the company had more than USD 600 mln in plant and equipment but, with a
utilization rate of just 65%, saw fit to invest an additional USD 120 mln. As to why,
Gentex referred only to "strong customer demand for our auto-dimming mirrors and
more complex product mix."


Early on, Gentex did provide more detail, and it suggested a company that was either
making highly ill-advised investments or perhaps simply inflating the capex line. In 1991,
Gentex spent USD 21 mln on "glass coating equipment" to bring the coating process in-
house. The company attributed its 700 bps margin improvement over 18 months to this
coating process.


In the 2001 Annual Report, Gentex reported spending for development of white LEDs,
which it called Orca:


"Thanks to Orca, Gentex's original white-light LED illuminator, which consisted of a
pod of four blue-green and two amber LEDs, has been reduced to a single LED
package. Complete Orca assemblies will be built in prototype quantities in a new,
state-of-the-art microelectronics line," the company reported on page 17. "Orca white
LEDs have already been integrated into new automatic-dimming mirrors as map
lamps. These second-generation map-lamp assemblies decrease overall mirror
complexity and footprint size while increasing light output. We plan to begin shipping
these new lighted mirrors this year for 2003 model vehicles."


In other words, Gentex engaged in the hideously expensive business of developing
white-LED technology in order to put a little light on the mirror, the kind that normally sits
between the visors and that you turn on to read a map, the kind that costs maybe USD 2
when companies like Visteon sell it as part of the overhead console. In the late 1990s,
when Japanese companies like Toyoda Gosei (Toyoda) and Nichia were developing
white LEDs, they spent around USD 85 mln per year on the effort.


The last mention of Orca came in the 2007 10-K:



https://jcapitalresearch.box.com/s/ukgmie6y27k1c45nnqpu35bwu41zd9qe
"In 1999, the Company announced the development of its LED technology, which
represented the first time that white light for illumination purposes could be achieved
using high intensity Orca power LEDs on a cost-effective basis. LEDs as illuminators
have many advantages over incandescent lamps, including extremely long life, low
heat generation, lower current draw, more resistance to shock, and lower total cost of
ownership. The Company continually evaluates LEDs that are offered in the market
place and is currently working with suppliers that can provide high quality LEDs in a
more cost effective manner."


(2007 10-K page 7)


Gentex mothballed the Orca technology, yet there is no place in the accounts where
GNTX recognizes a write-off of the R&D and machinery that went into this effort.


The company also says that it hired acoustic engineers to develop a superior
microphone to embed in the mirror.


"Gentex even manufactures its own noise-cancellation microphones designed
specifically to enhance hands-free cellular communications in the harsh automotive
environment" (2003 AR page 10)


That may be true, but procurement staff from the automotive manufacturers are very
clear that they will not pay more for a better microphone, since this technology is
available as a commodity from many manufacturers. The same is true of the "telematic"
features such as the compass.


Since 2001, Gentex has been talking about its proprietary design for CMOS chips:


"During 2001, the Company announced a revolutionary new technology, called
SmartBeam (TM), using a custom, activepixel, CMOS (complementary metal oxide
semiconductor) sensor, that maximizes a driver's forward vision by significantly
improving utilization of the vehicle's highbeam headlamps during nighttime driving."
(2001 10-K page 6)
The most recent mention of the CMOS imaging was in the 2015 10-K, when Gentex
referred to "Our CMOS imager technology when used as a rearward facing automotive
video camera..." (page 9).


But CMOS chips are sensors, the less-valuable portion of driver-assist technology. More
difficult is the complex software that processes images taken from the cameras. The
driver-assist technology was licensed from Mobileye. The Mobileye driver-assist
features were integrated into Gentex mirrors in 2013, and GNTX subsequently decided
to end its cooperation with Mobileye in order to capture better economics. There was no
visible effect on margins.


On every metric of capital expenditure, Gentex outstrips the competitors.

The reality is that Gentex has not come up with anything since auto-dimming. It licensed
and then purchased HomeLink, which sustains sales. As a former executive comments,
"They have gone through a long period without innovation. They are very conservative."


Depreciation

Just a Slip?


On the Q2 2016 call, Gentex Vice President of Engineering Neil Boehm seems to have
misspoken. He said the following:


Click to enlarge



https://jcapitalresearch.box.com/s/kc3mdlxsw44xjnydh0tmknlpji31rus3
"In the second quarter of 2016 there were 26 new nameplate launches of our inside
and outside electrochromic mirrors and electronic features. The unique part of the
second quarter is the shift in the types of launches the Company has experienced.
Over the past three years approximately two/thirds of launches have been base
interior and exterior autodimming mirrors with no added electronic features.


However, in the second quarter of 2016, of the 26 nameplate launches,
approximately two/thirds of them were advanced feature launches.


Historically, the Company has been able to demonstrate that it has delivered higher-
than-average contribution margins when it's not only growing unit penetration, but
also adding electronic content faster than unit growth."


In the past, however, the company has consistently reported that advanced features are
included in about half of the mirrors shipped.


Mechanisms


We believe that Gentex is understating its costs by bringing everything to Zeeland,
Michigan. Management has said, for example, that Gentex owns its own fab. The
company does have a small facility where semiconductors are cut and packaged in a
clean-room setting, but that is a far cry from the highly capital-intensive business of
fabbing one's own chips, and we think management knows the difference. We know that
the company owns several hundred Surface Mount Technology machines for laminating
PCBs, but this is commoditized equipment; adding to SMT equipment requires tens of
thousands of dollars, not millions.


In general, Gentex tends to state every technological development in the most
promotional of terms and to mislead as to its costs.


How the Business Works


Sales channels
All sales of inside mirrors are direct; most sales of exterior mirrors are through partners.
The exterior mirrors are providing all the growth. Gentex claims that the exterior mirrors
are cheaper but offer higher margins than the interior ones. But even if the exterior
dimming mirrors are more profitable when sold direct, with added features, our
interviews indicate that the majority of exterior mirrors are sold as sub-assemblies to
other components companies, and interviews suggest that these components
companies, not Gentex, engineer the assemblies to fit the glass and contain the
components relevant to a specific car. It is very rare for an exterior mirror to be sold pre-
loaded with features and specifically designed for the purchasing OEM. This type of sale
is unlikely to attract a high margin.


Aftermarket


Roughly 5% of Gentex sales come from the aftermarket, but this does not mean retail
sales: the largest portion of aftermarket sales are made to the port-based subsidiary of
an OEM or to a dealer, and those companies apply the mirrors. These sales are
attractive to Gentex because dealers and port-based OEM assembly companies are
much less price-sensitive than the OEMs themselves.


Regions


Gentex reports that most of its international sales are disclosed in the automotive
portion of the "other" income category, which also includes revenue from the smoke
alarms and the airplane windows. Only automotive sales in the U.S., Germany, and
Japan are included in the "Automotive Products" sales category. Sales in all other
nations, therefore, are less than 2.3% of total sales.


Automotive Products revenues in the "Other" category are sales to customer automotive
manufacturing plants in Korea, Mexico, Canada, Hungary, China, and the United
Kingdom as well as other foreign automotive customers. Most of the Company's non-
U.S. sales are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars (page 58 2015 10-K)
Gentex may not treat as "overseas" sales to vehicles that ship from the U.S., Europe, or
Japan even if the vehicles are sold elsewhere. But given the large distributor
relationships Gentex discloses in Mexico and India, it is surprising that more revenue
does not come from these regions. In China, Gentex has low penetration but has
nevertheless maintained a presence for a decade. Management says that Gentex no
longer maintains its assembly plant in China because shipping from overseas leads to
less breakage. But China requires that its domestically made autos must include at least
75% locally made content, and to meet that standard, the components probably need to
be invoiced in renminbi. So we find it unlikely that OEMs in China would not require the
mirror to be installed in China in order to meet localization requirements. Magna,
Murakami, Ichikoh, and other competitors have large presences in China with
manufacturing facilities and sales forces talking to the Chinese OEMs. It seems unlikely
that Gentex could compete in China on an export basis alone.


The Challenge from Cameras


New rules issued by the Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) require vehicles
to begin installing rearview cameras as of May 1. The phase-in schedule requires that
10% of vehicles have the cameras after May 2016, 40% after May 2017, and 100% of
vehicles after May 2018. In this release, NHTSA estimated that 57% of model year 2014
vehicles already had a rear video system, and that even without a final rule, 73% of the
vehicles sold into North America would have already included a rearview video system
by 2018.


Camera installation undermines Gentex's bid to make the rearview mirror the
automobile's "technology platform." With the technology content of cars increasing, most
higher-end models include LCD screens that host the navigation and entertainment
system, and this larger screen is the natural location for mirror-embedded electronics. A
former executive of Gentex told us that the company had put a lot of money into
research to prove that the mirror was the safest place to put technologies like backing
cameras. But the OEMs want pricing leverage and do not want to be confined to one
company's platform.
Gentex responds that backing cameras have a lot of failure risk and can be blocked by
ice and snow. They say that drivers use rearview mirrors to view the cabin as well as the
car exterior, and the ability to switch between camera display and a dumb mirror is
useful. Finally, Gentex points out that the company is already shipping RCD mirrors
while it portrays the threat from backing cameras as something automakers face in the
future.


But as long ago as 2012, Gentex itself contradicted this story in the Q4 call. Then-Senior
Vice President and CFO Steve Dykman said on that call:


"RCD Mirror unit shipments decreased by approximately 8% in calendar year 2012
compared with calendar year 2011. In calendar year 2013, RCD Mirror unit shipments
are estimated to decrease by approximately 25% to 35% compared with 2012, which
incorporates estimated reduced RCD Mirror unit shipments to automotive customers
who have previously notified the Company of their plans to have the display for the
rear camera and the radio instead of the rear view mirror." - Seeking Alpha transcript


For the backing camera system itself, competitors include Continental, Bosch, and
Mobileye, all offering low-cost systems.


Mobileye, whose technology Gentex purchased and incorporated into its camera-based
driver assist systems in 2012-14, designs and develops vision-based driver assistance
systems for automobile collision prevention and mitigation. Mobileye claims OEM
integrations into car models from 20 global automakers including BMW
(OTCPK:BMWYY), Ford, General Motors (GM), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), and Volvo
(OTCPK:VOLVY).


Gentex concedes that backing systems from Mobileye are relatively inexpensive though
Mobileye does not disclose the ASP on its cameras. Mobileye sales are growing very
rapidly, suggesting that Mobileye is more likely to take share in backing systems.


As to how Gentex can compete with Mobileye's low cost, CFO Steve Downing said on
the Q2 2015 conference call:

"Gentex historically has been focused on a custom solution, in other words, we're not
just competing Mobileye or other large Tier 1s, trying to go head-to-head against
Mobileye or any of the other Tier 1s who are becoming more involved in active driver-
assist. Gentex is looking at a very customized solution, in other words, it's a
homegrown developed camera and imager solution that we bring to the market, and
we offer that at a much lower price point than what most of the driver-assist systems
are selling for today." - Steve Downing, Q3 2015 call


Bloated Capex


Whether on the basis of capex per square foot of factory space, per dollar of revenue, or
per employee, Gentex is way out of whack with its industry peers. Gentex spends three
times what Magna spends per square foot of factory space. It spends twice as much as
the nearest second in capex per employee. Denso, a company making far higher-tech
products, spends half of what Gentex does per dollar of revenue.

In many ways, the company's balance sheet makes little sense. Neither capital
expenditure nor R&D spend seems to follow a pattern. Engineering and R&D (not
broken out separately) have come down continually as a percentage of sales. Net PPE
as a proportion of COGS has also been in decline for five years despite rising sales.
Free cash flow is highly volatile.


The projects on which Gentex spends money make us raise our eyebrows. Does a
mirror company really need to fab its own semiconductors or manufacture its own
chemicals? How is it that failed projects of the past never made a dent in the company
balance sheet?


Distilled Water


Gentex reported that in 2013 the company began to make its own distilled water,
building the plant for USD 11 mln.


"In 2013, the Company completed a 120,000 square-foot expansion project
connecting two of its manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan, with a total cost of
approximately $25 million. Also in 2013, the Company completed a 10,000 square-
foot facility to centralize the production and distribution of chilled water that is used in
production, chemistry labs, as well as air conditioning. This was completed for a total
cost of approximately $11 million. The above projects were funded from cash and
cash equivalents on hand."


Semiconductors


Company management says that Gentex manufactures its own proprietary
semiconductors. Company disclosures do not discuss this fab, and visitors are not
permitted to view it. We cannot think of a good reason why the simple electronic devices
Gentex markets should require a proprietary semiconductor; the level of complexity is
something approximating LED Christmas lights that flash alternating colors: printed
circuit boards are entirely sufficient to manage the electronic signals. And semi fabs
require very significant capital investment.


China Facility
In 2006, Gentex purchased a 25,000-square-foot facility in Shanghai at a cost of USD
750,000 to localize final assembly of the mirrors. This was done because Chinese
government policies require automakers to localize at least 75% of their bill of materials,
and Gentex was under pressure from OEMs to invoice in local currency. Company
executives say that it was inefficient to ship the glass assemblies to Shanghai, and there
was breakage, so they closed the facility in the first half of 2014 and resumed shipping
from Michigan.


But disclosures say that there was no foreign currency billing at all before 2011.
Although executives say that the company was assembling mirrors, the disclosures
never indicate any manufacturing in China.


Germany


Gentex's office and distribution facility in Erlenbach, Germany, is 60% larger than the
one in Shanghai yet cost 5.5x as much - USD 5 mln for the 40,000 square foot office
and distribution facility. In 2015, the company began building a 50,000 square-foot
expansion that is expected to cost USD 7 mln.


Orca


In 1999, the company announced the development of high-intensity white-LED
technology under a program called Orca. Gentex never announced a cost for the later-
mothballed technology development, but research and development expenses rose by
25% that year. In 2001, Gentex reported that some of the Orca lights had been installed
on a limited number of mirrors and sold. Equipment costs rose by USD 42 mln in 2000
and by USD 50 mln in 2001. The company now does not manufacture or sell LEDs and
yet it has never recorded any impairment to its investments.


In the 2001 Annual Report, Gentex told investors the company was offering exterior
mirrors with LED turning signals based on this technology. In that year, Gentex reported:


"... [W]e have built new clean-room facilities to house new microelectronics assembly
equipment that is capable of producing prototype quantities of LEDs.."
Gentex announced only one vehicle program that would pilot the Orca LED, the
Chrysler Sebring Couple. "Strategic discussions with potential alliance partners in the
automotive lighting industry, LED component industry and LED chip industry are
continuing although discussions are taking longer than anticipated, primarily due to
changing business conditions in the LED industry," the company reported in the 2003
10-K. By the time the 2005 10-K was published, Orca and the LED program had
disappeared.


ALS


Another technology that has come and gone at Gentex is "ALS," which stands for Active
Light Sensor, defined as an "intelligent CMOS light sensor to control the dimming of its
rearview mirrors," which GNTX started shipping at volume in 2002, according to its
reports. Again. The company never reported any specific R&D or equipment spend for
ALS, which it quietly stopped mentioning in reports. Currently, Gentex makes a range of
claims for its own CMOS chips used in a variety of imaging devices:


SmartBeam is the Company's proprietary high beam control system integrated into its
auto-dimming mirror. SmartBeam Generation 4, which was developed using the
fourth generation of the Company's custom designed CMOS imager, has an
advanced feature set made possible by the high dynamic range of the imager
including: high beam assist; dynamic forward lighting with high beams constantly on;
LED matrix beam; and a variety of specific detection applications including tunnel, fog
and road type as well as certain lane tracking features to assist with lighting control.
The Company believes it has a unique advantage in the automotive industry with
SmartBeam. The camera chip is designed by the Company specifically for certain
driver assist applications, with custom optics and algorithms written by the Company
and specifically tailored for its chip and optical systems. The Company packages the
control electronics inside of its interior rearview mirrors with a self-calibrating camera
attached to the mirror mount with optimal mechanical packaging which also provides
for ease of service.


We believe, however, that Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors are overkill for
the simple sensors that Gentex requires. In fact, light recognition sensors, extremely
simple and commoditized technology, have been used in Gentex's technology since the
days of its "photoelectric" smoke alarms.
Screenshot of a Gentex smoke alarm from eBay May 7, 2016


Microphones


During 2001, the company developed a new microphone designed specifically for use in
the automotive environment for telematics applications. The first volume Gentex
microphone application was part of DaimlerChrysler's "U-Connect (R)" telematics
system, beginning in 2003. During 2006, our proprietary integrated hands-free
microphone was available as part of an optional navigation package at Ford.


The China Plan


Among the growth drivers on which Gentex is depending in garage door opener remotes
in China. Unfortunately, there are no home garages in China. Gentex claims this does
not matter because its remote device will work with all the public and residential parking
lots in China.


On the Q1 2015 call, CFO Steve Downing said:


"One of the things we've been working on is introducing HomeLink in the China
market, and that includes getting compatibility in place with the garage door industry
and the active control industry in China. And over the next several years, we believe
there's a lot of opportunity for HomeLink penetration to grow in the China market."


China is a country of very fragmented parking where every housing compound has
guards and its own proprietary system where, for example, access has to be updated
annually. The cost of integrating all those systems, if it were possible at all, would be
prohibitive, and we doubt drivers would care. They generally have to pause for the
guards anyway.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/1/10/saupload_Image_3.png
The company seems never to have gotten traction in the China market with its mirrors,
so there is no particular reason why remotes should be a good business. Staff who
formerly worked at the Shanghai facility say that the volume of orders slowed down
considerably in 2013 and early 2014 prior to plant closing.


Audit Fees


According to a study by Audit Analytics looking at the audit fees paid by public
companies from 2005 to 2012, the average company paid about 0.08% of revenues for
its audit. According to an article that ran in CFO Magazine on February 26, 2015, citing
Audit Analytics, smaller firms pay more, averaging USD 5,000 per million in revenues.


Gentex is lucky in that its audit by Ernst & Young cost only USD 380,000 in 2015, up
from USD 342,7000 in 2014. That is 0.25% of revenue and much less than the USD
750,000 that the Audit Analytics standards would indicate for a company with USD 1.54
bln in sales in 2015.


The Ultimate Tell: The Cash


In 2014, the company issued a dividend equivalent to 100% of the share price, and yet
Gentex did not issue cash to its shareholders: the company issued one new share per
existing share, enacting in essence a share split. Management explained that this
method was more tax efficient. But the method also conserves cash.


Over the last five years, Gentex has reported average EPS growth of 30% and yet
dividend growth has been 7%. While the company does pay a dividend - a rarity with
companies we cover - the yield is just over 2%, which seems low when the company
reports such high profit and a conservative acquisition strategy. Gentex is sitting on USD
555 mln in cash, representing 25% of its total assets. Apple, perhaps the company in
the world that generates the most cash, has 18% of its assets in cash.


Original Listing


Gentex came to market in 1981 as a client of OTC Net, a penny stock promoter that was
closed later in the year under a barrage of SEC complaints. OTC was founded by a
Denver-based broker called Juan Carlos Schidlowski. In 1982, the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against Schidlowski with reference to the
Gentex IPO.
A 1982 article in Forbes magazine had called him "salesman of the year," heavily
suggesting that Schidlowski was a con man, and Schidlowski later fled the United States
rather than serve a jail term for stock fraud.


The case finding against Schidlowski finds him guilty of the following:


(1) Fraud in the purchase and sale of securities, (2) the sale of unregistered securities,
(3) bidding for or purchasing securities being distributed before completing participation
in the distribution, (4) aiding and abetting OTC Net in violating section 15(c) (3) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 15c3-1 by inducing or attempting to induce the purchase and
sale of securities while OTC Net's capital was less than the minimum required, and (5)
aided and abetted OTC Net in violation of the customer protection rule, the books and
records requirements, the preservation of books and records, reporting and notice
requirements.


Mickey Fouts, a manager at OTC.net, subsequently sat on the Gentex board for 20
years. Fouts was named in a 2010 civil case claiming unjust enrichment in real estate
speculation.[3]


When Gentex listed, it was a very different company, a manufacturer of smoke
detectors, principally for mobile homes, with about USD 5 mln in annual revenues. In the
company prospectus, Gentex discloses that in 1980, the year before the IPO, 79% of
sales, USD 3.4 mln, were made to one undisclosed customer identified as a direct sales
company. Interestingly, based on company disclosures, that customer spent USD 1.969
mln in the last quarter of 1980, as the prospectus was being prepared, compared with
an average of USD 850,000 in previous quarters.


SEC Correspondence


In letters in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015, the SEC has requested that
Gentex provide more detailed disclosure: as to the earnings of the HomeLink segment,
how goodwill and intangibles are calculated and amortized, how the compensation
committee works. In almost all instances, Gentex's response was "we already did that."
Here is one example of such a letter, from July 27, 2015; the full correspondence is
available on the SEC's EDGAR platform.


Why?



https://jcapitalresearch.box.com/s/e44h48h7s4mkel49yaqvk4p4yz9iu73b
Zeeland, Michigan, is a small community of 5,600 people, many of whom are of Dutch
origin and belong to the Christian Reformed Church. It is not a wealthy community
though it is pleasant, with a low cost of living and proximity to Michigan lakes.
Executives at the firm have personal use of a corporate jet and earn high compensation
relative to what they might achieve elsewhere, heavily weighted toward share
compensation.


Online reviews by anonymous employees writing in Glassdoor.com consistently said
Gentex's pay was below industry average and the company did not pay regular
overtime. Share-based compensation at Gentex averages about USD 20 mln per year, a
reasonable 6% of profit but a motivator for staff in small Zeeland, Michigan. Reviews for
competitor Magna Donnelley whose margins are less than half those of Gentex said the
pay was generous.


In November 2015, Chairman Fred Bauer sold USD 25 mln in shares.


We know that Gentex compensation is low by industry standards and that the company
relies on share compensation to make up for that. Stock-based compensation reported
in the 2015 cash flow statement was USD 21.4 mln, or 6.7% of net income, not Alibaba
(BABA)-style outlandish but still high.


Running this company is a great job if you can get it. At the time of the company's IPO,
Chairman Fred Bauer and two brothers held nearly 50% of the company's shares. Now
Fred Bauer holds less then 2% and the brothers appear to have sold out, yet Bauer
remains active as chairman of the company. The sell-down has made Bauer nearly USD
100 mln richer in just the last six years.

Catalysts


Where does this end? If Gentex is relying on share price appreciation to pay employees
and management, the company needs to keep beating industry growth and profit, as it
has done regularly for two decades.


That becomes more difficult if the real base in sales and margins is eroding. It is
especially hard in a very transparent industry like automotive components.
Gentex owns no intellectual property in the camera-enhanced mirrors that the company
says will bring in big ticket prices and high margins, and competition from companies
like Mobileye will make it tough for Gentex to make extravagant claims for the Full
Display Mirror. Meanwhile, with technologies like self-driving penetrating automobiles, a
garage door opener is a thin reed on which to hang a claim to superior margins, and
HomeLink's market advantage is rapidly being drowned by inexpensive telephone apps.
HomeLink is likely to go the way of Garmin and Tomtom GPS devices.


The wider promulgation of LCD screens in cars also makes the argument that the mirror
is a "platform" for technology much harder to sustain.


To cope with these headwinds, we are guessing that Gentex will start to announce
dramatic gains from the last large but opaque market, China. It may also make a large
acquisition. We figure one or both of those events will occur in the coming 12 months. In
China, Gentex says it will sell a lot of HomeLink devices modified to open gates at
private compounds and public parking lots, given that China has virtually no private
garages. We can state with a high degree of assurance that that is not practicable and
that Gentex will never be able to make high-margin sales in China.


As to an acquisition, perhaps of a company making toll-pass devices or self-driving
technology of some description, that may be a little harder, but if it happens, Gentex will
almost certainly report lifting the margins at the acquired company.


Company Response


Gentex IR has been open and generous with its time. However, after we provided it with
our initiation report, the company was extremely angered and vowed not to
communicate with us again. We find company management amiable but promotional.


Valuation


We value Gentex on a DCF basis. We estimate income growth of 10% for 2016, but
apply a 20% gross margin instead of the 40% that is reported. Other numbers in our
model remain as reported by Gentex, and we assume no new debt. Given estimates for
increases in interest rates, we believe our terminal WACC of 6.4% is generous and,
given current growth of the auto industry, terminal growth of 3% fair. Based on these
assumptions, we derive a share price of USD 9.10.
On a price to earnings basis, if we apply our estimated 20% margin, the model yields
net income for 2016 of about USD 110 mln. At the current 17x P/E ratio, the target price
would be USD 7.01.


Risks


· The mirror-embedded, RCD camera may prove extremely popular and have an
advantage over cameras displayed on auto LCD screens.


· Gentex may have industry value that we underestimate by virtue of misunderstanding
the automotive industry's purchasing dynamics.


· Gentex may be small enough to have created its own niche distinct from the rest of the
auto industry's dynamics.
