In an article titled "Beware this Chinese Export" featured in this week's Barron's magazine,
author Leslie Norton analyzed 158 Chinese companies that obtained their U.S. share
listing via reverse merger and discovered that the median company’s share price
underperformed the Halter USX CHINA Index by an astonishing 75% in the first three
years of trading, resulting in large losses for investors in these companies.


The USX CHINA index itself is down 15% in the three years ending August 27, 2010.
Losses to reverse merger investors are truly staggering, begging the question why anyone
invests in them at all. Fortunately, Leslie goes into great detail explaining all the problems
with these investments. Her analysis is in fact very similar to my own.


I have found that there are at least 12 predictive factors associated with the poor share
price performance:


1. Unscrupulous stock promoters behind the reverse mergers
2. Revenue disappointments and earnings restatements
3. Drastic divergence between financials filed with the U.S. SEC and Chinese regulators
4. Huge cash and shares fees paid to middlemen
5. Huge dilutive warrant shares granted to Preferred investors such as Pinnacle and


Barron
6. Auditors such as Kabani and Frazer Furth with very poor track records
7. Complete inability of the SEC to oversee firms with foreign operations
8. Lack of any oversight of the U.S. listings by Chinese regulators
9. Lack of due diligence by investors and bankers who often subsequently find the


Chinese operations don’t measure up to descriptions in placement offerings
10. Management theft and misuse of proceeds from share issuances
11. Complete inability of U.S. investors to recoup losses from unscrupulous companies


and promoters under U.S. and Chinese law.
12. Lack of any effective corporate governance


Among many companies mentioned in the article, recent notably poor performers include
OTC:CHNG, OTC:FEED, ONP, and OTC:RINO. The riskiest stock featured in
considerable detail in the article is China Green Agriculture (NYSE: CGA). CGA’s

investors suffer from nearly all of the 12 poor share price performance predictive factors
mentioned above. Additionally, as I mentioned last week, CGA is the subject of an
extremely negative and incredibly detailed due diligence report just released for clients of
the International Financial Research & Analysis Group (IFRA). The report exhaustively
documents in over 100 pages that:


1. Almost $15M VAT tax accrued by CGA over the past two years was never paid to the
chinese tax authority, which collected only about $68k cash. Moreover, why did CGA
accrue so much VAT when the law says they are exempt? This discrepancy exposes a
$15M hole in the balance sheet.


2. $2.8M corporate income tax CGA says it paid in calendar year 2009 was likewise
never received and recorded by the government authority. "Where did the money go?"
the report asks.


3. $10.7M CGA reported it paid for greenhouse land last September was overstated by
4X. Multiple official documents show only $2.5M paid resulting in another big hole in
the balance sheet.


4. For calendar year 2007 and 2008, SEC filings show Jinong sales of $14.8M and
$22.9M, but government records show only $6.6M and $7.8M. Chairman Li personally
signed off on both records. Chinese and U.S. accounting rules are slightly different, but
the discrepancy here is huge.


5. For calendar year 2007 and 2008, SEC filings show Jinong net income of $7M and
$9.7M, but government records show only $1.1M and $1.3M. Once again Chairman Li
personally signed both records.


6. CGA's U.S. auditor Kabani & Company has only one other sizable client in China
(LLEN); unfortunately Kabani used to audit Bodisen Biotech, which strangely enough
is based in the same high tech park as CGA in Xian. Bodisen was a huge scandal.
Kabani therefore can’t be trusted to do good work.


7. IFRA shows that the Beijing Gufeng acquisition price tag is outrageous. They calculate
the total cost could be $48M USD, pointing out that in addition to the $33M
cash+equity purchase price there is another $14.7M in working capital that CGA is
required to contribute to keep Gufeng afloat. Incredibly, according to Chinese
government filings Gufeng lost money in 2009 and only turned a small profit in prior
years. The acquisition price is insane. Where is the price paid really going?


Note: Scanned copies of the key sections of the IFRA report can be downloaded in
several pieces here.
