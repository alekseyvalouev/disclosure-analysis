Yesterday, Reliv International (NASDAQ:RELV) may have approached the end of its
California litigation. Reliv was accused of "failure to warn consumers that they have been
exposed to lead from several of the company's nutritional health products. Lead is a
chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other
reproductive harm." ~ Case: CIV1300429 Superior Court of the State of California


The notices of violation began in 2010. The complaint itself was filed in court on January
14, 2013, in a court action brought by Environmental Research Center ("ERC"), a non-
profit corporation. A proposed stipulated consent judgment was later signed by Reliv's
CFO and attorney. As usual, the defendant does not have to admit guilt. Nonetheless,
according to the proposed consent judgment, as signed by Reliv's representatives:


Civil penalties must be paid "pursuant to Health & Safety Code Section
25249.7(b)(1)"
A portion of the above penalty is to be paid to the office of Environmental Hazard
Assessment.

And most telling of all:


"Since receiving ERC's Notices of Violation, Reliv has revised the formula for all
of the covered Products to bring the lead levels in the Covered products that are
manufactured going forward to below 0.5 micrograms per day, the level at which
a warning would be required pursuant to Proposition 65." (Source: Proposed
Stipulated Consent Judgment)


How can one bring levels below a required limit without implying that one had been above
it?

According to the Marin County Superior Court Register of Actions, the judgment was
signed in court yesterday (8/14/2013).


Reliv claims to be a research-driven and nutrition-centered company. How does one
reconcile this with the recent litigation? For example, according to its 2012 10-K, Reliv
claims that its own "internal research and development team has developed most of [its]
products" and that its facility manufactures "substantially all of [its] nutritional products." If
those declarations were sincere, how could Reliv get into such difficulties? How could it
avoid responsibility? But then again, according to its SEC filed 10-Ks, Reliv spends less
