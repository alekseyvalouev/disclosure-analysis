Inuvo: Top Reasons This Stock Should Dive
Apr. 16, 2015 10:40 AM ET7 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


The CEO tells TheStreetSweeper that INUV board is considering a stock offering
now that the stock price is high.


The internet company's lifeblood - website traffic - has shown a striking decline for
INUV's key properties.


Net revenue fell in 2014; and the current share price of ~$3 already exceeds the sole
price target of $2.


INUV's price-to-earnings is about three to five times higher than its peers, while its
EBITDA is a fraction of the EBITDA of PERI and BCOR.


INUV's cash balance is low compared to debt. Along with weak institutional
ownership, this is yet another reason a stock offering makes sense.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Editor, TheStreetSweeper


Arkansas-based Inuvo (NYSEMKT:INUV) is working in a business that elicits the same
level of enthusiasm as, say, receiving a dinnertime call from a telemarketer or getting a
visit from a solicitor peddling a coat full of fake Rolex watches.


INUV and its peers have seen a lot of doors slammed on their businesses previously. And
this internet marketing and technology company could see more slammed doors in the
near future.


Let's look at INUV's background and then get right to the top reasons TheStreetSweeper
is watching for a decline in INUV's stock - likely below the $2 level.


Investors should also take a look at other viewpoints on INUV here.


Background


Recent hype that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Yahoo (YHOO)have
renewed deals with INUV are actually quite routine. Virtually all companies in this space
have a relationship with the two websites, though these relationships seem to change
rather often.

A big change occurred a few years ago in the toolbar business that was making millions
for INUV and others. The internet version of the solicitor banging on the door at
dinnertime, these toolbars automatically installed when you downloaded a video. A search
in the toolbar would be an INUV search, powered by Yahoo or Google. And the revenues
from ad clicks were shared by the toolbar vendor and the search company.


But Google made a small change that drastically dropped toolbar downloads. Bye-bye
searches with random Kim Kardashian rear-end pix popping up. Bye-bye key market
opportunity for INUV and peers.


So INUV transitioned out of toolbar downloads. The company now focuses on the digital
publishing business and building ads for other web publishers.


CEO Richard Howe told TheStreetSweeper that INUV works at keeping fresh, interesting
content in its properties focusing on health, finance, careers, travel and local interests. He
said,


On the ad tech side, the key there is really to build new and better ad units. These
would be ads that you see on the website when you go visit the website. You may
think they're ads that just sit there and don't do anything, but the ones that perform
the best have some sort of intelligence behind them.


A long-time analyst in this space offered a less romantic perspective. He said,


"At the end of the day, these are banner ads."


It's such a fast-moving space that it even sometimes gets ahead of INUV. In one slightly
awkward moment during the interview, we wondered about the "TastyNewDishes.com"
that INUV promoted in its February corporate presentation, on page 8, here. We couldn't
find it in our internet search.


"Sometimes publishers leave, right? So we may… need to revise the presentation,"
said Mr. Howe, noting someone else mentioned the same thing this week. "I've got
to go look into why."


Stock offering? CEO says, "It's certainly something that our board is now talking
about"


Mr. Howe told TheStreetSweeper that a stock offering has not been

Something we have contemplated up until now.


He said the board hadn't considered a raise before because they didn't want to cause
dilution since it wasn't necessary. He added,


It's not like we need the money.


Now that the stock price is rising, while we haven't decided to do an equity raise, it's
certainly something that our board is now talking about.


He wouldn't elaborate on exactly how soon a stock offering might happen.


Whether that means we'll do it or not, is a whole other story. And, like I said, we're
certainly not in any hurry to do it.


Striking decline in INUV's website traffic


The number of unique visitors, so vital to growth for companies like INUV, has shown a
stunning decline of about 50 percent for INUV over a year. See the chart below,
measuring the traffic to INUV's http://health.alot.com/website, according to the "Nielsen of
website traffic," Compete.com:

ALOT, www.alot.com, is one of INUV's primary owned and operated properties. But its
chart, too, shows the unique visitors number is significantly declining.

These charts clearly show, in our opinion, a dying Internet business.


*If business is so good, why are net revenues declining?


Look what has happened since Google's policy change. Net revenue has declined 10
percent year over year:


Gross profit grew slightly primarily because INUV cut some costs. But a company
generally can't cut its way into growing a business. However, INUV did see an
encouraging jump to $15.5 million revenue in the fourth quarter, but INUV also just
announced plans to move into a larger, more expensive building, which will add to
expenses and undoubtedly distract management in the process.


Additionally, INUV is plagued by a history of losses, anyway, according to the company
10-K:


We have a history of losses and there are no assurances that we can
consistently generate net income. Although we generated net income in 2014 and
2013, we have a history of net losses that have resulted in an accumulated deficit of
$119,088,552 as of December 31, 2014. We cannot provide assurance that we can
consistently generate a net income.

At the same time, investors must keep in mind INUV's history and the overall industry's
history. While Mr. Howe said the company works well with Yahoo and Google and has
been able to adjust, company filings note that the business remains at constant risk of
another advertisement policy change:


… they will from time to time implement policy changes that impact our ability to
display ads within our networks. Such changes may cause significant volatility in our
revenue and earnings. The loss of either of these customers would have a material
adverse effect on our business.


Shares exceed the price target


INUV shares are about $1 higher than the $2 price target set by the only firm that has set
a price target. That was just in February, and we've seen no update.


Weak institutional ownership


A strong company will attract strong institutional ownership. But investors can see that
INUV has generally fallen short in this respect:

Cash balance is low, especially compared to debt


At $3.7 million, INUV's cash balance looks low to us. It looks even worse compared with
the debt balance - which is $3.6 million.


According to the company's 10-K:


Failure to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our credit facility
could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our debt, which we
may not be able to repay or refinance on favorable terms. We have a credit
facility with Bridge Bank, N.A. ("Bridge Bank") under which we had approximately
$3.6 million in debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014…


We have historically had difficulties meeting the financial covenants set forth in our
credit agreement. Our lender has given us waivers in the past and reset our financial
covenants several times. In the event of a breach of our covenants we cannot
provide any assurance that our lender would provide a waiver or reset our
covenants. A breach in our covenants could result in a default under the credit
facility… our ability to conduct our business as it is currently conducted would be in
jeopardy.


The immediate point is this: This is another reason it makes sense to complete a capital
raise now.


EBITDA expectations "May be a little high"


Analysts may be a little too optimistic. Mr. Howe said trying to meet analysts' projected
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $5.3 million in
2015 certainly won't be easy.


Take a look at the chart below:

Mr. Howe said plans to rebalance stock-based compensation more toward cash this year
changes the cash flow part of EBITDA.


He told TheStreetSweeper,


The cash flow part of the equation has components that sometimes analysts get
wrong. So they may be a little high on the EBITDA number.


INUV stock is not attractively priced


Mr. Howe said,


We've always believed the company was undervalued relative to its peer group.


However, we disagree. Investors can see from the snapshots of charts below that, at
about 37 times earnings, INUV is three to five times overvalued when compared with its
rivals, Perion Network (NASDAQ:PERI) and Blucora (NASDAQ:BCOR). And look at
INUV's EBITDA of $4.2 million relative to PERI's $275 million and BCOR's $28 million.

Shares are trading too high


Overall, the stock has had no good reason to rush to ~$3. But we believe there are many
legitimate reasons for the shares to go screaming right back down to pre-rally levels.
