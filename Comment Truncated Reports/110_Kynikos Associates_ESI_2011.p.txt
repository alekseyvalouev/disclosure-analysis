Liquidating Trusts: Integrated Oil Companies (IOCs)


• Dead hand of government falls on new discoveries


– Brazil - only the government benefits from offshore development


– Russia – IOCs forced to sell assets to state champions


– US - Arctic permitting grinds to a crawl


• Costs climb while oil production stagnates


– Finding and development – $22/boe in 2010 from $5/boe in 2000*


– Production – $15/boe in 2010 from $5/boe in 2000*


– IOC liquids production declined in 2Q11


• IOCs switch to natural gas despite plummeting prices


– Sub-$4 natural gas is the new normal in the US thanks to the shale
revolution


– Race to secure land leases means uneconomical drilling continues


• Slow liquidation via cash return strategies

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM): Slow Value Leak?


• Capital and exploration costs consistently higher than expectations


– In 2006, upstream capital expenditure was $16bn; by 2010 it had reached
$27bn


– Guided 2011 capital expenditure climbs to $37bn versus $32bn last year


– Guided 2012-15 capital expenditure of ~$35bn/yr versus prior estimate of
~$28bn


– XTO purchase = expensive bet on natural gas


• XOM’s reserve replacement ratios (RRR) are not as good as they look


– 2010 RRR of 212% - 55% without the XTO purchase


– 2009 RRR of 230% - 82% if the definition had not been broadened


• XOM borrows to keep its buybacks going


– FCF after capex, acquisitions, dividends and buybacks is regularly negative


– $3.0bn in 2008, ($19.8bn) in 2009, $3.6bn in 2010, ($0.6bn) in 1H11


– XOM goes from net cash of $25bn (4Q07) to net debt of $6bn (2Q11)
