AmTrust Financial Services' Excessive Cost Capitalization Masks De
Minimis Tangible Book Value

Summary


WorldCom-esque cost capitalization, rather than “technology” drives low expense
ratio.


AFSI’s low expense ratio is key driver of AFSI’s high ROE.


Over-capitalized costs (DAC & prepaid) comprise vast majority of tangible book
value.


Reiterate price target: $0.


Introduction:


The bull case for AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) is predicated on the
idea that the Company has created a better mouse trap that allows it to report consistently
superior returns on equity ("ROE"), as it has since becoming a public company:


AFSI's consistency does not stop at high ROEs though. According to Bloomberg, AFSI
has only missed consensus earnings twice in the last 31 quarters (each by less than a
penny) despite the global financial crisis and an extended soft market that felled other
insurers who grew rapidly during that time, including Tower Group International
(NASDAQ:TWGP), Meadowbrook (NYSE:MIG), and QBE (ASX:QBE).


In "AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making" Part I and Part II, I
discussed my concerns about AFSI's accounting for Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives
and noted the troubling discrepancies between the financial statements of AFSI & Maiden
Holdings, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MHLD), which indicates AFSI may be over-stating earnings by
understating their loss ratio.

However, AFSI's understatement of loss and loss adjustment expenses merely keeps
AFSI inline with industry loss ratios, so it has required less explaining than their expense
ratio, which is anomalously low and a key driver of their high ROE:


AFSI management attributes their low expense ratio to superior technology, as AFSI's
CFO did at the JMP Securities Conference on October 1, 2013:


As I mentioned, technology is core. And it is a significant differentiator of us
when it comes to expense ratio, and we recognized early on that if we were to be
successful in focusing on these very small premium large volume of transactions
that we were going to have to create platforms that would allow us to underwrite
adjudicate claims in a manner that we felt was appropriate…


...And then once that decision is madeb we're quickly notifying the agents
electronically whether they have permission to offer a quote or whether we're going
to decline to offer a quote. Then once a decision is made to bind we're getting the
policies out within 24 hours. All of that is built by design and technology can't be
underestimated in terms of how it has helped contribute to our profitability or
our ability to control our expense ratio.


In reality, it appears AFSI is merely amortizing capitalized costs more slowly than it is
recognizing premium revenues ‒ in violation of the relevant accounting standards ‒ to
bolster reported profits, similar to what WorldCom did in the early 2000s before filing for
bankruptcy.


I estimate AFSI's over-capitalized costs are approximately $857.9 million ($332.9
million for DAC and $525 million for Prepaid Expenses & Other Assets). Removing these
un-spendable assets and other intangible assets reveals AFSI's tangible common
equity is approximately $0.39 per share before factoring in potential accounting
errors related to Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives and discrepancies with MHLD.

I. AFSI's Elevated Net DAC / Net UEP Ratio


Insurance companies pay insurance brokers commissions and incur other costs
associated with the acquisition of policyholders (i.e. when they issue policies). U.S. GAAP
allows insurance companies to capitalize the acquisition costs associated with policy sold
and amortize the costs over the term of the policy since the premiums (revenues)
associated with that sale are earned over the term of the policy (the "matching principle").


Because the costs and premiums are deferred and recognized over the same time frame,
insurance companies should have a relatively constant ratio of Net DAC to Net Unearned
Premiums, which is what we see for AFSI's peers in commercial lines and the warranty
segment of AIZ (in fact they declined due to the implementation of "successful efforts"
accounting for acquisition costs):


*Selective Insurance Group, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SIGI) large drop in 2011 is the result of the
adoption of "successful efforts."


**AIZ's "Solutions" segment primarily offers extended service contract and warranties,
credit insurance, and pre-need life insurance.


***ASU No. 2010-26 changed DAC accounting such that only costs associated with the
successful issuance of a policy are eligible for capitalization. Previously any cost
associated with efforts to issue a policy were eligible for capitalization.


In contrast, AFSI's Net DAC to Net Unearned Premiums ratio has risen meaningfully since
its public listing in November 2006 (at the same time that the Company's expense ratio
fell):

*AFSI's 2013 and 2014 Net DAC / Net UEP was depressed by acquisitions in which the
Company assumed net unearned premiums but did not recognize any corresponding DAC
(considered intangibles or goodwill when acquired).


II. Caught in the Lie?


Barron's highlighted the issue in a February 8, 2014 article titled "An Insurer's Feat:
Turning Losses Into Gains" by Bill Alpert. In response to Barron's questions about their
elevated DAC to Unearned Premiums, AFSI's management appears to have provided a
highly misleading response, which did not fool Mr. Alpert (emphasis added):


…The Company produced for Barron's a chart showing AmTrust's cost/revenue
deferrals ratio as 18% in the September quarter, around the middle of its peers. But
the ratios used by the company were actually an apples-to-oranges
comparison of net costs to gross revenues, in which the deferred cost
numerator was reduced by reinsurance commissions. However, the unearned
premium denominator was not reduced by the corresponding prepaid
reinsurance premiums. As we show in the bottom chart of the Post-IPO Prosperity
graphic, the proper net/net ratio makes a big difference for AmTrust. Instead of the
middle-of-the-pack 18% ratio it showed, AmTrust's net/net ratio for September's
quarter was 29% - some 10 percentage points higher than the peer average we
show.


Days later AFSI had come up with a new explanation to provide on the 4Q13 conference
call:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2656125-amtrust-financial-services-excessive-cost-capitalization-masks-de-minimis-tangible-book-value 5/12


Our deferred acquisition costs as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $440
million. DAC represents 16.5% of our gross unearned premium and 26% of our net
unearned premium. To be clear, our DAC is calculated with the requirements and
methodologies prescribed in ASC-944. The expenses we defer are those that are
specifically outlined in ASC-944 as eligible for deferral. To compare our DAC as a
percentage of either gross or net unearned premiums to peers is a difficult task. We
write multiple lines of business across varied geographies. Direct and indirect
acquisition costs vary by line of business.


For example, we have competitors in the warranty space that have DAC as a
percentage of unearned premium in excess of 40%. If you were to remove our
net DAC assets and net unearned premiums related to our US warranty, our
DAC to net unearned premium ratio would decline to 23.2%.


While a DAC to Net unearned premium ratio of 23.2% would be better, problems remain.
First, it implies period expenses are only 2-3% for the Small Commercial and Specialty
Program segments while peers and pre-MHLD quota share AFSI typically have 12-15%.


Second, the data from AFSI's SEC filings contradicts management's implied blame of the
U.S. warranty business. As the table below indicates, the percentage of AFSI's gross
premiums written that were attributable to U.S. warranty rose (fell) at the same time that
the consolidated Net DAC / Net UEP fell (NASDAQ:ROSE) in four of the last eight years
(highlighted in yellow below), indicating AFSI's increase in DAC cannot be attributed to the
U.S. warranty business because it is not directionally explanatory.


III. Accounting Rule & Proof of Likely AFSI Violation


The critical Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") that governs accounting for DAC is
ASC 944-30-35-1A, which states (emphasis added):



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROSE

https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/bean/fasb.html/fasb.944.2011.html

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/11/29115375_14153683076628_rId17.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2656125-amtrust-financial-services-excessive-cost-capitalization-masks-de-minimis-tangible-book-value 6/12


Acquisition costs capitalized under paragraph 944-30-25-1* shall be charged to
expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized under SubTopic 944-
605**.


*ASC 944-30-25-1: Successful Efforts


**SubTopic 944-605: Revenue Recognition


Furthermore, the existence of ceding commissions from Maiden Holdings, Ltd. should not
distort the analysis because ASC 944-30-35-64 states (emphasis added):


Proceeds from reinsurance transactions that represent recovery of acquisition costs
shall reduce applicable unamortized acquisition costs in such a manner that net
acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to net
revenue recognized.


In other words, companies are required to amortize Net DAC at the same pace that they
recognize Net Unearned Premiums (the matching principle). Since costs and revenues
must be deferred and recognized proportionately, one would expect the recognition of
costs (Amortization of DAC) as a percentage of previously deferred costs (beginning
balance of DAC) to be very similar to the revenues recognized (Net Premiums Earned) as
a percentage of the previously deferred revenues (beginning balance of Net Unearned
Premiums).


A good example of the accounting working correctly is W.R. Berkley (NYSE:WRB). Note
that the table below indicates the pace of recognition for costs approximates the pace of
recognition for the revenues (in fact, WRB has recognized costs slightly more quickly than
it recognized revenues in recent years), as it should be regardless of the policy type or
duration.


In 2013, WRB recognized Net Premiums Earned equivalent to 2.42x its beginning balance
of Net Unearned Premiums as the company issued new policies throughout the year that
were at least partially recognized. Similarly, WRB recognized amortization of DAC
equivalent to 2.45x their beginning balance in 2013 as the initial balance was expensed

and the acquisition costs associated with new policies were capitalized and began
amortizing proportionate to the premiums WRB recognized, as required by ASC 944-30-
35-1A.


In contrast, AFSI appears to violate ASC 944-30-35-1A because it is recognizing
previously deferred revenues more quickly than it is amortizing the previously deferred
costs associated with those revenues (the speed of DAC amortization is likely the side
that is wrong):


IV. DAC is the Tip of the Capitalized Cost Iceberg


As I noted in Section II, AFSI's Net DAC to Net Unearned Premium ratio has moderated
since peaking in 2010. However, the difference in the pace at which it recognizes costs
and revenues remains highly divergent, which does not pass the smell test.


I believe the most likely answer is that AFSI simply started putting the remainder into
"Prepaid Expenses & Other Assets." This ambiguously named line item has exploded in
recent years (exclusive of life settlements), rising from $97.0 million as of June 30,
2010 to $672.0 million as of June 30, 2014!


Note: I chose June 30, 2010 as the starting point because Net DAC / Net UEP peaked in
that period (at 43.3%).


Despite the enormity of this line item, there is no footnote or narrative disclosure detailing
these supposed assets. Furthermore, the size and growth of these supposed assets are
too great to solely be attributable to AFSI's service and fee businesses and they cannot be
other investments because that line already exists.


In light of the analysis in Section III, which demonstrates that AFSI's relative recognition of
costs and revenues remains problematic, I believe the logical conclusion is that they are
tucking those extra capitalized costs into "Prepaid Expenses & Other Assets." In addition,
the Company has not responded to multiple inquiries about the specifics of these
supposed assets.


V. Estimate of Necessary Write-Downs for Over-Capitalized Costs

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2656125-amtrust-financial-services-excessive-cost-capitalization-masks-de-minimis-tangible-book-value 8/12


The table below provides my estimate of the write-down AFSI needs to take for DAC. I
use AFSI's 2006 Net DAC to Net Unearned Premiums as a baseline because the
divergence began in 2007, which coincides with the start of AFSI's quota share agreement
with MHLD.


Further, I would note that the proportion of Gross Premiums Written that are attributable to
U.S. warranty in 2013 (9.9%) is between the amounts for 2005 and 2006 (6.0% and
11.6%, respectively; see table at the end of Section II), so there should be no meaningful
difference in the Net DAC to Net Unearned Premiums resulting from AFSI's U.S. warranty
business.


To estimate the write-down AFSI needs to take for what I believe are excess capitalized
costs within Prepaid Expenses & Other Assets, I use 2Q10 as a baseline. As discussed
above, 2Q10 marked the beginning of a significant ramp in Prepaid Expenses and
coincided with a decline in the ratio of Net DAC to Net Unearned Premiums.


To give AFSI the benefit of the doubt, I added $50 million to the baseline amount, which
implicitly assumes the service and fee business has receivables that correspond to ~90
day terms on a revenue base of approximately $400 million even though some of their
service and fee businesses are consumer oriented and not subject to credit terms.
