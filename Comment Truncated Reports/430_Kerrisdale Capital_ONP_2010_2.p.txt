Orient Paper: Key Pieces of Evidence for Fraud
Jul. 15, 2010 8:20 AM ET178 comments
by: Chinese Company Analyst


Over the past few weeks, there has been much discussion on fraud allegations involving
Orient Paper (NYSEMKT:ONP). The dialogue has been extensive. The original Muddy
Waters research report was 30 pages long, and they have issued several subsequent
pieces of commentary. The company, in turn, has submitted several responses to the
Muddy Waters allegations and has hosted a conference call. There have also been
several articles by the company's defenders on thestreet.com.


There has been a lot of information and keeping track of it has been difficult. The purpose
of this article is to highlight the several most compelling pieces of evidence to me that
Orient Paper is a fraud.


As I’ve written in previous articles and blog posts, I believe that Orient Paper is falsifying
its financial statements. There is substantial evidence for that, but I’ll focus here on 4 of
the most convincing points to me. I’ll exclude certain disputed items like the AIC filings,
where the company and Muddy Waters are in disagreement over whose copies are the
correct documents.


1. Top 10 Customers


Much of Muddy Waters’ research has focused on direct due diligence that they’ve done on
the company’s premises in China. Yet some of the most compelling pieces of evidence
that Orient Paper is a fraud comes from incriminating evidence that it has published in its
own SEC filings.


One of the best examples of that is in its 2008 and 2009 Top 10 Customers. Here are the
two lists, from the SEC filings:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/214639-orient-paper-key-pieces-of-evidence-for-fraud 2/65


Muddy Waters puts it well:


ONP’s 2009 top 10 customer list shows that it replaced 80% of the 2008 customers.
The strange item is that the minimum level needed to enter the top 10 lists stayed
constant at around $2.1 million. In other words, one could reasonably expect that
almost all of the companies who did $2.1 million or more in business with ONP in
2008 should do at least as much in 2009. But this was not the case, as eight of the
2008 top 10 customers disappeared. Yet, ONP did not lose any revenue. It grew by
56.5%.


The paper manufacturing business in China is highly competitive. First you have to
make the product. Then you then have to sell it. “If you make it, they will come” is no
less realistic in China than in the United States. Particularly when the product is
highly commoditized – such as paper is.


For a company to lose most of its top 10 customers and not have sales decline
requires significant effort by all throughout the organization. To lost most of its top 10
customers and still grow the company at 56.5% is a remote possibility.


And here is the company’s response:

Muddy Waters also accuses Orient Paper of churning and burning its top 10
customers and misrepresenting its sales volumes to these customers. Those who
have followed Orient Paper and studied the Company's 10-K and other financial
disclosures carefully over the past two years understand the following Company
developments. Almost all of the Company's top 10 customers are printing companies
that buy printing/writing paper. The Company traditionally has a large number of
small packaging plants buying its corrugating medium paper and very few, if any, of
them make to the top 10 list. Within the group of printing/writing paper customers,
significant changes in Orient Paper's product portfolio occurred in 2008 and 2009. In
2008, HBOP started producing writing paper, thanks to the 1760# Fourdrinier Multi-
Cylinder Production Line that was placed into service in March. In the Fall of 2009,
because of the skyrocketing cost of imported wood pulp, Orient Paper stopped
producing high-grade offset printing paper, which requires virgin pulp (rather than
recycled paper) as a major raw material. In an effort to push for a lower-priced
medium grade offset printing paper, the Company converted the writing paper
production line in September 2009 to concentrate on producing more medium grade
offset printing paper. As a result of these shifts in product offerings, the top 10
customer lists of 2008 and 2009 had very different compositions. Orient Paper had
more white paper sales sold to those customers who switched to the Company's
mainstream medium grade offset printing paper.


Orient Paper is a paper manufacturer. It operates a commodity business, and Orient
Paper doesn’t have any special technology over and above its competitors. As well, while
China is a faster growing economy than the United States, it is nevertheless competitive,
and paper demand isn’t growing at 50% a year. The Company can’t simply change its
product mix, replace 80% of its Top 10 customers and still grow revenue by more than
50%.


2. The Video


The visual evidence presented by Muddy Waters makes a compelling case that Orient
Paper is falsifying its financial statements. While the new digital photo lines provided in
subsequent pictures may appear somewhat professional, the main legacy production lines
shown in Rick Pearson’s TheStreet.com video demonstrate a business far smaller than
what the SEC filings indicate.


To best examine the visual evidence, it’s best to look at competitors’ plants, and then
compare those plants with the Muddy Waters facilities:

Competitors' plants:


See pages 14-17 of the Muddy Waters report available here


Orient Paper’s plant:


See Rick Pearson’s video here
See additional Muddy Waters pictures here


Based on the videos and pictures, Orient Paper’s main plant is of materially lower quality
than that of its competitors. The machines are old, run-down and appear incapable of
producing high quality paper. As well, the videos show substantial steam generated in the
facility, which conflicts with the company’s claims of producing high quality paper. Once
paper is exposed to water, it becomes no longer flat, and cannot be billed as high quality.


3. Muddy Waters’ Claims that the Company’s Top 10 Customers Could Not Have
Purchased As Much Product As ONP Claims They Have


In its report, Muddy Waters tried to contact each of the Top 10 customers that Orient
Paper lists in its 10K. Five were contacted or otherwise verified, and Muddy Waters lists
their phone numbers in its report. Any outside third parties can independently contact
them, given that Muddy Waters makes their contact information readily available.


Click here for the table where Muddy Waters documents its diligence on its Top 10
customers.


Based on its findings, Muddy Waters concluded that Orient Paper has fabricated its sales
figures to those customers. Five of the customers were too small to be able to buy the
volume of paper that Orient Paper claims it purchased from them. For instance, at a
company to which Orient Paper alleges selling $3.4m of product, the cleaning woman
answered the phone during business hours and was the only employee working. She said
that there were only a few employees at the business and all were part-time. Four of the
companies within Orient Paper’s Top 10 could not be found, had no website or had no one
answering the phones during business hours.


Only 1 of their Top 10 customers, Boading Huatai Printing Co. Ltd, was large enough to
theoretically purchase the amount of paper from Orient Paper that ONP claimed.


Here is Orient Paper’s response:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/214639-orient-paper-key-pieces-of-evidence-for-fraud 5/65


Muddy Waters has stated that it believes that "all but one of Orient Paper's top 10
2009 customers are too small (if they even exist) to buy the amount of product that
ONP claims they do." This accusation is false and Orient Paper believes that Muddy
Waters' methodology is inappropriate for establishing substantiation in a fraud case.
Business practices in China are different from those in the United States, where
many businesses are willing to reply to sensitive trade account confirmation given a
properly drafted written confirmation request from the trading partner and the
confirmation performed by legitimate third parties, such as auditors. Unsolicited,
improperly phrased enquiries are usually met with misleading or inaccurate results.
In addition, even in the U.S., auditors who perform written or telephone
confirmations must perform additional alternative procedures to get in contact with
the relevant parties to be confirmed before any conclusion can be reasonably made.
While Muddy Waters claims that they were unable to verify the existence of some of
Orient Paper's customers and made no effort to ask Orient Paper for assistance;
many institutional investors; investment banks, such as Roth Capital Partners; and
the Company's auditor, BDO Limited, have all performed due diligence on Orient
Paper's large customers and have confirmed and communicated with their selected
sample companies during the last twelve months. Among these parties, Muddy
Waters is the only one that claims Orient Paper is providing "false information" about
its top 10 customers.


Orient Paper’s response is basically twofold.


First, it claims that Orient Paper’s customers would lie to Muddy Waters about their size
because that is standard procedure in China. I doubt that’s the case.


Second, it claims that a variety of third parties have done the necessary due diligence on
Orient Papers’ customers. As I’ve previously written, BDO Limited has demonstrated an
inability to do proper due diligence in the past, given that it was the auditor of China Expert
Technology, which was a complete hoax. I would not rely on their work. The investment
banks working with Orient Paper are third-tier firms that have embraced Chinese RTO
smallcaps mainly because the sector generates a tremendous amount of investment
banking fees, not because the companies whose offerings they underwrite are real. As for
the institutional investors in ONP, I will not make an unwarranted generalization because a
variety of funds invest in Chinese RTO smallcaps, and they do so for different reasons and
according to different investment theses. But some of the funds that do proper on-the-

https://seekingalpha.com/article/214639-orient-paper-key-pieces-of-evidence-for-fraud 6/65


ground business diligence on Chinese RTO smallcaps like Orient Paper are indeed savvy
and have generated outstanding returns from the sector. But it hasn’t necessarily been
from avoiding frauds.


4. Further Inconsistencies within the SEC Filings


In addition to the unlikely 80% turnover within the Top 10 Customers, there are further
inconsistencies within Orient Paper’s SEC filings.


First, Orient Paper’s alleged inventory turns are extraordinarily high for a paper company,
and when compared with competitors. On page 25 of the Muddy Waters report, we see a
comparison of ONP’s inventory turns when compared to competitors. ONP’s 17x 2009
inventory turns is high for any manufacturing business, let alone a paper company in an
industry where its listed competitors’ inventory turns are 4x, 6x, 6x and 8x.


Second, as an additional blogger wrote in a post last week, if the company grew revenues
by 57% and earnings by 45% in 2009, why was its employee count 600 in both years? In
fact, an old video of Orient Paper (fast-forward to minute 1:46 of the video) says that the
company had 863 employees. If that’s true, how has revenue grown from $40m in 2007 to
$102m in 2009 while employees have actually shrunk 30%?


That blogger highlighted further inconsistencies. How did the company have a 37-member
R&D department that only cost them $30,130 in 2008? How did ONP more than triple
sales in 3 years while spending only a collective $655 (six hundred and fifty five dollars)
on advertising and promotion in those 2 years?


Conclusion


There is substantial additional evidence that Orient Paper is falsifying its financial
statements that I have not touched upon.


The company and Muddy Waters are disputing whether the SAIC financial statements
match the SEC financial statements. I also have acquired SAIC documents with the
personal seal of ONP chairman Zhenyong Liu, and may post them at a future date. Either
mine and Muddy Waters’ documents are falsified, or the ones recently submitted to the
Hebei AIC are falsified.


As well, I have not touched on whether ONP could theoretically purchase a production line
for $27m, when Muddy Waters has provided evidence that the most expensive highest
capacity 5.6m corrugating medium production line would cost less than $10m.
