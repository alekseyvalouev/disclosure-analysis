The Time To Short ParkerVision Is Now

On Thursday October 24th, a Florida jury awarded ParkerVision (NASDAQ:PRKR) $172.7
million in past damages in its lawsuit against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The jury also
found that there was no willful infringement which means that no multiplier can be added
to the damages award. However, not all $172.7 million judgments are created equal. With
92.4 million basic shares outstanding and 5.4 million options and warrants with an
exercise price below $1 per share, ParkerVision has 97.8 million diluted shares
outstanding. Based on the stock's last price of $2.81 per share, the diluted market
capitalization is an unjustified $274.8 million. This article will show why ParkerVision is
overvalued and should be sold short.


Even in a Blue Sky Scenario ParkerVision is Overvalued


To assess ParkerVision's fair value, we will start by looking at what it would be worth if
everything goes well for the company. ParkerVision was awarded $172.7 million before
lawyer's fees. McKool Smith took this case on partial contingency and our research
indicates that McKool Smith would be entitled to 25-40% of the award. We think
estimating a 30% contingency is reasonable. ParkerVision has accumulated
approximately $250 million in tax shields over the years due to operating losses. This
means that they will not have to pay any taxes on the award. In the chart below, we lay out
ParkerVision's take of the $172.7 million if they owe McKool Smith 30%.


In addition to the payment for royalties in arrears, it is also likely that ParkerVision will be
awarded royalties going forward since Qualcomm is likely to continue shipping chipsets
that have been found to infringe ParkerVision's patents. U.S. Mobile Phone Shipments
appear to be approximately 177 million per year based on the average of 2011 and 2012
shipment numbers (here) and actually shrunk in 2012 relative to 2011. According to

Forbes, Qualcomm has 86% market share in LTE modems (here), so we think it would be
accurate to estimate that ParkerVision can collect royalties on 152 million chipsets per
year. According to testimony from Qualcomm's experts during the trial, a design around
would take at least three years, so we will conservatively estimate that ParkerVision can
collect royalties for the next five years and that after that Qualcomm will have
implemented a design around and no longer need to pay royalties to ParkerVision.


Now that we have established ParkerVision's royalty base, it is important to consider the
royalties that are likely to be awarded. During the period covered by the $172.7 million
infringement award, Qaulcomm shipped 751 million infringing chips, so the average
royalty per chip was $0.23. We believe this is a reasonable assumption for a go-forward
royalty. Lastly, we must consider ParkerVision's corporate expenses that will need to be
paid during the period in which it collects royalties. In 2011, before the lawsuit began in
earnest, ParkerVision burned approximately $12 million, so it would be reasonable to
assume that the Company can return to this burn rate from 2012's elevated rate of nearly
$16 million. We can now calculate the value of ParkerVision's royalty stream:


From the above, we can conclude that the total value of the lawsuit to ParkerVision is
about $1.88 per share. At the current price of $2.81, that implies that $0.93 per share or
about $91 million of value is being attributed to ParkerVision's ability to win future lawsuits
against other companies or to commercialize its D2D or D2P technology. This seems
much too high to us because during the Qualcomm trial we learned two important facts.
First, Jeff Parker said under oath that he did not believe any other companies were
infringing his technology. Second, Jeff Parker also stated that over 100 companies had
evaluated ParkerVision's technology and no one other than Via had licensed it. Given
these two facts, we see little incremental value in ParkerVision's technology or patents.

Examining the Downside


Our above valuation of $1.88 per share, or 33% below the current price of $2.81 per share
is a blue-sky valuation that assumes ParkerVision doesn't experience any further setbacks
in its lawsuit with Qualcomm. This assumption, however, is fraught with risk. Appropriately
risking Parkervision for the litigation with Qualcomm shows that a fair value for
ParkerVision is only $0.97 per share or 65% downside from today's price. Below, we will
examine the obstacles that ParkerVision must survive to actually be worth $1.88 per
share.


First, there are two very important outstanding judgment as a matter of law (JMOLs)
remaining before Judge Dalton. One JMOL concerns Nash bargaining. Those who have
read the documents in this case know that Judge Dalton has shown some concerns about
allowing Nash bargaining as a way to determine damages. ParkerVision used Nash
bargaining to justify their damages request and the judge allowed the jury to use Nash
bargaining theory to help determine what ParkerVision would be awarded in damages.
While it is unclear how much the jury relied on Nash bargaining to come up with their
award amount, they must have relied upon it somewhat because the amount awarded is
not plausible based only on damages testimony from Qualcomm's expert. If the judge
ultimately rules that Nash bargaining should not have been used, he may reduce the
award and future royalties to reflect an amount that excludes Nash bargaining theory. If
Nash is excluded, we believe that the damages and royalty would both decline by about
80% to more closely resemble the damages suggested by Qualcomm's expert. We
believe there is about a 10% chance that Nash is excluded.


The second important JMOL relates to the findings of the jury. While Qualcomm was found
guilty to have infringed on 20 products, detailed evidence was only presented for 1
product. Dr. Prucnal, an expert for ParkerVision, testified that the products all worked the
same, so if one infringed they all infringed. However, no evidence was shown to prove that
this was true. The judge may decide that not enough evidence was shown on these 19
counts and throw all of them out. In fact, one product will almost certainly be thrown out. If
we look at the jury verdict form (here), we see that one product, Marimba, which both
parties had agreed to leave off the form (here) was kept on and Qualcomm was found to
have infringed on that product. At the very least, infringement on this one product should
be overturned. A ruling to exclude infringement on 19 of the 20 products would greatly
reduce the damages number, most likely by about half, but the future royalty would not be
affected. We believe there is a 20% chance that the finding of infringement for 19 of the 20
products is disallowed.

In addition to surviving the JMOLs, ParkerVision must also prevail in the appeal that
Qualcomm plans to pursue. We know Qualcomm is appealing because Christine Trimble,
a spokeswoman for Qualcomm has been quoted as saying, "We will direct our efforts
toward addressing the post-trial process and preparing our appeal." At an appeal, a
variety of things can happen including a reversal on all or part of the decision, the case
gets remanded to another jury if they find reversible errors, or ParkerVision can collect the
damages and royalties they have been awarded. From the Markman transcript (here), we
know that federal courts find district judges wrong roughly 50% of the time in Markman
rulings. Since ParkerVision won almost every point in the Markman, if the Markman does
see changes, those will inevitably be negative for ParkerVision. In fact, the federal courts
could decide to reverse many key points of the Markman and remand the case back to the
lower courts, which would lead to a new trial. If this takes place, it could be 5+ years
before ParkerVision's case finishes because you would have not only a new trial, but if
Qualcomm lost, a new appeal. The federal circuit could also overrule the lower court on
appeal and come to a variety of other findings, including that Qualcomm did not infringe or
that the damages award should be lowered. We believe there is a 40% chance that either
the verdict of infringement or the finding of patent validity is reversed.


Importantly, each of these three risks is independent of the other, which means that we
can calculate the probabilities of each outcome as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1786482-the-time-to-short-parkervision-is-now 5/11


From the above probabilities and values, we can calculate an expected value of
ParkerVision stock of $0.97 per share or about 65% below today's price.


Some Final Thoughts


The path to a final outcome is not likely to be kind to ParkerVision's shareholders as we
envision significant dilution over the next two years while the appeal is being heard. The
company ended the second quarter with $13.7 million in cash and available for sale
securities. They subsequently did a dilutive offering after the quarter ended which had net
proceeds of approximately $13 million. This brings the on hand cash total as of August 7th
to $26.7 million. With a judgment now in hand, ParkerVision likely owes some money to
McKool Smith. When a case in taken on contingency, bonuses are built in as lawyers are
not going to wait years to see how the appeals process plays out. These bonuses get paid
regardless of what an appeals court does in the future. We believe that McKool has
already been paid their bonus for a successful Markman and is now owed a bonus for the
verdict. If McKool even gets 33% of the $51.8 million they are entitled to, that would
equate to $17.1 million. This reduces cash on hand to under $10 million, before even
considering the cash that has been burned since August. Since royalty payments will be
delayed during the appeal process, a cash burn of around $12 million a year means future
equity raises are necessary. Along with needing money to run the business and fight
Qualcomm's appeal, ParkerVision will need money to fight the Maxtak lawsuit, in which
they are the defendant. Our guess is that ParkerVision does not put the Maxtak
documents on their website like they do the Qualcomm documents, because in this
instance it is ParkerVision who is being sued. According to the ParkerVision 10-Q, the
plaintiffs are, "alleging common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation of material
facts concerning the effectiveness of our technology and our success in securing
customers." This case is currently scheduled to go to trial on February 2, 2015.


Some bulls argue that the judge may place an injunction on Qualcomm's chips. We feel
there is a near zero percent chance of this happening. During the injunction hearing, Jeff
Parker admitted that ParkerVision does not have a working chip right now and that a
working chip may not exist even by the end 2014. Even if ParkerVision had a working chip
at some point in 2014, there would still be the issue of manufacturing them. Qualcomm
provides 86% of the chips to the cell phone market and the fact that ParkerVision does not
have an alternative means an injunction would only serve to throw the cell phone market
in disarray. Since the judge must believe an injunction is in the public good for him to grant
one, we do not see the judge making a ruling that would throw the cell phone market into
disarray.
