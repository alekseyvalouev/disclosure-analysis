Digital Ally: Why This Movie Will End Badly

Summary


National interest is in police body cameras, not DGLY’s old technology.


TASR owns the market; DGLY revenue from old technology will continue to erode.


TASR's product is superior to DGLY’s body cam.


Police wearable video segment is highly competitive; DGLY is already too far behind.


DGLY stock at about $19.50 is not sustainable.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Digital Ally (DGLY) stock has soared over 386 percent amid calls for cops to wear body
cameras following the Ferguson, Mo. police officer shooting of an unarmed teenager.
DGLY took advantage of an unbelievable run in the stock for a small raise, a heady but
ridiculous action in light of how short DGLY falls below others in the industry.


We've seen this movie before and we know there is absolutely no justification for the
stock's crazy run from about $3.80 in one astonishing month to today's nearly $20.


Here are TheStreetSweeper's top reasons we believe this DGLY movie will end badly:


1. National interest is in police body cameras, not DGLY's technology. The old dash
cameras - DGLY's key product - are not even part of the national conversation.


"The recent emergence of body-worn cameras has already had an impact on policing, and
this impact will only increase as more agencies adopt this technology,'' said Chuck Wexler,
executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, author of a recent report on
the use of police body cameras.


Yet, the in-car video recording system constitutes 90 percent of DGLY's already falling
revenue and rising operating losses of about $1 million.


2. Old technology = falling revenue.

DGLY's in-car video revenue will likely continue to erode due to superior, cheaper body
cameras offered by well-known vendors such as stun-gun maker Taser International
(TASR), a profitable company up 43 percent since Ferguson to $17 plus change.


CNBC's Jim Cramer said police wearable video will likely become the new normal and that
market is owned by Taser.


Wearable cameras provide superior video footage that provides up-close and point-of-
view, non-tamper recording compared with in-car video.


At $399 Taser's Axon is 10 times cheaper than DGLY's $4,000 dash camera.


Indeed, DGLY's old technology is clearly already feeling the pressure. Describing the
company's decline in gross profit, its last quarterly filing said:


"However, we are experiencing increased price competition and pressure from certain of
our competitors that has led to pricing discounts on larger contract opportunities. We
expect that this pricing pressure will continue as our competitors attempt to regain market
share and revive sales and that it will have some negative impact on our efforts to improve
gross margins during 2014."


3. Police wearable video is highly competitive, so we believe, DGLY is already too far
behind.


The money-losing DGLY doesn't even make the rankings in a Google search for "police
body worn camera."


Here's a sampling of what investors will see:


Taser (TASR)
Martel digital
bodycameras.com
Vievu
policeone.com
wolfcomusa.com
Panin
BodyCam


4. Taser's product is superior to DGLY's body cam.


TASR battery life is 12 hours. DGLY battery life is 4.5 hours.

DGLY product is chest-level mount. TASR eye-level mount prevents view from being
blocked by officer's arm when shooting.
TASR is price leader, more attractive purchasing plans, profits from subscription
services.
TASR AXON Flex is $599, AXON Body is $399. Offers $50/month ongoing
maintenance, 3-year replacement and Evidence.com subscription. Yet DGLY FirstVue
price is $900.
DGLY intends to introduce a bullet camera that is not new, as evidenced by a simple
search for "helmet camera" or "glasses camera." Its weak brand, combined with a tiny
sales force will get the DGYLY product shot down by police tech suppliers such as
TASR.


5. DGLY pales in key cloud video management solutions compared to TASR. The
complexity involved is described by New York Police Commissioner William Bratton in the
Wall Street Journal:


"This is an extraordinarily complex initiative. It is not simply going down to your local
RadioShack, buying one of these things, and putting it on," Mr. Bratton said. "The storage
issue is phenomenal."


TASR's Evidence.com gives TASR the edge as it also profits from subscription services.
The feature offers third-party storage, security, powerful video search and scanning, all
elements important in court evidence. Yet DGLY requires local data storage, requiring
scarce police department IT personnel's management of voluminous video data.


6. DGLY stock at about $19.50 is not sustainable. As excitement wanes,
TheStreetSweeper believes the horrible fundamentals will set in on top of the other
negatives and investors will have to pull out the handkerchief as this movie winds to a
close.


Here are some financial highlights:


Continuing drop in earnings per share over two years. A 99 cent loss prior year turned
into a current $1.14 loss.
Net income collapsed by 1376 percent versus last year, or from minus $0.07 million
versus the current figure of minus $0.99 million.
Return on equity significantly down at -64 percent, well below the industry.
Net operating cash flow dropped to minus $0.6 million, nearly 500 percent.
