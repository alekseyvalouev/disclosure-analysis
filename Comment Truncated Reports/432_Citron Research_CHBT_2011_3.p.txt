CHINA BIOTICS
(NASDAQ:CHBT) – THE
BEST RESEARCH YOU
HAVEN’T SEEN.


   Citron Reprints Forensic Research
that shows China-Biotics is lying about
their customers and production.


 


 


The market is now brimming with stories on the
fraud in the China RTO space.   We are witnessing
the unprecedented reality of more than a dozen
companies domiciled in China and trading on
major US exchanges, to be halted by regulators and
now queued up for delisting.

  Brief History Lesson


Long before this space became crowded with
investigative researches trying to hunt down the
needlelike facts in the haystack of hype that is
smallcap investing in China, Citron was there.   In
fact, we would like our new readers to appreciate

that in May 2007, Citron broke the story about its
first China-domiciled stock scam.  


Xinhua Finance Media Limited (NASDAQ:XFML)
apparently had pretty good credentials too. 
Brought public via the “high road”, an IPO by JP
Morgan and UBS in March 2007, XFML was a $12
to $14 stock with credibility, analyst coverage, and
a bright future.   Its CEO rang the opening bell on
the Nasdaq when its IPO opened.   The only
problem was it was a complete scam, as reported
by Citron in May 2007.

Yes, there was much umbrage taken.   Analysts
such as JP Morgan and CIBC reiterated their buy
recommendations on the stock, with CIBC calling
the situation a “good buying opportunity” on
“weakness” in the wake of the Citron report.

Although the stock slid into single digits, interest
perked up when no less than Yucaipa Funds, led by
highly regarded investor Ron Burkle, announced in
September 2007 that it was taking a major equity
position in the company.

By the end of 2008 XFML was a penny stock.  It
had cratered not because of Citron’s report, but
because it was, as Citron reported, a collection of
self-dealing and related-party rollup transactions
designed solely to enrich its promoters and scam
investors.


Yesterday, criminal indictments were
handed down, charging the principals
involved with stock fraud.

For the rest of the lesson, readers compare the
original Citron report in May 2007 (linked above),
with the Wall Street Journal article published
yesterday.

  Current Situation


Today, Citron revisits a stock first reported last
September, the curious case of China-Biotics
(NASDAQ:CHBT).   Now China-Biotics isn’t a high-
prestige name taken public by Wall Street’s finest. 
In fact they lost support of all of their analysts.


Nothing the company has said about its
operations, either then or since, has
checked out.   


In the interest of the truth, Citron understands that
good research comes from many different sources.
With permission of the publisher, Citron today
shares a forensic research piece written by a firm
specializing in on-the-ground research in China
called China Economic Review.  We believe this is
the best piece of research on China Biotics that you
probably have never seen.

The last line of defense separating the continued
fleecing of US investors in these names is the
company’s annual audit.   And that brings us to the
flurry of halted stocks in March, because that is
when those companies’ audits were due.  China
Biotics is on a March 31 fiscal year, so it and a
batch of other companies don’t face their day of


judgment until June 15th.  Next month, Citron
predicts investors will see another flurry of news
and stock halts, as the next wave of this story hits.
