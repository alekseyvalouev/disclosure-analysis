Guns, lobbyists, poachers and owl hunters: Northern and
Voyager Oil and Gas weekend edition
I wondered whether I was boring people when I reported posted on Northern Oil focusing on such
mundane issues as whether it was appropriate for the CEOs wife to be working for a company whose
main purpose is to buy assets from Northern Oil. That stuff is important - and I have more of it
coming. 
 
But when the people are this colorful you got to focus a little on the people if only to keep reader
numbers up. 
 
So this weekend post is to put the color back into the story. 
 
You see Northern and its sister company Voyager Oil are run by boys straight out of central casting.
Northern is the larger cap of the two companies – Voyager the later edition. But they are run by
brothers had overlapping people involved in their foundation and assets that are core to Voyager were
once owned by Northern. They really are sister companies. 
 
Some photos and a good story 
 
The first photo is of Michael Reger (the CEO of Northern Oil) with Shawn Vasell. Vasell shot the deer. 
 


 
 
It's a great photo of a fine kill – but the details behind the photo are a much better story. Vasell was at
the time a Washington identity. Maybe an identity known only to the most ardent Washington
watchers – but still interesting. You see he was a staffer to Conrad Burns and then Porter Goss and
then Spencer Abraham – all well known Republicans. He then went to work for Jack Abramoff the
lobbyist who plead guilty to defrauding Indian tribes and corrupting public officials. Vasell took the fifth
in the Congressional inquiries into the activities of Team Abramoff.

The photo also caused ructions. The deer it seems was shot out of the window of a pick-up (illegal
unless you are disabled), on private land without the landholder's permission and the Regers and
Vasell trespassed to claim the kill. Poaching charges were laid. JR Reger (now the CEO of Voyager
Oil) plead guilty and received fines and a six month suspended sentence. Vasell admitted to one
count of hunting without a license and another count of hunting on private property without
permission. In his plea agreement, two other charges of violations of big game laws were dropped
and he avoided possible jail time. The charges against Michael Reger (now the CEO of Northern Oil)
were dropped as part of the plea agreement made by his brother. 
 
All this came about because of a boasting article about the hunt on James R Reger's personal
website (once at www.jrreger.com). You can find a copy of the hunting article here. The website has
now been scrubbed but some political junkies kept a copy just because well – it was so funny. (Unless
you were the judge who described it as “disgusting”.) 
 
And so it is that generally James Reger is more colourful of the Reger boys. I mean what other oil
company CEO keeps a Facebook fan's page which consists mostly of tales of him doing non-CEO
type things. This is his profile picture: 
 


 
 
But its the old jrreger.com website that is most amusing. After all he accuses his brother of misleading
people about game he has killed. See this photo.

James captioned the photo as follows: “Pictured above is Michael Lewis Reger posing before some
game that our Cousin Trisha shot. Personally, I have a problem with people who take pictures in front
of game other people have killed, he does this a lot.” I will let you decide the ethics. 
 
But hey – as far as I know claiming Cousin Trisha's kill is not illegal. Poaching is. And there is a
reason why JR Reger got a suspended sentence – which is that it was not a first offence and he was
so blatant about law breaking. His old website carried the following paragraph: 
 


Every Monday morning I look forward to reading the paper. Moreover, I look forward to
reading about one of my delinquent friends or acquaintances getting into trouble with
the Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. For the fine amount paid, and trust me on this
one, the amount of good press you get from doing something wrong is totally worth it. I
highly recommend poaching a little or doing something minor to get your name in the
paper at least once a year.


You can understand the judge – probably a stickler for the law – didn't much like it. Also the same
page boasted about prior offences (both his and offences of friends). This was my favorite: 
 


James R. Reger, 27, October 6, 2001. Guiding two out of state hunters on an Owl hunt.
$250.00 bond forfeited. Lying to the game warden by saying slain Owls were actually
wild turkeys. $125.00 bond forfeited. Hunting and trapping privileges suspended until
the cows come home.


Commentary: I'm an Owl hunter, what can I say?


 
So now we got it straight: convicted criminal (poaching, suspended sentence), lies to government
officials (game wardens), hangs around with suspect lobbyists (Vasell and others on Team Abramoff),
owl hunter and public company CEO. 
 
Oh, and accuses his brother (also a public company CEO) of misleading people about big game he
shot. 
 
And that is your weekend postcard from the boys running Northern and Voyager.
