euglena (2931):  
a One-Trick Organism Without Fuel for Growth 
 
 














The Crux: 





Crude prices plunged in the last 2 years and are 
not expected to return to peak levels for many 
years, making algae-based biofuel – the premise 
for the co.’s future growth – uncompetitive at 
least until 2020. The co.’s plan to set up 
commercial-scale biofuel production has already hit a delay while its only profitable unit is 
running out of market to expand into. Recent stock falls of U.S. peers indicate co.’s equity will 
come under intense pressure in the near term. Meanwhile, major domestic manufacturers have 
come in to challenge co. in algae farming.

Executive Summary 
 


o euglena’s business is based on cultivating the 
eponymous single-cell organism for use 1) as an 
ingredient in health foods and 2) as feedstock for 
making algae-based biofuel.  


o Co. has two operating segments: Healthcare and 
Energy & the Environment (E&E). The former brings 
in 99.9% of the total profits but, we believe, faces a 
near-term slowdown as company is now a large player 
in its niche and Japan’s market for health foods & 
supplements has sub-2% annual growth. The co’s big 
selling point, the novelty of its product, has faded. 


o Major domestic manufacturer, Kobelco, has entered algae-based food market and says it’s 
already lining up clients. Growing risk that more players with larger resources will enter the 
market, which will increase competition and crimp margins. 


o Co. declared it has not filed a patent for its technology to cultivate large volumes of micro-
algae. We believe this opens up the co. to losing any technological advantage it used to have 
and note that U.S. rivals are already in front and commercializing their product. 


o Manufacturing costs of algae-sourced biofuel are $300 to $1,000 per barrel of crude oil 
equivalent. The industry could hardly compete with crude at its peak of $147 per bbl in 2008. 
It certainly can’t compete now, which puts the future of co.’s E&E segment in grave doubt. 


o In Dec. 2015 co. unveiled a 5-year target to begin manufacture of biofuel for jets in 2020. Just 
eight months later it announced that construction of a test facility, needed to confirm the 
technology’s viability, is running a year behind schedule and won’t be ready until the first half 
of 2019. This renders the 2020 target unattainable. 


o U.S algae market leader TerraVia Holdings Inc. has announced a shift away from biofuel to 
value-added healthcare & food products because of the inability to compete with crude oil. 
TerraVia saw its stock fall 90% on crude price declines – a sign of what euglena equity faces. 


o Even if co. manages to operate at its best-ever profit margin of 15% and hits the FY20172 
target of ¥15 billion in annual revenue, we estimate its operating income at ¥2.25 billion and 
net income around ¥1.6 billion. Ignoring the drag on co.’s value that should be ascribed to 
the E&E segment, we value euglena relative to similar Japanese health food and supplements 
companies. Based on a premium PE multiple to that peer group (30x), the co.'s share price 
comes out at ¥580.  


o Even if we fully incorporate the co.’s achievement of latest mid-term targets into the current

Euglena is a single-cell micro-


organism that has the 


properties of a plant and an 


animal and lives in fresh and salt 


water. It uses photosynthesis to 


generate oxygen. Oil stored in 


the euglena body produces a 


fuel that’s similar to diesel. 


Euglena is used for algae 


(seaweed) based products.

share price, we should expect profitability to remain the same as the current target for 
FY2017 (4.6% = NP ¥0.69 billion / Revenue ¥15 billion). This conservative assumption gives 
a fair price estimate of ¥500 per share (Based on: Market cap of ¥41.4 billion = Revenue ¥30 
billion x Profitability 4.6% x PER30). These estimates imply a 55% to 60% downside risk.

Full Discussion 
 
 
1. euglena’s Growth Strategy 
 
According to a Nov. 18, 2013 board meeting, the co. business strategy is based on the 
development of two directions. In the Healthcare segment, it is focused on using euglena as an 
ingredient in health foods. The Energy & the Environment (E&E) segment aims to cultivate algae 
for use in biofuel, particularly for aircraft jet engines. On this basis, in 2012 the company raised 
¥7.6 billion in a public offering of new stock3. 
 
As of October 2016, the same two were listed as co.’s main businesses on its website with no 
sign of a change in strategy. Thus, we believe it is appropriate to analyze and value the co. 
based on these two segments: Healthcare and E&E. 
 
 
2. Healthcare Segment 
 
 A) Where the Co. Says It’s Heading 
As of October 2016, the Healthcare segment accounted for 99.97% of total revenue and E&E 
for the other 0.03%4. From that it’s fair to say that valuing the Healthcare segment is akin to 
valuing the whole company.  
 
According to the co. results presentation for FY2014 (See Figure 1 below), the co. plans to 
expand the market for euglena food products to ¥30 billion, its annual revenue to ¥15 billion, 
and annual operating income to more than ¥3 billion by 2018.

(Source：euglena presentation)5 
 
Figure 2 below shows the sales and growth rates of the Healthcare business. From it we can 
see that the co. grew quickly in the last 4 years. If we take the view that this segment posted 
¥11.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ended Sept. 2016 (FY2016) the co.’s ¥15 billion 
target for fiscal year ended Sept. 2017 (FY2017) seems reasonable. However, can we really 
expect this pace of growth to continue? As we’ll explain later, new players with more resources 
are entering the market which we expect to lead to greater competition for market share. We 
are likely then to see the co.’s profit margins decrease as it seeks to fend off new entrants from 
taking over its positions.

 B) Losing Luster Amid Saturation in the Market  
According to a survey by Intage Inc., Japan’s market for healthcare foods and supplements is 
estimated at about ¥1.6 trillion6. In recent years, the annual growth rate of this market has 
averaged less than 2% (See Figure 3). That shouldn't be surprising. The number of health food 
and supplement consumers is already estimated at some 57 million people, or one in every two 
Japanese.

So, it’s fair to say that the Japanese market has entered maturity7. Then, how did euglena attain 
quick growth in such a market?  
 
We think the main reasons were as follows: 
- Novelty factor: euglena-based food products drew interest because they were completely new 


- Feel-good PR message: euglena rode the wave of publicity that touted its main ingredient as a product 
that could solve humanity’s energy and food issues 


 
However, with consumer trends changing quickly, since the emergence of euglena a host of 
other superfoods and super-fruits have hit the Japanese market, retailing both via high-end cafés 
and juice bars and mass-consumer products in supermarkets and convenience stores. Having 
been around for a few years, euglena can no longer count on its novelty value. The health and 
eco-conscious consumers that supported the brand now have more options. 
  
Let’s consider the size of the niche that the co.’s health foods and drinks occupy and their 
position in this market. A co. investor relations official said8 in a 2013 interview that the 


                                                
7 In fairness, at the same time Intage Inc. estimates that the current size of Japan’s health foods and supplements market will 
eventually expand by 2.2 times to ¥3.5 trillion. However, at current pace of growth this level won’t be reached for more than 
30 years. For the sake of this analysis, we believe this has no impact on current share price and can be overlooked.

Japanese market for the very popular aojiru9 health drink was in the region of ¥50 billion, while 
the market for products from chlorella, another member of the algae family, was worth about 
¥30 billion. Since a representative of the co. named these as the nearest competitors for 
euglena products, we can use the figures to construct a rough outline of the size of this niche.  
 
Using the general market growth rate for health foods and supplements in Japan, we estimate 
that the size of the market in which the co.’s products compete is in the region of ¥90 billion to 
¥100 billion. In which case, euglena’s ¥11.1 billion annual sales for the fiscal year ended Sept 
2016 account for over 10% of the niche. That makes the co. one of the biggest players in its 
field. It’s unavoidable that as a major player, the co. will not only struggle to grow at the same 
rates as before (In fact, euglena itself admits the slowdown of the growth as it sets its revenue 
target for FY Sep. 2017 at ¥15 billion, which means only 35% growth while euglena achieved 
87% growth on its revenue as of FY Sep. 2016) but will also need to fight off competition from 
new market entrants. We see co. margins in the Healthcare segment shrinking as a result and 
overall growth slowing as a result of product saturation in this field. 
 
 C) New Players With Larger Budgets Enter Market 
Even if the market for algae and other plant-based juices and snacks matures, we could see the 
co. generating steady cash flow from current offerings as long as there isn’t a big increase in the 
number of competitors. However, that scenario does not seem likely as companies who have 
no relation to health foods or food of any kind are turning their attention to this market. The 
maker of environmental equipment, Kobe Eco-Solutions Co. Ltd. (short-name: Kobelco), a unit 
of Kobe Steel Ltd. and a major manufacturer in its own right, in November 2015 announced 
plans to enter the food business specifically through the manufacture and sale of euglena as a 
food raw material10. The company, which has developed its own technology to produce algae 
that does not rely on photosynthesis and is therefore not constrained by weather conditions, 
submitted a notification of its intentions to the Public Health Center in Kobe. The authorities 
issued a certificate to Kobelco acknowledging receipt of the notice, which means the company 
can go ahead with plans to build a facility for euglena cultivation. Kobelco, which claims that its 
system is 250 times more efficient than photosynthesis-based euglena farming, also said at the 
time of announcement that it has already earmarked customers for its product11.  
 
New rules passed by Japan in the last two years lower the bar for companies to be able to 
claim that their products have health benefits. As of a year ago (Oct. 2015), 120 applications 
for new so-called “functional” foods had been filed with the Consumer Affairs Agency of which 
43 came from companies that had never made food before. Among those are Nippon Paper

Industries Co., the country’s No.2 paper maker, which is marketing seedlings for a new tea 
variety the company says helps control cholesterol, and textile firm Omikenshi Co., which is 
mixing pulp with the yam-like konnyaku plant to offer fiber-rich flour that supposedly contains 
no gluten, fat and little carbohydrates12. 
 
This shows us that the co. is facing domestic competition from better-capitalized players with 
more well-known brands and broader sales networks as companies seek to jump on consumer 
interest in healthier foods. We expect more rivals to emerge in the next few years. As the co. 
can no longer benefit from being promoted in the media as a new fad, we believe its battle will 
be largely to retain, as opposed to grow, market share.  
 


D) No Patent Protection 
Normally, in order to defend itself against competition from well-established firms that have 
much larger resources a startup will take out a patent to protect its technology. This is what 
euglena13 has to say about applying for patents: 
 


 
TRANSLATION: 


Q: Are you seeking to patent the technology for mass cultivation (of algae) 


A: We are not seeking to patent it. In order to apply for a patent, you need to write down in detail 


exactly how the cultivation process works, which will lead to it becoming public. Even if someone 


started to cultivate similar algae to us, we would not be able to confirm that it was being produced 


with the help of our cultivation technology. In that sense, we are adopting a strategy of concealing 


our information and not pursing patents. It’s similar to the way Coca Cola acted in regards to 


safeguarding its ingredients and manufacturing secrets. 


 
As such, euglena happens to be the claimant or rights holder to just 11 patents (in Japan), not 
one of which is related to the mass cultivation of algae. In such a situation, the co. has no legal 
protection should it be judged to be a monopolist because its technology.

13 company website, Frequent Q&A section, https://www.euglena.jp/ir/faq.html
10	
 


Meanwhile, if you look at the philosophy outlined in the co.’s Q&A, you have to wonder: Is the 
concealment strategy actually working? Is it protecting the co. from the competition? Clearly 
not, as Kobelco’s case shows. A number of U.S. firms, which we’ll discuss in detail later, have 
even gone further and succeeded in commercializing their process. 
  
Today, the co.’s technological superiority in the field can be said to be under serious doubt. It 
might be true that in 2005 the co. was the world’s first to develop technology that could 
cultivate algae outside of the lab in mass quantities. Yet in the 10 years since evidence 
confirming euglena’s technological superiority has been thin on the ground14. All of which 
suggests that, like Kobelco, large manufacturers can enter the algae food materials market with 
relative ease. While it may be true that the co. was the one who created the market for 
euglena-based products, more powerful players seem to be able to come in and exploit it. 
 
Therefore, even if the co. achieves its revenue target of ¥15 billion, it faces two major threats: 
the slowdown in growth rate due to market size limitation and an intensification of competition 
due to new market entrants with large capital, which will cause a drag on profit. 
 
3. Energy & the Environment (E&E) Segment 
 
While the co.’s Healthcare segment has grown earnings rapidly in recent years, there is a death 
knell ringing for the core E&E segment. This makes it impossible to justify or even vaguely 
fathom how the co. trades at more than 150x PE multiples. In the past, the co. stressed that 
the E&E segment – through the manufacture and sales of biofuel for use in jet engines – will 
drive and accelerate future growth. But, is that still a realistic prospect? 
 


A) Crude Oil Price Tanks; Algae Costs Do Not 


Let’s be honest here, as unfortunate as this may be for the environment the co.’s E&E strategy 
has no chance of taking off without the drying up of global crude oil reserves.  
 
First, let’s look at the current cost of algae-sourced biofuel production. Industry participants and 
independent analysts give a pretty wide range of figures, yet they all sit within $300 to $1,000 
per barrel of crude oil equivalent15. In fact, when Bloomberg News featured the co. and its 
founder Mitsuru Izumo on TV and in print last year, analyst Clair Curry from Bloomberg’s in-
house New Energy Finance research bureau pointed out that as of 2015 the industry’s 


                                                
14 For example, in the April 17, 2015 press release euglena announced the start of a research facility in the U.S. There have 
been no further updates on this venture or its results.  
15 Consider the following reference materials: BioFuels Digest magazine, Oct. 2014 issue (referenced in bibliography on p. 2 of 
the Japan Petroleum Energy Center report published March 15, 2016 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_fuel#cite_note-Steiner-134 
  “GreenFuel Technologies: A Case Study for Industrial Photosynthetic Energy Capture”, 2007, Krassen Dimitrov, Ph. D.
11	
 


manufacturing costs are at least three to four times higher than they should be for algae-mixed 
fuel to be competitive. To challenge or even approach crude oil and alternative fuels, algae 
biofuel needs to drop to $2 per gallon16 from a current industry average of $7 to $15 per 
gallon, Curry told Bloomberg TV17.  
 


The U.S. Department of Energy is slightly more lenient. In a March 2015 policy paper produced 
by its Bioenergy Technologies Office, the goal for algae-based fuel is set at $3 per gallon of 
gasoline equivalent. At that level, the DoE agency believes algae-based fuel can compete with 
gasoline derived oil that costs $75 to $90 per barrel. So, when does the DoE believe this will be 
achieved? The report lists a 2022 deadline for validating demonstration technology for algae 
feedstock that can operate at the desired $3 per gallon level18.  
 
Exxon Mobile Corp. is a little more critical of algae’s prospects. This is despite, or maybe 
because of, a major $600 million initiative the oil major embarked on in 2009 to make algae-
based biofuel a commercial reality within a decade. When the oil major “downscaled” the 
program in 2013, then CEO Rex Tillerson said algae-sourced fuels may still be 25 years away 
from mainstream success. 
 


The cultivation process of most algae farmers is sensitive to weather conditions and open tanks 
deployed to grow the organisms are prone to contamination. As a result, algae production 
suffers from high capital costs with the price of equipment, fertilizer, electricity, and labor all 
increasing in recent years. Meanwhile, the price of crude oil has fallen since 2010.

Figure 4: WTI Crude Price Graph 





(Source：Bloomberg) 


 
As of January 2017, WTI traded in a range of $40 to $60 per bbl. As a result, not only biofuels 
but other alternative sources such as shale oil and natural gas have struggled to compete. The 
outlook for crude oil through 2020 from sources such as the International Energy Agency, the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration, the World Bank and numerous think tanks and 
institutes points to a continuation of this price trend. Crude is seen as unlikely to break out of 
the $60 to $80 per bbl range19. The idea that a fuel that has production costs of $300 to 
$1,000 per bbl can somehow compete with crude in the next 5-8 years is hard to fathom.

Algae-sourced biofuel is not the only fuel hoping to take over from conventional oil. While it is 
true that profitability of shale oil depends on its mining area, Figure 6 shows us that more than 
half of U.S. shale assets sit in the $40 to $60 per bbl range. What’s more, we’re seeing more 
shale properties move down the cost curve, evidenced by the fact that output from this sector 
is rising even with crude oil trading at $40 per bbl. If shale deposits can deliver crude oil for 
similar prices to conventional wells we’re going to see a depression in crude prices continuing. 
And all the while, the costs of natural gas, solar energy and other alternatives keeps declining. 
We believe the dim prospects for algae biofuels should be reflected in the co.’s stock price. 
Currently, the outlook for the E&E unit seems to assign it a massive premium compared with 
other Japanese health food providers that don't have ambitions in biofuel. We believe this 
makes no sense given the outlook for and current economics of the E&E business.

B) Technical (and Confidence) Issues 


The question we have is whether even the co. believes it can achieve commercialization of 
algae-based biofuel. Recent co. statements suggest there is growing internal doubt. 
 
Take as example the co.’s press release from Dec. 1, 201521. In it the co. makes a spectacular 
announcement that it will commercialize algae-based jet fuel by 2020. The plan is predicated on 
the construction of a small demonstration facility that will come online by early 2018. Less than 
a year later, on Aug. 12, 2016, the co. announces a delay to the plan. Now, euglena says that 
the ¥3 billion demonstration facility, which can produce just 125 kiloliters of certified jet fuel a 
year, will not become operational until the first half of 2019. That makes the original goal of 
achieving commercial-scale production by 2020 completely laughable.  
 
To put the scale of the demonstration plant in context: Its entire output, based on a standard 
90% kerosene / 10% algae-based biofuel mix, would be enough for a single airplane to make 
one return flight between Tokyo and Osaka once a week, according to the estimates from 
ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline firm, and a potential buyer of euglena’s product22. 
 
In recent press releases, the co. often touts the achievements of its RealTech Fund, a venture 
that has nothing to do with biofuels. On its website, the co. also added the following statement: 
“The future of this business is not only dependent on whether it can realize the biofuel 
project.” (See paragraph 2 below). Could it be that the co. is preparing the ground to exclude 
biofuel development from its long-term business strategy?

TRANSLATION:  


Outlook 


• This company’s focus area is on research of ways to bring down the cost of cultivating large quantities of 


euglena. Even though we tie up with companies that specialize in each specific area in order to realize our 


plans of manufacturing different products, we’re not actually increasing our research costs proportionately with 


every new area and market that we enter. Accordingly, from a profit standpoint, we’re actually bringing down 


research & development costs. 


• The future of this business is not only dependent on whether it can realize the biofuel project. To that end, 


we’re creating several markets so that even if for the time being we’re unable to commercialize biofuel we can 


“Create new markets” and “Improve margins in markets we currently operate in”. In other words, it cannot be 


said that all our investments in the Energy & the Environment segment are driven by our need to make 


progress in the 5Fs of our strategy. 


• Since crude-oil based products, such as fats and fuels, are subject to regulations on their emissions, before 


reducing production costs to compete with market prices we could bring forward the production schedule 


based on changes or moves in those regulations. 


 
What should be most worrying for investors is the fact that E&E was not only billed as a core 
contributor to future earnings, but also as the co.’s most profitable area. See the 5F product 
pyramid that euglena has on its website. The co. explains that its strategy has five blocks, which

are ranked by unit price. Fuel has the lowest price relative to weight, while Food (the only 
current bread-winner) has the highest. Based on this explanation by the co. itself, it seems that 
the co.’s earning expectations for the foreseeable future rest on its highest-cost business. And, 
as discussed earlier, that means there’s little hope of profit growth.

Basic Strategy: The 5 Levels of F in Biomass (Food, Fiber, Feed, Fertilizer, Fuel) 





There are a multitude of applications to which you can put algae/seaweed, which is a biomass. The ability for 


them to be implemented depends on the unit price of sales. We rank the applications based on price of unit, 


from the higher-price at the top to the lower-price at the bottom. This strategy we call the 5 levels of F. 





Specialty Area: Healthcare： 


Functional food 


Cosmetics materials 


Materials for medical goods, etc. 





Commodity Area: Energy & the Environment 


Chemicals 


Materials for combination feed
17	
 


Materials for fertilizer 


Oil for construction materials 


Biofuel for jets, etc. 


 
Interestingly, the strategy presentation is also misleading in terms of what the co. says it is 
relying on to expand profit. First, investors are told, using jet fuel and animal feed sectors as 
examples, that “products which become commoditized take on the form of goods that can be 
generally traded at market prices. So, the requirement for a new player to enter the market and 
be able to compete is to create a lower cost base.” Two pages later, the presentation shows 
the rapid growth of “revenue” (not profit) in some uncertain future while profitability is 
designated in the lowest category (see table above for “The 5 Levels of F in Biomass (Food, Fiber, Feed, 
Fertilizer, Fuel)”). 
 
In addition, the co. says that: “Since crude-oil based products, such as fats and fuels, are subject 
to regulations on their emissions, before reducing production costs to compete with market 
prices we could bring forward the production schedule based on changes or moves in those 
regulations.” As you saw in the “Outlook” translation above, the meaning here is that even if 
the production schedule were brought forward due to changes in regulation – which would 
imply that profitability remains low since production costs were not lowered enough to 
compete with market prices – the effect would be a rapid expansion of revenue but not 
necessarily of profit. The company admits that it is still unknown whether profit would grow to 
match the revenue expansion (whenever in the distant future that happens to happen). 
 
The above reads as a tacit admission that the co. does not see algae-derived biofuel challenging 
traditional fuels on market terms. So, should investors hope that changes in regulation will make 
euglena’s E&E business implementable24 instead of waiting for the co. to deliver a competitive 
product? If so, why would euglena benefit more than peers? And, how much equity value does 
one assign to potential changes to legislation?  
 
One thing that we can say looking at such statements is that the co. is not projecting 
confidence in its ability to compete in the market. 
 
 3) Powerful Rivals at Home, Stock Crash Examples Abroad 
Let’s for a minute indulge in the co.’s dreams of algae-based biofuel being a viable competitor 
to traditional fuels. Would this leave the co. as the only beneficiary, picking up steady profit? 
 
In Japan alone, those seeking to commercialize the manufacture of algae-based biofuel include

heavy industry giant IHI Corp., electricity wholesaler and utility Electric Power Development 
Co. Ltd (also known as J-Power), the Toyota Motors-backed components maker Denso Corp., 
and pigments and resins major DIC Corp. All four target production of jet fuel, as shown in the 
table below that was put together by Japan’s semi-governmental New Energy & Industrial 
Technology Development Organization (NEDO). Of the four, at least Denso and IHI have 
stated similar aims to euglena of reaching commercial output around the start of the next 
decade.

Denso in 2010 set up a plant to cultivate algae 
known as pseudochoricystis at its Zenmyo Plant 
in Aichi Prefecture. The aim is to mix algae 
extracted liquid with gas oil petroleum. The 
capacity of the Zenmyo pond is 33,000 liters. 
The company is preparing a bigger cultivating 
site in Kyushu and seeks to be technically ready

IHI registered its botryococcus algae-based oil, Mobura, 
as a trademark in 2013. The company began in March 
2015 large-scale algae growing at a cultivation pool in 
Kagoshima Prefecture. By May, it reached its harvest 
target. The pool, the largest in the country with a 
surface area of 1,500 sq. meters, is about 15 times the 
size of IHI’s previous facility. IHI is also experimenting 
at other sites, including in Southeast Asia. It aims to 
establish the technology for large-scale production by 
fiscal year ending March 2021. (Source: Nikkei) 


State-backed Algae Biofuel Project 


Another key Japanese project in creating commercial-scale production of algae biofuel by 2020 is being led 
by the University of Tsukuba. Established in 2010, the partnership of Tsukuba, Tohoku University and the 
Ibaraki Prefectural government has started to produce botryococcus algae, which grows at the same rate as 
euglena but produces a hydrocarbon similar to heavy fuel oil B, the kind normally handled by Japanese 
refineries. Tsukuba expects to move from an output of 14 metric tons of oil in 2015 to 14,000 tons in 2020.

Overseas, the U.S. alone has a history of algae-based biofuel research spanning more than 30 
years. Despite the many twists and turns of the U.S. algae sector a number of ventures have 
now emerged and are showing good results, including in commercial-scale facilities.

The list above is nowhere near exhaustive. It is simply to illustrate that U.S. companies have 
worked in this field for dozens of years before euglena was founded. Many of these companies 
have faced massive technological and financial challenges, yet some have progressed as far as 
mass-scale cultivation of algae, expansion of operations abroad, and the ability to demonstrate 
their product effectiveness in target markets.  
 
Despite all of that, with the big drop in crude oil prices, they have seen interest in their product 
diminish. Exxon Mobile scaled down on its initial plans for algae-based fuel production less than 
12 months before crude oil prices started falling and has not come back to the sector with 
anything like the enthusiasm it showed in 2008-2009. Coincidentally, that was around the time 
when crude oil peaked at $147 per bbl. 
 
This may be history repeating itself as with the oil crisis of the 1970s. No matter what results 
TerraVia and Sapphire Energy delivered, they simply could not offer a competitive product 
once crude oil prices started heading south again. Sapphire Energy, in February 2015, said that 
its cost of production was $26 per gallon27, which is $1,000 per crude oil barrel equivalent. This 
is why these companies, which have a strong history and research background in biofuels, 
nevertheless are shifting to value-added goods in the food and healthcare industry – the same 
space that euglena sees as its jumping-off point.  
 
What happens to algae farming companies that focus on biofuels? Let’s look at the stock price 
of TerraVia, one of the few larger listed entities in the sector. In Figure 12 you can see the 
moves in equity versus the price of WTI crude. At the time of listing TerraVia traded at $27, 
but since August 2014, when crude started to tumble, so did its stock. TerraVia now trades 
around $2 per share – a 90% drop.

TerraVia’s stock move is evidence that investors don't see the development of algae-based 
biofuel production as realistic and directly hints at what can happen to the equity of a company 
counting on this sector as a core business. 
 
In summary, the future of euglena’s E&E segment looks highly troubled. High manufacturing 
costs versus energy alternatives, delays in project implementation, and a lack of patent 
protection, as well as a seemingly fading conviction in its own ability to deliver, cloud the 
chances that euglena can commercialize a biofuel product that is competitive and that can 
deliver an earnings boost. When you see rivals in the U.S. already ahead of the co. in terms of 
commercialization, and you note that some major biofuel players are shifting away from the 
industry, it’s impossible to assign any positive value to euglena’s E&E segment. In fact, we believe 
once the market fairly assesses the conditions of the business it will downgrade the E&E 
segment to reflect its negative value to euglena shareholders.  
 
We point to TerraVia’s equity story as a harbinger of things to come.

4. Valuation 
 


1) Massive Gap in PE Multiples With Similar Firms 


As of Jan. 17, euglena traded at a price to earnings (PE) ratio of about 150, which is way 
beyond the PE ratio (of 10x to 27x) that companies with a similar business profile enjoy (See 
Figure 9). We believe the premium valuation reflects not only decent results in the Healthcare 
segment but also future expectations for the co.’s algae-based biofuel business. 
 
As outlined earlier, we believe the Healthcare segment has likely peaked as Japan’s market for 
health foods and supplements is already mature and sales growth rates are declining. What’s 
more, the entry of major industrials with larger resources, sales networks and brand awareness 
into the same market threatens the co.’s growth and profit margins. 
 
Rather than being a catalyst for future growth, we believe the co.’s E&E segment brings down 
the net equity value. The business is not competitive and cannot be expected to provide any 
significant earnings in the next 5-8 years due to the current crude oil price environment and 
outlook, as well as the cost basis for producing biofuel with algae. Given how far out potential 
profit from the E&E segment lies, we believe euglena should at best be valued solely on the 
basis of its Healthcare division, which accounts for 99.97% of earnings.

Under the most bullish scenario we can imagine as of today, euglena maintains the highest 
profit margin of the last four quarters – 15%, recorded in 2Q16 – and achieves its annual 
revenue target of ¥15 billion. If that is the case (which is a big “if”) we estimate the co. will post 
a yearly operating profit of ¥2.25 billion28, and assuming non-operating profit, costs and 
corporate tax rate don't change dramatically, an annual net profit of ¥1.6 billion or ¥19.36 per 
share. (In this calculation, we don’t take into account subsidy income that accounts for most of 


                                                
28 In the co.’s earnings target for FY2017, the revenue target is 15 billion, OP target is 0.82 billion, Ordinary 
Profit target is 1.1 billion and the NP is 0.69 billion.
24	
 


the current non-operating revenues. Our assumption assumes a NP that is more than double 
the co. target of ¥0.69 billion for FY2017. See Figure 10 for a summary of co. financials.) 
 
As we believe only the co.’s Healthcare business has positive value, we look to Japanese makers 
of similar health food and supplements to provide the PE multiples for a peer comparison. 
Figure 9 shows that domestic peers trade at PE ratio in the range of 8 to 27. We take a peer 
group premium 30x multiple and apply it to the estimated best-case scenario ¥1.6 billion net 
income. That gives us a market value of ¥48 billion or ¥580 per share. 
 
Secondly, according to the co.’s latest mid-term business targets, the co. claims it will achieve 
¥30 billion revenue by 2020. However, based on the stock options (SO) plan linked to the 
target, the strike terms for this 6th SO plan have Ordinary Profit target at ¥1 billion from 
revenue of ¥30 billion, which is surprising given that the strike terms for the 5th SO plan saw 
Ordinary Profit at ¥1 billion from revenue of ¥15 billion. Clearly, this shows management 
themselves are not confident in the profit growth through 2020.  
 
In addition, the co. admits in the latest plan that the profitability of its new business segments 
outside food business will be lower. Therefore, we can conservatively assume the NP ratio for 
target revenue of ¥30 billion would be the same as that of the ¥15 billion revenue target. 
Hence, NP ¥0.69 billion / Revenue ¥15 billion = 4.6%. Under this assumption, even if we fully 
incorporate the achievement of the mid-term business targets by 2020 into the current stock 
price, we believe that a ¥41.4 billion market cap (approx. ¥500 per share) should be 
reasonable price for this company. This is calculated as follows: Revenue ¥30 billion x 4.6% 
profitability x PER 30. 
 
Even though our calculation is based on the most bullish scenario imaginable and revenue 
numbers that euglena does not expect to hit for another four years, the numbers still come out 
with a market capitalization that is approximately 55% to 60% lower than the current one.  


 
2) Potential for Stock Plunge 


If, as we expect, the market takes cue from TerraVia, and turns skeptical on the viability of 
euglena’s plans for biofuel in the short- to mid-term future, resources deployed by the co. on 
E&E will be seen as value destructive. Then, we expect the stock to drop lower than ¥500-580. 
 
Whichever way you look at euglena’s business, it is grossly overvalued. We believe the market 
will in the near future revisit its assumptions on the co.’s business and future potential, which 
will put considerable downward pressure on the stock.
