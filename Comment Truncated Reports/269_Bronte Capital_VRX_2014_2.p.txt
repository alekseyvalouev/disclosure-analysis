Valeant Pharmaceuticals Part II: GAAP and non-GAAP
accounts
In Part 1 I introduced Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its business model which is to acquire
pharmaceutical companies, strip them of their research expense and earn very high gross margins on
sales. 
 
This has become a hugely successful stock, however you could not tell by looking at the GAAP
accounts. Here is the P&L for the last five years, latest on the left, courtesy of Capital IQ.

It is that net income line at the end that sort of gets you. There are losses in all years
except 2011 and large and increasing cumula�ve losses. The $866 million loss in calendar
2013 is a surprising number. 
 
The losses are not quite so bad on an EPS basis because of a massively increasing share
count, but these are hardly typical of a company with such a rapidly increasing stock price. 
 
The losses however are net of vast "merger and restructuring charges", "asset
writedowns" and "legal se�lements" - so called "one-offs". 
 
In 2013 merger and related costs were $923 million, asset write-downs a further $783
million and legal se�lements were $192.5 million. These amounts cons�tute well over 100
percent of the loss recorded. 
 
Net of these costs earnings are going up very nicely. The company ac�vely encourages you
to look at it this way - and the market has adopted that guidance (as reflected in the stock
price). 
 
Moreover this is precisely how they present it in analyst conference calls. Here is a slide
from the 4Q 2013 conference call:

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Part II: GAAP and non-GAAP accounts


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2014/06/valeant-pharmaceuticals-part-ii-gaap.html 3/5


Posted by John Hempton at 11:36 AM  


 
 
Note that the cash EPS reported ($6.24 per share profit) is considerably more a�rac�ve
than the GAAP EPS (a loss of $2.70 according to the press release or Capital IQ). 
 
And herein is the rub. Do you want to believe the GAAP EPS (in which case this company is
a loss-making disaster) or do you want to look through the GAAP EPS and see what
management directs you to, their defini�on of "cash EPS"? 
 
In other words do you believe in the GAAP accounts or some non-GAAP accounts? 
 
There is another way of saying this. To believe in the GAAP accounts you need to believe
that the "one-off" charges are reasonable and truly one-off. [They are truly vast - so this
ma�ers.] 
 
There is a possibility that the whole Valeant exercise is something from the Wizard of Oz.
Profits are going up nicely if you pay no a�en�on to that man behind the curtain - the man
being the large restructuring and one-�me items. 
 
It would be an awful for investors if Valeant made its ferociously profitable budgets by
pu�ng any unwanted expenses (recurring or otherwise) into the "one-off" bucket. 
 
And this is where we will start our long examina�on of Valeant. We want to work out
whether the one-off charges are reasonable (in which case this is a great company) or
whether they are inflated (in which case this is a Wizard-of-Oz-style con-on-the-market). 
 
Till next �me. 
 
 
 
 
 
John
