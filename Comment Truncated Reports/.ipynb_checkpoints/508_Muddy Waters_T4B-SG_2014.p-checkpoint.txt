5/21/2018 Sino Grandness’ shares “worthless”, says report; company refutes | The Edge Markets

battered this week after a report made its rounds on the Internet alleging that


the company’s earnings had been in�ated.


According to the report, dated Sept 4 and seen by The Edge Singapore, Sino


Grandness’ �nancial statements have been “materially misrepresented” and


that its share price o�ers “a compelling short opportunity with a return


potential of nearly 100%”.


The author of the report was not named but was identi�ed as a member of


the Value Investors Club with the moniker ‘newman9’. The club is an online


site founded by US hedge fund managers Joel Greenblatt and John Petry of


Gotham Capital. Members are required to submit at least two trading ideas a


year and rate 20 ideas posted by other members.


The report took aim particularly at the company’s Hong Kong subsidiary


Garden Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Beverage Co, which Sino Grandness is


seeking to list in order to comply with the terms of a convertible bond


agreement, failing which it would be required to pay a hefty penalty to


bondholders.

5/21/2018 Sino Grandness’ shares “worthless”, says report; company refutes | The Edge Markets

Garden Fresh Fruit had issued in 2011 RMB100 million ($20 million) worth of


zero-coupon bonds that can be converted into Sino Grandness shares.


Initially due in October this year, the convertible bonds will now mature in


June after majority of the holders agreed earlier this month to extend the


date.


Citing third-party sources such as Euromonitor and Nielsen, the Value


Investors Club report said Garden Fresh’s reported sales of RMB1.38 billion


in 2013 were “signi�cantly” overstated. The Garden Fresh brand is not found


on the list of leading juice companies in China compiled by these research


�rms, according to the report, which noted that the 23  such company


ranked by Euromonitor had only RMB77 million in retail sales.


“We believe that if and when regulators, underwriters, analysts and investors


inevitably scrutinize this data, they will see a company materially overstating


revenues which will most likely derail the IPO,” the report said.


It added that feedback on Garden Fresh received from its channel checks


with distributors, retailers and other parties was “overwhelmingly negative”


and that the company’s beverage production facilities were “essentially idle”.


The report also said Sino Grandness has never generated free cash �ow.


Despite cumulative net pro�ts of RMB1.1 billion from 2006 to 2013, total free


cash �ow during those years was negative, at RMB463 million, it pointed out.


This, it claimed, was why the company has been placing out shares or selling


convertible bonds every year since its 2009 listing.


“Given the upcoming bond maturities and capital expenditure requirements,


we believe the stock is e�ectively worthless,” the report said, adding that Sino


Grandness is worth no more than RMB800 million to RMB900 million, or


three to six Singapore cents a share, if there were no additional fundraising


activity.


If Sino Grandness does not list its Garden Fresh subsidiary in the foreseeable


future, it could face up to RMB723 million worth of redemption payments for


its convertible bonds, it noted. “We believe that the required equity issuance

is so massive relative to the true equity value of the company that the current


shares are practically worthless.”


Responding to the allegations, Sino Grandness said in an Oct 23 statement


that the points raised were “baseless and unsubstantiated” and that the


company was in a sound �nancial position and had complied with all


statutory and listing requirements.


Its �nancial statements are subject to annual audits by Foo Kon Tan Grant


Thornton LLP and that the independent auditor's reports have consistently


been “without quali�cations whatsoever”, said the company, which will


announce its 3Q2014 results by Nov 14.


Sino Grandness is the second S-chip in recent times to be attacked by short


sellers. China Minzhong Food had more than half of its market value wiped


out within hours in August last year, after California-based Glaucus Research


issued a report alleging the company had misled investors about sales. That


episode followed an attack on Olam International’s �nancial health and


business model in November 2012 by Muddy Waters.
