Lihua International: We Think Undisclosed Related Party Transactions
Occurred
Aug. 4, 2011 9:16 AM ET36 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


As reports alleging wrongdoing at U.S.-listed Chinese companies become more
commonplace, it's easy to gloss over some of the potentially egregious violations of
fiduciary duty that a number of these companies are committing.


On Monday, Absaroka Capital released a report discussing concerns on Lihua
International (NASDAQ:LIWA), a producer of copper products that went public via a SPAC
in 2008. A key finding of the report was evidence that the company's COO, who is the wife
of the CEO, owns a privately-owned copper scrap products company at the same address
as Lihua, yet the company has never disclosed this ownership to public investors.


Related Party Transactions in the Chinese RTO Sector


This sector has been plagued by numerous instances of undisclosed related party
transactions. For example, in 2009, Yuhe International (OTCPK:YUII) saw its auditor
Grant Thornton resign due to "certain related party loans between the Company and
Shandong Yuhe Food Group Co., Ltd." (see here). Similar to LIWA, Shandong Yuhe Food
was a related party controlled by the company's management that operated a similar
business to the publicly traded entity. A year later, Geoinvesting LLC revealed that YUII
had completed a sham acquisition to justify a capital raise from U.S. investors. The stock
dropped 70% and was halted and de-listed. The related party red flag was the canary in
the coal mine. In the case of Gulf Resources (NASDAQ:GURE), there is substantial
evidence that the company's top customer is similarly owned by its chairman.


Related party transactions can allow companies to inflate sales or depress costs and
therefore show higher margins and revenue / profit in their financial statements. They can
further be used to transfer funds out of the publicly-owned business to insiders who own
the related party.


Lihua and Danyang Huaying Materials Recycling Co., Ltd.


In its report, Absaroka revealed that Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd., a copper
scrap supply company that is registered at the same address as LIWA, is owned by
LIWA's COO, Wang Yaying. Ms. Wang is also the wife of Lihua Chairman Zhu Jianhua.
SAIC filings show that Ms. Wang and her sister own 90% of Huaying and that Huaying

https://seekingalpha.com/article/284541-lihua-international-we-think-undisclosed-related-party-transactions-occurred 2/13


generated $43.2m in revenue in 2009 while having $14.4m in assets. Management
admitted on the 8/03 conference call that Huaying is owned and controlled by
management, and that Huaying has its registered address at the same location as LIWA.


The question remains on whether LIWA conducted any transactions with Huaying
subsequent to LIWA going public. No such transactions, nor the existence of Huaying and
its ownership by management, have ever been disclosed in SEC filings. Based on
evidence from its investigators, Absaroka concluded that Huaying currently sells copper to
LIWA and includes LIWA as one of its customers. Outside of Absaroka's conclusions,
there exists additional indications that Lihua has had a relationship with Huaying
subsequent to going public in 2008.


First, the company's CFO stated on the August 3rd conference call that LIWA and
Huaying had an agreement in place determining the price at which LIWA would purchase
scrap copper from Huaying.


Below is an excerpt from the call (emphasis added):


Global Hunter Analyst: I have a number of questions about your relationship with
Huaying Resource Recycling, so please bear with me for a few minutes. Have you
ever disclosed any information about Huaying publicly in the past to either the SEC
or your investors?


Lihua CFO: Dmitri, yes we did. Back in the year 2008, Lihua did the PIPE
transaction with Vision Capital and CMHJ, who still are one of our large
stockholders. We did disclose Huaying to them, and the purpose why we set up this
company. So Vision Capital's lawyers did a full due diligence on Huaying and set up
an agreement with Huaying and Lihua. In the agreement, it states that they,
Huaying, can sell only scrap copper to Lihua and we can only buy at 10 RMB
per ton as the offering cost. So and that's a part of the agreement for the PIPE
transaction back in the year 2008…


It strikes us as counterintuitive that LIWA would enter into an agreement with Huaying
such that Huaying would sell scrap copper to LIWA at a specified price, if LIWA was never
to transact with Huaying subsequent to going public. The presence of the agreement
would indicate that LIWA and Huaying have a copper supply relationship. We remind
investors that Huaying generated $43.2m in revenue in 2009, according to SAIC filings,
and had an operational business.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/284541-lihua-international-we-think-undisclosed-related-party-transactions-occurred 3/13


The agreement discussed above also indicates that Huaying does indeed have operations
in Danyang, where LIWA is located, contrary to the CFO's claims that the company
operates out of Guangdong, as per below:


Global Hunter Analyst: Okay, that's great, now can you tell us in more detail what
business Huaying [is] engaged in and where its operations located?


Lihua CFO: I don't know about Huaying because we never used that company. So
it's Ms. Wang's sister [who is] operating that company. So basically what I've heard
is this company has an operating outfit in Guangdong doing like scrap trading, its
like a trading company. And they don't have any operations in Danyang.


We question whether LIWA's CFO's statement is accurate. Absaroka's report indicates
that its investigators concluded that Huaying operates out of Danyang. The name
"Danyang" in the company's title indicates that Huaying operates out of Danyang. Its
registered address indicates that the business operates out of Danyang. Its filing of SAIC
documents in Danyang indicates that the company operates out of Danyang. And the
2008 agreement struck with LIWA to sell scrap metal to LIWA for a specified price also
implies that Huaying is based out of Danyang, given that LIWA would be far less likely to
be purchasing scrap from Guangdong (Guangdong and Danyang are 1,500km apart from
each other).


Second, it's difficult to believe that a copper scrap recycling business with the same
registered address as Lihua's copper manufacturing subsidiaries and owned by Lihua's
COO is generating no sales to Lihua, and has generated no sales to Lihua since the
company went public in 2008. To review, Danyang Huaying's business scope is
specifically the recycling of scrap copper and other metals. Click here for SAIC business
registration details retrieved for Danyang Huaying, and a description of its business scope
is pasted below (click to enlarge image):


The translation reads:


General Business Scope: recycled illuminated coiled metal, recycled scrap
electrolytic copper, copper, recycled scrap nonferrous metal and sales, act as
principal and agent for importing and exporting merchandise and technology
products (except for the import and export of businesses, merchandise and
technology products prohibited by government)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/284541-lihua-international-we-think-undisclosed-related-party-transactions-occurred 4/13


Given that Danyang Huaying is a scrap copper recycler, and scrap copper recyclers
typically sell their products to downstream copper manufacturers, it's difficult to believe
that LIWA does not conduct any business transactions with Huaying.


So What if Related Party Transactions Did Occur?


Based on Absaroka's conclusions in its report and on our indications discussed above,
there is evidence that transactions between Huaying and LIWA may have likely occurred.


The independent party that would know would be Crowe Horwath.


If LIWA has been conducting related party transactions with Huaying, Crowe Horwath
would likely have invoices and purchase orders between LIWA and Huaying in their audit
work papers. We presume that Crowe Horwath has seen a copy of Absaroka's report, or
will see it shortly.


If related party transactions have occurred between LIWA and Huaying, this would be a
clear violation of SEC regulations, which require companies to disclose related party
transactions. In this instance, we would expect Crowe Horwath to resign. After all, Crowe
Horwath is a top-20 globally ranked auditor. The firm has a reputation to uphold to a far
greater degree than many of the no-name auditors currently auditing U.S.-listed Chinese
RTOs. And the rash of recent auditor resignations have indicated that auditors with
reputations to uphold are beginning to conduct deeper audits on their Chinese RTO clients
exhibiting red flags.


If Crowe Horwath resigns, we expect a similar fate for LIWA as we've seen for other U.S.-
listed Chinese companies that have seen auditor resignations, such as
OTCQB:OTC:CHBT, OTCPK:OTCPK:CCME, OTC:OTC:RINO, etc. The stock would likely
be halted and de-listed.


Our educated guess is that related party transactions between LIWA and Huaying have in
fact occurred during LIWA's tenure as a public company, that Crowe Horwath has
evidence for this in their audit work papers, and that Crowe Horwarth will resign when it
reviews its work papers. To no one's surprise, we're short the stock.

This is AWESOME. Thank you for solidifying my belief that you are terrified of the upcoming Q for GURE. This hit
piece speaks volumes about just how desperate you are to cover. Here's a question for you Sahm...why isn't the SEC
investigating/pursuing with your "evidence" in hand? You're a short seller, you're desperate and out of luck. 2 hit
pieces in as many weeks. Try to enjoy your plunge.

Folks, you need to try and think outside the box. Most people look at investing in China from the U.S. perspective,
what you need for investing in China is from the China perspective. I suggest to the readers read a book titled Chin
Mega Trends by Nesibit. With the writiers like above you will not be making much money on your investments, I have
over 20 stocks in China and love the short sellers, because I make even more. Remember China has 2 very big
things that the U.S does not. 1. Money, 2. The Political will to do the right thing. Another words they do things
differntly. Good luck if you go down the road of these writers.

In the case of GURE we have proven clearly that you're only purpose of writing articles in SA is to deceive, lie and
steal. 
You have completely neglected to contact the Weifang Salt Bureau and the Shouguang Bromine Industry Association
to inquire for their data and statistics.

Look bud, this is well-researched, but at the end of the day, neither you nor Absaroka produced any claims
that stuck. In fact, both LIWA's responses and JLA's forensic report have systematically rendered all these
claims as insubstantial. Besides that, the CFO of LIWA has even admitted that prior to 2008, they were
planning on doing business with Danyang, but due to the change of Chinese tax law, it made no financial
difference. So unless you can produce the purchase orders LIWA made to Danyang prior to going public,
you're just shooting bullets in the air, my friend. From the CFO:


"Danyang Huaying was a VAT tax exempt entity and up until 2008 Lihua would have been able to derive tax
benefits from purchasing scrap copper from a VAT tax exempt entity. However since the beginning of 2009,
Chinese tax law changed and resource recycling entities were no longer VAT-tax exempt. Accordingly, Lihua
would not have received any tax benefits had it purchased scrap copper from Danyang Huaying, nor did it
purchase any scrap copper from Danyang Huaying."

I hope liwa will file a lawsuit against those entities that are praying on their stocks. I think that Absaroka Capital and
this article clearly indication the level of cooperation between them. I am assuming that this two companies are
worked together to bring liwa down.


If liwa files a lawsuit they will not have to go far to find connections between hedge funds and Absaroka Capital.


Shorts are borrowing at 80%, so they are already loosing money. After following liwa short positions for few month
you can see that they cover around 400,000 shares and pushed the stock to $2 dollars and change last month, and
then shorted again.


In order for them to make money shorts are working together to kill the stock. It is shouldn't be hard to find them
because they dumped 100k+ stock at last 10 Minutes for days leading to Absaroka Capital report.


After listening to the liwa call I hearing number of investors claiming liwa was not real and wanted to see cash report.


As you can see liwa about cash. I believe that long term investors will not sell their stock and will add to their position.


Shorts will start covering the stock today and tomorrow and Monday. I guess they have 3 million now on hands. We
can see stock to be pushed to at least $9-$10 dollar range before the earning.

Liwa stock price $7


Cash per share $3


2011 EPS ~$2 
2012 EPS $3


We know the cash is there, which means the business is real. 
For a company growing 50% year, doesn't it deserve a forward p/e greater than 2? Ex-cash forward p/e is 1.


I should add that the cash is in RMB, which has appreciated from 6.8 last year to 6.45 now.


This math doesn't add up. Knowing that the cash has been verified, this stock is going to rip and the shorts know it.


That's why the shares available to short have increased substantially and the indicative rate to short has decreased
from 35 to 17 percent.


This is going to be interesting....

positions lately have all done pretty well and thus at GURE's valuation, I love the stock here. They're wayyyy past

Someone should tell Absaroka that, they seem to think that they're a "low quality auditor".


If you're going to team up for a short attack, you should probably get your stories straight.


Oh yeah, and you should probably not do it against a stock whose cash balances were just confirmed through an
independent forensic accounting review. How can a company that is supposedly a fraud and/or siphoning off money
have $91m in the bank?

The author has misquoted Lihua's CFO. He did not say that Huaying must sell to LIWA at 10RMB per pound. He said
that Huaying must not add more than 10RMB per pound when selling to LIWA. In other words, the mark-up is fixed,
not the price. Please listen to that section of the call transcript (which is still online), and you will immediately hear
your error.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Apologies if we're wrong, I listened to that quote and it's difficult to make out exactly what he
said. Regardless, the point we're making is that there was an agreement put together governing purchasing
terms between LIWA and Huaying, which is evidence that they likely conducted transactions subsequent to
the company going public.

hickhoppa
Kerrisdale in the above article says:


" In the agreement, it states that they, Huaying, can sell only scrap copper to Lihua and we can only buy at 10
RMB per ton as the offering cost. "


So the agreement states a related company will sell LIWA a whole ton of copper for a fraction of the price of
just one pound ? Somebody's playing fast and loose with the facts and it appears it's Kerrisdale.

This entire article is pure speculation. Also, aren't you relying on third party reports for your arguments? Why are you
allowed to rely on third party reports from a party less reliable than an auditor/CPA firm, but we are all supposed to
believe that these auditors/CPAs are not reliable?


The CPA exam is a highly regulated exam that less than 50% of candidates pass. CPA's are also held to stringent
ethical standards. As soon as you have a CPA signing his name to your research or your reports, let me know and
maybe I'll consider their validity.

I believe you understand that you have brought the stock down by 35% in just few weeks for no reason. The company
is one of the few that is doing something right. There is a lot of fraud in china stocks and I believe that short sellers
who find and show proof to us are doing good job. As investors I would rather know sooner then later if I am investing
if bad company. Right now it appears that you understand that the company has nothing wrong with it.


As a profession you should give LIWA a credit it deserves and issue a public apologies to the company and investors
who are loosing millions of dollars for no reason.

It comes down to one thing, do you believe what the Company said.


Although Absaroka is correct in its contention that DanyangHuaying Resource Recycling Company
("DanyangHuaying") is a related party established in 2008 by Ms. Wang Yaying, Lihua's COO, Ms. Wang Junying, her
sister, and Mr. Zhu Junying, an unrelated third party, Lihua has never purchased scrap copper or any other raw
materials from this company. DanyangHuaying was a VAT-tax exempt entity until a change in Chinese tax policy in
early 2009. Lihua would have been able to derive tax benefits by purchasing raw materials from a resource recycling
company, but as a result of the change in tax policy, which eliminated DanyangHuaying's VAT-tax exemption prior to
the launch of Lihua's scrap copper recycling operations, the Company never conducted any business with
DanyangHuaying.


On another note, one can deduct a large portion of the revenues, and still find value in this company. One would have
to believe the whole operations is fraudulent, which one appears to be saying. Run the calculations with a 10RMB
markup and run it through the calculations with the conclusion that the cost was hidden.


I will agree with the author, reading through these boards is sort of a waste.

You are mistaken about your information on ONP! You should retract the hit piece and issue an apology in a separate
article.

GURE earnings tomorrow morning and then investors will start coming back into the stock. Nice call on your short, but
I'd be nervous after tomorrow.

Too funny, investors flocking back into GURE after earnings tomorrow?


You apparently seen the MACRO events unfolding. Down 6% today, overnight HK is down 7%. Premarket on
the US shows another bloodbath looms with futures down a whopping 2.5% again(which is what they were
before the selloff btw).


All stock all sectors are going to tumble tomorrow as well. Perhaps not as much as today but it will be a red
day across the board. And that's on the legit stocks with no questions surrounding them, the ones with
questions surrounding them almost always get hit twice as hard.


Think before you speak.

Forget Sarah and look at the market and the economy. See if you can do anything about the problems facing
the USA. Help Obama.

Is everyone missing the gross contradiction made by the CFO?


Did he not say this?


Global Hunter Analyst: Okay, that’s great, now can you tell us in more detail what business Huaying [is] engaged in
and where its operations located?


Lihua CFO: I don’t know about Huaying because we never used that company....


But in another statement, he stated that LIWA disclosed the relationship to Vision and other PIPE investors in 2008,
and made an agreement to set pricing on any purchase agreement to Huaying. How would he know this fact, but then
he doesn't know much about this Company, regardless of whether they used the Company or not.


Also, does anyone actually know how little of a margin 10rmb/MT is???? You get better margins on a MT of noodles,
and in some cases on 1 bowl of noodles if its organic ;) ...nobody would ever sign such an agreement or ASK for such
an agreement because it is outlandlsh at best.
