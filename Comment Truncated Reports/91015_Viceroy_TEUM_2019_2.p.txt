Pareteum  -  Executive overview  
Blocking Viceroy Research and shareholders on twitter wil l not make your problems go away.    


June 27, 2019 – This report unveils troubling data Viceroy Research has encountered while conducting 


background checks on Pareteum’s management team. 


"David Hess and David John join Pareteum as we are rocketing towards our growth goals as a global 


technology” company…Hiring talent to expand our North America presence and connect into Latin 


America is the obvious step in acquiring new customers and new revenue that will ensure we exceed our 


targets"  


– Hal Turner, CEO1 


David John, Vice-President Pareteum, was hired by Hal Turner with apparent pride in October 2018, and cited 


as Managing Director, CALA for Pareteum Corp.

Viceroy have double checked multiple sources to confirm David John’s full name is, in fact, David John Fondots.

There appears to be a very good reason why Mr Fondots has omitted his last name 


from his public-facing corporate profile 


Fraud & Embezzlement 


On June 7, 2019, David Fondots was arrested and charged with wire fraud relating to an embezzlement scheme 


by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), where attorneys for the Lelling’s Securities & Fraud Unit are 


prosecuting3. The charge relates to one of Mr. Fondots’ previous ventures, Mach Music. As though the day 


couldn’t get worse for Pareteum following the release of Aurelius Value’s detailed report on the same morning.

It seems, following this discovery, that Pareteum (and, in fairness, its stakeholders) conduct no background 


checks into its clients or its management candidates.  Viceroy believe David John Fondots’ name change is a 


deliberate attempt to distance himself from charges and former criminal conduct. David John Fondots took 


down any reference to his full name, including his own website:

Pandering Obscenity Involving a Minor 


David J Fondots is further identifiable through a Mugshot from Cleveland, Ohio, where Mr Fondots was arrested 


on charges of Pandering Obscenities involving a minor.

We find it hard to believe that Pareteum are unaware of this information.

We don’t really have a problem with this – ignorance is bliss. On the other hand, we have been informed, and 


since verified, that Pareteum has been blocking retail shareholders who have demanded information from the 


company.  


We will continue to report on Pareteum as new information becomes available.
