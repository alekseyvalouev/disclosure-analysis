Confession Time: Miller Reveals The Truth

Summary


Miller looks overvalued, since the company just released new figures indicating that
its $5 stock is probably worth less than 10% of that price.


Forget about Miller's plan to somehow transform itself into a Master Limited
Partnership, too. The firm bears no resemblance to a normal MLP at all.


The SEC has asked Miller for all sorts of documentation to support the numbers in
its financial statements.


Miller didn't really get rid of its tarnished CEO and longtime chairman of the board.
The company just assigned them cushier titles and kept them on its payroll.


Don't trust the analysts who follow Miller, either. Even after repeatedly slashing their
estimates for the company, those cheerleaders sound just as bullish as ever.


Miller Energy Resources (NYSE: MILL) better watch its mouth. Earlier this week, the
energy firm accidentally told the truth.


Believe it or not, Miller practically admitted that it's overvalued by releasing figures that
basically indicate that its $5 stock should actually fetch less than 10% of that generous
price.


Just wait until the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finds out about this news.
After fielding questions from the SEC about the reported value of its assets, Miller might
as well go ahead assume that regulators will probably notice some new disclosures that
make the $230 million company - strapped for cash, with less than $4 million in the bank -
look virtually worthless right now.


Don't take our word for that conclusion. Feel free to double-check our math. We relied on
a simple formula - using numbers provided by Miller itself - to determine that the company
is likely worth no more than 45 cents a share.


Here. We can walk you through the arithmetic to save a little time, if you like.

When Miller issued its latest press release (cluttering it mostly with a bunch of hype that
we'll scrutinize in more detail later), the company announced plans to boost its reserves by
purchasing similar assets at prices well below the value assigned to the reserves that it
already owns. Specifically, Miller said that it expects to buy "substantially all the Alaskan
operating assets" of a neighboring firm with proven reserves totaling 1.9 million barrels of
oil equivalent (MBOE) for somewhere between $40 million and $50 million. So let's
assume that its actual offer falls in the middle of that range, with Miller paying the
equivalent of $23.68 per MBOE for those neighboring assets, and then value the
company's existing reserves at that very same level.


We figure that oil is oil, especially when it's located in the same region, after all.


Since Miller estimated its proven reserves at 11.7 MBOE in its most recent financial
statements, multiply that figure by $23.68 to arrive at a preliminary valuation of $277
million for the company. Don't get too excited by that figure, though. You still need to
subtract Miller's hefty $314 million debt load from that total and - with the results actually
landing in negative territory - you will obviously want to add the company's meager $3.7
million in cash and (far more helpfully) its $53.6 million in tax credits to that balance if you
want to prevent the firm from looking entirely worthless.


Go ahead. Check out the number on your calculator screen. If you plugged in the correct
figures, you probably feel rather startled by what you see.


Based upon the low price that Miller intends to pay for some additional reserves in Alaska,
the company should be worth just $20 million right now. When you divide that total by the
number of shares that Miller currently has outstanding (46.35 million), you should arrive at
a stock price for the company that - as we tried to warn you earlier - falls just below 45
cents a share.


We're almost tempted to stop right there and assume that (with the help of Miller itself) we
have already made our point about the true value of this cash-strapped company. Now
that we've investigated the rest of the news that Miller packed into its recent press release,
however, we can't bring ourselves to let the company off the hook so easily. After
scrutinizing companies like Miller for years -- and finding all sorts of warning signs that hint
at looming disasters that too often materialize -- we know how to recognize a bunch of
pointless (and potentially dangerous) hype as soon as we see it.


Take Miller's notion that it can somehow transform itself into a Master Limited Partnership
(MLP), for example. Talk about a ridiculous idea.

As a oil company that generated a mere $71 million in revenue last year, Miller bears no
resemblance to a normal MLP at all. Once you do a little homework and see just how
much revenue that a typical MLP tends to generate - not to mention the piles of cash that
those multibillion-dollar companies generally clear- we're pretty sure that you will agree
with our conclusion. Miller has tricked the public with an outlandish proposal that seems
like a desperate promotion at worst and a hopeless pipe dream at the absolute best.


Hey, regardless of what our critics might want to believe, we actually tried our hardest to
be fair here. We felt willing to give Miller plenty of credit for one piece of welcome news, in
fact, until the firm immediately proceeded to blow its chances.


Right after Miller announced that it had finally decided to replace its namesake and his
son-in-law as its longtime chairman and its CEO, respectively, the company revealed that
it had actually held onto both of those controversial leaders and simply rewarded them
with cushier positions instead. By hiring the first as a consultant/advisor and appointing
the second as the actual executive chairman of its board, Miller basically just assigned
those tarnished insiders different titles and kept them on an expensive payroll that - given
its bleeding operations and its meager $3.7 million cash balance right now -- the company
must know that it cannot reasonably afford.


Miller didn't stop there, however. The company actually found a way to make matters even
worse by showering an incoming board member with a generous pile of stock options
before that newly appointed director even tries to prove that he's any better than those
blasted for their lousy oversight.


So forgive us if we refuse to believe that Miller has really changed its ways. Three years
after the company originally caught our attention - prompting us to write a damaging report
that rapidly cut its stock price in half - Miller continues to provide us with plenty of reasons
to keep on doubting its word.


We don't think that Miller ever learned its lesson after that devastating crash, since the
company seems to keep on looking for new ways to spin the ugly truth. If you happened to
catch the year-end conference call that Miller hosted a few months ago, you should know
exactly what we mean.


Miller loudly celebrated a boost to its proven reserves and then casually admitted that its
engineers had just issued a new report that actually slashed the estimated value of those
underlying assets. We're not talking about a modest adjustment here, either. Despite the
