We take pride in our track record of identifying threats and business model risks that other
investors may be missing. A handful of stocks that we have analyzed on Seeking Alpha
have experienced significant declines (PCBC down 82%, HUSA down 36%, and JTX
down 70%). We have chosen our profiles carefully, focusing on companies that are
severely mispriced and possess risks that have gone unnoticed. We believe we have
identified another stock that is not what it seems.


City Holding Company (NASDAQ: CHCO) of West Virginia is a bank that is perhaps the
most egregious perpetrator of a nasty trick being played on US retail depositors. We do
not believe it is an exaggeration to describe CHCO as a glorified payday lender operating
under the umbrella of a bank charter. We believe the stock will face significant earnings
and multiple compression, and believe current investors face greater than 40% downside
from current levels. It is our hope that by highlighting our concerns, other investors can
make better informed decisions as it relates to an investment or short position in CHCO. 


Overdraft Background 
Bank overdraft and insufficient fund fees (which we will refer to as “overdraft”) penalize
customers for taking a greater amount of money out of their account than their account
balance. It is not uncommon for a single overdraft to have annual percentage rates [APR]
that exceeds 1,500%. Unsavory overdraft practices are currently in the cross hairs of
regulators and politicians. We expect a new Federal Reserve rule that becomes effective
in July to be the first step in reducing and eliminating these fees. Overdraft is practically a
100% margin revenue item for banks, and the banks that earn a disproportionate amount
of income from these fees are going to face significant headwinds.


It is our opinion that allowing customers to overdraft their account until their next paycheck
is deposited, and then charging them a very steep fee for this privilege, is no different than
controversial payday loans. While payday lenders have long been attacked for their APRs,
banks typically charge dramatically higher interest rates than payday lenders. Payday
lenders typically charge 300-350% APRs for a relatively high-risk loan. A bank that
charges a $32 fee to a customer that overdrafts his account by $100 for one week earns a
1664% APR for a very low-risk loan. If the $100 in overdraft was generated by more than
one transaction, the fees and implied interest rate multiply.

The policies of most banks are even more insidious than what we just described. Many
banks have set up their software so that if multiple checks, debit card, or ATM transactions
occur in a single day, the transactions are processed in the order of the highest dollar
amount to the lowest. Management teams have argued that they process the largest
transactions first because they assume these are the most important transactions for their
customers. This argument is completely specious because banks are not actually denying
any transactions. They are clearing all of the transactions so that they can charge multiple
overdraft fees to a single customer on a single day. The fact is that the order in which most
banks process transactions is in place for one purpose… to maximize fees charged to
their customers. 


City Holding Company (CHCO)
To determine which banks are most reliant on these fees, and who is the most aggressive
with overdraft, we screened deposit fees as a percentage of revenues and deposit fees as
a percentage of non-CD deposits (transaction accounts). Most banks do not disclose
specific overdraft fees, but it is reasonable to assume that in the era of “free checking,” the
majority of deposit fees represent overdraft charges.  
CHCO not only tops the lists of overdraft fee generators, but does so by a wide margin. By
our estimate, City Holdings generates 60% to 70% of earnings from overdraft (see table 2
below). Shockingly, CHCO is currently generating a 6% yield on its retail deposits and a
4% yield on its transaction accounts (see table below). Said another way, CHCO is
currently generating a higher yield on their deposits (a liability!) than their assets. We
researched 140 banks and discovered that the service fee to average transaction account
balance was less than 1%. We found two other banks that generated roughly 3% of fees,
while no other bank was over 2%. CHCO was a startling outlier and appears much more
reliant on deposit fees than any other bank in the country.

Given the huge amount of fees relative to other banks, we can only assume that CHCO is
using the most aggressive and potentially deceptive tactics in the industry to promote
overdraft. Our industry research suggests such unsavory practices could include: high per
incidence fees, an unlimited number of fees per day or month, ordering of transactions
from highest to lowest, and overstating account balances due to bounce or overdraft
“protection.” CHCO’s depositor base also plays a significant factor (a point that seems to
be front and center with new regulations). Banks located in lower income geographies
typically have a higher than average proportion of low balance checking accounts that
have a much higher propensity to overdraft.  


In the Crosshairs of Regulators and Legislatures
So why will these abuses change? First, starting on July 1,2010, a new Federal Reserve
regulation (known as Reg E) goes into effect that significantly alters overdraft fees. The
new rules require customers to positively opt-in to an overdraft program in order for banks
to charge them fees. We believe banks will have little success convincing the right
customers to opt-in. The type of bank customer that regularly racks up multiple overdraft
and insufficient funds fees is not the type of customer that religiously opens and balances
their bank statement. The prospect of these customers proactively reading and signing a
piece of paper “opting-in” before dutifully mailing the signed form back to the bank so that
they can continue to charge the high fees is very low.


The new Fed rules are likely to have a material effect on this high margin revenue item,
but we believe the new rules are just the tip of the iceberg. The sweeping financial
regulatory reform currently being debated in Congress could be signed into law within the
next month. Following the creation of a consumer finance protection agency [CFPA], we
believe the curbs in overdraft will become even more severe. Overdraft and order
checking is the type of behavior that the CFPA will likely target. Regulators and legislators
have aggressively targeted payday loans, and we believe overdraft fees are significantly
more usurious. While overdraft could be banned entirely, at the very least we believe
restrictions on the number of charges a customer can incur, a cap in per incident charges,
and a change in transaction process ordering policies are very likely. It is hard to imagine
this area of future policy receiving much opposition.

Some banks are proactively changing their overdraft policies. In March 2010, Bank of
America (NYSE:BAC) announced it was eliminating overdraft fees. On a conference call in
mid April, Bank of America implied that changes in their overdraft policy and Reg E will
cost the bank $3 billion in fees annually. JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) has also adjusted their
overdraft policies and expects to lose $500 million “after-tax” in fees. While these lost
revenue sums are massive, they do not represent material sums for each bank’s overall
income statement. The same cannot be said for CHCO. 


Impact on CHCO 
We believe CHCO’s overvalued stock could unravel for two reasons. These two risks,
lower earnings [E] and multiple contraction (P/E), could occur in tandem, which would lead
to a much lower “P”. First, we see significant earnings risk that investors have ignored, so
far. Analysts and investors appear to be assuming that future monthly maintenance fees
will offset the gaping hole that would be created from the reduced overdraft fees. We
believe this will be very difficult for CHCO to implement because overdraft fees are
primarily generated by a very small percentage of depositors (14% according the FED).
Complicating any plans for deposit fees is the fact that CHCO operates in a very
competitive environment for deposits. In West Virginia, BB&T (NYSE:BBT) has the highest
deposit share, while CHCO is a distant fifth. Competing banks, including JP Morgan and
BB&T, would aggressively market to CHCO’s disgruntled customers should they start
charging their “good” depositors to try and offset the loss of revenue from serial
overdrafters. If we are correct and new regulations change the rules on overdraft, the hit to
CHCO’s earnings could be dramatic.
Under the draconian scenario, we assume that overdraft is banned and CHCO’s earnings
from overdraft fall to zero. Under this scenario, CHCO’s earnings power falls below $1.00
per share, a level that may only support an $11 to $13 stock price. In the second scenario,
we assume CHCO is able to generate service fee revenues of 1% of transaction accounts.
This level is inline with the average bank today (although regulations should pressure this
level going forward) and assumes maintenance fees without deposit share loss (so a
conservative estimate). Under this scenario, earnings would have been 40% to 85% lower
the past three years (see Table 2). On a go forward basis, earnings power at the bank falls
below $1.50 per share.
Surprisingly, current analyst estimates expect earnings to accelerate in the second half of
2010 and continue higher in 2011. While deposit fees are not the only component of
earnings, they are certainly one of the most important drivers for CHCO. With upcoming

The second driver for the lower stock price will be multiple contraction. As investors begin
to understand the risk to CHCO’s primary income driver, the multiple on these
destabilizing earnings stream will also contract. CHCO trades at 200% of its tangible book
value of $16.11, which is one of the highest multiples of all US banks. A better comp group
for CHCO’s multiple would be the payday lenders, given their similarities. There is a
reason that payday lenders trade at 4-5x earnings. While payday is a highly profitable
