I. OVERVIEW OF OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
• Summary. MBIA is an insurer whose primary business is to provide guarantees on
financial obligations in exchange for upfront or installment premiums. Management
describes the company as a “long-term buyer and holder of risk,” which underwrites to a
“no-loss” standard. MBIA operates its insurance business through its AAA rated
insurance subsidiary, MBIA Insurance Corp. The insurance company’s AAA rating is
critical to the success of the entire enterprise.


Were the insurance company downgraded by even one notch (from AAA to
AA+), even the company acknowledges its business could be materially impaired.
In light of MBIA’s enormous leverage, the company’s credit quality,
underwriting, transparency, accounting, and track record must be beyond
reproach. In addition, and as importantly, the company must have minimal
liquidity risk. Based on our research, we conclude that MBIA fails to meet these
standards.
It appears to us that an actual or perceived downgrade of MBIA would have fairly
draconian consequences to the company and create substantial drains on the
company’s liquidity. The self-reinforcing and circular nature of the company’s
exposures make it a poor candidate for a AAA rating.
• High Leverage. Compared with other AAA rated companies, MBIA is unusual
for its high degree of leverage. At September 30, 2002, MBIA’s $5.5 billion of
shareholders’ equity supported $764 billion of outstanding guarantee liabilities
(net par and interest), a ratio of liabilities to equity of 139 to 1. Even when
compared with the company’s $483 billion of net par insured, MBIA is leveraged
nearly 88 to 1. MBIA has been able to achieve a AAA rating despite its enormous
leverage because of the perceived high quality of its guarantee portfolio, its long
track record of minimal reported losses, its modest on-balance sheet leverage, and
the fact that the rating agencies believe that MBIA is not exposed to accelerating
guarantees and has no short-term debt.
• MBIA’s AAA Rating Can Withstand Only $900 million to $1.7 billion of
Losses. According to MBIA’s CFO, the company would be at risk of a
downgrade in the event it were to incur losses of $900 million to $1.7 billion, a
mere 20 to 35 basis points loss on its $483 billion net par guarantee portfolio.
• Municipal Finance Versus Structured Finance. In MBIA’s traditional
business of guaranteeing municipal debt, the company had an informational
advantage compared to Wall Street that enabled it to profit from the sale of
insurance to municipalities which could not easily access capital without its
guarantee. MBIA’s recent growth has been driven by the corporate and structured
finance markets in which there are alternatives to financial guarantees. We do not
believe that MBIA has a competitive advantage in these markets.


• Reserving. MBIA’s reserves are consistent with its perceived high quality guarantee
portfolio, i.e., its reserves are extraordinarily low compared to those of other financial
institutions. Excluding reserves for known losses, the company has approximately 4 basis
points of reserves against potential losses in its guarantee portfolio.
• Transparency. MBIA prides itself on the quality and transparency of its public
disclosure. This high degree of transparency is critical for rating agencies, regulators, and
shareholders because of the company’s high leverage and low reserves.
• Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). MBIA has approximately $8.6 billion of assets and
liabilities in five off-balance sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), supported by a total
of $125,000 (one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars) of third-party equity. These
SPVs were disclosed for the first time in MBIA’s 2001 Annual Report, although they
have been part of MBIA since early 1998. While the company states that all SPV assets
at the time of purchase were investment grade, MBIA itself may determine whether an
asset qualifies as investment grade. In addition, there is apparently no requirement that
the ratings of assets in the SPV be updated. MBIA claims that it cannot reveal the
contents of the SPVs because of confidentiality agreements it has signed.
• We Reveal $4 Billion of the SPVs Assets. In this report, we provide information on all
of the assets that we have been able to identify in the SPVs. These identified assets total
more than $4 billion or nearly half of the SPV assets. Many of the SPV assets are
warehouse lines of credit to poorly capitalized and/or financially distressed seller-
servicers of auto loans, defaulted credit card receivables, home equity mortgages, and
healthcare receivables. We believe that if investors were to become aware of the quality
of the assets in the SPVs, they might not be willing to purchase commercial paper or
medium-term notes backed by these assets.
• $3 Billion of the SPV Debt is Commercial Paper. Slightly more than $3 billion of the
$8.6 billion of SPV debt at September 30, 2002 was in the form of commercial paper
(CP). MBIA should, in our view, be considered the de facto issuer of the outstanding
commercial paper because MBIA guarantees the CP and the liquidity facilities that back-
up the CP. The rating agencies, however, do not consider the CP to be debt of MBIA or,
alternatively, are unaware that MBIA, through an SPV, has this short-term debt
outstanding.
• Triple-A One Funding Corp.’s CP Creates Substantial Liquidity Risk for MBIA.
We believe that Triple-A One Funding Corp.’s (one of the SPVs) $3 billion of
commercial paper creates significant liquidity risk for MBIA because, in the event of a
decline in MBIA’s actual or perceived credit rating, these CP buyers may withdraw their
support, requiring the SPV to draw upon its outstanding bank liquidity lines. MBIA
provides no disclosure about this SPV’s
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 2
liquidity facilities; however, CP conduit liquidity facilities typically contain two “outs”
which allow banks not to fund. These outs include bankruptcy of the issuer and/or
insufficient asset values to cover the outstanding commercial paper.
• A Reduction in MBIA’s Rating Will Likely Cause the SPVs’ Assets to Be Less
Than Their Liabilities. Since the assets of MBIA’s SPVs are AAA rated only because
of MBIA’s guarantee, a decline in MBIA’s actual or perceived credit rating may
substantially reduce the value and marketability of the SPV assets. In light of the nominal
equity in this SPV, we believe it is highly probable that the market value of Triple A
One’s assets will not exceed its outstanding commercial paper in the event of an actual or
perceived downgrade of MBIA, increasing the risk of a liquidity facility covenant
violation.
• Accounting Treatment of SPVs. We do not believe that MBIA’s SPVs qualify for off-
balance sheet treatment under current or proposed accounting rules. MBIA’s five off-
balance sheet SPVs, with $8.6 billion of debt guaranteed by MBIA have a total of
$125,000 of third-party equity which equates to 0.0014% of total SPV assets or $14 for
each $1,000,000 of debt, well below the minimum 3% threshold required under GAAP
for non-consolidation of SPVs. We believe MBIA’s SPVs fail the requirements for non-
consolidation for the following reasons: (1) no third party has made a substantive equity
investment; (2) the SPVs are effectively controlled by MBIA; (3) as guarantor of the
SPVs assets and liabilities, MBIA is at risk of loss; and (4) MBIA apparently receives
nearly all of the SPV profits in the form of advisory and administrative fees.
• MBIA Will Likely Be Forced to Consolidate the SPVs at Its Insurance Subsidiary.
We understand that MBIA is now telling investors and analysts that it intends to
consolidate the SPV debt at the holding company, MBIA Inc., rather than at the AAA
insurance subsidiary, MBIA Insurance Corp., which is the guarantor of the SPV
obligations. We believe MBIA will have substantial difficulty consolidating the SPVs at
the holding company under the newly proposed SPV consolidation rules because the
rules require the SPVs to be consolidated with their “primary beneficiary” if the SPVs do
not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved.
• MBIA Says That Rating Agencies Will Ignore the SPVs If Consolidated. MBIA
explains that the rating agencies have indicated that they will ignore the consolidation of
the SPV indebtedness when these entities are brought on balance sheet because the debt
will be offset by an approximately equal amount of AAA rated assets. The SPVs have
99.9996% leverage held against their assets – $8.6 billion of assets supporting $8.6
billion of liabilities. As such, we believe that only if the SPVs’ assets were liquid and
AAA on a stand-alone basis should the rating agencies consider offsetting the impact of
this additional debt on MBIA’s balance sheet in determining the company’s leverage and
rating. In light of the apparently low and deteriorating quality of the assets in the SPVs,
we believe that
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 3
their consolidation will require MBIA to write down these carrying values significantly.
• SPV Assets and Liabilities Have Grown Significantly. Since December 31, 2001, the
SPVs liabilities have increased from $7.8 billion to approximately $8.6 billion at
September 30, 2002. The company is currently on a road show to sell $500 million of
additional debt for Meridian Funding, MBIA’s largest SPV. We find the substantial size
and growth of MBIA’s “black box” SPVs troubling, particularly in light of the
company’s statements about its transparency.
• CDOs and Credit-Default Swaps. CDOs and credit-default swaps (CDS) comprised
13.6% of MBIA’s total par insured at Q3 2002. At August 31, MBIA had gross CDO
exposure of $75.6 billion with net par of $65.9 billion. While the company’s recent CDO
guarantees have focused on AAA tranches, the company’s earlier guarantees include
BBB tranches of CDOs.
• MBIA Has a Multi-Billion Dollar Loss In Its CDO Portfolio According to Dealers.
We asked a number of Wall Street dealers to estimate the mark-to-market values of
MBIA’s CDOs. Based on mid-market prices for the CDO exposures disclosed by MBIA
as of August 31, 2002, we estimate that MBIA has a $5.3 billion to $7.7 billion mark-to-
market loss in its portfolio. We find it surprising that the company’s reports only $35.5
million of unrealized derivative losses at September 30, 2002. The company appears to
be marking its portfolio to its internal models rather than dealer quotes. When we
compare any of these numbers against MBIA’s $5.5 billion of equity capital or against its
$900 million to $1.7 billion cushion against a rating downgrade, one begins to suspect
that the risk of substantial loss and downgrade is much greater than is suggested by its
AAA rating.
• MBIA’s Synthetic CDO Portfolio Exposes the Company to the Risks of Writing
Single-Name Credit Default Swaps. According to dealers, approximately 80% of the
notional amount of synthetic CDOs are represented by the same 200 to 250 credits.
MBIA had $44 billion of synthetic CDOs at August 31, 2002. If the overcollateralization
in these CDOs burns off through a sufficient number of defaults, each subsequent default
will lead to the same loss for each credit as if MBIA had entered into 200 to 250 separate
single-name transactions with $140 to $180 million of exposure to each credit. The
unprecedented level of investment-grade defaults in the last three years substantially
exceeds levels predicted by MBIA’s models when it originally entered into most of these
transactions.
• MBIA Structures Its CDS Transactions to Avoid New York State Insurance
Department Regulations Against Using Insurance Company Capital to Guarantee
Derivatives. MBIA guarantees credit-default swaps indirectly through LaCrosse
Financial Products, LLC, an "orphaned subsidiary" or “SPV transformer,” which enters
into credit-default swaps directly and whose
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 4
obligations are in turn guaranteed by MBIA Insurance Corp. LaCrosse is a minimally
capitalized SPV, the equity of which is owned by a nominee. MBIA Insurance Corp’s
statutory filings with the NY State Insurance Department state that the company “has not
entered into any transactions classified as derivative instruments.” Because LaCrosse
does not have sufficient wherewithal to meet its CDS obligations without full credit
support from MBIA, we believe this structure obscures the company’s true credit
derivative exposure.
• MBIA’s Models Have Failed to Predict the High Level of Credit Defaults. We
believe that the apparent failure of MBIA’s models to predict CDO and CDS defaults is
due to several factors which include: (1) the adverse selection of credits in CDO
transactions, (2) the fact that rating agency data do not include restructuring as a credit
event, (3) inadequate consideration of correlation risk, and (4) problems with modeling
low-probability events.
• MBIA Has Sold Credit Protection On Itself. We have learned that MBIA has sold
default protection on itself through the purchase of credit-linked notes for its insurance
investment portfolio or alternatively through the sale of fully collateralized credit-default
swaps. We believe these transactions are not a good use of MBIA’s insurance capital. By
purchasing MBIA CLNs, the company is leveraging itself up in an undisclosed fashion
while reducing trading spreads of the company’s CDS. Ironically, because MBIA is AAA
rated, the purchase of credit-linked notes improves the portfolio’s average credit rating,
while simultaneously weakening the company’s liquidity to the extent of the new
investment.
• MBIA Has Not Disclosed the Large Number of Restructurings It Has Performed.
MBIA has done approximately 130 to 195 restructurings of transactions over the last 13
years according to the CEO. In its public statements, management often refers to how
much money has been “saved” by its “surveillance” activities, estimated by management
to be $700 million to $1 billion. We believe these savings are more likely to represent
deferred losses. When MBIA restructures a problem deal, it often refinances a near-
defaulting obligation with a larger guaranteed loan. Contrary to other financial
institutions, MBIA provides no disclosure in its public filings as to what percentage or
dollar amount of its guaranteed portfolio has been restructured.
• The Number of MBIA’s Problem Guarantees Is Increasing at a High Rate. The
company does not disclose the dollar amount of its guaranteed assets in default; instead
MBIA periodically discloses only the number of problem issues. The number of problem
issues increased by 92% over the last three years, from 25 to 48 (as of 12/31/01) and has
continued to grow at a 27% annual rate to 54 issues for the six months ended June 30,
2002.
• MBIA Has Changed Its Reserving Methodology Twice Within the Last Three
Years. From its inception until 1999, MBIA had reserved two basis points
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 5
of the par value of its outstanding guarantees for unidentified potential losses in its
portfolio. In 1999, after the bankruptcy of AHERF (Allegheny Health Education and
Research Foundation) and losses of nearly $320 million, MBIA retroactively increased its
reserves from two basis points to four basis points of its guarantee portfolio and made a
one-time addition of $153 million to “bolster reserves.” Beginning in January 2002,
MBIA has again changed its reserving methodology, this time to 12% of earned
premium, which effectively guarantees the company an 88% gross margin on its new
guarantees.
• MBIA Has Substantial Exposure to High Risk Asset Classes. MBIA has substantial
exposure to high risk asset classes which are currently experiencing financial stress
including: healthcare, sub-prime home-equity and manufactured home loans, secured and
unsecured debt of investor-owned utilities, vocational student loans, airline equipment
trust certificates, airport and other travel-based exposures, sub-prime credit cards, and
CDOs.
• Reinsurance. MBIA reinsured $106 billion of its $589 billion of gross par at
September 30, 2002. The credit quality of MBIA’s reinsurers is critical to the company’s
long-term capital requirements. This is due to the fact that the rating agencies “haircut”
reinsurance provided by non-AAA reinsurers. However, 65% of MBIA’s reinsurance
comes from reinsurers whose business is directly correlated with the company’s. MBIA’s
reinsurance program is another form of off-balance sheet leverage that can functionally
accelerate. In the event of a downgrade of a reinsurer, MBIA is considered by the rating
agencies to have received the ceded risks back on its books. In effect, MBIA is
confronted with a capital call when its reinsurers are downgraded. A number of MBIA’s
principal reinsurers have been downgraded recently, and others are at risk of being
downgraded.
• Accounting Issues. In recent years, MBIA has structured a substantial portion of its
guarantee fees as advisory and other fees that the company books immediately as income
at the closing of a transaction. We believe that a combination of accelerated revenue
recognition of guarantee and advisory fees, the company’s immaterial levels of reserves,
and its deferral of a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses cause
MBIA’s GAAP earnings to overstate significantly the company’s true economic
earnings.
• Substantial Growth in Below-Investment-Grade (BIG) Assets. MBIA had $6.8
billion of net par of BIG assets at September 30, 2002 versus $4.8 billion at June 30,
2002. The $2 billion growth represents a 42% increase for the quarter. BIG assets are
now 25% more than MBIA’s total equity of $5.5 billion. The absolute size of these
numbers and their enormous growth in the last quarter should raise red flags for investors
and rating agencies and are inconsistent with a no-loss underwriting strategy.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 6
• Investment Portfolio. While MBIA’s portfolio averages AA, the large amount of
wrapped AAA credits in the portfolio (approximately 50% of the portfolio), about 50% of
which is guaranteed by MBIA itself, serves to artificially boost the portfolio’s stated
credit quality. The large amount of wrapped paper allows MBIA to generate wider
spreads for its AA average-rated portfolio in two ways: first, wrapped AAA paper
generally trades at wider spreads than “natural” AAA credits; and second, the company is
able to add larger amounts of higher yielding A and BBB credits while still maintaining a
AA average. In addition, the investment portfolio’s credit quality will be reduced by the
addition of the SPV assets to MBIA’s balance sheet because of their lower quality and
reduced liquidity.

II. BACKGROUND
MBIA Inc. is a holding company whose primary subsidiary, MBIA Insurance Corp.,
provides guarantees on financial obligations in exchange for upfront or installment
premiums. MBIA and its competitors are often referred to as monoline insurers or,
simply, “monolines.” Management describes the company as a “long-term buyer and
holder of risk” and, in the company’s case, long-term can be as long as 40 years. In our
interview with Mr. Joseph W. “Jay” Brown, the Chairman and CEO, he described the
company as a bank, but one in which the funding is provided by the capital markets
rather than depositors.1
MBIA explains in its Annual Report and other public presentations that it underwrites to
a “no-loss” standard. It must do so because, according to the CFO Neil G. Budnick,


 We cannot charge enough to make up for losses.2


According to Mr. Budnick, MBIA would be at risk of a downgrade in the event it were to
incur losses approximating $900 million to $1.7 billion.3 The rating agencies also state
that if the company’s guarantee portfolio4 is downgraded, MBIA could be downgraded
even if it has not yet experienced large losses.5
MBIA’s insurance company’s AAA rating is critical to the success of the entire
enterprise. Were the insurance company to be downgraded by even one notch (from AAA
to AA+6), even the company acknowledges its business could be materially impaired.7
Monolines are unusual when compared with other AAA rated enterprises for their high
degree of leverage. At September 30, 2002, MBIA’s $5.5 billion of shareholders’ equity
supported $764 billion of outstanding guarantee liabilities (net par and interest), a ratio of
liabilities to equity of 139 to 1. Even when compared with the company’s $483 billion of
net par insured, MBIA is leveraged nearly 88 to 1.

portfolio.

September 11, 2002 Financial Guarantor conference call as transcribed on

6  We use the Standard & Poor’s nomenclature for ratings unless we are referring
specifically to a published Moody’s rating of an issuer.
7  MBIA 2001 10-K: “The Triple-A ratings are important to the operation of the
Company's business and any reduction in these ratings could have a material adverse
effect on MBIA Corp.'s ability to compete and could have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations and financial results of the Company.”
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 8
Monolines have been able to achieve AAA ratings despite their enormous leverage
because of their perceived high quality guarantee portfolios, their long track records of
minimal reported losses, their limited on-balance sheet leverage, and the fact that
monolines do not generally guarantee obligations that accelerate. According to Mr.
Budnick:
We don’t want to have a run on the bank so we pay [our guarantee
obligations] according to the original schedule.8


The purpose of this non-acceleration limitation, which is stated in the governing New
York State Insurance Law, is to protect the monolines from periods in which there are
large numbers of corporate and municipal defaults. Since monolines are only required to
make timely payments of interest and principal, their liquidity requirements are much
more limited than they would be if they had to pay the principal amount of an obligation
upon its default. Making interest payments rather than principal payments obviously
requires much less capital, particularly for obligations that can extend for decades.
In MBIA’s traditional business of guaranteeing municipal debt, the company had an
informational advantage compared to Wall Street that enabled it to profit from the sale of
insurance to municipalities which could not easily access capital without its guarantee.
In contrast, MBIA’s recent growth has been driven by the structured finance markets for
which there are alternatives to monoline guarantees. Issuers can achieve AAA ratings in
structured finance transactions through overcollateralization, subordination, financial
triggers, and other methods. MBIA competes with these alternatives by insuring an
underlying instrument with a rating below AAA for a fee that is less than the capital
markets would charge for the same risk.
We do not believe that MBIA has an informational or other advantage in assessing
structured finance risk versus other informed investors in these markets. These markets
are highly liquid and have high quality information available to all participants. Without
an informational advantage for MBIA and other monoline insurers, we believe there is
likely to be no arbitrage available to generate profits without significant risk. Rather, we
believe, the monoline insurers are assuming risk in return for inadequate compensation.
The financial guarantee business is predominantly a U.S. phenomenon. We believe that
this is largely due to the fact that the underwriting of credit and financial guarantees has
been prohibited by Lloyd’s of London since 1924, following a scandal in which Stanley
Harrison, the underwriter of a five-name syndicate lost a then-substantial sum, £367,787,
by guaranteeing the value of used cars in dealers’ lots. In a recent Lloyd’s review article
the author explained Lloyd’s of London’s concerns about financial guarantee insurance:
8  Speech at the Wall Street Analyst Forum, 45th Institutional Investor Conference, Mr.
Neil Budnick, September 10, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 9


It is more vulnerable to moral hazard. Some forms of financial guarantee
create an asset which can be used to support further transactions. Most are
in some respects a commercial alternative to other financial instruments
which make use of different capital and pricing methods. Buyers can
therefore weigh up insurance against other forms of finance (whereas in
conventional insurance they usually just weigh up insurance against no
insurance) and underwriters may find themselves being bet against by
assureds.
 It is more exposed to correlation. The result of a macro-economic
catastrophe may be that such business – for example a mixed book of
residual value, credit, contract frustration and mortgage indemnity
business in a number of countries – responds adversely and simultaneous
to one crisis. [Emphasis in original.] 9
There is much to be learned from Lloyd’s of London’s early experience in financial
guarantee insurance, for we believe it is applicable to MBIA today.
In this report, we will examine MBIA in great detail. In particular, we will shed light on
the contents of the company’s special purpose vehicles (SPVs), the company’s mark-to-
market losses on collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit derivatives, its
accounting for restructured transactions, the adequacy of its reserves, correlation risk in
the company’s investment portfolio and with its reinsurance providers, and other issues.

III. SUMMARY OF MBIA FACTS
A. Expansion of the Charter
Since its inception in 1974, MBIA, originally Municipal Bond Insurance Association, has
been a municipal bond insurer, insuring general obligation and project-specific financings
for municipalities. The muni guarantee business had minimal losses and was profitable
for many years because municipalities rarely default and almost never repudiate their
debts. Since MBIA’s traditional business required the company to step in only rarely to
pay interest payments, and typically only for brief periods of time, the company’s
business was inherently low risk and had limited liquidity requirements.
According to Mr. Brown, at a board meeting in Bermuda in 1991, the board and
management concluded that it would have to expand the company’s charter – which had
previously restricted MBIA’s business to muni guarantees – in order to meet the
company’s earnings and growth targets in light of increasing competition and the limited
size of the municipal market.10 In 1992, the company diversified its business to begin
guaranteeing other financial obligations.
B. Changing Business Mix of Public Finance Portfolio
MBIA’s public finance guarantee exposure has taken on additional risk as the low-risk
profits of general obligation bonds and bonds backed by other taxpayer-supported
municipal projects have been reduced due to competition. Non-taxpayer supported,
project-based, public finance transactions like hospitals, stadiums, and toll roads suffer
from similar risks to those incurred in private enterprise. Unlike traditional municipal
guarantees that rely on a city’s or state’s taxing authority, tax-exempt project finance
relies solely on a project’s cash flows and its long-term operating performance to meet its
obligations.
C. Growth in Corporate and Structured Finance
In the 1990s, MBIA expanded its risk tolerance and guarantee portfolio to include
domestic and global structured finance guarantees on asset classes including sub-prime
home equity mortgages, manufactured housing finance, aircraft leases and equipment
trusts, bonds backed by hotel taxes, passenger facility charges, commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS), sub-prime credit card receivables, sub-prime loans on new
and used autos, rental car fleets, health care equipment financing, student loans, investor-
owned utilities, credit-default swaps, collateralized debt obligations backed by high-yield
and investment grade bonds (CDOs), synthetic CDOs (portfolios of credit-default swaps
that are then securitized and guaranteed by MBIA), construction loans, emerging market
CDOs, leveraged buyouts, and general corporate and other project finance.
10  Interview with Mr. Jay Brown, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 11
The company’s newer business lines offer risk profiles which are dramatically different
from its taxpayer-supported muni business. Corporations and consumers, the underlying
borrowers of structured finance portfolios, are more likely than cities to default on their
obligations and do, in fact, repudiate their debts in the bankruptcy process. Corporations
also, of course, have no ability to access taxpayer funds to repay their liabilities.
Recent large corporate and project finance transactions highlighted in MBIA’s 2001
Annual Report include a guarantee of $700 million of Eurotunnel junior debt, a $761
million construction financing for a privately owned complex of buildings to be occupied
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (20-year lease, 30-year bond, with MBIA taking
the renewal risk with 57% of the bond principal outstanding in year 2011), and a $1.2
billion securitization of regional jet and turboprop aircraft for BAE Systems. We believe
these and other recent transactions are inconsistent with the company’s “no-loss”
underwriting standard because they depend upon market-based assumptions and
projections which may not be met, in which event losses can be material.
D. Purchase of CapMAC
In February 1998, MBIA accelerated its exposure to the structured finance business by
purchasing CapMAC, a financial guarantee company focused on the structured finance
markets that was at risk of being downgraded as a result of its exposure to the late 1990’s
Asian financial crisis.
E. Reserves
MBIA’s reserves are consistent with its perceived high quality guarantee portfolio, i.e.,
its reserves are extraordinarily low compared to those of other financial institutions.
MBIA and the other monolines’ reserves are the lowest of any non-government-
sponsored financial institution of which we are aware.
At September 30, 2002, MBIA had $568 million of net loss and LAE (7.4 b.p.) against
$764 billion of guarantees, comprised of $483 billion principal of guarantees and $280
billion of interest payment guarantees. Of the $568 million of Loss and LAE, $241
million is allocated to known losses, and the balance of $327 million (4.3 b.p.) is
available for the $763 billion portfolio of guarantees without identified problems.
F. No Acceleration of Obligations
In the event of a default on a financial guarantee obligation, MBIA is generally required
only to pay interest and amortization payments on the defaulted obligation as they come
due. We understand that New York State Insurance Law does not permit the company to
guarantee obligations that accelerate in the event of a default. Article 69 of New York’s
11  Interview with Mr. Chris Jumper, MBIA Underwriter, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 12
Insurance Law regulates “financial guaranty insurance,” which is defined generally in
section 6901(a), as insurance where a loss is payable upon


 failure of any obligor on or issuer of any debt instrument or other
monetary obligation (including equity securities guarantied under a surety
bond, insurance policy or indemnity contract) to pay when due to be paid
by the obligor or scheduled at the time insured to be received by the
holder of the obligation, principal, interest, premium, dividend or purchase
price of or on, or other amounts due or payable with respect to, such
instrument or obligation, when such failure is the result of a financial
default or insolvency or, provided that such payment source is investment
grade, any other failure to make payment, regardless of whether such
obligation is incurred directly or as guarantor by or on behalf of another
obligor that has also defaulted. [Emphasis added]


This prohibition against guaranteeing accelerating obligations benefits MBIA from a
liquidity standpoint because its guarantee obligations are expected to remain deferred
even in periods of high defaults. We quote Moody’s below:


 MBIA’s guarantee is provided through an insurance policy that typically
covers full and timely payment of scheduled principal and interest on debt
securities. The nature of this guarantee is an important facet of the
guarantor’s business profile, because the company is ordinarily not subject
to the acceleration of principal repayments on its insured transactions.
This protection is necessary for a financial guarantor since the leverage
present in its capital structure limits its ability to cover large obligations on
a short-term basis.12
G. Transparency of Financial Disclosure


MBIA prides itself on the quality and transparency of its public disclosure. This high
degree of transparency is critical for rating agencies, regulators, and shareholders because
of the company’s high degree of leverage. All of MBIA’s constituencies need to be able
to monitor the company’s underwriting, underlying asset quality, and overall
performance to establish whether the company’s apparently strong historic track record
and underwriting standards are being maintained.
At MBIA’s recent NY Society of Analysts presentation, Mr. Budnick stated:


 MBIA is extremely regulated and transparent. We have a level of
transparency that no one can even come close to. 13


Standard & Poor’s has reached a similar conclusion, recently rating MBIA one of the
most highly transparent companies in the U.S.14

IV. SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES
MBIA has approximately $8.6 billion of assets and liabilities in five off-balance sheet
Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These SPVs were disclosed for the first time in
MBIA’s 2001 Annual Report although they were acquired along with CapMAC in
February 1998. The company, to date, refuses to disclose any detailed information about
the contents of the SPVs. Instead, management says the rating agencies have signed off
on every SPV asset.15 There appears to be no disclosure of the SPVs in MBIA’s statutory
filings with the New York State Insurance Department. As of December 31, 2001, the
SPVs, their assets and liabilities were as follows16:


 December 31, 2001
 Special Purpose
Vehicle  Assets  Liabilities
 Meridian
Funding  $4,254  $4,218
Company, LLC
 Triple-A One
Funding Corp.  2,762  2,762
 Hemispheres
Funding Corp.  391  384
 Polaris Funding
Company, LLC  313  327
 885 Warehouse,
LLC  59  59
 Total  $7,779  $7,750


By September 30, 2002, the SPVs’ total debt had risen to $8.6 billion. The company is
currently on a road show to sell an additional $500 million of Meridian Funding medium-
term notes.
MBIA has stated that all SPV assets were investment grade at the time of purchase.
However, according to an analyst report’s summary of the offering prospectus for
medium-term notes issued by Meridian Funding, if an asset is not rated by a rating
agency, MBIA itself may determine whether an asset qualifies as investment grade:


 Each investment made by the issuer must have an announced or implied
investment grade rating at the time of purchase. Implied ratings must
include a certification by the guarantor (MBIA) that the investment is of
equal quality to other rated investment grade issues.17


Obviously, such a standard gives MBIA a high degree of discretion as to what assets are
included in the SPVs. In addition, there does not appear to be any obligation for Meridian
to update the rating of any underlying assets. Based on the investments that we have
identified (discussed below), we believe that many of these SPV assets would not
currently receive investment-grade ratings.

Bond Insurer,” Barclays Capital, Seth Glass, Dec. 2, 2002, p. 2.

included in the text shows gross exposures.
17  “Meridian Funding Company, LLC,” Deutsche Bank, January 18, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 14
For example, in one $355 million warehouse facility provided by Triple-A One Funding
to Onyx Acceptance Corp., we have discovered that MBIA consented to the removal of
an earlier requirement that the transaction must be rated investment grade by S&P or
Moody’s. (We will discuss Onyx in further detail below.) On November 30, 2001, MBIA
agreed to the elimination of certain conditions precedent for the effectiveness of this
warehouse facility, including Section 4.1(l) which had required:


 Surety Provider Credit Risk. S&P and Moody’s shall each have informed
the Surety Provider [MBIA] that the transactions contemplated by the
Triple-A One Credit Agreement and the other Operative Documents
(without regard to the Surety Bonds) is an investment-grade risk.


If, indeed, MBIA may subsequently remove the investment-grade rating requirement of
even one of the SPV assets, we believe this calls into question the requirement that the
SPV assets receive an investment-grade rating from a rating agency.
A. MBIA’s Non-Disclosure of SPV Assets
MBIA has stated that it cannot disclose the contents of its SPVs because of
confidentiality agreements that it has executed with the issuers in the SPVs. We are told
by investment banks that have placed medium-term notes (MTNs) and commercial paper
(CP) for the SPVs that they are unaware of the contents of the SPVs. When we asked Mr.
Budnick for additional disclosure on the SPVs, he stated that:


 We have signed strict confidentiality agreements on these assets and
therefore we can make no such disclosure. They [the SPVs] have to be a
black box. That’s the law.18


While Mr. Budnick cites confidentiality agreements for not disclosing the contents of the
SPVs, nearly all confidentiality agreements we have seen permit an exception if the
information is otherwise made public. Because we have been able to identify many of the
SPVs’ assets from public sources, we do not believe that confidentiality agreements
should apply to these assets. Moreover, MBIA’s non-disclosure policy is in opposition to
its supposed high degree of transparency.
B. Identification of the SPV Assets
Solely by analyzing publicly available information, we have been able to identify a
substantial number of the assets in the SPVs and believe they are of questionable quality
and inconsistent with the company’s “no-loss” underwriting policy.
Below we have provided information on all of the assets that we have been able to
identify in the SPVs. The list of assets has not been filtered in any way. We obtained
information about the assets through key-word searches of the SEC EDGAR and Lexis-
Nexis databases.
18  Interview with Mr. Neil G. Budnick, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 15
While we do not know all of the assets in each of the five SPVs, we have obtained
information on $4 billion of assets, representing approximately 60% of the assets of
Triple-A One Funding Corp. and approximately 46% of the assets of Meridian Funding
Company, LLC. Together, Triple-A One and Meridian comprise more than 90% of the
total SPV assets at September 30, 2002.
In providing information below about the SPVs’ underlying assets and counterparties, we
do not purport to provide an exhaustive review of all materials facts. Rather, we are
highlighting sources of risk. We do this in order to assess the SPVs’ assets and
counterparties against MBIA’s stated “no-loss” underwriting standard. If, as we believe,
the SPVs’ assets and counterparties present material risks of loss, then they call into
question MBIA’s “no-loss” underwriting standard. At a minimum, they demand
significant explanations as to how and why they are in MBIA’s portfolio of risks.

• American Business Financial Services, Inc. (Nasdaq: ABFI). A $100 million
mortgage loan warehouse facility. ABFI provides home equity loans and subordinated
investment notes to “credit-impaired” consumer and corporate borrowers and sells and
services small-ticket leases for the acquisition of business equipment. ABFI has an equity
market capitalization of $29 million. In 2001, ABFI was investigated by the Pennsylvania
Attorney General for predatory lending practices and was forced to disgorge certain fees
and pay the Attorney General’s costs. At September 30, 2002, ABFI had $670 million in
subordinated debt outstanding with $385 million maturing within 12 months. ABFI’s 10-
Q from September 30, 2002 includes the following disclosure:
Because we have historically experienced negative cash flows
from operations, our business requires continual access to short
and long-term sources of debt to generate the cash required to fund
our operations. Our cash requirements include funding loan
originations and capital expenditures, repaying existing subord-
inated debt, paying interest expense and operating expenses, and in
connection with our securitizations, funding overcollateralization
requirements and servicer obligations.


Including income from gain-on-sale, ABFI’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges has
declined over the past five years from 2.23 times to 1.19 times .
• Capital Automotive REIT (NASDAQ: CARS). A $173 million non-recourse
loan secured by auto dealerships.
• Commodity Capital Group, Inc. An approximate $200 to $300 million
commercial paper securitization facility to this securitizer of agricultural and other
commodities. In the press release which announced the financing, MBIA was
disclosed as a 27% owner of the equity of Commodity Capital.
• Continental Auto Receivables. A $175 million commercial paper warehouse
facility to Continental Auto Receivables Inc., a private, five-year-old auto loan
originator.
• Credit Card Receivables. $300 million of securities backed by credit card
receivables from an undisclosed Cayman Islands-based issuer.
• ePlus, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUS). A $50 million commercial-paper-backed lease
receivables purchase facility for ePlus, Inc., formerly MLC Holdings, a provider
of equipment lease financing for computers, routers, and other IT related
infrastructure. At the time the company obtained the financing commitment on
December 31, 1998, the company’s CEO stated:


 This CP-backed facility gives the Company access to a different
funding mechanism than its usual sources, without the significant
upfront costs and lower advance rates found in more traditional
conduit programs. The Company


Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 17
provides no credit enhancement, which combined with the 100%
advance rate on the present value of the lease receivables, provides
a low overall cost of funds. This program will allow the company
to fund a larger volume of business on a more efficient basis.
• Exterra Credit Recovery, Inc. (Private). A $50 million to $100
million five-year credit-enhanced warehouse facility for Exterra
Credit Recovery, Inc., a venture-funded private purchaser and
servicer of non-performing credit card debt. At June 30, 2002,
Allied Capital Corp. (NYSE: ALD), a publicly traded investment
company20 valued its investment in Exterra common stock at zero
and its preferred stock investment at 20% of cost.
• HPSC, Inc. (AMEX: HDR). A $450 million warehouse facility
for HPSC, Inc., a provider of practice and equipment financing to
doctors, dentists, and veterinarians. HPSC has a book value of $37
million and a market capitalization of $33 million. Recently, HPSC
announced that an officer of the company committed fraud in
stealing $5 million from the company. As a result of the theft, the
company has been required to restate its financial statements. In
August 2002, in addition to bringing its financial covenants into
line with new covenants required by its new revolving lender,
HPSC received formal waivers of its covenant violations for
periods from January 1996 to June 30, 2002. In September 2002,
the Triple-A One facility was increased from $385 million to its
present $450 million. This facility has a 90% advance rate against
eligible receivables. At September 30, 2002, HPSC had $722
million of on- and off-balance sheet debts including $388 million
drawn on the Triple-A One warehouse facility.
• Onyx Acceptance Corp. (NASDAQ: ONYX). A $355 million
warehouse facility to Onyx Acceptance Corp., a purchaser and
securitizer of used car loans to sub-prime borrowers. The
warehouse facility, which had $214 million drawn at September
30, 2002, provides for a 98% advance rate against eligible
receivables. In November 2001, the facility was amended to
eliminate the requirement that the warehouse facility assets receive
an investment-grade rating from S&P and Moody’s. Onyx’s 10-Q
from September 30, 2002 includes the following disclosure:
 The Company’s primary source of funds from continuing
operations is securitization proceeds. The Company uses the cash
generated from securitizations to pay down outstanding
commercial paper obligations. These facilities are then used to
fund the purchase of Contracts or to finance normal operating
expenses. The Company has historically operated on a negative
cash flow basis from operating activities.


An Onyx competitor, Union Acceptance Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection on
October 31, 2002 citing MBIA’s unwillingness to guarantee future securitizations
as a proximate cause of the filing. Given Onyx’s reliance on its MBIA-


20  Investment companies are required to mark their assets to market.

guaranteed warehouse facility and MBIA-insured securitizations, we believe that
a withdrawal of MBIA’s continued support or a downgrade of MBIA would
substantially threaten Onyx’s viability. Onyx has an equity market capitalization
of $19 million, making its ability to access significant equity capital unlikely.
• Outsourcing Solutions, Inc. (Private, SEC filer). A $100 million non-recourse
five-year warehouse facility for Outsourcing Solutions Inc., the largest private
purchaser of defaulted credit card and other receivables. On November 4, 2002,
S&P downgraded OSI to ‘D’ from ‘C,’ stating that: “the ratings actions follow
OSI’s failure to make its November 1, 2002 interest payment on $100 million
11% senior subordinated notes.” At June 30, 2002, OSI had $531 million of on-
balance sheet debt in addition to this off-balance sheet SPV facility and negative
book equity of $160 million. In OSI’s 2001 10-K, the company indicated that it
would need to restate its financials for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2001 due to “inaccurate financial
reporting of certain transactions.” The company also announced in the 2001 10-K
that it was in breach of the Triple-A One warehouse facility but had obtained a
waiver.

MBIA provided the insurance for $1.7 billion of securitizations issued by AmeriCredit,
the first time MBIA has done so for AmeriCredit.


We believe that AmeriCredit has substantial solvency risk that was recently only
partially addressed through a recent rescue equity issue in which shareholders

• Meridian Funding Company, LLC JPN. A $695 million net structured finance
exposure to an undisclosed credit in Japan. This credit is listed as “Meridian Funding
Company, LLC JPN” on the company’s list of top 50 structured finance credits. The
October 27, 1997 issue of the Asset Sales Report makes reference to Meridian Funding’s
purchase of:


 the portion of a CLO and secured promissory notes acquired by a
Japanese finance company. The program was also amended to
increase the facility limit to $280 million for advertising
receivables, and to increase the facility limit for relocation loans
made to employees of large corporations.


The credit’s substantial size, the continuing deterioration of the Japanese
economy, and the lack of disclosure about the underlying issuer provide reason
for concern about this credit.
C. Asset Quality and Credit Risk


Many of the SPV assets that we have been able to identify are warehouse lines of credit
to poorly capitalized seller-servicers of auto loans, defaulted credit card receivables,
home equity mortgages, and healthcare receivables. Recently, we have seen the
bankruptcy (Union Acceptance) and financial distress (AmeriCredit and others) of a
number of such enterprises. We believe that warehouse facilities are comparable in risk to
short-term secured bridge loans because they rely on new financings in order to be
repaid. Unlike securitizations that are financed by liabilities that typically match the term
of the underlying assets, warehouse facilities are typically shorter-term facilities that
bridge the issuer in accumulating a sufficient amount of assets for eventual securitization.
The warehouse lender’s exit is usually dependent upon the issuer’s ability to access the
securitization markets. Because MBIA often guarantees the securitization that is used to
repay a warehouse facility it has guaranteed or otherwise provided, there is a high degree
of correlation between the likelihood of repayment of an MBIA warehouse facility and
MBIA’s own credit quality. Were MBIA’s credit quality to decline, its guarantee might
be insufficient to support the financing of securitizations, and the repayment of its
warehouse facilities would therefore be at greater risk.
While securitizations and the SPVs’ warehouse facilities are generally considered
separate from a servicer’s estate in bankruptcy, the financial wherewithal of the servicer
is still an important consideration in determining the credit quality of a warehouse facility
or securitization backed by the servicer’s loans or receivables. Moody’s describes the
risks inherent in securitizations of financially distressed seller-servicers below:


 Corporate financial weakness of the seller may negatively affect the
quality of the receivables’ performance. The actual or perceived imminent
bankruptcy of an originator may lead to lower willingness by obligors to
pay, evidenced by higher delinquencies, increased offsets or other dilution
and slower turnover. The seller may be unable to provide sufficient
collateral when needed. The seller may grant more liberal credit
underwriting policies in order to boost sales. Servicing of collections may
deteriorate and


Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 20
there may be increased risk of fraud and the risk of cash being trapped in
the bankrupt originator’s estate. Higher delinquencies, losses and dilutions
may be expected as the originator’s financial performance deteriorates.21


While securitizations of low-credit quality issuers are risky for the above reasons, we
believe that warehouse facilities to these issuers contain even greater risks. This added
risk is due to the fact that warehouse facilities contain the most recent loan and receivable
purchases of a servicer, i.e., assets that are more likely to be of poorer quality because of
reduced underwriting standards, as Moody’s described above. In addition, levels of
overcollateralization are often substantially smaller for warehouse facilities than term
securitizations.
We believe that MBIA’s recent experience with Union Acceptance Corp. (UAC) is an
indication of what can happen when MBIA withdraws its credit support from an issuer. A
press release issued by Fitch in explaining its downgrade of UAC stated:


 Fitch Ratings has lowered the senior unsecured ratings of Union
Acceptance Corp. to 'D' from 'B', following the company's announcement
that it has sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Approximately $43
million of senior unsecured debt is affected by this action. The company
has indicated that its current surety provider [MBIA] has not indicated a
willingness to support future term securitizations as an important
consideration in seeking bankruptcy protection.22


MBIA issued a press release one day after UAC’s bankruptcy filing, stating:
 MBIA Inc. (NYSE: MBI) announced that it does not expect to incur any
losses as a result of yesterday’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing by
Union Acceptance Corporation (UAC).
MBIA has guaranteed 18 securitizations of non-prime auto receivables
originated by UAC and currently has $1.6 billion in net par exposure
($2.4 billion gross par) under its guarantees. UAC is the servicer of the
MBIA insured transactions. [Emphasis added.]


UAC’s complaint against MBIA in the bankruptcy explains that MBIA has guaranteed
only 17 UAC securitizations. 23 According to the Complaint, MBIA’s 18th exposure to
UAC is not, in fact, a securitization as stated in the press release, but rather a full faith
and credit guarantee of a $350 million warehouse facility provided by Bank of America,
a loan that suffers from similar risks to MBIA’s SPV warehouse facilities.
Without MBIA’s guarantee on future securitizations, UAC was forced to file for
bankruptcy, leaving MBIA exposed on this $350 million warehouse facility as well as the
outstanding securitizations. Alternatively, if MBIA had continued to provide wraps for
future UAC securitizations, it would find itself with even greater exposure to this poorly

Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 21
performing servicer. As MBIA’s experience with UAC suggests, doing business with
financially weak servicers is a risky proposition.
D. Liquidity Risk of SPVs
In a typical wrapped transaction, an investor views the underlying assets of the
securitization as the primary source of repayment and MBIA’s guarantee as a secondary
source of payment. The prospectus for a wrapped securitization provides substantial
detail on the quality and performance of the assets to be securitized. In addition, investors
are provided with rating agency review and regular updates on asset quality and
performance. Investors assess the quality of the assets in a transaction and are comforted
by the two layers of protection afforded by such a structure – first, a Moody’s, S&P,
and/or Fitch-rated investment-grade portfolio of assets on which investors are provided
substantial information, and second, MBIA’s AAA rated guarantee.
MBIA’s SPV commercial paper purchasers, MTN buyers, and banks receive no
information on the underlying assets and, therefore, require MBIA’s guarantee of all the
assets in the SPV and a direct repayment guarantee. Unlike its traditional guarantee
business where MBIA is a secondary source of repayment, for the SPVs, MBIA is, in
effect, the primary source of repayment.
Meridian Funding Company, LLC’s private placement memorandum24 states that MTN
investors should rely on MBIA rather than on the underlying assets as a source of
repayment:


 Any investment decision to purchase the notes should be based solely on
the claims paying ability of the Guarantor (MBIA).25


Because these investors do not know the contents of the SPV and because MBIA can
determine their credit quality, the company has an unusual degree of flexibility with the
contents of the SPVs.
Slightly more than $3 billion of the $8.6 billion of SPV debt at September 30, 2002 was
in the form of commercial paper (CP).26 MBIA should, in our view, be considered the de
facto issuer of the outstanding commercial paper because MBIA guarantees the liabilities
of the SPVs and the SPVs would not stand alone without MBIA’s guarantees. The rating
agencies, however, do not consider the commercial paper to be debt of MBIA or,
alternatively, are unaware that MBIA, through its SPVs, has this short-term debt
outstanding:
24  While we were able to obtain a copy of a private placement memorandum from one of
the underwriters of a medium-term note (MTN) issuance by Meridian Funding Company,
LLC, MBIA’s largest SPV, which comprises $5.3 billion of the approximate $8.6 billion
of assets in SPVs at September 30, 2002, we have chosen not to cite information from
that document because it purports to impose a confidentiality obligation on any recipient
of the memorandum.
25  As quoted in “Meridian Funding Company, LLC,” Deutsche Bank Research, January
19, 2002, p. 1.

November 5, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 22


The guarantor’s exposure to liquidity risk is relatively modest, given the
low historical frequency and severity of insured defaults, coupled with the
nature of its insurance contract, which protects against the acceleration of
principal payments. Furthermore, MBIA does not issue short-term debt,
lessening the need for significant amounts of back up liquidity.27
[Emphasis added.]


We believe this SPV’s CP creates significant liquidity risk for MBIA because, in the
event of a decline in MBIA’s actual or perceived credit rating, these CP buyers may
withdraw their support of Triple-A One Funding, requiring the SPV to draw upon its
outstanding bank liquidity lines.
MBIA provides no disclosure about Triple-A One’s liquidity facilities; however, CP
conduit liquidity facilities typically contain two “outs” which would allow banks not to
fund. These outs include bankruptcy of the issuer and/or insufficient asset values to cover
the outstanding commercial paper.28
Since the assets of Triple-A One Funding are AAA rated only because of MBIA’s
guarantee, a decline in MBIA’s actual or perceived credit rating will substantially reduce
the value and marketability of the SPV assets. In light of the nominal equity in this SPV
($25,000) as we will discuss further below, we believe it is highly probable that the
market value of the SPV’s assets will not exceed its outstanding commercial paper in the
event of an actual or perceived downgrade of MBIA, increasing the risk of a liquidity
facility covenant violation. In the event Triple-A One Funding sought to draw down on
its bank facilities to repay expiring commercial paper, the liquidity banks may require an
audit of the market value of the SPV assets before funding.
Even if the bank lines were drawn, conduit liquidity facilities usually extend for no more
than 364 days. As a result of the short-term nature of this financing, MBIA would still
face a significant short-term liquidity threat.
This same analysis is likely to hold true to a less significant degree for the SPVs that are
funded by MTNs, for these MTN holders often have put rights in the event of default by
the financial guarantor on any of its guarantee obligations.
As a result of the relatively short-term nature of a substantial portion of MBIA’s SPV
obligations and the potential threat of acceleration of the MTNs, we believe that the SPVs
27  “MBIA Insurance Corp.,” Moody’s Investor Service, August 2002, p. 8.
28  “The covenants on liquidity facilities typically give the banks few ‘outs’. Usually the
bank is not required to lend if the issuing vehicle is insolvent but this is unlikely given the
limited nature of its activities. Often the bank is also not required to lend if the value of
the assets in the portfolio falls below that of the outstanding commercial paper. But this
is usually unlikely given the short maturity of commercial paper and the typical
requirement that the value of assets should exceed that of commercial paper by a margin
at the time of issue. In effect, the banks would be likely to take on the credit risk on the
asset portfolio before its value could fall sufficiently to expose investors to loss. Banks
are, however, protected by any credit enhancement once they have financed the assets.”
“Risk Transfer Between Banks, Insurance Companies and Capital Markets: an
overview,” Financial Stability Review: December 2001, page 137. [Emphasis added.]
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 23
pose a significant short-term liquidity risk for MBIA. MBIA’s guarantee of the SPV’s
large liabilities create a much greater threat to the company’s viability when compared to
an off-balance sheet obligation backed by underlying assets of known and independently
verified quality and supported by substantive third-party equity.
E. Accounting Requirements for SPVs
We do not believe that MBIA’s SPVs qualify for off-balance sheet treatment under
current or proposed accounting rules. MBIA’s five off-balance sheet SPVs, with $8.6
billion of debt guaranteed by MBIA, are each capitalized with approximately $25,000 of
equity:


 The current conduit ownership structure is as follows: Meridian and
Polaris are each owned 99% by Global Securitization Services
(www.gssnyc.com) and 1% by MBIA. Triple-A One Funding is 100%
owned by GSS. Hemispheres is 100% owned by Lord Securities
(www.lordspv.com). The third-party ownership is for non-consolidation
purposes. The amount of equity in the conduits is nominal (<$25,000).
[Emphasis added.]29


The $125,000 total of third-party equity equates to 0.0014% of total SPV assets or $14
for each $1,000,000 of debt, well below the minimum 3% threshold required under
GAAP for non-consolidation of SPVs. In addition, this equity capital is provided by
investors who receive administrative and other fees from the SPVs.
MBIA’s 2001 Annual Report provides a summary of the GAAP requirements for an SPV
to be considered off-balance sheet:


 Under current accounting guidelines, MBIA does not include the accounts
of the SPVs in the consolidations of the MBIA group. When a SPV does
not meet the formal definition of a qualifying special purpose vehicle
under SFAS 140, the decision as to whether or not to consolidate depends
on the applicable accounting principles for non-qualifying SPVs.
Consideration is given to, for example, [Test One:] whether a third party
has made a substantive equity investment in the SPV; [Test Two:] which
party has voting rights, if any; [Test Three:] who makes decisions about
assets in the SPV; and [Test Four:] who is at risk of loss. The SPVs would
be consolidated if MBIA were to retain or acquire control over the risk
and the rewards of the assets in the SPVs. [2001 Annual Report, p. 47.]


When examined under the standards for non-consolidation provided by MBIA, we
believe that MBIA has failed three of the four tests in actual fact, and the fourth, voting
control, in substance because effective control over the SPV is apparently immediately
transferred to MBIA upon the SPVs formation:
• Test One: No third party has made a substantive equity investment – $125,000 of equity
supporting $8.6 billion of debt is clearly not substantive, and the equity has been invested
by parties that receive fees for providing accounting and other
29  Email from Mr. Kevin T. Brown, Investor Relations, August 21, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 24
services to the SPVs. FASB and SEC guidelines currently require a minimum of 3%
equity provided by a third-party investor who is not otherwise affiliated with the issuer of
the SPV.30 The proposed new FASB regulations for SPVs require a minimum of 10%
third-party equity.
• Tests Two and Three: While the non-MBIA board members of the SPVs may legally
have voting control over the SPVs, the SPVs have engaged MBIA to administer, invest
and deal in the SPVs’ assets. In fact, all documents signed by the SPVs that we have been
able to find are signed by MBIA as attorney in fact.
• Test Four: As guarantor of the SPVs assets and liabilities, MBIA is at risk of loss. It
appears, as well, that MBIA already receives whatever profits the SPVs earn. Those
profits should be substantial because of the large interest-rate spread between the cost of
the SPVs’ funds as a AAA credit versus the higher rates charged to the SPVs’ far lower
quality borrowers. According to the 2001 Annual Report, however, the profits of the
SPVs are nominal:


 [G]iven the inconsequential level of residual profits of these entities, the
consolidated net income of the Company would not materially change.
[2001 Annual Report, p. 30]
In light of this statement, we infer that, through administrative, advisory and other
fees charged to the SPVs, MBIA is already receiving whatever profits might
otherwise be available from them.


As a result of failing these tests, we believe MBIA must consolidate the SPVs and should
have been consolidating them since they were acquired along with CapMAC in February
1998.
F. Where Will MBIA Consolidate the SPVs?
We understand that MBIA is now telling investors and analysts that it intends to
consolidate the SPV debt at the holding company, MBIA Inc., rather than at the AAA
insurance subsidiary, MBIA Insurance Corp., which is the guarantor of the SPV
obligations. If MBIA were successful in convincing its auditors of its proposed new
treatment, MBIA Insurance Corp. would continue to appear to be debt-free.
While there is little if any difference in economic substance between these two
alternatives, we believe the company will have substantial difficulty consolidating the
SPVs at the holding company under the newly proposed SPV consolidation rules. The
new rules require SPVs to be consolidated with their “primary beneficiary” if they do not
effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. The primary beneficiary of an SPV
is deemed to be the parent of the SPV.31
30  SEC guidance EITF 90-15 provided that 3% should be considered the minimum
amount of equity for purposes of non-consolidation.
31  “Financial Accounting Series Proposed Interpretation: Consolidation of Certain
Special-Purpose Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51,” p. ii.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 25
In summary, the new FASB rules provide that an SPV should be consolidated with its
primary beneficiary if the primary beneficiary provides to the SPV any one or more of
the following which are known as variable interests (an interest through which an
enterprise provides financial support to an SPV):
• Subordinated loans
• Leases
• Management or other service contracts
• Referral agreements
• Options to acquire assets
• Purchase contracts
• Credit enhancements
• Guarantees
• Derivative instruments
In addition, an SPV previously qualifying for non-consolidation shall also be
consolidated with the primary beneficiary if the primary beneficiary meets two of the
following three criteria:
• It has authority to purchase and sell assets for the SPV and has sufficient discretion in
exercising that authority to significantly affect the revenues, expenses, gains, and losses
of the SPV.
• It provides a guarantee, a back-up lending arrangement, or other form of liquidity,
credit, or asset support that is subordinate to the interests of other parties.
• It receives a fee that is not market based.32


It is clear to us that MBIA Insurance Corp. is the primary beneficiary of each of the SPVs
because it is the guarantor of assets, liabilities, and liquidity facilities, serves as the
administrative servicer and manager, and receives substantially all of the economic
profits from the SPVs.
Under the new rules, if MBIA’s SPVs were to be consolidated at the holding company,
MBIA Inc., and not at MBIA Insurance Corp., then the holding company would have to
invest a minimum of 10% or $860 million dollars of equity in the SPVs, which is far
greater than MBIA Inc.’s available resources. Even if MBIA Inc. were able to raise the
$860 million of required equity, we believe non-consolidation treatment would fail
because of the holding company’s affiliation and reliance on funding from its insurance
subsidiary.33
32  “Financial Accounting Series Proposed Interpretation: Consolidation of Certain
Special-Purpose Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51,” p. 8.
33  In addition, we would expect the purchasers of the $300 million of MBIA Inc.’s
unsecured notes that were issued this August in a Goldman Sachs’ led transaction to have
been informed in the event the company intended to consolidate an additional $8.6 billion
plus of debt onto the holding company’s
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 26
balance sheet. There is no mention of the SPVs or the potential for additional
consolidated debt in the transaction offering memorandum. Similarly, we would be
surprised that the holding company could still achieve a AA rating with nearly $10 billion
of debt in light of its reliance on its insurance subsidiary’s dividends as its primary source
of liquidity.
G. Consolidation Will Have No Effect, According to MBIA
Until the publication of MBIA’s 2001 Annual Report, an investor examining its SEC or
statutory filings would have concluded that MBIA’s insurance subsidiary was debt-free.
We now understand that the company has guaranteed $8.6 billion of indebtedness of
which a substantial portion is commercial paper and is supported by assets of
questionable quality.
MBIA has publicly stated that it intends to bring the SPVs on balance sheet as soon as the
new FASB requirements for SPVs are promulgated. The company further explains that
the rating agencies have indicated that they will ignore the consolidation of the SPV
indebtedness when these entities are brought on balance sheet because the debt will be
offset by an approximately equal amount of AAA rated assets.
We believe that this analysis is flawed because the only reason the assets in the SPVs are
rated AAA is because they are guaranteed by MBIA. We would also argue that MBIA’s
guarantee of these assets should be ignored for the purpose of valuing these assets when
they are consolidated on the company’s balance sheet. MBIA cannot benefit from its own
guarantee of securities because the guarantee is, in effect, an inter-company transaction.
While the value and liquidity requirements of these $8.6 billion of debts is a certainty, the
value and liquidity of the assets which support them are not. The SPVs have 99.9996%
leverage held against their assets – $8.6 billion of assets supporting $8.6 billion of
liabilities. As such, we believe that only if the SPVs’ assets were liquid and AAA on a
stand-alone basis should the rating agencies consider offsetting the impact of this
additional debt on MBIA’s balance sheet in determining the company’s leverage and
rating.
In light of the apparently low and deteriorating quality of the assets in the SPVs, we
believe that their consolidation will require MBIA to write down these carrying values
significantly. Even if MBIA were not required to mark these assets to market upon
consolidation, we believe that investors should only consider their fair value and liquidity
without the benefit of MBIA’s guarantee in determining the company’s credit quality,
liquidity risk, and asset values.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 27
H. What Purpose Do the SPVs Serve?
We believe that if investors were to become aware of the quality of the assets in the
SPVs, they might not be willing to purchase commercial paper or medium-term notes
backed by these assets. Investors in securitizations backed by MBIA rely on the quality
and structuring of the underlying assets in addition to the company’s guarantee. As a
result, investor review provides effective limits on what MBIA can guarantee. Because
the contents of the SPVs are unknown, however, MBIA has the flexibility to include
whatever assets it wishes as long as one rating agency or MBIA itself deems the asset
investment grade at the time of its initial inclusion in the SPV.
As a result, MBIA can act like a bank by indirectly (via the SPV) making a loan to
borrowers without third-party investors’ review of the quality of the loan and the
borrower. MBIA can, therefore, provide liquidity to servicers and other borrowers which
do not have access to the equity markets because they are either private, have
microcapitalizations, have untested securitization programs or who could not otherwise
obtain equity or debt capital from other financial institutions.
This flexibility is valuable to MBIA because it can also support issuers for which the
company has substantial additional exposure that would be put at risk in the event of the
issuers’ failure to access other capital.
MBIA’s SPVs have grown significantly. Even since December 31, 2001, the SPVs
liabilities have increased substantially, i.e., from $7.8 billion to approximately $8.6
billion at September 30, 2002. The company is currently on a road show to sell an
additional $500 million of Meridian Funding MTNs. In light of MBIA’s policy and
statements regarding transparency, we find the growth in “black box” SPVs troubling.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 28
V. CDOS AND CREDIT-DEFAULT SWAPS (CDS)
Guarantees of cash CDOs and synthetic CDOs (securitizations of pooled single-name
CDS) have become large sources of growth in par insured for MBIA in recent years. In
the third-quarter operating supplement, MBIA disclosed its CDO balances at August 31,
2002, which comprised 13.6% of its total par insured at Q3 2002. 34 At August 31, MBIA
had gross CDO exposure of $75.6 billion with net par of $65.9 billion. The company
provides no details on the $9.7 billion of par insured that has been reinsured. While the
company’s recent writings of CDO guarantees have focused on AAA tranches, its earlier
history in the business began with guarantees of BBB tranches of CDOs.
A. MBIA’s Multi-Billion Mark-to-Market Loss on CDOs
MBIA recently disclosed the date of execution and original ratings of the underlying
credits it has guaranteed through credit derivative transactions. We asked three of the
most active dealers in the credit derivatives market to provide mid-market quotes to price
transactions of comparable vintage and rating to MBIA’s CDO portfolio. One of the
dealers elected not to provide quotes. The two other dealers provided market quotes, but
required that we keep their identities anonymous.
Because CDOs are pools of diversified corporate credits and because MBIA participated
in numerous CDO transactions each year, the company’s credit exposure is likely to be
sufficiently diversified so that their values can be approximated by this admittedly
simplistic approach.
Based on these dealers’ quotes, we estimate MBIA’s mark-to-market losses to be
approximately $5.3 billion to $7.7 billion, i.e., from nearly 100% to over 140% of
MBIA’s total equity capital.

34  The rating agencies, while generally slow to downgrade CDOs, fell materially behind
over the summer on downgrading these credits. While all other information in the
company’s third quarter earnings release and operating supplement was provided as of
September 30, 2002, the company chose to provide disclosure about its CDO and CDS
portfolio as of August 31, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 29
The above table is from the August 31st Operating Supplement and includes our addition
of columns labeled “MTM Value” and “MTM Loss” or mark-to-market value and loss
for each dealer. MTM Loss is obtained by multiplying the MTM value, which is a
percentage of face amount, by the amount outstanding in a particular year and subtracting
that amount from the amount outstanding.35
Admittedly, our estimate is imprecise. In light of the fact that MBIA is required to mark
these exposures to market under SFAS 133, however, we find it surprising that the
company’s total unrealized mark-to-market losses on its entire derivative portfolio
(including interest rate swaps etc.) are reported at September 30, 2002 as being only
$35.5 million.
The company appears to be marking its portfolio to its internal models rather than dealer
quotes. On the third-quarter conference call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned
management about how it marked to market its CDOs:


 Charles Schorin, Morgan Stanley:
 I have a couple of questions about your super-senior exposure business of
CDO’s. First of all, what’s the extent and frequency of your mark to
market because right now, looking at the CDO market or the CDS market,
the market seems to be implying bigger credit risks than perhaps the rating
of the underlying would suggest.
 Gary Dunton, MBIA President and COO
 What is the frequency that we mark them?
 Charles Schorin:
 Yes, and to what extent are you marking based upon rating changes of the
underlying references or are you doing it based upon where the CDS – the
credit defaults – are actually trading?
Gary Dunton
 We do it quarterly. It’s based on a model we have. It looks at spreads. It
looks at ratings. It looks at interest rates.
 Charles Schorin:
 You are incorporating market activity.
 Gary Dunton:
 Yes.


35  The reader will note that the 1996 deals were valued at a higher mark-to-market value
than the 1997 and 1998 transactions by Dealer A. According to Dealer A, this is due to
the fact that the 1996 CDOs missed the telecommunication financing boom which began
later in 1997 and 1998.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 30
While Mr. Dunton states, when prompted, that he is “incorporating market activity” in
the company’s pricing models, this is not the same as marking to market. In any event,
we are at loss to explain the enormous gap between dealer mid-market pricing, that
shows the company with a $5.3 to $7.7 billion pre-tax loss, and the $35.5 million loss
reported by the company.
We quote below from a Morgan Stanley research report written by Ms. Alice Schroeder,
in which she comments on insurance company managements’ preference for ignoring
mark-to-market adjustments in earnings:


 We understand that managements often sincerely believe that mark-to-
market impairments are not permanent, and should not flow through
earnings. However, we view that as simply an argument for earnings
smoothing. We also do not view the market value change of a CDO as
equivalent to a change in value of an investment portfolio. Insurers are the
risk-bearing counterparty in CDO transactions; this is part of their core
underwriting operations. The mark-to-market can be viewed as a
consensus market measure of the required loss reserve on an insurance
policy.
 Companies (not just insurers) usually would prefer to recognize some
losses only after they are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. That is a
natural human tendency called “persistence” and is what keeps football
teams trying when they are 10 points down with one minute to play in the
fourth quarter. It’s a good quality in individuals, but can lead to bad
accounting without some checks and balances in the system.36


We understand that MBIA has been telling investors and analysts recently that it is not
required to mark to market its cash CDO portfolio because it believes these guarantees
are more akin to insurance contracts than derivative obligations. We quote Ms.
Schroeder’s thoughts on this issue:


 [A]nother area of investor focus has been the underlying accounting for
these transactions. In general, credit default swaps and the guarantees on
collateralized debt obligations are considered derivative instruments for
accounting purposes. As such, they must be marked to market, with the
resulting gain or loss flowing through net income.37


There is no dispute, however, that the company must mark to market its synthetic CDO
portfolio which comprises $44 billion of its $65 billion of exposure and which we
estimate to account for $2 to $3 billion of the $5.3 to $7.7 billion MTM loss based upon
the dealer quotes.38
Whether or not the company marks its CDO exposure to market, MBIA is apparently
underwater by billions of dollars on these investments. While the MTM values do not
necessarily mean that MBIA will ultimately realize billions of dollars in losses, these
values are the market’s best current estimate of expected losses on these transactions.
36  “Insurance & Risk Briefing,” Alice Schroeder, Morgan Stanley, August 8, 2002, p. 6.
37  “Insurance & Risk Briefing,” Alice Schroeder, Morgan Stanley, August 8, 2002, p. 5.
38  The synthetic CDO market did not represent a meaningful part of MBIA’s CDO
portfolio until 2001. Since then, it has accounted for nearly all of the company’s CDO
business. The greater seniority of these synthetic transactions, coupled with the fact that
they are two years old or less, accounts for their higher values.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 31
B. Liquidity Risks of Credit-Default Swaps
MBIA's guarantees of credit-default swaps create substantial potential liquidity risks for
the company. When the reference obligation of a CDS defaults, the guarantor must either
repurchase for par the reference obligation that is put to it, or for cash-settled swaps, pay
the difference between par value and recovery value. The amount of this payment can be
as much as 90% or more of the par value of the insurance and has averaged 79% in recent
periods based on average recovery values of 21%.39 MBIA has $44 billion of net
exposure to CDS primarily through guarantees of synthetic CDOs.
MBIA states that it no longer guarantees single-name CDS,40 however, because of the
company’s large exposure to synthetic CDOs which are comprised of pooled CDS, the
company has, in effect, re-entered the single-name CDS business, but on a much larger
scale. While each synthetic CDO transaction contains a diversified pool of 100 or so
equally weighted credits, there are a limited number of issuers which trade actively in the
CDS market and which are included in synthetic transactions. According to active
synthetic CDO issuers, there are approximately 200 to 250 credits that represent 80% or
more of the CDS that underlie these transactions.
While each transaction is diversified usually with 100 names, the limited universe of
actively included names makes the company’s effective overall exposure meaningfully
less diversified on a consolidated basis. Assuming MBIA’s $44 billion of net exposure as
of August 31, 2002 of which 80%, or $35.2 billion, is represented by these 200 to 250
names, one can determine that MBIA has approximately $140 to $180 million of
exposure to each credit. This exposure is spread across numerous CDO transactions, but
should be considered on a consolidated basis when analyzing MBIA’s credit exposure.
If the overcollateralization of MBIA’s synthetic CDOs is burned off through a sufficient
number of defaults, each subsequent default will lead to the same loss for each credit as if
MBIA had entered into 200 to 250 separate single-name transactions with $140 to $180
million of exposure to each credit.
C. Regulatory Issues41
When we asked the company how they were able to guarantee credit-default swaps in
light of the New York State Insurance Department’s prohibition against financial
guarantors guaranteeing obligations that can accelerate, Mr. Mark Gold, the company’s
senior CDO underwriter, explained that the company guarantees credit-default swaps
indirectly through an "orphaned subsidiary" which enters into the business directly and
whose obligations are in turn guaranteed by MBIA.
39  “Default & Recovery Rates of Corporate Bond Issuers,” Moody’s Investor Service,
February 2002, p. 4.
40  The company apparently has only $300 million of single-name CDS outstanding.
41  We met with representatives of the New York State Insurance Department (personnel
from its Property & Casualty department who are involved in the oversight of MBIA as
well as personnel from the Capital Markets department) and shared with them the facts
and opinions discussed in this report.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 32
This “orphaned subsidiary” is called LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC. The disclosure
concerning LaCrosse in the 2001 Annual Report is illuminating:


 LaCrosse Financial Products, LLC (LaCrosse), formerly King Street
Financial Products, LLC, was created in December 1999 to offer clients
structured derivative products, such as credit default, interest rate and
currency swaps. While MBIA does not have a direct ownership interest in
LaCrosse, it is consolidated in the financial statements of the Company on
the basis that substantially all rewards and risks are borne by MBIA. (AR
2001, p. 43). [Emphasis added.]


According to CDS dealers, MBIA refers to LaCrosse as an “SPV transformer.” In
essence, LaCrosse “transforms” obligations that MBIA cannot guarantee directly into
ones it believes it can guarantee indirectly. LaCrosse is a minimally capitalized SPV, the
equity of which is owned by a nominee. It relies on MBIA Insurance Corp.’s guarantee of
its indebtedness to support its obligations.42
MBIA Insurance Corp’s statutory filings with the NY State Insurance Department state
that the company has no derivative exposure:


 MBIA has not entered into any transactions classified as derivative
instruments.43


Because LaCrosse does not have sufficient wherewithal to meet its CDS obligations
without full credit support from MBIA, we believe this statement obscures the company’s
true credit derivative exposure.
D. Where Did MBIA Go Wrong in its CDO and CDS Businesses?
According to the company, MBIA determined its pricing and capital requirements for
CDO and CDS guarantees based on an internal model it developed which is similar to the
Moody’s model. The model takes into consideration the credit rating of issuers, and from
that, determines the probability of default and the recovery rates in default. The model is
based on a 30-year study of corporate defaults in determining default probabilities and
recovery rates.
In our interview with Mr. Gold, he acknowledged that he was concerned about MBIA’s
CDO and CDS performance so far:


 We are mindful of the poor performance of the segment which makes us
wonder what is going on. Loss rates are well above our mean expectations,
well in excess of historical levels, and not in keeping with actuarial
assumptions. At the same time, we are putting on a large amount of
exposure.


We suspect that MBIA has not properly considered the risks inherent in its reliance on
internal financial models even if these models are apparently corroborated by the rating
42  Interview with Mr. Mark Gold, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
43  Annual  Statement of  MBIA Insurance Corporation of Armonk in the State of New
York to the Insurance Department of the State of New York for the Year Ended 2001,  p.

agencies. While the company would not tell us how much capital it holds against its
super-senior CDS exposure, Mr. Gold explained that the rating agencies assign as little as
10 basis points of capital against these risks.
MBIA’s pricing of its synthetic CDO guarantees has historically been extraordinarily low
at 4 to 7 bps of the guarantee amount per annum. FSA’s and Ambac’s recent withdrawal
from the CDS market,44 however, and the poor performance of these transactions led to a
near doubling of pricing in the market to between 9 and 12 bps per annum for so-called
“super-senior” CDS, and in recent months to levels of 20 bps or more.
While the pricing of super-senior CDS has doubled and perhaps tripled in recent months,
we believe that it remains extremely low for the risks taken by MBIA and other writers of
this insurance. The fact that FSA and Ambac withdrew from this market suggests that
they have come to similar conclusions about the inadequacy of reward compared with the
risk of this product.
We believe that the risk-reward ratio of super-senior CDS for the seller of insurance is
extremely unattractive. MBIA, however, views super-senior CDS as perhaps its most
profitable product. Based on MBIA’s internal capital models, the company estimates that
it earns between 40% and 100% Risk Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC) for these
guarantees.45 Perhaps this explains the company’s enormous growth of this guarantee
product. MBIA has written approximately $30 billion of synthetic CDO guarantees in the
first nine months of 2002.
We believe that MBIA calculates such a high RAROC for its synthetic CDOs because it
charges itself only approximately 10-12 bps of capital for these transactions and
establishes reserves for losses equal to 12% of premium or only 1.2 to 1.4 bps on these
transactions. We believe MBIA’s capital requirements and reserving assumptions for this
business are understated.
MBIA’s super-senior transactions apparently have attachment points of 88% to 92% of
the face value of investment-grade CDOs, implying 8% to 12% overcollateralization for
these transactions. While these levels may be sufficient to insure near-zero defaults under
MBIA’s models to a 99.99% confidence level, we believe they are likely to be inadequate
for real world conditions.
We believe that the apparent failure of MBIA’s models to predict CDO and CDS defaults
is due to several factors which include: (1) the adverse selection of credits in these
transactions, (2) the fact that rating agency data do not include restructuring as a credit
event, (3) inadequate consideration of correlation risk, and (4) problems with modeling
low-probability events.

Chief Risk Officer, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.

1. Adverse Selection
The structurers of CDOs and CDS do not include a random selection of credits in their
securitizations. Rather, they include credits on which they would like to hedge their risk,
ones for which they believe the credit rating overstates the actual credit quality of the
issue, and ones for which there is significant Wall Street demand for credit insurance.
Many of the participants in the credit-default swap market are banks that have access to
superior information and buy protection on credits that they believe are deteriorating.46
As a result, CDOs represent an adversely selected group of credits for MBIA, and,
therefore, historical performance of the investment-grade credits will likely understate the
eventual losses borne by CDO investors and guarantors like MBIA.
In recent years, so-called arbitrage CDOs have been drivers for the creation of CDOs and
CDS. Moody’s explains:


 The two primary sources of current demand for CDOs are regulatory and
economic arbitrage. Regulatory arbitrage relates to the opportunity to
reduce regulatory costs (i.e., capital charges) while economic arbitrage
relates to market mispricing of credit risks. Economic arbitrage should
remain strong over the medium term, but regulatory arbitrage beyond the
next couple of years is more questionable as new bank regulations could
impact regulatory arbitrage opportunities currently enjoyed by banks. That
being said, economic arbitrage and the use of CDOs for balance sheet
management or genuine credit risk transfer still represent long-term
opportunities for the financial guarantors.47 [Emphasis added.]


Moody’s explains that economic arbitrage is due to the mispricing of credit risk. While
we agree with Moody’s characterization of economic arbitrage as the mispricing of credit
risk, we believe the mispricing is not done by the public market for credit, as Moody’s
implies, but rather by the monoline insurers and the rating agencies. The problem with
the rating agency models, as one former S&P employee now employed in the credit-
derivative department of a major bank told us, is that the rating agencies can only accept
that “an A is an A is an A,” or in other words that any A rated credit is no different than
any other A rated credit.
The credit-default swap market, however, prices credit minute-by-minute and with
greater resolution than the rating agencies. As a result, there are many credits which trade
at substantially wider credit-default spreads than other similarly rated credits. For
example, Campbell Soup, an A- credit, recently traded at a bid/ask spread of 40/50 bps on
the same day that Aon Corp., also an A- credit, traded at 340/380 bps. Despite the fact
that these credits are rated the same, the market apparently believes that there is nearly an
order of magnitude higher probability of default for Aon than for Campbell Soup. The
rating agencies, however, do not acknowledge this difference, for if Aon’s probability of
default were higher, it should carry a lower credit rating.
46  E.g., “Credit Derivatives as a Leading Indicator of Bond Market Problems,” Standish

September, 2002, page 3.
47  “Financial Guaranty,” Moody’s Investor Service, January, 2002, p. 7.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 35
Because the rating agency models for CDS securitizations generally do not discriminate
between different issuers with the same credit rating in determining the overall rating of a
CDO transaction, dealers assembling a CDO transaction have an incentive to include
CDS of issuers whose credit spreads are wider than comparably rated credits. By
including the widest spread credits of a particular rating, the dealer can maximize its
profit from the transaction.48
If the pricing of credit risk as determined by the trading of CDS is a better indicator of
default risk than the underlying company’s rating, then the arbitrage profits being earned
by dealers on CDOs are due to the arbitrage between a credit rating and the market’s
assessment of credit risk. The CDS market has been determined to be a good leading
indicator of the probability of default.49 This is somewhat due to the fact that rating
agencies are slower to change their ratings.
In sum, investors in the CDS, equity and debt markets are risk capitalists who seek to
profit when market mispricing creates opportunity. We believe, therefore, that the
implied ratings of credits as determined by the capital markets are the best indicator of
credit quality. As a result, by relying on CDO models that primarily use rating agency
inputs for their estimations of default, we believe MBIA is more likely to have
underpriced and underestimated the risk of loss in these transactions.
2. Rating Agency Default Data Do Not Include Restructuring As a Default
Synthetic CDOs and credit derivatives rely on the definitions of credit events as
promulgated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in its 1999
ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions. Market convention for corporate obligations
defines a credit event as failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration, repudiation or
moratorium, and restructuring.
One problem with the longitudinal default studies compiled by the rating agencies for
corporate defaults on which MBIA bases its models is that the definition of default in the
default studies does not include restructuring. Moody’s describes this risk:


 These non-“default” defaults [e.g., restructurings] will introduce risk to
the financial guarantors which is very different from that experienced by
them in the operation of their financial guaranty business. Under a
financial guaranty the guarantor is obligated to make a payment only when
insufficient funds from the issuer are available to pay


48  Some observers have suggested that synthetic CDO issuers have an incentive which
offsets the adverse selection concern, i.e., they have an incentive to select underlying
CDS with a low risk of default because of their ownership of the first-loss, 1-2% equity
tranche of a CDO. We understand from dealers, however, that they write down their
equity interest to zero at the time of the closing of the transaction, and can still make a
large profit assuming their retained equity is ultimately found to be worthless because of
the substantial arbitrage.
49  “Credit Derivatives as a Leading Indicator of Bond Market Problems,” Standish
Mellon Asset Management, Marc P. Seidner, David M. Horsfall, & Benjamin W. Li,

regularly scheduled debt service. In those cases the Moody’s rating on the
underlying asset will accurately predict whether and when a payment can
be expected to be made. As the asset’s rating goes lower on the rating
scale, the chance of the guarantor having to make a payment because of
the asset’s default increases. There is no such prediction available for
those credit events [e.g., restructuring] which do not constitute defaults
within the meaning employed by Moody’s.50


Therefore, since CDS consider restructuring as a default, the fact that the rating agencies’
longitudinal studies do not include restructuring as a default means that these studies will
underestimate the risk of loss in CDO transactions.
3. Correlation Risk
As stock markets decline, investors’ appetite for risk similarly declines. During periods of
equity devaluation, companies’ ability to access debt and equity capital is also
diminished. These two factors together explain why the overall market for corporate
credits can collectively worsen in the event of a loss of investor confidence, a global
recession/depression, a substantial rise in energy prices, continued global terrorism, or
even an accounting crisis or other negative multi-industry event. We believe that MBIA
has not properly considered the correlation risks among different industries and with
respect to credit conditions generally. Correlation risk is a large risk for the writer of
super-senior exposures. The environment in which the super-senior insurer is likely to
pay claims is likely to be one in which all credit events become correlated, i.e., a
substantial decline in overall corporate credit quality and/or a substantial stock market
decline.
Morgan Stanley’s Alice Schroeder has also commented recently on the risks that are
associated with writing credit insurance. Below, we provide an excerpt from a research
report in which she compares credit insurance to writing catastrophe insurance on
correlated risks:


 Another concern with this business is that writing large amounts of credit
insurance is essentially akin to taking catastrophe risk – something the
primary [property and casualty] insurers are very careful to inform
investors that they offload to reinsurers. Yet, it appears they are willing to
take it on the credit side, without any reinsurance protection.
 We note that large hurricanes, earthquakes and cataclysmic credit events
have a key similarity – they are all low probability events that investors
tend not to focus on much. A key difference, though, is that hurricanes and
earthquakes generally are limited to a certain geographic area and
therefore geographic diversification of risk can avert loss aggregation. In
other words, these events tend to be independent of each other – an
earthquake in California doesn’t necessarily cause an earthquake in New
York.
 Credit problems, however, don’t necessarily discriminate among
industries or underlying credit quality and can have a chain reaction.
Global credit markets are fundamentally


50  “Credit Default Swaps versus Financial Guaranties – Are the Risks the Same?”
Moody’s Investor Service, June 2001, p. 5.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 37


linked. Problems in the energy market and concern they may spread to
other industries through counterparty and vendor exposure are an example.
 We have also seen Enron and WorldCom, two companies in distinct
industries, file for bankruptcy. Both were investment grade credits at one
point and both were included in many collateralized debt obligations….
However, each new large credit that crumbles puts additional pressure on
those parties holding these “diversified” bonds. In other words, in a
widespread credit event, diversification doesn’t matter as much.51


Ms. Schroeder also questions the risk-reward of super-senior CDOs, comparing their risk
of loss to earthquake risk:


 Our major question is whether what amounts to “earthquake risk” in the
credit markets is really worth taking.
 As such we wonder if the relatively small profits to be made are worth the
“tail risk” – that is, the large exposure to credit losses if the “unthinkable”
happened. We could argue that, playing mostly in the super-triple A
layers, the value of diversification is not as great as it appears.
Unanticipated correlations might tend to arise that might not be worth the
franchise bet being made. We view this business as similar to writing
property catastrophe reinsurance on credit exposures, in other words, but
at a lower rate on line. 52


Commonsense also suggests to us that MBIA’s pricing of the risk of super-senior
guarantees is inadequate. While the company’s exposure is realistically a substantial
portion of the notional amount of the guarantee, MBIA has only typically been paid 4 to
12 bps per annum for these guarantees. If the company's estimates of losses are slightly
wrong, its losses will be enormous. The potential revenue, however, is limited to the
annual guarantee fee of 4 to 12 bps per annum, and for more recent transactions as much
as 20 bps. We believe the expression “Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller” is
perhaps the most appropriate characterization of MBIA’s super-senior guarantee
business.
4. The Problem with Modeling Low Probability Events
MBIA builds its models to a 99.99% confidence level and implies that such a confidence
level is extraordinarily high. We quote from the 2001 Annual Report:


 In 1998, we started to look at our credits on a more broad ranging
portfolio basis. We assigned default probabilities, severity tests and
default volatilities to each credit. We looked at the correlations among all
of the sectors, and we ran all this data on a simulation model to see what
our distribution of losses would be all the way up to a 99.99% confidence
level, [2001 Annual Report, p.14 (Emphasis added)]


MBIA supports this view by explaining that coincidentally Moody’s was going through a
similar analysis at the same time and then further explains the importance of its financial
modeling to its business:
51  “Insurance & Risk Briefing,” Alice Schroeder, Morgan Stanley, August 8, 2002, p. 4.
52  “Insurance & Risk Briefing,” Alice Schroeder, Morgan Stanley, August 8, 2002, p. 4.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 38


As it turns out, Moody’s was going through a very similar exercise for the
industry and established a portfolio simulation model as a critical element
of its ratings approach to financial guarantors. Moody’s uses two different
confidence levels, 99.9% and 99.99% as part of its capital adequacy ratios.
The likelihood of default for 99.9% is one in one thousand while 99.99%
is one in ten thousand.
Fundamentally, MBIA uses its own portfolio model to assist in the
management of our business. It helps us gain perspective on total capital
needs and capital we use on a deal by deal basis. It helps us price each
transaction, and it assists us in our reinsurance strategy. We believe we
have the most sophisticated day-to-day risk management capabilities in
the industry. [2001 Annual Report, pp. 14-15]


While the Moody’s model may be appropriate for evaluating mean outcomes, Moody’s
itself questions the validity of relying on its models for pricing low probability events. In
a study produced by Moody’s on the use of models in rating securitizations, it expressed
concern about the ability of models to quantify outlier events:


 [W]hereas statistical models are quite good at estimating the mean, or the
“expected” case of loss, it is much more difficult to quantify the tail of the
probability distribution – that is, to assign probabilities to the extreme
cases of loss scenarios that are several standard deviations away from the
mean. It appears that the probability of these extreme cases is much more
sensitive to economic changes, the originator’s credit “culture,” the
servicing quality and other factors that are difficult – or virtually
impossible – to quantify. The distribution tail will also be much more
sensitive to data problems and the other quantitative hurdles that are
discussed in this report.53


In particular, Moody’s expressed concern about the use of its models in determining
expected losses in higher-rated classes of a securitization. Moody’s concern is
particularly applicable to estimating the default probability of super-senior tranches of
synthetic CDOs that are deemed to be even better than AAA credits by MBIA and other
market participants:


 Naturally, the tail of the loss distribution is nearly all that matters when it
comes to assigning credit enhancement levels to the highly rated classes,
because a high rating means that the security can sustain a greater level of
stress without suffering losses, and is accordingly associated with the
extreme cases. Therefore, it may well be the case that a model is
sufficiently accurate with respect to the credit enhancement of the
speculative grade classes, which are closer to the mean; but is erroneous
with respect to the enhancement of the investment-grade classes due to
inaccuracies in the pool data, unreported credit changes, origination
strategy changes, and other non-quantified factors.54 [Emphasis added.]


In addition, Moody’s explains the risks of relying on four standard deviations in a
prescient report issued only 60 days prior to September 11, 2001 in which Moody’s
acknowledges the limitations of its historically based rating models:
53  “The Combined Use of Qualitative Analysis and Statistical Models in the Rating of
Securitisations,” Moody’s Investor Service, July 11, 2001, p. 3.
54  “The Combined Use of Qualitative Analysis and Statistical Models in the Rating of
Securitisations,” Moody’s Investor Service, July 11, 2001, p. 3.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 39


Credit analysts use past data – the only available information for these
models. This directly exposes the model’s inherent limitation; past data is
insufficient because they compose a sequence rather than a set of
independent observations as demanded by the laws of probability.55
 It is only natural to expect a familiar sequence of historic events to repeat
or maintain itself in the future. However, unimaginable “wild” events are
bound to happen at some point - the only question is when. There are a
number of historic examples of such unexpected events. One of these was
the moment in the late 1950s, when bonds first started yielding more than
stocks, thereby blowing apart a relationship established during more than
80 years of history. Another, more chilling example is the US. Stock
market crash in 1987 (see sidebar). A more relevant example in the
context of securitization is the unprecedented wave of mortgage
prepayments in the U. S. at the end of 1997 and the beginning of 1998,56
which was fueled by both a low interest rate environment and fierce
competition among mortgage lenders.57
 Sidebar: Reminder: The New York Stock Market Crash of 1987
 ….The magnitude of the crash took nearly all investors by surprise…
Some market observers calculated that the 19 October crash was a 27
standard deviation event, which should occur with the probability of 10 to
the 160th power – a virtual impossibility.


Each of the last three years has reflected record levels of corporate defaults “unmatched
in number and dollar volume since the Great Depression….”58 Through the third quarter
of 2002, $135.9 billion of debt from 195 corporate issuers defaulted compared with
$117.4 billion from 220 issuers in full year 2001. By year-end 2002, total defaulted
corporate debt is projected to reach $160 billion across 242 issuers.

In addition, we have recently witnessed an unprecedented number of events that are not
contemplated by a model that limits its predictive capability to include only those events
that can be explained with 99.99% probability. These events include the collapse of the
technology and telecommunication bubbles, the September 11th terrorist attacks and their
repercussions, a rogue Big Five auditor and pervasive aggressive accounting among even
what were previously perceived as the highest quality companies, record low interest
rates and record high mortgage prepayment levels.
It is too early to tell what the ultimate effects of recent events might be on the monoline
insurers because it takes time for the impact of these greater-than-four-standard-deviation
events to generate guarantee payments due to overcollateralization, debt service reserves
and other mechanisms that postpone loss recognition.
Any one of these events is sufficient to call into question a model that posits a world
where only four standard deviations explain everything. The models also do not appear to
assess adequately correlation risks among corporate credits that can be caused by reduced
investor appetite for risks. A recent IMF working paper on investor contagion assesses
the recent stock market bubble:


 Throughout most of 1999 investors appeared to have a high appetite for
risk and were willing to buy equity stakes in small technology companies
which had no track record, current revenues or any near-term expectations
of breaking even. These companies were


Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 41
able to raise new capital readily and invest, which further raised hopes of
future revenues and attracted yet more investors. When investors’ appetite
began to wane in late 1999 and turned sharply lower in the first quarter of
2000, the very same companies could not raise any new capital; and as
they did not have sufficient revenues even to cover their operating costs,
creditors began to pull the plug, leading to a collapse in equity prices and
widespread bankruptcies.59


The recent stock market bubble and its collapse are a good reminder that the
“unthinkable” and the “unpredictable” occur more often than expected.
E. MBIA’s Sale of Credit-Default Swaps on Itself
Gotham has been able to purchase substantial amounts of credit-default swaps on MBIA.
While we were initially surprised by the large available supply of CDS for an investment
that offers the writer of the insurance a very modest premium and, we believe, enormous
downside, we believe that MBIA may have been on the other side of a number of our
trades. We believe that MBIA has either sold protection to dealers through the purchase
of credit-linked notes for its insurance investment portfolio, or alternatively through the
sale of fully collateralized credit-default swaps. A recent Barclays Capital research report
confirms MBIA’s sale of default protection:


 Notably, MBIA has recently sold credit default protection on itself. We
believe this is an indication that the company views current spread levels
as overdone.60


MBIA’s addition of supply of CDS in its own name has created the opportunity for
dealers to sell protection on MBIA to Gotham and others at more favorable prices.
As to the motivation of an issuer like MBIA selling credit-default protection itself, we
quote MBIA’s CEO Jay Brown at a BankAmerica conference in California on September
25, 2002. In response to a question concerning credit-default swaps on MBIA, Mr.
Brown said:


 It is one of those markets when you go in and say I will buy some of that
– sell the protection against your own name or against one of your
competitors names. It shrinks in quickly if you try and create any volume.
So we are never quite sure in that market. It’s not a lot of serious contracts
being traded. [Emphasis added.]


This summer, when spreads had widened to more than 200 bps per annum, a large seller
stepped in to the market and caused spreads to decline to approximately 100 bps. Spreads
have subsequently returned to higher levels.
59  “Pure Contagion and Investors’ Shifting Risk Appetite: Analytical Issues and
Empirical Evidence,” IMF Working Paper, September 2001, p.8.
60  “MBIA Insurance Corporation – An ‘AAA-to-Z’ Overview of the World’s Largest
Bond Insurer,” Barclays Capital, Seth Glass, December 2, 2002, p. 17.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 42
The CDS market is considered to be more liquid than the cash market for corporate
bonds.61 As with any market, however, if a large seller steps in and sells indiscriminately,
the market will move in substantially.
We are not aware of any contemporaneous disclosure over the summer that MBIA was a
seller of CDS on itself, nor are we aware of any subsequent disclosure by MBIA that it
has been a seller of CDS on itself. The only public disclosure, of which we are aware,
that MBIA was a seller of CDS on itself is the Barclays Capital report of December 2,
2002.
Combining the fact that MBIA has not publicly disclosed its participation in CDS on
itself and Mr. Brown’s explanation that doing so makes the market “shrink[] in quickly,”
it appears that MBIA has quietly sought to narrow its spreads in the marketplace by
selling protection on itself.
We believe MBIA’s sale of credit-default protection on itself is not a good use of its
insurance capital. In effect, by purchasing MBIA CLNs, the company is leveraging itself
up in an undisclosed fashion. Because MBIA is AAA rated, if the company has
purchased credit-linked notes for its investment portfolio, it would improve the
portfolio’s weighted-average rating, while simultaneously weakening the company’s
liquidity to the extent of the new investment.

VI. ACCOUNTING FOR LOSSES
A. MBIA’s Reported Track Record Does Not Include “Restructurings”
MBIA emphasizes in its public filings and presentations that it has incurred only 3 bps
losses in its 28 years of existence over a total guarantee portfolio of $1.47 trillion. One
problem with the company’s statement, however, is that its new business, which is
growing at a rapid rate, has a materially different risk profile than its historical municipal
bond insurance business.
Another problem with MBIA's low reported loss statistics is that the company has not
disclosed publicly approximately 130 to 195 "restructurings" of troubled transactions
over the last 13 years. We determined this number from Mr. Brown’s estimate at our
meeting with him that the company had “restructured 10 to 15 credits per year” since he
joined the board of directors in 1990. In its public statements, management often refers to
how much money has been “saved” by its “surveillance” activities, but we believe that it
is more likely these savings simply represent deferred losses. Below, we quote Mr.
Brown on the company’s surveillance activities:


 We do get some transactions wrong. We actively monitor and
aggressively alter outcomes by working with issuers long before there is
ever a loss in our portfolio. In our history as a company we have
probably saved the company anywhere from $700 to $1 billion in
ultimate losses by changing or restructuring transactions.62


In our meeting with Mr. Brown, he explained that in a restructuring, the company
modifies the terms of existing indebtedness, often refinances obligations on new terms,
with new amortization schedules, etc. so that a transaction can be brought back into
compliance. Other financial institutions call these transactions workouts and are required
to disclose their details and set aside appropriate reserves in regulatory and SEC filings.
This is due to the fact that restructured loans with modified terms generally have higher
future default risk than loans that do not require restructuring. MBIA provides no
disclosure in its public filings as to what percentage or dollar amount of its guaranteed
portfolio has been restructured.
According to Mr. Budnick, when MBIA restructures a problem deal, it typically
refinances a near-defaulting obligation with a larger guarantee amount. When we asked
Mr. Budnick what the company means by “surveillance” he responded as follows:


 Restructuring deals. Throwing in dollars to make it work.63


When MBIA refunds an existing deal, according to its accounting policies, it books
immediately any unearned premium from that transaction.64 Since restructurings could

advance through a refunding accomplished by placing U.S. Government securities in
escrow, the remaining deferred

be characterized as refundings, we believe this policy may also apply to restructurings,
although there may be instances in which MBIA credits a portion of the refunded
premium to the new guarantee. In addition, we believe the company often takes waiver,
advisory and other fees that are booked immediately into income in connection with these
restructurings. According to Mr. Brown, the company takes no case reserves, nor books
any losses for restructured or refinanced guarantees nor includes restructured deals in its
reported cases of poorly performing transactions.65 It appears that MBIA’s accounting for
restructurings may serve to accelerate earnings recognition when compared to its
performing guarantee transactions.
 premium revenue is earned at that time, since there is no longer risk to the Company,”
2001 Annual Report, p. 28.
While restructuring can be effective for an issuer that has a short-term fixable problem,
restructuring credits with more fundamental or structural problems is likely to serve only
to postpone loss recognition. Traditional corporate restructurings typically involve
deleveraging a troubled company whereby existing debt is exchanged for new equity in
the company, and previous equity investors are largely if not totally diluted. In other
circumstances, new equity is invested which enables the restructured company to support
new indebtedness.
In the restructuring examples cited by the company in our meetings with Mr. Brown and
Mr. Budnick, no new equity was invested in transactions. Rather, MBIA through the
guarantee of a larger bond issue provided incremental debt capital to the restructured
credit. In that MBIA apparently does not take equity in transactions in exchange for debt,
it is not positioned to benefit materially if a troubled credit improves substantially;
however, because it is guaranteeing a larger debt, it increases its exposure to the troubled
credit.
In addition to the company’s restructurings, Mr. Budnick explained that MBIA uses “its
influence” to force issuers to take back bad loans and receivables from poorly performing
securitization transactions, i.e., MBIA threatens to not guarantee future securitizations if
the issuer does not take back problem assets. While such a strategy can work in
transactions with modest levels of losses and financially strong issuers, in circumstances
with high levels of defaults, or in the event of a weak or bankrupt issuer, this approach
will likely fail. While MBIA’s use of “influence” makes its reported performance appear
superior, its actual historical loss performance is probably overstated as a result.
B. MBIA Discloses Only the Number of Its Problem Credits Not the Dollar Amount
The number of MBIA’s problem guarantees is increasing at a rapid rate. The company
does not disclose the dollar amount of its guaranteed assets in default; instead MBIA
periodically discloses only the number of problem issues. The number of problem issues
increased by 92%, from 25 to 48 (as of 12/31/01) over the last three years and has
65  Interview with Mr. Jay Brown, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 45
continued to grow at a 27% annual rate to 54 issues for the six months ended June 30,
2002.
If a bank were to disclose only the number of its problem loans without disclosing their
dollar amount and without providing further detail, investors would have reason to
complain and, we believe, the SEC would not permit such a minimal degree of
disclosure. MBIA, however, provides only the number of its problem credits with no
further detail. The company’s lack of disclosure is particularly troubling in light of the
enormous range in size of the guarantees it provides, i.e., from as small as several million
dollars to as large as multi-billion dollar loans.
C. Reserves
From its inception until 1999, MBIA had reserved two basis points of the par value of its
outstanding guarantees for unidentified potential losses in its portfolio. In 1999, after the
bankruptcy of AHERF (Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation) and
losses of nearly $320 million, 66 MBIA retroactively increased its reserves from two basis
points to four basis points of its guarantee portfolio and made a one-time addition of $153
million to “bolster reserves.”67 Beginning in January 2002, MBIA has again changed its
reserve methodology, this time to 12% of earned premium. The company explains:


 Beginning in 2002, the Company has decided to change the methodology
it uses to determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expenses based
upon a percentage of earned premiums instead of a percentage of net debt
service written. There are two reasons for this change in methodology.
First, the amount of net debt service written can significantly fluctuate
from quarter to quarter while the related premium is earned more
consistently over the life of the transaction. Second, during the quarter the
premiums are written, the loss and loss adjustment charge is recognized in
advance of the related earned premium because this revenue is essentially
all deferred in the quarter that it is written. The intent of the change is to
better match the recognition of incurred losses with the related revenue,
(2001 Annual Report, p. 29).
To summarize, the company states that its second adjustment in reserving in three years
is due to its desire to smooth its recognition of expenses for GAAP. We interpret this
change somewhat differently despite the company’s explanation that if it had used its
new reserving methodology in the previous three years, its reserves would have been
largely the same. MBIA’s business mix has changed substantially over the last several
years. As a result of the growth in the company’s credit-default swap and CDO portfolios
coupled with the new accounting change, it appears that future reserves will be lower as a
result of the smaller premiums as a percentage of par insured for CDO transactions.
We question the logic of fixing loss and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of
earned premium, for this methodology guarantees the company a 12% loss ratio, or in
66  Interview with Mr. Budnick, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
67  MBIA 1999 Annual Report, p. 4
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 46
other words, an 88% gross margin on its insurance business regardless of the
competitiveness of the market.68 While there should be some correlation between risk of
loss and premium earned, there have been many periods in history when insurance
companies have underpriced risk. By guaranteeing the company a 12% loss ratio,
MBIA’s new reserving methodology allows the company to report smooth earnings and
large profits regardless of the competitiveness of the markets for its guarantee.
MBIA states that its reserving methodology is based on rating agency studies of default
statistics over the last 30 years for rated corporate issuers. Unfortunately, however, there
are no long-term data on structured finance or on CDO performance because of the
products’ recent invention. As a result, we believe that MBIA has extrapolated from data
that is not sufficient to determine appropriate levels of reserves. The historical data do not
contemplate the adversely selected nature of CDO, credit-default swaps, and some of the
more complex securitizations, and perhaps more importantly, recent events.
Recent events, in particular, the recession, accounting problems and record numbers of
investment-grade and high-yield defaults, make MBIA’s reserve assumptions even more
unrealistic. While MBIA explains that diversification has reduced the company’s risk, it
appears that nearly all of its asset classes have been impaired by events of recent years
including the company’s municipal guarantees and other public finance credits. CDOs,
credit-default swaps, and nearly all asset-backed securitizations are suffering losses well
in excess of expectations. The large number of investment-grade and non-investment
grade defaults have burned up a substantial portion of the overcollateralization in many
CDOs.
D. Credit Concerns in MBIA’s Guarantee Portfolio
MBIA has in recent years begun to show problems in its guarantee portfolio. As
mentioned previously, in 1999, one of the company’s larger hospital credits (Allegheny
Health Education and Research Foundation) filed for bankruptcy leaving it with losses
totaling approximately $320 million. MBIA was able to eliminate the earnings impact of
this loss by obtaining $170 million of “reinsurance” which it used to offset the after-tax
loss at a minimal undisclosed cost, in exchange for an agreement to cede future business
to these reinsurers. We quote below from the company’s contemporaneous press release:


 ARMONK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 29, 1998--MBIA Inc.
(NYSE: MBI) announced today that it has obtained $170 million of
reinsurance that it expects will cover anticipated losses arising from the
bankruptcy of the Delaware Valley Obligated Group (DVOG) [a/k/a
AHERF]. As a result, the company does not expect exposure to this
insured credit to affect its earnings or reduce its unallocated loss reserve…
 "As part of our risk management efforts, the company has entered into
strategic business relationships with highly rated reinsurers to provide
them with future business as part of the reinsurance agreement. The cost
of these reinsurance arrangements over the next few


68  While one of the other monoline insurers, XL Capital Assurance, uses a similar
approach, it has chosen to set aside 25% rather than 12% of earned premium for its
unallocated reserve.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 47


years will have a minimal impact on earnings while strengthening our
claims-paying resources and risk management capabilities," said Richard
L. Weill, MBIA vice chairman.


Mr. Budnick described this transaction to us as the company “borrowing” money from
the reinsurers and “paying it back” through a commitment to cede future businesses. As a
result of the reinsurance, the company was able to avoid booking a loss on the AHERF
transaction while simultaneously maintaining its unallocated loss reserve. Standard &
Poor’s has recently described MBIA’s retroactive financial reinsurance of AHERF as
“innovative.” 69 We do not know of other instances in which the company may have used
financial reinsurance to mitigate other losses in its portfolio, but believe that this
mechanism is not in fact reinsurance, but rather a loss-deferral, earnings-smoothing
device.
MBIA’s healthcare assets (MBIA had $36.5 billion net par of hospital exposure at
September 30, 2002) continue to be at substantial risk because of managed care and
reduced Medicare reimbursements as well as the recent problems caused by National
Century’s bankruptcy. According to Mr. Brown, other than AA rated hospitals, nearly
every hospital deal that MBIA has done in recent years has been a restructuring of a
previous deal.70
The company has substantial sub-prime home equity and mortgage exposure, which has
also been under significant stress. At September 30, 2002, MBIA had total home equity
net par of $21.1 billion. In addition, the company apparently has significant manufactured
home exposure, although the company does not break this exposure out separately.
MBIA has substantial secured and unsecured exposure to investor owned utilities. In
2001, Pacific Gas & Electric filed for Chapter 11 and Southern California Edison
suffered a material downgrade. MBIA has approximately $1 billion of exposure to PG&E
and Southern California Edison of which 41% is unsecured. $51 million of the
company’s unsecured exposure to PG&E is in the form of a credit-default swap.71 At
September 30, 2002, MBIA had $17.4 billion of additional net par exposure to investor-
owned utilities.
On July 15th of this year, Royal Indemnity, a British Insurer, refused to honor its
guarantee of $380 million of vocational student loans, citing fraud and negligent
misrepresentations by the issuer, Student Finance Corp. MBIA guaranteed eight Royal
Indemnity wrapped SFC securitizations. MBIA is suing Royal Indemnity for payment,
but has stepped in to make good on the underlying bonds that have already generated
$311 million of claims according to MBIA’s September 30, 2002 10-Q. In light of
69  “The 17.9% spike [in reinsurance] in 1998 was an aberration caused by MBIA
Insurance Corp.’s innovative use of reinsurance in connection with its exposure and
losses to the bankrupt Allegheny Health and Educational Research Foundation
(AHERF)” [Emphasis added.] “Extraordinary Events Test Bond Insurer’s Resilience,”
Standard & Poor’s, May 15, 2002, p. 58.
70  Interview with Mr. Jay Brown, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
71  Source: “MBIA: Mixed Bag of News,” Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Research, Vinay
Saqi, p. 3.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 48
Royal Indemnity’s financial condition, there remains uncertainty about MBIA’s ability to
collect even if it is successful in the litigation.
As previously mentioned, on October 31, 2002, Union Acceptance Corp. filed for
bankruptcy protection. UAC securitizes sub-prime loans on used cars. MBIA is a
guarantor of $2.4 billion of UAC’s securitizations and other debt including the guarantee
of a $350 million BankAmerica loan to the company. MBIA has substantial exposure to
other sub-prime auto lenders including AmeriCredit ($1.75 billion warehouse facility and
a recent $1.7 billion securitization), Onyx Acceptance Corp. ($355 million warehouse
facility and $1.9 billion net par of term securitizations), and Capital One. At September
30, 2002, MBIA’s total auto exposure was $13.6 billion of net par.
MBIA is a large guarantor of Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) which are
financings secured by aircraft ($4 billion of gross exposure and $1.9 billion of net). The
company’s largest exposure is to U.S. Airways ($1.6 billion gross, $514 million net). The
bankruptcy of U.S. Airways and the growing probability of other airline bankruptcies
including United Airlines threatens the creditworthiness of these issues. While
bankruptcy of the issuer is certainly not a positive for EETC transactions, it is not the
most important factor in the credit quality of the issue. Underlying asset values of the
aircraft are also paramount. A continued decline in air travel due to growing terrorist
activities, the recession, and the potential upcoming war with Iraq will likely increase the
probability of loss to MBIA on these transactions.

In addition to EETCs, MBIA has other travel-correlated exposures under significant
stress including airport revenue bonds, passenger facility charges, car rental
securitizations, and toll roads that lead to airports. Excluding toll roads, these exposures
totaled $15 billion at December 31, 2001.
MBIA has substantial exposure to sub-prime credit lenders including Providian, Metris,
and Spiegel. These transactions also do not appear to be performing according to original
projections. We quote below from a recent Bank of America research report:
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 50


We remain concerned about the subprime credit card segment. In our
minds, this segment remains untested, and the experience at Providian
highlights the risk there.72


With $2.8 billion of net par exposure, Providian Gateway Master Trust is MBIA’s largest
structured finance risk. In an 8-K filed on November 18, 2002, Providian Financial Corp.
reported that the Trust’s Annualized Net Credit Loss Rate was 17.5%, which represents
gross charge offs less recoveries on previously charged off loans. The 8-K noted that the
Net Credit Loss Rate would have been 19% if certain extraordinary adjustments were
excluded from the calculation.
With $2.5 billion of net par exposure, Metris Master Trust is MBIA’s second largest
structured finance risk. On October 28, 2002, Fitch downgraded all of the Metris Master
Trust A/B/C notes other the trust series that are wrapped by MBIA. We quote from a
Fitch press release below:


 The rating actions primarily reflect persistent weakness and expected
further deterioration of key master trust performance variables as well as
the challenging financial and regulatory environment in which Metris
continues to operate. Trust credit quality has worsened significantly
beyond Fitch's original expectations and continues to deteriorate. In
September, gross charge offs reached 16.83%, compared to an average of
12.8% in 2001 and 11.18% in 2000. In addition, late stage delinquencies,
an indicator of future charge offs, continue to trend upward, reaching
11.1% in the latest period.
 When modeling its new performance expectations, Fitch employed
several stress scenarios, giving increased consideration to the scenario that
incorporated a full purchase rate stress in conjunction with the stresses
applied to other key variables. The decision to emphasize the full purchase
rate stress scenario reflects Fitch's concern that Metris would be unable
to fund new purchases on trust designated accounts in the event of
insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership. [Emphasis added.]


Spiegel issued two series of asset backed securities from its retail credit card master trust
in 2000 and 2001. Both of these series were guaranteed by MBIA. MBIA had $840
million of net par exposure to Spiegel Credit Card Master Note Trust (MBIA’s 33rd
largest structured finance risk) at September 30, 2002.
On April 10, 2002, MBIA declared a “pay out event” for the two series due to higher than
anticipated fraud and credit losses, which averaged 17.3% over the trailing six months
and 19% in April. The day after MBIA declared the pay out event, Spiegel’s special
purpose bank sued MBIA in New York State Court and obtained a temporary restraining
order to prevent MBIA from enforcing the pay out event. Spiegel argued that no pay out
event actually had occurred.
MBIA ended up settling this dispute out of court, waiving the early amortization
covenant that is designed to protect MBIA against losses. The company has not been
willing to publicly disclose the details of its settlement with Spiegel.

VII. MBIA’S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
At September 30, 2002, MBIA’s insurance investment portfolio was comprised of $8.2
billion of fixed income assets at amortized cost. Fifty-six percent (56%) of these assets
are municipal bonds of which, according to MBIA, nearly 90% of the muni portfolio is
wrapped by monoline insurers including MBIA. According to Mr. Budnick, MBIA’s
guarantee supports as much as 50% of the wrapped portfolio,73 which implies that as
much as 25% of the company’s investment portfolio is rated AAA only because of
MBIA’s own guarantee. In addition, the company owns other assets in the taxable portion
of its investment portfolio that are guaranteed by MBIA and other monoline insurers
including $30 million of Meridian Funding Company, LLC MTNs and MBIA credit-
linked notes (CLNs) or fully collateralized credit-default swaps. We have not been able to
determine the precise amount of these other guaranteed assets.
While MBIA states that the investment portfolio’s rating averages AA, we believe that
this average rating is enhanced by the large percentage of securities which are rated AAA
because they are guaranteed by MBIA and other monoline insurers. The company’s
investment yield is also enhanced because wrapped AAA obligations tend to trade at
wider spreads than “natural” AAA rated securities.
As a result of the large amount of wrapped AAA obligations, the balance of MBIA’s
portfolio can be comprised of greater amounts of A and lower-rated corporate credits
while allowing the company to maintain an average AA rating. We do not believe that
MBIA should be relying on its own guarantee, nor that of its competitors in reporting the
credit quality of its investment portfolio.
MBIA’s concentration of credit risk in wrapped munis and taxable securities and, in
particular, its large ownership of MBIA-wrapped paper makes the company even more
vulnerable to a decline in its own credit quality and that of other monoline insurers. This
is due to the fact that the event that will require MBIA to seek liquidity from its
investment portfolio, i.e., a substantial number of defaults requiring guarantee payments,
will occur at precisely the time that a substantial portion of MBIA’s wrapped portfolio
will decline in value and become less marketable. This is also true for the company’s
other monoline-wrapped obligations because of the likely high degree of correlation
between the decline in the credit quality of one monoline and its competitors.
We have previously discussed some of the issues associated with consolidating the $8.6
billion of SPV debt on MBIA Insurance Corp.’s balance sheet. In the event of the
consolidation, MBIA would also be required to include $8.6 billion at cost of investments
whose collective ratings are substantially below AA, which would reduce the portfolio’s
average investment rating and the average liquidity substantially. While we do not know
the current average rating of the SPV assets, we are troubled by the quality of the assets
that we have been able to identify.

Insurance Corporation – An ‘AAA-to-Z’ Overview of the World’s Largest Bond
Insurer,” Barclays Capital, Seth Glass, Dec. 2, 2002, p. 13.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 52
Considering the high degree of monoline-wrapped securities and the soon-to-be
consolidated SPV investment assets, we believe that MBIA’s reported AA rating
significantly overstates the company’s true investment portfolio quality.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 53
VIII. REINSURANCE
MBIA reinsured $106 billion of its $589 billion of gross par at September 30, 2002. The
business was divided as follows:


 Reinsurer Billions S&P Rating Moody’s Rating
 Ace Guaranty $20.0 AAA Aa2
 Radian Re $18.9 AA Aa2
 Axa Re $14.7 AAA Aa1
 Munich Re $12.6 AAA Aa1
 Ambac $10.5 AAA Aaa
 Zurich Re $ 8.4 A+ A1
 American Re $ 8.4 AAA Aa2
 Other $ 5.3 Undisclosed Undisclosed
 Ram Re $ 4.2 AAA Aa3
 Mitsui Sumitomo Re $ 2.1 AA AA2


The credit quality of MBIA’s reinsurers is critical to the company’s long-term capital
requirements. This is due to the fact that the rating agencies “haircut” reinsurance
provided by non-AAA reinsurers. S&P discounts reinsurance from AA reinsurers by
30%, A reinsurers by 70%, and for reinsurers below A considers the entire risk to still
remain on the books of the ceding primary insurer.
In a March 13, 2002 research report, S&P changed the outlooks on the then AAA ratings
of the four monoline reinsurers, Radian, Ace, Axa, and Ram to negative from stable
citing the:


 deterioration in the reinsurers’ business positions vis-à-vis the primary
insurers. This change has resulted in the reinsurers assuming business that
is less diversified, less profitable, and of a higher risk profile relative to
that written by the primary insurers.74


On July 29, 2002, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook on the monoline reinsurers
which:


 Reflects less favorable relationships and contractual terms with the
companies’ major clients, as well as increased competition.


On September 17, 2002, S&P put Axa Re on creditwatch with negative implications
implying that if the business was not sold (sale discussions were apparently in advanced
stages), its credit would be downgraded.
On September 19, 2002, Moody’s downgraded Munich Re to Aa1 from AAA, and
American Re to Aa2.
74 “Extraordinary Events Test Bond Insurers’ Resilience,” Bond Insurance Book 2002, p.
102.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 54
On October 4, 2002, S&P downgraded MBIA’s second largest reinsurer, Radian Re, to
AA which brings $5.7 billion of risk that was previously reinsured back onto MBIA’s
books based on S&P’s 30% haircut methodology.
On October 8, 2002, S&P reaffirmed Ace Guaranty’s AAA rating but with a negative
outlook.
Moody’s has also become “increasingly cautious” about the monoline reinsurers.
Moody’s stated on October 9, 2002 that its cautious outlook:


 reflects increased uncertainty over the amount of benefits that primary
insurers will recognize from ceding financial guaranty exposure to
monoline reinsurers, as well as the changing strategic profile of certain
reinsurers.75


Fifty-five percent of MBIA’s reinsurance comes from monoline reinsurers. All of these
reinsurers are under pressure for a ratings downgrade. As monoline reinsurers, effectively
all of their business is directly correlated with the primary monoline insurers from whom
they accept risk. According to S&P, this business is not only correlated but represents an
adversely selected pool of risk from the monolines.
An additional 10% of MBIA’s reinsurance comes from Ambac whose book of business is
extremely similar to MBIA’s. This is particularly true for the company’s international
structured finance business, which was a joint venture with Ambac until March 2000.
Ambac also purchases reinsurance from MBIA. In today’s accounting parlance, one
might refer to the reciprocal quality of MBIA’s and Ambac’s reinsurance as “roundtrip
reinsurance.”
As a result of the above exposures, 65% of MBIA’s reinsurance comes from reinsurers
whose business is directly correlated with the company’s. The risks of such an approach
become evident by example. Consider a property casualty company that writes P&C
coverage for Florida property that purchases 65% of its reinsurance from reinsurers that
only reinsure Florida coastal housing. The catastrophic event or series of events that
make the insurer call upon its reinsurance is likely to be the event in which the reinsurers
are least able to perform as a result of their concentrated exposure to the same risk.
The above correlations are compounded further by the fact that the monoline reinsurers
stock their investment portfolios with obligations that are rated AAA only because they
are wrapped by the primary monolines. For example, more than 60% of Ace Guaranty
Re’s portfolio is invested in wrapped municipal paper. 76
While Moody’s in a recent report discounted the impact of a one or even two notch
downgrade of the reinsurers, i.e., from A1 to A2 (one notch) or to A3 (2 notches), it did,
75  “Moody’s Cautious on Bond Insurers; S&P Downgrades a Radian Unit,” The Bond
Buyer, Vol. 27; No. 7; p. 6.
76  Interview with Mr. Budnick, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 55
however, express concern about the risk if even one of the primary monoline reinsurers
encounters credit quality deterioration:


 While none of the primary guarantors, including MBIA, would suffer a
credit event if one or more of their reinsurance providers were
downgraded a notch or two, all of the financial guarantors may be
vulnerable if one of their primary providers of reinsurance were to
experience a significant credit quality deterioration or were to choose to
exit this market.77


MBIA’s reinsurance program is another form of off-balance sheet leverage that can
functionally accelerate. In the event of a downgrade of a reinsurer, MBIA is considered
by the rating agencies to have received the ceded risks back on its books. In effect, the
company is confronted with a capital call when its reinsurers are downgraded. Since
MBIA reinsures its higher-risk, lower-quality business, in the event of a reinsurer
downgrade, MBIA’s potential exposure to its worst quality business will increase.
Because of the high degree of correlation of the reinsurers with MBIA itself, the
company is least likely to be prepared to insure the ceded risks at the time they are “put”
to the company.

IX. OTHER ACCOUNTING ISSUES
We believe that conservative accounting is essential for investors to understand the true
earnings power of MBIA. The company’s revenue and expense recognition policies,
however, coupled with the company’s accounting for reserves suggest to us that MBIA’s
accounting is not conservative.
A. Advisory Fees
In recent years, MBIA has structured a substantial portion of its guarantee fees as
advisory and other fees that the company books immediately as income at the closing of a
transaction. For example, according to Mr. Budnick, on the recent Eurotunnel deal the
company booked upfront an $8 to $10 million advisory fee as part of its total fees on the
transaction.78
Over the past several years, advisory fees have grown to become a greater percentage of
the company’s earnings and are up 39% from the comparable period from last year.
Advisory fees for 2001 were also up 39% over 2000. The company also charges advisory
fees to its SPVs, $8 to $9 million in 2001 according to Mr. Brown, in amounts that it
appears to determine in its sole discretion. Mr. Brown described advisory fees as “found
money.” 79
We also find troubling the apparent re-characterization of SPV interest income as
advisory fees. In essence, via the SPVs, MBIA is paying advisory fees to itself in
amounts it appears to determine in its sole discretion. Proper characterization of this
income is important because Wall Street has historically assigned higher multiples to fee
income rather than interest income.
We question the appropriateness of charging advisory fees that are recognized upfront
rather than over the life of a transaction. Issuers who seek MBIA’s AAA guarantee likely
consider advisory fees as simply another form of financing costs. Since advisory fees and
guarantee fees are typically paid upfront in the public and project finance transactions in
which they are earned, the borrower is indifferent to how the fees are labeled by MBIA
because the borrower pays the fees upfront and only considers the all-in-cost rather than
the categories of fees in a financing.
Because of the accelerated recognition of advisory versus guarantee fees (advisory fees
are typically recognized at the time of the closing of the transaction), we believe the
company’s growth in advisory fees may be due to its simply shifting revenue from one
category to another where it can be recognized immediately.
78  Interestingly, while Mr. Budnick was aware of the amount of the advisory fee earned
on the Eurotunnel deal, Mr. David Dubin, co-head of MBIA’s European structured
finance, did not know the amount of the advisory fee and could only tell us the all-in cost
of the financing on a spread basis.
79  Interview with Mr. Jay Brown, Armonk, NY, August 14, 2002.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 57
B. Revenue Recognition
MBIA provided new disclosure in the 2001 Annual Report that explained the impact of
the company’s revenue recognition methods. MBIA recognizes deferred premium on a
principal balance of exposure basis, rather than equally over the life of an issue. Since the
dollar value of each deal is greater in earlier years due to amortization, this accounting
method greatly accelerates revenue recognition. The company explains the materiality of
this revenue recognition policy for the first time in the 2001 Annual Report:


 The effect of the Company’s policy is to recognize greater levels of
upfront premium in the earlier years of each policy insured, thus matching
revenue recognition with the underlying risk. Recognizing premium
revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of each policy would
materially affect the company’s financial results. [Emphasis added.]


While the company’s revenue recognition methodology may have logical appeal, because
loss development often does not occur in the early years of a guarantee, frontloading
revenue does not necessarily match revenue recognition with the company’s exposure to
risk.
C. Deferred Acquisition Costs
We believe the company’s accounting for deferred acquisition costs is aggressive. The
company capitalizes the variable costs associated with new business generation which are
then amortized over the life of the transaction. Mr. Budnick explained to us that these
costs include a portion of his and the controller's salary, as well as all other deal
participants and ancillary costs. According to Mr. Budnick, the deferred acquisition cost
policy results in the deferral of 55% of the company’s operating costs over the life of its
guarantee portfolio.80
While many insurance companies defer policy acquisition costs, we find MBIA’s
approach aggressive because we believe MBIA’s business is more analogous to a finance
company than a life or property casualty insurer. We do not believe that banks or finance
companies defer the salaries of underwriters and senior management over the life of a
transaction. In addition, because of the long-term nature of MBIA’s guarantees, the
company’s deferred acquisition cost policy significantly enhances the company’s
reported net income when its results are compared with other financial institutions.
In sum, we believe that the combination of accelerated revenue recognition of guarantee
and advisory fees, the company’s immaterial levels of reserves, and its deferral of a
substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses cause MBIA’s GAAP earnings
to overstate significantly the company’s true economic earnings.

X. CONCLUSION -- WHY WE BELIEVE THAT MBIA’S CREDIT RATING IS
AT RISK.
We do not believe that MBIA deserves to be AAA rated. In particular, we believe that the
dramatically increased liquidity, investment, underwriting, and correlation risks in
MBIA’s business and investment portfolio in recent years do not justify this rating. While
the company’s reporting of its overall credit quality appears to suggest that the guarantee
portfolio has improved in quality, we believe the facts suggest otherwise.
A. Credit Quality of Existing Portfolio
MBIA points to the fact that in 1998 70% of the company’s guarantee portfolio was A or
better versus 76% today.81 While MBIA is focused on what percentage of its business is
of high quality, the relevant measure, we believe, is what percentage is of lower quality.
With approximately $483 billion of net par insured at September 30, 2002, MBIA had
$251 billion of net par rated A or below and $299 billion of net par rated A+ or below.
A significant amount of the company’s growth in A or better ratings has come from its
super-senior CDO business which is considered AAA by the rating agencies. We have
previously explained why we believe the ratings for these transactions understate their
risks. Yet it is the super-senior CDOs’ high ratings that allow MBIA to report improved
average credit quality. In any event, we believe that investors and the rating agencies
should focus on the absolute dollar amount of MBIA’s low quality business to assess
trends in its risk profile.
If we look solely at assets rated BBB+ and below, MBIA had approximately $115 billion
of net par exposure. From this we know that MBIA has large exposures to marginally
investment-grade risks.
Furthermore, if we look at underlying assets rated Below Investment Grade (BIG) (i.e.,
assets rated BB+ to D), MBIA had $6.8 billion of net par at September 30, 2002 up from
$4.8 Billion as of June 30, 2002.82 This $2 billion increase represents 42% growth in BIG
assets in just one quarter. The $6.8 billion of BIG assets substantially exceeds MBIA’s
equity of $5.5 billion. The absolute size of these numbers and their enormous growth in
the last quarter should raise red flags for investors and rating agencies because BIG assets
are inconsistent with no loss underwriting.
We also believe that MBIA’s $5.3 to $7.7 billion mark-to-market loss on its CDO
portfolio, as estimated by CDO dealers, calls into question the company’s credit quality.
81  52% of MBIA’s book of business is actually A or below and 62% is A+ or below.

When we compare any of these numbers against MBIA’s $5.5 billion of equity capital or
against its $900 million to $1.7 billion cushion against a rating downgrade,83 one begins
to suspect that the risk of substantial loss and downgrade is much higher than the
company suggests or than is implied by its AAA rating.
B. MBIA’s Track Record
MBIA marshals its reported 28-year track record of 3 bps of losses on $1.470 trillion of
debt service from inception as an indication of its future probability of loss. We think the
quality of MBIA’s track record is overstated for several reasons.
• First, MBIA’s business has changed materially since inception, as competition and the
company’s desire to generate 15% compound earnings growth have forced it to guarantee
riskier assets over time.
• Second, while the risk of MBIA’s current business is greater than its historic business,
its historic business dilutes more recent loss experience by its inclusion in the
denominator of the company’s total book of business.
• Third, because the company’s guarantees are long-term and defaults do not typically
occur in the early years of a guarantee, the company’s high rate of growth masks reported
losses through the inclusion of an ever-larger number of new guarantees in the
denominator of the loss calculation.
• Fourth, the company’s data set of losses is obscured by its non-disclosure of
restructurings that likely have had the effect of postponing loss recognition.
• Fifth, the company’s willingness to take on greater risks since its charter change in 1991
corresponds with the longest economic expansion in American history. While catastrophe
insurers can look good when hurricanes are not in season, the true test to their
underwriting occurs during hurricane season.
For the above reasons, we believe that MBIA’s reported loss statistics are not good
predictors of future losses. Therefore, we believe they should not be relied upon by
investors and rating agencies in estimating the company’s probability of loss in the
future.
C. Investment Portfolio
We have previously described the company’s high degree of exposure to MBIA-
guaranteed and other monoline-wrapped securities in its investment portfolio. While

Neil Budnick, September 10, 2002 at which he cites S&P’s determination of MBIA’s
threshold over a AAA rating.
Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 60
MBIA’s portfolio averages AA, the large amount of wrapped AAA credit in the portfolio
serves to artificially boost the portfolio’s stated credit quality. This allows MBIA to
generate wider spreads for its AA portfolio in two ways: first, wrapped AAA paper
generally trades at wider spreads than “natural” AAA credits; and second, because of the
high proportion of AAA credits, the company is able to add larger amounts of higher
yielding A and BBB credits while still maintaining a AA average. Even more
significantly, the addition of the SPV assets to MBIA’s balance sheet will further reduce
the overall credit quality and liquidity of MBIA by the inclusion of lower quality, less
liquid assets that will more than double the size of the investment portfolio.
D. Liquidity Risks
We believe the company faces substantial liquidity risk from its nominally capitalized
SPVs which owe more than $8.6 billion of debt, of which $3 billion is commercial paper.
We also believe that investors and the rating agencies should be concerned about the
liquidity risk of the company’s $44 billion synthetic credit-default swap guarantees that
accelerate once overcollateralization levels have burned off.
As we have mentioned previously, in an August 2002 Moody’s report entitled “Ratings
Triggers in the Financial Guarantee Industry,” the rating agency appears to be unaware
that MBIA is exposed to accelerating risks and short-term debt:


 [T]he guarantors’ exposure to liquidity risk is relatively modest, given the
low historical frequency and severity or insured defaults, coupled with the
nature of its insurance contract, which protects against the acceleration of
principal payments. Furthermore, the guarantors do not issue short-term
debt, lessening the need for significant amounts of back-up liquidity.
E. Correlation of Risks Could Lead to Downgrade Spiral


Most disconcerting of all, the combination of these risks could lead to a ratings
downgrade, which, in turn, could lead to a self-reinforcing series of events. Moody’s
alludes to this in describing perhaps the largest ratings trigger exposure at MBIA, i.e., the
credit rating of the company itself:


 The primary guarantors, of course, are also exposed to another form of
rating trigger that is not embedded in any documentation, but is instead
imposed by the market itself – If a financial guarantor were to lose its Aaa
rating, it would likely be at a competitive disadvantage to other Aaa-rated
guarantors operating in the same markets. While this factor would not
directly impact the company’s current insured portfolio or claims-paying
ability, it could affect the firm’s business prospects going forward. As a
result, if a primary guarantor were to be downgraded, it may well be that
the additional negative impact on the firm’s future franchise value from
the downgrade itself could cause Moody’s to downgrade the company by
an extra rating notch. Having said this, the importance of the rating to a
guarantor’s business franchise provides a strong incentive for the company
to maintain a strong credit posture, which is one of the reasons we have
seen few downgrades in this sector. Therefore, although the Aaa ratings on
financial


Gotham Partners Management Co., LLC Page 61 Gotham Partners Management Co.,
LLC Page 62 guarantors are likely to be quite stable as a group, the guarantors may be
more vulnerable to a two-notch downgrade than some other companies. 84 A two-notch
downgrade could have catastrophic consequences for the company. It would likely create
problems for the renewal of MBIA’s SPV commercial paper. It might also cause a
reduction in the value of all of MBIA’s wrapped obligations including all of Triple-A
One’s assets. The decline in values of these assets, in turn, could trigger covenant
defaults in the SPV’s liquidity facilities,85 further exacerbating its immediate liquidity
crisis. Additionally, Moody’s reports that MBIA’s ISDA documentation contains
increasing collateral requirements in the event of a downgrade of the company. The
company’s municipal GIC portfolio also has rating downgrade triggers. 86 Perhaps most
significantly, a downgrade could shut off a material percentage of the company’s cash
flow, for MBIA may be unable to write new premium without a AAA rating.87 A
Barclays Capital research report which is available on MBIA’s website explains:
Spiraling down…down…and down? In the event of a financial guarantor being
downgraded, will a vicious circle lead to rapid rating deterioration and potential
bankruptcy? This is a much-debated question in that a financial guarantor who relies on
its credit ratings for its business franchise could face a rapid decline in new business in
the event of a downgrade, which could precipitate further downgrades.88 It appears to us
that an actual or perceived downgrade of MBIA would have draconian consequences to
the company and create substantial drains on the company’s liquidity. The self-
reinforcing and circular nature of the company’s exposures makes it, we believe, a poor
candidate for a AAA rating. In light of MBIA’s enormous leverage, the company’s credit
quality, underwriting, transparency, accounting, and track record must be beyond
reproach. The company can simply not afford any significant risk of loss in its nearly
$500 billion of net par exposure, for a mere 20 to 35 basis points loss would equate to
levels sufficient to cause a rating agency downgrade of the company.89 In addition, and as
importantly, the company must have minimal liquidity risk. Based on our research, we
conclude that MBIA fails to meet these standards. 84 “Downgrade Risk in the Financial
