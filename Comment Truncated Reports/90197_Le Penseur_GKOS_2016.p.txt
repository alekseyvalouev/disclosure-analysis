Upcoming insurance changes should weigh heavily on Glaukos's stock.


A product that will directly compete with Glaukos's iStent was just approved.


Insiders have been selling shares after a bullish conference call.


Health insurance coverage and policy is key to forecasting the earnings of almost all
developmental biotech and medical device companies. Those companies with a small
portfolio of approved products are especially susceptible to changes in insurance
coverage. Based on changes in coverage, a company's earnings could increase or
decrease very quickly.

Glaukos (NYSE:GKOS) is one such company that relies on insurance reimbursements
to make its business feasible. It markets a product called iStent, which is an implant that
helps manage intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients. iStent is a very small
micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) device that is inserted into the eye. The device
helps restore your eye's natural fluid outflow and reduce IOP.


With iStent, most patients are able to maintain normal eye pressure after surgery, and it
also has an excellent safety profile. This has led to the company having a successful
IPO and also earnings growth over the last year and a half. However, the problem with
this company doesn't lie with the product, but with how insurance companies are
changing coverage on it.


Currently, iStent is covered by Medicare and most other private insurance companies,
but actions by insurer Novitas and talk in the ophthalmology community are suggesting
that coverage is about to change in a way that makes using the iStent unprofitable.


Channel checks with several ophthalmologists suggest that Novitas will be changing its
physician reimbursement fee for iStent from over $1,000 to just $70. On August 15, a
Medicare liaison confirmed that the iStent reimbursement will be going down to $70 in
Pennsylvania.


According to the Novitas website, new procedure codes for this will be adjusted on
September 6, 2016. It is looking like the price change will start to spread across more
states on September 6 and Glaukos will have to disclose the change in coverage. I
believe that once this news becomes official, it will have a negative impact on the stock
and also cause other insurers to change their plans as well.


In past situations, once one insurer decides to do this, others also follow suit to match
pricing.


Several ophthalmologists have said that they will have to stop using iStent all together if
this pricing expands nationwide. If the other insurers decide to do this, the iStent
wouldn't make any business sense to use. They also expressed that these changes
would really damper sales in the entire MIGS marketplace.

In addition, the company has been marketing this product with no competition. Alcon's
CyPass stent was just approved and could provide additional headwinds for Glaukos. In
the most recent conference call, CEO Thomas Burns stated:


"As you may know, a suprachoroidal device in this market niche CyPass has just
received U.S. FDA approval. This approval comes earlier than originally expected,
but it is not altogether surprising considering the recent flurry of activity and approvals
in the ophthalmic space, and including a recent approval of presbyopic inlay for
[indiscernible] optics without a panel review, even though it was only the second
introductory product in a new market class."


The CyPass approval came earlier than Glaukos expected, and in a recent survey
conducted by Stifel, it found that 85% of doctors will also be trained to use CyPass. It
also expects that CyPass will take 35% market share.


In spite of all these headwinds, Glaukos's management increased 2016 revenue
guidance at the company's last conference call. However, it also reported expected
growth to slow from 59% in the first half of 2016 to 39% in the second half of 2016. If
these changes to the reimbursement fee spread, it is very likely that Glaukos will
meaningfully miss its next earnings estimates.

We can see that Glaukos has been steadily growing revenues over the last year and
half. The company made about $2.3M last quarter while increasing net margins. The
company does also have $94M in cash, so dilution is not a concern as of now. However,
if the company can't maintain this growth and profitability, dilution concern will be back
on the table.


The company's high valuation is also of concern. Investors have awarded the company
a premium valuation because it has had earnings growth quarter after quarter.


Since the company is barely profitable, it won't take much to disrupt the continued sales
growth.


Insiders and large shareholders of the company seem to know that growth is about to
slow, competition is increasing, and insurers are changing policies. As seen below,
insiders have sold 4,139,240 shares and bought only 476,041 shares over the last three
months.

Insiders Jonathan Silverstein, William Link, and Gilbert Kliman have been selling shares
in August, right after management raised guidance. OrbiMed Advisors has also decided
to sell a part of its stake in Glaukos. Below is OrbiMed's most recent sell:

It doesn't make much sense that these insiders would be selling shares after such a
"bullish" conference call. The stock hasn't reacted accordingly either, trading off highs
after management raised guidance.


Glaukos does have a pipeline of products in development, but currently it relies heavily
on the iStent to grow earnings. Without that continued growth, it is likely that investors
adjust their valuations.


If these insurance changes gain traction and CyPass takes market share, I predict
Glaukos drops at least 50% to about $15 a share. I think the stock will find support at
the $15 level in the near term because that is where it was trading before this earnings
growth. If these insurance changes are limited and don't spread, I still expect Glaukos's
sales to slow.


Investors can short the stock through most retail brokerage houses pretty easily. There
are also options available, but they are so illiquid that buying puts that way is very
difficult.
