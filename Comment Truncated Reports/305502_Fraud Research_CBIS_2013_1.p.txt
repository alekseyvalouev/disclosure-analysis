Why	3	Marijuana	Sympathy	Plays	Could	Follow	In	The	Footsteps	Of
Medical	Marijuana,	Inc.	And	Drop	By	28%

Influential	economist	Benjamin	Graham	once	said,	"Most	of	the	time	common	stocks	are
subject	to	irrational	and	excessive	price	fluctuations	in	both	directions	as	the	consequence
of	the	ingrained	tendency	of	most	people	to	speculate	or	gamble	...	to	give	way	to	hope,
fear	and	greed."


The	Fraud	Research	Institute	believes	that	Wall	Street's	best	example	of	this	irrational
behavior	at	the	moment	is	a	basket	of	small	cap	public	companies	doing	business	in	the
marijuana	sector.	Specifically,	our	research	into	the	4	most	actively	traded	marijuana
stocks	in	the	OTC	markets	leads	us	to	believe	that	Medical	Marijuana,	Inc.
(OTCPK:MJNA)	is	the	leader	of	the	peer	group	and	that	most	price	fluctuations	among	the
other	3	stocks	mimic	the	recent	behavior	of	MJNA.PK	because	they	are	merely	sympathy
plays.


The	purpose	of	this	research	report	is	to	determine	(1)	whether	these	marijuana	stocks
are	just	beginning	to	heat	up	or	perhaps	it	is	a	case	of	dumb	money	chasing	wildly
overvalued	stocks	and	(2)	whether	these	recent	fluctuations	are	a	result	of	fundamental
changes	from	within	the	actual	companies	or	perhaps	these	high-flying	marijuana	stocks
are	indeed	a	great	spectacle	of	the	irrational	and	excessive	price	fluctuations	described	in
the	Benjamin	Graham	quote.


Peer	Group	Comparison	-	The	Companies


Our	peer	group	of	small	cap	marijuana	stocks	consists	of:


Medical	Marijuana,	Inc.
Hemp,	Inc.	(OTCPK:HEMP)
Cannabis	Science,	Inc.	(OTCPK:CBIS)
GreenGro	Technologies,	Inc.	(OTCPK:GRNH)


All	four	of	these	marijuana	stocks	are	very	different.	Perhaps	the	most	significant
difference	is	the	fact	that	all	four	marijuana	stocks	operate	very	different	business	models
that	range	everywhere	from	a	diversified	portfolio	of	wholly-owned	products	and	services

to	a	startup	online	portal	focusing	on	the	publication	of	marijuana-related	content	through
sites	such	as	Hemp.com.	Only	two	of	the	four	public	companies	are	profitable	with	market
caps	exceeding	$100,000,000	dollars.


Perhaps	the	only	similarity	among	all	four	stocks	is	that	they	all	trade	at	outrageously	high
valuations.	Setting	aside	all	speculation	about	the	rapidly	changing	external	business
environments	for	medical	marijuana	companies,	there	have	been	zero	material
developments	related	to	any	of	these	companies'	internal	operations	that	are	expected	to
have	a	material	impact	on	fundamentals.


It	is	our	opinion	that	any	arguments	made	by	proponents	of	marijuana	stocks	that	attempt
to	rationalize	a	100%	or	200%	increase	in	a	company's	market	capitalization	solely	based
on	the	rapidly	changing	external	business	environment	are	sheer	nonsense.

Although	these	four	companies	are	technically	in	the	same	sector,	they	are	all	completely
different	businesses	and	have	very	different	intrinsic	values.	Despite	the	fact	that	these
four	companies	have	very	different	operations	and	long-term	objectives,	it	is	astounding	to
compare	the	short-term	price	fluctuations	for	these	four	stocks.


Peer	Group	Comparison	-	The	Stocks


The	first	set	of	four	charts	cover	a	span	of	6-months.	Note	that	all	four	stocks	had	a	fairly
substantial	price	fluctuation	during	October	2012	-	November	2012,	in	addition	to	the	very
recent	price	fluctuations	that	are	even	more	substantial	than	the	Fall	2012	movements.	So
far	it	appears	that	these	four	very	different	marijuana	companies	experience	price
fluctuations	that	are	highly	correlated	but	it	is	important	that	we	point	out	two	things:

1.	MJNA.PK	trades	much	more	consistent	volume	than	the	other	three	stocks.	Whereas
the	trading	volume	for	the	other	three	stocks	experienced	significant	declines	around
December	2012	you	can	see	that	MJNA.PK	continued	to	trade	with	consistent	volume.


2.	Although	it	is	tough	to	pinpoint	the	first	stock	to	begin	moving	higher	during	the
October	2012	-	November	2012	price	fluctuations,	it	is	very	clear	that	MJNA.PK	was
the	first	stock	to	begin	moving	higher	during	the	past	month.	In	fact,	MJNA.PK	began
its	ascent	in	very	early	January	2013	whereas	the	other	three	marijuana	stocks	did	not
start	moving	higher	until	the	past	few	trading	sessions.

A	Closer	Look


Now	let	us	take	an	even	closer	look	at	how	highly	correlated	these	stocks	fluctuate	by
comparing	5-day	charts.	The	most	obvious	similarity	is	that	all	four	stocks	experienced
sharp	declines	right	around	12:00PM	EST	on	Tuesday,	February	5,	2013.

We	highly	recommend	clicking	the	image	to	get	a	closer	look	at	the	four	marijuana	stocks
aligned	vertically	from	top	to	bottom	in	the	following	order:


1.	Medical	Marijuana,	Inc.
2.	Hemp,	Inc.
3.	Cannabis	Science,	Inc.
4.	GreenGro	Technologies,	Inc.


We	have	studied	these	four	charts	very	closely	and	believe	it	is	astounding	how	similar
they	all	trade;	especially	considering	that	they	are	completely	unrelated	marijuana
businesses	with	very	different	fundamentals.

It	is	our	opinion	that	these	four	stocks	appear	to	trade	in	an	almost	identical	manner
because	the	three	sympathy	plays	(HEMP.PK,	CBIS.OB	and	GRNH.PK)	follow	the	leader
of	the	peer	group:


MJNA.PK	was	the	first	stock	to	hit	an	intraday	high	in	early	morning	trading	and	within
minutes	both	HEMP.PK	and	CBIS.OB	hit	their	respective	intraday	highs.
Look	closely	at	the	vertical	red	line	and	you	will	notice	that	MJNA.PK	began	its	steep
decline	just	prior	to	12:00PM	EST.	Like	clockwork,	all	three	sympathy	plays	began
falling	shortly	afterwards.
Each	stock's	decline	was	met	with	a	relative	surge	in	intraday	trading	volume	and	it	is
very	clear	that	Medical	Marajuana,	Inc.'s	volume	surge	started	first.


After	analyzing	6-month,	5-day	and	intraday	stock	charts	for	all	four	marijuana	stocks,	it
has	become	very	clear	to	our	team	that	MJNA.PK	is	the	peer	group	leader	and	that
HEMP.PK,	CBIS.OB	and	GRNH.PK	are	sympathy	plays.


According	to	Kunal	Desai,	the	CEO	of	BullsOnWallStreet:


"Sympathy	plays	are	essentially	a	play	where	a	stock	in	a	sector	has	a	huge
run	off	earnings,	news,	etc.	Often	on	that	1st	play	traders	will	pile	in	and	push
up	the	stock.	What	tends	to	happen	is	the	[momentum]	in	that	stock	will	spill
over	into	stocks	in	the	sector	[and]	this	tends	to	lift	many	of	the	stocks	in	that
sector."


The	Fundamentals


By	now	we	have	established	the	unusually	direct	correlation	between	each	stock's	trading
activity	despite	how	different	each	of	these	companies	are.	It	is	our	opinion	that	this	is	a
result	of	the	Peer	Leader	/	Sympathy	Stock	dynamic	whereby	the	fluctuations	of	MJNA's
stock	have	an	effect	on	the	trading	patterns	of	the	other	stocks.


Despite	all	of	our	findings,	the	most	important	question	has	not	been	answered	-	are	there
any	lucrative	opportunities	to	profit	from	this	irrational	and	inefficient	volatility	among	small
cap	marijuana	stocks?


In	our	opinion	a	very	lucrative	opportunity	exists	if	MJNA	continues	to	show	weakness:
short	selling	shares	of	Hemp,	Inc.

First,	we	believe	that	HEMP	has	the	weakest	balance	sheet	among	the	marijuana	stocks
with	market	caps	exceeding	$100,000,000.	Of	the	$2,421,496	total	assets	listed	on	the
balance	sheet	over	90%	of	all	assets	consist	of	software.	The	largest	asset	on	HEMP's
balance	sheet	is	LPO	Software.	We	have	been	unable	to	determine	how	the	company
arrived	at	the	$1.8M	valuation	for	their	Legal	Processing	Software	and	because	the	stock
trades	on	the	pink	sheets	that	question	may	never	be	answered.	Regardless,	Legal
Process	Outsourcing	("LPO")	software	is	increasingly	common	with	a	growing	number	of
competitors	and	until	we	are	able	to	learn	from	the	management	team	how	this	LPO
software	is	valued	we	will	remain	skeptical.


HEMP	has	less	than	$300	cash	on	hand	and	hard,	tangible	assets	make	up	a	very	small
percentage	of	total	assets.


Regarding	the	income	statement	for	Hemp,	Inc.,	the	primary	source	of	over	95%	of
revenues	come	from	Stock	Sales.	Again,	because	HEMP	trades	on	the	pink	sheets	it	is
very	difficult	to	get	a	definitive	answer	on	what	this	entails	but	it	raises	some	big	question
marks	from	members	of	our	research	team.


After	digging	into	the	financial	statements	of	all	four	marijuana	stocks	we	hold	a	very
strong	opinion	that	HEMP	has	the	weakest	balance	sheet	and	operational	results	relative
to	the	lofty	$112,000,000	dollar	market	cap	and	it	is	for	this	reason	we	believe	that	HEMP
is	by	far	the	most	overvalued	marijuana	stock	of	the	peer	group	and	therefore	may	be	a
lucrative	opportunity	for	short-biased	traders.


Conclusion


Small	cap	marijuana	stocks	have	been	some	of	the	most	volatile	and	actively	traded
stocks	in	the	OTC	markets.	While	they	have	made	triple-digit	gains	over	the	course	of	the
last	few	trading	sessions,	MJNA.PK	fell	by	28%	on	Tuesday,	February	5,	2013	and	we
believe	this	could	mark	the	beginning	of	the	end	for	all	four	marijuana	stocks	discussed	in
this	research	report.


Our	belief	that	MJNA.PK's	28%	drop	marks	the	beginning	of	the	end	is	based	largely	on
the	actual	reason	why	these	stocks	are	moving	-	irrational	fluctuations	driven	by	greed	as
traders	chase	the	marijuana	sympathy	stocks	to	hyper	inflated	prices.	The	three	sympathy
stocks	will	follow	the	movements	of	the	peer	group	leader,	including	yesterday's	28%	drop
by	MJNA.PK.

It	is	difficult	to	explain	the	current	movements	in	the	small	cap	marijuana	sector	better	than
Benjamin	Graham	did	with	his	quote	at	the	very	beginning	of	this	research	report.	Recent
price	fluctuations	can	be	completely	attributed	to	people's	ingrained	tendency	to	gamble
and	therefore	investors	considering	any	of	these	small	cap	marijuana	stocks	should
exercise	extreme	caution.
