Lee Enterprises: When A Company Burns The Furniture, Investors
Should Short The Stock

The phrase "burning the furniture to heat the house," is meant to express the desperate
measures that some people will take in order to stay warm and therefore alive. It also
symbolizes actions that are ultimately futile - after all, once the furniture is burnt you have
nothing left to burn to keep yourself warm. It's a stopgap measure that is ultimately both
destructive and fails to obviate the final outcome - being left in the cold. We believe that
Lee Enterprises (NYSE:LEE) has been burning its furniture to stay alive by aggressively
cutting costs in order to service its crushing debt load. While these actions have so far
allowed the company to keep its EBITDA relatively stable, the current level of profitability
looks unsustainable and additional cost savings are probably impossible. As we will
explain in this article, the operations of LEE have been gutted and the result is an
enterprise on the precipice of decline. Below we review the two major actions LEE has
taken to maintain its profitability.


Action #1: Aggressively Fire People


Result #1: Product quality declines


Prognosis: Not repeatable and dangerous to the business


Since the beginning of 2010, Lee Enterprises has reduced its headcount from 6,304
people to 4,678, a decline of 26%. If you're wondering how this is possible, it's not from
getting people to work smarter or harder. Firing 26% of the workforce was made possible
by the company's decision to shrink its newspapers. Over the same time period, the
volume of newsprint consumed by the company has declined by 30%. In case you think
that the decline is simply due to fewer subscribers, the newsprint produced per subscriber
has also declined by 14% over this period, which means not only that Lee has fewer
subscribers, but also that each of Lee's subscribers is reading a smaller newspaper. They
are selling into a shrinking consumer base that also consumes fewer newspapers. The
end result of firing so much of its staff is that LEE now produces a substantially less robust
product than it previously did. Here's how the headcount of LEE and the volume of
newsprint consumed looks over the past two years:

Action #2: Increase Prices


Result #2: Subscribers Leave


Prognosis: Not repeatable and dangerous to the business


To combat the decline in the number of subscribers (which has declined 19% since the
start of 2010) and the continued loss of advertising market share by newspapers, Lee
Enterprises has raised its prices for subscribers. Over this period, the average
subscription revenue per subscriber has increased from $29.11 to $34.87, an increase of

20% (or an increase of nearly 40% is you normalize for the size of the newspaper). In
essence, LEE has decided to charge more for a product that is continually declining in
value, as can be seen in the aforementioned decline in both the number of employees at
LEE as well as the company's newsprint per subscriber. Below is a graphical
representation of the average subscription revenue per subscriber, the number of
subscribers at LEE, and the average newsprint volume per subscriber over the past two
years:

An Overvalued Stock


As if the deteriorating fundamentals weren't enough, Lee Enterprises is also significantly
overvalued based on recent transactions in the newspaper industry. We rely on
transactions because there aren't many good comparable companies that trade because
they often have significant other assets such as Internet properties [McClatchy -
(NYSEMKT:MNI)], real estate [NY Times - (NYSE:NYT)] or broadcasting assets [Gannett -
(NYSE:GCI)]. On the other hand, we can look at several recent transaction comps to see
what newspapers may be worth. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)
(NYSE:BRK.B) bought the newspaper division from Media General (NYSE:MEG) for $142
million in May, 2012. In the prior year, the newspaper group had generated about $28
million in EBITDA so they were sold at a multiple of 5.1x. Likewise, Newcastle recently
purchased the Dow Jones Local Media Group for 3.4x EBITDA and also restructured
GateHouse at an implied valuation of 6.0x 2013E EBITDA. In contrast, Lee Enterprises is
trading at 6.2x EBITDA. At the average transaction multiple of 4.8x, LEE's equity would
actually be worthless due to the extreme financial leverage at the company. Even at the
high-end multiple of 6.0x, LEE's equity would only be worth $2.85 or 18% below its last
price of $3.49.


Furthermore, Lee's extreme leverage and dwindling business makes it a good candidate
for a future bankruptcy or restructuring. There have been numerous bankruptcies in the
space over the last 5 years, as can be seen here.

Due to declining industry fundamentals and the rash of bankruptcies in the space,
transaction multiples have collapsed. Newcastle Investment Corp (NCT) says in their
latest presentation that local newspaper businesses can be purchased at 2x-5x EBITDA,
down from historical averages of 10x EBITDA (here). This supports our view of Lee's
equity as being worthless.


Conclusion


Lee Enterprises has embarked on an unsustainable business model of destroying its
product while raising prices in an effort to sustain its financial performance. In many ways,
the company was forced down this road by its enormous leverage, which already caused
the company to file for bankruptcy once before, in early 2012. While this strategy has been
successful at stabilizing the business over the past few years, it is unlikely to be
successful going forward. LEE's short-minded strategy of gutting its workforce (and
therefore its product) while simultaneously increasing prices is doomed to fail. We believe
the stock is worth at most $2.85 per share and is likely ultimately worthless based on
