New Data Show Omontys At Least 4x Worse Than Reported: Now 22
Suspected Deaths

At the time of the Omontys recall in February, "five patients were reported to have died
after receiving Omontys, according to the figures provided by Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY),"
with "three cases of serious anaphylactic reactions associated with fatal outcomes…two
deaths reported prior to February were deemed to be cardiovascular in nature." Since
then, there have been no updates from Affymax, Takeda, or the FDA regarding deaths
associated with Omontys. Has Takeda uncovered something so awful about Omontys that
they want to sweep the drug and all of its potential liabilities under the rug rather than
bring attention to it? Curiously, Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Takeda on 10/09/2013
and there was not a single mention of Omontys anywhere in the entire 49 page report.


In our effort to get to the bottom of the Omontys saga, we asked the FDA to send us the
Adverse Event report for Omontys, which can be found in its entirety here (107 pages
long). The data shows there have been 22 deaths in which Omontys was reported to
be the most likely cause of death! Furthermore, the report shows there has been at
least one death (multiple additional cases of adverse events) reported as a result of
subcutaneous administration of Omontys. Ex-CEO, John Orwin previously said "there
have been no reports of such reactions …in patients receiving the drugs subcutaneously-
although the subcutaneous patient numbers are limited". A key underpinning of the AFFY
bull case was that the drug could be reintroduced under a limited subcutaneous-only label.
That optimism appears misplaced now given a subcutaneous death. The FDA data
presented here renders Orwin's statement patently false. We believe it is extremely
unlikely that the FDA approves an interim reintroduction of Omontys under a
subcutaneous label. Below is a summary of cases with reported deaths.

The summary above excludes other serious, life-threatening outcomes, including
anaphylactic reactions and non-fatal respiratory arrest, which were reported in at least 10
other cases. We were surprised at the sheer volume of serious adverse events reported in
relation to Omontys, and were reminded of something Dr. Steven Nissen said about the
risks vs. benefits of Omontys at a 2011 FDA ODAC meeting: "So what I'm fearful will
happen is that…you're going to be back here in front of this committee in the future, as
you have been in the past, with this drug [Omontys], as you have with other drugs, with
some surprises down the road."


We have written about Affymax (here, here and here) and continue to believe that Affymax
is likely worthless. Given the choice between taking Epo 3x/week during regularly
scheduled dialysis center visits along with other drugs such as Venofer, compared to
taking Omontys once a month at a significantly higher risk of rapid onset death via
anaphylactic shock or cardiac arrest, we believe the choice for not only patients and
doctors, but also the FDA is clear. Don't forget that it appears insiders (who had access to
this FDA data) share this view as well given they have been on a selling streak, even near
current levels (John Walker at $1.92, John Orwin at $1.02).


We remain short AFFY with a price target of $0.44 per share, but the most likely outcome
is that the stock is worthless. Our target price is based on a probability weighted basis
whereby we assign a 90% probability to Omontys being worthless, and a 10% probability
to the upside case of $4.38 per share, implying a $0.44 expected value (assumptions
discussed in greater detail here). However, we believe that the data overwhelmingly
shows Omontys is unsafe, too many bridges have been burned (FDA, dialysis centers,
nephrologists, patients who suffered adverse reactions), and the hurdles for reintroduction
are far too high. Therefore the most likely outcome is that Omontys never comes back and
the Company is worthless.
