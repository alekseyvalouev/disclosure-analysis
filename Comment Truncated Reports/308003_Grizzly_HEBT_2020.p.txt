HEBT Stock Performance As of June 3rd, 2020


Ever since HEBT’s IPO in 2016, the stock performance has been rather 
dissapointing. However, the stock took a steep turn in 2019 as Bodang 
Liu obtained majority ownership and deployed what we believe to be a 
carefully orchastrated stock manipulation scheme

We Believe Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (HEBT) is an Insider 
Enrichment Scheme without Economic Basis


• We believe HEBT is the quintessential example 
why we need tighter disclosure and auditing regu-
lations for US listed Chinese companies. We believe 
HEBT has engaged in egregious wrongdoings that 
should result in immediate delisting.


• HEBT’s stock price has skyrocketed on the back 
of recent private placements at ever higher prices. 
These are touted as confirmation of the company, 
because outside institutional investors are willing 
to buy at a substantial premium to market price. 
We discovered that the investors seem to be in fact 
undisclosed related parties, and we doubt the 
shares were even paid for! It seems this is a scheme 
designed to portray real interest in the stock and 
push the price artificially higher.


• SAIC filings indicate that HEBT’s legacy finan-
cials are completely overstated; For example, from 
2016 to 2018, the total SAIC revenues are 80.5% 
lower compared to SEC financials. Total SAIC share-
holder’s equity during this period is 93.7% lower 
compared to SEC reported number. Our supsicions 
were confirmed by site visits; Locals told us only 
about 20 people work at HEBT's valve business.


• HEBT disclosed, however untimely, in its recent 
20F and press release two arms-length acquisi-
tions. Our due diligence reveals that the acquired 
companies are mostly dysfunctional, and were in 
fact sold to HEBT by insiders who lined their pock-
ets on the deals.  


• These deals also show other major red flags. For 
example, Beijing Hengpu was supposedly acquired 
by HEBT from a third party per SEC disclosure. The 
real sellers are actually related to HEBT’s biggest 
shareholder. Half a year after the transaction was 
supposed to be consummated, we still find no 
share pledge from Beijing Hengpu’s shareholders 
to HEBT.  In short, HEBT paid for a company it did 
not even acquire!


• The company’s IPO underwriter, former and 
current auditor show major red flags.

Background on HEBT


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


HEBT went public on December 27, 2016 and 
issued 2,695,442 shares in its IPO at price of $4.00 
per share. Its original (legacy) business was stated 
as “develop, manufacture and provide customized 
installation of valves and pipe fittings for use in the 
pharmaceutical, biological, food and beverage, 
and other clean industries. “


“The SEC alleges that broker-dealer Spartan Securities Group, Ltd. and transfer agent Island Capital Manage-
ment LLC, which does business as Island Stock Transfer, helped create and sell at least 19 purportedly 
legitimate public companies that were in fact shams…”


FINRA’s website shows that Spartan Securities 
Group, Ltd.’s license was already cancelled in June 
2019.


The market did not buy HEBT’s story after it went 
public. We can see from HEBT’s historic chart that 
the stock price has been declining since its IPO in 
December 2016 until mid-2019. The stock started a 


rather steep uptrend after the company 
announced an acquisition that made a Chinese 
national named Bodang Liu HEBT’s biggest 
shareholder. In about one year, the stock price 
went from sub $1 a share to currently just shy of 
$20, a staggering return of more than 2000% in 
about one year!


Its sole underwriter back then was Spartan 
Securities Group, Ltd. Spartan Securities Group, 
Ltd. does not typically have a good track record. 
On February 20, 2019, SEC filed a charge against 
Spartan Securities Group, another transfer 
agent Island Capital Management LLC and two 
individuals involving sham companies:


The uptrend was due to a series of events that hap-
pened under HEBT’s current largest shareholder 
Bodang Liu, including a series of PIPE and acquisi-
tions. It appears that high net worth assets are 
continuing to push their way into the HEBT, while 
the not so attractive legacy business is making 
room. 


However, we believe HEBT is a stock manipulation 
scheme that engaged in undisclosed related party 
acquisitions and undisclosed private placement 
transactions that have artificially inflated the stock 
price. We believe this scheme has been maneu-


vered by HEBT’S current largest shareholder 
Bodang Liu and his related companies and 
agents. We found that the assets brought into 
the company are essentially toxic or worthless, 
even compared to the legacy business. Inves-
tors chasing this hype will be massacred when 
insiders decide to dump their shares or face 
regulatory scrutiny. The fraudulent behavior we 
uncover in this report is egregious and our 
evidence definitive.  We believe the company’s 
stock should and will be halted.

Research Report


June 3rd, 2020


Legacy Business’ Reported Financials Might be Fraudulent
Regarding its legacy business, HEBT is in the business of manufacturing and installing valves and pipes. 
The company is a limited company established under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on May 29, 
2012 as a holding company. HEBT has ownership of two PRC companies. These two operating entities in 
China Mainland are essentially all of HEBT’s operations and reported financials. 


The two PRC entities are:
 • Wenzhou Xibolun Fluid Equipment Co., Limited (“Xibolun Equipment”, 温州希伯伦流体设备有 
  限公司)
 • Zhejiang Xibolun Automation Project Technology Co., Ltd. (“Xibolun Automation”, 浙江希伯伦自 
  控工程科技有限公司)


SAIC filings indicate that the combined financials of these two companies are vastly lower than what was 
reported to the SEC and U.S. investors. The table below compares the difference between the SAIC data 
and the SEC reported data for key items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet. 


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


(USD'000)          
SAIC Data as % lower than SEC 


Reported Financials 


SAIC Data 2016 2017 2018  SEC Reported 2016 2017 2018  2016 2017 2018 


Total Revenues $2,262 $4,825 $8,814  Total Revenues $27,098 $29,200 $25,290  -91.7% -83.5% -65.1% 


Net Income -$123 $161 $34  Net Income $5,935 $7,136 -$5,145  -102.1% -97.7% -100.7% 





Total Assets $5,793 $12,020 $14,640  Total Assets $47,079 $54,549 $56,654  -87.7% -78.0% -74.2% 


Total Liabili�es $4,600 $9,149 $11,920  Total Liabili�es $15,932 $14,016 $19,896  -71.1% -34.7% -40.1% 
Shareholder's 
Equity $1,193 $2,871 $2,720  


Shareholder's 
Equity $31,147 $40,533 $36,757  -96.2% -92.9% -92.6% 


 
As we can see, the difference is astonishing! For 
example, the total revenues for 2016, 2017 and 
2018 combined from the SAIC data are 80.5% 
lower compared to the financials the company 
reported to the SEC and U.S. investors. Notably, 
the total SAIC shareholder’s equity for 2016, 2017 
and 2018 combined is 93.7% lower compared to 
the total shareholder equity reported to the SEC 
and U.S. investors.


 
This kind of difference cannot be explained by 
accounting treatments. We were surprised that 
HEBT’s annual reports were signed off by its auditor 
in both 2017 and 2018! (We will address the auditor 
issue in the next section). HEBT’s legacy business 
has been well covered by GeoInvesting in 2019, we 
encourage our readers to review their report.

Research Report


June 3rd, 2020


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


HEBT’s legacy business, which is basically a pipe 
engineering and installation business, has two 
subsidiaries. Both are located in the city of Wenzhou, 
Zhejiang Province in China. 


Subsidiary 1: Xibolun Automation


Zhejiang Xibolun Automation Project Technology 
Co., Ltd. (“Xibolun Automation”, 浙江希伯伦自控工
程科技有限公司) is located in an industrial park.


During the visit, we were able to ask locals about the 
size of this company. We were told by several of them  
that there are only about 20 people working there. 
Our investigator validated this by counting the 
number of employees entering and exiting the firm. 
There were only a handful (Note that companies in 
that industrial park have already resumed produc-
tion post Covid-19).


While the building seems to look ok from the 
outside, we found out that HEBT only rented/occu-
pied two floors in the left building.  They do not own 
any of these properties. The rest of the spaces are 
occupied by a total of 7 companies per SAIC Filings. 


Picture of the gate of the Industrial park. HEBT’s buildings are to 
the bottom right of the picture


Picture of HEBT’s two buildings. We found them to be mostly 
unoccupied


Subsidiary 2: Xibolun Equipment


Wenzhou Xibolun Fluid Equipment Co., Limited 
(“Xibolun Equipment”, 温州希伯伦流体设备有
限公司) is the other disclosed subsidiary. 


We were not able to find this business at the 
address mentioned in SAIC filings. Given that 
Xibolun Equipment’s SAIC revenue for 2018 
was already 0, we suspect this entity might 
have fully merged Xibolun Automation.  


Overall, what we discovered about its legacy 
business was deeply disturbing. The head 
count of Xibolun Automation, which we were 
told is about 20, is troublesome. HEBT disclosed 
in its 2018 20F that its total head count was 88. 
Most employees have to be from Xibolun Auto-
mation because per SAIC filings, only Xibolun 
Automation reported revenues in 2018. This is 
HEBT’s entire legacy business! 


We are faced with two possible explanations: 
Either HEBT’s headcount in its legacy business 
dropped from 88 to only 20 in the last two 
years, or the company had inflated its head-
count all along. Neither explanation looks 
favorable for the company. 


Legacy Business’ Reported Financials Might be Fraudulent
On The Ground Due Dilligence Confirms our Suspicion

Research Report


June 3rd, 2020


Auditor Track Is a Big Red Flag


Friedman LLP was HEBT’s auditor from 2013 to 
February 26, 2019. According to HEBT’s filing, 


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


First of all, we do not normally see auditors like 
Friedman LLP get dismissed. The PCAOB Report 
on 2018 Inspection of Friedman LLP stated:


On February 26, 2019, the Registrant’s Audit Committee 
and Board of Directors approved the proposed appoint-
ment of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP (“Wei & Wei”) as the Regis-
trant’s independent registered public accounting firm, 
dismissing the Registrant's previous independent auditors, 
Friedman LLP (“Friedman”), on the same date.


Friedman LLPS made headlines recently as the 
auditor of iFresh Inc. (NASDAQ: IFMK). IFMK and 
Friedman were subpoenaed by the SEC. 


“…in these audits, the auditor issued an opinion without 
satisfying its fundamental obligation to obtain reason-
able assurance about whether the financial statements 
were free of material misstatement and/or the issuer 
maintained effective ICFR.” 


Previous Auditor- Friedman LLP


We want to point out that the company’s current auditor, Wei, Wei & Co., LLP is not better. As a matter of 
fact, Wei & Wei is also the auditor of an old-fashion China-based fraudulent company called China Internet 
Nationwide Financial Services (former ticker: CIFS) exposed by Muddy Waters Research. 


Current Auditor - Wei, Wei & Co., LLP


Another China-based company called Hexindai Inc. (NASDAQ: HX) was accused of committing fraud by 
Bonitas Research in early 2019 and later in December 2019. HX replaced Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu with 
Wei, Wei & Co., LLP as its auditor. Wei Wei, & Co., which is based out of Flushing, NY, appears to be carving 
out its niche as the auditor who is signing off on anything. 


Wei, Wei & Co., LLP


Our investigator visited the auditor’s firm at Flushing, NY. Unsurprisingly we found an auditor firm that 
looked astoundingly suspicious and substandard.

Shanghai Fintech - Financial Service Business Looks Sketchy


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


HEBT acquired Shanghai Fintech through acquiring NiSun International Enterprise Management Group 
(British Virgin Islands) Co., Ltd., (“NiSun BVI”) from Bodang Liu on July 12, 2019 for $7 million. In 2019 20F, 
HEBT disclosed the financial performance of its Financial Services segment and also certain financials of 
its VIE, Shanghai Fintech and its subsidiaries. In our opinion, we simply can’t trust those financials 
disclosed by HEBT.


What does Shanghai Fintech do exactly? According to the Valuation Report filed in June 2019 when 
Shanghai Fintech was announced to be acquired by HEBT, under the Company Overview section, it stated 
that:


汇晶社 is an innovative asset allocation service platform under 范太克（上海）投资控股有限公司 (hereafter referred to 
as “Fintech” or the “the target Company”) . As a third-party service platform for direct selling banks, 汇晶社 has connected 
several domestic commercial banks and rural commercial banks to provide asset allocation services, Internet traffic diversion 
services, IT business system construction services and transaction structure design and construction services. By integrating 
consumer financial assets, traffic, IT business system technology and big data risk control business experience, we will create 
an eco-finance technology platform for professional services direct banking.


The description is not very clear in our opinion. 
However, based on our understanding, essen-
tially Shanghai Fintech, through its asset alloca-
tion service platform HuiJingShe (汇晶社), helps 
commercial banks provide various services to 
their customers online. On HuiJingShe’s website, 
it states that it has cooperated with licensed 
company Ifast Financial China Ltd on mutual 
fund products sale (reminder: it seems like it 
does not have this type of license itself ). In addi-
tion, it also states that it has cooperated with 
licensed company Xiaoyusan Insurance Agency 
Co., Ltd. to conduct facilitation business for 
insurance products (another reminder: it seems 
like it does not have this type of license itself ). 
Basically, HuiJingShe is acting like an intermedi-
ary to connect the customers and the commer-
cial banks and customers would be able to 


“The operating results of NiSun BVI have been included in 
the consolidated financial statements since July 12, 2019. 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, NiSun BVI’s revenue 
amounted to $2,525,524 and its net income was 
$1,469,306.”


The table below summarizes the financials HEBT 
disclosed in 2019 20F.


select different financial products to invest on 
HuiJingShe’s platform. 


HEBT disclosed certain financials for both the 
Shanghai Fintech and its subsidiaries and the Finan-
cial Service segment, and those numbers, in our 
opinion, are simply too good to be true. According 
to HEBT, Shanghai Fintech was only consolidated 
into HEBT’s 2019 financials since July 12, 2019 until 
end of 2019.


Source: HEBT 2019 20 F
In our opinion, these numbers are simply too good to be true. In fact,  SAIC data suggests that they are operating at a loss in 2018. We find 
it hard to believe that the business suddenly turned into a 99.2% gross margin business in just one year

Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


We do not understand why a company like Shang-
hai Fintech can have such high gross margin and 
net margin with such an undifferentiated product. 


When we dug deeper into the HEBT’s financial 
service segment our view of the company got even 
worse.


Translation [Paraphrased]
Keyword “HuiJingShe” is not archived, if you want to view relevant data, you will need to purchase the option to create such 
keyword. Upon purchase, you can add your own keywords. The Baidu Index will update the relevant data regarding the 
keyword on the following day


We searched the Baidu Index, which is similar to 
Google Trend in U.S., on the keyword “汇晶社” 
(Chinese character for “HuiJingShe”), the Baidu 
Index does not even have this keyword in its index 
system. Below is the result returned from Baidu 
Index after search keyword “汇晶社”.


HuiJingShe definitely does not look to be a very 
popular product that people would search online, 
otherwise Baidu Index would have archived it long 
time ago.


We also went to website https://www.qimai.cn/ (七
麦数据) check the total download data for the 
mobile app HuiJingShe. It struck us that the total 
download number of HuiJingShe on Android is 
only 20,869, and the download number for the past 


30 days is only 2! Below is a screenshot from 
qimai.cn for HuiJingShe’s download data.


Our research on Shanghai Fintech and its plat-
form HuiJingShe does not support the extremely 
high margins that HEBT presents to its investors. 
strongly believe that Shanghai Fintech’s finan-
cials are simply too good to be true, and seem 
fabricated.

We #elieve an Undisclosed Related Party #ought HEBT’s 
Private Placement to Pump the Stock 


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


On December 9, 2019, HEBT announced that:


“it has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with two institutional investors, 
Jupiter Trading Co., Ltd (BVI) and Loong Fang Trading Co., Ltd (BVI), companies organized under the laws of the 
British Virgin Islands (the “Investors”), for the private placement of approximately 1.05 million of the Company’s 
common shares (the “Common Shares”) at $6.21 per share, resulting in expected gross proceeds of approximately 
$6.5 million. “


And on May 1, 2020, HEBT further announced that: 


“it has closed a previously announced private placement, in which the Company sold to two private investors an 
aggregate of 1,048,932 Class A common shares, par value $0.001 per share, at a price of $6.21 per share for total 
aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.5 million.”


The stock was trading at $0.85 a share in the beginning of 2019, and it went up over $2 a share after 
announced the acquisition of Shanghai Fintech in July 2019. The stock kept trending higher up to about 
$4.63 at the end of November 2019. The private placement deal announced by HEBT on December 9, 
2019 really helped the stock get another leg up. The company has drawn a wrong picture to the U.S. 
investors. It seems as if external institutional investors are willing to pay a premium to market price to 
acquire shares.  However, in reality, this might just be a scheme planned ahead to artificially inflate the 
stock price of the company. 


Here are the reasons why we believe this private placement is in fact an undisclosed related party transac-
tion. 


We believe the two institutional investors mentioned in HEBT’s press release, Jupiter Trading Co., Ltd (BVI) 
and Loong Fang Trading Co., Ltd (BVI)” are controlled by two individuals who are related to HEBT and its 
biggest shareholder Bodang Liu.


In the EX-4.12 of HEBT’s 2019 20F the company detailed the share purchase agreement between HEBT

First of all, the directors’ name were listed in

Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


Beijing Hengpu – Sham and Undisclosed Related Party 
Transaction with 1.44M Shares of HEBT


There is an acquisition that the company put into its 
2019 20F yet it didn’t put out a press release or 6K. 
HEBT claimed that it has already completed the 
acquisition of a company called Beijing Hengtai 
Puhui Information Service Co. Ltd. (“Beijing Hengpu”, 
北京恒泰普惠信息服务有限公司) on December 31, 
2019 in exchange for issuance of 1,440,894 HEBT’ 
shares to Beijing Hengpu’s shareholders. 


In EX-4.13 of HEBT’s 2019 20F, the share exchange 
agreement stated that the Sellers of Beijing 
Hengpu are Guoya Investment Holding Co. Ltd. 
(BVI) (“Guoya BVI”, Director: Liping Peng) and Hong-
Kong D&L Technology Co., Limited (“HK D&L”, 
Director: Xiaoyun Huang), where Guoya BVI owns 
80% and HK D&L owns 20% of Beijing Hengpu. 


In both EX-4.15 and EX-4.17 of HEBT’s 2019 20F, it 
stated that Guoya Asset Management (Shenzhen) 
Co., Ltd. (“Guoya Shenzhen”) holds 100% of equity 
interest of Beijing Hengpu, including the 30% 
equity agreed to transfer by Hengtai Xianfeng 
Investment Co, Ltd. (“Hengtai Xianfeng”). However, 
6 months after these agreements, the SAIC still 
shows that Beijing Hengpu is owned 70% by Guoya 
Shenzhen and 30% owned by Hengtai Xianfeng. 
That means this 30% of the Beijing Hengpu owned 


by Hengtai Xianfeng has never been trans-
ferred to Guoya Shenzhen. In addition, even if 
Guaya Shenzhen actually owns 100% of 
Beijing Hengpu, why the Sellers of Beijing 
Hengpu are to be divided into 80% for Guoya 
BVI and 20% for HK D&L? Suppose Guoya BVI 
truly owns 100% of Beijing Hengpu through 
its PRC entity Guoya Shenzhen, why would 
Guoya BVI want to give out 20% of the sales 
proceeds to this Hong Kong company HK 
D&L? Things just don’t add up in here. Based 
on our research, HK D&L is incorporated in 
Hong Kong on June 24, 2019 and the compa-
ny’s founding member is Xiaoyun Huang (黄
筱赟), who is an undisclosed related party to 
Bodang Liu (which we would illustrate in later 
context in details). In addition, as the date of 
this report, the share pledge from both of 
these two shareholders of Beijing Hengpu still 
hasn’t fully completed yet. Based on all these 
information gathered, we believe this transac-
tion is a sham transaction that has vastly been 
mispresented to the U.S. investors. 


The diagram below shows what HEBT claimed 
in its filings and what is as of this date of the 
report.

According to HEBT’s disclosure the acquisition happened at arm’s length. We strongly doubt that. The 
most recent personnel change of Beijing Hengpu happened in May 2018, and this was before HEBT’s 
claimed acquisition of Beijing Hengpu in December 2019. Currently Beijing Hengpu’s legal representative

Beijing Hengpu – Sham and Undisclosed Related Party 
Transaction with 1.44M Shares of HEBT
According to this media report on May 13, 2019, management and employees of HuiYingJinFu participat-
ed in the marathon activity in city of Qingdao, Shandong Province. The article mentions Xiaoyun Huang 
as HuiYingJinFu’s CEO. 


“...作为五四运动的缘起地、汇盈金服的发源地，由汇盈金服执行CEO黄筱赟先生领航，一群元气满满的汇盈健


儿，组成了汇盈奔跑团，展现着汇盈蓬勃向上的精神风貌！…”


Translation [Paraphrased] 
“...as the origin of May 4th movement and HuiYingJinFu, lead by HuiYingJinFu’s executive CEO Xiaoyun Huang, a group of 
HuiYing athletes formed the HuiYing running group, demonstrating HuiYing’s uptrending spirit!...”


Another media report on December 20, 2018 shows that Xiaoyun Huang is also the Chief Fintech Officer 
of NiSun Shanghai, where Bodang Liu was Chairman and CEO and 99% shareholder until October 2019. 
Below is a part of Mr. Huang’s speech according to the report. 


“说这个话题之前我得介绍一下宁圣企业管理集团，大家对宁圣这个企业不太熟悉，宁圣是致力于投资金融科


技的企业管理集团，我们在近几年除了我们自身自己打造了一个汇盈金服之外，我们陆陆续续投资了新三板的


中钢网，投资了成都的医美分期给米科技，包括我们现在在做的一个智能投顾平台叫宽策略，我本人title也


比较特殊，叫首席金融科技官，也意味着我们集团在金融科技会有自己的一些布局和探索。”


Translation [Paraphrase]
“Before talking about this topic, I need to introduce Nisun Enterprise Management Group [NiSun Shanghai]. People are not 
familiar with [Shanghai] Nisun, and [Shanghai] Nisun is an enterprise management group that aims to invest fintech 
sector. In the recent few years besides building HuiYingJinFu, we invested in Zhonggang Wang, and medicine and beauty 
installment company Geimi Technology, including a smart investment advisory platform Kuancelve. My own title is a little 
special, Chief Fintech Officer, this also means our [NiSun Shanghai] group will have some plan and exploration in the 
Fintech sector. “


Peng Jiang (江鹏)


Peng Jiang is NiSun Shanghai’s Legal Representative, Vice President and 99% Shareholder. He is also the 
Legal Representative of HEBT VIE company Shanghai Fintech. 


Bodang Liu is NiSun Shanghai’s current Chairman and CEO. According to SAIC information, Peng Jiang is 
NiSun Shanghai’s current legal presentative and 99% shareholder. 


What’s worth noting is that Bodang Liu ceased to 
be the legal representative and the 99% sharehold-
er of NiSun Shanghai on October 17, 2019, and 
Peng Jiang replaced him for these two positions.

Beijing Hengpu’s Business Does Not Seem to be Doing Well at All
Beijing Hengqpu is a fintech platform that focuses on financing companies which are listed on China’s 
New Three Board. However, a closer look on Beijing Hengpu’s website does not give investors particular 
confidence in this company’s business, rather it raises red flags about the current business status. 


First of all, if we select the “capital raising in process” button, there are no investment products available 
to be selected. How does an investment platform not have any investment products listed? Below is the 
product list which has 0 products available after we selected “capital raising in process” button.


Secondly, there are deep issues with the investment products that are already sold and haven’t been paid 
out yet to investors.


There are no investment products available to be selected, indicating minimal business activities

Research Report


June 3rd, 2020


Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


Beijing Hengpu – Sham and Undisclosed Related Party 
Transaction with 1.44M Shares of HEBT


The first investment product shown above is 
about a New Three Board listed company called 
Gongzhun Gufen. The short story is Gongzhun 
Gufen’s Chairman Yiwen Han borrowed a total of 
RMB 60 million from many individual investors 
through Beijing Hengpu’s platform in August 
2016, and the original term was 1 year with 
annual interest of 6.5%. Chairman Han did not 
pay back the money on time. The fact that this 
product, after almost 4 years since its launch, is 
still listed as interest payment in process is very 
concerning.  What’s worth noting is that this 
Gongzhun Gufen was reported to have overstat-
ed revenues by RMB 1.1 billion and faked hun-
dreds of millions of cash. 


The second investment product shown above is 
about a New Three Board listed company called 
Lanbo Lvjian. According to this notice, the 
borrower of this RMB 11 million with term of 1 
year and 6.5% annual interest rate defaulted in 
August 2017. Based on the fact that this product 
is still listed as interest payment in process prob-
ably indicates that borrowers might never see 
their money back. What’s worth noting is that 
this Lanbo Lvjian has already been delisted in 
December 2018 from the New Three Board due 
to its failing to file the 2017 annual report. 


New Three Board in China is the lower-tier stock 
exchange in mainland China compared to 


Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The risk 
of encountering fraudulent companies on New 
Three Board is much higher and this makes 
Beijing Hengpu’s borrowing business for compa-
nies on the New Three Board very risky. Even 
though Beijing Hengpu is acting as the intermedi-
ary for the individual investors and the companies 
from New Three Board, the legal and financial risk 
is still very high. It is also reasonable to assume 
that investor interest is not too great since there 
are currently no investment opportunities listed 
on the platform.


The Neimenggu Provincial Branch of China Secu-
rities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a 
notice to a securities company called Hengtai 
Securities. Part of the notice stated that Hengtai 
Securities’  P2P financial product sales through 
Beijing Hengpu are against the rules and illegal. 
The notice even used the above-mentioned 
Gongzhun Gufen’s product as an example. 


Based on the information we gathered, we don’t 
believe any real third party would be willing to 
pay $11.4 million for Beijing Hengpu. In fact, we 
would like to go a little further and state that we 
do not believe a real third party would be willing 
to pay anything for this company, considering 
the current stringent regulatory environment for 
the P2P sector and the risky business Beijing 
Hengpu is in.

Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


Nami Acquisition – Undisclosed Related Party Transaction 
with $7M in cash and 1.56M shares of HEBT


According to the company’s filing on May 22, 2020, 
the company entered into a definitive share 
purchase agreement with Nami Holding (Cayman) 
Co., Ltd. (“Nami”), a Cayman Islands exempted com-
pany, and Nami Holding (BVI) Co., Ltd (SPV), share-
holder of Nami (the “Seller”) on May 12, 2020, to 
acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of 
Nami. And “Nami is the parent company of a finan-
cial advisory services group that is majority-owned 
and controlled by Mr. Jinbao Li.” Pursuant to the 
agreement, the Seller would receive about $7.05 
million in cash and 1,562,726 shares of HEBT valued 
at price of ~$11.73 per share. 


We believe this transaction is an undisclosed relat-
ed party transaction that is meant to enrich HEBT’s 
current biggest shareholder, Bodang Liu.


We were able to find a Hong Kong registered com-
pany named Nami Holding (Hong Kong) Co., 
Limited (“Nami Holding (Hong Kong)”, established 
in May 2019) whose founder and shareholder is 
Jinbao Li (李金保). We believe this Jinbao Li is the 
same Jinbao Li that was mentioned in HEBT’s 
filing. Below are the screenshots from the annual 
return of the HK company Nami Holding (Hong 
Kong).


According to the SAIC information, this Nami Holding 
(Hong Kong) is the 100% owner of a PRC company 
named Shanghai Naqing Enterprise Management Co., 
Ltd. (“Shanghai Naqing”, 上海纳卿企业管理有限公司)

Nami Acquisition – Undisclosed Related Party Transaction 
with $7M in cash and 1.56M shares of HEBT


On May 20, 2020, according to the SAIC information Shanghai Nami Financial Consulting Co., Ltd (“Shang-
hai Nami ”, 上海纳觅财务咨询有限公司) shares were pledged to Shanghai Naqing.


Two shareholders of Shanghai Nami who pledged their shares are:


 1) Jinbao Li (李金保) pledging 85% of Shanghai Nami 
 2) Xin Liu(刘鑫) pledging 15% of Shanghai Nami.


Source:  Qichacha


After this share pledge, essentially Shanghai Nami is contractually under control of Nami Holding (Hong 
Kong) and Jinbao Li. 
• Shanghai Naqing was established on August 23, 2019 
• Shanghai Nami was established on June 4, 2015


We discovered numerous evidence indicating that Shanghai Nami is HEBT’s related party.


Evidence 1: Shanghai Nami seems to be an alter ego of Benefactum Beijing, which is 99.99% 
owned by HEBT’s biggest shareholder, Bodang Liu


According to the company’s 20F, Bodang Liu, 
through a Cayman Islands company called 
NiSun International Enterprise Management 
Group Co., Ltd., holds 7,778,400 shares of HEBT, 
which accounts for 46.94% of company’s total 
outstanding shares. Chairman Liu is also a 
99.99% owner of a company called Benefactum 
Alliance Business Consultant (Beijing) Co., Ltd. 
(“Benefactum Beijing”, 惠众商务顾问（北京）

with $7M in cash and 1.56M shares of HEBT


Evidence 3: Media reports indicate Shanghai Nami is a subsidiary under NiSun Shanghai. Xin Liu 
and Jinbao Li are essentially management members of a subsidiary of NiSun Shanghai 
According to an article published by Nisun Group 
itself (wechat account is managed by Nisun 
Shanghai ) Shanghai Nami is a subsidiary of Huiy-
ing Financial Holdings, whose controller and

事长林长征、总经理梁威克在汇盈金控集团董事长办公室就达成双方战略合作，进行了商务会谈。


Translation [Paraphrased]
On March 28, 2018, HuiYing Financial Holdings Chairman Bodang Liu, Vice President Peng Jiang, [HuiYing Financial 
Holdings’] subsidiary Nami Wealth (Shanghai Nami Financial Consulting Co., Ltd.) CEO Jinbao Li, Nami Wealth CFO Yan

Translation [Paraphrased]
On September 25, 2017, NiSun Group Chairman Bodang Liu went to city of Bozhou’s Zhuimeng district and Gujing Group 
for visit and communication. Anhui Province Bozhou City Entrepreneur District Chief Guangdong Tian, Anhui Province 
Bozhou City government Economic Development Zone Investment Promotion Bureau Chief Assistant Hui Guo, and Anhui 
Province Bozhou City Gujing Sales Co., Ltd. district sales manager Yang Yang, went to welcome their visit. In the meantime, 
people visiting along with [Bodang Liu] include the general manger Xin Liu of Shanghai Nami Financial Consulting Co., 
Ltd, Yunan district general manager Dongdong Shi of NiSun Group, etc. 


is the CEO of a subsidiary that is under control of 
Huiying Financial Holdings and NiSun Shanghai. 


However, when we went to NiSun Shanghai’s 
official WeChat account, we found that the article 


published on April 2, 2018 was altered. The 
sentence “旗下子公司纳觅财富（上海纳觅财务
咨询有限公司）总裁李金保” was changed to “同
合作企业纳觅财富（上海纳觅财务咨询有限公司
）总裁李金保”. It seems NiSun Shanghai tried to 
cover its tracks by changing the verbiage of “subsid-
iary Shanghai Nami” to “cooperation company 
Shanghai Nami”. 


According to another media report, Xin Liu trav-
eled with Bodang Liu to visit the city of Bozhou in 
Anhui Province on September 25, 2017 to look for 
business development opportunities. It seems to 
us that Xin Liu was acting as an employee of 
NiSun Shanghai.  


To sum up, based on all the evidence provided above, we believe Jinbao Li, Xin Liu, Shanghai Nami are 
related parties to HEBT before the acquisition. We believe that by not disclosing this to the investors, 
Bodang Liu was able to hide the fact that he planned to siphoned off $7 million cash and 1.56 million 
shares from the public company.

Translation [Parapharased]
[Shandong Province] Weihai City Wendeng District local regulatory team fighting and dealing with illegal capital raising 
pointed out in the [risk] notificiation that, Beijing Hengchang Huicai Investment Management Co., Ltd. Wendeng Branch, 
Shanghai Nami  Financial Consulting Co., Ltd. Wendeng Branch, ……16 P2P online lending platforms all have not 
submitted to us the overall ratification and registration completion certificate. And part of the companies’ defaulted loans 
have already been irregularly paid, and [we] urge citizens to avoid illegal capital raising. 


We believe Nami entities are essentially an 
alter ego of HuiYingJinFu, and the local risk 
notification from the regulator did further 
confirm our belief that Nami entities are 
mainly engaged in P2P lending business. 
Although HEBT did not put out any pro forma 
financials of Nami entities, we would like to 


platforms that haven’t submitted  proper regis-
tration certificates. Shanghai Nami’s Wendeng 
Branch was explicitly listed among those 16 P2P 
platforms. 


remind investors just what kind of valuation  the 
market is giving to the leading P2P players in 
China, such as FINV, LX, and QFIN, not to mention 
the multiples and stock performances of those 
lower-tier P2P companies have such as JFIN, PT, 
HX, etc . We believe HEBT acquired a business 
that is simply not viable.

Research Report on Hebron Technology Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:HEBT)


The Endgame - Who Goes Home with What?
HEBT was a boring fading stock until 2019 when 
Boding Liu came into the picture. Since then the 
company has seen its stock skyrocket and 
engaged in a streak of what we believe to be 
outrageous insider enrichment by lying and 
stealing from US investors. 


After all the careful planning and execution, 
what did investors and our trusted management 
go home with? It appears that investors have 
been receiving incentivising PIPE cash and high 
value Fintech companies, all the while only 
suffering a few million shares of dilution.
 
However, we were able to link several supposed-
ly arms-length transactions back to HEBT insid-
ers, and identfied numerous red flags amongst 
almost all acquired businesses. Furthermore, the 


amounts of cash transacted in the Nami acquisition 
and private placement almost match perfectly, 
leading us to believe that cash was never transact-
ed at all.


The net result is that HEBT insider Bodang Liu 
received hard cash and a ton of HEBT shares, and 
HEBT shareholders received companies we dare to 
call worthless. A classic tails I  (Bodang Liu) win, 
heads you (public investors) lose situation. 


With the recent tensions in the relationship 
between China and the USA we believe HEBT is a 
premier candidate for a delisting. We urge regula-
tors to look into these issues.


Worthless Cos


$219M in Value


Note: $219M in value includes 
the value Bodang Liu (insiders) 
are able to achieve from share 
price appreciation of their 
previously owned 7.78M 
shares.
