Summary: Eros International (NYSE:E�OS)
An entity outside Eros’s corporate structure both receives short term loans from Eros and


simultaneously records large payables to an Eros related party.


The entity, Ayngaran International Films Private Limited (“AIFPL”) appears to report very


little other �nancial activity.


AIFPL’s short-term loans & advances represent 249x its annual revenue, and trade


payables represent 289x its annual revenue.


We believe the above raises new red �ags relating to Eros’s receivables accounting.


Today we intend to provide support for longstanding questions posed by short sellers relating


to Eros’s potentially misleading accounts receivables


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/3981030-eross-secret-undisclosed-related-party-links-uae).


Eros has consistently maintained a large uncollected accounts receivables balance which has


indicated at the very least that the company has unusual di�culty in collecting its revenue. At


worst, the balance could be indicative of illegitimate revenue transactions or ‘round tripping


(http://smallbusiness.chron.com/meaning-round-tripping-accounting-65720.html),’ a means of


boosting the operating metrics of a company without ultimately providing any real economic


bene�t.

Eros International: New Receivables

Accounting Questions


In an earlier report on Eros (NYSE:EROS (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EROS)), we had


outlined suspicions relating to Eros Television Private Limited


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4093602-eros-earnings-review-abundance-red-�ags), an


entity that appears to sit outside of the Eros corporate structure and records little �nancial


activity with the exception of a series of advances and payables.


Recently, we learned of yet another entity, Ayngaran International Films Private Limited


(“AIFPL”) that demonstrates a similar pattern: it appears to sit outside the Eros corporate


structure and shows little �nancial activity with the exception of a series of large advances and


payables. The added insight gleaned from this example is that (i) a recent annual Director’s


Report �ling (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/aifpl-directors-report) clearly


identi�es Eros as the key lender to AIFPL; and (ii) the �ling clearly identi�es “related party” as


the primary benefactor of AIFPL’s payables. (as presented in detail below). Related party


entities are later de�ned in the �ling and consist of Eros subsidiaries or related


entities/individuals.


In short, the �ling seems to show that Eros lends to AIFPL which then simultaneously owes


large payables to Eros controlled or related parties. AIFPL records little other �nancial activity.


We believe this evidence renews questions relating to Eros’s receivables accounting practices.


Who Owns AIFPL?


In order to demonstrate that AIFPL sits outside the Eros corporate structure, we pulled the full


equity ownership (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/aifpl-shareholders-list) of


the entity from the Indian corporate �lings database. AIFPL is shown as having 3


owner/directors who collectively own 100% of the equity in the entity.


Neither Eros nor any of Eros’s corporate entities own any equity in AIFPL, as shown in the


linked ownership table above.


AIFPL’s 2016 Directors Report


The 2016 annual directors report for AIFPL


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/aifpl-directors-report) came out in early


August in the Indian Ministry of Corporate A�airs �lings database. As per page 2 of the report,Privacy  - Terms

the entity recorded revenue of only INR 861,660 and a modest loss of INR 4,517,078.


Despite the minimal top line and bottom line activity, on page 1 of the report we see that the


entity recorded a whopping INR 249,021,049 in trade payables and INR 214,728,169 in short


term loans and advances, as shown below:

We �nd the above to be a jarring fact pattern. We simply cannot envision a reasonable scenario


where a company’s trade payables are 289x larger than its annual revenue. Similarly, we


believe it is odd that a lender would extend a short term loan representing 249x the borrower’s


annual revenue.


As shown in later notes in the Director’s Report on page 6, the loan is explicitly mentioned as


originating from “ICD – Eros International Media P Ltd”. ICD stands for inter-corporate deposit


(http://www.biz�nance.co.in/page.php?page-id=29#sthash.odOwM1mu.dpbs), a form of


company to company loan that is prevalent in India. Similarly, the majority of trade payables


are shown as being to a related party:

As de�ned later in the report, related party entities consist of 4 Eros subsidiaries (per Eros’s 20-


F �ling (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152017000332/ex8-1.htm))

What Now?


We have reached out to Eros’s investor relations contact and to CEO Jyoti Deshpande last week


seeking comment on the economic rationale for the business purposes behind the AIFPL


transactions. As of this writing, we have not heard back, but will update this should we hear


clari�cation from the company.


We have also written to the SEC on this matter and will likely write to Eros’s auditors, Grant


Thornton India LLP. In the meantime, we urge caution to investors in Eros.
