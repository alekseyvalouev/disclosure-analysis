Live Oak Bancshares: Massive Unlock, Risk Seeking Business Model,
Target $5.58
Oct. 22, 2015 2:26 PM ET26 comments
by: Greenwich Research Group


Summary


28.6mm shares coming unlocked in a stock that currently has on 4.8mm tradeable
shares and only trades 80k shares per day.


Sky-high valuation at almost 4xBV and 42x earnings.


Bloated senior executive compensation and lavish spending.


High growth induced by unnecessary risk-taking.


Gain on sale accounting - no viable long-term profit model.


Live Oak Bankshares (NASDAQ:LOB) at $17 is due for a major tumble, and it will happen
soon. 5.3M shares of stock came unrestricted on October 21st. 23MM more shares will
become unrestricted in January. The stock has traded down from 19 to 17 on the first
unlock. We believe that the damage to the stock price from the unlock of shares in
January will be much more severe.


Insiders must know that the valuation is ridiculous! They must know that LOB is taking
tremendous risk through its use of the Preferred Lender Status, much more than other
SBA lenders.


SBA loan premiums dropped 200 basis points immediately after the government
increased the cap on SBA issuance. With more companies finding a niche in SBA, the cap
will need to be raised even earlier next year, creating more product, and further
compressing margins.


Management compensation is outrageous and the CEO was sued in his previous
endeavor for misleading investors with his aggressive high-growth strategy - promising
huge returns while ignoring the associated costs. The stock price declined rapidly and the
company was eventually sold for cents on the dollar.


LOB just spent $24m on its luxurious new company campus and it owns 2 private jets with
plans to acquire a third. Three of the top executives were paid more than $2.5mm in total
comp in the last 2 years. This is the most egregious example of negligent spending and

overcompensated management that we have seen in a long time.


LOB is a bank that sells small business association (SBA) loans, and these are super-hot
right now. So hot that LOB is valued at 42x earnings, and almost 4x book value. These
numbers are astronomical for any bank, much less for one that can only do one thing -
issue Gain on Sale SBA loans. LOB has virtually no other real banking business - no
material amount of regular deposits or mortgage loans, nothing.


SBA loans are issued and then flipped In GAIN ON SALE ACCOUNTING to institutional
investors for a quick buck. But there is no real ongoing profit stream. LOB is dependent on
continuing to issue and flip, or profits drop to zero. According to the SBA, LOB is the 2nd
largest issuer of SBA loans in the country, ranking behind Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and
ahead of other behemoths like US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). But
for them, SBA loans are a small fraction of the business; for LOB, SBA is their ONLY
business.


So one wonders how a tiny bank with 900M in assets has become the 2nd largest SBA
lender in the country. First, Live Oak utilized a controversial strategy of hiring non-banking
professionals in the industries that LOB wanted to target. For example, when LOB decided
to target the death business, it hired folks who owned and controlled several mortuaries.
When targeting the veterinary business, it hired the leaders there. Its policy is not to hire
bankers to get business, but to hire "consultants" in the industries who dig up loans. The
Company also utilized proprietary software to assist in the origination process. That and
its use of the Preferred Lender Status (PLP) help it close SBA loans faster than other
banks.


Unfortunately, for Live Oak, now everyone has copied its strategy. Other SBA lenders also
use the Sales Force loan origination platform, and the concept of hiring industry experts
has been copied by other banks that specialize in SBA lending. In our opinion, the growth
rates that Live Oak has seen over the past five years will slow dramatically.


SBA loans are in high demand by institutions right now. With the low interest rate
environment, institutions will pay dearly for this paper to get some extra yield. But when
interest rates rise, other investments will compete for these investment dollars and the
premium paid for SBA loans may drop substantially. SBA loans are currently trading at
113, an incredible 13% premium. This compares to the long-term average of about 7%.
But when interest rates rise, premiums historically have dropped to 2-3%.


Here is a recap of the key highlights from Wilshire Bancorp's (WIBC) 3Q2015 conference
call that covers the severe SBA competition that LOB is facing:

SBA: Gain-on-Sale (GOS) income on SBA declined to 8.6% (vs 9.5% in 2Q15); total
amount of SBA loans sold was 23mm. Outlook for SBA premiums next year is in the
high single-digits (8%). The market is very competitive, with other lenders getting
more aggressive in terms of lending outside their geographic footprints.


The big attraction for SBA loans is that the government provides a full credit guarantee on
75-85% of the principal depending on the term and type of loan. This is the portion that
gets flipped to institutions. The non-guaranteed 15%-25%, portion is typically retained by
the issuing bank. Most banks go through the government's 6-8 week underwriting
approval process to assure that this guarantee will hold under a default. But LOB
circumvents this process, by using its preferred provider status, so that it can issue the
loans faster.


From our calls to other leaders in the SBA market, most have this Preferred Lender
Status. However, the institutions refuse to use it because of the PUT BACK RISK. Live
Oak touts their speed advantage but it comes with enormous financial risk. In an
economic downturn, many of these SBA loans will default and since LOB has not gone
through the government's underwriting, the credit guarantee can be challenged under a
"Repair and Denial" claim. When an institution goes to the government to receive payment
on a default, the government may go back to LOB and challenge their in-house
underwriting, and can deny payment on the default.


The risk here, in our opinion, is a Company Killer! On top of all of this, it's our
understanding that LOB underwrites based on a model - there is little personal loan officer
review of specific loans. It's all done by algorithm. Punch in the numbers and out pops a
'Yes' or a 'No'. This model-based approach has long been dismissed by most banks as
ineffective. But LOB touts this as the wave of the future. They heavily promote their
"cloud-computing" approach as leading edge technology, but it's just an old model based
approach in disguise.


Now, other banks are also SBA preferred providers, and can circumvent the government
underwriting if they want to. This would boost their loan volume substantially. But other
small banks choose not to do so, for fear of risking the credit guarantee.


Aggressive Past Behavior Led to Lawsuits


In the late 1990s, James "Chip" Mahan was CEO of S1 Corp. S1 went on an aggressive
buying spree, acquiring a number of private and public companies in a short time.
Management touted the revenue and profit potential of the combined business, but

ignored the costs and multitude of issues involved with combining and consolidating
companies. The stock price ran up, and insiders sold stock. Unsuspecting buyers knew
nothing of all of the problems the company was experiencing. Later, when the stock
crumbled, the lawsuits were filed. Milberg Weiss sued, alleging:


During the Class Period, defendants sold thousands of S1 shares at artificially
inflated prices, reaping over $45 million dollars in proceeds, while privy to the soon
to be disclosed truth regarding the pressure on the Company's gross margins and
the negative impact of certain acquisitions on the Company's financial results,
including the recent purchases of Edify and FICS Group.


This one states:


The defendants issued materially false and misleading information concerning,
among other things, S1's progress in successfully integrating the operations of the
FICS Group, NV and Edify Corporation, two competitor companies which S1
acquired in November 1999. The complaint also alleges that defendants
misrepresented S1's financial condition, prospects and the Company's operations by
misrepresenting the sustainability of the growth in the Company's margins and
revenues due to these acquisitions. Defendants' misrepresentations caused the
price of S1 stock to be artificially inflated throughout the Class Period, reaching as
high $100 per share… Certain Company insiders took advantage of this run up in
S1's stock price to sell hundreds of thousands of their own shares to the
unsuspecting public, reaping tens of millions of dollars for themselves


Eventually the lawsuits were combined into one in the U.S. District Court:


"The plaintiffs claim that S1 materially misled investors by continually touting its
numerous acquisitions while at the same time knowing that the company was
experiencing increased pressure on its margins and incurring additional expenses in
integrating the FICS, Edify, and Vertical One acquisitions."

The company reported a 233% increase in revenues from the third quarter of 1999
and a 439% increase in gross margins over the previous quarter. On November 10,
1999, S1 announced shareholder approval of the Edify, FICS and VerticalOne
acquisitions and informed the investing public that the deals were scheduled to close
within the quarter and again touted the acquisitions as significant gains. See infra
note 11. S1's stock jumped again, rising from $45 per share to over $57 per share on
November 11, 1999. During the months of November and December, Akkermans,
Mahan and Stockwell sold shares of their S1 stock totaling more than $63 million.


The amended consolidated class action states:


The Individual Defendants had motives to participate in the fraudulent scheme
described herein -- to inflate the reported profits of Si and the trading price of S1
stock by making false and misleading statements and concealing material adverse
information concerning the state of S1's business and its acquisitions. The fraudulent
scheme and course of business was designed to and did deceive the investing
public, including Plaintiffs and other Class members. The fraudulent scheme
artificially inflated the price of Si securities during the Class Period, causing Plaintiffs
and other members of the Class to purchase Si stock at inflated prices.


Shares Coming out of Lock-Up


LOB priced its IPO at $17 on July 23 of this year. Only 4.8mm tradeable shares were
issued. But many more shares are held by retail and institutional investors that are
currently restricted, but will come out of lock-up soon. There are 28.6mm shares coming
out of lock-up, an astounding amount in comparison to the 4.8mm issued as part of the
IPO. From the S-1:


Upon completion of this offering, there will be 33,454,860 shares of our common
stock outstanding. The 4,800,000 shares being sold in this offering will be freely
tradeable immediately after this offering (except for shares purchased by affiliates)
and of the remaining 28,654,860 shares outstanding on a pro forma as adjusted
basis as of July 7, 2015 (assuming no exercise of outstanding options after July 7,
2015), 5,313,620 shares may be resold under Rule 144 as of the date of this
prospectus, and 23,341,240 shares may be sold upon expiration of lock-up
agreements 180 days after the date of this offering (subject in some cases to volume
limitations).

So, on October 22, 5.3mm more shares of LOB will be tradeable, doubling the current
float. In January, 23.3mm more shares will be tradeable. Now, these are investors that
purchased shares privately in the range of $0-$8, and on average have held the shares for
3 or so years. The October shares are held mainly by retail investors who will want to cash
in on their windfall. Even if the stock drops to $10, they will still have a profit and we
believe they will sell.


LOB has traded an average of 80k shares per day for the last 10 days. Volumes were
higher in late September due to the stock being added into the Russell 2000 index - but
this is a onetime event so should be ignored for this purpose. So - what do you think will
happen when 5.3mm more shares are released on a stock that trades only 80k shares per
day? What happens when 23.3mm more shares are released? Wellington is a large
holder with 25% ownership. They are locked up until January along with the other
institutions, but as a value-driven investor, it's our opinion that they won't keep their
position for long once the lock-up expires.


Outrageous Valuation


LOB is priced in the stratosphere. At 42x earnings and almost 4x BV, it's way out of line in
comparison to any competitor. LOB is a gain on sale (GOS) company. GOS companies
typically trade at around 8x earnings. Look even at other small banks that do a large SBA
business. West Town bank (OTCPK:WTWB) is relatively unknown and half of its business
is SBA. It trades at 6x earnings and 1.2x BV. Commonwealth Bank (OTCQB:CWBB)
trades at 9x earnings and 1.1x BV. Open Bank (OTCQB:OPBK) trades at 15x earnings
and 1.1x BV. All of these write a large percentage of SBA loans. Notably they are all
preferred providers of SBA loans but they still go through the standard government
underwriting process so they can assure they keep the credit guarantee in the case of a
problem.


Growth Problem


The current high premium levels paid for SBA inventory is attracting many more, and
larger, competitors. Big banks are getting into the game and focusing more on this market.
Competition has already trimmed premiums paid - a few months ago, they were up to
16%, and now sit at 13%. Still extremely high, but off the peak due to competition.
Continued competition will whittle these down further, reducing margins. We fail to see any
significant volume growth for a niche player like LOB.

But on the flip side, the volume of SBA loans available in any year is limited by law. Each
year, the writers use up the quota sooner and sooner as more writers enter the market.
When this has happened in the past, an accommodating Congress has extended the
program so that loans could continue, but there is no guarantee that this will happen in the
future. When the Government extended the program in June of this year, the premium on
SBA loans dropped by 200 basis points. If the government restricts the total amount of
SBA loans available, LOB's business will be decimated. Competitor banks have other
lines of business to fall back on, but LOB will have nothing to sell under this scenario. This
article describes the problem.


Executive Compensation and Spending


Compensation for the senior management team is outlandish for a bank of this size. Total

Total comp in excess of 2.5mm for 3 members of the executive team! LOB essentially
serves as a cash register for these guys. But not only do they pay themselves egregiously,
they spend money like there is no tomorrow. LOB just completed a $24mm
addition/renovation to its company campus. Look at this architectural marvel.


All for a mere $24mm. On top of this, they own 2 corporate jets, fully financed of course.
Their latest press releases have hinted about buying a 3rd jet. Chip Mahan's explanation:
"We have 2 branches that fly so we can look people in the eye." Apparently, Chip can't
look people in the eye when he arrives on commercial aircraft. He needs a private jet to
look people in the eye. And who is he looking in the eye? Does an SBA loan applicant
need a visit from the CEO of the bank? Especially when the bank uses an algorithm to
determine loan eligibility rather than a loan officer doing a personal review?


Our target for the Bank is on par with almost every public SBA-only lender - Tangible Book
value after the capital raise plus earnings for the next two quarters or about $5.58 a share.
We believe the stock price will continue to decline until it drops to Tangible Book value of
$5.58 early in 2016 after the final lock-up is released.
