CorMedix: Strong Sell On Partner Failure, Misleading Data And Paid
Stock Promotion, -91% Downside
Jun. 29, 2015 10:56 AM ET197 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


CorMedix's 1970s-era chemical acquired for <$1m cash from bankruptcy after 2+
failed sale attempts. Bankruptcy documents show Fresenius passed on CRMD even
at <$2m value while Gambro deemed Taurolidine worthless.


German corporate records show Tauropharm is ~$1.3-2.5m failure, indicating CRMD
market claims are inaccurate. German court transcripts show CRMD patent based
on "outdated" prior art view, so CRMD patent worthless.


The company uses misleading clinical data as in-depth industry research shows
Neutrolin/Taurolidine is a failure while "40% benefit!" versus industry standards is
inaccurate. CRMD now spends more on insider compensation


CRMD's failed shell financially engineered by biotech wipeout artist Rosenwald,
associated with fraud allegations and disasters; the company also partnered with
John Carris who was expelled by FINRA for fraud


Despite 8+ years of "imminent" Phase3 trials and strategic partner claims, with paid
stock promotion and failed company sale process, CRMD stock has temporarily
pumped to an unsustainable 224m+ valuation.


I believe CorMedix (NYSEMKT:CRMD) is one of the most brazen, worthless biotech shells
of insider enrichment I have ever seen. Bankruptcy documents show CRMD is based on a
1970s-era catheter product acquired for <$1m cash the last time this company went
bankrupt under the "Biolink" name, apparently after at least two failed sales processes.
Global catheter companies apparently passed on CRMD when given the option to
purchase the company for almost nothing out of bankruptcy while Gambro evaluated the
product and abandoned it.


After failing on all other prospects (given abandonment of these other compounds), CRMD
was left with Neutrolin. Then, with just 5 full-time employees and this antiqueted product
derived from Taurine (yes, the antioxidant in RedBull), the company was financially re-

engineered into a public shell by famous biotech wipeout-artist Lindsay Rosenwald while
also partnering with John Carris, who was expelled by FINRA for fraud charges involving
an illegitimate tattoo and gun shopping spree with stock manipulation.

German corporate records show Tauropharm (selling a product identical to CRMD's for 15
years) is at best a $3-4m per year business that is not growing and marginally profitable,
indicating CRMD's market size claims are wildly inaccurate. Why does CRMD
management seem to me to pretend Tauropharm financial data is not available when
asked on CRMD investor calls?


Furthermore, direct German court transcripts indicate German injunction courts believe
CRMD's patent appears to have been mistakenly granted based on outdated "prior art"
concepts now viewed as doubtful, making its patent "not valid." While this lawsuit will likely
drag on for years before CRMD loses, these direct German court transcripts seem to me
contradictory to the message given by CorMedix, and in my view, make future CRMD
patent failure inevitable.


Now, CRMD seems to have "pulled out all the stops" with paid stock promotion and
endlessly touting misleading clinical data along with a (NOW) failed company strategic
review process retail shareholders mistakenly believe will result in company sale. As a
result, CRMD stock has become temporarily pumped to an unsustainable $224m+
valuation as it has "seized the moment" to dump millions of dollars in stock while
apparently specifically targeting the most unsophisticated retail shareholders possible.


Using the most optimistic Neutrolin estimates possible AND assuming CRMD
management is honest, its fair value is a maximum of $0.44 per share for -91.04% near-
term downside, with most of that value made up from the cash the company just raised,
which insiders will likely burn and pay out as excessive compensation. I expect, as CRMD
burns through its cash, it will go bankrupt (again). Insider and company stock sales further
support this view.

With CRMD stock imploding as this failure continues to unravel, I think it is an opportune
time to review what happened and how this was an easily preventable financial disaster
for so many retail share (bag) holders. CRMD is a stock I have been involved with for a
while now, and my hope is to use this report as an "Op Ed" template to help explain to
retail shareholders how to avoid getting bagged in the future in worthless biotech shells of
insider enrichment. For many shareholders, it is already too late to avoid capital losses in
CRMD, but you can cut your losses short and learn from your mistakes by reading the rest
of this report.


As a result, this report is unusually long. I encourage you to pour a tall glass of gin and
focus though, as what you read will shock you.


CRMD History: Failed Company Sale Attempts, Bankruptcy And Repeated Wrong
Press Releases


In order to truly understand what is going on behind the scenes at CRMD, historical
context is critical, and I highly recommend you at least read this article for interesting
background. CRMD's sole product Neutrolin is a simple mix of old compounds which the
company claims can be injected into a catheter to try and treat infections in a procedure
known as "Catheter Lock." Catheter Lock protocol is where a dialysis catheter is closed on
each end and filled with an intense cleaning solution to address infection risk. The only
chemical CRMD has any unique claim to is a compound called Taurolidine, which is a
Taurine amino acid derivative originally discovered and experimented with back in the
1970s, which, similar to aspartame, seems to metabolize into formaldehyde. After
apparently failing on all its other prospects, CRMD was left primarily with this
Neutrolin/Taurolidine product.


CRMD was originally known as BioLink (CRMD's predecessor company name), supported
by Spinnaker Capital LLC, and truly began back in 2001 when the first IDE (#G0102000)
for Neutrolin was filed and approved with the FDA. At that time, Fresenius put up $1.5m to
help fund Neutrolin, and Fresenius had the option to buy CRMD/Neutrolin for U.S. and
Canada for $80m, an option which was never exercised.


However, all that apparently failed swiftly as CRMD, then known as Biolink, went bankrupt
in 2003. Prior to formally filing bankruptcy, it is typical for a company to try and sell itself in
order to avoid seeing the business cease to exist. We can deduce presumably this first
sale process failed and that likely CRMD was put up for sale to not only Fresenius but also
Fresenius's competitors in order to try and force Fresenius's hand and avoid getting wiped
out. Tellingly, no buyers of any kind stepped in to avert bankruptcy.

Once in bankruptcy, CRMD was put up to auction. Remember Fresenius already had
involvement with CRMD and knew it well. Pharma/Biotech is an intensely competitive and
public space, so I would be shocked if other global dialysis companies competing with
Fresenius weren't aware of CRMD's bankruptcy auction as well.


Question: If the CRMD asset had any value, why wouldn't a competitor try to steal it away
from Fresenius out of bankruptcy? Why wouldn't Fresenius buy it? The questions answer
themselves, in my view.


In the end, the only one willing to own CRMD/Neutrolin was an affiliate of current investors
that were still owed $941k from CRMD: Spinnaker Capital. It was allowed to "credit bid" its
$941k debt and put up ~$1m in cash to own CRMD outright. In these same bankruptcy
documents, we learn Fresenius bid as well but was not the winning bid, indicating
Fresenius put in a bid lower than Spinnaker Capital's $1-1.9m bid. When the only people
interested in owning your failed and bankrupt company are the current investors throwing
good money after bad, that seems like an obvious failure.


I believe the catheter industry has spoken and the verdict is clear: CRMD is worth, at
most, $1.9m, which is ~$0.06 per share.


The failed company seems to have languished dormant for years until 2008 when
Spinnaker Capital have formed "ND Partners LLC," apparently run out of an apartment in
Boston.

It then took ND Partners and joined forces with notorious biotech wipeout master Lindsay
Rosenwald to "re-boot" this failed company into a public company shell. ND Partners
received $325k and some stock and Rosenwald took a huge piece of the company
through a brutal convertible debt offering.


Even back in 2008, CRMD was touting it would enter its pivotal trial "soon" and with a
product on the market in 2011 or sooner. In line with CRMD's years of failure though,
apparently no credible private healthcare investors would fund this thing, and the latest
investors also presumably couldn't sell the company outright for a profit, so no trials ever
happened. Instead, CRMD decided the best way to get money would be to raise it in
America's public markets with a largely retail shareholder base. The shareholder base
remains largely confused and uninformed retail investors who I believe are falling victim to
this mess.


Who will financially "prime the process" on this worthless failure? Who will step into
promote this worthless shell where insiders get rich? How will insiders salvage their
broken investment no one else wanted to buy out of bankruptcy court? Read on!


So with Rosenwald's help as escrow agent and financial partner, CRMD went to the public
markets in 2011 with the story now that its pivotal study would start in 2011 and Neutrolin
would be on the market in 2013 while the company would file its IND with the FDA (sound
familiar?). This hopeless team somehow managed to raise $12.5m on the back of this

story and the claim its imminent Phase3 trial would cost just $10m, which it claimed it had
cash for. The company also claimed European revenues would be coming in 2011 time
frame. None of this seems to have happened and CRMD kept the money.


CRMD's Lindsay Rosenwald: Involved In Multiple Fraud Lawsuits, Master Of
Biotech Wipeout


Lindsay Rosenwald: Biotech Wipeout Artist - pic credit Rosenwald


You can read on your own all about Lindsay who I think is perhaps the most impressive
Master of Biotech Wipeout in the entire stock market. Basic Google research will help you
find interesting background about Rosenwald and his ties to DH Blair, indicted on 173
counts and described as "massive scheme of securities fraud," or the apparent jail time
and probation of associates with securities issues, or just the uncanny "pattern" of
basically everything he touches to get wiped out, over and over again. You may also find it
interesting to read up on the multiple biotech disasters he has been involved in that
"coincidentally" get sued for fraud, like Interneuron or Ventrus (where Elliot got wiped out
too).


The Rosenwald Pattern, as it is known in the biotech investment community, seems pretty
simple and recurring to me. Take a financially unviable, apparently failed compound
acquired for nearly free, which may be selling minimal amounts in some foreign market (or
not), then promote it, typically with lots of unsophisticated retail investors, then collect

In 2012, CRMD was facing bankruptcy again with the stock decaying near $0.14 per share
and its total valuation of ~$25m. Again, where are the real healthcare investors? Where
are the legitimate healthcare companies who have known about Taurolidine/Neutrolin
since the 1970s?

Instead of choosing to work with anyone credible, CRMD partnered with "John Carris
Investments." John Carris was charged with fraud by FINRA and later expelled from the
investment industry. John Carris CEO George Carris allegedly issued false documents,
when in fact $600k was spent by CEO George Carris on a massive shopping spree of
guns, motorcycle gear and tattoos. Among many issues, FINRA also alleged Carris
fraudulently sold stock and manipulated stock through strange pre-arranged trading and
block orders.


What kind of company chooses to partner with people like this?


CRMD's 10+ Year Graveyard Of Broken Promises


This is not the first time CRMD has announced partnership discussions and imminent
Phase3 trials, as it seems to me CRMD has 8-10+ straight years of breaking its own
promises. I don't have enough time to go through all of CRMD's moved goalposts and
broken promises as that would likely take months or years, but to look at a few
"interesting" recent examples, we can note CRMD has been touting "discussions
underway with global pharmaceutical and medical device companies" for the last 18
months straight. When CRMD again raised money in 2013, it stated:


"we expect that our cash position is sufficient to reach profitability…we would be
able to be at an operating break-even run rate by the end of 2014… we certainly
have the flexibility to get to where we want to be without having to raise any
additional capital"

At the time, CRMD was guiding investors to a strong European launch given its years of
effort and strong marketing push there, but of course all of this turned out to be wrong.
CRMD also has been stating since at least 2013 it planned to partner in the U.S. If nobody
will partner with CRMD who will possibly want to own this previously bankrupt failure?


CRMD has been guiding to imminent Phase3 trial with near-term market launch since
2008 also. The company rehashed this tired promise again in 2010 and is still using this
tired story in 2013 until today. In 2014, CRMD stated:


"want a Phase III program before the end of the year… be ready to launch in the
U.S. either later 2016 or early 2017"


Yet again though the goal posts are moved and presumably after partnership discussion
failure, CRMD drops the early 2014 bomb of:


"we may decide to establish our own commercial organization in the United
States….We have ongoing discussions with a number of companies….we think that
the negotiations with some of these companies will accelerate"


Or how about telling investors on the Q2 2014 call:


"Starting the trial in or before the first quarter 2015….the level of interest increased I
would say maybe dramatically….We're talking to companies that both on the pharma
side and the device side."


Or the tired story from just 6 months ago of CRMD having enough cash:


"we believe that our cash resources as of December 31, 2014 will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our projected operating requirements into the third quarter of
2015"


And just on the Q1 2015 call:


"John Marcel - XG Capital: A follow up question. Do you expect to register more
shares in the coming six months?Randy Milby - CEO At this point, no"

Which we know is wrong given CRMD is siphoning millions of dollars of cash out of retail
shareholders accounts via its ATM. From what I can tell, it seems CRMD has basically
done nothing but tell stories, break investor promises, and raise tens of millions of dollars
largely from retail investors. How can you possibly trust anything these people say?


Just Stop Already CRMD


Picture credit me


We know multiple global catheter companies have shown no interest in Neutrolin despite
established relationships. We know CRMD has repeatedly partnered with people sued for
fraud, and we know CRMD seems to endlessly postpone ever actually running its study to
get Neutrolin on the market, even when the company has plenty of cash. If CRMD and
Neutrolin were really an amazing opportunity, how can all of these things possibly be true?
Why has CRMD been postponing the study endlessly for 7 years (for now, next year it will
probably be 8 years!)? Why can't CRMD find any credible partners? Why won't it just hire
a dang CRO and get this study done? How could this many broken promises and failures
possibly be a coincidence?


We know if CRMD's Taurolidine/Neutrolin truly had gazillion dollar market potential, then
catheter giant Gambro would never have dropped it as it did with Geistlich manufactured
"Taurosept" (2% Taurolidine blend) in Europe a few years back and instead offers coated
catheters now. Fresenius had a partnership with CRMD as far back as 2003 and could
have purchased the company outright for <$2m but chose not to. Tauropharm has been
selling a product identical to Neutrolin in Europe since at least 2003 and yet Tauropharm
has never been acquired by a big dialysis company and flounders along as a tiny failure?
Doctors have been experimenting with Taurolidine flushes for at least ~15 years and yet it
has never caught on, why?


Obviously, Gambro, Fresenius and these global dialysis companies know more about
catheter issues and CRBIs than CRMD ever will (or you or me). So why have global
dialysis companies deemed CRMD's product worthless? How is this possible when CRMD
management told you it's worth gazillion dollars?!? Let me explain…

Why CRMD's Product Is Financially Unviable And Worthless


Unfortunately, most retail investors don't have the resources, tools and experience to
properly evaluate most biotech/pharma companies and instead rely on message board
touts (who in my view are likely dumping their stock given CRMD's stock price implosion)
along with company management, which as we see above has been disastrous. As you
see what the research actually shows, I think you will begin to comprehend what CRMD's
true purpose is and what is going on with your money.


CRMD Claims To Address An Issue That Already Has Countless, Effective And
Cheap Solutions In Use


Unsophisticated CRMD shareholders mistakenly believe "There is nothing on the U.S.
market that addresses this grave problem" when in fact catheters have been in use for
over 100 years, and infections have always been an issue the medical community has
addressed. To think doctors around the world have just been sitting by idly while their
patients die for 100+ years is obviously absurd.


The truth is there are literally countless solutions put in practice as standard protocol at
hospitals around the world. These solutions are effective, easy to administer, safe and use
a combination of common generic drugs that are so cheap as to be essentially free.
Among these solutions are BOTH antibiotic and many non-antibiotic compounds proven to
be effective and cheap. These are all recommended by CDC and other recognized
disease protocol experts, and have been used effectively for many decades.


CRBIs Already Addressed With Dozens Of Industry Protocols Effectively Deployed
For Decades


Straight Heparin is not the standard protocol for infection prevention in catheter locks as
antibiotic and anti-microbial locks are the recommended protocol and have been for

"Clinical practice guidelines recommend antibiotic lock therapy (ALT) for both
prevention and treatment of catheter-related infections (CRI)"


"Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis
and management of CRI recommend antibiotic locks "


"CVC removal remains first-line therapy for management of CRI, especially in cases
of Staphylococcus aureus and resistant gram-negative pathogens, including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. "


The reason for this is that a simple and virtually free Gentamicin flush reduces infections
by 92%, which is actually more than some of CRMD's efficacy claims.

Despite what CRMD may claim, there are dozens of antibiotics hospitals have at their
disposal should any one infection build resistance to any other antibiotic. This is why they
these protocols have been effectively used for countless decades on tens of millions of
people globally. Including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, folate
antagonists, glycopeptides, glycylcyclines, lipopeptides, oxazolidinones, polymyxins, and
tetracyclines, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, citrate, isopropyl alcohol, HCI acid,
urokinase and countless other catheter lock protocols. To claim there is no solution
available for CRBI is beyond absurd and even just 1 minute of Google research proves
that.

Unfortunately, for CRMD, clinical studies show Taurolidine catheter locks are just not more
effective than what is currently being used while both obviously show benefits vs. heparin
placebo:


"Gentamicin/heparin and taurolidine/citrate, used for locking UC, were similarly
effective at preventing CRB and catheter thrombosis for up to 3 months, until a
functional permanent vascular access became available. Both antimicrobial
lock solutions were superior to heparin in CRB prevention with similar thrombosis
rates."


When CRMD's Neutrolin is compared against the current industry standard, it seems to
obviously offer no benefit. Furthermore, there are special products which hospitals have
had for years to address any unusual infection they come across:


"Several agents that may be used for resistant gram-positive infections including
daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline have been studied."


If you still want to buy CRMD, I have some magic beans to sell you (which haven't gone
bankrupt or partnered with fraudsters).

CRMD's Misleading Neutrolin Presentations


As you now know, a simple heparin catheter lock is NOT the standard for infection
treatment and CRMD's comparison and proposed Phase3 trial against this irrelevant
benchmark seems very misleading to me. In fact, multiple medical studies show
Taurolidine lock is functionally identical to the currently established protocol and is
absolutely NOT "40% better!" than what is currently in use. In light of the above, CRMD's
direct statement of "no approved catheter lock solution" seems blatantly incorrect to me. If
CRMD's Phase3 trial was properly constructed and CRMD forced to compare its worthless
Taurolidine solution against what doctors actually use for catheter infections, medical
studies show there would be essentially no advantage and CRMD would fail.


First of all, heparin has no antimicrobial or anti-infection prevention, so using that as the
baseline is like comparing Neutrolin to a placebo. With cancer trials we don't test oncology
products against Skittles or water, so why does that make sense here? Even more
upsetting, putting trial patients at unnecessary risk of death when the opposing study arm
should be receiving industry standard infection protocols seems irresponsible and
dangerous in my view.

Since we know heparin is NOT the industry standard for catheter infections, why would
CRMD use these misleading presentation slides when pitching its stock to retail investors?


Current Catheter Lock Protocols Penetrate Biofilms "Rapidly" And "Completely"


The other bull case for CRMD revolving around biofilms is equally absurd as the current,
nearly-free and commonly used protocols already address this as well. As you can see
below, there are many compounds which rapidly penetrate biofilms by 100%, and this list
is not even close to inclusive and also doesn't even list the multitude of non-antibiotic
protocols in use today.

It's not just the standard antibiotics in use though that penetrate biofilms effectively as
there is a multitude of other non-antibiotic protocols already in use for years which
effectively deal with biofilms and simultaneously offer synergistic effects with the current
antibiotic protocols as well:


"The antimicrobial effect of potential additives, such as ion chelators like
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and citrate, should also be considered.
Such agents have been shown to disrupt biofilm and exhibit synergistic activity with
antibiotics. 12,13"


Many Cheap Non-Antibiotic Solutions Are Superior To CRMD As Well


CRMD touts claim Neutrolin is unique in that it's not an antibiotic, but there are already
many cheap non-antibiotic catheter lock protocols being used around the world that
Neutrolin cannot compete with. This old list below is far from inclusive, but is provided as
example with sites listed, so you can call these places and verify what I am saying.

To expand on this, we can see this study found 1.1 infection episodes per 1,000 catheter
days and furthermore, generic Citrate alone or even simple isopropyl alcohol locks cause
62% reduction in CRB rate vs. heparin. Based on this, it seems a simple iso-alcohol lock
is similarly effective as CRMD's claims!

Some doctors even advocate a simply hydrochloric acid lock as well, which is virtually free
and:


"significantly reduced the need to remove and replace CVCs. The procedure is
practical, appears to be safe, and may reduce the consumption of antibiotics"


While this very simple non-antibiotic also alternatively generated 70.7% lower catheter
infection rates over a study including ~50k catheter days.


Clinical Studies On Taurolidine/Neutrolin Seemingly Contradict CRMD's Efficacy
Claims


To pretend medical consensus on Taurolidine is unanimous is misleading also. There are
multiple clinical trials and medical though leaders who consider use of Taurolidine to be
controversial and not beneficial. This adds an additional layer of risk, and I believe is
another reason, despite being around for 40 years, Taurolidine has never gained
acceptance.


CRMD's Product Metabolizes Into Formaldehyde: Where Are CRMD's Carcinogen
Studies?


Leakage of catheter lock solution into the blood stream is inevitable. Considering this and
the fact Taurolidine metabolizes into formaldehyde, why is CRMD not proposing
Taurolidine carcinogen studies? The FDA has much higher standards than Europe and

Catheter Lock To Become Obsolete Anyway; Coated Catheters The Future: Render
CRMD Obsolete


Unfortunately, these perpetual failure biotechs that never advance to trials (such as
Provectus (PVCT)) frequently see their ancient compounds rendered obsolete by the rapid
pace of innovation that occurs in real biotech and pharma companies. If you talk to
anyone who works deeply in the catheter business, they'll all tell you the same thing:
coated catheters are the future for infection and biofilm elimination when the situation
justifies an increased cost over current protocol.


Technologies relentlessly evolving include anti-microbial coatings, antiseptic
impregnations, ultrasmooth nano-tech coatings, and pharma/biotech solutions.

Biofilm and infection is not an unusual complication in medicine, and the industry has
innovated solutions for this in everything from stents, to pacemakers, to contact lenses.


If you don't believe me, simply look at all the patents recently filed relating to coated, and
anti-microbial coatings, for catheters or the dozens of products already on the market
addressing these issues. The current innovation in medical coatings is impressive and
owning CRMD is inherently a huge bet that the relentless evolution of medical device
coatings will never succeed: if you own CRMD, you are implicitly short medical progress.

All of these trends make CRMD a long-term zero even if you somehow think its product
has value today. This is likely why dialysis giant Gambro dropped Taurolidine years ago
but offers coated infection prevention catheters today. Owning CRMD is effectively a bet
against nanotechnology and innovative coating technologies in healthcare, which is
obviously a bad bet to make.


Neutrolin Not Even Vaguely Cost Effective Vs. Currently Established Medical
Protocols


Probably the most important reason CRMD's old Taurolidine compound is not viable is
because it will just never be cost competitive against what doctors are already using. Even
if CRMD somehow avoided bankruptcy, made it through all regulatory hurdles and was on
the market, it would still be totally financially unviable and worthless.


For example, a typical catheter lock solution will use 0.5ml of 20mg/ml Gentamicin,
5,000iu of heparin and some sodium chloride (saline water). Gentamicin has been generic
forever and so a typical 100mg/ml, 100ml bottle costs just ~$20. If you add up these
ingredients, you can see the typical catheter lock protocol costs a maximum of $6-7 and
most likely much less.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3290585-cormedix-strong-sell-on-partner-failure-misleading-data-and-paid-stock-promotion-minus-91-percent-downside


The numbers I've used here assume both unusually high heparin dosage and zero bulk
purchase discount as well, which any hospital will certainly have. As evidence of the true
cost of your average catheter lock infection prevention protocol check, this Middle East
quote stating $2.50 per lock is typical.


Middle East dialysis presentation


All the ridiculous Roth, Griffin, etc. models using a $20-30+ price per lock application cost
are clearly absurd, and I think there is no chance CRMD could ever make any profit at
these prices. The currently established medical protocols used generic compounds that
are so cheap as to be essentially free and the bulk of the current cost is in the heparin
anyway, which CRMD's Neutrolin has and therefore has no advantage. There is just no
chance Taurolidine with all its risks, doctor perceived uncertainty and cost can ever hope
to compete with what doctors are currently doing when it is infinitely more expensive.
Remember from above Taurolidine locks show are "similarly effective" at best to current
protocols. To convince a cash strapped hospital or health insurance provider, they need to
increase their cost by 10,000% to solve a problem they already have countless solutions
for, is obviously unviable. In fact, it's laughable.


CRMD's Phase3 Trial: Far From Assured


Another demonstrably false claim by CRMD touts is that somehow the company's Phase3
trial is a "sure thing." As we have seen above, when CRMD's Neutrolin is compared
against current industry standard, it is demonstrably not superior as the medical
community has already made these comparisons over decades. We also know CRMD
does not appear to be proposing any carcinogen studies despite that known concern.
There are countless drugs in use in Europe that are not allowed in the U.S. and simply
extrapolating European usage to mean U.S. success is assured is clearly ridiculous.

I think all of the above along with the Phase3 trial is why Elliot is desperately trying to
jettison this failed investment now before the Phase3 trial or product market failure
become undeniable, otherwise why not wait for the theoretically huge upside? Clearly, this
question answers itself.


CRMD Market Claims Far Overstated: German Corporate Records Show
Tauropharm ~$1.3m Business


Tauropharm was spun out of CRMD predecessor BioLink and has been selling a product
functionally identical to CRMD's Neutrolin for 12 years into international markets.
Tauropharm offers four Taurolidine products in the European market: two without heparin
and then in 2007 Tauropharm launched two more products with heparin since some
customers were adding their own heparin independently.


Pic credit Tauropharm


Due to essentially identical products, we can use Tauropharm for a useful proxy for
Taurolidine/CRMD's international market opportunity. Furthermore, since CRMD has said
the two markets are similar in size, we can also use Tauropharm as an indication of how
Neutrolin would do in the U.S. As you can see below, Tauropharm is a tiny company and
basically a failure despite a 15-year head start.


With so many questions about the size of the European markets and Tauropharm, you'd
think someone would just go and pull Tauropharm's German corporate records, which is
cheap and easy (it took me less than 30 minutes to cheaply find it here). I did this and am
happy to share the results with you to help you understand why CRMD repeatedly refuses
to provide any discussion of Tauropharm's financials on CRMD investor calls: Because the
results are abysmal.


Tauropharm has <10 employees (I estimate 3) and has been around for 15 years, yet its
CUMULATIVE earnings are just ~$3.61m euros. That is not a typo.

We can also look at Tauropharm's balance sheet and see it is a tiny business. We know
Tauropharm is the manufacturer of Taurolock bulk product, and yet, we see it has a tiny
balance sheet with total working capital of <4m Euro. Not only that, but also we can see
from the working capital line that Tauropharm's business is, at best, flat lining but likely
shrinking.

From German Corporate Records


Using typical pharma manufacturing balance sheet metrics from peer companies, we can
further corroborate what Tauropharm's estimated annual revenue is as well. Ranbaxy
(OTC:RBXLY) for instance manufactures bulk pharma products and it carries ~258 days of
inventory on hand. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) is more efficient and carries 160 days of
inventory. If we just average the two of these since Tauropharm is small and likely not
extremely efficient, we estimate Tauropharm carries 209 days of inventory.

With the above balance sheet data, we see Tauropharm has ~1.3m Euro of inventory in
2013. With 209 days of inventory on hand that could only support ~2.3m Euros of revenue
for that year. If we consider Tauropharm probably has ~40% gross margins (at best), with
some opex and salary for its 3-4 employees that also roughly triangulates to the income
statement numbers we have above.


Any way you cut it, despite 15 years of effort, Tauropharm isn't a success. You should also
note CRMD claims, in a best case outcome, it would only have a Maximum of 10 years of
market exclusivity in the U.S. so CRMD's results would likely be far weaker than what
Tauropharm has experienced. If that is what CRMD bulls are hanging their hats on, they
are severely mistaken.


Lastly, there is free Tauropharm data online regarding the size of its business. While the
free data isn't as precise, it clearly shows you Tauropharm is closer to 1-2m EUR per
year.

Through four different analysis, we repeatedly arrive at a <$4m per year business after
~15 years of effort and with four different products. I would also note that Tauropharm has
been in the Middle East since at least 2007 so any CRMD touts claiming the Middle East
will be a huge market for CRMD are clearly incorrect.


The reason for CRMD and Tauropharm's failure with Taurolidine catheter locks in Europe
is that the European market is very similar to the U.S. in that there are already countless
proven solutions which are nearly free. Here, we can see a German medical handbook

outlining effective catheter lock solutions from as far back as 2004.


From this book


Germany is also perhaps one of the most cost conscious and efficient developed
healthcare markets in the world. If Taurolidine was some miracle product with a compelling
value proposition, it would not be failing there after 15 years of sales and marketing efforts
generating just $3.5m cumulative of earnings. Given what we now know, how could the
following CRMD management quote possibly be presentable?


"The potential market for Neutrolin, we stated it's $500 million. It's almost evenly
split between the U.S. and EU."


I also find it concerning CRMD management has also repeatedly refused to provide any
color on the possible size of Tauropharm on the investor calls. These records are easily
available so I only see two possibilities here:


1. Is CRMD's management ignorant and incompetent so its "guidance" should be
disregarded?


2. Is the company's management dishonest and self-enriching so its "guidance" should
be disregarded?


CRMD International Launch Also A Failure


We don't need to look at Tauropharm though, we can see from CRMD's international
market Neutrolin failure that Neutrolin/Taurolidine is just not financially viable. CRMD has
now been selling Neutrolin in the international markets for 18 months including Italy, Malta,
Austria, the Netherlands and other markets.

losses actually accelerated badly. If this market were large and viable, I think it is obvious
CRMD would not be failing miserably across multiple countries and multiple sales forces
with its "new! Amazing!" product.


Given everything we just learned, I am not surprised CRMD is apparently not in a hurry to
put its product on the market in the U.S. If the company ever does put the product on the
U.S. market, it seems obvious that it would fail very badly very quickly. If the CRMD "story"
imploded, what would that mean for the "gravy train" of high insider compensation coupled
with significant insider selling? Most likely the company would declare bankruptcy again
and they'd all lose their jobs.


CRMD's Recent German Patent Failure


I think it is clear when dealing with teams of people like CRMD insiders, you, to put it
nicely, should be skeptical. With that in mind, I got the German legal transcript and it
seems to bring up some very "questionable disclosure issues" I believe CRMD's
management need to address immediately as the German courts have spoken loud and
clear and anyone can get these transcripts cheaply with a German lawyer.


I will share with you my own best-effort translations of some choice quotes, but I strongly
encourage you to go get and translate this whole transcript for yourself because it's a
doozy.


For background, CRMD recently sued Tauropharm over a new patent CRMD filed
regarding the company's claims over the addition of heparin to a Catheter Lock despite
Tauropharm selling these products since 2003 without previous complaint. Now this is
being decided across the German courts where CRMD will try and legally outspend a
company that actually has profits and without CRMD's egregious insider compensation
costs. The latest German court decision to go against CRMD is in regards to CRMD's
overly aggressive claim of an injunction against Tauropharm.


In response to this, the German court analyzed CRMD's ridiculous patent to see if it was
novel enough to merit ruling that Tauropharm was in violation and should be stopped. The
German courts clearly ruled NO and the language they provided, which will surely be read
and understood by the patent courts, seems loud and clear.

I'll remind you CRMD's management did not seem to me to properly disclose this initially,
instead the company seems to have filed the bare minimum 8-K SEC filing as required by
law, then forced CRMD shareholders to dial into a conference call. Even then it appears to
me this issue was not fully disclosed in depth, so let me set the record straight.


I believe what you will find is this document clearly shows CRMD's claims to any unique
patentable product is a lost cause and waste of shareholder money.

(Go hire a German lawyer to verify these if you don't believe me)


Clearly, this whole patent debacle is desperate and absurd. CRMD never mentioned any
IP infringement in any of its IPO documents, and Tauropharm has been openly selling
Taurolock since 2003. Why the sudden lawsuit claims if not to temporarily prop up CRMD
stock? Is this just another "story" designed to support the stock price for the benefit of
insiders?

Just looking at this patent mess and using common sense will help you. CRMD came out
of nowhere and sued a German company, in Germany, for a product on sale for over 12
years, based on a recent patent focused on the addition of simple heparin to a catheter
lock. Everyone knows heparin in catheter lock is essentially required and has been part of
the standard protocol for decades. Clearly, the addition of heparin in various dosages is
not novel. This would be analogous to me filing a patent regarding water in KoolAid and
then suing KoolAid co. Obviously, adding water to KoolAid and heparin to a catheter lock
is not a novel concept.


Either way, this lawsuit is probably going to drag on for countless years and cost CRMD
many millions more. What seems clear is any CRMD touts claiming big payments from
Tauropharm are misguided. More likely this gamble will backfire in CRMD's face, and I
believe CRMD could very well eventually be liable for Tauropharm's legal bills (and go
bankrupt as a result?), as Germany is nowhere near as tolerant towards frivolous lawsuits
as America.


If CRMD is obviously such a failure, then what are CRMD insiders really doing with this
worthless product? What are they honestly doing with this failed public company shell?


CRMD's Public "Bagholder Machine": CRMD Insiders Pay Themselves More Than Is
Spent On R&D


Chart built by me with public information from CapIQ


Just the ~5 named executives alone have removed over $15m in shareholder value from
this shell over the past few years while, best I can tell, doing nothing but failing and
endlessly publishing wildly promotional press releases which later turn out to be wrong.
Even more offensive, over the past few years CRMD's insider compensation has actually
accelerated to the point its insiders are now siphoning off more money for themselves
than they even spend on R&D!

How Have CRMD Insiders Possibly Funded This Disaster?


Chart built by me with CapIQ info


Lucky for CRMD insiders, they have a publicly traded shell now which they can use to
dump stock on retail shareholders, so insiders can collect their millions of compensation
for constantly failing to do what they say they will. Without this disgusting public shell, it
seems obvious they'd all just go bankrupt (again) as happened when this was a private
company (despite a temporary partnership with Fresenius back then too).


Keep in mind an "At The Market Transaction Offering" (or ATM) literally entails the
company selling you its stock directly in the market and keeping the cash from your
account. In the light of the retail shareholder base and everything we've seen above, I find
this direct "wealth transfer" to be offensive and disgusting.


Is CRMD Targeting Retail Investors? CRMD's Paid Stock Promotion And Gambling
Conferences


When a previously-bankrupt company has over a decade of failure, with ties to people
sued for fraud, somehow reaches a temporary $250m+ valuation but is held almost
exclusively by unsophisticated retail shareholders, this is a huge red flag. If this is "real,"
where are the reputable healthcare investors?

So how exactly did CRMD end up with one of the most unsophisticated retail message-
board based shareholder bases I've ever seen? Was this an accident?


Unsurprisingly (given Rosenwald's involvement), CRMD has a history of what seems to be
paid stock promotion. For instance, this wildly promotional "Life Sci" report appears made
up to look like a real research report from a Wall Street bank. The fine print at the bottom
of page 46 reveals the truth:


Or this comically bad "Griffin Securities" report which on the surface appears almost real
but, yet again, careful analysis of disclosures reveals the truth, where Griffin is apparently
so bullish it won't even pay for the postage:


Or how about CRMD's CEO literally taking a shareholder-funded Vegas party trip to pitch
worthless stock at a conference apparently aimed specifically at gamblers? This
unbelievable conference includes such relevant topics as "Craps Lessons" and
"Sports/Horse betting." If CRMD was about to be imminently acquired, why would the
CEO have time to go to a Vegas gambling party?


CRMD's Evercore Sale Process: Obviously Failed


Over 3 months ago, CRMD started a "strategic review" process that the company claimed
would take a maximum of 6 months. Since then, both CRMD insiders and through their
company's ATM have dumped hundreds of thousands of shares and made many open-
market transactions. These were not 10b5-1 transactions which could potentially be
protected from insider trading laws, these were straight-up open-market sell orders. Make
no mistake, if CRMD had anything material and undisclosed going on, nobody would be
making any open-market transactions - or they would be violating federal securities laws
and should be in jail, there is no middle ground. The CRMD legal team would never allow
it and it would be in jeopardy of horrific future lawsuits that would wipe it out personally.
Furthermore, with the warrant exercises and cash on hand, CRMD already had 12m+

"partnership discussions" and even hiring Evercore, CRMD's strategic review process to

With all of this now understood, we can see the true pattern of CRMD and what is actually
going on here.

CRMD pattern chart built by me


CRMD has almost gone bankrupt several times and given a raging bull market for
speculative biotech dreck, has seized the moment. Despite claiming the company is "in
play" and with plenty of cash, CRMD claimed it wouldn't need to issue any stock but
instead filed a huge ATM and immediately began dumping hundreds of thousands of
shares of CRMD stock into the corresponding stock price rise largely created by confused
retail shareholders. Literally, taking the cash from unsophisticated retail shareholders and
putting into their worthless public shell where insiders it seems will collect yet another
$15m of compensation and endlessly miss its own promises.


CRMD Must Be A Sure Thing Since Elliott Put 0.00396% Of Its Portfolio In CRMD
Years Ago, Right?


First of all, big name investors get hosed in frauds all the time like Paulson and SinoForest
for example. I will point out three reasons investors are confused about the importance of
Elliot's involvement though.


1. Elliot's backstop of CRMD was SENIOR DEBT and only $3m (way to be bullish…) and
carried both a 6% interest rate and hundreds of thousands of free warrants AND the
loan terms carried insane "death spiral" terms. These "loan shark" terms in no way can
be interpreted by any astute investor as a bullish indication while the total $3m value,
huge amount of free warrants and high interest rate mean that in a worst case
outcome if/when CRMD goes bankrupt Elliot could have ended up owning the whole
company for $3m. Incidentally, this $3m cost is only slightly more than what CRMD
fetched in the last bankruptcy process when no real pharma company wanted to buy
these worthless assets.


2. The tiny amount of CRMD equity Elliot owns was purchased at average prices far
below where the stock trades today.


3. Elliot Management's 1.8m shares of CRMD may seem like a lot to you, but this is
approximately nothing compared to its $25+ BILLION in assets under management.
CRMD represents less than 0.0396% of its portfolio or (as in 3.9 tenths of one
percent) and was likely some random idea from an intern or junior analyst. Elliott isn't
even a healthcare fund anyway, and I think it is clearly trapped in a failed investment,
trying to do anything it can to salvage this failure. The fact Elliot made a mistake here
doesn't change reality.


4. What would you do if Elliot began rapidly selling its stock? There is no margin of safety
in CRMD, and Elliot has no way out without destroying CRMD.

Elliot has been wiped out in Rosenwald disasters in the past as well. Elliot was a large bag
holder of Ventrus which Lindsay Rosenwald actually founded himself. How did this other
Rosenwald disaster, which also lured Elliot in, go for shareholders?

Elliot/Rosenwald's VTUS was a disaster and fell -95.7%, and the company was sued for
"false and misleading statements" and misrepresenting FDA trial info and wiped everyone
out. Not that it matters to Rosenwald though as he was paid $25k a month to Lindsay's
firm Paramount Corporate Dev. While you may get hosed, Rosenwald "somehow" always
seems to do well on his stocks …

Following Elliot into Rosenwald biotechs is obviously a bad idea, and once the Evercore
company sale process formally fails, CRMD's stock will implode like all his other biotech
wipeouts.


Repeated CFO Turnover And CRMD Auditor Found To Have "Audit Deficiencies"


As if the huge mess of red flags above weren't enough, CRMD has gone through 3 CFOs
(so far) since just 2012, has "material weakness" regarding financial/accounting internal
controls, and the company has faced repeated "going concern statements" expressing
doubts CRMD can avoid insolvency.


Even more concerning however is CRMD's curious and sudden "auditor shopping"
resulting in changing auditors now to the questionable "Friedman LLP" who has faced
repeated, failed audit inspections. In 2008, the PCAOB inspected Friedman and found
"audit deficiencies" and "failure to perform sufficient audit procedures." One would think
after a disastrous failed inspection like that, Friedman would fix its issues immediately. In
2013's PCAOB inspection, Friedman actually seems to have gotten worse showing even
more "audit deficiencies." Furthermore, there was failure to test controls related to
revenue and cash as well as "failure by the firm to perform" … "certain necessary audit
procedures."

CRMD's previous auditor CohnReznick was with CRMD for years, and yet the company
changed auditors suddenly despite knowing the above public information about Friedman.
Why would CRMD possibly decide to suddenly change auditors to this apparently low-
quality audit firm shown to have performed insufficient audit work with audit deficiencies??


Furthermore, CRMD only had five employees, but somehow burns through $10-20m per
year! Where exactly is all the money going?!


Given all these red flags, it seems to me CRMD is rotting from the inside out.


CRMD's Extremely Weak "IP" Claims


The most absurd part of all the past biotech failures getting re-hyped in this crazy biotech
market is they are based on ancient technology with corresponding expiring patents. Even
in the ~0% chance a biotech "re-hype" does anything real and ever gets through
regulatory hurdles AND ever make any money, any real generic pharma company like
Teva (NYSE:TEVA), Mylan or Ranbaxy will obviously destroy these weak "follow on"
patents and take drink the milkshake of these random biotechs.


In CRMD's case, we can see the majority of its patents expire about the same time CRMD
management's (endlessly postponed) market launch date and its ridiculous follow-on
patents are weak and likely unenforceable if anyone ever cared to challenge it (they don't).

CRMD Management Response


I called CRMD management repeatedly for weeks to try and get answers, but I was
unable to ever get anyone to pick up the phone. I'm not even convinced it come into the
office and any company that can't answer its phone for investors is a huge red flag in my
view. I encourage you to immediately call CRMD and speak to the company YOU own as
a shareholder to demand it clarifies the multitude of issues raised here.

CRMD: True Fair Value - "Optimistic Case" Shows -91.04% Downside


Now that we understand CRMD's sole product is not commercially viable, let's be very
generous and assume CRMD's insiders don't simply take whatever minimal value or
shareholder cash is left for themselves and endlessly dilute everyone into oblivion. I will
generously assume CRMD's European business grows 40% next year (it won't). I will also
assume CRMD ever goes through with its comically delayed Phase3 AND gets approved
AND launched AND produces sales 3x higher than Tauropharm AND this is all done
according to CRMD management's notoriously unreliable timeline estimates.


Even being optimistic and making all these obviously unrealistic assumptions STILL
shows CRMD's fair value per share of $0.445 per share for -91.04% downside, which is
actually still 3x higher than where its stock traded in just 2012. More realistically though, I
think CRMD will just go bankrupt (again) eventually once its cash runs out and retail
shareholders finally wake up and refuse to fund this insider enriching bagholder machine.
A financially unviable product controlled by a team of people seemingly intent on self-
enrichment is fundamentally worthless in my view, especially as foundational patents are
expiring soon.

Note a full 81.6% of CRMD's fair value calculated above is made up of the cash the
company just raised. I am convinced insiders will just keep this and burn it so this should
likely be adjusted downward in value by some amount, but remember I am trying to be as
generous to CRMD as possible here.


CRMD Stock Technically Breaking Down On Huge Volume: "Head and Shoulders" &
Wedge Broken


The only thing worse than the fundamentals here is the short-term technical chart. CRMD
has broken through a classic head and shoulders pattern, as well as breaking down
through a large wedge pattern. As you can see in the chart below, there is zero technical
support for CRMD stock until ~$1.32 per share, which would still give CRMD a $63.71m
market cap, which as you can see based on the fundamentals above is still wildly
overvalued. I don't have to remind you CRMD was a $0.14 stock recently in 2012 so it
may be interesting to think about the value of your investment as it round trips that price.


Chart by me


I will also point out CRMD stock has been imploding on huge volume recently. You can
trust InvestorVillage or IHub all you want, but the reality is large holders are dumping the
company stock in big volume while all you see on the message boards is wild, unjustified
optimism. I think it is obvious someone is getting fooled, please make sure it isn't you. Are
message board touts promoting optimism while aggressively dumping their stock and
warrants?


It honestly makes me sad to see so many retail shareholders get "bagged" over and over
and over. I'm pleading with you guys, please pay attention and stop buying impossibly
speculative longshots based on suspicious message board touts. Please. There are

PumpStopper Makes His Call: "CRMD Will Never Be Sold For $250m+, Actual Fair
Value $0.000"


"To Plunge or Not to Plunge, That is the Question"


Picture by me


CRMD Conclusion: Don't Fall For It


CRMD's unsophisticated retail investors are expecting a dramatic, company-sale
conclusion to the company's "strategic review process" in 2H 2015, which is clearly never
going to happen. The German patent lawsuits just blew up in CRMD's face and
Tauropharm corporate records show the Taurolidine catheter lock market is a tiny fraction
of that which is portrayed by CRMD.


Every day that goes by is more confirmation the Evercore sale process has obviously
failed. As retail investors understand this reality, while simultaneously the research
showing CRMD's sole product is unviable and worthless, I expect the company stock to
continue imploding eventually back to its previous lows of $0.14 per share on its way to
another bankruptcy while Rosenwald and insiders collect another $15m of shareholder
money based on endless failure and dilution.
