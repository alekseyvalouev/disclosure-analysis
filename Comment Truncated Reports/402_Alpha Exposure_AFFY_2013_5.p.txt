Affymax: Emerging Data Supports Conclusion Omontys Likely Dead
Nov. 12, 2013 10:44 AM ET24 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


After reviewing the summary adverse event report data highlighting a shocking number of
deaths associated with Omontys, (discussed here), we followed-up with the FDA to
request more information. Given the sheer volume of adverse events reported, the FDA
could only partially fulfill our request thus far. Below is a brief summary of the case
narratives that we have received. We are waiting on additional case studies and intend to
follow-up on them once we receive them. The cases below paint a very grim picture for
Omontys showing that severe adverse reactions resulting in death occurred despite
prompt medical attention, and in two cases (9238609 and 9154117), to patients receiving
second doses of Omontys. The FDA data, combined with the lack of commentary about
Omontys on Fresenius' (NYSE:FMS) or Takeda's (OTCPK:TKPHF) latest earnings calls
and the cash burn at Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY), all lead us to believe that the end is near
for Affymax.


Case 9122574


"At 8:16 AM, the first dose of Omontys 15 mg IV was administered and 3
minutes later, at 8:19 AM, the patient complained of "burning all over" and
developed shortness of breath. He complained he could not breathe and
oxygen 10 liters/minute via nasal cannula was given…Benadryl 25 mg IV was
administered at 8:25 AM. The patient appeared cyanotic and immediately
became unresponsive…Epinephrine 1 mg x 2 were given at 8:30 AM and 8:33
AM…the patient was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital."


Case 8811085


"At 13:17, 10 mg of Omontys was administered intravenously. Two minutes
later, the patient shouted out that he was not feeling well. The patient was put
in the Trendelenburg position…The patient stated "everything is gray" and he
became unresponsive."


Case 9122561

Reading between the tea leaves


On 10/31/13, Takeda held its fiscal 2Q'14 earnings call in which there was no mention of
Omontys. Omontys is not mentioned anywhere in the earnings presentation and the only
sign that it still exists is in a footnote in the data book with the following statement: "An
investigation into the root cause of the reactions was initiated and is ongoing." This is
exactly the same language Takeda used in a 6/20/13 letter to the EMA and very similar to
language that was used in February. With no update, no mention in the primary
presentation, and the same vague language about a purported investigation, it sounds like
little progress has been made.

On 11/5/13, Fresenius Medical Care hosted its 3Q earnings call in which there was no
mention of Omontys returning to market, and in fact, a significant portion of Q&A was
devoted to discussing how soon Fresenius would be able to introduce Roche's drug,
Mircera, into its U.S. dialysis centers (Mircera is a drug that is already FDA approved,
Fresenius has experience administering it in Europe, and it is a drug that has similar
dosing benefits to Omontys in that it is dosed once every two weeks without the same
negative side effects). When asked about the timing of bringing Mircera to its U.S. centers,
Fresenius' CEO said "I really can't give you much comment on that at the moment. It
would be inappropriate. But we know how we would do it. So, let me leave it at that."
Given the substantially similar dosing benefits, but lack of negative side effects, it is likely
that the introduction of Mircera in the U.S. could spell the end for the commercial viability
of Omontys in the U.S., and AFFY acknowledges as much, saying "If Mircera enters the
U.S. market, we believe it will be in direct competition with Omontys, if Takeda is able to
reintroduce the product, because of Mircera's ability to be long-acting; therefore, it could
potentially limit the market for Omontys."


Also on 11/5/13, Affymax filed its 10-Q for the period ending 9/30 making no mention of
forward progress or a timeline for resolution of the Takeda managed Omontys
investigation. Additionally, the financial statements showed SG&A expenses burned
through approximately $2mm in the quarter -- despite most restructuring actions and the
associated costs having been completed in prior periods - and a cash balance of less than
$7mm at the end of the quarter. Given the rate of cash burn, the administrative costs the
company would bear in a bankruptcy, the outstanding litigation as well as potential future
product liability claims, we believe the end is near for Affymax. Importantly, in the event
that the Omontys investigation remains ongoing, we expect Affymax to file for bankruptcy
well before it runs out of cash so that Affymax can insure it has enough cash available to
navigate bankruptcy. Accordingly, we believe a bankruptcy filing could come as soon as
January, at which time cash may be below $5 million.


We remain short AFFY with a price target of $0.44 per share, but the most likely outcome
is that the stock is worthless. Our target price is based on a probability weighted basis
whereby we assign a 90% probability to Omontys being worthless, and a 10% probability
to the upside case of $4.38 per share, implying a $0.44 expected value (assumptions
discussed in greater detail here). However, we believe that the data overwhelmingly
shows Omontys is unsafe, too many bridges have been burned (FDA, dialysis centers,
nephrologists, patients who suffered adverse reactions), and the hurdles for reintroduction
are far too high. Therefore the most likely outcome is that Omontys never comes back and
the company is worthless.
