GeoInvesting Stands by its
Claims that L & L Energy
(LLEN) does not Own the
Ping Yi Mine: More Color
Added
January 20, 2012 By GeoTeam


We understand that some investors have attempted to
discredit our research, observing differences between the
mining permit number/address on the official Ping Ying
Mine chopped business license and Mining Permit compared
to web sites posting disclosing the sale of the Ping Yi Mine.
Conclusions based on this observation are baseless.


The Mining Permit number issue in no way unsubstantiates
our findings. Our research is based on a mountain of
findings.


1. Our research was performed using the official
Business License and Mining Permit posted by the
owner. Website postings are secondary to our
conclusions, except for the sale information itself.


2. We have obtained an official chopped SAIC filing of
the Ping Yi Mine that clearly shows that LLEN does not
own this mine.


3. Most importantly, the press release issued by LLEN on
Jan 17, 2012 states that, “Regarding the sale notices
mentioned by GeoInvesting in its article, the Company
never authorized or prepared such sale notices.
Accordingly, the Company does not know the source
of such notices.” In other words, it does not dispute
that the Ping Yi Mine is for sale.

4. The only issue regarding the difference in addresses is
that the owner refers to the older address of Ping Yi
Mine (we will address below).


5. We note that outside of a possible typo or human
error regarding the Mining Permit number, there are
no discrepancies in our argument about the ownership
of Ping Yi Mine.


We stand by our conclusion that LLEN does not and never
did own the Ping Yi Mine. Investors who do not embrace
this conclusion are grasping for strings and playing a
dangerous game.


For more detail on the mining permit and issue about the
address, please read the following explanation:


In this detailed sales post, the sale representative posted
the map of Ping Yi Mine, the business license of Ping Yi
Mine and the Mining Permit of the Ping Yi Mine
(http://www.worldmr.net/Exhibition/ForeCastList/Info/2011-10-11/112458.shtml). The
Mining Permit is as follows:

The first paragraph of the introduction of the Ping Yi Mine
in the same sales post states:


“平关平迤煤矿位于盘县平关镇三道沟境内，距平关约10Km ，有简
易的公路相通，距红果镇约25 Km，交通较为方便。根据贵州省国
土资源厅颁布发的采矿许可证（证号：5200000711358）划定的
矿界，采矿权范围由8个拐点圈定，矿区面积为2.2694平方公里，
开采标高2250m�2100m。”


Translated into English:


“Pingguan Ping yi Mine locates at Sandaogou, Pinguan
town, Pan County. It is around 10 km away from Pingguan
and there is a low level paved road links Pingguan to the
Mine. It is around 25 km away from Hongguo twon and the
transportation is very convenient. Based on the mine map
in the mining permit issued by Natural Resource Bureau of
Guizhou province (No. 5200000711358), eight coordinates
defines the scale of the mine with the 2.2694 m2 and the
exploration depth is 2250-2210 m.”


Apparently, there are two discrepancies between the web
sales posting of the Ping Yi Mine and the posted business
license and mining permit of Ping Yi Mine.


“Sandaogou Pingguan Town” vs. “Yiche village, Pingguan
Town” in the Business License


“No. 5200000711358” v


s.


In the SAIC file, there is a corporate change page as
follows:

This corporate change clearly explained that the Ping Yi
Mine moved from Sandaogou to the current address, Yiche
village. It is reasonable to believe that when the owners
wrote the sale posting, they made a mistake and used the
old address on the sale post.


When the owners wrote the sale posting, they used the
Mining Permit number “No. 5200000711358”, rather than
the  , which Ping Yi Mine obtained on Aug.
2008 and is disclosed in the official mining permit in the
same sale posting. There are several reasons for this
mistake:


1. A typo
2. Before Aug. 2008, Ping Yi Mine had another Mining


Permit, which may have carried the number “No.
5200000711358”.


This does not debunk our finding that LLEN does not own
Ping Yi Mine, which is clearly shown in the SAIC file.
