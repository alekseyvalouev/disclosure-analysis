BofI Holding: A Bank Model Fraught With Peril, 65% Downside Based
On 1.6 X Book Value
Mar. 19, 2014 10:12 AM ET40 comments
by: Greenwich Research Group


Summary


Extremely overvalued at 5 x Book Value.


Flawed business model with waning profits.


Potential capital raise at $80 per share or lower.


Aggressive reserving.


Enormous interest rate risk.


A favorite of the retail momentum investors, Bank of the Internet (BOFI) has been on a
tear over the past couple of years, rising from $16 in early 2012 to over $100 today. But at
almost 5x book value, we find the valuation excessive, and believe that the stock is due
for a large correction. We don't think that the average investor understands the risks here.
We find the business model flawed, and that a large generator of recent earnings growth
is vanishing. We think the bank is taking an enormous amount of interest rate risk, much
more so than a well-run bank would take on in our opinion. We question the quality of
earnings given the recent reductions in reserves for non-performing assets (NPAs). We
further believe that one of the reasons for the recent acceleration in the stock price, the
potential for the acquiring the H&R Block stored value card deposits, would require a
capital raise on the order of $200 million, which would mandate pricing at a 20% discount
to the current stock price.


It's interesting, when we ask bank fund managers what stocks they are short. BOFI is
often the first name they mention. From a valuation and risk perspective it's an obvious
candidate. Trading at 5 times its book value and over 32 times the 2013 EPS, it's more
than a bit rich for a mortgage driving California thrift. Here is how BOFI compares to some
of its competitors and how we derive our $35 target:

Pacific Premier (NASDAQ:PPBI) 1.6 12


Banner (NASDAQ:BANR) 1.5 17


Wintrust (NASDAQ:WTFC) 1.2 18


Umpqua (NASDAQ:UMPQ) 1.2 22


Provident (NASDAQ:PROV) 1.0 13


Everbank (EVER) 1.6 19


However, it's even more amazing that BOFI's numbers are driven by a depreciating -
wasting away - non-agency mortgage asset. Basically the company made a timely
decision and bought various duration mortgage assets at the bottom of the credit cycle at
deep discounts to par. The earnings from these assets are waning. As these assets run-
off, we expect net interest margin (NIM) to drop by 30bp next year. Without other lending
opportunities, this may reduce EPS by $.10 this coming quarter and by $.40 over the
course of calendar year 2014.


One of the reasons for the recent exponential shift in BOFI's price is the stored value card
business. The street thinks that BOFI will be buying the H&R Block stored value portfolio
that has been for sale for more than two years. Every bank that has looked at it has
realized that they cannot make 12+% earnings multiple on the business. Management has
hinted at this transaction forever, but what isn't mentioned is that if they get the transaction
they would need to raise $200 million in capital to support this $6 billion block! In our
opinion, this cannot get done at anything close to current share prices - no big bank funds
would participate at 5x book value. The transaction would not be accretive for at least 2
years. We estimate it gets done at a maximum of $80 per share to attract the amount of
funding needed to support the H&R Block business. To the best of our knowledge, none of
the big bank funds own BOFI now, so why would they buy in at current prices?


So, who owns Bank of The Internet now? In our opinion, long-term holders who don't want
to take the gain, retail traders, and momentum funds who know not what they own, but
just that it goes up. Typically stocks of this nature have dramatic moves at the slightest

earnings miss, regulatory order, or negative mention in the press. As an example, this
chart shows what happened right before last quarter's earnings announcement. A
relatively benign Seeking Alpha article called into question the earnings fundamentals of
the bank - and boom, the price dropped over 10% in one day.


This article just scratched the surface of what is wrong with this bank. Let me start with the
most egregious issues. First, it's blatantly obvious to anyone who reads the 10-Q that the
bank is betting your investment dollars on "Red". Red, being that interest rates stay down.
Does the term Negative Gap Ratio mean anything to you? Well, go into your local bank
and ask the CFO if they would run a triple digit negative gap ratio. Most banks keep this
ratio as close to zero as possible. It's a measure of interest rate sensitivity. If a bank
expects interest rates to stay low they may have a negative gap ratio of minus 5-10%. If a
bank wants to be asset sensitive (expects rates to rise) they may keep a slightly positive
gap ratio. For example, Banner lists a +13% cumulative gap ratio in its latest 10-Q.
Umpqua lists the gap ratio at (-10%) in its 10-Q. But from BOFI's 10-Q, their cumulative
gap is (-138%)!

So, for BOFI, a steep rise in interest rates will obliterate the earnings per share. Banks
cannot adjust this overnight. It takes time to right size the balance sheet. BOFI responds
to this risk by claiming that they will just keep interest rates low on their depositors for a
longer period than other banks. This makes absolutely no sense. BOFI will need to raise
rates the same or even more so than other banks. As an internet bank, it doesn't have
loyal depositors. The bank has to pay .71% on checking accounts. In our opinion,
depositors will move money at the drop of a hat to get a better rate at a competitor.


In the past, BOFI has offered one of the highest interest rates on money market and CD
deposits in the country. This is how it has been getting customers. Up until recently, if you
wanted a high rate of return on your risk free assets, deposit your money at BOFI, (just
don't go over the FDIC $250,000 limit if you want it to be risk free). For example, if you
went to bankrate.com a couple of months ago and clicked on "Best CD rates" in the
country, BOFI may have come out on top, sporting some of the best rates for a given CD
or checking account. But if you go there now, BOFI doesn't even show up in the Top 10,
and oftentimes not in the Top 20. BOFI has clearly backed off the market and this may
affect deposit growth dramatically. For example, for a 5 Year CD, the current best rate in
the country is 2.2% offered by GE Capital. If you scroll down the list, BOFI comes in 22nd
place with 1.35%. BOFI Is clearly cutting back, probably because it realizes it has too
much interest rate risk. If BOFI continues this strategy, then the high growth rates are a
thing of the past, and BOFI's price multiple should come way down to reflect this. I really
don't see how this strategy will work given the dynamics of an internet bank. Here is a
recent article discussing these dynamics when BOFI had market-leading rates:

Banks generally benefit from rising rates because they can charge more for loans
while adding very little to how much they pay for deposits. Over time, a rising-rate
environment leads to larger net interest margin -- the difference between interest
paid and interest received. Some banks are better positioned than others to benefit
from rising rates. Let's see how the industry stacks up.


Online Bankers Miss 
Competing on price -- interest rates, in this case -- can be a banker's downfall in a
rising rate environment. BofI Holding (NASDAQ: BOFI) and Everbank (NYSE:
EVER) do just that: They steal deposits from other banks by offering above-average
rates on deposits. Because online banks compete on price, their deposits tend to be
less "sticky." Customers choose an online bank based on returns, not features or
advantages like branch networks. As of its last presentation, BofI Holding, which
owns Bank of Internet USA, was primarily funded with higher-cost certificates of
deposit. CDs made up 49.8% of its deposit mix, substantially more than other online
and offline banks. Everbank, by contrast, sourced 23% of its deposits from CDs and
other time deposits.


Offline banks have much cheaper funding sources. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC)
funds its balance sheet with very low-cost savings and checking account balances,
which make up nearly $800 billion of its $1 trillion in deposits. It's "core deposits," or
funding that it doesn't expect to vary greatly over time, makes up 94% of deposits,
costing the bank 0.14% per year in the most recent quarter. Bank of America
(NYSE: BAC) pays only 0.17% for its American deposit mix.

Not surprisingly, high-interest internet banks rely more heavily on time deposits and
CDs, which increase their funding costs.


The online banks have a tremendous advantage in a low-rate environment, when
the difference between rates is a huge selling point for low-cost operators. Bank of
Internet's 0.71% APY high-interest checking accounts look like an exceptional deal
when rates are low. But will the promise of 0.71% on checking accounts be just as
attractive if short-term rates run to 1%?


Think about it this way: Wells Fargo pays up to .01% on checking account balances.
Bank of Internet offers 0.71%. If rates rise by 1%, Wells Fargo will offer as much as
1.1% on deposits, whereas Bank of Internet might offer 1.71%. Some 61 basis
points isn't as compelling when the baseline is 1.1% interest on checking accounts.


But even that scenario may be too friendly to online banks. The fact of the matter is,
traditional bank customers aren't fleeing from large operators like Wells Fargo. If
rates go up, they have no real need to push rates higher -- their customers don't use
Wells Fargo because it offers the best rates.


For BofI Holding and Everbank, rising rates will undoubtedly require that they
step up their interest rates in line with increases in short- and long-term rates.
[emphasis added] That could pressure their net interest margin while big, national
operators like Wells Fargo and Bank of America use their trillions of dollars in low-
cost deposits to make much more profitable loans.


BOFI's issues aren't just limited to its liabilities. BOFI's assets, and its reserves, raise
some questions as well. The Bank makes non-conforming jumbo loans across the country.
These loans are typically made to investors based on 1099 income or K1 income (AKA
the Alt-A non-conforming investor that World Savings made negative amortization loans to
for 30 years) While there is an after-market for these loans, it's not traditional. When the
stock market sells off, these loans based not on investors' salaries but instead on stock
market gains and illiquid assets may become delinquent. There is the potential that in the
future these Non-QM Mortgages (Non-Qualifying Mortgages) will be put back to the bank.
Other banks we have interviewed have told us they stopped making these loans as of the
end of 2013.


The NPAs:

Over the past several quarters, BOFI has reduced its reserves for Non-Performing Loans
(NPAs) to 58 bp! In our opinion, this is extremely low. We wonder why they are so
aggressive. Could it be that they wanted to juice earnings so as to beat the expectations in
each quarter? Why do most brick-and-mortar banks, who arguably have better knowledge
of their credits and therefore better underwriting, reserve for NPAs at roughly 180bp when
BOFI has only 58bp? In the future, BOFI's earnings can't be "improved" much further from
reductions in NPAs as they have in the past. Further, if even a small number of their
credits go south, BOFI doesn't have the reserve to cover them, so earnings will get hit and
BOFI will need to build the reserve up for expected future claims. At 58bp there is very
little margin for error.


When you look at the large owners of BOFI, you will find very few bank funds. I am not
surprised at all, but this should be a clear red flag to any retail investor who is long the
stock. Here are the large owners from Yahoo Finance:

Imperial was also a Southern California bank that made non-relationship loans that filed
for bankruptcy several years back. Andrew J. Micheletti is currently the Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of BOFI. He was formerly the Controller for Imperial
Savings. These holders are not bank funds. These are quant shops, index funds, and
momentum firms. There is no Wellington, Harvest, Stilwell, Jacobs Asset, EFJ Alternative
Asset. The large intelligent value driven financial services managers have sold a long time
ago. We asked one bank fund manager whose fund manages over $400M what he
thought of BOFI (He has requested to remain anonymous).

It's like Imperial Savings Industries all over again. They don't make relationship
loans instead their loans are made on an internal algorithm that the guys from Long
Term Capital may understand, but no one else gets.


The financial services fund manager went on to say that:


As a banker, you need to know who your loans are being made to. This bank (Bank
of the Internet), when the credit cycle turns may never see these assets paid back.
There will be a catalyst, either a regulatory order, a turn in interest rates or a change
in credit. Something or someone will tell us that the emperor wears no clothes


There are numerous complaints on Bank of the Internet. I guess running an internet bank
the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. We found it interesting that the CEO of the
bank chose to respond to the online complaints. Here are a few of the more colorful
examples.


Awful bank making too many serious mistakes and underpaying the interests


I wonder if the other customers have gotten similar experience with the SAF Branch.
They make far too many serious mistakes, and are very slow in correcting them (if
they eventually decide to do so). You should double check and calculate your
interest payment to make sure they are not underpaid. Mine has been underpaid for
about half. They also haven't been keeping their promise.


Incompetent employees


Definitely not a place if you are looking for real advise on financial matters.
Representative do not have the knowledge beyond the basics. Experience,
knowledge, and customer service does not seem to be high on the list when hiring
candidates. It seems that personality is the only trait HR looks for when hiring
individuals. However, pure personality does not take you far enough. Definitely do
not recommend BOI.


Purely Awful

Attempted to open a rewards checking account. Went through the standard online
application and was told I would receive back confirmation in 4-5 hours. After no
word back in two days I called and was told I needed to mail my drivers license (note
not a copy of my license) to an address in San Diego. After some very unhelpful
back and forth with an offshore customer service rep I gave up. Total let down,
avoid!


The Worst Customer Service and Sketchy Technology


While the interest rates may be marginally higher & fees and charges marginally
lower, the stellar customer service I had 10 years ago is gone. Now, every complaint
submitted automatically gets a "resolved" & I have to resubmit multiple times -- some
have still not been addressed. My issues include:


- my account was accessed by someone from Intuit as I received an email with
Intuit.com. I did not authorize any non-bank personnel to do anything to my account
at the time. When I reported it, I was told they were "fixing the issue with text
messages" (see below) but the issue isn't fixed


- they've brought in more 3rd parties that receive my data (e.g. the service that
prepares the statements for them) - clearly they don't care about my privacy


- I snapped a clear deposit photo 4x today with my Galaxy 3, following their advice,
but it wasn't accepted


Terrible Customer Service and Lack of Basic Finance Knowledge Beyond the Most Basic


So far they have duplicated a deposit, not allowed pop money, and not delivered my
check to a payee but offered to charge $35 to stop payment and send it again. My
suggestion is to find a different online bank. Now they have rejected mobile deposits
because they do not understand the word beneficiary. A supervisor finally overruled
after multiple notes and phone calls and allowed the deposits, but they forgot to do
one. They are the worst banking customer service group I have ever worked with.
Also, if you do a mobile deposit, make sure you check that it goes in because they
rejected mine with no email notification whatsoever. They claimed the system was
broken but only after I asked.

The company's stock price has had a perfect momentum manager's chart for the last
three years, but over the last three months it has been parabolic. Let's delve into why that
is. Over the last 3 months there have been over 10 positive articles written on the name.
The Motley Fool, Authors on Seeking Alpha, IBD have more than foamed at the mouth.
We believe that the Motley Fool did a six article piece on the company (does it really take
6 articles to pump a simple bank stock). One, maybe two, but not six. Obviously, it was
someone's intention to drive the stock price up! Here is a sampling:

The Critical Thing You are Overlooking at these Banks


However, some of the comments from these articles called into question the bullish thesis.
HERE IS ONE that hits home:


I think you guys are really missing the regulatory point here. Other banks are not
doing this because they are not allowed to do it. From a theoretical standpoint,
funding oneself with brokered deposits and CDs that pay higher than market interest
rates, and then growing at a breakneck pace is not good for the overall risk of the
market. Can you imagine what would happen if every other bank tried to do this?
Credit quality would go into the toilet overnight. Technologically and feasibly, every
other bank could run this business model overnight. BOFI is operating in a
regulatory loophole essentially, and while that can continue as long as things go
well, it is unrealistic to think that the government will let them grow to be a
systemically important bank (which a $20b bank would be) with only one branch.


What's more amazing is that this company started from nothing. This was a small bank
lender making a bunch of RV loans, with other hairball assets. The company made an
amazing bet on non-agency assets at the bottom of the credit cycle, offered very high
