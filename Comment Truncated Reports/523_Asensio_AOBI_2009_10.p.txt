AOB’s Questionable CAXG Acquisition and
Interesting Dominica Passport Numbering.


Posted on November 11, 2009 by Asensio.com


Notice


In the past AOB has issued public statements regarding reports
published by asensio.com. In the event that asensio.com
receives comments from AOB on the report below, asensio.com
will provide such comments to its users, and state whether the
company’s comments alter any conclusion or assertion in the
report. Investors may also contact AOB concerning issues
raised in this report.  


On April 16, 2008, American Oriental Bioengineering, Inc. (NYSE:


AOB $4.57) paid $18 million in cash for a 38% stake in China Aoxing


Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. (OTC: CAXG $1.24), according to AOB’s and


CAXG’s SEC filings. (See AOB’s filing and CAXG’s filing.) According to


CAXG’s 2008 10-K, on April 16, 2008, CAXG ‘simultaneously’


acquired Shijazhuang Lerentang Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd.


(“LRT”) for $22.9 million, comprised of $12.4 million in cash from


the funds it received from AOB and 8 million shares of CAXG


common stock valued at $10.5 million.


One year before AOB’s investment in CAXG (and CAXG’s


simultaneous acquisition of LRT), CAXG stated that it had signed a


letter of intent to acquire LRT for “approximately $10 Million,”


according to CAXG’s 2007 10-K.


Like AOB, CAXG is a Chinese company listed in the U.S. through a


reverse merger. AOB’s CAXG investment presents several issues.


CAXG’s auditor is a firm called Paritz & Company, P.A. Paritz has one


office in Hackensack, New Jersey.

Paritz has given CAXG a “going concern” qualification for the past


four consecutive years, commencing in 2006, two years prior to


AOB’s investment. Even after AOB’s investment, Paritz still found


that CAXG’s working capital deficit raises “substantial doubt about


its ability to continue as a going concern.” The auditor also notes


that “the Company is in default of the repayment of note payable-


bank of $6,094,428.” (Click here to see auditor’s letters from past


four CAXG 10-Ks.)


CAXG’s restated 2007 earnings show interest expense of more than


$16 million with under $2 million of revenue. CAXG also restated its


earnings for 2006. (Click here to see 2006 and 2007 income


statement.)


In 2008, CAXG recorded a gain on “change in fair value of warrant


and derivative liabilities” of $8.5 million, which was greater than


CAXG’s $7.1 million in revenue for the year. (Click here to see 2008


and 2009 income statement.)


CAXG reported an operating loss each fiscal year since its reverse


merger in 2006.


AOB and CAXG appear to be connected by Warner Technology and


Investment Corp. and possibly American Union Securities.


Warner obtained an option to acquire 551,415 CAXG shares in


connection with CAXG’s reverse merger, and also later served as


consultant. Warner’s English website describes its business as


“assisting private companies seeking to become public company


[sic] through IPO or reverse merger processes” and cites AOB as one


of its “case studies”. Warner also appears as an agent for AOB in


certain of AOB’s SEC filings from 2002, around the time of AOB’s


reverse merger. Warner’s Chinese website shows a statement from


Huakang Zhou, Warner’s chairman, discussing arranging AOB’s


reverse merger and working with American Union Securities to


arrange financing (see translation).


American Union Securities is currently majority owned by Dong


Dong “Peter” Zhou, who may be related to Huakang Zhou of


Warner. American Union’s founder, former majority owner and


former President, John C. Leo, was a director of CAXG from the time


of CAXG’s reverse merger in April 2006 until January 2007.


A person named Jason Liu has appeared on websites for Warner


and American Union apparently as an employee of Warner and


consultant to American Union. A Jason Liu also appears as a


shareholder of a Hong Kong company, Silver Linkage Holdings


Limited, where AOB’s Chairman Tony Liu is the controlling


shareholder, according to filings with the Hong Kong Companies


Registry (“HKCR”). Silver Linkage is discussed in a previous


asensio.com report. HKCR filings show Jason Liu transferring his

Asensio and FINRA


Asensio & Company, Inc.
and Manuel P. Asensio
are the only dedicated
short sellers ever to have
been members of FINRA.
This unique-minority
membership created
complications in the
regulatory relationship.
Being the first activist
short investors and
among the first FINRA
member firms with a
website added to the
complexity. A statement
by Mr. Asensio is
available here.
Information necessary to
obtain a meaningful
understanding of the
dispute is available in
complete form HERE.
