Past case studies can provide important information about how current events are likely to
play out. Regarding Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY), we conducted in depth research looking
for past examples of drugs that had been subject to recalls and subsequently made their
way back onto the commercial market in the United States. We hoped that this would
inform our analysis of its drug, Omontys, which has been recalled. We didn't find many
case studies and in the examples that we did find, the facts and circumstances
surrounding the drug and its reintroduction were extremely unique with few similarities to
the current situation with Omontys. This reinforced our initial conclusion that a return of
Omontys is very unlikely. We present two case studies below (Tysabri and Lotronex),
which we believe delineate key characteristics of drugs that have a reasonable chance of
being reintroduced to the U.S. market following a recall. Omontys has none of these
characteristics. As a result, we remain short Affymax, with a price target of $0.44.


TYSABRI


Tysabri was approved by the FDA for treatment of relapsing remitting forms of multiple
sclerosis (MS) on 11/23/2004. At the time, Tysabri was thought to represent a significant
advance in the treatment of MS, with studies showing Tysabri was effective in substantially
reducing patients' relapse rate. This table from a 2004 JPMorgan report summarizes key
differences among MS treatments at the time:

However, on 2/28/2005, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn after two reported cases of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML] associated with patients receiving
Tysabri for MS, including one death. In conjunction with the withdrawal, the FDA stated:
"FDA continues to believe Tysabri offers great hope to MS patients" (note the FDA did
not make such a statement about Omontys).


After an exhaustive study that included reviewing each patient who had been administered
Tysabri, an FDA advisory panel unanimously voted in favor of Tysabri's return to market,
requiring no additional studies in March 2006. On 6/5/2006, the FDA approved resumed
marketing of Tysabri under a special restricted distribution program with significant
limitations recommended specifically for, "patients who have not responded adequately to,
or cannot tolerate other treatments for MS."


Unlike Omontys for the treatment of anemia for patients on dialysis, Tysabri demonstrated
a meaningful improvement in MS therapy for a broad population by reducing relapse
rates, slowing disease progression, and improving patients' quality of life. While Tysabri
could also be administered on a more efficient dosing schedule (IV monthly vs. SC daily-
to-weekly for other MS drugs), there was no mention of this factor in the FDA's decision to

re-approve Tysabri. We believe the key benefit of Omontys over existing drugs in the
market, most notably Epogen, is its ability to be administered on a less frequent dosing
schedule, and aside from this, Omontys demonstrates very limited clinical benefits over
existing treatments. Importantly, even this benefit is of limited utility to dialysis patients,
because many of them need to visit dialysis centers multiple times each week for
treatments other than Epogen. As a result, we believe it is very unlikely that the FDA re-
approves Omontys based on its rationale for re-approving Tysabri.


LOTRONEX


Lotronex was approved by the FDA for treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome [IBS] in
women whose predominant bowel symptom was diarrhea on 2/9/2000. In October 2000,
the FDA announced it was re-evaluating Lotronex as a result of reported serious adverse
reactions. On 11/28/2000, Lotronex was voluntarily withdrawn after reports of 5 deaths
and additional bowel surgeries.


According to an FDA briefing document [pdf] from December 2000 to December 2001,
following the withdrawal of Lotronex, both the manufacturer and the FDA, "received an
unprecedented number of communications from physicians, IBS patients and IBS patient
advocacy groups requesting that the withdrawal of Lotronex be reconsidered." This
resulted in an FDA Gastrointestinal Advisory Committee being convened to review
Lotronex. The advisory panel voted 14-2 in favor of approving Lotronex for IBS with
diarrhea as the predominant symptom subject to severe marketing restrictions. On
6/7/2002, the FDA re-approved Lotronex for restricted marketing only in patients with ALL
of the following symptoms: (i) significant stomach cramps and pains or bloating, (ii)
inability to control the needs to have a bowel movement or have "accidents", and (iii)
inability to lead a normal home or work life because of the need to be near a bathroom.


The FDA released the following statement along with its re-approval: "The FDA is aware
of the need to balance between access to effective therapies (particularly when
conditions are serious, debilitating, or life threatening, and when no satisfactory
alternative therapy exists) and protection of the public from serious drug-related adverse
events. Since the withdrawal of Lotronex, the FDA and GSK have received numerous
emails, letters and telephone calls from patients who related how their IBS symptoms
were not responsive to any therapy other than Lotronex, and how their quality of life was
adversely affected by its withdrawal. FDA has determined that in some patients the
benefits of Lotronex outweigh the risks associated with the use of the drug" (emphasis
added).

Unlike Omontys for the treatment of anemia in patients on dialysis, Lotronex had patients,
physicians and patient advocacy groups all agitating for its re-approval. There were also
"no satisfactory alternative" therapies for a segment of the population suffering from d-IBS.
We have not seen the same constituents advocating for re-approval of Omontys; there are
safe and effective existing therapies for patients on dialysis suffering from anemia. As a
result, we believe it is very unlikely that the FDA re-approves Omontys based on its
rationale for re-approving Lotronex.


An Ominous Sign: Omontys.com is Gone


Lastly, we would like to point out that far from advocating for the return of Omontys,
Takeda's latest action, removing the Omontys.com website, appears to be a sign that it is
simply hoping memory of the drug fades into oblivion. When we attempted to visit
omontys.com on Friday 9/6/13, we were expecting to see the same old website that had
been up since February. Instead, we found that the site was down. When we checked
today, the site was still down. We think that means one thing-Omontys is not coming back.


This is a cached version of the website from 8/26/13, and this is what we had expected to
see:


But instead, we saw this:

We weren't sure if it was just us, or if it was down for everyone, so we checked here:


It wasn't just us.


We thought that maybe the skeleton crew at Affymax forgot to pay their bills for a month,
so we checked the domain registration:

Omontys.com is managed by Takeda, not Affymax. Per the latest AFFY 10-Q, "Takeda
assumed full responsibility for OMONTYS, including the ongoing recall and investigation
of OMONTYS as well as any subsequent decisions as to whether the product may be
subject to reintroduction…". The website, administered by the company that has sole
discretion over the reintroduction of Omontys, is down. We think that means one thing-
Omontys is not coming back.


CONCLUSION


Tysabri and Lotronex were re-approved by the FDA following recalls for very different
reasons-Tysabri was re-approved due to its efficacy, and Lotronex was re-approved
because there were no satisfactory alternative therapies and patients wanted the drug.
Omontys does not have these characteristics. What we do know about Omontys is that it
is a drug associated with life-threatening risks, with unclear clinical benefits at best, and
there is no publicly available data around risk factors and how to reduce the risk of
occurrences of serious adverse events. We believe these case studies overwhelmingly
show that the most likely outcome is that Omontys never comes back. Finally, it appears
that the website for Omontys (www.omontys.com), administered by Takeda, is down and
has been since at least last week. We think this means one thing-Omontys is not coming
back.
