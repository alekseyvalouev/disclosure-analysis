A Very Detailed Look At Organovo

Investment Overview


Shares of Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) have recently skyrocketed due to
widespread media coverage and an equally widespread misunderstanding of the
company's near term revenue potential. The stock has risen from $2.00 to over $13.00 in
the past 12 months and is now valued at over $1 billion. To date Organovo has generated
no real commercial revenues, but has brought in small amounts of money from grants and
collaborations. The company hopes to launch its first commercial product, a 3D liver
assay, in December of 2014, 13 months from now. A launch of any possible next products
has not been announced or discussed, but would likely take several more years for any
visibility. So for now, this one product is all that there is to hope for for the next few years.


In July, Organovo conducted an equity offering at $4.50 per share. As a result, the
company now has a cash balance of approx. 58 cents per share. Aside from the recently
raised cash balance, the sum total of all of Organovo's other assets is just $1 million.


On October 22nd, Organovo Holdings announced that it had presented data
demonstrating retention of key liver functions in bio printed tissues for up to 40 days. In
response to this, the share price rose modestly from around $6.50 to as high as $7.50
before retreating back below $7.00 once again. The news was out and the stock remained
flat for around two weeks. This is clearly not what caused the stock to soar recently.


Starting on November 6th, about two weeks after the announcement, the stock began to
take off. Most of this was due to a rapid fire series of bullish articles on the Motley Fool
and Seeking Alpha which often came out on nearly every other trading day since the
announcement. Many authors and investors have suggested that Organovo may be on
the verge of a massive revenue opportunity of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars
in the near term.


During this brief time, the share price has nearly doubled, hitting a new lifetime high of
$13.65. The company has nearly 90 million shares fully diluted such that it has now
exceeded $1 billion in market cap. It should be noted that there has been no other news
whatsoever from the company, only from bullish authors. Readers should also make note

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 2/106


of the tremendous surge in volume which has occurred on no substantial news. The point
here is that this spike was not driven in any way by the only significant
announcement made by Organovo back in October.


Authors who suggest that Organovo is set to begin pulling in tens or hundreds of millions
of dollars from sales of liver toxicology assays starting in December 2014 clearly do not
understand this product or the market for it.


By now it is well known that drug companies risk losing billions of dollars when one of their
drugs enters and then fails clinical trials. Liver toxicity is one of the most common reasons
for a drug to fail. As a result, many of these authors have simply created a leap of logic
that if the drug companies stand to lose billions, then Organovo must stand to make a
fortune by introducing another diagnostic test for them. This isn't how it works at all.


It is clearly the case that much of the overwhelmingly retail shareholder base simply does
not understand the market for 3D liver toxicology assays. What they clearly don't realize is
that there are already competing 3D liver assays on the market right now, and sold in the
US, which sell for as little as $1,750 per 96 well tray. Yes, these are 3D bio printed liver
toxicology assays, which serve the same function as what Organovo hopes to offer. But
Organovo won't even begin for at least another 13 months from now. Retail investors are
not aware of competing 3D bio printing companies because many of these companies are
not public companies and/or are not US companies. Multiple examples of competing
companies in the 3D bio printing space are shown below. Yet because they are not public
they have not enjoyed almost daily bullish articles from places such as the Motley Fool.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 3/106


It is clearly shown below that Organovo's total revenue potential from 3D liver assays for
Organovo amounts to just $3-5 million cumulatively from 2014 through all of 2016. This is
because the total market size for 3D liver assays is limited to a few thousand units at
most. By 2020, other product offerings (such as kidney assays) may eventually emerge,
but so far there is still nothing definitive from the company at all. It should be kept in mind
that Organovo has possessed its current technology since 2009, and developing this first
product has taken 5 years. So investors should understand that the wait time until we see
second product may also be a few more years.


Some of the confusion likely stems from the Organovo presentation which cites a $500
million market opportunity for cell assay products by 2018. The data came from "Scientia
Advisors". Investors need to understand two things. First, this market opportunity applies
to an extremely wide variety of assays to be used across the market for a wide variety of
uses. It will also be served by many competitors, not just by Organovo. Right now
Organovo has in development just a single assay product to fit into this entire market,
such that the size of the overall market has very little to do with Organovo's financials over
the next 5 years. Second, investors should be aware that the Scientia data was part of a
"sponsored" study in which Organovo hired and paid the firm to produce these estimates


It should also be kept in mind that any revenue in the near term assumes that Organovo is
successful in developing the product and that it is launched on time in December of 2014.
Investors still bear the risk that the product either doesn't work as well as planned or is
delayed beyond December 2014. For now, we can give Organovo the benefit of the doubt
and assume the best for this project. But investors must absolutely realize that the very
best case, assuming success, is for a just few million in revenues (NOT a few hundred
million). This will be clearly demonstrated below.


Just two weeks ago, prior to a surge in high publicity articles, the stock was sitting flat
below $7.00. As the share price has risen due to over a dozen recent articles,
management has been selling hundreds of thousands of shares in October and November
and has filed a massive S8 registration statement by which they can now issue to
themselves over 11 million new shares. This represents nearly 13% of the company in
new shares, and would be valued at over $130 million, just for the personal benefit of a
small group of insiders. (Editors' note: The company has stated that 5 million shares were
registered in the latest S8, which brought the total shares under the 2012 plan to 11.6
million.)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 4/106


As should likely be expected, these insider sales and the large S8 equity registration
statement escaped the attention of many investors because they have been consistently
filed by Organovo management with the SEC on Fridays, and notably after the market
was closed. As anyone would expect from this, most investors were quite obviously not
even looking at their screen on a Friday at 5 pm. The most recent set of management
stock sales came again last week. The SEC filings were released again on Friday. And
again it was well after market hours when no one was looking. Links to these filings have
been included.


As investors come to realize that Organovo currently has only a few million dollars in
cumulative revenue potential over the next 3-5 years, it becomes very difficult to justify the
lofty $1 billion valuation. These realistic revenue numbers are a dramatic variance from
investors' mistaken expectations of hundreds of millions of dollars. The biggest near term
catalyst for a sharp decline is the ongoing insider sales the huge equity registration by
management and the sudden realization that revenue potential is minimal.


Investors should therefore expect the share price to quickly return to below $7.00,
where it was prior to over a dozen promotional articles on Organovo released in the
past few weeks. As recently as November 5th, Organovo had traded as low as
$6.61.


Important Note: The market data with respect to pricing and volumes of 3D liver assays
should be seen as highly verifiable. This is how investors should estimate future revenue
prospects. Links are included so that they can be verified by anyone. For investors who
wish to conduct their own checks, I strongly encourage them to ask Organovo
management directly about expected prices and volumes. Management can be reached at
IR@organovo.com. Alternatively, investors can ask other 3rd party sources such as Zacks
analyst Jason Napodano who has covered the stock or companies such as Insphero
(shown below) which already sell 3D bio printed liver assays. These sources will yield
estimates that should all be very much in line with the ones I present below.


Background Information


Organovo is a stock which lends itself to significant misunderstandings by the market. It
also lends itself to over promotion and manipulation. Despite all of the mainstream
enthusiasm for 3D printing and bio printing, Organovo has just 7% institutional holdings -
93% of the stock is held in retail hands. Stocks such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) are
held in the majority by institutions.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 5/106


Organovo has just one analyst who has covered it, Jason Napodano from Zacks.
However, Mr. Napodano has recently dropped coverage of Organovo due to the valuation.
On the Twitter page for TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein, a series of tweets and retweets
between Feuerstein and Napodano now suggests that "At this price, I think $ONVO could
be as much as 500% over-valued."


When a stock is only owned by retail investors and there is limited research coverage, it is
very easy for the stock price to be heavily influenced by articles in the media. This is
especially true when the articles come in rapid succession almost every day. Of course,
investors need to be aware that many of these very bullish articles come from those who
happen to own the stock and would like to see it go up.


In arriving at my revenue projections, I conducted simple market analysis and identified
competing 3D liver assays which are already being sold on the market. The price for these
3D liver assays is readily obtainable. It is also easy to estimate the number of units that
might be sold in a year. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are around 500 new drugs
which enter phase 1 testing each year. Organovo might hope to gain a significant share of
these. They might also hope to gain a share of roughly 1,000-2,000 other compounds that
could be tested each year. Each 3D liver assay tray contains 96 wells which can be used
to conduct independent tests. As a result, for any given drug, a single tray should be more
than ample. Based on this, if Organovo was extremely successful and immediately
captured significant market share, it might end up selling as many as 1,000 total units of
these 3D liver assays in a year. As a result, we come up with a number of roughly $2
million per year in revenue to Organovo. But this is beginning in 2015 after the product is
launched in December of 2014. For the year 2014, investors should remember that
product revenue should be close to zero.


That is a very simple method of market analysis that helps us approximate total revenues
for Organovo. It is not going to be precise down to the dollar, but it shows clearly shows
the following:


There is precisely zero chance of Organovo reaping hundreds (or even tens) of
millions of dollars in revenues over the next 3-5 years. Organovo management
certainly can have no such expectations. Only the retail investors do as a result of a
recent string of bullish articles. Even if an investor wants to arbitrarily double all of
the assumptions above, it does not even come to $10 million cumulative revenues
for the next 3 years total. Beyond 3 years, we have been given no indication when
additional products will be launched.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 6/106


In arriving at my unit calculations, I first used clinicaltrials.org. I then cross checked my
numbers with those which had been prepared by Zacks, who had consulted directly with
Organovo management when making their revenue estimates. As a final check, I spoke
directly with Swiss company Insphero which already sells these 3D bio printed liver
assays for drug toxicology. The results are all quite consistent at a maximum of a few
thousand units per year for the total market size. Insphero is the company that sells these
3D bio printed liver toxicology assays for $1,750. More details are included below.


The market for 3D liver assays is simply not a large one, the prices are not very high, and
there are already other competitive products actively selling in the market. Those who
have projected hundreds of millions in sales have simply failed to look at the market for
this product. Instead they simply (and falsely) assume that any product being sold to big
pharma must automatically generate hundreds of millions of dollars.


It should come as no coincidence that my estimates above are very closely in line with the
estimates of Zacks' research in their detailed initiation report on the company. On Page 16
of the report Zacks shows clearly that the company is expected to generate revenues of
$0.5 million in 2014 and then $2.0 million in 2015, going to as high as $4 million for all of
2016. Zacks used a different method than I did in arriving at these estimates: they
interacted directly with management in putting revenue estimates together.


I contacted Zacks analyst Jason Napodano a few days ago to see if these revenue
estimates were still valid or if anything had changed. He noted that his revenue estimates
are still valid for upcoming years. Nothing has changed. Mr. Napodano has written on
Organovo on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS and has been consistently positive on the
company and on their technology and prospects. But because he has a much clearer
picture of the realistic revenue potential over the next 3-5 years, he last maintained a
$5.00 share price target for the share price. His last coverage was updated just 12 weeks
ago.


But now we can see from the Zacks' website that the company is no longer providing
updates on Organovo. When I wrote to Mr. Napodano about this, he stated "I dropped
coverage given the exorbitantly high valuation. Can no longer recommend people own it."


A price between $5.00 and $7.00 is certainly where Organovo should be expected to trade
in the near term. This is where it was just 2-3 weeks ago. This is well below the current
levels and certainly below the lofty levels expected by those who have inaccurately
suggested hundreds of millions in revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 7/106


We can contrast the market research approach to numerous other articles which have
appeared in the press in recent weeks. On Friday, one Seeking Alpha author applied
simple random guesswork in trying to calculate revenue potential stating:


We don't how long it will take ONVO to reach $100 mill. to $200 mill. revenue, that
might better support current prices, as there is not enough guidance from the
company to make those projections. But a reasonable guess of going from $0 to
$100 or $200 would be at least three years, which would put is in the FY 2017-18
timeframe as being the earliest when we would expect annual revenues to reach
that level.


In fact, there are actually plenty of data points to help quantify just how much revenue
Organovo can expect from its only product (3D liver assays) over the next 3-5 years.


This author demonstrated no research into the market and simply stated that by 2018
Organovo might be raking in as much as $200 million. This is a staggering amount of
revenue and is in no way supported by anything that Organovo currently has in the works
or has even envisioned in the near future.


(Perhaps by coincidence, when this article was released trading 3 days ago, CEO Keith
Murphy filed to note that he had just sold another 100,000 shares. His filing to notify
investors came after the close of the market on a Friday, so many investors might be
expected to have missed this.)


Similar revenue projections in multiple other articles are the sole reason why the share
price has doubled in the space of two weeks to its current billion dollar valuation. They
have truly lit a fire under retail investors which then sparked momentum traders to pile in.
But these types of projections for the next 3-5 years are entirely without foundation. They
are wrong. When the momentum traders take the reverse direction on the stock, a
significant correction should be expected. Momentum traders by definition do not even
care what a company does. They only care about the near term direction of the stock.
Momentum traders tend to pile in in force and amplify movements to the upside as well as
to the downside. Yet they are "direction agnostic" and are just as happy to profit from a
stock on the way down.


Over a ten year time frame, Organovo can be expected to attempt to develop other
revenue streams such as assays based on other organs like the kidney. But these are
years away and we do not have any visibility on when they might be launched. Organovo
has possessed its current technology since 2009 and the first commercial product, the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 8/106


liver assay, will not be launched until 5 years after that time. In the more distant future, the
real excitement for the company is the potential to develop fully functioning replacement
organs for transplants. But this is even further away and has no impact on the current
share price.


At present, the reality for all investors is that Organovo is only capable of
producing liver tissues that are just 1 millimeter thick and which can be sold in
trays for less than $2,000. Even this will not become a reality for another 13 months,
and then only if all goes as planned. The notion that Organovo will reap hundreds
of millions in revenues at any time in the foreseeable future is pure fiction.


There is already significant competition in the 3D bio printing space


Organovo is the only publicly traded company that is solely focused on 3D bio printing.
This has led many investors to believe that it is the only company engaged in this
business at all. This is completely mistaken.


Below I will list a quick 7 notably obvious direct and indirect competitors within the 3D bio
printing space. Like Organovo, these companies are all involved in the printing of cell
matter such as organ tissues using 3D bio printing technology. But readers should note
that beyond these 7, there are many, many more for those who care to search around. As
with Organovo, many of these companies have their roots within some of the world's most
prestigious universities and research institutes. (Organovo's origins came from the
University of Missouri). These various competitors are active in the US, Europe and in
China. Some of them already are commercializing products well ahead of Organovo.


For example Swiss company Insphero sells 3D liver assays for drug toxicology and has
partnered Cyprotex. A spin-off company of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) Zurich and the University Zurich, InSphero was founded in 2009 by Dr. Jan
Lichtenberg, Dr. Jens M. Kelm and Dr. Wolfgang Moritz. On the Insphero website, these
are very clearly marked as liver assays for toxicology. These serve the identical purpose
that Organovo hopes to serve 13 months from now. But for Insphero they are already on
the market. The price comes in at just around $1,750 for each 96 well tray. Different tests
can be run independently in each well, such that one tray is sufficient for 96 different
outcomes. This means that one tray should be largely adequate to get test results for a
single drug. Product inquiries for US sales can be direct to sales@insphero.com or via
their US sales number at +1 207 751-4908.


Insphero describes its current operations as shown below. This should look familiar to
Organovo investors, except that Insphero has already been selling its product since 2012.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 9/106


InSphero is a leading supplier of organotypic, biological in vitro 3D microtissues for
highly predictive drug testing. The company, headquartered in Zurich,
Switzerland, currently counts 7 of the top ten global pharmaceutical and
cosmetics companies as customers. InSphero 3D Insight™ Microtissues enable
more biologically relevant in vitro applications in efficacy and toxicology.


I did call Insphero directly and spoke to a sales representative who confirmed that
the market for these 3D liver assays (which have been on the market for over a
year) is only in the thousands of units total. The sales rep noted that in a large spike
before the upcoming holiday season, the company actually shipped nearly 100
units in a week, which was extremely large. I also confirmed that the primary use of
these tests (as with Organovo) is for drug toxicology testing by pharma companies.


Here is a screenshot from their website.


Yet another competitor is the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, run by Dr.
Tony Atala. Their business should sound very familiar to those who follow Organovo. As
noted in livescience.com.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 10/106


Atala's group has pioneered 3D printing methods that aim to build human organs
with layer upon layer of cells. Their bioprinting methods lay down the cell layers
along with artificial scaffolding to keep an organ's structure intact as it takes shape -
a technique that has allowed the group to make tiny, less complex versions of full-
size human organs. "We're printing miniature solid organs: miniature livers,
hearts, lungs and vascular structures (blood vessels)," Atala told LiveScience.


Wake Forest is far enough along in its development of that it has already been selected by
the DoD to lead the following programs, as noted.


The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is leading the $24-million effort
funded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), on
behalf of Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).


And then of course there is New Jersey based Hurel Corp. which develops and
commercializes similar 3D bio printed products. Hurel was a spin out from Schering
Plough (now Merck) labs from 2007. The company is now backed by Sanofi. According to
MedCityNews,


It [Hurel] has raised $9.2 million in a Series A round for its lead product - a
technology that replicates the human liver, using living cells, and referred to as
organ-on-a-chip or human-on-a-chip.


Hopefully this also sounds very familiar to investors in Organovo, because this is in line
with what Organovo hopes to launch in 13 months or so.


Beyond just livers, there are also other 3D bio printing companies focused on different
tissues. Texas based TeVido Bio Devices is focused on developing 3D bio breast tissues
for breast cancer victims. This is similar to the larger and longer term ambitions that
Organovo has for fully useable tissues. They have already stated that they expect that it
will take 7 years and at least $40 million in order to get to the beginning of clinical trials.
Companies such as TeVido and Organovo can therefore expect a long and expensive slog
before they are even able to contemplate the beginning of FDA trials on such products.


But competition for developing 3D tissues and assays is not just limited to Europe and the
US. It has become an explosive business in China. Already the HangZhou University of
Electronic Science and Technology is printing 3D bio printed body parts. Likewise a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 11/106


company called Unique Technology based in QingDao has already supplied its 3D bio
printers to dozens of universities across China.


There is also competition emerging offering to provide 3D bio printers more broadly to
other organizations. Germany based envisontec already commercially sells a 3D bio
plotter which can be viewed here.


For those who wish to look further, there are dozens more institutions and organizations
which are actively involved in 3D bio printing. For those who are interested in seeing many
more, I included a short list of the 3D bio printing partners who work with Insphero as
Appendix II.


The first issue here is that there are numerous other 3D bio printing entities aside
from Organovo and that some of them are clearly further along than Organovo.


But the more important issue is that these dozens of other 3D bio printing entities
do NOT get the benefit of daily hype articles from sources such as the Motley Fool.
This is simply because they are not publicly traded and no one (i.e. motivated
shareholders) benefits in the short term from giving them excessive hype and
sensationalism. It is very important for investors to realize that speculative
companies with tradeable stocks get far more attention than their private
counterparts simply because traders want to profit from stock moves.


Looking more closely at the 3D liver assay product


The low price of the 3D liver toxicology assay should not come as a surprise to anyone
who knows pharma testing. 3D liver assays will not fully replace traditional testing
methods anytime soon. The pharma companies will still conduct first line animal testing,
and will then proceed on 2D liver tissue samples and then conduct the 3D test last.


The concept of a "3D bio printed liver toxicology assay" sounds very exotic (and
presumably expensive) to many retail investors, but in fact it is just another fairly simple
diagnostic test for pharma companies. Many investors might not realize that the thickness
of these "3D" samples is in fact just a mere 1 millimeter. It hardly appears to be "3D" at all,
but it does in fact meet that definition from a technical perspective.


At present the biggest technical challenge is in creating the vascular structures for
delivering blood that is necessary to support thicker structures, so 0.5-1.0 millimeters is
the current limit for thickness of these tissues. We could certainly print thicker samples

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 12/106


with a bio printer. This is physically achievable. But they would quickly die for lack of blood
flow. At less than 1 millimeter the blood circulates by simple diffusion such that vascular
structures are not necessary.


According to Organovo CEO Keith Murphy,


Murphy cautions. "Our ability to make tissue thicker than about one millimeter is
restricted by our ability to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the cells. Today, nobody
can integrate the small vessels and capillaries needed for thicker tissue. Therefore,
we're not making whole organs," he stresses, although doing so may become
possible eventually.


This reality may come as a shock for those who envision Organovo as a company which
prints large and thick human organs using a 3D bio printer. Many are not aware of the 1
millimeter limitation. The reality is that even getting to just one millimeter in thickness has
been a massive challenge and accomplishment.


The real point is that for pharma companies this is just another simple 1 millimeter liver
diagnostic which will hopefully offer additional predictive value prior to determining
whether or not to go into clinical trials. And we can see that the cost of these tests is
around $2,000 or less for a 96 well tray which gives the ability to conduct 96 individual
tests. Interested readers should feel free to verify these numbers with Organovo
management, with companies such as Insphero or with analysts such as Jason Napodano
or other 3rd party sources.


It all comes down to Intellectual Property ("IP")


The reason that there are so many competitors in the US, Europe and China is that there
are still tremendous amounts of IP which are available through hundreds of universities
which have been focused on 3D bio printing for as long as a decade. There are many
ways to achieve similar ends and 3D bio printing is still in its infancy. As a result, patenting
one's own process certainly does not prevent others from obtaining their desired
outcomes through slightly different means.


The technology being used by ONVO was licensed from the University of Missouri in 2009
for just $25,000 along with 1-3% of future revenues, if any. In 2010, the company entered
into further licensing agreements for additional technology for just $5,000 plus
reimbursement of patent costs. In 2011, ONVO entered into similar licensing agreements
with Clemsen University for a total of $32,500 plus an additional $32,500 in patent costs.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 13/106


As of 2013, the value of all of ONVO's non cash assets (i.e. all of its intellectual property)
was valued at less than $900,000. This should not be surprising when one realizes that
the only product currently on the horizon is the drug toxicology liver assay which
commands a low price of less than $2,000 and a small market size of perhaps 1,000 units
per year.


In the meantime, ONVO only spends a mere $1 million per quarter in R&D expenditures.


Significant transformation in the world of technology and biotech is tremendously
expensive. This holds true without exception. For example 3D systems still spends over
$10 million per quarter on R&D even though its technology seems to be at a more mature
state. And in developing an electric car that will actually sell, Tesla Motors
(NASDAQ:TSLA) spends over $50 million per quarter!


By contrast, Organovo spends around $1 million per quarter and its total IP (which it
purchased) is valued at well under $1 million.


The one thing that Organovo has done quite successfully is to raise over $60 million from
investors due to the strong share price. Yet much of the share price strength has resulted
from hyper bullish articles from authors who engaged in pure speculation about bio printed
full organs and other outcomes which are clearly decades in the future. Despite all of the
hype and the soaring share price, the stock continues to be held 93% by retail investors
and has attracted no mainstream Wall Street research coverage. In fact, the heaviest
source of promotion for Organovo is via the presentations at
RetailInvestorConferences.com. This should be seen as highly unusual even for
companies with market caps even as small as $200-300 million, and certainly unusual for
a company which has now surged to over $1 billion.


The point from this is that there is a very clear reason why Organovo has attracted no
institutional or research interest. Organovo bought some very inexpensive IP 5 years ago.
The company spends very little on R&D and its only near term product offering is for a
simple diagnostic which is already on the market from other competitors. Meanwhile,
Organovo has heavily targeted retail investors and has been able to use that hype to raise
around $60 million over two years from stock sales.


What are the insiders doing?


Looking at the insider behavior at Organovo is very interesting.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 14/106


Over the past few weeks (and as the share price was soaring due to articles), CEO Keith
Murphy has sold 200,000 shares of stock, bringing him in nearly $2 million. On each case
his SEC filings were stealthily submitted after the market close and on a Friday, such that
many investors may not have seen this at all.


Chief Strategy Officer David Eric has also sold nearly 100,000 shares.


CTO Sharon Presnell recently sold 75,000 shares, and sold an additional 75,000 shares in
August.


Of greater concern is the fact that on November 8th, Organovo filed a massive S8
registration statement which now covers 11 million shares to be issued to management.
This represents nearly 13% of the company and would be valued at well over $100 million
for this small group of individuals. S8 filings are often sources of concern for investors
because they basically allow management to issue large amounts of stock to themselves
or their "consultants" for any reason. The filings can be done on very short notice. S8
filings were much abused vehicles by Chinese reverse merger companies during the wave
of fraud that hit these companies in 2010-2011. They used these S8s to issue large
amounts of stock to themselves and their cohorts and then quickly sold the stock at highly
inflated prices. S8s were largely how many of the Chinese fraudsters made themselves
rich. This does not mean that all S8s are bad. It just means that it is an easy way for
insiders to award themselves tremendous amounts of stock on very short notice. Investors
should rightfully view large S8s with skepticism.


And by the way, this recent S8 registration statement by Organovo was again stealthily
filed by management on a Friday (Nov 8th), well after the close of the markets such that
most investors did not even see it. The filing of this massive S8 fortuitously coincided with
the recent ramp of the stock following a string of bullish articles.


The point from this is that management can feel free to sell as many of their current
shares as they wish, because they know that they can simply issue themselves another 11
million more.


Going back further, we can see other interesting insider activity.


As of the initial public offering in 2012, company founder Dr. Gabor Forgacs owned 13.9%
of the company. As an owner of more than 10% of the company, he would have been
required to report any sales of his stock.



http://www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.xD9Ae.htm#1stPage

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 15/106


Also at that time, his son Andras Forgacs held 1.8% of the company and was also a
director. This is below the 10% threshold, but as a director he would still have to report
any share sales.


By December 2012, Dr. Gabor Forgacs had reduced his stake to 12%. But by April of
2013, he had reduced it to 9.7%, beneath the 10% reporting threshold. This was just prior
to the uplisting in 2013, when the stock soared for the first time to over $8.00, up from
around $1.00 a year earlier. And by being below the 10% threshold, Dr. Forgacs would not
have to report that he sold his stock. We can see from SEC filings that Dr. Forgacs has not
provided any information about holding any Organovo stock since 2012. Dr. Forgacs
resigned as a director on February 8, 2012 (see page 84 of this SEC filing), on the day
Real Estate Restoration and Rental, Inc. was officially merged into Organovo holdings,
such that this stock sales also would not be reportable. We therefore cannot tell how many
(if any) shares Dr. Forgacs still holds. But the pattern of his actions appears to have been
conducive to being able to sell when he wanted to without having to report the sales which
would alert investors.


Meanwhile, his son Andras resigned from the company in July 2013, also as the stock had
just hit all time highs at the time. This would also allow him to sell his stock without
reporting it. There are also no subsequent updates indicating that Mr. Andras continues to
hold his original position so we really don't know.


The last filings indicating ownership by the Forgacs were in March of 2012.


But perhaps a bigger question for investors is why did the founder and his son
resign from this company at all? If the future is so bright for Organovo, then
presumably these two founding insiders would want to go along for the ride.


A word on Organovo's collaborations


Like many development stage biotech and healthcare companies, Organovo was able to
secure several collaborations with big pharma names. In 2010, they secured a deal with
Pfizer and by 2012 they had delivered constructs to Pfizer for internal evaluation. No
update has been provided since then as we now approach 2014. In 2011, Organovo
entered into a research agreement with United Therapeutics. The agreement had later
been expanded, but it appears that it still expires several months from now. In January of
2013, Organovo entered into a collaboration agreement with the Knight Cancer Institute at
Oregon Health & Science University ("OHSU"), to develop more clinically predictive in
vitro three dimensional cancer models with the goal to advance discovery of novel cancer

therapeutics. However this is purely academic and does not appear to provide any
revenue to Organovo. Additional recent announcements have been made including
Hoffman LaRoche and L'Oreal but no revenue from these has been disclosed either.


These name brand collaborations have added instant credibility and have occasionally
boosted the share price. But the fact remains that in the past these big names have paid
up to have a look at what Organovo has for them, and then they have moved on after
looking.


This should be readily apparent by looking at the amount of collaboration revenue which
has been steadily dwindling each quarter. As of the most recent quarter, Organovo
brought in just $23,000 in collaboration revenue. By contrast, in 2012 the total for the year
was over $1 million.


Learning from the past - have we seen this before?


At the beginning of 2013, Casey Research published an article describing the then-recent
moves in the stock, which were also spectacular. The description provided by Casey is
now about a year old, but should seem oddly familiar to those who have witnessed the
moves of the past few weeks. Investors should read this carefully, keeping in mind that it
describes the effects of a promotion that happened over a year ago!


From Casey Research:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 17/106


ONVO went public at $1.65 per share on February 14, 2012 and experienced some
impressive momentum out of the gate, climbing to $3.01 (an 82% increase) by May
17. That's when things really went crazy. Just one month later [IN JUNE 2012],
ONVO traded as high as $10.90 (a 560% increase from the close on its first trading
day just four months prior) after some of the larger newsletter companies like Motley
Fool wrote numerous positive articles about the company and helped propel it to
a $500-million market cap (despite no change in fundamentals) virtually overnight.


Think about that for a second. ONVO was trading for half a billion dollars despite
generating less than $1 million in revenue during the prior twelve-month period. Yes,
that's a price-to-sales ratio of over 500. And it's not like the forward one- or even
two-year revenue projections were calling for growth that could come close to
justifying that valuation. The numbers just didn't make sense. When investors once
again came to their senses and recognized this reality, the stock fell - hard. By
mid-July 2012, ONVO was once again trading below $2.00 per share. Despite a
brief pop above $3 per share in mid-October, the stock remained flat through mid-
December.


The point from this excerpt is that we have seen the exact same phenomenon again. It is
a series of hyper bullish articles (also coincidently coming primarily from the Motley Fool)
all coming at the same time which sent this stock soaring within 2 weeks and without any
new fundamental developments from the company. Casey makes a good point as well.
Investors shouldn't be looking at the current price to sales ratio, they should be looking at
the 2-3 year forward price to sales ratio. As shown above, revenue for 2015 should not be
much more than $2 million under any circumstances. But now we are at over a $1 billion
market cap such that the forward price to sales ratio is still at least 500 times projected
sales. And even if they grow these sales in 2016, we are still talking about 200-300 times
sales.


Conclusion


There is an old saying that if you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes "the truth". This
does not mean "truth" in the literal sense, instead it just means that the lie becomes
universally accepted.


Lately the headlines have been filled with bullish articles on Organovo which predict
massive near term revenues as a result of providing billion dollar savings to big pharma
companies. Many of these articles have been written by individuals who happen to own
5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 18/106


stock in Organovo and who have certainly derived great benefit from the recent doubling
of the stock in two weeks.


The actual truth is that Organovo hopes to launch a fairly simple 3D liver assay in 13
months from now. It is hoped that this product will offer some incremental benefit above
and beyond animal testing and 2D testing. Existing products are already on the market
and sell for less than $2,000 for a 96 well tray. The total market size for all such liver
assays for all competing suppliers numbers in the mere thousands of units.


As a result, Organovo's revenue potential should be expected to add up to just a few
million dollars over the next few years - certainly NOT hundreds of millions of dollars. And
in fact, NOT even tens of millions.


But the sheer repetition of this misinformation of late has caused Organovo's share price
to double in about 2 weeks, now hitting a $1 billion market cap. The latest surge has been
driven by high volume momentum traders who do not even care what the company does.
These traders are also agnostic about share price direction. They are just as happy to
profit from falling share prices as they are from rising share prices. They can exacerbate
downward moves in the share price just as they have exacerbated the recent upward
moves. As a result, as soon as investors realize the reality of Organovo's actual revenue
potential, the share price should be expected to see dramatic moves lower on very high
volume.


In the meantime, management insiders continue to sell large amounts of stock at current
prices pulling in millions of dollars personally. And now they have registered over 11
million more new shares to give themselves. Organovo as a company will certainly not be
pulling in $100 million in revenue any time soon. The only ones to get this much money
will be Organovo management when they personally award themselves the 11 million
shares of stock under the recently filed S8.


Appendix I - practical considerations for shorting Organovo


Following the dramatic spike in the share price, many investors have lamented to me that
shorting Organovo is often "impossible" due to lack of stock borrow..


A much better alternative is to sell the December call options. When selling options with a
fairly low strike price of $5.00, the performance is basically identical to shorting the stock.
Investors get 1:1 exposure on both the upside and the downside. The only drawback is
that if the share price falls below $5.00, the investor no longer benefits from additional
downside. But the major advantage here is that selling calls does not require the short
5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 19/106


investor to borrow stock, so there is no expensive borrow fee. In reality, selling naked
options like this is often no more risky than shorting common stock. It does require an
additional level of option approval from one's broker, but this is well worth it because this
technique applies to many stocks aside from Organovo.


Another alternative is to buy the "in the money" puts. Many investors shy away from puts
because they are seen as being a very risky "all or none" bet. That certainly applies to "out
of the money" puts. But if the stock price is below $12.50 and the investor buys $12.50
puts, he is already "in the money" and the option will largely perform 1:1 on the way down
just like being short stock. As with selling calls, the short investor does not need to pay the
expensive borrow. However there is typically a moderate premium that must be paid. So if
the stock is at $11.50, the investor might pay $1.50 for the $12.50 put, effectively getting
short at $11.00. Because the stock is at $11.50, the investor has paid a 50 cent premium.
One advantage here vs. being short the stock is that if the share price does rise
dramatically, the investors losses are capped at that $12.50 level. But should the stock fall
back to $8.00, this $1.50 bet pays off $4.50 (a triple). And again, if the stock rises above
$12.50, the investors losses are capped.
