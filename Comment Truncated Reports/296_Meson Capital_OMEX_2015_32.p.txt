Odyssey Marine Exploration Prepares To Exit Core Shipwreck
Business, Cash Burn Continues

Summary


Most recent 10Q filed November 6 had an attachment for a new $2mm "advance"
loan with "In-Kind Satisfaction".


This "In-Kind Satisfaction" transfers the majority of the shipwreck business in
exchange for paying off a fraction of existing company debts.


This appears to be a desperate move to fund the company for perhaps another
couple months of cash burn while giving up almost all upside.


10Q also includes: "Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at September 30,
2015, was $1.8 million, which is insufficient to support operations through the end of
2015.".


Protests in Mexico continue against Don Diego phosphate mining project that would
environmentally impact 15,000 fishermen while creating only 80 jobs.


After the announcement of the MINOSA loan to Odyssey Marine (NASDAQ:OMEX) to
avoid bankruptcy in March 2015, we speculated that the new investors would seek to exit
the shipwreck business. However, CEO Mark Gordon assured investors that the
shipwreck business would continue and provide a solid foundation to enable even grander
speculations by being the first in undersea mining projects. OMEX has repeatedly
reiterated their steady pipeline of commodity shipwrecks as well as rarer but potentially
more valuable historic shipwrecks such as the HMS Victory, which we have not heard an
update on for some time.


What does CEO Mark Gordon say about the shipwreck business?


While collecting his $1.4m+ in annual compensation, OMEX's CEO Marc Gordon has
repeatedly reassured investors they are committed to the shipwreck recovery business
and were in it for the long haul:

"As I stated before, we don't plan to abandon our shipwreck roots and in keeping
with our pledged to bring more financial discipline to our business, we're developing
a potential multi-year shipwreck program utilizing external project level funding that
improves our risks and reward profile, while still allowing our investors to benefit
from our large portfolio of attractive shipwreck projects."


"we have amazing operational capabilities and an extensive portfolio of attractive
mineral and shipwreck projects that we can go prosecute. "


Q1 2015


We're going to continue to do shipwrecks


"I want to be clear that we're not abandoning our shipwreck roots. "


"We plan to focus on projects that will be fruitful for the company and our
shareholders."


Q4 2014


"We found more shipwrecks than any other entity in history and recovered more
valuable goods from shipwrecks than all previous records shipwreck recovery
operations."


"We are not abandoning our shipwreck roots"


"We look forward to fulfilling the commitments made to the Maritime Heritage
Foundation and the U.K. government in regards to the Victory project."


"Unidentified Analyst: Is OMEX exiting the treasure hunting business?"


Mark Gordon - President and CEO


Well, I have to start to answer that question by saying OMEX has never been in the
treasure hunting business. We are in the archaeological sensitive shipwreck
recovery business for historic shipwrecks. And we do plan as I've mentioned
several times to stay in that business, most notably with the HMS Victory project
as our most exciting near-term historic shipwreck to work on.


Q2 2014


"our future shipwreck projects can generate significant cash and profits, not only on
a standalone project basis, but on a recurring annual consolidated company basis."

Now OMEX is backtracking? Desperate exit from ship wreck business is
imminent….


On November 6, OMEX filed its most recent 10Q without hosting a conference call - a first
since our initial report catalyzed quarterly conference calls starting two years ago.


Other than the balance sheet disclosures below - the most interesting highlight of the 10Q
was the loan agreement attached to it. OMEX has fully tapped out its first MINOSA
$14.75mm loan and unless it receives environmental approval by SEMARNAT it cannot
access any more cash from them. So OMEX borrowed another $1mm (with another
$1mm potentially for December 1 which has passed) pursuant to the agreement.


This loan seems to be setting up for an exit from the shipwreck business based on a
reading of the section 6 and the language used: "advance" payment. This appears to
allow OMEX to repay the loan as well as their Fifth Third Bank debt ($3mm for SS
Republic coins and $7mm for the SS Central America - assumed by [***] below) in
exchange for a list of assets that include the assets secured by the Bank loan plus
Neptune Minerals shares and receivables.


Basically OMEX appears to be giving away any upside potential from the SS Central
America (which is still tied up in court) in exchange for whatever proceeds Monaco offers
them. For those out there who speculated the SSCA project could potentially bring in
$40mm (vs the $7mm loan from Fifth Third so far) - this is the moment of truth.

Section 6.1. Right to In-Kind Satisfaction. If, and only if, (A) Monaco delivers a
Second Advance Notice to Odyssey during the Election Period and (B) such Second
Advance Notice states that


that Monaco desires for Odyssey to satisfy the Loan in-kind in accordance with this
Section 6, and (C) all amounts outstanding due from Odyssey to the Bank have
been paid in full (which condition is for the third party benefit of the Bank and may
not be waived by Odyssey or Monaco), then on the In-Kind Payment Date:


subject to Monaco's fulfillment of its obligations under Section 6.1, Odyssey shall
assign, convey, or otherwise transfer to Monaco:


((i)):all of Odyssey's rights under the [***], and other transferable rights, to the extent
assignable, or a beneficial interest therein;


(ii): all the Seated Liberty Half Dollar coins (approximately 19,000 coins) owned by
Odyssey and recovered by Odyssey from the SS Republic shipwreck (the "Republic
Coins");


((iii)): one-half of Odyssey's equity interest in Neptune Minerals(Odyssey's entire
equity interest consists of 6,184,976 of Class B Common non-voting shares and
5,225 Series A Preferred non-voting shares); and


(iv): one-half of the receivables owed to Odyssey by Neptune Minerals, which one-
half equals $2,500,000 plus any accrued interest, along with any rights which attach
to those receivables; and


subject to Odyssey's fulfillment of its obligations under Section 6.1, Monaco shall:
repay or provide for Odyssey's repayment of all indebtedness that is owed to the
Bank.


Fifth Third bank has two loans to OMEX both due December 17, 2015, less than two
weeks away. The maturity date on this new Monaco loan or "advance" payment is
December 18, 2015, so we should see some action soon.

Why is Monaco doing this advance?


The timing of this advance is interesting as without the $1mm on November 1, OMEX
would have likely run out of their $1.8mm cash stores and been forced to potentially
declare bankruptcy by the end of November. Monaco has an unsecured junior promissory
note, which tend to be subordinated to any secured notes (such as Minosa's) in a
bankruptcy process - so Monaco would want to avoid holding that bag in court given they
are owed over $10mm. Legal and administrative fees of a bankruptcy would take priority
and potentially leave the $10mm with a claim on nothing of value at the end.


It seems likely that at a minimum the 20k SS Republic coins and claims on the SS Central
America are worth the $10mm secured bank debt on them. Some have argued that
OMEX's share of the SS Central America claim could be worth $30mm+ (We estimate
closer to max $12mm).

If you believe that these assets have value then Monaco may be trying to grab the
valuable assets it can from OMEX before the ship of a company sinks into potential
bankruptcy and its ability to seize assets become subject to court process and approval. If
the SSCA claim turns out to be worth a substantial amount, Monaco may even make a
profit out of this whole endeavor.


The problem with this approach is that if indeed OMEX does file bankruptcy then a
transfer of valuable assets shortly before to a junior creditor (and Monaco's loans are
more junior than the Minosa loan) may be considered fraudulent conveyance to the
bankruptcy court and a violation of the waterfall priority to the bankruptcy process and
may be able to be reversed by the court. To be clear, there is nothing illegal per se about
this tactical approach, indeed it is common in the world of savvy distressed lenders.


Is Monaco now playing Pirate to OMEX's sinking ship, grabbing the coins before the ship
goes to the distant depths of the bankruptcy process? Was this their plan all along?


OMEX balance sheet update:


OMEX recently shared their own views on the viability of their company in the latest 10q
and it does not look good - as OMEX's 10Q says:


"Our consolidated non-restricted cash balance at September 30, 2015 was $1.8
million which is insufficient to support operations through the end of 2015"


I have shared my updated "OMEX (in)solvency" model below to show why OMEX includes
this disclosure. As you can see, OMEX continues their dangerous dance with near term
bankruptcy. I estimate OMEX monthly cash burn is approximately $1.5m. How will OMEX
get yet another cash infusion if it has no more assets to borrow against?

How will they have enough cash to pay off the other $10mm Monaco debt due in
approximately 6 months or the Minosa $14.75mm debt due March 30, 2016? Even if
Minosa chose to exercise their $40mm option to buy all OMEX's Oceanica/Don Diego
stake that would leave OMEX with virtually zero assets and little cash. Given OMEX's
precarious financial condition I do not see how OMEX will be able to avoid being forced
out of the shipwreck business as Monaco holds all the negotiating power at this table.


Despite all of this horrific information, somehow OMEX still today trades at $0.30 per
share which implies an enterprise value of nearly $80mm!


Is there really nothing else better investors could buy for $80mm?


Protests continue for Don Diego, while everything hinges on unprecedented
environmental approval

According to local news sources, including Excelsior and BCS Noticias, Don Diego does
not have the Governor of Baja, Mendoza Davis's support. The reason OMEX gave for
withdrawing the EIA the last time earlier this year was that they were waiting for a new
government to be in place that would be more supportive. Mendoza Davis was elected
and assumed office September 2015 so this strategy does not appear to be working for
OMEX. We still expect the unprecedented "Don Diego" project to be either outright denied
(as appeared to occur with SEMARNAT June 22 this year when OMEX withdrew the EIA
immediately before the ruling deadline) or postponed endlessly until OMEX runs out of
cash and either gives up or goes bankrupt.


Is OMEX trying to shift its business model into a pure-play undersea mining
speculation like their investment in Chatham Rock Phosphate (CRP.NZ)?


Stay tuned - there is sure to be news and positive spin from OMEX on how this desperate
and forced exit from the shipwreck business is actually a great positive step! OMEX
management continues to collect their plump compensation packages while cash burn
continues and OMEX has not articulated any clear pathway to profitability.


Given that OMEX shareholders own the stock for the shipwreck story and excitement I do
not expect they will receive the news well of OMEX's forced exit from this line of business
of gold coins at $4000 an oz to the decidedly less glamorous world of mining phosphate at
~$100 per ton.


Fool me once, shame on you


Fool me twice, shame on me


Disclosure: I am/we are short OMEX.
