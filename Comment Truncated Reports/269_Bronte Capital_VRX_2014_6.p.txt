Valeant Part XIII: channeling Jeff Skilling - or trying to
reconstruct Valeant's balance sheet
There was a very famous conference call once where Highfields Capital analyst Richard Grubman
asked for a balance sheet with Enron's earnings statement. Jeff Skilling's response is a key part of the
Enron legend. 


Grubman: You’re the only financial institution that can’t produce a balance sheet
or cash flow statement with their earnings. 


Skilling: You…you…you. Well, uh…thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Asshole.


The "asshole" quip disappeared from the conference call transcript but everyone remembered it. 
 
Well today Valeant produced a earnings result with only cursory balance sheet data and no balance
sheet. Linked here is the SEC release.  And here is all they say about balance sheet.

Net debt thus dropped $1327 million in the quarter. That looks pretty good. 
 
Except that they sold the Aesthetics business during the quarter. 
 
Slide 165 of this presentation (reproduced below) indicates net proceeds of $1240 million. 
 
Net of this they generated only $88 million of cash in the quarter. 
 
Which given they had $2 billion of sales and everyone thinks their cash margin is about 50 percent
does not seem to compute. 
 


 
 
 
We could of course work it out with a balance sheet and cash flow statement. It is probably all sweet
and innocent. 
 
So at the risk of being called an "asshole" please Mr Pearson will you give me a balance sheet and a
cash flow statement with your earnings?
