China Sky’s Promote of PriceWaterhouse in
Earnings Release Belies Internal Controls Claim


Posted on August 14, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) released second


quarter earnings today. The earnings release, which raises a series


of questions that are addressed in a separate report, makes two


references to CSKI’s purported engagement of


PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) as a consultant on “financial


reporting and control.” PWC is not CSKI’s auditor, but their


consultation has apparently neglected to rectify a very basic


problem: the suspension of CSKI’s main “holding” subsidiary from


doing business in California, the state in which it is incorporated.


The principal subsidiary of CSKI is a corporation called American


California Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. (“ACPG”) that has been


suspended by the California Secretary of State, according to public


records. China Sky’s 2008 Form 10-K refers to ACPG as a “holding


company subsidiary.” California corporate records show that ACPG


has been suspended since November 29, 2007. Click here and here

information statement with the California Secretary of State, or for


not filing an annual tax return with state offices.


The direct implications of ACPG’s corporate suspension for CSKI’s


public listing or business operations are not clear. However, the


suspension shows another instance of CSKI’s problems in corporate


controls and governance, and inadequate disclosures to


shareholders.


The California records also list the president of ACPG as Qiaomin


Hu and the registered agent as Lynn Chao. CSKI’s 2008 10-K states


that CSKI’s officers Liu Yan-Qing and Han Xiao-yan “also serve as
