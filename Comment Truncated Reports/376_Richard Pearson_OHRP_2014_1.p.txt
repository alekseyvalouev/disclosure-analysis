The Ugly Truth Behind Ohr Pharma
Jul. 1, 2014 10:00 AM ET76 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


A recent report from Vista Partners sent OHRP soaring by 60%. The contents,
including a $31 price target, was provided and paid for by Ohr management.


Ohr stock had just collapsed to as low as $6.86 due to a recent failure of its drug in
clinical trials.


Squalamine was previously owned by Genaera Pharma. The drug had already failed
following clinical trials such that Genaera sold it to Ohr for less than $100,000.


Recent encouraging results from Ohr were actually reported by Genaera as early as
2003, but the drug was still discarded as unviable.


Investors should expect to see shares of Ohr return to $5.00 or below. Ohr is a truly
compelling short and has liquid options.


Background


Over the weekend, physician Michael Sacerdote penned an article discussing Ohr
Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:OHRP), which was quite thorough and scientifically rigorous.
He posted three major conclusions:


First, despite the apparent clinical efficacy of squalamine, the drug would be a commercial
failure because it does not reduce the need for overall injections into the eye.


Second, with any possible approval being at least 4 years away, the drug will be too far
behind rival Opthotech's competing drug, Fovista. This again will result in commercial
failure.


Third, the value of squalamine is zero.


Dr. Sacerdote is a physician and his scientific analysis reflects that. However, I do believe
that the doctor has missed the much larger point with Ohr and squalamine.


In fact, this drug never had a real shot at success in the first place. The information
gleaned from recent Phase 2 trials has been known for more than 10 years. Yet the drug
was already determined to be commercially unviable and was effectively discarded by its

previous owner for de minimis proceeds.


Most importantly, the recent surge in the stock has simply been the result of a stock
promotion provided and paid for by Ohr management. It has nothing to do with the
prospects for squalamine and everything to do with management's desire to issue more
stock in equity offerings going forward. Ohr currently has a market cap of $250 million and
less than $20 million in cash, with no near-term drug prospects.


Recent developments


Shares of Ohr Pharma have been extremely volatile lately. The stock is held
overwhelmingly by retail investors who can be easily influenced by small amounts of
publicity, even when the underlying data is clearly not well understood.


On June 23rd, shares of Ohr rose by 16% due to the following announcement:


Ohr Pharmaceutical Announces Positive Interim Top-Line Clinical Results From Phase II
Study of Squalamine Eye Drops in Patients With Wet AMD


Clearly, the headline was very positive. And the contents within the press release were
also very positive.


But the devil was in the details.


In fact, buried deep within the press release was the fact that squalamine actually missed
its primary endpoint. The goal of the entire study was to reduce the frequency of Lucentis
injections and this did not happen. The drug failed its objective. Period.


But given the incredibly positive spin, it was not at all surprising that retail investors bid the
stock up. It was also not surprising that self-appointed biotech vigilante Adam Feuerstein
was quick to cry foul.


One day later, Feuerstein pointed out the fact that the drug had actually failed. He also
called management to task for the incredibly deceptive press release. Within two days,
shares of Ohr were down by as much as 40%, briefly hitting $6.86, down from $11.40 post
press release.


Yet within two more days, shares of Ohr were again up by as much as 60% from those
lows, briefly hitting $10.97 again. The main contributor to this surge was an "upgrade" by
Vista Partners, which placed a new $31 price target on the stock.

Lest anyone miss their upgrade, Vista even put out a press release to trumpet it and
included the key reasons for why Ohr should be a $31 stock.


Vista Partners Updates Coverage on Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NASDAQ: OHRP); Raises
Price Target to $31


The bullish upgrade and the soaring share price were then further amplified by media
sources such as Benzinga and TheStreet.com.


But there is one major problem here. The report issued by Vista (including the $31 target)
was fully bought and paid for by Ohr management.


This fact was not disclosed in the press release by Vista and was therefore missed by
both Benzinga and TheStreet.com (as well as other market sources). It was also clearly
unknown to the retail investor base and it appears that very few people appear to have
read the actual report from Vista Partners.


For those who wish to read the actual Vista report, I have included a pdf copy at
moxreports.com.


But it gets worse.


Buried deep on page 10 of the report, and in much tinier font, is the disclosure from Vista
that (emphasis added):


This report has been prepared by Vista Partners LLC ("Vista") with the assistance


OHR Pharmaceutical, Inc. ("the Company") based upon information provided by
the Company. Vista has not independently verified such information, and in
addition, Vista has been compensated by the Company for advisory services for a
one year period. Vista and its officers may have an equity interest - both restricted
and unrestricted in the securities mentioned herein.


The key points to understand are as follows:


1. The information in the Vista report was provided solely by Ohr management
itself


2. Vista then does not even bother to verify any information
3. Ohr pays Vista for "advisory services" which includes putting out reports like


this one.

The report from Vista is nothing more than a late night infomercial provided by Ohr
management, yet it caused the share price to soar by 60% in two days.


It is very clear from the share price reaction that the heavy retail base of investors in Ohr
did not even bother to read this report. If any of them did, they certainly did not find the
tiny disclosure buried on page 10. Certainly, Benzinga and TheStreet.com missed this.


So Strike One for Ohr is the misleading press release on June 23rd, which painted a failed
clinical trial in a stunningly positive light.


Strike Two is the use of a paid stock pump to further elevate its shares using a $31 share
price target and a firm, which doesn't even bother to verify the information provided solely
by Ohr.


Looking at the history of Ohr will reveal Strike Three.


It is the fact that squalamine largely never stood a chance at getting approved or of
achieving commercial success in the first place. The drug was purchased for next to
nothing after it had already failed to prove itself viable in clinical trials. It was largely just an
excuse for Ohr to run a stock promotion with the goal of issuing stock to raise tens of
millions of dollars.


The history of Ohr Pharma


Ohr Pharma was created in a simple reverse merger transaction in 2009, which was
arranged by financier Orin Hirschman. Mr. Hirschman then appointed his father Shalom
Hirschman to act as a consultant to oversee the purchases of various small and
inexpensive pharma assets. By this time, the father had already sold to the corporate
entity several "pre-clinical" drug assets in exchange for warrants on 5 million shares with a
strike price of just 50 cents. Not a bad deal for mere "pre clinical assets." The son already
owned 18.9% of the public company by virtue of having arranged the reverse merger.


The company then appointed fellow financier Andrew Limpert to serve as its CEO.
According to SEC filings, Limpert had (up until the previous year) been a control person
for an investment advisor known as Belsen Getty. He also served various roles such as
chairman and CFO of two publicly traded reverse mergers, Nine Mile Software and Profire
Energy. For reference, SEC filings then describe the fraudulent activity, settlements and
cease and desist orders involved from then CEO Limpert's activity with manipulation and
non-disclosure in these other reverse merger stock deals.

Later in 2009, with Limpert at the helm, Ohr completed the acquisition of Squalamine,
Trodusquemine and related compounds from Genaera Liquidating Trust. The Company
paid a mere $200,000 in cash for all of these compounds.


The cost per compound therefore comes out to something well under $100,000 each. We
don't know exactly how many compounds were purchased in this basket transaction so we
can't determine the exact average cost.


The first question becomes: why were the Hirschmans and Limpert able to acquire
these compounds so cheaply?


The answer is that they arguably had no value whatsoever.


Squalamine was acquired from a Pennsylvania biotech company called Genaera, which
had just wound down and liquidated its remaining assets for just a few pennies per share
in June 2009. Among the "assets" being sold off were the rights to squalamine (for age
related macular degeneration), trodusquemine (for obesity and now breast cancer) and
various other compounds. (Genaera had previously attempted to develop squalamine
under the trade name EVIZON).


Despite being shopped to dozens of potential bidders, the compounds failed to attract high
bids and Ohr was able to walk away with the rights to all of these various compounds
for just $200,000.


These assets were basically given away in bulk, and for a very good reason. In 2007 (two
years BEFORE going out of business) Genaera disclosed that:


Additionally, preliminary information on subjects enrolled in Study 212 suggested
that EVIZON™ was unlikely to produce vision improvement with the speed or
frequency necessary to compete with recently introduced treatments. With this
information, as well as evolving guidance from the FDA on clinical endpoints, we
concluded there was no pragmatic option for the registration and
commercialization of EVIZON™ for the treatment of wet AMD.


The drug was a failure and it was basically being given away as part of a bulk package of
compounds for a nominal sum as part of winding up a bankrupt company.


But what is interesting here is to note that the original optimism by Genaera for the drug
was based on vision and visual acuity, including "up to 8 lines" of visual acuity
improvement. Sound familiar?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 6/27


The key point to understand is that these optimistic views on the efficacy of squalamine
were expressed in a Genaera presentation to investors - in 2003 !!! They are nearly
identical to what Ohr just disclosed in 2014 - 11 years later.


Ohr had absolutely no basis whatsoever for pretending to be surprised at any new and
positive results. The company knew that in-line results should have been achievable since
the day they bought the drug.


Had these results actually mattered, they would have been used as the primary end point
for the study. But they did not matter, so they were not used.

Now it is 2014, and a subsequent test of squalamine (not surprisingly) yields very similar
results. Ohr had reported in its press release that "Percentage of Squalamine plus
Lucentis PRN-treated patients gaining three, four and five lines in visual acuity was more
than double the placebo plus Lucentis PRN arm."


It sounds great. But does it matter?


We can see that in 2014 the results that are being reported by Ohr are in fact slightly
worse than the results we saw back in 2003. And even with those slightly better results
reported by Genaera in 2003, the drug was ultimately abandoned as being irrelevant and
commercially unviable. Aside from Ohr, no one was even willing to pay a meaningful sum
for this discarded drug.


This was a drug with no real commercial value. Genaera was happy to basically give it
away as part of a basket package deal.


What is the point of all of this?

Once again, Ohr is being incredibly misleading by pretending that these results are new or
are any sort of surprise. These results are simply a repeat of similar information, which
had been released 11 years earlier.


In fact, Ohr would have been fully aware of these findings in 2009 when it purchased the
drug from Genaera. The latest press release is nothing more than a ruse to get the stock
up. And the ruse was then repeated and trumpeted by Vista Partners (the firm that doesn't
verify any information provided by Ohr management).


The second question becomes: why would Ohr even bother taking an already failed
drug through clinical trials?


This is something we see all too often in the world of microcap reverse merger biotechs. A
company buys a drug "asset." The result is not to buy the best drug. Instead, it is to buy
the cheapest drug asset it can find and then simply maximize the hype surrounding it. The
stock soars and the company raises tens of millions by selling stock. This capital raised
can hopefully be used later on to buy or develop a real drug, one that actually might work.
In the meantime, executives and directors pay themselves hundreds of thousands per
year in salaries while they wait.


By 2010, Ohr had purchased a small variety of compounds from different sources. Total
cash outlay was well under $1 million such that the cost for each compound continued to
be negligible. The company then took on new management with more "marketable"
credentials than Mr. Limpert.


Dr. Irach Taraporewala was appointed CEO with a base salary of just $61,000 plus some
stock. It turns out that Dr. Taraporewala was an associate of Shalom Hirschman (the
father), with both of them working together at an OTCBB penny stock company called
Advanced Viral Research. That firm went bust in 2009, just as Orin Hirschman was
assembling the Ohr reverse merger. The timing was therefore perfect.


The Hirschmans then appointed Sam Backenroth as CFO. Mr. Backenroth was just 26
years old with two years of work experience and had no experience as a CFO. His starting
salary was $24,000.


The point from all of this is that the goal is not to "succeed at any cost" like a true pharma
company. Instead, it is a strategy known as "fake it 'til you make it."


Acquire assets and people with minimal value or relevant experience and then spin an
impressive story around some massive future potential. When the stock soars, raise as
much money as possible to create as much "disposable capital" as possible.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 9/27


In this way, the financiers can turn an investment of a few hundred thousand dollars (used
to purchase defunct compounds) into "disposable capital" of tens of millions.


When the stock needs a little help, management can always rely on stealthy paid reports
(such as from Vista Partners) and misleading press releases to help boost it up a notch. In
addition, by building relationships with a few small cap investment banks, these types of
companies can occasionally get bullish sell side coverage. It is obvious to these banks
that companies like this will be frequent investment banking clients due to the never-
ending need for capital.


This is the formula for reverse merger riches, and I feel that I am seeing it clearly once
again in Ohr. The only problem is that ordinary shareholders find themselves sitting on a
serial dilution machine due to the never-ending stream of equity offerings. Meanwhile
those behind the promotion can simply award themselves more and more stock options to
maintain their ownership.


Conclusion


Dr. Sacerdote came to the conclusion that "Value of Ohr's squalamine eye drops for wet
age-related macular degeneration is $0 or less."


I entirely agree with Dr. Sacerdote's conclusions, but for very different reasons. Dr.
Sacerdote makes reference to such items as the "biological activity" and "molecular
weight" of squalamine. I see this analysis as being accurate but largely unnecessary.


Squalamine was purchased for a negligible cost from a bankrupt pharma because it had
already failed and was clearly worthless. Dozens of other buyers had the opportunity to
bid on squalamine and no one was willing to pay a material price.


Ohr acquired the cheapest compounds that it could and then appointed the cheapest
management that it could. There was never any real chance of these compounds
succeeding.


Instead, Ohr has used misleading press releases and stealthy paid "research reports" to
boost its stock price and raise money via stock sales.


Ohr Pharma is little more than a fool's game for retail investors which has been
engineered by clever financiers.
