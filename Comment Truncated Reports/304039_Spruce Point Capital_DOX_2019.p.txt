Report Aug 2015 / Oct 2015 Nov 2015


Enterprise Value $1.7 billion $10.1 billion


Company Promotion / 
Situation Overview


Leading quartz countertop manufacturer capable of producing 
sustainable 43% and 26% gross and EBITDA margins, while producing 


double digit growth in the fast growing U.S. market. The Company 
claimed it needed to increase capex to construct a manufacturing 


facility in the U.S. to accelerate its North American expansion.


IRSA, an Argentina conglomerate entity controlled by Eduardo Elszatain 
through multiple entities, was attempting to control the levered 


conglomerate of IDB Development through various entities. 


Our Criticism Our intense fundamental and forensic due diligence uncovered 
evidence of slowing U.S. growth, and margin pressure being 
covered-up. We also expressed grave concerns about the 


Company’s strategy to build a U.S. manufacturing facility and 
believed its capex costs seemed overstated, which would allow 


capitalization of costs on the balance sheet and potentially 
overstate earnings. Our background work into CEO Yos Shiran also 
revealed a pattern of mismanagement at Tefron, an Israeli textile 
company, that promoted a unique technology but failed to gain 
acceptance. Tefron’s business and shares ultimately collapsed.


Our research suggested that IRSA had majority control of IDBD through 
related-party entities under common control that


have accumulated 81% of IDBD’s shares. It appears that IRSA had structured 
its investment through an entity it designated as a VCO. IFRS rules provide a 


narrow exception for investment entities such as VCOs to allow issuers to 
record investments on the balance sheet as an “investment in associate” 


and record changes in value through the income statement. In our opinion, 
IRSA’s Dolphin Fund VCO entities bore no resemblance to a venture fund by 


any stretch of the imagination. In short, we believed the designation as a 
VCO was grossly inappropriate and designed to avoid consolidating IDBD’s 


$6.7 billion of net debt.


Successful Outcome Two CEO/CEO’s and two CFO/CFO’s of Caesarstone have 
subsequently resigned. The Company has reported numerous 


manufacturing problems in both its new U.S. production and Israeli 
facilities. Gross margins have contracted to 25%. The share price has


fallen >70% from our initiation price.


A month later, IRSA and IDBD listened to Spruce Point’s concerns and 
agreed to consolidate the entity. IRSA’s share price has languished and 


returned no capital appreciation to investors in the four years 
post our research report.

Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Sees 25%-50% Downside Risk In 
Amdocs (NYSE: DOX): $30 - $45 Per Share


Amdocs Engaging In M&A To Manufacture Growth
• Closely Tied To A Low-Growth Industry: As IT support for major telcos, Amdocs’ organic growth is ultimately tied to a stagnant industry – AT&T in 


particular (~30% of sales). Management attempts to describe industry trends such as consolidation as a tailwind for the Company, but, in reality, slow 
growth among telcos translates into slow organic growth for Amdocs – particularly as elements of revenue management software become less complex.


• Management Engages In Frequent M&A To Grow Sales: Amdocs has purchased a jumble of IT and media businesses through the past decade to support 
growth where it can’t generate its own. Many of these businesses appear to be only tangentially relevant to Amdocs’ core services, and are only partially 
integrated into Amdocs once acquired. Without these acquisitions, we estimate that Amdocs generates zero to negative organic growth.


• Management Not Transparent About Inorganic Sales Contributions: Management is frequently asked on earnings calls about the contribution of acquired 
businesses to total revenue. It often writes them off as “small” even when the announced purchase price is relatively sizable – and, when it does give 
more granular details, it appears to understate their likely contribution, thus inflating implied organic revenue growth.


Amdocs (DOX or “the Company”) is a cryptic entity based in the tax-dodge haven of Guernsey that provides revenue management, BPO and IT services 
primarily to telecoms. Industry forces have dragged on sales growth to the point that Amdocs appears to be in organic decline. We believe that DOX has 


engineered superficial top and bottom-line growth alongside unusually stable margins through opaque M&A, aggressive percentage-of-completion 
accounting, software cost capitalization, and repeated one-off net tax benefits. Challenged FCF growth, self-imposed minimum cash balances, and likely 


leverage limits will constrain DOX’s ability to pursue growth via M&A going forward. We are also concerned that DOX is accelerating its earnings-
inflating cost capitalization scheme by constructing a new Israeli campus. An obscured JV loan, receivable factoring, and capex statements which hide 


asset sales all point to slowed underlying FCF growth. With insider ownership at an all-time low, evidence that management is milking DOX’s cash 
through aggressive option comp schemes, and Board members tied to allegations of option back-dating and software cost capitalization, we believe that 


shareholders should keep a vigilant eye on management’s accounting practices and compensation decisions.


Hallmark Indicators Of A Company With Questionable Financials And Accounting
• Suspiciously Steady Margins: Amdocs shows remarkably steady margins for a firm which frequently absorbs acquisitions ($1.6B since 2012), which should 


have some degree of operating leverage, and whose business has come under pressure from its largest customer (AT&T). Peers and telcos show much 
more natural margin variability. Unusually steady margins support our suspicion that Amdocs engages in aggressive percentage-of-completion accounting.


• Growing Divergence Between Adjusted And GAAP Metrics: Amdocs’ proprietary Adjusted EPS measure has grown steadily through the last 5 years, while 
GAAP EPS and cash flow have been flat to down over the same period despite the Company’s M&A-fueled growth. Spruce Point has observed both of 
these patterns among numerous companies on which it has published research, and feels that they are strong indicators of impending financial strain.


• Questionable One-Off Tax Items: DOX claims up to $60M of one-off net tax benefits on a yearly basis, with the specific sources of these benefits changing 
almost every year (it claimed $28M in benefits related to its spending on its new campus in FY 2018). We do not believe that these benefits – worth 10% 
of EBT in FY 2018 – are a sustainable source of earnings. Excluding these items, Amdocs’ tax rate looks much closer to that of most companies.


• Struggles Generating Cash: In Dec ‘18, DOX began to disclose that it factors accounts receivable (on non-transparent terms). It also obscured a loan issued 
via a recently-formed JV to finance its new HQ, despite saying previously that it could finance the project internally without material impact to results.


• Who Signs DOX’s 20-F And Credit Agreement: We observe that DOX’s Head of IR/Secretary signs its 20-F and Credit Agreement. Our research shows that 
this is a highly unusual practice: the CEO generally signs the 20-F, while the CFO and/or Treasurer normally signs Credit Agreements.

Spruce Point Sees 25%-50% Downside In DOX


Highly Questionable Financing Behavior Hides True Leverage And Potentially Manipulates Tax Status
• New Accounts Receivable Factoring A Classic Sign of Stress: Management appears to rely increasingly on aggressive percentage -of-completion accounting for paper 


sales growth, manufacturing revenue which is not supported by cash flow. With Amdocs fast approaching its stated minimum cash balance, it has recently resorted to 
factoring receivables to generate cash as slow sales growth demands more M&A – but it won’t disclose the extent of its factoring. We note that this represents a non-
transparent form of borrowing – convenient for a company whose closely-tied customers (AT&T, etc.) value a strong balance sheet. Based on Spruce Point’s 
experience, the initiation of receivable factoring is a strong indicator of near-term negative share price performance.


• Bizarre Borrowing And Investing Patterns Suggestive Of Financial Engineering: Like clockwork, Amdocs borrows ~$200M once a year at the end of one quarter, only to 
repay the loan just weeks later (at most). It has also historically – and inexplicably – purchased and divested of short-term investments in virtually equal amounts on a 
quarterly basis. Management’s desire to shift the weight of its balance sheet in certain quarters may have to do with its unique tax status as a Guernsey-domiciled 
entity: if the Company fails to meet certain standards as defined by the IRS, it would qualify as a “passive foreign investment company” (PFIC), which would bring 
materially higher taxes on U.S.-based DOX investors and precipitate forced stock sales. We suspect that management may be manipulating its balance sheet to 
maintain a preferable tax status for which it should no longer qualify.


Board Entrenchment, Particularly At The Audit Committee Level, Where An Original Member Was Accused Of A Software Capitalization Scheme
• Unique Structure And Insular Management Suspicious In Context: The Company is domiciled in Guernsey, an infamous tax haven. Its European subsidiaries are 


aggregated in the financials of its subsidiary in Cyprus – another recognized money laundering center – where DOX’s local financial statements appear to be 
delinquent, and where it shows limited physical assets. It does most of its business in the U.S., and most of its employees are located in India, yet its executives are 
almost exclusively based in Israel – and are notorious among employees for being extremely insular, protective, and driven to meet quarterly expectations.


• Entrenched Management Team, Board and Auditor Would Make Fraud Difficult To Detect: Many DOX executives have been with the Company for decades, while five 
Board members have an average tenure of 20 yrs. Our biggest concerns lie with the audit committee: Adrian Gardner has been on the committee since the 1998 IPO. 
Lawrence Perlman, former CEO of Ceridian, and another original audit committee member, was named in a (settled) lawsuit involving a $100m software development 
capitalization scheme: at best a pure coincidence, at worst the seeds of DOX’s current practices.


Non-Transparent PP&E Accounting Obfuscates Underlying Capex And Is A Sign Of Both Potential Cost Capitalization And FCF Inflation
• Explosion In European Assets Suggestive Of Cost Capitalization: DOX has seen the value of its European fixed assets more than double over the last five years. One 


problem: the Company has very little physical presence in Europe, nor has management discussed large efforts to grow its presence there. So what are these assets? 
Discrepancies between the way in which DOX and its subsidiaries account for software make us question the legitimacy of these reported assets. We believe that DOX 
may be capitalizing significant software development-related costs which ought to be expensed, and failing to amortize these costs once development is completed.


• Asset Sales Hidden By Non-Transparent Capex Accounting: Management discloses only net capex, grouping both purchases and sales of PP&E together on its cash flow 
statement. We find evidence that management has divested of assets since beginning this practice, thereby depressing reported capex and flattering free cash flow. 
Interestingly, in FY 2018, management did not explicitly state that its disclosed capex figure represents net capex, potentially fooling investors into thinking that 
Amdocs’ reported capex – surreptitiously deflated by asset sales or hidden write-downs – represents gross capex, as most investors are used to seeing.


• Irreconcilable Spending On New Israeli Campus Increases Fear Of Cost Capitalization Scheme and Cash Flow Struggles: DOX says it will spend $350M from FY18 -21 on a 
new Israeli HQ. Why is this needed for a no-growth company with most of its employees in India, and most of its customers in North America? We observe that DOX’s 
reported FY 18 campus spending is inconsistent – varying by as much as 50% of the $100M – at different points of disclosure. Furthermore, DOX obscured the fact that 
it received a loan for the purchase of the campus land, despite saying it could finance the project internally. Heightening our suspicion, we note that Electra Group, its 
Israeli construction partner, said that construction of the four building campus would cost just NIS 300m ($90m).

Spruce Point Sees 25%-50% Downside In DOX


DOX Shares Have 25%-50% Downside From Current Levels Based On Near-Term Estimates, But Could Fall Even Further Going Forward
• DOX Shares Overvalued Due To Reliance On Adjusted EPS And Misplaced Confidence In Growth: DOX is valued at a premium to mid-cap technology and 


BPO peers despite the fact it has a suspiciously opaque structure, below average growth, accounting and governance issues. The growing disconnect 
between GAAP and Non-GAAP results, in addition to evidence of challenged cash flow (e.g. A/R factoring), merits a discounted valuation.


• Room For Significant Downside Going Forward: Amdocs can support M&A-driven leveraged growth in conjunction with its dividend / share buybacks for 
at the very most 2-3 more years, but it is already beginning to put strain on its balance sheet by pursuing both. We expect the market to discount this 
coming growth headwind in the foreseeable future. If DOX received a current multiple in-line with no-growth BPO peers to reflect this reality – about 
1.0x-1.5x EV/Sales – its share price would be approximately 21% to 45% lower.  Alternatively, by adjusting its earnings for aggressive PoC items, software 
development capitalization costs, and tax benefits, and then applying a 11x-15x P/E multiple, we could justify approximately 38% to 55% downside risk. 


Sell-Side Analysts See ~22% Upside In DOX Shares On Faulty Assumptions
• Non-Transparent Company Difficult To Understand: Amdocs is an odd business with increasingly diverse components. Management emphasizes the tech 


side of the business, but Amdocs is not necessarily best viewed as a tech company, as it appears to do more business process outsourced work (BPO). DOX 
does not fit well into many analysts’ coverage universe, and many simply accept management’s discussions with little pushback or critical analysis.


• Analysts Ignore Concerning Financial Trends: Most sell-side analysts have consistently raised price targets through the last twelve months (and beyond) 
despite clear and increasing evidence of strain on the business (AT&T pressure, declining cash balance, no further capacity for M&A without going into 
debt, etc.). Despite weak Q1 FY 19 top-line growth and EPS guidance which missed Street expectations, analysts have remained cheerfully optimistic and, 
in general, have not cut estimates in any material way. Some appear to believe that the new CEO can somehow stabilize the secularly-declining AT&T 
relationship and bring material upside in the coming year for no particular reason other than the fact that he’s a fresh face.


• Large Institutional Investors (Including Israeli Investment Funds) And ETFs Aren’t Buying: Amdocs has very little institutional ownership at the 5%+ level, 
nor does it have a significant presence in telecom or communications ETFs (or any ETFs for that matter). Its biggest weighting is in a small Israeli tech ETF, 
despite the fact that it does most of its business in North America and has most of its employees in India. Even more alarming: only two of DOX’s top 100 
shareholders are Israeli institutions, where the Company has legacy ties and where top management resides.


Management Incentives Not Aligned With Shareholders: Insider Ownership Near An All-Time Low, While Insiders Surreptitiously Enrich Themselves
• Share Repurchases Not What It Appears: DOX touts that its delivers returns to investors with generous share repurchases, but much of the buying is offset 


by heavy dilution, and $80m+ year of proceeds from options being exercised.
• Heavy, Non-Transparent Insider Sales While Company Buys: Insiders owned 80%+ of DOX after the IPO, but this figure has dwindled annually, and is now 


just 1.5%. Included in DOX insider sales records is an opaque, Guernsey-based entity named Pines Quest, which has been selling in size and was named in 
the Panama Papers tax dodge scandal. While most insiders are listed in Amdocs’ insider sales records individually, we suspect that some have pooled their 
funds in this secretive entity to sell without drawing scrutiny. Amdocs executives have come under legal scrutiny for precisely the same scheme in the past.


• Questionable Stock Option Compensation Activity: Based on recent option values disclosed in DOX’s 20-F, it appears that management has been granting 
itself preferential options struck in-the-money, which signals an inherently bearish outlook on the stock. A member of Amdocs’ Board was named in an SEC 
options backdating complaint (settled) in the past. As a result, option practices merit heightened scrutiny from investors.

Reviving The Post-Dot Com Bust Playbook:
Is Amdocs Pulling The Same Levers To Hide Weakness?


After a downward sales guidance revision of 40% drove the price of DOX shares down 40% in 2002, investors filed a class action lawsuit 
accusing management of hiding underlying business weakness in the wake of the dot com bust. In our opinion, as the telecom industry faces 


major headwinds once again, we observe that Amdocs appears to be engaging in the same behavior today as was described in the 2002 lawsuit –
and, with turnover at Amdocs relatively low at the top, these practices are being put into place by many of the same executives and directors.


Although the 2002 case was ultimately dismissed against the strict standard of securities fraud, DOX investors should be warned that the 
behavior now being repeated by the Company was previously carried out in direct response to major deterioration in customer demand, and 
foreshadowed significant guidance revisions and share price declines. We worry that a similar future may be in store for the Company today.


Concern 2002 Lawsuit Observations And Accusations Today
Have We Seen 
This Before?


Industry 
Headwinds


• Dot com bubble crashed in late 1999-early 2000. 
Management claimed that demand remained strong in the 
face of strong market pressure, but, in reality, customers 
gradually shifted away from its expensive offerings in favor of 
in-sourcing and other cheaper options.


• Most major telcos seeing zero to negative organic growth. 
Management claims that industry consolidation creates new 
sources of demand. More likely that cost-conscious telcos are 
cutting spending on back-office IT services.


YES


Serial Acquisitions 
Mask Organic 
Contraction


• Amdocs spent ~$1.4B on acquisitions from 1999-2001. 
Acquired businesses were less strategic in nature than they 
were designed to add customers and create cross-selling 
opportunities to meet aggressive targets.


• $1.6B on acquisitions since FY 2009, but OCF CAGR of <1%. 
Many acquired businesses are unrelated to Amdocs’ core 
offering and do not appear to be deeply integrated into 
Amdocs. Management obscures the sales contribution of 
acquisitions and attributes most revenue growth to organic 
sources. True organic growth appears flat at best.


YES


Questionable
Reported Growth 


In Workforce


• Management reported growth in workforce every single 
quarter from Nov 2000-Apr 2002 to corroborate reported 
sales growth. Former employees and third-party recruiters 
suggested that Amdocs was in fact laying off people during 
this time.


• Reported positive growth in workforce on a yearly basis 
despite apparent business strain. Definition of “employee” in 
20-F changed by management two years in a row, perhaps to 
preserve appearance of growth.


YES


Aggressive
Accounting Boosts 


Revenue


• Accounts receivable and DSOs rise, suggesting aggressive 
revenue recognition. Declining allowances for doubtful 
accounts makes little sense in context of rising DSOs.
Accusations of ordering delayed revenue recognition at 
acquired companies to reserve it for Amdocs.


• Rising DSOs for unbilled receivables and falling deferred 
revenue suggests aggressive percentage-of-completion 
accounting to boost sales. Declining allowances for doubtful 
accounts makes little sense in context of rising DSOs. Some 
suggestions of inappropriate treatment of acquisitions’ sales.

Secretive Control 
By Foreign

• Israeli management kept air-tight control of narrative. All

Employees ordered to forward customer service calls to Israel 
for customers inquiring about certain disputed charges. 
Reportedly aggressive in attempts to meet growth targets.


• Global employees report frustration with lack of 
communication from Israeli executives regarding strategic 
direction. Few opportunities for career advancement for 
employees outside core Israeli circle. Reportedly aggressive in 
looking to meet Wall Street expectations.

Opaque Sources


• Most of $250M raised in IPO allocated to executives and 
employees, not reinvested in the Company. Some employee 
stock distributions held in opaque offshore investor trust for 
beneficial tax treatment and to hide insider selling.


• Insider ownership near all-time lows. Questionable option
distributions suggest lack of confidence in Company by 
management, and little incentive alignment with 
shareholders. Opaque entity similar to early-2000s trust 
selling shares in massive size, likely hiding insider sales.

The fact that we have seen the same management team behave in a similar manner in response to similarly negative industry trends – all leading up to a 
dramatic guidance revision after executives enriched themselves during the Dot com boom/bust – makes us worried that current investors in DOX are headed 


for a similar fate as those who were left to sue for securities fraud in 2002. As management appears to run out of accounting levers to pull, and as its capacity for 
continued growth through M&A becomes strained, it becomes more and more likely that the story being spun by the Company will crack.


Worryingly, we now observe evidence of new behavior perhaps even more egregious than anything carried out by management during the dot com bust, 
potentially magnifying the risks to which current DOX investors are exposed.

High Level Accounting Shenanigan Indicator #1: 
Suspiciously Steady Margins


Amdocs demonstrates remarkably steady EBITDA margins for a company which consistently engages in M&A, and competes in an 
industry experiencing waning growth and margin pressure from its largest customer – AT&T.  By comparison, CSG Systems 


(“CSG”), another telecom business support systems company, and AT&T its prime customer, show much more variation in margin. 
Our report will detail why we believe liberal use of percentage-of-completion accounting could be the culprit.

Non-GAAP Adjustments Inflate EPS By A Substantial 
(And Increasing) Margin


Non-GAAP EPS as defined by the Company has grown at an eerily steady rate of ~6% per year despite more idiosyncratic 
growth in GAAP EPS, which has in fact contracted in recent years. Naturally, non-GAAP adjustments have become an 


increasing share of non-GAAP earnings over the same time frame, growing to close to 40% of non-GAAP earnings in FY 2018 
versus ~15% in FY 2013 – still a large number in its own right.

High Level Accounting Shenanigan Indicator #3: 
Acquisitions Not Translating Into Cash Flow Growth


We observe that, despite spending $1.6bn on acquisitions since FY 2009, cash flow from operations has grown by only a 
marginal amount, demonstrating that earnings growth via M&A has not generated material value for shareholders, and 
affirming that much of the observed growth in sales and earnings appears to be attributed to aggressive accounting.


Management has spent $1.6B on M&A since the financial crisis to grow operating cash flow from $519M to $557M in ten years, for an 
operating cash flow CAGR of less than 1%.

High Level Accounting Shenanigan Indicator #4:
DOX CEO/CFO Do Not Sign Key SEC Documents


While most foreign public companies have their 20-F SEC filings signed by their respective CEOs, Amdocs’ filings are signed by 
Secretary Matthew Smith, described as an “Authorized Signatory” and “Head of IR,” and based in Jersey City, NJ – far from 
management in Israel and its U.S. HQ in Missouri. Why does Amdocs not have a major officer sign its critical SEC filings? 


What’s even more perplexing: despite having a CFO, Global Treasurer, and US Treasurer and Controller, none of these Amdocs 
representatives sign its credit agreement. 


By not signing these key documents, is DOX management trying to shield itself from liability if material misstatements in its SEC 
and banking agreements were uncovered?

Source: Company financials, Bloomberg consensus and Spruce Point adjusted financials and estimates


1) We assume the full capital inflow from the noncontrolling interests represents a loan as a result of DOX obfuscating its source
2) DOX organic revenue guidance 2%-6% per investor day presentation


Analysts expectations are for moderate top-line organic growth, sustainable margins, and mid-single digit EPS growth. Based on 
our research, Spruce Point believes that DOX has at best no organic growth, and at worst declining growth. Furthermore, we 


believe aggressive PoC, software development cost capitalization, and unusual net tax benefit accounting appear to be inflating 
margins and earnings. DOX’s free cash is being aided by asset sales obfuscated by DOX’s reporting of “net capex”, recent A/R 
factoring, and a JV loan.  As a result, we attempt to adjust Street estimates for these factors that appear to be inflating DOX’s 


results.

Amdocs The Infrastructure Of A Decelerating 
Telecom Industry


Amdocs provides a broad array of software and IT services to telecom companies, with a particular focus on revenue management
among other business support systems (BSS) and operational support systems (OSS). The Company has added a hodgepodge of 
ancillary IT services via acquisitions through the last 10+ years, but its historical bread and butter has been revenue management 


systems. The business is naturally closely tied to the rest of the telecom industry, and counts among its largest customers telecom 
stalwarts such as AT&T (~30% of Amdocs revenue), Bell Canada, Sprint, etc. It’s no secret that growth in this industry has slowed 


substantially with increasing competition from OTT services and other telecom alternatives.

Heavy Exposure To AT&T


Of particular note is Amdocs’ exposure to AT&T, which accounts for ~30% of Company revenue. AT&T has seen consistent 
organic sales declines through the last several years, and capex has generally been flat. A lack of growth in spending on IT 
infrastructure among major customers will limit Amdocs’ potential organic sales growth, and margin pressure at AT&T and 


throughout the industry will force Amdocs’ customers to spend frugally though the foreseeable future.


Importantly, we note that, until recently, AT&T was a strategic investor in Amdocs. However, AT&T’s position in DOX equity fell below 5% in 2009, and 
there is no indication that it maintains a material position in the stock today. Not only does this diminish AT&T’s interest in maintaining a strong 


relationship with Amdocs, but it perhaps reveals AT&T’s perception of the direction of the industry and of Amdocs’ future in the space.


Investors would be wise to take note of AT&T’s divestment, as there are likely few entities with a better understanding of the direction of telecom than one 
of the biggest players in the industry.

Occam’s Razor: Bad Business For Telcos =
Bad Business For Amdocs


As a provider of back-office support systems to the telecom industry, Amdocs is exposed to the same top-line headwinds plaguing 
the rest of the sector – yet management would have you believe that the Company is growing steadily against this backdrop. 


Management counterintuitively cites sources of industry pressure as sources of opportunity for Amdocs: e.g. that telecom industry 
consolidation creates demand for IT integration projects, and that the increasingly competitive telecom landscape drives 


investment in value-added IT initiatives. We prefer an explanation that doesn’t force us to jump through hoops: as a provider of
utility-like IT services to telcos, business is best for Amdocs is best when business is good for telcos, and business is bad for 


Amdocs when telcos become more cost-conscious. Stagnant sales growth and compressing margins among telcos put pressure 
on industry service providers like Amdocs.


Q1 FY 2016 Earnings Call


“…competition among North American wireless operators continued to intensify presenting us with 
opportunities to partner and support our key customers in their strategic initiatives.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


“A highly demanding customer, a very sophisticated customer. It may sound like an issue. It's actually an 
advantage because we have the ability to address highly complex sophisticated customers.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


A more competitive telecom 
environment is good for Amdocs? 


Really?


Q3 FY 2016 Earnings Call


Wouldn’t more sophisticated customers 
also be more cost-conscious and savvy 


to Amdocs alternatives?


“So I’m mentioning the projects orientation because on one hand it creates pressure and it stretches our 
delivery organization to the limit and many aspects like this. But on the other hand, this is the foundation 
for anything else, because usually a successful project leads to other successful projects, and as we are 
expanding our offering, the potential other projects that can come after whatever project we started with.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


Q4 FY 2016 Earnings Call
One-off projects might provide 


opportunities for future business 
relationships, but how is it good for the 


business that sales are increasingly 
driven by one-off projects rather than 


sources of recurring revenue?


Q4 FY 2012 Earnings Call


“Business combinations such as [T-Mobile / MetroPCS, SoftBank / Sprint] often present significant long-
term opportunity for Amdocs, giving our track record of consolidating systems on behalf of our customers 
especially in North America.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


Industry consolidation should lead to 
reduced industry-wide spending on 
support services in the long run…

Technological Trends Not In Amdocs’ Favor


Former Amdocs employees have indicated to us that the technology and services provided by Amdocs are becoming increasingly 
obsolete. A growing emphasis on all-encompassing data plans over more complicated multifaceted plans which treat phone, 


internet, etc. as separate items has simplified customer care and billing in the telecom industry, and has rendered these services 
easier to provide by SaaS and other players – Salesforce, Ericsson, Cisco, etc. Not only is the telecom industry challenged more 
generally, but Amdocs’ core offering represents a shrinking facet of the industry. Amdocs’ acquisitions of network, media, and 


other businesses have largely been defensive, as management looks to lateral away from its current revenue management focus 
before shifting industry tides leave the Company washed ashore.

Does This Look Like Recurring Revenue To You?


Management frequently oversells the extent to which its revenue streams are recurring in nature and protected from the threat of
tightening telecom budgets. It claims that its one-off “digital transformation” projects often generate recurring “managed services” 


revenue streams, as its one-off engagements supposedly give the Company opportunities to “put forward [a] dialog” about its 
other service offerings. We believe that IT spending in the telecom industry will be dictated much more heavily by the economic 
realities of the sector than by management’s sales pitches for its ancillary IT services, and that an industry under pressure will 
inevitably avoid increasing its spending on non-mission-critical back-office services. Amdocs’ sales growth patterns appear to 


confirm that sales depend heavily on one-off projects and other non-recurring sources of revenue.


Q4 FY 2016 Earnings Call


“I guess my first question, Eli, you had a comment where you said that you 
have a number of projects moving to production from development phase. I 
know this for transformational projects that you are doing. I guess that leads to 
a couple of queries; one is, what's the pipeline for new projects to replace 
the ones that are moving into production? And then the second part is, just 
trying to understand when these transformational large projects move to 
production, what does that mean for your P&L?”


- Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citigroup


“…usually a successful project leads to other successful projects, and as we are 
expanding our offering…. And projects, usually when they come to fruition, 
they don't go to zero. We go from ramp up of the people to some kind of a 
ongoing support…. And this further project are not necessarily the one that 
you have right now in the pipeline because sometime though as a result of a 
dialog – put forward dialog that we have with our customers and not 
necessarily the stuff that they have in the bid process and so on so forth.”
- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


If one-off projects can consistently translate into stable and recurring managed services revenue streams, why is region-specific sales growth so volatile?


Tough comps could explain single-year fluctuations within a reasonable range, but these effects should be measured, and should resolve over time.


Rather, significant fluctuations in sales growth ranging from ~50% to <0% strongly suggest heavy dependence on non-recurring, one-off projects (or M&A) 
for revenue. Tough comps alone cannot explain revenue contraction, and recurring revenue streams would produce more stable growth profiles than this.

Long Explanations Are Non-Explanations


Management frequently avoids providing direct responses to critical questions on earnings calls by instead providing 
long-winded non-answers – typically laundry lists of tangentially-relevant facts which do not answer the questions 
directly. This is often done in response to questions regarding the contribution of acquisitions to sales growth, the 


health of key customers, and other important issues which are critical to the business, but which are likely not trending 
in Amdocs’ favor. This behavior comes across as evasive.


Q1 FY 2016 Earnings Call


“…what is the specific set of issues at AT&T? Is it a competitive matter? Is it 
pricing? Or do they already have enough penetrations, so high percentage of 
their offerings already? What is the analysis of that?”


- Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citigroup


562-Word Response (Excerpt):


“…So the relative softness we have in AT&T is not because of pricing, it's 
not because of our competitive landscape, none of the above. It's just 
business, fluctuation of discretionary expenses, the most normal thing you 
can expect. But these fluctuations affects us in a big way, I'm sure that there are 
other suppliers where they did it being affected even more so than us….”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


“Ashwin, just to clarify another point. The activity we're doing for AT&T in Mexico 
and in Latin America, is part rest of the world, not in the North America side. So 
that's part of the areas where we're seeing growth which is not reflected in North 
America numbers.”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs
“Okay. No, that’s really good enough.”


- Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citigroup
“Okay. But we have a big project in Mexico and it’s in within AT&T, we don’t 
report it as North America.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs
“Okay. No, that’s good enough.”


- Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citigroup
“Customers are customers anyway. But I know that we gave you enough color to 
understand that why we are not so worried about it. We think it's a timing 
thing, it's like a discretionary thing. We have seen it in other players, but plus 
minus 5% or 10% in one customer may affect us in almost negligible way and 
we can compensate for that, and the same percentage in AT&T is just big.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


Are we to believe that AT&T – a business facing tremendous pressure –
is cutting spending on IT services “just because”?


Is this not begging the question?


Even if true, could the CEO have said this in fewer than 600 words?

Management Not Transparent About The 
Contribution Of Acquisitions To Sales


Importantly, management is rarely transparent about the extent to which sales growth is attributable to acquisitions. Amdocs 
conducts frequent M&A and is almost always asked about the contribution of acquisitions to sales growth on subsequent earnings 


calls. Management frequently says that the contribution is negligible even for medium to large acquisitions – and, even when it 
does provide more color, it typically does so by providing an expected forward sales growth contribution rather than by providing 


a precise revenue contribution figure. The contribution of acquisitions is also not broken out in Amdocs’ financials.


Q2 FY 2018 Earnings Call


“…just on the latest acquisition I guess UXP, maybe I missed this, but any 
color on revenue contribution from that going forward?”


- William Power, Robert W. Baird & Co.


UXP – an $80M acquisition – contributed $0 to sales?


“in terms of the numbers, it's less material. So, that's why we didn't refer to it. 
It's relatively a small company at this stage, but we believe that together with 
the breadth of the customers' opportunity that we have that we acquired 
through Vubiquity now, the opportunity is significant moving forward to create 
those synergies. But it will take some time naturally.”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


Q3 FY 2015 Earnings Call


“So maybe first just a clarification. Did you give us the Comverse contribution 
and the Q4 revenue guidance.”


- William Power, Robert W. Baird & Co.


“You are talking about low tens of millions of dollars per quarter, just to remind 
you they were reporting standalone segment, the revenue has been 
continuingly going down, I think, the last quarter they reported on a standalone 
basis was already in the forties. And first of all, we are not acquiring all of the 
assets that they have in that segment and B), we are going through purchase 
accounting adjustments that are actually trimming some of the deferred 
revenue they could enjoy.


So our starting base is somewhat lower and the idea of course is over time as 
we push the whole rational of the deal towards the upsell opportunities we'll 
start getting it higher.”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


The portion of the Comverse BSS assets acquired by Amdocs alone generated quarterly revenue closer to the $50M range. See our later slides
on the Comverse BSS acquisition.

Flexible Definition Of “Organic” Sales: Management 
Giving Itself Credit Where Credit Isn’t Always Due


Management defends its lack of transparency regarding the contribution of acquisitions to sales by arguing that newly-added 
business typically grow rapidly once integrated into Amdocs, and that it quickly becomes difficult to segregate organic revenue 


growth from inorganic revenue contributions. We believe that this is a poor excuse for management’s failing to quantify inorganic 
revenue contributions when asked for it on earnings calls. Regardless of whether Amdocs’ acquisitions do in fact grow quickly
post-integration, it should not be difficult for management to develop a standard framework for measuring inorganic growth –


whether by designating all sales from added business lines as inorganic for the four quarters following the addition, by using the 
business’ performance through the prior four quarters as a benchmark for inorganic sales contributions, etc. – and applying it to 


each newly-acquired business. Management’s choice to instead consistently refrain from breaking out inorganic sales, even when 
this figure could feasibly be deduced from publicly-available data, suggests that the Company is being purposefully evasive.


“I guess, my first question is just to clarify what was your organic constant 
currency growth in the quarter?”


- Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citigroup


Q1 FY 2016 Earnings Call


“When it comes to mobile financial services, it's also in the tens of millions of 
dollars already was – some of it came from M&A, some of it came from 
new projects. To predict this growth is actually a little bit harder, because 
the receptiveness and adoption rate in the emerging market of such ideas is 
really quite wild. And some time governments would push it and maybe it will 
fly. So I think that their entire world is still waiting for use cases.”


- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


Q4 FY 2015 Earnings Call


“…We have seen better momentum as we described, so we have seen better 
results coming from Comverse's customer base…. That's why we are not 
getting into the speculation. Even internally, it's getting more difficult. What's 
the next deal that is coming in such account? Is it a pre-Comverse 
contribution or a post-Comverse? You understand what I mean?”
- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


It’s important for investors to be able to quantify the contribution of acquisitions to sales growth to have a sense of the Company’s underlying 
organic growth rate. Amdocs – a serial acquirer – must do a better job of breaking out organic growth from inorganic growth for investors. While 


the distinction can at times be blurry, this is no excuse for making little to no effort to estimating each component of sales growth for the 
investing public.

Near-Zero Organic Growth Hidden 
Under Parade Of Acquisitions
25


Quarterly Sales Growth Consistently Low In 
Non-Acquisition Periods


As management is typically not transparent about the contribution of acquisitions to sales growth, it can be difficult to 
segregate Amdocs’ organic growth rate from the effect of acquisitions. This is made doubly difficult by the fact that 


Amdocs rarely goes more than four quarters without conducting M&A, thereby making up for lapsing acquisitions with 
new sources of inorganic growth. However, when we analyze Amdocs’ sales growth on a quarterly basis – which is not 
impacted by M&A in non-acquisition periods – we observe that revenue growth is quite low in periods in which it does 


not complete an acquisition. As Amdocs is not a seasonal business, quarter-over-quarter sales growth is not a 
meaningless statistic for the Company, and it should be reflective of its true underlying organic growth rate.


Interestingly, during earnings calls, management itself evaluates some performance measures on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but also hedges 
itself by stating that quarter-over-quarter performance may be lumpy due to quarter-specific events, and occasionally uses this as an excuse for 


disappointing quarterly performance.


We note that any such one-off events would also distort quarterly year-over-year growth in the same manner. Seasonality may render a 
company’s quarterly performance uninformative in general, but quarterly lumpiness is a reality for many businesses. As Amdocs is not a 


seasonal business, sequential performance measures are informative as measures of Company performance, at least on average.

rate is lower than management suggests and analysts believe.

Quarterly Sales Growth Low In Non-
Acquisition Periods Even After FX Adjustments


After adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange on sales – which has been a headwind in most periods – Amdocs’ 
underlying organic growth rate appears stronger, but is still dwarfed by growth in quarters in which it conducts M&A, 
which has an undue influence on overall top-line growth. We also note that Amdocs’ average quarterly growth rate in 
non-acquisition periods is supported by two particularly strong quarters, without which its average organic quarterly 


growth rate ex-FX would have been just 0.3% (1.4% annualized).


Quarter-over-quarter sales growth consistently higher in 
acquisition periods, and relatively low in non-acquisition periods.


It is natural for growth to be relatively higher in acquisition 
periods, but these figures suggest that Amdocs’ organic growth 
rate is lower than management suggests and analysts believe.

Is Management Pursuing M&A To Pad 
Sales Growth?


Again, management rarely breaks out organic growth or offers an explicit organic growth target. However, when we subtract 
management’s expected contributions from acquisitions (when provided) from total sales growth targets, we observe that 


management has guided to 2-5% organic sales growth through the last several years. Yet, we also observe that Amdocs’ sales 
growth has averaged an annualized 1.5% in quarters in which it has not received an M&A tailwind. We wonder not only if 


management is pursuing M&A for the sake of revenue growth, but also if it is understating the effect of acquisitions on sales
so as to inflate apparent organic growth.


As a potential indication of the former, we note that many of the companies acquired by management appear never to be fully 
integrated into Amdocs; rather, they seem to operate as independent businesses with independent websites, etc. We wonder if 


management is doing much more with its acquisitions of loosely-related businesses than simply buying sales.


Why doesn’t management integrate these businesses into broader Amdocs more comprehensively?

their separate websites

Industry Observers Question Amdocs’ 
Acquisitions


Telecom revenue management systems is not exactly a heavily-followed industry among hobbyists and casual observers. Yet, 
where knowledgeable commentators have offered their independent views on Amdocs’ acquisitions, we see a pattern of doubt 


regarding the acquired businesses’ fit within Amdocs, questioning of management’s motives, and general skepticism.


In some cases, management isn’t shy about the fact that its M&A isn’t done for purely “strategic” reasons as much as it’s done simply to 
gobble up new customers. Again, management was accused of doing just this in 1999-2002 to cover up declining organic sales.


Is Amdocs looking for 
opportunities to buy 


struggling assets with 
large customer bases so 


as to acquire new 
customers relatively 


inexpensively?
Amdocs management was 
accused of doing just this 


in the 2002 lawsuit.

Buying Growth Through Acquisitions:
Part Of Amdocs’ 1999-2002 Playbook


Acquiring sales via acquisition is a well-worn strategy for Amdocs. During the dot com bust, as the Company faced top-line 
pressure in the face of a struggling telecom industry, management made ~$1.4B worth of acquisitions to compensate for 


organic revenue contraction. Again, interestingly, management did not go to lengths to hide the fact that its primary motive in 
acquiring these businesses was to add new customers. Little emphasis appears to have been put on the strategic fit between 


Amdocs and its newly-acquired businesses, just as little emphasis appears to be placed on this today.


As many current Amdocs executives and directors were also present between 1999-2002, we worry that they could be 
implementing the same playbook which they employed 20 years ago to cover up organic sales contraction.


Are we comfortable with a management team which has been criticized in the past for the practice of hiding organic top-line contraction and 
capitalizing the cost of growth?


Kerry Chambers, et al. vs. Amdocs Limited, et al.

Further Evidence Of Slowing Growth: Lack Of 
Transparency Regarding Headcount


Amdocs discloses its headcount annually in its 20-F, and reports remarkably consistent growth in its workforce: headcount 
has grown every single year since FY 2009 (after the financial crisis), and before then since FY 2004 (following the Company’s 
post-dot com bubble restructuring). However, we note that, after years of reporting headcount on an apples-to-apples basis, 


management changed either the definition of “employee” or the basis of its workforce disclosure in each of the last two years.


We worry that management may be manipulating its headcount disclosure to ensure that it continues to report growth in its 
workforce. Amdocs’ frequent revision of its official headcount perhaps reveals that its workforce has in fact been stagnant or 
contracting. Consistent with this hypothesis, we note that LinkedIn data suggest that Amdocs’ workforce declined between 


December 2016 and December 2017, and continued to decline at an even faster rate through the past year.

Anecdotal Evidence Contradicts Management 
Headcount Claims


A preponderance of employee reviews – though, again, anecdotal – suggest that management is in fact engaging in “massive 
layoffs.” While Company hiring and firing may vary heavily by geography and division, these claims clash with management’s 


description of the business as healthy and growing steadily.

Another Page Out Of The Old Playbook: 
Dubious Claims Regarding Headcount Growth?


Once again, Amdocs appears to be taking the same steps which management allegedly took in the early 2000s to cover up 
potential evidence of business contraction: report consistent growth in Company headcount to corroborate claims of growth.


Kerry Chambers, et al. vs. Amdocs Limited, et al.


In particular, the lawsuit alleged heavy layoffs at the companies acquired by Amdocs. We find it interesting that, even as the Company 
continues to make large acquisitions, it is showing only marginal headcount growth, and only after stretching its definition of “employee.” 


We believe that the slow growth in Amdocs’ workforce in the context of frequent acquisitions implies that management is conducting 
significant layoffs, corroborating anecdotal evidence.
33


Management Claims That Almost All Growth 
Is Organic Growth


Management is never explicit about the contribution of acquisitions to sales growth, and frequently suggests that no growth is 
attributable to acquisitions even in periods in which it conducts material M&A. Below we deduce management’s organic 


growth calculations based on language used during quarterly earnings calls (see appendix for a full deal-by-deal breakdown). 
The Company appears to be communicating that, since FY 2017, it continues to see just under 3% year-over-year sales growth.

Growing Asset Value Concentration In Europe 
Makes Little Sense


Per Amdocs’ SEC filings, the value of the Company’s European fixed assets nearly doubled between FY 13 and FY 17, and now 
represents 38% of its total fixed asset base at $188M (down slightly from 43% due to the Israeli campus under development). 


This stands in stark contrast to its global floor space distribution by square foot: Cyprus and the UK each represent just 2-4% 
of Amdocs’ total footprint. Even if its “Other” category were composed entirely of other European locations (it isn’t – more than 


one third of this category represents Mexico and the Philippines, as revealed by Amdocs’ FY 2018 20-F), Europe would 
represent only another 10% of Amdocs’ global floor space – still far below 38%. This category has not grown substantively 


since FY 14 in any case, in contrast to the rapidly growing total value of Amdocs’ European assets.
We are struck by the disconnect between Amdocs’ European footprint and the value of its European assets, which suggests 


that it has made sizeable investments in software, computer equipment, etc. in locations in which it has little physical presence.

Amdocs Sales By Geography Of Customer


North America Europe Rest of World


Growing Asset Value Concentration In Europe 
Makes Little Sense (Continued)


Furthermore, we note that the growth in the value of Amdocs’ European assets is not in line with the geographic distribution of 
its customers, nor with changes in the geographic distribution of its customer base since its European assets began to balloon. 


Sales to European customers have grown substantially in some years, but this growth has generally been inconsistent.
We question whether it justifies the observed explosion in Amdocs’ European asset base through the last several years.

Assets In Europe Growing, But European

We also note that, despite the reported growth in the value of Amdocs’ European assets, the Company has cut back on its 
European locations since early 2017, as demonstrated by recent changes to its “Contact Us” webpage.

Reported Assets At Odds With Appearances 
And Now Stopped Disclosing Computer Counts


Our understanding of the nature of Amdocs’ assets appears to be at odds with how the Company presents them, particularly in 
Europe. Amdocs shows significant “Computer equipment” (including capitalized software) on its balance sheet, with this 


category representing ~75% of gross PP&E as of FY 2018, and with PP&E in turn representing over 40% of non-current assets 
(excluding goodwill). However, we’ve confirmed with former employees that Amdocs keeps a relatively limited share of its 


capex intensive computer equipment and other technology in Europe, as most product development infrastructure is located in 
Israel, and as most other global offices are maintained to give the Company a service presence nearby customers – of which 


Amdocs has relatively fewer in Europe. There is little explanation for Amdocs’ large and growing European asset concentration.


More generally, judging by images and videos of Company offices on Glassdoor, YouTube, etc., Amdocs looks less like a 
“tech” company with significant “computer equipment” infrastructure than a low-tech call center / customer service provider.

Is this a high-tech operation with large investments 
in “computer equipment”?

Relative Growth In India Reveals Shift Towards 
Service Over Product Development


Although we question Amdocs’ reported workforce figures, we are struck by the relative growth in the Company’s headcount in 
India relative to other geographies. We believe that this reflects Amdocs’ increasing shift towards IT services and business 


process outsourcing, over product development.

Less Coding, More Calling


Amdocs pitches itself as a “tech” company, but the bulk of its operations appear much closer to customer service than to “tech”.
Former employees characterize the core of the business as, to some extent, a large call center operation. We are told that at least
70% of costs are human resource-related, due both to its relatively large headcount and to its high employee churn (particularly in 
India) – something with which we would associate a call center, not a true “tech” company. We are also told that, in some cases,
Amdocs is effectively used by telcos as a BPO organization to manage their own customers, which appears to be confirmed by 


language used in Amdocs’ Professional Services Agreement (PSA) with AT&T. As an employee publicly put it, Amdocs is more Tech 
Mahindra than Google.


Amdocs often describes itself using vague buzzword salads riddled with allusions to “AI,” “machine learning,” etc., but offers limited insight 
into what it actually does. At its core, it is not a tech-intensive business doing innovative work requiring cutting-edge hardware or software; 


rather, it provides a straight-forward suite of IT services, and manages call centers for customer support.


Amdocs is investing in new services and networking technologies via M&A, but former employees characterize these investments as largely 
defensive attempts to keep growth afloat by lateralling into adjacent services, while its existing offerings grow increasingly less lucrative.


So, if Amdocs doesn’t require significant tech infrastructure, what is all of the “computer equipment” and capitalized software for?


Amdocs and AT&T Professional Services Agreement, FY 2017


Amdocs’ 20-F explicitly discusses business process outsourcing, and 
its PSA with AT&T alludes to performing call center work on


AT&T’s behalf.


Is AT&T using Amdocs as a BPO?

Network Of Subsidiaries Running Through
Dodgy Tax Havens


To investigate the growth in Amdocs’ European assets, we researched each of its separate European subsidiaries. We found 
that each of its European subsidiaries is itself a subsidiary of the Company’s Cyprus entity, and is consolidated in the Cyprus 
financials. We note that, while Amdocs does have substantive operations in Cyprus – i.e. the Cyprus entity isn’t just a shell –


Cyprus is a recognized tax haven and a common destination for individuals and entities which need shell companies domiciled 
in EU-member states (which Ireland and the Channel Islands, two other recognized tax havens, are not).1

Cyprus subsidiary is delinquent in its filings.

Computer Software Shown As
Intangible Assets Under Subsidiaries…


Note that, as shown in Amdocs’ Cypriot filings, the Company’s aggregate European operations show very limited fixed assets, 
but significant intangible assets, which are composed almost entirely (~100%) of software ($112M, including software under 


development). Fixed assets represent a relatively smaller quantity of mostly computer hardware and leasehold improvements.

…So What Is The “Software” In The Fixed Asset 
Account At The Parent Level?


At the parent level, however, the situation is flipped: the fixed asset account dwarfs the intangible account, and the relatively 
large (internally-developed) software item is included in “Computer equipment” within the fixed asset account.


Internally-developed software is listed under intangible assets in Amdocs’ subsidiaries, and software acquired via M&A is given the same 
treatment at the parent company. However, management lists internally-developed software as a fixed asset at the parent company – and, 


importantly, avoids amortizing software for internal use.


An unamortized item such as this would be an awfully convenient place to park some capitalized expenses, wouldn’t it?


At best, Amdocs is avoiding amortizing actually-developed software. At worst, it is stuffing improperly-capitalized costs onto its balance 
sheet and not accounting for them consistently across its various subsidiaries.


FY 2014 20-F


Note: Amdocs has kept this void account on its balance sheet 
since FY 2007. Why? (See later discussion)

Expense Capitalization Would Help To Explain 
Odd Trends In Asset Base


Revisiting our observation that the growth in Amdocs’ European assets makes little sense in the context of its physical 
footprint, rampant expense capitalization would help to reconcile this anomaly. The build-up in intangible software observed at 
the Cyprus entity, and supporting the observed explosion in European assets at the parent, would represent capitalized costs 


allocated as “software assets developed for internal use” – a fixed asset at the parent level, but an intangible asset among 
Amdocs’ subsidiaries.


Note that this pattern is mirrored in Amdocs’ UK and Ireland subsidiaries, for which we were also able to obtain filings.
None of these subsidiaries shows significant tangible assets.


This cuts both ways: Cost capitalization would help to explain the European asset anomaly, but the anomaly itself also helps to confirm that 
Amdocs’ assets are not what they seem. It is unlikely that such robust fixed asset growth could occur on such limited square footage. Even 
if the assets were software, we wouldn’t expect to see such robust growth in European software while Amdocs trims its European footprint.


It is perhaps more likely that these “fixed assets” have been manufactured through accounting practices.

Amdocs Software Systems Ltd (Ireland)


Note: Large “Investments” account represents intercompany 
investments between Amdocs subsidiaries.


In all, this subsidiary shows very limited tangible assets.

Unamortized Capitalized Software as a % of Computer Equipment (Gross)


Suspicious Growth In
Unamortized Software Account


We are curious as to why Amdocs’ “Unamortized software assets developed for internal use” account has grown rapidly as a 
percentage of total fixed assets – both gross and net. If it truly represents software developed by the Company, these 
capitalized costs should gradually be transferred out of this account once the associated software reaches the post-


development stage and is put into use, and henceforth amortized (or written off if the software is deemed obsolete), thus 
leaving the “Unamortized software” account a relatively steady share of net fixed assets. The transfer of these assets out of the 


“Unamortized software” account, which should be designated specifically for software still under development, should also 
keep this account a relatively steady share of gross fixed assets.


In practice, we observe that this account has grown faster than both Amdocs’ total Computer Equipment (Gross) account and 
its total Fixed Assets (Gross).


We are concerned that Amdocs is not only capitalizing expenses, but parking them in an unamortized account, thus avoiding any expenses 
which it would otherwise incur through either direct expensing or amortization of capitalized costs.


The relative growth in Amdocs’ “Unamortized software assets” would appear not to make sense if the account represented legitimate costs 
related to software currently under development. Software isn’t under development forever, after all (at least it shouldn’t be…).

Accounting Differences Between Subsidiaries 
And Parent Excuses Amdocs Of Amortization


Returning to the statements of the Cyprus subsidiary, we see that the entity does in fact transfer assets from its “Computer 
software under development” account to its “Computer software” account under intangible assets (and writes off software 


when appropriate), and that these transfers represent a significant share of “Computer software under development” each year.
Again, regardless of whether these assets represent internally-developed software or other capitalized costs, the entity 


accounts for them such that they are ultimately amortized (as they should be, if actually representing capitalized software), and 
such that the unamortized “Computer software under development” account remains a steady share of (intangible) assets.


Amdocs, meanwhile, has increasingly packed costs into this unamortized “under development” account without appearing to 
transfer them into an amortized “completed software” account at a rate which we would deem normal or acceptable.

Close Relationship Between Changes In European 
Assets And Changes In Unamortized Software


Interestingly, we observe that the annual change in Amdocs’ unamortized software account is matched closely by the annual 
change in the value of its European assets. This relationship is not shared by assets in other regions. This gives us further


confidence that there is a connection between the otherwise-inexplicable growth of its European asset base and the observed 
growth in its unamortized software account.


Amdocs is ultimately lumping its unamortized software into a “Computer equipment” account of which it makes up a relatively small share 
(about 16% as of Q4 FY 2017), perhaps in an attempt to minimize ostensible red flags. However, when we observe that management may be 


attributing the entire value of its unamortized software to Europe without any apparent rhyme or reason – as though these assets didn’t have 
a region to which they should logically be allocated – serious questions are raised as to the actual contents of this asset category, and as to 


whether these assets in fact represent genuine fixed assets at all.

Inconsistent Accounting Between Software 
And Acquired Items


While Amdocs reports significant unamortized assets related to software under development, it does in fact amortize “Core 
technology” acquired via M&A. Given that this non-hardware technology account is amortized, we wonder: how can Amdocs 


justify not amortizing its increasingly large quantity of internally-developed software?


We also notice that included in the Company’s definite-lived purchased intangible assets is “Intellectual property rights and 
purchased computer software.” We find it odd that Amdocs classifies purchased software as an intangible asset, but internally-
developed software as a fixed asset. Importantly, we note that management amortizes acquired software – and that the acquired 
software which it lists in its financial statements has been unchanged for ten years, and is fully amortized. Best practices would 
dictate that obsolete and fully-amortized software be removed from a company’s financial statements, unless it continues to be 


used in operations – and we struggle to think of an example of decade-old software which is still serviceable.


Acquired “core technology” is amortized –
why not internally-developed software?


Why is this null account still here after ten 
years – since FY 2007 – without change?


We are curious as to why management has chosen to leave this null account on its statements for a decade, unchanged.

Non-Transparent Capex Facilitates Inappropriate 
Capitalization While Obfuscating Earnings And FCF


We would perhaps be able to audit Amdocs’ cost capitalization more effectively if it provided greater detail on capex in its 
financial statements. Unfortunately, the Company has historically disclosed only net capex on its cash flow statement, and has 


not broken out changes in PP&E attributable to asset disposals.


This is particularly noteworthy given that, as revealed by Amdocs’ notes on equipment and leasehold improvements, it is clear
that management is in fact disposing of fixed assets, whether through write-offs or asset sales. We observe that Amdocs’ gross 


computer equipment has declined in a number of recent periods, revealing disposals of computer equipment or software 
reported under this account. We also observe that accumulated depreciation has declined in a number of recent periods, 


suggesting that the Company has rid itself of heavily-depreciated assets. If these changes represent legitimate asset sales, we 
doubt that the Company is getting much in return for what are mostly depreciated assets. Accordingly, we consider these 


closer to write-downs than to legitimate asset sales, and wonder why management is not reporting gains or loses.

Effects Of Capex Treatment On Financial Statements


Effective Asset Write-Downs Kept 
Out Of Income Statement


• Disposals of assets which are no longer of economic benefit to the Company should flow through the income 
statement as a write-off, depressing Company earnings if sold at a loss. By sequestering these asset disposals 
in “net capex,” management appears to be inflating earnings on its income statement.


Net Capex Obfuscates Cost 
Capitalization And Underlying FCF


• When management disposes of assets which are not yet fully depreciated, its net PP&E account decreases. 
Net capex is thus deflated, flattering reported free cash flow.

Proof That Any Asset Sales Are Hidden 
Within Net Capex


Until FY 2010, when Amdocs first began to report net capex in place of gross capex – and, interestingly, when Eli Gelman took 
over as CEO – management did in fact disclose proceeds from fixed asset sales, alongside the associated gains / losses. When 
the accounting changed in FY 2010, the Company’s reported capex figures for FY 2008-09 were amended by precisely the value 
of previously-reported proceeds from asset sales. This is proof that Amdocs defines net capex as gross capex less proceeds 


from asset sales – and, therefore, that management is deflating reported capex by baking in disposals.


We conclude that management’s choice to omit proceeds from asset sales from Amdocs’ cash flow statement does not imply 
that the Company no longer sells assets. Further, we note that the aforementioned declines in gross PP&E and accumulated 
depreciation cannot necessarily be attributed to asset retirements alone: they may be the product of unreported asset sales.

Capex And PP&E Treatment Do Not Conform 
To GAAP Standards


If these asset disposals do in fact represent legitimate asset sales rather than hidden write-offs, Amdocs is not accounting for
them correctly. According to GAAP standards, assets which are held for sale, but which are not associated with discontinued 
operations, are to be reported separately from other PP&E. By not breaking these assets out, management deflates reported 


(net) capex as it gradually disposes of these assets, thereby flattering free cash flow.


In the context of Amdocs’ other accounting obfuscations, the decision not to break these assets out appears suspicious to us.

Management Now Further Obfuscating Its 
Presentation of Capital Expenditures….


In its recently-published FY 2018 20-F, management removed the “net” qualifier altogether from the capex line in its cash flow 
statement. However, the capex figures which it reports for prior years have remained the same, implying that it continues to 


account for capex in the same manner as it did in prior years, when capex was described as “net” capex.


By failing to include the “net” qualifier, management is potentially leading investors to believe that it is disclosing gross capex, 
as “Purchase of property and equipment” represents generic cash flow statement language which generally refers to gross 


capex in a typical company’s financial statements.

Asset Disposals Potentially Highly Significant


Though Amdocs does not disclose its proceeds from asset sales (nor that it sells assets at all), it does leave us a clue in the 
form of changes in accumulated depreciation: we can identify the cost basis of fixed assets removed from the balance sheet. 


Without more detail, we can’t know the extent to which these asset removals can be attributed to asset sales, which would 
generate (undisclosed) cash inflows, and the extent to which they can be attributed to the retirement of depreciated assets, 


which would not be a source of cash. However, based on the past relationship between changes in accumulated depreciation 
and proceeds from asset disposals, dating to when Amdocs still disclosed proceeds from asset sales, we can estimate 


Amdocs’ present proceeds from asset sales.

Non-Disclosed Asset Sales Could Have Materially 
Inflated Free Cash Flow Since FY 2016


We note that, while the preceding estimates are plausible, it may be inappropriate to extrapolate asset sale proceeds from removed 
accumulated depreciation in FY 2016-18, given the sudden uncharacteristic growth in accumulated depreciation removals. Using a 
simpler but perhaps less precise estimate based on gross PP&E, we see that proceeds from asset sales could still have been ~$8M 


annually through the last several years.


We also note that, though Amdocs reported an average gain on asset sales of zero through the years during which it reported this
item, management could now plausibly use hidden gains on asset sales to inflate operating income.

More Evidence of Capex And PP&E Accounting 
Problems Indicated By Depreciation Discrepancy


At best an error, at worst more evidence of financial control issues around Capex and PP&E reveled by inaccurate depreciation
expense. We note that the respective full-year cash flow statements on its most recent Q4 6-K press release and 20-F show a 


number of discrepancies which were never explained by management.


Oddly, despite the discrepancies between multiple unrelated accounts, the items in both cash flow statements sum to the same quantity of 
operating cash flow. In other words, the inconsistencies between unrelated accounts across both cash flow statements sum to exactly zero.


This appears suspiciously convenient to us. If these inconsistencies represent honestly misreported numbers which were ultimately revised 
on the 20-F, it is extremely unlikely that the independent discrepancies would offset exactly. We are concerned that these changes could be 


the product of accounting manipulation.

Curious Land Deal And Financing Cover-Up 
For A New Israeli Campus


Despite a majority of its workforce and customers not being in Israel, on Sept 2017, Amdocs announced plans to construct a new 
campus in Israel and that the costs “are not expected to have a material impact on Amdocs’ cash position or operating results.” 


It issued guidance projecting $100M in incremental capex on the campus in FY 18, all to be financed internally. However, in 
Amdocs’ FY 17 20-F, management noted that it entered into a joint venture with Israel’s Union Group (“Union”) to acquire land for 
the campus, and that, as the controlling party, Amdocs would consolidate the JV’s financials in its own statements. Later, in Q1
FY 18, Amdocs showed a $48M cash inflow from “issuance of shares and loan proceeds” related to the JV and later restated to 


“investment by noncontrolling interest”. Didn’t management say it would finance the campus internally?


“So I should see in your modeling – we expect to 
generate FCF of roughly $400M in FY 2018, taking 
into account incremental capital expenditure up to 
$100M associated with the multiyear development 
of our new campuses in Israel. Normalizing for this 
capital expenditure, we expect FCF of roughly 
$500M in FY 2018….”


“This investment, if consummated, will be financed 
from internal cash resources”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


Q4 FY 2017 Earnings Call


The $48M from Union effectively represents a discreet loan which management was able to secure without having to lever up its balance 
sheet in a more transparent way. Interestingly, while management first referred to this cash inflow as a loan, it quickly changed this 


language just two weeks later. Management clearly does NOT want you thinking that the Company took on debt, even if only marginally.


We also note that any cash held by the JV would be fully integrated into Amdocs’ statements, thereby artificially inflating Amdocs’ apparent 
cash position.

Inconsistent Capex Accounting For Israeli Campus:
Is It Just A Black Box For Cost Capitalization?


With evidence that the business is under pressure, we find it odd that Amdocs is investing $350M in a fancy new HQ.
We suspect that the Company may be treating its campus-related spending as, in part, a “black box” capex item into which it can 


funnel more capitalized costs under investors’ noses. Contributing to our suspicion is the fact that management has been 
extremely inconsistent in its accounting for campus-related spending, which has been reported as low as ~$50M to as high as 


$103M. So how much did Amdocs really spend on the campus in FY 2018? $103M? $102M? $98M? $96M? $50M? (1)
Why can’t management get this straight?


“FCF was $113M in Q1. This was 
comprised of cash flow from operations of 
approximately $165M, less $52M in net 
capex and other, of which $13M related to

Did Amdocs Construction Partner Clarifies The 
Capex, And Still Leaves A Big Hole To Fill


As further evidence to suggest capital expenditure inflation, we note that Amdocs construction partner Electra Group made a 
filing on TASE that indicated the four offices and development of three underground floors would cost NIS 300m or 


approximately US$ 90 million. Amdocs has already incurred approximately $100m for the land and development in FY 2018.  
What is accounting for the other $160m of estimated costs to hit the $350m total cost forecast?

A New HQ First Described As Having No Material 
Impact Only To Have A Material Accretive Impact To 
EPS? Creative Tax Planning At Work…


Spruce Point has never seen a company refer to the construction of office space as “accretive to EPS,” especially 
after first claiming the project would not have a material effect on operating results. It then later buried details deep in 
its tax notes that it booked a $23.1m tax benefit (subsequently increased to $28.8m by year end) related to the funding 


decision for the new campus – allowing DOX to inflate FY 2018 GAAP EPS by nearly 12% by our estimate.


We later examine DOX’s repeated patterns of net tax benefits to inflate GAAP EPS.


“This investment, if consummated, will be financed 
from internal cash resources. Moreover, we believe 
our decision to build a new campus will be accretive 
to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share over the 
long term and is a reflection of our confidence in the 
future success of Amdocs.”

the construction of the Company’s new campus in Israel, see 
also Note 2, the Company recorded a tax benefit of 
$28,795 related to the release of withholding and income tax 
reserves for unremitted earnings.”


“During the three months ended December 31, 2017, as a 
result of funding decisions for the construction of the 
Company’s new campus in Israel (see Note 1) the Company 
recorded a tax benefit of $23,099 related to the release of 
withholding and income tax reserves for pre-2018 unremitted 
earnings”


“Amdocs is currently evaluating various alternatives with respect 
to the future development and construction of the new campus, 
including structures for ownership or long-term lease 
arrangements. The acquisition costs are not expected to have a 
material impact on Amdocs’ cash position or operating results.”

Further Inconsistencies In Campus-Related 
Accounting


We also observe that Amdocs shows glaring inconsistencies in its accounting for the Union loan between its balance sheet 
and cash flow statement. Although its JV with Union is discussed as a 50/50 venture, Amdocs has received cash inflows 
greater than the balance sheet value of the non-controlling interest. We find it particularly odd that, in Q2, management 


adjusted both the Q1 cash inflow and the balance sheet value of the NCI.

At best, the inconsistencies in Amdocs’ accounting for the campus-related capex and the Union loan reveal remarkable sloppiness by 
management. At worst, they could suggest dishonest accounting designed to hide borrowing and spending behavior.

the details of the Union loan 


as reported in Q2?

Limited Balance Sheet Flexibility Despite
No Long-Term Debt


Does Amdocs still have capacity to grow through M&A? The Company is generally cash-generative despite its flat growth, and 
it has no long-term debt on its balance sheet (excluding the effective loan related to the Union JV). However, we note that its 


cash balance has been declining steadily since FY 2015, to the point where the Company is extremely close to its stated 
minimum gross cash balance of $500M.1 Never in recent history has it been so close to this level. We also note that, according 


to management, it is imperative that Amdocs maintain a strong balance sheet to present an image of financial stability to 
customers, as it plays a vital role in telcos’ IT infrastructure.

Management’s Q4 FY 2018 earnings call was the first time in recent history that it openly and explicitly discussed the possibility of going 
into debt to support M&A. While this reveals that the Company is willing to lever up its balance sheet – for which it appears to have ample 
capacity – we question how much capacity Amdocs’ balance sheet actually has in practice, given its historical reluctance to go into debt 


and its commitment to maintaining a relatively robust cash balance.

Management Becoming Less And Less 
Committal Regarding Capital Allocation Plans


Management’s own language in its discussions of capital allocation suggests that it questions its ability to support both M&A
and share repurchases / dividends simultaneously. After guiding to spending “roughly half” of long-term free cash flow on 


M&A and other growth initiatives through the first half of the decade, management later walked this figure back to “a portion” 
as its cash balance declined. It now states that it expects to return “a majority” of FCF (“100%” of FCF before campus-related 


spending last year) to shareholders over the long-term, and that any M&A would cut into capital returns.


FY 2015 20-F


FY 2016 20-F


FY 2017 20-F


Note that these disclosures discuss Amdocs’ long-term capital allocation plans, not just its plans for the coming year.


In just two years, management went from envisioning spending 50% of long-term free cash flow on M&A and other growth initiatives to 
planning to return nearly all long-term free cash flow to shareholders, in the context of spending a relatively steady $450-550M on buybacks / 


dividends annually. Just as the Company reaches a size at which continued M&A-fueled growth would require even larger deals, 
management is communicating that it no longer has sufficient cash flow to consistently support M&A from FCF on top of its fairly consistent 


$450-550M return of cash to shareholders, and that any M&A would have to come out of buybacks / dividends (if not the balance sheet).

Management Becoming Increasingly Less Committal 
Regarding Both M&A And Dividends / Buybacks


Again, as recently as FY 2015, management was extremely explicit about its long-term capital allocation plans: half of FCF 
would be put towards M&A and other growth initiatives, and the other half would be returned to shareholders. Now, not only 


does management no longer believe that it can consistently fund M&A from FCF on top of buybacks and dividends, but it has 
also loosened its language regarding buybacks and dividends, suggesting that its commitment to returning cash to 


shareholders may be wavering unless it is prepared to employ its balance sheet.


Management says that “we have the capacity to
return the majority of free cash flow to 


shareholders…,” NOT “we will return” or “we 
plan to return…,” as it has said in the past.


It also openly says that any M&A draw away 
from buybacks / dividends.


Q4 FY 2018 Earnings Call


“…we remain committed to the proactive and disciplined 
allocation of capital. We have the capacity to return the 
majority of normalized free cash flow to shareholders 
in fiscal 2019, subject to factors such as M&A, 
financial markets and prevailing industry conditions. I 
am pleased to say this includes a proposed increase in 
the quarterly cash dividend for the sixth consecutive year, 
subject to shareholder approval in the annual general 
meeting in January 2019. Additionally, we retain the 
optionality to execute on M&A strategically for long-
term goals, possibly utilizing debt where appropriate.”
- Shuky Sheffer, CEO, Amdocs


Source: Amdocs 2018 Investor Day – Financial Outlook & Investment Thesis Slides


Management does not commit to conducting M&A, but instead says that it has 
“optionality to execute M&A,” and says that it may have to assume debt to do so.

Limited Capacity For All Capital Allocation 
Initiatives


Management states that it intends to redistribute ~100% of free cash flow, excluding its spending on its Israeli campus, on 
buybacks and dividends. With the Company already at its cash balance minimum, management must finance any further spending 
on the campus and on M&A with debt, or else cut its return of capital to shareholders. If we assume that management continues to


redistribute 100% of FCF to shareholders – a plausible assumption, as FCF has not grown materially despite continued 
acquisitions, and as management is likely reluctant to reduce its buybacks / dividends – then the following calculations give us an 


estimate of Amdocs’ capacity for future M&A.


Acquisition Capacity Estimate


($, Millions) FY 2018 / Run Rate Estimate

Debt Capacity For Future M&A $816

Potential Inorganic Sales $355


% of FY 2018 Sales 8.9%


Implied 3-Year CAGR 2.9%


Implied 4-Year CAGR 2.2%


We estimate that, assuming management has tolerance for 
conservative leverage, Amdocs has sufficient debt capacity to 
grow sales by 2.9% annually over three years via acquisitions 


even if it records 0% organic growth.


While Amdocs does therefore have capacity to support 
measured growth via M&A, we suspect that management would 


be forced to address the impending strain at least a year in 
advance, whether by assuming even greater debt (potentially 


turning off customers who value its strong balance sheet), 
reducing buybacks / dividends (turning off investors), or cutting 


back on M&A (threatening sales growth).


Either way, assuming that the industry continues to show ~0% 
annual growth, management is just ~1-2 years away from having 


to address its underlying problems.

Net Change in Working Capital


Cash Flow Driven By Working Capital Spend 
Signals Percentage-Of-Completion Concerns


Management’s decision to begin to draw from its cash pile in FY 2015 was in part forced upon it by poor cash flow. We observe
that, despite consistent acquisition-driven top-line growth, cash flow has generally contracted since FY 2015: OCF and FCF 
generally grew on an annual basis through the first half of the decade, but both have been in decline since. Importantly, with 


the exception of the FY 2018 contraction – which was driven in part by restructuring costs and management’s spending on its 
new Israeli campus – the multi-year cash flow contraction can be attributed entirely to changes in working capital, which were 


positive and growing until FY 2016, but which have since turned increasingly negative.


Investors should pay attention to trends in Amdocs’ working capital spend given that a material share of Company revenue is accounted for 
using the percentage-of-completion method. Company filings state that “a significant portion of the Company’s revenue” is accounted for 


using this method (source). We estimate that at least 30-50% of Company revenue could be recorded under percentage-of-completion 
accounting, as a quarter of firm revenues are derived from modernization projects and other similar one-off engagements – which are 


accounted for using percentage-of-completion – and as Amdocs’ financial statements indicate that a variety of managed services revenues 
are accounted for in the same manner. Our conversations with people familiar with the business suggest that this estimate could be 


conservative.

Unbilled Receivables as a % of Quarterly Revenue

Working Capital Trends Potentially Indicative Of 
Stretched Revenue Growth & Aggressive Accounting


Amdocs’ working capital trends may suggest that management is taking advantage of percentage-of-completion accounting to 
recognize revenue aggressively. DSOs have grown at ~10% YoY through the past several quarters and at ~8% since FY 2015-


16, perhaps revealing that management is recognizing revenue more aggressively on percentage-of-completion projects. 


More benignly, this trend could simply indicate that an increasing share of Amdocs revenue is accounted for on a percentage-
of-completion basis, perhaps because industry consolidation has increased the demand for modernization projects and other 


one-off, non-recurring engagements. However, if this were the case, we would expect to see other working capital accounts 
related to percentage-of-completion accounting increase at a similar rate: Billed DSOs would grow at a similar rate as Unbilled 
DSOs, Deferred Revenue Days would grow at a similar rate as total DSOs, etc. Instead, what we see in Amdocs is that Unbilled 
DSOs have doubled since FY 2016 while Billed Receivables Days have remained largely flat, and total DSOs have grown at an 
~8% annual rate each quarter while both Deferred Revenue Days and DSOs for Allowances for Bad Debts have been halved 


since FY 2016. These are not signs of more percentage-of-completion-based sales – these are signs of aggressive accounting.

Percentage-Of-Completion Aggressiveness 
May Create Material Revenue For Amdocs


The preceding analysis gives us a clearer understanding of Amdocs’ cash flow trends: though sales have grown at a steady, 
low-single-digit rate through the last several years, sales growth has not translated into cash flow growth because it was 


supported by revenue drawn from projects which had not yet been billed, and from receipts which had already been paid but 
for which revenue had yet to be recognized.1 As shown below, these non-cash, percentage-of-completion-related items 


contributed material revenue to Amdocs in some quarters. This isn’t to suggest that all such revenues were ill-gotten, but the 
magnitude of the contribution is concerning in context.


At best, this is a sign of an unhealthy business whose struggling telecom customers are not paying in timely manner. At worst, 
it is a sign of a business which is deliberately taking advantage of percentage-of-completion accounting to make up for 


deficient sales growth. Rising DSOs could point to either, but rising DSOs combined with falling Allowances for Bad Debts and
rapidly declining Deferred Revenue would appear to point to the latter.


1. Also of note: Sales growth has also not always translated into earnings growth due in part to the rapid growth in amortization associated with acquisitions and associated intangible assets.

Changes in percentage-of-completion-related balance sheet accounts contributed more than 2.5% of quarterly revenue four times since Q1 
FY 2016, and more than 5% three times, contributing up to 7.8% in Q3 FY 2016.


If Amdocs can manage to grow sales only through M&A and aggressive percentage-of-completion accounting, yet earnings growth remains 
muted due in part to acquisition-related amortization, and cash flow growth muted due to working capital changes, we question whether this 


manufactured top-line growth is of any real value to investors.
74


Aggressive Accounting Straight Out of 
1999-2002 Playbook


Remarkably, the plaintiffs in the 2002 class action case identified precisely the same signs of aggressive accounting which we 
observe today. This gives us confidence that these patterns are not merely an anomaly, but signs of real strain, and perhaps an 


indication that management is taking measures to hide revenue contraction similar to those which it took during the dot com bust.

Margins More Naturally Variable After 
Percentage-Of-Completion Adjustments


We also note that Amdocs demonstrates extremely steady margins, both operating and gross – far too steady, in our opinion, 
for a business which is heavily-acquisitive and which should have some degree of operating leverage. When percentage-of-


completion items are netted out of revenue, and the corresponding gross profit netted out of EBIT, patterns in the Company’s 
operating margins appear much more natural and less suspicious. However, margins are most likely as steady as they are 
precisely because percentage-of-completion accounting permits management flexibility in how it matches expenses with 


revenues, in some ways permitting highly-manufactured margins.

We believe that Amdocs’ unusually steady margins are 
reflective of a management team eager to meet Wall 


Street expectations, and willing to engineer numbers to 
do so if necessary.


Discussions with former employees have revealed that 
Amdocs management is intensely focused on meeting 


Street numbers and is “aggressive” and “militaristic” in 
its efforts to satisfy analysts (see later slides).

Amdocs May Be Expanding Its Use Of 
Percentage-Of-Completion Accounting


In a subtle yet interesting change to Amdocs’ 20-F, management potentially revealed that it is applying percentage-of-
completion accounting methods to a wider range of projects – not just “long-term” projects. We are concerned that this could 


give the Company more opportunities to pull forward revenue and to delay expenses, and perhaps that management is 
applying percentage-of-completion accounting more widely precisely for this reason.

We also note that accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued personnel costs have been a material source of operating 
cash flow for Amdocs through the last several years, consistently providing close to 10% of Amdocs’ operating cash flow. 


Accrued expenses in particular have ballooned of late. We do not believe that this is a healthy, sustainable source of cash flow
for a company experiencing stagnant revenue growth and financial strain.


Also of note is that management has accounted for these items in a non-transparent and inconsistent manner, making it more 
difficult for investors to evaluate them critically.

Receivable Factoring Further Evidence Of 
Financial Strain


Finally, and importantly, we note that the Company disclosed receivables factoring in FY 2018 for the first time. We are 
concerned not only by the fact that management engaged in yet another unhealthy form of cash generation to support its 


increasingly strained cash position, but that it did so through a non-transparent financing channel. Management is going to 
lengths to bolster its stagnant cash flow as its capacity for M&A becomes constrained, as well as to support its declining cash 


balance without having to take on debt by resorting to surreptitious borrowing.


Amdocs does not break out the extent of its factoring on its 20-F. However, we note that its AT&T receivables would be a strong 
candidate for factoring, as AT&T is a relatively creditworthy company with limited delinquency risk, which would reduce 


factoring costs for its receivables. We also find it curious that AT&T’s DSOs declined despite rising total DSOs for Amdocs, and
despite tepid sales growth at AT&T– we would expect AT&T to be paying its vendors more slowly given its own performance.

Firm-Wide DSOs (B) 82 89 7


DSO Change Difference ((A) - (B)) (12)


AT&T Revenue $1,276 $1,085


Factored Receivables Estimate $36


For factoring of AT&T receivables to have been responsible for the 
difference between the 5-day decline in AT&T DSOs and the 7-day 


increase in firm-wide DSOs – a difference of 12 DSOs – we estimate 
that Amdocs would have had to factor $36M of AT&T receivables.


This represents 7% of Amdocs’ operating cash flow.


We suspect that management factored an average of $5-10M in 
receivables on a quarterly basis.


However, we call on management to disclose the exact extent of its 
factoring in future filings.

Questionable One-Time Tax Items Keep Tax 
Expenses In Check


Amdocs reports annual tax rates of ~15%, ostensibly due to its incorporation in the tax haven of Guernsey. However, we note that
management consistently recognizes one-time tax-related gains which lower the Company’s tax expense materially.


These items are almost always buried in footnotes and not explained comprehensively, and many appear to be highly 
questionable in nature.

Adjusting For One-Off Net Tax Benefits 
Reduces EPS By 11-15%


When we adjust for Amdocs’ questionable one-off tax benefits, the Company’s effective tax rate grows from its observed level 
of ~15% to a more realistic ~26%. EPS falls by ~15% after we apply our adjustments.


As we find these one-off tax benefits highly questionable and potentially not reflective of Amdocs’ normalized earnings power, 
we believe that our tax-adjusted EPS figure is more reflective of true Company earnings.

Difficult-To-Explain Borrowing Behavior
And Investment Activity


Amdocs has no long-term debt and has been debt-free since the 2000s, and has historically maintained a strong cash balance 
of over $1B. However, since the late 2000s, management has made a practice of borrowing ~$200M only to repay it within just 
several weeks at most. This was historically done at fiscal year-end until FY 2017, when management began instead to borrow 


from Q2 into Q3.


Management also appears to be “churning” short-term investments: the Company reports “Proceeds from sale of short-term 
interest-bearing investments” and “Purchase of short-term interest-bearing investments” in almost identical quantities on a 


quarterly basis, offsetting each other almost exactly and thus leaving Amdocs’ “Short-term interest-bearing” balance sheet line 
item effectively untouched. Only in Q2 FY 2018 did these values begin to diverge, as management divested of short-term 


assets and burned cash to finance the new Israeli campus.

Short-Term Borrowing Inflates Year-End
(Or Mid-Year) Cash Position


It’s important to emphasize the impact of management’s short-term borrowing on Amdocs’ statements: through most of the 
last decade, the Company’s year-end cash balance has been artificially inflated by borrowing behavior which has no apparent 


strategic purpose, given that the borrowed cash is returned within just weeks.


Short-Term Borrowing (Cash Flow Statement)


Beginning in Q4 FY 10, Amdocs’ cash position was inflated by up to $200-250M in Q4 of each fiscal year, only to fall by a similar amount in 
the following Q1. This artificially improved Amdocs’ apparent year-end cash position and obfuscated the effect of M&A on its balance sheet.

Is Management Engaging In Financial 
Engineering To Avoid PFIC Tax Status?


Management has been questioned about its short-term borrowing only once – in Q4 FY 2012 – and has yet to provide a 
sufficient explanation for it, ascribing it to anything from “tactical financing purposes” to “short-term funding purposes” to 


“cash efficiency.” Other sources suggest that Amdocs may be taking out short-term loans for tax-related purposes.


We believe that management may be performing this maneuver to avoid falling under the IRS’s definition of a “passive foreign 
investment company” (“PFIC”), whose shareholders are liable for higher-than-usual taxes upon the sale of shares or “the 


receipt of certain distributions.” By artificially shifting the structure of its balance sheet in certain quarters, Amdocs may be 
altering its PFIC status.


Amdocs added a risk factor to this effect in its 2016 20-F (see below), suggesting that management may feel that it is at risk of 
running up against the IRS’s PFIC parameters.


New As Of FY 2016 20-F


If Amdocs is artificially manipulating its balance sheet to avoid PFIC status, it is not unthinkable that this action could be viewed by the IRS 
as a form of tax evasion on behalf of investors. We call on management to explain its odd financial behavior and to provide greater 


transparency into these activities going forward.


“Our cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter was 
approximately $1.4B. However, this includes the 
benefit of $200M that we drew down on our credit 
facility for tactical financing purposes in 
September. We have since repaid the $200M, which 
was only outstanding for a few weeks. Our net cash, 
therefore, was just over $1.2B on September 30.”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs

EPS Assessment With Comprehensive 
Adjustments


If we adjust Amdocs’ EPS for its percentage-of-completion items and 75% of newly-capitalized software, on the assumption that 75% of the 
change in the unamortized software account represents capitalized costs – we observe that Amdocs EPS could have been overstated by up 
to 15% if the observed percentage-of-completion items represent improperly pulled-forward sales. Instead, if we adjust only for potentially 


improperly-capitalized software costs, EPS could still be overstated by 5%.

Odd Company With An Odd Structure


While the below considerations are not necessarily inherently dubious, we find some of these facts interesting in context.


Topic Discussion


Domicile and 
Location


• Domiciled in the tax haven of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands
• Composed of network of global subsidiaries, many in other tax havens such as Cyprus and Ecuador
• The Company was founded in Israel (see below) and its executives have historically been Israeli


• A fairly common employee complaint on employer review websites (Glassdoor, etc.) is that there is a strong disconnect between lower-
level and upper-level employees, which is perhaps to be expected given the geographic disjointedness of the organization


• Most employees are located in call centers in India
• Does most of its business (>60% of sales) in North America, and headquarters is located in Chesterfield, MO. However, its largest corporate office 


is located in Israel. Its largest office spaces are in India, where its call centers are located.


History and
Leadership


• Founded in Israel in 1982 as spinoff of Israeli phone directory Golden Pages to develop billing software for phone directory businesses
• Grew through early 1990s by providing similar services to telecom businesses. Company performance has been closely tied to the performance of 


the telecom industry ever since.
• Listed on NYSE in June 1998
• Owns many subsidiary businesses which it has added through M&A over the years, but which appear to continue to operate as almost


autonomous units with limited connection to the rest of the business. Appear to have been acquired primarily for cross-selling opportunities 
rather than full integration (see prior slides).


• Major executives have almost all been Israeli and have generally been “connected insiders” with strong historical ties to the company
• Example: Recently-retired CEO Eli Gelman


• Various positions with Amdocs since the 1980s
• Amdocs Director Since 2002
• Executive VP from 2002-08. COO from 2006-08.
• 2001-10: Semi-retirement
• 2010: Hired as President and CEO with the retirement of Dov Baharav in 2002
• Retired in late 2018. Replaced by Shuky Sheffer, another Israeli with 20 years’ experience with Amdocs.


• Example: New CEO Shuky Sheffer
• Manager and executive at Amdocs from 1986 to 2009
• Appointed CEO of Retalix in 2009 after it was acquired by group of Amdocs founders, including Eli Gelman (source)
• Returned to Amdocs in 2013 after Retalix’s buyout by NCR


• We find it interesting that Amdocs not only tends to hire from a pool of “connected insiders,” but that it has gone so far as to bring 
former directors and executives out of retirement to fill roles rather than seek capable outsiders

Insider Ownership Near All-Time Lows


Insiders have sold heavily since the Company first went public in 1998, profiting heavily from the IPO and from subsequent 
stock sales. Insider ownership now stands at a paltry 1.5%, meaning that insiders have little at risk if the Company fails.


This could also incentivize management to engage in aggressive accounting and deal-making to keep the stock afloat, collect 
higher salaries, and preserve its lifestyle. We will detail one such example related to our concerns about options appearing to 


be granted in-the-money.

Company Management Kept Within 
Close-Knit Israeli Inner Circle


Although Amdocs is domiciled in Guernsey, does most of its business in the U.S., and has most of its employees in India, 
Company management is located in Israel, and most executives are Israelis who have been with the Company for years – many 


since its early days in the 1980s. Former employees report that management is generally not open to, or transparent with, the rest 
of the Company, and that employees who are not Israeli or otherwise willing to spend time working in Israel see limited 


opportunities to progress within the organization. Our calls with former employees suggest that its culture has gotten worse over 
the last several years. That Company management is kept within the hands of a tight-knit Israeli team located far from the rest of 


the business, and that it offers limited visibility into managerial decisions among people outside of this network, is a red flag to us.

Audit Committee And Auditor Stability Could 
Prevent Malfeasance From Being Discovered


As an important component of executive oversight, we expect to see companies rotate the composition of the audit committee and 
auditor with some frequency. We find that Amdocs’s audit committee (and its auditor E&Y) shows strikingly low turnover in over 20 


years. With the exception of Robert Minicucci, who first joined the committee in FY 2018 (but who has been a director since FY 
1999), the average term length for members of the audit committee has been ~8 years since FY 1999. Notably, Adrian Gardner has 
been on the committee every single year since FY 1999, It is highly unusual for a Director to sit on a single committee for such an 
extended period. Meanwhile, Ceridian CEO Lawrence Perlman who served with Gardner from IPO inception, was charged with a 


$100m software cost development capitalization accounting scheme.

Deeply-Ingrained Clubby, Top-Heavy Culture


We get another window into Amdocs’ clubby culture through the existence of “Afterdox” – an Israeli angel investment group 
composed largely of former Amdocs executives which invests in early-stage Israeli tech companies. We find it interesting that 


Amdocs executives continue to invest with each other after leaving the Company, and feel that this does not reflect well on how 
they may treat their stewardship of Amdocs – perhaps less as people building a company for the long-term than people looking to 


get a return on their personal investment, maybe through financial engineering if necessary.

Aggressive Management Focused On Meeting 
Wall Street Expectations


Former employees have also indicated to us that management is unusually conscious of Wall Street expectations, and aggressive
in pushing to meet them. Amdocs has a “good reputation for effective implementation,” but this is due in part to a “militaristic


culture and approach” driven by a strong desire to meet numbers, which at times “comes at the expense of long-term planning.” 
The Company is reportedly strict with customers and attempts to push through business as quickly as possible before quarter-


end. These insights are further corroborated by comments by current and former employees on sites such as Glassdoor.

2002 Lawsuit Accusations Also Reflected 
Aggressive, Secretive Management


We note that, based on the accusations made by investors in the 2002 lawsuit, it seems that little has changed at Amdocs HQ. 
Management was similarly aggressive in looking to meet growth targets in the early 2000s, and was similarly clubby and secretive. 
Given the indications of strain at Amdocs noted throughout this report, we worry that management is once again taking steps to 
hide underlying business weakness while secretly enriching itself, until it runs out of available levers to prop up the Company.

Non-Transparent Compensation Scheme


Unlike most companies, and deviating from SEC guidelines, Amdocs provides limited details regarding executive or director 
remuneration on its proxy statement. It does provide aggregate remuneration on its 20-F, but does not break out individual 


compensation details (base salaries, etc.), nor does it provide any information regarding incentive bonuses targets or metrics. 
We find this highly unusual and not in-line with best practices, to say the least.


Why doesn’t Amdocs provide details on individual remuneration for directors and executives more in line with other publicly-traded 
companies?


Why doesn’t it provide details on executive incentive criteria?

Director Allegedly Involved In Stock Option 
Backdating Scheme


Current Amdocs Director Giora Yaron was named in a 2008 SEC complaint alleging that he and two other directors of Mercury 
Interactive (“Mercury”) approved backdated stock option grants.  The case was settled “without admitting or denying the 


allegations in the SEC's complaint” and resulted in Yaron being fined.  Yaron’s association with Mercury Interactive is 
conveniently omitted from his public biography on DOX’s website. The SEC alleged that, between 1997 and 2002 – the same 


years through which Yaron served on Mercury’s audit and compensation committees – the Board approved options which were 
backdated to times at which Mercury stock had reached a relative low point. Yaron’s association with Amdocs, for which he has


served as a director since 2009, is concerning to us.

Fair Value Per Option


Is Amdocs Engaging In Its Own Options 
Shenanigans?


Through the last several years, the number of options granted to management has fallen precipitously. At the same time, we observe that the 
average option value has risen steadily, even in the face of falling expected volatility. With all other disclosed material determinants of option value 
largely unchanged through the same period (including option term), we believe that the increase in option values indicates that management may 
be issuing options which are in-the-money from inception. This is an inherently bearish signal that management is receiving more ITM options.


It also appears that management may be issuing itself options with increasingly favorable terms. We note that management has become 
increasingly good at locking in a consistent premium with its option grants: since FY 2016, the weighted average strike price of options 
granted to management has hovered curiously close to a 5% discount to DOX’s average annual share price. This discount has grown 


steadily over the same period. We also wonder why management granted itself options with an average strike price >5% below the strike 
price of those granted to other employees in FY 2018.

Detailed Exercise Price of Issued Options No 
Longer Being Disclosed By Management


Just as average stock option values began to grow despite declining expected volatility, management began to withhold 
details from its annual stock option incentive disclosure. The following schedule detailing the breakdown of Amdocs’ 


outstanding stock options by exercise price last appeared in the Company’s financial statements in FY 2014. The previously-
noted questionable trends in expected volatility and average option fair value began in FY 2015, the first year in which this


schedule was omitted from Amdocs’ 20-F.


If Amdocs is in fact granting a greater share of options in-the-money, the omission of this table would allow management to do 
so without tipping its hand.


Issuing in-the-money stock options gives executives more downside protection when DOX’s share price declines. If management is in fact 
issuing in-the-money options, it would suggest a strongly bearish signal. Executives would also have less incentive to increase shareholder 
value with less skin in the game. By omitting the table below, investors cannot see where exercise prices and grants are being concentrated.

Management Uses Uncommon Attribution Method 
For Options, Potentially Enabling Quicker Divestment


Further, Amdocs uses an uncommon and non-transparent attribution method to account for options. The Company claims that 
it amortizes options over a weighted average period of one year using the “graded vesting attribution method,” which generally 


gives management greater discretion in how it amortizes stock options. Our research shows that only three S&P 500 
companies claim to use this method to account for stock options, and that none amortize associated costs over just one year.


Management claims that the awards vest over “a period of three to four years,” and that stock options have ten-year terms. 
We believe that the manner in which Amdocs amortizes these costs should match the economic substance of the awards.


FY 2018 20-F


We would expect to see startups issuing front-loaded options to attract strong talent and expensing costs quickly – not a more mature 
company with established products and customers. We suspect that Amdocs executives may be eager to monetize their options once 


granted, and that they may be making it easy for themselves to do so.

Heavy Selling From A Cryptic Entity Tied To 
Amdocs And The Panama Papers Scandal


Amdocs’ insider selling records include frequent, sizable selling from an entity based in Guernsey and registered in the British
Virgin Islands called “Pines Quest Limited.” We note that this entity sold in remarkable size through 2016-17, in parallel with 
heavy selling from other insiders. Records of Pines Quest Ltd. also appear in the Offshore Leaks Database / Panama Papers.

Toes Corporation 2.0?


Given the size in which the entity is selling, we suspect that Pines Quest may be owned by a group of insiders – likely Amdocs 
executives – who have pooled their DOX holdings in what is effectively a tax-advantaged offshore trust. Interestingly, Amdocs 


executives and other employees were found to have done just this at around the time the Company first went public. In the 
mid-1990s, Amdocs employees formed an entity called “Toes Corporation” on the island of Jersey – another Channel Island 


tax haven – to pool their respective stakes in Amdocs. It was one among several related parties which participated in the IPO, 
earning $22M on the sale of ~1M shares in 1998, and ultimately selling over $200M worth of shares through 2004.1 When 


shareholders sued Amdocs in 2002, included among the allegations was a charge that the Company “misled the market to 
believe that Toes Corporation was merely an unaffiliated shareholder,” not a group of Amdocs employees.2

We note that, while Toes Corporation was listed by name as a beneficial owner in the Automatic Common Exchange Security Trust’s 497

whatsoever: it is neither named explicitly nor referred to by another label.

Executives Possibly Using Pines Quest To Hide 
Insider Selling


We suspect that executives may be pooling their equity in Pines Quest to enable themselves to sell aggressively without 
drawing scrutiny. In particular, we believe that recently-departed CEO Eli Gelman may have sold large quantities of DOX shares 


through Pines Quest. Whereas, per insider selling records, most insiders have sold shares held under their own names at 
regular intervals, we observe only one instance of Gelman selling shares throughout his most recent ~20 year term with 


Amdocs. We would be surprised if he sold shares only once during this period, particularly given management’s historical 
penchant for aggressive selling. The pace of Pines Quest’s selling also parallels Gelman’s tenure with Amdocs: the two-year 
hiatus in the entity’s selling immediately followed Gelman’s return to the Company, whereas its selling accelerated in the final


two years of his second stint. We would expect to see a similar pattern in Gelman’s personal selling if it were disclosed.

What Else Could Management Be Doing? 
Revisiting The 1999-2002 Playbook


Throughout this report, we have noted that management appears to be repeating a number of behaviors of which it was 
accused in the 2002 lawsuit. The plaintiffs in the suit accused Amdocs of a number of other activities – ranging from the 


questionable to the fraudulent – of which we have no immediate evidence, but which nonetheless would not be surprising to 
see the Company have repeated more recently, given our understanding of management’s aggressive and secretive nature. 


Below are a number of the other allegations which were made in the 2002 lawsuit.


As it appears that management could be putting the 1999-2002 playbook back into play, we worry that the Company may be engaging in 
some of the above activities in addition to the observed behaviors noted throughout this report.

Final Food For Thought: Why Does The Head 
of IR Sign Critical Financial Documents?


While most foreign public companies have their 20-F SEC filings signed by their respective CEOs, Amdocs’ filings are signed by 
Secretary Matthew Smith described as an “Authorized Signatory” (and, previously, Elizabeth W. McDermon and Thomas O’Brien 


before Matthew Smith). Why does Amdocs not have a major officer sign its critical 20-F SEC filing? 


What’s even more perplexing, despite having a CFO, Global Treasurer, and US Treasurer and Controller, none of these Amdocs 
representatives sign its credit agreement. 


By not signing these key documents, is DOX management trying to shield itself from key liabilities if material misstatements in 
its SEC and banking agreements were uncovered?

Insider And Institutional Ownership Trends 
Show Waning Confidence In Amdocs


Institutional investors have grown increasingly wary of taking large positions in DOX shares. Outside of Fidelity and (only recently) 
Janus, institutions which once held large positions in Amdocs have more recently been trimming their exposure to the stock. 


Notably, AT&T – still Amdocs’ largest customer by a significant margin – was a large strategic investor in DOX in the past, but has 
not had a >5% position in the stock since 2008. We find it telling that Amdocs’ largest customer no longer has sufficient conviction 


in the Company to maintain its previous levels of share ownership.

While not a heavily-followed name, DOX is generally viewed positively by analysts as a sticky, cash-generative business which 
appears to show steady growth. We believe that the this image is maintained in part by the ambiguity of the Company, which 


makes it difficult for analysts and investors to dig into the business critically without doing a good deal of homework, and thus 
limits the amount of pushback that management might face.


Analysts value the stock within a relatively narrow range, between $70-77, for ~22% upside on an average price target of ~$73.

Amdocs Trades At An Undeserved Material 
Premium To Peers On Most Metrics


Analysts expectations are for moderate top-line organic growth, sustainable margins, and mid-single digit EPS growth. Based on 
our research, Spruce Point believes that DOX has at best no organic sales growth, and at worst declining sales growth. 


Furthermore, we believe aggressive PoC and software development cost accounting appear to be inflating margins and earnings, at 
a time when margins are under pressure from industry and customer-specific (AT&T) problems. Lastly, questionable one-off tax 
adjustments continue to provide material uplift to reported EPS. Digging beneath the surface, we find that DOX is struggling to 


generate free cash flow, as evidenced by A/R factoring, and receiving loans for its new campus despite claiming it could be 
financed internally.  We believe free cash has been declining, and appears to be aided by asset sales obfuscated by DOX’s 


reporting of “net capex”.  As a result, we attempt to adjust Street estimates for these factors that appear to be inflating DOX’s 
results. We believe that DOX should not trade at a material premium to midcap technology and business process outsourcing 


(BPO) peers as a result of its opaque and complex structure, below avg growth, accounting and governance concerns.

We believe CSG is the best peer to DOX because it too is concentrated on billing and support solutions to the telecom/media industries. Analysts correctly view it as a declining top and bottom line story.

Spruce Point Sees 25% to 50% Downside To 
DOX – But Potentially More Going Forward


As we’ve demonstrated, Amdocs is at best a no-growth company, and at worst declining organically. If it received a multiple in-
line with peers to reflect this reality at 1.0x-1.5x its share price would be approximately 21% to 45% lower.  Alternatively, by


adjusting its earnings for aggressive PoC, software development capitalization costs, and tax benefits, and applying a 11x-15x 
multiple, we could justify approximately 38% to 55% downside risk.

Q4 FY 2013-Q1 FY 2014: Actix and Celcite –
Background


In Q4 FY 2013, Amdocs closed on its acquisition of Actix, a network analytics and optimization platform, and entered into an 
agreement to acquire Celcite, a similar network management service. It closed on the Celcite deal the following quarter. 


Amdocs purchased Actix for $120M and Celcite for $129M. During the subsequent earnings call, management stated that it 
expected Actix and Celcite together “to contribute between 2-3% of full-year revenue outlook in fiscal 2014,” or ~$89M out of an
expected ~$3,546M of FY 2014 sales. Our own research suggests that Celcite alone likely contributed up to $125M on an annual 


basis, and Actix $64M on an annual basis. For reference, Amdocs added $218M of sales in FY 2014 over FY 2013. Our 
estimates suggest that nearly all of Amdocs’ sales growth in FY 2014 came from inorganic sources.


Q4 FY 2013 Earnings Call


Implies $89M Expected Inorganic Sales Contribution


“In the fourth quarter, we concluded -- we closed the acquisition of Actix. And 
today, we have signed an agreement to acquire Celcite Management Solutions 
for $129 million. Combined, we expect Actix and Celcite to contribute 
between 2% to 3% of our full year revenue outlook in fiscal 2014 and 
drive modest earning accretions.”
- Eli Gelman, President and CEO, Amdocs


“For our full fiscal year, we expect total revenue growth to be within the 
range of roughly 4% to 8% on a constant currency basis and reported 
basis. This outlook incorporates the consolidation of Actix and Celcite, which 
in aggregate, we expect to contribute approximately 2 to 3 percentage points 
of the growth outlook.”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


Actix


“Actix, a leader in mobile network analytics and optimization solutions, today 
announced record-breaking revenue levels for its fiscal year ending January 
31, 2012. During the year, Actix revenues grew 29% resulting in total 
revenues of over $52M as the number of active customers surpassed 400.”
- Businesswire (Source)


Assumption: Continued annual sales growth of 15%, starting from 
the date of the press release (~18 months prior to acquisition)


Estimated Annual Sales Contribution to Amdocs: $64M


Celcite


Market research: Celcite potentially did $125M in sales during its first year as a

Q1 FY 2015: Utiba/Mobile Financial Services –
Background


Amdocs first acquired Utiba – a provider of smartphone-based banking and financial services technology – in March 2014 (Q2 
FY 2014). Management would later use this technology as the foundation for its Mobile Financial Services (MFS) segment. 


However, this business was not launched until Q1 FY 2015, when management announced its agreement to provide the 
technology for Telenor, TeliaSonera, and Tele2’s Norwegian mobile payment joint venture. As this segment was built upon 


acquired technology – even now, some sources describe MFS as a separate “‘start-up’ within Amdocs”1 – its estimated 
revenue contribution through FY 2015 should be considered attributable to Utiba and therefore inorganic, albeit delayed with 


respect to the timing of the acquisition itself.


We also note that the delayed timing of the MFS launch with respect to the Utiba acquisition superficially makes MFS appear to 
be much more of an organic development than it really was.


Q2 FY 2014 Earnings Call


“Towards the end of the quarter, we also closed on the strategic acquisition of 
Utiba, a small developer of payment-related technology in the emerging 
markets. Utiba was acquired for $20 million in cash and the revenue 
contribution for the quarter was immaterial.”


- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


“Important to our geographic expansion, we're also focused on bringing 
innovation to the market as another dimension of our long-term growth, both in 
terms of new products and new services. Along these lines, in the first quarter, 
Amdocs [launched] mobile financial services solutions, MFS, a new offering 
resounding from our internal R&D investment and the acquisition of 
Utiba, which we completed in the second quarter of FY14.”
- Tamar Rapaport-Dagim, CFO, Amdocs


Q1 FY 2015 Earnings Call


The Company would likely argue that the MFS revenue stream begun in Q1 FY 2015 was an organic development, despite 
being built upon an acquired business. However, as the business line depended heavily on the acquired technology (note that 


R&D spending remained relatively flat through this period – if there was any increase, it was minimal), and as its launch 
provided a one-time revenue windfall which was not reflective of Amdocs’ underlying run-rate top-line growth, the contribution 


of MFS to Company sales in its first year of operation should be considered inorganic.

Q1 FY 2015: Utiba/Mobile Financial Services –
Revenue Estimate


Shortly before its acquisition by Amdocs in late CY 2013 / early CY 2014, Utiba bought out the 51% stake of Utiba Americas –
the business’ Americas segment – which had previously been controlled by Alternet Systems Inc. (“Alternet” or “ALYI”) 


through a joint venture (“Alternet Transactions Systems, Inc.” or “ATS”). As the majority owner of the JV, Alternet – a public 
company – disclosed the segment’s full results in its financials. We can use the implied EV/Sales multiple on Utiba Americas to 
estimate Utiba’s revenue at the time of the Amdocs acquisition based on the purchase price paid by Amdocs for the company.

Amdocs Purchase Price $20


Revenue Multiple Assumption 5.2x


Annual Revenue Estimate 3.8


Quarterly Revenue Estimate 1.0


All figures in millions of dollars, except multiples


We could also estimate Utiba’s sales contribution by comparing the business to eServGlobal, perhaps the world’s only 
publicly-traded pure-play mobile financial services business. As of January 2018, eServGlobal processed 3.5B transactions per 


year (source). As of 2013, Utiba processed “over 12B transactions per year” on a customer base of over 660M subscribers 
(source). Even leaving room for potential differences in transaction size, etc., we could conservatively estimate that, at the time 


of the Amdocs acquisition, Utiba was ~2x as large as eServGlobal is today.2


We could also analyze Amdocs’ Utiba acquisition against eServGlobal’s historical EV/Sales multiple to estimate Utiba sales.


1. Source. Amended down from an initial aggregate purchase price of $6.5M (source).
2. This method also gives no credit to Utiba for the fact that eServGlobal sales have contracted by more than half since 2013 due to restructuring. Utiba could be even larger than ~2x eServGlobal.

Q1 FY 2015: Utiba/Mobile Financial Services –
When Did The Contribution Begin?


Management claimed that Utiba’s revenue contribution was “immaterial” in Q2 FY 2014, when the business was first acquired. 
However, during its Q4 FY 2015 call – three quarters after it first launched the MFS segment – management confirmed that MFS 
was generating revenue “in the tens of millions of dollars”. We suspect that Utiba contributed some legacy revenue to Amdocs 


prior to the launch of MFS, but that the contribution accelerated with the MFS launch in Q1 2015.


We also find it interesting that, after the Utiba Americas JV sale was announced, Utiba Americas quarterly revenue fell from 
~$0.5M to $100-200K or less until the sale was completed three quarters later, as can be observed in Alternet’s financial 
statements. We wonder if Utiba as a whole experienced a low-revenue “restructuring/integration period” following the 


acquisition only to see revenue recover several quarters later with the launch of MFS.

Q4 FY 2015: Comverse BSS – Background


In Q4 FY 2015, Amdocs acquired the majority of Comverse’s Business Support Systems (BSS) assets for $273M. In response 
to questions regarding BSS’s revenue contribution to Amdocs, management warned that, while the segment had generated 


$251M in revenue through the prior fiscal year, the business was in decline: it was generating revenue “already in the forties” 
on a quarterly basis, and would contribute “in the low tens of millions of dollars.” It also reiterated that it was not purchasing 


the entirety of the segment’s assets, clearly downplaying the extent to which the acquisition would contribute inorganic sales.1


Importantly, Comverse was public at the time of the acquisition and provided detailed information regarding the divested 
segment through the five quarters following the sale (though it changed its name to Xura in September 2015, making it harder 


to track down). Accordingly, management’s claims about the business could be tested independently.

Management was correct that the business was in decline. However, this could have been due to the divestiture itself, as the segment had 
grown by just over 1% through the prior fiscal year. It’s plausible that revenue growth would have stabilized in the year following the 


acquisition. Even then, claiming that the business was generating quarterly revenue “in the forties” was a sizable mischaracterization, even 
when taking only the assets acquired by Amdocs into account.


We also note that, while Amdocs did in fact not acquire the full BSS business, it did acquire most BSS sales. We question why management 
went out of its way to claim that “our starting base is somewhat lower”1 – a clear attempt to downplay BSS’s inorganic sales contribution.

Q4 FY 2015: Comverse BSS – Revenue 
Contribution Estimate


Conservatively, we estimate that sales generated by the acquired BSS assets would not have grown through the segment’s 
first year under Amdocs, taking into consideration the fact that segment sales contracted through the prior year, but also that 


the business likely would have stabilized under Amdocs’ efforts to grow the business.


Had investors instead taken management guidance at face value – that the acquired asses were generating revenues “in the 
forties” at the time of the purchase and were still experiencing material top-line contraction – they would have underestimated 


BSS’s revenue contribution and significantly overestimated Amdocs’ underlying organic sales growth.

We note that, in this case, if management was recognizing revenue normally, and simply understating the extent to which revenue growth 
was inorganic, BSS’s revenue contribution would have implied material organic contraction through the corresponding periods.


It is possible that management was instead not recognizing revenue appropriately, and building a source of inorganic growth which could 
gradually be recognized as seemingly organic revenue through subsequent quarters. This would obviously be a much graver offense.

Q2 FY 2016: cVidya


Amdocs announced its acquisition of fraud management business cVidya in Q1 FY 2016, and completed the acquisition early 
in Q2. Management suggested that the acquisition was “small,” but several sources indicate that it would have contributed 
material revenue to Amdocs. One news article published at the time of the acquisition states that, according to Israel’s IVC 
database, cVidya had annual sales of $65M prior to the sale (source). Our conversations with people in the industry also 


suggest that, at the time of the acquisition, cVidya was one of the top three businesses in its ~$500M industry, each of which 
had 10-15% market share. Subex, another industry leader, did $47M in revenue in 2015 and $44M in revenue in 2016. These 


data points would pin cVidya revenue anywhere between $45M and $75M.


We estimate that cVidya contributed $60M of inorganic sales to Amdocs over the four quarters following the acquisition, or 
$15M per quarter. Meanwhile, management justifiably wrote off the inorganic impact of cVidya in Q1 as immaterial, as it was 
acquired late in the quarter, but the Company also did not discuss the inorganic impact in later quarters during subsequent 


calls, and spoke of all developments in the segment as though they were organic developments.

Q4 FY 2016: Vindicia, Brite:Bill, and Pontis


In Q4 FY 2016, Amdocs acquired Vindicia, Brite:Bill, and Pontis, all providers of subscription management and billing software 
services. Each was purchased for $85-90M, for a total acquisition price of $260M. Management claimed that it projected the 
acquisitions to contribute 1.5-2% of revenue growth through FY 2017, or about $64M. However, independent sources reveal 


that Vindicia alone earned “over $90M in annual revenue” as of July 2016 (source). Other sources indicate that Brite:Bill 
generated €11.8M in revenue in 2015, or just under $13M in 2015 US dollars, and was growing rapidly at the time (source). Less 
data is available on Pontis, but even conservative estimates of Vindicia’s and Brite:Bill’s FY 2017 revenue contribution would 


together exceed management’s inorganic revenue contribution guidance. 


To estimate Pontis’ sales, we note that, while previous acquisition cVidya had 50% more employees (200 vs. 300), Pontis had raised $70M in VC funding vs. 
$30M for cVidya (source and source). We also note that, assuming revenue per customer of $225K, a 200-person headcount would imply revenue of $45M, 
close to the midpoint of our Vindicia and Brite:Bill estimates and within the ballpark of our cVidya estimate. This would also imply a sales multiple of 1.9x 


on a purchase price of $85M, near the midpoint of the revenue multiples of Amdocs’ other acquisitions. We therefore estimate Pontis’ annual sales at $45M.

Q4 FY 2017: Kenzan Media


In Q4 FY 2017, Amdocs acquired Kenzan Media. Kenzan was a relatively small acquisition for Amdocs: management did not 
discuss it during the subsequent earnings call, and it did not disclose the price of the acquisition in the press release. 
However, as Amdocs’ year-end cash flow statement shows $18M of spending on acquisitions in Q4, it appears that the 


Company paid $18M for Kenzan. Little information is available about the business, but, as the cost of the acquisition was only 
just under the cost of Utiba, a best-guess estimate would put Kenzan’s sales contribution at close to Utiba’s contribution, 


previously estimated at $9M annually.

Q2 FY 2018: Vubiquity, UXP, and projekt202


Management announced the acquisition of Vubiquity for $224M and of projekt202 for $54M in Q1 FY 2018, and the acquisition 
of UXP Systems for $80M in Q2. Both closed mid-way through Q2. Management again downplayed the contribution of UXP to 
sales, claiming that it was a “small company” and “less material.” However, according to Canadian Business, UXP generated 
revenue of C$10-20M in 2015 (source), and other sources suggested that company revenue grew at a CAGR of 240% over the 
prior five years (source). Similarly, CFO Dagim said that projekt202’s revenue contribution was immaterial, and the acquisition 
was not even mentioned by CEO Gelman on the earnings call. However, sources indicate that the business did over $30M in 


revenue in 2016 and was growing rapidly (source).


Management was more explicit when discussing Vubiquity, stating that it expected the business to contribute $100M in 
annualized revenue. However, several independent sources suggest that Vubiquity generated over $250M in annual revenue in 


2013, including a press release by the company itself (source, source).


Is Amdocs minimizing the immediate revenue contribution of acquired businesses only to realize greater acquisition-driven revenue later in 
an attempt to make the resulting sales growth appear organic?


Q1 FY 2018 Earnings Call: Vubiquity


“Based in Los Angeles, Vubiliquity is a provider of premium content services and technology solutions, 
which upon closing, we expect will contribute annualized revenue of approximately $100 million for 
Amdocs.”

Q2 FY 2018 Earnings Call: UXP Systems


“And in terms of the numbers, [UXP is] less material. So, that's why we didn't refer to it. It's 
relatively a small company at this stage, but we believe that together with the breadth of the customers' 
opportunity that we have that we acquired through Vubiquity now, the opportunity is significant moving 
forward to create those synergies. But it will take some time naturally. Those kinds of opportunities 
usually have sales cycles, so therefore, not necessarily will make an impact this fiscal year.”

Q1 FY 2018 Earnings Call: projekt202


“During Q1, to support our digital strategy, we acquired projekt202, a leader in experience-driven software 
design and development, based in the U.S., that helps large-scale organizations like Southwest Airlines 
and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services to navigate complex digital transformations. projekt202 was 
acquired for $54 million in cash, and the revenue contribution for the quarter was immaterial.”

Q2 FY 2018: Vubiquity, UXP, and projekt202


As with the BSS deal, if Amdocs is in fact recognizing revenue appropriately in this case, and simply understating the extent to
which growth is inorganic, this would imply material organic contraction through the quarters following these three deals.


Rather, management may not be recognizing acquisition-related revenue in a timely manner, but instead recognizing it 
gradually over time as a source of apparent organic growth. Again, this would be a much more significant offense.
