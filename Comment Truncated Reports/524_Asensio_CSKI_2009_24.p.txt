“Chinese Accounting Tricks” Detailed on NY
Times Website.


Posted on August 26, 2009 by Asensio.com


An article appeared on the New York Times website on August 17th


describing “Chinese accounting tricks.” The author of the article,


Mark Dixon, is founder of a London-based mergers and acquisitions


advisory, The 1 Advisers Limited, and has more than 20 years


experience in M&A, including with Chinese companies. In the


article Mr. Dixon chronicles a specific case where he was as an


advisor on the sale of a Chinese company. Drawing on this and


other experiences, he found that managers of Chinese companies


skewed revenue, expenses and earnings figures so much that the


managers themselves were not sure of what their firm’s “true


profit” actually was.


Dixon states, “The gymnastics they do with revenues and costs are


so impressive that the Beijing Olympics should have added an event


especially for accountants.” Dixon goes on to state, “Someone who


behaves like a traditional, polite accountant will never find out the


truth,” and “Every stone I turned over seemed to reveal not a single


spider but countless additional stones, each of which needed to be


investigated.”

Reports previously issued by asensio.com on China Sky One


Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) have raised questions about the


quality of CSKI’s reported financial results, especially in terms of


inventory, gross margins and average sales prices, a potential


undisclosed related party, relationships with suppliers, and major


discrepancies between financial statements filed with the Chinese


government and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. To
