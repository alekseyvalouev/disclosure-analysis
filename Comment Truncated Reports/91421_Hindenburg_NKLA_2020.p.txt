Today, we reveal why we believe Nikola is an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies over the course of its Founder and Executive Chairman
Trevor Milton’s career.
We have gathered extensive evidence—including recorded phone calls, text messages, private emails and behind-the-scenes photographs
—detailing dozens of false statements by Nikola Founder Trevor Milton. We have never seen this level of deception at a public company,
especially of this size.
Trevor has managed to parlay these false statements made over the course of a decade into a ~$20 billion public company. He has inked
partnerships with some of the top auto companies in the world, all desperate to catch up to Tesla and to harness the EV wave.
We examine how Nikola got its early start and show how Trevor misled partners into signing agreements by falsely claiming to have
extensive proprietary technology.
We reveal how, in the face of growing skepticism over the functionality of its truck, Nikola staged a video called “Nikola One in Motion”
which showed the semi-truck cruising on a road at a high rate of speed. Our investigation of the site and text messages from a former
employee reveal that the video was an elaborate ruse—Nikola had the truck towed to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and
simply �lmed it rolling down the hill.
In October 2019, Nikola announced it would revolutionize the battery industry. This was to be done through a pending acquisition, but the
deal fell through when Nikola realized (a) the technology was vaporware and (b) the President of the battery company had been indicted
months earlier over allegations that he conned NASA by using his expense account to procure numerous prostitutes.
Nikola has never walked back claims relating to its battery technology. Instead, Trevor continued to publicly hype the technology even after
becoming aware of the above issues. The revolutionary battery technology never existed – now, Nikola plans to use GM’s battery
technology instead.
A spokesman for Volvo spin-o� Powercell AB, a hydrogen fuel cell technology company that formerly partnered with Nikola, called Nikola’s
battery and hydrogen fuel cell claims “hot air”.
In addition to now using GM’s battery technology, Nikola seeks to use the automaker’s production and fuel cell capabilities. Nikola seems to
be bringing nothing to the partnership but concept designs, their brand name and up to $700 million they will be paying GM for costs
related to production.
Inexpensive hydrogen is fundamental to the success of Nikola’s business model. Trevor has claimed in a presentation to hundreds of
people and in multiple interviews to have succeeded at cutting the cost of hydrogen by ~81% compared to peers and to already be
producing hydrogen. Nikola has not produced hydrogen at this price or at any price as he later admitted when pressed by media.
Trevor has appointed his brother, Travis, as “Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure” to oversee this critical part of the business.
Travis’s prior experience looks to have largely consisted of pouring concrete driveways and doing subcontractor work on home renovations
in Hawaii.
Claims of owning energy producing assets is not new for Nikola. Trevor claimed that Nikola’s headquarters has 3.5 megawatts of solar
panels on its roof producing energy. Aerial photos of the roof and later media reports show that the supposed panels don’t exist.
At one point Nikola claimed to own its own natural gas wells. There is no evidence in company �lings to support this. The claims were
eventually quietly removed from Nikola’s website.
Trevor claims Nikola designs all key components in house, but they appear to simply be buying or licensing them from third-parties. One
example: we found that Nikola actually buys inverters from a company called Cascadia. In a video showing o� its “in-house” inverters,
Nikola concealed the Cascadia label with a piece of masking tape.
In a July 2020 podcast, Trevor said of Nikola’s “Tre” truck: “We have �ve of them coming o� the assembly line right now in Ulm Germany.” A
spokesperson for Bosch, the manufacturing partner building the trucks, con�rmed this month that they haven’t made any trucks yet.
The company’s Nikola One “reveal” was a total farce. We corroborate Bloomberg’s earlier work debunking Trevor’s claims regarding its semi-
truck that “this thing fully functions and works…this is a real truck” and provide new evidence.
We present behind-the-scenes photos showing that Nikola had an electricity cable snaked up from underneath the stage into the truck in
order to falsely claim the Nikola One’s electrical systems fully functioned.


Nikola: How to Parlay An Ocean of Lies Into a Partnership With the
Largest Auto OEM in America


Published on September 10, 2020
We learned through emails and interviews with former partners that Trevor had an artist stencil “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric”
on the side of the Nikola One despite it having no hydrogen capabilities whatsoever; it was built with natural gas components.
We also present evidence that subsequent “reveals” were �ctitious. In 2019, Nikola revealed a “next generation” version of its o�-road
vehicle. We learned that it was scrapped within weeks of the unveiling due to manufacturing challenges. The redesign work was then quietly
outsourced.
Nikola’s much-touted multi-billion dollar order book is �lled with �u�. U.S. Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations,
representing ~$3.5 billion in orders. U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on hand last quarter.
Nikola’s key partners and backers have been cashing out aggressively. Worthington, Bosch and ValueAct have all sold shares. Worthington
sold $237 million shares over a 2-day span in July and another $250 million in August. We think they know exactly what type of company
Nikola is, and we expect that as Nikola’s GM “partnership” boosts the stock price, key holders will continue to exit.
We think Trevor Milton, through dozens of outright lies, was able to form partnerships with some of the largest legacy auto companies in
the world in their desperation to catch up to Tesla’s EV leadership status.
Trevor has ensured he is not going down with the ship.  He cashed out $70 million around the IPO and amended his share lock-up from 1-
year to 180 days. If he is �red, his equity awards immediately vest and he is entitled to collect $20 million over two years. Milton has laid the
groundwork to extract hundreds of millions from Nikola years before ever delivering on his promises.
Every now and then a story comes around that exposes how little the “experts” really know. Theranos inked partnerships with Walgreens,
Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and sta�ed its board with luminaries. We think Nikola’s partners did not do their homework.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of Nikola Corp. This report represents our opinion, and we encourage


every reader to do their own due diligence. Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.


Background: A Relentless Tesla Rally Pressured General Motors
and Other Legacy Automakers to Catch Up


The underlying narrative for the electric vehicle market in 2020 has undoubtedly been Tesla’s relentless rally, which recently culminated in the


company being valued with a market cap of over $400 billion at its peak—more than time-tested names like GM, Ford, Daimler and Fiat –


combined.


Unlike Nikola, Tesla develops extensive proprietary technology, which cuts many traditional automakers and suppliers out of its picture. The


astronomical rise in Tesla’s valuation has pressured other auto companies, like General Motors, to unlock similar value from the ongoing EV


wave. In August 2020, analysts from Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley pressed General Motors (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/18/wall-street-


pushes-for-gm-to-spin-o�-its-electric-vehicle-


business.html#:~:text=The%20spin%2Do�%20company%20could,the%20company%20unlocking%20shareholder%20value.) to spin o� its


electric vehicle business, stating that such a move dedicated to EV could be worth “up to $100 billion”.


“Nothing is o� the table,” GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time, appeasing analysts and winning a price target boost from Morgan Stanley shortly


thereafter.


Background: GM Temporarily Staves O� Pressure From Analysts
And Stakeholders By Entering Into A Strategic Partnership with
Nikola


On the morning of September 8, 2020, Nikola announced (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920102820/tm2030359d1_8k.htm) a strategic manufacturing partnership with General Motors,


sending shares of both companies sharply higher.


For many, the deal was viewed as long-awaited validation for Nikola, which to date has mainly presented little but prototypes, renderings and a


heap of promises. After all, General Motors is one of the largest, multinational auto manufacturers on the planet and has been in business for


over 100 years. It has reach into every major auto market, including the U.S., Europe and China.


Economically, GM gets $2 billion in stock (an 11% stake (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920102820/tm2030359d1_8k.htm)) in Nikola for non-cash contributions


(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nikola-and-general-motors-form-strategic-partnership-nikola-badger-to-be-engineered-and-


manufactured-by-general-motors-301125324.html) such as engineering and validating a truck for Nikola, $700 million in expense


reimbursements, supply contracts and 80% of the EV credits (https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-09-08/gm-nikola-pickup), along with

a host of ‘outs’. GM can begin selling shares (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920102820/tm2030359d1_8k.htm) before a single truck rolls o� the line. Essentially, it’s a free call


option in a “sexy” EV story for General Motors.


But why sign with Nikola at all? GM’s CEO was asked on the day of the announcement what technology GM would get out of the deal. She


couldn’t name a single thing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v5L6Z202rI&feature=youtu.be&t=270).


The real “value” for GM seems to be branding. We believe the legacy automaker simply seeks to latch General Motors’ storied name onto Nikola’s


charismatic Founder and Executive Chairman, Trevor Milton. Trevor is perceived by many as a forward-thinking, fresh, visionary entrepreneur


capable of rivaling Elon Musk’s allure.


But in GM’s attempt to keep up with Elon Musk, who did they just get into bed with?


Introduction: Who is Trevor Milton?


“I never deceived anyone!”—Nikola Executive Chairman Trevor Milton (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-


exaggerated-the-capability-of-his-debut-truck)


What is the di�erence between a visionary selling a daring view of the future and a con artist?


Tech founders are often accused of being overly rosy with their projections. Supporters credit such founders as having bold, forward-thinking


plans while detractors accuse them of knowingly selling unrealistic promises.


While such debates among optimists and pessimists are common, most everyone can agree that there is a di�erence between being overly


optimistic about the future and outright lying.


Credibility is important for any management team, but this is especially true of a company like Nikola that has virtually no revenue and no


shippable product. Given Nikola’s market cap as of this writing, the company is a ~$20 billion promise of what it can achieve in the future.


And Trevor Milton is as “key man” as it gets. Per Nikola’s �lings:


“Mr. Milton is the source of many, if not most, of the ideas and execution driving Nikola” [Pg. 45 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128920000012/nkla-20200630.htm)].


In Trevor’s post-Q2 CNBC interview, he said he let Nikola’s CEO and CFO handle the earnings call because he “wanted them to feel like they have a


voice in the company”. (Aug 5  CNBC, 3:34 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPhN8saJkAI))


What follows is a deep dive on the origins of Nikola Corp. and its founder Trevor Milton.  


What we found is that, for over a decade, instead of developing his own capabilities, Trevor has established an undeniable track record of taking


from others and claiming technology as his own. He has quietly used o�-the-shelf products from third-parties while loudly claiming to have vast


proprietary technology.


Trevor would then leverage what he had and repeatedly mislead customers, partners, and investors in order to build his credibility and take his


concept to the next level.


This pattern of behavior continues to this day, now with billions of dollars on the line and with Nikola tied to some of the largest auto companies


in the world.


Our work for this report involved speaking with multiple whistleblowers, business partners, and former employees as well as reviewing extensive


internal documentation from Trevor’s ventures leading up to Nikola, including emails, text messages, recorded conversations and behind-the-


scenes photographs.


Based on our �ndings, we believe Nikola is an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies over the course of its founder Trevor Milton’s career, which


he has parlayed into a $20 billion cloud of smoke and partnerships with some of the top auto companies in the world.

Part I: Trevor Milton’s Career Path Leading Up to Nikola


November 2009: Trevor Milton Launches dHybrid, Inc. with a
Partner, Kicking o� his EV Trucking Journey. It Ended in Litigation
With Allegations of Misappropriation and False Promises


After dropping out of college (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1284189340516540416?s=20), Trevor Milton started an alarm sales


company in Utah called St. George Security and Alarm. He eventually exited the business for $300,000. Our interview with its buyer indicated that


Trevor overpromised, resulting in a total loss for the initial acquirer. We also interviewed Trevor’s “50/50” business partner who indicated he was


led to believe the exit was much smaller, saying he ultimately received only $100,000 for his “50%”.


Following the alarm business exit, Trevor launched an online classi�ed ads website that sold used cars, called uPillar.com, which eventually


failed. (For more on both of these early businesses, see the Appendix at the end of this report.)


Following those two early pursuits, Trevor’s initial foray into alternative energy vehicles was a company called dHybrid, Inc. Trevor joined forces


with an engineer named Mike Shrout who had developed compressed natural gas (CNG) conversion technology for diesel engines. Shrout was to


bring the technical expertise to the venture while Trevor would bring his business experience.


It Got O� to a Good Start: dHybrid Entered into Agreement with
Major Trucking Company Swi� to Convert Up to 800 Trucks, a
Contract Valued at �16 Million


Shortly after launching dHybrid, Trevor contacted Jerry Moyes, CEO of Swift Transportation to market dHybrid’s conversion technology, according


to a source familiar with the company. The team demonstrated the technology on a converted pickup truck to Moyes at Swift’s Phoenix facility.


Moyes was apparently impressed with the demo and Swift eventually signed a development agreement, paying $2 million for a 9% stake


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492691/000119312513198936/d510428dex101.htm) in dHybrid, as well as extending a $322,000 loan


to the company. The agreement (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6sXvdQd2NJILrW), which we located through litigation records, called for the


conversion of an initial 10 trucks for testing with a commitment to convert 800 trucks thereafter.


Swi� Later Sued, Alleging the Company Delivered Only 5 Trucks
That Didn’t Work and That dHybrid’s O�cers Misappropriated
Capital for Personal Use


The deal immediately hit roadblocks, as dHybrid failed to deliver on its agreement. Swift �led a lawsuit


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3J5amtkGnucK6c) in mid-2012. A subsequent amended complaint


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Cc7IcgRnYd54pg) alleged that only 5 trucks had been delivered instead of the promised 10, that the


performance of the trucks didn’t to live up to the initial promises, and that capital had been misappropriated by dHybrid’s o�cers.

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3J5amtkGnucK6c

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Cc7IcgRnYd54pg
In the Lead-Up to the Lawsuit, Trevor Reached out to New Investors
Claiming the Swi� Contract Was Worth �250-�300 Million


Reality: We Have the Contract. It Was Only �16 Million


As dHybrid’s $2 million in startup capital was running out, Trevor reached out to new investors, making bold claims about the size of the Swift


contract and how well the technology was performing.


This includes an email to Anthony Burns, the former CEO of Ryder Systems, shown below. In the email, Trevor makes several claims that appear


to be outright fabrications, based on litigation records and conversations with a former business partner:


1. “So far we are saving Swift 38% on their fuel bill.” At the time, the Swift data showed savings of no higher than 24%.
2. “We have logged over half a million miles of data pulling 80,000 pound loads.” These numbers were apparently similarly in�ated.
3. “We have signed a $250 million dollar plus contract with Swift”. The contract was only for $16 million, as per Swift’s lawsuit, and as


corroborated by our source familiar with the agreement.
In another dHybrid investor presentation we reviewed, one slide cites the Swift contract as being $300 million, triggered when EPA certi�cation is


achieved:


But once again, per the Swift lawsuit, we see clearly that the contract value was only $16 million. [Pg. 10


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6sXvdQd2NJILrW)]


Following the Swi� Litigation, dHybrid Sought a Buyout But the
Deal Ended in More Litigation, With the Buyer Alleging dHybrid
Made Numerous Misrepresentations About its Capabilities



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6sXvdQd2NJILrW
In dire �nancial straits, Trevor sought to negotiate a buyout with a company called Sustainable Power Group LLC (“sPower”) based in Salt Lake


City, Utah.


The parties entered into negotiations and signed a term sheet in May 2012 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rcKmJJOgNPQsyM), but only one


month later in June, sPower exercised the termination clause and backed out of the agreement citing signi�cant misrepresentations during


their due diligence process.


Shortly after, when dHybrid disputed sPower’s �ndings, sPower �led a lawsuit (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rcKmJJOgNPQsyM) alleging:


1. dHybrid had not, as represented, completed development of the dHybrid System.


dHybrid had not begun the EPA certi�cation process as dHybrid had claimed.


dHybrid had been mispresenting results obtained from the �ve Swift diesel semi-trucks that were using the dHybrid System. 
Speci�cally, sPower discovered that dHybrid materially misrepresented the fuel-blend ratios achieved by these diesel trucks.


dHybrid had falsely represented the fuel-cost savings achieved by Swift as a result of using the dHybrid System. 


dHybrid was often having trouble interpreting data it received from Swift’s drivers. Rather than seek clari�cation or perform more detailed
test runs with the dHybrid Systems, dHybrid elected to �ll in the gaps in the data with assumptions it created. 


2012: Trevor Pitched Investors on His Team, Including an
Experienced CTO—But the Named Individual Was Never dHybrid’s
CTO


In the Spring of 2012, with dHybrid under pressure to raise additional capital, Trevor prepared a presentation


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/MNbanZ76KASvEj) for the Park City Angels (https://www.parkcityangels.com/), a venture capital group in Salt


Lake City. In that presentation, Trevor falsely claimed that the company had an experienced Chief Technology O�cer.


The presentation, which we reviewed, contains a slide listing dHybrid’s management team. The CTO is the only individual in the group identi�ed


by his initials: “S.S.” rather than his full name.


The CTO’s employment and educational background, however, including a MS degree from the University of Michigan and work experience at


General Motors and Parker Hanni�n, matched that of dHybrid contractor Steve Scott (https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-scott-60555a7/).



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rcKmJJOgNPQsyM

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/MNbanZ76KASvEj

https://www.parkcityangels.com/

https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-scott-60555a7/
An individual familiar with dHybrid’s operations said that Scott never held the position of CTO. He had only worked on various proof-of-concept


projects for dHybrid as an outside consultant.


2012: With dHybrid Mired in Litigation, Trevor Started a New
Company With his Dad, Choosing a Very Similar Name, dHybrid
Systems


Trevor Then Falsely Claimed to Prospective Partners That
‘dHybrid’ Had Been in Operation for Years


With dHybrid mired in litigation and a suspended state of existence, Trevor and his father Bill Milton launched dHybrid Systems, LLC in October


2012 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/H7Z0Nd1jDhMt5Z). The new company quickly resumed its focus on CNG fueling systems except Trevor


and his father now owned the entity, leaving Trevor’s former partners with nothing.


With the similar name of dHybrid Systems, Trevor was able to suggest to prospective clients, partners and investors that the new company was a


continuation of dHybrid and its years of experience and achievements.


We reviewed an example of such marketing materials (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Nkh0aHAglceHbc) that falsely suggested dHybrid


Systems began in 2011, when in fact the entity had been formed in October 2012.



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/H7Z0Nd1jDhMt5Z

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Nkh0aHAglceHbc
Here are the incorporation records (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Nkh0aHAglceHbc) for comparison:


2014: dHybrid Systems Was Then Acquired by Worthington—A
Successful Exit…For Trevor



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Nkh0aHAglceHbc
We Learned from a Former Employee (In a Recorded Call) That
dHybrid Concealed Potentially Fatal Product Issues from
Worthington In Order to Get the Deal Done


By 2014, Trevor had found a buyer for his new company, industrial manufacturing heavyweight Worthington Industries (NYSE:WOR). Worthington


paid $15.9 million for a 79.59% stake in the entity, valuing the entire company at $19.9 million. [Pg. 15


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/108516/000119312515006521/d833854d10q.htm)]


In recent interviews, Trevor has overstated the exit value. In a 2019 interview with Trucks.com (https://www.trucks.com/2019/02/18/qa-nikola-


founder-trevor-milton/), for example, he claimed that his $15.9 million exit was for “much more than $20 million”.


Getting back to the deal at the time, it appears Trevor overpromised on the capabilities of the technology and its e�ectiveness in the �eld.


In recorded conversations, former employees of dHybrid Systems admitted to traversing the country in a mad dash to patch up dHybrid’s broken


systems as best possible, concealing the issues from Worthington so that the deal could close. Per the conversation [click for audio


(https://youtu.be/3HiUI6cyUSw)]:


“I helped design and develop and �x all these repairs that Worthington didn’t know about. But I was in the �eld making repairs so
that they wouldn’t �nd out about it.”


“These back-of-cab units were actually falling o� of the trash trucks, like, breaking o�. They were shearing the damn frickin’ frames and then
coming o�, like nearly friggin’ causing deaths.”
“I was the guy in the �eld making sure (Worthington) didn’t �nd out. If they had found out that would have ruined the deal.”


The company in question was Waste Pro (https://www.wasteprousa.com/). Here is a picture of one of its trucks converted for CNG from dHybrid.

https://youtu.be/3HiUI6cyUSw

https://www.wasteprousa.com/
Using Worthington’s Credibility, Trevor Then Apparently Made
False Claims About Nikola’s “Proprietary” Technology in Order to
Induce Partners to Work with Him


According to former employees of EVDrive, they signed with Trevor based not only on his supposed leadership role at Worthington but also on a


belief that Nikola (named Bluegentech at the time) had advanced proprietary turbine technology that would make for a good �t with their own


technology.


Trevor represented that he had proprietary turbine technology in a contract signed (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CPnFrrz696Ia4W) with


EVDrive in May 2015, which we’ve procured a copy of:


The agreement (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CPnFrrz696Ia4W) reiterated that the turbine was “Bluegentech’s proprietary turbine system”.


But that appears to have been false as well. Two months after Bluegentech represented to EVDrive that it owned proprietary turbine


technology, Trevor’s entity was in negotiations with another company called Brayton Energy (https://www.braytonenergy.net/) to purchase their


turbines. Once again, we have the email record to prove this.


The turbine purchases were stated to be on behalf of Worthington, which Trevor was working with at the time:



https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CPnFrrz696Ia4W

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CPnFrrz696Ia4W

https://www.braytonenergy.net/
Trevor leveraged his Worthington role, in addition to claims of having proprietary technology to draw in partners that could collectively help


piece together parts needed for Nikola’s �rst EV truck.


As we will show later, the claims of having “proprietary” technology that is actually someone else’s product appear to be an ongoing


phenomenon with Trevor to this very day.


December 2015: Worthington Promptly Wrote Down the Value of
dHybrid Assets


About a year after the deal, Worthington identi�ed problems with the dHybrid Systems acquisition and recorded a $2.3 million impairment


related to the acquisition in Q4 2015. [Pg. 53 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/108516/000119312515271107/d943911d10k.htm)] The


company further recorded a $1.5 million warranty-related expense relating to dHybrid in 2016. [Pg. 3


(https://s24.q4cdn.com/947644764/�les/transcript/2016-Q3-WOR-Transcript.pdf)]


As we detail in the Appendix to this report, Worthington had a deep relationship with Nikola, which it now appears to be attempting to downplay


and distance itself from. At one point, Nikola was a subsidiary


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/108516/000119312516666636/d174336dex21.htm) of Worthington and the close relationship gave


Trevor enough credibility to cobble together several early partnerships.


Part II: Nikola


2016: A�er Cobbling Together Truck Parts with Deceptively
Constructed Partnership Agreements, Nikola Announced it Would
Revolutionize Transportation


Bluegentech then became Nikola, and Trevor continued to line up supplier deals in an attempt to get the pieces together to assemble the


company’s �rst truck with third-party parts.


According to former employees and partners working on the Nikola One, the company’s �rst proposed semi-truck, progress was slow.


Nevertheless on May 9  2016 (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-formed-to-transform-u-s-transportation-industry-


25), Nikola came out of ‘stealth mode’, announcing that it had developed a product that would revolutionize the �eld of transportation.

The press release vowed to unveil the Nikola One in December, committing the company to an aggressive deadline.


December 2016: The Big Nikola One Reveal —“This Truck is By Far
the Most State of The Art Truck Ever Built in History…This Thing
Fully Functions and Works…This is a Real Truck—This is Not a
Pusher”


Reality: It Was Not A Real Truck And Was, In Fact, A Pusher


By the end of the year, Nikola was poised to reveal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLidTCqAAtY) its revolutionary new truck, the Nikola


One. In the months leading up to the presentation, a user asked Nikola whether the truck would be a “design unveiling or a functional


prototype”. Nikola con�rmed (https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/787831262727680000?s=20) that it would be a “functioning” and “fully built


truck at event”.


At multiple points during a video recording of Trevor’s presentation at the launch event on December 1, 2016, Trevor can be heard making it


crystal clear that the Nikola One was a fully functioning truck:


At the 17:30 (https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?t=1050) mark:



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLidTCqAAtY

https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/787831262727680000?s=20

https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?t=1050
“You’ll see it up on the screens–they’re fully functioning screens. Really incredible. We will have a chain on the seats to prevent people


from coming in just for the safety. I don’t want someone to end up doing something and driving this truck o� the stage…so we’re


going to try to keep people from driving o�. But this thing fully functions and works, which is really incredible.”


Trevor then closed the presentation by insisting 3 times that the truck was real, at the 39:00 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=wLidTCqAAtY&feature=youtu.be&t=2343) mark:


“For every doubter out there that said there’s no way this is true. How can that be possible? We’ve done it. It’s my pleasure to


actually let you guys enjoy the night, see the truck, know it’s real, touch it, feel how sturdy it is. You’re going to see that this is a


real truck. This is not a pusher. Thank you so much everyone!”


For anyone unsure what a “pusher” is, Trevor actually clari�ed in another video (https://youtu.be/4-J7H_XmmWg?t=32) at the event and again


reiterated that the truck was fully functioning and complete in response to an interviewer’s question:


Q: “So how long have you been working on this because this is a fully functioning truck right?


Trevor: “Yeah”


Q: “So how long have you guys been working on this?


Trevor: “Years in secrecy. It’s been very hard. Some of the people found out about us over the last 4 or 5 months as we announced in


the lead-up to this big event, but it took years and years to get here. This isn’t just a pusher like a lot of vehicles that they unveil


[that] are just vehicles that don’t actually function. This is a fully functional vehicle which is really incredible. You can go


through. We can change out whatever they want, all the temperatures. I mean this is a fully functioning vehicle; it’s not just


a pusher. That’s what they call [it] in the automotive world; they just push and it doesn’t move.”


It turns out it was a pusher.


Bloomberg Later Identi�ed That the Truck Was NOT Completed.


Trevor Responded by Admitting This, Then Claimed He NEVER Said
it Was Completed (Despite Video Clearly Contradicting Him).


He Then Threatened to Sue Bloomberg


In June of this year, Bloomberg published a piece (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-


capability-of-his-debut-truck) highlighting that, contrary to Trevor’s claims, the truck was not complete and was missing components.



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLidTCqAAtY&feature=youtu.be&t=2343

https://youtu.be/4-J7H_XmmWg?t=32

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-capability-of-his-debut-truck
In response, Trevor blasted the reporter on Twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273350775998017536?s=20) and immediately


vowed to sue (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273428216259072000?s=20), claiming that everyone knew the truck wasn’t operable and


that the parts were sitting right on the table in front of the audience the whole time:


It was a bold retort. But it was completely invalidated by Trevor’s own words – multiple times – including on video at the event and in Tweets


leading up to it.


In the video of the event (https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?t=195), we saw no such table with truck gears and components clearly visible to all.


Instead, the seating went right up to the stage except for a small table with a computer monitor up front:

https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?t=195

https://youtu.be/DbXqiSYDhrA
(https://youtu.be/DbXqiSYDhrA)In either case—if there was a table with gears (somewhere), we fail to see how that in any way corrects Trevor’s


repeated false claims during the presentation that the truck was fully functional.


Bloomberg Was Right. The Reveal Was a Farce. More Evidence
Corroborates the Bloomberg Piece and Furthers Their Allegations


We have behind-the-scenes photos and other evidence showing just how incomplete the Nikola One was at the time of the 2016 reveal.


In late August, just 3 months before the show, Nikola’s “truck” consisted largely of frame rails with wheels mounted to its Meritor


(https://www.meritor.com/) suspension.



https://youtu.be/DbXqiSYDhrA

https://www.meritor.com/
(Source: Individual who worked on the Nikola
One “Truck” in Late August 2016)


Other components had not yet arrived, including the e-axles, the turbine, the natural gas fueling system, and the body — according to a source


who worked on the job. The factory was not even set up for production. Workers were running to the hardware store to pick up basic parts,


according to the source.


August 2016 (4 Months Before the Show): Nikola Claimed to Have
Engineered “The Holy Grail” Of Hydrogen Technology For
Trucking, Despite No Apparent Evidence it Had Even Begun
Development


Amidst all this, the company abandoned its supposedly revolutionary compressed natural gas (CNG) technology with no explanation. At the


beginning of August, Nikola abruptly announced (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-29) that it


had pivoted from a (CNG) turbine range extender to a hydrogen fuel cell range extender.


The press release claimed that the technology had already been engineered successfully.


The press release (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-29) boasted that this achievement was the


holy grail of trucking:



https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-29

https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-29
“Nikola has engineered the holy grail of the trucking industry. We are not aware of any zero emission truck in the world that can


haul 80,000 pounds more than 1,000 miles and do it without stopping. The Nikola One requires only 15 minutes of downtime before


heading out for the next 1,000 miles.”


Despite these claims, there was no in-house hydrogen capabilities and no hydrogen partners were brought on board, according to


former partners working in the lead-up to the show. The announcement was a shock to even those involved with the company, according to


our sources.


In May 2016, 3 months prior to the hydrogen “pivot”, the company announced (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-


begins-taking-reservations-for-revolutionary-electric-semi-truck-


24#:~:text=Nikola%20Motor%20Company%20Begins%20Taking%20Reservations%20for%20Revolutionary%20Electric%20Semi%2DTruck,-


First%205%2C000%20orders&text=The%20�rst%205%2C000%20trucks%20reserved,giving%20owners%20an%20immediate%20ROI.) it had


begun taking reservations for the natural-gas-powered Nikola One, which it claimed to have already “engineered, developed, and is �nalizing


assembly.” It even promised purchasers free compressed natural gas fuel.


Less than two weeks prior to the announcement that Nikola had engineered a revolutionary hydrogen solution, the Nikola Twitter


(https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/756692103632031744?s=20) account reinforced that its focus was still on CNG (compressed natural gas),


not hydrogen. “CNG is the way to go” it said:


Months earlier Trevor had boasted in public interviews of its natural gas capabilities, stating (https://www.ccjdigital.com/electric-truck-company-


says-more-than-7000-have-been-pre-ordered/):



https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-begins-taking-reservations-for-revolutionary-electric-semi-truck-24#:~:text=Nikola%20Motor%20Company%20Begins%20Taking%20Reservations%20for%20Revolutionary%20Electric%20Semi%2DTruck,-First%205%2C000%20orders&text=The%20first%205%2C000%20trucks%20reserved,giving%20owners%20an%20immediate%20ROI.

https://www.ccjdigital.com/electric-truck-company-says-more-than-7000-have-been-pre-ordered/
“Our technology is 10-15 years ahead of any other OEM in fuel e�ciencies, MPG and emissions”


It is unclear why Nikola decided to suddenly abandon its supposed 10-15 year advantage in natural gas.


Yet despite the “pivot” to hydrogen, the prototype being built continued to be focused on natural gas, according to those involved. The truck


presented at the show had natural gas turbines installed, according to our sources.


Trevor Had “H2” Stenciled on the Truck Despite the Truck
Apparently Having Zero Hydrogen Capabilities


As it turns out, building a zero-emission hydrogen truck is rather di�cult. However, merely stenciling “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric”


on the side of a non-functioning truck is much easier.


Trevor had H2 stenciled on the side of the Nikola One despite the reality that the Nikola One contained a turbine designed for natural


gas and absolutely zero hydrogen technology whatsoever, according to our sources.


A video of the event showing the stencil-work can be seen here (https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?t=1987):



https://youtu.be/wLidTCqAAtY?t=1987
By November, one month before the show, a team from Brayton (https://www.braytonenergy.net/) arrived with natural gas turbines, according


to sources involved in the preparation. Since the turbines would be deep in the truck tucked against the battery, no one would be able to be see


that there was no generator plugged into it and that it didn’t, in fact, run on hydrogen. The fueling system was natural gas only.


“Get Exposed Wiring Looking as Nice as It Can”: Emails Make
Apparent the Last-Minute �ush to Make the Nikola One Look as
Good as Possible in the Weeks Leading Up to the Show


As the show got closer, ambitions were reduced, and it was clear that everyone wanted to just make things look as good as possible for the


presentation. We have reviewed emails that corroborate this, instructing workers to “get exposed wiring looking as nice as it can” and other last-


minute touch-ups:



https://www.braytonenergy.net/
Most everything needed to be installed before the body arrived, so things were put in and buttoned up as well as they could be. The e-axles were


installed without motor cores or gears and were installed empty on the “truck” by mid-November.


The body arrived in late November, and the team from N2A Motors (http://n2amotors.com/), which makes custom car bodies, got it installed on


Thanksgiving. This was roughly a week before the show and just days before the truck needed to be pulled onto the stage, which was being built


on the other side of the factory.


Once the truck was winched up onto the stage, an artist stenciled “US Xpress” onto the cab and “H2” prominently on various parts of the vehicle.


The Truck Could Not Power Itself, Let Alone Drive, So an Electric
Cable Was Snaked up Through the Stage.


Trevor: The Truck is “Fully Functioning”


According to a source who worked on the project, and as is visible in this photograph, a cable was snaked up from under the stage through the


�oor of the cab to power the cabin screens.



http://n2amotors.com/
Additionally, mockups of the infotainment pages were loaded onto the in-cabin displays.


In an attempt to underscore the functionality of the truck, Trevor put the focus on the only part of it that was turned on–the screens that were


powered by the cable under the stage. But the screens, which had been loaded the day before with largely static webpages, according to our


source, were reluctant to respond to his e�orts (https://youtu.be/4-J7H_XmmWg?t=58).


The statements made by Trevor don’t strike us as optimistic “forward looking” statements. They were not exaggerations. They were simply bald-


faced lies.


In January 2017, following the event, the company raised capital as part of its Series A round. [Pg. F-26


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920002309/a2241198zs-4a.htm)] It also signed partnerships in the months to


come with companies like major automotive supplier Bosch (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-and-bosch-develop-


the-commercial-vehicle-powertrain-of-the-future-35) as well as fuel cell (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-names-


fuel-cell-key-suppliers-38) and hydrogen (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-chooses-nel-as-the-sole-equipment-


supplier-to-create-the-largest-hydrogen-network-in-the-world-39) partners.


Presumably, the misleading representations made at the event helped fuel these new deals. Subsequently, CNH International jumped in with


both an investment (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/cnh-industrial-to-lead-nikolas-series-d-round-with-250mm-usd-investment-64) and


agreement to aid in the manufacturing (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/cnh-industrial-brands-iveco-and-fpt-together-with-nikola-motor-

Following the Show, The Company Abandoned Development of the
Nikola One, According to Text Messages from a Former Employee,
Having Apparently Already Served its Purpose to Draw in Credible
Partners and Investment Capital


To the surprise of people involved in the Nikola One project, development work on the truck did not continue after the show.

It appears the prototype had already served its purpose: giving the company the legitimacy it needed to raise more investment and court larger


partners that would be able to build them an actual working model from start to �nish.


It was not considered necessary to actually back up the false claims that had been made on the stage. Below is a text exchange with a former


employee who corroborated this (in red).

2018: In Order to Continue the Appearance of Progress, Nikola
Posted a YouTube Video of Its Nikola One “In Motion” on the Road.


Text Messages from a Former Employee Reveal the Truck Was
Simply Filmed Rolling Down a Big Hill.  


As time passed and the hype from the December 2016 show faded with no major updates, skepticism began to mount about the Nikola One.


As shown above, no plans were in place to �nish development of the Nikola One. Bosch, which had partnered with Nikola following the show,


was still quite some time away from delivering working prototypes of Nikola’s next development.


To remedy this ‘hype gap’, Nikola teased a tweet (https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/916423596158853120) on October 6  2017 about an


upcoming video:


The �rst video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0UxOyjbpyo), which was �nally released in January, was for major auto parts manufacturer


Phillips, and showed a short clip of the Nikola One easing to a stop sign.


But the main event was another video, entitled “Nikola One in Motion” released the next day on Nikola’s corporate YouTube account


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8&feature=youtu.be) and promoted on social media


(https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/956576016809340928?s=20), garnering 230,000 views on Facebook alone

(https://www.facebook.com/1739715679577092/videos/2039262762955714). This video appeared to show the truck driving on a level road at a


high rate of speed.


The video generated a tremendous amount of buzz and excitement about the pre-production units to be released the following year (which


never happened).


But according to a former employee who spoke with Nikola Chief Engineer Kevin Lynk (https://www.linkedin.com/in/klynk/), the video was


simply the result of Nikola towing the truck to the top of a hill and rolling it down.


(Text messages with former employee. Note slight redactions to protect
source identity)


The deception involved in the production of this video appears to have been elaborate. The company scouted a remote section of road on the


Mormon Trail


(https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5208858,-112.5008986,3a,75y,20.52h,97.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sR8A6qOF2ANQDuBk7eYmBMw!2e0!7i13


312!8i6656?hl=en-US) just to the south of Grantsville, Utah, which we have since located.


This section of road is lightly used and features a 2-mile-long perfectly straight stretch with a consistent 3 percent grade–plenty of length and


enough of a slope to get a motorless truck rolling.

?hl=en-US))


There were no features in the shot that would betray the slope, so the camera could be positioned at an angle that would make the road appear


fairly level, or at times, even uphill (https://youtu.be/IAToxJ9CGb8?t=19):


We Rolled A Vehicle in Neutral Down the Same Hill. We Reached a
Top Speed of 56mph and Rolled for ~2.1 Miles


An investigator sent to the exact site used by Nikola for their video tested the hill in an SUV by parking the vehicle at the top, then rolling from


neutral. He was able to hit a top speed of 56 mph and rolled for approximately 2.1 miles.


(Pictured: Investigator vehicle parked at the top of the hill [license
plate redacted] and rolling down the hill)


The Media Took the Bait, Calling it ‘Road Testing’. Nikola Then
Featured the Video for Arizona Governor Doug Ducey When



https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5208858,-112.5008986,3a,75y,20.52h,97.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sR8A6qOF2ANQDuBk7eYmBMw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en-US

https://youtu.be/IAToxJ9CGb8?t=19
Announcing Its New Manufacturing Facility


Ducey: “This is a HUGE Announcement”


Although the company didn’t speci�cally say the truck was moving under its own power, it was the clear implication. And the video had the desired


results, with industry publications (https://leftlanenews.com/2018/01/26/nikola-one-hydrogen-powered-semi-begins-road-tests-video-99712/)


describing the footage as ‘road testing’:


Another article described the truck (http://livetrucking.com/�rst-look-hydrogen-electric-nikola-one-truck-in-motion/) as “cruising” when it was, in


fact, just rolling down a hill.


The next week, Nikola held a ceremony to celebrate its deal to launch a manufacturing facility in Arizona, featuring the “Nikola One In Motion”


video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-2WMMQ_R2I) at the ceremony.


Immediately after playing the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-2WMMQ_R2I) for the audience, Arizona governor Doug Ducey


exclaimed:


“Today, I’m proud to announce, that Nikola Motor Company, is coming to Arizona. This is a HUGE announcement! This is a


manufacturing headquarters of hydrogen electric semi-trucks that will be moving to our state.”


April 2019: Nikola “Unveiled” a Next Generation Version of NZT O�-
Road Vehicle


The Design Was Quietly Scrapped Within Weeks of the Unveiling
Due to Manufacturing Challenges


At the 2019 Nikola World event, Trevor introduced the company’s luxury version of its o�-road vehicle, the NZT. In a video of the event


(https://youtu.be/2Dc8J3iSLw4?t=1435), Trevor can be seen praising the work that had gone into the design. He described how the vehicle was


“fully enclosed,” o�ered “luxury” design, and had “full HVAC, heating and air conditioning, the �rst one of its kind in the market.”


At the 22:22 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dc8J3iSLw4&feature=youtu.be&t=1342) mark Trevor gushed over the engineering:



https://leftlanenews.com/2018/01/26/nikola-one-hydrogen-powered-semi-begins-road-tests-video-99712/

http://livetrucking.com/first-look-hydrogen-electric-nikola-one-truck-in-motion/

https://youtu.be/2Dc8J3iSLw4?t=1435

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dc8J3iSLw4&feature=youtu.be&t=1342
“When we unveil this, pay close attention to the workmanship. The interior, the exterior. It rivals some of the best automotive


engineering in the world. This is on an o�-road vehicle. This is a moment that people from around the world have been waiting


for.”


Curiously, the new generation closed cabin version of the vehicle was vastly di�erent from the open cabin version, which was set up on a track at


the event for test drives. A video from the site (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4rHkNgpM68) showed the open version:


In fact, the closed cabin version was only a “mock up,” and lacked some of the luxury features Trevor described on stage, such as the A/C, which


could not be accommodated behind the dashboard, according to a former employee.


Within weeks of the event, Nikola management scrapped the design for the NZT because the model was not manufacturable as visualized on


stage, according to the former employee.


The company now faced “a massive redesign” before it could bring the NZT to market, they said.


Despite regularly claiming to develop almost everything in-house, Nikola quietly outsourced the NZT redesign to a small company called Stellar


Strategy LLC (https://stellarstrategyllc.com/). Stellar is sta�ed by former executives of Polaris (https://o�road.polaris.com/en-us/), a well-known


producer of o�-road vehicles who had advised Nikola on the open cabin version.


April 2019: Trevor Claimed on Video That Nikola’s Headquarters
Was Completely O� the Grid, with 3.5 Megawatts of Solar Installed
on Its Roof


Reality: There Were No Solar Panels. The Lack of Panels Is
Corroborated by Local Media and Subsequent Pictures


Trevor has claimed that Nikola has an o�-the-grid headquarters with 3.5 megawatts of solar on its roof, a large installation. In an April 2019 pitch,


for example, at the 10:03 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9J8jizLI2s&feature=youtu.be&t=603) mark, he states:


“We have the only o�-grid headquarters that we know of, completely o� of hydrogen, battery, and solar. We have 3.5 megawatts of


solar up on the roof producing about 18 megawatts of energy a day in our headquarters, and we’re storing 10,000 kilograms of


hydrogen and using fuel cells as energy backup and batteries as energy sources as well. Our company is truly one of the most


innovative companies in the world!”


Despite this claim, an article in June 2019 in BizJournals (https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/06/30/see-inside-nikolas-new-


75phoenix-headquarters.html) stated that the company had yet to install any solar panels on its roof.


We pulled satellite pictures of Nikola’s headquarters (4141 E Broadway Road Phoenix, AZ) from Google Earth Pro and found that all subsequent


overhead views (dated August 2019 and January 2020) showed no sign of solar panels on the roof either:

November 2019: Nikola Announces the Nikola Battery “Prototype
Cell”, Calling It “Game Changing Battery Technology”


In late October 2019, Trevor began teasing on twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1189338143926956033?s=20) that Nikola was going


to change the world with an upcoming announcement that was bigger than anything he had announced in the past:


It would later become clear that the above teaser tweet was issued 2 days before the company signed a Letter of Intent


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7n7d2R3HaSss53) to acquire a battery technology company.


In mid-November, Trevor issued several (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1196478103934996481?s=20) more


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1196649694845272064?s=20) tweets, generating excitement and anticipation for the mystery reveal:

https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1196649694845272064?s=20
Finally, on November 19, 2019, the very day after Nikola began private negotiations to go public, [Pg. 81


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920002309/a2241198zs-4a.htm)] Nikola announced


(https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-to-unveil-game-changing-battery-cell-technology-at-nikola-world-2020-67) that it had


solved one of the greatest challenges facing sustainable energy; a high-density battery.


Nikola certainly didn’t undersell the purported achievement:


“This is the biggest advancement we have seen in the battery world,” said Trevor Milton, CEO, Nikola Motor Company. “We are


not talking about small improvements; we are talking about doubling your cell phone battery capacity. We are talking about


doubling the range of BEVs and hydrogen-electric vehicles around the world.”


Trevor continued to tout the battery technology to his Twitter following, claiming he had seen the cell perform with his own eyes, and promised a


major demonstration at Nikola world 2020.


He estimated the value of the new technology to be worth hundreds of billions. As we later learned, Nikola had signed a letter of intent


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7n7d2R3HaSss53) to acquire the technology for only $56.5 million, which would have made this the most


accretive acquisition in history:

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/7n7d2R3HaSss53
As with past claims, the public representations di�ered signi�cantly from the private reality.


The battery announcement (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-to-unveil-game-changing-battery-cell-technology-at-


nikola-world-2020-67) made reference to a letter of intent to acquire a battery company, though it did not name the company or reveal the letter.


We found the name of the company in litigation records.


Nikola Intended to Acquire the Battery Tech, But A�er the Grand
Announcement, Soon Learned it Was Vaporware.


Furthermore, Nikola Learned the President of the Battery Company
it Intended to Acquire Had Been Indicted Months Earlier A�er
Using His NASA Expense Account to Hire Numerous Prostitutes


In March 2020, Nikola sued the battery company (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd), named ZapGo Ltd., alleging fraud, false


representations, and failure to disclose that the President of ZapGo had been indicted months earlier for tax fraud.


Had anyone at Nikola merely Googled the President of ZapGo, Charles Resnick, they would have found that 6 months earlier Resnick made


national news (https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/04/18/man-conned-his-nasa-funded-lab-into-paying-trips-see-prostitutes-escorts-


feds-say/) for allegedly conning NASA through a scheme to use his expense account to hire numerous prostitutes. Resnick pled guilty


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ezxcgve1TXT062) in January 2020.


Nikola’s complaint (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd) against ZapGo describes how after entering into a Letter of Intent to


acquire the company, and after it had already invested $2.2 million into the company, Nikola realized ZapGo’s claims were highly questionable.


The complaint also made clear that Nikola, through its VP of Technology Development Jason Roycht, learned about the tax fraud issue and false


claims made by ZapGo as early as December 2019:

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd
Despite Learning About the Issues with the Battery Tech in
December 2019, Trevor Was Still Hyping the Tech in February 2020


Despite the issues with ZapGo, Trevor didn’t see any reason to stop touting the battery technology via his Twitter


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1226960334658981889?s=20) account (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1227078692095975424?


s=20):


Nikola formally terminated the agreement (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rSzikFMNdDevxU) on February 26, 2020 and appears to not have


publicly discussed the situation since. The November 19, 2019, Nikola press release (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-


to-unveil-game-changing-battery-cell-technology-at-nikola-world-2020-67) has not been rescinded or corrected, and investors likely believe the


“game changing” battery technology still exists.


It never did.


Powercell AB Spokesman’s Comments on Nikola’s Battery (And
Hydrogen Fuel Cell) Technology: “Hot Air”


In 2017, Nikola signed a deal (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-names-fuel-cell-key-suppliers-38) appointing


Sweden’s Powercell AB as its primary supplier of hydrogen fuel cell stacks. Powercell was an investor spin-out from Volvo


(https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblekhman/2020/05/08/volvos-fuel-cell-truck-alliance-with-daimler-is-a-return-to-the-hydrogen-


bandwagon/#4d49831c27�), one of the world’s largest truck and industrial vehicle makers.


Bosch and Powercell had been completing tests on Nikola’s behalf. But in early April 2019, Powercell issued a statement announcing it was


ending its agreement with Nikola saying the business terms were “totally unacceptable”. (https://www.powercell.se/en/newsroom/press-


releases/detail/?releaseId=40CF208BFB55FBF5)


Just days later, Nikola partner Bosch unveiled a $56.5 million licensing deal (https://www.powercell.se/en/newsroom/press-releases/detail/?


releaseId=9D09953552F747C5), with additional royalties, with Powercell for its S3 fuel cell stacks.

https://www.powercell.se/en/newsroom/press-releases/detail/?releaseId=9D09953552F747C5
Referring to the breakdown of the deal with Nikola after more than two years of tests, Powercell spokesman Marten Wikforss told us by phone


from Sweden this month:


“As you can tell from the press release, the terms we were presented for our cooperation with Nikola were, as we stated, unacceptable.


So we communicated that and in response, they said ‘we’re out of the game’”


“What they communicated when they said they weren’t going to use our parts and fuel cells was initially that they were going to


launch their own fuel cells and it would be so much better or whatever. It was a lot of hot air coming from them…Then you didn’t


hear anything from them. And then all of a sudden they were going to launch a new revolutionizing lithium-ion battery


system too. And I haven’t heard anything about their own fuel cell system and I haven’t heard anything about their


revolutionary battery either.”


He said, however, that there were no restrictions on Powercell’s licensing deal with Bosch and that Bosch could provide batteries to Nikola even


though their direct deal had collapsed.


“We’re providing to Bosch and it’s up to them if they want to supply to companies like Nikola. We haven’t banned sales to certain


clients. They’re free to operate and sell their product.”


When Subsequently Pressed on the Battery Acquisition by Tesla
Fans, Trevor Dodged the Question Then Changed the Story
Completely


Now, an Unnamed University Is Supposedly Developing the
Technology


When skeptical Tesla fans visited Nikola in August of this year, Trevor had a conversation about battery cell technology


(https://youtu.be/heHZYqlLRdE?t=3222). First, he claimed to be working on cells that eliminate all toxic materials, saying he’s been working with


companies to bring the tech to market:


“We’ve essentially worked with some battery companies to bring (those) cells to market.”


The questioner then asked:


“Is this tied to that company you acquired and announced earlier this year…?”


Trevor initially said he was working with “battery companies”, but when the Tesla fan brought up the deal for the company that Trevor (but not


the questioner) knew had failed, he then suddenly changed course and said it was related not to a company, but to an unnamed university:


“No, it’s not actually. It’s tied to a university that had developed the technology. And we essentially ended up licensing all of it and


helping them fund it all the way through.”


Note that Nikola does have a deal with universities to develop (https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/08/07/phoenix-semi-truck-


maker-wins-1-7m-federal-grant.html) fuel cells, but we found no indication that it has anything to do with battery cell technology. We found no


record of any such licensing deal in its �lings.


Following the discussion of the unnamed university, Trevor then downplayed the possibility of a breakthrough, despite his previous claims to


have achieved the breakthrough in November 2019 (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-to-unveil-game-changing-


battery-cell-technology-at-nikola-world-2020-67):

https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-to-unveil-game-changing-battery-cell-technology-at-nikola-world-2020-67
“I hate cell development. Likelihood of success is like hitting the lottery, you know? So, it’s very unlikely you’re gonna develop a


cell that’ll work. So, they did really good work, they had showed that they had thousands of cells that were already being cycled that


were not failing. So, we came in and we helped fund ‘em. We helped provide ‘em funding for equipment that they needed. They


furthered the development and now we’re going to be showing o� cells at Nikola World, we hope.”


The conversation about universities developing the battery tech took place a mere two weeks ago, but now, the company has announced


(https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920102820/tm2030359d1_8k.htm) that it will be using GM’s proprietary


battery technology.


We’re con�dent Nikola’s battery technology simply never existed, yet has now managed to trade that empty promise for GM’s actual capabilities.


June 2020: A�er Years of Deception, Nikola Goes Public—A Massive
Monetization Event That Added Billions of Dollars of Liquidity and
Value from Unknowing Public Market Participants


Nikola went public via a reverse merger on June 4  (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920069004/tm2020911-


3_8k.htm) via a special purpose acquisition company.


Shares of Nikola spiked, largely on the backs of retail investor euphoria. Many inexperienced investors were learning about the company for the


�rst time and, seeing a long list of impressive claims, believed that they were getting in on the ground �oor of the next Tesla.


Overnight, Trevor became a multi-billionaire and a minor social media celebrity. A host of news articles came out comparing him to Elon Musk.


But Being Public Also Brought Criticism. Trevor Quickly Becomes
Obsessed with Short Sellers, Critical Journalists, and Other
“Haters”


We at Hindenburg take pride in reporting on companies that try to silence criticism with intimidation. A functioning market requires diverging


views and opinions in order for investors to be able to make informed decisions.


We also believe that companies engaging in such practices are vastly more likely to have something to hide. In one recent example, MiMedx


Group sued its critics (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mimedx-�les-lawsuit-related-to-short-seller-attacks-300530902.html), only to


be charged criminally with fraud (https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-chief-executive-o�cer-and-chief-operating-o�cer-publicly-


traded) two years later.


Most public company leaders focus on developing their products and their business. But upon going public, Trevor almost immediately took to


lashing out at short sellers and threatening journalists with litigation for writing critical articles:

2020: Trevor Claimed Nikola Produces Hydrogen for Under �3/kg,
~81% Cheaper Than the Rest of The World, Representing a Major
Breakthrough


The high cost of hydrogen, among other issues, has prevented it from becoming a mainstream fuel source for alternative energy vehicles. The


high price tag results from both the cost to isolate hydrogen and the cost of building production facilities/transmission.


Low-cost hydrogen production is critical to Nikola’s �nancial viability, as Nikola’s hydrogen long haul truck sales would rely on a working network


of hydrogen stations. Nikola’s much anticipated fuel cell pickup truck’s existence also hinges (https://insideevs.com/news/435512/trevor-milton-


nikola-badgers-details-sales-operation/) on a hydrogen station roll out.


As part of its hydrogen strategy, Nikola says it is planning on building 700 hydrogen (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-unveils-the-


nikola-badger-pickup-73) stations across the US, with further plans to expand worldwide.


(Source: Nikola’s website
(https://nikolamotor.com/hydrogen))


Per the company’s latest quarterly report:


“This planned construction of hydrogen stations is essential to persuading customers to pay a higher premium for our


trucks.” [Pg. 41 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128920000012/nkla-20200630.htm)]


To build these stations, Nikola announced in a June 2020 press release (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-orders-enough-


electrolysis-equipment-from-nel-to-produce-40000-kgs-of-hydrogen-per-day-79) that it would be purchasing components from Norway-based


Nel ASA.


At Nikola World in December 2019 Trevor claimed on video (https://youtu.be/AkS5C3Zm7mA?t=3038) to a large audience to already be producing


1,000 kilograms of hydrogen a day on site at his Phoenix headquarters:


“In America we’ve already got the largest hydrogen station in the western hemisphere at our headquarters. Can produce


over 1,000 kilograms a day on site.”

https://youtu.be/AkS5C3Zm7mA?t=3038
Subsequent to Nikola world, Trevor reiterated in several public interviews to have already solved this major world problem, describing Nikola as


having achieved breakthroughs in hydrogen production.


In an August 2020 interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbrgQj4xlbk) with Fox Business News, when asked about hydrogen, Trevor says:


“We saw an opportunity to bring the cost of hydrogen down going zero-emission and putting it on parity with diesel, and it’s the �rst


time in history that’s been able to be done, so it went from about $16/kg and we are down now below $4/kg. And there’s a lot of


reasons for that, but the main one is standardization of a hydrogen station worldwide has allowed us to drive that cost down


dramatically. We tell people we’re an energy technology company that happens to build really cool vehicles.”


In another interview on July 17, 2020, on the TeslaCharts podcast, Trevor claimed Nikola has been able to “chop the cost of hydrogen from


$16/kg down to – we’re down below $3/kg on our hydrogen now.”[1] [11:34 (https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-trevor-


milton?play=true)]. This would mark an astonishing 81.25% reduction in the cost of hydrogen.


When challenged again about Nikola’s hydrogen production cost by the TeslaCharts podcast host [25:00


(https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-trevor-milton?play=true)], Trevor repeats the question, compliments the host on


asking the question, claims he has “so much experience” with answering the question, says he “knows the stu� better than anyone he has ever


encountered” and says he has spent “7 years” driving the cost of hydrogen down.


But he then admits that many of the “changes” in the hydrogen world he has seen are “not so much on the technology side” and that Nikola has


“seen maybe a 5% or 10% increase in e�ciency across the board” in hydrogen technology. But that’s “not what changes the world,” Trevor says.


After providing an anecdote about his father, and o�ering some other sidetrack discussion, he then admits that Nikola’s entire answer to


bringing down the cost was to simply standardize a hydrogen station. “The standardization of the hydrogen station was the most important


aspect,” Trevor says.


Such standardization would clearly bring costs down, but Nikola already claimed to have accomplished the feat without having a single


production facility of its own.


When Pressed on the Subject in July 2020, Trevor Acknowledged
Nikola Produces No Hydrogen at All. The Claims Made at Nikola
World and In Multiple Interviews Were, Once Again, Completely
Fictitious


In a subsequent interview on July, 2020 (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-trevor-milton-founder-executive-chairman-nikola-


meckmann/?trackingId=nIXxnt4u0GFFIunPZCD9Uw%3D%3D), when pressed about hydrogen production, Trevor acknowledged producing no


hydrogen at all:


Trevor:


“The station is designed to store and pump about 1,000 kg’s per day. Electrolyzers are going in now and should be


operational with zero emission solar production by Nikola World 2020. We have 2.5 megawatts of solar going up now at the


facility. The station functions now, but we do not sell it to the public.“


Interviewer:


“OK, so for the record: You’re currently producing no hydrogen but you’re planning to produce 1 metric ton/day using 100% solar


energy by the end of the year? What are you going to use it for by then?” 


Trevor:

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-trevor-milton-founder-executive-chairman-nikola-meckmann/?trackingId=nIXxnt4u0GFFIunPZCD9Uw%3D%3D
“The permitting process of producing hydrogen takes much longer than storing and pumping it. We spent the last year


building the largest hydrogen station in the western world in Phoenix, AZ at our HQ. Now we will spend the next 5 months


installing the hydrogen production (Electrolyzers, Power Electronics, Thermal, Etc.) into that station.”


We found the admission to be unsurprising when we learned who was in charge of Nikola’s e�orts to develop and roll out its supposedly


revolutionary hydrogen production capabilities.


Nikola’s Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure Is Trevor
Milton’s Brother, Who Worked Paving Driveways in Hawaii Prior To
Joining at Nikola


Given the complicated nature of hydrogen, we wanted to look closer into the resumes of who Nikola has put in charge of such a critical and


dangerous aspect of their business.


We expected to �nd that Nikola had hired a world-renowned scientist to lead its revolutionary hydrogen e�orts. Instead, it appears Nikola has


appointed Trevor Milton’s brother, Travis, as the Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure.


Travis has held his title at Nikola for over 5 years, beginning January 2015, according to his LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-milton-


4b968153/).


(Source: Travis Milton LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-

Interestingly, he seems to have landed in this crucial position the same month he �nished his last job, where his LinkedIn lists him as “President”


of “Self-Employed” in Maui, Hawaii.


(Source: Travis Milton LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-

We found a number of endorsements for construction work from individuals in Maui, Hawaii.

Eventually, we found a website (http://www.ericnewman.com/TravisMilton.htm) that highlighted Travis’ work pouring concrete and building a


barn as a subcontractor in Maui.


(Source: Travis Milton, Flatwork and Framing, Maui
(http://www.ericnewman.com/TravisMilton.htm))


“Mr. Milton poured two long and challenging driveways (one driveway was the world’s steepest), and extensive walkways with


elaborate embossed Hawaiian leaves,” the website says.

joining Nikola and allegedly revolutionizing the hydrogen fuel
industry)


We’re not sure how this work prepped Travis for a key role in solving one of the world’s greatest scienti�c challenges, but he appears to have


been handsomely rewarded for his discoveries.


Trevor has given Travis, along with other family members of Trevor and select early employees, stock worth over $110 million as of this


writing. [Pg. 116 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920004261/a2242128z424b3.htm)]


One source we spoke with, who previously worked with Travis, described him as not having a formal role and as someone Trevor “kept around” if


they “needed someone to hold a rope, or something like that” while they were working on vehicles.


Nikola’s Head of Infrastructure Development, In Charge Of
“Leading Development” Of Nikola’s 700+ Hydrogen Station
Network, Is the Former CEO And General Manager of a Golf Club In
Idaho


Also central to the company’s hydrogen station initiative is Nikola’s “Head of Infrastructure Development”.


Once again, we might anticipate that the rollout of Nikola’s coast-to-coast hydrogen production network would be managed by an individual with


an extensive background in both science as well as large infrastructure developments.


For this task, the company chose Dale Prows, who is described at the 13:20 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=LbNopvpSbzU&feature=youtu.be&t=798) mark in a video produced for investors ahead of the company going public, as “one of our hydrogen


experts.”


Prows joined Nikola after spending almost 4 years as CEO and General Manager at a residential golf course in Idaho.

Prows, along with Travis Milton, are apparently going to spearhead building the world’s �rst network of 700 hydrogen production and fueling


stations.

“All the e-axles at Nikola were developed by Kevin… (These include) rotor, stator, cooling, thermal, gears, and sometimes inverters.”


(Note that the e-axles appear to be mostly developed by Bosch (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-bosch/bosch-partners-with-startup-


nikola-on-electric-long-haul-truck-idUSKCN1BU1TO).) We reviewed Kevin’s biography on LinkedIn and found that prior to Nikola, he worked for 7


months designing oil�eld products using CAD software, 3.5 years in software development, and prior to that spent 9 months repairing pinball


machines.


Here is the rest of his resume after college and before Nikola, per his Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/klynk/):


Trevor Milton in 2020: We Make All Our Inverters In-House


Reality: Nikola Buys Inverters from a Third-Party Supplier. A July
Video Shows the Inverter, but the Label of the Manufacturer is
Covered with Masking Tape


After the critical Bloomberg article (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-capability-of-his-


debut-truck), it seemed there was an undercurrent of skepticism that Trevor became obsessed with countering.


Nikola had always made claims that its components were developed in-house, dating back to Nikola’s �rst press release


(https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-company-formed-to-transform-u-s-transportation-industry-25) on May 9, 2016:


“The majority of the semi-trucks components are being developed by Nikola.”


Yet these claims never seemed to make sense. As we have already shown, Nikola’s early history was that of a company loudly claiming to have


vast proprietary technology while quietly signing partnership agreements with third-party suppliers.


The chorus of doubts among Nikola’s “haters” grew louder after it became a public company.


When people would ask skeptically what Nikola had ever actually developed, Trevor would respond with a list of components such as batteries


and inverters made in-house. See examples, here (https://twitter.com/laurisyrjaniemi/status/1269176058768752640), here


(https://twitter.com/moonwalk19691/status/1278359414811099136) and here (https://twitter.com/IsaacTaub56/status/1279654385686102016):

https://twitter.com/IsaacTaub56/status/1279654385686102016
Trevor later attempted to counter skeptics by showing videos of the two prototype trucks that had been built with partner Bosch, suggesting that


this somehow disproved the allegation that the earlier truck he built had never been �nished.


In one such video, on July 14 , 2020 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2LDmkEmP0), Trevor walks viewers through the Powertrain for the


Nikola Two. At the 29:30 (https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=1770) mark Trevor begins describing the in-house inverters and how other OEMs are


asking to use Nikola’s proprietary inverter tech:


“We do all the e-axle design in house. All the gears, the gear reductions. The thermal the cooling. Even the controls that go with it. And,


also, the inverters as well. All inverters on the Nikola truck are probably some of the most advanced software systems that I


know of anywhere in the automotive world. Why do I know that? It’s because other OEMs are asking us to use it.”


At the 7:02 mark (https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=422), we can see the inverters up close. There is a relatively inconspicuous green piece of


masking tape on the component:


Here it is up close:

https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=1770

https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=422
The inverter is not proprietary to Nikola. Cascadia Motion, a small company in Portland, o�ers such inverters o� the shelf


(https://cascadiamotion.com/images/catalog/DataSheets/RM300.pdf). The tape is covering the label which would normally show the product


description and other speci�cations that make clear who built the component:


We texted a sales engineer for Cascadia and asked if the model was available to the public or if it was a customer speci�c model, and they


con�rmed that it was for sale to the public.


This follows the same pattern. Nikola has regularly used o�-the-shelf products from third parties, while claiming to have vast internal proprietary


technology and to “design” all the products itself. It then partners with companies that actually have the components Nikola claimed to have


already developed internally.


July 2020: Trevor on the Nikola “Tre” Truck: “We Have 5 of Them
Coming O� the Assembly Line Right Now”


Bosch Spokesperson In September: We Don’t Have Any Yet



https://cascadiamotion.com/images/catalog/DataSheets/RM300.pdf
In February 2020 (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/cnh-industrial-brands-iveco-and-fpt-together-with-nikola-motor-company-announce-


future-nikola-tre-production-in-ulm-germany-72), a deal was unveiled to produce the Nikola Tre in Europe on an Iveco S-way platform


(https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/cnh-industrial-brands-iveco-and-fpt-together-with-nikola-motor-company-announce-future-nikola-tre-


production-in-ulm-germany-72) and using Bosch electronics.


(Pictured: Inveco S-Way vs. the planned Nikola Tre)


Nikola had said it would be ready to show o� the Tre (https://www.newequipment.com/research-and-development/article/21120985/fpt-iveco-


and-nikola-motors-unveil-the-nikola-tre-prototype) at the Hannover IAA trade Fair this September, the most prestigious in Europe.


In a July 2020 podcast (https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-trevor-milton?play=true), (39 minute mark) Trevor gave the


impression it was all systems go – at least on the initial BEV model:


“We have the most advanced battery electric truck in the world. We have a truck coming into production right now with 720 kwh the


largest battery we know of on a truck anywhere in the world coming into production. We have �ve of them coming o� the


assembly line right now in Ulm Germany. They’ll enter production end of next year-ish, somewhere around there.”


But in a phone interview on Sept. 9, Bosch said not so.


Thorsten Schoenfeld, spokesman for Bosch’s electro-mobility unit at headquarters in Germany said this:


“No they are not ready yet. I don’t know exactly the year but we’re working on it.”


When asked what exactly the Nikola-Iveco-Bosch partnership had planned to show at the Hannover trade fair – now canceled due to Covid-19,


Schoenfeld said:


“We would have shown di�erent innovations and a kind of truck but not a real truck but a showcase.”


July 2020: Nikola Posts Video of Nikola Two Going “0-60 in Under 5
Seconds”


Reality: The Vehicle Was Already Rolling When the Video Started
and it Still Took Over 10 Seconds


Following the Nikola One “demonstration”, the company was successful in raising capital and bringing on a number of legitimate partners.


Automotive supply heavyweight Bosch agreed to work with Nikola in September 2017 (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-motor-


company-and-bosch-develop-the-commercial-vehicle-powertrain-of-the-future-35), and, by all reports, (https://www.bosch-


presse.de/pressportal/de/en/commercial-vehicle-innovation-enabler-bosch-brings-advanced-solutions-to-the-new-nikola-two-truck-187968.html)


largely built its Nikola Two prototype trucks.


In a tweet (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283425947199221761?s=20), Trevor posted a video claiming to showcase the Nikola Two


prototype’s acceleration capabilities:

https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283425947199221761?s=20
The video begins with the truck already rolling. By just using a basic stopwatch, we can see that it takes over 10 seconds between the start and


Trevor exclaiming “there it is” on the video. The speedometer is not visible, and we obviously have no ability to see what is actually powering the


truck.


[Click here to see the video, with a stopwatch (https://youtu.be/rSiWPNe2llU)]


In response to questions about the veracity of the video (1 (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283429144970158080?s=20),2


(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283449179776245761?s=20)), Trevor promised that professional video would soon follow, but we have


seen no such update.


Overall, information has been sparse on the Nikola Two. Last month, several Tesla fans toured the Nikola facility and rode in the prototypes, with


some reporting that they were surprised the EV truck was so loud (https://youtu.be/P1OuEzE-krI?t=662). Apparently, the AC had been turned on


full blast, which kept the riders cool from the Arizona heat but also fueled skepticism.


There have been several videos of the prototypes built (https://www.bosch.com/stories/fuel-cell-truck-nikola-two/) by Bosch


(https://techacute.com/nikola-bosch-40-ton-fuel-cell-truck-two/) being driven around parking lots (1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?


v=rphYdZNP_ko),2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h30TNwfq_Ss)) and at unknown speeds carrying unknown-sized loads in stylized videos


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiB5MHnL7eU), but once again, investors and partners are left in the dark about what Nikola really has.


Nikola’s Former CFO Le� and Sued the Company. The Entire Docket
is Sealed—But A Month A�er the Lawsuit Nikola Suddenly
Announced it Had Refunded All Truck Deposits.


Did They Ever Really Exist?


In March 2018, Nikola’s former Chief Financial O�cer (https://www.ttnews.com/articles/nikola-motor-hires-jonathan-spira-chief-�nancial-o�cer)


Jonathan Spira �led a lawsuit (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3QyB36jP4g9nYN) against the company, with Nikola countersuing


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/MTsSTmizJ497cx) several months later.


A sudden change in CFO is often a red �ag. A CFO that departs while suing the company obviously is an even bigger red �ag. Both cases were


eventually dismissed. The allegations remain unclear, and it is unclear whether they were dismissed as part of a settlement.

Prior to the lawsuit by its CFO, Nikola claimed to have (https://electrek.co/2016/06/13/nikola-motor-pre-orders-worth-2-billion-electric-truck/)


7,000 pre-orders with deposits, a total potential value of $2.3 billion for its proposed electric truck. Industry watchers viewed the numbers with


skepticism at the time. Per CleanTechnica (https://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/30/nikola-motor-company-completely-drops-plans-battery-


electric-semitrucks-despite-taking-10-5-million-reservation-deposits-focus-now-hydrogen-fuel-cell-trucks/):


“Despite reportedly taking $10.5 million in reservation deposits (across ~7,000 preorders), the Nikola Motor Company has completely


backed away from its plans to o�er a battery-electric Nikola One semi-truck, according to recent reports.”


“…Bad news for those who put down reservations (if the reservation �gures were accurate/true)”.


A month after the lawsuit was �led, Nikola suddenly announced via Twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/981656644030377984?s=20)


that it was refunding all deposits


Industry blog Green Car Reports (https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1116155_nikola-suggests-its-no-tesla-refunds-deposits-on-fuel-cell-


electric-semi-trucks) described the move to refund deposits with confusion:


“The point of refunding the deposits remains somewhat unclear, however, even if Nikola is �ush with orders and cash. Customers that


have sent the company money have skin in the game, meaning they’re more likely to follow through with their purchases at the end of


the day.”


Nikola’s Order Book: More Flu� Than Substance


As of the latest quarter, Nikola reported 14,000 cancelable reservations for its trucks. [Pg. 35 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128920000012/nkla-20200630.htm)]


The most high-pro�le reservation regularly discussed is Anheuser Busch’s contract


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920001479/a2240989zex-10_16.htm) for 800 trucks. The agreement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920001479/a2240989zex-10_16.htm) provides signi�cant outs however, allowing


Budweiser to cancel (i) anytime with 1-year notice (ii) if a 90-day road test doesn’t perform up to expectations; or (iii) if the products aren’t


delivered at all.


At the time of the Anheuser Busch deal, Ryder was to perform all servicing (https://www.freightwaves.com/news/green-trucking/anheuser-busch-


to-buy-nikola-hydrogen-electric-trucks?rq=anheuser-busch), but that relationship has since ended (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-


releases/nikola-and-ryder-terminate-service-partner-agreement-to-allow-each-other-to-expand-partnership-opportunities-301068059.html).


Nikola has also publicized its deal with Arizona trash company (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-receives-landmark-order-of-2500-


battery-electric-waste-trucks-from-republic-services-91) Republic Services, with an order for 2,500 refuse trucks based on the Nikola Tre. Those


appear to be for battery electric vehicles (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/republic-services-announces-partnership-with-nikola-to-


develop-and-purchase-2-500-electric-collection-trucks-301108899.html) not hydrogen-powered models. Nikola stated the refuse trucks would be


supplied from the Nikola factory at Coolidge, which has barely begun.


The rest of the “reservation” book seems non-committal. In investment bank Cowen’s initiation of coverage report


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/qlz1HHDwozdity) for Nikola, it noted:

“U.S. Xpress makes up more than one-third of the 14,600+ reservations on hand”


Were U.S. Xpress to complete such an order it would amount to (https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/nikola-hits-34-billion-market-


value-and-no-revenue#:~:text=Although%20Nikola%20touts%20reservations%20for,into%20binding%20contracts%20with%20deposits.) ~$3.5


billion in value. But as of its last quarterly report, U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on hand. [Pg. 3 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/923571/000155837020009301/usx-20200630x10q.htm)] There is no realistic way that the company could possibly


order the number of trucks it has “reserved”.


Having a large order book sounds great but having buyers both willing and credibly able to pay is another matter entirely.


Nikola’s Fixation with NDAs, Secrecy, and Legal Intimidation


Often, the two most glaring red �ags that something is amiss at a company are (a) an obsession with secrecy and (b) the constant threat of legal


action or retaliation against anyone who speaks out.


Companies typically use a common justi�cation for such paranoia—they’ve found the holy grail of something and they must take all measures to


prevent competitors from �nding out about it.


Often, in these cases, the real secret is that there really isn’t much behind the curtain at all.


During our research, we reached out to multiple former Nikola employees. We were told by one that Nikola had issued a legal warning to all


former employees to intimidate them into not discussing the company.


Recently, several Tesla fans visited Nikola and were required to sign NDAs (https://youtu.be/P1OuEzE-krI?t=580).


We even reached out to the actors in a Nikola commercial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0UxOyjbpyo) showing the Nikola One “in motion”


(see section above). We found that the actors had been required to sign NDAs. What proprietary secrets could an actor standing next to a truck


possibly learn that require them to be muzzled?


At One Point, Nikola Claimed to Own its Own Natural Gas Wells


Yet Now, All Mentions of These Supposedly Owned Wells are Gone.
We Found No Mention of Nikola Ever Owning Natural Gas Wells in
its SEC Filings


Nikola’s claim to own its own energy sources (like its �ctitious hydrogen production operation) is not particularly new. At various points in its


history, Nikola has claimed to own natural gas wells, despite no evidence we could identify suggesting this was the case.


For example, the Internet Archive (https://web.archive.org/web/20160701211732/https:/nikolamotor.com/one) shows Nikola’s bold claims of


being able to “guarantee” cheap fuel for its prospective customers because it actually owned natural gas wells.


One astute follower of the company asked about the “gas wells” to which the Nikola corporate account stated “we still have them.” If that was


ever the case, where were they and where did they go? Why weren’t they mentioned as an asset in the company’s prospectus


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920002309/a2241198zs-4a.htm)?

Trevor: Has Previously Said “I Don’t Back Down
(https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273350777772208128?s=20)” In
the Face of Criticism


Prove it: Here Are 53 Questions—Let’s See How Many He Backs Down
from Answering


Trevor has succeeded at intimidating many with threats of litigation. As we’ve said many times before, we welcome such threats. We �nd that


litigious executives often have the most to hide. Sometimes executives will only answer probing questions under oath (if ever).


But on the o� chance we are just �at out wrong about absolutely everything, here is Trevor’s opportunity to prove it. These are the speci�c


questions we think investors in Nikola and, largely, investors in Trevor deserve the answers to:


1. Did you have your service personnel traverse the country to conceal potentially fatal defects with dHybrid’s product to close the deal with
Worthington, as alleged by one of your former employees on recorded audio?


2. What was the rationale for Worthington’s later impairment
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/108516/000119312515271107/d943911d10k.htm) of dHybrid and the write-o� of $1.5 million in
warranty expenses (https://s24.q4cdn.com/947644764/�les/transcript/2016-Q3-WOR-Transcript.pdf)?


3. In May 2015, you represented in a legally binding contract (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CPnFrrz696Ia4W) with EVdrive to have “new
and valuable proprietary turbine technology”. Months later, emails showed you were in discussions with Brayton to purchase their turbines.
Did you have any “new and valuable turbine technology” at the time you represented having it?


4. If so, what was it, and why did you then need to buy turbine technology from Brayton?
5. Before suddenly pivoting to fuel cells, you claimed (https://www.ccjdigital.com/electric-truck-company-says-more-than-7000-have-been-pre-


ordered/) that your Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) technology was “10-15 years ahead of any other OEM in fuel e�ciencies, MPG, and
emissions”. Why did you suddenly abandon this supposedly revolutionary technology rather than sell it for billions of dollars?


6. In December 2016, you claimed at Nikola World, on video, that the Nikola One “fully functions and works…this is a real truck—this is not a
pusher.” You later admitted (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-capability-of-his-
debut-truck) that it was NOT fully functional to Bloomberg. Did you brazenly lie, or was this just a series of multiple honest mistakes?


7. After the Bloomberg piece, you claimed on Twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273350775998017536?s=20) that there was a
table with truck gears and components sitting in front of the audience for all to see. The event was extensively documented—can you
present evidence that such a table existed in plain view for the entire audience?


8. Do you think a table with gears sitting somewhere would in any way invalidate your claims at the time that the truck fully functioned?
9. After lambasting Bloomberg’s reporter publicly (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1273350775998017536?s=20), calling him a


“deceiver” and saying he should be �red, you then promised the full audio of the interview with Bloomberg would be released. Why haven’t
you released it yet?


10. Do you think it’s wise to threaten to sue journalists for getting a story totally correct?
11. In August 2016, you claimed (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-achieves-zero-emissions-29) “Nikola has


engineered the holy grail of the trucking industry”, pivoting to hydrogen from natural gas. Now that you have acknowledged the Nikola
One wasn’t fully “engineered” at the time of the statement or the December show, do you wish to retract this press release in full?


12. Did the Nikola One truck have hydrogen turbines or Brayton CNG turbines at the time of the demonstration in December? Was the fueling
system hydrogen or CNG?


13. Why did you say just two weeks before Nikola’s sudden “pivot” to hydrogen (https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-one-truck-
achieves-zero-emissions-29) that “CNG is the way to go” on Twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/756692103632031744?s=20) if
you were imminently planning to announce a switch?

14. Did you have an artist come in and stencil “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric” on the side of the Nikola One despite the truck having
natural gas components installed?


15. Do you still consider the Nikola One to have been “fully functioning” despite needing to snake an electricity cord up through the stage in
order to power the otherwise completely non-working vehicle?


16. For the “Nikola One in Motion” video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8&feature=youtu.be), will you con�rm that you towed
the non-functioning truck to the top of a hill and just �lmed it rolling down?


17. Which Nikola employees knew about the “plan” for the Nikola One in Motion video and which ones participated in creating it? Did those
include Kevin Lynk, your Chief Engineer?


18. When you released the above video, the Nikola Twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolamotor/status/956576016809340928?s=20) account said,
“Pre-production units to hit �eets in 2019 for testing”. Former employees state that no work continued on the Nikola One. What work did
you ever complete on the Nikola One after the show?


19. At the time, did you think pre-production units of the Nikola One would just magically produce themselves?
20. When you “unveiled (https://youtu.be/2Dc8J3iSLw4?t=1435)” the NZT in April 2019 you praised the vehicle and its engineering, yet a former


employee described it as only a “mock up” and said you scrapped the design after the show due to a need for a “massive re-design”. How do
you respond?


21. According to you, Nikola designs most things in-house. Did you outsource the redesign of the NZT to Stellar Strategy?
22. You claimed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9J8jizLI2s&feature=youtu.be&t=603) that Nikola’s headquarters has 3.5 MW of solar


panels on the roof, yet later media reports (https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/06/30/see-inside-nikolas-new-75phoenix-
headquarters.html) and pictures of the roof show they don’t exist. Where did they go?


23. In October 2019, you teased (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1189338143926956033?s=20) a major battery breakthrough 2 days
before signing a letter of intent with ZapGo. You then announced that you had revolutionized the battery industry, before realizing that it
was vaporware and ultimately suing the company (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd). Why didn’t you correct the press
release or update your investors on the status of the deal, which had fallen apart?


24. In December 2019 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/64jkeQOckX9utd), Jason Roycht, your VP of Technology Development, realized that
ZapGo’s President had been indicted for fraud (https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/04/18/man-conned-his-nasa-funded-lab-
into-paying-trips-see-prostitutes-escorts-feds-say/). He raised alarms about the company’s relationship with Porsche, which he determined
was overstated. Why did you hype the battery tech in February on Twitter (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1227078692095975424?
s=20) despite already knowing of all these issues?


25. You formally terminated (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rSzikFMNdDevxU) the agreement for the apparent “game changing battery
technology” from ZapGo on February 26 , 2020. It is now 6+ months later. Have you ever publicly acknowledged that this major deal fell
apart?


26. In August 2020 when speci�cally questioned about the deal (https://youtu.be/heHZYqlLRdE?t=3222) by a Tesla fan, why didn’t you take the
opportunity to let people know that it had fallen through?


27. You instead told the questioner (https://youtu.be/heHZYqlLRdE?t=3222) that you had a deal with an unnamed university relating to their
battery technology and that Nikola had funded the research. Which university were you working with on the battery technology, how much
did you fund them with, and exactly what have you developed in conjunction with them thus far? Will you post the agreement for all to see?


28. You claimed in an interview to have succeeded at cutting the cost of hydrogen by ~81% from peers, stating “we’re down below $3/kg on our
hydrogen now”. How much hydrogen has Nikola produced at this price, if any?


29. At Nikola World 2019 you claimed on video (https://youtu.be/AkS5C3Zm7mA?t=3038) to be producing 1,000 kg of hydrogen per day at your
headquarters. When pressed by a reporter, you later admitted (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-trevor-milton-founder-executive-
chairman-nikola-meckmann/?trackingId=nIXxnt4u0GFFIunPZCD9Uw%3D%3D) that you produce no hydrogen. Did you lie about producing
hydrogen on camera to the entire audience at Nikola World?


30. Why did you appoint your brother (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-milton-4b968153/) Travis as “Director of Hydrogen
Production/Infrastructure”? What experience does he have in hydrogen research and production?


31. What would you say are Travis’ key contributions to Nikola’s alleged breakthrough advancements in hydrogen production?
32. What led you to select Dale Prows (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dale-prows-b21646b/), whose previous employment consisted of managing


a golf course, to be the “Head of Infrastructure Development”?
33. Do you really develop all your inverters in-house (https://twitter.com/laurisyrjaniemi/status/1269176058768752640) or do you buy them


from Cascadia (https://cascadiamotion.com/images/catalog/DataSheets/RM300.pdf)?
34. Why did you put a piece of tape over the Cascadia (https://cascadiamotion.com/images/catalog/DataSheets/RM300.pdf) label when you


were presenting your supposed “in-house” inverter on video (https://youtu.be/7C2LDmkEmP0?t=1770)?
35. What OEMs have asked to use “your” inverters in their products?
36. Why did you post a video (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283425947199221761?s=20) saying the Nikola Two had gone from 0-


60mph in under 5 seconds when anyone with a stopwatch can see that it took at least 10 seconds?
37. Following the 0-60 video you promised (https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1283429144970158080?s=20) to post a professional version


of the video, saying it was just being edited. But you never did. Why? Does the Nikola Two have as much power as you’ve claimed it has?
38. In the TeslaCharts podcast (https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-trevor-milton) at the 40:20 minute mark you said


regarding hydrogen stations: “we’re gobbling up the best locations right now“. Yet your latest quarterly report (https://www.sec.gov/ix?
doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128920000012/nkla-20200630.htm) showed no real estate assets aside from your current
headquarters. Where exactly are these locations that you have been “gobbling up”? How many have you purchased already?


39. What is the hold up with your Coolidge facility construction? Have plans been submitted yet
(https://www.pinalcentral.com/coolidge_examiner/news/nikola-corp-announces-coolidge-groundbreaking/article_413f3380-881b-58f1-8416-
bad1d2a1c25a.html#:~:text=Miller%20noted%20that%20the%20July,site%20plans%20for%20the%20facility.) and permits been received?
Why is there virtually no sign of progress (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=vQ-WFUuFGXo&feature=emb_title)?

40. Why do you spend so much time on social media �ghting your “haters” and threatening former employees with litigation over NDA
enforcement? Don’t you have a factory to build and products to produce?


41. When you sold your St. George Security & Alarms company in an $300,000 deal, your business partner, who said he had a 50/50 deal with
you, only received ~$100,000, according to him. Did you get more than him despite having a 50/50 arrangement?


42. The buyer of the alarm business said you misled him and that customer contracts and other deals fell through post-sale. What happened?
43. How much did you make when you sold the alarm business a second time? How much of those proceeds did your apparent “50/50”


business partner receive?
44. You claimed (https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenli1/2020/05/18/nikola-motor-company-trevor-milton-2020/#de8228490f63) that


uPillar.com had 80 million monthly active users and that you had beat Amazon (https://youtu.be/oaP0SL3-WKM?t=110) to the shopping
cart, despite launching in 2009. A former employee called the 80 million number “absurd”, and media articles at the time describe the page
views far lower. What evidence can you show that you had that number of page views?


45. Do you realize the internet shopping cart was invented 15 years earlier, in 1994 (https://money.com/online-shopping-history-anniversary/)?
46. Swift �led a lawsuit against your company dHybrid in mid-2012 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3J5amtkGnucK6c), alleging, among other


things, that you had used its investment for personal use. Can you produce bank records showing how you used dHybrid funds? Did you
divert funds to uPillar.com?


47. When you reached out to Ryder Systems about an investment in dHybrid in 2011, you said that the Swift contract was for $250 million,
when the actual agreement (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6sXvdQd2NJILrW) only shows it was $16 million. Why the large discrepancy?


48. In another dHybrid presentation, you claimed the Swift contract was for $300 million. What evidence can you present that shows your Swift
contract was for $250-$300 million, and not the $16 million in the actual agreement?


49. Did you claim to sPower that you had �nished the dHybrid system and then misrepresent its results to them, as alleged in their lawsuit
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rcKmJJOgNPQsyM)?


50. When you launched dHybrid Systems in 2012, why did you claim in marketing materials to have started the business in 2011?
51. In 2018 you were sued (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3QyB36jP4g9nYN) by your former CFO. What were the allegations in the


complaint, which is now sealed?
52. You claimed (https://web.archive.org/web/20160701211732/https:/nikolamotor.com/one) Nikola owned its own natural gas wells, then re-


a�rmed (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000104746920002309/a2241198zs-4a.htm) that you “still have them” when
later asked what happened to them. Can you provide any documentation proving Nikola owns/owned natural gas wells?


53. Have you ever deceived anyone?


Our Conclusion: Nikola is a Massive Fraud Constructed on Dozens of
Lies


Sometimes people misspeak by accident. No one has a perfect memory, and we all occasionally get things wrong.


But what we have witnessed at Nikola, and speci�cally from Trevor Milton, is a pattern of well-planned and deliberate acts of deception ranging


from (a) the staging of non-working products as if fully functional, wrapped in numerous lies about capabilities that don’t exist; (b) the staging of


misleading videos, which require extensive premeditation, planning and execution; (c) material lies about capabilities, partnerships and products


that simply do not exist at all, on video and often in front of entire rooms full of people; and (d) a culture of secrecy and intimidation that to this


point has largely kept it all under wraps.


We think Trevor Milton is incapable of telling the truth. We believe he lies like most people breathe. It is natural for him, and our extensive review


of his history suggests it has been this way throughout his entire business career.


Every now and then a story comes around that exposes how little the “experts” really know. Theranos had inked partnerships with Walgreens,


Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and had sta�ed its board with luminaries. Mado� raised billions in capital from sophisticated investors across the


globe.


The remarkable thing about Nikola’s story is not that someone like Trevor Milton exists, but that he has managed to parlay his stories and lies


into deals with some of the best manufacturers and partners in the world by claiming to own vast proprietary technology and having successfully


built revolutionary products that simply didn’t exist.


He transformed these deceptions and false promises into an empire that at one point was valued (https://www.autonews.com/automakers-


suppliers/nikola-hits-34-billion-market-value-and-no-


revenue#:~:text=The%20%2434%20billion%20market%20capitalization,%241%20billion%20year%20in%202023.) at $34 billion, larger than Ford


and Fiat Chrysler (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/electric-truck-nikola-goes-past-ford-in-market-cap-2020-06-09). He’s signed deals with


GM, Anheuser Busch, Bosch, Worthington, and a slew of signi�cant automotive players. He received investment from Fidelity and ValueAct,


among other name-brand institutions.

We truly think Nikola is both a sign of the times and a story for the ages.


Appendix: Additional Backstory


2005: Trevor’s First Business—A Local Security Company, Where He
Apparently Burned Parties on Both Sides of a Deal


Trevor’s business career began when he was in his early twenties and opened a company that sold security systems door-to-door in St. George,


Utah. Trevor described the resulting early success in an interview (https://youtu.be/oaP0SL3-WKM?t=73): “I built that company up and within


about a year or two I had sold it for almost two million dollars, and I thought I was on top of the world.”


The company, called St. George Security and Alarms, was registered in 2004, according to the Utah Secretary of State website. Two years later,


Trevor and a business partner sold the company for a payment of $300,000 up front and monthly payments of around $5,000 that brought the


total purchase price of the business to $850,000, according to the buyer, who we interviewed.


The buyer told us that he realized soon after purchasing the business that it was not as Trevor had portrayed it; pending contracts fell through


and it turned out that customers had been overpromised during the door-to-door sales process. The buyer put the business back to Trevor, as


the purchase agreement allowed, and took a complete loss of $300,000. Trevor then re-sold the business a second time to another company in


Salt Lake for an unknown sum, he said.


Notably, when we contacted Trevor’s business partner, he said he received about $100,000 from the sale – about what he put into the business –


and that it was news to him that the buyer agreed to pay more than the initial upfront payment or that the business had been sold a second


time. He also said that if Trevor sold the business for $2 million then Trevor owes him $900,000.


It’s unclear whether Trevor actually became a millionaire two years after founding his �rst business, but he had already allegedly burned a


business partner and the acquirer of that business.


July 2009: Trevor Launched uPillar.com, a Website He Claimed Had
80 Million Monthly Active Users, Invented the Online Shopping
Cart and Was Beating Amazon


Former Employee: 80 Million Users Claim is “Absurd”. uPillar Was
a Failed Craigslist/eBay Clone and The Shopping Cart Was Invented
in 1994


Trevor’s account of his rise in the business world follows the “$2 million” alarm company sale with claims he reinveste (https://youtu.be/oaP0SL3-


WKM?t=111)d (https://youtu.be/oaP0SL3-WKM?t=111) the money from the alarm company into uPillar.com, a website he launched in July 2009.


The site o�ered free classi�ed ads (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090714006051/en/Upillar.com-Sets-Online-Sellers-Free.-


That%E2%80%99s-Classi�ed%E2%80%A6) and monetized by charging car dealers


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090714006062/en/Upillar.com-Motors-Set-Fuel-Online-Vechicle-Sales) to sell used cars online.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090714006062/en/Upillar.com-Motors-Set-Fuel-Online-Vechicle-Sales
These days in interviews, Trevor describes uPillar as a rapidly growing company that was beating Amazon and eBay (https://youtu.be/oaP0SL3-


WKM?t=110):


“[It was] way ahead of its time actually…we were beating Amazon at what they were doing.


We had the �rst ever shopping cart in history. No one else had ever developed a shopping cart to buy 50 items from 50 di�erent


sellers, checkout at one time…the �rst group in the world to really do that. We beat Amazon, we beat eBay…”


“Ultimately we would have ended up being Amazon but we were in Utah and at the time Utah had no clue what investment was


around the internet. So, we just grew too fast and that was a lesson for me at that time was not to grow too fast.”


In a recent interview with Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenli1/2020/05/18/nikola-motor-company-trevor-milton-


2020/#de8228490f63), Trevor claimed uPillar had 80 million monthly users. Websites at the time describe


(https://www.vroooom.com/vroooom/upillar-com-review-free-classi�eds-website/) uPillar as “only reporting on average around 200k monthly


visits” and as spending big on advertising to get a temporary bump (https://series-books.blogspot.com/2010/06/early-days-of-ebay.html), then


watching its usage subsequently tank.


We spoke with a former employee who called the claim of 80 million monthly users “absurd”. They said of the site:


“Much of our time was spent approving classi�ed postings. We were always able to keep up with it, with only a few of us approving


them.” (Because of the low tra�c).


“Many of the ads were posted by scammers from overseas, so we constantly rooted those out by identifying I.P. addresses.”


“The website failed to deliver a product to rival eBay. Our mass uploader feature was supposed to be able to compete with eBay, and


we were trying to deliver it to customers before eBay raised its listing fees, but we weren’t able to. Many users weren’t able to move


their storefronts from eBay, because our website couldn’t facilitate the mass product info. Users were stuck using eBay.”


The former employee also told us:


“Amazon was not talked about a competitor…eBay and Autotrader were.”


For reference, uPillar launched in 2009 (https://www.upillar.com/about-us). It did not have the �rst shopping cart, and it was not beating Amazon.


The �rst online shopping carts were used in 1994 (https://money.com/online-shopping-history-anniversary/), the same year Amazon was


founded (https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/amazon-cadabra-je�-bezos-25-year-anniversary-1994.html). By then, Google had processed almost


800 billion searches (https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/), and the iPhone had been in existence for 2 years. Amazon had


existed for 15 years and reported (https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-fourth-quarter-


sales-42-95-billion) over $4.6 billion in general eCommerce sales excluding books.

[1] Additional sources [1 (https://www.toyotasantamonica.com/hydrogen-fuel-cost/),2 (https://cafcp.org/content/cost-re�ll)] put the cost of


hydrogen production for vehicles at $16.63/kg and $16.51/kg. Costs are coming down. A 2011 DoE report


(https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/�les/2015/01/f19/11007_h2_threshold_costs.pdf) states that at $4/kg hydrogen would reach parity with fossil

years. That all being said, it hasn’t happened yet, and Nikola appears to have done nothing to advance the process despite its claims to have


already achieved breakthrough levels.

Congratulations on such a detailed expose.


Trevor Milton and Elon Musk are masters of the Green Scam


If it “promises” to be green then nobody will dare speak against it.


People go to jail for small-time fraud.


Start a public company and commit Giga-fraud and you are not even breaking the law.


This stinks.

Elon Musk delivered real vehicles that you can buy today using real in-house technology that they actually created. The cars aren’t going to save


the world, but they are greener overall than comparable internal combustion vehicles.


If Hindenburg’s report is true, Milton acted as a showman and did nothing more than build a skeleton company for the purpose of raising money


and selling out.

Talking about Musk in the same sentence as Trevor says more about you than Musk.


I and many others have smelled a rat (an entire infestation in fact) with Trevor since Nikola �rst gained prominence in the press.


Musk, on the other hand, has delivered over a million EVs to paying customers, and landed rockets repeatedly on their tails. He is a uniquely


talented innovator with lofty, philanthropic goals and impressive, tangible track record toward them.


You are more in Trevor’s source, though presumably lacking his millions in fraudulent gains you are no less of a fraud, through your fraudulent


�lings with the NHTSA which provided you no gain (unless you were paid for your malfeasance?) beyond serving your hatred of Musk’s success.


Like the rest of TSLAQ, who are notable for railing on Tesla for years despite its increasingly obvious and considerable achievements, yet


entertaining and obliging the real fraud, Trevor. Birds of a feather gather together.

Musk is not the fraud Milton is, but he’s a fraud nonetheless.


Show me Musk’s patents. Show me Musk’s publications. (hint: he has one single, crappy software patent from decades ago that was not invented


by himself). He wasn’t a Telsa founder but sued to have himself added as such (he was a Series-A investor). The reason people don’t bother to


land rockets on their tails is because it’s not economical, not because it is di�cult.


Like Milton, Musk is a superb hustler. He’s smarter than Milton, but that’s the only real distinction. Both are riding the greenwashing wave. And


fools like you eat it up.

Musk is delivering on his promises. He doesnâ€™t make his timelines but he has now delivered ï¿½ve diï¿½erent EVs. Granted, the Tesla Roadster is no


longer in production, but the Models S, X, 3, and Y are still in production with the Model 3 the current eï¿½ciency leader of production cars. Tesla


also has two operational class 8 semis that have been in use to reï¿½ne and guide ï¿½nal development.


Nikola has never even had a working prototype of any of his alleged vehicles.

You shouldn’t be mentioning Trevor Milton and Elon Musk in the same sentence. One guy has built reusable capable of sending humans to


space, is deploying thousands of satellite to provide internet to the whole planet and has created an electric vehicle revolution. One man builds


real things that actually work in the real world and the other pretends to be that guy without actually building anything. One backs up what he


says and the other doesn’t. One is building a company that will probably become the most valuable company on the planet within 10 years and


the other is riding on the coattails of the other’s successs to try and scam people.

@Keef Wivane�


Please don’t put Elon Musk in the same category as T. Milton.


I do agree that TESLA market valuation is “doesn’t make sense sky-high”, and that Musk often said things that he couldn’t deliver (Full Automatic


Driving as example). But he is a genious visionary who came up with a lot of really top-notch solutions in markets that are di�cult to crack


(SpaceX is also a great example).


On the other hand, it looks like the “Super-Duper World Beating” tech of Nikola was mostly “Words”.


tradergordo says:


September 10, 2020 at 8:08 am (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37542)


Nikola would have collapsed and disappeared except that they raised so much money due to all the EV hype, now they can actually a�ord to “buy


o�” engineers and components and actually build a legit product with GM’s help. I think GM knew Nikola was a farce, but also knows they have


been able to raise a ton of money and have an insane valuation and that means they can actually become the company they were pretending to


be at some future point just through buying everything – which indeed is precisely what they’ve accomplished with this GM deal. GM as you point


out, can bene�t greatly from this. GM also has a 10% ownership stake in Lordstown Motors which I consider an actual, legitimate company with


fantastic management (they have people from Tesla, Nissan, GM, and more) and an actual working factory (purchased for pennies on the dollar


FROM GM) so GM is just making strategic deals at this point.


Robin Green says:


September 11, 2020 at 8:47 am (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37809)


It takes more than “buying everything” to build a successful EV company. What about the competition? If they are applying their own markup,


how are they going to be competitive in the long term?


Matt says:


September 11, 2020 at 4:10 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37941)


Exactly. Even discounting the huge up front investment, buying “cost plus” EV pickups from GM will give them no bathroom of their own to play


with.
If they were going to be �rst to market perhaps this gambit could have gained then some track record by selling overpriced product for a while…


But if Badger ever gets to market it will be after Tesla, Rivian and probably Ford and others. The GM deal was enough to titillate the stock market


earlier in the week but the proposition has zero lasting shareholder value.


Samthesham says:


September 11, 2020 at 9:40 am (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37822)


is this not so di�erent than Tesla though. Elon in 2012 said “In 2012, “Tesla does not need to ever raise another funding round.” and Tesla has


raised over $23 B since then.


Elon has run businesses for 25 years and never made a dime on any of them and his marketing has led to billions of funding that are now making


his products a reality. I have a hard time seeing how Milton is much di�erent than Musk


Matt says:


September 11, 2020 at 4:19 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37950)


You’re a lunatic. Both Musk and his stakeholders have made piles of cash from the combination of his innovation, work ethic and entrepreneurial


genius. Zip2, PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla…


In a way there’s a kind of similarity, albeit one where Trevor is a dark parody of Musk, fraudulently riding a wave on the stardust of his coat tails.


Whereas Musk has parlayed successive (and parallel) stunning successes into new successes of ever greater scale, out-maneuvering “unbeatable”


established players along the way…


… Trevor has apparently parlayed the proceeds of his lies, frauds and intimidation into ever larger frauds, the the point where he now holds a


bag of hot air “worth” tens of billions.

… Nice rhetoric, saying that Trevor is a “dark parody” of Musk. The two words drove the point home succinctly. Overall, a long, pithy procession of


points that successfully countered anything the troll initially made, while providing the reader (me) with additional info about Musk I hadn’t


known before.

customers enjoying their products are their marketing department. You still think there’s no di�erence between Milton and Musk??

What you said is true. However, Milton’s habit to lie will remain and he will lie even more. If GM is OK working with a liar then there is one more


reason why we should not trust GM…

Hindenburg couldn’t me more di�erent from the TSLAQ “community.”


Hindenburg has spent considerable time and diligent research to develop a position on Nikola which is not an opinion on demand, or a vague


but unsubstantiated allegation of fraud, or catching someone out on their words, but a deep, detailed, evidenced and damning expose of a


premeditated series of calculated lies and falsehoods calculated to build investments around an empty company.

https://theindependentinvestor.com/short-seller-hindenburg-alleges-that-electric-truck-maker-nikola-is-an-intricate-fraud-in-new-report/
Based on that fully researched position they then short the fraud and publish the data.


TSLAQ, on the other hand, seem to update their thesis with the phase of the moon as a vain and deceitful attempt to reverse the massive losses


they have su�ered over years now, based on their ill-considered short positions on a real company delivering real innovation into the hands of


real customers, whilst delivering 50% CAGR and billions in actual revenue – to the consternation and disruption of established players in that


market.


Notably I’m not seeing a Hindenberg expose on Tesla, even though they’ve had years to do so and despite being perfectly aware of TSLAQ – they

Exactly Nathan. Hindenburg did the same thing with Tesla before. They Shorted Tesla while having Investments in Nikola. Now they have


Invested in Tesla and Shorted Nikola. SO CALLED research entities that have investments a�ected by their news should have to prove allegations.


Instead, all they do is tell lies and slap a Disclaimer on it.


Matt says:


September 11, 2020 at 5:12 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37973)


Their disclaimer us at least clear that they may short the company in an expose, or may even choose to invest in it. It’s a hedge fund after all.


They’ve o�ered plenty of evidence but as they say you should do your own due diligence.


Meantime if it’s all untrue Trevor now had the perfect opportunity to put his detractors to shame by producing a fully functioning One prototype,


showing us his breakthrough cells, explaining the mismatch between US Xpress cash position and their billions in orders, etc.


In short, by addressing the questions in this article. Happily his recent tweet seems to suggest he will. Looking forward to it.

Lol, like the thousands of trucks Trevor has lined up at the dealership just waiting to hit the highways, we’ll never see Trevor addressing anything,


let alone Hindenburg’s complaint…


Kun says:


September 11, 2020 at 11:52 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-38023)


Proof that Hindenburg shorted Tesla before? Did they generate such a detailed report as well. When you cannot refute the arguments, you attack


the credibility of the reporter. Are you willing to bet this report is false by buying Nikola stock?


Matt says:


September 11, 2020 at 4:25 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37952)


Apparently it’s a functioning business model, and if the research is honest and the shorting follow that research (rather than the other way


round) as indeed it seems to have in this instance, it seems to be a perfectly honourable one – making money whilst warning others about the


dangers of investing in e.g. Nicola. Fraud, if it is fraud, needs to be surfaced. On this their track record seems impressive, unlike Nikola’s.


Whether you �nd it credible or not, if you check their disclaimer they suggest you go your own due diligence. Dismissing this research out of


hand probably isn’t very diligent but each to their own.

How is that di�erent from being long NKLA and claiming the company is great? Absolutely nothing wrong with being short a stock, disclosing this


fact, and writing about it. Go to Seeking Alpha and look at all the positive pieces that long investors write daily.


Funny you have “credibility issue” with Hindenburg, but no issues with the history of fraud at NKLA?

I must say, this is an excellent rant coming from a malcontent who missed the boat on cheap Nikola stock. Do you seriously think GM took this


company for its word and not vet them before handing them $2 billion of their assets? They have their intellectual property along with their


proprietary technologies… otherwise the deal would have never gone down.


JS says:


September 11, 2020 at 9:34 am (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37820)


GM didn’t “hand them” 2 B of assets. NKLA handed GM “2 B” of NKLA equity and promise to buy GM’s Fuel cells. No lose situation for GM. NKLA


did it for the “halo reputation” e�ect.


Bill says:

You are so right! GM has been a leader in this type of tech and would never make a poor decision (Wrong). Listen to that clown (Trevor) I can’t


believe ANYONE would fall for his shtick. I have heard better and more inspirational leaders at my doorstep selling magazines. I would sell ALL


my stock in GM if I had any, because this deal is so “Theranos”. Go ahead and �ame me, but remember when this company goes down in H2


�ames, you were warned.


JS says:


September 11, 2020 at 4:39 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37961)


I’m not advocating GM is right. I’m simply pointing out above post implies GM put 2 BUSD cash into this. Which they did not. It is a No Lose


situation for GM. This does not mean it will work.


Digibean says:

Though If it does work GM has a lot to gain, especially in proving they can be a major player in the EV industry. They seem to be trying to keep a


low pro�le, trying to distance themselves from Nikola.

Someone says:

Woody, You have the story backwards. Nikola gave GM ~$2 billion of stock. GM is oï¿½ering to produce Nikolaâ€™s vehicles, likely at cost plus a


margin. GM didnâ€™t hand Nikola $2 billion of assets.

Go back and look at page 32 & 35 of their investor deck on �nancials and valuation. The valuation discounts enterprise value yet never explains


how they fund the $1.7bn capex. Never accounts for net debt of future share sales. The analysts all seem to have fallen for the con�ation of


enterprise value with equity value. Lot on big name bankers involved here in this.

Extremely in depth and insightful report. Kudos for this high level investigation.


Sadly, I think any company with enough capital will have a chance of making “something” therefore stringing investors along for years until cash


runs out. Or faced with desperation and pride, GM might just eat the bullet and deliver a real product for Nikola, furthering the lie.


Never the less, it’s nice to bust out the popcorn and watch the sequel to Theranos.

social media to reduce attention spans to seconds. I believe a number of these are out there. Perhaps this is the most blatant. My favorite is in


their investor pitch book they show the economics of the leased hydrogen vehicle and the “obvious” 30% margin to NKLA. Like their customers


wouldn’t look at that and say, no I want a price reduction????WTF tell a lie loud enough and often enough and people will believe it. Kudos to you.

What I read is Hindenburg has a vested interest in Telsa and or Telsa stock and will do anything to hurt what Hindenburg views as its most


serious competition Nikola. What a hit job.

The point being, this isn’t a hit job.


NKLA has no product, no IP, and has mislead about the capabilities and prototypes.


This was all known. This report gave it documentation and details. And then more context about Trevor’s previous companies and lies.

Exactly. Hindenburg changed position. They spoke bad of Tesla while shorting the stock. Then they bought low and shorted Nikola. This should


be Illegal. Look at the Disclaimer. It basically says that this is all opinion only and the opinions and positions are subject to change.


Johnny Cache says:


September 11, 2020 at 4:19 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37949)


Why should it be illegal? Short sellers are the only balance to SPAC-type frauds and protect investors. Sorry you were duped, better luck next


time.


Matt says:


September 11, 2020 at 7:44 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37989)


The notion that Tesla is threatened by Nikola is laughable.


Tesla will ship 500k vehicles this year across 4 models and 3 factories, with more models and factories coming online next year. Their Semi and


Cybertruck will reach the market before Nokia even plans to deliver their Semi or Badger.


Meantime Nikola has delivered precisely nothing to market and only one moving truck, despite partnerships with the likes of Bosch, Iveco at al.


Come on, open your eyes, enough of the Hindenberg stu� is easily checked.

How easy would it be to debunk the article by hopping in the truck and driving it down the Las Vegas strip for the world to see? It’s not easy


because the strip is �at.

I purchased a single 2022 call option yesterday after the sello� on light volume (assumed to be pro�t taking following the GM bump on Tuesday),


and closed the position for a loss this morning. I recouped part of my loss, however, in the form of entertainment value from reading this report.


Astounding, and seemingly well documented.
If only half of it proves true, you should sell the movie rights.

I think the facts are in the details – the 8-K announcing the agreement with GM clearly shows that GM will provide most of the engineering and


technology (except interior design, per say). With that said, this lets Nikola refocus on branding, marketing, infotainment and design. It is quite an


asset-light model.


Though it must be said, Tesla doesn’t quite have proprietary technology, as it relies extensively on Panasonic to make batteries. The battery


management software is not unique as shown by the real world tests of the Porsche.


There’s a lot of deceit in both Nikola and Tesla. Treat carefully in both names.


Matt says:


September 11, 2020 at 7:47 pm (https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/#comment-37991)


If you think Tesla doesn’t have proprietary technology you don’t understand technology as well as you think you do, and probably need to watch


some videos by Sandy Munro.

Finally someone exposing the truth about Nikola. Took 17 months to do groundbreaking on their Coolidge, AZ location. And one month later and


they only have 1 truck on site (compared to over 70 at Tesla’s TX location). Trevor Milton is a con artist on the levels of Elizabeth Holmes and


Bernie Maydo�. I’ve shorted NKLA right after the GM announcement because it was the last con�rmation I needed that they cannot provide their


own battery technology.

Thanks for the thorough write-up. One item I couldn’t reconcile: did Worthington invest in Milton twice? You outline their investment in dHybrid


Systems towards the beginning. In the intro, you also list them among key investors who have been cashing out. If this is the case, presumably,


Worthington understood with whom they were getting involved. Do you have any insight into why they would invest with someone like this twice


if the dHybrid Systems deal was as bad as you describe?

I have no special knowledge here but suspect their “investment” may have been part of their settlement with Trev. I.e. Equity in lieu of taking him


to the cleaners. Could be wrong but it makes more sense to me than investing in him a second time.

Thank you for such an in depth dive into Nikola and Trevor Milton, and for exposing him for a fraud. It’s sad to think about how many people he

Every word I have ever heard Trevor Milton say, always sounded like a snake oil salesman. I told anyone that would listen that this guy would go


down as the biggest fraud in US history but no one listened and they pushed this stock up to $70. I sold calls against his company but people still


pushed the stock up. Thank you for �nally ousting this con artist with your detailed investigative work. I say throw everything you have at


shorting this company. They are no Tesla!

Great work! Literally the �rst time I saw Trevor Milton in an interview and listened to him speak, I knew he was a liar and a con artist. I’m amazed


that he was able to draw in some of the quality people from the investment community that he did, a couple of which I’ve known for years, and


whom I know to be insightful, e�ective, ethical, and highly intelligent.

Very thorough investigation and solid journalism. It seems the emperor may not have any clothes on and the investors will be left holding the


bag. Perhaps with the involvement of some of these large companies, a product can be conjured, bit it seems at the moment, short is a great


place to be.

expertise he had in this space. I steered clear of this.


You guys are really thorough with your report. I wonder what Mary Barra must be feeling after reading this report? I hope they have the audacity

Stand by for a repeat with the Lordstown Motors / DiamondPeak SPAC (ticker “RIDE”) coming soon to an exchange near you. Steve Burns isn’t

impressive. I’ve been able to smell T.M.’s BS on Twitter, but you really lay it all out, with sources. Thank you for taking the time to assemble all this


information into one comprehensive source. I look forward to seeing a legal team asking T.M. these questions under oath someday soon.

I’ve been trying to apply to Nikola the past few weeks. I thought it was really weird how they had their available jobs set up. It’s basically been the


same jobs for a long time. I know some companies keep up job reqs up for a long time, but I thought it very suspicious. Every job I applied to the


next day they would send an email and state they reviewed and I’m not a good �t. It was just way too quick. A company that is supposedly doing


what they are supposed to be should have a real HR system, it didn’t seem to exist. They just asked you to attach your resume on the application


submission. No job pro�le or forms to �ll out.

Well done guys. My dad asked me what I thought of Nikola after the huge Tesla run, I had told him from the little research I had done that I felt it


was a scam, noting that their only income last quarter was from solar panel installation on the CEOs house, and that my gut and lack of tangible


evidence told me they don’t have any intention or ability to actually produce a product. I had felt foolish for a minute when the stock soared, am


happy to see someone expose these guys. I think I speak for the vast community of retail investors when I say thank you for your dedication to


�nding the truth and keeping some of us (you can’t �x stupid) from FOMO and then getting �eeced. I have my own opinions about the valuation


of Tesla too (I’ve never been able to �nd the value with that company, at least relative to the big 3), but that’s another topic for another day. Keep


up the good work.

In most cases, the legacy will crush the exception. You are on the side of the legacy and the market is on the side of the exception-Tesla. Tesla


has 3 challenges: 1) pricing to low or mid 40k drive out with autonomous driving 2) range- get the range to 450-500 miles before charging 3)


regulatory – which and where and how any government allow fully autonomous driving without a driver. The market believes Tesla will conquer


those challenges. The internal combustion engine will be like a typewriter after the application of Windows 95.

Thanks for publishing this information. I have read the SEC documents and noticed how corrupt TM is, including the stock that was given to the


CEO. You should look at that deal, I think that the WOR execs are complicit in NKLA SPAC and need to go to jail.


Also, there are posts on Reddit that support your views. There is no mention of the suicide of one of TM’s “friends” who had attempted to


blackmail TM.


Usually there is an interesting backstory to something like a suicide of a blackmailer.

Your report is outstanding.


Thank you for exposing this fraud company to uninformed investors.


We sell and distribute welding equipment to EV industry. In the past wE sold welding systems to Elizabeth Holmes @ Theranos before they


collapsed. We know that Nikola is on par with Theranos and Enron.

This whole thing is a fraudulent, including but not limited to Nasdaq and the Wall Street who allowed this company to go public to steal investors


money. They should �x this, punish this mastermind con artist and return Investor’s money.

Congratulations. It is a great research and proves all my suspicions of Nikola from the start. If I would be in USA and I would short them with all


the money I have…


I have nothing to do with Nikola but as an engineer I know very well if it sounds too good to be true it should be fake. I really do not understand


how that blind could the people who invest in this fraud company be?


I hope you make Millions/Billions of Dollars on your short bet…

This has been among the most sickening corporate write-ups in a while. The plies of lies just kept adding up with little or no consequence. And


your statement ” this is a re�ection of the times” makes one wander not who else but how many else.


Finally, the fact that people (investors) wanted to be fooled or rather believe in an illusion is deeply concerning.


I hope your publication has the desired catalyst e�ect other I won’t be surprised if he pulls another “pusher” for the stage.

It’s quite delectable to see such a con�dent & intelligent �nancial mind so desperate to tear-down a company he bet wrong on (short-selling)


because Trevor Milton had a hidden deal with GM to ruin all your own greedy plans to rub easy-earned money in your non-working white collar


�sts betting against an American company making American jobs for American people in the middle of the biggest economic downturn in


modern history.


Your rich boy’s plans are now in a panty twist, and you put your precious mama’s boy mind to work trying to save your own skin – and pass it o�


as noble crusaderism for all the poor stockholders out there getting screwed. Except they weren’t getting screwed until you wrote this self-


serving article to drive the stock price down for your own �nancial gain – and succeeded.


Market manipulation, anyone?


That’s the only crime I see here.


Real corporate development – which is something a pansy like you would know nothing about – is fraught with complexity, failure, and missed


timelines.


The Tesla you can’t help but pay homage to was brought before the SEC for claims of a $420 stock price to go private (assumed if not proven to


be a lie by Elon) before being worth over $2,000/share the following year.


Yeah.


So what the hell do you or does anyone know about the future or the truth of complex scienti�c hardware startups? A whole lot of nothing.


And starting a sea of lawsuits to enrich class action lawyers who pay clients nothing and destroy American companies, again? Nice job, scumbag.


Accusing or proving Milton of lies when the richest & most successful startup CEOs did & do the same all the time – so what?


Elon Musk is a saint who I think is awesome – yet he is also a proven liar again & again on substantive corporate information. I don’t like that he is


a liar – but he is. So was Steve Jobs. Gee, what a failure those companies & their CEOs turned-out to be, huh?


Maybe they have to lie to counteract anti-American hitjobbers like you?


And you sarcastically insinuate a Milton brother is a village idiot because he was in construction?


Some of the smartest people in the world are builders – not do-nothing money speculators like your trashiness who lack the soul to create


anything. The chronometer that enabled reliable global seafaring (to stick to the historic transportation innovation topic) was created by a “village


idiot” who built wooden clocks when Sir Isaac Newton & his lofty science academy failed in their astronomical alternatives and could never


replicate Harrison’s work – even sabotaged it & refused his monetary payment (award money), making him build it again before they �nally paid


him as he was DYING for what achieved that they all FAILED at – a true genius far beyond them – despite being just a craftsman. Read Dava


Sobel’s “Discoverer of the Longitude.”


He, too, would’ve made the dunce page on your website.

So, I doubt your elitist, self-serving, �nancially vested attack will fool anyone for long.


Nikola signed with GM & beat you at your own game.


You lose, Hindenberg.


Whoever you & your cronies are…hiding behind that a�ected corporate name while feeling free to post photos & dossiers on other people’s


families for sport, personal pro�t, and simple vengeance…all symptoms of SORE LOSERS.


At least Elon’s shorters had the balls to PAY for their failures and let the short squeeze play out. Clearly, you don’t.


Get deeper pockets, be real men, and maybe you won’t have to work your brains so hard whining to everyone in full detail about how Nikola and


the Miltons WON – while you LOST.


Full disclosure: I don’t know jack about the Miltons & Nikola and have no relation to either (nor am I Mormon or from Utah, for what it’s worth) –


other than reading the news the past couple months – and like most mom & pop Americans whom your bullshit is harming, I have less than $10K


in Nikola. But, thank God, a far higher IQ than you will ever have. And that IQ is interested in protecting the millions you just harmed crashing


Nikola stock to protect yourself, while calling it whistleblowing & truth-seeking to protect consumers. Yeah right. I see no truth here. Only


personal perspective, shameless & sarcastic ad hominem attacks, vested bias, sel�sh motive, and – to use your weasel words – possibly illegal


stock price manipulation, as a presumably massive multi-million dollar short seller of Nikola. Maybe the SEC needs to pay YOU a visit – not


Nikola.

Not exactly a legally persuasive argument, counselor. Instead of hu�ng and pu�ng, please take few minutes when you calm down to re-examine


the evidence which is clearly and concisely documented, unlike the replies by yourself and the like-minded ilk who are either ignorant, or suspect


they have been taken for a downhill ride.


Initially, I rooted for Nikola’s technology and innovation, then I did some research. It did not take long to conclude that many things did not add


up, thus I remain perplexed that it took this long for Milton’s deception to surface. His latest replies, or lack thereof, speak volumes about the


“openness, integrity, and truthfulness” to which he so adamantly paid lip service in his previous posts.


Your own words serve as a compelling testament to your own integrity and acknowledgment of the wrong-doing:

Amazing work. Due diligence and the sheer amount of work you guys did is astonishing. While I never got on a hype train that surrounded Nikola


(as I am skeptical of every “absolutely revolutionary” piece of tech), I thought their might be something to the story. Despite your short position,


based on the evidence you presented, I am now convinced that this whole thing is just another Wirecard or Theranos story. Great work, guys.

What a great and detailed report. I love how people are still trying to protect Nikola


It is only �tting that this group screws them over


The Hindenburg disaster occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, United States. It seems clear that the Hindenburg


disaster was caused by an electrostatic discharge (i.e., a spark) that ignited leaking hydrogen.

I though I was going to see something good in this report, the only fraud I see here is Hindenburg Research.

So, following hours of careful consideration of how to respond to these very serious and well documented allegations, we are presented with the


“I’m rubber and you’re glue” defense.


Of course, that rubber is a game changing substance developed in-house, that will revolutionize the rubber industry.


I’m so very tired of life in the “post-truth” age.

exactly like donald trump?


There are so many con men and women out there…and people are still buying the stock of a fake company…just wow.

Everything reported looks very real…lots of evidence…serious report that is right now damaging Nikolas integrity. very serious. Could Hindenburg


go through the time , money , e�ort to do this just to short this stock? There are much easier ways for them to make money and they have the


capability…It all looks very , very true…videos, reports ( sec and others)…However, lets give Milton the bene�t of the doubt….Damm, I cant believe


it if this will turn out another Mado� deal…Damm.

any chance of getting my money back. It dropped so fast that I lost over 3000 and I’m not real happy about it. GM should be ashamed to be part


of this and I think anyone that lost money over a sham should get their back. I’m open to suggestions. If you guys think I should just forget about


it I will and call it a lesson learned

No chance of getting your money back Je�. Class-action suits are already being prepared. You’ll receive invitations to join those. If you are lucky,


you’ll get back a few bucks (literally) and that’s it.


No need for shame. Happens to everyone early in their investing careers, and disturbingly on occasion thereafter as well. Lessons to be learned. I


have been actively investing for 40 years. I feel a bit of shame, and plenty of humility. This one only recently came on my radar, and I made the


mistake of jumping in before su�cient research, based on GM’s move. They were taken in like you and me. More than a few resumes are being


updated in GM corporate o�ces today.

This is a ‘hit’ job. The stock dropped, so short-sellers won (short-term). Meanwhile, California has new laws (for trucks) coming and PLEVs aren’t


the solution. Hydrogen (green!) is the solution.


Personal vehicles are used less than 1 hour a day.


Last-Mile delivery trucks & Long-Haul trucks are used 8-18 hours a day. Guess what? Batteries still take took long to charge, and no business will


pay someone $15/hr to sit and wait 1-3-8 hours for batteries to charge. Hydrogen might take 10-30 minutes.


Most of this ‘ hit’ info is 8-10 year-old lawsuits from old companies, former co-workers, etc. Who cares? Go to any ‘auto show’ and you’ll see demo

If this is all you could gather, it’s not enough. Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, California… all all investing more than USD 30 Billion in


Hydrogen. It’s coming. I just bought NKLA stock!

has a large pit to dig out of to prove you are wrong. There is just too much documentation and phony story lines that would have a hard time to

Kudos to research!


It’s almost the same story like Rimac automobili, except Rimac story is even worse, they started with the money which Ivan Rimac stole, and they


wore involved in money laundering with Franck Christian Kanayet Yepes in Panama Papers scandal… Rimac is closely connected to Croatian


politicians and goverment, but Croatia is one of the most corrupted countries in the world, so no one talks about this, this is one big taboo…

Where there’s smoke, there’s �re! You’ve identi�ed enough past history to identify major issues with claims of future performance. Why isn’t the


FBI and SEC investigating this? I’d suggest having your investigators meet with the U.S. Attorney in the State where they are headquartered and


then following up with the aforementioned agencies. If these allegations are true, Trevor should be in jail.

NIKOLA – at least someone in this world is doing due diligence – NIKOLA despite of all the hype did not register with NHTSA till 7/21/2020 and as


of now no EPA, CARB accounts and no MFG license with any DMV in any State and only has WMI as low volume manufacturer (less than 500


vehicles annually) which while issued by SAE back in November 10, 2019 is still not in NHTSA database 1N9 (393) – just like LUCID a lot of HOT AIR

“Meantime if it’s all untrue Trevor now had the perfect opportunity to put his detractors to shame by producing a fully functioning One


prototype, showing us his breakthrough cells, explaining the mismatch between US Xpress cash position and their billions in orders, etc.


In short, by addressing the questions in this article. Happily his recent tweet seems to suggest he will. Looking forward to it.”


I would go further. If I had been wrongly accused, particularly on such serious matters and with that level of documentation, what would I have


done immediately? After reciting, and possibly expanding, my repertoire of curse words, I would have posted videos of that truck powering up,


accelerating, making turns, and doing all manner of things prior to making that long straight run. Surely these would exist. Why would they not if


I were making a promotional video with a professional crew. Plus, of course, everyone has a high res video camera in his or her pocket.


Same basically applies to the stage cable. There surely would be amateur or professional video of the staging for such an important event. Or


perhaps trot out the tech who ran the cable, to state that it was for camera lighting or whatever. Maybe cite his brother’s friends or past business


associates who swear he is tech whizz savant whose day job was pouring driveways?


No material to refute the allegation? None that could be produced in the 18 hours that lapsed before issuance of a vague, vindictive reply on


f$%*king twitter? I doubt he’ll have to forward info to the SEC. I feel sure they will be happy to come and pick it up.


Bottom line is if he was wrongly accused, there should have been rapid and convincing responses to at least some of the allegations, and it


would have been in Trevor’s interests to get those out there asap to mitigate the massive business and reputational damage. No bene�t


whatsoever in saving it for a legal action that might clear your name years down the road. The fact that no exculpatory evidence at all was


o�ered strikes me as very telling. Maybe I’m wrong, but it sure smells to me.

Just a few questions


1 . Do you think that someone who is involved in shorting stocks in a big scale, any stocks not only NKLA Should not be allowed it to relist any


reports about that company. Is that not con�ict of interest ? stock manipulations ? Should this not be see as a criminal act ?


2.How timely that you decide to publish this report just as the deal goes through with GM


Obviously you were holding this information to publish at your advantage point


3.Is it fair to assume you were loosing a lot of money with the announcement of the GM deal ?


4. Do you think exposing other people’s personal lives, previous jobs or relations from 5 or 10 years ago has anything to do with the company


management now ?


5.As a shorter is de�nitely a con�ict and not your place to investigate or expose any wrong doings

This was an incredible read – thoroughly enjoyed it, and certainly agree with the conclusions you have drawn.


One thing that I found may have been missing however, is the macro point. Looking into the e�cacy of hydrogen power as a whole. The entire


technology is at best an ‘experiment’ and at worst, a complete sham.


It releases more CO2 than combustion engines, it is signi�cantly more expensive to run than electric engine, and considering we have limitless


electricity in our wall sockets, why go to the e�ort of having a mini power station in the truck. Many critics have gone as far as to say it will never


be a logical solution

Hindeburg: Impressive article based on months of research.


Nikola’s paid trolls and fanboys: Piss o� u haters.


Seriously though, I was planning to invest on NKLA a couple of months ago. Luckily it took me only 15 minutes of research to see through their


b.s.


I bought DPHC (Lordstown) instead.

Its very interesting to see this drama actually played out, rather than a news story after the (alleged) fraud has resulted in a 6am bust or a


suicide. Thanks to youtubers who brought my attention this fascinating and in parts highly amusing Hindenburg report. Last year my �rst stock


investment was Tesla (long) and I have just worked out what a short is. Am I wicked enough to short Nikola? I certainly feel like it.

How can anyone read this report and not see direct transitive resemblance to the likes of Je�rey Skilling, Ken Lay, and Andy Fastow?


Bizarre how so dutifully it mirrors Bernard Ebbers, even with that company having ACTUAL product.


Or Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh Balwani at the helm?


Or like the Cardi� Giant, duping the masses when so many were so desperate at that time for new �ndings in the �eld of archeology and


evidence of Darwinism? This “I want to believe” vulnerability of the current green bowel-movement is just the kind of perfect storm spinning the


atmospheric proxy for which scoundrels can manifest their vehicles – that latter pun wholly intended.


I �nd it odd now that anyone really paying attention this past year to the Nikola nonsense, STILL �nds the gumption to gu�aw, followed by


mustering exasperation and fury for Hindenburg having pulled back the drapes on the Wizard of Oz himself. I have to wonder if they are mad


about that alone, or really just mad at themselves for being such sycophants to the rising stock they they willing played along in a lie of the mind.


( Be true to yourself, admit it – you got fooled. )


Has nobody been paying attention that all this hocus-pocus imbues the sensibility that Milton is nothing more than the chief engineer and “Tre-


ring” circus ringmaster of a mark-to-market charade propped up on little more than H.G. Wells and Jules Vern style machinations that even a 12-


year old can pull o�, with little more than fervent imagination and a grand set of Hot Wheels cars?


Oh, but Trevor’s got “spikes” don’t he?


Nikola is like the cheap side-show ruse at the traveling carnival, that capitalizes on a recent Science Fair that established revolutionary change


(Tesla) that also comes to town in a whirlwind, fools most of the people MOST of the time, then either leaves town just as fast with the cash


duped from the suckers still catching their breath while gaped-mouthed at what they saw, or gets caught by the Sheri� red-handed.


And Sheri� Hindenburg just arrived.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Go read the SEC �lings. This has been a GM scam for quite a while now. If NKLA makes it to year-end, the lock-


up period ends and the market gets �ooded with shares.

Nice ploy to release this report and the be short the stock. Either this will make you millions or send you to jail. I hope the latter happens …..

Can’t wait for Trevor to get convicted and sent to the big house. He can spin his tall tales there while he’s getting pounded from behind.

Nice work guys! Especially regarding Nikola’s hydrogen production cost which is key to Milton’s whole business model.


My views are primarily based on your work and Milton’s interview/discussion of his hydrogen production plans in the TC’s Charts Podcast that


you linked to where Milton goes ‘in depth’ on how he’ll reduce cost of hydorgen…


https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-trevor-milton?play=true (https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/758369/4605602-episode-35-


trevor-milton?play=true)


Challenge Trevor Milton on the following………..


As you point out, Milton’s argument is that the most important element of Nikola reducing hydrogen production cost was ‘standardizing’ the


design to reduce build cost by 50% or so. But the cost of building the production facility is a one time cost amortized over the life of the plant (20-


30 years). It’s a minor part of actual day-to-day hydrogen production cost.


WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION is the daily cash OPERATING COST, i.e. cost of materials, labor,energy, etc on a day-to-


day basis to produce each Kg of hydrogen. Milton acknowledges that technology improvements have only contributed approx 10% to reduced


hydrogen production cost. WHERE IS THE REST COMING FROM? From reduced cost of building the plant? The math doesn’t work. You need to


force Nikola/Milton to show you ‘cash cost’ of each Kg of hydrogen produced. Amortized cost of building the production plant is a small part of


hydrogen production cost.


Milton also suggests he’ll buy electricity at at two cents per Kwhr because he’ll buy directly from electrical producers via connection to


transmission lines at strategic locations which are limited and Nikola is snapping up every day. Essentially Nikola is bypassing the middle man


(local utility).


Riddle me this Batman, How is Nikola going to reduce voltage from typical 110kV transmission voltage WITHOUT BUILDING ELECTRICAL


SUBSTATIONS to reduce voltage to a usable level???? Voltage reducing substations are required,(that’s what local utilities do, that’s why their


electricity price is higher) Now you have to pay to build a substation. Oops, there goes the reduced capital cost argument!


Buying electricity at low demand times is another keys to Milton’s $3/kg hydrogen cost.


Milton suggests that electric producers will literally pay him to TAKE POWER DURING LOW DEMAND periods. Unless the grid transforms from


current fossil fuel being primary base source, THIS IS A FARCE. Producers can easily throttle back production from fossil, hydro, nuke, etc…

production during low demand. They can let the transient uncontrollable wind/solar produce electricity during low demand. Natural gas turbines


can easily be throttled or brought o� line in low demand times, as can nuke or hydro. Suggesting electric producers will pay Nikola to take power


(or sell for next to nothing) because they have nowhere else to get rid of it is a joke.


A third and �nal �aw in Milton’s $3/kg hydrogen argument is that he’ll buy electricity and produce the hydrogen only when he can buy cheap


power (during o� demand periods). So what is he going to do, let the hydrogen production facilities set idle for 50% or more of the day?????? Or


is he going to build a production facility with twice the capacity and run it half of the time to get the level of hydrogen production required????


Oops again, there goes his argument of using reduced capital/build cost to cut the price of hydrogen.


Don’t back o� guys…………….

You people are that Fn stupid on this report Maybe you should have read the damn legal disclaimer – It shows Hindenburg Research has short


shares of NKLA and that in a nut shell they will have a �nancial gain if the stock goes south. You people really need to understand what a short


sellers goal is? To pump and dump stocks that is all this Hidnenburg Research and Citron Research does they short the hell out of a stock and


then they put false reports out so they can make a huge gain, pay back the short shares they bought and keep the pro�t.


Citrons Andrew Left got convicted in Hong Kong on this same type or scam.

How do you qualify Tesla as a scam? I’ve owned a Tesla for 9 months and it’s the best damn car I have ever driven. Tesla might be overvalued, but


it is certainly not a scam.

For some reason the haters never give a reason, perhaps they hope that if they throw enough shit some of it will stick. This makes them worse


than Trevor in my opinion – at least he lies to build value rather than destroy it. Who knows perhaps he will manage to parlay this ridiculous


valuation into actually delivering something?


The big question is why the haters like to spend their time in this way rather than do something constructive with their lives.

The Class 8 truck market isn’t ready for EV, Hydrogen,or Natural Gas.


All have been a bust


Diesel will rule for another twenty years.

Hydrogen seems nuts to me, natural gas perhaps might be made workable but why are you ruling out EVs?


I am an engineer – what numbers am I missing?

Tesla’s weigh 4,000 to 5,500 lbs. Current Class 7-8 trucks already weigh 26,000 lbs or more. How much more will they weigh if you add enough


batteries to enable such a large vehicle to operate for 8-18 hours a day? 15,000 to 30,000 lbs? At 40,000+ lbs, they’ll damage roads, and/or not be


able to carry full loads. Take a look at H2 stations already operating in California (with dozens more planned along I-5, I-80, etc.) and CA’s new


CARB rules (2024 to 2035 and beyond). Yes, you could use EV Class 8s near the docks in Long Beach and Oakland, but where do those shipping


containers go? On long-haul roads. H2 is already in use (buses, delivery trucks…) in Japan, South Korea, etc., and France, the UK, Germany… have


just joined-in. Hydrogen (if produced with hydro, solar or wind) makes sense… which is why NKLA stock will go up. (It may take 2-3 years, as


deliveries of the Class 8s [not the pick-up] start.)

Yes, Diesel will rule (for vehicles already on the road) for another decade or two.


NKLA is about the FUTURE SALE of Class 8 trucks and other vehicles… just like PLUG is about the sale of H2 forklifts, etc.


Why is Hydrogen already a bust? There are no H2 stations on highways in 45 states. It has not started yet.


California is �rst and already has 35+ H2 stations in operation.


CA did an end-run around the EPA with new MPG and emissions rules for cars and SUVs, and CA’s CARB just did the same thing (2020) on trucks.


CA will start to prohibit the sale of diesel, and trucks trying to enter from Mexico, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona…


This short-seller failed. NKLA and others are the future.

As alluded to above, DOJ and the SEC need to look into the connection between Steve Girsky and Trevor/Nikola. The GM deal is too good to be

one at that).

It came to my attention from fellow software engineers this, that could be added to your case against Nikola:

The quote of interest:


“The entire infotainment system is a HTML 5 super computer,” Milton said. “That’s the standard language for computer programmers around the


world, so using it let’s us build our own chips. And HTML 5 is very secure. Every component is linked on the data network, all speaking the same


language. It’s not a bunch of separate systems that somehow still manage to communicate.”


“Inaccuracies” (BS, really):


* There is no such thing as HTML5 super computer, unless you want to use a super computer to open a page in a web browser


* HTML5 is not even a programming language, but a markup language that describes how to format and distribute the content on screen and


indicate what resources to load


* Even less… it allows you to design a chip. This requires hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog or System Verilog. Not even a


popular programming language such as C++ or Python would allow you to do this; it’s a di�erent role, expertise, and problem-solving approach.

I read every one of your posts. I am curious what your eventual goals are. Shorting, ruining Nikola, bankrupting Nikola, shunning Trevor or trying


to shame the company into success.


I have well healed investors who want to invest now, if Nikola can become a Phoenix corporation.


Rising from thr dead.


Tesla has never made a legitimate pro�t outside of rebates.


Hard to put the electric car industry into a coherent algorithm.


Ford is making cars all over the world. Now in Canada. Hydrogen is coming soon.


Don’t look a gift horse in the rear. Love to talk to you and your sta� now.

I am long on Tesla (since 2013) and I was always quite skeptical of Nikola from the moment they were announced. The copy-cat name just


screamed fraud to me. Nikola never should have gotten as far as it did and far more scrutiny should have been done with their technology. Their


ever-changing story should have created a lot more skepticism. I hope Trevor Milton and the rest of the executives who have committed this


fraud end up in jail. I feel sorry for anyone who got snookered into investing in them. I hope that this does not dampen our need for electric


transportation.


I suppose this will also make Tesla’s claim that Nikola didn’t design their truck much stronger.

lol, any loser will post anything online if they think other losers will read it.


Apparently you have found a group of the biggest clueless losers.


That being said, elon is a scammer.


Trevor not so much.


You can be sure all the big money investing in Nikola and similar tech are a lot smarter than clueless bozos like you and the others on here.


Try getting real jobs lol.


Oh wait, nobody would hire you.

How is Trevor not a scammer? Did you even read the article? This guy has a literal past of scamming. Who are you, a Nikola employee? Probably


one of those idiotic fanboys.
