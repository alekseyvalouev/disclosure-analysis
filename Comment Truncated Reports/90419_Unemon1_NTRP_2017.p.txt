YOU HAVE NOW BEEN WARNED!


I have provided this information to the SEC via the whistleblower program.


It is my firm conviction that shares of Neurotrope are going to zero and that an
investigation will follow.


READ THE FULL 14 PAGES RESEARCH NOTES: HERE


Executive Summary:


Neurotrope was created in a reverse merger in August 2013 by Adam Gottbetter
and Michael Silverman. The Neurotrope promotion was delayed when Gottbetter
was sent to prison for stock fraud in early 2015.


Gottbetter was released from prison in November 2016. Exactly ONE DAY LATER,
NTRP raised approx. $25 million in a stock sale, run by Gottbetter's former partner

Michael Silverman. NTRP price and volume took off ( nearly tripled in the following
100 days). The stock is now collapsing.


Gottbetter's former partner, Michael Silverman, was barred by FINRA after forging
customer signatures ( link). He was also arrested and indicted as part of an illegal
gambling ring run by the Luchese mafia crime family ( link).


NTRP's "drug" (bryostatin) has been evaluated for more than 48 years against
AIDS, cancer and now Alzheimer's. Simply put: it always failed. Documents show
that Blanchette Rockefeller Institute actually filed for bankruptcy on July 28, 2016 (
Link 1). BRNI was running the research on Bryostatin.


Just weeks after the BRNI bankruptcy filing, hedge fund manager Joshua
Silverman supposedly left his fund Iroquois Capital to become Chairman of
Neurotrope. Joshua Silverman and Iroquois are currently under SEC investigation
for their role in an imploded stock promotion called MGT Capital which appears to
be very similar to the Neurotrope promotion. Although Silverman says he left
Iroquois, suddenly Neurotrope began using the same address as Iroquois.


Various parties involved in Neurotrope are using multiple arrangements to drain
much of the cash from Neurotrope IMMEDIATELY after capital raises. They are
making millions of dollars without any need for any successful drug - EVER.


Stock promoters behind Neurotrope are using alternate identities, but trace back to
a New York IR firm called JV Public Relations NY which is linked to Neurotrope.
Janet Vasquez, who runs JV Public Relations, was formerly the PR rep for
Forcefield Energy (SunSi Energy), which was delisted due to fraud as its Chairman
was arrested.


Below I will show that Sharon Di Stefano has written more than a dozen articles
using the name "Small Cap Forecasting" or "SCF". But the phone number tied to
SCF articles distributed though ACCESSWIRE actually belongs to JV Public
Relations At least 10 (out of 15) of the companies covered by Di Stefano also
happen to be tied to JV Public relations. All 10 of those stocks are also featured on
an additional biotech stock promotion site which does not disclose compensation.
THIS INCLUDES NEUROTROPE. INCIDENTALLY, IT ALSO INCLUDES
TAPIMMUNE (TPIV).
