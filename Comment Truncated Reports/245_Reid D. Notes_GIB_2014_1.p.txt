CGI Group: Cookie Jar Accounting And The Logica Acquisition (Part
1)
Top Idea | Jan. 15, 2014 3:00 PM ET6 comments
by: Reid D. Notes


Please read our disclosure at the end of this entry. All figures in CAD unless noted
otherwise.


This is the first in a series of entries on CGI Group, Inc. (NYSE:GIB) in which we will
explore CGI's financial disclosures, prospects for growth, and valuation. We are short
CGI's stock.


In this entry, we introduce CGI's Logica acquisition and explain a set of accounting
techniques that the SEC has referred to as "cookie jar" accounting.


We also suggest investors read a recent article about CGI's accounting written by Bethany
McLean and published by Vanity Fair. In the article, McLean compares CGI's accounting
with techniques that were used at Tyco International Ltd. before Tyco was investigated by
the SEC. McLean is a respected financial journalist who became well-known for her
reporting on accounting issues at Enron.


CGI and the Logica acquisition


CGI ("CGI" or the Company) is, by market cap, the largest publicly-traded technology
company listed in Canada. The Company is an IT and business process services provider
that has become famous for its involvement as the lead contractor for the healthcare.gov
website. (The Washington Post reported last week that the Obama administration decided
to replace CGI because the Company "had not been effective enough in fixing… the
federal website.")


Since its founding in 1976, CGI has acquired over 70 companies, including the consulting
business of Bell Canada in 1998, AMS in 2004, and Stanley Inc. in 2010. In August of
2012, CGI paid a 60% premium for Logica PLC's common shares, valuing Logica's
enterprise at roughly $3.6 billion. Logica had not earned its cost of capital for years prior to
the takeover.


The Logica acquisition was a milestone for CGI. We estimate that over 90% of CGI's
European revenues come from operations that were part of Logica before the acquisition,
and the Company's revenues have more than doubled since the acquisition.

The market has reacted positively to the Logica deal. The enterprise value of CGI has
risen over 50% following the close of the acquisition to nearly $15 billion. Bullish sell-side
analysts (mostly from Canada) cite the expected transformation of the Logica business as
a reason to own the stock. These same bullish analysts model margin expansion in CGI's
European businesses.


Deutsche Bank is the only sell-side firm that has a "sell" rating on the Company's stock; it
is also the only bulge bracket firm providing research coverage on CGI.


What is cookie jar accounting? How does it relate to acquisition accounting?


Cookie jar accounting is when a company understates profits in one period, so that it can
overstate profits in a subsequent period. The understated profits in the first period build a
"cookie jar" of losses that can be reversed to increase earnings in the subsequent periods.


Companies can manipulate accruals on the balance sheet (such as receivables, work-in-
progress, deferred revenues, and provisions) in order to create the losses that function as
earnings cookie jars. For example, if a company creates a provision to accrue for
expected future losses in one period, the same company can record a gain in a
subsequent period if those expected losses do not materialize. Arthur Levitt, the former
Chairman of the SEC, explained the concept in a 1998 speech:


"[An] illusion played by some companies is using unrealistic assumptions to estimate
liabilities for such items as sales returns, loan losses or warranty costs. In doing so,
they stash accruals in cookie jars during the good times and reach into them when
needed in the bad times."


Restructurings can present opportunities for companies to create earnings cookie jars.
Walter Schuetze, the SEC's former Chief Accountant of the Division of Enforcement,
explained this in a 1999 speech entitled Cookie Jar Reserves :

"The occasion of a merger also spawns the wholesale establishment of restructuring
or merger reserves… Write-offs of the carrying amounts of bad receivables. Write-
offs of cost of obsolete inventory. Write-downs of plant and equipment costs, which,
miraculously at the date of the merger, become nonrecoverable, whereas those
same costs were considered recoverable the day before the merger... Recognition of
liabilities for moving people. For training people. For training people not yet hired.
For retraining people… Or some liabilities that go by the title of "other." It is no
wonder that investors and analysts are complaining about the credibility of these
numbers."


Acquisitions are interesting moments to engage in cookie jar accounting because losses
recorded by the target company before the deal has closed are offset with an increase in
the goodwill of the acquiring company. This means that an acquirer can build a cookie jar
without ever recording losses in its reported EPS. This is because goodwill acts as a plug
on an acquirer's balance sheet between the price paid for a target company and the net
book value of the target company.


Are Logica's earnings patterns consistent with cookie jar accounting?


The Logica acquisition was announced in May 2012 and did not close until August 2012.
The accounting related to the acquisition was partly summarized in a Business Acquisition
Report that was filed on November 11, 2012 in three Schedules (A, B, and C). Schedule B
contains Logica's financials for the six months ended June 30, 2012, before those
financials were harmonized with CGI's internal accounting policies.


We combined Logica's historical financial statements, Schedule B of the Business
Acquisition Report, and CGI filings in order to see how the adjusted operating profit of its
businesses changed over time.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 4/12


What we find is that the profitability of Logica businesses dropped dramatically in the
period immediately preceding the August 2012 acquisition and exceeded the 2010 levels
after the acquisition. The financial statements for 1H 2012 show £190 million (or $304
million) of adjusted operating losses. Those financials were unaudited and prepared by
CGI - not by Logica - even though they correspond to a period preceding the acquisition.


The 1H 2012 losses are noteworthy because they are inconsistent with the +6.5% margin
guidance that was given by Logica just weeks before the end of that period, on May 11,
2012. We quote from a Profit Forecast that was reviewed by Logica's auditors and filed
with the UK regulators:


"Our full year revenue and margin guidance remains unchanged despite our
expectation of a subdued second quarter given the impact of elections in several
countries and a cautious economic outlook for our main markets. Full year revenue
growth is expected to be in the range of -2% to +2% and we expect our full year
2012 operating margin to be above 6.5% even in tough market conditions" [Note that
'operating margin' here refers to the adjusted operating margin we have used in our
analysis].


The difference between Logica's +6.5% full-year guidance and the -10.2% result reported
by CGI is roughly 17 points of adjusted operating margin. Using Logica's reported £1,866
million of revenues for the corresponding period, 17 points of adjusted operating margin is
equal to over £300 million or roughly $500 million in adjusted operating profit.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 5/12


This $500 million figure is equal to nearly 80% of all earnings before income taxes earned
by CGI in fiscal 2013.


We leave it to the reader to determine whether this pattern of earnings followed by losses
followed by margin expansion is consistent with cookie jar accounting as described by the
SEC.


What caused the 1H 2012 Logica losses?


In the November 2012 earnings call, CGI's management provided several explanations for
Logica's 1H 2012 losses.


The slowdown in the Company's revenue during this period was attributed to a) general
softness in Europe, b) seasonality, and c) "the sideways drift that always occurs or almost
always occurs in a targeted company between the announcement date and the closing
date." We will not address these three issues here, except to note that a) and b) should
have been anticipated in the guidance given by Logica on May 11, and c) would only have
affected 30 days of results, between May 31 and June 30.


Logica's losses in this period were also due to certain provisions that are disclosed on
note 2 and page 6 of Schedule B of the Business Acquisition Report. We thought that the
provisions circled in red below were interesting.


These provisions were unaudited non-cash charges to Logica's operating income that
were applied by CGI's management and totaled roughly £173 million, or $277 million.
David Anderson, CGI's CFO, explained the reasons for taking these charges in the
November 2012 conference call:


"There was also a provision taken for other claims in the amount of £34 million. Most
were project delivery issues having surfaced during this period for which we are
actively engaged to rectify. Then there was the £139 million provision taken for
expected future losses and write-offs on in-flight contracts. Simply put, we reviewed
the cost to complete Logica's fixed price contracts using the same screen that we
used for CGI. We then decided it was necessary to recognize forecasted cost
overruns and penalties across a number of projects."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 6/12


Reversing these provisions would allow CGI to record additional operating income without
generating additional operating cash flows.


We were surprised to see these provisions because Logica undertook its own
independent "thorough review" of its contracts in Q4 2011, which resulted in a one-time
charge of roughly £39 million. We would have expected this Q4 2011 review to capture
any necessary provisions.


Did CGI reverse any of the 1H 2012 Logica provisions?


We learn on pages 24-25 of CGI's fiscal 2013 MD&A that CGI saw working capital
increase $282 million in FY 2013, and that $80 million of that figure is attributable to "the
utilization of approximately $80.0 million of the estimated losses on revenue-generating
contracts which originated from the acquisition" [emphasis added].


The reversal of $80 million of the contract provisions generated operating income of $80
million for CGI but did not generate any cash flow.


We are curious about what detailed assumptions led CGI first to write down the value of
these contracts prior to the acquisition, and write up the value of these contracts after the
acquisition. Again, we leave it to the reader to determine whether this pattern of contract
valuation is consistent with cookie jar accounting techniques.


How much did other working capital accounts move?


If a company is engaging in cookie jar accounting, we should expect to see large moves in
working capital accounts. Changes in working capital are one component of the difference
between earnings and cash flow from operations. When working capital grows in a
company, the company generates less cash than it otherwise would with the same
earnings but no increase in working capital.


Page 10 of CGI's FY 2013 financials shows us that CGI's working capital grew $282
million in fiscal 2013. The size of this increase is meaningful relative to CGI's $456 million
of earnings generated over the same period. The $282 million figure is subtracted from the
earnings to derive the operating cash flow.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 7/12


Note 26 of the same set of CGI FY 2013 financials contains a breakdown of this $282
million increase in working capital. The relevant table from this note is shown below.


Here, we learn the remarkable fact that the Company's total working capital grew by $282
million even though accounts receivable shrunk by $280 million, and accrued
compensation grew by $164 million. Both the shrinking of accounts receivable and the
increase in accrued compensation had the effect of reducing CGI's working capital.


Therefore, without the movement in accounts receivable and accrued compensation, the
working capital would have increased $726 million instead of $282 million.


We focus our analysis on the receivables and accrued compensation accounts because
we wonder whether CGI can shrink its receivables and grow the accrued compensation
further. Receivables and accrued compensation are generally tied to short-term timing
differences between accruals and cash flows. Reader should note that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 8/12


Accounts receivable shrunk because CGI received more cash from its customers than
it billed, but over time, CGI cannot receive more cash than it bills.
Accrued compensation increased because CGI recognized charges for compensation
in excess of amounts paid out in cash for compensation; in the long term, CGI should
make cash payments that match these accruals.


We think it is interesting to consider that if receivables and accrued compensation had not
moved over fiscal 2013, the operating cash flow would have been cut by 66% and
reduced to $227 million instead of $671 million.


The $726 million of growth in working capital excluding receivables and accrued
compensation is partly due to reversals of valuation adjustments that were made by CGI
upon the close of the Logica acquisition. The valuation adjustments (made in accounts
such as work in progress and deferred revenue) will be analyzed in a subsequent Seeking
Alpha entry. For the moment, we will note that the reversals generated earnings but no
cash flows in fiscal 2013.


We will leave it to the reader to determine whether a $726 million increase in working
capital excluding receivables and accrued compensation, which creates earnings but no
cash flows and is driven by reversals of charges taken in a prior-period acquisition, is
consistent with the use of cookie jar accounting.


What has CGI's CFO said about its accounting for the Logica acquisition?


David Anderson, CGI's CFO, has not, to our knowledge, specifically addressed the $80
million reversal of charges at Logica recorded in the 1H 2012 stub period in Schedule B of
the Business Acquisition Report.


However, Anderson has made several comments related to other aspects of CGI's
accounting for the Logica acquisition. For example, he has addressed the earnings impact
of the valuation adjustments made in the Logica purchase price allocation.


Here, we cite two comments made by Anderson in regard to the Company's accounting
for the Logica acquisition:


Q2 2013 earnings call: "When we take a look at all the net adjustments up and down, it
wasn't really that significant. If you were to look at note number seven in the financial

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 9/12


statements, it did look like there were some other changes that were taking place. A
number of those changes were nothing more than just reclassifications, items that
were in the short term that have been reclassified to long-term and vice versa. So as
we just work our way through the 12 months, we're looking at those assumptions and
we just continue to refine those as better information comes forward. To date, there's
only been about a 3.8% adjustment to the goodwill, so it hasn't really been
significant or material. It hasn't really driven any significant impact to the P&L. Again,
just slight refinements within some of the regions and we're trying to make sure that
you get visibility to that. We will continue to monitor some of the projects, etc."


Q3 2013 earnings call: "As you know, under IFRS companies have 12 months from the
date of an acquisition to complete the allocation of the purchase price. After nine
months, a cumulative impact of all the adjustments to the purchase price
allocation on our EPS was negligible representing 0.6%."


In future entries on Seeking Alpha, we will examine issues related to the Logica purchase
price allocation onto CGI's balance sheet, and will compare our findings with these and
other management statements.


Summary


In this note, we have discussed the following:


Cookie jar accounting is when a company understates profits in one period, so that it
can overstate profits in a subsequent period.
Logica's business showed years of steady adjusted operating profits until the period
just preceding CGI's acquisition of the company; following the acquisition, CGI's
European operations saw margin expansion.
Logica's losses in 1H 2012 were inconsistent with guidance provided by the company
in May 2012; the difference between May's guidance and June's results was roughly
$500 million in adjusted operating profit.
The losses in Logica's 1H 2012 were partly due to non-cash provisions taken on
contracts.
$80 million of these provisions were reversed by CGI in fiscal 2013; the reversal of
these provisions generated $80 million of operating income but no operating cash flow.
The total increase in CGI's working capital over fiscal 2013 was $282 million, even
though accounts receivable shrunk by $280 million and accrued compensation grew
by $164 million.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1947571-cgi-group-cookie-jar-accounting-and-the-logica-acquisition-part-1 10/12


Had accounts receivable and accrued compensation remained unchanged over fiscal
2013, CGI's working capital would have increased by roughly $726 million, a figure
which is larger than CGI's pre-tax earnings for fiscal 2013. This is important because
when working capital grows in a company, it generates less cash flow than it otherwise
would with the same earnings and no working capital increase.
This $726 million figure is partly the result of the reversal of valuation adjustments that
were made by CGI for the Logica acquisition. These reversals generated earnings but
no cash.
It is unclear whether and how much CGI will be able to continue shrinking accounts
receivable and growing accrued compensation.


In subsequent notes, we will continue discussion of CGI's acquisition accounting and will
also look at topics such as organic growth, bookings, government margins, government
subsidies, and restructuring charges.
