SinoTech Energy: Enhanced Oil Recovery or Capital Extraction? 
 
Just like the recently halted Longtop Financial Technologies (LFT), Sinotech 
Energy Limited (NASDAQ: CTE) is not a Chinese Reverse Merger.  It was born in 
November 2010 via an IPO underwritten by UBS and Lazard Capital Markets, 
both of whom recently have “buy” ratings on the stock.  It also has a “Big 4” 
auditor, E&Y.  However, as we learned from Longtop, pedigree is no substitute 
for on the ground due diligence.  A thorough investigation of CTE (by the same 
research team holding a 100% accurate and unbroken track record of 
uncovering fraud at RINO, CGA, CBEH, SCEI and LFT) concludes that CTE, its 
largest customers and suppliers are likely nothing more than empty shells with 
little or no sales or income.  This report shows: 
 


1. CTE’s sole import agent accounting for over $100 million worth of oil 
drilling equipment orders appears to be an empty shell with no sign of 
operation, a limited import history and negligible revenue base. 


2. CTE’s sole chemical supplier appears to be an empty shell, with little or no 
revenues, a deserted office and no signs of production activity. 


3. Likewise, CTE’s five largest subcontracting customers, providing the vast 
majority of CTE’s revenues, appear to be shell companies with 
unverifiable operations and minimal revenues themselves 


4. CTE’s oil drilling technology is questionable, mispriced and uncompetitive 
5. CTE’s audited financial statements filed with Chinese Government’s State 


Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) further confirm its 
negligible business operations 


6. CTE’s board of directors lacks independence and effective oversight of 
management, evidenced by undisclosed related party dealings 


7. CTE stock is theoretically worth less than $0.63 per share but investors 
will likely recover nothing 


 
Background 
 
CTE claims to be a leading non-state owned provider of Enhanced Oil Recovery 
(EOR) services to major oil and gas fields in China with two key recovery 
techniques: Lateral Hydraulic Drilling (LHD) and Molecular Deposition Film 
(MDF) chemical oil separation.  The LHD service uses high-pressure water jets to 
drill horizontal holes in multiple directions from an existing vertical well to the 
surrounding reservoirs in order to increase the quantity of oil and methane gas 
flow.  MDF is a chemical solution that creates an ultra thin film that separates oil 
from the sand, enabling oil to flow more freely and efficiently to the oil pump. 
 
CTE disclosed that it obtained the exclusive right to use the LHD equipment in 
China from Jet Drill Well Services, LLC of Texas (Jet Drill), and purchases LHD 
equipment manufactured by affiliates of Jet Drill through an exclusive import 
agent, Dongying Luda Petrochemical Equipment Co. Ltd (Dongying Luda).  
Through Aug 1, 2011, CTE had purchased 16 LHD units through Dongying Luda.  
In addition, CTE has planned to further increase its fleet of LHD units to 20 by 
the end of 2011.
2 


CTE acquired the ownership of the underlying patents to the MDF technology 
from Professor Manglai Gao (高芒来) of China Petroleum University, the original 
inventor.   Pursuant to an exclusive supply agreement, CTE purchases the MDF 
from Tianjin Shanchuan Petroleum Chemicals Co., Ltd (Tianjin Shanchuan), an 
entity affiliated with Professor Gao according to CTE’s latest 20-F filing.   
 
The performance of MDF and most LHD services are then subcontracted to 
several 3rd party oilfield service providers (subcontractors).  In other words, the 
subcontractors are responsible for rendering the actual services, collecting fees 
from end oilfield customers and paying CTE the contractual share of its service 
fee (usually RMB 2500 per meter drilled for oil wells, RMB 900 per meter drilled 
for gas well, RMB 300 per ton of oil production from MDF) or alternatively a flat 
annual fee on a monthly basis.  The following diagram illustrates CTE’s business 
model: 
 


 
 
The economics of the LHD business plan seems to be exceptionally good with 
each LHD unit supposedly generating about $7 million of revenue and $3 million 
of earnings (according to management).  With a per unit capital expenditure of 
$6-7 million per management (consistent with the $6.87 million disclosed in the 
20-F), each unit generates 44% annual return on investment and pays back its 
investment in just a little over two years.  As for the MDF business, CTE spent 
less than $500K to acquire the patents underlying the technology, subcontracts 
the performance of all MDF contracts and generates close to $20 million in 
annual revenue with 88% gross margins.  
 
At first glance this is a beautiful business model.  Financially, the only issue 
seems to be that CTE has never generated any positive free cash flow while its 
capital expenditure budget keeps growing.  However, closer scrutiny and several 
months of fieldwork show CTE appears to operate almost entirely through a 
network of shell companies with shell suppliers selling to shell customers, 
despite management’s many “demonstrations” of LHD equipment actually being
3 


used in the field.   Just because management can demonstrate a LHD device in 
operation does not mean the numbers are real.  Given the existence of CTE 
Chairman’s other related businesses outside the public company, we must be 
mindful of what we see.  Ask the following questions: 
 


1. Which company’s employees really operated the LHD equipment? 
2. Does the LHD equipment really look like something worth over $6.5 


million? (Competitors quote similar products for less than 1/10th of that) 
3. Who really bought and imported the equipment? CTE or its import agent? 
4. Are the customers, suppliers and subcontractors really totally unrelated 


to CTE as claimed? 
 
First Shell: Import Agent Dongying Luda  
 
CTE’s annual report on form 20-F disclosed the following about Dongying Luda: 
 
We purchase our LHD units from Jet Drill through Dongying Luda, which acts as our import agent 
for the purchase of these units. In addition to import-related services, Dongying Luda provides us 
with services related to the assembly, testing and fine-tuning of our LHD equipment and sells us 
ancillary tools and equipment. 
 
Based on the publicly disclosed LHD unit cost of $6.6-$6.87 million, we thus 
estimate CTE has paid at least $105 million to Dongying Luda to procure 16 LHD 
units through August 1 2011.  In addition, management explained that Dongying 
Luda, through the port of Dongying, works as import agents for other clients, in 
addition to Tianjin New Highland (TNH), CTE’s operating subsidiary in China.  
We would thus expect Dongying Luda to be a substantial operation with 
significant revenues. 
 
Three unusual contradictions immediately stand out: 
 


1) The SAIC filings of Dongying Luda showed 2009 revenue of only RMB 1.3 
million and a negligible loss (link to SAIC financials here).  2010 numbers 
haven’t been filed.  This is in great contrast to what we were told a 
technologically advanced importer with multiple clients. 


2) It is unclear to us what legitimate benefit CTE may gain from using an 
import agent when it already has its own license and ability to import, 
saving considerable money, as can be seen on the Chinese customs 
website screenshot below:

Readers can verify this by visiting 
http://query.customs.gov.cn/HYW2007DataQuery/CompanyQuery.aspx 
and entering SinoTech’s Chinese name into the first text box (天津新高地
科技发展有限公司), and the security code into the second text box.   


 
3) We find it strange CTE’s purchase cost per LHD unit is over $6.5 million 


while a competitor, Radial Drilling Services LLC, selling similar equipment 
with the identical technology quotes a price of only USD $300-700K (as 
discussed in the section about Jet Drill below) 


 
Further investigation into Dongying Luda revealed it apparently has no 
significant operation or business activity at all.   Below is a list of the evidence 
gathered in support of this conclusion: 
 


1) Dongying Luda is unreachable by phone.  We attempted to locate the correct 
phone number of Dongying Luda through various means, including local SAIC 
registration, telephone directories, Internet search, etc.  The only phone 
number we were able to find goes directly to a fax.  In addition, an Internet 
search using various Chinese search engines yielded next to no public record 
about this company. 


 
2) CTE’s purchases of LHD units through Dongying Luda dated as early as 2007 


(link here to Agency Appointment Agreement dated July 1 2007 filed by CTE), 
are contradicted by official records from the Dongying Municipal Bureau of 
Commerce (东营市商务局) showing Dongying Luda had no import license 
prior to August 31 2009. 


 
Companies in China are required to have a special license before engaging in 
foreign trade activities.  This link (here) and the screenshot below is an official 
government record, dated Aug 31, 2009, when Dongying Luda was issued its 
import/export license by the Dongying Municipal Bureau of Commerce.  A 
conversation with the Ms. Han from the Bureau (Tel: +86 546 8318312) also 
confirmed that Dongying Luda had no import license prior to Aug 31, 2009.  
How could CTE possibly have purchased LHD units through Dongying Luda 
back in 2007?

3) Ultimate proof of Dongying Luda’s lack of operation – The Official Record from 
Chinese Customs (中国海关总署) shows Dongying Luda, through June 1, 2011, 
declared total imports of merely USD$1,268.46 since receiving its import 
license on August 31, 2009.   


 
The two screenshots below are the official records of Dongying Luda’s 
importing/exporting activities since 2009, obtained from Qingdao Customs of 
the PRC Government.   As described by the Customs Records, the only record 
of goods ever imported by Dongying Luda was $1,268.46 worth of “samples” 
on December 9, 2010.

Picture 2: The details of the Dec 9th 2010 entry. 





4) Site visit to Dongying Luda’s address revealed no sign of operations 
 


Dongying Luda’s registered address is No. 313, 3/F, Area 1, East Meirenyuan, No. 
6 Plot, Dongcheng Trade City, Dongying, Shandong Province, 257091 (山东省东
营市东城商贸城 6 号地段东美人园一区三层 313 号)
7 


These three characters “东美人” roughly translate to “eastern beautiful woman” 
(East Meirenyuan).  Our investigator took a picture from the street as he 
approached the building showing these three characters on a sign: 
 


 
 
Below is a picture of the main complex housing a building & decoration materials 
wholesale market: 
 


 
 
The East Meirenyuan building is actually a residential apartment.  The picture 
below was taken inside the building.  We see these three letters again on the 
building directory:
8 


 
 
At the entrance to the office, we took a picture of the locked door: 
 


 
 
An on-duty security guard estimated that the square footage of the rented space 
is approximately 300 square feet and noted that one person sometimes enters or 
exits the office.  This is not the type of office space we would expect to find for a 
technologically sophisticated import business having handled over $100 million 
worth of goods, and it’s certainly not a place where industrial equipment could 
be assembled, tested, or fine-tuned. 
 
In a subsequent conference call to confront management with our concerns, we 
caught them red-handed trying to cover up the truth of Dongying Luda’s lack of 
importing activities (we recorded the call).  The CEO cited CTE’s lack of an 
import license as one of the reasons for using Dongying Luda and insisted to us 
that Dongying Luda brought in the parts of the LHD units through the port of 
Dongying since July 2007.  The parts are then assembled, tested and fine-tuned 
in Dongying and then transported to Tianjin.  Yet incredibly, the management did 
not even know the address where Dongying Luda performed the assembly and 
testing and CTE has been unable to provide this key info in our follow-up 
communication.
9 


 
CTE’s CEO further explained that Dongying Luda takes the inventory risks of the 
parts they bought from Jet Drill and sell the assembled unit to CTE for the RMB 
equivalent amount of the unit cost of $7 million.  If this were true, we would 
expect to see Dongying Luda reporting at least $105 million worth of revenue.  
The CEO also explained that Dongying Luda provided import services for other 
large oilfields customers.   If that were the case, we would have seen a lot of 
activity on the official customs records.  CTE was unwilling or unable to provide 
us with proof of Dongying Luda’s import records, custom clearance documents 
and any tariff payment.   
 
The combination of multiple pieces of evidence makes it clear that Dongying 
Luda has very limited operations and import history.  The main purpose of such 
a shell company is often to funnel money out to trick the auditor.  Even though 
LHD units certainly exist in the field (perhaps imported directly by CTE or its 
other related entities), it seems unlikely that Dongying Luda imported them.  
Given the fact that about $105 million was supposedly paid to Dongying Luda for 
the purchase of the 16 LHD units through August 1, 2011, CTE needs to address 
where this money really went. 
 
 
Second Shell - Tianjin Shanchuan, the sole supplier of MDF 
 
The MDF segment contributed $19.4 million of revenue, or 42.8% of sales in 
2010.  CTE management claims that MDF technology “increases oil recovery 
from mature wells by displacing the residual oil that adheres to sedimentary 
rock or sand in the oil reservoir”.  While the MDF solution is patented, the 
technique of using soap-like chemicals to improve yield is nothing new.  For 
interested readers, there is a book covering this topic called “Modern Chemical 
Enhanced Oil Recovery” available at Amazon.  We haven’t read it, but we suspect 
few if any of the 648 pages of this book are devoted to technology unique to CTE.   
 
According to its 20-F filing, CTE purchases its MDF under a five-year contract 
from Tianjin Shanchuan, a chemical manufacturer supposedly affiliated with 
Professor Manglai Gao: 
  
“We entered into a five-year supply contract with Tianjin Shanchuan, a chemical manufacturer 
affiliated with Professor Manglai Gao, or Professor Gao, on May 8, 2008 to manufacture and supply 
our MDF chemicals exclusively for us or parties designated by us. …” 
 
Shockingly during our two separate phone interviews by two different 
investigators, Professor Gao, denied having any relationship or affiliation with 
any such entity named Tianjin Shanchuan during our phone interview.  In fact, 
Gao insisted he had never heard of this company even after we spelled its full 
name and pointed out its detailed address (We recorded this call).  A recorded 
phone conversation can be shared to support what we say here if needed.  Gao 
did confirm that he sold both generations of his MDF patents to CTE, though this 
was inconsistent with CTE’s own disclosure that it purchased only the 2nd 
generation technology from Gao.  We later confirmed through the official State 



http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Chemical-Enhanced-Oil-Recovery/dp/1856177459�
10 


Intellectual Property Office website that the ownership of 1st generation MDF 
patents were transferred by Professor Gao to some individuals designated by the 
CTE, outside of its Tianjin New Highland (TNH) subsidiary. 
 
Our extensive investigation into Tianjin Shanchuan left us with the conclusion 
that it is likely another shell company without any significant business activities.  
The main evidence we gathered includes: 
 
1. Tianjin Shanchuan could not be reached. Just like Dongying Luda, Tianjin 


Shanchuan does not have a website, phone number or fax number registered 
at the local SAIC.  Our attempts to reach it obviously failed.  There is very 
little information about this company available through web searching its 
Chinese name 天津山川石油化工有限公司.   


2. Audited financials by local PRC firms filed with SAIC indicate negligible 
revenue and operations.  Audited financials from Tianjin SAIC showed a 
2009 revenue of merely ¥225,490 (or USD $33k) and a net loss of ¥121,117 
(USD $17.8k).  Link to Tianjin Shanchuan credit report based on SAIC 
records can be downloaded (here).  Click (here) for original audited 
financials from official records of the Tianjin State Administration of 
Industry and Commerce and (here) a translated version.   


3. Site visit to Tianjin Shanchuan’s current address found a deserted, 
empty office with no manufacturing operation.  The official registered 
address of Tianjin Shanchuan is: 
 
NO. 309, WANXIANG ROAD, DAGANG, BINHAI NEW DISTRICT,  
TIANJIN, 300273 PR CHINA 
天津市滨海新区大港万象路 309 号 


 
This first picture shows the building address with Chinese characters matching 
those above (万象路 309): 
 


 
 
Stepping back from the address label, we see the full façade of the building:

Looking through the glass, our investigator took the following two pictures:
12 


 
When challenged to provide the address for Tianjin Shanchuan, CTE 
management gave us an address identical to the one we visited.  On top of that, 
CTE management arranged a phone conversation between our investigator and 
Mr. Zhang, the legal representative of Tianjin Shanchuan, who affirmed again 
that we visited the correct address.  Without telling Mr. Zhang we had already 
photographed his empty office, we asked whether our investigator could visit his 
office in the next couple of days.  Alerted and uncomfortable, Mr. Zhang 
immediately and said he couldn’t meet us because he and his entire staff were 
out of town on vacation. 
 
The multiple pieces of evidence indicating that Tianjin Shanchuan is nothing 
more than a shell operation, along with the fact that CTE subcontracts all of its 
MDF field services to two questionable subcontractors (discussed below), left us 
with grave concerns about the validity of its reported MDF segment results.  
Furthermore, why did CTE make such an inaccurate disclosure about Tianjin 
Shanchuan’s affiliation with Professor Gao, a company he clearly has never heard 
of? 
 
On a conference call between our investigator and CTE management on August 
14, 2011, management repeated their story of Tianjin Shanchuan’s affiliation 
with Professor Gao.  Management also claimed Tianjin Shanchuan has sold about 
RMB 30 million worth of MDF solutions to CTE and its two subcontractors 
annually, however, we have since confirmed from the recently filed official SAIC 
records that Tianjin Shanchuan reported a calendar year 2010 revenue of zero.  
As shown in the screenshot below, the explanation given by Tianjin Shanchuan 
itself in its official filing to the Chinese government for its lack of reported 
revenue is “Low business volume and high operating costs (业务量低，业务成
本)”.  Click (here) for the original 2010 Annual Joint Inspect Report filed by 
Tianjin Shanchuan at SAIC.

13 


 
 
Last but not least, we discovered a disturbing coincidence that Tianjin 
Shanchuan and CTE’s Chinese subsidiary, Tianjin New Highland (TNH), both 
shared the same 2009 PRC auditor (Tianjin Zhengtai CPA Ltd or 天津正泰有限责
任会计师事务所) who just happened to sign off on both supposedly unrelated 
parties’ 2009 SAIC audits on the very same day (March 14, 2010)! Click (here) 
and (here) to download the auditor’s report enclosed with CTE’s and Tianjin 
Shanchuan’s SAIC financials.  We understand this is not any proof to suggest an 
undisclosed related party relationship but is this really a mere coincidence? 
 
Five More Shells: Direct customers accounting for over 85% of 
2010 Sales  
 
The following is the list of significant customers disclosed in CTE’s 2010 20-F 
filing:  
 







http://alfredlittle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Item-3.-Tianjin-Shanchuan-SAIC-Audit-Report.pdf�

http://alfredlittle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Item-5.-TNH-SAIC-Audit-Report.pdf�
14 


Four of the direct customers/subcontractors list above accounted for over 85% 
of CTE’s total revenue in FY 2010.  With the new contracts signed after 
September 2010, we expect such concentration to increase in FY2011. 
 
The most puzzling piece of the CTE story, in our opinion, is the significant fee 
revenue generated from CTE’s two largest subcontractors accounting for all MDF 
sales and a substantial amount of LHD contracts.   Hebei Daofu Petroleum 
Prospecting Technology Development Co Ltd (Hebei Daofu) and Panjin Hanyu 
Oil Technology Development Co Ltd. (Panjin Hanyu), accounted for 23.03% and 
19.94%, respectively, of CTE’s FY2010 revenues and should gain further revenue 
share in FY2011 based on the following paragraph from 20-F: 
 
In December 2010, we modified our agreements with Hebei Daofu and Panjin Hanyu. Under the 
terms of our modified agreement with Hebei Daofu, we are obliged to supply three LHD units and 
one testing unit. Hebei Daofu will pay us a fixed annual service fee for each LHD unit of RMB50 
million and a fixed annual service fee for each testing unit of RMB2 million. These fees are payable 
by Hebei Daofu to us on a monthly basis at RMB12.7 million per month. Under the terms of our 
modified agreement with Panjin Hanyu, we are obliged to supply two LHD units and one testing unit. 
Panjin Hanyu will pay us a fixed annual service fee for each LHD unit of RMB50 million and a fixed 
annual service fee for each testing unit of RMB2 million. These fees are payable by Panjin Hanyu to 
us on a monthly basis at RMB8.5 million per month. Under each of the contracts with Panjin Hanyu 
and Hebei Daofu, we are responsible for formulating a construction plan for each well, supplying 
spare parts without charge within a specified quota, repairing equipment annually bearing the 
expenses, providing technical training and updates and supervising the construction quality on-site. 
 
The modified LHD service contracts provide CTE with monthly, rent-like service 
revenues totaling about RMB 254 million or USD $39 million for the full year.  
This revenue stream is largely operational-risk free to CTE as Hebei Daofu and 
Panjin Hanyu are responsible for the operational aspects, as well as guaranteeing 
the procurement of a certain number of wells for CTE.  In addition to LHD 
contracts, Hebei Daofu and Panjin Hanyu are contractually obligated under the 
MDF subcontracts to pay CTE, at least, an annual total of RMB 93.9 million (USD 
$14.4 million) in service fees.  These two subcontracting arrangements alone are 
expected to generate a minimum of $53.4 million, or 48.5%, of CTE’s latest 
revenue guidance for FY2011. 
 
We set out to verify these relationships expecting to find two well-established 
oilfield service providers with large revenue bases and deep pockets, given 
they’ve agreed to taken on such large financial commitments to CTE.  Our 
findings, once again, disappointed us and revealed another two questionable 
entities with unverifiable business operations and negligible revenues.  Worse, 
we found Hebei Daofu to be an undisclosed related party entity to CTE. 
 
First of all, SAIC filings show that Hebei Daofu generated only RMB 50k (USD 
$7.4k) of revenue in 2010 and a small loss (link here for the original electronic 
records obtained from local SAIC and here for the English version based on SAIC 
filings).  SAIC filings for Panjin Hanyu show a similar RMB 65k (USD $9k) of 
revenue and a net loss of $14.6k in 2010 (link here for original annual joint 
inspection report from the local SAIC and here for the translated financials).  
Second, just like CTE’s import agent and MDF supplier, neither company has a 
website.  Nor could we find any meaningful information from Internet searches

using their Chinese names.  Neither company has official registered phone or fax 
numbers at the local SAIC.  
 
Site visits support the hypothesis that these companies are non-operational.  
Hebei Daofu’s address is 河北省任丘市西环建材市场 11 号楼北 4 号 or No. 4 
Northern No. 11 building, Xihuan Building Material market, Renqiu City, Hebei 
Province.  Our investigator only found a lighting fixture vendor operating out of 
this address who knew nothing of Hebei Daofu.  A picture of the lighting store 
can be found in the photo below:
16 


 
Panjin Hanyu’s address is 盘锦市兴隆台区惠宾街 101 号, or No. 101, Hubin 
Street, Xinglongtai District, Panjin, Liaoning Province.  The first photo is a shot of 
the front of the building we found: 
 


 
 
The next photo shows a closer shot of the sign next to the garage matching the 
Chinese name of the company (翰宇石油技术开发有限公司); 
 


 
 
However, despite our ability to find the office, it was locked during normal 
business hours, and our investigator waited over an hour for anyone to show up 
(evidenced by the timestamps).    It’s also worth pointing out that, out of all the 
other businesses/tenants located at No. 101, Hubin Street, Panjin Hanyu’s “office” 
was the only one without an Air Conditioner exterior unit being installed as 
shown in the picture above.
17 


Although there is no official business phone number registered for Panjin Hanyu 
at local SAIC, we did manage to find names and contacts of some individuals 
designated to handle the registration/renewal of its businesses licenses.  One 
such individual left a local fixed line number leading to a fax machine, as well as a 
cell phone number from the city of Tianjin (the same city where CTE’s head office 
used to be located).   
 
The most significant evidence of Panjin Hanyu being a shell company is its 2010 
balance sheet filed with SAIC (link here).  Panjin Hanyu was established in 2006 
with a meaningful contribution of RMB 9.6 million of registered capital.  
However, we could hardly see any meaningful amount assets (cash, inventories, 
receivables, PP&E) one would expect from an operating business’s balance sheet.  
The major asset on the balance sheet is a large unknown “Other Receivable” in an 
amount fairly close to the paid-in capital.  This indicates the registered capital 
original funded was later pulled out of the company, most likely, through some 
type of loan or other advances after the money was used to satisfy the legal 
capital verification requirement of setting up the company.   Judging from the 
looted balance sheet and lack of earnings, even if Panjin Hanyu is for all practical 
purposes another shell operation. 
 
Much more disturbing is the fact Hebei Daofu appears to be an undisclosed 
related party to CTE’s Chinese operating subsidiary, Tianjin New Highland (TNH).  
The following two pictures of official SAIC filings show the names of the three 
original founding shareholders of TNH (天津新高地科技发展有限公司), one of 
whom is Peiju Yan (ID #: 13098419741127571X).  As shown on the 3rd 
screenshot below from the official Hebei SAIC website, Peiju Yan is in fact the 
current 85% shareholder and legal representative of Hebei Daofu.

Commerce website 
 


 
From what we have seen so far, not only it is highly doubtful that these two 
entities, with combined revenues of $200k, are not nearly close to be able 
to pay the contractually obligated $53 million fees to CTE, but the 
undisclosed past relationship makes us even more suspicious that these 
leading subcontractors were set up merely for the purpose of supplying 
phony documents and sales invoices to help CTE pass its audit. 
 
The findings from our investigation of the other 3 major customers follow the 
same trend: un-locatable or vague street addresses, no way to contact the 
company, very little information from Internet searches and SAIC filings that 
indicate shell operations.  In addition, the two customers based in Northern
20 


China (Daqing Huajian and Shenyang Rising) were incorporated just over a year 
ago around March – April 2010.   For example, Daqing Huajian was incorporated 
on March 15 2010, just 2 weeks before it commenced the first LHD contract with 
CTE based on the 20-F.  Together, these 3 customers accounted for 48% of CTE’s 
FY 2010 revenues. 
 
The Liaoning Ouya Dongdi Coalbed Gas Technology Development Co (14.75% of 
FY 2010 revenue) was visited by two separate investigators on separate days.  
Both confirmed that the only business present at the registered address is the 
consignment store on the ground floor of this old residential apartment, as 
shown in the picture below:

A close up of the sign confirms the address: 
 


 
 
 
Likewise, the Shenyang Rising Methane Technology Service Co., the most recent 
customer that entered into a LHD service agreement with CTE starting in January 
2011, could not be found at its registered address.  Instead we found an 
apartment complex with a healthcare clinic and some other unrelated businesses 
on its ground floor.  Building management has never heard of such company.

In summary, the story we see unfolding is that shell companies with empty or 
unidentifiable offices are responsible for the vast majority of all revenues, 
expenses and capital investments of CTE.  The fact that, as admitted by 
management, CTE has outsourced not only some of the operational duties, but 
also the collection of payments to these five subonctractors/customers, left us 
concerned that CTE’s major business transactions records, supporting 
documents and financial invoices shown to the auditor all come from a tightly 
controlled network of shell companies, one of which appears suspiciously 
related to CTE itself. 
 
We challenged CTE management to provide us with alternative addresses for 
these customers and were given four identical (yet vague) addresses to the ones 
we visited (Daqing Huajian, Liaoning Ouya Dongdi, Shenyang Rising, Panjin 
Hanyu).  Subsequent phone conversations with Liaoning Ouya Dongdi and Panjin 
Hanyu arranged for us by the management also confirmed we previously visited 
the correct location.  The “new address” for the undisclosed related party Hebei 
Daofu (任丘市会战大道 6 所 1 信箱) appears to be a post office box.    
 
 
CTE’s audited financials filed with Chinese government support 
all of the above findings 
 
CTE has one operating subsidiary in the PRC, the Tianjin New Highland Science 
and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (TNH or 天津新高地科技发展有限公司).  
As the only PRC based subsidiary, its SAIC filings should closely resemble SEC 
filings, reporting full revenue, earnings, and similar assets.  What we find is a 
company generating negligible revenue, annual losses, and limited assets 
including cash and PP&E.   As TNH is a foreign invested entity in China, the 
annual financials submitted to the SAIC are audited.  Note that the legal 
representative of TNH also signed on the front page of its annual joint inspection 
report, acknowledging his responsibility for the accuracy and truthfulness of the 
financial information submitted.  The original audited financials (B/S, P&L and 
CFS) of filed by TNH to Tianjin Municipal SAIC can be viewed (here).  An English 
translation of the financials can be viewed (here).   In addition, we have further 
verified the accuracy of the audited financials from SAIC by comparing them to 
the ones filed with a different government agency, the State Administration of 
Foreign Exchange (SAFE).

The discrepancies between CTE’s PRC and SEC financials, as summarized below, 
are inexplicably large:   
 


 
 
The business presented in the audited financials to the Chinese government is 
clearly a dramatically smaller company that cannot be explained away as a 
simple accounting or translational error/difference.  Due diligence efforts on 
CTE’s MDF supplier, LHD import agent and direct clients and subcontractors 
outlined above have indicated to us that the SAIC filings reflect the true state of 
SinoTech Energy.  All evidence support the conclusion that SEC financial 
statements are unreliable. 
 
Jet Drill’s Competitor sells LHD units for less than 1/10th of the 
price CTE pays 
 
We place no value on CTE’s exclusive license to use Jet Drill technology, because 
we believe CTE’s claim of exclusivity and proprietaries of the LHD technology 
lacks merit.  Not only does competing radial drilling exist, but also it exists in 
China.  We are able to identify 3 competitors that offer very similar solutions: 
 


1) Radial Drilling Services Inc 
2) Well Enhancement Services LLC 
3) Maple Group 


 
Furthermore Jet Drill technology is neither different nor better.  Take a look at 
the websites of both Well Enhancement Services LLC and Shanghai Witsun 
Jetdrill Enhancement Services Co Ltd, a company that operates lateral water-jet 
drilling based EOR services in China.  Our conversation with Shanghai Witsun

confirmed that it purchases its lateral drilling rigs and equipment from Well 
Enhancement Services and offers the same services as CTE in China.  Both 
competitors even use the IDENTICAL slide explaining the LHD technology used 
in CTE’s 20-F: 
 


 
 
This slide is a key obstacle to CTE’s claims of exclusivity and uniqueness.  Since 
Well Enhancement Services’ website was set up prior to CTE’s 20-F filing, Well 
Enhancement Services could not possibly have plagiarized this slide from CTE’s 
20-F.  
 
A little history may help investors understand the competitive landscape a bit 
better.  Well Enhancement Services was bought out by Radial Drilling Services 
(RDS), a company that did similar work in Eastern Europe and Latin America. 
Before discovering CTE and China, Jet Drill was as a contracted equipment 
manufacturer for RDS.  RDS still operates Jet-Drill rigs in the US, and continues to 
grow the fleet (although they are no longer sourcing equipment from Jet-Drill).  
As of today, over 90% of Jet Drill’s revenue comes from its biggest customer, CTE.  
Shanghai Witsun also continues to operate Jet-Drill equipment in China and is 
growing its fleet.    
 
Maple Group has prepared an informative slide show (link here) comparing their 
technology to RDS and Jet-Drill, including market share statistics.  Investors will 
find this presentation invaluable.  Interestingly, Maple Group stated that with 
only 2 units in 2009, they already had 11% of global market share (a total 18 
units globally).  So assuming CTE’s reported LHD revenues are true, the market 
in China today is essentially about the same size of the global market less than 2 
years ago!  That begs the question that, if the Jet Drill LHD technology is so 
incredibly profitable, why does it only work well in China?  After all, our industry 
check suggests Jet Drill, up to today, has very minimal business in the US and is 
not taking any new orders until it upgrades its technology.

RDS is perhaps the largest and most sophisticated player in the radial drilling 
space, both in the US and abroad, with customers such as Luke Oil, Petrobras, 
Reposl, Chevron, Chesapeake, Inner Morgan etc.  It has recently signed an 
agreement to start a joint venture with Yantai Jereh Oilfield Services Group (a 
public company listed in Shanghai under 002353) to offer EOR service in China.  
We spoke with RDS to learn more about the economics of this business.  The 
most important thing we learned is that an LHD unit should cost between only 
$300-700k depending on “bells and whistles” installed, be it shallow or deep 
well units.  This is approximately the cost of a fire truck, in line with what we 
would expect, and a far cry from what CTE management claims to pay for an LHD 
unit through Dongying Luda.   We consider RDS’s price quote very credible since 
they used to source the very same units from Jet Drill.  
 
In addition, all three competitors we spoke to (RDS, Well Enhancement Services 
and Shanghai Witsun) expressed their belief that CTE and Jet Drill are “walking 
on thin ice” in terms of possible patent infringement.   We have no opinion about 
the merits of competitors’ claims but again it seems CTE’s LHD technology is far 
from unique and terribly uncompetitive based on its inflated price.   We believe 
that overpaying for these LHD units is an easy way management can take money 
out of the company without alerting auditors.  This hypothesis is supported by 
the strong evidence noted earlier in this report that Dongying Luda, the sole 
import agent of CTE’s LHD units, is likely a shell company, 
 
CTE’s Board of Directors lacks Independence and effective 
oversight 
 
As a Cayman Island domiciled foreign issuer CTE is exempted from having a 
board composed of a majority of independent directors.  Nevertheless we’re 
surprised a NASDAQ Global Select Market listed company with over $250 million 
market cap refuses to hold itself to a higher standard.  Only 2 out of the 6 
directors on CTE board are, by definition, independent.  One of the two is a PRC 
national who happens to have worked for the same Dagang oilfield with CTE’s 
Chairman in the past.  The only apparently independent and qualified director is 
the audit committee chair Ms. Jing Liu.   We question how such a board can 
properly function in terms of the necessary oversight of company practices and 
protection of shareholders. Examples of the board’s ineffective oversight include 
competition from related companies and related party dealings, both disclosed 
and undisclosed as follows: 
 
1. CTE Chairman appears to own a separate entity competing in the same 
business.  As the majority shareholder and Chairman of CTE, Mr. Qingzeng Liu 
should have no conflict of interest.  However, Mr. Liu happens to be the CEO of 
Singapore listed SKY China Petroleum Services, Ltd (SKY China).  The statement 
in Sinotech’s 20-F claiming that SKY China’s business does not currently compete 
with CTE is absolutely false and erroneous.  The following is the description for 
SKY China’s business:   
 
SKY China Petroleum Services Ltd, through its subsidiaries, provides petro-engineering solutions 
to the oil and gas industry in the People’s Republic of China. Its technical services segment
28 


provides engineering services in extraction of oil. The company’s drilling services segment 
provides technical and mechanical engineering services in the supervision of the use of 
directional drilling technology for the reworking of old wells. Its extraction of crude oil segment 
has the operating rights to extract crude oil from the Song Yuan oilfield in Jilin province, the 
People’s Republic of China. The company’s rental of drilling rig segment is in the business of 
leasing drilling rigs to external parties. In addition, it involves in the provision of 
petroengineering technical services. SKY China Petroleum Services Ltd was founded in 1995 and 
is based in Tianjin, the People’s Republic of China. 
 
In face of the unverifiable sales from current major customers, an even more 
troubling fact is that a significant portion of CTE’s historical revenues also came 
from SKY China’s subsidiary, Dagang Shengkang Petroleum Development Co Ltd 
(39.7% of FY 2008, 34% of FY 2009 revenues) until its MDF subcontract at 
Dagang Oilfield was replaced by a new one with the questionable Hebei Daofu in 
FY2010. 
 
2. Other possible and undisclosed related party dealings.  As we have proven 
above, CTE’s major supplier, import agent and large direct customers are all 
likely shell companies with unverifiable operations and negligible revenue.  One 
of these entities, Hebei Daofu, turns out to be controlled and owned by one of the 
founding shareholders (Peiju Yan) of TNH, CTE’s Chinese operating subsidiary.  
Is the board aware of this undisclosed related party dealing? 
 
On top of this past connection, Hebei Daofu’s legal representative Mr. Peiju Yan’s 
PRC ID #13098419741127571X indicates to us that he happens to come from 
the same town where CTE Chairman Qingzeng Liu is originally from, Cangzhou 
City in Hebei Province (河北省沧州市).    
 
We could not help but noticing, the shareholders or legal representatives of four 
other companies we investigated above (Dongying Luda, Tianjin Shanchuan, 
Panjin Hanyu, Daqing Huajian) are all from the very same town as Chairman Liu.   
Several individuals’ PRC ID were even issued in the very same Xian county (献县) 
where Mr. Liu came from.  Note that a county in China is much smaller than a 
town.  The following table summarizes the shareholders/legal representative 
information:
29 


 
Since Cangzhou is not a big city, we wonder what are the odds that a total of 3 
customers and 2 suppliers of CTE, while supposedly operating in different parts 
of China all happen to: 


a) Be owned/managed by people from the same 2nd tier city from Hebei (five 
such people came from tiny Xian County (2004 population 570,000) 


b) Have a significant percentage, if not all, of its business transactions with a 
U.S. listed company controlled by another businessman from the same 
home town 


c) Have numerous shell company characteristics mentioned above, i.e. 
vague/unverifiable street address, un-locatable offices, missing phone 
numbers, little information from internet search and minimal revenues 
based on SAIC filings, etc. 


 
It’s also worth pointing out that two of the customers (Shenyang Rising and 
Panjin Hanyu), despite unreachable by fixed line phone numbers, both have cell 
phone numbers left on records at local SAIC that lead to some unknown 
individual in Tianjin city, where CTE’s main subsidiary (TNH) as well as the 
Chairman’s other related businesses are located.   In addition, two supposedly 
unrelated companies, TNH and Tianjin Shanchuan, also just happen to have used 
the same local auditor to audit their 2009 SAIC financials signed off on the very 
same day.  Does any of this sound like a legitimate operation? 
 
Conclusion and Valuation – Less than $0.63 per Share 
 
As we learned in the recent collapse of a large number of fraudulent companies 
operating in China, the typical audit is not as effective as one would expect.  As 
shown in the cases of China MediaExpress (CCME), Longtop Financial 
Technologies (LFT), China Integrated Energy (CBEH) and Sino-Forest (TRE.TO), 
even the “Big 4” auditors failed to detect the frauds and were too quick to sign off 
on fabricated financials.  Auditors find it especially difficult to detect fraud in 
businesses like CTE that have few, or highly overpriced physical assets.  Our 
much closer investigation, however, clearly uncovered a company with a 
significant mismatch between SEC financial statements and the counterparts 
filed with Chinese government, with a network of shell companies acting 
together as a one-stop-shop to provide all business transaction documents, 
contracts and invoices to the auditor. 
 
On August 12, 2011, we confronted management with our concerns, giving them 
a chance to challenge our findings.  Although management originally stated they 
were willing to supply necessary documents to prove the existence of the 7 
questionable entities, they were unable or unwilling to provide acceptable proof 
(such as tax declaration forms filed by these 7 entities at local tax bureaus, tax 
invoices issued by the tax bureaus and proof of tax payments from the financial 
institutions).  We also requested management provide the correct business 
addresses of the 7 entities for us to verify.  After 3 days, we were supplied a list 
containing five of the same addresses our investigator had previously visited and 
documented above (Tianjin Shanchuan, Panjin Hanyu, Daqing Huajian, Shenyang 
Rising and Liaoning Ouya Dongdi), one “new address” that appears to be a post
30 


office box (Hebei Daofu) and one new office address for Dongying Luda which we 
have been unable to visit.   Most importantly, more than three days after CTE’s 
CEO first admitted on a recorded call that he was unaware of the address of 
Donying Luda’s LHD assembly facility, we are shocked CTE has still not provided 
us with this facility’s address considering it handles the final assembly and 
testing of each of CTE’s $6.5 million LHD units. 
 
Management instead insisted they could prove the existence of business 
transactions between these 7 entities and CTE by supplying us with the same 
documents they gave to the auditor.  We were not satisfied with this response, 
since all such documents are easily fabricated and the auditor, unlike our on the 
ground investigators, does not have the mandate or ability to scrutinize the 
operations of CTE’s purported customers, suppliers or import agent.  As our 
research has shown, none of these 7 entities in question appear to be of 
sufficient size to produce the Sales/Purchases reported by CTE.  The only 
thing such shell companies are good for producing is mountains of paper based 
documents to help CTE pass an audit, as we have seen in many other recently 
collapsed frauds. 
 
Given the likely very troubling implications (i.e. overstatement of revenue, 
earnings and capex, misappropriation of investors funds etc) based on the 
findings of our on the ground diligence, we believe the independent members of 
CTE’s Board of Directors should, acting in their fiduciary duties to protect 
investors, immediately start an investigation and attempt to lock down whatever 
funds they can secure that are still located in accounts outside the PRC (offshore).   
 
Given the extreme difficulty of recovering funds and assets located within 
China due to very limited legal recourse available to US investors, we 
believe the remaining offshore cash is the only value attributable to CTE.  
Management disclosed on the August 4 earnings call that such cash 
amounted to $38 million.   Therefore we think CTE stock is worth $0.63 per 
share (with 60.49 million shares outstanding), before subtracting legal 
costs and based on the assumption that the minority of independent 
directors convince the majority of the Board to take prompt action to 
prevent further loss of this cash.  Realistically, given the Board’s lack of 
independence and effective oversight discussed above, we believe this cash 
will be “gone by morning” and expect investors will recover nothing. 
 
NOTE: The authors of this report disclosed to Alfredlittle.com that they are 
short CTE.
