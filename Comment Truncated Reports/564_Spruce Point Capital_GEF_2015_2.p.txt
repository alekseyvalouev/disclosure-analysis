Change

Summary


Greif’s announcement on April 17th that it “Establishes a New Board Committee” for
strategic input appears to be nothing more than lip service to driving change.


Spruce Point believes Greif needs more accountability to public shareholders and its
stakeholders.


Spruce Point offers 6 simple recommendations Greif should consider.


Greif's (NYSE:GEF) (NYSE:GEF.B) announcement on April 17th that it "Establishes a
New Board Committee" appears to be nothing more than lip service to driving change.


Greif states that it,


Has been making progress on a strategic transformation plan that will allow us to
better align resources with the needs of customers, improve returns on invested
capital and better reward our shareholders.


Greif has been describing this "strategic transformation" for 10 years now - see 2004
press releases - with limited tangible results.


Greif says,


Our company has always benefited from a highly experienced and engaged Board
of Directors, and the creation of this committee increases management's opportunity
to leverage the deep experience of board members who have previously led
successful transformation efforts as executives in multifaceted global organizations.


Spruce Point observes that none of Greif's Board members appear to have any
experience in the packaging industry (e.g. one Board member is in the lawn and garden
products market and another in the tire business).

Spruce Point believes Greif needs more accountability to public shareholders and
its stakeholders than forming a "special committee" that comprises the exact same
Board members that have served the company since 2008. Are these not the exact
same Board members that have overseen the leveraged acquisition strategy that has left
Greif in a precarious financial position today? Greif's public shareholders have seen
fleeting returns from having compensated these individuals in cash by more than $5
million dollars since 2007.


Spruce Point believes more drastic measures are needed and is offering free advice
for immediate actions:


Bury your past, change your name: The name Greif (often confused by Grief) does
not appear to have much brand value, or convey any meaning. We suggest you ditch
this name immediately and rebrand the company to hide your past.
Cut Director Cash Compensation immediately to zero: The Directors do not appear
to have overseen the right course of strategy for the company. If they are committed
and truly believe that the transformation of the company can be achieved, they should
be willing to accept 100% stock for their services. Further, Greif states that,


Each of the directors attended at least 75% of the meetings held by the Board during
his or her respective term and held by the committees on which he or she served
during the 2014 fiscal year.


100% attendance should be mandatory without excuse. Greif has been experiencing
deflationary pressures in its businesses, yet its Director's cash compensation is easily
outpacing CPI inflation.

Cut Management's salary in half, grant stock options: As of the last proxy
statement, Greif paid out an egregious $9.1m of non-equity compensation to 6
members of management. This amounts to a whopping 10% of Greif's total 2014
GAAP net income. This does not set a good example for the other 13,319 employees
that Greif had at the end of 2014. Greif's management does not own a single stock
option. Does management not want to take a levered bet on the future success of its
"transformation strategy."
Eliminate or Cut the Dividend: Greif's dividend is an expensive luxury it should not
sustain at $98m/year. Greif is better off preserving liquidity in the hope that it can
change its fortunes. Last quarter Greif borrowed money from its bankers, stewards of
public capital, to pay a select group of 413 Class A and 102 Class B shareholders of
record as of Jan 9, 2015. This is not a sustainable strategy.
Take the "Big Bath": Greif has experienced horrendous results in its Rigid Industrial,
Packaging & Services business. As of the last quarter, year-over-year sales (ex:
divestitures and closures) plunged 6.4% and operating profit fell by 36%. Greif has
allocated $777m of goodwill to this segment. Greif's Flexible Products and Services
has performed even worse, with net sales (ex: divestitures) plunging 8.9% and
operating profit falling from $0.8m to -$8,8m. Greif carries an additional $152.6m of net
intangible assets. Greif has allocated $114.7m of these intangibles (75%) to "customer
relationships." However, Greif has never disclosed having long-term contractual

relationships with customers - so where exactly is the intangible asset value here?
Greif should consider an impairment test and taking a massive charge, so that it can
halt its streak of 14+ consecutive years of "one-time" charges.
Suspend Guidance or Fire Your Stock Analysts: Wall Street analysts have had a
frustrating time accurately forecasting Greif's quarterly sales or earnings, so either they
are terrible analysts and should drop coverage, or Greif has no visibility in its business
and should suspend the practice of giving guidance. According to Bloomberg, Greif
has missed earnings and sales estimate 77% and 66% of the time over the past nine
quarters, respectively. One analyst at BMO is even at the point of outright criticizing
Greif and appears to have lost confidence in the company. After Greif's last earnings,
the analyst said,


Weak results, uninspiring call. GEF faces multiple challenges; we're unconvinced on
their execution. This remains a troubled company.


Conclusion


Greif's share price is at a multi-year low, and we believe it will continue to decline as its
business struggles from a leveraged acquisition binge, a weakening euro, and from the
market's lost confidence in management's ability to effect a highly promoted
"transformational change." Instead of playing lip service that a new committee of Greif's
seasoned Directors will save the day, Spruce Point believes more drastic and decisive
action is necessary. We put forth six ideas Greif could take to clear the deck and show
investors that it is indeed serious about improving its situation.
