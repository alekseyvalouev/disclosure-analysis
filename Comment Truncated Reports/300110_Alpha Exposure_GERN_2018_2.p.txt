Summary


We believe imetelstat may have a patient that meets Hy’s Law, a concept that the
FDA uses to judge liver toxicity.


We believe having a patient meet Hy’s Law significantly increases the risk of another
clinical hold for imetelstat.


Geron's acknowledgement of patient deaths, the FDA's recent information request
on safety, and a center's suspension in the imetelstat trial, in our opinion, are too
much to ignore.


We believe imetelstat's safety profile may be too dangerous for the FDA.


We are short Geron.


In our previous article, we highlighted the numerous safety issues that have plagued
imetelstat and made investors aware of the risks that Geron's (GERN) imetelstat may
face, specifically the danger that the FDA implements another clinical hold.

In this article, we are highlighting a risk that we perceive: imetelstat may have a patient
that meets Hy's Law, which is a concept that the FDA uses to judge liver toxicity for drugs.
If this is true, it only serves to heighten the risk of the FDA issuing another clinical hold on
imetelstat. If this were to happen, we believe it would severely hinder imetelstat's future
prospects.


What is Hy's Law?



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/15/959452-15187366260807676_origin.jpg
According to Wikipedia, Hy's Law is a "rule of thumb that a patient is at high risk of a fatal
drug-induced liver injury (DILI) if given a medication that causes hepatocellular injury (not
cholestatic injury) with jaundice."


Also described on Wikipedia, there are three components to Hy's Law:


1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally defined as an elevated alanine
aminotransaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) by 3-fold or greater
above the upper limit of normal. Often with aminotransferases much greater (5-10x)
the upper limit of normal.


2. Among subjects showing such aminotransferase elevations, they also have elevation
of their serum total bilirubin of greater than 2× the upper limit of normal, without
findings of cholestasis (defined as serum alkaline phosphatase activity less than 2×
the upper limit of normal).


3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased
aminotransferase and serum total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse,
ischemia, preexisting liver disease, or another drug capable of causing the observed
injury.


A patient must meet all three components to fall under Hy's Law. The FDA states in this
guidance document (page 5), "Finding one Hy's Law case in the clinical trial database is
worrisome; finding two is considered highly predictive that the drug has the potential to
cause severe DILI when given to a larger population."

https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Guidances/UCM174090.pdf
We believe the FDA is especially sensitive to DILI because DILI is the "most frequent
single cause of safety-related drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years," (see
page 2, "BACKGROUND: DILI"). It's also a "major cause of drug failure in clinical trials,"
and "the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US." We believe it is clear that this is a
risk factor that the FDA does not take lightly.


Why we believe imetelstat may have at least one patient that meets
Hy's Law


In December 2017, Geron held an analyst event after the American Society of
Hematology (ASH) conference and published a presentation that included information
from the IMerge and IMbark trials that are being conducted by Janssen. On slide 47 of the
presentation, Geron released, what we thought was startling safety data from the IMerge
trial. We added the red underline to emphasize what we thought was most important.


We believe this slide indicates that imetelstat has at least one patient that meets two of
the three components of Hy's Law.


The first component states "the drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally defined as an
elevated ALT or AST by 3-fold or greater above the upper limit of normal." We can see
that in the second bullet point, GERN states that the IMerge trial had four patients with
grade 3 worsening of AST and/or ALT.


According to slide 107 in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (also known as Common Toxicity Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0: CTCAEv4), a grade 3 ALT/AST is characterized by levels
5x to 20x the upper limit of normal.


These four patients clearly meet the first component of Hy's Law, which is a 3-fold
increase in ALT or AST above the upper limit of normal.

The second bullet point in the Geron slide acknowledges that one of these four patients
with grade 3 AST/ALT also had grade 3 worsening of bilirubin. According to the CTCAEv4,
a grade 3 level of bilirubin is a 3x-10x level above the upper limit of normal. Again, this is
well above the 2 fold (or 2x) cutoff point for the second component of Hy's Law.


We also want to point out that Geron did not release the number of patients who had
grade 2 worsening of bilirubin. If these patients were in the upper end of the grade 2 range
of 1.5x-3.0x, they would still meet the second component of Hy's Law. As a result of the
information on slide 47, we have concluded that at least one of the IMerge patients
satisfied the first two components of Hy's Law.


Geron was quick to add that the adverse events for the four patients referenced in slide 47
were reversible. We acknowledge that this was a positive, but we believe this may just be
a silver lining in an overall gloomy situation. In our opinion, the main issue is the severe
toxicity of imetelstat. We also question how reversible these adverse events are since
GERN has indicated that the IMerge and IMbark trials have had patient deaths, which we
highlighted in our previous article.


As indicated above, the third component of Hy's Law is, "No other reason can be found to
explain the combination of increased aminotransferase and serum total bilirubin, such as
viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, ischemia, preexisting liver disease, or another drug capable
of causing the observed injury."


This is the component that's most subjective. We believe that viral hepatitis can be ruled
out because hepatitis is typically screened for at study entry. We also believe this is true
for bilirubin elevations caused by alcohol abuse, which typically occurs in patients with
alcoholic cirrhosis. We believe it is unlikely that Janssen would enroll cirrhotic patients in
their studies. As for other drugs, we believe that the patients in IMerge were likely on other

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/959452_15187327918612_rId16.png
drugs, but if these drugs are commonly prescribed by doctors, then the drugs likely won't
have issues with Hy's Law. Therefore, we can deduce that imetelstat, the new agent and a
known hepatotoxic drug, likely is behind the combination of elevated aminotransferase
and serum total bilirubin seen in the IMerge trial.


We believe imetelstat is at risk of receiving another clinical hold


If our analysis is correct, then imetelstat has at least one patient that meets Hy's Law,
which the FDA views as "worrisome." There may be additional Hy's Law cases if any of
the patients that experienced a grade 3 worsening of AST and/or ALT also had grade 2
levels of bilirubin. As previously described, slide 47 indicated that an elevation of bilirubin
greater than 2x the upper limit of normal is above the level that would trigger the second
component of Hy's Law. Furthermore, if our observations are correct, even more, patients
may be found to meet Hy's Law as the two imetelstat trials continue. We believe this
increases the risk of another clinical hold.


While Geron investors may not be as concerned about imetelstat's safety profile as we
are, we believe it's clear that the FDA is taking this seriously. As we pointed out in our
previous article, Geron has admitted that "safety issues, including deaths, have also been
observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge," and Geron acknowledged that the FDA has
sent Geron and Janssen an "information request" for "additional efficacy and safety data,
including deaths, justifying continued treatment of patients enrolled in IMbark." We believe
investors should not take this disclosure lightly.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4145052-geron-imetelstats-history-deaths-safety-issues
We also know that one of the centers in the IMerge study (the Levine Cancer Institute in
North Caroline) has suspended its participation in the IMerge trial. While it may simply be
coincidental, we think it may have to do with imetelstat's safety profile.


We are short Geron with a price target of $0.47


Putting this altogether, we believe imetelstat's safety profile is too dangerous for the FDA
to ignore. We believe imetelstat has at least one patient that meets Hy's Law and that it is
possible that more may be found as the imetelstat trials conducted by Janssen continue.
We believe the risks of another clinical hold by the FDA are high.


We are short Geron with a price target of $0.47 per share.
