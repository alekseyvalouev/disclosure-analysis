Alleged Off-Label Marketing, Patent Woes And Other Issues May Spell
Disaster For Avanir

We have published a more detailed report on Avanir Pharmaceuticals on September 11,
2013. A PDF version of the full 47-page report can be found at
gravityresearchgroup.com/reports.


Avanir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AVNR) is a pharmaceutical company currently
marketing one FDA-approved drug: Nuedexta. Nuedexta is a combination of two generic
drugs (dextromethorphan and quinidine) and is approved to treat Pseudobulbar Affect
(PBA), a condition that causes patients to experience bouts of uncontrollable laughing
and/or crying. We believe that AVNR stock will collapse in the near future due to the
perfect storm of overhanging potential negative events threatening its solvency, including
a sharp drop in future revenue and fines resulting from a potential illegal off-label
marketing investigation, steep declines in revenue and default on outstanding debt due to
loss of this week's patent case, and other events that may adversely affect AVNR's cash
flows in the near future.


1) We believe AVNR has engaged in illegal off-label marketing of Nuedexta and that
off-label prescriptions have generated a significant portion of AVNR's Nuedexta
revenue to date. We have collected strong evidence to support this conclusion, including
numerous documented allegations of and allusions to off-label marketing from purported
AVNR employees and recorded discussions we have held with former AVNR employees.
Below are selected comments in reference to the off-label marketing at AVNR (see the full
report for more):


"People are marketing off label for "Agitation" and "other behaviors." Many of us have
seen it first hand with LNAM [long-term care neuroscience area manager]
counterparts. It is a huge concern."
"…there is so much off label selling - it's dangerous. Reps will get caught...the
company will get caught...good luck...this company is teetering on the edge with one
foot in illegal waters and the other on a banana peel"
"[Y]ou will be encouraged to promote off label, you will be competing against reps who
have zero issue selling off label…"
"…practically EVERYONE is selling OFF-LABEL!"
"…we have a HUGE culture problem in LTC [long-term care] selling off-lab[el]."

We believe AVNR could face over $100mm in fines and penalties and see its
Nuedexta sales plummet following a potential government investigation. We
reached this figure through research of settlements, which appear to be based on both the
egregiousness of the off-label selling as well as the amount of revenue generated by the
drug. For example, Elan's $203mm settlement represented approximately 93% of the total
historical revenue it generated with the drug Zonegran. Cumulatively, AVNR has
generated over $100mm in gross revenue from sales of Nuedexta.


According to one of our sources, at the time he left AVNR, the off-label marketing of
Nuedexta at AVNR was not merely rogue sales representatives, but extended up the
chain and was driven by multiple regional sales directors, and at least one national sales
director. We believe that off-label marketing contributed to the mysteriously rapid
departure of AVNR's former Chief Commercial Officer who arrived soon after Nuedexta
was launched and who, as we confirmed with a source, became aware of the issue prior
to leaving the company after less than eight months.


Former employees of AVNR have told us that the actual pool of PBA patients in the US is
significantly lower than Management represents, making it difficult if not impossible to
reach sales targets without engaging in off-label marketing (we believe the pool of
marketable patients is at least 75% smaller than the 1.8mm figure quoted by
Management).* This situation is eerily similar to what happened at InterMune, where
AVNR's current CEO Keith Katkin was previously a Vice President of Marketing.
InterMune was found guilty of engaging in off-label marketing while Katkin worked there,
and former employees have testified in court that Katkin set sales goals for a drug so high
that the only way to attain those sales goals was through off-label marketing.  The fact
that AVNR has experienced extensive turnover in salespeople and 50%+ of Nuedexta pills
are being sold through long-term care facilities despite Management explicitly stating that
such facilities only constitute 5.6% of total PBA patients also served to heighten our
suspicions. There has been a recent rash of off-label marketing cases through long-term
care facilities in particular among other pharmaceutical companies, and based on our
research and discussions, we believe this is where the majority of off-label marketing of
Nuedexta is taking place


2) We believe that AVNR has a very high probability of losing its current patent
case, and as a result, will likely face an 80%+ decline in quarterly revenue by the
end of FY 2014 and default on its debt due to a clause which lists "[a] commercial
generic version of Nuedexta (for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect) becomes
available" as an event of default.

We believe the evidence presented in the court filings creates a clear-cut case in the
defense's favor, and a reverse payment ("pay-to-delay") settlement with Par
Pharmaceuticals (Par) is the only way AVNR could avoid a ruling invalidating its patents.
However, Par has a strong incentive not to accept such a settlement due to 1) the fact that
a favorable ruling in the case would lend itself to future cases for non-PBA indications
using quinidine/dextromethorphan combinations and 2) anti-trust concerns, which are
especially significant in light of the recent June 2013 Supreme Court ruling that reverse
payment settlements are subject to anti-trust scrutiny. Having reviewed thousands of
pages of court filings and academic/industry publications related to the case and patents
in question (relevant parts of which are posted on our website under Appendix X to the
report), we believe that AVNR would lose a ruling in the patent case. This would soon
trigger default on its debt due to a clause in AVNR's credit agreement that declares the
marketing of generic Nuedexta to be a default event.  While creditors always have the
option of allowing the company to continue with regularly-scheduled payments (typically at
a much higher interest rate), we believe that would not be feasible in this case because
we estimate that generic competition would wipe out AVNR's quarterly revenue from
Nuedexta by at least 80% by the end of FY 2014, magnifying AVNR's already-negative
operating cash flows.


The defense team for Par and its (former) co-defendants has produced firm evidence that
the "composition of matter" concept of combining dextromethorphan and quinidine, and
the "method of use" concept of using the resulting compound to treat PBA had both been
patented with priority dates before the priority date of AVNR's earliest relevant patent (see
US Patent Nos. 5,166,207 and 5,206,248),  and the impact of low doses of quinidine on
dextromethorphan plasma concentrations ("method of use") were documented in a 1999
abstract (the "Yakatan Abstract")5,6 that was published and made publicly available three
years prior to AVNR filing for the relevant patents. We believe the data from the Yakatan
Abstract in conjunction with the earlier patents makes all three of AVNR's patents invalid
due to obviousness based on prior art and/or double-patenting.


Below is our summary of AVNR's patent case, culled from thousands of pages of available
court filings from both the plaintiff and defense sides. We believe we present it in a fair and
concise way that allows for readers to reach their own objective conclusions. It leaves out
certain arguments from both sides that we consider to be frivolous. See Why We Believe
the Nuedexta Patents Won't Hold Up in Court for a more detailed discussion of the patent
case:


Plaintiff's Case

5/20/2018 Alleged Off-Label Marketing, Patent Woes And Other Issues May Spell Disaster For Avanir - Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc (NASDAQ:AVN…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 4/30


• AVNR have three patents covering its drug Nuedexta (which contains 20 mg of
dextromethorphan and 10 mg of quinidine per pill): the '115 patent, the '242 patent, and
the '484 patent. By filing ANDAs and paragraph IV certifications, the defendants are
violating all three of them. The relevant claims from the '115 patent are "composition of
matter" claims covering the dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, and the relevant
claims from the '242 and '484 patents are "method of use" claims covering the use of
specific ratios of dextromethorphan and quinidine ("1:0.5 or less" and "1:0.75 or less",
respectively) and ranges of doses for dextromethorphan and quinidine ('242 patent: 20
mg/day to 80 mg/day of dextromethorphan and 10 to 30 mg/day of quinidine; '484 patent:
20 mg/day to 60 mg/day of dextromethorphan and 10 to 30 mg/day of quinidine)


Defense's Case


• The relevant claims from all three of the Plaintiff's patents are invalid and/or inapplicable
in the case


• The '115 patent has a priority date of June 9, 1992. The asserted "composition of matter"
claims of the '115 patent covering the combination of dextromethorphan with quinidine to
augment the impact of dextromethorphan are invalid due to double-patenting-those same
composition of matter claims were previously claimed through US Patent No. 5,166,207
(the '207 patent)  which has a June 17, 1991 priority date, and US Patent No. 5,206,248
(the '248 patent), which has a March 27, 1992 priority date. Claims other than composition
of matter are irrelevant to the case because the patent specifically addresses indications
other than PBA (specifically "chronic or intractable pain, for treating tinnitus and for
treating sexual dysfunction"), which is why it was granted by the patent office in the first
place given the other two patents had already been filed and approved


• The '242 and '484 patents, which both carry a priority date of July 17, 2002 and cover the
treatment of PBA with a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine, are differentiated
from the prior '248 patent (which also covers the treatment of PBA with a combination of
dextromethorphan and quinidine) purely due to their dosing claims. The '248 patent does
not specify dosing in its claims, and the '242 and '484 patents claim doses that are low
relative to the doses used in cases cited by the '248 patent. However, a 1999 publication
(the "Yakatan Abstract") 8,9 in conjunction with the '248 patent demonstrated clearly that
doses of quinidine/dextromethorphan within the ranges claimed by the '242 and '484
would have been obvious for the purposes of treating PBA.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 5/30


It is true that the Yakatan Abstract was published by AVNR employees, however, the
waiver that prevents publications by inventors from being considered prior art only applies
if the publication was made within a year of the priority date of the patent-in this case, the
Yakatan Abstract was published three years before the priority dates of the relevant
patents. The Yakatan Abstract showed that 2.5 mg of quinidine combined with 30 mg of
dextromethorphan would produce peak blood concentration of 42.75 ng/mL, while 25 mg
of quinidine produced a peak blood concentration of 96.9 ng/mL (both calculated solely
based off of figures given in the Yakatan Abstract). It also stated that the same level of
blood concentration was observed with both 50 mg of quinidine and 75 mg of quinidine,
and 25 mg of quinidine yielded 85% of the plasma concentration levels of 50 mg,
indicating that 25 mg of quinidine yielded close to the maximum effect in terms of
dextromethorphan inhibition, making it obvious that doses higher than 25 mg would not be
significantly beneficial to patients. Meanwhile, the '248 patent includes three examples of
patients for whom a combination of DM and Q treated emotional lability. Example 2
describes a patient successfully treated for PBA, whose DM blood plasma concentrations
"usually averaged between 43 and 55 nanograms per milliliter." 42.75 ng/mL, the peak
blood concentration generated by 2.5 mg of quinidine per the Yakatan Abstract, is nearly
within the range shown to be effective in treating patients in the '248 patent. Therefore, the
combination of these pieces of prior art demonstrate that very low doses of
quinidine/dextromethorphan well within the ranges claimed by the '242 and '484 patents
would have been sufficient to treat PBA three years in advance of the priority dates of the
'242 and '484 patents.


Plaintiff's Rebuttal


• The '207 and '248 patents do not make the composition of matter element of the '115
patent obvious because they do not list specific doses of dextromethorphan and quinidine
under their claims, while the '115 specifically claims doses of quinidine of "300
milligrams/day or less"


• The '242 and '484 patents are valid because the Yakatan Abstract and '248 patent are
not sufficient to claim obviousness. Focusing on Example 2 of the '248 patent amounts to
cherry-picking, and it is unreasonable to think that someone skilled in the art would have
motivation to reach a similar conclusion based on the prior art presented


Defense's Rebuttal
5/20/2018 Alleged Off-Label Marketing, Patent Woes And Other Issues May Spell Disaster For Avanir - Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc (NASDAQ:AVN…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 6/30


• While 300 milligrams or less of quinidine is not explicitly listed under the claims of the
'207 and '248 patents, it is obvious based on the descriptions of the '248 and '207 patents.
They specifically included the results of trials done using 150 mg and 300 mg doses of
quinidine


• Focusing on Example 2 of the '248 patent is not cherry-picking-only two of the three
available examples provided blood plasma concentrations, and based on severe negative
side effects of overdosing, there was clear incentive to find the lowest effective dose.
Example 1 of the '248 patent does not provide the patient's blood plasma concentrations,
while Example 3 described a patient successfully treated for PBA with DM blood
concentrations that "usually averaged between 130 and 180 ng/ml". There is clear
motivation to find the lowest effective dose that could be used to treat patients because
the reaction can be severe in the event of an overdose, as was noted in the description of
the '248 patent:


"Dextromethorphan is believed to act at the phencyclidine (NYSE:PCP) binding site,
which is part of the NMDA receptor complex…One patient suffered a severe adverse
reaction at the 30 mg/day dosage of DM, when quinidine was co-administered. He
had not previously suffered any adverse reaction when DM alone was administered.
His reaction, which lasted several days, was similar to the hallucinatory and
psychotic reactions that are often observed in people who illegally abuse the drug
phencyclidine (also known as PCP or "angel dust")."


Combining the learnings of the '248 patent with the Yakatan Abstract, it is obvious that
doses well within the ranges claimed by AVNR in the '242 and '484 patents would have
been sufficient to treat PBA. Therefore, the patents are invalid because they are obvious
based on prior art.


We believe that the recent settlements are irrelevant, and the case that matters is the one
between AVNR and Par Pharmaceuticals, which was first to file its ANDA. Generic
companies that are first to file generally foot the vast majority of the legal bills in exchange
for a period of 180 day exclusivity, after which other generic competitors are permitted to
enter. We believe that the aftermath of AVNR losing the patent case spells certain
bankruptcy or dilution to pennies per share for investors in the near future


3) Other imminent events will negatively impact AVNR's cash flows and further
endanger AVNR's vulnerable cash position. After including the impact of the agreement
with OptiNose, AVNR's cash balance as of the end of the last quarter stood at $35mm,
with $30mm in debt. With consistent negative operating cash flows at $10mm+, debt

beginning to mature in 2014 at the rate of $3mm/quarter, approximately $1mm/quarter in
revenue from its docosanol ("Abreva") license disappearing next year due to the terms of
the license agreement, and increased costs of $2-3mm/quarter over the coming quarters
due to the OptiNose deal, we do not see how AVNR can survive through the next 12
months without significant equity offerings to shore up its balance sheet. Based on the
current price, even ignoring the entrance of generic competition and the off-label
marketing allegations, we believe these events have not been properly accounted for by
investors.


________________________________________________________________


AVNR also faces two other major issues in selling Nuedexta that we believe have largely
been overlooked by analysts and investors: lack of marketability for drugs to treat PBA
due to the nature of PBA as a relatively non-threatening symptom rather than a condition
in and of itself (in fact, because PBA is generally not even considered to be a disease, the
phrase "pseudobulbar affect" is not even consistently used to describe the condition-it is
also called pathological laughing and crying, emotional lability, emotional incontinence,
involuntary emotional expression disorder, emotionalism, and numerous other names),
and competition from antidepressants (which have been clinically shown to treat PBA,
and we believe, based on published data, are superior to Nuedexta in terms of efficacy,
cost, efficiency, and safety). At the same time, we believe that AVNR's pipeline will provide
no relief for investors-instead, it will likely accelerate AVNR's financial distress by
increasing R&D costs as well as requiring milestone payments to OptiNose and Concert
Pharmaceuticals:


I. AVNR has admitted that it does not have sufficient capital to independently fund Phase 3
trials for the DPN pain indication within its dextromethorphan/quinidine pipeline, and it
should be obvious to investors based on AVNR's financial profile. Given that DPN pain is
the most advanced indication in its pipeline, it is unreasonable to think that AVNR has
sufficient capital to fully fund any other Nuedexta-related indications


II. AVP-825 (sumatriptan delivered via a dry powder nasal spray to treat migraines) is the
only drug in AVNR's pipeline that is remotely close to FDA approval, and we believe it will
be virtually unmarketable-in terms of efficacy, it is dominated by competitors (among the
five triptan competitors we compared it with, AVP-825 showed the lowest therapeutic
benefit for patients in its clinical results!10,11) and on top of that, it requires patients to
blow air through their mouth to push dry powder through one nostril and out the other.
Further, the triptan market is set up in a way that gives an enormous advantage to the
cheapest options. While insurance companies will technically cover all available triptan

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1687632-alleged-off-label-marketing-patent-woes-and-other-issues-may-spell-disaster-for-avanir 8/30


deliveries, we found that they frequently restrict the number of doses patients are allowed
to purchase for more expensive delivery systems (such as nasal and subcutaneous
delivery). As a result, tablets command over 95% of the triptan market, despite being the
slowest-acting and requiring the highest drug exposures! We believe that this, combined
with the uncomfortable administration method, will severely restrict the market share for
AVP-825


III. While AVP-786 (deuterated dextromethorphan combined with quinidine to produce
similar efficacy to Nuedexta with lower levels of quinidine) would have a lower dose of
quinidine than Nuedexta, we believe it will present no significant advantage over
Nuedexta/generic Nuedexta. Doctors would prescribe antidepressants to PBA patients for
whom quinidine presents a risk. The primary risk for prescribing Nuedexta is that quinidine
inhibits metabolism of many drugs, including dextromethorphan, antipsychotics,
antidepressants, and other drugs that are commonly taken by the type of patients most
prone to PBA. It has been shown that even at 2.5 mg, quinidine can produce a 15x
increase in plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan compared to patients taking the
same dose of dextromethorphan by itself, with the potential for similar effects when
combining quinidine with other drugs. Most drug-drug combinations with quinidine other
than dextromethorphan have not been tested, leaving a huge question regarding the
safety for patients taking multiple drugs that would be impacted by the quinidine inhibition.
We believe that, AVP-786 would only be able to reduce the quinidine dose to 5 mg, at
best. As a result, we believe AVP-786 will have no advantage in selling over generic
Nuedexta and represents a gimmick rather than a true advance in therapy


[*] Based on our research, discussions with medical professionals, and discussions with
ex-employees, we believe the total pool of marketable PBA patients is at least 75%
smaller than Management currently claims. Numerous articles have been published citing
a "CNS Scale" in estimating seven figure PBA patient populations, but unbeknownst to
many investors, CNS stands for Center for Neurologic Study and is an organization that
stands to benefit financially from any success AVNR has in selling Nuedexta due to an
agreement granting CNS royalties on Nuedexta revenue. We believe this has led to
perverted "estimates". In December 2008, Management estimated the US population at
roughly half of what Management is projecting to investors today ("likely over one million").
The next year, Management increased its estimate to "an estimated two million patients in
the U.S."
