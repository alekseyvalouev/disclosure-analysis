Yet Another PGWC Fraud-


Laden Shareholder


A July 25, 2006 Form 144 �ling reported a planned sale of


10,000 shares of Pegasus Wireless Corporation (NASDAQ:


PGWC $5.30) by Wire To Wire, Inc (“Wire”). In 1999, Wire was


implicated in, and subsequently Wire’s former o�cers were


found liable for fraud in a Wire-related entity, in a civil case


brought forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission


(“SEC”).


On September 28, 1999, the SEC �led a complaint against


Gerald H. Levine, Marie A. Levine, and CEC Industries


Corporation (“CEC”). The complaint charged the Levines and


CEC with fraud violation, falsifying books and records, and


accounting violations during �scal years ending on March 31,


1996 and March 31, 1997.


SEC �lings during that time period list Gerald Levine as


President, Chief Executive O�cer, and Director of both CEC


and Wire. During the same time period SEC �lings list Marie


Levine as CEC’s Principle Financial O�cer, Principle


Accounting O�cer, Director of CEC and Secretary and


Director of Wire.


The SEC alleged that the Levines, acting through “another


corporate entity, Wire to Wire, Inc.,” which served as a selling


shareholder, defrauded investors by pro�ting from the sale

of CEC stock while knowingly overstating CEC’s assets. The


SEC complaint contended that the Levines were directly


responsible for the fraud.


According to the SEC’s Litigation Release No. 18420, CEC’s


stock price was in�ated by the fraudulent overstatement of a


9,000-acre tract of land in Tennessee that the Levines


claimed held 52 million tons of coal and timber, and forty-


one paintings by “Sky Jones” that the Levines stated were


valued at $1.7 million. During the trial the SEC proved that


neither CEC, nor any CEC a�liate owned the land, and that


the paintings were worth “no more than $10,350.”


CEC settled the SEC’s �nancial fraud charges without


admitting or denying the allegations, and on September 11,


2001 accepted a permanent injunction barring CEC from


violating certain antifraud, record-keeping and internal


control provisions. Subsequent to an acquisition in August


2004, CEC changed its name to Advantage Capital


Development Corp. (OTHER OTC: AVCP $0.01). On October


16, 2003, Gerald and Marie Levine were found liable for


�nancial fraud by a jury in the US District Court of the District


of Columbia (“D.C.”).


The SEC is seeking civil penalties, bars permanently


prohibiting Gerald and Marie Levine from serving as o�cers


or directors of any public company, and permanent


injunctions against future violations of the securities laws, in


the matter. The hearing on remedies and damages is set for


September 15, 2006, according to the D.C. District Court.


Records of Experian, a business information �rm that


provides consumer credit ratings, list the same Henderson,


Nevada address for Wire as for CEC, and for another public


company, a penny-stock formerly known as OTS Holdings,


Inc (OTC BB: OKME $0.129), of which Gerald Levine was also


an o�cer.

Yet another company, Worldwide Golf Resources, Inc.


(“Golf”), lists the same address for its executive o�ces and


contact address for its o�cers, Gerald and Marie Levine, in


its SEC �lings. Golf was deemed ineligible for trading, as of


November 30, 1999, on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board


for failing to meet compliance requirements.


Gerald and Marie Levine are just the latest piece in the


puzzle of fraud and deception surrounding PGWC, joining


the company of feloneous attorney Donald Mintmire and


accused Taiwanese embezzler Hung Chiu-Hu.
