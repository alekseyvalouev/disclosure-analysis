Avanir - Closing Short Position

I recommended shorting Avanir at $4.62 on 5/31/2011. Friday, 11/25/2011, the shares
closed at $2.00, or -57%. This is annualized return of 146%. Even if shorting Avanir was a
small position in your portfolio, you would be having a good year on this trade alone.
Congratulations if you joined me in shorting.


Avanir is not a compelling long just because I am no longer short. When I invest, I am
acutely focused on the return profile of the proposed investment. Quite simply, I have to
have some idea of what the return profile is, and the risks associated with that profile.
Funding of the trade is relevant as well -- most of you don't operate insurance companies
or other businesses that bring in cash. Don't mistake the ways others invest for things that
you should do unless you fully understand their "setup".


One silly myth I'd like to dispel is that it's difficult to make large returns shorting stocks like
Avanir. The 146% annualized return generated in this trade is a building block to some of
the best returns you can get in the market today.


I'm not here for page views. I'm here to make readers money. Why? I have my reasons -
suffice it to say, it does not involve manipulating your thinking. A sucker is born every
minute, and the supply of people who want to get rich quick will never dry. One person
could never combat these waves of ignorance.
