HARBIN ELECTRIC: LOAN
FRAUD AND THE DOCS TO
PROVE IT


If you haven’t yet figured out that there is rampant
fraud amongst many Chinese stocks (mainly
RTO’s), you obviously live in a “financial cave”. 
The story has become so mainstream in China and
the United States that it is actually featured in this
week’s Time Magazine.

Citron Research, the source that exposed Longtop
Financial (NYSE:LFT) and the first to write on
China MediaExpress (NASDAQ:CCME), now
exposes the fraud behind Harbin Electric
(NASDAQ:HRBN).


   Background 


In its last reports on Harbin Electric, Citron has
shown that:


1. the company is potentially lying on their SEC
filings, as their SAIC filings document higher
liabilities and significantly lower profits than
they report to the SEC.

2. in the second report we described how
preposterous the proposed buyout financing
actually is:

[http://citronresearch.com/index.php/2011

   Good Night … 


It is Citron’s opinion that it is now time for the SEC
to halt this security.


The future of Harbin’s stock price is currently
propped on the crutch of a purported $24 buyout
offer from its Chairman / CEO, which Citron
believes is a sham.  With time stretching seven
months since first proposed, we still have no
binding, official takeover bid filed in an 8-K, just a
few press releases, and now the boilerplate
document of a purported supporting loan that
seems half baked, as discussed in the last report. 
These filings are always tagged with the company
disclaimer:


“There can be no assurance that any
definitive agreement will be executed with
respect to this proposal or that this or any
other transaction will be approved or
consummated.”


 


Yet, through reliable sources Citron has just
obtained documentation that


 The Harbin Chairman/CEO Has A
History of Fraudulent Loan
Guarantee Documents!

Citron Research has obtained a settlement
agreement reached between Harbin CEO Tianfu
Yang and China Construction Import Export Corp. 
In 2004, Mr. Yang along with his brother, fellow
Harbin board member Harbin Vice President,
(corrected per  
http://www.harbinelectric.com/management.html


[http://www.harbinelectric.com/management.html]


 
[http://www.harbinelectric.com/management.html]
) Tianli Yang, fraudulently obtained the official seal
of China Construction Import Export Corp. (CCIE)
to guarantee a loan for Tinafu Yang’s company.


In the settlement agreement with CCIE, Tianfu
Yang admitted guilt in order to get CCIE to agree
to drop criminal proceedings in the matter. 


(Citron has gone to great length to verify the
authenticity of these documents, and will publish
any challenge or correction that can reliably
demonstrate that they are not authentic.)  Here
they are for your viewing pleasure.

Citron recalls vividly how vociferously Longtop
officials decried as “unfair” and “irrelevant” when
Citron’s published references to a lawsuit,
documenting prior misconduct of the Chairman of
Longtop.  Similarly, this document goes directly to
management’s credibility and trustworthiness. 
And since Harbin’s buyout valuation rests solely on
the credibility of the Chairman and his offer, this
should be the end of the road for the Harbin
charade.


Citron wonders how this disturbing legal baggage
will reflect on Chairman Yang creditworthiness to
his bank or any other bank evaluating this deal.


Citron asks:  Why all this effort to keep
people’s attention off the underlying
business?


 


Citron believes that, absent this sham buyout offer,
shareholders are holding a company that is a
potential 0….yes a 0, as in donut.
 We believe the company has undisclosed
liabilities, as we have seen with companies such as
Longtop Financial.  Also, even with its limited
disclosures, Harbin as a company is far too
dependent on lending to support a business with
heavy capex burdens, slimming margins, and
decreasing revenue.


 


So now we are supposed to believe that a
company, run by a gentleman with a disturbing
history of loan misrepresentation, is actually
obtaining a signature loan for $400 million, to buy

out the publicly held shares at a 40% premium? 
And this transaction is going ahead in a market
environment so rife with skepticism about Chinese
stocks and skittish about economic concerns that
no Chinese company has sold a bond in the high
yield market since May 26?

[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/16/us-
markets-stocks-adrs-idUSTRE75E6BF20110616]


And this transaction is predicated on the numbers
filed by the most notorious discredited auditor in
the China space? 


And who is the purported lender bank?  China
Development Bank – a bank who has become too
familiar with China stock fraud.  They are the
lender for the recently decimated Sino-Forest:

Mar-2011+PRN20110323]


Ask yourself if a little professional skepticism isn't
warranted here. 


   The curious case of Harbin’s 2010
bank loan 
Citron believes that in reality Harbin is a money pit
with hidden liabilities that are consuming its cash. 


Only a month after the original “takeover
announcement”, over six months ago, Harbin’s
Chairman executed a $50 million dollar bank loan
for the company, collateralized by his personal
stock holdings, worth more than double the loan
amount at the time. 


We ask one simple question.  Why?  If you really
have $55 million in the bank, earning less than 1%
interest, would you borrow $50 million at 8%
interest if you don’t desperately need the money?


Clearly its an expensive transaction – the company
is paying $1.9 million interest quarterly to service

http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-loan-fraud-and-the-docs-to-prove-it/ 6/8


the loan (at 8%), while earning less than $200,000
interest on its free cash balances.  And according
to more recent filings, they've never used the
money.  It supposedly just sits in their bank
account.  (Sorry to be so damn obvious.)


Regardless of what the reason is, it bodes poorly
for a company that expects to get financing to go
private for a 70% premium to market. 


 


  Not Only Does Citron Not Believe
Harbin…but neither does Wall
Street. 
 


It is not only Citron that doesn’t believe the
takeover but obviously Wall Street doesn’t either. 


Here is a typical Wall Street risk/arb spreadsheet,
showing the difference between the current market
price and the proposed takeover price for dozens
of deals in process.

[https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/citronresearch.com/p
hl=en&hl=en&key=0AkR3if0ljyredEZ4N2RFSzVzQVF3QW5


 


Note that these stocks all trade within a few
percent of the proposed  takeover price.  Yet
Harbin has never traded higher than the range of
50% to 70% of its takeover price. 


 


To illustrate a final point we’ve made previously
about the China space, there’s a tremendous
vulnerability for US investors who assume  “a stock
is a stock is a stock” if it trades on the Nasdaq or
the NYSE. 


Investors are going to face “mission impossible”
when trying to avail themselves of the customary
legal protections they assume are available to
shareholders, for companies domiciled in China.

Here’s a news story about one of the early civil
shareholder suits, which can’t even get papers
served on defendants domiciled in China.  Buyer
beware!

   Conclusion 


 


For those of you who do not read Citron, yesterday
another China coverage stock was halted:  China-
Biotics  (NASDAQ:CHBT) …. How long until Harbin
faces the same fate?


Citron has hundreds of pages of SAIC documents –
the in-country filings of Harbin’s subsidiaries over
the years.  These documents do not even remotely
resemble the company that Harbin portrays to US
investors in its SEC filings. 


But needless to say, we think no bank in China or
anywhere else would dream of relying on Harbin’s
SEC filings, generated by a disgraced auditor, as a
basis providing hundreds of millions of dollars in
high-risk financing to fund a huge premium to pay
off US investors.


Citron sees no reason to drown readers in
paperwork to prove a fraud that is too obvious.  If
need be, we will continue to publish information on
a timely basis that we find is relevant to investors.


 


Cautious investing to all.
