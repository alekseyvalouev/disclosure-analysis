Summary

TCMD


Tactile claims to be a dominant player in an extremely underpenetrated market with
$5bn TAM growing at 20-30% annually. We think the true TAM is closer to $300mm.


We address the likely true source of Tactile's growth: a kickback arrangement, we
believe, is resulting in rampant over-prescribing. Payers, including the VA, are
cracking down and cutting reimbursement to Tactile.


Medicare has launched an audit, and data reveals Tactile has been found non-
compliant on 71% of its claims. We believe management has made no mention of
these audits to investors.


Since 2017, Tactile has seen multiple key departures: CFO, Chief Medical Officer,
SVP of Reimbursement & Payer Relations, VP of Reimbursement, and VP of
Quality & Regulatory Affairs, and CEO.


Strong Sell with 70% ($15 PT) downside: Payers are cracking down, and insiders
are jumping ship.

Numerous publicly available studies and claims databases suggest the
addressable market for advanced Pneumatic Compression Devices (PCDs) is
$300mm, and not $5bn as management claims. In fact, Medicare has covered
PCDs since 1986.


We believe the true source of Tactile's (NASDAQ:TCMD) growth is a kick-back
arrangement that we believe has resulted in rampant overprescribing at the
expense of patients, insurers, and the public.


We believe these activities are coming to an end. Medicare has recently launched
an industry-wide audit, and Tactile has been disproportionately targeted. 71% of
Tactile’s claims audited so far have been denied for failure to establish
medical necessity. We have found no mention of these audits by management to
investors.


Regulators have cracked down before – in 1995, the OIG launched an investigation
into lymphedema pump fraud and abuse. By 1996, reimbursements had fallen by
92%.


Changes to 10K disclosures may be foreshadowing some of the legal and
regulatory risks for the company.


Since 2017, Tactile has seen multiple key departures: CFO, CMO, SVP Payer
Relations, VP Reimbursement, and VP Regulatory Affairs. CEO Jerry Mattys is
stepping down on June 8  this year.th


Insiders, including the CEO, COO, and VP of Sales, have sold more than 50% of

Company Overview


Why Tactile’s TAM Estimates Are Overstated By Over 15x


audits were launched.


Tactile Systems Technology Inc. is a manufacturer of Pneumatic Compression Devices
(PCD) for patients diagnosed with lymphedema in the United States.


Example of Flexitouch device


PCDs used for the treatment of lymphedema are split between two classifications:
“standard/basic” devices (HCPCS code E0651) and “advanced” devices (E0652). Basic
devices have ASPs ranging from $400 to $1,000, while advanced devices generally go
for $4,000+.


~90% of Tactile’s revenue comes from its advanced PCD product called Flexitouch. The
remaining 10% in revenue is derived from its basic PCD under the Entrée brand.


Since its IPO, management has presented a carefully crafted bull narrative for investors:


Growing, $5bn TAM: According to management, 1.3mm new patients were
diagnosed with lymphedema in the last 12 months. At the Flexitouch ASP of
~$4,000, this implies a $5bn+ TAM.


Severely Underpenetrated with Significant White Space


Consistent 20-30% Grower

TAM Part 1: The True Rate Of Lymphedema Is Lower Than
Management Claims


While Tactile publicly touts a $5bn+ market opportunity, analysis of claims data,
published medical studies, and state coverage mandate disclosures suggest the true
TAM for the Flexitouch product is only ~$300mm.


The true addressable market for Flexitouch is significantly lower for two reasons:


The incidence rate of lymphedema is much lower than management claims, and1.


Only a fraction of lymphedema patients are eligible for advanced PCDs from both a
medical and a reimbursement perspective.


2.


The addressable market can be looked at in two ways: incidence (diagnoses per year)
and prevalence (total cumulative patients).


Incidence:


While Tactile claims there are 1.3mm lymphedema diagnoses p.a., the true figure is
likely between 300,000 and 500,000 – a third of management’s estimate.

Source (1) Feb-19 – Health & Economic Benefits of APCD Study (linked): A Tactile-
funded study analyzing claims data to determine economic and clinical outcomes
following Flexitouch usage. The study analyzes the Blue Health Intelligence (BHI)
research database covering >165mm members of individual Blue Cross Blue Shield
plans from across the US. Notably, Tactile has been using BHI for claims data since
2018.


During the period studied (2012 – 2016), 81,366 patients were found to have been
diagnosed with non-filarial lymphedema, defined as ≥1 inpatient or 2 outpatient claims
with the relevant ICD codes. 81,366 diagnoses out of the 165mm covered population
imply a 0.05% incidence rate. Note that the 81,366 figure is over four years, so the
annual incidence would be even lower.

Tactile’s then Chief Medical Officer Alan Hirsch was a co-author of this study. The study

Study measured prevalence of lymphedema related to cancer patients, not total
population. NOTE that the study measures prevalence of lymphedema in cancer
patients, and therefore calculates prevalence based on 1,188,860 population size of
cancer patients. We took the numerator (14,775) against the total database size of
34mm instead.


The study provides the number of diagnoses per year, defined as one or more medical
claims with the relevant ICD codes. In the most recent year, 2013, the study found
14,775 patients diagnosed with lymphedema out of 34mm. This figure suggests an
incidence rate of ~0.04% or ~140,000 total US diagnoses per year. Note that this study
focuses primarily on cancer-related lymphedema (which represents the majority of
lymphedema cases in the US). All cases of lymphedema would be higher but not
significantly so. In the California case study below, claims data found that total
lymphedema was about ~2x the number of breast cancer related lymphedema. This is
for just one type of cancer. To get to management's figures, one would need to adjust
the incidence rate by ~10x.


Prevalence:


A second way to look at the market size is how many total patients suffer from
lymphedema at any given point in time. Management estimates this figure to be
between 5 and 10 million patients. Research suggests the true figure is closer to 2
million - a fourth of management’s estimate.

TAM Part 2: Only A Fraction Of Lymphedema Patients Are
Treated With And Eligible For Advanced PCD


The bottom line: Multiple external, 3  party sources - including those used by the
company itself - suggest that Tactile’s lymphedema diagnoses statistics are significantly
overstated. The real figure is likely to approximate 300,000 to 500,000 diagnosed
patients per year.


rd


Alternative methodology: We attended a large industry conference and spoke with a
senior member of one of the largest lymphedema education centers in the US. On our
conversation regarding the patient population of lymphedema in the US, she offered a
different perspective that we lay out here: There are approximately 5,000 lymphedema
therapists nationwide of which ~20% are lymphedema-only. On average, therapists treat
~50-60 patients per year. 5,000 therapists × 60 patients = ~300,000 patients per year.


PCDs (and especially advanced PCDs) are not the first line of treatment for
lymphedema. Research suggests less than 15% of lymphedema patients are ultimately
treated with advanced PCDs.


PCDs are considered a treatment of last resort by both practitioners and payers. For
diagnosed patients, Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is the universally accepted
method of treatment: “Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is the gold standard for
lymphedema management.” (Lymphcare USA, link)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352249-strong-sell-on-tactile-systems-bloated-stock-needs-compression-therapy?source=all_articles_title 9/32


Therefore, PCDs are reserved for patients for which CDT was ineffective or not
practical. To be eligible for a basic PCD, both public and commercial payers require
medical documentation demonstrating compliance to a 4+ week course of CDT that was
insufficient in reducing symptoms.


Advanced PCDs require further proof that a 1-to-3-month course of basic PCD
treatment was similarly insufficient. Medicare and most payers do not recognize clinical
differences between basic and advanced devices. Below is an excerpt from Anthem’s
coverage documentation:


The typical treatment funnel of lymphedema patient that eventually receives an
advanced PCD looks something like this:


Source: OSS Research


Studies suggest only ~30% of patients receive PCDs, of which 60% receive
advanced PCDs:


Source (1) Feb-19 – Health & Economic Benefits of APCD Study (linked): The Feb-
19 study using BHI data narrowed down to a ~1,065 population that were pursuing
continuous lymphedema treatment. Of these patients, 34 used basic PCD only, and
171 patients were on advanced PCDs (roughly half of which were Flexitouch). This
would imply ~20% of patients receive a PCD, and about ~83% of these PCD
patients eventually go on to receive advanced PCD.

Source (2) Dec-14 – Lymphedema Prevalence & Treatment Benefits in Cancer
Study: In the 2014 study (2), the claims data indicate that between 2008 and 2012,
21,104 patients made claims for either a basic or advanced PCD. During this same
period, the claims data found a total of 59,812 lymphedema diagnoses, or a PCD
treatment penetration rate of ~35%. This 59,812 figure was done by adding the
lymphedema diagnoses measured in each year as stated in the report (second
screenshot below).


Definitive Healthcare data can be purchased from their website: link


Definitive Healthcare Data: Definitive Healthcare manages a claims database
covering ~210mm patients. For the CY2019 period, Definitive’s database found
~57,500 PCD claims out of a 210mm insured base, suggesting a PCD incidence
rate of ~0.03%. Extrapolating to the total US population implies a market size of
~87,600 PCD units per year. This compares to a total of 53,000 Flexitouch and
Entrée devices shipped during the same period - a market saturation rate of over
59%.


Of the PCD claims in CY2019 Definitive's database, 28,838 were for advanced
devices under the HCPCS code E0652. This suggests ~50% of PCD patients
receive advanced PCDs. Recall that E0651 represents the HCPC code for basic
PCDs, and E0652 represents advanced PCDs.

TAM Part 3: Putting It All Together


Source: link


400,000 patients p.a. × 30% PCD usage × 60% advanced PCD share = 72,000 advanced PCDs shipped p.a.


72,000 advanced PCDs × $4,000 Flexitouch ASP = $288mm revenue opportunity for Flexitouch


This compares to management’s estimate of a $5bn market opportunity.


This also compares to existing Flexitouch revenue of ~$170mm as of FY2019.


Medicare has covered PCDs since 1986. The market is not as under-penetrated as
the company claims.


So, how has Tactile been able to grow at 20-30% without TAM and market saturation
constraints?

A Deep Dive Into Tactile’s Marketing Strategy


A recent Qui Tam lawsuit alleges Tactile is employing highly aggressive
marketing arrangements to induce sales growth and share gains. This lawsuit
was followed by a sharp decline in VA sales as well as a Medicare audit that has
disproportionately targeted Tactile.


On August 20, 2018, a Houston-based competitor Veterans First Medical Supply
(VFMS) filed a Qui Tam civil suit against Tactile. Qui Tam suits are filed on behalf of the
US Attorney General and the typical legal route for whistleblowers to expose fraud,
particularly as it relates to healthcare and public payer reimbursement.


Central to the lawsuit is its allegation of Tactile’s use of unlawful financial incentives and
marketing strategy to induce sales and share gains. A copy of the complaint can be
found on Pacer as Case 4:18-cv-02871. Essentially, the plaintiff claims that Tactile has a
group of "contractors" that it hires to deliver and train patients on the use of Flexitouch
devices. It turns out that these contractors are actually clinicians and therapists that are
critical in the decision making process for prescribing these devices. These contractors
are paid $150 + gas per session. To put that in context, these therapists only receive
~$30-40 an hour for a typical a therapy session with patients.

Source: Case 4:18-cv-02871, Qui Tam Lawsuit, VFMS v Tactile


Based on Tactile's rebuttal in the court case as well as conversations with sell-side
analysts, we have heard the following arguments for why this lawsuit should be
dismissed by investors:


VFMS is a disgruntled competitor.


Contractor nurses and therapists have contractual relationships with Tactile – they
are not allowed to train patients from any facilities that they are affiliated with.


Nurses and therapists do not sign prescriptions – this is the responsibility of
physicians. This means they are removed from the decision making on PCD
treatment for patients.


However, Tactile appears to be downplaying what we think is actually a ‘daisy-chaining’
kickback arrangement.


The diagram above from OSS Research illustrates a simplified version of the indirect
kickback arrangement.


Tactile’s contract training program is not as innocent as the company claims for two key
reasons:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/5/25/51561951-15904175903233385_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352249-strong-sell-on-tactile-systems-bloated-stock-needs-compression-therapy?source=all_articles_title 14/32


Nurses & Therapists are Key Decision Makers: Unique to the lymphedema industry,
diagnoses are made by physicians, but treatment decision making is commonly
made by nurses and therapists. This suggests Tactile is offering financial
rewards directly to key decision makers that recommend their product to
patients.


“It's kind of strange over here. So if you have lymphedema, you go to your GP which
is the prescriber a lot of times over here. But they're sending patients out for
lymphedema treatment, and then whatever treatment protocols the lymphedema
therapist or nurse draws up, the prescriber just signs off on it.”


– Senior Executive, DME Distributor, emphasis added


Quid Pro Quo Dynamics for Participants: Older SEC filings from the company
indicate that trainers are actually identified by the company’s sales and marketing
staff. This suggests a clear conflict of interest and that Therapists and clinicians are
likely aware of the quid quo pro nature of their contractor relationship with Tactile.


“And I talked to [a therapist] who said he's referring out about [mid-teens] patients a
month for a Tactile device. And then I asked him, ‘How many setups are you doing
then in turn?’ And he said he's probably doing about the same in setups, and he
gets $150 per... It's meant a lot for his family...”


– Senior Executive, Lymphedema Product Supplier, emphasis added


Tactile’s legal liability here is perhaps best left to Tactile itself: (from the company’s
FY2019 10K)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352249-strong-sell-on-tactile-systems-bloated-stock-needs-compression-therapy?source=all_articles_title 15/32


Notably, since the lawsuit, Tactile has actually changed language in its 10K that is
relevant to these laws:


Removed claim contract trainers are independent. No longer disclosing the fact that the individuals trying
to push the product onto decision makers are the ones selecting who gets lucrative training
contracts.

Veterans Affairs (VA) Case Study – A Roadmap For Other
Channels


Removed various statements and assertions to compliance with key legislation such as the Anti-Kickback
Statute and Stark Law.


While the Qui Tam lawsuit is expected to reach jury trial by April next year, the VA has
already clamped down on PCD spending since the lawsuit was filed. Studying the
VA offers a potential roadmap for the rest of the industry, including Medicare and the
commercial channel.


As VFMS primarily services the VA, many of its allegations are related to Tactile’s
practices revolving around this particular channel. This may be why the VA has been
ahead of the curve on cracking down on Tactile reimbursement. A closer look at publicly
available VA spending data suggests the following:


VA spending patterns corroborate many of VFMS’ allegations around the timeline of
Tactile’s aggressive marketing activities


VA decision makers are taking the allegations seriously - growth in VA spending
dramatically slowed immediately following the filing of the Qui Tam lawsuit and
Tactile has lost significant share


From the lawsuit, VFMS alleges that Tactile began its aggressive marketing practices in
2017:

VA spending data is publicly available via the Freedom of Information Act. While we are
unable to provide the raw data, interested readers can access this information via a
FOIA request to the VA. Our analysis below is conducted using VA spending data

We found that the data on E0652 reimbursement corroborated the lawsuits allegations
around timing, with significant acceleration starting in 2017:

This growth was in large part driven by Tactile:

VA spending. VA spending data above includes only the E0652 code, Tactile includes
revenue from E0651 and E0652, as well as accessory products.


More importantly, the filing of the Qui Tam lawsuit coincided with a significant falloff in
VA spending on E0652 devices:

This is especially noticeable when looking at Tactile’s VA revenue:

Although Tactile’s VA revenue just witnessed its worst quarter in history (down 8% YoY),
the worst may be yet to come. The lawsuit, filed in August 2018, was severely delayed
owing to a change in judge. Proceedings resumed at the end of 2019 and on February
21, 2020, Tactile’s motion to dismiss the suit was denied. The discovery deadline
has been set in November 2020 with the jury trial to be held in April 2021.

Medicare Has Hit Back With Audits Against Tactile


What is also interesting is that VA spending on E0652 grew by 6% YoY in 1Q20, while
TCMD VA revenue declined 8%, suggesting Tactile has started losing share. COVID-19
has also had a delayed impact on E0652 reimbursement. It appears Tactile's next
quarter results will be severely challenged:

results will be slightly higher


The VA is not alone: other channels are following suit and will likely experience the
same trajectory over time.


On January 23 , 2019, the Region-5 (i.e. Durable Medical Equipment) RAC auditor for
Medicare, Performant Recovery Inc., quietly announced the following CMDS approved
audit issue (link). Prior to this, Performant had never audited E0651 or E0652 claims in
its history as RAC auditor.

Tactile also had the highest number of medical necessity denials:


In fact, using the data from CMS, we also looked at ratio of denials vs no issue for
Tactile's claims audited. We found that 71% of all Tactile’s claims have been flagged for
issues. Or, to put it differently, from January 2019 to December 2019, Performant
audited 164 claims submitted by Tactile. Of these 164 claims, 117 were retroactively
denied.

Multiple industry participants believe the growth from Tactile was one factor in putting
the industry under the microscope:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4352249-strong-sell-on-tactile-systems-bloated-stock-needs-compression-therapy?source=all_articles_title 24/32


“The RAC is being very aggressive about claims, and asking for money back. It is my
belief that the entire reason that this RAC audit started is Tactile Medical.
They’re after them. We all know it. And so, when you see some of the data, which
you can get your hands on. I mean, there’s this thing called an HME data bank, and
you can buy this data about who’s prescribing pumps under the 651 and 652
categories, through Medicare each year. Tactile on the 52s files more claims with
Medicare than every other DME in the country combined. So, who do you think
they’re after. So, this RAC audit started.”


– Senior Executive, Lymphedema Product Supplier, emphasis added


“…the industry is such that nobody has ever had a ton of pump business until Tactile
got in and really, really went after it strong and went after it very aggressively with the
types of relationships that they have. And as you know, from that lawsuit, there are
people who are questioning some of the relationships. So again, we’re going to be
very cautious. We’re not going to operate the way we believe Tactile is, because
we think that’s probably causing damage and harm long-term to pump
coverage if it keeps blowing up.


– Senior Executive, Compression Garment & Pump Manufacturer, emphasis added


E0651 audits are likely paving the way for a wave of E0652 claims. Indeed, RAC
auditors have financial incentives to maximize clawbacks, and E0652 claims are worth
4-8x more than E0651 claims.


So far, Performant has only conducted 33 audits on E0652 claims through November
2019. Of these 33 audits, 25 (i.e. more than 75%) have been claims requested from
Tactile.

Investors should note that these audits have already impacted Tactile’s financials. While
the company has continued to book Medicare revenues as usual, receivable days for
Medicare-related accounts receivable have increased nearly 40% in the wake of
the audit results.


Source: OSS Research, TCMD SEC Filings – Annualized A/R days defined as Medicare
A/R divided by Medicare revenue * 90


This suggests Medicare is likely taking the results of the RAC audits seriously and
withholding cash reimbursement to Tactile. Yet the company has continued to book
Medicare revenues, and we believe management have not informed investors of these
developments.


Investors can look to history for a roadmap of what comes next. This is not the first time
the industry has been investigated for abuse. A July 1998 report from the Office of
Inspector General (OIG) offers some insight into the last time a major wave of audits
and clampdowns hit the industry (link). Spoiler: E0652 reimbursements fell 92% from
~$107mm in 1995 to ~$9mm in 1996. (Yes. 25 years ago, this market that Tactile
claims to be $5bn+ was a $100mm revenue industry. And that was at its peak before the
OIG crackdown.)

Potential Changes To Commercial Payer Reimbursement


Source: July 1998 Report by OIG, Medicare Allowances for Lymphedema Pumps


Source: July 1998 Report by OIG, Medicare Allowances for Lymphedema Pumps


As Performant begins to take action on E0652 claims, Tactile sits in an extremely
precarious position. The results also bode poorly for its existing Qui Tam lawsuit and
what may come out in discovery


Moreover, in addition to clawbacks from Medicare, it is likely that commercial payers,
therapists, doctors, and nurses will also respond to industry noise generated from these
audits.


As mentioned above, one key issue here is the fact that Tactile earns 90% of its revenue
from Flexitouch (advanced PCD, E0652) devices. No other DME distributor has been
able to achieve such a high share of E0652 volume. Reimbursements for E0652 are
significantly more stringent and require extensive documentation proving prior use of
CDT and basic, E0651 devices.


While Medicare has clamped down significantly on E0652 reimbursements over time,
commercial payers have been looser on adherence to coverage requirements. This
appears to be changing as a result of rapid growth in reimbursements for these codes. A
sample of what our conversations with various industry participants revealed:

Follow The Insiders


“…in the past year, six months to a year, commercial plans have certainly been
changing to follow the Medicare guidelines a lot more strictly. What we've been
finding is that where it used to be very easy for us to process an E0652 or an
expensive item through a commercial plan, it's no longer. They want the same or
similar requirements. They want you to do authorization, or they want you to do a
three-month trial with pre and post measurements. So, everywhere, it's getting kind of
stringent...But definitely in the past six months, I would say, all of the health plans
have really just ... They did a mid-year update, and they kind of really tightened
their grasp on everything. So, they're really making it more along the lines of
Medicare…”


– VP of Reimbursement, West Coast DME Distributor, emphasis added


“…there are a number of private insurance companies that follow the Medicare LCD,
but that doesn't mean they're going to follow the RAC audit. But I believe it will
become public knowledge if they have real issues of violating the way they're filing
claims, and other people may start looking at them…Blue Cross Blue Shield has
totally just redone their policy, and filing a 52 claim in [Midwest US state]…has
become almost impossible. And things like that are going to really start to hurt
Tactile as well. I think what's going on in Blue Cross Blue Shield…is starting to trickle
down to other places as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if it had an impact on [the
industry].”

~130,000 shares were in 2019 alone. The largest transaction in which he sold

February 13/14, 2019…three weeks after the RAC audits were announced.

Valuation & Financials


In total, insiders have sold ~900,000 shares (or ~$46mm worth) since 2018.
COO Robert Folkes has reduced his shareholdings by a little under 50% since
the end of 2018.


VP of Sales Bryan Rishe has sold ~48% of his stock since the end of 2018.


Mary Thompson, former VP of Payor Relations, held ~24,000 shares at the
beginning of 2019. She currently holds ~3,700 shares, a reduction of nearly
85%.


If Tactile is truly best-in-breed in a $5bn market and growing at 20%+ annually:


Why has the CEO (only 60) decided to retire this year in the middle of the COVID-
19 crisis?


Why have so many senior executives, particularly those knowledgeable about
reimbursement and regulatory affairs, left over the last few years?


Why have virtually all insiders reduced their stakes by high double-digit
percentages?


We have contacted Tactile's investor relations team for comment and feedback on our
findings about the Qui Tam lawsuit, marketing arrangement, and recent RAC audit
results. We have not heard back from the company.


Since 2013, Tactile has grown its revenue more than five-fold from $37mm to $190mm,
or a CAGR of ~31% over six years. During this time, the company has demonstrated
ZERO operating leverage. In fact, its EBITDA margin of ~6% today as of FY2019 is
nearly exactly the same as it was six years ago in FY2013.

Comparing FY2013 with FY2019, major cost centers COGS and Sales & Marketing
have both increased as a percentage of revenue. As it turns out, the main source of
operating leverage has actually come from R&D.


Source: OSS Research, TCMD SEC Filings


Tactile's growth is overwhelmingly the result of aggressive sales tactics, marketing
arrangements, and reimbursement appeals. All of these activities require Tactile to
spend money to buy growth.


Since FY2013, the company has cumulatively generated a total of $24mm in Cash Flow
from Operations while spending $16mm in Capital Expenditures. A whopping $8mm in
total Free Cash Flow over six years.


Without operating leverage, Tactile will need to grow its revenue to over $700mm (or
another 4x) just to trade at 15x EBITDA. That’s twice the estimated TAM.


More realistically, $250mm of forward revenue at 8% EBITDA margins and a 12x
multiple yields a share price of ~$15 for 70% downside. This is without taking into
consideration any potential legal liabilities, clawbacks, or revenue shrinkage due to the
regulatory and legal actions against the company.
