Miller Energy: Faulty Reserve Assumptions And Poor Cash Flow
Leave Little Equity Value

As previously discussed in the last write-up, Miller's production and development cost
assumptions are far lower than what they've actually experienced, leading to an inflated
PV-10 far higher than the likely value of cash flows that will be produced from the
company's reserves. Recently, there have been a few additional data-points on Miller's
assumed development costs that continue to point towards this conclusion.


Miller announced on 5/20/2013 that they were to begin drilling the Sword #1 well. After a
careful analysis of Miller's reserve and PV-10 disclosures, this decision appears to be
highly questionable, as it implies this is either a gross misallocation of capital by MILL
management or Miller's cost assumptions within their reserve report are inaccurate.


Standardized Measure:


One data point that clearly demonstrates Miller's flawed assumptions underlying their
reserves can be found within the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows (on page F-35 of Miller's most recent 10-K). Under "Future development costs",
Miller assumes that it will only cost $75.3 million to develop all their proved reserves. This
figure is for all future periods required for Miller to produce their developed and
undeveloped reserves over several years. However, in the same 10-K, it was disclosed
that for fiscal 2013 alone, Miller had a cap ex budget of $50 to $100 million (page 32 of
10k). This would be a midpoint of $75 million, which means Miller expected to spend in
one year what their reserve report assumes is enough to develop Miller's entire proved
reserve base. Obviously, it will take much more than one year for Miller to develop and
produce their entire proved reserve base, especially considering how consistently they've
failed to meet their own expected development schedule.


As of 4/30/2012, Miller had 9.294 million boe (barrels of oil equivalent) of proved reserves,
of which 6.535 million were undeveloped. Even making the generous assumption that
Miller's currently proved developed reserves will have no future development costs, the
$75.3 million in future expected development costs used in calculating Miller's reserve
present value represents a cost of development of $11.53 per undeveloped barrel of
proved reserves. The Sword property is actually classified as a probable reserve, which
makes the decision to drill it even more puzzling.

On the company's Q3 2013 earnings call, Miller's CEO said that the estimated cost of the
Sword #1 well would be $17 million, with 800,000 barrels of estimated recoverable oil.
This equates to a finding and development cost of at least $21.25 per barrel. If Miller's
proved undeveloped reserves actually do cost $11.53 or less to develop, this expenditure
on Sword appears extremely reckless. The most likely explanation is that the assumed
cost, and therefore. the assumed PV10 values, of Miller's proved reserves are inaccurate.
As further evidence of this conclusion, Miller's reserve report assumes the sword prospect
will have a capital cost of only $10.9 million, almost 40% less than what management now
estimates.


Production Costs Revisited:


As discussed in the previous reports on Miller, the company's actual production costs
experienced has been much higher than what the company uses for assumed production
costs in their reserve report and DCF valuation. As a recap, Miller's standardized measure
in the most recent 10-K, lists "Future production costs and taxes" as $158.9 million. With
total proved reserves of 9.294 million boe, this means that Miller is assuming an average
production cost of $17.10 per barrel when discussing the present value of their reserves.
For fiscal year 2012, and the first nine months of fiscal 2013, total production for MILL was
371,843 and 237,552 boe respectively. Oil and gas operating costs were $14.9 million and
$13.0 million for these time periods, implying production costs of $39.96 and $54.56 per
barrel respectively, which is more than double the production cost assumptions used by
Miller in their discounted present value calculations.


A previous bull article on the company was optimistic that as production grows, production
costs per barrel will fall towards management's assumptions. Unfortunately, the evidence
provided to support this was a quote from management about lifting costs per barrel for a
single month in 2011. Looking at a larger sample size shows no such improvement in
costs coming down with higher production levels. For example, total production increased
26% from 294,157 barrels in fiscal 2011, to 371,843 barrels in fiscal 2012. Despite this,
production increase of 26%, oil and gas operating costs increased by 53% from $9.7
million to $14.9 million over this same time period (from $32.98 per barrel up to $39.96 per
barrel). Looking at the most recently reported three and nine months ending 1/31/2013 is
not as useful, but it is interesting to note that production costs actually continued
increasing despite flat, and negative production for those two time periods respectively.


Given these inaccurate cost assumptions, it increasingly appears that the large PV-10
value used by Miller to convince investors that their shares are undervalued is an illusion.
