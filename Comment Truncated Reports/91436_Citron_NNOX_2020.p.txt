Nano-X Imaging (NNOX) 


A Complete Farce on the Market – Theranos 2.0 


$0 Target 


 
Since its recent IPO, Nano-X Imaging (NNOX) has become a market darling based 
on the claim that they have created a better medical imaging device that is low 
cost, portable, and will forever change the way diagnostics are done globally as 
this new innovative technology will soon replace the legacy x-ray market. 
 
Citron puts NNOX under a corporate x-ray and we see right through it as a stock 
promotion that is actually insulting to anyone who spends 10 minutes to read the 
prospectus.  This stock is heading to $0 as the company’s recent fair value opinion 
on their technology is $0.14 a share. 
 
NNOX – The Claims 
 
Just the headline of their corporate homepage is fraudulent as they claim:

NNOX – The Truth 
 
NNOX has never published any data showing their machine’s images compared to 
images from a standard CT scanner.  There is not one scientific paper or

submission that would back up any of these claims.  As a matter of fact, we have 
not even seen proof of the product and have only seen a mockup drawing of what 
this machine is supposed to look like. 
 
To put the scale of this lie into perspective, just look at the medical imaging 
industry.  Medical imaging is a highly competitive market with definitive leaders 
pushing the envelope namely:  GE, Siemens, Philips, and Fuji.  The only way to 
create a better mousetrap would be through years of R&D. 
 
What you are about to read is accurate, and no we did not miss a 0.  Since its 
founding in 2018, NNOX claims that it has disrupted the medical imaging 
market with a total R&D spend of $7.5 million. 
 


 
 
Compare this to GE Healthcare, a leading player in the medical imaging sector, 
who invested over $1 billion in R&D just last year.

Compare the below: 
 
NNOX’s entire company has just 21 employees with 15 in R&D.  Below is a photo 
of NNOX’s R&D lab, which pales in comparison to that of GE.

GE’s biomedical x-ray and CT imaging lab is supported by over 300K square feet of 
laboratory space with 1,000+ staff scientists, engineers, and technicians

FDA 
 
While investors have been gullible enough to buy the stock, the FDA had a 
different opinion.  First it should be noted that NNOX did not even submit a novel 
product for approval but rather they submitted a 510(K) submission.

For those not familiar, a 510(K) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to 
demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, 
substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device.  Submitters compare their 
device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support 
their substantial equivalence claims.  
 
By submitting a 510(K), you are saying you have nothing new and are seeking easy 
approval as you are just another product that has already been tested. 
 
Approval of 510(K) is so easy that the FDA approved 85% of 510(K) device 
applications in a year.

56f088a01446#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approved%2085%20percent,the%20highest%20rate%20since%202010. 


 
After submitting its 510(K) application in January 2020, NNOX notes that only 
“in March 2020, we received an additional information request, referred to as a 
major deficiency letter, from the Review Organization which, among other things, 
required us to provide additional data and other information to complete the 
application and to address certain deficiencies highlighted by the reviewer.” 
 
They could not get the most simple of FDA clearance.  And worse, what about 
their claims of a novel approach and their innovative, revolutionary technology 
when we read in the F1 filing: 
 
“The submission will be based on a predicate filing for an equivalence claim to an 
existing FDA-cleared X-ray imaging system by another market participant and we 
expect to make no new claims as to the operation, image quality or functionality 
of the Nanox.Arc versus the predicate device.” 
 
Nanox Tells Us the Value of Its Technology is .14 cents a share!!! 
 
To understand the value of this “technology” just look at the company’s F-1 
where they disclose that “an independent valuation report” valued the 
company’s assets and IP at just $6.1 million in 2018…  before the whopping 
$7 mil in R&D spend:

“The Company (NANO-X IMAGING LTD), an Israeli limited liability company, was 
formed on December 20, 2018. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, as 
amended on December 3, 2019 and December 31, 2019, substantially all of the 
assets of Nanox Gibraltar, including all patents, patent applications and all other 
intellectual property rights, but not including the shares of Nanox Japan 
(predecessor), were sold to the Company for an aggregate consideration of $13.3 
million, reflecting the fair market value of the transferred assets, which was 
estimated to be $6.1 million (excluding cash) based on an independent valuation 
report”

But What About The Customers Who Have Submitted Orders? 
 
Despite not having any unique technology, FDA approval, or even a working 
model, NNOX appears to have put out distribution agreements.  As we all know, 
these agreements are worthless unless NNOX can deliver on its ridiculous claims.   
 
NNOX’s commercial agreements may sound nice on the surface, but these appear 
to be no more than fake customers.

Below are several examples of how ludicrous NNOX’s claims are that these are 
real customers. 
 
The Gateway Group is listed as NNOX’s largest customer, yet nowhere on the 
company’s website do they mention operating in the medical device sector.  The 
Gateway Group notes being a wholesaler/distributor in the below sectors: 


• FMCG 
• Drinks 
• Beauty and cosmetics 
• Health food, supplement and sports nutrition 
• Luxury hair care  
• Consumer electronics, audio products and commercial electronics

Another major customer, LATAM Business Development Group, claims to be 
located in Brazil, yet only has three employees who are all located in Israel where 
NNOX is also coincidentally located.

To put things into perspective, this $3 billion company is nothing more than a 
science project with a simple rendering, minimal R&D, fake customers, no FDA 
approval, and fraudulent claims that are beyond the realm of possibility 
 
Conclusion 
 
This $3 billion science project appears to be nothing more than a complete stock 
promotion.

In Part Two, we will discuss the background of management along with their 
related self-dealings with NNOX, history of shady fundraising, and false claims 
about market size.
