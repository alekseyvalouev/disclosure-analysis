In 1992, Robert Showen was inspired to begin an engineering project by the sound of
gunfire in East Palo Alto. According to an article by Forbes, he developed a system to
triangulate the location of gunfire based on sound waves in 1994. Robert Showen's
current LinkedIn profile shows that he started at ShotSpotter (NASDAQ:SSTI) in 1996.


Like many companies founded during the .com bubble, ShotSpotter achieved some
limited success but never really took off. Between its founding and March 31, 2017 (the
date corresponding to the disclosures in the S-1 filing), ShotSpotter's client list grew to
89 cities and the company covered a total of 450 square miles. Reported revenues were
$11.8 million in 2015 and $15.5 million in 2016, the net loss was $6.2 and $2.2 million
for those years. The accumulated deficit was $89.2 million as of March 31, 2017. This is
an unimpressive track record for a company that had been in business for 20 years and
had the backing of several venture capital funds including Lauder Partners and Motorola
Solutions.


To fund its losses, ShotSpotter raised ~$76m as a private company through 2014,
mainly through a series of private placement venture rounds.

Lauder Partners, a California-based Venture Capital firm, was an early backer of
ShotSpotter as far back as 2004. Currently, Lauder Partners and Gary Lauder, the
founder of the firm, own ~19% of SSTI equity. Motorola Solutions owned 15.6% of
ShotSpotter prior to the company's IPO. Given the disappointing financial results and
low revenues, it is likely that the venture partners grew tired of funding the business. To
exit, they had a few options:


Sell the company to other investors/strategic partners.


Take the company public.


Let ShotSpotter go bankrupt.


SSTI management attends many small and microcap conferences throughout the year
and I have met the company multiple times at these conferences. In discussing the
history of the company with CEO Ralph Clark, I learned that ShotSpotter did in fact
attempt to sell itself prior to the IPO could not find a buyer at an agreeable price.


When there are no strategic acquirers, where do venture funds turn when they need to
exit their investment in a consistently unprofitable business? In the public stock market,
of course! SSTI went public in May of 2017 at a valuation of about $105m ($11 IPO
price x 9,532,924 shares), which amounted to an eyebrow-raising 6.5x trailing revenue.
Revenues continued to grow, the stock got caught up in the great technology bubble of
recent times. According to S&P CapitalIQ ownership data, Motorola took advantage of
the rally to sell out of their entire SSTI position by the March quarter of 2018. Several
other venture funds and insiders also significantly reduced their stakes in the IPO and
shortly afterwards.

The Addressable Market


Despite the VC funds selling, the stock continued to rally, and the valuation peaked at
an eye-watering 25x Enterprise Value to Sales ratio during the third quarter of 2018. In
order to buy stock at such a high valuation, investors needed to believe that SSTI has a
huge addressable market and a sustainable competitive advantage that would allow it to
grow rapidly for years and achieve persistently high profits. The sell side was happy to
feed this narrative. The initiation report by Tim Klasell at Northland, for example, says
that "We estimate the company has addressed only 10% of its market for US Law
Enforcement with sales efforts into international and campus settings in early days. We
also believe the solution, distribution and brand can be leveraged into adjacent markets
quite easily."


I believe that this rosy assessment is very far off the mark. Most of the truly addressable
market consists of a handful of reasonably wealthy American cities with a gun violence
problem contained within a concentrated geographic area. The largest American cities
are already using ShotSpotter or one of its competitors, and many others have already
evaluated ShotSpotter and decided not to adopt it. Despite years of effort, the company
has failed to gain traction outside of the United States because most major foreign cities
either have limited gun violence or have far more urgent priorities for their law
enforcement budgets. Even more significantly, competitors are emerging and winning
market share. For these reasons, SSTI's revenue growth is already slowing significantly.


Contrary to the rhetoric of certain high-profile politicians, violent crime has fallen
precipitously in the United States in recent decades. According to annual reports
published by the FBI and charted by the Pew Research Center, the rate of violent crime
fell by 51% between 1993 and 2018.



https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/publications#Crime-in%20the%20U.S.
In ShotsSpotter's most recent investor presentation, management identified a total
market size of over $1 billion per year. Management attributed about 60% of the total
potential revenue to a domestic opportunity set of 1,400 U.S. cities billed at $400,000
per year, which is about 4-7 coverage miles based on the Company's billing of rate
quote.

For the sake of comparison, the full cost of hiring a new police officer in Phoenix, AZ is
$109,000 in salary and benefits and $12,000 in equipment, according to the city's
budget director. That means that a city installing the system could hire about 3
additional officers for the price of adding ShotSpotter in a 4.25 square mile area. To
make this worthwhile, the city will need to have certain hotspots for gun violence and the
budget to both pay for the system and the police officers to respond to the calls.


To analyze ShotSpotter's current client list and prospects, I looked at several factors:


the number of shooting-related injuries per square mile1.



https://ir.shotspotter.com/presentations

https://kjzz.org/content/492148/what%E2%80%99s-full-cost-hiring-more-phoenix-police-officers
the density of the injuries2.


the city's total population3.


the city's annual police budget4.


Based on my research, I believe the Company's addressable market estimation is wildly
unrealistic.


ShotSpotter's top two clients are New York and Chicago, which together represent
about 35% of the company's revenue. Shooting injuries per square mile averaged
about 8 and 56 in New York and Chicago, respectively, which is far above average. In
New York, the problem is geographically concentrated, which makes it ideal for limited
deployment where cost is based on the covered square miles. In addition, both cities
have large law enforcement budgets that allow them to purchase ShotSpotter's products
without having to make significant cuts elsewhere.

The website The Trace is an independent third-party and free service that provides
maps and data of gun-related incidents in American cities. Using this website, I
examined the maps of the largest cities in the United States examined which ones were
current or former clients of ShotSpotter. In these maps, yellow dots represent gun
injuries and red dots represent reported gun-related deaths. These images are
unaltered except for the green boxes I added to point out specific hotspots for gun
violence. I tried to keep city scales consistent for the sake of integrity. I broke down the
opportunity set for SSTI into high/medium density shooting clusters, high/medium
population cities, and large/medium budgets. Here are some prominent examples.

These cities are both very large and have unusually dense injury clusters, which allows
SSTI's products to potentially help police detect more crimes. This is a critical criterion -
using SSTI's expensive products (more on that below) in more widely dispersed cities is
simply not economical.
With few exceptions, if a city has a notable gun problem, ShotSpotter is already
deployed there or was already evaluated and rejected. To estimate the total market size
already tapped by SSTI, I took a top-15 sampling of the U.S.'s largest metropolitan
areas, as measured by the Census Bureau, and combined it with online local news
archives and SSTI's investor information. Based on my research and without
extrapolating beyond the top-15 metropolitan areas by population, I estimate
about 28% of U.S. metropolitan areas, as weighted by population size, are already
customers or have evaluated and rejected ShotSpotter.

One notable rejection came from the city of Philadelphia, whose high density, high
population, and large budget stats should make ShotSpotter a no-brainer for the city.

Philadelphia has a long history of declining ShotSpotter's product pitch, dating back to
2008. Most recently, the city opted to give its business to one of SSTI's competitors,
Safety Dynamics. According to city officials, Safety Dynamics' cost, design, and
scalability were superior to ShotSpotter's audio-only offering:


"We were able to make an apprehension within 15 seconds of one guy shooting
another guy," Michael Vidro, director of Public Safety Technology for the Philadelphia
Police Department Intelligence Bureau, said of one case. Vidro designed the system,
which is a Philly-specific version of SENTRI technology. It cost $500,000 to design,
requires no additional costs to operate and would cost about $10,000 per new unit to
expand. By comparison, Vidro said, ShotSpotter would have charged $500,000 to
install devices to cover just ten square miles, additional costs to expand that
coverage area and another $500,000 per year for maintenance.

One category of city that is likely outside of SSTI's reach is those with high density injury
clusters, high populations, but small budgets. New Orleans is the exemplar of this
category. It installed the system in 2008 with support from the FBI but ended the
program after the federal money dried up. FBI Special Agent John Selleck is quoted in
the linked article, saying "In New Orleans, it may have been that they needed officers in
patrol vehicles first before they could make the expenditure on the technology."

Most of the large and dense cities with well-funded police forces and concentrated areas
of gun violence are either current ShotSpotter clients or have deployed competing
solutions. The next best set of potential customers consists of cities with more dispersed
shooting problems and smaller law enforcement budgets. Houston is one notable large
city that is not a ShotSpotter client. The map indicates that its gun violence problem is
not geographically concentrated.

Some other medium-density cities, such as Sacramento, Louisville, San Antonio, and
Nashville signed on with ShotSpotter, but have had trouble justifying the product's cost
due to lack of tangible results. Sacramento and San Antonio have dropped the service,
and it is likely to fall victim to a round of budget cuts in Louisville. Plans to implement the
system in Nashville have been canceled.

The Market Outside the United States

"Metro Nashville Police Department now says their limited manpower and resources
could be better used in other ways."


Finally, there are cities with high population, medium budgets, but low density injury
clusters. I believe these cities simply do not have a large enough problem with gun
violence to merit paying for ShotSpotter's system. Cities like San Jose, Portland, and
Seattle fit this category. This leaves the Company competing for the handful of low
population cities with high density injury clusters and the budget to pay for ShotSpotter,
such as Camden, NJ and Canton, OH. These opportunities are necessarily smaller, and
they are limited in number.


After reviewing the evidence, it is abundantly clear that the 1,400 city at
$400,000/year TAM is a fantasy. The cities with the best use case for a shot
detection system are already clients or have opted for competing solutions, and
the company will have a more difficult time selling to cities with lower rates of gun
violence, lower density, and/or lower budgets.

Ramping Competition


Since the IPO, part of the bull case for ShotSpotter has always been the prospect of
selling the system to big cities outside of the United States. The 2018 10-K spells this
out:


Outside of the United States, we estimate that the market for our ShotSpotter Flex
includes approximately 200 cities in the European Union, Central America, the
Caribbean, South America, and Southern Africa that have at least 500,000 residents.
We estimate that a customer in this market could invest an average of approximately
$1.0 million per year for our public safety solution.


Despite some serious sales efforts, ShotSpotter has not managed to make much
progress outside of its home market. The 10-K notes that the company has "only one
currently deployed ShotSpotter Flex customer outside of the United States in South
Africa" but that "we just signed a contract in early 2019 with the Bahamas." Rio de
Janeiro tested ShotSpotter but later abandoned it, while Recife used a local competitor.
Birmingham (UK) tested the system in 2010 but did not adopt it. The company's lone
success in trying to sell to major cities outside the US appears to have been Cape Town,
South Africa, which signed on in 2016. I believe that ShotSpotter's poor sales record in
non-US markets is caused by the same issues that have hampered its progress in the
United States: many major cities don't have a chronic gun violence problem, but most of
the ones that do have more urgent priorities for their law enforcement budgets.


ShotSpotter was created to detect gunshots, and that has been the focus of the
company over its entire history. Safety Dynamics, a private company that sells the
SENTRI II system and won business in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and a livestock show in
Houston, appears to have a similar business model. I believe that there is a significant
chance that this market is about to turn in a different direction.

The concept of "smart cities" has been gaining a lot of traction recently. The term is
something of an overused buzzword, but, in general, it means the use of networked
sensors and computing to increase efficiency in urban areas. The benefits may include
traffic monitoring and management, improvements in energy efficiency, and detection of
problems for maintenance. Large companies, like Signify, AT&T, and Verizon are
investing in products and services that fit this category. Similarly, a new company called
Wi-fiber has developed a new multi-purpose product called the 'Intelli-platform' that
directly competes with ShotSpotter. The Inteli-platform is placed where a streetlight
would ordinarily go but serves many functions, including


Wireless connectivity


Microphones, including gunshot detection


Cameras


LED with a strobing functionally for emergencies


According to DigitalTrends, the product won best in show in the Smart City category at
the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2017.


Canton, Ohio recently replaced ShotSpotter with Wi-Fiber. City officials noted that Wi-
Fiber covers a larger area at a lower cost, provides both audio and visual recording, and
because the city owns the sensors, it can move them easily on their own. The change in
vendors appears to have been triggered by SSTI trying to raise prices by 5%:


The startup cost for Wi-Fiber could be up to $179,600 with an estimated reoccurring
cost of $60,000. The city's discounted contract with ShotSpotter for 2019 was
$148,838. The company is raising the cost of service by 5% in 2020, which would
cost the city at least $156,280. It's estimated the city would save $158,181 in a three-
year period by switching to Wi-Fiber. Gabbard said future costs could increase,
however, if the city adds more devices.

SSTI Revenue Growth is Already Slowing


To adapt to the move toward smart cities, ShotSpotter has partnerships with GE
Current, Verizon, and AT&T to incorporate its gunshot detection solution into streetlights
and other infrastructure. However, these partnerships have not yet yielded significant
results. On the 2018 Q2 conference call, CEO Ralph Clark noted that "we had our first
Smart City deployment with GE Current in Atlanta" during the quarter. Since then, they
appear not to have made any more progress, which CFO Alan Stewart alluded to on the
Q4 2018 earnings call


So this is Alan. I would say that we're still cautiously optimistic about how large
providers of smart cities, smart communities like Verizon, GE and others, can use
ShotSpotter as a launching platform, which I think you're saying is, sometimes there
might be a city that isn't necessarily ready to do a full smart city or smart community
deployment where Verizon or someone else might be able to say, well, let's get
started with something like this and sort of primed to pump. I think that is possible.
We have seen very little movement there, frankly, in terms of how fast they move on
these deals, but we are certainly hopeful that, that can and will occur either later on
this year or into 2020 and beyond.


The move toward networked sensors and devices across cities is gaining momentum. I
believe that there is a significant risk to SSTI that shot detection simply becomes an
add-on for smart city hardware and service deployments sold by larger companies,
which will put pressure on both the company's revenue growth rate and gross margins.
Capital IQ data shows that the average gross margin for communications equipment
suppliers with market capitalizations between $50 and $500 million is about 40% over
the last 12 months, which is significantly below ShotSpotter's trailing gross margin of
58%.


I have argued that most of the best targets for SSTI's technology are already on the
platform or are using a competing product and that competition is growing more intense.
If both these points are correct, ShotSpotter's revenue growth should be slowing - and it
is:

In addition to churn caused by competitive pressure, ShotSpotter has historically lost
clients because of budgetary pressures or because local police forces decided that
system simply isn't worth the cost. Charlotte declined to renew their contract with the
company because, according to a memo authored by the city council, "based on its
experience with the system, CMPD feels the return on investment was not high enough
to justify a renewal." The city noted that the system did not help the police to make
arrests, and they believed that the money could be better spent on cameras. A new
budget proposal by the mayor of Louisville would eliminate funding for ShotSpotter to
make up for a budget shortfall. Steve Conrad, the Police Chief, defended the
ShotSpotter program but noted that if they are forced to choose what to fund, "officers
[are] more important to stopping crime than anything else." Sacramento also ended its
contract with SSTI this year due to budget pressures. In response to questions, a
Sacramento


Police Spokeswoman said that "it's not ideal… but the money had to come from
somewhere." These examples show that not all police departments have found
ShotSpotter to be effective at fighting crime, but even those that do are likely to prioritize
their payroll over renewing their contract with the company if they are facing a budget
shortfall.


Some recent data points to an economic slowdown in the United States. If this trend
continues, local tax receipts are going to fall, as they have in the last two recessions,
and ShotSpotter could be one of the first things to get cut from the local budget.

Is ShotSpotter run for shareholders or for insiders?


In a recession, I think it is likely that ShotSpotter's revenue growth could turn negative.


Between 2016-2018, SSTI insiders made over $8.2m of compensation according to
S&P's CapitalIQ data platform, including $4.6m in 2018 alone. This compares to total
revenue over the same time period of $74m and total net losses as reported of ~$20m.


Source CapitalIQ compensation data


Source: Capital IQ compensation data and company filings


For each of the last three years, SSTI's board and named executives received between
8 and 13% of total revenue as compensation. These are lucrative compensation
packages for such a small company, particularly one that has historically lost money.
Investors reviewing this information can reach their own conclusion, but from where I'm
sitting it's hard to argue that such generous compensation is in the best interest of
shareholders, and the amount of compensation has been increasing every year. If this
trend continues, shareholders who own SSTI under the thesis that the company is going
to leverage G&A expense as it grows are likely to be disappointed. Furthermore, activist
efforts to change compensation are unlikely to be successful. The board is staggered in
three classes of directors, making it difficult for shareholders to gain control of the board.

Our Board currently consists of seven members, two of whom are in the class whose
term of office expires at the upcoming Annual Meeting. We expect that any additional
directorships resulting from any future increase in the number of directors will be
distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will
consist of one third of the directors. The division of our Board into three classes with
staggered three-year terms may delay or prevent a change of our management or a
change in control.


In my experience, a staggered board suggests a lack of shareholder orientation and an
entrenched management team, which implies that the chance that this company will
reduce SG&A as a percent of revenue in response to pressure from shareholders is low.


ShotSpotter emphasizes its software and subscription revenue model in its 10-K filings.
For example, the 2018 10-K says, "The Company offers its solutions on a SaaS-based
subscription model to its customers." While I acknowledge that ShotSpotter does include
software as part of its service offering, I do not believe it should be valued like a SaaS or
other software business. The appeal of the software business is that the marginal cost
of making another sale of an existing product is tiny, which allows companies in this
industry to maintain very high gross margins and leverage SG&A and R&D expenses as
they grow. ShotSpotter installs acoustic sensors (hardware) in specific neighborhoods
for its clients and runs an Incident Operations Center to process the output from the
sensors and communicate with law enforcement. According to management comments
on the earnings calls, the sales cycle can take anywhere from 1-2 years depending on
the size of the city and police department. For these reasons, SSTI will not be able to
leverage expenses and expand its operating margins like a software business. Instead, I
believe that the relevant industries for valuation comparisons are communications
equipment and technology services.


Using CapitalIQ, I calculated the average trailing EV/EBIT and EV/Sales ratios for two
groups of companies: Communications Equipment and the combination of IT Services
and Data Processing and Outsourced Services. For both groups, I included only US-
listed companies with market capitalizations between $50 and $500 million. The results
are below:

Source: Capital IQ, my calculations. Only profitable companies are included in the
harmonic mean EV/EBIT ratio calculation.


It is worth pointing out that an EV/EBIT between 14 and 22 implies a P/E ratio between
about 18 and 28 assuming no debt and a 21% tax rate. This is clearly a growth multiple
rather than a multiple for a mature company. In order to apply these valuation ratios to
derive a valuation for ShotSpotter, I used what I consider to be unrealistically optimistic
assumptions for the company:


Revenue grows to $86 million in 2021, which is about 2.2 times the revenue over
the last 12 months and implies an annual growth rate of about 37.5%. Recall that
the year over year growth rate was only 15% last quarter and likely to slow further
because of emerging competition and because the company has already signed on
the largest potential clients with the best use case.


Gross margin declines to 50% from 58% over the last 12 months. I believe that a
decline in gross margins is likely because Wi-Fiber is already undercutting
ShotSpotter on price.


Sales and Marketing expense is 25% of Revenues, which is around where it has
been over the last year. The company is now competing to sign on smaller cities
with smaller budgets that need fewer square miles of coverage, so the sales
process is likely to get more expensive rather than less expensive over time.


G&A expense is 15% of revenue. G&A expense has been 22% of revenues over
the last 12 months, and as I've pointed out, the executives and directors of this
company are not shy about paying themselves.


R&D stays about flat at $5 million per year. R&D expense over the last 12 months
has been $5.16 million


Those get me to the following numbers:
Conclusion


Source: My Calculations


As of the time of this writing, the market price of SSTI is $19.66. The table below shows
my calculations of the fair value of ShotSpotter shares using the valuation ratios from
the peer group, a discount rate of 10% over 2.25 years, and an assumed free cash flow
of zero through the end of 2021 (the existing cash balance of $27.4 million is added
back to the enterprise value to derive the market capitalization).

As with any forecasting and valuation exercise, it's easy to disagree with my
assumptions, but it takes a lot more than minor tweaks to justify the current valuation of
ShotSpotter!


In order to be bullish on ShotSpotter at anywhere near current prices, an investor needs
to believe that the company has a long growth runway and a unique competitive position
that is going to give it durable pricing power. In this report, I've laid out evidence that
competition is growing more intense, city governments and police departments are price
sensitive and likely to cut the service when they need to tighten the budget, and the
company has already captured the best markets for its product in the United States,
making the path to further growth more difficult. In addition, despite years of trying,
ShotSpotter has made very little progress selling its product outside of its home market.

SSTI shares have sold off dramatically over the last 6 months, but that certainly does
not make it cheap. My analysis suggests that it has a lot further to fall before it hits a
reasonable valuation.


Further Reading


There is a lot of good material published on this company on the internet. For both bears
and bulls, I'd recommend Fuzzy Panda's write up, which documents a court case in
which ShotSpotter was deemed inadmissible as evidence, a long investigative report by
Forbes, a more recent article by Jacob Ryan with the Kentucky Center for Investigative
Reporting, and a much older profile of the company and technology by Wired.
