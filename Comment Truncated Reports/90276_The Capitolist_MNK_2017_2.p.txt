MNK


As a result of prior acquisitions, MNK has a ~$2B liability on its balance sheet that
the sell-side doesn't understand.


Given the ~100m shares outstanding, this ~$2B liability results in a $20/share drop
to street price targets.


To management's credit, they do not hide from the liability, in fact, they
appropriately highlight the "deferred tax liability" as "installment notes" to the IRS.


At some point, the sell side is going to have to remove this error from their models,
and even if they don't, you can be confident that any acquirer would see this as a
call on cash and add it to their EV calculation.

Mallinckrodt (MNK) is a debt bomb that is worse than you think. The sell-side is going to
have to scrap its "acquisition" pump on the stock and trim their price targets by
~$20/share. The Goldman initiation is particularly ridiculous given that they use an LBO
as their valuation backstop but fail to include ~$2B in debt to the IRS.


After considering this issue for some time, I think it should be laid out for investors to
consider. When you buy a US domiciled company and desire to take advantage of your
Irish tax domicile (MNK is an Irish shell corp, HQ is in St. Louis but like VRX they long
ago moved their tax domicile overseas to avoid paying US taxes), you have to
commence an internal sale of your US asset to your Irish shell.


This is an internal sale and doesn't involve any real cash expense, however, it does
result in a taxable gain in the eyes of the IRS as the US corporation has sold a
significant asset (all its IP) to the Irish Domicile. In basic terms, the IRS considers the
sale of intangible assets to be a taxable gain and you owe them some level of payment,
payment to the IRS can be remitted as a one-time cash expense or in the form of
"Installment Notes" that are filed under "Deferred Tax Liabilities". Those liabilities are
notes to the IRS - they are interest bearing - they are a call on cash before equity.


You might be asking why these debts are not reported in the debt to EBITDA ratios that
NYSE:MNK loves to highlight - or in their debt rating for example? The IRS always gets
paid first right?


Well in this case because the notes are "Differed Tax liabilities," they can theoretically be
offset by large losses in the US. So from a Debt perspective, should MNK go bankrupt,
the losses would be used to offset the differed liability. Thus, they have little bearing on
the company's ability to repay creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.

However, the IRS does stand in front of the equity - And That - is what we are here to
talk about today. I have not found a single sell-side model that accounts for this debt in
their Enterprise Value calculations. Virtually all of them only include the the LTM net
Debt number of ~$5.5B in calculating their price targets. Not one of them includes the
additional $2.2b in "other long-term obligations" including this massive tax
liability.


This liability equates to roughly $20/share of additional debt that is wholesale ignored by
the equity research analysts. So let's look at the average price target on the street right
now shall we?


Source: Bloomberg


As you can see, the avg price target is $54/share - so if you agree with us then we can
easily strip out $20/share for the failure to include the IRS mediated debt and we find the
avg price target is now ~$35/share.


This suggests that there is no upside left in the stock for the next 12 months, in fact, it
also suggests that the stock needs to trade at a reasonable discount to said fair value.

If one consults the 10q, you clearly find a section highlighting the notes to the IRS (cut
and paste below).


Interest Bearing Deferred Tax Obligation


As part of the integration of Questcor, the Company entered into an internal installment
sale transaction related to certain Acthar intangible assets during the three months
ended December 26, 2014. The installment sale transaction resulted in a taxable gain.
In accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 453A ("Section 453A"), the gain is
considered taxable in the period in which installment payments are received. During the
three months ended December 25, 2015, the Company entered into similar transactions
with certain intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of Ikaria, Inc. and Therakos,
Inc. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company sold its Intrathecal
Therapy business with a portion of the consideration from the sale being in the form of a
note receivable subject to the installment sale provisions described above. As of June
30, 2017, the Company had an aggregate $1,781.7 million of interest-bearing U.S.
deferred tax liabilities associated with outstanding installment notes. The GAAP
calculation of interest associated with these deferred tax liabilities is subject to variable
interest rates. The Company recognized interest expense associated with the Section
453A deferred tax liabilities of $17.8 million and $18.6 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2017 and June 24, 2016, respectively, and $36.2 million and $37.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 24, 2016, respectively.

The Company has reported Section 453A interest on its tax returns on the basis of its
interpretation of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and Regulations. Alternative
interpretations of these provisions could result in additional interest payable on the
deferred tax liability. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these interpretations, the
Company has deferred the recognition of the benefit associated with the Company’s
interpretation and maintains a corresponding liability of $38.8 million and $30.3 million
as of June 30, 2017, and December 30, 2016, respectively. The balance of this liability
is expected to increase over future periods until such uncertainty is resolved. Favorable
resolution of this uncertainty would likely result in a material reversal of this liability and
a benefit being recorded to interest expense within the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of income.
