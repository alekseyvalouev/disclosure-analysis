Summary: Riot Blockchain (RIOT)
Riot made a dramatic pivot from a “life science tools” business to a blockchain company


mere months ago.


The company paid approximately $12 million for a two-week-old crypo-mining entity that


owned only about $1.9 million in crypto mining assets.


A second acquisition raises additional red �ags.


Riot depleted an estimated 63% of company cash through a special dividend that appears


to have disproportionately advantaged insiders.


Regardless of one’s views on blockchain technology, we believe Riot is a name that should


be avoided.


With “blockchain mania (https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-23/blockchain-


mania-and-mi�d-ii)” in full swing, a new self-described leader has emerged. Riot Blockchain


(NASDAQ:RIOT (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT)) purports to be

Riot Blockchain: Sudden Business Pivot,
Suspicious Acquisitions, Questionable
Special Dividend

nasdaq-listed-pure-play-blockchain-company-20171006-00665) “a Leading Blockchain Company


& Only Nasdaq Listed Pure Play Blockchain Company.” With share prices nearly quadrupling in


the past three months, we decided to examine the name more closely.


The company’s blockchain focus has come about through a series of rapid moves. Mere


months ago, Riot was known as Bioptix, Inc. and operated “a life science tools company that


provides an a�ordable solution for drug discovery scientists who require label-free, real-time


detection of bio-molecular interactions.”


On October 4th of this year, Bioptix announced (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-


releases/bioptix-changing-name-to-riot-blockchain-as-company-shifts-focus-to-strategic-


investor-and-operator-in-blockchain-technologies-300530737.html) that it was changing its


name and ticker from Bioptix. Inc. (BIOP) to Riot Blockchain (RIOT), and indicated that it would


be pursuing a completely di�erent business model focused on strategic investment and


operations in the blockchain ecosystem.


We �nd such a dramatic pivot in business operations to be concerning in its own right, but we


believe it is even more questionable given that the seismic shift has come about in conjunction


with a series of dubious transactions. This is just one of the many reasons there needs to be


crypto regulation (https://www.qredo.com/blog/regulation-trust-and-the-future-of-the-crypto-


industry), the market is too insecure and variable for anyone to consider any crypto to be


reliable and secure.


Riot Paid Approximately �12 million To
Acquire Kairos Global Technology – A Two-
Week-Old Crypto-Mining Company That
Owned Only About �1.9 Million in Crypto
Mining Assets


On November 2, 2017, the company announced via press (https://ir.riotblockchain.com/press-


releases/detail/14/riot-blockchain-enters-agreement-for-acquisition-of-1200) release that it had


“entered into a de�nitive agreement to acquire cryptocurrency mining equipment consisting of


700 Antminer S9s and 500 Antminer L3s, all manufactured by industry leader Bitmain.” Upon


closing of the purchase the company issued another press release

1200-bitcoin-mining) on November 6, 2017, stating that “it has closed on its acquisition of


cryptocurrency mining equipment”. A basic reading of the press releases might lead a reader to


believe that the company had purchased the equipment directly.


However, a reading of the November 1, 2017, Form 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000620/riot_8k.htm) that


described the transaction leaves us with a di�erent impression. The 8-K clari�ed that Riot had


actually acquired a corporate entity called Kairos Global Technology (“Kairos”) that held the


cryptocurrency mining equipment described above.


The form 8-K described a share exchange agreement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000620/riot_8k.htm) with


Kairos whereby the company exchanged Convertible Preferred Stock (convertible into


1,750,001 common shares of Riot) for all outstanding shares of Kairos’s common stock. Given


that Riot’s stock closed at $6.95 per share on November 1, 2017, we estimate the share


transaction value at approximately $12.1 million (As of this writing those same shares would be


worth an estimated $27 million.) In addition, Riot included a potential $1 million royalty


sweetener (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000667/riot_10q-


093017.htm) for Kairos’s shareholders:


The shareholders of Kairos also will receive a royalty to be paid from cash �ow


generated from operations, which shall entitle such shareholders to receive 40% of


the gross pro�ts generated on a monthly basis until they have received a total of


$1,000,000, at which point the royalty is extinguished.


All told, we estimate the transaction provided anywhere from $12-13 million in value to Kairos’s


shareholders on the day of closing. Our belief is that Riot grossly overpaid. As above, Riot’s


stated motive for the transaction was to acquire 700 Antminer S9s and 500 Antminer L3s used


to mine cryptocurrency.


However, if Riot had simply purchased the above servers directly from Bitmain


(https://www.bitmain.com/), we estimate that the price would have been $1,905,000. In order


to arrive at this number, we checked a historical capture of the Bitmain website as of October


16th, 2017 (https://web.archive.org/web/20171016044811/https:/shop.bitmain.com/), and


found that Antminer S9 servers were selling for $1,265 and that Antminer L3s were selling for


$2,040.

We contacted Bitmain to see if it was experiencing massive backlogs or any other scenario that


could justify an overpayment of roughly $10 million for $1.9 million of machines. We have not


heard back from Bitmain as of this writing. The historical capture of the Bitmain website from


October 16th shows that machines would have been expected to ship in just over one month


from that date (November 21st-November 30th).


Adding to our skepticism of the Kairos deal is the fact that Kairos appears to have had no


operations and/or website (despite registering a domain name


(https://registrydb.com/kairosblockchain.com)) and that the entity was formed


(http://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?


lx8nvq=fmE0EMNZjWiD8qFICJyf1w%253d%253d) on October 19, 2017 – less than two weeks


prior to its announced acquisition by Riot. We believe the fact pattern indicates that Riot’s


acquisition of Kairos’s assets is highly irregular. Especially when you think about the


consideration that should be used when registering a domain name for a new or existing


website, look at how people and businesses go about registering domain names over on sites


like makeawebsitehub.com (https://makeawebsitehub.com/how-to-register-a-domain-name/),


and it does seem nothing but irregular as to how Riot went about this.


Furthermore, it is unclear to us who ultimately bene�ted from the apparent generous payment


terms for Kairos. The entity was registered to the address of a believed one-man law �rm called


Laxague Law, Inc. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-laxague-00192679/) (“Laxague Law”). Its


o�cers consisted of a Dubai resident and its directors consisted of two Floridians, though the


underlying shareholder structure was not publicly disclosed.

39kI&isc=gofd1001aj) of the Tesspay.io (http://tesspay.io/) website shows that it was initially


registered on July 18, 2017. Tess then released a seven-page whitepaper in August 2017


(http://tesspay.io/TESSWhitepaper.pdf) describing (i) its plans for an initial coin o�ering (“ICO”);


and (ii) the role its coins intend to play in telecommunications transactions. Those


representations aside, the resumes of Tess’s principals leave us skeptical of Tess’s odds of


success:


Tess’s CEO, Je� Mason, concurrently holds the same CEO position at two other


companies, according to his LinkedIn pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/in/je�-mason-


6270526/): PowerCases and Wiztel;


Tess’s CFO, Fraser Mason, concurrently hold the position of Senior Vice President of


PowerCases, according to his LinkedIn pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fraser-mason-


64733841/); and


Tess’s Chief Software Architect, Sorin Tanasescu, concurrently holds various senior roles


at other companies, including: (A) Managing Director of VoiceWay; (B) Director of


Middleware Integration for Rogers Communications; and (C) Director of an entity called


Ingenium IT Compusoft (“Ingenium”).


Tanasescu’s other companies give us additional cause for concern. Namely, VoiceWay appears


to have been associated with a Bitcoin phishing website.


On a Bitcoin forum called BitcoinTalk (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=224061.0;wap2),


one user conveyed that Google was displaying advertisements for “mt-qox.com,” a clever


misspelling of the then-popular Mount Gox bitcoin trading website. That same user noted that


the “mt-qox.com” website completely duplicated the real Mount Gox website. This is why it is


important to do your research on bitcoin trading websites and bitcoin traders. Some people


decide to do research at websites similar to https://cryptoevent.io/review/bitcoin-revolution/

addition, Talle used a VoiceWay email address to register the mt-qox.com site. Reddit users also


noticed the site and started a thread entitled “[SCAM] watch out for mt-qox.com


(https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1fkkyo/scam_watch_out_for_mtqoxcom/)“. The


users reported the site to Mount Gox and Google. Google subsequently took action and


blocked it as a phishing website, according to the thread. (Note that the VoiceWay website itself


was also registered (http://voiceway.ca.hostdir.org/) by an individual named Cristian Talle –


under a Rogers Communications email address).


Furthermore on the subject of Tess: On the same day that Laxague Law set up Kairos (October


19, 2017), the same law �rm also set up an entity called Ingenium Global, Inc.


(http://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?


lx8nvq=InChigm1xtv9%252bfBiQj8bMA%253d%253d&nt7=0), which has a unique name that is


similar to an entity in which Tanasescu manages (Ingenium IT Compusoft). Even more


interestingly, Ingenium Global, Inc. listed the exact same o�cers/directors as Kairos (an


individual in Dubai and two from Florida) and registered the exact same par value and share


count. Given that Riot announced the acquisition of Tess the very next day (October 20, 2017),


we cannot help but wonder whether the selling parties in the Kairos transactions were in any


way related to the shareholders of Ingenium, and ultimately to the selling parties in the Tess


transaction.

funds to company insiders. That kind of cash giveaway – announced one day ahead of a shift to


a new, speculative business model – gives us signi�cant concerns. The sequence of events was


as follows:


In March 2017, Bioptix announced


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000481/bioptix_10q-


063017.htm) the completion of private placements that included a convertible note �nancing


and also included warrants to purchase 1,900,000 shares of common stock.


On September 25, 2017, Bioptix made the following disclosures:


1. Bioptix �led a Form 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000554/bioptix_8k.htm


) stating, in part, that notes from the March 2017 O�erings had been exchanged for


shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.


2. Bioptix �led an amended Registration Statement Form S-3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000555/bioptix_s3.htm


) which described how holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock “are entitled to


receive dividends if and when declared by the Company’s board of directors. The Series A


Preferred Stock will participate on an ‘as converted’ basis, with all dividends declared on


the Company’s Common Stock.”


Then on October 4, 2017


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000569/bioptix_8k.htm), the


newly-named Riot �led a Form 8-K stating that the company had approved a cash dividend:


Pursuant to which, the holders of the Company’s common stock, no par value per


share (the ‘Common Stock’), and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per


share (the ‘Series A Preferred Stock’), as of the close of business on October 13, 2017,


shall receive $1.00 for each share of Common Stock, including each share of Common


Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, on an


as converted basis.


The magnitude of the dividend is signi�cant. The payout “totaled approximately $9,562,000”


whereas Riot’s �nancial statements


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000667/riot_10q-


093017.htm) re�ected that at the close of Q3 2017 – two days before the October 2017


dividend was approved – the company had only $13,139,722 in cash and cash equivalents.Privacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
When factoring in an added $1.86 million in cash proceeds from warrant conversion, the


October 2017 dividend depleted an estimated 63% of the company’s cash and cash equivalents


balance. Consequently, we �nd its size relative to Riot’s available cash to be troubling.


The timing of related warrant conversions is similarly concerning. Riot’s quarterly �ling


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000667/riot_10q-


093017.htm) prior to the October 2017 dividend indicates that 2,060,000 warrants from the


March o�ering were converted into 1,228,690 common shares on a cashless basis. In addition,


620,000 warrants were exercised for cash during a period where Riot’s board of directors


authorized on October 10th a “temporary reduction in exercise price” of convertible securities


from the March 2017 private o�erings. Given that the record date of the October 2017 dividend


was October 13, 2017 (with a payment date of October 18, 2017), both the cashless warrant


conversion and the conversion from the reduction in exercise price of the March 2017


securities appear to have conspicuously occurred just prior to the payment of the October


2017 dividend.


Who Bene�ted From the Special Dividend?


In the press release announcing the special dividend, the company’s CEO stated: “This special


dividend is a positive step to return value to all Bioptix shareholders.” Despite this


pronouncement, we believe Riot insiders and participants in the March 2017 private


placements bene�ted disproportionately.


The amended Form S-3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000555/bioptix_s3.htm)


detailing the convertible and warrant o�erings prominently mentioned one individual in


particular. Per the �ling, “The Lead Investor is Barry Honig who is also a selling stockholder.”

Later, in two Schedule 13G �lings �led as of an event date of October 10th – just days prior to


the dividend ex-date – Jonathan Honig


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000165495417009301/honig-riot13g.htm)


and an individual named Mark Groussman


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000149315217011558/sc13g.htm) reported


common stock ownership stakes of 9.51% and 5.93% respectively. Jonathan Honig’s �ling also


mentioned that the 9.51% �gure “does not include 808,198 shares of common stock issuable


upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.” it is unclear from the �lings where Barry Honig’s


ownership on a common stock and on a convertible/exercised basis stands currently.


Note that the same �ling mentioned that there were only 5,436,503 shares of common stock


outstanding as of September 20th. By November 13th


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000667/riot_10q-


093017.htm), the number of common shares had spiked up to 8,321,137, a roughly 53%


increase in common shares in less than two months. Such a jump indicates that a signi�cant


amount of dilution has a�ected common stockholders in a short amount of time.


Conclusion


We have no strong bearish or bullish view on the future of blockchain. We genuinely hope the


technology is implemented broadly and that currency and information can be e�ectively


decentralized through its use. Regardless of one’s views on blockchain technology however, we


think Riot is a name that investors should avoid. We urge cautious investing to all.
