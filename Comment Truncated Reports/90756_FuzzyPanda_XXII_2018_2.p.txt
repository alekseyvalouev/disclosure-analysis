XXII


Our FOIA requests on 22nd Century Group received a 7(a) exemption response
including the line "releasing the withheld information could reasonably be expected
to interfere with on-going enforcement proceedings”. As a result, we suspect there
is an ongoing SEC investigation regarding the company.


Sharesleuth exposed articles from network of connected authors promoting XXII –
those authors also wrote about many other “IRTH Communications” & “Honig,
Brauser, and Frost” companies.


Still no MRTP (Modified Risk Tobacco Product) application!

We are short XXII (22  Century Group) because our FOIA (Freedom of Information Act)
requests received 7((a)) exemptions that lead us to suspect that the SEC is actively
investigating 22  Century Group. The SEC Office of the General Counsel determined
that records regarding any information about an investigation into XXII could be withheld
from our FOIA requests due to a 7((a)) exemption because “releasing the withheld
information could reasonably be expected to interfere with on-going enforcement
proceedings”.

Our Recent History with Undisclosed SEC Investigations – Zion Oil & Gas


Alleged Undisclosed Stock Promotion for XXII – An IRTH
Communications client:


It is important to note that we cannot deduce exactly what the SEC is investigating due
to this 7((a)) exemption, nor should the existence of an investigation mean that a
person, entity or security has violated the law. We would only discover those things
if/when the SEC brought forth any charges. We are unsure if 22nd Century Group is
aware of an active investigation since they have not replied to our request for comment
and since the Commission conducts its investigations on a non-public basis.


The last time we suspected an undisclosed SEC investigation and received an 7((a))
exemption in response to our FOIAs it involved Zion Oil & Gas on March 26, 2018 (see
our tweet). Zion management publicly denied there was an investigation. They even
called us “market manipulators.” Then months later the company confirmed that there
was an ongoing SEC investigation when Zion filed an 8-K that the SEC Dallas Ft. Worth
Office had subpoenaed Zion Oil & Gas. Meanwhile the stock fell from $5.35 (on March
26 ) to its current $1.09—a 79% decline.th


Since we wrote our earlier article on XXII, Chris Carey at Sharesleuth wrote a damning
exposé of a large network of often undisclosed stock promotions that included the
creation of fictitious authors. 22  Century (NASDAQ:XXII) was a constant focus of
these authors’ bullish articles: see Sharesleuth’s Pretenders & Ghosts: Stealth
Promotion Network article. This should be required reading for anyone considering
investing in XXII, either long or short.


nd


The article suggests how the same authors (sometimes fictitious people) wrote a
multitude of bullish investment articles for both IRTH Communication clients &
companies backed by Barry Honig, Michael Brauser, and Philip Frost. Since
Sharesleuth’s article was published, the SEC filed charges (link) against Barry Honig,
Michael Brauser, Philip Frost, John H. Ford, et al. for allegedly running pump & dumps
and manipulating the stock price of 3 specific companies (assumed to be MBVX, COCP,
and MGTI). MBVX was also written on extensively by Samuel Rae, an author of many of
the past bullish XXII pieces in 2017 (here & here). John H. Ford, who was charged by
the SEC and has already settled the charges (link), was also an author of a positive
article on XXII (it has since been removed from SeekingAlpha.com).

Highlights of the Sharesleuth article involving 22  Century Group include:nd


Fake authors like George Ronan writing positive XXII stories. This fake author is
shown to have 3 different profile pictures & bios for different investment sites, but
despite his multiple fictitious personalities, he is bullish on XXII.


Lack of disclosure - authors like Samuel Rae did not disclose if they were
compensated for or had positions in the stocks. If they were indeed compensated
then this lack of disclosure would violate the law.


Exposed a network of connected authors for XXII (they produced more than 20
positive stories in 2017 alone). Sharesleuth’s list of XXII promotional articles is
here. Authors were shown to write positive articles about IRTH Communications or
Honig-related companies and often right before events like stock offerings.


The exposé of this network of promotional authors is especially important given that last
year, the SEC brought enforcement actions against 27 different firms & individuals for
stock promotion schemes that led investors to believe they were reading independent,
unbiased analyses. (SEC charges)


22  Century’s management has still not explained who authorized or funded the
positive articles regarding XXII. Nor has it provided any reasoning for who else could be
responsible for these tactics of having fake authors write positive articles.


nd


Furthermore, XXII continues to pay & use IRTH Communications as their investor
relations firm. IRTH Communications is still listed as 22  Century’s IR contact on their
website & in press releases (link, and link) - even as it sits at the epicenter of these
articles.

MRTP (Modified Risk Tobacco Product) Update:


Cannabis Update:


Despite having extraordinarily long quarterly calls in which management talks about
hypothetical future licensing deals, 22  Century has not bothered to offer an
explanation for why XXII has consistently been the subject of positive articles from this
network of authors or other paid stock promotions.


nd


22  Century has still failed to re-file their MRTP application 2 years after it was
withdrawn in December 2016. Recently, they finally promised they will do so by the end
of 2018 (XXII promise). Despite not even having an MRTP application on file (see FDA
list of applications here), management still talks extensively about what receiving an
MRTP designation would do for their business and how they could hypothetically license
out this designation/brand. We find it highly unlikely that the FDA will ever approve a
low-nicotine cigarette for a MRTP marketing designation primarily because XXII’s Low
Nicotine Brand A cigarettes contain a similar amount of tar & other carcinogens.


nd


As a reminder, 22  Century has already attempted to get a MRTP designation and
failed. (2016 10-K pg 8).

Previous Article on XXII:


Investors need their questions answered:


Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market
by 47%. 


The one positive development for 22  Century Group has come from their minority
stake in Anandia Laboratories. Anandia was purchased by Aurora Cannabis in an all
stock deal (they exchanged 12,716,482 shares and 6,358,210 warrants) in August 2018
(link). We estimate that XXII’s 14.8% stake in Anandia Labs would amount to 1.88m
shares and 941k warrants (with a $9.37 strike price) to be worth about $15 million if they
sold & exercised all their shares today. Depending on if XXII has held their Aurora
shares, they should also have a small investment (~$85k) in Australis Capital.

Please see our earlier XXII article on Seeking Alpha – 22  Century - Cutting Through
the Smoke & Hype for a more complete list of all the red flags that an investor needs to
be aware of before considering investing in XXII. We introduce investors to XXII’s history
of a reverse merger & paid stock promotion, analyze their failed MRTP application and
failed phase II-B trials of X-22, compare XXII’s patents & products with competitors, go
through the dismal fundamentals of XXII’s business, analyze a major tobacco company
giving up a cheap option on XXII’s patents, and more.

Is the company aware of an SEC investigation? If so what exactly is the SEC looking
into, and why haven’t the SEC's "on-going enforcement proceedings" been disclosed to
shareholders?


Why is the company still involved with IRTH Communications and a network of
promotional authors?
