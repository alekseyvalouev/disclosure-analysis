China Sky Confusion: Pricewaterhouse Engaged
as Non-Auditor and Management’s Circular
Answers.


Posted on May 19, 2009 by Asensio.com


Today China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) issued a press


release stating that it had engaged Pricewaterhouse Coopers to


assist the company in complying with the financial reporting and


control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Pricewaterhouse


will not become the company’s auditor. China Sky is only engaging


the firm as a consultant.


If China Sky wanted to truly improve its financial reporting, why


would it not just retain Pricewaterhouse as its external auditor?


Does this mean that the company is admitting faults in its financial


control?


Oddly, on May 15 China Sky’s management stated that they would


not retain a Big 4 firm as auditor. This statement was made in China


Sky’s first quarter earnings conference call. One analyst on the call


asked specifically whether the company would consider hiring one


of the Big Four accounting firms to conduct its audit, along with


hiring more experienced directors. China Sky management stated


in response that the company’s chairman “doesn’t think it’s


appropriate to change auditing firms that often,” and that the


company will not be changing anytime soon.


Reports previously issued by asensio.com pointed out that China


Sky had four auditors at different times in the past three years, with


each auditor having a history of deficiencies, and that the company


had appointed a 25 year-old graduate student to serve on its board


and audit committee as a “financial expert.”


Apparently the issue of appropriateness did not occur to CSKI


management when it changed auditors three times in three years.

Crocker Coulson, China Sky’s outside investor relations


representative, thereafter stated on the call that in his experience


smaller auditing firms provided better “service” to companies like


China Sky. Mr. Coulson did not specify what services CSKI’s current


auditor provides that are better than what could be done by a more


reputable firm.


In the conference call China Sky management responded to many


other questions on issues raised in asensio.com’s reports on China


Sky, including irregularities in inventory and gross margins.


Though China Sky’s management answered questions, their


responses did not provide much clarity on the serious issues facing


the company.


A report issued by asensio.com on May 15 pointed out the


continuing inconsistency in China Sky’s gross margins evident in


the first quarter earnings. China Sky’s sales of contract products,


manufactured by other companies, decreased to 0% of sales in the


first quarter of 2009 from more than 20% in the same period of


2008, while gross margin remained nearly constant. An analyst


asked China Sky management about this directly. The company’s


explanation was that contract sales had gross margins that were


only 2% lower than the company’s own products.


Several people on the call asked China Sky management about the


company’s low inventory levels, what is perhaps the most clearly


problematic issue in China Sky’s financial disclosures.


China Sky’s management provided some long-winded, circular


responses, but their basic claim was that China Sky can push its


inventory off onto customers and suppliers. If the process of


pushing inventory off onto customers and suppliers were indeed


the case, it would mean that the company should be reporting


deposits from customers and deposits to suppliers as separate line


items on the balance sheet. The only comparable entry in CSKI’s


latest Form 10-Q is for “Prepaid and other current assets,” totaling


$77,726. The notes to the financial statements provide no


explanation as to what these prepaid and other assets are precisely.


However, if it represented prepayments for product, then $77,726


seems an especially small number for the type of prepayment


system that CSKI management alluded to, especially given that the


company reported more than $24 million in sales for the first


quarter.


China Sky management made further puzzling statements


concerning its customer and distributor relationships. Management


referred to two of its three major customers as “sales agents.” Sales


agents are typically distinct from distributors. It would be highly


irregular for a sales agent to maintain the type of relationship

where products are pre-purchased, as CSKI management stated was


the case in response to questions on inventory.


Trying to find logical explanations to reconcile China Sky’s various


disclosures and management statements can be like running


around in circles. More explanation provided by the company only


results in more confusion.
