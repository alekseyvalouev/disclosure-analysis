Veeva Systems: A Top 20 Competitive Displacement, Customer
Dissatisfaction, DB Markets Research, And Strange Coincidences

Summary


A recent multiple territory top 20 Pharma CRM competitive displacement is further
evidence of major cracks in an already well documented overhyped story.


Publicly available feedback indicates customer satisfaction, much like Veeva's TAM,
is also overstated.


All the events around this IPO raise serious questions regarding timing and
adequacy of disclosures, omissions of material risks, and serious Chinese wall
related conflicts on Wall Street.


Veeva Systems: A Top 20 Competitive Displacement, Customer Dissatisfaction, DB
Markets Research, and Strange Coincidences


If recent actions are any indicator, it appears everyone involved with the Veeva
(NYSE:VEEV) IPO simply has decided the time has come to drop CRM and move onto
Veeva's other new and exciting product lines. Basically, let's just forget the debate around
the 95% of revenue business and focus on the less than 5% stuff. Granted we don't think
any of the institutions that are long this stock realized they were going to become venture
capitalists overnight, but that appears to be what Veeva's underwriters want them to do.
Anyway, with that in mind, here is some real 'research' for investors in Veeva.


Veeva Top 20 Competitive Displacement 2.0


Our initial Veeva short thesis centered around the finite and shrinking nature of the life
sciences CRM market. We concluded that the stock was a great short even if Veeva could
eventually capture every seat in the top 50. However, as is often the case, we quickly
realized that our LS CRM landslide assumption was a little too presumptuous on our part.
When we discovered the Roche/Genentech SFDC customization move (material news
which Veeva did not feel compelled to share until we broke it here on Seeking Alpha), we
quickly concluded that there would be some top 50 pharma CRM seats that would never
be available to Veeva. This realization led us to map out the entire top 50 by sales rep
count, geography, and CRM vendor. After which we developed a very firm grasp of the
competitive environment in the LS CRM space. We discovered the pharmas who had

passed on Veeva for the longest time, and also learned more about their IT vendor
relationships. We also came across examples of split geographies (Merck deploying
Oracle in 40 countries despite already being on Veeva is one of those) as well as some
head-to-head losses against Cegedim for business you'd expect Veeva to win. Suffice to
say we quickly discovered this was a much more competitive market than originally
thought. The only thing we did not come across in this process was an example of top 50
pharma deploying Veeva CRM, and then choosing to turn around replace it with a
competitor's solution (non-custom sfdc build). Not exactly surprising as Veeva has been in
a land grab phase, but then again not exactly inconceivable with 1-year contracts and a
very competitive market. Well, that is no longer the case. As you can see from the below
screen shot, Interactive Medica has recently displaced a Veeva system in multiple
territories of a top 20 pharma.


Suffice to say when we discovered this we were pretty shocked. The top 20 displacement
element was more than enough to catch our eye, but the fact that the displacement was to
a smaller competitor was even more surprising. Veeva is clearly a lot more vulnerable
than we initially thought.


This is also interesting because Veeva's CEO has repeatedly said:


"Customer dissatisfaction is my opportunity."-Veeva CEO

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2135213-veeva-systems-a-top-20-competitive-displacement-customer-dissatisfaction-db-markets-research-and-strange-coincidences


Well, it would appear that in this case the exact opposite is true. Customer dissatisfaction
is now clearly Veeva's competitors' opportunity.


Customer Dissatisfaction


Veeva is no longer the young upstart in this space, even if they still want to market
themselves in that way from a PR perspective. They are now the big dog/evil empire that
everyone will be coming after, and the IT provider pharma reps seemingly love to hate.


To fully grasp this shift you need to simply spend some time on Cafepharma.com and read
some of the Veeva related threads in the boards of the top 20 pharma companies.


One that jumps out is the rather blunt Bohringer Ingelheim 'Veeva Sucks' thread. This
thread started in July of 2013 and is still going strong with the total posts now up to 70.

best equipment --- as if it's for us!


You're right. They claim Veeva makes us more "customer-centric." How? By re-packaging the same


presentations we used to have on paper? By making it harder to find a doc's prescribing patterns?


No, they now can tell, if they want to take the time to find out, how long you spent on each screen,


how long was the time between the presentations and the signature, and probably tons of other stuff


we can't even begin to imagine. Bells and whistles, that's all.

Re: Veeva Sucks


I only use this when my manager is with me. Every time I take it out I cringe. Not only is it


embarrassing but horrible technology and has 0 value.


I would even say that it decreases value since docs hate it and half of them find it ridiculous. The


other half are more interested in asking questions about the technology than listening to our


messages. Either way its a no win situation. Who was responsible for bringing this here? Sales,


Marketing, training?

We lost excellent people. It was terrible.  


The WH division does not look remotely similar to that anymore. The pay is now higher and the


products are moving in a different direction. The sales model will change. It takes this company a


long time to get anything done. Good luck. I hope they toss Veeva soon. Its non-usable.


They keep saying the sales model has changed, but nothing has really changed. Yes, higher target


bonus, but that means nothing with crazy quotas. It's the same old big pharma crap. All these spread


sheets, BS LIFT program, Veeva, etc., just proves that. They are quickly driving Essure into the


ground. And as soon as Levosert launches, Mirena and Skyla will be old news.

If you have not perceived change, my guess is you have a Legacy Bayer manager. I have not once


been asked to fill out a spreadsheet. I no longer have a call R&F goal. I call on accounts and not


individuals. I will continue to pound them with feedback that Veeva is a joke and completely


inaccurate. It will take time but I am confident that is next to change. What is your day like? Sounds


like it sucks. This job depends entirely on your manager.


For those looking for more of this rep sounding off, there is the Eli Lilly thread titled, "New
CRM System- Is this how we feel?". This thread was started in response to an award Eli
Lilly won from Information Week for their move to Veeva CRM. Clearly the field is not
nearly as happy with Veeva or the Ipad as the IT world is. There are plenty more of these
tidbits online, but heaven forbid someone researching this would actually go out and look
for rep feedback to assess customer satisfaction or the 'airtight' nature of Veeva's CRM
story.And then you have comments like these on a recent Bayer thread


Anyway, you get our point. There may be a lot of consultants and CIO's who are happy
with Veeva, but the picture from the sales rep end is not nearly as rosy. Some of this is
probably a blowback as reps resist change, but when you consider how current these
threads are and the fact that these people are actually going online to vent about this,
well, a decision to switch off of Veeva to a smaller competitor no longer seems like such a
shocker.


Deutsche Bank Markets Research on Veeva


It is now pretty clear that Veeva's underwriters are working overtime to shift the
conversation over Veeva to Vault and Networks potential. We admire their efforts, but as
has been the case along their execution leaves much to be desired.


From the first page of DB'S new Veeva note:

Reaffirm BUY Rating and Lowering PT to $34


Veeva shares are now 53% below their $46 peak and are down by ~35% since the high-
valuation software started rolling over in early March. At $280m our conservative FY15
revenue estimate and $63.2m estimated FCF, Veeva shares seem reasonably priced at
8.5x 2015 sales/ 33x FCF, given the growth profile (79% y/y subscription billings growth in
4QF14), although we're lowering our PT to $34 (13x FY15 revenues) given the re-rating of
the broader peer group.


Usually we need to read at least a few pages before some glaring error or faulty analysis
jumps out at us, but DB managed to accomplish this task by page one. The statement
that,


" Veeva shares seem reasonably priced at 8.5x 2015 sales/33x FCF, given the growth
profile (79% y/y subscription billings growth in 4QF14), although we're lowering our PT to
$34 (13x FY15 revenues) given the re-rating of the broader peer group"


was just too much to ignore. Although we will point out, it is just about the first time we
have agreed with any of the Veeva analysts on something. Yes we do concur; Veeva
shares would seem more reasonably priced at 8.5x 2015 sales.


The only problem with that statement is that such a valuation is appx 30% below
where Veeva is currently trading!


Based on DB's $280 million estimate Veeva is actually trading at 12x FY2015 estimated
sales. Of course you can figure this error out by page 2 of their report (as they are clearly
using a 145mln share count), but why bother with proof reading when you are trying to
spin your way out of a mess. At their $34 price target, Veeva would trade at 17.6x FY2015
estimated sales and not 13x.


But for those looking for a more reasonably valued tech stock, we suggest comparing
Veeva to Linkedin (LNKD). With 25% adj EBITDA margins and a forecast consensus top-
line of 38.4% for 2014, Linkedin currently trades at 8.9x forward EV/Sales. This is pretty
shocking considering managment makes Veeva Crm's future sound something more like
the Linkedin of Pharma. What credible investor wouldn't rather own Linkedin's propreitary
global scalable platform over Veeva's value added reseller driven model at this current
disparity. Veeva, with its 26% adj EBITDA margins and forecast 30% top-line growth rate,
should be trading at a meaningful discount to Linkedin instead of its current signficant
premium, no questions asked.


Of course basic math and valuation mistakes are not the only problem here.

Two other things that caught our eye


1. Vault TAM- They put this at $1.5 billion which we guess is an accomplishment for us
even if it is still way off, but their logic here is quite amusing. They found multiple
sources that put the TAM below a $1 billion, and one source that put it at $1.5 billion.
So what TAM do they use? The $1.5 billion one of course. Forget the fact that we have
spoken to a over a dozen people in this space and still not found a single one that
would say LS ECM is at least $1 billion. We also found DB's comments regarding
Nextdocs being 20% penetrated in the top 200 pharma interesting from a TAM
perspective considering our research indicates their revenues are less than $50
million. Also, as has been the case with everything else, we got no comments
addressing material points we have raised regarding Vault TAM in multiple reports.


2. Oracle could acquire Veeva-


"Likewise, this made us wonder if Oracle will eventually put Veeva on its acquisition target
list, as a means to scale its cloud suite, compete more effectively against SFDC in the
cloud CRM space, and augment its Phase Forward CTMS system (acquired in 2010) that
competes with Medidata." DB on Veev, April 7, 2014(pg 7)


This quote left us wondering whether these analysts understand anything at all about this
space. We'd really like to know what Oracle would be buying here? A company that
derives 95% of its revenue being a value added re-seller on the Force.com platform. If
Larry Ellison has constantly taken shots at SFDC being nothing more than a thin layer on
top of Oracle, what exactly do you think his opinion of a contractually obligated SFDC
Force.com value added re-seller would be? If Oracle wants to make a move here they
won't waste their time with Veeva, they will simply buy SFDC. Because at this point buying
Veeva does nothing as it immediately turns SFDC into a direct competitor. A critical
component of the SFDC relationship with Veeva is about being able to sell their other
services into these platform customers. On the other hand we will give DB credit for
acknowledging that Medidata (NASDAQ:MDSO) might become a Vault competitor soon.
Considering their penetration into clinical cloud and the cash on hand, we don't think it will
be long before they make a push into Veeva's turf to quell what we can imagine will soon
be questions regarding the penetration of their TAM.


Honestly, this report is simply embarrassing. Careless valuation errors (not the first time
from DB as we still firmly believe they are the main culprits behind this TAM debacle with
their Cegedim math mistakes) and faulty analysis are bad enough, but to have this

happen when you clearly know your work is going to be put under the microscope is
simply inexcusable. If we were Veeva, we'd kindly ask these analysts to stop
publishing on us as they are doing more bad than good.


Strange IPO Coincidences


1. Veeva's IPO was timed to coincide with significant penetration in the CRM market and
a large decline in their revenue growth rate.


2. The IPO was also timed to directly precede a material and quite unfavorable
modification of the Salesforce.com contract.


3. Throughout the entire offering period and up until we called attention to it, Veeva
happily promoted Genentech as a customer on their website. This was despite the fact
that they had ceased being a customer as of July 31, 2013. Furthermore, their S-1
included ZERO disclosures regarding the risks of losing pharma customers to custom
built solutions on the SFDC force.com platform. A risk that is quite material for a value
added reseller that derives 95% of its revenue from a product built on top of this
platform, and one they clearly were already aware of.


4. Insiders have published multiple articles in the media that compare Veeva's vertically
focused SAAS business to horizontal SAAS models without clarifying that Veeva is not
a pure vertical. To say that verticals are the new horizontals is extremely misleading
when said vertical is entirely dependent on a re-seller agreement with the worlds
leading cloud based horizontal CRM provider. "Hey, our model is far superior to that of
horizontal SAAS players as long as the leading horizontal allows us to use their
infrastructure, IP, and established credibility to build our entire business."


5. The underwriters waived Veeva's lock-up restrictions to allow for a secondary a mere
few weeks before the lock-up was set to expire. Two days after this secondary closed
SFDC announced their new vertical focused strategy (Todd Pierce, the former
Genentech CIO, will be heading up their Life Sciences/Healthcare Vertical). The
underwriters collected $11+ million in fees for this work.


Does this all strike you as a coincidence?


If you answered yes, you have a bright future as a sells-side analyst covering Veeva.
