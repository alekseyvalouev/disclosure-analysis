A Windfall Or A Whiff? ClearSign's Kern County Prospects May Be
Less Than Golden

Summary


Lou Basenese speculates that pending environmental changes in Kern County could
account for $156 million in revenues.


A close reading of the prospective regulations in Kern County does not bear this out.


Even if Mr. Basenese's overly optimistic revenue assumptions were true, ClearSign
would still be grossly overvalued.


This article provides a counterbalance to the opinions and representations made by Mr.
Louis Basenese in his September 9, 2015, Seeking Alpha article entitled "ClearSign
Combustion: California Regulator Poised To Deliver A $156 Million Sales Windfall?"


Mr. Basenese presents Kern County's plans with regards to the products of ClearSign
Combustion Coporation (NASDAQ:CLIR) as all but finalized. In fact, Kern County is only
part way through the multi-step process of reviewing environmental matters. While county
has drafted revised ordinances that might favor CLIR, the county is legally required to
consider many alternatives. Only one of the six alternatives under consideration would
require the use of the particular technology which CLIR hopes to sell.


Mr. Basenese writes that:


"We could be less than six months away from such a monumental regulatory ruling,
whereby operators will be required to install CLIR's Duplex burner on all new and
existing once-through-steam generators (OTSG)."


This is incorrect. The July 8, 2015, Kern County Draft Environmental Impact Report
(DEIR) that Mr. Basenese cites in his article actually states that:


"All new and replacement steam generators for thermal EOR activities would be
required to implement low-emission steam generation technology, such as the
ClearSign Duplex Tile combustion technology or the equivalent." [emphasis added]

Thus the DEIR references CLIR products only as an example of what might eventually be
mandated. This sentence is the one and only mention of "ClearSign" in the 1,876 page
report (see above links).


The Kern County DEIR leaves the door open for the implementation of technologies other
than those produced by CLIR. There are many alternative emission reduction
technologies for OSTG other than those developed by CLIR. Other producers of such
technologies include Coen QLN-II and North American Magna-Flame LE.


Prior to its September 2015 agreement with Aera Energy LLC, CLIR had never
successfully sold its Duplex™ Technology. Would Kern County, home to 50,000 oil- and
gas-related jobs, pass regulations mandating that the energy companies within its
boundaries use a product with such a limited track record?


Mr. Basenese assumes that CLIR will achieve an average selling price of $200,000 per
Duplex system. On the Q1 2015 earnings call, CLIR Chief Executive Officer Stephen
Pirnat said that the revenue opportunity per OTSG could be "as small as $50,000 and
could be as high as $350,000. So, to taking that and extrapolating it for some meaningful
revenue stream would be pretty difficult." If the CEO of CLIR isn't confident projecting
revenue per unit, then how can Mr. Basenese purport to do just that?


Mr. Basenese says that the revenue potential for CLIR in Kern County is "more than $150
million in sales". He would seem to derive this by multiplying an average selling price of
$200,000 by an installed base of 782 OTSGs. However, according to the DEIR, the
relevant alternative plan (which, again, references CLIR only as an example) would apply
only to new OTSGs and those installed before 1990. To be clear, OTSGs installed after
1990 will not require replacement. This fact plainly contravenes Mr. Basenese's statement
that the DEIR will require replacement "on every existing OTSG…within five years".


Our September 16, 2015, conversation with CLIR's Chief Financial Officer James Harmon
reflected a decidedly less optimistic tone. To paraphrase, Mr. Harmon stated that he was
not as optimistic as Mr. Basenese in his belief that the new environmental ruling would
cover the entire installed base in Kern County. Mr. Harmon reflected that the
environmental rules were written in an unclear way, so it would be challenging to predict
the outcome.


Mr. Basnese's enthusiasm for its regulators aside, it should be noted that Kern County's
production of oil has been in decline since 2000. This is hardly a booming market.

Let us suspend reality and pretend for a moment that the rosy revenue assumptions and
incorrect regulatory forecast of Mr. Basenese were possible. Such would imply a revenue
opportunity of $150 million for CLIR, supposing (contrary to the published plan) that the
county were to require installation of CLIR products on all of its OTSGs over the next five
years. Let us assume this revenue is distributed evenly at $30 million per year for the next
five. Even on this basis, CLIR would be far overvalued relative to peers, which currently
trade at about half of sales:


CLIR comparable valuation as of Sep 21, 2015


[Source: Bloomberg LLP, CECE & BW "2016E Revenue" reflect consensus estimates as
of 09/21/2015]


Looking at CLIR beyond the hype of the Kern County proposal does not increase one's
confidence in the company. Despite its $71-million market cap, CLIR has generated a
paltry total of $93,000 of revenue in its 14 quarters as a public company. These were "co-
development revenues" of $50,000 and $43,000 in Q3 and Q4 of 2013, respectively. They
were generated as the result of a working group formed with Covanta to "accelerate
commercialization of the company's Electrodynamic Combustion Control™ ("ECC™")
technology". To date, every other promised commercialization of CLIR has remained just
that, a promise. (Revenue data from Bloomberg. Covanta press release viewable here)
