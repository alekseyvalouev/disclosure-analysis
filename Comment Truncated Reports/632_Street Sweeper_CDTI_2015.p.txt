Clean Diesel Technologies: Burning Cash, Emitting Spotty History
And Financials

Summary


The big three - revenue, operating losses and gross margins - all worsened for CDTI
last quarter amid the auditor's substantial doubts about the company's ability to
continue as a going concern.


CDTI has survived primarily on debt, selling assets and stock offerings, including two
offerings in 2014. Burning cash, CDTI appears to be on the verge of a more potential
dilution.


The company's tax credit and loss issues arising out of a merger, emissions funding
challenges, executive turnover and history of troubles with federal regulators add to
the unfortunate mix.


If a company's business is so flimsy that optimistic analysts must resort to commenting on
the company's "body language" for good results, you know you're in for a ride.


But if you dare look past Clean Diesel Technologies' (NASDAQ:CDTI) body language into
the financials, rapidly dying legacy products, the emissions funding problems, lost tax
credits, fleeing CFO, historical allegations of behavior believed detrimental to
shareholders validated by federal regulators' orders - and SEC charges against a CDTI
promoter - you know it has all the markings of one short, unforgettable, miserable ride.


CDTI manufactures and distributes emission control systems and products for the light-
duty vehicle and heavy-duty diesel market. The bull thesis contends the company will
make progress in transforming its business and will make commercial strides with its
DuraFit offering. Roth Capital, which notes it expects to receive or intends to seek
business with CDTI in the next three months, reiterated its "buy" rating in a research
report sent to investors Wednesday morning. With the stock sitting at about $2.17, Roth
set a $2.50 price target.

CDTI and why we think the stock price should collapse.


Terrible Financials

Investors may see in the table below that CDTI's financial picture worsened in all three
important areas:


Clean Diesel Tech. (CDTI) Q1 2015 Q1 2014


Revenue $10.3 million $11.6 million


Operating Loss -$2.7 million -$1.5 million


Gross Margin 27% 32%


(Source: SEC filings)


The company's total losses zoomed up to $194 million. Earnings per share for 2014
remained in the red at -$0.78. Indeed, CDTI's independent auditor has "expressed
substantial doubt about CDTI's ability to continue as a going concern."


Unfortunately, the company is expected to continue spilling red ink on investors. Check
out what normally optimistic analysts anticipate:

At the same time, CDTI is torching its cash even faster than this time last year:


Clean Diesel Tech. Q1 2015 Q1 2014


Cash $4.3 million $3.6 million


Cash Burn $3.0 million $ 1.5 million

Dilution Machine


So, at this rate, we imagine CDTI is gunning its dilution engine. We're watching for another
potentially dilutive stock offering right away. Filing footnotes show that's the way the
company has always done business.


Along with borrowing, credit facilities, and selling off its Nevada exhaust parts business,
CDTI says it is staying alive with stock offerings. It has offered millions of shares of stock
under a shelf registration - first in 2013. In 2014, it ripped out blocks totaling ~$11 million
worth of stock in April and November.


The shelf registration allows for $50 million in stock offerings. So, look out below! There's
plenty of room left for more potential dilution.


Like Other Big Diluters


Retail investors now are thanking TheStreetSweeper for warning them just Wednesday
about a similar stock - Gevo (NASDAQ:GEVO). Much like CDTI, bad financials pointed to
the inevitable. And about 2 1/2 hours after TheStreetSweeper's warning that a potentially
dilutive offering loomed - Wham! Gevo ripped out a stock offering and now the stock is
down over 20 percent in 48 hours.


That Gevo warning followed our tweet on Monday about Viggle (VGGL). We noted its
stock rally, but also massive debt, low cash and going concern issues, thinking Viggle
would issue stock soon. Sure enough, Viggle issued stock two days later, sending the $4
shares crashing to ~$3.


Legacy Technology Dying Faster Than Anticipated


CDTI is hoping its new DuraFit will help take up the slack for the declining diesel retrofit
business. But its own filings portray the increasing misery here:


"…we launched DuraFit™ to take advantage of the emerging market opportunity in
replacement diesel particulate filters and to drive near-term sales. Our legacy diesel-
retrofit business, however, declined much more than expected, negatively
impacting our financial results for the year. While we are disappointed with our
2014 financial performance, we are pleased with the progress we have made
advancing our technology initiatives."


Emissions Funding Gets Cut

CDTI has relied upon tighter emission standards and emissions control programs to help
generate money. But CDTI is losing access to those matters, as its SEC filing explains so
well. Please see the full notation on page 13:


"Future growth of our business depends in part on the general availability of funding
for emissions control programs, which can be affected for economic as well as
political reasons. For example, in light of the recent budget crisis in California,
funding was not available … its start date was pushed back. Additionally, funding for
the EPA's Diesel Emissions Reductions Act, or DERA, for 2014 has been
substantially reduced … future funding remains uncertain…"


Extreme Dependence on One Customer Backfires


Honda's (NYSE:HMC) motorcycle division reached an agreement in 2010 with CDTI for
developing ZPGM catalysts. Disappointingly, that was a purchase order arrangement.
Unfortunately, the deal expired in March 2014. Read the notation on page 14:


"Manufacturers typically seek to have two or more sources of critical components;
however, there can be no assurance that manufacturers for which we are a shared
supplier will not sole source the products we supply."


Merger Issues: Damages Loss Carryforwards, Tax Credits


These days, CDTI can't even seem to catch a break-even when it's losing millions and
grasping at tax loss straws:


"The Merger adversely affects our ability to take advantage of the significant
U.S. federal tax loss carryforwards and tax credits accumulated.


... our ability to use our net operating losses and credits in future tax years has been
significantly limited. In addition, due to the "ownership change," our federal
research and development credits have also been limited and, consequently, we do
not anticipate being able to use any of these credits that existed as of the date of the
Merger in future tax years."


And, this time, the stock offerings may hurt not just those poor souls holding the stock, but
the company itself:

"Our limited ability to use these net operating losses and tax credits as a result of the
Merger or otherwise, including as a result of equity offerings subsequent to the
Merger, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations."


Executives Suddenly Resign


Often, an early sign of big trouble is a sudden executive departure. And CDTI has had its
CEO resign to "pursue other opportunities" in December 2013, along with the Chairman
and the CFO in 2014.


Maybe CDTI had set itself up for problems with its creation of the "Office of the CEO"
which two people shared. After an apparent blowup, Nikhil Mehta suddenly resigned "for
good reason," six months after serving as part of the Office of the CEO. The board axed
the Office of the CEO and appointed Christopher J. Harris to serve as president and chief
executive on July 2, 2014. On July 31, 2014, Mr. Mehta resigned.


As it turns out, Mr. Mehta wasn't the first CFO who has butted heads with CDTI.


Fined: Fires CFO for Reporting Conduct Believed Detrimental to Shareholders


Financial and ethical concerns raised by a proposed merger got a former CFO fired when
he reported them to directors. The US Labor Department's OSHA investigated the
whistleblower's allegations in 2010 and ordered the company to fork out $1.9 million.


According to the Labor Department's September 2013 announcement:


"The former CFO believed that a proposed merger was: detrimental to the company,
critical financial information had been withheld from board members, and the conflict
of interest violated internal company controls mandated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as well as the company's own corporate code of ethics."


None less than the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Dr.
David Michaels sent a strong warning to CDTI.


"We protect those who are courageous enough to speak out, even internally, about
violations of securities rules and regulations."


Dr. Michaels added:

"This order should send a clear message to publicly traded companies that silencing
those who try to do the right thing is unacceptable."


SEC Charges: Investor Relations Firm Partner, CDTI Promoter


Thirteen times between June 20, 2013, and July 7, 2014, the name Kevin M. McGrath
appears as the contact person for more information on CDTI's financial information in SEC
filings. An example is here. About two weeks after the last filing bearing Mr. McGrath's
name, the SEC issued a press release headlined: "SEC Charges Investor Relations
Executive With Insider Trading While Preparing Clients' Press Releases."


The SEC charged Mr. McGrath with insider trading on confidential information he learned
about CDTI and another client, MISONIX, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSON) while he helped prepare
their press releases.


"McGrath used one hand to help clients draft their press releases while using the other to
trade illegally in their stock," said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC's
New York Regional Office.


The SEC alleged that Mr. McGrath worked on a press release announcing a big CDTI
order and minutes after finding out on May 24, 2011, that the press release would be
issued the next day, he bought 1,000 shares of stock. On the stock rise, he sold and
profited over $6,000, according to the release. Mr. McGrath agreed to pay $25,044 to
settle the charges. Such results are one more reason investors should be cautious
whenever they see hype coming from companies.


Conclusion


So, CDTI's stock has rallied lately as the market forgets or remains unknowledgeable
about the company's history, prospects, financials, going concern issues, cash burn and
dilution engine. We believe the weak bull thesis and all the "body language" in the world
will become quite unimportant amid the screams of investors who'll ultimately be left
holding the bag.


Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in CDTI
and stand to profit on any future declines in the stock price.
