Giant Interactive (NYSE:GA), a Chinese online game company, announced its
preliminary results for Q3 yesterday morning. It sees its quarterly sales between $40
million and $43 million, which is lower than its guidance of $45 to $50 million issued on
August 18th.


This result is very disappointing given that the
previous guidance was a disappointment to begin
with when the Street was expecting $58 million
before the last earning report. Merely 40 days later,
Giant found that it was at least 10% below the
forecast. If we assume that Giant management was
telling the truth on August 18th and Giant was on
track to make its forecasted revenue at that time, then its running rate after August 18th
further deteriorated to probably 20% below what was expected.


In the conference call yesterday, the management claimed that compared to the Q2,
ARPU declined teen digits percent wise, APC (Average Paying Customer) declined
single digit, PCU (Peak Concurrent User) lowered teen digits, and ACU (Average
Concurrent User) lowered high single digits.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


One big reason for the decline is that Giant stopped selling "Lottery Box" in the games
due to the government regulation. According to the management, the impact of the
discontinuing selling "Lottery Box" rippled into the playability of the games, and thus
caused higher revenue reduction than expected.


Looking forward, Giant has four games coming out in the fourth quarter, and Giant is
likely to see the revenue decline continue into Q4 since none of them will contribute
materially to the revenue but incur marketing cost. Out of the four games, the CEO
believes that ZT online Green, a variation of its flagship product, ZT online, is the most
promising product.


The net cash position of Giant is roughly $3.30, half of the close price yesterday. I
expect that EPS for Q3 come in at 10 cents, with a lower guidance of Q4.


Giant looks a good candidate to short due to the following several reasons:


It is heavily dependent on ZT and its derived game series. This is a typical case of
one trick pony.


1.


While the reduced ARPU is a welcome signal, the user number reduction is rather
alarming. It is not a trend Giant can easily reverse. The high base number for ZT
makes compensation from newer games very difficult.


2.


Giant has no proven new games even though it has games in its pipeline. These
days which game company does not have several games in its pipeline?


3.


Giant's stock price dropped 12.5% yesterday, and it looks like its downward channel is
just opening up.
