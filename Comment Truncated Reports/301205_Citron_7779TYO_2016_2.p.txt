Citron Research Calls on  Japan’s  
Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission  


to Immediately Initiate Investigation  
of Cyberdyne CEO  


For Materially Misleading Claims  


 
Cyberdyne Is Intentionally Misleading Investors  





Japan’s SESC should immediately investigate statements that are being made on the Cyberdyne 
(TYO:7779) website by its CEO for the purpose of deceiving investors.   
 


In a recent interview Dr. Yoshiyuki Sankai stated,

This statement is an utter falsehood. ReWalk, a competitor with a market cap of less than $100 
million USD, is covered by insurance in both United States and Germany.  ReWalk’s exoskeleton 
is also approved by the Veterans Administration in the U.S.

“What makes HAL unique is the fact that HAL is the only device in the world 
covered by public medical insurance, meaning HAL successfully provided 
enough medical evidence worthy of coverage.”

The HAL suit has been around for over 10 years and only has 104 full devices in operation.  This 
compares to Rewalk who has been around for 5 years with 269 devices in operation.  
Cyberdyne’s market cap is over $3 billion. ReWalk’s is $80 million. 
 


Cyberdyne is going to 300¥.  That is the TRUTH. 
 


  Money Does Not Lie – Cyberdyne Does 
 


In the same interview Sankai makes the claim: 
 





http://www.cyberdyne.jp/wp_uploads/2016/08/Analyst_Interview_CYBERDYNEs-Challenges-to-Shape-the-Future.pdf 


 
This statement makes investors think that Cyberdyne is the way of the future…  


But it is Not the Truth.   
 


The reality is that of the 221 stocks on the Japanese Mothers index with R&D budgets of over 
$1 million, Cyberdyne has the lowest percentage of Research and 
Development expenditure compared to market capitalization.   
This is a company that is supposed to change the future? 
 


 Analysts Aiding and Abetting  
 


And we thought Japan has a zero tolerance policy on drugs?  After reading the analysts’ reports 
it seems that the only way they can come to such crazy conclusions would be if they were 
smoking something illegal.  Most recent, the Citi analyst stated, 
 





"We also note that Cyberdyne manages operational data on HAL and all its 
other devices in a comprehensive manner, and aims to become a world-
class AI company. Its rivals, therefore, are not those firms that produce 
apparently similar devices but IT companies.” 
” 


 -- Cyberdyne CEO Yoshiyuki Sankai,  
August 2016  


“… for CYBERDYNE, the field of robotics is only a part of its business field. 
CYBERDYNE is a company that solves social problems using innovative 
Cybernic systems, and establishes new markets through advancements of 
innovation.”

What evidence does he have to make this statement? The company has never sold or 
developed anything that is even close to world class Artificial Intelligence.  Mr. Analysts should 
go chase some Pokemons and stop discussing the stock market! 
 


The Lies Continue 
 


    Cyberdyne (TYO:7779) came out with a response to Citron's story.  Sadly, management 
continues its attempt to confuse investors.  
 


Cyberdyne is lying about what the links state in the rebuttal they posted. 
http://www.cyberdyne.jp/company/download/20160819_tekijikaiji_en.pdf 
 


Cyberdyne compares ReWalk and EksoBionics FDA de novo application times to approvals (12 
and 15 months) with their own 510(K) (simpler) FDA approval process, which has been now 
bumping along for over 14 months.   
 


Instead the should be comparing THE SAME application which we clearly show that Rewalk and 
Ekso received their 510(K) approvals in 3.5 and 2.5 months.  The FDA states that their official 
guideline is to reply to 510(K) applications within 90 days, and their average approval is 5 
months.  So  again, something unexplained is definitely going on over at Cyberdyne -- their 14 
month 510(K) application is definitely unusual, and should be compared to the timespans 
above. 
 


As for their product being new and unlike any other technology,  you cannot have it both ways.  
The fact that they filed a 510(k) approval says it all.  According to the FDA a 510(k) is for a 


device that is “substantially equivalent” 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/
PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/ 
 


Any hope of them stating they have a new device went away when they switched their 
application from de novo. 
 
But who cares if they do get 510(k) approval?  Both of there US competitors have de novo AND 
510(K) approvals, yet have market caps of $90 mil U.S. (1/40


th
 the market cap of Cyberdyne)  


Yes that is correct 1/40
th


!  This shows that even with FDA approval, Cyberdyne will go down to 
300¥ per share.  
 


How has HAL sold in Japan or Germany?  It is time for management to start being accountable 
to the many years of empty promises they have made to investors. 
 


We will see you at 300¥. 
 


Cautious Investing to All
