Misleading Statistics


ResTORbio is a Boston, MA company that went public in January 2018. In the aging
science community, the company has been closely watched and admired as they are
the most mature company targeting the Molecular Target of Rapamyacin (MTOR). Early
animal studies demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors such as rapapmyacin were capable
of drastically extending the life and healthspan of laboratory mice.


mTOR inhibitors are still hyped by many legitimate scientists, hardcore life extension
enthusiasts, and investors alike, but limitations continue to be discovered. For example,
inhibiting mTOR has substantial side-effects, likely due to mTOR’s involvement in
multiple biological processes, many of which are not yet fully understood, as well as the
need to administer high dosages of mTOR inhibitors. Therefore, in humans, it has been
difficult to identify promising indications for mTOR inhibitors. Unfortunately, many of the
most promising indications are also the most difficult to demonstrate in a clinical trial.
The most mature indication being targeted by ResTORbio is immunosenescence. Their
Phase III trials are aimed at showing lower chronic inflammation in the elderly. Doing so
is believed to help their immune system mount a more effective immune response to
foreign pathogens in order to prevent respiratory tract infections. At first glance this
approach seems promising. While seemingly contradictory, the ability of mTOR inhibition
to improve immune function in elderly animals by suppressing inflammation has been
well-documented in academic literature. Additionally, ResTORbio reported seemingly
slam dunk data from their Phase II clinical trial. However, upon closer examination, the
Phase II data is unconvincing.
At first glance, this summary of ResTORbio’s Phase II results seem tremendously
impressive: they report that the Phase IIb study reduced respiratory tract infections by
30.6% (Figure 1). This seemed too good to be true for a low dose mTOR inhibitor.
Indeed, upon closer inspection, it’s clear the numbers tell a far less convincing story. A
later slide in their recent presentation shows the breakdown between various treatment
groups and the incidence of infection (Figure 2). Out of four treatment groups, only 2
groups actually decreased the risk of infection. Of those 2 groups, only one showed a
statistically significant reduction from the control group. This group (RTB101 10MG QD)
was, of course, chosen for use in the Phase III study. Interestingly, when comparing
treatment groups to one another, the treatment group chosen to advance to Phase III
actually had a very similar incidence rate to the treatment and placebo groups in the
North American cohort. It is only because the South American Cohort had a freakishly
high incidence rate of respiratory tract infections that any difference was detected.

The Phase III trial is a target redrawn to fit data


Moreover, the conclusions we’re being sold based on the data appear to be grounded
on very weak statistics. First, throughout their data analysis they use one-way p-values.
This means that if the data turned out to be the opposite of what was “expected” it would
be judged as random, but data that supports the preconceived notion can find
statistically significant relationships with treatment. When using an immunosuppressant
to prevent infections, this is an inappropriate leap in logic. Next, no correction is made
for multiple comparisons. Typically, statistical significance is arbitrarily set at the level at
which you would only expect random chance to generate that level of difference 5% of
the time. However, you can run into problems when you are testing multiple groups.
Given 4 different treatment groups, if all the variation was entirely random, we would
expect to detect a statistically significant reduction in RTIs (using a one-way p-value) in
at least 1 group nearly 35% of the time. This false-positive rate may be even higher than
expected if the placebo cohort has an above average incidence of RTI. In short, it is not
unlikely that the difference observed between the treatment and placebo group was
entirely based on random variation.


In their presentations, ResTORbio has impressive figures showing theoretical data
about what could have happened if the Phase II study only looked at the cohort they will
be using in the Phase III. Essentially, at the conclusion of the Phase II study, they re-
drew the target around a subset of more compelling data. They found parameters that
would define a sub-population that appeared to be more positively affected by the
treatment, and called those new parameters their Phase III cohort. This belies the
scientific method and violates key principles of experimental design. They use the data
to test hypotheses that were not part of the initial experimental design, and then assume
causal relations. Figure 3 appears to show that the treatment is extremely effective for
certain sub-populations, but very ineffective for others. Specifically, it did not appear to
be effective for COPD sufferers or smokers. However, it does not tell us whether these
were all the variables considered. More importantly, the inappropriateness of one-sided
p-values in these circumstances are demonstrated clearly by figure 3. For smokers in
North America, despite the treatment increasing risk of RTI by over 400% it appears that
any differences between the treatment and placebo group are entirely random. Given
their statistical methods, the elimination of certain groups from the cohort would require
a much stronger rationale than what was provided.

In short, in my view they have cherry picked a "sub-cohort" from the Phase II data in
order to make the Phase III trial look more promising. They even goes as far as to make
a new figure of Phase II results only looking at a subset of patients that appeared to be
better responders (Figure 4). The parameters that define this subset are the new
parameters of the cohort for the ongoing phase III study. However, without a strong
rationale for selecting this subset of patients, it is impossible to tell the difference
between a genuine, reproducible phenomenon and random variation across arbitrary
parameters. It is easy to imagine how the investigators could look at an unlimited
number of attributes, after the fact, in order to define a cohort that will make the trial look
more successful. While, certain co-morbidities may appear to have a logical relationship,
the investigators could have just as easily found the intervention appeared to work best
for caucasian women between 70 and 80 years old. In fact, if we were allowed to look at
all the data collected on every patient, we could almost certainly find parameters that
define a sub-population with an even more impressive response rate. Therefore, there is
little reason to suspect that the cherry-picked cohort should continue to “over respond”
in a subsequent study.

ResTORbio has a flimsy pipeline


On top of the fundamental problems outlined above, there are more nuanced problems
with how their data is being represented. First, while the data presented in figure 4 is
supposed to reflect what the results of the phase II trial would have been if they had
used the cohort parameters that they will carry forward to the phase III study, they claim
that it is the phase III cohort and endpoint. However, the figure still shows a one-way p-
value, even though their own slides say that the phase III study will use a (more
appropriate) two-way p-value. Moreover, when we plug these numbers into an online
odds-ratio calculator, we do not come up with the same numbers that they do. Whether
or not this is intentional, this has the effect of making their phase II data look more
impressive than it was, and making the phase III study look more promising than it is.

When you go to the pipeline page in the ResTORbio website or company presentation,
the pipeline gives the same impression as their data (Figure 4).

RTB101 is one of many mTOR inhibitors


FIGURE 5. Source: ResTORbio October 2019 Company Presentation, Slide 4.


At first glance, it is impressive. On closer examination, it lacks substance. Beyond the
first two programs which are ongoing, they list two additional indications with an arrow
indicating they are beginning Phase II trials, but that is not the case. Below the figure
they have a caption that read,


*For heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, Parkinson’s Disease and certain
other infections, we may be required to file an investigational new drug application, or
IND, prior to initiating Phase II clinical trials. We expect to have the ability to initiate
these Phase II clinical trials without the need to conduct additional Phase I trials.


Thus, they have not actually begun this work. Below that, they have two discovery stage
items listed with undisclosed drugs and undisclosed indications. This is tantamount to
adding “We might be able to treat other stuff” to the bottom of the pipeline. And, even if
such indications were being actively pursued, they’re too early in the discovery pipeline
to be meaningfully relevant to ResTORbio’s near-term success or financial viability.

Risky trial design - even for a great drug


Financial losses are accelerating


It is tempting to think that a drug like RTB101 that has robust and wide ranging effects is
bound to find its place in the clinic and that even if this trial fails, someone will find value
in it. To an extent, this is true. I find it highly likely that, with time, mTOR inhibitors will
find their place in clinical practice. However, there are many mTOR inhibitors currently
being manufactured and studied either clinically or pre-clinically. Notably, Sirolimus
(Pfizer) and eRapa (Emtora) are each in clinical trials and used extensively in academic
research. This substantially diminishes any intrinsic value of the drug. Without regulatory
approval, they are unlikely to be able to outlicense their formulation for a substantial
sum, because there is substantial competition from other similar molecules. While this
does not affect their upcoming Phase III trial results, this does lower the floor for this
company if the Phase III does not go well.


Perhaps the most concerning element of the ongoing PhIII work is that the trial design is
risky, even if the drug works great. A variety of factors can contribute to substantial
annual variation in the incidence of RTIs. If we assume that drug works as well as they
have previously reported (despite our reservations about the data analysis), we must
still consider the fact that it is easier to identify a reduction in RTI incidence if the
incidence in the control group is high. The company's power analysis concludes that the
PhIII study has "≥90% power to show a 30% reduction in the percentage of patients with
clinically symptomatic respiratory illness between RTB101 and placebo using a two-
sided test at alpha of 5%" (Source: Company Presentation, Slide 27). However, it is
important to note that the power analysis necessarily assumes a specific population
level incidence of RTI. If a given year has lower incidence, the power of the study would
be reduced, and the study would be more likely to result in a false negative, even if the
drug response is actually robust.

Risk to Upside


Seeing as the company is in the clinical trial/pre-revenue stage, we will focus the
financial analysis on expenditures in light of their clinical development path. For fiscal
2018, the company reported a net loss of -$37.6 million. Forecasts for fiscal 2019 are for
a loss of between -$75-80 million, a roughly 105% increase in year-over-year losses. In
terms of free cash flow, the fiscal 2018 figure was -$35.9 million while the forecast for
fiscal 2019 is between -$52-58 million, a roughly 50% increase in year-over-year cash
burn. The range of forecasts for fiscal 2020 net loss and free cash flow are -$97-103
million and -$60-65 million, respectively, which implies year-over-year increases in
losses of roughly 28% and 17%. The company reported cash and equivalents of $117
million as of their Q3-2019 report and while that gives them a roughly two year cash
runway at the projected cash burn rate, the mounting losses are certainly concerning. At
a current market capitalization circa $300 million, they are presently burning through
close to 20% of their value annually. Moreover, we suspect the fiscal 2020 forecasts
may be underestimating the true increase in losses the company will face given the
ramp-up in their various clinical trials. For their Phase III program, they enrolled 1,024
patients for 16 weeks in their PROTECTOR 1 trial during 2019. For their upcoming
PROTECTOR 2 trial, they are planning to enroll 1,600 patients for the same time frame.
Moreover, for their Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial for Parkinson’s, they are planning to enroll
45 patients for a four week study. Furthermore, the company expects to invest
significantly to further develop and seek regulatory approval for RTB101, expand their
pipeline of potential product candidates, including the initiation of at least one additional
proof of concept trial in an additional indication, require the manufacture of larger
quantities of product candidates for clinical development, and hire additional clinical,
scientific, management and administrative personnel as well as potentially acquire or in-
license other assets and technologies. Growing losses alongside questionable scientific
evidence are a recipe that gives us much concern.
Risk-Reward Outlook


If ResTORbio reports a successful Phase III trial, the stock price could increase
substantially. Moreover, a successful Phase III could enable ResTORbio to raise money
to fund additional applications of mTOR inhibitors and take advantage of a plethora of
essentially free R&D work coming from academics studying applications of mTOR
inhibitors. Moreover, there are short term risks to the upside. In the near term, the
company is expected to report completing the first arm of their Phase III study and
initiating the second arm. It is possible that the market will respond favorably to these
minor positive catalysts.


While there is certainly a possibility that stellar results could result in tremendous upside
for the company (a greater than 100% increase is fathomable), we believe that the
upside risk is mitigated due to the nature of the indication. It is notoriously difficult to
drive adoption of preventative treatments. Moreover, it is important to remember that
anything less than stellar results will have to compete with much more pedestrian
interventions known to improve immune function (i.e. moderate exercise, sunlight, sleep,
etc.). Lastly, even if the trial is a success, it is likely that it will be necessary for the
company to take on significant debt or do a follow-on equity offering in order to finance
the commercial roll-out of the product. The rest of their pipeline is sufficiently early stage
that we do not expect it to significantly impact their market capitalization. We have
considered the following scenarios: 1) We expect that negative trial results will decimate
the stock. 2) Mediocre trial results (anything less than a clear reduction of at least 40%
in risk of RTI) could be neutral or slightly positive for the stock in the short term, but may
ultimately be unsustainable for the company in the long-term. 3) Stellar trial results could
result in large short term upside for the stock, that is mitigated by the cost and
challenges of a commercial rollout for a preventative intervention.
