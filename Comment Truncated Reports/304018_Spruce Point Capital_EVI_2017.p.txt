Executive Summary

Spruce Point “Strong Sell” Opinion On 
Envirostar (EVI), Sees 40% – 80% Downside


Envirostar (NYSE/MKT: EVI), formerly known as DRYCLEAN USA, is a distributor of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning 
equipment.  With its shares up >600% since 2016, it has become one of the most overvalued microcaps in the stock market as index


funds blindly pile in. Investors are ascribing nonsensical multiples to its recent acquisitions, and failing to see a likely covenant breach.


Envirostar Just 
Another Poor 
Roll-Up, Close 
To Covenant 


Breach


Spruce Point has been a dogged proponent against investing in roll-up strategies, which are often just financially 
engineered plays designed to game index funds into overpaying for stocks, with little focus or incentive for management to 
create organic growth or value creation through operational improvement. We made early and successful calls identifying 
problematic roll-ups across many industrial sectors, AMETEK (test equipment), Greif (packaging), CECO Env’t (pollution 
control) and Echo Global (logistics). We view Envirostar as one of the worst + most speculative roll-up stories we’ve seen; 
already three quarters post closing its biggest deal of Western and EVI’s margins, profits, and cash flow are contracting. 
EVI must maintain quarterly profitability or risk a covenant breach. Q4 earnings of just $0.5m put it in jeopardy of a breach


Terrible 
Industry 


Headwinds and 
New Tech 
Disruption


Envirostar’s customers include independent and franchise dry cleaning stores and chains, and coin laundromat stores 
and distributors. Recent industry data shows a 20% decline in laundry facilities since 2005. Industry margins have 
compressed as a result of urbanization and new housing offering in place wash/dryers, while rents, utilities and other 
fixed cost increases have squeezed operators. Meanwhile, technology and phone apps are making it easier to outsource 
laundry needs. This trend is causing technology intermediaries to partner with centralized laundry operators or a select 
few partners. We expect this consolidation trend to place further pressure on the industry. Not surprisingly, we believe this
is why Envirostar is finding deals because experienced equipment operators see more problems ahead and want to sell


Questionable 
Management, 
Governance  
and Auditor


Envirostar is run by a relatively new CEO who has no experience in the laundry industry, yet bought into EVI in 2015. While 
he does own a lot of stock and appears aligned with investors, he has weak Board oversight with Directors that receive little
cash pay and own no stock. For example, the CEO recently formed a new business entity called Hammer Times LLC after 
Q2’17 – is he getting into the rap music industry? COO Steiner also dumped shares quickly after the Western deal and 
formed an outside business entity. Management is not transparent, doesn’t hold conference calls, and gives limited MD&A 
discussion in its SEC filings. Envirostar’s auditor traces its roots to Berkovits & Co, a Florida based firm tied to at least three 
companies charged with fraud including: 1) $100m INYX fraud pursued by the Dept. of Justice, 2) VOIP, charged by the 
SEC for fraudulent overstatement of profits, and 3) PrimEdge whose CEO was accused of bilking investors out of $20m


Significant 
Overvaluation 
With No Room 


For Error


Envirostar is the most expensive and financially weakest roll-up stories we’ve ever evaluated. Be careful: Envirostar has 
paid an average of 0.5x sales for recent deals, yet public investors are overpaying now by 5x. At the current enterprise 
value of $320m, the market is ascribing a value of 2.2x, 32x, 61x to our estimates for CY2018 sale/EBITDA/EPS results. 
Blue chip industrial distribution peers with significantly higher margins trade at 1x, 11x and 21x, respectively. At the 
current valuation, investors are discounting near perfection execution of another $175m+ of deals, which will be a 
struggle to achieve given organizational strains, small deal sizes needed to push the needle, and competition from other 
strategic buyers. We see 40% - 80% downside risk once investors realize they own a bag of dirty laundry

Capital Structure and Valuation 


$ in mm, except per share figures


Envirostar is currently trading at nearly 55x EBITDA and 101x P/E on its recent June fiscal year earnings. 
Assuming its recent acquisition of Tri-State closes (there is a risk it doesn’t), the shares are still richly valued 
at 32x and 61x 2018 EBITDA and EPS. We will demonstrate that Envirostar’s recent acquisitions are covering 
up significant underlying margin erosion and fundamental pressures, while it teeters on a covenant breach.

Envirostar’s Rapid Stock Appreciation 
Merits Scrutiny 


Envirostar’s shares are up >600% since announcing three small acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. Its first 
acquisition of Western State Design, while transformational in size, is already showing signs of 


disappointment. Meanwhile, the Martin-Ray deal for $4m at one point resulted in a nonsensical +$130m in 
market value creation. Investor enthusiasm is running too far ahead of tangible earnings. 


We believe blind index buying of shares has also distorted the intrinsic value of Envirostar’s shares.

Envirostar recently undertook a roll-up strategy. Its margin profile is significantly worse than recent industrial 
roll-up stories Spruce Point has exposed, and yet it carries an astronomical valuation. We don’t expect its 


margins to materially improve given EVI’s intention to keep each business functioning independently

Bull vs. Bear Debate on Envirostar


Bull Case Narrative Bear Case Reality
Tremendous runway for growth given fragmented 
laundry equipment distribution industry


CEO came from Watsco a successful roll-up 
of HVAC distributors, and highly incentivized 
through significant stock ownership


CEO is young and inexperienced, played a role at 
Watsco through family connection, has never run a 
public company, and has no experience in the laundry 
business. Directors overseeing him own no stock and 
can rubber-stamp bad deals with no consequence


First few deals are small, financially weak private 
companies. Will have to compete for deals with larger 
competitors (eg: WASH). Industry headwinds, including 
technology, are causing a shrinking customer base


Strong institutional ownership
Aside from a few microcap value funds (who must 
now be questioning what value remains after rapid 
valuation expansion), significant blind index fund 
buying is aiding overvaluation


Shares are cheap and offer 
tremendous value for investors


Ability for significant revenue and cost 
synergies can provide margin leverage


Each business is regional and remaining 
independent under its own brand. Potentially some 
pooled purchase savings, but none demonstrated yet 
as margins are decreasing. EVI spends nothing on 
capex / IT development
Valuation is nonsensical at 2.8x, 55x and 101x (sales, 
EBITDA, EPS) our CY 2017 estimates. Current valuation 
discounts perfect execution of an additional $175+ of 
acquired revenue. Already close to a covenant breach


Highly transparent and investor 
friendly management team 


Management doesn’t offer quarterly conference 
calls, limited MD&A disclosure to discuss 
performance drivers, won’t disclose acquired 
revenue contribution to obscure true organic growth

Terrible Industry Headwinds


Envirostar’s clients include independent and franchise dry cleaning stores, and coin operated laundromats. 
Recent data suggests that these stores are in structural decline.


Envirostar’s clients include independent and franchise dry cleaning stores, and coin operated laundromats. 
Government data and anecdotal evidence from a recent article in the Atlantic entitled “The Decline of the 


American Laundromat” discusses industry pressures and why laundromats are in structural decline.


US Census Data Illustrates Terrible Underlying Growth For Coin-Operated Laundries and Drycleaners


Source:  US Census.gov and The Atlantic, “The Decline of the American Laundromat” – July 31, 2017


US Economic Data Shows The Number of Laundry Facilities Has Declined By 20% Since 2005
• Urbanization and Development: wealth effect, urbanization and real estate development causing more 


apartments to come installed with washing / drying machines
• Shrinking margins: laundromat profits have been compressing from higher rents, utilities, water and 


sewage costs that cannot be easily offset
• Cheaper alternatives: laundromats have never been a cost effective option. As costs have fallen to own 


a washer / dryer, the rent vs. buy decision has tilted in favor of the customer

Industry Headwind: Technology Apps


Technology is starting to disrupt the US laundry service industry. On-demand laundry apps are dis-intermediating 
traditional laundromats and forcing more centralization of cleaning processes. Over time, we believe these factors will 


lead to fewer laundromats and less demand for cleaning equipment > a major negative for Envirostar.

Envirostar’s recent low quality tiny deals have unjustifiably created extraordinary market value creation. Three deals 
have been announced within a year – a rapid pace that suggests quantity over quality and are certain to put 
organizational strain on Envirostar. Given our concerns about industry issues, it should be no surprise that 


independent operators are looking to sell their businesses now.

Envirostar trails its industrial distribution peers in its margins, and we don’t believe its roll-up strategy will help its 
results improve absent it paying substantially more for higher quality businesses. The Company also invests nothing 


on capex or things such as technology that could help it materially reduce its costs.

Recent Financial Results Highlight 
Risk of Covenant Breach


Revenues and earnings are up vs. 2016 due solely to the inclusion of Western (closed 10/10/17) and Martin-Ray 
(closed 6/19/17), but looking closer at the results illustrates underlying weakness. Envirostar’s declining profitability 


put it close to posting a quarterly loss, which would cause a covenant violation (1)

EVI doesn’t disclose contribution of sales from acquisitions in its 10-K MD&A and gives a generic statement:


“The increases in revenues and net income during fiscal 2017 are primarily attributable to the results of operations of Western State Design 
following the Western State Design Acquisition”


However, it is clear that there’s been fundamental deterioration in the business:
• Western was generating $17.2m of sales per quarter as of June 30, 2016 (2). If you remove $34.4m of sales from the Q3/Q4 2017 sales 


(total $16.7m) and compare against EVI’s Q3/Q4 2016 sales (total $21.2m), revenues are down 21%! 
• Adjusted EBITDA margins have been declining for well over a year
• Cash flow from operations turned negative in Q4 after having been positive


Envirostar’s Financial Covenants Prohibit It From Posting a Quarterly Loss. Recent Q4’17 Results Put It Close…


1) EVI’s Credit Agreement Letter and Credit Agreement
2) Based on LTM sales of $69.1m per 8-K


* Western Closed Oct 10th                           ** Martin-Ray Closed June 19th

Just How Bad A Business Is Western?


In most businesses, the customers are charged for shipping costs and companies price the cost at break-
even, or in some cases make money by marking-up shipping costs. Generally, we find that the ultra-


competitive retail space often absorbs shipping costs to stay competitive.  
Western’s business is so bad that it loses money on shipping products to its customers.

Michael Steiner EVI’s long-time former CEO and now COO was quick to sell off 16% of his total shareholding not long 
after the Western deal was closed and the stock was in the $14/share price range. With his current package, he 


receives no further equity or options as part of his compensation. He recently formed a new outside business venture

Weak Governance and Director Oversight


Many of the Directors are recent appointees, young, and with little experience tied to the laundry industry. 
Director compensation is tiny and they collectively own no stock, so have nothing at risk if the venture fails. 


Investors should worry that management has little oversight, especially when it comes to outside business dealings

Envirostar was formerly named DRYCLEAN USA. Its auditor was Berkovits & Co, LLP a firm that was tied to numerous

Justice in a $100m fraud, and 3) PrimeEdge, whose CEO was charged with fraud (1, 2)

Who’s Looking After EVI’s Books?


Berkovits eventually merged Mallah Furman (source); Mallah’s last PCAOB inspection report noted: “Certain of the deficiencies 
identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had 
not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all 
material respects.” Mallah Furman just merged with a larger regional firm named EisnerAmper, which has an even worse record 


and was cited for problems in five issuer clients recently (source). Today, Berkovits is still with EisnerAmper (source)

$ in millions, except per share amounts


In Jan 2014, CSC ServiceWorks completed the acquisition of Mac-Gray for $21.25/share or $584m (1). Mac-Gray was 
the second largest laundry facilities management contractor in the US. We believe Mac-Gray is a significantly higher 


quality business in the laundry industry with >20% EBITDA margins and more stable revenue. 
The forward valuation multiples of Sales, EBITDA, and EPS implied by the transaction (1.5x, 6.7x, 16.5x) illustrate why 


we believe Envirostar is significantly overvalued

Envirostar’s Extreme Relative Valuation


There are no pure public comparables to Envirostar in the laundry and dry cleaning sector. However, since most of its 
business is distribution of products to commercial and industrial customers, its equity value is best evaluated relative 


to other industrial distributors with comparable margin profiles.  Higher quality peers with organic growth trade at 
1.0x – 1.3x sales, 10x – 11x EBITDA, and 3x – 5x price / book value. Envirostar’s growth is all acquired, and its 


valuation is nonsensical in light of the subpar businesses it is acquiring.
