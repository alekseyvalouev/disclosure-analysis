ITS NEVER A PROBLEM…
UNTIL IT IS A PROBLEM


The State of Denial at World Acceptance
Corp….Citron Keeps Target at 0.


To say we are entering into a new phase of
consumer protection regulation is an
understatement.  Just last week the US Senate, in a
rare bi-partisan landslide (90 to 5), passed a credit
card reform bill  — by a margin so wide that one
can say the country now has a mandate to protect
borrowers from lending abuses.  President Obama
has even gone so far as to call for a new �nancial
watchdog agency just to protect consumers.


In early 2009, Citron warned about future
regulation in the for-pro�t education space, in a
series of reports on Apollo Group.  Subsequently,
the stock has been down over 35% and just
yesterday the government announced
some proposed regulatory changes regarding
marketing and recruiting expenses.  As
investors, we must not focus on what is status quo
but rather what will be status quo.


It is the opinion of Citron that the World Acceptance
Corp. will now unavoidably become a target of new
regulation that will limit operations of their core
installment loan business.


It can be painted with any brush but Citron believes
that the facts support the conclusion that World

Acceptance is the “sub-prime” wedge of the short
term or payday loan business.


WRLD operates in just 11 states.  While details vary
from state to state, it is indisputable that WRLD’s
net yield on its loans outstanding is in excess of
85%, a rate that traps the majority of its customers
in an inescapable cycle of debt.  Meanwhile, the
company remains unwilling, and its analysts unable,
to state the percentage of its customers who
actually sign up for a loan, then pay it o� as
scheduled, without �ipping.


According to WRLD’s 2008 10-K:


“Consumer �nance companies are a�ected
by changes in state and federal statutes and
regulations. The Company actively
participates in trade associations and in
lobbying e�orts in the states in which it
operates. Although the Company is not
aware of any pending or proposed legislation
that would have a material adverse e�ect on
the Company’s business, there can be no
assurance that future regulatory changes will
not adversely a�ect the Company’s lending
practices, operations, pro�tability or
prospects.”


While we await their current 10-K, we can only
assume that this disclosure has to change.  As
previously quoted by their own trade association
(after all, WRLD’s CEO is one of its three board
members), three bills on a national level “could well
force the installment loan industry out of
business altogether.”  http://www.nilaonline.org/

1. S. 500, introduced in the U.S. Senate
by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL), the
Senate Majority Whip;


2. H.R. 1608, introduced in the U.S.
House by Representative Jackie
Speier (D-12-CA); and


3. H.R. 1640, also introduced in the U.S.
House by Representative Maurice
Hinchey (D-22-NY).

It is true that, to date, none of these have passed
(otherwise, the stock could already be a 0), but
these risks do exist.  Many of these bills have
widespread support and no one knows what will
eventually get passed, let alone what action the
new Federal agency will take.

This is not Payday Lending … Yet


This is where the story gets interesting.  Citron has
pointed out that while payday lending has been
regulated in many states, installment lending has
�own under the radar.  This has forced many
payday lenders to alter their terms, in fact slipping
into the installment lending business.

The question now begs to be asked:  How much
longer will it take to close the loophole?  We are
talking about a business practice that is only legal in
a handful of states.  For anyone to state there is no
legislative risk, they obviously do not have CNN or
read a newspaper.  Just two weeks ago, four bills in
WRLD’s largest state were stranded in the
committee that restricts short term lenders, while
other states are passing legislation weekly.

business model hangs loosely by a string.  Citron
cannot predict what state or federal bill will be the
silver bullet … unlike any other stock we have ever
covered, just one legal change will expose WRLD’s
entire model.  Remember, It is never a problem …
until it’s a problem.


Beyond usury laws, any state that simply limits
consumers to one such loan at a time damages
WRLD’s business as they will no longer be able to
ping pong their customers, which is the obvious
intention in this picture (Note: this is not a one-o�
— many WRLD sites seem to be located next door
to another installment loan company) 


Sterne Agee Report


On May 26, 2009, Sterne Agee released an analyst
recommendation on World Finance which gave a
$23.50 price target on the stock.  In the report, the
analyst makes a few assumptions:


1. Increased Credit Quality in upcoming
quarters


2. Little or no earnings growth from the
company


3. “Regulatory issues are not viewed as
an issue at this time”


So as investors, we are to believe that with
improving credit quality and no regulatory issues
the stock could trade at $23.50 a share.  Even their
cheerleading analyst admits that the company has
no real earnings growth (as the company was
5/18/2018 Its Never a Problem… Until it IS a Problem – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/its-never-a-problem-until-it-is-a-problem/ 5/6


hoping to gain from opening operations in Mexico). 
This call from Sterne Agee seemed to be based
solely on the argument that the company trades
below tangible book value.


Book Review Anyone?


But when a company trades below book value, it
isn’t a guaranteed buy.  Smart investors will �rst ask
themselves “Why does this company trade at a
discount to book ?”


There is a salient reason why stocks trade below
book:  the market is pricing in the risk of asset
impairment.  If one wrench is thrown into WRLD’s
gears, its stock could go to zero.


WRLD tangible book value is supposedly $275
million, but its main asset is $460 million in net
loans receivable.  In order for the common
shareholder to get anything at all from WRLD’s
“book” value, over 40% of those loans would need
to be repaid in full.  It is the opinion of Citron that in
runo� or with any regulation that forces changes to
WRLD’s loan o�erings, it would be impossible for
this company to collect even 20 cents on the dollar. 
As its own �nancials clearly show, the only reason a
huge portion of these folks enter the store and
make payments is the hope that they can get
another loan.


If payday is sub-prime that is collateralized by a
paycheck, then this is the sub-prime of sub-prime …
with no collateral.  Not a good loan book to own in
the face of regulation.


Just a few months ago, Henry Co�ey, the Sterne
Agee analyst whose work on WRLD is referenced
above, wrote that the incoming administration’s
intent to regulate payday lenders “is clearly
unambiguous.”  At the time, WRLD was trading
around $16, and he had a “neutral”
recommendation on it.  Citron asks: “What has
fundamentally changed?”

Citron strives to present stories detailing business
risks, which are, to date, being ignored or denied by
the subject company and its analysts, always
backing up its opinion with factual links.  It believes
caricaturizing critical opinion as “fear mongering” is
foolish, and savvy investors ignore risks at their
own peril.


Investing is a two-way street, and the strength
underlying our markets is that investors are free to
choose potential risks and potential rewards as
they assess them.  Ultimately, it’s an exercise in
separating appearance from reality.  Reality has a
way of taking care of itself.


Citron stands by its opinion that in the case of
WRLD, undisclosed risks to its business model may
be catastrophic, and are not priced into the stock as
currently evaluated by its cheerleader analysts.


Cautious investing to all.
