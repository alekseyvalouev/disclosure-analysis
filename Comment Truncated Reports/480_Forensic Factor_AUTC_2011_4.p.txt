AutoChina - The
Beginning of the
End
Jul. 11, 2011 2:23 PM ET | Includes: Ford Motor Company (F)


AutoChina - The Beginning of the End 


After the markets closed on June 30th, 2011, AutoChina announced that they
were delaying their 20F filing among a litany of other admissions. The press
release also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was
investigating the company and an accounting restatement was likely. They also
confessed that in addition to the Company, an officer had also received
subpoenas from the SEC. Finally, AutoChina disclosed that it had "a material
weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010, due to a lack of requisite internal U.S. GAAP experience." Despite
management's crafty reassurances, "neither the existence of the investigation
nor the service of subpoenas means the SEC has concluded that any violations
of law have occurred," we believe that these festering problems may be the tip
of the iceberg for AutoChina, the "Dependent" Board of Directors, and sadly
for shareholders. With the SEC and PwC presumably examining the multitude
of unusual accounts and related party transactions (disclosed and perhaps
undisclosed), it would not surprise us to see future inquiries and problematic
disclosures. The unwillingness of the Board of Directors to even investigate our
original alarming analysis speaks volumes about its cozy composition and
indifference towards U.S. investors. While it may be a coincidence, a recent
call Oppenheimer hosted with two partners from PwC China (AUTC's auditor)
on "The State of Accounting for Chinese Companies," seemed to cherry pick
the prominent warning signs from its own client, AutoChina.   


While the rampant and system-wide fraud accusations (and confessions) of
Chinese RTO's has surely desensitized many investors, the complacency
among AutoChina investors could is shocking. Despite management reassuring
and misleading commentary about the business, and attempt to downplay the

SEC investigation, we believe there is a high probability that AutoChina's stock
will get halted, delisted, and ultimately be another sub-five dollar tragedy. We
have tremendous confidence in the SEC, and despite some media criticism,
their actions suggest they are aggressively addressing the RTO mess to ensure
investors are protected. As the SEC and PwC continue their investigations, we
are hopeful that they will consider the concerns that have been raised in past
reports, as well as new areas of concern that are discussed below. Given our
belief that AutoChina's Board of Directors does not possess one truly
Independent member, we were relieved to learn that the SEC has now joined
PwC as the last line of defense for U.S. investors. 


Did AutoChina commit blatant, unabashed Securities Fraud? 
Since our original report on AutoChina, we believe that AutoChina's
management team has misrepresented material facts to the investment
community.[1] In our original report, as well as our follow-up report, we spent
considerable time discussing the unusual earn-out for the CEO. Aside from
creating horrific incentives for management to use aggressive accounting
tactics to meet earn-out targets, it was our belief that the earn-out was "not
currently treated in accordance with GAAP."  


AutoChina's management wrote a lengthy response to our report.[2] We
believe that statements contained in AutoChina's response were either
fabricated or knowingly erroneous. In its response, management stated
emphatically that the earn-out (underlined is our emphasis) "has been
discussed and confirmed with our current auditing firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers (and predecessor auditor Crowe Horwath)." We
believe that based upon the Notification of Late Filing (NT 20F), AutoChina's
statements regarding the sanctity of the earn-out accounting, and explicit
blessing from PwC, were untrue.[3] In the late filing notice, the company
clearly states that they were adjusting the earn-out accounting "after
consultation with PwC during its annual audit process." This confession directly
contradicts the earlier assurances that PwC had already "confirmed" the earn-
out accounting treatment. Given the sterling reputation of PwC, we believe it
would be highly unorthodox for an incoming accounting firm to "confirm" an
accounting treatment before conducting an audit - yet AutoChina's
management clearly stated otherwise, and did so in a public forum.

Secondly, we would question whether AutoChina was timely and forthright with
ALL investors as it relates to the SEC investigation. AutoChina filed its 6K for
Q1'11 on June 6, 2011. In that filing, we were unable to find any disclosures of
the SEC investigation under the risk section or under subsequent events.[4]
So we must assume that AutoChina only became aware of the SEC
investigation and subpoenas AFTER June 6th (otherwise they have a major
disclosure issue on their hand). The lack of a disclosure in the 6K would
suggest that AutoChina received the correspondence from the SEC between
June 6h and 30th. While AutoChina only chose to disclose the SEC
investigation and subpoenas on June 30th, we believe that they may have
selectively disclosed certain "issues" earlier to analysts with banking ties.  


We had previously highlighted an ominous research report on April 21 that
foreshadowed problems with the financials. In that report, an analyst at a firm
with very strong banking ties to AutoChina (as well as banking ties to a recent
SPAC that has significant management overlap with AutoChina) suspended his
rating and price target after discussions with management concerning the 20F.
We have no reason to suspect any wrong doing by the analyst, but it is a
logical concern the selective disclosure was the impetus for the rating and
price target suspension. If AutoChina knew about the SEC investigation well in
advance of June 30th, why was it not disclosed earlier for all investors? It
would seem logical that investors would have viewed such information as
material.


An additional disclosure problem may exist if insiders were selling stock before
the SEC investigation was disclosed. We believe any stock sales by insiders,
disclosed or undisclosed, while having knowledge of an unannounced SEC
investigation would constitute a material securities violation ("Examples of
insider trading cases that have been brought by the SEC are cases against
corporate officers, directors, and employees who traded the corporation's
securities after learning of significant, confidential corporate developments").
[5] In fact, we were able to find two filings for proposed insider sales within
two weeks of the public disclosure of the SEC investigation. Ignoring the odd
pencil filing, and the illegible signature, we would openly ask whether the
company knew of the SEC investigation while Jinyu Peng filed to sell stock to
U.S. investors that were unaware of the SEC investigation[6]:

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/194430-autochina-the-beginning-of-the-end 4/19


 
As a foreign filer, insider sales do not need to be disclosed. However,
AutoChina's management team had publicly committed to disclose any stock
sales greater than $200,000 by members of management. We would
encourage the SEC to confirm that this public disclosure commitment has been
upheld. Further, we think investors should be informed if members of
management or the Board sold any stock subsequent to our initial report and
prior to disclosing the SEC investigation.  


The misrepresentation of the earn-out fits a pattern of misrepresentations that
have been made by AUTC management. AutoChina announced in mid-
February that they would have AUDITED financials filed in March, "We look
forward to announcing our fully audited 2010 fourth quarter and year-end
financial results next month."[7] This timeframe for filing audited financial
results would have been consistent with the filing of 2009 annual results,
which occurred on March 22, 2010. In March, not only were no audited
financials filed, but AutoChina seemed to retract the previous reassuring
statement by issuing a new timeframe with no explanation, "The Company
anticipates filing before June 30, 2011."[8]  


In its most recent earnings release, we believe AutoChina's CEO severely
misrepresented the message from the research by China Automotive Review
by attempting to characterize the end markets as healthy. Mr. Yi appears to
have either misinterpreted the articles, or he brazenly painted a picture for
investors in the press release that didn't appear to exist in the source he cited.

The two articles cited by Mr. Li don't highlight the recent strength of the
heavy-duty truck market. To the contrary, they actually describe the
deterioration of the heavy truck market in China (production down 16% in
April, 31% in May and forecasted to decline 26% in June).[9] There is a
dramatic contrast in tone from the two negative articles and the positive
commentary AutoChina used in its earnings press release (underline is our
emphasis).  


Yong Hui Li,


Chairman


and CEO of


AutoChina


on June 6,


2011


"Since the latter half of 2010, we have seen demand in the heavy-truck


market normalize from its previously high growth levels. In 2010, heavy


truck sales in China rose by roughly 60% when compared to heavy truck


sales in 2009. We feel this was an extraordinary jump over the historical


growth in the market, driven in part by the effects of the government's


stimulus program. However, we are still seeing steady growth in our


sector. According to China Automotive Review, sales of heavy-duty


trucks, including chassis and semi-tractor trailers, in the first quarter of


2011 totaled 299,436 units, up 8.4% from the first quarter of 2010. We


believe that China’s continuing economic development will keep driving


demand for commercial vehicles in the long term"

China's heavy-duty market in danger of negative growth by


Wayne Xing  


According to the latest data available, China’s heavy-duty truck market is


slowing down significantly compared to the robust performance in 2010.


Sales of heavy-duty trucks (including chassis and semi-tractor trailers) in


the first quarter of 2011 totaled 299,436 units, up only 8.4 percent from


the same period last year. Semi-tractor trailers, the star and fastest


growing segment last year, saw sales drop 21.2 percent to 76,726 units.


Another sign that the heavy-duty truck as well as the entire automobile


market may be in for a difficult time is rising interest rates and tightening


of credit by the central government to rein in inflation.

more recent


findings:
China’s heavy-duty truck market declined further in May, as sales


plummeted 31 percent to about 74,000 units compared with the same


month in 2010, reported cvworld.cn, a leading Chinese truck and bus


news portal on June 7. Sales over the first five months were estimated to


be around 470,000 units, which is about a 4 percent drop compared with


the same period a year ago, when the market soared 120 percent. The


heavy-duty truck sector is expected to further drop in June, with volume


estimated to be less than 60,000 units, down about 36 percent from June


2010. The market may see a decline this year of as much as 15 percent,


according to some analysts


 If we assume that the financials and operating assumptions are accurate, it
does beg the question, why would AutoChina's management go to such
lengths to distort the health of its end markets? We think the answer may be
very straightforward. They need money. In past reports we have provided
analysis detailing the massive hole AutoChina would appear to have in its 2011
funding plans. In the 6K issued on June 6, 2011, they clearly state the
possibility of additional "borrowings from financial institutions and/or the sale
of equity." Given that most of the company's incremental borrowings have
come from related parties, our analysis would require the company to raise
substantial amounts of equity from NEW investors. For this to occur, PwC's
audit would need to play an integral role blessing the company's financials. We
believe that this is another reason PwC must get the audit 100% right - it will
serve as the key safety net for U.S. investors that would invest in any future
offerings. However, the comments directly from PwC partners may suggest
that they are not 100% comfortable with the characteristics of AutoChina.


Did PwC use AutoChina as a "Red Flags" case study the same day it
was halted?On June 30th, 2011, Oppenheimer hosted a call entitled "The
State of Accounting for Chinese Companies." The call was hosted by two audit
managing partners of PwC China, Laura Butler and Stephen Ducker.
Coincidentally, PwC China also happens to be AutoChina's newest auditor
(although we would not be surprised to see them resign before completing an
audit). On the call, Ms. Butler and Mr. Ducker outlined red flags for U.S.
investors that have been harbingers of fraud. After listening to the call, it

seemed to us that the PwC auditors may have been using AutoChina as their
case study. Below we compare the red flags that PwC discussed and the
parallels that we would illustrate at AutoChina. 


Red Flag Comment on Red Flag From PwC AutoChina


Dominant Chairman


and CEO


Chairman and CEO plays a


dominate role at the company.


Typically a founder and owns a


large percentage of the company.


There is no natural checks and


balance with other members of


the management team and audit


committee. Management and


audit committee are not willing or


able to challenge senior


management.


Yong Hui Li, AUTC's


Chairman and CEO, is also


its founder. He owns roughly


58% of the company and


controls the operating


companies through a VIE


structure.


Weak Audit


Committee


Audit committee lacks experience


and members are not located in


China or do not speak Chinese.


Committee members often have


no power to confront senior


management with issues.


**We discuss AUTC's weak


board and lack of checks and


balances below. We do not


view AUTC's three "external"


directors as independent.


None of the three directors


live in China (they instead


live in the United States,


Canada and Hong Kong).


Weak CFO CFO hired around IPO and not


part of the inner-circle of


management. CFO does not live


in China or does not speak


Chinese. CFO has limited CFO


experience or accounting


experience at publically traded


companies and does not have a


CPA.


Jason Wang, AUTC's CFO,


lives in the United States and


is not a CPA. Based on his


resume, it appears that he


had no relevant accounting


experience prior to his


appointment after the


reverse merger.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/194430-autochina-the-beginning-of-the-end 8/19


Other Issues Manipulation and collusion with


cash balances. Transactions with


related parties were specifically


mentioned, as was accounts


receivable that were never


collected.


**See details below on


related party transactions


and the alarming alterations


of these transactions.


 Tax documentation Disconnect between GAAP


tax provisions and cash


taxes


 Employee expenses Questionable expense base.


Possible shared expenses


with affiliated companies and


rent free arrangements.


 VIE ownership AUTC has a convoluted VIE


ownership structure where


the shareholders do not own


the operating companies.


 Use of IPO Proceeds This remains an open


question as the original


business model was focused


on new and used car lots - a


segment that was sold less


than one year after the


proceeds were raised.


 On the call, Ms. Butler discussed a specific example where the SEC was
focusing on a CFO and finance team's lack of experience with U.S. publicly
traded companies. She also alluded to problems with CFO's that are not CPA's.
While it may have been a mere coincidence, only several hours after the PwC
call concluded, AutoChina disclosed that it "identified a material weakness in
its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, due to a
lack of requisite internal U.S. GAAP experience" (underline our emphasis). As
we have discussed in past reports AutoChina's CFO is not a CPA, and it
5/19/2018 AutoChina - The Beginning of the End - The Forensic Factor | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/194430-autochina-the-beginning-of-the-end 9/19


appears that he had no relevant accounting experience prior to his
appointment as CFO. The CFO also joined AutoChina from PEMGroup, where
he was the Director of Research. While AutoChina's CFO may have been
completely unaware while he was Director of Research, PEMGroup turned out
to be one of the largest ponzi schemes in U.S. history. Given the extensive
similarities between AutoChina and the "red flag" examples PwC used, we
would be shocked if PwC is willing, or even able, to complete the audit and
required restatement. But this does beg the question, if there are problems,
why have we yet to see Board resignations and the lack of cooperation from
management that ultimately leads to an auditor resignation? 


Management's $100 million incentive and the InDependent Board 
Unlike many Chinese frauds that were discovered AFTER the money had
already been misappropriated, AutoChina is unique in the sense management
needs the audit to make approximately $100 million in an earn-out. Upon
completion of the audit (the lone remaining hurdle for the earn-out),
AutoChina's CEO will be issued approximately $100 million of stock. As such,
management is highly motivated to "cooperate" with PwC, and do anything it
can to ensure the audit gets completed. Given the monetary amount at risk,
there is zero incentive for management to "take the money and run" as so
many Chinese companies have done by refusing to work with auditors or
special committees. But what about the Board of Directors; where have they
been during the last four months since the original research was made public
questioning so many elements of the AutoChina story? Shouldn't the
"Independent" Directors have taken their fiduciary responsibility seriously
enough to at the very least form a special committee to investigate very
reasonable claims?  


We believe that a prudent Independent Director would have viewed an SEC
investigation and associated subpoenas as cause for concern, providing a
reasonable backdrop meriting an investigation. But given the unusual nature
of AutoChina's Board, which arguably has no truly independent directors, it
has not been surprising to see the Board look the other way. In fact,
AutoChina's Board is one of the most "dependent" Boards we have ever come
across. AutoChina's Board of Directors is made up of only five members. Of
the five, three are labeled external directors. It would appear to us that the

external directors are actually incredibly related in nature. The table below
highlights the three outside directors and why we believe a reasonable person
would question their independence.

Areas of Focus (beyond the potential financial chicanery such as the
earn-out) 
There is no doubt in our mind that the SEC and PwC (although we would guess
they'll resign) will conduct an intense and rigorous investigation into the
previous operational and financial concerns that have been raised. In addition
to the nonsensical financial claims that AutoChina has presented to-date, we
would encourage the SEC and PwC to scrutinize other areas of potential

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/194430-autochina-the-beginning-of-the-end 11/19


misappropriation that we list below. Following the PwC conference call on June
30th (highlighted above), we feel reassured that the auditors are intensely
focused on these issues and flags.





1) Related Party Funding and Transactions 
Muddy Waters has been the gold standard for exposing Chinese fraud. An
incredibly powerful tool that Muddy Waters has consistently used to identify
fraud has been focusing on "accounts that we consider high risk because they
are primarily evidenced by paper documentation, rather than their physical
presence (as in machinery and equipment). The abundance of paper accounts
on the balance sheet was one of the early signs to us that Rino International
Corp. was a fraud. It is clear that auditors in China are having significant
problems evaluating the veracity of documents" (underline is our emphasis).
We believe the same "paper documentation" verification is where the SEC and
PwC could face the most significant challenges.


The table below highlights the list of related party transactions that we have
been able to ascertain. There may be other material related party transactions
that have not yet been fully fleshed out. Given the sheer volume of dollars
shifting back and forth between these related parties, there is ample
opportunity for impropriety (such as hiding expenses and credit losses).
Through nine months of 2010, the combined dollar amount of the related party
transactions equated to a shocking $865 million. We believe the SEC and PwC
are determined to reconcile the paper and money trail relating to the
unprecedented related party transactions that we have found at AutoChina.
While we are still working though the transactions, we would agree with PwC's
assessment from the Oppenheimer call concluding that extensive related party
transactions present huge red flags….

 Additionally, we are concerned that related parties appear to be shifting and
morphing as well. AutoChina director Thomas Lau may have become
uncomfortable with the related party activities between AutoChina and Beiguo
Commercial Building Limited and Shijiazhuang Beiguo Renbai Group Limited
(both partially owned by Mr. Lau and AUTC's CEO Yong Hui Li). This could be
the motivation for AutoChina attempting to shift their related party debt to
5/19/2018 AutoChina - The Beginning of the End - The Forensic Factor | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/194430-autochina-the-beginning-of-the-end 15/19


firms 100% controlled by Yong Hui Li (including Honest Best, the parent
company of AutoChina, and Hebei Ruituo Auto Trading Co.). On May 31, 2011,
AutoChina announced it had transferred its related party debt to a company
100% controlled by the CEO. The debt was transferred on March 29th, two full
months prior to the disclosure, and just two days before quarter end. Was this
transfer related to the audit? Was it related to the SEC? Why was Mr. Lau's
exposure to AutoChina suddenly removed? 


Disclosed related party transactions leave plenty of room for comingling of
funds and cash exchanges that are beneficial to management. Unlike most
troubled RTO's, AutoChina actually needs to receive cash to keep the machine
going because funding is needed - unless loans are fabricated, but we trust
that the loans do exist. So what should be made of cash infusions from related
parties at massive discounts, in some cases at a zero percent interest rate? We
aren't entirely sure, but we do know that the CEO stands to make $100 million
in earn-out shares should the game last through the 2010 audit. 


Additionally, we would love to be a fly on the wall when PwC and the SEC
carefully examine Hebei Chuanglian Trade Co, Hebei Xian Real Estate, and Mr.
Yong Hui Li. Also, we would guess the SEC will look at the ownership structure
of Changjie and Chuangshend Auto Trade and any cash acquisitions that those
entities may have made with loans from Hebei Chuanglian Trade, to verify that
AutoChina paid a financing charge of approximately 4% in 2010 in excess of
the cost to Beiguo and Renbai for the funds obtained due to the financing
arrangement guaranteed by Mr. Li.


The payable balances of each loan from Beiguo and Renbai will also be
interesting (the cash payments) as both were due within 180 days on Dec 31,
2009 (were payments ever made?). Similar issues may exist between Honest
Best and Hebei Ruituo Auto Trading balances. Further any undisclosed vehicle
purchases by ACG through Chuanglian Trading from parties related to Mr. Li or
Mr. Yong would be a material problem. Additionally, we wonder who
represented the ownership of Xinjiang? Was this a truly independent purchaser
of the auto dealerships? Was the full purchase amount of $68.8 million ever
received by AutoChina subsidiaries in cash? Did the ownership structure of
Xinjiang qualify as a related party transaction that was not disclosed? Was
there ever a physical delivery of materials in the sum of $1 million
(NYSEARCA:USD) that AutoChina paid Kaiyuan Doors, or was the cash simply

transferred to a company owned by the CEO and his wife? Further, Beiguo (the
grocery story) purchased $19 million of "trading materials" from AutoChina -
what were these materials? Why was a grocery store owned by the CEO
buying materials from an auto leasing company? In addition, we would guess
the SEC will perform a similar exercise with the accounts relating to Wantong
Longxin (owned by Mr. Li's brother).  


2) Credit 
We have not been shy in noting our extreme skepticism towards AutoChina's
credit quality. Given the myriad of related party transactions, it would appear
to be very easy to hide repossessed vehicles and losses inside of related party
entities. Management claims to have experienced fewer than 20 defaults
(versus 23,000 leases) and cumulative losses of roughly 15 basis points since
inception. We believe this would represent one of the greatest
accomplishments in modern finance, defying all conventional laws of lending.
As such we would implore the SEC and PwC to verify (beyond paper
documents) the purported loans AutoChina has made to confirm that they
have only had 20 defaults. We would also guess that PwC will insist on
verifying the trail of cash interest payments from every loan all of the way
through third party bank statements. 


3) Hidden expenses 
Given the limited expense growth and extremely low ratio of expenses per
employee at AutoChina (which we have documented in the past), we believe
AutoChina could have offloaded expenses to affiliated companies. This would
include rent free transactions, as well as services and employee expense
burdens being passed to related party companies. If this is true, it is not
disclosed and would severely alter the expense structure at AutoChina. As a
result, it would be prudent to review and audit the expense structure and
payroll of related party companies that share employees with AutoChina (for
example Mr. Li who hypothetically could be highly incentivized to shift
expenses to Hebei Kaiyuan to remove said expenses from AutoChina's P&L - to
hit the EBITDA targets stipulated by the earn-out). Also, for example, Hebei
Kaiyuan Real Estate Development - formerly Shijiazhuang Kai Yuan Auto Trade
Co.,Ltd. - 86 311 8382 - should not be able to transfer a caller to an AutoChina
employee.

4) Size and Scope of Operations 
We would encourage the verification and authenticity of the 318 AutoChina
branch locations. A common theme in Chinese RTO frauds has the
exaggeration of the actual size and scope of the operating company. We are
confident that PwC has requested documentation at the branch level for the
leases that AutoChina has claimed to underwrite for their normal audit
procedures. We would be thrilled if management would release the addresses
for each of the 300+ branches. 


We also believe there are several other accounting issues that could cause
material restatements at the company (beyond the earn-out). We are
concerned about other accounting issues including sales-type lease accounting
(AUTC is not a captive finance company so this treatment does not apply to
them), credit reserve accounting (credit reserves against their accounts
receivable which represent their delinquent loans does not conform to GAAP, in
our opinion), interest expense (debt with below market interest rates must be
discounted), and stock compensation. In the first quarter 2011 the company
restated part of their reserves for the first quarter 2011 and the fourth quarter
2010, shifting a portion against the "Current maturities of net investment in
sales-type leases." There was no mention of this shift in accounting policy or
notification of the restatement that we have been able to find.  


5) Things that common sense would say aren't so common 
*It defies common sense that that AUTC has only 20 defaults out of more than
23,000 leases 
*It defies common sense that a $1.7 million reserve is sufficient to cover over
$850 million of leases 
*It defies common sense that a grocery store has provided hundreds-of-
millions of dollars of funding to AutoChina 
*It defies common sense that the expense base is virtually non-existent for a
national network of 300 stores and thousands of employees 
*It defies common sense that AutoChina can account for its delinquencies as
"account receivables" and its related party debt as "accounts payable" and
"due to affiliates 


U.S. investors in AutoChina are investing at their own peril. The stock is
currently more than fairly value on reported financials and has seemed to
completely discount any risk from the SEC investigations. If the SEC or PwC

were to find more problems at AutoChina, there is no reason to think it will not
suffer the same fate as so many halted Chinese scams once they reopen - a
quick trip to a few bucks per share. But, even if AutoChina somehow manages
to get through its audit and escape unscathed from the SEC investigation, the
company could face a severe funding gap. The company claims to have $242
million of book value at March 31, 2011. This amount will be materially lower
after the earn-out restatement.  When one considers that AutoChina has
recognized significant earnings upfront through gain on sale accounting and
has a mere $2.4 million of reserves, we think book value is likely materially
overstated.  At 50% of stated book pre-restatement, the company would be
worth $5 to $6 per share. In run-off, we think there would be little to no value
for equity holders.
