VIVUS (NASDAQ:VVUS):
WHY FDA APPROVAL IS
NOT THE PRESCRIPTION


   Freedom-to-Operate may be
Severely Compromised
 


Eight years ago this month, (yes Citron has been at
it this long), we published an article on Nitromed
(NASDAQ:NTMD).  Nitromed received FDA approval
to combine two generic pharmaceuticals and the
stock catapulted to over $20 a share, with every
covering analyst posting a "strong buy".  Citron
pointed out the problems in their business model
in the face of Wall Street.  The company ended up
selling itself 3 years later for .80 cents a share.   The
moral of the story is FDA approval is not a short
path to riches, and the importance of intellectual
property cannot be discounted when valuing a
pharma company.  For a drug with purported
"multi-billion dollar market potential", Citron is
astounded by the weakness of Vivus' intellectual
property protection, and the lack of due diligence
on the Street, which allowed things to get so far
without a warning �ag being dropped.

http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 2/16


Citron has been carving to the bone on the Vivus /
Qsymia weight control pill story, and is convinced
this is déjà vu all over again.  Similarities include:


A "blockbuster" drug — which is just a
combination of two readily available,
inexpensive generics
A one-drug pharma company – with
an abysmal track record long on hype
and failed execution
Notable absence of a deep-pockets
marketing partner, having to "go it
alone" with its home-grown and risky
marketing plan.
Vivus's intellectual property
protection for its much publicized diet
drug Qsymia appears riddled with
�aws


   The Drug Story Background
With FDA approval obtained for its weight loss drug
Qsymia, VVUS stock price has tripled over the last
year, fattening up its market cap close to $3 billion,
all for a drug that we believe will never become
commercially viable.


This report will identify major problems in the
intellectual property foundation supporting VVUS's
weight loss drug.


Considering Vivus had a favorable 20-2 advisory
panel recommendation in hand in February, the
company knew FDA approval this week was a
certainty.  They have had the last 5 months to sign a
licensing / distribution / partnering / deal with a
credible pharma marketing company.  J&J — a likely
rights-holder in at least one of the patents looming
over Vivus' freedom to operate — would have
obviously been the company’s �rst phone call in
February.  Instead, insiders sold virtually all their
options-vested stock, and the company raised
money from investors.


After all, Vivus, is a 38-person company with scant
history of manufacturing or selling a drug.  Why
have they not been able to sign up a marketing
5/18/2018 Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS): Why FDA Approval Is Not the Prescription – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 3/16


partner or a strategic investor for Qsymia over the
past 5 months ?   Citron �nds this odd … Like Kate
Upton not being able to �nd a date.  Possibly the
problem here is no one wants to get in the middle
of what seems to be an inevitable intellectual
property battle with J&J and/or others that will likely
delay and possibly threaten the production of
Qsymia.


Because of this overhanging risk, any third parties
supplying topiramate to Vivus might be liable for
contributory infringement for supplying an Active
Pharmaceutical Ingredient – a risk for any drug
supplier who knowingly infringes a patent.


 


   Vivus's Intellectual Property
Story:  Serious Doubts about its
IP Protection


 


"You can avoid reality, but you
cannot avoid the consequences of
avoiding reality."


– Ayn Rand (1905-1982)


While the company has been busy furthering their
FDA submission and selling stock, Vivus has simply
avoided confronting the reality that they might not
even be able to go to market. 


The foundation stone of Vivus' IP protection is a
patent licensing deal signed a decade ago with a Dr.
Najarian, an obesity doctor and researcher who
�led as sole inventor for Qsymia's two-drug combo. 
One question that has been hanging over the
company for years is the possibility of patent
infringement on one of Qsymia's two active
ingredients, topiramate, a patent held by Johnson &
Johnson, who used to sell the drug as an obesity
treatment before it went generic.  It a�ords patent
protection until 2017.  It originally was �led by a
researcher named Shank on June 29, 1996 (US PTO

You do not have to be a patent attorney to read the
title of the abstract:


"Anticonvulsant Derivatives Useful in Treating
Obesity"


There is no evidence of the validity of this patent
ever being challenged, either at the USPTO or the
corresponding EP patent (EP0915697
[https://register.epo.org/espacenet/application;jsessionid=1
number=EP97936939&ta] ) �led here.  There are no
mentions in Vivus' �lings of the Shank patent, and
therefore no clues as to how Vivus plans to deal
with it.  They do say in their 2011 10-K: 


We are aware of issued patents for


the use of topiramate alone or in


combination with other specific


agents (zonisamide and mirtazapine)


for treatment of obesity and


related indications e.g. prevention


of weight gain.  We have worked


closely with our patent counsel to


put together a cogent patent


strategy and are building a strong


patent portfolio in an attempt to


obtain exclusivity over the life of


the patents. 


And???  You've worked on it?   What is the answer?


How exactly does Vivus overcome the Shank patent
to sell topiramate for weight loss?  Citron rates this
unresolved question a substantial risk factor. 


Here is an answer given by Vivus head of corporate
development, Tim Morris at a recent conference
when asked about the Shank patent:

probably to the Shank patent which


is owned by Ortho. And as you guys

J&J for several years, it's now


generic. We've talked about this in


the past.


We don't believe there's any issues


in terms of we've looked at the


issue patents from Shank, we've


looked at the issue patents for us,


several patent counsels have opined


on them. Both patents are issued


and we think they're valid.


We don't believe there will be any


concern there. Obviously topiramate


is not approved for obesity. We


don't believe J&J is making any


money off topiramate for obesity.


And so, no, we're not concerned at


all about J&J. It's obviously a


topic for the Street and people


love to opine and write on it, but


for us it's full steam ahead.


It doesn’t make a di�erence if you think your
patents are valid…what does J&J think?  Citron notes
that …Tim Morris sold ALL of his Vivus common
stock the same week in February that the company
received its favorable vote from the FDA advisory
panel …

resolved.


   Potential Problems in Vivus's
product protection based on the
Najarian patent.
 


As if the Stark patent issue was not enough, there
are also unanswered questions about the main
patent Vivus appears to be relying on behind
Qsymia – the one licensed from Dr. Najarian.  A
condition was introduced to the assignment
agreement between Vivus and Dr. Najarian that
made future milestone payments contingent on the
Najarian patents prevailing over another, earlier-
�led third-party patent by inventor McElroy.  The
company found the McElroy patent important
enough to make it a condition in the licensing
agreement with Najarian.


Very soon after Dr. Najarian assigned his patent to
Vivus in 2001, the McElroy patent issued, with
claims related to methods for treating disorders
that include obesity using sulfamates (including
topiramate) in combination with psychostimulants
(including phentermine).


This is a second threat to Vivus's freedom-to-
operate and, it is referenced explicitly in the
assignment [http://media.bourne-
partners.com/Vivus/Najarian_Assignment.pdf]
agreement from Dr. Najarian on October 16,2001. 
(See 3.2.(ii) and 3.2.(ii) for speci�c references ).  In
fact, payments to Dr. Najarian are explicitly made
contingent on "freedom to operate" with relation to
the McElroy patent.

University of Cincinnati and is widely published on
obesity and mental disorders.

patent, which was June 14, 1999 (search for
"provisional" to verify these dates).  And note that
McElroy's full �ling appropriately references the
June 2000 Shank patent.  It includes studies in
which Binge Eating Disorder patients were treated
with open label topiramate in doses from 25 mg to
1200 mg.   (The use of phentermine at varying
doses to treat obesity was well known at the time.) 
Now, it remains possible that with the proper
documentary evidence, the Najarian patent defense
could "swear behind" the McElroy patent to get
date precedent in the US – an uphill struggle for
Vivus.  But such a claim will not hold up in Europe,
because outside US jurisdictions, the provisional
patent �ling date prevails.

Najarian and Vivus obviously had to know about
the signi�cance of the McElroy patent, because
the entire Vivus assignment from Najarian in
October 2001 is contingent on Vivus obtaining
freedom to operate without interference from the
McElroy patent speci�cally.  But later patent �lings
state no reference to this important prior patent
application.  Whether an intentional oversight or
impermissible intentional misstatement, it leaves
open the door to a ruling nullifying the Najarian
patent in its entirety — yet another door opened
for patent litigation.


   Obviousness is a problem for
Vivus


In its simplest terms, US Patent Law requires that
an invention be novel and non-obvious.  For
example, simply varying the dosing of a drug which
shows side e�ects proportional to dosage is not
su�ciently novel to qualify for a patent.


The patent examiner in Dr. Najarian's case
challenges this very point:  that combining two
known weight loss drugs to treat obesity is
obvious.  Najarian's declaration counters:
[http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/07/Najarian-
declaration.pdf]    (see page 4)
[http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/07/Najarian-declaration.pdf]


"The claimed combination has


surprisingly fewer side effects


than the individual drugs."


"…I surprisingly found that the


addition of a sympathomimetic agent


such as phentermine greatly


diminished the side effects of the


topiramate.  Further, this allowed


patients who, previously, could not


tolerate topirate, to be able to


take topiramate in combination with


phentermine.  … "

5/18/2018 Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS): Why FDA Approval Is Not the Prescription – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 9/16


This is an extremely important statement to the
patent.application's defense.  Even if Dr. Najarian
submitted this statement in good faith, he has a
duty of candor with regard throughout the
pendency of both the originally-�led and
subsequently-�led applications to disclose all
information known to the application that might
impact patentability.   The question is, in light of the
sizable studies performed on Qsymia to gain FDA
approval, and the copious commentary on its side
e�ects, does Dr. Najarian still believe the above
statement is accurate and defensible?  No side
e�ects observed with this drug combo ?


The huge body of clinical evidence, including Vivus'
own studies submitted for FDA approval, indicate
that side e�ects of Qsymia are essentially
proportional to dosing.  The very body of evidence
that Vivus submits for safety adds to the same
exact body of evidence a challenger would use to
attack the Najarian patent for non-novelty and
obviousness.


Referring to Vivus' own FDA Advisory Brie�ng
Document (linked below):


"As such, the side effects of QNEXA


[now Qsymia –ed.] therapy are


expected to be consistent with


those described in the approved


labeling for phentermine and


topiramate, albeit at a severity


consistent with lower doses."


Any party challenging the Najarian patent will �nd
they have been handed extremely strong legal
grounds to attack its validity on the above
comments. 


   Patent Ownership
Uncertainties
There is further a question as to whether Dr.
Najarian actually owned the patent personally, as
he �led.  Or did he have an obligation to assign his
invention to one or more of his employers?
5/18/2018 Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS): Why FDA Approval Is Not the Prescription – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 10/16


At the time his assignment to Vivus was executed,
Dr. Najarian was the VP of Medical A�airs and
Medical director at Interneuron Pharmaceuticals. 
Typically, work-related inventions such as this fall
under an employee's duties under employment
agreements to be assigned to the employer. 
Interneuron changed its name to Indevus, and was
later bought by Endo Pharmaceuticals.


Interneuron had some track record with weight loss
drugs.  In fact, it was the producer of the widely
prescribe Redux, recalled in September 1997, due
to correlation with heart valve problems.   Redux
was a correlate of one half of the infamous "fen-
phen" combination.  Clearly Dr. Najarian was deeply
involved in weight loss treatments.    However Dr.
Najarian lists himself as the sole applicant.   Vivus
entered into its Assignment Agreement with
Najarian solely and personally.  No further evidence
of Najarian's relationship was documented.


Further, records indicate Dr. Najarian was a sta�
physician at two hospitals during the same
timespan he cites administering this drug
combination to patients in what appear to be small
informal trials referred to in his patent application. 
Employment agreements both at drug companies
and medical centers routinely claim intellectual
property rights from trials conducted by employees
in their facilities, unless speci�cally excepted, such
carve-outs never having been placed on the record
in this case.  Not to mention, he appears to have
been conducting drug trials without legal oversight,
and citing these to his own apparent bene�t in his
patent application.  If he argues they weren't
"really" drug trials, but just ordinary course
doctoring, he undermines his own "non-
obviousness" and "novelty" arguments.  It's quite a
pickle once you think about it.  


Did Dr. Najarian have full rights to assign this
patent to Vivus?  Do investors really think nobody
will challenge this patent?  Do they really think the
best strategy for maximum economic leverage for a
patent challenger has been anything other than to
wait quietly until the FDA approved Qsymia,
rendering the patent more relevant, on Vivus's
5/18/2018 Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS): Why FDA Approval Is Not the Prescription – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 11/16


dime?  If the patent's original applicant assigned the
rights to it improperly, is the patent still valid?  Who
really owns those rights ?  


Vivus has had not just the last 5 months, but 5
years since questions about the Najarian, Shank
and McElroy patents were posed by analysts, to
create enough clarity to go to market.  Yet to this
day, all we hear from the company is assurances
that they have legal opinions in hand stating "they
are OK".   No joint ventures, no counterparty
agreements, no releases. 


Quite a cloud of uncertainty for a "multi-billion
dollar opportunity" resting on the combination of
two common generic drugs, don't you think?  If this
were a solid pharma with high management
credibility, maybe investors could give them the
bene�t of the doubt.  But this management?  Read
on.


 


   Competitive Landscape:  
Generic Drug Competition
 


In its most recent 10-K, Vivus's disclosure speaks for
itself:


"Our investigational drug


candidate, Qsymia, is a combination


of drugs approved individually by


the FDA that are commercially


available and marketed by other


companies.  As a result, our drug


may be the subject to substitution


with individual drugs contained in


the Qsymia formulation and


immediate competition. "


Beyond the above uncertainties surrounding Vivus'
Intellectual Property rights to this drug
combination, the company faces tough market
challenges trying to enforce its territory in the
marketplace.  Because the generic components of
5/18/2018 Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS): Why FDA Approval Is Not the Prescription – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 12/16


Qsymia are widely available, some doctors are likely
to continue to prescribe phentermine and
topiramate (millions of prescriptions of each were
written last year, see FDA Advisory Brie�ng
Document excerpt below).  The clinical trials of
record provide plenty of protection from liability for
doctors making such choices.  This places Vivus in
the unenviable position of trying to enforce non-
patent exclusivity against prescribing physicians. 


In the words of Vivus' own FDA Advisory Brie�ng
Document:


Phentermine hydrochloride at a


labeled dose up to 37.5 mg/part is


the most prescribed weight-loss


drug in the US with approximately


6.5 million prescriptions written


in 2011 [ IMS data].  A more


recently approved formulation of


phentermine, Suprenza Tm, was


approved in 2011. ….. More than 10


million prescriptions were written


in 2011 for topiramate [ IMS data


].  The majority of current


topiramate use is in migraine


prophylaxis.


http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees
[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittee


While these citations lend credibility to Vivus claims
about the drug's safety, the fact that both
ingredients are available and in wide use as
generics makes enforcing the company's patents
far more challenging (and perhaps raises hurdles to
negotiating reimbursement).


CEO Wilson's stated strategy, that a combination of
patent protection, establishing a dosage regimen
that is between strengths of generically available
competition (compare 46mg Qsymia to 50 mg
generic topiramate), and adding in time release
features, create a barrier to entry for Qsymia
generic competitors.  However, his own cited
example for this strategy (during a 2006 conference
call) met quite an unfortunate end.  Ditropan from

http://citronresearch.com/vivus-why-fda-approval-is-not/ 13/16


Alza Corporation, which was a controlled-release
formulation of oxybutinin, had its own patent ruled
invalid just a month later — for obviousness.
  [LINK]
[http://www.orangebookblog.com/2006/09/alza_loses_appe
   The company's sales fell from $380 million prior
to the ruling, to $15 million within a few years.  He
stopped citing Ditropan after that.


Vivus might be granted three years of non-patent
exclusivity due to providing a new clinical study
and/or formulation, which is far less than the 20
years from �rst �ling that strong patent protection
might a�ord.  But in the face of freedom-to-operate
challenges above, Qsymia might experience
outcomes ranging from zero exclusivity to three
years, or partial three year exclusivity, shared with
generics.


Translation:  Severe pricing and competition
headwinds ahead. 


Just for grins we looked up some prices on the
Costco pharmacy site.  We found phentermine 15
mg at about 44c per pill, and topiramate 100 mg is
about 23c per pill in Costco-sized bottles of 100.  So
that would be about $20 a month for generic
treatment at the top-level dosage of Qsymia (at
15mg/92mg).  And the generic approach leaves
doctor and patient free to adjust or taper the
proportion of the two drugs, �exibility they
wouldn't have with Qsymia … and, at no extra
charge.


   Vivus's Corporate History: 
Failure to Execute
Vivus is not just any startup biopharma company.  It
has been operating for over 20 years with the same
CEO, Leland Wilson.  Vivus began its life as a
publicly traded company pursuing a treatment for
erectile dysfunction for males. In the mid-1990's, iIt
actually produced and brought to market a
treatment involving inserting a suppository into the
male urethra.  Despite approval by the FDA and in
Europe, a �restorm of hype, an initial sales bubble,
and a brief stock run to over $1 billion valuation,

the product failed to gain market share and was


sold in 2010 to a 3rd party for just $23.5 million. 


While Vivus's stock has languished in junk stock
(sub $5) land for most of the last 20 years, the
company has pursued a variety of highly promoted
"stories", mostly concerning various attempts to
introduce products to treat so-called  "feminine
sexual dysfunction", including testosterone spray
and vasodilators. 


Despite the company's hype-marked history, the
following table is relevant to investors because
Vivus's 20 year history illustrates one of the most

   Insider Sales
Regular readers of Citron know that we like to
follow the dollars.  There's only only thing more
disturbing than the hole where a marketing or
strategic partner should be — the amount of
insider selling.  Insider sales in Vivus over the last
twelve months are 1.7 million shares between $9
and mid $20's, and current insider ownership is
down to 0.29% according to Bloomberg.  Do we
have to belabor the point that this is incredibly
small for a company with zero revenues that holds
the license on "the next big thing"?


   Conclusion
Despite years of lead time, Vivus' executives have
failed to provide strong patent protection for
Qsymia.  Taken together, these points provide the
best explanation yet why Vivus hasn't been able to
recruit a high-pro�le deep-pocketed pharma
partner to leverage its expertise while taking some
of the risk of marketing its newly approved diet
combo drug.   Instead of selling a stake to a credible
pharma marketer, they sold stock – over $230

5/18/2018 Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS): Why FDA Approval Is Not the Prescription – Citron Research

million to …. you guessed it.  The hope that a big
pharma company is going to ride in pay $3 billion
for Vivus is ludicrous – the strategy of trying to
pierce its patent protection for a few million in legal
fees is a far lower risk. 


The more marketing hype about the FDA approval
of this combination of two well-known and
inexpensive legacy generic drugs, the more Vivus
sets up its own ambush – by legal challenges to its
patent, and generic drug competition starting
before they can even get to market.   


There is long track record in the US of diet drugs
being horrible investments, due to having a very
short half-life.  Consumers seem to move from one
fad to the next, only to discover there is little that
substitutes for exercise plus lowering caloric
intake…. and we don’t even think this one gets that
far. 


To conclude, Citron o�ers a two part generic
prescription


For your health:  
Eat a diet rich in nutrition, and exercise. 
Eliminate junk food from your diet.


For your prosperity: 
Invest in high-quality companies run by
management with a strong track record of
success.  Eliminate junk stocks from your
portfolio.


Citron believes that in 1 year, Vivus's Qsymia
revenues will be exactly what they are today:   0.


Cautious (and healthy) Investing to all
