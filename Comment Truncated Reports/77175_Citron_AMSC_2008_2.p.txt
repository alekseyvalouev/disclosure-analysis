AMSC


“If You Add to The Truth, You Subtract From It” 
- The Talmud


It is no secret that Citron Research is skeptical of American Superconductor
(NASDAQ:AMSC). The company has now crossed the line to ridiculous. They have
taken a small customer in Sinovel and added so much nonsense that they have
subtracted any corporate credibility that is still left from a company that has done
nothing but burn through investors money. It is our opinion that anyone on Wall Street
would have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to realize the complete lunacy of American
Superconductor’s most recent press release.

As management continues to sell stock at a furious
pace, American Superconductor announced a $450
million order from Sinovel that is supposed to be
used to support more than 10 Gigawatts of power by
the end of 2011. This is on top of their current $100+
million “backlog” to the same customer.


To explain how crazy this press release was, Citron refers to the largest wind power
purchase order in the world, which was just publicly announced by T. Boone Pickens.
Pickens, with General Electric, plans to build a farm for 4,000 megawatts (4 Gw) that is
planned in 4 phases for ultimate completion in 2014. This project has been publicized all
around the world in every language imaginable.


msnbc.msn.com


cnn.com


usatoday.com


Now we are supposed to believe that American Superconductor just received an order
for 10 Gw to be delivered by 2011. That is 2 ½ times the size of the Pickens project in a
time span that is half the time. Yet, nowhere in any language do we see an order
awarded to Sinovel that would support anything close to this.


This order cannot live in a vacuum. Nowhere can we read of the: funding, the
customers, or suppliers of other components that are essential to wind turbines, such as
gearboxes, generators, blades, bearings, cast hubs or towers, which comprise
80%-90% of the cost of a wind unit. We are to believe that every other customer
involved in this deal has decided not to put out any press.


An order of this size would be the largest order for windpower in the history of the
world... but we can read about it only in one place: an AMSC press release.


Not to carry on but let’s look at how ridiculous this really is. General Electric is one of the
top 5 largest companies in the world. When they received an order for 1,000 MW of
wind power they put out a PR.

Let’s Get One Thing Straight


Analyzing the PR


Sinovel is a small company that did not even put out a pr when they got an order more
than 10x that size…guess they didn’t want anyone to get “wind of it”.


The Pickens project is supposed to cost up to $12 billion for all 4 Gw, therefore using the
same math this Sinovel project would cost up to $30 billion in the next 3 years. Where is
the financing for $30 billion in wind projects? Is it contingent on anything? What a great
job Sinovel has done at keeping this secret.


American Superconductor DOES NOT manufacture wind turbines. They make a power
controller and electrical components that are commodities in the wind power business.
They are low margin items in a highly competitive industry, and among the only
components in wind turbines not facing significant logistics and supply constraints. So
any order for electrical components from AMSC should be matched with orders for
essential components necessary to complete wind turbine projects.


Let us look at the headline of this tremendous pr, “AMSC receives $450 million follow on
order from China’s Sinovel Wind.”


http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080610/20080610005242.html?.v=1


First thing we notice is the company refers to their customer as Sinovel Wind. That is
funny because the real name of the customer is Sinovel Windtec.
http://www.sinovel.com/


The PR mentions no delivery schedule, no minimums, no cancellation fees. What
happens if AMSC makes all of these power controllers and then Sinovel decides in two
years they can buy them cheaper in China? Considering the prices of these systems is
not going up and soon they will be manufactured by local Chinese companies, shouldn’t
that be a concern for AMSC?

It’s in the numbers… NOT


A Closer look at Sinovel


*notice on the bottom of the Sinovel website they admit themselves that they have a
maximum capacity of 1000 units…strange considering today’s PR announced orders to
“support” 9,0000 units. Better yet, on the bottom left of the website written in Chinese
(the blue writing) it says “website under construction”. If you are going to build the
biggest wind system in the world how about first making a website.


Yes, the customer shares the same name as the AMSC subsidiary Windtec. As
suggested by Citron in the past, this is somehow a related party transaction as these
companies are joint ventured. That has not only been mentioned by Citron, but their joint
venture has also been commented on in industry press. In an article in Modern Power
Systems only two weeks ago referred to the Sinovel Windtec as a joint venture 3x in the
same article. Something just isn’t right.


So if they are selling 9,000 systems to Sinovel, who is their next largest customer? This
is a tie — there are two customers who have each bought 20 systems each.


A critical glance at AMSC’s 10-K leaves more questions than answers, as every
accounting red flag jumps out. 


$15.5 million in “unbilled receivables”


Zero allowance for doubtful accounts


And our favorite is the recording of revenue on a cost of completion basis.


Between the unusual gross margins and issues with the warranty accrual, the 10-K
deserves its own report.


An examination of Sinovel’s finances and the AMSC’s acquisition of Windtec make it
very clear how unlikely it is that a multi-billion dollar wind turbine deal (an arms-length
one at that) has grown out of the ground in less than 18 months.


As of Dec 31, 2006, these numbers appear in Sinovel’s D&B:

In early 2007, AMSC acquired Windtec, and by September 2007, Sinovel had placed
orders worth $90 million with AMSC. Assuming that the electrical subsystem
components supplied by AMSC comprise 5% of completed wind turbine installations,
this would have represented $1.8 billion in deliverable wind turbine commitments.


Investors are due an explanation as to how this bonanza comes into being.


Is there an undisclosed financial relationship between Sinovel and Windtec, which
requires restating all these transactions?

Insider sales


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
Join the next boom » 


Are these fungible orders according to US GAAP – where are the funds necessary
to pay for this magnitude of purchase?


What about announcement of the projects – which would clearly be the world’s
largest wind projects, including location and funding disclosures and timeframes?


Are firm commitments in place for the blades, bearings, gearboxes, castings/hubs,
and towers, all supply constrained components, which are necessary to fulfill these
contracts?


A relentless drumbeat of insider share sales – over 500,000 shares in just the last 60
days – completes the picture. CEO, Directors, CTO … if things are so great, it sure
makes you wonder why all the officers are running to the bank.
