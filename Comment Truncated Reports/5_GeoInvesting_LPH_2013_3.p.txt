China Central Television Coverage Of Longwei Petroleum Reinforces
GeoInvesting's Findings Of Fraud

On Monday, January 28, 2013, China Central Television Channel One (CCTV-1), the
largest national Chinese government-run news network, aired a special investigative
report titled "Investigation of the Truth Behind Longwei Petrochemical" verifying our
findings on the Longwei Petroleum (LPH) fraud.


See the CCTV video here.


To our knowledge this is the first time that China's state-run CCTV has come down so
strongly against a China-based company accused of fraud. CCTV cites our report several
times, makes several similar observations, and arrives at the same conclusion.


Highlights of the CCTV special report include:


Overgrown vegetation still covering the rail spur to the Gujiao facility.
No employee or tanker truck traffic for the five hours (between 12 and 5pm) that the
reporter filmed the Gujiao facility.
