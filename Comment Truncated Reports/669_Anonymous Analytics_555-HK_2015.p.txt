 REXLot’s de minimis interest income 
suggests its publicly reported cash

REXLot Holdings (“REXLot” or “the Company”) is a Hong Kong-listed company engaged in the lottery 
business in China, trading under the ticker 555.HK. 
 
REXLot operates both an online and an offline business. The online business consists of website and 
mobile platforms, and the offline business includes lottery machines and scratch cards. REXLot has 
promoted the online business as a growth opportunity, and promoted the traditional offline business as 
a stable, recurring source of revenue that funds dividend payouts. 
 
However, our review and analysis shows that the scale of both these businesses are a mere fraction of 
what REXLot claims, demonstrating to us that REXLot has committed securities fraud by making 
repeated false and misleading representations regarding its financial and operational performance to 
the market. 
 
Based on our detailed analysis of publicly available information including REXLot’s HK filings, third-party 
documentation, SAIC filings, and market research, we believe that REXLot has been wildly overstating 
revenue and profits, and that the cash balance REXLot reports is likely also grossly exaggerated.  
 
Furthermore, REXLot has been issuing substantial amounts of debt to finance dividend payments and 
make questionable acquisitions. Based on the evidence, we believe REXLot will be cut off from the 
capital markets. Without the ability to raise funds, we expect REXLot will struggle to maintain its 
dividends and will likely collapse under the weight of its debt.  
 
Ironically, we see investing in REXLot as a lot like playing the jackpot lottery – shareholders are betting 
on a pipe dream.

Introduction
3 
 


 
 
REXLot operates both an online and offline lottery business in China.  
 
Online business: the online business consists primarily of the lottery website www.okooo.com. For 
2014, Okooo represented 100% of REXLot’s web operations,


 
and 36% of total reported revenue. Our 


research shows that Okooo’s true revenue is a fraction of what REXLot reports to investors. Okooo is 
operated as a joint-venture between REXLot and an SOE partner. Both of these JV partners provide 
public disclosures on Okooo’s operations. However, these disclosures differ significantly, with the SOE 
partner reporting revenue figures for Okooo that are approximately 1/3 of those reported by REXLot.  
 
Independent market share data also supports the lower revenue figures reported by the SOE partner. 
 
Offline business: We believe that REXLot is inflating its offline business by overstating commission 
revenue from provincial customers. Government tender bids show that numerous provinces choose to 
purchase lottery machines as one-time buyouts rather than pay REXLot annual commission fees. These 
buyout contracts are significantly less lucrative, and generate a fraction of the revenue REXLot’s financial 
statements suggest. 
 
SAIC filings further support our view that REXLot is overstating its offline business revenue by at least 2x. 
 
Cash Games: REXLot’s reported interest income on its cash balance is between 0.12% to 0.27%. 
Meanwhile, a one-day call deposit in China offers at least an annualized rate of 0.8%. REXLot’s de 
minimis interest income suggests that the cash balance it reports is grossly exaggerated. 
 
Dividends: Since 2012, REXLot has paid out HK$583 million in dividends. However, in the last five years, 
REXLot has been free cash flow negative to the tune of approximately HK$1.9 billion. Accordingly, 
dividend payouts have been financed through the issuance of HK$3.3 billion in convertible bonds, which 
means investors have been financing their own dividends. 
 
Mystery acquisition: Much of the funds from the convertible bonds have been used to acquire 
businesses with no assets or operations. We believe that these nebulous acquisitions are nothing more 
than a corrupt management team perpetuating a capex fraud to funnel a combination of fake profits 
and real money out of REXLot.  
 
Captive Auditor: REXLot uses an obscure auditor who only has five Hong Kong-listed companies as 
clients, most of which are microcaps. This choice of auditor is unusual for a Company with a +US$600 
million market cap.  
 
Valuation: Based on the evidence and our analysis, we value REXLot at HK$0.12 per share, implying 75% 
downside from their current price of HK$0.49.  
 
 
 


Executive Summary

強烈沽售 – 御泰中彩(00555) 目標價: HK$0.12  潛在跌幅: 75% 


御泰中彩主要業務包括線上及線下彩票業務。線上業務主要是澳客網 (www.okooo.com) ，是御泰中彩的主要增長來源


。線下業務主要是提供中國福利彩票 (“福彩”) 和中國體育彩票(“體彩”) 的電腦彩票終端機銷售及維修，被御泰中彩管理


層定為一個維持派息的穩健業務及集團根基。 


線上業務被嚴重誇大: 線上業務主要指澳客網 (www.okooo.com)，佔御泰中彩 2014 總收入 36% 及網上業務收入


100%。深入調研結果發現澳客網的收入被嚴重誇大。澳客網的營運公司是人民日報旗下人民網 (SH603000)  跟御泰中


彩的合資公司。根據人民網 2013 和 2014 年年報對澳客網合資公司作出的合併財務披露，澳客網的實際收入只及御泰


中彩披露的三分之一。 


市場佔有率數據亦反映御泰中彩所披露的數據的嚴重誇大性。根據權威第三方市佔率數據，在美國上市的 500 萬彩票


網 (US:WBAI) 的 2014 市佔率是澳客網的一倍，但收入卻少於御泰中彩所披露的澳客網的收入，充份反映出御泰中彩


線上業務收入的不合理性。 


根據權威第三方市佔率數據、500 萬彩票網的財務披露及人民網對澳客網的合併財務披露，我們相信澳客網業務大約只


有御泰中彩披露的三分之一。 


線下業務的謊言: 線下收入主要來自電腦福彩終端機業務。據御泰中彩管理層的說法，所有線下福彩收入是以一定比


率去提取所覆蓋省的電腦彩票銷售總額，即扣點模式 (commission method)。但多個省的福彩終端機投標/中標公告卻


顯示福彩終端機供應商 (即御泰中彩的附屬深圳思樂數據技術有限公司) 的收入模式是一次性買斷 (buyout method)。行


業專家亦指出一次性買斷模式和扣點模式的市場覆蓋率各佔大約一半。同樣的終端機，扣點模式比一次性買斷模式多賺


至少一倍。 


國家工商行政管理總局資料亦顯示深圳思樂數據技術有限公司的 2013 收入只有人民幣三億，御泰中彩披露的收入卻有


接近人民幣六億半。 


我們相信御泰中彩的線下業務被誇大了至少一倍。 


對其他財務數據及公司營運的質疑 


現金: 御泰中彩在過去三年只有 0.12% 至 0.27% 的銀行利息收入，中國境內一天通知存款的年利率卻有 0.80%。反映


公司所披露的現金被嚴重誇大。 


股息: 自 2012 年，御泰中彩共派出 5.83 億股息。過去五年，公司的自由現金流大約負十九億。同期，御泰中彩亦發


行了總值三十三億的可換股債劵。我們相信，御泰中彩過去幾年的股息基本上來自這些債劵。 


收購: 過去幾年，大部分可換股債劵資金都用於收購一些沒有實質資產及當時沒有業務的公司。在往後的公司年報，


這些被收購的公司也再沒有被提及。我們有理由相信管理層籍着這些莫明奇妙的收購來偷取上市公司的資金及掩飾被誇


大的盈利及現金。 


審計師: 御泰中彩作為一間市值超過港幣五十億的上市公司，卻聘用四大或二線會計師行以外不知名的會計師行。這會


計師行同時為御泰中彩大股東陳孝聰的另一間最大控股上市公司御濠娛樂 (00164) 作審計服務。這兩間以陳孝聰為主


要股東的公司佔去這會計師行負責的僅五間上市公司的審計收入 55%，令人質疑這會計師行作為為公眾把關角色及防


止上市公司欺詐的動力和能力。

REXLot’s online business consists primarily of the lottery website www.okooo.com (“Okooo”), and to a 
lesser extent, its mobile platform where individuals can buy lottery tickets through texts or apps. Okooo 
is the crown jewel of the online business, representing 100% of all web operations,


 1
 and 36% of total 


reported revenue in 2014 (another 10% of revenue comes from the online mobile platform): 
 
Breakdown of REXLot’s Business Divisions 


 
Source: March 2015 REXLot investor presentation, slide 19  





Between 2009 and 2014, the online business has been REXLot’s only growing segment. But despite 
Okooo’s significance, REXLot has never discussed the operation. Except for a vague disclosure regarding 
the acquisition of Okooo in 2011,


2
 there are no other mentions of the business in any of the 2011, 2012, 


or 2013 annual reports.  
 
As we determined through our investigation and analysis, REXLot’s unusual silence likely has to do with 
the fact that Okooo’s reported numbers are vastly overstated.

In Need of a White Knight 
 
REXLot acquired Okooo in 2011, but it wasn’t long before problems followed. According to news articles, 
in May 2013, www.okooo.com was shut down for over 20 days. Okooo’s official explanation seems to 
have been that their servers were down, and they did not have back-up servers.


3
 


 
However, given the length of time the servers were down (20+ days is absurd), many users did not buy 
the official story. With users unable to withdraw their money, speculation ran rampant – suggestions 
that the system was hacked, that Okooo’s personnel had been caught and questioned by police on 
failure to distribute all prize money, and that Okooo had sold unauthorized lottery tickets online.


4,5
 


 
Following these events, Okooo suffered reputational and financial damage. To save Okooo, REXLot 
established a joint-venture with People.cn, called “People’s Okooo”, in September 2013. People.cn is a 
subsidiary of People’s Daily, the official, and most influential newspaper in China, and is a listed 
company on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SH:603000).  
 
As part of the People’s Okooo JV, People.cn took a 40% stake in Okooo (later reduced to 36.67% in 
2014)


6
, as well as control of three out of five board seats.

Today, Okooo’s website clearly states that Okooo is “a brand under People.cn”: 
 


 
 
Despite Okooo being REXLot’s primary online property and key revenue generator, there are no 
disclosures in REXLot’s 2013 annual report that give shareholders any indication that REXLot had just 
lost a 40% economic interest and majority board control of Okooo to People.cn.  
 
Normally, this restructuring and loss of control would have triggered accounting issues that, if recorded 
and properly disclosed, would have tipped off shareholders, including hits to revenue and income 
figures.   
 
However, despite losing control of Okooo, REXLot’s management decided to consolidate the results of 
the JV as part of its 2013 financial statements, effectively making it seem like nothing had happened. 
Later, in REXLot’s 2014 annual report, Management would offer a rationalization for the 2013 
consolidation by stating:  
 


“…it had been the Company’s intention to increase its exposure in electronic lottery 
distribution platform especially on the web and mobile platforms. Such an intention 
naturally involves a plan to incrementally acquire the remaining interest in Beijing Okooo 
and additional interest in the [People’s Okooo].”

8 
 


In what must have been an embarrassing and awkward moment for REXLot, People.cn also consolidated 
the operations of People’s Okooo following the JV. But unlike REXLot, People.cn actually had a valid 
accounting basis for the consolidation – it controlled three out of five board seats, and therefore had 
control of the entity. 
 
In 2014, REXLot did an about-face and decided to de-consolidate Okooo from its 2014 financial results. 
In doing so, Management provided the following explanation: 
 


“In January 2015, a self-inspection program was carried out by provincial lottery centers 
in China… As a result, the Group’s internet based lottery distribution unit has temporarily 
suspended its internet lottery distribution services effective from March 2015 (the 
“Suspension”). It is uncertain when the operation of the Group’s internet based lottery 
distribution unit will resume… The management is of the view that in practice, the Group 
no longer has the ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities of the PRC Company. 
Hence, the Board resolved to deconsolidate [People’s Okooo] and treat it as a long term 
investment of the Group.”


9
 


 
 
It’s not clear why Management would de-consolidate Okooo from its 2014 financial results when the 
online lottery suspension occurred in 2015. The explanation provided by REXLot is dubious at best. 
However, in de-consolidating Okooo, Management had little choice but to provide additional 
information on the unit in order to explain how the deconsolidation would affect REXLot’s overall 
results. 
 
Among the disclosures, Management broke out how much revenue Okooo contributed to REXLot in its 
2015 investor presentation. While REXLot does not make the presentation readily available on its 
website (we wonder why) an analysis of the numbers shows that REXLot overstated Okooo’s revenue by 
nearly 3x.

Mismatched Disclosures between REXLot and People.cn 
 
Recall that after the JV in 2013, both People.cn and REXLot had an ownership stake in Okooo and both 
consolidated the results into their financial statements for different reasons. Accordingly, both 
companies provide some level of disclosure regarding the operations of the JV. Save for minor 
differences between accounting standards and FX, these operating disclosures should be similar. 
However, the revenue generated by Okooo as reported by REXLot is 262% that of reported by 
People.cn. 
 


REXLot disclosures 
 
According to REXLot’s 2015 investor presentation, Okooo contributed HK$947 million (814M + 133M) in 
2014 without de-consolidation (Management states in the 2014 financial results that all internet related 
operations were conducted through the Okooo platform): 
 


 
  Source: March 2015 REXLot investor presentation, slide 11  


 
This HK$947 million figure is also contained in Daiwa Securities’ research report dated 9 April 2015 
(Daiwa Securities is one of the few brokers promoting REXLot, having served as underwriter to 
numerous REXLot bond issues):

10 
 


People.cn disclosures 
 
As a public company, People.cn also discloses Okooo’s financial results. In its 2014 annual report, 
People.cn states that revenue from Okooo in 2014 was RMB286 million, or HK$361 million.10  Again, 
People.cn consolidates Okooo, hence the disclosed results reflect the entirety of Okooo’s operations: 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
People.cn’s annual report also presents a minority interest section which further affirms that the above-
figures reflect the entire operations of Okooo.


11
 As presented below, this table shows that 63.33%


12
 of 


People’s Okooo is owned by a third party (presumably this would be REXLot), and that this third party is 
entitled to RMB56 million of net income. Accordingly, this implies that the total net income generated 
by Okooo in 2014 was RMB88.5 million (RMB56M ÷ 0.6333), which is consistent with the above 
disclosure by People.cn.

Furthermore, in the notes to its consolidated financial statements, People.cn explicitly states that: 
 


“As of end of reporting period, there are 36 subsidiaries included in the scope of 
consolidation including People’s Okooo, who generated revenue of RMB286 million 
during the period.”


13
 








 
It is clear that People.cn fully consolidates and reports all revenue generated by Okooo in its financial 
statements. It is also clear that REXLot and People.cn report very different revenue figures for Okooo: 
 


Exhibit 1 
Consolidated Okooo Revenue (2014) 
(In HK$ millions) 


REXLot – investor presentation 947 


People.cn – annual report 361 


Difference 2.62x 





People.cn falls under the control of a PRC State-Owned Enterprise (“SOE”) and is part of the official 
press site in China, and would have no reason to understate revenue from Okooo. 
 
On the other hand, REXLot’s online business is the Company’s only growth driver, which gives 
Management incentive to exaggerate Okooo’s operating results. Accordingly, we believe the 
inconsistent disclosures show that REXLot has been substantially inflating its online business.

Supporting Evidence: Market Share 
 
Another reason that we believe REXLot is inflating Okooo’s revenue is based on our review of market 
share data. We obtained market share information from www.enfodesk.com, which is a well-respected, 
premier data and internet analysis company in China, and considered independent from online lottery 
operators.

As per this data, Tencent (or QQ; 0700.HK), and Taobao (or Alibaba; BABA.NYSE) are the biggest industry 
players given the sheer volume of referral traffic from their core web properties. Apart from these big 
internet brands, 500.com (WBAI.NYSE) is also a major stand-alone online lottery operator.

This 2014 market share data shows that 500.com is twice the size of Okooo, capturing between 5.8% - 
8.5% of PC-end online lottery sales, while Okooo capture between 2.9% - 4.2%. On the mobile-end side, 
Okooo’s market share is not even ranked due to its insignificance. 
 
Despite 500.com’s substantial market share advantage, REXLot reports questionably higher revenue 
than its better-performing competitor, at RMB746 million for REXLot versus RMB580 million for 
500.com. This purported higher revenue defies logic.

Furthermore, the market share data is consistent with the smaller Okooo revenue figure as reported by 
People.cn. Commission revenue for online lottery operators can be calculated by the following formula: 
 


(Total online lottery sales) x (Market share) x (Commission rate, aka cut rate) 
 
 
Online lottery sales in 2014 were RMB85 billion.


14
 We also assume Okooo’s market share was 


approximately 4.2% based on the share data from Exhibit 2. Finally, we know that the average cut rate 
for online lottery platforms is around 8%.


15
 Putting these numbers into the formula, we get total 2014 


revenue generated by Okooo as: 
 


RMB85 billion x 4.2% x 8% = RMB285.6 million 
 
 
This revenue number matches perfectly with People.cn’s disclosure: 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
Once again, this independent data shows that REXLot has substantially inflated its web revenue. While 
REXLot’s Management has tried to promote the online business as the Company’s growth driver, market 
share data, as well as disclosures by its own JV partner show that REXLot’s reported online revenue is 
fictitious and grossly exaggerated.

Management’s Likely Excuse 
 
Before 2014, Okooo’s operations had been a mystery to investors. As we previously noted, except for a 
brief acquisition announcement, Management made no further mention of Okooo in any of its 2011, 
2012, or 2013 annual reports. 
 
We believe that after the 2013 JV with People.cn, REXLot became aware that People.cn was breaking 
out the financial results of Okooo, which could potentially expose REXLot’s misstatements. Therefore, in 
2014 when Management had to de-consolidate Okooo and provide additional disclosures related to the 
unit, it seems that REXLot attempted to create a ‘plug’ line in order to explain away any discrepancies. 
Below is an organization chart of Okooo and its revenue flows, as presented by Daiwa Securities in their 
9 April 2015 report: 
 
                Exhibit 3 


 
 
 
Presumably, this chart was created by Daiwa with input and guidance from REXLot’s Management. We 
believe this chart is a tool that Management will use in response to our findings. This chart shows that 
approximately 1/3 of the revenue from Okooo goes to the People’s Okooo JV, while 2/3 go directly to 
REXLot’s subsidiary. In this way, Management can deflect uncomfortable questions by claiming that the 
reason People.cn’s disclosures show Okooo as 1/3 the size of what REXLot claims, is because People.cn 
only receives 1/3 the revenue from Okooo. The other 2/3, Management can claim, goes straight from 
Okooo to REXLot and therefore, People.cn never sees that amount, and thus does not consolidate it. 
 
We reviewed this possible explanation, but find it completely lacks credibility for the following reasons: 
 
First, People.cn states multiple times throughout its annual report that it fully consolidates the 
operations of People’s Okooo, even going as far as to break out a minority interest section. 
 


Plug
15 
 


Second, independent market share data completely supports People.cn’s version of Okooo’s financial 
position.  
 
Third, based on our research, we are confident that the ‘plug’ line highlighted above cannot exist nor 
can it justify the revenue discrepancy. In fact, no direct revenue line between Okooo and REXLot should 
exist. All the revenue generated by Okooo must go to the JV, and only then can it get redirected to 
REXLot. 
 
Why? 
 
When the JV was established in 2013, the website operating licenses were transferred to the People’s 
Okooo JV: 


 
Source: http://www.okooo.com/node/944.html  


 
According to industry sources, commission revenue generated by an online lottery company is received 
directly from provincial lottery centers. These provincial lottery centers would not pay revenue to two 
different entities, but rather would only pay the entity that owns the operating license to run the lottery 
website. It is absurd to assume that a government institution that operates in a heavily-regulated 
industry would make a policy of paying a private operator that has no license to operate in the industry. 
Accordingly, all the revenue generated by www.okooo.com should go to the license holder (People’s 
Okooo) first, and only then can 2/3 of the revenue be redirected to REXLot’s subsidiary, Okooo Beijing. 
 
Therefore, the ‘plug’ line presented in Exhibit 3 above is unlikely to exist, and is not valid justification to 
explain why REXLot’s reported revenue for Okooo is nearly 3x greater than that reported by People.cn.

REXLot’s traditional offline business consists primarily of Welfare Computer Ticket Games (“CTG”), 
Welfare scratch cards, and Sports CTG (these games are regulated by PRC government lottery agencies 
and aptly named because they fund welfare and social programs or go towards the promotion of sports 
in China). 
 
The offline division is REXLot’s legacy business and growth has been relatively flat since 2008, with the 
division reportedly generating approximately HK$1.4 billion in revenue annually, as per the following 
investor presentation slide: 
 


 
Source: March 2015 investor presentation, slide 19 


 
 
With uncertainty surrounding the heavily regulated online lottery business, REXLot has promoted its 
offline business as a safe and reliable source of recurring revenue with limited downside. However, as 
with the online business, our research shows that REXLot has inflated its offline business as well.

The Offline Lottery Market 
 
The vast majority of REXLot’s offline revenue and EBITDA is generated by its Welfare CTG business. 
Accordingly, our discussion will focus on this market:

There are three prominent players in China’s Welfare CTG market, namely Sinodata Technology Co. Ltd. 
(“Sinodata”)


16
, Shenzhen General Lottery Technology (“SZ General”)


17
 and Guangzhou San Huan Yong 


Xin Technology Company (“GZSH”).

Welfare CTG requires lottery machines as well as back-end systems. To ensure compatibility, each 
province usually only picks one supplier for both. Sinodata is the subsidiary through which REXLot 
operates its Welfare CTG business, and is the largest market player covering 17 lottery provinces:

SZ General is a private company and the second largest market player, covering 10 lottery provinces. 
 
GZSH is a subsidiary of China LotSynergy Holdings (“LotSynergy”), which is another Hong Kong-listed 
company (1371.HK). GZSH covers the provinces of Chongqing and Guangdong, of which Guangdong is 
the largest lottery province in China, with an 8% share of total lottery sales. 
 
Historically, the provincial Welfare CTG lottery revenue model for operators has been based on the 
‘commission model’. Under the commission model, lottery machines are provided to provincial lottery 
centers free of charge and the owners of the machines collect a commission cut from the province as 
compensation. The revenue formula for the commission model is fairly simple: 
 


(National Welfare CTG sales) x (Market share) x (Commission rate) = Revenue 
 
 
This is the revenue model that REXLot has been touting to investors. We can see from the Company’s 
2015 investor presentation that the total size of the Welfare CTG market was RMB150 billion (HK$190 
billion), REXLot’s market share was 49%, and their commission rate was 0.94%:  
 





Plugging these numbers into the commission model formula, we get: 
 


HK$190 billion x 49% x 0.94% = HK$875 million 
 
This HK$875 million figure is consistent with the HK$865 million figure REXLot reports as revenue from 
its Welfare CTG business. So, when Management explains REXLot’s business with this type of simple 
clarity, it makes sense on the surface. However, this explanation is utterly misleading because the 
commission model is outdated and many provinces have long switched to a ‘buyout model’ which 
generates only a fraction of the revenue for suppliers like REXLot.
19 
 


According to industry sources, the commission model was popular circa 2005 – 2006. At that time, 
provincial lottery offices were financially weaker and over 80% of lottery provinces preferred the 
commission model, which had no large upfront costs. 
 
Today, approximately half the provincial lottery market operates through a one-off buyout model, 
wherein the provincial lottery office actually buys the machines from suppliers, and offers them a 
maintenance contract, usually lasting three to five years. This makes the buyout model less lucrative for 
suppliers. Furthermore, the provinces that have chosen to continue to operate on the commission 
model have reduced their cut rates to operators. Accordingly, the growth of lottery machine suppliers 
has been less than the growth of the overall Welfare CTG market.  
 
Regarding the economics of the buyout model, each lottery machine costs ~RMB12,000 – RMB16,000 
with varying maintenance fees depending on the contract terms. Below is an example of a recent tender 
and successful bid by Sinodata (REXLot) for Hunan province: 
 


 
Source: http://www.bidcenter.com.cn/newscontent-14295239-4.html  


1,130 Lottery Machines Tender Result 


Tender result announcement – Hunan Welfare Lottery Center – 


Purchase of Lottery Machines 


Unit cost: 
RMB 15,800 


Total amount: 
RMB17.854 million 


Quantity: 
1,130 


Winning unit: 
Sinodata 



http://www.bidcenter.com.cn/newscontent-14295239-4.html
20 
 


As this winning bid shows, Hunan is one of the provinces that uses the buyout model instead of the 
commission model. This contract represents the purchase of 1,130 machines and related maintenance 
expenses for a total value of RMB17.854 million.  
 
And how often do these purchase contracts come up? About once a year. 
 
According to an industry expert and online sources, each lottery machine generates ticket sales of 
approximately RMB1 million annually,


19,20,21
 and has a life cycle of 5 years (20% depreciation rate). We 


know that in 2013, Hunan’s Welfare CTG sales were RMB6.03 billion
22


 which means the province 
operates approximately 6,000 machines (RMB6.03B ÷ RMB1M). We can see that Hunan’s tender for 
1,130 machines is consistent with a 20% life cycle rate. Therefore, under the buyout model, REXLot 
would generate approximately RMB17.854 million in revenue each year from Hunan province. 
 
By contrast, if Hunan used the commission model, then REXLot as the exclusive operator in the province 
would generate estimated revenue of: 
 
Hunan Welfare CTG sales (2013): RMB6.03 billion 
Commission rate assumption (as reported by REXLot): 0.94% 
 


RMB6.03 billion x 0.94% = RMB56.7 million 
 
 


From this example, we can see that the buyout model generates less than one-third the revenue of the 
commission model.  
 
We believe that REXLot has been misleading investors by falsely implying that the commission model is 
the only model used in the Welfare CTG market. Accordingly, Management has inflated revenues by 
continuing to use this outdated revenue model, all the while its provincial customers have been 
switching to the buyout model.  
 
In fact, based on a simple internet search, we found that at least eight of REXLot’s 17 provincial 
customers use the buyout model, as evidenced by public tenders that state purchase amounts rather 
than commission amounts:

But it gets worse for REXLot. Of the 17

about half the average cut rate of 0.94% reported by REXLot:

This finding is in-line with industry sources who explained that the cut rate is generally 0.8% or lower. As 
another example, Guangdong province – China’s largest lottery province – offers a cut rate of only 
0.58%.


23
  


 
How REXLot can claim it generates a 0.94% cut rate is anyone’s guess. But what we are certain of is that 
REXLot has been overstating its Welfare CTG revenue by at least 2x by misleading investors into thinking 
that all its provincial customers use the commission model.

Supporting Evidence: SAIC Filings 
 
We obtained and analyzed SAIC filings for Sinodata,


 24
 which is the subsidiary through which REXLot 


conducts all its Welfare CTG business.
25


 According to its SAIC income statement, Sinodata generated 
revenue of RMB302 million in 2013 and paid taxes of RMB16 million: 
 
Exhibit 6 
2013 Income Statement 
(Shenzhen Sinodata Technology Co Ltd) 





 
Source: Sinodata SAIC filings, 2013 


 
 
REXLot Management claimed in its 2015 investor presentation that REXLot’s Welfare CTG business 
generated revenue of HK$814 million, or RMB614 million. This is more than double the RMB302 million 
reported in Sinodata’s SAIC filing.

 By way of background, Chinese companies are required to file annual financial and business information with the 
State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). SAIC filings are public documents.

Based on our analysis, we believe the Sinodata SAIC filings are accurate and represent the true state of 
REXLot’s Welfare CTG business. The supporting math is as follows: 
 
REXLot states that the Welfare CTG market in 2013 was worth RMB150 billion.


26
 As we previously 


stated, each lottery machine generates ticket sales of ~RMB1 million annually, which suggests there 
were 150,000 machines (RMB150 billion ÷ RMB1 million) operating in China in 2013. 
 
REXLot further claims 50% market share in 2013, which means it was the operator/manufacturer of 
75,000 machines that year (150,000 x 50%). Given the 50/50 split between provinces that have adopted 
the buyout model vs the commission model, 37,500 of these machines would be commission based, 
while the other half would have been sold through buyouts contracts. 
 
Total Commission model revenue (2013):  
 
Number of machines in operation: 37,500 
Revenue per machine: RMB1 million 
True cut rate: 0.58% 
 


37,500 x RMB1 million x 0.58% = RMB217.5 million 
 
Note: we use the cut rate of 0.58% which is the average of posted cut rates we could find, namely those 
offered by Fujian province (0.52%), Guangdong province (0.58%), and Shanghai (0.65%)


27
. We have a 


hard time believing REXLot’s stated cut rate of 0.94% is accurate given the evidence. 
 
 
Total Buyout model revenue (2013): 
 
Number of machines in operation: 37,500 
Purchase price per machine and associated maintenance fees (as per the Hunan tender): RMB15,800 
Replacement cycle of machines: 5 years 
 


37,500 x RMB15,800 ÷ 5 = RMB118.5 million 
 
 
Based on our high-level math, we believe REXLot’s Welfare CTG business should have generated 
approximately RMB336 million (RMB217.5 million + RMB118.5 million) of revenue in 2013. This is 
consistent with the Sinodata SAIC filing showing revenue of RMB301.6 million in 2013. 
 
Considering the public tender offers, the supporting Sinodata SAIC filing, and our market analysis, we 
are confident that REXLot has overstated its Welfare CTG business by 2x.

Given that it appears that REXLot is vastly overstating its revenue and profit figures, it is likely that the 
Company’s reported cash balance is also fictitious. Since 2012, REXLot has kept a rolling cash balance of 
at least HK$800 million or more. Yet the interest income earned on this balance has been almost non-
existent:

Interest income 1.9 3.1 1.5 


Interest rate 0.21% 0.27% 0.12% 


Source: company annual reports 
 
 
Between 2012 and 2014, the interest rate REXLot received on its cash balance has been 0.27% or less, 
annually. Meanwhile, a one-day call deposit in China offers at least an annualized rate of 0.8%. If 
REXLot indeed maintained a minimum cash balance of HK$800 million as reported in the financial 
statements, then the Company should have generated at minimum HK$6.4 million in interest income 
per year. REXLot’s de minimis interest income suggests that the cash balance it reports publicly to 
investors is grossly inflated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Cash Games

Part of REXLot’s appeal – particularly to retail investors – is its dividend payout. Shares currently offer a 
dividend yield of 6.4%, and since 2012, the company has paid out HK$583 million to shareholders. On its 
own, these payouts provide a veneer of legitimacy to REXLot’s reported financials. However, these 
dividends have not been funded through internally generated means. In fact, in the five years between 
2010 – 2014, REXLot has been free cash flow negative to the tune of HK$1.9 billion:

Free cash flow (197) (522) 130  172  (1,452) (1,868)

Instead, the dividend payout has been funded through incessant and asinine capital raises:

Since 2011, REXLot has raised HK$3.3 billion through convertible bonds, which far eclipse the HK$583 
million the Company has paid out to shareholders. The most egregious of these raises was in 2014, 
when the Company inexplicably raised HK$1.9 billion despite reporting over HK$1.1 billion cash on hand 
at year-end 2013. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Dividend Payouts and Capital Raises
27 
 


 
 
Aside from financing dividend payments, much of the cash raised seems to have gone towards a string 
of mysterious acquisitions. For example, from 2010 – 2014, REXLot spent HK$367 million acquiring: 
 


 2010: Winrest International Limited (“Winrest”) for HK$176 million in cash
28





 2012: Berkeley Services Limited (“Berkeley”) for HK$184 million in cash
29





 2014: 51% of Pointe Global Limited (“Pointe”) for HK$7 million in cash with an option to acquire 
the remaining 49% for HK$100 million.


30
 


 
Except for brief statements regarding their respective acquisitions, these companies were never heard 
from again in any follow-up discussions. How, or even if, these acquisitions contribute value to REXLot 
remains unclear. 
 
For example, when Winrest was acquired in 2010, REXLot Management noted the “fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired group of subsidiaries was 
considered as nil balance”.


31
  


 
Moreover, Management noted that “at the balance sheet date, [Winrest has] not yet commenced their 
lottery business and therefore they did not contribute any revenue nor profit to the Group”.


32
 


 
It seems that HK$176 million of cold, hard cash buys… nothing. 
 
The story is the same with the acquisition of Berkeley in 2012. REXLot paid HK$184 million in cash for a 
company that once again had no identifiable assets or business operations.


33
 


 
The same happened again in 2014 when REXLot acquired a 51% interest in Pointe, which had no 
identifiable assets or business operations.


34
 We fully expect that REXLot will exercise their option and 


acquire the other 49% of Pointe for HK$100 million. After all, it’s hard to see these nebulous acquisitions 
of companies with no discernable assets or operations as anything more than a corrupt management 
team perpetuating a capex fraud to funnel a combination of fake profits and real money out of REXLot. 
 
Without this report exposing Management’s conduct, it seems like there would have been no end to 
these outrageous acquisitions. In the circular for the 2014 convertible bonds issue, Management states 
that 70% of the HK$1.9 billion raised will go towards “the Group’s business expansion through organic 
growth and potential joint venture and acquisition opportunities that may arise in the future.”

In fact, we believe much of the proceeds from the 2014 convertible bonds issue have already left the 
Company. Shortly after the bonds were issued, the “prepayment” line item on the asset side of the 
balance sheet jumped from HK$947 million at year-end 2013 to HK$2.1 billion at year-end 2014.


36
  


 
There is no coherent explanation of what this cash outflow is supposed to have paid for, but in the 2014 
annual report, Management rationalizes this 124% jump in prepayments as: 
 


1) 32% of the increase (HK$377 million) was due to the de-consolidation of Okooo.
37


 
2) The remaining 68% increase (HK$801 million) was due to the “ordinary course of business… 


made to expand the Group’s existing off-line and on-line distribution platforms which is in line 
with the growing PRC lottery market.”


38
 


 
 
Management’s explanation for the remaining 68% increase in prepayments makes no sense. According 
to the Ministry of Finance, the Welfare CTG market (REXLot’s main offline market) only grew by 10.9% in 
2014.


39
 Meanwhile, the online market has been crushed and in limbo due to regulatory issues.  


 
It’s hard to fathom what “growing PRC lottery market” REXLot is referring to in its statement. This leaves 
most of the HK$801 million that has already left the company unaccounted for. In all likelihood, 
Management will soon disclose that these prepayments went to the acquisition of yet more shell 
companies with no assets and no operations. 
 
We don’t imagine shareholders and bondholders will ever see much of this money again.

REXLot’s choice of auditor is a zero-tier Hong Kong CPA firm named Ting Ho Kwan & Chan (“THKC”). The 
use of such an obscure auditor is unusual for a listed company with a +US$600 million market cap. In 
fact, THKC is so small that it only has five clients listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange:

REXLot is by far THKC’s largest HK-listed client. Interestingly, THKC’s second biggest client is REX Global 
Entertainment, which is connected to REXLot through a substantial shareholder named Victor Chan How 
Chung.


40,41 
Approximately 55% of THKC’s 2014 auditing fees from HK-listed clients came from REXLot and 


REX Global Entertainment.  
 
To be fair, there is nothing wrong with being a small firm. However, given the substantial revenue 
stream tied to REXLot, we question how much incentive THKC has to act seriously in its capacity as 
gatekeeper to the public and prevent fraud at REXLot. 
 
For its part, it makes no sense for REXLot to choose THKC over a Big Four auditor or even a second-tier 
auditor. The additional fees would be miniscule compared to the valuation premium the market would 
assign REXLot if it switched to a brand name auditor. 
 
REXLot’s choice of auditor suggests that it has actively sought out a CPA without the experience or 
capabilities necessary to properly and thoroughly audit a large, listed corporation for improprieties.

In 2014, REXLot reported revenue of HK$2.6 billion including Okooo. As the evidence shows, we believe 
at least half of this revenue has been fabricated and the Company’s true revenue is at most HK$1.3 
billion. 
 
Regarding income, Daiwa Securities states in their report that the net profit margin for Okooo is around 
30%. Likewise, Sinodata’s SAIC filing shows margins of 29% for the Welfare CTG business. Accordingly, 
we assign 30% net profit margins to our adjusted revenue to get 2014 net income of HK$395 million. 
 
Finally, we note that most suspected frauds trade at low multiples of 3-4x due to overhanging concerns 
and issues of management integrity. We believe REXLot deserves a lower-end multiple given its heavy 
debt load, the fact that the offline business is not growing, and the fact that its online web operations 
have been shut down and are in jeopardy given the uncertain regulatory environment.

To conclude, our investigation and analysis shows that both of REXLot’s businesses are a mere fraction 
of what the Company claims, demonstrating that REXLot has materially fabricated the scale of its 
business to the market, and thereby committed securities fraud.   
 
Through our detailed analysis of publicly available information including REXLot’s Hong Kong filings, 
third-party documentation, SAIC filings, and market research, we believe that there is substantial 
evidence that REXLot has been wildly overstating revenue and profits, and the cash balance that REXLot 
reports is likely also grossly exaggerated. 
 
Given the evidence, we believe that shares of REXLot will be halted from trading and that it will be cut 
off from the capital markets. Without the ability to raise funds, we expect REXLot will struggle to 
maintain its dividends and likely collapse under the weight of its debt.
