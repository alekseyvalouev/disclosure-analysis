Executive Summary

Spruce Point Estimates 60% – 75% Downside Risk 
($69 - $107/sh) At Cintas Corp. (NYSE: CTAS)


Based on a new public FOIA and our research, we believe Cintas’ Fire Protection Services business has committed fraud and is causing a public 
safety hazard by having workers conduct fire and safety inspections without proper licenses or permits, and falsify inspections. We call on Cintas 
to conduct a review to assure stakeholders it’s not a systemic issue placing Cintas in non-compliance with its credit agreement. Fire Protection is 
its fastest growing segment. Our research indicates that Cintas’ has a poor reputation, and that new private equity and public money is entering 


the space, which will compress its growth and margins. In addition, we believe that Cintas is facing financial strain in its core uniform rental 
business from its 2017 levered acquisition of G&K for $2.1bn. With sell-side analysts failing to acknowledge any of these problems, or conduct a 
nuanced valuation of its various business segments to reflect divergent growth and risk profiles, our variant view suggests 60%-75% downside.  


Core Uniform 
Business 


Under 
Pressure Post 


Levered $2.1bn
G&K 


Acquisition In 
2017 


We Believe Cintas Overpaid For G&K, Is Struggling To Integrate It, And Spinning A Weak “Beat And Raise” Story
 To consolidate share and extract synergies, Cintas acquired G&K Services in 2017 for $2.1bn with new debt. Based on 


proxy statement disclosures, Cintas paid an additional $425m above its initial offer to acquire a business that was 
described to us as having a poor reputation 


 Cintas touted a “Beat and Raise” story post acquisition, but based on our forensic review, it appears that Cintas may have 
suppressed G&K’s sales, only to raise sales guidance by a similar amount to the sales that had been suppressed


 Even worse, evidence points to Cintas over-estimating expenses, only to roll-them back and claim outperformance. In 
addition, Cintas said one thing, but did another by subtly changing capital priorities (cutting capex, increasing share 
repurchases) in an effort to artificially grow EPS. For FY 2019, we estimate Cintas had no underlying outperformance 
relative to initial guidance


 There are classic signs of a mismanaged acquisition and financial stress post acquisition:
• COO and 22yr Cintas veteran J Phillip Holloman “retired” in mid 2018
• Post deal closing, receivables are growing at nearly 2.0x sales; DSOs are at record levels; inventory growth is 


diverging from sales growth. Cintas’ credit facility size has increased 3x in size despite sales up only 40%
• Working capital to sales and bad debt has exploded to 20% of sales and 4% of receivables, respectively: both metrics 


are higher than Cintas and G&K on a standalone pre-acquisition basis. Cintas has still failed to consolidate its national 
receivables collections practice, while scores of customers are complaining about billing practices


• Cintas’s leverage is higher than it appears with material cash that is restricted and trapped abroad. We observe the 
Company is becoming more dependent on short-term financing with commercial paper as cash collections worsens


• Cintas recently sold a $73m investment for a reported 35x return, yet won’t disclose any details about the mysterious 
divestiture. The timing of the sale to generate cash is suspicious in context


• Weakness in oil and gas is emerging. Cintas took on added exposure to this industry from acquiring G&K
 Based on our analysis, ex: G&K’s financial contributions to Cintas, we find no underlying EBITDA margin improvement in 


the core Cintas business, and that earlier leverage benefits of EBITDA growing faster than revenues have evaporated

Spruce Point Estimates 60% – 75% Downside Risk 
At Cintas Corp. (NYSE: CTAS)


Fastest 
Growing Fire 


Inspection 
Business 
Operating 


Fraudulently 
While Putting 
Lives At Risk;


Competition 
Rising


 Recent changes in revenue disclosure reveal for the first time that Cintas’ fastest organically growing business is 
fire inspection, which has grown at a 3 year CAGR of 14%, above the historical and projected industry growth 
rate of 8% as illustrated by National Fire Prevention Association 


 Based on our research, the biggest fundamental challenge in the industry is a qualified labor shortage. Cintas 
has used an “affiliate network” to expand its reach, but this approach brings challenges such as monitoring the 
quality and capability of its workforce


 Using a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, we find that Cintas was charged with fraudulent business 
practices. Upon a fire outbreak in Aurora, IL, it was determined that Cintas had 8 of 12 inspectors unlicensed and 
unfit to carry out inspection duties for the 22 properties within Aurora’s jurisdiction. These inspectors were thus 
falsifying inspection records. Based on our research, we believe this may not be an isolated incident, and that 
Cintas may have breeched its credit agreement by incorrectly representing that it holds all the necessary licenses 
to conduct its business in compliance with the law


• Cintas must conduct an independent and formal review to assure all its stakeholders that it is in compliance 
with all applicable laws, and holds all necessary permits when conducting life-critical inspection operations


• Cintas is also being sued in a wrongful death lawsuit for inaccurate inspections in a mining accident that was 
documented by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Incidents such as this, while very unfortunate, add 
complex tail risks to its business


 Given lapses in judgement such as this, and based on industry conversations, it doesn’t appear to be a secret in 
the industry that Cintas has a poor reputation. As a result, new money is flooding into the industry to disrupt 
Cintas’ national market position


• We find evidence that historical contracts that locked in customers for 3-5 years are being shortened to just 
1 year, and that prices are compressing; both are negative outcomes for Cintas


 Fueled by cheap financing and the ability to leverage contractually mandated inspection revenues, private equity 
players are creating regional platform acquisition vehicles to seize market share from disgruntled Cintas 
customers. In addition, APi Group, a large national competitor was just acquired by a UK SPAC, and will be listed 
on the NYSE, giving it broader access to public capital to compete against Cintas


Investors Misunderstand The Risks Associated With Fraud Conducted At Cintas’ Fast Growing Fire Protection Business

Governance 
Concerns 
Include 


Closeness of 
Management 


With The 
Auditor


Current Audit 
Partner Linked 
To Papa John 
Accounting 


Fiasco


 Spruce Point has various concerns about the Board including a lack a separation between its Chairman 
and CEO, Board and family relationships that are not independent, unjust compensation practices, and 
the closeness of Cintas with its auditor


 Ernst & Young has been Cintas’ auditor since 1968. The engagement partner at Ernst & Young is Craig 
Andrew Marshall. Mr. Marshall is also the audit engagement partner at Papa John’s International 
(Nasdaq: PZZA) 
• Papa John’s dismissed Mr. Marshall and E&Y in 2018. Since hiring KPMG in early 2019, Papa John’s 


disclosed a new material weaknesses of financial controls and reporting 
• Both Cintas’ CFO J Michael Hansen and its VP/Treasurer Paul Adler both worked at Ernst & Young
• Spruce Point believes it is time Cintas shareholders appoint a new auditor and fresh eyes to look at its 


accounting practices
 Cintas’ just appointed Karen Carnahan to its Audit Committee. Cintas claims she is “independent”, yet as 


a 30 year former Cintas veteran and Treasurer connected to CEO Farmer, we question why is she joining 
now in light of our views that Cintas is experiencing financial stress? Furthermore, we find that she 
serves as a Trustee of another Audit Director’s company, and is likely paid; can she act independently?


 Cintas management, with the blessing of the Board, claimed great performance for the G&K deal. Special 
bonuses were awarded to executives for completing the deal, despite our evidence it has weakened the 
overall financial profile of Cintas


 Cintas’ annual incentive plan is based on sales and EPS growth, along with non-financial goals. In 2019, 
41.75% of CEO Farmer’s bonus was tied to EPS performance, while for most other executives, it 
accounted for 50% of the bonus. Cintas conveniently achieved almost the maximum EPS target within 
one penny, and claims its $7.60 EPS took into consideration various “one-time items”. Yet, in FY 2019, 
Cintas adopted a new revenue recognition method that boosted pre-tax income by $22.3m and Diluted 
EPS by $0.15 cents. Why wasn’t this considered a “one-time” or “extraordinary” boost to income?

60% - 75% 
Downside For 
A Sum-of-The-


Parts 
Valuation of a 
Structurally 
Disliked And 


Misunderstood 
Company


 Analysts and investors love Cintas for its consistent ability to grow earnings, while returning capital through 
share repurchases, and a modest dividend yield. The consensus view is that it can produce 5-6% organic sales 
growth and 10-11% EPS growth by using its market dominance in stable industries to satisfy customers


 As a result, analysts’ reward Cintas with the highest multiple among its commercial and safety publicly traded 
peers. The average analyst price target is $255 per share. Yet, at the current share price of $259, there’s 1% 
implied downside on valuation alone, and materially more downside based on increasing business pressures


 Our view of Cintas is markedly different from consensus and we believe:
• There is a uniform displeasure with Cintas’ billing practices, one-style approach to customers, and 


willingness to skirt the law with fraudulent business practices that place lives at risk
• The G&K acquisition has worsened Cintas’ overall financial profile through greater capital intensity, 


bloating of receivables and bad debts, and greater exposure to cyclical industries such as oil and gas
• Cintas corporate governance is substandard for its size and position as an S&P 500 company. Notably 


the CEO/Chairman roles are not split, it allows pledging of stock by executives, and the Board is 
stacked with long-time allies of the CEO with business connections between Board members 


• As a result, the expansion of Cintas’ valuation multiple over the past few years is unwarranted
 Analysts fail to critically evaluate each of Cintas’ business lines and apply a proper valuation to reflect the 


different growth and risk profiles
 Despite trading a 4x sales and 18x EBITDA, not a single one of Cintas’ business lines can be justified at this 


valuation by looking at recent acquisitions completed. Transaction values are closer to 1x - 2x of revenues.  
When summed together, the fair value of Cintas’ business is $69 - $107, or 60% – 75% downside


Trading Near All-Time High Share Prices, Above Analyst Average Price Target,  And With An Expanded Multiple, Owning 
Cintas Is A Poor Risk / Reward; Sell-side Valuation Models Fail To Appreciate The Various Growth Risk Profiles For Each 


of Cintas’ Business Segments

Cintas Stakeholders Deserve A Full And Independent 
Review of Its Fire Inspection Business


Cintas has a sordid history in dealing with labor unions, settling lawsuits related to employment discrimination, and environmental 
compliance. Spruce Point finds it particularly troubling that individuals at Cintas committed fraud by misrepresenting that 8 of 12 
inspectors in Aurora, Illinois were certified to conduct fire inspections, which are critical to protecting the public. Cintas needs to 


conduct a fully independent, and audited review of its Fire Protection Services workforce to make sure it is conducting its business 
in compliance with the law. Innocent people should not be put at risk by unqualified inspectors hired by Cintas.

Growth Coming At The Expense Of Losing 
Control Over The Services Providers?

Was The “Affiliate” Program Started In Response To A Dept of Labor Investigation About Underpaying Fire Protection Employees?


Cintas Subsidiary Agrees To Pay Workers $1.3 Million In Overtime Case
Jan 19, 2017: The U.S. Department of Labor announced today that a subsidiary of Cintas Corp. has paid $1.3 million to compensate 81 fire sprinkler testers and 
installers for allegedly unpaid overtime.  Cintas, based in Cincinnati, provides work products and services, including uniforms. The wage case investigated by the Labor 
Department concerned overtime pay for workers based in the San Jose office of the company's Cintas Fire Protection Services subsidiary.  The department concluded 
that the company failed to pay the sprinkler workers the overtime due for an average of three hours per week spent on off-site tasks such as completing reports, 
sending emails and filling out time sheets, according to Deputy District Director Michael Eastwood..  (Source)


In FY 2016, Cintas started an “Affiliate Network” to recruit other business owners to provide fire safety services. 
Affiliates are essentially independent contractors, must provide a W-9 Form, and allow Cintas to lower its employment 
costs. The affiliate application requires applicants to provide a copy of the “State Contractors License and all required 


licenses”.  On the surface, it seems like Cintas has a legitimate concern for recruiting the appropriate workers to 
extend its business. However, what’s happening in practice in the field paints an entirely different story…..

But Results Are Not Sustainable:
Four Negative Trends In Fire Inspection 


Through our conversations with fire inspection industry professionals, we believe there are four very large challenges facing
Cintas that will impede its growth and profit potential in the industry.


Contract Lengths Are Shortening
 Historically, commercial contracts could be negotiated for 3 - 5 years, giving longer visibility to service providers


 This would allow Cintas to implement annual price increases easily


 Now, commercial and national contracts are being shortened to 1 year, allowing customers greater flexibility to price shop  


Margins Are Coming Under Pressure From Greater Competition
 For services such as fire extinguisher inspection, Cintas has historically been able to command $2.85 - $3.25 per unit


 According to our industry sources, Cintas has been willing to price as low as $1.50 per unit to win business. At this level, 
competitors we spoke to believed it was simply not economical to justify trying to match the price 


Not Enough Skilled Labor To Deliver Services In Compliance With The Law
 It’s universally agreed among people we spoke to that there’s not enough skilled and licensed inspectors 


 It can take between 3 – 5 years between apprenticeship to fully licensed worker


 There is evidence that Cintas committed fraud by allowing unlicensed workers to falsify inspection reports


Private Equity And New Money Is Flooding Into The Industry To Disrupt Cintas
 Cintas does not have a good reputation in the industry, as reflected by numerous internet complaints, and our primary 


research


 The opportunity to displace market share from Cintas, and the allure of recurring revenues from services mandated by 
law, is what is driving substantial private equity money in the industry


 There are new platform acquisition companies being launched to consolidate regional market share:


• APi Group, one of Cintas’ largest competitors, was just acquired by a SPAC in London and will be listed on the 
NYSE, giving it broader access to public capital

Cintas Placing Lives At Risk, Breaking The Law,  
And Committed Fraud With Unlicensed Fire 
Inspectors


Source: FOIA, City of Aurora, IL 
1) Illinois.gov


Upon a fire outbreak in the city of Aurora, IL, it was determined that Cintas was charged with fraudulent inspection practices. 
The city found that 8 of 12 Cintas inspectors were not licensed to carry out inspection duties for the 22 properties within its 
jurisdiction. Illinois state law clearly mandates a license for inspections.(1) Although it is possible this is an isolated incident, the 
mere fact that two-thirds of Cintas inspectors were not licensed suggests that Cintas growth in the Fire Protection business has


come at the cost of violating the law, and putting lives at risk.

Not An Isolated Incident


It is clearly not a one-off situation in Aurora. We also find another instance of Cintas doing inspection work without either a 
permit, or a contractor’s license.

Cintas Potentially Not In Compliance With Its 
Credit Agreement


Cintas made certain Representations and Warranties to its bankers that it “holds permits, certificates, licenses... necessary for the 
conduct of its business in compliance with all applicable Laws”…. Is this really true? If the licensing issue is systemic in its Fire 


Safety business, would this be deemed a Material Adverse Effect? Cintas needs to conduct a full audit of its workforce.

Cintas Prices And Margins Appear To Be 
In Contraction


Core fire extinguisher inspection pricing is contracting. Based on our industry conversations, we understand that Cintas has 
been willing to price as low as $1.50 per extinguisher, particularly to commercial and national customers, which are more price 


savvy. Recent prices suggest $2.85 - $3.25 per extinguisher.  At $1.50 pricing, some competitors thought it was not even 
economical to do the business. Some municipalities are being charged more, but as word spreads that Cintas is willing to do it 


for much cheaper, there is downside risk to pricing as contracts are renewed.

Enlightening Interview With Former Senior 
Business Leader At Cintas Fire Safety


“Talk about the challenges or, or maybe no challenges as the case may be, of finding skilled people to do these jobs, to go out and do the 
fire inspections.”


Spruce Point
Question


“Yeah. There's no question there's a constraint. I mean, every business in North America has fire extinguishers in their business, about 
70% of businesses, maybe 60% of businesses, have a fire alarm system, and then you might back that number down, but somewhere
around 50% that have a fire sprinkler system. So you can execute fire extinguisher inspections quite easily. I mean, you could hire someone 
that you know, has aptitude and hustle and you know, maybe slight mechanical ability and get them operational within 60 or 90 days 
pretty easily. When you get into alarm and sprinkler, uh, if you just went from someone that was competent and capable but didn't 
know anything about fire and you got them all the way to a fire alarm or sprinkler certification within a town, state or city; that could 
be a three year proposition…. And I mean there is that labor constraint out there. Um, so you're either going to find someone that 
already has their license, and try to take them away from your competitor, right? Or, you have a really advanced training program where 
you constantly have apprentices and helpers around these certified technicians, so you're raising up and grooming a group of future 
inspectors. If there's a bottleneck in this business, that's it.”

Question


“You wouldn’t be able to send somebody out there that's not licensed, right? I mean you're holding a man, again to just keep it simple, 
like a driver's license, here’s my sprinkler license it has an expiration date, it has a number on it that can be easily verified through website. 
So there would never not be a scenario where you’d send someone out to do an inspection that didn't have their certification. Yeah. I 
mean it is a felony for example. If you went out and inspected a fire alarm in Texas, and you inspected it, and said “you're good to go”, 
but didn't have your license. That is a felony for the individual that would do that.”


Former Cintas 
Fire Inspection Safety 


Business Leader


Spruce Point spoke with Cintas’ former fire inspection business leader. He agreed that skilled labor shortage is a real business
challenge, and that it would be fraudulent to represent oneself as a licensed inspector, without having the credentials. 


“What happens if Cintas sent someone who is supposed to licensed, and in fact, that person isn’t licensed, and something goes wrong. 
That’s a bad outcome.”


Spruce Point 
Question “What is driving private equity led M&A in the fire inspection and services industry right now?”


Former Cintas 
Fire Inspection Safety 


Business Leader


“I think a couple things. One, Cintas does a pretty good job of becoming hated in the spaces that they operate in, not by their investors, 
but by the industry patrons. So you know, the, the small businesses that are left out there, would have a bad taste in their mouth 
selling to Cintas. And there's people that are aware of that….”

Cintas Now Competing With Fresh 
Private Equity Money


If, as suggested by its former business manager, that Cintas is disliked by many in the industry, it would create a ripe opportunity 
for private equity to expand into the fragmented fire protection and inspection services space. Perhaps, a more customer friendly 


approach will enable it to win share from Cintas.

Cintas’ Fire Competitor APi Group 
To Be Publicly Listed


APi Group is a national, market leading provider of commercial life safety solutions and industrial specialty services, and expects 
to deliver ~$4 billion in revenue and Adj. EBITDA margins of ~10% for the full year 2019.  On September 2, 2019, J2 signed an


agreement to acquire APi for $2.9 billion, representing a transaction multiple of 7.4x LTM June 2019 Adjusted EBITDA of 
$371 million net of tax benefits. The deal closed in early October 2019, and it’s expected that APi will trade on the NYSE. As a newly 


formed public company, it will have better access to capital, and a public currency to attract and motivate employees. 


APi is a credible national competitor to Cintas that offers a full suite of safety solutions including engineering, design, installation, inspection, 
repair and monitoring. We believe Cintas offers a narrower range of services, and does not do the more lucrative repair business

Cintas Wildly Overpays For G&K


Cintas appears to have desperately needed to purchase G&K, raising its initial bid of $76.00 all the way to $97.50 per 
share. The final cost of $2.1 billion cost Cintas shareholders an additional $425 million over the initial price. The $97.50 


per share purchase price represented a 68.7% premium to GK’s 52 week low share price.

Jan 12, 2016
Mr. Farmer (Cintas CEO) met with Mr. Milroy (CEO of G&K) as scheduled. At the meeting, Mr. Farmer

In FY 2018, the last year that G&K can be unraveled from Cintas core business, we find that EBITDA growth fell below 
revenue growth and margins stalled. The CFO claims that legacy Cintas gross margins continued to expand, which is 


hard to disprove with limited disclosures; however, we believe legacy Cintas EBITDA margins did not expand.  


CFO: “The Cintas legacy gross margins continue to expand and the G&K gross margins will too

Management’s Gross Margin Expansion 
Claims Now Appear Baseless


Management repeatedly claimed that G&K’s gross margins will improve to Cintas’ legacy margins as it was marketing 
the transaction to investors. Yet, it’s now very evident that management never had a way to measure or track it, thus 


calling its claims into question. As a result, management is now dodging direct follow-up questions on the issue. 


“The Cintas legacy gross margins continue to expand and the G&K gross margins will too as we realize the 
acquisition synergies.”  


Cintas CFO

“While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate 
operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels 
as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track.”

“Really, really nice job. At this point, given the gross margins, is it fair to say -- and I know we're not just

“Well, as you referred to (gross margins), it's really hard to say. So for example, a lot of that G&K volume 
resides in legacy Cintas locations. So when you think about that volume, it certainly has helped us in those 
kinds of locations create more capacity utilization, create a little more density. And so there certainly is a 
benefit. From stand-alone locations, many of them have inherited some legacy Cintas volumes, but they're not 
quite to where we would see the rest of the Cintas legacy locations, but they're making nice progress. So we 
hope to continue to see improvements as we move forward.”

A classic sign of accounting shenanigans is when accounts receivable are growing faster than reported sales. It is often 
cited as a top red flag to predict fraud or accounting irregularities.(1,2) This phenomenon may suggest aggressive 


revenue recognition practices at best, a change in credit terms to customers, or at worst foul play such as channel 
stuffing. We observe that prior to acquiring G&K, Cintas’ cumulative sale and accounts receivables growth tracked each 


other very closely. However, we find that post deal closing, receivables are growing at nearly 2.0x sales.

New Disclosure On Discounts And Rebates 
Validates Concerns


We observe that Cintas made its first disclosure in October 2018 about certain contracts including “discounts and 
rebates” earned through specified volume levels. This indicates a more competitive environment. G&K did not make any 
such disclosures prior to its acquisition. While Cintas says it maintains a liability within its accounts for these discounts
and rebates, it does not break out the specific line item. However, as a whole, both long and short-term accrued liability 


accounts have grown from $600m to $764m since FY 2017.


Source: CTAS 10-Q 


“Certain of our customer contracts, primarily within our Uniform Direct Sales business, include pricing terms and 
conditions that include components of variable consideration. The variable consideration is typically in the form of 
consideration paid to a customer based on performance metrics specified within the contract. Specifically, some 
contracts contain discounts or rebates that the customer can earn through the achievement of specified 
volume levels. Each component of variable consideration is earned based on the Company's actual performance 
during the measurement period specified within the contract. To determine the transaction price, the Company 
estimates the variable consideration using the most likely amount method, based on the specific contract 
provisions and known performance results during the relevant measurement period. When determining if variable 
consideration should be constrained, the Company considers whether factors outside its control could result in a 
significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, the Company considers the likelihood and 
magnitude of a potential reversal. The Company's performance period generally corresponds with the monthly 
invoice period. No constraints on our revenue recognition were applied during the three months ended August 31, 
2018. The Company reassesses these estimates during each reporting period. Cintas maintains a liability for 
these discounts and rebates within accrued liabilities on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.”

CFO Statement About Working Capital 
And Inventory Not Mirroring Reality


“Yeah, when we -- our thoughts on working capital are when we are growing, we're going to use some working 
capital. So for example, if we're growing the way we want to grow. Accounts receivable is going to grow. 
Inventories are going to grow, in-service inventory is going to grow because we are injecting new inventory into 
new customers and penetrated customers. So generally speaking, we expect in a growth environment, we expect to

Accounts Receivable Dysfunction


Cintas appears to have organizational dysfunction when it comes to A/R collections. Rather than centralizing 
collections in one location, the Company employs hundreds of collection agents in locations across the country. 


It even still appears to have active G&K collection agents despite completing the deal more than two and half years 
ago. Management is claiming success with cost synergies, yet wouldn’t some of the easiest cost synergies have been 


from centralizing collection agents?

Spruce Point Interview With 
Uniform Industry Expert


“One consistent critical theme we see of Cintas in particular, but possibly industry-wide, is that contracts tend to lock customers in and then customers 
find out that prices are rising, automatically after certain periods of time. I mean, is this an industry that has good ability to pass on prices to customers? 
If you're putting through, price increases without, warning the customer, obviously that could irritate them, but there has to be some sort of pricing limit 
to the point where a customer might want to go somewhere else?


Spruce Point


“Yeah, you're hitting on a good point there. And let me say, you asked me earlier if I'd like to comment about why I didn't want to work for Cintas. 
You're hitting on exactly why I didn't want to work for Cintas. Cintas is the 10,000 pound gorilla. They do a good job of service. I'm not going to say they 
don't, they do a really nice job of servicing and many times they're long term customers like them well. The ones that like to be coddled and to be 
personalized, do not like them at all because Cintas has one way of doing business and only one way of doing business and so for that they kind of have a 
reputation of being a little bit hard nose, a little bit cold. They have a reputation of excessive billing and their excessive billing, which is not tied to a 
weekly amount. It's back tied to just what you started asking about the contracts, and the things of that nature, and that the terms of the contracts is 
enabled them to be able to do. On a national scale that I worked from, for the last 20 years, all of my contracts were completely custom crafted. I worked 
directly for an attorney and we literally had a boiler plate that we offered to our customer’s counsel in the beginning, but it was a back and forth, red line 
changes, et cetera; four, five, six times before we could come to the agreement of the language that we could all agree upon. We saw that Cintas didn't do 
that so much. Instead they offered a stock standard contract that had such vague terms in it so that the client didn't understand what he was agreeing to. 
And that is where a lot of the Cintas pain originates from.”


Industry 
Expert


“I really specialized in fire retardant clothing. And that is something that Cintas is just huge in they were the kind of the industry leader into rental of fire 
retardant clothing. But their national contracts were so vague that anytime a client was unhappy with their service and wanted to exit them, it costs 
them such a tremendous amount of money, because again, the contract vaguely said that if we believe that this merchandise is special, you agreed to 
buy it. Nowhere on that piece of paper does it say that the merchandise that I'm selling you, or I’m renting you, is considered specialty. So therefore when 
(customers) get ready to exit, Cintas comes to them and says, “Oh, well you owe me $9,000 for all the goods that we put upon your people”. And that then 
became a prohibitive to them to using other companies. And that in itself then is where they really got the bad reputation for contracts. Later in the 
years they got a little better.”


“Can I ask you your perception of the company called G&K? A couple of years ago Cintas bought G&K. What was your understanding of their reputation 
in the industry? 


Spruce Point


“G&K had a terrible reputation. Cintas has the problem to fix. G&K's service was more industrial than Cintas'. In other words, more of the welders or of 
the heavy construction type businesses, that sort of thing. Not so much hospitality. I think Cintas tends to have a little more hospitality, a little more health 
care. But I don't have much of a good opinion candidly of G&K. They were a contender. They were one of the big four that showed up always for RFPs, et 
cetera. And they, you know, they won their fair share, but they had some pretty ongoing serious service problems. They didn't have a good national 
program at all, and what I heard most of the really bad talk from them was about their national program. So maybe Cintas by owning them they 
brought them some structure in that regard, and that may have improved them somewhat”


Industry 
Expert


Spruce Point spoke with a 20+ year industry expert in the uniform rental business, who worked at a competitor, and expressed a 
desire not to work at Cintas. We asked for his opinion on Cintas’ contract billing practices and its acquisition of G&K.

Pricing Commentary From A Competitor…. 


Two different views on pricing, depending on which CEO you ask. Cintas sees no change, yet Unifirst sees 
consolidation causing disruption, customer dissatisfaction and prices tightening at big accounts.


“Is there anything that's changed from the competitive landscape or pricing environment or things that you found that you need to do from a scale

“Yeah. I think as you can imagine and we know this as much as anyone in the industry, when you do acquisitions of the size of an Arrow or even the 
smaller acquisitions we do; there is disruption in those local operations as you integrate the operations. In our business, to really take advantage of 
the synergies of these acquisitions, the route structure and the optimizing of the route structure is really very important. But that doesn’t happen 
overnight. When you think about it, when we provide our garments to our customers; half the garments are with our customers, some of whom are 
with their employees at their houses, some of them are back in the plant. And when you go to reroute customers, there can be disruption on that 
flow of the product. So it's not something you take on very lightly. And doing it on the scale that Cintas and Aramark will be doing it over the next 
couple of years is something that will lead to some disruption. In terms of what we're seeing in the market right now, we're seeing some of that 
disruption. And I think customers like stability and they like knowing that their service is going to be consistent. They don't want to change route 
drivers and so on and so forth. So some of that is leading to opportunities, I think, for us who can offer more stability during this time. As far as 
pricing goes, I don't think we've seen much change in the environment. I think where there is a change most notably is on the large account selling. 
If you're sitting at the table with a national account which maybe has one of our competitors as the incumbent and they're looking to make a 
change because there's some service dissatisfaction, now there's really only two players at the table.  So it does provide a little bit more 
transparency and maybe simplicity to the process. And we know who we're going against and what we might need to do and the advantages or 
disadvantage that we might have bidding on that account, whereas previously when there was maybe four or five people practically bidding on that 
account, including some larger regional players like an Arrow depending on the market; it can lead to challenges and one of those competitors 
potentially coming in with a very aggressive offer. So I think that's where you may see some of the pricing tightening. But at the same time, it's 
not necessarily because I think any of the competitors individually are being less aggressive than they were in the past.”

“The first question is just on consolidation in the space broadly. I know you've sort of outlined cost synergies. Maybe if you could touch on -- there's 
been another uniform deal in the space. Could you maybe touch on the revenue side? Do you expect pricing to get better in the space post-
consolidation? I realize it's a local business, so there may be some nuances there. So maybe if you could touch on that and then how to think about 
G&K revenue synergies..”


Cintas CFO 
Response


“So from the standpoint of pricing, the pricing environment, I would say, hasn't changed much in the last 90 days since we spoke last. And quite 
honestly, I don't expect that the consolidation that has happened will have much of an impact on the pricing environment. It's still a very 
competitive environment. We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think 
that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment.”

Expert Weighs In On Pricing Discussion And 
The “Darker Side” Of Industry Practices 


“Cintas has maintained that the pricing environment hasn't changed much or been stable throughout this whole industry 
consolidation period? Unifirst’s CEO, was commenting a year ago that basically, and I’m paraphrasing, service disruptions in the 
industry has created a change and allowed them to be more competitive and poach clients. So, I mean, do you take Cintas 
verbiage at face value that the pricing environment has been stable while they're trying to digest a huge acquisition of G&K?”


Spruce Point


“And not only that, but I'll say this, the pricing environment in the rental uniform industry is, is within 10% of where it was back in the 
late eighties. And I'm really not exaggerating now. Whilst loss prices have gone up substantially because merchandise cost has gone 
up. But as far as the unit costs for a specific type of a towel or a specific type of a format for a specific type of a uniform, it's still pretty 
much the same. When I began in the industry, we would see large national uniform paying about 90 cents a day or up for us, 65/35 
shirt and a pants. Today that cost is more like 60 cents per man per day. It is actually gone down on some items. Some items have gone 
up a little bit, so it's probably about a 10% wash. But, but in regard to uniforms, it literally has gone down to the point,  from 
competitive pressure, but guess what, the uniform companies, they’re willing to do that because there's so many other ways that 
they can make a profit. So what I, what I call it is creative marketing. They've, they literally will, we'll dangle a carrot to get their foot 
in the door. And I've had, I've had GMs all through my career no matter the uniform company that I worked for, so you go get me the 
business. It's my job to make it profitable and the way they do that is by collecting those fees and those fees that we're talking about is 
for the loss and the ruining, that 30% that I was mentioning to you earlier about, that's a cost that they just can't measure very well. 
You can measure what I'm going to charge you for a shirt or for pants, but you can't measure the amount of times I'm going to charge 
you for that shirt or that pant. The sheer incident rate is the hard part in that industry. So when I would call them clients, I would tell 
them point blank. I'd say, are you aware that your uniform cost is not going to be this dollar but it's going to be a dollar about 25 to 30% 
higher at this dollar? And very often I would find clients not expecting that at all.”


Industry 
Expert


When we asked the same industry expert, who admittedly worked at a competitor, and was not interested in working for 
Cintas, to opine on industry pricing, he revealed that prices have generally gone down, but industry players have used 


more aggressive tactics such as pushing nebulous fees for loss and ruin higher.


Industry 
Expert


“Naturally occurring loss and ruin is around 16 to 18%... But as time evolved, and as we started hitting those numbers more 
and more, guess what they climbed to 28% and 30%. 30% is about the norm now. And I heard that number for years. So, I 
believe it's not just a single company number. I think it's pretty much an industry-wide. That's kind of the goal that most 
uniform companies shoot toward. Again, I have no problem collecting from customers what is naturally destroy. I have a problem 
going out and getting aggressive looking for it. To me, that's the era that the industry evolved into, and they did it simply by
keeping their prices so low, they had to go out and find a way to make money.”

Under Pressue, Cintas Makes Shady 
Investment Sale


As we believe Cintas’ cash flow quality has worsened post the acquisition of G&K, we observe that management 
reported the sale of a cost method investment in Q2’19, and provided no information about what was sold, and who 
was the buyer. However, based on the disclosure that Cintas received $73.3m and booked a $69.4m pre-tax gain, we 


estimate its book value was $3.9m. Yet, Cintas reduced the book value of cost investments by only $2.0m. 
Something doesn’t seem correct here: Cintas produced a 35x cash return on investment and won’t explain how.


“Investments at August 31, 2018 of $180.3 million include the cash surrender value of insurance policies of $160.2 million, equity 
method investments of $14.9 million and cost method investments of $5.2 million. Investments at May 31, 2018 of $175.6 million 
include the cash surrender value of insurance policies of $154.0 million, equity method investments of $16.4 million and cost method 
investments of $5.2 million. Investments are generally evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment 
exist. For the three months ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, no impairment losses were recorded. Subsequent to August 31, 2018, 
Cintas reached an agreement to sell a cost method investment to a third party. The anticipated gain on the sale will be recorded
upon consummation of the sale.”

Cintas Increased Exposure To Oil And Gas 
And Mining Post G&K Acquisition


Cintas took on more exposure to the oil, gas and mining sectors with the acquisition of G&K Services. This may turn 
out to hurt it as pressures continue to rise with layoffs in the oil field as prices remain subdued and production falls. 


Various news outlets are suggesting that the oil and gas market will shed all its job gains this year and next.(1,2)


“Oil and gas was an important segment for all of us, not just hard-core center of oil and gas but the 
collateral, the related businesses to it, and everybody knows that story.”


“We continue to see significant wearer losses with oil and gas and other mining customers, and there 
is clearly some spillover into related markets.”

“What I was referring to was our customers in the oil, gas, mining areas that generally, when you see 
the prices of the gas at the pump come down in the past, when we've seen those prices really come 
down, it kind of hurts that business here in the U.S. And so the -- we saw some benefit in that price at 
the pump, as we said, 25 basis points in rental. But we also saw a little bit of softening in the business 
side of it from a customer perspective. And so that's what we're keeping our eyes on.”


“One area of caution with respect to growth relates to ware accounts within our existing customers. 
Additions versus reductions as we commonly refer to it, which slid some in our fourth quarter, partially 
due to some weakening in the oil and gas sector.”

Leverage Rising And Slightly More 
Levered Than It Appears 


As Cintas financial strain rises, it’s leverage is now at a multi-year high with increasing need for short-term borrowing. We believe 
its leverage is even higher than optically being portrayed. Cintas’ $102m of cash on the balance sheet should not be considered 


freely available to pay down debt. $57m of it is restricted and domiciled in foreign jurisdictions. 


“Cash and cash equivalents.  Cintas considers all highly liquid domestic investments with a maturity of three months or less, at date of 
purchase, to be cash equivalents. At May 31, 2019 and 2018, cash and cash equivalents includes $31.4 million and $30.9 million, 
respectively, of restricted cash used as collateral associated with the general insurance program. Cash and cash equivalents as of May 31,

Dependence On Short-Term 
Financing Rising


Cintas credit facility size has tripled from $300m (pre G&K) to now $1.0 billion, despite the size of sales only growing 
~40% and accounts receivable by 67%. Historically, Cintas did not use its commercial paper program for funding. 


However, recently its usage has been steadily growing.


The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended on September 16, 2016. The amendment increased the 
capacity of the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $600.0 million and added a $250.0 million term loan facility. The $150.0 million 
increase in the revolving credit facility took effect upon the consummation of the merger (Merger) contemplated by the Merger Agreement 
among the Cintas, G&K and Bravo Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas. The term loan was funded upon the 
consummation of the Merger. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the 
borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to 
customary conditions. The maturity date of the agreement is September 15, 2021. As of May 31, 2017, there was $50.5 million of commercial 
paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.24% and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving 
credit facility. No commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at May 31, 2016


FY
2017


“Cintas' commercial paper program has a capacity of $300.0 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a 
credit agreement with its banking group. This revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity 
of $450.0 million. The revolving credit facility was amended on May 29, 2014 to extend that maturity date from October 6, 2016 to May 28, 
2019, to adjust the applicable margin used to calculate the interest payable on any outstanding loans, and to adjust the facility fee payable 
under the agreement. In June 2016, the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date from May 28, 2019 to June 22, 2021, 
increase the capacity to $450.0 million, and add an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. We 
believe that this program, along with cash generated from operations, will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash 
requirements. No commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at May 31, 2016 or 2015.”

Evidence Suggests Cintas Engineers 
Its Guidance To Make It Appear As If It’s 
Outperforming Expectations


A classic example of earnings management is when management over-estimates expenses, and claims great 
performance when results are better than expected. A brazen example is when Cintas offered guidance for intangible 
amortization expenses related to G&K. Cintas twice cut the estimate of intangible asset amortization. In its first pro-


forma G&K disclosure, it estimated $68.5m and said the contracts had a 10 year estimated life.

45


Evidence Suggests Cintas Misguided 
Expenses To Inflate EPS


Four months later on the conference call, Cintas offered guidance of $50m of intangible amortization expenses, down from the $68m 
estimate originally provided. Yet, by closely evaluating the 10-K that was filed shortly after the conference call, it’s clear that 


management should have given $40m of guidance. Actual amortization was reported at $38.9m. Thus, we can say with confidence 
that management issued an inaccurate measure of amortization expense, potentially to misguide investors to optically deliver better 


results. The net benefit to FY 2018 EPS from this expense mismanagement was $0.24, or approximately 3.5%.


“Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business: no transaction and 
integration expenses; revenue of $870 million to $900 million, compared to a prior year run rate of $965 million; 
synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; purchase price amortization expense related to 
intangible assets of $50 million; interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million; and an EPS 
contribution of $0.15 to $0.17.”

Evidence Suggests That Cintas Spring-Loaded 
G&K’s Financial Results


Commentary from G&K and its financial projections illustrated how it expected to achieve approximately 3.5% - 5.3% annual 
revenue growth from 2016 – 2018. Yet, when Cintas issued guidance for FY 2018 including G&K, it implied a -4.2% annual revenue 


decline at the guidance midpoint! Pay close attention, and notice that CTAS’ revenue guidance was ~$165 - $195m below 
G&K projections.

Red Flag: Cintas Says One Thing And Does Another 
Thing On Capital Priorities To Inflate Results


Cintas repeatedly claimed in 2019 that capex, acquisitions, dividends and lastly share repurchase were its capital 
priorities. Yet, with capex stated as the #1 priority, it cut its capex guidance three times, and share repurchases 
soared to $1bn – making repurchases clearly the largest capital priority despite management saying otherwise. 


“One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition 
debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which our 
CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.”

“Yeah. I would say the capital allocation is similar to a pre-G&K acquisition philosophy and that is we want to grow 
organically and we are going to invest in the business in the way that that we need to in order to continue to grow. That 
means CapEx will be important for us both in adding plant capacity, adding route capacity and other system 
investments...We love tuck-in acquisitions and acquisitions that are in our current businesses. And so, we will continue to 
look for those kinds of opportunities…We have raised our dividend for every year since we went public. I would expect 
that we will evaluate then that and that's very important to us. And then, if we have additional cash and we have an

For Q4’19 Cintas explicitly guided to no repurchases, yet conducted its biggest buyback in Q4’19. Cintas originally 
guided to $7.00 - $7.15 of EPS from continuing operations (ex: items) in FY 2019, and kept raising guidance all year 
to end at $7.60. However, we believe financial and accounting gamesmanship accounted for more than the earnings

When Asked About Share Buybacks, 
Management Gave A Ridiculous Response


Management won’t admit it uses stock buybacks to manage market expectations and to engineer low quality “beat 
and raises” stories to get analysts giddy. Instead management spins a non-sensical explanation of its share 


repurchase strategy calling it “consistently inconsistent”. This should hardly inspire any confidence from investors. 


“We've always looked at that buyback as we've executed as an opportunistic program. And if you go 
back over the course of the last 10 years, we are not consistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's 


by design. We kind of look at a bunch of different things. We look at the performance of the business, 
the investment needs of the business. We look at M&A opportunities on the horizon. We look at things 
like upcoming dividends and we have a consistent history of not being consistent in the way that we 


execute on that buyback program. And I'm not sure I look into anything more than that.”


Cintas CFO
Response To 


Question About Its 
Buyback Strategy


Q1 2020 
Earnings Call


“Usually when companies don't buyback stock and their leverage is below the level that the --
consider a target level there is usually something that is a potential out there, is that an unfair 
assumption for us to make that there might be something in the near to intermediate term?”

In Our View, 2019 Had No Outperformance 
Relative To Initial Guidance


We estimate that, at best, EPS would have been flat or modestly down without Cintas’ crafty financial and accounting 
gamesmanship that involved lowering its tax rate, redirecting capital towards share repurchases despite repeatedly 


saying it was the lowest capital priority, and lowering amortization expense for G&K service contracts.

Governance And Auditor Concerns
53


Numerous Governance Shortfalls For An 
“S&P 500 Caliber” Company


Institutional investors should demand greater governance standards from Cintas Corp.


Chairman And CEO Roles Not Separated
 Best practices dictate the separation of Chairman and CEO roles, but Cintas has repeatedly rebuffed this claiming that 


Farmer provides invaluable leadership and direction for the success of the Company


 Yet, Spruce Point sees no evidence management has been held accountable for Cintas’ weakening financial profile with 
the acquisition of G&K. Instead, the Board granted a special bonus to executives claiming it was a successful deal, and 
management has been receiving double digit salary increases. Furthermore, the compensation committee appears 
willing to grant management bonuses purely for income generated by implementing accounting policy changes


Questionable Business Links And Relationships Between Directors Compromise Objectivity 
 The CEO is the brother-in-law of Director Coletti and directs business to Coletti’s law firm


 Newly appointed audit Director Carnhan is a long-time former employee of Cintas, and sits on the Board of another audit 
Director’s company, and is likely paid 


Pledging of Stock Allowed By Executives 
 Both CEO Farmer, and Director Coletti’s spouse (a relative of Farmer), have been allowed to pledge stock, which is 


typically frowned upon among better governed companies 


Connections Between Management And 50 Year Auditor Relationship
 E&Y has been Cintas’ auditor for 50 years. Investors should demand the appointment of a new auditor to take a fresh 


inspection of its books and records. Cintas audit engagement partner also audited Papa John’s. Subsequent to his 
departure, Papa John’s new auditor disclosed a “material weakness of financial controls” warning


 Both Cintas’ CFO and Treasurer worked at E&Y, which could compromise the objectivity and independence required 
between client and auditor
54


It’s Time For An Auditor Change And Fresh 
Independent Evaluation of Cintas’ Books


Spruce Point is concerned with the closeness of Cintas with its auditor E&Y. The relationship dates back over 50 years, and 
both the current CFO and Treasurer worked there. It’s time for a new auditor and a fresh look at Cintas’ books.

Dubious EPS To Reap Unjust Bonuses


Cintas’ annual incentive plan is based on sales and EPS growth, along with non-financial goals. In 2019, 41.75% of 
CEO Farmer’s bonus was tied to EPS performance while for most other executives, it accounted for 50% of the bonus. 


Cintas conveniently achieved almost the maximum EPS target within one penny, and claims its $7.60 EPS took into 
consideration various one-time items. We will demonstrate why we believe this to be inaccurate. 


The Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2019 table outlines estimated possible payouts under this non-equity incentive 
plan award. Based on Cintas' EPS and sales growth for fiscal 2019, Mr. Farmer and Mr. Schneider earned an annual cash 


incentive payout of $1,726,322 and $934,552, respectively. The fiscal 2019 Cintas EPS used in the incentive plan calculations 
was $7.60. This EPS figure differs from the Company's reported diluted EPS from continuing operations because it takes 


into consideration various one-time, extraordinary financial impacts that occurred during the fiscal year, which consisted 
of acquisition-related integration expenses and a gain on the sale of an equity method investment.

Dubious EPS To Reap Unjust Bonuses

In FY 2019, Cintas adopted a new revenue recognition method that boosted pre-tax income by $22.3m and Diluted EPS

Warning: When Given Bonuses For Deals


In light of all our concerns about Cintas overpaying for G&K, increasing the financial stress to the overall pro-forma 
company, and management using aggressive measure to manage Wall Street expectations in a way to make itself look 


like business is improving, we find it absurd that Cintas claimed the deal was a “success”. 
Cintas paid special cash bonuses to management for what Spruce Point believes is a terrible deal. 


At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, bonuses can be paid outside the Management Incentive 
Plan, typically to reward exceptional outcomes and successes in extraordinary business situations. In fiscal 
2018, as a result of their significant involvement and success with the fiscal 2017 acquisition of G&K, Mr. 


Hansen and Mr. Frooman each received a discretionary cash bonus of $132,500. The Compensation 
Committee arrived at $132,500 by considering the extra effort, time commitment and individual expertise 


that was required of Mr. Hansen and Mr. Frooman to successfully close the transaction, which led to 
additional revenues and profits for the Company.

Convenient Time For The COO And 
Chairman Emeritus To Retire


Cintas patriarch Richard Farmer retired from the Board in August 2018, while COO and 22 year veteran J. Phillip 
Holloman also left Cintas. In light of our belief that the core business is struggling, it would appear to be a natural time 


for each person to coast into retirement.

Audit Committee Expanded With Questionably 
“Independent” Former Treasurer


In light of our belief Cintas is experiencing operational and financial stress, we find it interesting that former Treasurer 
Karen Carnahan just joined the Board, and notably the Audit Committee. She is claimed to be an “independent 


director”, and while technically having been removed from Cintas for three years this may be true, we are concerned 
that she has been affiliated with Cintas for 30 years. Furthermore, Ms. Carnahan was just appointed on May 15, 2019 as 
a Trustee of Touchstone Investments (a member of Western & Southern Financial). Cintas other audit director John F. 


Barrett is the CEO of Western & Southern. Touchstone Trustees typically earn $128k - $152k per year.(1)
Could this impair her judgement to act independently?

There appears to be a consensus among independent analysts that are not compensated by Cintas, that its

Ares Capital Management acquired Convergint Technologies in Feb 2018, a company that designs, installs, and

course of our research, Convergint was consistently mentioned as a credible competitor to Cintas. Terms of the 
transaction were undisclosed, but based on a credit report, we see that Convergint was acquired for $1.62bn and was 
expected to grow organically by double digits to $950m in revenue with ‘low double digit EBITDA margins”, implying 


the business was valued at approximately 1.7x projected revenues and 15x EBITDA.

Analysts Don’t Model The Fire Safety 
Business Appropriately


Sell-side analysts fail to carefully evaluate the nuances between Cintas’ various businesses. Notably, as we’ve 
demonstrated, the Fire Safety and Inspection business has a very different growth and risk profile. Given that this 
business has demonstrated to be conducting fraudulent inspections, and new competitors are circling to displace 


Cintas, we believe it should be valued lower than other businesses.
