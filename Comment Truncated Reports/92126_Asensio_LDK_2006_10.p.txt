Does LDK Have Yet Another


Disclosure Issue? 


Chinese Solar Company


Reportedly Suffers Damages


in Winter Storm and Keeps


Investors in the Dark.


Uncertainty continues to plague LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE:


LDK). As asensio.com reported last week, LDK announced in


December that an independent audit committee formed to


investigate allegations of inventory discrepancies by a


former employee uncovered “no material errors in the


Company’s stated silicon inventory quantities.” LDK’s latest


�nancial �ling appears to blatantly betray the alleged results


of this audit committee.


In addition to these disclosure issues, LDK now appears to


have su�ered serious damages to equipment and property,


resulting from a winter storm in late February. According to


a translation of an article published in the Jiangxi Daily on


February 25, the “snow disasters” damaged a material sum


of “silicon material.” In addition, LDK su�ered “some


machinery and equipment damage.” So far the company has


made no announcement in connection with these damages.

No matter how many polysilicon wafers this solar company


produces, it appears its investors will be asked to sit in the
