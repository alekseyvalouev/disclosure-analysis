Sphere 3D: Cloud Company Can't Rise Above Hype, Mistakes And
Poor Management

Summary


Hype at its best. Sphere 3D's bought-and-paid-for promotions artificially kick the
stock price over the moon.


Currently no real commercial product, though Sphere 3D has been at it about five
years now.


No organic sales. The company pays dearly to claim an acquisition’s puny sales as
its own.


Looming options and warrants poised to hit the market.


Large salaries for inexperienced execs, little money, big cash burn with a need to
burn multi-millions more. We believe it’s all too clear - dilution is imminent.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


From its rocky beginnings as a fake mining company to its absurd overpayment for a little
two-man shop, Sphere 3D Corp. (SPIHF) (ANY.V) has signaled the true meaning of the
"D" in its name: "Deep six" this stock before it's too late.


The Canadian technology company has gone screaming into the stratosphere. The stock
smashed new 52-week highs five times in three months and is trading on the TSXV
Canadian exchange as "ANY.V." Now at around $9, the stock is also listed on the
alternative trading system OTCQB as "SPIHF."


But research by TheStreetSweeper indicates all the screaming will soon be done by
ANY.V investors pushing and shoving and galloping for the exits.


What's behind all the recent excitement surrounding the stock of a company that reported
zero revenue last year? Blatant, baseless promotions by a company desperate to get
listed on the NASDAQ's subsidiary OMX. Additionally, retail investors anticipate that
ANY.V's earnings report later this month might finally show some commercial revenue for

its emulation and virtualization product. The patent-pending technology is designed to
make applications run on a cell phone, iPad or other device as easily as they run on a
person's computer at home or work.


But disaster lurks. And here's how TheStreetSweeper sees it breaking out:


· Hype at its best. Bought-and-paid-for promotions artificially kick the stock price over the
moon.


· Currently no real commercial product.


· No organic sales. ANY.V pays dearly to claim an acquisition's puny sales as its own.


· Looming options and warrants poised to hit the market.


· Large salaries for inexperienced execs, little money, big cash burn with a need to burn
multi-millions more. We believe it's all too clear - dilution is imminent.


TheStreetSweeper has requested an interview but ANY.V has not responded.


SUPREME HYPE


ANY.V proudly links to not one - not two - not six - but nine articles in How to Find Big
Stocks. These promos of ANY.V seem just a little like the kind of material sent out by
Jonathon Lebed, a stock promoter and newsletter writer noted for his youthful brush with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission and his disclosure urging people never to
trade on his advice unless they're prepared to lose the entire investment.


In fact, ANY.V is so desperate for attention, the company has taken on its own promoter.
That hired gun is USA Investor Link, pulling in $10,000 monthly plus about $2.8 million in
stock options.


CEO Peter Tassiopoulos issued a statement in March 2013 about hiring USA Investor Link
to address the "increased interest we are receiving from the investment and business
community."


Let's just take a look at USA Investor's previous clients… Whoa - maybe ANY.V should
have done some due diligence before peeling off investors' hard-earned dollars to pay the
two-man USA Investor Link.


Almost exactly a year before ANY.V's announcement about its USA Investor deal,
Canada-based NWM Mining Corp. (OTCPK:NWMMF) issued its own statement about
hiring USA Investor "due to a significant increase in the level of interest from the U.S.

Investment community …"


If anyone's interested now, a share of NWM Mining stock costs just a fraction of a penny.


NO REAL PRODUCT


The promoters' jobs are all the more difficult since ANY.V has not created a real
commercial product. That's why the company's financial statement - which isn't readily
accessible to US investors - lists a big, fat "0" under revenue.


Yes, ANY.V would whine that investors gotta believe. They've got to believe that the
company's patents - which are simply applications that have been filed - will amount to
something someday.


The product Glassware 2.0 is not ready for prime time yet. And, like the CEO says, it's
been years in the making.


"We've been at this since early 2009 and we're kind of tired of research and
development. We've been doing this for a while," said CEO Tassiopoulos.


ANY.V is pushing to get a listing on the NASDAQ even though this 5-year-old product still
apparently hasn't moved past the demonstration stage.


And even though ANY.V may want to believe its product is special, many, many
companies are already doing what ANY.V wants to do. There's Citrix, ePlus, Vology,
VMware, ITS and the list goes on and on. At least since 2007, there's even been free,
open-source software to virtualize Android and more.


Most of all, the biggest gorilla in the forest is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The $333 billion
company's highly acclaimed Windows Azure helps people work anywhere on any device.
Like ANY.V would like to do.


Indeed, ANY.V has been stumbling in an environment that is gradually becoming even
rockier for tech companies. Billionaire David Einhorn called out a warning in his quarterly
letter to investors in his Greenlight Capital fund.


"Now there is clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15
years," Mr. Einhorn wrote. "What is uncertain is how much further the bubble can
expand, and what might pop it."


ROLL 'EM UP

What ANY.V is really up to, as we see it, is that the company realizes that it's getting
nowhere with its own product. So it is entering that magical land called roll-up-ville.


That's right. It's a rollup company. Much like these ridiculous rollups that
TheStreetSweeper has warned investors about: Tangoe (TNGO) ($19.55 day of article,
now $14) Swisher Hygiene (NASDAQ:SWSH) ($8 day of article, now 40 cents) and
Revolution Lighting (NASDAQ:RVLT) ($4 day of article, now $2).


Those companies are way out of ANY.V's league as far as assets, revenue and
management. But, in our opinion, the coming ANY.V disaster is likely to be just as
spectacular - or even more so.


BIG MONEY FOR TINY ACQUISITION


ANY.V announced expected first quarter revenue to exceed $1 million. But what the
company didn't announce was that it paid dearly for that smidgen of revenue.


The bulk of that money for rollup ANY.V is likely to be thanks to the acquisition in March of
V3 Systems. According to Dun & Bradstreet's WorldBase, the little Utah-based V3
Systems was a one-to-two-man operation that last year managed to make only $535,256
in sales.


Yet ANY.V trotted in like a gang of happy pups and agreed to pay $9.7 million for V3.


That's 1.1 million shares of ANY.V stock plus $4 million cash - an acquisition ANY.V could
manage only by signing a $5 million debt deal with Cyrus Capital Partners - a company
that describes itself as a debt fund manager that invests in "financially distressed"
companies.


Incredibly, ANY.V paid more than 18 times V3's sales. Yes - 18 times more!


NAME OF THE GAME: ODD ACQUISITIONS


Acquisitions have played a big role for ANY.V since the beginning.


The boys behind T.B. Mining Venture, the shell company that reverse-merged into ANY.V,
were only slightly coy about what they'd be mining. Canadian regulatory records show T.B.
Mining did not operate in the usual business fashion. Instead, it popped out its 2010 IPO
of 1.5 million shares at 20 cents each to raise money for one purpose and one purpose
only - to search for "assets," "businesses," or "non-arms-length transactions."

ANY.V's current president Mario Biasini, with leadership experience limited to his small
graphics arts company Promotion Depot, oversaw the 2012 reverse merger and name
change to Sphere 3D. He invited a couple of buddies, Giovanni "John" Morelli, the
inventor of the "emulation and virtualization technology" and financial expert Mr.
Worthington along for the ride.


Though you won't see ANY.V trumpeting this fact, Promotion Depot had the original
development stage product that ANY.V has been trying to build into a real company.
Canadian filings show that in 2010, ANY.V acquired "all rights and assets related to the
emulation and virtualization technology from Promotion Depot Inc." and paid $695,000.


BIG BOYS, BIG MONEY, BAD BUSINESSES


If ANY.V's been good for anybody, it's been good for top executives. It showered the top
four guys last year with over $1 million in total compensation.


Canadian regulatory filings say Mr. Tassiopoulos received a big hunk of that executive
payday last year - $459,611.


Part of that compensation is cheap stock. Mr. Tassiopoulos has the option to buy 100,000
shares of ANY.V for just 85 cents each -about one-tenth of what the shares would bring in
today's market.


Mr. Tassiopoulos became a director in 2012 and CEO in 2013, riding up to ANY.V on his
business development connections -- and despite his leadership of several dismal
companies. Though his ANY.V profile certainly doesn't tout his role in Argentium
Resources (OTC:AGTMF), he served as a director of the silver and gold mining company.
Listed on the OTC exchange with ANY.V's alter-ego SPIHF, Argentium stock last traded
Dec. 24, 2013 for just a fraction of 1 penny.


Until he was fired, Mr. Tassiopoulos also held COO and then CEO titles in 2009-2011 with
Biosign Technologies (OTC:BITKF) (BIO.V). Also not mentioned in his company profile,
Biosign is a healthcare software company listed on the same exchange with ANY.V.
Biosign trades for about 3 cents.


Most recently, a material change filing - and a press release that buried the real news
beneath a chirpy announcement about a recently hired sales manager - noted that Mr.
Tassiopoulos' ascension in ANY.V included pushing Mr. Morelli out of the company two
months ago and grabbing the man's director title.

OVER 1 MILLION EXTRA OPTIONS PLANNED, MORE STOCK LOOMING


As if executives aren't already draining enough from this struggling company, they are
ready to get their hands on even more.


ANY.V shareholders will meet May 27 to vote on items such as amending the stock plan.
Here's how:


The three best-paid executives - Mr. Tassiopoulos, Mr. Biasini and CFO T. Scott
Worthington - would get access to more than 1 million additional options to purchase
ANY.V shares. According to filings, the number of options granted to those best-paid
execs would jump from 3.38 million to 4.65 million.


So $30 million to $40 million is not a bad potential payday for these guys. Especially from
a company that handed investors a loss of 14 cents per share.


And those new options aren't the only such worry for investors. Filings indicate (click on
the April 29, 2014 MD&A):


· Options could spring about another 1.2 million shares on the market. Some were as
cheap as 51 cents to 85 cents.


· Warrants set for June 27 release: 1.1 million shares.


· Warrants set for Dec. 27 release: 1.3 million shares.


· Total warrants set for 2014-2015 release: 6.3 million shares.


Not including the 1 million extra options that directors want, we estimate the force of the
current options and warrants bearing down on the market could reach about 7.5 million
shares.


At ANY.V's recent stock price of about $9, with 23 million shares outstanding, the current
market cap is about $207 million.


The market cap under the looming options and warrants scenario at the $9 price, would
reach a stunning $274.5 million.


That huge chunk of change is outlandish for a company with little more than hype to call
its own.
