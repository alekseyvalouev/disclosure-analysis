Summary


Harvey had brought CAT risk to the forefront of public concern - investors should
take note.


There are multiple ways to approach catastrophe as an investment theme
throughout the cycle.


Small primary insurers with direct CAT exposure have little upside with significant
downside in the current environment.


Hurricane Harvey brought catastrophic risk to the forefront of public attention as it
wreaked havoc across Texas and, to a lesser extent, Louisiana. CAT risks are likely to
remain a key concern as Hurricane Irma and the storm behind her move across the
Atlantic.


Catastrophe as an investment theme can be approached from various angles depending
on the point in the cycle. Presently, small insurers might represent interesting short
opportunities, either due to direct storm exposure from Harvey or Florida CAT exposure to
the remainder of the season. We view them as having highly skewed risk/reward profiles,
with little upside and considerable downside.


As a basic background primer on the space, we recommend our 36-page report The
Unsustainable State of the Florida Property Insurance Industry. In addition to the original
PDF, it is available on Seeking Alpha. It provides an overview of an asset class that has
grown in importance in recent years as the values of properties exposed to catastrophic
events have increased.


The significance of the increased CAT exposure of vast portions of the US economy has
been underestimated. While we're only discussing the "tip of the iceberg" primary CAT
insurers, there is a multiple of different companies and industry groups that stand to
benefit/lose extensively by the recent developments. The transmission mechanisms of
exposure are not truly understood by market participants.

We are currently focused on United Insurance Holdings (UIHC), The HCI Group (HCI),
and Universal Insurance (UVE) on the short side of the book. The table below shows all
the Florida insurers, market capitalizations, and valuation statistics.


Primary CAT Insurers


Source: Yahoo Finance


1) United Insurance Holdings Corp. has significant direct exposure in Texas,
Louisiana, as well as general Florida CAT risk. According to regulatory filings, Texas
and Louisiana contributed 18% and 6% of gross written premiums for a total of 24% in
1H17; up from 14% and 5% for a total of 19% in the same period last year. UIHC’s
statutory filings state the company’s premiums written for TX and LA were $87.5M in
1H17.


Two companies have made preliminary announcements of Harvey-related losses.
Federated National (FNHC), a stock we are long, announced losses net of reinsurance of
$4M, a small amount for the company. 1347 Property Insurance Corp. (PIH) has
announced gross loss estimates “well within” its $195M limit with a retention of $5M. While
the retention may seem a small amount, it represents over 5x the cumulative $736,000 in
profits the company generated over the last four years. We consider it a material loss
event for the small company.


We estimated a range of potential losses UIHC could face from Harvey. To do so, we
combined our estimate of a total of 97,544 policies in TX and LA with loss statistics
generated by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 to generate our loss matrix, which is shown
below.

In 2016, Hurricane Matthew threatened the eastern shore of Florida. Though never
making landfall, it generated significant damage in coastal communities. In impacted
counties, between 2% and 26% of policies made claims with an average of 11%. There
were a total of 119,345 claims for what the state of Florida estimates to be $1.182B in
losses. Using those figures, the average loss per policy was $9,904.


Our estimates assume between 5% and 15% of all UIHC policies in TX and LA make
claims at a rate between 50% and 125% of Matthew’s $9,904 average claim. With these
assumptions, UIHC could experience gross losses of $24.2M, which seems low to
us, to $217M and an average of $90M.


Although we view our loss matrix as reasonable scenarios, losses are difficult to predict,
even for the companies themselves. Actual losses could be less or significantly more
than our matrix suggests. The key question is how much of the gross losses the
company will retain. Company filings state the group retention is $55M. An event loss of
that size would be approximately 10% of shareholder equity. However, we do not know
exactly how this will relate to losses from Harvey, and the company has not yet released a
clarifying statement.


In our view, neither UIHC’s current valuation nor recent price action reflects the
potential for Harvey-related losses; it certainly does not reflect potential Irma-
related or other post-Harvey events. Irma could be a tipping point for the company
due to limited multiple event coverage.


2) Unlike UIHC, the HCI group is a long-standing structural short position for reasons
that include Florida CAT exposure as well as a host of company-specific issues we have
discussed in the past. (See our previous work on HCI for an in-depth look into the
company and their practices.)

Harvey has not had a direct impact on HCI. However, the extensive flooding
associated with the storm highlights the risks associated with HCI’s growth
strategy. HCI launched its flood insurance company TypTap in Florida; In June 2017, the
company expanded into nine other states.


There are good reasons why few private insurers underwrite the peril of flood. As Harvey
makes plain, when floods occur, they can be completely devastating. We think that
underwriting flood, like the company’s assumption of high-risk wind-only policies, will likely
generate long-term losses for shareholder, reflecting the risk and pricing problems
associated with the perils.


As this article from the Washington Post points out, Harvey is Houston’s third 500-year
flood in three years. In our opinion, HCI’s move into flood reflects the company’s
casino-like risk appetite, not underwriting or business acumen.


HCI uses a captive reinsurer for the expensive lower layer coverage. Thus, from HCI
shareholder’s perspective, the company has a $50M first event retention. According to
HCI’s latest investor presentation, 41% of the company’s policies are in the
hurricane-prone tri-county area.


3) We have not written extensively about Universal Insurance. However, we think UVE is
an excellent short candidate in the current environment. As a low-quality insurer with
extensive CAT exposure, the company has had its fair share of regulatory problems,
which are detailed in the State of Florida’s examinations of the company. UVE was also
the subject of short presentation by a hedge fund manager that was described as "the
best short pitch I have ever seen" by one attendee.


UVE has a high concentration in the catastrophe prone tri-county area. According to
FLOIR, Universal had 220,306 policies in force in the area at the end of 2016. The number
represents 38% of its total Florida policies of 577,263.


Conclusions


There have been numerous stories in the media regarding the exposure of insurance
companies such as Travelers (TRV) and Allstate (ALL). The large nationals may be
impacted by Harvey and other seasonal storms, but they are also diversified by peril and
geography. In contrast, the smaller insurers we discussed turn the traditional insurance
model of risk spreading on its head. The companies are highly concentrated both by
geography and peril, making them extremely vulnerable to CAT losses.

All companies have reinsurance to cover catastrophic losses, but the effectiveness of the
programs can vary greatly depending on how and when losses are experienced.
Evaluating the programs is extremely difficult because the State of Florida allows insurers
to label reinsurance programs ‘trade secrets’; it’s a gift to the companies protecting them
from public scrutiny. Simply assuming that having reinsurance coverage means that
seasonal CAT losses will remain minor ‘earnings events’ rather than impairment
events could be very costly for investors


It’s important to keep in mind that estimates of losses to assess reinsurance needs are
just that – estimates. As the situation in Houston shows, storms can be stronger and occur
more frequently than a normal statistical distribution suggests.


The current price/book multiples of our three main short candidates of UIHC, HCI, and
UVE are 1.4x, 1.5x and 1.9x, respectively. In our view, the valuations do not adequately
reflect the risk associated with either passing storms, in the case of UIHC, or future CAT
risk and company risk, in the cases of HCI and UVE.


Texas has rightly been in the spotlight due to the Harvey. However, parts of Florida have
already experienced extensive rain storms, which will likely cause some losses for the
insurers. Over the next week, both Irma with her 170 Mph winds and the currently
unnamed storm forming behind Irma will make their ways across the Atlantic, perhaps
threatening land. It is difficult to envision any upside for our short candidates at the time,
but it is easy to see that there is tremendous downside.


In addition to the small primary insurers that are largely a Florida/Texas phenomenon,
there are some large cap companies with significant exposures to the CAT risks in a
manner that is not clearly visible to the market participants. We expect a few “surprises” in
the coming months.


There are also a number of regional businesses that are very exposed to the damage and
devastation of hurricane storms. Lastly, there will also be big winners across industries
and the market capitalization curve as events unfold.
