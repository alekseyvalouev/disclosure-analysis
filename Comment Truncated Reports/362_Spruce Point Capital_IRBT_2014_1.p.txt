In Spruce Point’s Opinion, Numerous Reasons 


To Be Cautious of Investing in iRobot (IRBT)


Covering-Up Weakening Fundamentals and Growth Prospects: Competition Is Mounting in 
Home Vacuums, Pressuring Existing Market Share. Marketing Costs Are Now Surging Ahead of 
R&D To Stem The Bleed.  Meanwhile, Its Telepresence “Growth Story” For the Health And 
Enterprise Markets Appear To Be Nothing More Than Red Herrings And Unlikely To Pan Out

Signs of Aggressive Accounting: IRBT Has Used Accounting Gimmicks w/Varying Degrees of 
Disclosure to Enhance EPS. In Some Cases (Reclassifying Inventory to Fixed Assets, To Potentially 
Avoid Write-Downs), These Gimmicks Would Affect Historical Earnings. Littered With Errors, 
Reclassifications, and One-Time Warranty Gains, IRBT’s Financials Should Be Viewed Skeptically 


4


Price Target: $20 - $25 per share >>> 25% – 40% Downside


IRBT + Analysts Incorrectly Position The Stock: IRBT Is Playing Games To Position Itself Next To 
High Tech Companies 3x Bigger w/Diversified Business Models. While Analysts See +35% 
Upside, Spruce Point Believes IRBT Is No Longer A Robotic Innovator, But A Troubled Consumer 
Product Company Asking Investors To Pin Its Future On Speculative Growth Opportunities


iRobot Is The Poster Boy For A Robotics Bubble: Media Hype of a Robotics Revolution 
(Similar To 3D Printing Craze) Is Overblown. IRBT Is Hyping Its IP Portfolio, But Lacks A 
Monetization Strategy. The Hype Is To Divert Attention From Its Core Problems

Insider Selling Intensifying; Egregious Rigging of Incentive Compensation: Insider Ownership 
Down From 60% at IPO to Under 5% Today; Large Recent Selling In The Past Year. Meanwhile, 
Insiders Appear To Be Milking Shareholders For Bad Performance With Outrageous Cash Comp

Sign #4: There’s An ETF For That Too....

• A good way to identify a bubble is to follow the ETF market. When an ETF is created...buyer beware!


• In October 2013, an ETF that tracks the ROBO-STOX Global Robotics and Automation Index was launched.1


• It should be no surprise that the creator of this index also writes The Robot Report2


• There are countless examples of ETFs being launched to track small slices of the investment universe, which 
foreshadowed a sharp and sudden decline in the value of the underlying shares

Sign #5: The Media+Investors Blow Tiny 


News Out of Proportion, Stoke Speculation


Recent acquisition activity by large technology companies created massive media speculation.  
Bloggers suggest this speculation is a positive “trigger” for IRBT.  The speculation was based on: 


 Google buys 8 robotics companies in 6 months, including Boston Dynamics, which were highlighted by a recent 
New York Times article1


 Amazon buys Kiva, a maker of robots for warehouse fulfillment, in 2012 for $775m and more recently 
commented that it’s “experimenting” with drones, in a highly publicized and promoted 60 minutes TV segment2,3


We believe investors are misinterpreting these companies intent and budget  


 AMZN is acquiring logistics companies for distribution center management


 We estimate GOOG has spent between $50m and $120m on its 8 acquisitions:


1. The robotics acquisitions occurred in December 2013.  The change in cash used for all acquisitions between 
GOOG’s 2013 10k filing and GOOG’s Q3’13 10Q filing is $120m, which is the top end of our range and assumes 
all acquisitions were for robotics 


2. But since GOOG acquired more than just robotics companies, we can look over the last 6 months of 2013 to 
determine a more accurate scenario. GOOG’s total cash spent on acquisitions was $147m in 2H’13 


3. If we back out Flexycore at $23m, Flutter at $40m, and Bump at $35m, we estimate GOOG spent ~$50m in 
robotics acquisitions in 2013. Having spent $1.5 billion in total cash for acquisitions in 2013, GOOG’s robotics 
deals account for just 3-8% of its acquisition budget. In our opinion, this is hardly a major bet on the future of 
robotics by GOOG and suggests a large robotics acquisition the size of IRBT would be out of character

Sign #6: 


Where Is All The Hot Venture Capital Money?


Recent insights from venture capital trends doesn’t suggest a rapid explosion of interest in robotics


 Our analysis of publicly announced venture deals (debt+equity) illustrates that aggregate deal flow was stagnate at 
~$195m from 2012-2013. YTD through the end of April 2014, deal activity of $55m implies a deceleration of venture 
financings ($165m annualized, or -15% off trend)


 A majority of the capital has been deployed to fund follow-on Series B-D rounds. Funding for new robotics companies is 
approximately $50m per annum


 Largest investments include Anki (2013: $50m), Liquid Robotics (2013, $45m), Restoration Robotics (2011: $43m), 
MedRobotics (2013: $34m), Rethink Robotics (2012, $30m)


 Also, we note that two recent companies (CyPhy Works and Vgo) were started by former IRBT employees, apparently 
without the need to license any of IRBT’s intellectual property to get started!

Powerful Housing Trends Are a Negative 


for IRBT’s Home Vacuum Sales


With the majority of IRBT’s current and future success being tied to home robot sales, we believe it’s important to monitor the 
trends in the US domestic housing sector. New home construction should stimulate demand for home cleaning supplies such as 
robotic vacuums. In the US, there’s been a powerful trend towards more Multi-family vs. Single-family homes. On average, Multi-
family homes are 40-50% smaller on a square-foot basis. Furthermore, the trend in the past six years has been for smaller Multi-
family homes, with the average square-footage declining from 1,316 to 1,118 (15% decline). Overall, the trend of less housing square 
footage may reduce the implied demand for luxury home cleaning supplies such as robotic vacuums.

In October 2013, Electrolux published a global survey 


on vacuuming. The study has profound implications 


for IRBT:


1. Robotic Vacuums Are the Least Popular Model


After a decade in existence, a 1% response rate is more 


indicative of failure than future opportunity


2. Brand Has Little Importance To Consumers


IRBT’s increased ad spending may have little success


3. Brazilians Spend the Most Time Vacuuming


IRBT Has Had Limited Success in Latin America
Spruce Point Capital


Debunking IRBT’s “Market Share Strength”


“IRBT owns its core product market (robotic vacuum cleaners) and will penetrate a huge addressable market.”  


- Supporting Analyst


In order for IRBT to fund its growth projects, management must convince investors that its core vacuum product is still 
relevant.  In reality, we believe IRBT’s market share is coming under pressure and it seems like IRBT isn’t being transparent

Major Concerns w/IRBT’s Asia Growth Story


Based on our research, we believe IRBT will face market share headwinds, especially in Asia where it claims to have 
its largest growth opportunity


What does this tell us about IRBT and what questions does it raise?


 Should we be concerned that IRBT now cites its own “internal data” as a source on its latest market share slide


 International growth (especially China and Asia) are a key part of IRBT’s growth story. How can we have 
confidence in this story when IRBT is up against local competition?


 Should we be concerned that IRBT’s Asia market share claim of 67% (up from 64% just 7 weeks ago) might be 
diverging meaningfully from reality after IRBT finally acknowledges Ecovacs is a major Chinese competitor?


 Should we be concerned that IRBT’s main distributors in Hong Kong (Homertek), Taiwan, and Japan (Sales on 
Demand Corp), have not posted any iRobot news/product updates in 11, 7 , 15 months respectively1,2,3

Don’t Bet On Asia/China To Save IRBT


Electrolux (Sweden) – Declining Operating Profit in Asia Whirlpool – Struggling to Grow in Asia


“Whirlpool Asia reported first-quarter net 
sales of $166 million compared to $187 
million in the same prior-year period. 
Excluding the impact of currency, sales 
decreased approximately 4 percent.”


Source: http://investors.whirlpoolcorp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=842590Source: http://group.electrolux.com/en/financial-data-355/


China released April 2013 property market data and the latest results showed concern. Looking at the data, measured on a 
YTD basis, we find: (1) New residential housing starts (in terms of floor-space) fell -24.5% YoY (this follows -27.2% YoY in 
March), suggesting weakness has only recently begun to take hold; (2) property sales fell -8.6% YoY (vs. -5.7% YoY in 
March), resulting in record inventories and declines in averge prices; (3) land-area sold fell -15.8% YoY (vs. -10.2% YoY in 
March). Separately, the government released statistics on April’s social lending, from which we observe credit grew slower 
than last year (aggregate lending was down -25%/-12% MoM/YoY in April) in another sign the Chinese government is intent 
on refraining from large stimulus packages constraining growth in the shadow banking sector

Explosion or Commoditization Stage?


IRBT would like you to believe they are in an “explosion” stage. However, with robotic vacuum

More Competition Coming 


in a (Explosive) Rapidly Saturating Market


26


Within the US, robotic vacuum cleaners have been around for more than a decade, but the distribution 
channel and category appears to be getting even more crowded with lower cost alternatives


• We believe large retail partners are more likely to have a greater product offering on their shelves in the robotic 
vacuum category; this is a big negative for IRBT

New Consumer Robot Products Are Just Hype


28


IRBT frequently talks about more consumer electronics products like robotic lawn mowers and new robots that 
to clean clothes, to puff its product pipeline to investors


But major OEMs like John Deere and Husqvarna already sell robotic mowers.  And it appears no cares about laundry robots.


In our opinion, these product hypes are used by management and Street analysts as a               to keep investors interested  


We note that the robotic lawn mower market appears small, over 5 years old, and already has a variety of competitors

Cheaper competitive products placed in healthcare, education and enterprise channels already exist


 They may not be as advanced (i.e. need for remote control), but are cheaper  


 VGo offers a solution for 1/10th of the cost of IRBT’s solution.  Cost of IRBT’s AVA is $69,500 vs. VGo at $6,995 
(which includes $5,995 ASP + $100 annual subscription fee + $900 embedded 4G LTE connection)1


 VGO was founded by a former IRBT officer, has been in existence for 7 years, and has sold more than 1,500 
robots into the healthcare, education and enterprise channels.  We believe customers find the VGo robot a 
better value proposition with more personal functionality vs. IRBT


 A recent lawsuit between VGo and InTouch found that InTouch’s patent to be invalid.  This is important 
because InTouch distributes IRBT technology… the very technology that IRBT claims to be patent proof2


 Double Robotics also offers a solution for $2,4993

The Enterprise Video and Telepresence 
Market is Contracting1


 According to IDC, the very source IRBT 
references, the worldwide enterprise 
videoconferencing and telepresence market 
shrank by 18.9% in from 2012 to 2013


 Cisco's 4Q13 results showed a 2.1% quarter-
over-quarter revenue increase, but a -20.8% 
year-over-year decline in video 
equipment revenue


 IDC believes that among the challenges 
customers are currently trying to work through 
are a market transition and determining 
exactly when and how to provision their video 
deployments as more software-centric and 
cloud-based service offerings become part of 
the enterprise video market landscape

IRBT Cites a 2011 inMedica/IHS Report; 
Recent Updates Point To A More Sober View


 According to a 2013 IHS press release, “US 
telehealth revenues, will jump from $174.5 million 
last year to $707.9 million in 2017,” and “the 
United States leads telehealth growth worldwide, 
and has 75% of the world’s telehealth patients”2


 Recall: IRBT’s recent presentation claims 
$1 billion of revenue by 2016. Thus, it appears the 
forecasts produced in the 2011 report have proven 
overly optimistic


 Moreover, the abstract to IHS’s 2014 Telehealth 
Report starts with a sober intro, “The World Market 
for Telehealth has yet to reach its tipping point. 
Poor implementation, low reimbursement levels, 
and lack of physician support are some of the 
barriers that have held telehealth penetration at a 
slow rate.” 3

Sleightness of Hand....?


32


 IRBT has been telling investors about their telepresence opportunity for over 2 years.  Thus far, they’ve produced 
limited unit sales and in March 2014 subtly changed its investor presentation. This month, IRBT omitted it!


 Telepresence needs an infrastructure that is decades from being built. For telepresence to work, a location needs 
to be on an integrated network (which conveniently allows IRBT to participate in the Internet of Things hype)  


 The gimmick is that like the vacuum cleaner, Ava can use a combination of 3D cameras, laser, and sonar to create 
a virtual map of its environment after which, it can then make its own way around (vs. requiring direct remote 
control).  How does it open doors or use stairs?


 We encourage analysts and investors to monitor app downloads for Ava 500 as a proxy for customer interest 
levels. There are sources such as appannie.com that can be used for this purpose. To date, we find a very limited 
download history of only a few thousand, mainly from European sources. Our result is at odds with what IRBT has 
told investors that Ava 500 had been launched in the “US, Canada and limited European markets”1

IRBT’s Intellectual Property (IP) Number 


Fudging and Hidden Value?


33


 Recently, IRBT began touting its “formidable” patent portfolio, and referencing the accolades it received from The Patent 
BoardTM for its Top 5 ranking within the electronics and instruments sector. To date, there has not been a comprehensive 
patent portfolio analysis done by the sell side, and IRBT has never publically quantified the value of its portfolio 


 While we agree that The Patent BoardTM is a high quality, independent provider of patent scoring information, we believe 
investors would be served to purchase the report for further granularity behind the ranking


 We also caution investors that IRBT does not appear to have good internal controls on its patent portfolio:
To illustrate, the company recently backdated its 2013 patent total by +64 (461 to 525) and increased its YTD 2014 total by 
91 (467 to 558) in just seven weeks. The majority of the discrepancy is accounted for in the international patent portfolio


March 2014 May 2014 Analyst Day


Creating patents out of thin air??
Spruce Point Capital


A Closer Look At The Patent Board’s Analysis


34


About the Patent Board:


The Patent Board provides analytics that can be useful in providing insights into assessing the patent quality and overall 
strength of patents and patent portfolios.  The Patent Board does not do patent valuations and makes no claim that the quality 
or strength of a patent portfolio is directly or indirectly related to a patent portfolio’s value.


The Analysis Says That:


 IRBT has a fairly small portfolio compared with many electronic and instrument companies. IRBT acquired patents from its 
acquisition of Nekton Research (2008) and Evolution Robotics (2012). They were also assigned 2 patents from Umagination 
Labs (2012) for gutter cleaning. IRBT’s portfolio is young and growing and has received numerous citations. IRBT’s peak 
patent filing and issuance years were 2007 and 2013, respectively 


 The strongest part of the portfolio is in Home Cleaning (which may be evidenced by the large number of internal citations), 
while IRBT is writing more patents in Defense (there are more external citations in Defense)


However We Should Note:


 A majority of the total citations are internal (meaning IRBT cites its own patents), and started increasing in 2012-2013 
along side an increase in the company’s patent issuance trend 


 The Patent Board’s analysis did not include foreign issued patents


Our Own View:


 A large patent portfolio is good, but a majority of IRBT’s patents are tied to home cleaning / consumer electronics, an 
industry that is always innovating. We believe companies with greater financial resources will be able to “out-innovate” 
IRBT in the long-run, which would make current patents obsolete


 A large number of citations is generally good, but a preponderance of internal citations undermines its importance.  It 
should be pointed out that a high degree of internal citations are indicative of having a stronghold on the area or areas to 
which the patents relate. Since international growth is key to the bull case, it is yet determined how successful IRBT will be 
defending itself in foreign geographies
Spruce Point Capital


A Few Other Thoughts on IRBT’s IP


35


There are other indirect signs that IRBT lacks influential and highly prized IP in its portfolio


 If its patents were so valuable, wouldn’t IRBT:


1. Need to defend itself with litigation frequently against its mounting competitors?  


 IRBT spent almost nothing on litigation expense: $155k and $1.2m in 2012 and 20131


 Why did the company wait until late 2013 to defend itself and tout the defense through first ever 
press releases against a Chinese company2


2. Look to monetize its IP?


 IRBT currently has zero licensing revenue, and doesn’t appear to have a strategy to extract any 
near term value


 Numerous former IRBT employees have left to join new robotics start-ups, yet it doesn’t appear 
that any have required licensing its patents 


 Is IRBT the next great hidden patent value stock like Eastman Kodak or the next Motorola Mobility?  Time will 
tell, but as we have suggested, having over 200 patents internationally has not prevented European market 
share losses. The same results may occur in both North America and Asia


 At its May 2014 Analyst Day, investors were looking for a pathway to monetize the portfolio. However, IRBT 
appeared to be unable to communicate a clear strategy, and cited high ‘costs’ as an excuse

However, the corresponding revenue range fell by just 3-5% over the same period. The Company also

First Q1 Cash Flow Burn in 8 Years!


IRBT has historically reported positive operating cash flow (OCF) in its first quarter results. However, in Q1 2014, IRBT 


reported its first ever Q1 OCF burn in over 8 years (and the only time its GAAP Net Income has been positive, while its 


OCF has been negative!) Not surprisingly, one of the biggest drivers for this change is accrued compensation payments, 


which increased by $7.0 million year-over-year. However, it is entirely possible the compensation rise is just a cover for 


bigger problems lurking in inventory and accounts receivables, which we’ll explore in the coming slides.

Fuzzy Inventory Accounting


In 2010, IRBT made a change to its inventory valuation section to make it appear as if there are no seasonal 


factors or short product life cycles that would lead to an inventory write-down for its consumer products. As 


we’ll show in the coming slides, IRBT has made a number of unusual transfers from its inventory accounts 


that peaked in 2010, are starting to occur again, and could be used to avoid taking inventory write-downs.


Prior to Feb 2010 Today


We value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of 
our inventory or its current estimated market value. We 
write down inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable 
inventories based upon assumptions about future demand 
and market conditions. Because of the seasonality of 
our consumer product sales and inventory levels, 
obsolescence of technology and product life cycles, 
we generally write down inventory to net realizable 
value based on forecasted product demand. Actual 
demand and market conditions may be lower than those 
that we project and this difference could have a material 
adverse effect on our gross margin if inventory write-
downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary. 
Alternatively, if actual demand and market conditions are 
more favorable than those we estimated at the time of 
such a write-down, our gross margin could be favorably 
impacted in future periods.

Fuzzy Accounting:


Reclassifying Inventory to PP&E


In our opinion, IRBT has made unusual supplemental disclosures in its Cash Flow Statement. IRBT has reclassified 


“inventory” to “property, plant and equipment.” In its recent 2011-2013 10K filings, we also observe that IRBT appears to be 


covering-up these past transfers by marking prior year movements through 2011 at zero! A possible motivation for these 


inventory transfers would be to overstate gross margins by moving high cost inventory to PP&E, or eliminate the need to 


write-down obsolete/slow-moving inventory in the current period, and instead depreciate the expense over a 3-5 year period. 


The net effect from either of these moves would be to overstate current period earnings.

Suspicious Inventory Reclassifications 


Highly Material to Past Earnings Statements


IRBT has made a total of $11.7m of inventory transfers since coming public with no explanation in its filings for investors 


to understand why. In our opinion, IRBT may be in a rush to cover-up prior transfers. In the chart below, we’ve plotted 


the period transfer amounts vs. current period Net Income. For example, in 2008 when IRBT reported Net Income of 


$0.76m, it transferred $0.90m of inventory to PP&E (118% of Net Income). If this were actually impaired inventory and 


written-down in the current period, IRBT’s Net Income would have been wiped out!

Fuzzy Accounting: Frequent Reclassifications 


Boosting Gross Profit Margins


Reclassification of Expenses Due to Reorganization


In FY 2012, the Company initiated a reorganization that resulted in, 
among other things, the centralization of all of the Company's 
engineering and operations activities. This reorganization was completed 
at the beginning of fiscal year 2013. In conjunction with this 
reorganization, the Company reviewed the financial statement 
classification of its costs and expenses. As a result of this review, the 
Company decided to classify certain expenses differently than had been 
classified and presented in prior periods to provide a more clear 
understanding of the Company's financial performance. As part of this 
review, the Company also evaluated the impact of the reorganization on 
its segment reporting and determined that certain modifications were 
necessary to present the segment information as now viewed by the 
Company's chief operating decision maker... This reclassification of costs 
and expenses did not impact previously reported net income or earnings 
per share as the changes only impacted the categorization of costs within 
the consolidated statements of income for the periods in question. 
Consequently, the classification changes did not impact previously 
presented consolidated balance sheets, statements of cash flow or 
statements of stockholders' equity.

If we are correct that IRBT is experiencing inventory problems and market share losses, the problems would 


most likely appear through gross margin contraction. Coincidentally, we observe that IRBT has made several 


expense reclassifications to boost its gross margin by shifting COGS to operating expense. IRBT has never 


explicitly listed all of the adjustments, but we believe reclassifications of stock-comp have occurred.  We will 


also demonstrate how aggressive warranty reversals have artificially boosted gross margins.


Note: In our opinion, the Second classification 
was not made readily transparent to investors.

Fuzzy Accounting: Warranty Reversals Also 


Aimed At Improving Gross Margins


IRBT had not been completely transparent about warranty reversals that tremendously benefited gross 


margins until an SEC comment letter in 2013 pointed a microscope on the matter.1 These one-time reversal 


gains benefit reported revenue and carry a 100% gross profit margin contribution. In the table below, we’ve 


adjusted IRBT’s financials for the distortive effect, and believe the company may face challenges in 2014 as 


YoY comparisons become more difficult to achieve from these non-recurring adjustments.

Classic Warning Signs IRBT’s Financial 


Statements Are Becoming Unraveled


IRBT’s financials are littered with warning signs: For example, we observe a large and unexplained quarterly surge in 


accounts receivables in the middle of 2013. Meanwhile, IRBT’s Days Sales in Inventory (DSI), or a measure of days to 


turnover its inventory, steadily rose in 2013 and has remained elevated. Lastly, we note IRBT replaced its long-time 


CFO early in March 2013. Later in November 2013, IRBT took the unusual step of placing its new CFO in charge of 


Supply Chain and Manufacturing.1

IRBT’s Days Sales Outstanding Exploding


For a closer look at IRBT’s receivables, we analyze its Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), a measure of the average 


number of days that it takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made.  A surge in DSO is often a red flag 


signaling a host of potential problems. IRBT’s DSO has been rising for 3 years and could be a result of any/all of the 


following: 1) Products have been oversold, and customers refuse to pay until the unfulfilled promises have been met; 


2) Extended payment terms may be offered that allow the buyer to delay full payment long after everything necessary 


has been done for the vendor to earn the revenue; 3) Channel stuffing; 4) Aggressive revenue recognition policies 


1) Calculated as Average LTM Accounts Receivables / [ (LTM Trailing Sales) / 360 ]

Insult to Injury: Errors, Errors, Errors


In our opinion, investors should be cautious of companies that have accounting reclassifications and 


frequent errors. In light of our previous concerns about potential problems with its financials, we observe that 


IRBT noted two discrete errors in 2013. While each individual error is listed as immaterial, we wonder if in 


aggregate, all of the issues we’ve presented are material to the integrity of the financial statements.


Source: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1159167/000115916713000022/irbt-2013928x10q.htm


During the third quarter of 2013, the Company identified an 
immaterial error to previously reported depreciation expense due 
to the use of an incorrect useful life on a leasehold improvement 
asset. The recorded out of period adjustment to cost of revenue 
and operating expenses resulted in a $0.6 million increase in third 
quarter 2013 net income. The adjustment did not have a material 
impact on the reported financial position or results of operations 
for the quarter ended September 28, 2013. Additionally, had this 
adjustment been recorded in the prior periods to which it relates 
(fiscal 2011, 2012 and the six month period ended June 29, 
2013), the impact would not have been material to the reported 
financial position or results of operations for those periods.


Revision of Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2012


During the three month period ended March 30, 2013, the 
Company identified a classification error related to its reserves for 
uncertain tax positions on its December 29, 2012 consolidated 
balance sheet. The Company had recorded a gross income tax 
receivable in current assets and a gross uncertain tax positions 
liability against that receivable in current liabilities as of December 
29, 2012. In addition, the Company misclassified certain liabilities 
for uncertain tax positions in current and long-term liabilities. The 
impact of the errors on the December 29, 2012 consolidated 
balance sheet was a decrease in Other Current Assets of $2.7 
million, an increase in Other Assets of $0.2 million, a decrease in 
Accrued Expenses of $2.9 million, and an increase in Long-term 
Liabilities of $0.4 million. These adjustments were not considered 
to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to previously issued 
financial statements. The Company has revised its December 29, 
2012 consolidated balance

Who Is Controlling IRBT’s Financials 


and Supply Chain?


IRBT’s Current CFO Worked at 3Com 


During a Tumultuous Period3
Shareholder Litigation Against 3Com and US Robotics 


(USR) Alleged Channel Stuffing + Other Issues


Ms. Alison Dean has been the Chief Financial Officer, 


Executive Vice President and Treasurer of iRobot 


Corporation since April 5, 2013 and serves as its 


Principal Accounting Officer. Ms. Dean served as the 


Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance at iRobot 


Corporation from February 2010 to April 5, 2013 and also 


served as Principal Accounting Officer from March 19, 


2007 to February 2012. Ms. Dean served as Vice 


President of Financial Controls & Analysis at iRobot 


Corporation from March 19, 2007 to February 2010. 


From 1995 to August 2005, she served at 3Com 


Corporation as Vice President and Corporate 


Controller from 2004 to 2005 and Vice President of 


Finance Worldwide Sales from 2003 to 2004.


Key Allegations Made in the Complaint


 Deferred the date of the 3Com / USR merger to hide disastrous 


results of USR


 USR customers had substantial inventories of older models that 


would become obsolete that they covered under a price protection 


to make its customers whole with a rebate when prices on the old 


products were discounted


 To inflate its revenue, USR induced customers to take quantities of 


new modems substantially in excess of their needs with unlimited 


return privileges (rebates), and failed to accrue any reserves, other 


expenses and take inventory write-downs


 Defendants issued false and misleading statements about the 
company’s financial health and levels of inventory in the 
distribution channels


 Defendants sold more than 4m shares of 3Com stock at prices as 
high as $58 3/8 per share, realizing gross proceeds from these 
sales of >$200m


With many questionable financial issues (warranty reversals, exploding DSO/DSI, reclassifications, errors, and more), we 


believe a closer look into IRBT’s CFO is justified. We find its CFO worked at 3Com in various financial capacities at a time 


when shareholder litigation claimed both 3Com and US Robotics (a company it merged with) perpetuated a scheme to 


mislead investors about its financial condition (charges included Channel Stuffing).1 The case was settled for $259 million 


in 2000 (a near record amount for that time period), and its executives avoided acknowledging any wrong doing.2

..To Convince Investors It Deserves A 


Dramatically Higher Stock Price


Analysts and investors have difficulty finding a correct peer set to value IRBT because they suggest that it has no 


pure play robotics competitors. During its recent May 2014 Analyst Day, IRBT tried to define a peer set. Not 


surprisingly, IRBT believes a peer set with an average enterprise value of $5 billion and sales multiple of 4x is most 


appropriate...clearly IRBT is undervalued! However, just a month earlier in its Proxy Statement filed on April 2014, 


IRBT used a vastly different peer set to measure its performance!!1

Spruce Point Believes


Market share appears overstated in Asia, and competition in 
its core US vacuum market appears to be intensifying. IRBT is 
ramping up its sales and marketing campaigns in an 
apparent attempt to fight market share erosion. Guidance 
that sales and orders are ‘back half of year’ weighted 
appears to be an attempt to kick the can down the road


IRBT has spent almost nothing to defend its IP and has not 
found a way to monetize its benefit through licensing 
arrangements. Furthermore, a majority of IRBT’s patents are 
mostly in the area of vacuuming, and include many self-
citations, which help create the appearance of importance


Telepresence opportunity for healthcare and enterprise video 
have issues. Market research suggests a shrinking enterprise 
video market, and a very slow ramp in telehealth since health 
professionals appear hesitant to embrace it. These 
opportunities are at high risk of not panning out for investors 


IRBT uses a variety of suspicious accounting gimmicks to 
boost EPS, while executive comp appears to be draining 
shareholder wealth. Valuation at 24x P/ ‘15E and 9.5x ‘15E 
EV/EBITDA does not incorporate our concerns of aggressive 
accounting, flawed governance and above avg. risk of 
earnings disappointments

Variant View: 


IRBT A One Trick Pony In Consumer Electronics


With a shrinking government and industrial business, we believe IRBT is better viewed as a narrowly 
focused consumer discretionary product company, with:


1. Powerful headwinds created in the housing market that may be restraining demand


2. A limited and faddish product offering due to its robot association, with a decaying moat


3. Rapidly intensifying competitive landscape


4. Limited to no pricing power


5. Almost no levers to drive a product replacement cycle


6. Products with rapid technology changes that increase the risk of product obsolescence


Furthermore, we believe investors should view IRBT’s opportunities in the enterprise and health 
telepresence market as nothing more than deeply out-of-the-money call options

Variant View: A Consumer Marketing Company, 


Not A High-Tech Company


IRBT would like analysts and investors to believe that it is a high-tech company worthy of a 


premium valuation. However, we observe that IRBT is now spending more on sales and marketing 


than actual research and development costs! In 2013, advertising campaigns caused sales and 


marketing expenses to exceed 17% of total revenues.

Forward Looking Valuation: 


Dramatically Lower Price Scenarios


We arrive at a price target range of $20 - $25 per share (20 – 40% downside). By applying an industry average P/E range of 14-16x 
2015E EPS of $1.42 we arrive at a $20 - $23 per share range. On enterprise value to revenue and EBITDA valuation multiples (to 
current Wall St. estimates which we believe will prove overly optimistic), we derive a price range scenario of $21 - $28 per share.  Our 
valuation even optimistically assumes IRBT’s patents have a value a $50 - $100m ($1.60 - $3.20/share) using a rule-of-thumb valuation 
of 5-10% of the home robotic’s total addressable market.1
