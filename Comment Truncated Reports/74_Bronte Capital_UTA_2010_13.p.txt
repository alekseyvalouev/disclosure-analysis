Questions for the Universal Travel Group conference call
The only communication I have had from Universal Travel Group was a kind email from the acting
Chief Financial Officer saying that I needed to provide proof that I was a shareholder to participate in
the conference call that they are having on Wednesday, September 29, 2010, to discuss and answer
any questions investors may have regarding the Company's business and financial statements.


I have some questions and I forwarded them in advance to the company as requested. 


The purpose of this post is to put the questions on the record in the hope that they are answered and
not to entertain my regular readers.  [I will try to entertain in the future – I promise…]

Questions


Housekeeping questions:   business alliances


China Telecom:   On   3   September   2009   the company announced a  “ strategic alliance ”  with China
Telecom.   The company did not however announce any contact name or identity at China Telecom
who could be asked about the  “ strategic alliance ” ( all the contacts were at UTA ) .   Can such a contact
be provided ?  If not then in what sense is it an alliance ?


Agoda/Priceline:    On   13   July   2010   the company announced a  “ partnership ”  with Agoda/Priceline.   The
company did not however announce any contact name or identity at Agoda/Priceline who could be
asked about the  “ partnership ” .   Can such a contact be provided ?  If not then in what sense is it a
partnership ?


Questions concerning telecom costs


The company in   2009   reported total telecoms cost of   75   thousand dollars.   This is a small amount
compared to over   600  “ tripeasy kiosks ”  with   3g facilities and a   300   seat phone centre.


What was the telecoms cost per tripeasy kiosk ?


What is the telecoms cost per phone-seat in the phone centre ?


What is the total telecoms cost of housing your combined websites ?  How much data is provided over
the websites and how much do you pay for it ?


How can we expect these costs to change over time ?


Questions regarding hotel relationships


The real kicker in hotel booking is when you have the relationship to lots of hotels and you can source
inventory.  ( Expedia for instance sources inventory globally and sells it both online and through travel
agents. )


You state in your   10K that your subsidiaries,   YZL and SLB  ( Shanghai Lanbao Travel Service
Company Limited )  have contracted with   2,000   hotels and   7,000   hotels,   respectively.


How many staff do you have looking after the contracts with all these hotels ?  How many are in
Shenzen and/or your call centers and how many are on the road (that is travelling buyers of hotel
inventory) ?  How much  does your IT department do to integrate their IT  ( ie booking systems )  with your
booking engine ?  How many IT staff are required to maintain the relationships with   9000   hotels
regarding things like integrating into hotel-reservation systems and other similar functions ?


What proportion of your hotel sales does hotels you directly contract cover ?  How many hotel sales do
you make from third party inventory ?  Who are your main third party inventory suppliers ? [ You
mentioned a deal with Agoda.   Before the Agoda deal which third parties did you source your hotel

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Questions for the Universal Travel Group conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/questions-for-universal-travel-group.html 2/7


inventory from?   Is there a conflict between multiple sources of inventory and your promise to
customers of “lowest price”?]


When you buy inventories from third parties   how much commission do you pay those third parties ?
 Can you go through the economics of selling rooms that you source yourself versus rooms you
sourced from third parties ?


If you have direct hotel relationships are there people at hotel chains with whom we can verify the
nature of the relationships ?  A contact at any major chain will do.


Relationships with airlines


The company claims on its website to be corporate partners with a wide range of airlines.


Could you please describe the nature of this  “ partnership ” .   Do your computers hook into their servers
and booking system hence allowing you to guarantee the lowest price ?  Do you have  “ most favored
nation clauses ”  which allow you to meet the promise you make on your website of “guaranteed lowest
price” ?


If so  –  can we have a contact at a single airline  ( let's pick Qantas )  with which we can confirm the
nature of this partnership ?


Oneworld versus Star Alliance


This list of airlines includes some OneWorld airlines  ( eg British Airways,   Quantas )  and some   Star
Alliance airlines  ( eg Swiss Air – but strangely not Lufthansa which owns Swiss Air ) .


What is the secret to maintaining  “ partnerships ”  with both of these groups ?  Under what conditions
does say Star Alliance allow you to deal with OneWorld?   It is very unusual to have  “ partnerships ”  with
both groups that allow you to maintain a “lowest price guarantee” with both groups.   In what way does
that partnership restrict your business?


Questions regarding internet traffic


The company has stated in several SEC filings that www.cba-hotel.com received   200   thousand
visitors per day in   2006 and you have repeated the claim in more recent filings. 


What is the visitor traffic per day in   2009   and so far in   2010   for that site ?  Have you managed the
merger of this traffic with your CNUTG site ?


What is the visitor traffic per day for www.cnutg.com ?


How do I reconcile these numbers to ChinaRank.org.cn which suggests that total users of these sites
are about   1-2   per million of population ?


Questions regarding cookies on the website ?


Do you have a process on the website to identify repeat visitors when they turn up  ( ie cookies ) .   What
information do the cookies contain ?  How do you manage privacy issues ? [ A typical privacy issue is

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Questions for the Universal Travel Group conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/questions-for-universal-travel-group.html 3/7


that a woman books a hotel room for her affair  ( or a guy for his ) .   The website remembers her  ( or him ) . 
 Spouse later books something and finds out.   Someone will be unhappy. ]


Do you have decent counts of the number of unique visitors to the website  – and if so what cookies
process do you use to maintain that count?  Do you have data on how many convert to sales ?  Have
you experimented in changing parts of the interface to see if you can capture more of the  “ lookers ”?


Could you explain processes for cross selling on the website.  ( i.e. how good are you at selling the
hotel after you have sold the flight ?)


Payments on the website


When I looked I found very few payment options compared to your competition.   Have you considered
paypal  ( used by CTrip )?


What proportion of your payments are online versus a telephone ring back to the number provided ?  If
you handle payments via a telephone ring back how do you deal with foreigners ?  Why not internet, 
 credit card,   paypal ?  Are there payment issues for foreigners that differ from Chinese ?  If so what are
they  –  and how do the leaders  ( CTrip especially )  deal with them ?


Intersegment costs


The   10K gave no intersegment eliminations for the business.   How much air travel booking or hotel-
reservation does the tour business buy from rest of the company ?  If these businesses are not related
then why own them under one umbrella ?  If the businesses are related  ( as I would expect )  then can
you please provide reasonable segment elimination accounts ?


Staff costs


The   10K reveals   780   staff and staff costs of just over   500   thousand.   Can you indicate how many
technology staff you have and roughly their average staff costs ?  Can you indicate how many staff are
in Shenzen.   Can you indicate how many staff are involved in maintaining your relationships with   7000 
 hotels  (and hence do not earn sales commission). How many are IT staff and other professional staff
(accountants and the like) who do not earn sales commissions?


Can you tell us how you reconcile the high staff numbers and low wage bill with minimum wage laws ?


Internet site development


You have  –  in the   10K  –  told us website maintenance cost   $40   thousand per year.   This seemed to be
a very low number compared to sites with traffic volumes as high as you cite and with as many
options as you cite. 


Could you explain how this cost of the internet site is arrived at and what costs of the internet site are
not included  ( ie costs of employing technical staff ) . 


Do you own or outsource your core servers ?


Housekeeping questions regarding related party transactions


In your last proxy you said this about related party transactions:


TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS,   PROMOTERS AND CERTAIN
CONTROL PERSONS 


 Related parties can include any of our directors or executive officers,   certain of our
stockholders and their immediate family members.   A conflict of interest occurs when an
individual’s private interest interferes,   or appears to interfere,   in any way with the
interests of the company as a whole.   Our code of ethics establishes requirements of our
officers regarding conflicts of interest.   Any violation of our code of ethics must be
reported to the Company’s chief operating officer or any member of the Company’s
Board.


Except for the ownership of our securities,   none of the directors,   executive officers, 
 holders of more than five percent of the Company’s outstanding common stock,   or any
member of the immediate family of any such person have,   to our knowledge,   had a
material interest,   direct or indirect,   in any transaction or proposed transaction,   since the
beginning of   2009,   in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount
involved exceeds   $120,000.


In the last   10Q  ( which pre-dated the proxy )  you stated that 


As of June   30,   2010,   Due from related party account has balance of   $6.99   million, 
 which was an advance for cash payment of two acquisitions in June.   The payments
were paid by corporate account on June   28,   2010   and the related party returned the
same amount on August   10,   2010.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Questions for the Universal Travel Group conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/questions-for-universal-travel-group.html 4/7


Posted by John Hempton at 3:53 PM  


What were the acquisitions?  Why was almost   7   million advanced to a related party for it ?  Which
related party ? Were both acquisitions from the same related party as implied in the above paragraph?


Are there any other acquisitions you have done involving related parties that have not been spelt out
in the various proxies.


Remuneration of the CEO


Whilst on the subject of proxies  –  what does the CEO live on ?


The proxies reveal the CEO receiving approximately   $9,230   in salary,   $1,411   in bonus and   $796,048 
 in stock compensation.   Cash receipts are roughly   $10   thousand per year. 


Similar cash receipts applied the previous year.  ( There was of course stock compensation then too. )


Jiangping Jiang however has not disclosed the sale of any shares which indicates that her only cash
income is the approximately   $10   thousand per year in salary and bonus. 


I understand that living in China is somewhat cheaper than Sydney or New York  –  but this seems
unusually frugal for a CEO whose net worth at times has been nearly   $100   million. 


What is the source of funds for the CEO’s living expense ?  I would appreciate at least some guidance
as to how this makes sense from Ms Jiang's perspective.


Thanks in advance.


John Hempton
