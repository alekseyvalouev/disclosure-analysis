Introduction 
 
Silverlake Axis Ltd (SAL) is a Malaysia-headquartered and Singapore Stock Exchange-listed company 
which provides software solutions to the financial industry. On paper, SAL appears to be an investor’s 
dream, providing consistent growth, high returns, strong cash flow, and a steady stream of dividends. 
However, we think SAL will prove instead to be an investor’s worst nightmare, like other fraudulent IT 
service companies Longtop Financial (China) and Satyam Computer Services (India). When we first 
reported our findings on Longtop in February 2011, it was a market darling. Three months later the 
auditor, Deloitte & Touche, resigned and the stock was delisted soon after. We think there are a number 
of striking similarities between SAL and Longtop. 


SAL’s founder and Chairman Goh Peng Ooi operates a large group of companies, collectively known as 
the Silverlake Group, which encompasses a complex web of murky, private companies connected to SAL, 
the listed entity. SAL engages in extensive related-party transactions with Goh through these private 
companies, and disclosure of these transactions lacks clarity. Fortunately, the Companies Commission of 
Malaysia requires all Malaysian companies, including private ones, to file audited financial statements 
which can be purchased on request (www.ssm-einfo.my). Based on our extensive research, we believe 
there are numerous red flags and ample evidence suggesting that Chairman Goh has used these related-
party transactions to inflate SAL's reported results.  


SAL reports supernormal profitability driven by dramatically higher revenue per employee compared to 
peers, which is the exact same red flag that existed at Longtop Financial. SAL also has loss-making 
related-parties which employ a large number of Silverlake Group employees. These hidden entities are 
undisclosed contingent liabilities to SAL. This is reminiscent of Longtop’s use of a related party to employ 
most of its employees. By inflating SAL’s financial results, Goh has been able to pocket more than RM 
1.0 billion (US$300 million) through stock sales and dividends, while minority shareholders have 
contributed more than RM 550 million (US$165 million) of net capital into SAL.

REPORT OUTLINE 


Section 1: Complex and Deceiving Corporate Structure 
SAL has a complicated history and group structure, with numerous related party transactions with 
opaque private entities controlled by Goh. We believe this structure was designed to confuse and 
deceive minority shareholders. We outline the important events in the development of the Silverlake 
Group to provide the context in which Goh has perpetrated fraud.  
Section 2: Alarming Reliance on Related Party Transactions 
SAL’s extensive use of related party transactions with Goh’s private companies is a red flag. Until 2009, 
related-party transactions accounted for the vast majority of SAL’s revenue and today they still account 
for nearly one-quarter of revenue and expenses. The rationale and justification for these related-party 
transactions is flimsy and their existence creates significant potential for fraudulent abuse. We believe 
that some or all of the related party revenue is fictitious and is used to inflate SAL’s reported profits. 
Frequent share placements likely help Goh fund the fictitious related party revenue through his private 
companies. 
Section 3: Self-Dealing and Related Party Acquisition Red Flags 
We outline four related-party asset injections into SAL which establish a clear pattern of deceit and 
abuse of minority shareholders. Aided by data from the Companies Commission of Malaysia and analysis 
of related party transactions, we show how Goh systematically inflated profitability of the businesses 
prior to injecting them into SAL. In this way, he used dubious financial reports to extract unreasonably 
high prices from minority shareholders for his own personal gain. 
Section 4: Large Undisclosed Loss-Making Related Parties are Contingent Liabilities 
We discovered the existence of large related party Silverlake private companies which are loss making 
with negative shareholders equity, and which only continue to operate with an explicit guarantee of 
financial support from Goh. These entities are known to have ongoing related party transactions with 
SAL, and they have a combined cost base almost as large as SAL with almost as many employees. We 
think these entities are being used to flatter the reported profitability of SAL. In reality, they are 
contingent liabilities to SAL that should be disclosed as such in the annual report. 
Section 5: Undisclosed Off-Balance Sheet Debt 
We found undisclosed, off-balance sheet debt which was recourse to SAL at the time of the IPO. If Goh 
was willing to hide contingent liabilities at that time, we worry that hidden off-balance sheet and 
recourse debt may still exist in some Silverlake Group companies. 
Section 6: Chairman’s History of Cashing Out at the Expense of Minority Shareholders 
SAL’s financials have been cleverly manipulated to entice minority shareholders, but an analysis of cash 
flow clearly shows that Goh is the one who is benefiting. Goh has been able to pocket more than RM 1.0 
billion (US$300 million) through stock sales and dividends, while minority shareholders have contributed 
more than RM 550 million (US$165 million) of net capital into SAL. We also note a highly suspicious 
contract with China’s HNA Group in 2010 where the S$70 million contract was secured for SAL in 
exchange for part of Goh’s personal shareholding in SAL stock, worth more than S$35 million at the 
time. Finally, we highlight that although reported revenue and net profit have grown at a rapid pace 
because of related-party asset injections, EPS has only increased at a 5.4% CAGR due to frequent dilutive 
related-party deals.

Section 7: Peer Analysis - Inexplicably High Profit Margins and Revenue per Employee 
Peer analysis shows that SAL has inexplicably high profit margins above 50%. The main driver of this 
supernormal profitability is exceptional revenue per employee, not lower costs. SAL’s revenue per 
employee is more than 50% higher than the nearest competitor. This is the exact same red flag which 
existed at Longtop Financial, which was proven to have fabricated revenue. 
Section 8: Declining Product Competitiveness and Bribery Allegations 
Our industry research identified other fundamental issues with the business. Customers we spoke to 
believe the product is poorly designed with no version control which makes any update to the system 
exceedingly time-intensive and costly. These issues are making new customer wins very difficult, which 
calls into question the growth story peddled by management. Of even greater concern, numerous 
customers, competitors, and ex-employees suggested in interviews that SAL may have secured 
customers through bribery. We are not accusing SAL of bribery, as it is difficult for us to independently 
verify, but the number of times bribery was mentioned during our field research is an ethical red flag 
and potential company-specific risk that could impact the long-term value of SAL. One needs look no 
further than the current anti-graft campaign in China to see how corruption can negatively impact the 
value of a business.  Furthermore, if bribery was a deciding factor for SAL in winning contracts, it could 
be symptomatic of an inferior product relative to competitors who do not engage in such practices. 
Section 9: Valuation and Price Target 
We arrive at a target price of S$0.29, which represents 65% downside from the current stock price. We 
arrive at this target by applying the peer average Price to Sales ratio (5.3x), multiplied by SAL’s non-
related party revenue. We stress that we believe this target price uses very generous and conservative 
assumptions, and we wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the stock is ultimately worth zero. We do not 
recommend investors purchase the stock at any price because with a deceptive and manipulative 
controlling shareholder like Goh, we doubt minority shareholders will accrue any value over time. We 
also doubt that SAL would have much value to an acquirer because of the ongoing related party 
transactions and key man risk.

Section 1: History of the Silverlake Group 
 


SAL has a complicated and confusing history. We believe Goh has purposely constructed a highly 
convoluted group structure with numerous related party transactions, in order to confuse and deceive 
SAL minority shareholders. An understanding of the origins and development of the group is necessary 
in order to discern how Goh has consistently deceived shareholders using related-party transactions and 
ownership dilution (Exhibit 1). In Section 2 and 4 of this report, we use acronyms to refer to the 
numerous Silverlake and related companies. We suggest readers use the key in Appendix 1 to help 
navigate the numerous entities and acronyms, which can be confusing. 





Goh Peng Ooi joined IBM Malaysia in 1981, after graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1980. While 
working as a Sales Manager for the banking & finance group at IBM in the late 1980s, Goh was assigned 
to a project focused on helping MUI Bank Bhd1 implement a new core banking system using IBM AS/400 
hardware. IBM was looking for a core banking software solution to co-market with IBM hardware. The 
software selected for the project was from Jack Henry & Associates (JHA), a US company, which at the 
time mainly served small US banks with a limited international presence. Goh flew to the US numerous 
times to meet with JHA during the selection process. IBM colleagues of Goh at the time say he then 
made a side deal with JHA, without IBM’s knowledge, to become the exclusive reseller for JHA in Asia.  


Goh quit IBM in 1989 to form Silverlake Systems Sdn Bhd (SSSB), a JV which was 75% owned by Goh and 
25% owned by Jack Henry International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JHA. The name Silverlake comes 
from IBM's early development codename for the AS/400 computer hardware. SSSB was awarded the 
exclusive right in Asia Pacific to relicense, install, maintain, modify, copy and implement the Jack Henry

Silverlake System (JH System). SSSB made modifications to the JH System so that it complied with 
banking and regulatory requirements in Malaysia, and subsequently other Asian Pacific countries. As 
part of the original deal, JHA was to receive 50% of all license fees generated from the Asia Pacific 
version of the JH System. SSSB was inserted into the MUI Bank project, which became SSSB’s first 
customer. In 1996, Goh acquired the remaining 25% stake in SSSB from JHA, and reached an agreement 
to clarify sole ownership of the modified Asia Pacific version of the JH System (referred to as Silverlake 
Integrated Banking System, or SIBS). It is unclear why JHA decided to exit the partnership, or how much 
Goh paid to acquire full ownership rights. 


In April 2000, the Goh-controlled SSSB acquired an 80% stake in Axis Systems Sdn. Bhd. (ASSB) from its 
founder, Wong Chew Ming. ASSB was established in 1990 and then developed a front-end bank branch 
software system. ASSB grew rapidly after Goh’s acquisition, supposedly by leveraging the network and 
customer base of the Silverlake Group, which by 2003 had grown to include approximately 1,000 
employees with offices and customers in 13 countries. 


In March 2003, Axis Systems Ltd (SAL) was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) with Goh acting 
as Chairman and Wong Chew Ming as Managing Director. SAL is a Bermuda-domiciled company 
established in 2002 and controlled by SSSB, Goh’s de facto holding company. ASSB was transferred into 
SAL as its primary operating company. In the IPO, SAL issued 42.9 million new shares to the public, equal 
to 15.7% of the enlarged total, at S$0.31 per share to raise net proceeds of RM 24.92 million (US$6.6 
million). This left Goh’s SSSB holding company with 60.30% ownership and Wong Chew Ming with 
13.88% of SAL. At the time of the IPO, the SGX-listed SAL was valued at RM 159 million (US$ 41.7 
million). Despite diluting his ownership in SAL, Goh still maintained 99.9% ownership in SSSB, as well as 
control over numerous other Silverlake Group companies which transacted with SAL. 


In May 2006, SAL acquired Silverlake Adaptive Applications & Continuous Improvement Services Ltd 
(SAACIS) from Goh for approximately RM 761 million (US$ 210 million) in the form of 836 million SAL 
shares2. This compared to SAL’s market cap of RM 255 million (US$ 72 million) at the time. SAACIS is a 
Bermuda incorporated holding company that was established in December 2003. The main business of 
SAACIS is the licensing of Silverlake Integrated Banking software (SIBS), which is the bank-end core 
banking software that was modified from the JH System. According to the transaction circular, SIBS 
intellectual property was originally owned by  Silverlake BVI Pte Ltd (SBVI), a British Virgin Islands 
incorporated company, in countries outside of Malaysia and jointly by SBVI and by SSSB within Malaysia. 
SAACIS acquired the sole rights to license SIBS software from SBVI and SSSB prior to the acquisition by 
SAL. The deal was highly dilutive for SAL shareholders, resulting in a nearly 300% increase in share count. 
The deal also would have taken Goh's shareholding percentage above the SGX limit of 85%3, so Goh 
simultaneously placed 46.409 million shares into the market on June 21, 2006, allowing him to pocket 
RM 31 million. Wong Chew Ming resigned shortly before the acquisition and disposed of his shares over 
the next year. Dr. Kwong Yong Sin was promoted to Managing Director, a position he still holds today.

The SAACIS acquisition was accounted for using pooling-of-interest method, which did not result in any 
goodwill on SAL's balance sheet, despite SAACIS having almost no net tangible assets. It is also worth 
noting that there were large parts of the Silverlake Group that were not acquired with SAACIS, which 
meant that large related party transactions would continue. Management's rationale at the time was 
that "The other businesses of the Silverlake Group, such as service and implementation, are currently 
undertaken by a sizable workforce with implementation skills rather than core software development 
skills. Axis will not need to incur the fixed costs and overhead of acquiring and maintaining the large 
workforce and support functions for implementation services which may adversely affect the profit 
margins of the group." Several months after the SAACIS acquisition, SAL changed its name to Silverlake 
Axis Ltd, the name it retains today. 


In February 2010, SAL simultaneously acquired Silverlake Solutions Ltd (SSB) and QR Group from Goh. 
Similar to the SAACIS acquisition, SAL acquired SSB and QR Group by issuing shares to Goh. SSB was 
acquired for RM701.9 million (US$ 208 million) via the issuance of 879.4 million new shares. QR Group 
was acquired for RM117.9 million (US$ 35.0 million) via the issuance of 146.2 million new shares. In 
total, the two acquisitions nearly doubled SAL's outstanding share count which again resulted in 
substantial dilution to SAL shareholders while Goh received US$ 243 million in shares. SSB provides 
maintenance services, application management services, and program change requests to customers 
who have licensed and are using the SIBS software. The rationale for acquiring SSB is to expand the 
income base and enable the group to provide a comprehensive range of services related to the SIBS 
software, with SSB business being “relatively stable, repeatable, good profit margins, and potential to 
grow steadily over time.” This seems inconsistent with the stated rationale for not acquiring the SSB 
business in 2006 due to the “large workforce and high fixed costs”. The QR Group develops, licenses, 
and sells retail management software systems for the retail industry. The rationale for acquiring the QR 
Group was to expand SAL's product range, industry, and geographic reach. SSB and QR Group were also 
accounted for using pooling-of-interest accounting, which did not result in any goodwill on SAL's balance 
sheet. 


There have been a number of other smaller acquisitions over the years including SBI Card Processing, 
Merimen, Cyber Village, and most recently Finzsoft. However we will focus in this report on the larger 
deals with clearer related party issues. 


Section 2: Alarming Reliance on Related Party Transactions 
 


We believe that related party transactions are the core mechanism used by Goh to perpetrate fraud at 
SAL. Since its IPO in 2003, SAL has relied extensively on related party transactions (Exhibit 2). Between 
FY2003-FY2009, the vast majority of SAL revenue was generated from related party companies in the 
Silverlake Group controlled by Goh. While the percent of revenue from related parties has declined 
since 2010 following the acquisition of SSB, related parties still accounts for nearly one quarter of group 
revenue and expenses. We believe that Goh’s stated rationale for not having all Silverlake Group entities 
consolidated into SAL is flimsy at best. It is not a practice used by peers in the industry. It is also very 
telling that even after the SAACIS and SSB acquisitions supposedly brought nearly all of the Silverlake
Page  ϋ  
 


Group business into SAL, significant related party transactions have continued. In fact the absolute 
magnitude of total related party transactions reached a new high in FY2014. 


From FY2003-FY2007, SAL disclosed a more detailed record of SAL’s transactions with each Silverlake 
entity (Appendix 2). However from FY2008 onwards, SAL has only disclosed aggregate related party 
transaction amounts, with no related party entity breakdown. This more limited disclosure has 
significantly reduced transparency, making it nearly impossible to track the related parties with whom 
SAL transacts. 





We expect that SAL management will argue that these related party transactions have all been properly 
reported in the annual report and approved by the auditors. While that may technically be true, that 
does not ensure that related party transactions have not been abused. Silverlake uses at least 12 
different auditors4 in Malaysia alone, for its various private entities (Appendix 3). This most likely means 
that no audit team has a full picture of the web of related party transactions across the group. 
Furthermore, we have seen countless examples of Chinese companies, including the recent example of 
Hanergy Thin Film Power Group, which had disclosed related party transactions approved by auditors 
but which proved to have helped facilitate fraud5. 


With so much revenue generated from related party transactions, Goh can easily generate fictitious 
revenue for SAL through his private Silverlake Group entities. Satyam and Longtop used similar 
playbooks with falsified invoices leading to revenue overstatements and inflated profits. Goh’s 
numerous share placements over the years may have provided the cash with which to fund the fake 
related-party revenue transactions, thereby generating higher reported profits at SAL and a higher share

price, which allows Goh to do his next placement at an even higher price. In this way, Goh creates a 
virtuous cycle of corporate tunneling fraud, a very clever scheme (Exhibit 3). Perhaps it is not a 
coincidence that Goh has publicly referred to the Silverlake system as a “scheme”, using the acronym 
SCIIM6 (“Silverlake Collaborative Intelligence and Innovation Model”) or in other instances SCCIM7 
(“Silverlake Collaborative Capability and Intelligent Model”).  





Section 3: Self-Dealing and Related Party Acquisition Red Flags 
 


As discussed in the background section, SAL has made a number of large related-party acquisitions by 
purchasing assets from Goh. We believe these transactions are a critical component of the fraud. The 
related-party sale of businesses to SAL has allowed Goh to dispose large amounts of stock, all while 
maintaining control of SAL. We believe this cash received from stock sales has not only enriched Goh, 
but also provided him with the cash to generate fake revenue for SAL via his related party companies. 


In this section we identify suspicious red flags in four major transactions starting with the IPO in 2003. 
The common, recurring theme with these transactions is that the assets experienced miraculous growth 
in the few years prior to the transaction, typically aided by related party transactions with other Goh 
controlled private companies. In all but one case, the business sold deteriorated shortly after it was sold 
to SAL. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Goh used related party dealings to inflate results and 
deceptively sell assets to minority shareholders at unreasonably high prices. As a reminder, we 
recommend readers use Appendix 1 as a reference when reading this Section of the report.

Readers who are more interested in a high level summary of our findings may want to skip to Section 4, 
as Section 3 is quite detailed. 


2003: Axis Systems Sdn Bhd (ASSB) 
 


As described earlier in the report, ASSB (Axis Systems Sdn. Bhd.) was founded by Wong Chew Ming in 
1990 and Goh acquired a controlling 80% interest in 2000. We don't know the exact price Goh paid for 
the ASSB stake, but his holding company SSHB took out a loan in the amount of RM 8.2 million (US$2.16 
million), with the 80% stake in ASSB provided as collateral (Appendix 4). Therefore we believe Goh likely 
acquired the stake for around RM 8.2 million. 





Goh benefited tremendously from the reported growth of ASSB after he acquired control in 2000 
(Exhibit 4). ASSB sales increased by 367% between 1999 and 2002 and profit increased an even more 
remarkable 650%. This growth caused the value of Goh's ownership stake in ASSB to rise from an 
estimated Rm 8.2 million to nearly RM 96 million in just three years at the time of the IPO in 2003, 
despite the dilution which occurred when new shares were issued during the IPO. 


It is noteworthy that related-party sales (i.e. sales made to other Goh-controlled Silverlake Group 
companies) climbed from nothing in 1999 to over 90% of sales in 2003. Thus, all of ASSB's sales growth 
was driven by sales to related-party companies. The 2003 SAL prospectus attributes the growth over this 
period to "tapping on the Silverlake Group's network." While the sales growth was remarkable, the 
increase in profit margins was even more astounding. Between 1994-1999, ASSB had pretax profit 
margins typically between 30-49% and net margins between 21-40%. After Goh acquired control and 
related-party transactions rose to more than 90% of revenue, ASSB's pretax margin jumped to 71% in 
2002 and remained above 60% for the next few years. The margin improvement was largely driven by a 
rise in gross margin rather than a large decline in selling & distribution expenses. This is counterintuitive 
because related parties were now supposedly responsible for selling and distributing the software. One 
might have expected to see ASSB’s gross margins go down as the margin was split with the related 
parties. This is a red flag. 


In light of the suspicious growth achieved prior to the IPO, it is interesting to track the performance of 
ASSB following the IPO. Results improved in FY2003 and FY2004 but then the business started to 
deteriorate, and in particular the profit margin declined materially. Absolute profits peaked in FY2004

and margins never returned to the inflated levels achieved just before and after the IPO. Moreover, 
revenues declined from RM 33m in 2004 to less than RM 9m 10 years later. Taken in isolation, this fact 
may not alarm investors. However, as we will show, the transaction fits a pattern of deals whereby Goh 
sells assets into the listed group following a miraculous period of growth, after which results deteriorate 
dramatically. When this pattern is combined with the predominantly related-party transaction driven 
nature of the business, the opportunity and likelihood for fraud and manipulation appears very high. 


2006: Silverlake Adaptive Applications & Continuous Improvement Services Ltd (SAACIS) 
 


As a reminder, there were Silverlake private entities which were restructured into SAACIS (Exhibit 5), 
SSSB and SBVI. We were able to obtain historical financial statements for SSSB, a Malaysian company, 
but not for SBVI because private company financial statements are not publicly available in the British 
Virgin Islands.  





There are several red flags surrounding the SAACIS deal in 2006. The acquisition circular provides three 
years of pro forma historical financial statements for SAACIS (Exhibit 6).

In the FY06 financial statements for SSSB, there is a footnote (Appendix 5) regarding the SIBS 
Intellectual Property disposed to SAACIS. SIBS IP is the critical intellectual property for Silverlake’s core 
banking software product, and therefore should theoretically be the most valuable asset of the 
Silverlake Group. The rights to the SIBS IP, owned by SSSB, were sold to SAAICS for only RM 3.9 million, 
based on an indicative valuation of the company's rights in the SIBS IP by an independent professional 
valuer. This compares to the total acquisition value of SAACIS by SAL of RM 761 million (US$210 million), 
as discussed earlier. Furthermore, the contribution of the disposed SIBS IP business over the 16.5 
months prior to the disposal had sales of RM 24.9 million and a net loss of RM 6.6 million. The net loss 
included a software impairment charge of RM 8.0 million, but even if we exclude that, the adjusted net 
income was only RM 1.4 million. The disposed business had a gross margin of only 27.4% and an 
adjusted operating margin of only 5.6%, compared to the pro forma SAACIS gross margins of 71-82% 
and operating margins of 63%-75%. We find this enormous discrepancy in profitability and valuation 
troubling. 


There is another red flag in the pro forma SAACIS financials (Exhibit 6). The pro forma statements show 
a pleasant trend of growing earnings from FY03-05. However, more than half of the revenue is 
generated from related party transactions. The most interesting related party transaction is with 
Silverlake Research & Marketing Institute Ltd (SRMI), a previously unknown Bermuda incorporated 
company. SRMI accounted for 0% of SIBS licensing revenue in FY03 and FY04, but it accounted for 43% 
in FY05 and 61% in FY06. Buried in the footnotes of the circular (Appendix 6), it is disclosed that SRMI 
licensed certain SIBS software modules for use in the public utilities industry for a total of US$7 million 
and for the airline industry for US$11 million. We find the SRMI licenses suspicious. First, we question

how easily adaptable decade old core banking software modules are to public utility and airline 
applications. Second, we note that the Silverlake Group has another private group company in Malaysia, 
Silverlake Component Technology Solutions Sdn Bhd, which was already providing software to the 
airline industry since as early as 2003 (Appendix 7). Why did SRMI buy SIBS licenses for the airline 
industry when the Silverlake Group already had airline software capability? We note that without the 
revenue provided by SRMI in FY05 and FY06, SAACIS would have reported sharply declining revenue and 
profits, which would have made the deal far less appealing to minority shareholders (Exhibit 6). 


A final red flag to highlight is the sharp decline in SIBS licensing revenue that occurred three years after 
the SAACIS deal was completed (Exhibit 7).  





This gain fits the pattern of Goh selling companies to SAL with inflated or peak financial results in order 
to extract the highest price to the detriment of SAL minority shareholders and to the benefit of Goh. SAL 
group revenue declined 63% and operating profit declined 80% in FY09. Revenue from licensing of SIBS, 
which was the majority of the SAACIS business, fell an even sharper 83% that year. Management 
attributed the poor results to the financial crisis and global recession, which no doubt affected many 
businesses globally. However, we note that SAL's competitors, with very similar business models, 
reported much more resilient results (Exhibits 8-9). Oracle Financial Services (OFS) actually reported 
+23% revenue growth in fiscal year Mar-2009 and only a -5% decline in fiscal year Mar-2010. OFS’ 
license fee revenue declined only -19% in Mar-2010. Temenos reported a -9% decline in revenue in fiscal 
year Dec-2009, with software license fee revenue declining only -16%. We note that both OFS and 
Temenos have higher exposure to US and European banking customers, which were more severely 
impacted by the financial crisis than Southeast Asian banks. We fail to understand how SAL's license fee 
business could have suffered so dramatically relative to peers, and the competitors we interviewed also 
found SAL’s poor performance during 2008-09 inexplicable.

2010: Silverlake Solutions Ltd (SSB) 
 


Recall that in February 2010, SAL acquired Silverlake Solutions Ltd (SSB) from Goh for RM 702 million 
(US$208 million) in stock. Prior to the acquisition, SSB underwent a restructuring exercise. SSB provides 
maintenance services, application management services, and program change requests to customers 
who have licensed and are using SIBS software. SSB was a new holding company incorporated in 
Bermuda on November 26, 2007. The restructuring exercise involved transferring all of the Structured 
Services Business from Silverlake Group private companies to the SSB (Exhibit 10). It also involved the 
cessation of structured services provided by Silverlake Innovation Partners (SIP Group) and this business 
was transferred to SSB. SSB established brand new subsidiaries during 2009 in Malaysia, Singapore, 
Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.

There was only limited disclosure on which Silverlake Group private companies were previously handling 
the structured services business activities, which makes investigating the historical performance of SSB 
much more difficult. However, the instances of disclosure that we could find, which are outlined below, 
suggest that the operating margins of the Structured Service businesses were somewhere between mid-
teens and loss making. This contrasts sharply with the pro forma data presented by management in the 
acquisition circular, which suggests that the Structured Service business was a 55-56% gross margin and 
52-55% operating margin business (Exhibit 11). These sharply contrasting data points are a red flag.

Silverlake Innovation Partners Sdn Bhd (“SIP Group”) was identified as one of the Silverlake Group 
private companies which previously provided Structured Service business prior to the SSB restructuring. 
SIP Group ostensibly engaged in substantially the same business as SSB and therefore ought not to have 
wildly divergent profit margins. As SIP Group is a Malaysian private company, we have access to the 
historical financial statements (Exhibit 12). These historical financial statements are a red flag. Prior to 
the cessation of Structured Service business November 1, 2009, SIP Group had gross margins that range 
from 16-37% and operating margins ranging from negative to 16%. This is a radically different business 
than the pro forma SSB financial statements we are given in the circular. 





SSSB also transferred a Structured Service business to SSB in November 2009. The footnotes to SSB's 
2010 annual report (Appendix 8) provide the financial performance of the discontinued Structured 
Service operations from July 1, 2009 to October 31, 2009. Similar to the SIP financials, we see a much 
less profitable Structured Service operation than the SSB circular suggests. The transferred Structured 
Service business had a gross margin of 30.9% and an operating margin of 27.5%, the latter of which is 
only half of the SSB pro forma financials. 


Another red flag is in the appendix of the 2010 acquisition circular, which contains the Pro Forma 
consolidated financial statements of SSB prepared by Ernst & Young (Appendix 9). It identifies two of 
the Silverlake Group private companies that transferred Structured Services business to SSB, PT 
Silverlake Advanced IT Solutions in Indonesia and Silverlake Sistem Sdn. Bhd. in Brunei. Both entities had 
capital deficiencies (i.e. negative shareholder equity) and were only operating with financial support 
from Goh. Without this support, both subsidiaries would have been insolvent. Once again, these two 
entities do not provide supportive evidence of a high margin Structured Services business. 


All of the instances of disclosure we have found of the predecessor Structured Services businesses 
suggest a much less profitable business than we are led to believe by the pro forma financials in the 
Circular. This must imply that one or more of the other predecessor Structured Services businesses had 
extremely high profitability, in order to offset the other less profitable and loss making subsidiaries we 
identified. One possible explanation is that Goh used related party transactions to produce a Structured

2010: QR Technology Sdn Bhd (QR Group) 
 


Goh acquired control of QR Group in October 2001 and then sold it to SAL in March 2010. QR Group’s 
main product is PROFIT, a procurement and inventory management software system for the retail 
industry. The operating subsidiary of QR Group is QR Retail Automation Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian company, 
so we were able to access detailed historical financial statements (Exhibit 13). 





 The QR Group financials disclosed in the SAL transaction circular, covering the FY2007-FY2009 period, 
paint a picture of a rapidly growing and increasingly profitable business. Prior to FY2007, QR Group 
revenue was stagnant, varying between Rm 2.5-3.6 million before skyrocketing to over RM 19m in 2010. 
Unfortunately for minority shareholders, in the first full year after being acquired, QR Group's results 
plummeted. In FY2011, sales declined by more than 60% and net income plunged more than 80%. In the 
four years following the acquisition, net income has never reached even half the level achieved in 
FY2010. The circular attributes the strong growth in FY2007-FY2009 to a large contract secured from 
AEON Malaysia in September 2008.  


We spoke to a contact at Aeon Malaysia about the PROFIT contract. The contact confirmed that the 
installation in 2009-10 cost US$4-5m (RM 14-17.5m). The contact also confirmed that it was clear in the 
contract that ongoing license and maintenance fees would be at most 40% of the upfront installation 
cost. Therefore, we have a hard time believing that Goh didn't realize QR Group results would 
deteriorate dramatically when this installation contract with AEON Malaysia was completed in 2010. 
Goh sold QR Group to SAL for RM 117.9 million but the business has only generated cumulative net 
income over the past four years of RM 9.8 million. Once again, this deal fits the pattern of Goh 
deceptively selling assets with peaking performance to minority shareholders.

Section 4: Undisclosed Loss-Making Related Parties are Contingent Liabilities 
 


The Silverlake Group is comprised of the SGX-listed SAL and numerous private companies also controlled 
by Goh. SAL shareholders and auditors are primarily focused on the profitability of the stand-alone SAL 
entity. However it would be wise to focus on the whole Silverlake Group profitability, as Goh surely 
does. There is a clear risk that the large number of related party transactions between SAL and private 
group companies could be used by an unscrupulous controlling shareholder to inflate the performance 
of SAL. Therefore our discovery of Silverlake Sprints Sdn Bhd ("Sprints") and Silverlake Infrastructure & 
Logistics Sdn Bhd (SI&L), both Silverlake Group private companies, are of particular concern because 
they appear to be doing just that.  


Sprints was incorporated as Intuitive Technology Sdn Bhd in March 2001, but Goh acquired control in 
April 2010 and changed the name to Silverlake Sprints in May of that year. The historical financials are 
available at the Companies Commission of Malaysia (Exhibit 14).  





Since it was acquired by Goh, Sprints has been consistently and increasingly unprofitable. Sprints’ gross 
margin has ranged from -28% to +26% and the operating margin has been negative every year. 
Cumulative losses have totaled more than Rm 67 million. As we discussed in an earlier section of the 
report, SAL no longer discloses the names of companies that engage in related party acquisitions with 
SAL but we know that Dr. Kwong has mentioned in meetings with investors that Sprints has ongoing 
related party transactions with SAL. The footnotes to the financial statements of Sprints explain that the 
company has received an explicit letter of support from Goh that he will continue to provide financial 
support to Sprints so that it can meet its liabilities when they fall due (Appendix 10). The Sprints’

statements also show that the number of employees has grown from 198 in 2010 to 581 at the end of 
2013. Considering that SAL only has approximately 8008 employees in total, 581 employees is very 
significant in the context of the Silverlake Group.  


SI&L is a subsidiary of the Bermuda based holding company, Silverlake Outsourcing Ltd, which is 
controlled by Goh. SI&L has over 100 employees and reports recurrent losses (Exhibit 15). Dr. Kwong 
has also mentioned SI&L as a company that has ongoing related party transactions with SAL. Similar to 
Sprints, SI&L’s auditor notes in the financial statements that the company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern is dependent upon the financial support from Goh (Appendix 11). 





We note that Sprints and SI&L are not small companies in comparison to SAL. In fact, the combined 
operating expenditure of these two non-consolidated companies is only approximately 25% less than 
the entire operating expenditure of SAL9. We find the existence of Sprints and SI&L troubling, and 
wonder whether any other similar undisclosed, loss-making related party entities exist. These two 
Silverlake Group companies appear to be entities designed to take employees off the books at SAL in 
order to improve SAL’s reported profitability. Considering that both companies are reliant on a financial 
guarantee from Goh, we think Sprints and SI&L are contingent liabilities to SAL, and should be disclosed 
as such in SAL’s annual report. It would make even more sense to have both companies, and other 
similar companies which may exist, consolidated into SAL’s financial statements. The opaque disclosure 
by SAL management of related party entities such as Sprints and SI&L should be very concerning to 
shareholders.

Section 5: Undisclosed Off-Balance Sheet Debt 
 


Another potential concern with related-party transactions is that they can be used by a company like 
SAL to hide debt off-balance sheet. We discovered debt taken by SSSB prior to the IPO of SAL. 
Appendixes 12-14 show three loans taken by SSSB between 1997-1999 from EON Bank Berhad. SSSB 
borrowed RM 30 million in January 1998, RM 30 million in October 1998, and RM 10 million in 
December 1999. The loans are secured by all current and future assets of SSSB. We are unsure why SSSB 
took these loans, which seem quite large compared to the size of the business at the time. The timing of 
the loans is also interesting because it coincides with the Asian Financial Crisis and a dramatic 
depreciation of the Malaysian Ringgit and other Asian currencies. We wonder if Goh made some poor 
investments which forced him to borrow against SSSB during the crisis. 


We are surprised that there was no disclosure of these loans in the 2003 SAL prospectus. At the time of 
the IPO, SAL was a subsidiary of SSSB, which would imply that the loans were also secured by SAL assets. 
It is also interesting that two of these loans totaling RM 40 million were not repaid until September 
2006, just three months after Goh made a sizeable on-market disposal of SAL shares in June 2006, 
totaling RM 31 million (Exhibit 17 in next section). Did Goh not have the resources to repay the loans for 
7-8 years despite operating a supposedly large and profitable group? 


By 2014, SSSB had repaid the majority of its outstanding loans. Some investors may take comfort in this 
and regard the existence of these loans nearly a decade ago as irrelevant. However, we believe this 
example highlights how related party transactions with private Silverlake Group companies can result in 
hidden off-balance sheet liabilities. It also shows that Goh has willingly used off-balance sheet loans in 
the past, and not disclosed them to SAL shareholders. Although we have not located evidence of large 
present day off-balance loans, we suggest that they may exist at other Silverlake Group subsidiaries 
where financial statements are not publicly accessible. Goh’s use of undisclosed off-balance sheet debt 
in the past is a red flag that SAL shareholders and auditors should be acutely aware of.

Section 6: Chairman’s History of Cashing Out at the Expense of Minority 
Shareholders 
 


The casual observer of SAL may conclude that Chairman Goh is well aligned with minority shareholders. 
After all, he has a large controlling ownership in the group and receives dividends alongside other 
shareholders. However, we think appearances are deceiving. We estimate that Goh has taken over RM 
1.0 billion (US$300 million) out of SAL through share sales and dividends from the IPO through June 
2014. Over the same period of time, minority shareholders have contributed more than RM 750 million 
of capital through equity issuance while receiving less than RM 200 million in dividends (Exhibit 16). 





Goh has been a consistent seller of SAL shares over time and has pocketed nearly RM 500m from these 
transactions (Exhibit 17). In addition to his numerous on-market disposals, Goh has made several very 
unusual disposals. In September 2010, Goh transferred 48.25 million shares to executives of Silverlake 
private entities for past contributions. This represented an award of RM 17.4 million in market value to 
the unnamed executives. This is reminiscent of the bizarre unexplained gifting of shares to employees by 
Longtop Financial’s chairman. We wonder why these executives were not paid directly by the private 
entities. 


We also note a particularly suspicious series of transactions with HNA Group (HNA), a Chinese 
conglomerate. In 2010, SAL announced a strategic relationship with HNA, whereby SAL secured two new 
contracts totaling S$70 million from HNA10. As part of the deal, Goh agreed to transfer a total of 242 
million of his SAL shareholding to HNA. HNA was then free to sell the shares into the market. According

Note: Analysis assumes that shares transferred from Goh to HNA Group are disposed in the market

to the deal, after the shares were sold Goh would receive a maximum of S$0.16 per share and HNA 
would receive the difference between the disposal price and S$0.16. SAL’s stock was trading between 
S$0.31-0.35 at the time, so the deal in effect looks like Goh was “buying” contracts from HNA in 
exchange for shares. In three transactions between 2010 and 2014, Goh transferred 121 million shares 
to HNA11. We assume these shares were subsequently disposed by HNA, because HNA is not disclosed 
as a major shareholder of SAL. There is nothing illegal about this transaction, but it raises suspicion 
because Goh provided his personal shares to HNA in order to secure the contracts. Therefore the HNA 
contracts may have resulted in a deceptively profitable contract flowing through SAL’s income 
statement because the contracts’ hidden cost of transferring shares to HNA did not flow through SAL’s 
income statement. 








We also find the large amount of equity placed in June 2013 concerning. The company raised RM 180 
million from issuing new shares and RM 61 million from reissuing treasury shares. This coincided with 
Goh placing an additional RM 151 million of his personal shareholding. The company justified the equity 
raising with the need to fund the acquisitions of Merimen Ventures and Cyber Village for a total of RM 
95 million. However, we wonder why the company needed to raise RM 241 million of fresh equity when 
SAL already had a net cash position of RM 181 million on the balance sheet and minimal capital 
expenditure requirements. In our experience, unnecessary equity issuances are a red flag. 


                                                           
11 It’s unclear why the total transfer of shares was only half of the originally agreed 242 million shares

Finally, it is worth noting that while SAL’s reported net income has increased at a very healthy 
compound rate of +28.3% over twelve years, EPS has increased at a much more pedestrian +5.4% 
(Exhibit 18). The dilution from Goh’s frequent asset injections and equity issuances has led to significant 
dilution for minority shareholders. As we have seen time and again, Goh wins, minority shareholders

Section 7: Peer Analysis – SAL’s Inexplicably High Profit Margins and Revenue 
per Employee 
 


We conducted peer analysis using Temenos Group AG and Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd (OFS), 
an Indian subsidiary of Oracle Corp, because they are the closest pure-play core banking listed peers. 
SAL reports by far the highest profitability of these peers (Exhibit 19). Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 
(TCS) and Infosys Ltd are also direct competitors in core banking software in Asia Pacific but both 
companies have much more diversified operations. However for reference, both TCS and Infosys have 
operating margins in the mid-20 percent range, which is also substantially lower than SAL. We note that 
despite being one-third the size of Temenos and one-quarter the size of OFS, SAL has much higher 
operating margins. This is a red flag, as some economies of scale should be expected.

Cheap labor alone cannot explain SAL’s higher profitability, since OFS has a very similar cost per 
employee for its largely India-based work force. Higher revenue per employee seems to be the major 
driver of SAL’s higher profitability. SAL generates revenue per employee more than 50% higher than 
Temenos and more than 250% higher than OFS. This is a striking finding, particularly since Temenos and 
OFS have many employees working in developed markets where man-hour billing rates are much higher.  


"Based on my personal experience in [ASEAN] markets, $200,000 revenue per employee seems 
very unreasonable. I find it very, very unlikely […] Maybe a strategy consultant like Accenture or 
McKinsey could do that, but for IT projects, I think $50,000-$60,000 is a more realistic figure." 
 - ASEAN manager of a Silverlake competitor 


When we spoke with ex-SAL employees, they described a cushy corporate culture, which does not 
sound supportive of a hyper productive workforce.  


"If you want an easy way, to relax, Silverlake is the place to go. You get your salary and there is no 
pressure … One good thing about Goh is there is lots of entertainment, going to conferences, and 
so on […] These people never leave because they are well rewarded. They are well paid. 
[Silverlake] changes their car every year, they have [their own] driver. All those people that are 
doing sales don't have a quota. Many people are very complacent, they don't want to leave. They 
just take home a salary. I know people at Silverlake that have not closed a deal for five to ten 
years and they are still there, just taking it easy, no pressure." - ex-Silverlake employee 


We note that the unusually high productivity of SAL employees relative to industry peers is supportive of 
the company reporting fictitious revenue from related parties. The exact same pattern of inexplicably 
high revenue per employee was observed at Longtop Financial. Dr. Kwong has argued that SAL’s margins 
are higher because they don’t spend as much on R&D, but analysis clearly shows that the supernormal 
profit margins are a result of higher revenue per employee, not lower costs. 


Finally we note that employee benefits account for more than 70% of total expenses at both Temenos 
and OFS but less than 40% at SAL. This is partly explained by the more than 20% of SAL’s expenses which 
are fees paid to related parties. Additionally, nearly 40% of SAL’s expenses are unexplained in the 
financial statements or footnotes, which is very unusual by industry standards or Singapore reporting 
standards.  


Section 8: Declining Product Competitiveness and Bribery Allegations 
 


Beyond the financial chicanery, we think there are also fundamental issues with the core Silverlake 
business which are cause for concern.  


In interviews12, Chairman Goh seems to view himself as an enlightened mathematical philosopher. He 
even claims to have invented the most advanced form of game theory in the world, which he calls the

Goh MI (Mathematical Intelligence) Game Theory13. Recent SAL annual reports have an E8 diagram on 
the cover, and the group has adopted the slogan “Symmetry at Work.”  


We find this ironic because conversations with customers and ex-Silverlake employees suggest that the 
flagship Silverlake Integrated Banking Software (SIBS) product is anything but a work of mathematical 
symmetry. Quite to the contrary, most customers we spoke to described SIBS as an inferior and 
inflexible product compared with competing software from Oracle, Temenos, TCS, and Infosys. One of 
the primary issues dates back to the original modification of the JH System into SIBS. When Silverlake 
completed the system for MUI Bank, they took the MUI version of SIBS and adapted it for the next 
client. This practice has continued for each new customer and as a result, SIBS has no software version 
control. This makes any updates to the system exceedingly timely and costly.  


“Silverlake’s core banking product is nothing much to shout about. Architecturally it is not so 
elegant, not so sexy. They have a very traditional legacy architecture, it’s not SOE enabled, it is 
built using RPG and there is no object orientation, there is some ability to parameterize, but 
predominantly every time you want to make changes, you literally need to do it through brute 
force. You need to get a programmer in to add functionality. I’ve worked with a lot of other 
banking professionals and a lot of them share my view.”  – Senior IT Manager at Silverlake 
customer 


"[Silverlake] has the base from Jack Henry and then they customize from there. You don't get an 
upgrade. You basically get a patch for defects. You don't get a new release version with new 
functionality. It's very static. Finacle from Infosys gives you new version updates and all banks 
using it get that benefit. They have a couple thousand employees updating Finacle, making 
constant improvements." –ex-customer of Silverlake core banking software 


"Honestly when I look at the sales pipeline I don't see any new projects where Silverlake is a 
competitor. Silverlake is behind at the moment. Digital banking is a space where Silverlake cannot 
compete at the moment with their offering because they don't have a digital framework for their 
core banking solution. If [the bank wants] to go digital, they realize that, oh before we can go 
digital, we need to fix the back-end first. They end up looking at vendors like Oracle, Infosys, or 
Temenos  that can provide a digital solution front to back." – Manager of Silverlake competitor 


While we are not suggesting Silverlake is in near-term danger of losing all of its existing customers 
because of these product deficiencies, winning new customers may become increasingly difficult, which 
is supported by a lack of recent news on new contract wins. In fact, Silverlake appears to be in danger of 
losing a tender of a core banking solution for RHB Bank to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Silverlake has 
rarely lost major deals on its home turf in Malaysia, so the fact that TCS is being considered by RHB is a 
worrisome development for Silverlake.  


Of even more potential concern, numerous customers, ex-employees, and competitors suggested in 
interviews that many of Silverlake's key banking contracts in Malaysia and Indonesia may have been 
secured, at least in part, due to bribery.

“There are many stories in the market that Silverlake is a master in terms of influencing and 
sweetening deals for the key decision makers at the client. It is very well known.” – Silverlake 
customer 


"How does Silverlake get away with these sort of prices in Malaysia, compared to anywhere 
outside of Malaysia? In 2013, they sold [a project] to a Malaysian bank for RM 400 million. 
Everyone was very shocked about it. People are wondering how this happened. Competitors 
[thought] it is unbelievable. But of course behind the scenes, if prices are high the kickbacks are 
also high. So that's how it works here [at Silverlake]. I'm being very open and frank about it, but 
that's how it works ... At Silverlake, we do it through [related party] partners. Because [Silverlake 
Axis], it's listed and whatnot, so they make sure that their name is clear. The partners pay the 
kickback. At Silverlake, once we get the link to the right [person in the target customer], we have a 
way to do it." - ex-Silverlake employee 


“The previous CIO was known to be very close to Silverlake. When we looked through some of the 
deals we did with Silverlake, we couldn’t understand why we paid so much. When the [previous 
CIO] left, he joined Silverlake.” – Silverlake customer 


"For Malaysian banks, it's a waste of time to try to compete with Silverlake. It's Silverlake's home 
market, and they don't exactly play a fair game […] There are all sorts of rumors of bribery swirling 
around this company.” –Manager at Silverlake competitor 


This report will stop short of accusing SAL of bribery, as this is something difficult for us to 
independently verify. However, it is noteworthy the number of instances SAL bribery was mentioned in 
our conversations with industry participants. The numerous allegations in the market around Silverlake’s 
bribery represent an ethical red flag that key stakeholders in SAL, including customers, directors, 
employees, auditors, and shareholders, should consider with great caution. If the allegations are true, it 
presents a company-specific risk which could significantly impair the long-term value of SAL. One needs 
look no further than the current anti-graft campaign in China to see how corruption can negatively 
impact the value of a business.  Furthermore, if bribery was a deciding factor for SAL in winning 
contracts, it could be symptomatic of an inferior product relative to competitors who do not engage in 
such practices.

Section 9: Valuation and Target Price 
 


Valuing SAL is a difficult task because we are given so little information about related party entities, 
which undoubtedly are an important variable. Without knowing the true profitability of the whole 
Silverlake Group and all of the liabilities which may be hidden off balance sheet, we can only make an 
educated estimate. However we think our valuation framework is conservative, and risks are skewed to 
the downside. 


We arrive at a target price of S$0.29, which represents 65% downside from the current stock price 
(Exhibit 20). We arrive at this by applying the peer average Price to Sales ratio, multiplied by SAL’s non-
related party revenue. We also assume a value of S$67 million for SAL’s 20.25% stake in Global Infotech 
Co, Ltd which is listed on China’s Shenzhen exchange14. 


 
                                                           
14 We value SAL’s stake in Global Infotech at 22x trailing earnings, in-line with the average P/E multiple for Indian IT 
service companies and in-line with Global Infotech’s IPO price. This is a steep discount to the current market price, 
which equates to 109x trailing twelve month P/E. We believe the current price is inflated by the small-cap 
technology bubble in the Chinese market. SAL is not allowed to dispose of its stake for 36 months from the IPO 
date in May 2015, after which a maximum of 25% of the holding can be disposed in any six month period. 
Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that SAL will be able to dispose the stake anywhere near today’s inflated price.

We stress that we believe our target price uses very generous and conservative assumptions, in light of 
the numerous red flags uncovered. We wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the stock is ultimately 
worthless, if the total contingent liabilities are even more significant than the cases we identified. We 
don’t recommend owning SAL at any price, even one lower than our arrived at target price. We have 
shown how Goh has systematically deceived and defrauded minority shareholders numerous times. 
With Goh in control of SAL, we doubt that minority shareholders will generate any net returns over 
time, apart from lucky timing or short-term trading in the stock. Likewise we also doubt that SAL would 
have much value to an acquirer because of the ongoing related party transactions and key man risk. 
Investors would be wise to avoid owning the stock at any price.

Appendix 7: Silverlake Component Technology Solutions & ILOG Press Release 
 


KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, March 25, 2003 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- 


Silverlake Component Technology Solutions Sdn Bhd (Silverlake ComTech) and ILOG(R) (Nasdaq: ILOG; Euronext: SICOVAM: 
006673), the world's leading provider of enterprise-class software components, today announced the deployment of the 
Intelligent Crew Management System (iCMS) for Malaysia Airlines, which is expected to help this leading international airline 
more efficiently plan and optimize their manpower utilization and obtain cost savings and productivity improvements. 


iCMS, the latest addition to Silverlake ComTech's suite of crew management products, leverages ILOG's award-winning 
optimization products in two modules. The Crew Pairing Optimization (CPO) module utilizes ILOG CPLEX(R) and ILOG Solver(TM) 
optimization components to ensure compliance among airline regulations, trade union agreements and company policies. 
Using this module, Malaysia Airlines can improve decision making, thereby minimizing the costs associated with crew 
accommodations and transportation, regardless of the city or "hub" in which they are located. CPO also allows Malaysia Airlines 
to efficiently plan and optimize manpower utilization and activities associated with long-term planning and daily operations. 


The Crew Duty Assignment (CDA) module uses ILOG CPLEX and ILOG Solver optimization components as the main building 
blocks of the system, providing automatic assignment of duties to all flight crews. The system considers work rules, regulatory 
requirements as well as crew requests to produce an optimal monthly crew roster. 


"We are genuinely pleased to have selected iCMS for effective in-flight crew planning, rostering and tracking to optimize crew 
productivity," said Captain Ooi Teong Siew, Chief Pilot of Standard & Method Flight Operations, Malaysia Airlines. "The 
implementation of iCMS was almost immediately followed by increased productivity, higher quality of service and improved 
quality of life for ground personnel. With this system in place, we feel poised to take on the challenges of the operating rules, 
regulations or airline processes. It is necessary for one to maintain its competitive edge and be able to anticipate any changes 
which can directly impact bottom line." 


"We recognize the critical factors for success in a dynamic and competitive environment," said Chee Chin Leong, CEO, Silverlake 
ComTech. "One such factor is ensuring that the ground and flight crews are effectively managed and optimized to reduce costs 
and increase efficiency. Our iCMS solution, using ILOG technology, ensures airline business rules such as aviation regulations, 
union contractual rules, company policy, humane rules are covered end-to-end from a business perspective."
