Below is Part II of our EBIX report. Please also see part one.


5) Potentially Illegal Tax Strategy and Impact on Earnings and
Valuation


The most disturbing assumption we used in the ADAM accretion assumptions is the
zero percent tax rate. NASDAQ:EBIX has been a profitable company for 10 years and
acquired another company that was profitable. Both companies generate a majority of
their revenue in the United States (75% for EBIX and 100% for ADAM). How could it be
possible that EBIX will not pay income taxes in the United States? In researching the
topic, we found a disturbing explanation which, if changed, could dramatically alter the
economics of EBIX's business, significantly impair its earnings expectations, and
possibly subject the company to significant fines, penalties and back taxes.

Further, we believe aspects of EBIX's tax provision do not conform to GAAP and could
result in a restatement (if the company had an auditor with the resources to scrutinize
this accounting treatment). Since 2002, EBIX has provisioned $5 million in GAAP taxes
in total, despite being profitable from a GAAP perspective each quarter. We find this
discrepancy alarming. Below we highlight some prominent U.S. technology companies
with meaningful international operations and their most recent tax rates.

EBIX utilizes two strategies to reduce their taxes. The first is the utilization of an NOL
and a valuation allowance against their deferred tax asset. A valuation allowance
against a deferred tax asset is used when a company is unprofitable and the deferred
tax asset may not be used in the future. Until December 31, 2009, the company
maintained a full valuation allowance against their deferred tax asset. This implied that
they would never generate enough profits in the future to utilize the NOL.


This allowed the company to maintain a zero percent GAAP tax rate, as taxable income
was reduced by the release of the valuation allowance. In its 2009 10-k, management
justified the valuation allowance "due to uncertainties related to the potential adverse
impact to our health benefits exchange operating segment associated with recently
passed health care legislation."

For a company that had been profitable for 32 straight quarters with 35% "reported"
operating margins for 13 straight quarters, this was an absurd argument. At December
31, 2010, EBIX maintained a $6.6 million valuation allowance (all tied to acquired
businesses) after releasing $2.3 million in the fourth quarter 2010. We believe that the
valuation allowance should have been reversed years ago and this accounting
treatment suggests a lack of oversight from auditors and possible earnings
manipulation.


The second strategy to reduce the tax obligation: EBIX utilizes a controversial transfer
tax strategy to shift U.S. income to India and Singapore. Singapore represents just 3%
of their revenue, 27 employees, and only $271,000 of fixed assets. The only meaningful
asset is $135 million of goodwill and intangible assets (58% of total). In India, they
generate no revenue, have only $3.1 million of fixed assets, and 530 employees (45% of
total).

Despite generating 75% of revenue in the United States from mainly U.S.-domiciled
companies, and minimal revenue from India and Singapore, EBIX has tried
(successfully to date) to utilize a questionable loophole to reduce its tax obligation.
Through a transfer tax mechanism, EBIX has shifted most of its U.S. income to its
foreign operations. Through a series of transactions, EBIX transferred their "intellectual
property ownership…into our Singapore and India subsidiaries." EBIX then utilizes
foreign tax holidays to reduce tax obligations in these foreign operations. As table 10
suggests (from the company's 10-k), they have been successful in transferring most of
their domestic revenue into foreign earnings.


Through this superficial series of transactions that pose no business purpose other than
to avoid U.S. taxes, EBIX was able to generate a 140% operating margin in 2010 in its
foreign operations. EBIX's foreign operation is the Rumpelstiltskin of finance, turning a
$1 of revenue into $1.40 of profits. If the transactions are declared a sham, EBIX will
face significant fines, penalties and back taxes. EBIX has generated almost $150 million
of pretax earnings in the past five years. At a 35% tax rate, this could equate to over $51
million in back taxes prior to interest penalties or fines.

This aggressive tax treatment is similar to KPMG's tax shelter fraud scandal several
years ago. The aggressive strategy pitched by the Big Four accounting firm resulted in a
criminal conspiracy charge against KPMG and resulted in 19 indictments of criminal tax
fraud, criminal conspiracy, and tax evasion. Another Big Four firm, E&Y helped EBIX
concoct the current strategy. This is a strategy that any U.S. company could pursue if
they had operations abroad and wanted to avoid paying taxes.


Given the precarious debt situation in the United States, the IRS and politicians are
increasingly focused on companies like EBIX that enjoy all the benefits of the U.S.'s vast
corporate wealth, stable regulatory environment and resources, but find loopholes to
avoid or reduce taxes. This attitude was front and center in President Obama's State of
the Union speech on January 25, 2011, where he said:


Over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular
companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can
end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate
tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change. So tonight, I'm asking
Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system. Get rid of the loopholes. Level
the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time
in 25 years – without adding to our deficit.


The President might as well have been directing his comments to Robin Raina and
EBIX. Following the President's comments, Republican Dave Camp, the Chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed cutting the corporate tax rate by
"reducing or eliminating tax deductions and credits." A Democratic proposal aims to
"end special tax breaks favoring certain business sectors and repeal a rule that allows
companies to defer taxes on income earned abroad."


To this point, buried in its 10-k, EBIX disclosed that in the fourth quarter 2010 it took a
"charge to increase the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax filing positions as
evaluated by management." It appears that management may be acknowledging that its
current tax situation is unsustainable.

Companies with low but unsustainable tax rates have historically traded at low multiples
as the market adjusts their "E" in the price to earnings calculation. An example of this is
Bermuda reinsurance companies, who trade at roughly 6x earnings under the
assumption that their tax free status is unlikely to continue into perpetuity. EBIX
recorded a 1.1% tax rate in 2010 and analysts appear to be modeling a 10% rate in
2011. A less favorable tax situation going forward dramatically changes the earnings
profile, free cash flow and valuation of the company. Adjusting EBIX 2010 operating
results for a 35% tax rate reduces earnings to $0.90 per share.


6) Free Cash Flow Myth


As a serial acquirer, EBIX free cash flow is not representative unless cash costs of
acquisitions are included. EBIX needs acquisitions or the house of cards collapses. Roll-
ups artificially increase free cash flow as they report significantly less cash research and
development costs, which are recognized as an amortization expense and a cost of
acquisition. In EBIX's case, this cash flow shows up in the cash flow of investing section
of the income statement, not cash flow from operations.


If EBIX had to develop these products internally, this expense would come out of
operating cash flow and significantly reduce free cash flow. This is one of the reasons
EBIX only spends 10% of its revenues on R&D. EBIX's questionable tax strategy also
distorts this figure. We estimate that EBIX's free cash flow was $33 million in 2010 at a
35% tax rate, implying over 60% downside to get to a more normalized low-teens
multiple to free cash flow. We estimate its free cash flow was $25 million adjusted for a
more normalized sales and R&D expense, implying over 70% downside.

FCF / EV multiple 37.3x


7) Significant Quality of Earnings Issues


EBIX appears to manage earnings through a number of various accounting tricks that
reduces the quality of earnings. Over the past six quarters, the company's accounts
receivables growth has exceeded its revenue growth by over 30% on average.


Table 12 - Accounts Receivable


9/30/09 12/31/09 3/31/10 6/30/10 9/30/10 12/31/10


Revenue growth - yoy 15.5% 55.4% 52.9% 43.6% 42.9% 12.1%


Gross A/R growth - yoy 30.4% 68.6% 63.5% 48.8% 54.4% 13.9%


Source: company filings


In the past, EBIX management has defended the problems with accounts receivable by
focusing on aging. We would point out regardless of collection vintages, earnings
appear to be managed through accounts receivables. As an example, in the third
quarter of 2010, revenue increased only $1 million sequentially (despite the benefit of
two new acquisitions and two that closed late in the second quarter). Accounts
receivable increased over $4 million during that same period.


EBIX would have materially missed revenue and earnings estimates if it were not for this
dramatic growth in accounts receivable and $3 million of net "cashless" revenue.
Unsurprisingly, this data point received little scrutiny from the company's sell side
analysts (who are all recommending the shares).


EBIX has experienced significant volatility in its allowance for doubtful accounts, another
tool to distort the timing and quality of earnings. Despite the unrelenting growth in
accounts receivable, EBIX has just recently started to increase its allowance.

Another earnings quality issue with EBIX is the large amount of goodwill and intangibles
that does not flow through the income statement. For most roll-ups, amortization of
intangibles is one of the largest expense items on the income statement. In 2010, EBIX
amortized less than $3.8 million of intangibles, or only 2.8% of revenue. EBIX allocates
a significant percentage of its acquisition price to goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangibles, which are not amortized.


About 90% of EBIX's goodwill and intangibles are classified as permanent. A shockingly
low percentage is allocated to amortizable intangibles like customer relationships,
developed technology, and trademarks. This is highly unusual for technology companies
as advancements in technology make it nearly impossible to classify a contract,
technology, trademark or customer relationship as indefinite (and able to contribute to
cash flows into perpetuity), especially in highly competitive industries. This is highly
suspicious and points again to a lack of oversight by the company's auditors with
purchase price allocations and the desire to overstate earnings through lower
amortization.

In 2010, EBIX benefited from a number of low quality and unsustainable earnings
drivers that will make earnings comparisons difficult. For example, a change in fair value
of a put option granted to the aforementioned E-Z Data acquisition benefited earnings
by $0.15 ($6 million on the cash flow statement on 12/31/2010). This benefit was only
prominently highlighted in the third quarter 2010. Foreign exchange gains also added
$1.9 million in 2010, or roughly $0.04 per share. We have no doubt that EBIX will detail
one-time expenses in the future as they become an earnings headwind.


Please see Part III for additional research and our conclusion.
