SinoCoking: Promoted Chinese Reverse Merger Near Bankruptcy,
-81.9% Downside, Strong Sell
Sep. 22, 2014 12:01 PM ET38 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


SCOK temporarily benefiting from stock promotion by paid IR firm aimed at Chinese
“social media website” investors.


SCOK near insolvency with questionable auditor and CFO turnover while company
financials continue to have "material weakness" as executives conclude disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective.


My research shows SCOK “technology” claims are clearly not viable and without
value.


SCOK already high leverage while actively pursuing more debt creates high
bankruptcy risk and total wipeout potential for shareholders.


Even assuming management is credible with viable technology and can avoid
bankruptcy, stock valuation appears impossibly inflated leaving -81.9% downside
from current trading prices.


I believe SinoCoking (TICKER: SCOK) is one of the most dangerous stocks I have ever
seen as the number of red flags is simply overwhelming. This Chinese reverse merger is
tied to many people accused of fraud while it has been teetering on the edge of
bankruptcy with missed interest payments and a "going concern" statement from their
auditor. Furthermore, recent CFO turnover and a new audit firm all while internal controls
have "material weaknesses" and the company states it did "not have sufficient skilled
accounting personnel" all make me very concerned.

SCOK stock has temporarily benefited from paid stock promotion from a paid IR firm
called "Asia IR-PR" which apparently targets Chinese citizens on "social media websites."
Asia IR's four other clients include 2 Chinese companies accused of fraud, one of which is

currently halted by NASDAQ.


SCOK's latest rally seems to be based off the announcement SCOK will come up with
over $300m to build an underground coal gasification project based on a vague
partnership with some Chinese academic institutions. My research indicates this project
and technology are clearly unviable and worthless.


Now that Asia IR's Chinese "social media" stock promotion campaign appears to have run
its course and SCOK's latest equity raise has been completed, I expect the logical
progression involves the continued implosion of SCOK's stock price. As whatever
unsophisticated investors bought SCOK realize what is truly going on here I expect SCOK
stock price to continue imploding back to its pre-promotion stock price of ~$1. I believe a
P/E of >90 makes no sense for a nearly insolvent coal company with its mines shut down
by the government hyping an unviable project. Longer-term I expect that SCOK will go
bankrupt leaving (bag) shareholders without even the bag - this view is based on the
company's guidance for hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental debt financing on an
incredibly complex and untested project.


Read on for in depth research all cited with links and documents.


Research Indicates SCOK Technology Claims Are Clearly Unviable and Worthless


The latest hype that has driven SCOK stock is the promise of an "underground coal
gasification" (UCG) and syngas project. Underground Coal Gasification involves drilling
holes into coal seams as much as a mile deep then lighting them on fire and capturing
"syngas", a product with half the inherent energy of natural gas. Since SCOK's coal mines
have been shut down by the government due to environmental concerns, the idea is this
new UCG concept can seal the Co2 in the ground forever, allowing SCOK to produce
syngas and be environmentally safe. My research indicates this is an unviable pipe dream
not based in reality.


I believe there are three obvious reasons why SCOK's technology is unviable and
worthless:


FIRST: SCOK's Coal Gasification project seems to be based entirely on this vague deal
with two Chinese institutions, both of which appears to be academic.


The two listed SCOK partners are "North China Institute of Science and Technology"
and "the Institute of Process Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences."
However when I researched deeper into these two organizations, and any

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2512495-sinocoking-promoted-chinese-reverse-merger-near-bankruptcy-minus-81_9-percent-downside-strong-sell 3/


Underground Coal Gasification technology they might have, what I found was (not)
surprising…
SCOK provides virtually zero technology details so we are forced to be creative here to
try and understand what is going on.


A search on Institute of Process Engineering for "Underground Coal Gasification"
yields zero results. Broadening the search to "Coal Gasification" yields only 6
responses and it is not clear to me if any of them are directly regarding Underground
Coal Gasification.

Taking the authors from what looks to me to be the most relevant research article and
plugging them into Google Book yields only three relevant references, two of which are

listed as "experimental."
The other organization, The North China Institute, appears to be a simple, moderate
sized university near Beijing. Searching this website, I found no evidence of any
commercial applications of underground coal gasification or any references to coal
gasification in general.


As far as I can tell this is an experimental technology with no commercial history provided
by some Chinese colleges with no obvious experience in this commercial UCG. I could not
even find evidence of any past pilot in SCOK's area done by either of these academic
organizations so it is not even clear to me if this "technology" has ever been applied or
tested in any way? Perhaps I missed a pilot based on their technology in SCOK's
geography? If there has even been any relevant trial at any point in time I would hope
SCOK disclosed this to investors already.


With no commercial experience, how do you believe SCOK can accurately estimate a
timeline, gross margins or cost for deploying this? Most importantly, SCOK claims to now
be a "leading producer of clean energy" to "alleviate the pressing air pollution and global
warming problems" yet I find zero explanation of how they plan to control Co2 or other
harmful pollution. SCOK plans to "invest" nearly $300m on this?


SECOND: Even if you assume these curious Chinese academic institutions partnered with
SCOK have viable UCG technology, the largest, and only, operating commercial UCG
project in the world was recently valued at just $2.5m. This large scale commercial project
is in Uzbekistan and called "Yerostigaz." This project has been in production for decades
with teams of engineers involved. In 10/2007, (top of the market) a public company in
Australia called Linc Energy purchased a controlling stake, which valued the entire
operation at less than $2.5m and only was willing to pay $487k in cash.


(from Linc Energy website)


While disclosure is limited, Linc's 2008 financial reports state this project lost $193k on
$121k in revenue making it deeply unviable. Note that Linc's annual reports also state part
of their intention to acquire this stake in this project was to prevent competitors from
getting involved, and this was done in 2007 when valuations globally were very high, so I
assume Linc likely over paid for this asset despite the minimal value ascribed. Perhaps
most concerning, the area around the Yerostigaz project appears to be an environmental

disaster where people seem plagued with cancer and disease. These look to me to be the
exact problems the Chinese government has been seeking to avoid when they shut down
coal mines. Apparently, SCOK thinks they can profitably scale a project ultimately many
times larger, based on questionable academic research, in less than six months without
issues when the only large commercial operation in the world seems to hemorrhage cash.


THIRD: Public company Synthesis Energy (TICKER: SYMX) is already in China using a
simpler and more established syngas process while apparently producing a higher value
add product than syngas and is still unviable with -$165m in losses over more than 10
years.


(from SYMX investor presentation)


Despite using simpler and proven above-ground coal gasification process SYMX appears
to have never been a viable business with persistent and cumulative losses since
inception of -$165m!

(from SEC.gov)


Despite having $20m in cash, proven technology currently in operation with global
partners (like GE) producing higher grade products with an easier and proven syngas
process, SYMX has a market cap roughly half of SCOK, indicating that if SCOK was
valued similarly to this apparently superior peer, SCOK has -50% downside. If you
insist on speculating on Chinese syngas long shots, I believe SYMX is obviously a
superior choice to SCOK.


There are a few key reasons, aside from SCOK issues, why UCG has never been
successfully implemented anywhere in the world outside of Uzbekistan (not known for
strict environmental regulations) and even there it appears to be deeply unprofitable.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2512495-sinocoking-promoted-chinese-reverse-merger-near-bankruptcy-minus-81_9-percent-downside-strong-sell 7/


First, the reality is Syngas has less than half the energy value of natural gas so comparing
it directly to LNG or natural gas is not accurate. This non-comparable amount of inherent
energy also make speculation about the economics of SynGas from underground coal
highly questionable.


Second, UCG seems to only be viable in very limited locations. Only very specific coal
beds are even viable sites for potential UCG application. The thickness of the seam, its
angle, its depth and the makeup and thickness of the rock as well as its distance from
major geological faults, rivers, lakes, mines, and cities are all crucial concerns if a project
is even viable. It's not as if every site or all of any site may be viable UCG projects.


Perhaps more importantly, the environmental concerns are severe and if this is done
improperly it can cause massive sink holes and pollute the water tables. China is already
lacking in clean water. This is not some environmentalist scare tactics either, a UCG
project in Australia was recently shut down permanently after it showed excessive levels
of Benzene in the ground water. Two pilot projects in the US also indicated likely
groundwater contamination as well according to this study. The UCG Hoe Creek study in
Wyoming in the US also contaminated groundwater with carcinogens.


Meanwhile the cost to produce natural gas is on a relentless and steep decline, creating
continued competition for UCG that has not gone well for UCG advocates. If UCG was so
economical why were large projects apparently shut down in Russia in 1996? In the late
1990s, Russia was not exactly a country known for its environmental focus and coal was
virtually free, yet the economics of UCG were still unviable?


Third, the environmental impacts of UCG are not proven while many experts believe it is
quite dangerous environmentally and worse than fracking.


The situation is further complicated by emissions generated from the UCG process itself,
which occurs prior to any implementation of CCS technology. According to Grantham
Research Institute on Climate Change Professor Michael Jacobs:


If you inject the CO  into the place where the coal has come from, you only have
room for 30% of it. Therefore 70% of the coal emissions would enter the
atmosphere, which still makes it more polluting than conventional gas.


David Camp from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has been quoted as stating
that deepwater drilling and fracking are easier and more cost effective than UCG.

(from BBC)


Commercial underground coal gasification has never been done successfully in any
environmentally stringent country. The only place even attempting this commercially is a
single site in the remarkable country of Uzbekistan, which as far as I can tell, has nearly
zero environmental regulations about Co2 from their UCG project.


I could go on but it's not necessary. SCOK's claim to any technology is questionable and
seems tied to academic institutions with no proven experience commercializing UCG
technology. Even if you choose to ignore this, the only commercial scale UCG project on
the planet seems to burn cash and was valued at less than $4m while a more credible
company in China is using a proven syngas process to generate a more valuable product
is still totally unviable with -$165m in losses. Lastly, I believe it is clear that UCG's
environmental claims (the entire justification for SCOK's project) are dubious at best with a
history of contaminating water with carcinogens. Most alarming, SCOK has outlined a
timeline of less than 6 months to production, which appears practically impossible in my
view and leaves very little time for any pre-analysis of the environment or drinking water.


Paid IR Firm Promoting SCOK Stock Involved With Companies Accused of Fraud:


Perhaps the only thing more questionable than SCOK's technology claims are the paid IR
firm they use. It appears the recent (temporary) move in SCOK from $1 to $4.50+ is based
on the involvement of a questionable Chinese IR firm that apparently touts their client's
stocks to Chinese citizens on social media sites.


(source: from Asia IR website)


Asia IR-PR is a paid firm offering "investor relations" to promote Chinese and Asian
companies. Asia IR shows only 5 clients on its website, two of which have been accused
of fraud, one of which is still halted by the NASDAQ.

The CEO of Asia IR is Ronald S. Altbach whose bio states he was CEO and Chairman of
Cross Media Marketing Corporation from 1998-2003. It seems the FTC and DOJ charged
the company and then ordered CMM to pay a $1.1m civil penalty for allegations including
violations of federal law and "misrepresenting the costs and conditions of packages."


Ronald Altbach also became Chairman of BLBK in May 2012. Below is the stock price
chart of BLBK, which declined -99% since 2012.

In this article, Asia IR claims that its young social media expert began using Chinese
Social Media which resulted in SCOK's stock moving from $1 up to $3 where this nearly
insolvent coal company was valued at a 70 P/E multiple! Below we can see a long-term
chart of SCOK's P/E and see the recent distortion. Upon SCOK reversion to previous P/E
valuation, SCOK should easily fall 81% from here.

Let's look at Asia IR's current listed clients to see if there may be a pattern we can
decipher in order to understand what typically happens to their clients:


1. China Commercial Credit (TICKER: CCCR) listed client of Asia IR-PR


CCCR's stock has fallen -78% from $14 in 2013 to $2.98 before the NASDAQ halted
trading and fraud allegations began.
CCCR stock was halted at $2.98 by NASDAQ on 9/11/2014 for "additional information

There are allegations that money was transferred out of the account of the company's
wholly owned subsidiary into the personal account of a former Executive Officer of the
Company.
CCCR is also being sued by shareholders as of 8/6/2014 with allegations of "deceiving
the investing public" and "employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud."
"Defendants ((A)) employed devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud; ((B)) made
untrue statements of material fact and/or omitted to state material facts necessary to

"During the Class Period, Defendants carried out a plan, scheme and course of

investing public,"
It appears "Regeneration Capital Group" also assisted in CCCR's IPO with a team of
accountants to examine the risk management of CCCR's Loan portfolio. Ronald S.

BOPH is a tiny, illiquid stock, which trades on the OTC and claims to be "engaged in

SCOK Says It Will Fund Project With Cash Flows, Then Announces "Surprise"
Overnight Equity Raise


With SCOK stock trading at an extreme valuation with paid stock promotion, it seems to
me, the predictable next step was an urgent capital raise, which appears to directly
contradict previous SCOK management commentary. This equity raise also appears to
have caught SCOK shareholders completely by surprise judging by SCOK's immediate
stock price implosion.

"The first phase of this project, which will cost approximately $18m and be funded
primarily from SinoCoking's operating cash flows and reserves"


Then just 9 days later on 9/18/14 SCOK management announces an equity offering of
nearly 6m shares...


How can you trust anything these people say?


What kind of company does an equity offering on a Wednesday evening anyway?! Is
SCOK's financial situation that urgent or did SCOK feel their stock price is unlikely to
remain elevated? Did SCOK and management decide to sell a huge amount of stock
because they felt the stock was undervalued? Did SCOK sell all this equity and dilute
shareholders on a Wednesday evening because they feel cash flow is about to experience
a dramatic turnaround? These are important questions you need to understand if you own
SCOK.


Since the latest equity offering appears to me to be totally insufficient for SCOK's plans,
will you see another equity offering coming or will that be a surprise and inflict further
crippling losses on shareholders? SCOK states they expect to need $280m+ which seems
extreme versus the current $90m market cap. If even a small part of this is funded with
equity, SCOK stock will get diluted into oblivion.


SCOK Near Bankruptcy: Recent Capital Raise Appears Insufficient


Even with the latest surprising, dilutive equity raise, I believe there is very real bankruptcy
risk at SCOK. So even if you ignore the questionable cast of people involved in SCOK, the
auditor, the CFO and financial statement "material weakness" red flags, or that the
technology seems unviable (or any of the other many risks here), SCOK is still extremely
leveraged making the stock vulnerable to complete wipeout and bankruptcy risk.
Furthermore, any commentary about adding even more debt to this unsustainable balance
sheet looks both not possible and incredibly dangerous to me.


The core issue at SCOK is earnings have imploded and not recovered. As a result,
SCOK's ability to service their debt has become hampered. We can see from the chart
below that SCOK carries debt that is approximately 7x larger than their annual EBITDA
(as the chart goes up the leverage goes up). Note that this calculation, to be generous to
SCOK, uses EBITDA, which ignores the financial impact of SCOK's hard assets being
worn out through use. Of course for SCOK depreciation is a very real expense over time,
which will only make this debt situation more impossible.

coverage declines). This is likely why SCOK apparently could not pay their last interest
payments and had to negotiate with the banks to avoid default and bankruptcy. If this
Underground Coal Gasification project should hit any snags, delays or problems I believe
it is obvious there is a high probability of bankruptcy and immediate shareholder wipeout.


(chart built by me using public data from SEC filings)


It seems to me the only way SCOK shareholders have avoided being wiped out in
bankruptcy already is by the sheer generosity of the lender who (for now) agreed to allow
SCOK a grace period after failing to make their quarterly interest payment of just $2.12m
which was due nearly 6 months ago.

What would have happened to SCOK stock had the bank instead requested immediate
deposit of this millions of dollars of contractually agreed upon payment?

Does this look like the financial profile of a company that can safely take on more debt? A
company with internal "material weaknesses," and both auditor and CFO turnover while
missing interest payments?


With this financial picture in mind I find this press release from SCOK to be comical:


(source: SCOK sec filing)


Ignoring the fact that I can't imagine any bank will shell out nearly $300m in debt against
an unprecedented project apparently based on academic research, I don't see how SCOK
thinks they can take on $280m+ more debt when they can't even afford the debt $50m in
debt they currently have?


Also note that I estimate SCOK's proposed production in the final phase is many times
higher than the only other commercial UCG project in the world. Even though they have
no experience operating a commercial scale UCG project and are using technology that
apparently requires "refining" SCOK believes they can scale this to production in less than
6 months. Given the extreme debt and leverage at hand here there is virtually no room for
error or bankruptcy could occur.


Given cash is low, debt is high and the company has very high upcoming capital needs,
what do you think the company will do if the stock remains at the current inflated price?
Will they take advantage and simply issue more equity?


The last equity raise diluted shareholders without notice and sent the stock into an
immediate nose dive. Will you be able to see the next equity raise coming?


Meanwhile SCOK is telling investors they can finance, build and operate this nearly
unprecedented project, based on some questionable academic work, to be in full
operation in less than 6 months.


SCOK "Ecosystem" of People Involved: Fraud Allegations, Money Laundering,
Sanctions and Fines


In case all the red flags above weren't enough, the story of SCOK actually gets much
worse. I always find it instructive to analyze the "ecosystem" of people involved in a
company to understand the character and incentives of those working behind the scenes
with my investments. Remember that as an investor you are partnering with these people.

First of all, SCOK is another China reverse merger with a complicated ownership structure
(buyer beware).


(Source: SCOK 2010 Investor Presentation)


This issue has already been covered by Citron, and I don't see any reason to recreate the
wheel. Quoting Citron directly:


On July 6, 2009, Mr. Jianhua Lv [SCOK's CEO] transferred his shares of Top Favour
[see above] to Honour Express Limited, a British Virgin Islands international
business company which is solely owned by Mr. Shaohua Tan, a Singapore citizen.
Mr. Shaohua Tan appears to be a penny stock jockey with filings in GHII, JGBO and
LTUS. He operates BVI holding companies out of Singapore with names like "Top
Favour" and "Honour Express."


Mr. Tan apparently has a record of involvement in stocks that essentially go to zero,
resulting in nearly total shareholder wipeout. Let's provide some updated charts (Citron's
report was published in 2010 and these stocks have done worse since then despite
significant market advances).


Tan was involved in Gold Horse International (NYSE:GHII) - yes, that's basically a
zero:

SCOK's Auditor Turnover Makes Me Scared


But wait, it gets better. SCOK recently changed auditors to HHC CPA, an auditor that
seems to specialize in representing small public Chinese companies that get wiped out.


Let's look at some clients of SCOK's auditor HHC CPA to see if we can decipher a pattern
of how this story ends:


How about Big Tree Group? (OTCPK:BIGG) That's nearly a zero.

Given this track record, why would any legitimate company tie up with Shaohua Tan and
use HHC CPA as their auditor?


Unfortunately for SCOK shareholders, it only gets worse from there. As Sharesleuth
reported in 2010, a shockingly high number of people involved with SCOK have been
accused of fraud or other questionable issues in the past. Below I quote Sharesleuth's
amazing work:


Sharesleuth took a closer look at the registration statement covering the resale of
those shares, and found that no fewer than eight people who participated in the
placement have been the subject of Securities and Exchange Commission actions
or criminal prosecutions.


The list includes at least four people who were directly or indirectly linked to stock-
manipulation schemes. Several other investors were previously involved in a small
cluster of U.S. companies whose placements were manipulated by a ring of boiler
room brokerages in the 1990s.


I would encourage all SCOK shareholders or potential investors to read the full
Sharesleuth report here, but in the mean time I will specifically call out two of the eight
people subject to SEC actions or criminal prosecutions:

Kenneth A. Orr [remember this name, more below], who faced both civil and criminal
charges in connection with a stock-promotion scheme in which brokers were paid
kickbacks for selling shares of certain companies. The SEC alleged that Orr took
payments to sell shares of two of the companies. Orr neither admitted nor denied the
charges, but allowed the entry of a permanent injunction against him in 2002,
prohibiting future violations of securities laws. He was ordered to pay $154,000 in
disgorgement, penalties and interest. Orr also pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of
conspiracy to launder money. He was sentenced to probation and fined $3,000.
Lawrence E. Kaplan, former president of G-V Capital Corp., [remember this name,
more below] which as a company pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges in 2004 in
connection with a broader manipulation scheme by several brokerages, including
Walsh Manning Securities Inc. and J.B. Sutton Group LLC. In addition to his role at G-
V Capital, Kaplan was a director of one of the companies whose shares were
manipulated, and later joined the board of another. Kaplan also was accused
personally of fraud charges, but federal prosecutors dismissed their case against him
in 2007.


Quoting Sharesleuth again (all sections below in quotations are from Sharesleuth):


When looking into the histories of the private placement participants, Sharesleuth
discovered that Kaplan, Orr and several others listed in SinoCoking's filings
previously invested alongside one another in the companies that G-V Capital and
Walsh Manning used in their frauds, which ran from 1995 to 1998."


[Kaplan and Orr: remember these guys from the section above?]


Prosecutors said Frank J. Skelly and Craig Gross, the principals of Walsh Manning,
orchestrated a pump-and-dump scheme that artificially inflated the shares of at least
four companies: Brake Headquarters Inc., Multimedia Games Inc., American
Healthchoice Inc., and Jenna Lane Inc. Skelly and Gross were convicted of
securities fraud and other charges in October 2004, and got matching 57-month
prison terms.


Kaplan's company, G-V Capital handled stock or debt placements for all four
companies, and he got shares in each of them. Walsh Manning arranged additional
placements for some of the companies.

SEC filings show that, in each placement, a large block of shares went to an entity
secretly controlled by Kenneth S. Greene, a former principal at Stratton Oakmont
Inc., one of the most notorious boiler room brokerages of the 1990s. The SEC had
barred Greene from the securities business in 1994 and ordered him to pay a
$100,000 fine in connection with Stratton Oakmont's activities.


Orr [remember this guy from the section above?], was one of the participants in
the G-V Capital and Walsh Manning placements, buying shares in Brake
Headquarters and Multimedia Games."


Stratton Oakmont, that sounds familiar… I almost feel like I've seen this movie before…
oh wait, I have seen this movie, it was called Wolf of Wall Street! Prior investors in the
SCOK deal have direct ties to Stratton Oakmont, the real life Wolf of Wall Street firm.


For those who haven't seen the Wolf of Wall Street movie, this basically sums it up:

SCOK'S CEO and CFO Believe Company's Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Have "Material Weakness"


If all of the above wasn't worrisome enough, it appears that the integrity of SCOK's
accounting and financial reporting is also questionable as SCOK management themselves
have concluded that the Company continues to have the following material weakness in
its internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014.


In the latest SEC filed 10-Q (page 37):

We did not have sufficient skilled accounting personnel that are either qualified
as Certified Public Accountants in the United States or that have received education
from U.S. institutions or other educational programs that would provide adequate
relevant education relating to U.S. GAAP. The Company's Chief Financial Officer
and Controller have limited experience with U.S. GAAP and are not U.S.
Certified Public Accountants. Furthermore, our operating subsidiaries are based in
China and are therefore required to comply with PRC GAAP, rather than U.S. GAAP.
Thus, the accounting skills and understanding necessary to fulfill the
requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting, including the preparation of
consolidated financial statements, are inadequate, and determined to be a
material weakness.


We have not completed our internal control processes for some of our major cycles
and have not performed any testing on any of our internal controls


Based on their evaluation, and considering the material weaknesses and significant
deficiencies previously identified and discussed in our internal control over financial
reporting under Item 9A ("Controls and Procedures") in our Annual Report, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures at March 31, 2013 were not effective."


Given the spectacular blow ups in Chinese reverse mergers with questionable accounting
I do not recommend anyone invest in any company, ever, that has this kind of internal
accounting questions. Even more worrisome it appears these disclosures appeared in the
last two consecutive 10-Q filings so these issues have potentially been going on for some
time.


SCOK Stock Technically Breaking Down Now: Near-Term Downside with Long-Term
Bankruptcy


As you can see below, SCOK has convincingly broken prior support at $5.50 and is now
moving swiftly for the next level of support, which isn't until below $2.73. This leaves
tremendous near-term downside from a technical perspective as the stock round-trips the
recent move up from $1.31.

While some individuals may be excited about the latest move in SCOK stock, a look at the
longer-term chart shows that this stock has been a financial disaster for anyone owning
the stock for many years in a row.


(chart built by me with public information)


Generously Valuing SCOK: -80.6% Downside


I believe there is a high probability SCOK goes bankrupt as they spend the cash they just
raised on this unviable project and totally wipeout shareholders for -100% loss. However,
if you disagree with near-term bankruptcy, ignore the overwhelming amount of red flags
here from management quality to questionable financials and auditors or the other many
issues I've highlighted here, SCOK is still absurdly over valued and worth only a small
fraction of the current trading price at best. Using generous and optimistic valuation
metrics, I estimate SCOK is (at best) worth $0.83 per share, for -81% downside risk.


1. On an EV/EBIT multiple (since SCOK has no real earnings or cash flow) SCOK trades
at a ridiculous 14.5x (compared to Intel for example which trades at 12.3x).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2512495-sinocoking-promoted-chinese-reverse-merger-near-bankruptcy-minus-81_9-percent-downside-strong-sell 25


If (WHEN) SCOK reverts back to the previous valuation averages it had during the years
2011-2012 of 5-6x, that would value SCOK at ~$1.40 or lower.


2. ANR is one of the largest coal companies in the world and is currently trading at 0.2x
price to tangible book value. If SCOK were valued similarly to ANR (clearly very generous
to SCOK) I estimate that would value SCOK at $0.903 per share.


3. I believe near-term bankruptcy is the most likely outcome as SCOK's debt levels are
clearly unsustainable while management plans to not only spend the small amount of cash
they have but add more debt. In this scenario SCOK stock is obviously worth $0.00.


I believe bankruptcy is most likely but if I average these three valuations I get a price
target of $0.76 per share for SCOK. This is, perhaps not coincidentally, very similar to the
$0.83 price where SCOK was trading just four months ago except now, with the highly
dilutive equity raise, SCOK has more shares outstanding so the price per share at the
same valuation will have decreased.


Management and Asia IR-PR Response:


Eventually I was able to get in touch with SCOK's IR firm, Asia IR-PR, to get feedback
from the company's representative and their IR firm. I found it to be highly entertaining.
They stated SCOK's technology would be an "evolution" and highlighted the part of
SCOK's press release discussing "refine and implement" the Chinese academic based
technology. I find this unbelievable as SCOK plans to already spend $300m+ on a
technology they expect to have commercialized in less than 6 months that they still need
to "refine"? Furthermore, IR clarified that if SCOK's latest raise is not sufficient to pay the
missed interest expense, supply necessary working capital, and fund just phase 1 of the
proposed project (which it appears to me to be insufficient for), then SCOK could bridge
the cash flow difference with more debt. Since I am short the stock I was delighted to hear
this. When questioned about the details of SCOK's UCG technology or how/where C02
would be captured and stored, virtually no details were offered.


Conclusion: Price Target $0.76 per Share, -81.9% Downside


Even if you ignore all the questionable actors involved here and multiple fraud allegations
in the ecosystem of people surrounding SCOK, the technology appears obviously
worthless while even if it was viable, SCOK lacks the funding or expertise to execute such
a plan. Not to mention SCOK's proposed timeline of moving this untested technology into
full scale production in less than 6 months appears beyond unrealistic.
