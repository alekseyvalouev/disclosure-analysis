INTRODUCTION 
GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH first heard about MDC Partners early last year when MDCA was referred to as 
the “Valeant Pharmaceuticals of advertising agencies”. At the time, Valeant’s stock price had reached new 
all-time highs, leading many observers to believe that Valeant was a great company. Like Valeant, MDCA 
entered the public markets via reverse merger. Many low quality companies & outright frauds have 
historically entered the public markets via reverse merger. MDC Partner’s story and its accounting did not 
make much sense at the time, but we did not examine it more carefully until recently. On the one hand, 
MDCA boasts claims to generate industry-leading organic growth & solid EBITDA margins1: 


 
On the other hand, MDCA appears to be an exceptionally poor company, bleeding cash & issuing debt2: 


 
Gotham City Research has not seen such conflicting qualities in a company since Valeant and Quindell. 
We have come to believe that MDC Partners is, indeed, an exceptional company – for all the wrong 
reasons. The following specifically lead us to believe the shares are worth less than $1 per share:  


 MDCA’s true debt is understated by at least 23%. 
 2015 organic growth is ~1.5%, not the 7.1% figure the company reports. 
 Key executives are leaving, and growing evidence 72andSunny has peaked. 
 Pattern of deception and fraud among MDCA’s business partners and/or quasi-captive entities. 


Gotham City Research believes the days of MDC Partner’s misrepresentations are coming to an end. We 
anticipate that further evidence of malfeasance will be brought to light in the near future.

MDCA’s Unstable Business Model: Why it Can Fail Overnight 
One year ago, MDC Partners disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Soon after, Miles Nadal – MDCA’s founder & CEO (at the time) 
– left the company.1 MDC Partners and its enablers would have you believe that MDCA’s 
problems were limited to Miles Nadal’s improper spending of the Company’s resources. In fact, 
MDC Partners now claims it is committed to conducting business in accordance with the “highest 
standards of business ethics, and to full and accurate disclosure”2.  If that were true: 


 Why does MDCA remain under on-going SEC investigation? 
 Why do we find evidence MDCA continues to mask its deteriorating financial condition?  
 Why does MDCA continue to rely heavily on aggressive accounting (e.g. Non-GAAP 


and/or pro-forma accounting), even after Miles Nadal’s departure (see below)? 
Answer: MDCA’s Accounting Conceals an Unstable Business Model that can Fail Overnight 
Some companies provide Non-GAAP and/or pro forma figures so that their readers can better 
gauge the health of their underlying businesses. We do not believe that is the case with MDCA. In 
fact, we believe MDCA uses dubious accounting and business practices to confuse, rather than 
inform its audience. MDCA is a highly levered roll-up of (mostly) ad agencies, with understated 
debts, overstated profits, and overstated organic growth. MDCA can fail overnight, and its 
management tries to conceal its fragile business model.  
Gotham City Research believes MDCA is similar to other human capital-intensive businesses – 
e.g., law firms, investment banks, hedge funds –that have failed overnight, especially when laden 
with debt & aggressive accounting: 


 
How is MDCA different from the Above Businesses?  
Imagine a highly levered bank (or hedge fund) that overstates its returns, understates its current 
operating expenses, capitalizes its bonus payments owed to employees, and then understates the 
value of those debts. We believe that is MDCA, and that it can fail overnight (if not within weeks 
or months), just as many banks and funds have failed overnight.

How MDCA Overstates Earnings & Understates Debt: Quasi-captive Entities + Accounting 
We believe accounting staff within MDC Partners – Michael Sabatino and his crew –  worked 
along with quasi-captive intermediary(ies), (e.g., BDO and David Wiener Associates) so that 
MDCA could: 


 Overstate organic growth 
 Understate Deferred Acquisition Consideration-related debt 
 Overstate reported profits 
 Minimize taxes for all stakeholders, e.g. MDC Partners’ and its acquirees’ taxes 








Gotham City Research believes that the above scheme could theoretically continue indefinitely 
until or unless: 


 MDCA’s Growth disappears, or the company can’t paper over its deteriorating results. 
 MDCA incurs too much debt 
 Whistleblower(s) and/or regulator expose MDCA’s schemes. 


 
As it turns outs, Gotham City Research believes all three conditions above have been met within 
the last 12 months. We start by first exposing MDCA’s reported organic growth rate as a farce.

Organic Revenue Growth is ~1.4% not 7.1% as Claimed 
For highly acquisitive companies such as MDC Partners, organic growth is a very important 
measure to gauge the underlying health of their core businesses.  The shares of other acquisitive 
companies, such as Quindell and Valeant, have run into trouble when they sought to conceal the 
deterioration of their true organic growth rates. We find that MDCA meaningfully overstates its 
organic growth rate relative to its peers. On one hand, MDCA claims it is a growth company1: 





 
In reality, we believe MDCA is a low growth company. An independent calculation of organic 
growth leads to a 1.4% growth rate for 2015. Key executive departures, MDCA’s loss of clientele, 
and accounting irregularities –all are consistent with a low growth rate.
Page 9 of 40 
 


Organic growth Closer to 1.5% NOT 7.1% -  Well Below Its Peers’ 2.8% Average 
MDC Partners claims that 2015 organic growth was 7.1%, yet we find the number was 1.4%:2 


 
Perhaps the Company’s claim that its organic growth is 4x more than peers is a Freudian slip; in 
reality, MDCA’s reported organic growth of 7.1% is overstated by more than 4x. 
How we believe MDCA overstates organic growth: 


 MDCA Treats Some Acquired Revenue as Organic Revenue – MDCA’s claimed 
7.1%  organic growth rate is calculated by using an apple vs orange comparison. They 
take credit for a full years’ 2014 acquired revenue figure compared against a half years’ 
acquired revenue figure. This is an incorrect comparison. We include adjustment* factors 
so that the numbers are comparable (leading to comparable revenue**). 


 Discontinued operations – MDCA has historically dropped acquired companies whose 
revenues are declining, and then restate its overall financials as if they never owned these 
companies. Removing the discontinued operations’ revenue via restatement distorts the 
organic growth calculations, as it artificially inflates the organic growth calculation. 


Other Signs of Business Deterioration – Executive Departures, Loss of Clients, & More 
Recent executive departures, further support our belief that MDCA’s core operations are 
deteriorating. The departures would explain why MDCA overstates its organic growth: in reality, 
key talent is leaving and business is deteriorating, just as the whistleblower alleges. We discuss 
the executive departures in further detail later in the report, but here are some highlights3: 


 “72andSunny Veteran Grant Holland Joins Omelet L.A. as CCO” – September 17, 2015 
 Jeff Sweat founds ‘Mister Sweat’ leaving 72andSunny sometime September 2015 
 “McCann New York Re-hires Dan Donovan as Executive Creative Director” – August 31, 2015 
 “Andrew Keller Is Out at Crispin Porter + Bogusky After 5 Years as CEO” – August 19, 2015 
 “Evan Fry executive director of creative development.” – August 19, 2015 
 “ ‘Epic Split’ Creative [Martin] Ringqvist Leaves 72andSunny” – August 11, 2015 
 “President Steve Erich Leaves Crispin, Porter + Bogusky" – June 15, 2015 
 “Hey, Bob Winter Has Landed a New Gig as Well” – March 25, 2014 


Recall that Crispin Porter Bogursky used to be MDCA’s crown jewel. It has fallen sharply (and steadily) 
from its peak. Of its original 13 partners, we believe no more than 3 remain4. As we discuss later, Gotham 
City Research is seeing recent evidence that 72andSunny will decline as Crispin Porter did.

Loss of Key Clientele 
In December of last year, MDC Partners’ subsidiary, Doner, lost a long-time client5: 


“Cox Automotive has appointed Zambezi as the lead brand strategy and creative agency 
for its Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book brands following a competitive review. MDC's 
Doner has worked on the business for the last 16 years.” 


As executives and/or talented personnel leave, we anticipate deterioration in the quality of work 
provided to clients, and therefore, further loss of business. This happened to Crispin Porter 
Bogusky, formerly MDCA’s crown jewel. We see signs that this is taking place with 72andSunny 
as we discuss later in this report. 
Organic Growth Accounting Irregularities 
The true organic growth rate may even be worse than the 1.4% we calculated. The reported figures 
necessary to calculate organic growth may not be accurate nor reliable, as demonstrated by the 
following accounting irregularities6: 
2015 





 
 
The figures identified above in red – the $13.7 million and $46.3 million – are both from the 
2015 10K. Both are supposed to represent acquisition-related revenues for 2015, yet variance 
between the two figures is unexplained.
Page 11 of 40 
 


We find similar problems with the 2014 equivalent numbers7: 
2014 





 
 
Revenue-related Disclosures Have Worsened with “New” Management 
“It takes two to lie – one to lie, and one to listen.” – Homer Simpson  
Under the “new” management (we say “new” because CEO Scott Kauffman, is a long-time MDCA 
Board member and CFO David Doft is long-time CFO. all the Miles Nadal-related wrong-doing 
happened under both Kauffman and Doft’s watch) revenue disclosures have worsened: 


“Next, you will notice that beginning with this period, our financial statements now reflect 
one operating segment, which in turn equals one reportable segment. 
We will no longer be reporting results for Strategic Marketing Services and Performance 
Marketing Services.  
So, by no means, are we looking to reduce transparency. We actually think this will help 
enhance transparency, especially with a more cleaner breakout of corporate as an isolated 
item versus before.” 
CFO David Doft MDCA’s Q4 2015 earnings call8 


 
We believe that most people would refer CFO David Doft’s above statements, particularly the “we 
actually think this will help enhance transparency”, as untruthful. The MDCA 2014 and 2015 10Ks 
clearly falsify his claims, as shown on the next page.
Page 12 of 40 
 


In the 2014 10K, MDCA provided a revenue breakdown by 3 segments (including Corporate):9 


 
In the 2015 10K provides a revenue breakdown by 2 segments (including Corporate): 


 
 
Although MDCA appears to be (mostly) a roll-up of ad agencies, it does have stakes in other 
businesses such as Y Media Labs, Kingsdale Shareholder Services, etc. Investors would benefit if 
the company separately disclosed the financial results of these other businesses. 
No Evidence of Investing in Technology Capabilities 
CEO Scott Kaufman claimed: 


“MDC's heritage of investing in digital and technology capabilities organically, alongside 
creativity at the core of its agencies, continues to be one of its greatest differentiators and will 
remain a priority going forward.”10 


Gotham City Research investigated Scott Kauffman’s above claims and found them untrue. Specifically: 
 MDCA has spent $0 on research and development.11 
 The words ‘research’ and ‘development’ are barely mentioned in MDCA’s filings, in the context of 


“investing in digital and technology capabilities organically.”
Page 13 of 40 
 


If anything Scott Kauffman’s misrepresentations are eerily reminiscent of Quindell’s misrepresentations 
(Quindell is a suspect UK roll-up we exposed 2 years ago). Recall, Quindell represented itself as a 
cloud/SAAS business: 
Quindell made the following SaaSy claims12: 


 
 
Yet our investigation into Quindell showed that its depictions were materially misleading (moreover, we 
showed that Quindell’s accounts resembled Autonomy’s, an infamous accounting fraud)… just as we find 
MDCA’s claim of “investing in digital and technology capabilities organically” materially misleading.
Page 14 of 40 
 


Debt is Understated by at Least 23% 
MDCA is a No-Growth, Debt-Fueled Roll-up that also Understates Debt 
Highly acquisitive companies that depend on external capital tend to fail. Valeant Pharmaceuticals and 
Quindell both struggled to service their external capital obligations as soon as their organic growth 
deteriorated. We find that not only is MDCA’s organic growth overstated, its debt levels are understated1: 


 
Gotham City Research believes that MDCA’s true debt is around $300 million more than disclosed. The 
company, as required by accounting rules, fully consolidates the revenues of subsidiaries it does not fully 
own. As a result, it is important for us to accurately estimate MDCA’s correct enterprise value. We suspect 
MDCA concurrently understates debt and overstates EBITDA (we discussed MDCA’s pro forma EBITDA in 
the next section) so that its Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiples appears more favorable versus reality. 
We estimate true EV/EBITDA to be at least 23.4x: 


 
We believe MDCA has understated its debts in the following manner: 


 MDCA has consistently understated the Deferred acquisition consideration debt (“DAC”) 
liability, as evidenced by detailed information only publicly available in SEC Correspondence 
letters.  


 MDCA’s redeemable noncontrolling interest in Y Medialabs stake balance is severely 
understated. 


 Noncontrolling interests & redeemable noncontrolling interests are understated in a manner 
consistent with the DAC, if not more. The changes in redeemable noncontrolling interest note 
implies the understatement may be far greater. 


 Integrated Media, Team Health, & DuMont v. Mintz & Gold LLP et al  filings support our claims. 
 MDCA worked with quasi-captive entities like BDO Wiener & Associates to render these 


accounting maneuvers possible2.

MDCA’s Typical Acquisition Structure: 
In order to examine how MDCA understates its debts, it’s important to first show how MDCA (typically) 
structures its acquisitions3: 
 
 
 


  
 MDCA initially purchases 60% of an Ad Agency, but only pays a small amount of cash upfront. 


The remaining value of that 60% stake is structured as “DAC” and paid over time. 
 MDCA has the option or obligation to purchase the remaining 40% stake. 
 Because DAC + Noncontrolling Interests = Debt, it is important to accurately calculate what 


their true values are. 
 


MDCA’s primary objectives when structuring these transactions, from an accounting perspective: 
 Minimize DAC liability on its balance sheet (as it is debt), as not to arouse its lenders’ attention. 
 Slowly re-adjust the DAC liability over time, in future periods. 
 Avoid and/or delay income statement consequences, so as not to alarm shareholders.   
 Keep DAC adjustments as much as possible within the statement of financing activities in the 


cash flow statement and balance sheet, as most investors will ignore these sections of the 10K. 
How MDCA Minimizes the Deferred Acquisition Consideration  
MDCA’s breakdown of the ‘acquisition related payments’ cash outflow (under financing activities) as 
only available in the SEC letter shown below offers clues as to how MDCA manipulates the DAC figures4: 





Cash Paid Upfront

Noncontrolling Interest
Total Value of Acquired Company


MDCA Initially Purchases 60% of 
an Ad Agency. 


MDCA Has the Option/Obligation 
to Purchase Remaining 40%.
Page 16 of 40 
 


‘Accretion of present value’ and ‘changes in fair value’ = the means by which DAC manipulated5 





 
Market participants seem to believe that a higher than expected DAC payments is a “rich man’s problem”6, 
i.e. MDCA’s acquisitions are performing well if the DAC payments are higher than expected. The above 
table clearly disproves this belief. The present value adjustment, which is meaningful, has nothing to do 
with the acquired company’s future performance. 
 
DAC Present Value Accounting Magic 
In order to estimate how much the DAC is understated, we first obtain the estimated DAC payments by 
period as shown below7: 
 





Components of Acquisition Related Payments
$ in 1,000s 2011 2012 2013 TOTALS


initial estimated PV payments $33,908 $58,481 $75,405 $167,794
changes in fair value ($2,619) $2,581 $31,553 $31,515


accretion of present value $2,998 $7,663 $12,614 $23,275
Total payment $34,287 $68,725 $119,572 $222,584


Components of Acquisition Related Payments - % breakdown
2011 2012 2013 TOTALS


changes in fair value as % of total 98.9% 85.1% 63.1% 75.4%
accretion of present value (7.6%) 3.8% 26.4% 14.2%


Total payment 8.7% 11.2% 10.5% 10.5%
100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%
Page 17 of 40 
 


We then reverse the present value adjustment implied within the scheduled DAC payment amounts8: 


 
We reverse the present value adjustment using a WACC of 9.5%9 


MDCA uses a WACC weighted average cost of capital of 9.5% according to the SEC correspondence 
letter. The SEC correspondence letter is the only place where this information – the discount rate for 
the present value adjustment of the DAC – is publicly disclosed. The recent 10K mentions a WACC, 
but in the context of goodwill impairment testing (WACC were 8.92% to 11.95%) roughly in-line with 
the disclosure provided in the SEC comment letter. Therefore, we assume that the 9.5% WACC is not 
out of date. 
 The additional DAC debt resulting from the PV adjustment is $89 million. We conservatively 


assume the fair value adjustment to DAC is equal in value to the PV adjustment (even though 
historically the fair value adjustment exceeded the PV adjustment). 


 The IMS and Team Enterprises payment formulae suggest that the payments are contingent 
upon undemanding earnings targets. As a result, we believe DAC is more deferred compensation 
than an ‘earn-out’ (though they seem structured such that if performance exceeds the 
undemanding targets, they are handsomely compensated). Consequently, we believe the DAC 
‘fair value’ adjustments reverse the low-balled assumptions baked in the initial DAC estimates.10 


 In substance, DAC is little more than capitalized compensation for the acquired companies’ 
executives (albeit compensation MDCA is contractually obligated to pay, viz. debt) 


How MDCA Understates its Y Media Labs Debt: 
MDCA purchased 60% of Y Media labs and claims its 60% stake is worth $45 million. That would imply 
100% of Y Media Labs is worth $75 million, and the remaining 40% stake, $30 million. Yet MDCA recorded 
only $1.99 million on their books in Y Media Labs-related redeemable noncontrolling interest, i.e. they 
understated this liability by at least $28 million11:

At least 42%-53% of Reported Profits are Suspect 
Adjusted EBITDA Overstates MDCA’s True Earnings Power 
Many publicly-traded companies rely on Pro-forma, Non-GAAP measures – such as Adjusted 
EBITDA – to report their quarterly earnings. Gotham City Research believes there are legitimate 
cases whereby pro forma reporting more accurately reflect the underlying health of the business. 
For example, if a company reports EBITDA, and its calculated free cash flows are roughly in-line 
with their pro forma non-GAAP EBITDA, Pro-forma accounting makes sense.  
We believe MDCA’s Adjusted EBITDA does not accurately reflect the true earnings power of the 
business. The variances between Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are too high1: 


 
Furthermore, MDCA’s peers’s numbers do not have share this problem: their Pro Forma EBITDA 
reasonably track free cash flow. Thus, we conclude this is an MDCA-specific problem.2  
Compensation is MDCA’s Largest and Most Important Expense  
Like investment banks, hedge funds, law firms, etc., compensation is a large and very important 
expense for MDCA (northwards of 50%-60% of revenue). 
As a result, the vast majority of MDCA’s add-backs to arrive at adjusted EBITDA are 
inappropriate, as the vast majority of MDCA’s add-backs are compensation-related (i.e. Deferred 
acquisition consideration adjustment and stock-based compensation) 
By adding back these compensation costs, we believe MDCA overstates EBITDA by at least 42%3:

Adjustments: 
 Deferred acquisition consideration adjustment – DAC, as we discussed in the prior 


section, is nothing more than capitalized compensation. DAC should not be added back 
to EBITDA, just as bonuses should not be added back to an investment banks’ earnings. 


 Stock-based compensation –Stock-based compensation is compensation. 
 Distributions to noncontrolling interests –MDCA’s revenue is reported as if it owned 


100% of all subsidiaries, which it does not. We exclude this distribution to render the 
comparison apples to apples. These represent real transfers of economic interests away 
from MDCA’s stakeholders. 


 If we adjust the EBITDA for capital expenditures and some amortization of acquisitions, 
we arrive at a more conservative estimate of true earnings/cash flow of $94 million. This 
estimate is 52% less than MDCA’s $198 million Adjusted EBITDA figure. 


How Operating Cash Flow is Overstated 
The DAC adjustment flows the income statement, added back in the operating activities section, 
and then reduced within the financing activities. We agree with the SEC, that these DAC 
adjustments should be reflected in the cash flow from operating activities4: 


 
How the DAC and RNCI Liability Shenanigans Help MDCA Overstate Earnings 
In the prior section, we demonstrated how MDCA understates the DAC & related on its balance sheet. 
Those maneuvers should impact the income statement, but do not fully as some of the amounts 
circumvent the P&L, directly hitting the paid in capital account within the statement of shareholders’ 
equity/deficit instead5:

 MDCA’s Golden Handcuff Dilemma – darned if you, darned if you don’t 
Management talks enthusiastically about paying off its debt over the next 2 years. Here’s the dilemma 
they face. Acquired companies’ partners/top producers have incentive to leave as soon as they are fully 
paid their DAC. If these producers leave, hiring replacements is very expensive, and hits the income 
statement directly (i.e. operating expenses jump). Retaining these top producers is problematic as well, 
as they would expect to be paid handsomely, which too would raise opex, and hit profits. 
We speculate that this is what is happening with 72andSunny. The earnout contract came to end in 2015. 
They renegotiated and retained them with additional DAC payments.

BDO, Fraudulent Tax Shelters, & Quasi-Captive Entities 
MDC Partners, BDO, and Quasi-captive Entities – the Missing Link 
Despite Founder/Chief Executive Officer Miles Nadal and Chief Accounting Officer Michael Sabatino’s 
departure last year, we believe the dubious accounting policies and strategies linger. The SEC investigation 
was not motivated solely by Miles Nadal’s bad behavior – the investigation is as much triggered by MDCA’s 
suspect accounting.1  
Gotham City Research believes there is a common link between all the suspect accounting practices we’ve 
described so far:  


1. Michael Sabatino and his accounting crew within MDCA 
and 


2. Quasi-captive entities, such as BDO and David Wiener & Associates 
We believe the above parties worked together to achieve MDCA’s suspect accounting objectives. The 
following findings support our thesis: 


 (Former) Chief Accounting Officer Michael Sabatino is a former BDO audit partner. 
 MDCA replaced KPMG with BDO as its auditor, after KPMG issued an adverse opinion. 
 Joseph Klausner of BDO & partner was assigned to MDCA. Klausner was sued in Nussdorf v BDO 


Seidman for promoting fraudulent tax shelters (specifically “loss-generating schemes”). 
 Michael Sabatino and Joseph Klausner worked in parallel, as evidenced by SEC letters. We suspect 


they knew each other and were on cozy terms. 
 Michael Sabatino worked along-side David C. Wiener on the Integrated Media Solutions 


acquisition, and by inference, other MDCA deals.  
 Michael Sabatino and David Wiener have both spent part of their careers at Eisner LLP. We 


suspect they knew each other and were on cozy terms. 
 David Wiener was sued by an Integrated Media partner for providing dubious tax advice. He was 


also accused of representing and receiving compensations from both sides of the transaction. 
 In both the Klausner and Wiener related lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that they owed more in 


taxes to the IRS than Klausner or Wiener had advised. 
MDC Partners’ former auditor – KPMG – expressed “an adverse opinion on the effective operation of, 
internal control over financial reporting” in 2006. Subsequently2: 


 MDCA’s then CFO resigned in 2007. 
 David Doft became the new CFO (Doft has a “Wall Street” background). Sabatino, not Doft, 


appears to have been the brains behind the accounting operations. 
 MDCA replaced KPMG and hired BDO Seidman. 
 Recall that there was a flurry of SEC correspondence letters at the time.
Page 22 of 40 
 


The BDO Seidman partner assigned to MDCA, Joseph Klausner, was sued in Nussdorf v BDO Seidman 
for promoting fraudulent tax shelters3: 


 Plaintiffs faced back taxes, penalties, and interests from the IRS 
 They claim these were a direct consequence of BDO/Klausman getting plaintiff to utilize loss-


generating schemes determined by the IRS to be illegal/improper.
Page 23 of 40 
 


Nussdorf v BDO Seidman and Desiree Dumont v. Mintz & Gold LLP; and David C. Wiener & Company 
Gotham City Research has identified a few eerie similarities between Nussdorf v BDO Seidman and Desiree 
Dumont v. Mintz & Gold LLP, two seemingly unrelated cases4: 


 In both cases, the plaintiff(s) received a very large and unexpected bill from the IRS. 
 In both cases, the plaintiff(s) alleged the defendants provided false advice. 


o The IMS lawsuit and employment contract – seems specifically designed to treat what 
looks like ordinary income as long term capital gains. But IRS assessed Desiree Dumont’s 
payments as ordinary income, contrary to what Dumont was advised by Wiener.  


o Nussdorf v BDO Seidman – The plaintiffs “utilized loss generating schemes” as advised 
that were assessed by the IRS as illegal/improper. Resulted in back taxes, penalty, and IRS. 


 Michael Sabatino is connected to both cases. In the first, he was MDCA’s Chief Accounting Officer 
worked intimately with BDO, and Joseph Klausner BDO partner 


The Michael Sabatino connection to Joseph Klausner5: 
 





 Both were partners at BDO at some point. 
 They worked as client/”adviser” as well.
Page 24 of 40 
 


 
The Michael Sabatino connection to David Wiener and Desiree Dumont6: 


 
Sabatino and Wiener worked on other MDCA Deals 
As evidenced by Weiner’s website, he appears to be an adviser/accountant/ broker for many of MDCA 
deals:7 
 


 
 
Wiener lists the following MDCA related acquisitions above: 


 Kirshenbaum & Bond 
 Crispin porter 
 Doner 
 72andsunny
Page 25 of 40 
 


We guess Wiener worked on behalf of both the acquiree and acquirer, a practice that Desiree Dumont’ 
lawsuit, alleges: Wiener represented and was compensated by both acquiree (partner) and acquirer 
interests without (?) informing the acquire8: 


 
Sabatino and Wiener both worked at Eisner LLP9: 
Sabatino biography 


 
Wiener biography 


David Wiener is the founder and member of David Wiener and Company LLC, an affiliate of 
EisnerAmper LLP.  With over 45 years of public accounting experience, David’s practice focuses 
on advertising agencies and other marketing communications companies.   


 
BDO never expressed an adverse opinion regarding MDCA’s filings: 


 As MDCA’s auditor, BDO never expressed an adverse opinion, despite Miles Nadal’s proven 
malfeasance, and the SEC’s questions. 


 BDO remains unscathed and remains MDCA’s auditor (for now).
Page 26 of 40 
 


Given what happened to Wiener and BDO’s clients, MDCA’s tax-related red flags are concerning10: 
 MDCA pays negligible amounts of taxes. 
 MDCA pays negligible amounts of taxes, despite positive US income before taxes. 
 MDCA provides limited to no disclosures on its tax strategy, despite an apparent reliance on 


offshore losses. 
 MDCA’s tax deductible goodwill and intangibles has declined rapidly, from 100% to 16% as of 


2015. 
MDCA’s primary objectives when structuring these transactions, from a tax perspective: 


 Minimize taxes for the acquiree’s partners – i.e. long-term capital gains tax, versus ordinary 
income. 


 Minimize taxes for MDCA via aggressive goodwill treatment. Structure as an Asset purchase if 
possible for favorable tax treatment. 


Gotham City Research believe that MDCA, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or executives are at high risk of 
experiencing negative tax-related judgments for the following reasons: 
MDCA pays negligible amounts of taxes: 


 
 
Paying little to no taxes is not illegal nor necessarily unethical. That being said, we find a pattern of 
concern.  
 
For example, tax deductible goodwill and intangibles have declined at an accelerating rate recently. 
MDCA deducted 100% of goodwill and intangibles in 2013, and now only 16%: 





MDCA's Pay de minimis Income Taxes
$ in millions 2013 2014 2015


Cash income taxes paid $0.9 $0.4 $1.9
Cash interest paid $38.7 $49.3 $52.7

% tax deductible 100.0% 70.5% 16.10%
Page 27 of 40 
 


Also, the wide variance between Income from US versus Non-US is concerning, given rising scrutiny over 
offshore tax-related strategies (MDCA offers little to no disclosures regarding their tax strategy):

Executive Departures: 72andSunny 2016 = CB+P 2010? 
True Assets of Ad Agencies are its People 
Like investment banks, law firms, hedge funds, and other human capital-intensive businesses, advertising 
agencies’ largest (and only) true asset are its people. MDCA flourish so long as it is able to attract and 
retain talent. When talent leaves, the business suffers. There has been a recent wave of executive 
departures, leading us to wonder: is this a bug or feature of the MDCA Partners acquisition machine? And 
do these departures harm future periods’ financial results? If MDCA’s immediate past is prelude to its 
future, the answer is a resounding “yes”: 


 Key executives of MDCA’s portfolio companies appear to depart after their “Golden handcuffs” 
come off (i.e. their deferred acquisition considerations and/or noncontrolling interests are fully 
paid). 


 Crispin Porter Bogursky – MDCA’s former crown jewel – peaked in 2009, soon after MDCA 
redeemed the last remaining piece of non-controlling interests in CP+B that same year.1 


More recently: 
 At least 8 executives departed in recent quarters. 
 A long-time Crispin Porter + Bogusky partner (one of the few remaining) was unceremoniously let 


go late last year. He was one of last remaining CP+B original partners. 
 72andSunny has been hot over the last few years, but there are signs that it is following a similar 


trajectory as Crispin Porter Bogursky did several years ago. 
 72andSunny was recently sued twice for copyright infringement. Crispin Porter Bogursky was 


similarly sued several years ago before CP+B’s fell from grace.2 
 Executive departures at Valeant Pharmaceuticals, another highly acquisitive company, preceded 


its recent troubles. Clearly the art of attracting and retaining good people matters. 
Crispin Porter Bogursky’s Fall from Grace – a cautionary tale for 72andSunny 
CP+B used to be a legendary advertising agency. It defined success and innovation. In 2008 CP+B was 
crowned Agency of the Decade, and by 2010, CP&B was considered the “most-admired agency in 
America”. But by then CP+B had already peaked, declining ever since. We outline the sequence of events 
that define CP+Bs decline into the present day3: 


 In 2009, MDCA fully redeemed its remaining non controlling interest in CP+B. 
 CP+B’s best year financially (to date), was 2009. 
 By 2010 CP+B was then the largest of MDCA’s subsidiaries and accounted for over 50% of the 


company’s profits. CP+B generated $175 million in revenue from big clients including Microsoft, 
Nike, Coca-Cola and Volkswagen. 


 Alex Bogusky, who was named Creative Direct of the Decade, and who was behind key 
campaigns/client accounts (Burger King, BMW Mini, Sodastream) left in July 2010.
Page 29 of 40 
 


 Jeff Hicks, another key partner, departed soon after Bogursky left.  
After Bogusky and Hicks left in 2010: 


 CP+B lost the Burger King account.  
 CP+B and Microsoft (one of its largest clients) sued for intellectually property infringement.  
 CP+B revenue from Microsoft shrinks afterwards.  
 CP+B and Coca Cola sued for intellectually property infringement.  
 Coca-Cola replaces Crispin Porter on Coke Zero account  
 The staff has shrunk to fewer than 700; about 10% were laid off last month after Microsoft 


called a review. 
 
 


Present: 
 Of its original 13 partners, (at most) 3 remain. 
 CP&B CEO Andrew Keller, a longtime creative executive who took the helm in 2010 after Mr. 


Bogusky left, was let go last year. 
 


72andSunny Today Looks like the Crispin Porter Bogusky of 2010  
Crispin Porter Bogursky used to be MDCA’s crown jewel and now resembles a depreciating asset. 
Meanwhile, 72andSunny resembles CP+B in its boom years: 


How 72andSunny Became One of the Most Exciting Ad Agencies of L.A.'s Madison Avenue - 
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2014 


Yet there are signs of trouble ahead4:  
 An artist recently sued Starbucks and 72andSunny for copyright infringement. 
 Darlene Love sues 72andSunny and Google

MDCA’s Tone at the Top – ACT (DIS)HONESTLY 
“White-collar criminals fabricate false integrity to gain the trust of their victims. Stature, generosity, and 
good deeds gain the respect of their potential victims and make it less likely that victims will question their 
behavior.” – Sam Antar, Former CFO of Crazy Eddie’s, and now Whistleblower/Forensic Accountant 
MDCA’s New ‘Code of Conduct’ – the cover-up is worse than the crime” 
The rhetoric found in the new Code of Conduct is praiseworthy. It has an exemplary policy against 
dishonesty/fraud1: 


 
Unfortunately, MDCA’s “new” management – we say “new” because CEO Scott Kauffman has been a 
member of the company for many years as a Board member and its current CFO David Doft was the same 
CFO under Founder Miles Nadal – does not behave honestly. The following serve as the bases of our belief: 
The tone at the top has not changed since Miles Nadal and Michael Sabatino’s departure: 


 MDCA Chairman and CEO Scott Kauffmann was paid 11x more in 2015 than in 2014 despite the 
wrong-doing committed by Miles Nadal and the Company. 


 Lori Senecal’s linkedin profile claims she is/was the CEO of MDC Partners. Her husband was hired 
last year and was paid $1 million for less than 6 months’ work. 


 Other concerning related party transactions. 
 CFO David Doft remains. 


Evidence of deceptive conduct: 
 Organic growth is zero adjusted for inflation yet Company claims it is far above its industry peers. 
 The Company provides less business segment disclosures in 2015 versus prior years, yet CFO David 


Doft claims, “We actually think this will help enhance transparency, especially with a more cleaner 
breakout of corporate as an isolated item versus before.” 


 CEO Kauffman touts MDCA’s historical organic investment in “digital and technology capabilities” 
yet the company has spent zero dollars on R&D.
Page 31 of 40 
 


Scott Kauffman Receives a Promotion and Pay Raise for Failure (?) 
Despite the company’s questionable accounting and business practices under Board member Scott 
Kauffman – who has been with MDCA since 2006 –  his compensation increased 11-fold in 20152: 





 
 
Scott Kauffman’s Misrepresentations of the MDC Partners Business 
CEO Kauffman claimed: 
“MDC's heritage of investing in digital and technology capabilities organically, alongside creativity at the 
core of its agencies, continues to be one of its greatest differentiators and will remain a priority going 
forward.”3 
MDCA has no reported R&D spending4: 





MDC Partners' R&D Spending

David Doft Unethical and/or Unfit Comments for a CFO 
CFO David Doft is either unethical and/or not fit for the role of CFO, as evidenced by his lack of 
knowledge of MDCA’s segment reporting, despite being its CFO since 2007:  


So, by no means, are we looking to reduce transparency. We actually think this will help 
enhance transparency, especially with a more cleaner breakout of corporate as an isolated 
item versus before.” – David Doft Q4 2015 earnings call5 


 
MDCA disclosed more revenue segment information prior to 2015 – Strategic Marketing Services, 
Performance Marketing Services, and Corporate6: 


 
 
As of 2015 – Only discloses Advertising and Communications and Corporate segments 


 
 
Mr. Doft appears unaware that MDCA provided a breakout of corporate in the past as well. Doft 
may be liked by Wall Street, as he has a background in Wall Street. We believe the Street’s trust 
in MDCA’s CFO is misplaced, however, just as Wall Street’s trust in Valeant’s former CFO, 
Howard Schiller, was misplaced (recall Schiller too used to be loved by Wall Street and was long-
time Goldman Sachs banker).
Page 33 of 40 
 


Lori Senecal Claims to have been the CEO of MDC Partners 
Lori Senecal’s linkedin profile indicates she was the CEO of MDC Partners7: 


 
 
MDCA hired Lori Senecal’s husband last July, and compensated him ~$1 million for less than 6 months’ 
work8: 


 
Additional Questions about Lori Senecal’s ethics9:  


“McCann Erickson accused Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal + Partners, an MDC agency, of taking key 
executives who should have been bound by non-compete contracts.” 


 
For all the reasons stated in this section, as well as earlier this report, Gotham City Research believes 
MDCA’s CEO and CFO violates the Code of Conduct.
Page 34 of 40 
 


The SEC Investigation – Why the January 2016 Letter is Concerning 
MDCA’s recent (and on-going) spate with the SEC began in early 2014, when a whistleblower alerted SEC 
into Miles Nadal bad behavior and MDCA accounting issues10: 


When MDC Partners released its year-end earnings report in February, 2014, the news was 
upbeat: record results that included growth in cash flow and profits. It was “another year of 
exceptionally strong performance for MDC Partners,” the company’s founder and CEO, Miles 
Nadal, said in a press release. 
But that announcement would change MDC in ways few would realize. Within days, a 
whistleblower filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the top 
regulator of the New York City based company. 


SEC correspondences began shortly thereafter:
Page 35 of 40 
 


In the September 11, 2014 correspondence letter, the SEC sounded displeased with MDCA’s responses, 
and included these warnings11:  


 
Shortly thereafter, the SEC issued a subpoena on October 5, 2014:  


 
MDCA Discloses it received a subpoena from the SEC on April 28, 2015. Miles Nadal and Michael 
Sabatino leave a few months later  
 
SEC correspondence letters resume; SEC gets company to enhance disclosures (September 18th 2015) 


 
After several correspondences between MDCA and the SEC in late 2015, regarding new accounting 
questions, the SEC issued a letter on January 8th, 2016, that includes identical warning language it provided 
in the SEC letter that preceded the Company’s April 28th 2015 disclosure of a subpoena. If past is prelude 
to future, that is not a good sign for MDCA.
Page 36 of 40 
 


The “Valeant Pharmaceuticals of Ad Agencies” 
When we first learned about MDCA early last year, both it and Endurance International Group (which we 
published on one year ago), were referred to as the “Valeant Pharmaceuticals” of the Advertising and web 
hosting industries respectively. Recall that some market participants regarded that comparison a 
compliment at the time, as Valeant’s stock price had relentlessly risen upward in a short period of time. 
Here are some of the (eerie) similarities we have identified between VRX and MDCA: 


Valeant Pharmaceuticals 1 year ago MDC Partners 
 Organic growth overstated  Organic growth ~1.5%, not 7.5% 
 Suspect pro forma profits via aggressive 


accounting  
 High variance between pro forma profit

Valuation – shares worth less than $1.00 per share 
Industry standard Enterprise Value of EBITDA multiples imply that MDCA shares are worth $0/share 
MDCA’s peers’ shares trade at 9x-10x EV/EBITDA multiples (Enterprise value as a multiple of EBITDA). 
MDCA’s shares trade as if its EV/EBITDA is between 12.2x-23.4x1:   


 
 
Gotham City Research believes MDCA deserves at most a EV/EBITDA multiple on par with its peers, i.e. a 
9x-10x multiple. The following table lead us to believe MDCA shares are worth at most $1.00 per share2: 


 
 
Valuation Assumptions 


 Long-term nominal organic revenue growth is between 1%-3%, and real organic growth is 
close to 0%  


 Normalized EBITDA of $115 million –  Given real organic growth does not grow, we use our 
earlier EBITDA estimate as normalized EBITDA. We provide a sensitivities analysis above to show 
the shares still look quite unattractive at higher EBITDA assumptions albeit lower multiples. 


 Debt Assumptions – The above table uses the reported debt figures, rather than the adjusted 
debt figures we calculated. Our estimate of true debt would only depress the equity valuations 
even further. 


As you can see from the above table, it takes very little for MDCA shares to be rendered worthless (or 
theoretically) far less than worthless. 
Incidentally, MDCA’s Altman Z score implies a high risk of bankruptcy.
