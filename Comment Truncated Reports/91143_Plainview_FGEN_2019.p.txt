Executive Summary – Roxadustat
• HIF-PH inhibitors all demonstrate a strong adverse safety signal: Published 


roxadustat Phase 2/3 trial data shows 11/983 roxadustat patients died vs. 
0/419 control and 23/983 roxadustat patients experienced MACE incidents 
vs. 1/419 control.  Competing HIF-PH inhibitor drugs daprodustat and 
vadadustat also reported imbalances, and we believe this is a class effect 
driven by HIFs’ well-documented off-target effects
• Daprodustat: 9/677 daprodustat patients died compared to 1/192 control patients, 


and 14/677 daprodustat patients reported MACE incidents compared to 2/192 
control patients


• Vadadustat: Most adverse event data was withheld, but Akebia reported 5/522 
vadadustat patients died compared to 1/243 control patients and 7/522 vadadustat
patients reported MACE incidents compared to 1/243 control patients

Executive Summary – Roxadustat
• Roxadustat failed to achieve MACE non-inferiority in DD-CKD: FibroGen Management 


has withheld the DD-CKD time-to-MACE hazard ratio and instead repeatedly told 
investors that the number of MACE events was lower for roxadustat than EPO.  Many 
interpreted this as meaning that the MACE hazard ratio for roxadustat was <1.  This is 
wrong– the total number of events is only lower because the roxadustat discontinuation 
rate is much higher than EPO as evidenced by all prior roxadustat trials. In the China 
Phase 3 DD-CKD trial, the roxadustat discontinuation rate was 3.4x the EPO 
discontinuation rate.  Dropouts become immune to future events (but are also censored 
from the hazard ratio analysis and do not affect it).  All available evidence indicates that 
roxadustat failed to meet the DD-CKD primary safety endpoint 


• Roxadustat failed to achieve MACE non-inferiority in NDD-CKD: FibroGen Management 
has withheld the primary NDD-CKD safety endpoint (time-to-MACE hazard ratio) and 
instead told investors that a “conservative” post-hoc intention-to-treat (“ITT”) analysis 
demonstrated noninferiority.  ITT is the opposite of conservative: in contrast to the 
primary safety endpoint (Kaplan-Meier analysis), ITT does not censor study dropouts 
which dilutes any drug-driven safety signal by padding safety statistics with patients who 
are not taking the drug.  All available evidence indicates that roxadustat failed to meet 
the NDD-CKD primary safety endpoint


5Executive Summary
PLAINVIEW


Executive Summary – Roxadustat
• FibroGen’s reported control arm MACE+ results are inflated and irrelevant to 


approval: MACE+ obscures MACE by including congestive heart failure/unstable 
angina hospitalizations which are frequently driven by anemia rather than 
thrombosis.  Due to differences in mechanism of action, IV iron is frequently 
required for EPO to work, but not for HIF-PH inhibitors. In FibroGen’s Provenzano 
et al 2016, prohibition of IV iron resulted in an EPO Hb response rate of only 33% 
compared to 79% Hb response rate in the clinical-dose roxadustat group– despite 
screening out all EPO hyporesponders during enrollment. In its Phase 3 trials, 
FibroGen manipulated MACE+ by prohibiting IV iron, which artificially boosted the 
frequency of anemia among control arm patients as evidenced by its significantly 
higher transfusion rate. GSK’s daprodustat trials also demonstrated that restricting 
IV iron inflates control group “+” events (see slide 49) but has no impact on MACE 
incidents. FibroGen’s Q2 2019 10-Q (p. 47) ominously revealed that the EMA will 
be reviewing MACE results, and it is naïve to think that any regulatory agency 
would overlook a strong adverse MACE safety signal because of engineered “+” 
events. We believe MACE inferiority will lead to regulatory rejection in the US/EU 
and minimal uptake followed by inevitable approval revocation in China & Japan

Executive Summary – Roxadustat 
• EPO is safer than HIF-PH inhibitors because of its specificity to erythropoiesis: 


While EPO and HIF are part of the same pathway, HIF is upstream and activates 
many unnecessary genes while EPO circumvents that activity and is highly specific 
to erythropoiesis. In slides 53-65, we summarize the findings of more than a dozen 
studies implicating HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-PH inhibitors in hypertension, fibrosis, 
immune suppression and other effects that likely contributed to MACE


• Roxadustat and HIF-PH inhibitors are not capable of treating EPO hypo-
responders: FibroGen cites the study Provenzano et al 2016 as showing that 
roxadustat worked in EPO hyporesponders– but that study screened out EPO 
hyporesponders during enrollment and subsequently censored all roxadustat non-
responders from the relevant analysis. An intellectually honest study published by 
GSK showed that daprodustat does not work in EPO hyporesponders, which is 
almost certainly true for the entire HIF-PH inhibitor class

Executive Summary – Pamrevlumab
• Pamrevlumab, an anti-CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) antibody, has 


been FibroGen’s drug in search of a disease for years.  Multiple trials for 
pamrevlumab in fibrotic diseases have been initiated and concluded or 
terminated without disclosing results


• CTGF is portrayed by FibroGen Management as the central mediator of 
fibrosis, but the rest of the research community assigns it a minor role, with 
TGF-β1 implicated as the master regulator of fibrosis


• There is no consensus in the research community that CTGF has a key role in 
fibrosis in IPF, cancer, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or any other disease 
state.  CTGF rarely receives meaningful mention in publications not 
sponsored by FibroGen, and seems to be merely associated with fibrosis as a 
biomarker in the same way that many other extracellular matrix (“ECM”) 
components are associated with fibrosis


Executive Summary 8
PLAINVIEW


Executive Summary – Pamrevlumab
• We believe pamrevlumab is worth nothing in any of the indications FibroGen 


is currently testing it in


• In FibroGen’s pancreatic cancer trial, there was no difference in ORR 
between pamrevlumab + chemotherapy (21% ORR) vs. chemotherapy alone 
(23% ORR).  OS and PFS were conspicuously withheld.  The scientific concept 
behind using pamrevlumab for pancreatic cancer (targeting stromal growth) 
has been tried multiple times and has consistently failed


• Management withheld all relevant DMD data during the recent PPMD 2019 
presentation after running a trial for 3.5 years; this tells us that 
pamrevlumab did not show the hoped-for benefit


• We have serious doubts about pamrevlumab’s efficacy in treating IPF due to 
its mechanism of action failing to demonstrate benefit in fibrotic diseases in 
the past and the published lack of dose response in IPF  


9Executive Summary
PLAINVIEW


Executive Summary – Pamrevlumab
• Management appears to share our doubts about pamrevlumab in IPF: FibroGen is 


currently only running a single Phase 3 trial now even though two Phase 3 trials 
would be required for approval and each trial is expected to take four years


• FibroGen withheld efficacy results of a placebo-controlled study designed to test 
whether pamrevlumab added any benefit when stacked with current IPF standard-
of-care (Esbriet and Ofev); this indicates that pamrevlumab failed to show any 
benefit


• That failure likely informed the decision to structure the Phase 3 trial as placebo-
controlled with background Esbriet/Ofev prohibited.  This would make 
pamrevlumab unsellable even with Phase 3 success: 
• Pamrevlumab would be a branded IV formulation with no evidence of additive benefit, 


superiority, or even non-inferiority vs. oral Esbriet/Ofev, at least one of which will likely soon 
go generic


• Possibly competing against new drugs for IPF that show additive benefit with Esbriet/Ofev

FibroGen Overview
PLAINVIEW


FibroGen Overview
• $3.7bn market capitalization


• Founded in 1993


• FibroGen’s flagship drug is roxadustat, an HIF-PH inhibitor designed to treat 
anemia.  We estimate roxadustat makes up 85-90% of FibroGen’s current 
enterprise value.  FibroGen is scheduled to present its key major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACE) data at ASN 2019 (2:00 PM Friday, November 
8): a make-or-break moment for the drug and the company


• FibroGen is also developing pamrevlumab, an anti-CTGF antibody, for three 
indications: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pancreatic cancer, and 
Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).  We estimate pamrevlumab makes 
up the remainder of FibroGen’s current enterprise value.  Pamrevlumab’s 
Phase 3 trials are expected to read out in 2022 (pancreatic cancer) and 2023
(IPF)

PLAINVIEW


Roxadustat Overview
• Roxadustat is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (“HIF-PH”) inhibitor


• HIF is a transcription factor that can stimulate erythropoiesis, while HIF-PH is an 
enzyme that binds to and triggers the degradation of HIF through hydroxylation 
and ubiquitination


• In normal circumstances, HIF is inhibited by HIF-PH.  However, HIF-PH requires 
oxygen to function, hence HIF activity is “induced” by hypoxia


• Roxadustat is designed to inhibit HIF-PH, mimicking the effects of hypoxia and 
leading to increased erythropoiesis to treat anemia


• FibroGen has completed pivotal trials for roxadustat in the treatment of anemia in 
patients with chronic kidney disease and has guided to submitting an NDA for 
dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD & 
NDD-CKD) in October 2019 and to submitting an MAA in the EU by the end of Q1 
2020


13FibroGen Overview
PLAINVIEW


Pamrevlumab Overview
• Pamrevlumab (FG-3019) is an antibody designed to inhibit connective tissue 


growth factor (“CTGF”)


• FibroGen presents CTGF as a principal cause of fibrosis in organs as well as a 
key target in pancreatic cancer


• FibroGen has been conducting clinical trials with pamrevlumab since 2003


• Past indications FibroGen has posted pamrevlumab trials for and 
subsequently scrapped include liver fibrosis, diabetic nephropathy, and focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)


• Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
(“LAPC”) are the current lead indications for pamrevlumab
• LAPC Phase 3 results expected in 2022
• IPF Phase 3 results expected in 2023

Roxadustat Table of Contents
❑MACE/mortality imbalances appear to be a class effect


• There is a large MACE/death imbalance favoring control group across roxadustat trials as well as trials for competing HIF-
PH inhibitors vadadustat and daprodustat, indicating a class effect


❑Roxadustat’s MACE HR is inferior to EPO
• FibroGen’s claim of numerically lower events in DD-CKD is a product of the much-higher dropout rates seen in roxadustat 


groups across trials.  Based on published clinical data, we believe roxadustat’s MACE risk is significantly higher than EPO, 
which is why FibroGen has withheld it and provided bizarre excuses for the lack of disclosure


❑Roxadustat’s MACE HR is inferior to placebo
• FibroGen has withheld the NDD-CKD MACE HR and instead told investors that the post-hoc ITT MACE HR was non-


inferior to placebo.  ITT analysis is inappropriate & misleading because it dilutes the safety signal with dropouts.  As with
DD-CKD, we believe roxadustat failed to achieve MACE non-inferiority in the NDD-CKD setting


❑MACE+ inflated by prohibiting IV iron & using placebo comparator
• IV iron is a critical part of EPO treatment but is not necessary for HIF-PH inhibitors to achieve efficacy. FibroGen 


manipulated MACE+ by barring IV iron in its trials and using a placebo comparator in NDD-CKD, driving up anemia-related 
“+” events in the control groups


❑HIF-PH inhibitor mechanism of action is flawed
• HIF-PH inhibitors (including roxadustat) act upstream of EPO and are less specific to erythropoiesis.  HIFs & HIF-PH 


inhibitors have been implicated in hypertension, fibrosis, immune suppression, and other adverse effects that could 
increase risk of MACE


❑Roxadustat does not work in EPO-hyporesponsive patients
• FibroGen’s claim that roxadustat can treat EPO-hyporesponsive patients is based on a misleading study where EPO 


hyporesponders as well as roxadustat non-responders were removed from the analysis

Point #1: MACE/Mortality Imbalances Appear to be Class Effect


• Published data shows large MACE & mortality imbalances across FibroGen’s 
trials
• 11/983 roxadustat patients died compared to 0/419 control patients


• 23/983 roxadustat patients experienced MACE incidents compared to 1/419 control 
patients


• These imbalances were also seen in competitor GSK and Akebia’s HIF-PH 
inhibitor trials
• 9/677 daprodustat patients died compared to 1/192 control patients


• 14/677 daprodustat patients experienced MACE incidents compared to 2/192 control 
patients


• 5/522 vadadustat patients died compared to 1/243 control patients


• Akebia withheld nearly all adverse event data outside of deaths but reported 7/522 
MACE incidents in vadadustat patients compared to 1/243 in control patients

MACE/Mortality Rate Consistently Higher in Roxadustat Group


• We compiled all FibroGen’s published clinical data in the table below.  
Roxadustat consistently yielded worse MACE rates compared to EPO/placebo 
despite higher dropout rates.  This included 11/983 deaths on roxadustat 
compared to 0/419 deaths on EPO/placebo and 23/983 total MACE incidents 
compared to 1/419 for EPO/placebo

Roxadustat MACE Events by Category


MACE/Mortality Imbalances Appear to be Class Effect 20


1     In the poster discussing the Japan Phase 3 DD-CKD trial results, the authors did not provide a complete SAE breakdown, and it is possible that 
additional MACE incidents occurred that were not disclosed
PLAINVIEW


MACE Imbalance Even Worse After Adjusting For Treatment Duration


• However, event count understates 
how poorly roxadustat faired:
• The average treatment duration 


based on trial design was longer for 
control group patients than 
roxadustat patients (see table)


• The dropout rate was 40% higher in 
the roxadustat group compared to 
the control (see slide 18)– meaning 
that actual average treatment 
duration is even lower in roxadustat 
patients relative to control


MACE/Mortality Imbalances Appear to be Class Effect 21


• One concern with dividing total events by total patients is that the varying 
trial durations and enrollment sizes lead to different treatment durations 
for the patient groups which could make absolute event rates misleading


Note: 
1    US Phase 2 DD-CKD and US Phase 2b NDD-CKD trials each included two 
different trial durations.  These are combined in the prior two slides
PLAINVIEW


Class Effect: Higher MACE/Mortality Rates Also True for Daprodustat


MACE/Mortality Imbalances Appear to be Class Effect 22


• Daprodustat also saw much higher rates of discontinuation, MACE, and 
death compared to control. See Appendix at the end of this presentation 
for sources, relevant excerpts & brief discussion
PLAINVIEW


Class Effect: Higher MACE/Mortality Rates Also True for Vadadustat


• Akebia has withheld much of its safety data, but based on what is publicly 
available, vadadustat presents MACE/death imbalances similar to roxadustat 
and daprodustat. See Appendix at the end of this presentation for sources, 
relevant excerpts & brief discussion

PLAINVIEW


Death Imbalance in Additional Daprodustat Trial
• GSK also conducted a trial to reduce ischemic events in patients undergoing 


aortic aneurysm repair where patients were either dosed with daprodustat 
or placebo.  Daprodustat appeared to have a detrimental effect: 22% (6/27) 
of daprodustat patients died compared to 7.1% (2/28) of placebo patients


• Caveats:
• The death imbalance was not statistically significant due to low N


• The doses of daprodustat used in this trial (300 mg loading & 100 mg QD) were higher 
than the doses used for treating anemia, so it is not an apples-to-apples comparison–
but it is still certainly troubling


MACE/Mortality Imbalances Appear to be Class Effect 24



https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01920594
PLAINVIEW


MACE Inferiority Even with Questionable In-House Adjudications 


• In FibroGen’s publication Besarab et al 2015, the authors claimed that there 
were no cardiac SAEs in the roxadustat group.  Curiously, one of the non-
cardiac SAEs in the roxadustat group was deemed to be “dyspnea secondary 
to worsening congestive heart failure” while another SAE was ruled 
“noncardiac chest pain” with no further commentary


• Phase 3 safety results are generally worse for drugs with hazardous 
mechanisms of action because:
• Enrollment is expanded to meet powering requirements, frequently leading to sicker 


patients who are more susceptible to adverse events


• Adverse event adjudication switches from local principal investigator/sponsor to a 
blinded third party that is impartial and not invested in the success of a drug

https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/30/10/1665/2337245
PLAINVIEW


Greatest Phase 2 to Phase 3 Turnaround of All Time?
• Given the extraordinarily poor Phase 2 safety results reported despite in-


house adjudications, roxadustat achieving MACE noninferiority in Phase 3 
would be the greatest Phase 2 to Phase 3 turnaround of all time


• We find it highly unlikely that roxadustat inexplicably achieved the safety 
improvements necessary to reach non-inferiority in Phase 3 after reporting 
much worse safety in its prior trials


• Management’s blatantly misleading statements and refusal to disclose the 
actual MACE hazard ratios greatly reinforce our view. First rule of 
biotechnology investing: if Management withholds clinical data, that data is 
always bad


MACE/Mortality Imbalances Appear to be Class Effect 26
PLAINVIEW


Point #2: Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to EPO
• During May 2019 call to discuss pooled safety results for roxadustat, analysts repeatedly 


asked about the MACE hazard ratios in DD-CKD.  FibroGen Management refused to provide 
the hazard ratios, but instead said that the total number of MACE incidents was lower for 
roxadustat in DD-CKD, leading many to erroneously conclude that the hazard ratios were <1


• This conclusion is wrong.  The event counts are distorted by the fact that the dropout rate for 
the roxadustat group was much higher than the dropout rate for the control group. Dropouts 
become immune to MACE and reduce total possible events but are censored in calculating 
hazard ratios. Roxadustat dropout rates have been far higher than EPO across FibroGen’s 
trials: in the China Phase 3 DD-CKD trial, the roxadustat discontinuation rate was 3.4x the 
EPO discontinuation rate.  The gap in dropouts appears to increase as trial duration increases


• We believe the hazard ratio was not disclosed because roxadustat is inferior to EPO– not due 
to Management’s bizarre claims of being restrained by AstraZeneca and needing to discuss 
statistical analysis with the FDA well after the trial concluded


• FibroGen has confirmed that the roxadustat NDA & MAA are for the DD-CKD and NDD-CKD 
indications; the ID-CKD safety data is too underpowered to show MACE noninferiority and is 
irrelevant to drug approval


27Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to EPO
PLAINVIEW


“My Dog Ate My Pivotal Trial Results” 
• The initial FibroGen press release revealed that roxadustat achieved non-inferiority 


for MACE+ and that MACE showed “no clinically meaningful difference” in DD-CKD 
and NDD-CKD, but did not state that MACE achieved non-inferiority


• On the Q1 2019 call discussing the pooled Phase 3 results, FibroGen first claimed that 
“we have to yet agree with our regulator on specific [MACE] analyses to be done.”


• Minutes later, FibroGen Management implied that AstraZeneca was preventing 
FibroGen from calculating/sharing the MACE hazard ratios (but mysteriously not the 
MACE+ hazard ratios or any of the other statistics they provided): “We don't expect 
that MACE will be particularly different than this [MACE+]. It's just that with U.S., we 
have an agreement with our partner, AstraZeneca, to evaluate under the totality of 
evidence basis.”


• These excuses are absurd.  MACE is a subgroup of MACE+, so if FibroGen had 
calculated the MACE+ hazard ratios, then FibroGen must have also calculated 
the MACE hazard ratios.  Even suspending reality and assuming FibroGen could 
not produce a hazard ratio, they could have easily provided a Kaplan-Meier plot or 
basic statistical measures such as means/medians to show the data– no complex 
analysis required

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=253783&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2398154
PLAINVIEW


Event Count Misdirection
• When pressed on hazard ratios, FibroGen Management switched the 


discussion from hazard ratios to the misleading number of events:
“So with the MACE+ data, I believe we have numeric advantage in these categories. So 
there’s 5 categories…Every one of them, we have numeric advantage over ESA. Is that 
clear enough?”


• This was repeated multiple times, and seemed to placate some investors 
and analysts, with the underlying assumption being that if the total number 
of events was lower, then the hazard ratio must be <1


• This assumption is wrong


• The primary safety endpoint for DD-CKD and NDD-CKD is MACE hazard ratio, 
not total number of MACE events per group


Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to EPO 29
PLAINVIEW


Much Higher Dropout + Lower Number of Events = HR Inferiority
• The number of events can be lower in the roxadustat group despite HR inferiority because 


roxadustat has consistently seen far more patient dropouts compared to EPO


• Looking at FibroGen’s public EPO-controlled DD-CKD trial data, the dropout rate in the roxadustat 
group is up to 3.4x as high as the dropout rate in the EPO group, with the difference increasing 
with duration:


• Looking at the 19-26 week trials, we see that the median discontinuation rate for roxadustat 
patients is 21.2% compared to 8.7% for placebo, or 2.43x as high.  The dropout discrepancy 
appears to increase with increased duration and the median duration was significantly higher in 
the DD-CKD Phase 3 trials: FibroGen reported a mean duration of treatment of 1.9 years in the 
SIERRAS trial and 1.8 years in HIMALAYAS


• The consistently higher dropout rates should also be alarming to investors given that safety is the 
key endpoint

PLAINVIEW


Hazard Ratio Refresher
• Hazard ratios (HRs) measure the likelihood of a specific event occurring in 


one population compared to the likelihood of the same event occurring in 
another population over a given time horizon


• HRs are not the total number of events in one group divided by the other 
group. “Total events” is not a useful measure (particularly in the case of 
roxadustat) because dropouts become immune to survival endpoints due 
to censoring and would inappropriately benefit their group by reducing 
total possible events


• Dropouts are addressed by using Kaplan-Meier estimate censoring: once a 
patient drops out, he/she is censored from future event probability 
calculation. The operating assumption is that dropouts would have had the 
same probability of experiencing an event in the future as the rest of the 
population


Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to EPO 31
PLAINVIEW


Hazard Ratio Refresher
• HRs can be thought of as the tangent slope of the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) event 


curve for one group divided by the tangent slope of the K-M curve for the 
other group.  The relative slope represents the relative probability of an 
event occurring: if Survival Curve 1 (SC1) has a slope of -5% (meaning that, 
on average, 5% of the population experiences the event per time period) 
and Survival Curve 2 (SC2) has a slope of -10% (meaning that, on average, 
10% of the population experiences the event per time period), the event is 
twice as likely to occur during a given time period in the Survival Curve 2 
group.  The HR for SC1 would be 0.5 and the HR for SC2 would be 2.0


• The tangent slope is rarely (if ever) constant, and so each K-M curve 
generates a range of slopes (and thus hazard ratios) which can be used to 
calculate confidence intervals

Hazard Ratio Refresher
• In a simple example, we look at two populations where one population has an 


event rate of 5%/year and a dropout rate of 5%/year while the other 
population has an event rate of 7.5%/year and a dropout rate of 15%/year.  
Despite having a lower total event count, the hazard ratio for the second 
population is much higher and the K-M curve plainly illustrates worse survival:

PLAINVIEW


High Dropout Rate Suppresses MACE Event Count
• Another HIF-PH inhibitor, Bayer’s molidustat, reported comparable MACE 


event rates between the trial group and control in Macdougall et al 2019.  
However, we think this is attributable to the astronomically higher dropout 
rate in the molidustat group (38% vs. 11%), not to any difference between 
molidustat and the other HIF-PH inhibitors.  The control completion rate was 
nearly 50% higher than molidustat (89% control vs. 62% molidustat)

ID-CKD: Powering Insufficient to Draw Conclusions
• FibroGen claims that roxadustat achieved “directionally lower MACE risk than 


EPO” in the ID-CKD subpopulation 


• FibroGen’s decision to frame the ID-CKD hazard ratio as showing “directionally 
lower” MACE risk without any mention of non-inferiority indicates that the 
confidence interval did not achieve non-inferiority


• We can roughly estimate the confidence interval for the ID-CKD data based on 
prior confidence interval of the CHOIR trial, which enrolled a similar size 
population (CHOIR n = 1,432, FibroGen ID-CKD n = 1,526)


• The hazard ratio in the CHOIR trial was 1.28 with a 95% confidence interval of 
(1.03, 1.75).  With the same confidence interval range of (-0.25,+0.47), roxadustat 
would have needed to achieve an HR of 0.83 just to prove non-inferiority


• The confidence interval for ID-CKD is likely even wider than the CHOIR trial due to 
1) ID-CKD patients experiencing more frequent events compared to the stable 
dialysis patients enrolled in CHOIR and 2) roxadustat’s high dropout rate

ID-CKD MACE: Not a Primary Safety Endpoint


• We find it highly unlikely that HIF-PH inhibitors can achieve superiority or even 
non-inferiority vs. EPO in any setting given the preponderance of clinical evidence 
from FibroGen, Akebia, and GSK that HIF-PH inhibitors increase MACE risk relative 
to EPO


• We note that in FibroGen’s prior uncontrolled ID-CKD roxadustat trial, 3% (2/60) of 
roxadustat patients experienced MACE events (both deaths) within 12 weeks


• It is far more likely that the “directionally lower MACE risk” is the product of the 
higher variance in the ID-CKD pool fueled by more frequent events and a smaller N


• Regardless, the ID-CKD results are insufficient to support an NDA in terms of 
powering.  As FibroGen has stated multiple times (including on the most recent 
August 8, 2019 Q2 2019 conference call), the NDA is to be submitted for the DD-
CKD and NDD-CKD indications– not for ID-CKD

Point #3: Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to Placebo


• FibroGen Management refused to disclose the NDD-CKD MACE hazard ratio, 
but instead said that under a “conservative” post-hoc intention-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis, roxadustat achieved non-inferiority


• The difference between standard Kaplan-Meier analysis and ITT analysis is that 
Kaplan-Meier censors patients after drug discontinuation while ITT does not


• Evaluating safety using an ITT analysis is the opposite of conservative: ITT 
analyses include dropouts who are no longer taking study medication, which 
dilutes any drug-driven safety signal 


• If Management calculated the ITT MACE HR (HR including dropouts), then 
Management must have also calculated the primary safety endpoint: the MACE 
hazard ratio corrected for study dropouts via censoring.  We believe FibroGen 
withheld the primary safety endpoint because roxadustat failed to achieve non-
inferiority to placebo

PLAINVIEW


NDD-CKD MACE HR Failed to Achieve Non-Inferiority
• Like DD-CKD, FibroGen declined to provide the MACE HR for NDD-CKD.  We 


chalk this up to roxadustat failing to achieve MACE non-inferiority compared 
to control


• This is not surprising: if roxadustat could not show MACE non-inferiority to 
EPO and EPO is known to increase MACE risk, one would expect that 
roxadustat would also be inferior to placebo in terms of MACE risk


• FibroGen did not tout a lower event count for roxadustat in NDD-CKD– we 
believe this is at least in part because the NDD-CKD placebo dropout rates 
were closer to roxadustat than the DD-CKD EPO dropout rate (see slide 18), 
and thus the event count for NDD-CKD was not as skewed by dropouts


Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to Placebo 38
PLAINVIEW


Intention-To-Treat Vs. Kaplan-Meier
• Instead of providing the actual NDD-CKD MACE HR, FibroGen told investors 


that the NDD-CKD ITT MACE HR was non-inferior to placebo


• Intention-to-treat (“ITT”) is typically used for evaluating drug efficacy 
(particularly in cancer) in order to avoid survivorship bias in determining 
how effective a drug is: patients who respond to a drug are more likely to 
continue taking it than patients who do not respond


• ITT is completely inappropriate for evaluating safety because it dilutes the 
safety data by including safety data of patients who are not taking the drug


• The standard method for evaluating safety measures such as MACE is a 
Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis.  K-M analyses accounts for dropouts by 
censoring them.  Patients are included in the safety population until they 
stop taking the drug after which they are excluded from analysis– because 
they are no longer taking the drug


Roxadustat’s MACE HR is Inferior to Placebo 39
PLAINVIEW


Roxadustat NDD-CKD NDA Based On K-M HR, Not ITT HR
• On the Q2 2019 call, Management discussed the results of its pre-NDA FDA 


meeting (emphasis added): “And in terms of the way that the time to MACE 
primary endpoint is being analyzed in nondialysis, this will account for 
differential drop out between our drug and placebo, whereas you know 
that because placebo doesn't work in treating anemia, placebo patients had 
a tendency to drop out earlier. And we have reached agreement on statistical 
method that accounts for that.”


• Management did not mention “ITT” at any point during the Q2 2019 call


• Differential dropout rates are accounted for via Kaplan-Meier censoring; ITT 
is diluted by dropouts.  Barring some other nonconventional way of 
accounting for dropouts, this confirms that the NDA will use the 
conventional Kaplan-Meier analysis MACE HR rather than the ITT MACE HR

Point #4: MACE+ Inflated by Prohibiting IV Iron & Using Placebo Comparator


• The principal safety concern for ESAs/HIF-PH inhibitors is increased risk of 
thrombosis which manifests as MACE: stroke, myocardial infarction, and death


• The “+” in MACE+ is hospitalizations for congestive heart failure/unstable 
angina– which are frequently driven by anemia rather than thrombosis.  
Looking at MACE+ instead of MACE masks the real risk (potentially fatal blood 
clots) with temporary symptoms driven by an unrelated cause


• FibroGen prohibited IV iron, a key part of EPO therapy that is not necessary for 
HIF-PH inhibitors.  Doing so increased anemia in control groups and thus 
artificially inflated the control group MACE+ rates in the DD-CKD trials


• In the NDD-CKD trials, a placebo comparator combined with the IV iron ban 
inflated control group anemia and MACE+ rates


• MACE+ noninferiority will not make regulators overlook clear MACE inferiority

EPO Requires IV Iron & Roxadustat Does Not
• Iron is a key component of hemoglobin


• Using exogenous EPO in patients skips 
steps of the HIF pathway, including those

• Because iron absorption/transport is not 
enhanced in EPO patients, IV iron 
supplementation is frequently essential in 
EPO patients to ensure sufficient iron is 
available for erythropoiesis

drastically reduce the need for IV iron by 
improving iron absorption/transport

Prohibiting IV Iron Inflated Anemia Rate in Control Group


• FibroGen noted in its December 2018 topline press release that 
“…roxadustat-treated patients had a 33% reduction in the risk of blood 
transfusion compared to epoetin alfa (HR=0.67) in the time to first blood 
transfusion during treatment, p=0.0337.”  Note that a 33% reduction in risk 
in the roxadustat population equates to a ~50% increase in risk in the EPO 
population (1/.67 = 1.49)


• FibroGen attributes the decreased risk of rescue therapy to roxadustat’s 
ability to treat EPO-resistant patients.  This claim is wrong– as we show in 
Point #6 of this presentation, HIF-PH inhibitors do not work in true EPO 
hyporesponders


• The difference is attributable to the fact that IV iron is a key part of EPO 
therapy and it was prohibited (except as rescue therapy) in FibroGen’s trials

Prohibiting IV Iron Increases Anemic Events By Reducing EPO Efficacy


• In the roxadustat Phase 2 trial (Provenzano et al 2016), the investigators 
prohibited IV iron use in both groups


• The EPO Hb response rate was only 33% compared to 79% Hb response rate in the 
high-dose roxadustat group.*  However, this trial screened out all EPO 
hyporesponders prior to randomization–the fact that only 33% of EPO patients in 
the trial achieved Hb responses is reflective of the impact of prohibiting IV iron, 
not the efficacy of EPO treatment, and demonstrates that restricting IV iron has 
a far greater impact on EPO patients than on roxadustat patients


• This demonstrates the enormous impact that prohibiting IV iron has on successful 
treatment with EPO: Kharagjitsingh et al 2005 conducted a retrospective study and 
concluded that the true EPO hypo-response rate is only 3.3% (57/1,677 patients) 
with an even lower incidence rate of 16.7 per 1,000 patient-years

Anemia Drives CHF/Unstable Angina
• In Bhavanadhar et al 2016, the authors found that 58.2% of patients hospitalized 


for unstable angina were experiencing anemia. The authors noted that anemia 
drives angina and CHF, citing the textbook Clinical Hematology (Wintrobe 2008):


“It is well established in patients with known CVD that anaemia has adverse 
effects on myocardial oxygenation resulting in provocation or 
acceleration of angina, and may worsen Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).”


• Anemia, unstable angina, and CHF symptoms are all caused by reduced 
oxygenated blood flow and present with similar symptoms.  They also frequently 
occur concurrently, making it difficult if not impossible for adjudicators to 
distinguish between hospitalization for anemia and hospitalization for angina/CHF 
unrelated to anemia

• Dosing anemic hemodialysis patients with EPO + IV iron is standard practice:

were on EPO and 62% of dialysis patients were on IV iron

MACE is Principal Measure of Safety 
• FibroGen’s MACE+ results are a red herring driven by FibroGen’s decisions to 


1) prohibit patients from using parenteral iron and 2) use placebo 
comparators in the NDD-CKD trials, which artificially inflated the anemia 
rates in the control groups and thus control group MACE+ rates


• The primary concern with EPO and HIF-PH inhibitors is that they can cause 
thrombosis leading to MACE; the “+” in MACE+ is particularly irrelevant to 
this given FibroGen’s trial protocol


• We note that the primary safety endpoint for the FDA NDA is MACE and on 
p. 47 of its Q2 2019 10-Q, FibroGen (for the first time) disclosed that the 
EMA will be reviewing MACE as well


• The entire point of a primary safety endpoint is to weed out unsafe drugs–

Point #5: HIF-PH Inhibitor Mechanism of Action is Flawed


• EPO is part of the HIF pathway and lies downstream from HIF. HIFs have been 
shown to induce hypertension, fibrosis, immune suppression, and other 
adverse effects through EPO-independent mechanisms


• HIF-PH inhibitors are flawed compared to EPO because EPO is highly specific to 
erythropoiesis and HIFs are not


• The pro-HIF-PH inhibitor theory is that administering HIF-PH inhibitors lowers 
total EPO exposure, which improves safety.  The anti-HIF-PH inhibitor thesis is 
that the pleiotropic effects of HIFs are more dangerous than higher EPO 
exposure


• The large MACE & mortality imbalances and higher dropout rates in published 
HIF-PH inhibitor trial data show that HIFs’ problematic effects vastly outweigh 
lower systemic exposure to EPO

Review: The HIF-EPO Pathway
• Under normal conditions 


(normoxia), HIF-α (HIF-1α and HIF-

by the Von Hippel Lindau E3 ligase 
(VHL) after being tagged by prolyl 
hydroxylase domain-containing 
proteins (PHD)


• Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-
PHDs cease to function, which 
allows for HIF-α to enter the 
nucleus and activate gene 
transcription: mimicking this by 
blocking PHDs is the intended 
mechanism of action of roxadustat 
and other HIF-PH inhibitors

Kiriakidis et al 2017 found that dosing mice with 10 mg/kg roxadustat led to 
a 50% decline in C1q secretion, negatively impacting immune responses.  


• The authors concluded that this was likely due to roxadustat also inhibiting 
the collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases, which are necessary for formation of C1q

3,4-DHB is an HIF-PH inhibitor. Administration of 3,4-DHB in septic (CLP or PCI) 
mice led to significantly worse survival outcomes compared with control


• Kiriakidis et al 2017 also noted that the study Schindler et al 2016 found that HIF-
PH inhibition in septic mice led to significantly higher mortality rates.  This is likely 
a product of the HIF-PHi-induced immune suppression via C1q suppression (see

Other Adverse Effects of HIFs


• Cheng et al 2014 concluded that HIF-1α collaborates with Notch-1 to induce 
neuronal death in ischemic strokes, and that inhibiting HIF-1α decreased 
neuronal death


• While companies developing HIF-PH inhibitors have not admitted to any pro-
oncogenic safety signals, HIF is also strongly implicated in cancer
• It has also been shown that HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression in tumors is associated with 


worse progression-free survival and overall survival


• Peloton Therapeutics’ HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 produced a 22% monotherapy ORR in 
2L+ ccRCC patients while its HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 produced a 24% ORR in 2L+

HIF Exposure Greatly Outweighs Reduced EPO Exposure


• There are likely multiple factors driving the imbalance in deaths, MACE and 
dropout rates between HIF-PH inhibitors and EPO


• The pro-roxadustat/HIF-PH inhibitor thesis is that EPO exposure is the 
principal culprit in deaths/MACE in both EPO and HIF-PH inhibitor patients 
and HIF-PH inhibitors can achieve equivalent increases in Hb with lower EPO 
exposure; therefore, HIF-PH inhibitors should reduce MACE risk


• The dramatic MACE/death imbalance seen in clinical data showed that this 
theory was wrong.  The consistently higher dropout rate in the HIF-PH 
inhibitor groups across trials also pose additional safety concerns, and the 
real-world safety difference is even greater than FibroGen’s trials suggest 
due to FibroGen’s disingenuous decision to prohibit IV iron, which inflated 
EPO dosing in the control group far beyond where it would have been under 
real-world conditions

Point #6: Roxadustat Does Not Work in EPO Hyporesponders


• FibroGen references two pieces of evidence to show that roxadustat can 
adequately treat EPO hyporesponders. Both are misleading and wrong:
• Provenzano et al 2016 showed that roxadustat seemed to have similar impact on patients 


regardless of CRP levels, with the implicit assumption that CRP is the key determinant of EPO 
hyporesponsiveness.  The problem is that Provenzano 1) screened out EPO hyporesponders 
during enrollment and 2) did not include the roxadustat non-responders (16%, 9/58) in the 
analysis.  The only real takeaway is that roxadustat works in 100% of the subgroup that 
roxadustat works in 


• In multiple studies, roxadustat patients achieved higher Hb levels compared to EPO patients.  
This was a result of FibroGen prohibiting use of IV iron, a critical part of EPO therapy– not of 
superior efficacy.  Competitor HIF-PH inhibitor trials permitting IV iron showed no difference 
in Hb


• GlaxoSmithKline conducted a study of its HIF-PH inhibitor daprodustat among 
EPO-hyporesponsive patients, and found that daprodustat produced no Hb 
response in those patients.  This is likely true for the entire HIF-PH inhibitor class

PLAINVIEW


FibroGen’s EPO Hyporesponse Theory
• Inflammation drives an increase in hepcidin, which binds to ferroportin and thus 


suppresses absorption and extracellular release of iron


• HIFs are known to decrease hepcidin levels; this improves iron transport for 
patients


• The theory presented by FibroGen is that the principal cause of EPO 
hyporesponsiveness is inflammation limiting iron absorption and transportation, 
and using HIF-PH inhibitors helps combat this by decreasing hepcidin levels and 
increasing iron absorption/transport


• FibroGen’s principal support for this theory comes from Provenzano et al 2016, 
where the authors measured inflammation based on C-reactive protein (CRP) 
levels and used CRP as a proxy for EPO hyporesponsiveness.  The theory is that 
inflammation (high CRP) causes EPO hyporesponse, so therefore if roxadustat 
works in patients with high CRP levels, then this means it will work in EPO 
hyporesponders.  As we show, the study was extremely misleading and wrong

Problem #1: Provenzano Excluded Roxadustat Non-Responders


• There are two problems with the Provenzano et al 2016 analysis: first, the 
authors excluded all the patients who discontinued roxadustat due to lack of 
efficacy:


Roxadustat Does Not Work in EPO Hyporesponders 68


Excluding patients for lack of efficacy 
makes the subsequent declaration 
that CRP levels do not affect 
roxadustat efficacy completely 
meaningless– of course roxadustat 
works for all patients after excluding 
the 16% of patients it did not work 
for!

Problem #2: Provenzano Excluded EPO Hyporesponders from Enrolling

Iron-Mediated EPO Hyporesponses Already Solved…With IV Iron


• The need for HIF-PH inhibitors to modulate iron transport is an invented 
problem: the iron transport problem has already been solved with IV iron, 
which leaves no benefit to using HIF-PH inhibitors except in FibroGen’s 
unrealistic trials where patients are denied IV iron except as emergency 
rescue therapy


• IV iron avoids the problems with iron transport/absorption by putting the 
iron directly into the bloodstream. Ueda & Takasawa 2018 conducted a 
meta-analysis of nine studies comparing use of IV iron and oral iron in 
anemic CKD patients, and concluded that “One of the reasons accounting for 
superiority of IIT [IV iron therapy] over OIT [oral iron therapy] to maintain 
tHb [target Hemoglobin] in CKD patients may be the difference in the 
efficacy of IIT and OIT in CKD patients in the presence of concomitant 
inflammation that increases ferritin and hepcidin.”

Higher Hb Levels in Roxadustat Group Due to Study Design, Not Efficacy


• Another part of FibroGen’s roxadustat pitch is that roxadustat is capable of 
achieving higher Hb levels than EPO


• In reality, this appears to be driven by the previously-discussed decision to 
prohibit IV iron rather than efficacy


• For instance, in Provenzano 2016, the authors concluded that the Hb 
responder rate for the EPO group was 33% compared to 79% for the pooled 
high-dose roxadustat group.  This doesn’t make sense at all considering that 
the supplement to Provenzano 2016 (relevant graphic on slide 69) showed 
that EPO hyporesponders were already screened out of the trial– unless the 
EPO hyporesponses were driven by prohibition of IV iron

Competitor Trials Show HIF-PHi & EPO Hb Responses Are Similar


• Examining competitors’ long-term DD-CKD trials, we see no meaningful 
difference between Hb levels achieved in drug vs. control groups (see below 
table).  Roxadustat utilizes the same mechanism of action and we believe 
the claimed benefit is primarily a function of FibroGen suppressing the 
results of the EPO group by withholding IV iron

❑ Pamrevlumab Background: Lots of Trials, Few Results
❑ CTGF is a Biomarker, Not a Principal Mediator
❑ No Value in IPF Even If Phase 3 Trial Succeeds


• FibroGen withheld results from a trial comparing pamrevlumab + SoC vs. placebo + SoC, 
indicating that the trial likely failed.  This means that pamrevlumab offers no additive benefit 
to SoC which is likely going generic before pamrevlumab could possibly make it to market


• We have concerns about pamrevlumab’s efficacy and Management appears to share our 
concerns: FibroGen only initiated a single Phase 3 despite long trial duration (4+ years 
expected) and a precedent that clearly shows two Phase 3 trials are required for approval.  At 
best, pamrevlumab will get approval for IPF in 9-10 years 


❑ No Evidence Pamrevlumab Works in DMD

❑ Pamrevlumab Doesn’t Work in Pancreatic Cancer

Management’s Sleaziness Permeates Into Pamrevlumab
• In a February 2016 investor call, Fibrogen Management told investors that they were 


“encouraged” by Phase 2 results for pamrevlumab for liver fibrosis resulting from 
Hepatitis B and implied that pamrevlumab was reversing fibrosis:


“The result showed a trend for dose response improvement in liver fibrosis at doses of FG-
3019 similar to those now being tested in other diseases. We are encouraged by these 
results, and we continue to evaluate options for trial of FG-3019 in subjects with advanced 
liver fibrosis due to NASH. In addition, we are evaluating the potential for trial of FG-3019 
in subjects with advanced liver fibrosis due to hepatitis C, where it appears that the fibrosis 
may not resolve after cure of the hepatitis with current potent anti-viral therapy.”


• In reality, Management had already prematurely terminated the HBV trial in June 2015 
for futility (note that the primary completion date is June 2015)-- eight months before 
claiming to be “encouraged” by the results.  The promised additional trials in 
HBV/HCV/NASH never came to fruition


• Management also ran a six-month Phase 2 trial in diabetic nephropathy and terminated 
the trial 18 months later (January 2011)– after the scheduled primary completion date.  
No results or explanation for termination were ever given outside of the termination 
being a “strategic decision”.  Diabetic nephropathy is an enormous indication, so this 
strategic decision was likely driven by lack of efficacy

• Pancreatic Cancer: FibroGen issued a press release touting that 33.3% of

the control group compared to 21% in the pamrevlumab group which was 
published in an ASCO 2018 poster.  PFS and OS data were never published


• DMD: In a bizarre presentation at PPMD 2019, FibroGen avoided disclosing 
efficacy endpoints in the uncontrolled trial– instead only stating that certain 
endpoints performed better than cherry-picked publications


• IPF: As part of the PRAISE trial, FibroGen conducted an RCT comparing 
pamrevlumab + standard-of-care vs. placebo + standard-of-care. No efficacy 
results were ever announced or published.  This trial is key because it informs 
whether pamrevlumab adds any benefit to standard-of-care, which is expected to 
go generic before pamrevlumab could possibly make it to market

Point #1: CTGF is a Biomarker, Not a Principal Mediator


• FibroGen paints connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as the principal cause of 
fibrosis; most other research implicates TGF-β1 as the master regulator of 
fibrosis and research papers and primers on the subject pay little attention to 
CTGF


• In drug development, validated targets are quickly copied; often before they are 
even proven in humans.  Pamrevlumab has been in the clinic for 16 years with 
no imitators.  Many drug developers are targeting fibrotic diseases but outside 
of FibroGen, none are targeting CTGF 


• While we don’t dispute that CTGF mediates some effects, we believe its impact 
is not clinically significant and that CTGF is more of a biomarker of fibrosis than 
a key driver of fibrosis


80CTGF is a Biomarker, Not a Principal Mediator
PLAINVIEW


What is CTGF?
• CTGF is an extracellular matrix protein (“ECM”) and “connective tissue 


growth factor” is a misnomer: “the name CTGF (connective tissue growth 
factor)…implies activities and a mechanism of action akin to those of 
classical growth factors, a notion that has not been supported by 
experimental evidence to date.” (emphasis added, Chen & Lau 2009)


• Fibrosis involves the growth and proliferation of many ECM proteins and 
CTGF is only one of them


• Pamrevlumab’s lack of monetizable or even decisive clinical results after 16 
years of trials suggests that the impact of targeting CTGF is simply not 
meaningful for patients suffering from fibrosis


• Based on published research, we believe that CTGF is more of a biomarker of 
fibrosis and pancreatic cancer than a valid target with clinical value

Point #2: No Value in IPF Even If Phase 3 Trial Succeeds


• We question whether pamrevlumab will succeed in its IPF Phase 3 trial given that:
• Pamrevlumab showed no dose response in IPF
• It is not clear why pamrevlumab would work in IPF after failing in other fibrotic indications


• As part of the PRAISE trial, FibroGen conducted an RCT comparing pamrevlumab + SoC vs. 
placebo + SoC in IPF which concluded in 2017– and never announced or published the 
efficacy results, a near-certain sign that pamrevlumab added no benefit to SoC. This likely 
informed the decision to prohibit use of SoC as background therapy in the Phase 3 trial


• The lack of additive benefit to SoC makes pamrevlumab an impossible sell even assuming 
Phase 3 success:
• Pamrevlumab offers no value.  At least one of the current SoCs is widely expected to go generic before 


pamrevlumab makes it to market.  With no head-to-head or combination therapy data, there is no 
reason for payors to cover pamrevlumab as an alternative or for anyone to prescribe it


• Pamrevlumab is less convenient.  Pamrevlumab requires Q3W IV administration compared to QD oral 
dosing.  Patients are more likely to prefer daily oral dosing


• Management’s decision to only run a single four-year Phase 3 trial now when two Phase 3s 
are required for approval indicates that Management shares our skepticism about IPF

Missing Trial Results Likely Due to Missing Efficacy


• FibroGen conducted an RCT comparing pamrevlumab + 
pirfenidone/nintedanib compared to placebo + pirfenidone/nintedanib. It 
was a 24 week study with an additional 4-10 weeks of screening/follow-up.  
Enrollment completed on December 16, 2016, and the trial should have 
concluded in mid-2017


• The efficacy endpoint results were never disclosed, indicating that 
pamrevlumab did not offer any benefit to patients over placebo


• This likely informed the Phase 3 trial design in which FibroGen decided to 
prohibit use of pirfenidone/nintedanib as background therapy

Prohibiting Standard-of-Care is Blatantly Unethical
• There is strong evidence that pirfenidone (and to a lesser extent, nintedanib) 


significantly increases survival for IPF patients.  It is unethical to enroll a 
placebo group where patients are denied access to these drugs.  This will 
make it very challenging to fully enroll the trial and we think it is very likely 
that FibroGen’s first Phase 3 trial will take significantly longer than the 
estimated four years to reach the primary endpoint


• Nathan et al 2017 conducted a pooled analysis of pirfenidone Phase 3 trials 
and found that the all-cause mortality hazard ratio for pirfenidone was 0.52 
(0.31, 0.87) 


• Lancaster et al 2019 conducted a pooled analysis of nintedanib Phase 2/3 
trials and found that the all-cause mortality hazard ratio for nintedanib was 
0.70 (0.46, 1.08)

• The FLORA trial was a Phase 2a study in which Galapagos enrolled 23

• GLPG1690 achieved a mean increase in FVC of 25 mL compared to a -70 mL 
decline in FVC in the control group (Maher et al 2018, ppFVC not provided)


• While the FLORA trial excluded patients on pirfenidone/nintedanib, the two

PRM-151 Succeeded in IPF With Background Therapy


• PRM-151 is recombinant human serum amyloid P, and the theory behind its 
use in fibrosis is that PRM-151 can prevent differentiation of cells into M2-
macrophages and fibrocytes, reducing fibrosis in patients


• The Phase 2 results for PRM-151 (Raghu et al 2018) show that it produced a 
statistically significant benefit in ppFVC in patients allowed background 
pirfenidone/nintedanib, with 48% lower decline in ppFVC over 28 weeks (-
2.5% vs -4.8%, p = 0.001)


• 78% of enrolled patients were receiving concurrent pirfenidone or 
nintedanib


• 95% (74/78) of PRM-151 patients completed treatment compared to 95% 
(37/39) of control patients and SAEs occurred in 8% of PRM-151 patients 
and 10% of control patients, indicating that the drug was well-tolerated

Needs Two Phase 3 Trials For Approval…Only Running One
• As is clear from precedents pirfenidone/nintedanib and GLPG1690, two 


pivotal trials are required for IPF approval.  FibroGen is only running one: the 
ZEPHYRUS trial
• Galapagos is running two concurrent Phase 3 trials (ISABELA1 and ISABELA2) for 


GLPG1690
• InterMune conducted three Phase 3 trials for pirfenidone in IPF (one of which failed 


to achieve primary efficacy endpoint)
• Boehringer Ingelheim conducted two Phase 3 trials for nintedanib in IPF 


• Running a single trial now implies that Management will wait for that trial to 
read out before deciding on a second Phase 3 trial.  A projected 2023 initial 
Phase 3 readout and a 4-year estimated trial timeline puts earliest potential 
FDA approval for pamrevlumab in IPF at nearly a decade from today


• The decision to only run one trial in the face of multiple competitors speaks 
to a major lack of confidence in pamrevlumab’s IPF prospects

Point #3: No Evidence Pamrevlumab Works in DMD


• FibroGen presented “preliminary” results of its uncontrolled Phase 2 
Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) study at PPMD on June 28, 2019


• The trial began recruiting in November 2015 and enrollment was completed in 
April 2018.  All patients had been enrolled >1 year by June 2019


• Virtually no actual data was shared in the presentation.  FibroGen instead 
shared abstract comparisons with historical precedents without revealing actual 
trial datapoints from the pamrevlumab DMD trial in an apparent attempt to 
imply efficacy without proving efficacy

PLAINVIEW


Primary Endpoint & Most Secondary Endpoints Not Disclosed


• The trial description for pamrevlumab in DMD lists a primary endpoint 
(annual change in FVC) and 12 secondary endpoints


• FibroGen did not disclose the primary endpoint change– other than to say 
that change in ppFVC was higher than the change in ppFVC seen in a 
selected prior DMD publication


• Only two of the 12 secondary endpoints were disclosed (LVEF and change in 
performance of upper limbs), though other metrics were said to be higher or 
lower than arbitrary historical precedents


• If the data were favorable, FibroGen would have shared it instead of making 
abstract comparisons with favorable historical precedents and withholding 
numerical data.  All patients had been enrolled in the trial >1 year as of April 
2019; there should have been ample data to share in June 2019

Cherry-Picking Example


• It’s been known since 1989 (see Mendell et al 1989) that glucocorticoid 
steroid treatment delays muscle loss and the onset of respiratory decline in 
DMD patients


• In FibroGen’s trial, 100% of the patients were given steroids (see Slide 7 of 
the PPMD presentation)


• FibroGen compared its ppFEV1 endpoint with the DELOS trial publication 
(Meier et al 2017), a trial in which patients were prohibited from taking 
glucocorticoids


• Cross-trial differences such as baseline characteristics and background 
medications make the comparisons FibroGen provided completely 
meaningless

Point #4: Pamrevlumab Doesn’t Work in Pancreatic Cancer 


• FibroGen’s ASCO 2018 poster showed that patients in the pamrevlumab arm 
achieved a 20.8% (5/24) ORR vs. 23.1% (3/13) ORR in the control arm


• “Eligibility for surgical resection” is not a valid primary endpoint and FibroGen’s 
focus on the metric is classic data-mining misdirection in a small-N trial.  
Legitimate endpoints are ORR, PFS, and OS.  PFS and OS were listed among the 
trial efficacy endpoints, but were conspicuously absent from all disclosures 
indicating that, like ORR, pamrevlumab showed no benefit in PFS and OS


• A large meta-analysis (Gillen et al 2010) showed a near-identical rate of surgical 
resection following chemotherapy as pamrevlumab + chemotherapy achieved 
in FibroGen’s trial (33.2% vs 33.3%) – cementing that it is highly unlikely 
pamrevlumab offers any benefit


• The scientific thesis behind using pamrevlumab in pancreatic cancer (targeting 
the stroma) has been tried multiple times in pancreatic cancer and never 
succeeded

Clinical Data Shows No ORR Benefit in Pancreatic Cancer
• The RECIST ORR was 20.8% (5/24) in the pamrevlumab arm and 23.1% 


(3/13) in the control arm, as shown in FibroGen’s ASCO 2018 poster


• ORR is especially significant considering that the trial enrolled patients with 
localized pancreatic cancer– if a drug doesn’t appear to have an additive 
impact on the target tumor in a localized cancer then it is almost certainly 
accomplishing nothing


• PFS and OS were listed among the efficacy endpoints but were never 
disclosed, strongly indicating that, like ORR, pamrevlumab showed no 
benefit in PFS or OS


• Instead of disclosing ORR/PFS/OS in its press release, FibroGen only 
disclosed the proportion of patients who achieved surgical resection in the 
trial for each group: a blatant attempt at data mining to misdirect investors

PLAINVIEW


Resection Rate On Par With Historical Precedent
• In the Phase 1/2 pancreatic cancer trial, resection was achieved in 33.3% 


(8/24) of the pamrevlumab group patients compared to 7.7% (1/13) of 
control group


• Gillen et al 2010 conducted a meta-analysis of 111 studies (n=4,394) and 
found that among pancreatic cancer patients who were initially deemed 
non-resectable, 33.2% received resection following chemotherapy– nearly 
identical to the 33.3% achieved in the pamrevlumab trial


• We also note that FibroGen’s ASCO poster indicates that none of the three 
patients in the control arm who saw RECIST responses were deemed eligible 
for resection.  This seems unlikely unless the RECIST responses were 
significant enough that resection no longer made sense for those patients–
in which case the resection rate in the control group is ironically obscured by 
efficacy

FibroGen’s Pancreatic Cancer Theory
• The theory behind combining 


pamrevlumab with chemotherapy is 
that the reason outlook is so bleak 
for pancreatic cancer patients is 
because the exceptionally dense 
extracellular matrix associated with 
pancreatic cancer blocks a 
chemotherapeutic or immune 
response in those patients


• However, it is widely thought that 
the principal culprit behind the 
enhanced ECM is a constitutively 
active hedgehog signaling pathway, 
not CTGF

Prior Attempts to Target Stroma in Pancreatic Cancer Have Failed


• Given that the hedgehog pathway is thought to be the principal driver of 
pancreatic cancer stroma growth, prior drugs have attempted to disrupt the 
hedgehog pathway with hedgehog inhibitors


• All of them have failed in the clinic:
• Vismodegib (GDC-0449): Showed no benefit in ORR, PFS, or OS in an N=106 RCT trial 


presented at ASCO 2013


• Saridegib (IPI-926): Company halted pancreatic cancer trial prematurely after 
preliminary interim analysis showed a “difference in survival favoring the placebo plus 
gemcitabine arm due to a higher rate of progressive disease in the saridegib plus 
gemcitabine arm.”


• M402: Pancreatic cancer trial was terminated following interim futility analysis

Concluding Thoughts & Looking Forward
PLAINVIEW


Concluding Thoughts – Roxadustat
• The problem with HIF-PH inhibitors is that they are not as specific to 


erythropoiesis as EPO and have potent off-target effects
• Clinical data supports this, with higher MACE, mortality, and dropout rates 


reported across the board for roxadustat, vadadustat, and daprodustat
• We believe roxadustat missed the primary safety endpoints for both DD-CKD and 


NDD-CKD, and based on prior MACE data and FibroGen’s reticence, it was 
probably by a wide margin


• MACE+ was manipulated by prohibiting IV iron in both DD-CKD and NDD-CKD and 
using a placebo comparator in NDD-CKD to increase anemia rates in the control 
groups.  It would be naïve to think that a regulatory agency would ignore a 
significant MACE safety signal because of MACE+ even if the trials had not been 
rigged to increase “+” events in the control groups


• Given its apparent MACE safety inferiority to EPO, we believe roxadustat will be 
rejected in the US/EU and that it is only a matter of time until roxadustat is pulled 
from market in China/Japan.  Once the safety data becomes public, no ethical 
doctor will prescribe it


102Concluding Thoughts & Looking Forward
PLAINVIEW


Concluding Thoughts – Pamrevlumab
• Research not sponsored by FibroGen indicates that CTGF is simply not a principal 


mediator of fibrosis, and 16 years of drug trials has provided little to refute that 
thesis


• The IPF Phase 3 trial design makes pamrevlumab an impossible sell even if it 
works; by prohibiting background therapy and comparing pamrevlumab to 
placebo, there will be no evidence of superiority or additive benefit to the current 
standard of care (pirfenidone/nintedanib), one or both of will likely be generic by 
the time FibroGen’s drug makes it to market.  Further, the decision to only run a 
single Phase 3 trial now means that in an optimal scenario, pamrevlumab might 
make it to market a decade from now


• We do not believe pamrevlumab works in pancreatic cancer given the similar ORR 
between groups in the Phase 2 trial, failure to disclose PFS/OS, and history of 
failures for similar strategies targeting the stroma


• With 3.5 years of clinical data and virtually no clinical endpoint data disclosed, we 
do not believe pamrevlumab works in DMD


Concluding Thoughts & Looking Forward 103
PLAINVIEW


FibroGen Management’s Unscrupulous Practices
• Selective disclosure to manipulate shareholder perception


• Withheld key MACE hazard ratios and instead made misleading disclosures about the pooled safety 
profile of roxadustat engineered to create the illusion that roxadustat succeeded where it failed


• Failed to mention ORR/PFS/OS for pamrevlumab in pancreatic cancer press release, and instead 
focused on an obscure metric where pamrevlumab happened to outperform placebo by chance


• Failed to disclose the actual clinical endpoints in the DMD trial, and instead provided abstract and 
useless cross-trial comparisons


• Failed to disclose the efficacy endpoint results of the IPF trial comparing pamrevlumab + SoC vs. 
placebo + SoC


• Unethical trial design to artificially inflate results
• Prohibiting IV iron in the roxadustat trials in order to try to create the illusion of efficacy benefit over 


the control arm as well as inflate relative safety.  This forced higher EPO dosing in control groups which 
has been unequivocally shown to lead to worse safety outcomes


• Prohibiting background therapy and using a placebo control in the IPF trials despite clear evidence of 
survival benefit from standard-of-care pirfenidone/nintedanib


• Pure dishonesty
• Claimed to be “encouraged” by results from pamrevlumab’s HBV trial in February 2016 despite having 


already terminated the trial for futility eight months prior
• Claimed MACE was “trending favorably” and blamed FDA/AstraZeneca for lack of MACE HR disclosure

November 8 from 2:00 to 2:15 PM


• FibroGen indicated in its Q2 2019 press release that it would be submitting 
the US NDA for roxadustat in October 2019 with the European MAA 
following soon after


• If the FDA accepts the roxadustat NDA, an advisory committee meeting for 
roxadustat will likely be scheduled for mid-late 2020


• Pamrevlumab readouts:
• Pancreatic Cancer Phase 3 trial: primary completion estimated at September 2022


• IPF Phase 3 trial: primary completion estimated at March 2023

US Phase 2 DD-CKD Trial (Provenzano 2016, 2/2) 
• There were 3 deaths in the roxadustat group, which were described on pp. 7-8 of 


Provenzano et al 2016.  None of which were attributed to patients who also experienced 
myocardial infarction or stroke and therefore all three are separate MACE incidents:


Three roxadustat-treated participants died during the study: a 68-year-old man with known 
heart failure and coronary and peripheral arterial disease had an unwitnessed death, a 77-
year-old man with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and a 58-year-old 
man with preexisting allergy to dialysis and cardiovascular disease (acute myocardial 
infarction, stent, and transient ischemic attacks) prior to enrollment who presented volume 
overloaded with respiratory failure in whom dialysis was delayed, leading to cardiac arrest.


• We include all three deaths in our MACE tally.  As we noted on slides 62-63, Kiriakidis et 
al 2017 showed that roxadustat and other HIF-PH inhibitors compromise immune systems 
by blocking the complement pathway, and the study Schindler et al 2016 found that HIF-
PH inhibition in septic mice led to significantly higher mortality rates. We think it is very 
possible that the sepsis death was drug-related

US Phase 2 ID-CKD (Besarab 2016, 2/2)
• Two patients on roxadustat died in the ID-CKD trial. 


• Deaths are discussed on pp. 1228-1229 of publication:


Two patients died: one during treatment and one during follow-up. Both deaths were 
determined by the investigators as unrelated to roxadustat. A 67-year-old patient receiving 
PD with a long history of hypertension was found dead at home (suspected cause: acute 
heart failure) 5 days after last roxadustat dose taken on study day 26. A 75-year-old patient 
in the no-iron cohort with a history of hypertension, ischemic and congestive heart disease, 
and cor pulmonale from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease responded to initial 
therapy; week 8 Hb levels were 10.4 g/dl (dose of 1.33 mg/kg). The patient was hospitalized 
on day 72 for worsening heart failure and began receiving warfarin for atrial fibrillation. 
Last roxadustat dose was given on day 84 (end of treatment). On day 85, the patient’s Hb 
dropped from 9.9 to 5.5 g/dl from acute gastric ulcer bleeding, which led to two red blood 
cell transfusions. Despite these transfusions, acute myocardial infarction occurred on day 
89. The patient died the next day.


• We include both patients in our tally of deaths; the first patient died while on the study 
drug and the second patient’s death was apparently driven by the sharp drop in Hb which 
occurred immediately after ceasing roxadustat
