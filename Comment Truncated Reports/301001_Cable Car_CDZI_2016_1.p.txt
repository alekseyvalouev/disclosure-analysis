Concentrated, hedged value investing


Dirty Water 
This entry was posted in All Ideas  and tagged CDZI FOIA short positions short selling  on October 19, 2016.


Disclosure: Short Cadiz (CDZI). This post expresses personal opinion about the company’s political
strategy. It is not an investment thesis. Cable Car has no relationship with any of the individuals
mentioned herein.


When a public company attacks a short seller, buyer beware.


After years of litigation and bureaucratic wrangling, management’s mounting frustration with the
drawn-out approval process for the Cadiz water project is understandable. Proponents of the
company’s increasingly long-shot project must have been upset by the October 2015 Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) decision preventing it from using an obscure loophole to sidestep a federal
environmental review.


Under the circumstances, Cadiz’ aggressive and expensive political response could be forgivable.
However, the company’s August 2016 decision to engage in a coordinated smear campaign against
an investor and a junior BLM staffer was unfair. The company’s disappointment at political setbacks
does not justify public character assassination, nor does Cadiz advance its cause by making
unfounded accusations.


Through a FOIA request, Cadiz obtained a series of emails between a BLM employee and Thomas
McGannon, a partner at an investment adviser researching the water project. Cadiz issued a press
release claiming the emails revealed the BLM decision “lacked objectivity” and provided the
documents to the Wall Street Journal, peddling a thoroughly biased interpretation that accused the
BLM and Mr. McGannon of impropriety. Perhaps swayed by its own political preferences (Senator
Diane Feinstein, D-CA, is the lead opponent of the Cadiz project), the Journal published an

unconscionable editorial, “The Pipeline and the Short Seller,” that unjustifiably accused Mr.
McGannon of insider trading. The editorial noted that Cadiz provided the emails to the author, and
Cadiz quickly amplified the editorial with another press release.


Call for retraction


Investors more accustomed to the investigative journalism the Journal is known for should be
offended by the use of its mouthpiece for a company with a history of stock promotion at the
expense of the reputation of a member of the investment community. I believe the Wall Street Journal
owes Mr. McGannon an apology and retraction for its arguably defamatory editorial. The editorial
falsely stated that “one Cadiz investor had inside information that could have allowed him to make a
killing” and that the BLM “shared non-public information” with him.


In my opinion, the information exchanged in the emails was neither material nor non-public. Parts of
the exchange sought informal views on whether proposed project modifications would be subject to
BLM jurisdiction, not any indication of how the BLM might rule on an alternative. The rest concerned
primarily procedural updates on the timing of BLM deliberations, not any indication of the likely
outcome.


Administrative process timelines are a matter of public record. While agencies have FOIA procedures
for releasing more extensive material including internal documents, which are also public information,
it is entirely proper for government employees to share quotidian process updates with any member
of the public who calls or writes to ask. Investors routinely interact with government agencies in this
manner. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with requesting information that an agency can choose
not to release. Erik Pignata, the BLM employee with whom Mr. McGannon corresponded, made clear
in one email that he could share only scheduling details, not the outcome of internal BLM
discussions.


The Journal also makes hay of the time elapsed between emails and the fact that Mr. McGannon and
Mr. Pignata also spoke on the phone. This amounts to an entirely unsubstantiated suggestion that the
BLM FOIA office broke the law by failing to release relevant records. There is nothing in the FOIA
response that suggests any emails are missing. And while it is theoretically possible that a phone
conversation could have revealed non-public information, there is no evidence whatsoever for such
an inflammatory suggestion.


According to Cadiz, the company’s requests for status updates from the BLM went unanswered. If
their correspondence was also directed to Mr. Pignata and if he did not provide timeline details to
Cadiz, he erred in not being equally responsive. Yet despite Mr. McGannon’s expression of opinions,
there is nothing in the messages that indicates any substantive bias against the project from Mr.
Pignata or his superiors at the BLM. Only a single comment from Mr. Pignata, after the decision was
announced, implied that one controversial aspect of the local environmental review might have been
“shady.”

The editorial was published in August, but I’m just now writing about it because it took time to receive
a reply to my own FOIA request. I obtained the same series of emails by requesting the response
provided to Cadiz. I am publishing that response in full here, as the Journal might have done instead
of selectively quoting out of context. In my view, Mr. McGannon is at most guilty of being a bit
overeager and irritating in his persistence, but you can be the judge of that for yourself:


 Read the emails


Why wade in?


Character is everything in the investment management industry. Even the whiff of impropriety, no
matter how unfounded an accusation of wrongdoing, has been known to damage careers, prompting
job losses and even investor redemptions. Publicly accusing an investor of misappropriating private
information is particularly invidious, as it plays to popular misconceptions about what actually
constitutes criminal insider trading. The reputational damage is done by the mere suggestion of
cheating. The Journal editorial would implicitly criminalize a great deal of routine due diligence.


While I am wary of criticizing a company as litigious as Cadiz, I feel strongly that the public shaming
of a fellow investor is unjust. I regularly seek public information from government agencies, as do my
peers in investment research and investigative journalism. That is not wrong, and it should not be
portrayed as being somehow insidious. Irrespective of the ultimate approval status of the Cadiz water
project and Cable Car’s investment outcome, Cadiz sets a dangerous precedent.


As if the risks of short selling were not high enough, Cadiz has introduced the added possibility of the
news media and even Congress (see below) being enlisted in a campaign of reputational damage
against critics. Based solely on the project economics and its history, a large number of short sellers
have independently reached the same conclusions as the Pump Stopper article cited by Mr.
McGannon in one of his emails. The Pump Stopper article mentions unsuccessful attempts by the
author to contact Cadiz as well as FOIA requests, which are publicly available. These imply that Cadiz
was able to determine the identity of the article’s author, strongly suggesting that the campaign
against Mr. McGannon was retaliatory in nature. The Journal should have known better than to get
involved.


I have never knowingly interacted with Mr. McGannon, and I do not know if he was the source of the
anonymous report. I know nothing of his character. However, I think it manifestly unfair for an
individual’s reputation to be tarnished in this manner.


Cadiz protests too much


What passes for acceptable mudslinging in the corridors of Washington can be more damaging to
non-politicians. Perhaps the reason for the company’s willingness to attack the BLM and a third-party
investor is that Cadiz and its legal counsel/part-time CEO, Scott Slater, are no strangers to lobbying
and backroom politics.

Mr. Slater is a shareholder of the law firm of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP (BHFS), which has
been the company’s primary legal services provider since he joined as General Counsel in
2008. BHFS has a large corporate and government relations practice that includes significant
lobbying work. The firm also operates a political action committee funded by shareholders of the
firm, BHFS-E, PC PAC. The PAC makes about $400,000 of bipartisan contributions per election
cycle.


Although Mr. Slater became CEO in 2013, he remains employed by BHFS and free to provide other
services for them while collecting a $300,000 annual salary from Cadiz. On top of Mr. Slater’s salary,
Cadiz pays an additional $300,000 annual retainer to BHFS for legal services relating to the project.


The retainer is a minimum commitment; the actual fees paid to BHFS by Cadiz have not been
disclosed in aggregate but are considerably higher. For example, federal filings show Cadiz makes a
$110,000 quarterly payment to BHFS for lobbying representation alone, while BHFS has
simultaneously represented the company in various legal challenges to the project. Cadiz lobbying
payments to BHFS began in Q4 2010 and have ranged from $400,000-440,000 every year since. In
total, CDZI shareholders have compensated BHFS at least $2.4 million through June 2016 just for
representation in Washington, although in five quarters the disclosures indicated that BHFS was
compensated despite performing no lobbying activity.


What’s more, BHFS is eligible to receive incentive compensation based on project approval
milestones. The firm has already earned three incentive awards since 2009, a total of 259,312 shares
worth over $1.8 million at current market prices. They are eligible to receive a further 200,000 shares
worth over $1.4 million upon achievement of additional milestones.


Mr. Slater’s unique employment situation makes BHFS a related party to Cadiz, a status that has
been omitted from the related party disclosures in the company’s annual reports and proxy filings.
Curiously, it was not until the second quarter 10-Q filed on August 8, 2016 that the company explicitly
acknowledged BHFS as a related party in an SEC filing. I will leave it to securities lawyers to debate
whether item 404(a) of regulation S-K provided a sufficient exemption from disclosing the total
payments to BHFS.


CDZI, a company with only 10 full-time equivalent employees, spent $12.6 million on general and
administrative expenses excluding stock-based compensation in 2015 and $9.0 million in 2014.
Shareholders ought to know just how much of that went to Mr. Slater’s law firm.


Statement on apparent bias


Readers familiar with CDZI will have noticed that I have not yet mentioned the letters sent by Jason
Chaffetz (R-UT) of the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee to
the BLM and Whetstone Capital. Partly that is because the committee’s activities appear to be rather
more focused at the moment on another manufactured government email controversy and are
unlikely to go anywhere. Yet the letters present the same concerns as the Cadiz press releases and

Journal editorial. They also raise the separate question of why a Congressional committee would so
readily adopt a financially interested company’s misleading insinuations of wrongdoing when
describing innocuous correspondence.


It is probably only a coincidence that Representative Chaffetz has received 3 donations totaling
$5,000 from BHFS-E, PC PAC. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), his co-signer, received $1,000 from the PAC
in 2013.


According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Slater has been an unusually prolific donor to
politicians. He has given at least $78,977 of his personal funds to political committees and
candidates for federal elective office, including $26,817 through the BHFS-E, PC PAC. I do not wish
to insinuate that there has been any explicit quid pro quo from politicians in response to Mr. Slater’s
or the PAC’s donations. Nevertheless, political contributions are a potential source of bias. The
significant flow funds from CDZI investors to BHFS makes their political action activities important to
consider as well.


Cadiz has focused its lobbying efforts during the current session on trying to insert an appropriations
rider that would nullify the BLM decision. These efforts were primarily oriented toward Department of
Interior appropriations legislation, which eventually passed the House but has been deferred to the
lame-duck session by the most recent continuing resolution. I believe the language is highly unlikely
to become law due to Senator Feinstein’s continuing opposition.


Interestingly, Cadiz’ second quarter lobbying disclosure form for BHFS added a new category of
lobbying activities relating to the “Senate FAA authorization bill and amendments.” Obviously, the
FAA reauthorization bill had nothing to do with water in the California desert, but BHFS evidently tried
unsuccessfully to add a rider to that legislation sometime during the second quarter.


The Senate version of the bill was sponsored by John Thune (R-SD), Chair of the Commerce,
Science, and Transportation committee. Mr. Slater donated $1,000 to Senator Thune on June 1,
2016, his first and only donation to the Senator. BHFS had not supported him since 2010. Senator
Gary Peters (D-MI), a junior member of the committee who had not received any money from BHFS
since 2011, made headlines in March for inserting other unrelated amendments into the legislation.
On May 15, 2016, Mr. Slater donated $1,000 to Senator Peters. Neither senator faces a competitive
reelection contest at the moment, giving Mr. Slater’s donations the appearance of an overt attempt to
gain influence during concomitant lobbying efforts sponsored by his company.


Cadiz has also tried to win support from California’s federal Congressional delegation. Tim Sheehan,
Cadiz CFO, supported Wendy’s Greuel’s unsuccessful House bid in 2014. Richard Stoddard, former
CEO, donated to John Tavaglione’s ill-fated 2012 bid. Tavaglione is a Riverside county supervisor
who has supported the project publicly. Both candidates for Barbara Boxer’s Senate seat this year
have received contributions from either Mr. Slater or Keith Brackpool, Cadiz’ board chairman. To be
fair, receipt of donations does not guarantee preferential treatment; even Senator Feinstein received
$4,500 from the BHFS-E, PC PAC in 2012 (though nothing since).

In all, 19 current and former representatives are listed by the company on its most recent project
support list. No doubt Cadiz has also supported local officials on the list as well, but since FEC data
is more readily available, consider just the listed federal supporters of the Cadiz water project. At
least 10 of these representatives have accepted money from Cadiz insiders through the second
quarter of 2016:

$CDZI is an unreal stock. Cadiz is not a company, it is just a dream. And shareholders have
to wake up!


Shorting the stock is a civil act.


Thanks for your great job Jacob.

Shortseller is just an official sounding name for a confidence artist or simply put
professional scammer. 


it is simply beyond comprehension that someone may actively pusue a “career” in shortselling or lying for
money. 
We have lawers already but at least they don’t try to portray themselves as the defenders of investors and truth
seekers.
