Medidata: Why We Went Long And Why IBM Might Acquire It
Top Idea | Jul. 12, 2016 5:00 AM ET31 comments

Summary


Most compelling relative valuation in all enterprise SAAS.


Trading at nearly half valuation on EV/rev basis of vertical life sciences SAAS peer
Veeva Systems.


Extremely impressive needle-moving competitive large pharma platform wins
improve longer-term revenue growth visibility; yet, stock trading of recent near-term
lackluster revenue momentum.


Ideal target for IBM Watson Health based on recent deals in the space; would
comfortably command at least a 35% premium to current share price.


Earlier this year, we published a report explaining why we turned around and went long on
former SAAS short Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV). Our thesis had a lot to do with relative
valuation, views on IMS's (IMS) acquisition of Cegedim, expectations that Veeva would
win Sanofi's (NYSE:SNY) CRM business, as well as our conclusion that the Dell/EMC
(EMC) deal and other M&A activity in Veeva's non-CRM businesses was benefiting it.
Since then, the stock has appreciated by over 50%, and outside of Salesforce.com
(NYSE:CRM) is the only enterprise SAAS name trading at multi-year highs. We now
believe a comparable if not arguably better investment opportunity exists in another former
vertical life sciences TAM focused short of ours in Medidata Solutions (NASDAQ:MDSO).


Medidata: Revisiting the Short Thesis


When we published our short thesis on Medidata in early 2015, the stock was trading
around $50. We argued that Medidata's claims of a $10+ bln TAM were drastically
overstated. As we did with our Veeva TAM analysis, we dissected the space and
conclusively proved that Medidata's realistically attributable TAM was probably 75-80%
lower. Based on this analysis, we concluded revenue growth would start to slow and that
the stock would rerate to around a fair value of $32. After a somewhat bizarre and brief
surge in the stock a few weeks after we published our report, things settled down and our
thesis eventually played itself out. Management has spent the better part of past four
quarters disappointing the Street. In its most recent Q1 report, it achieved only 14%
subscription revenue growth and recorded a 2% yr/yr decline in billings. Now, to be clear,

part of this weakness has to do with the nature of the large platform deals it is signing and
how revenue ramps, and that is actually part of the opportunity we see in going long here.
However, there is no denying that from a TAM standpoint, there are serious questions
marks on how at 5% penetration sub revenue is now growing at only 14%.


So why have we decided to go long this stock?


Our bullish thesis on Medidata boils down to three very simple and generally related
arguments


1) An extremely compelling relative valuation


2) Improving competitive position and future outlook in context of a stock that is overly
discounting near-term revenue momentum weakness


3) SAAS consolidation and industry trends making Medidata an attractive takeover target


Medidata's Relative Valuation as a Vertical Life Science SAAS is the Most
Compelling it has Ever Been


Our most notable reason for going long Medidata shares here is the massive discount the
stock now trades at when compared to its vertical life sciences peer Veeva Systems. At 5x
EV/EST 2016 revenue, Medidata is trading at a huge discount to vertical SAAS peer
Veeva, which is at 9.7x EV/EST 2016 Revenue. This 94% premium is the widest these
two names have traded since we started following them. This gap is completely
unjustified, and presents an exceptional pair trade opportunity for any long/short investor.
In fact, we are hard pressed to consider a pair trade that could be a nicer match than this
in the whole tech sector. There are reasons for this disparity between the two names that
we will get into shortly, but considering the similar margin profiles of both and subscription
revenue run rates, even a surface glance at this pair trade should jump out at the most
skeptical of investors.


Medidata's Recent Competitive Wins and Improving Future Outlook Are Not being
Reflected in the Current Share Price


While a cursory numbers analysis would indicate this pair trade makes a lot of sense,
there can often be a reason for such a gap that might in fact be justifiable. A closer
examination of Medidata versus Veeva will show that VEEV is expected to grow total
revenue at 27% this year versus 18% for Medidata (If you back out Veeva's Zinc
acquisition's expected revenue contribution for the year, the numbers will look more like
21% vs. 18%). Now this disparity may warrant a premium of sorts, but obviously nowhere

near the gap that currently exists. However, we actually think the drill down into a pair
trade case here is uniquely more compelling than an initial analysis would provide. When
compared to Medidata, the market right now is drastically overpaying for Veeva's revenue
growth and TAM penetration in the life sciences vertical. This is because Veeva has seen
the benefit of multiple large CRM deployments as well as initial easy pickings in Vault
materialize into revenue in recent quarters. This is the nature of a vertical business.


Once you deploy a large top 10 or top 20 pharma, you get a nice step function boost in
your revenue. Of course, the problem here is that Veeva is now fully penetrated in large
pharma from a CRM customer standpoint. When we say fully penetrated, we mean 100%;
there are literally no more notable flags for it to win in large pharma. Now contrast this
against Medidata in top 25 pharma where it has recently won Boehringer Ingelheim,
Bristol-Myers Squib (NYSE:BMY), and a significant platform expansion deal with Celgene
(NASDAQ:CELG). That's three major top 25 wins in the last six months for the company
that are currently not meaningfully contributing to the top line. This is of course notable
because when you break down annual guidance, it will go from roughly 14% growth for
the first three quarters of the year to potentially in excess of 30% by Q4 as these new
large deals start contributing some meaningful revenue. Also, remember in contrast to
Veeva in CRM, Medidata's platform wins in top 25 pharma ramp much slower as
deployment goes beyond simply getting a piece of software in a sales reps hand in one
particular geography. So there is very decent embedded upside here that is also being
ignored by the market.


Now how much upside you want to believe in here depends on how much stock you put
into management's ongoing TAM ramp argument. But no matter how skeptical you are,
there is no denying that annual dollar value for these large deals ramps significantly from
year 1 to 5. We are assuming in the 2x range though those who want to be extremely
optimistic can subscribe to management's arguments of up 3-4x. Regardless of the view
you take, when compared to Veeva's top 25 pharma deal wins and where they are at
revenue contribution wise in their life cycle, the market right now is drastically
undervaluing Medidata. Or conversely you could argue drastically overvaluing Veeva yet
again! What's interesting about this is when you break out consensus estimates for 2017,
that's exactly what you get as the two names are expected to grow their top lines at the
same rate.


So, we aren't exactly making a surprise argument here as far as the numbers go. In fact,
we'd argue that there is probably decent upside to Medidata's 2017 revenue estimates
and some downside to Veeva's based on our knowledge of the space and what we expect

going forward. This is because Medidata has more potential headroom in top 25 pharma
for EDC deal wins going forward versus Veeva in its comparable core TAM in CRM where
it is fully penetrated, and because outside of EDC, Medidata is still pretty nascent in its
broader clinical platform offerings versus the revenue penetration Veeva has achieved in
content management. Also, remember that while there is about a 10% overall revenue
disparity between these two, they are literally almost identical in scale when measured by
the all important subscription revenue. In fact, if you back out the Zinc contribution last
quarter, these two were roughly both generating exactly $90 million in life sciences vertical
SAAS subscription revenue.


Yet, Veeva is now somehow twice as big as Medidata????


Now, top this all off with the fact that Medidata has a new CFO comfortably in place, is
taking more conservative approach to guidance after nearly two years of hiccups, and has
reorganized its sales organization.


Which company would you rather be long?


As an investor going forward, we are extremely comfortable that at the current share price
risk/reward has now shifted in favor of positive catalyst stock surprises versus negative
ones for the foreseeable future.


A SAAS Consolidation Wave Means Medidata is Now an Ideal Takeover Candidate


One variable that is always difficult to account for in SAAS land is the sector multiple and
broader sentiment towards the space. When we published on Veeva earlier this year,
SAAS multiples proceeded to completely implode over the following few weeks. This is of
course why we love relative valuation pair trades in this space so much. Predicting where
multiples are heading for the broader growth group in tech is virtually impossible. But
every now and then, there are outliers that can be exploited. We have done this with
Veeva in both directions, Salesforce/Workday (NYSE:WDAY), Nvidia
(NASDAQ:NVDA)/Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), and Ultimate Software
(NASDAQ:ULTI)/Workday in the past few years as well to a small degree with
Cornerstone (NASDAQ:CSOD) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). And while we believe
Medidata/Veeva is now another classical example of such an opportunity, we think the
recent consolidation wave in the SAAS and tech space makes it even more compelling.


Big tech has gone shopping again, and we believe there are going to be several more
deals in the SAAS space before the year is out. As far as Medidata goes, we think at
current prices, it is by far one of the more compelling targets out there. Unlike Veeva, it's

not deriving the bulk of its revenues as a value added reseller of a larger SAAS company's
platform like Salesforce.com. Thus, it has multiple potential suitors, and at current
multiples, arguably a few very motivated ones.


The most notable suitor that jumps out at this juncture is IBM (NYSE:IBM). Big blue has
gone on a mini shopping spree in the healthcare-related technology space. Over the past
year, it has spent in excess of $4 billion acquiring Merge Healthcare, Truven Health, and
Phytel. These deals all have the intention of boosting IBM's Watson Health Analytics
offering, which, of course, is what makes Medidata so interesting here. Medidata's
management has been selling the life sciences vertical big data analytics story to the
Street for the past few years, and has increasingly bolstered its offerings in areas related
to analytics-like risk-based monitoring. Thus, it does not require a large stretch of the
imagination to see why IBM would be interested in acquiring a SAAS company whose
clinical trial data platform is now being used by 17/25 of the world's largest pharmaceutical
companies, but that doesn't seem to be the only angle here.


IBM paid 4.8x trailing EV/REV for Merge Healthcare. That's pretty remarkable for a niche
traditional software company whose revenue declined 8% the previous year. It's also
pretty interesting when you consider a fifth of this business is in the EDC broader clinical
trial software/services Medidata offers. Not that Merge can really be considered a MDSO
competitor here as it is much more of a small-scale player in the EDC/clinical software
space, but still tough overlap to ignore. That aside, the real story here is IBM decided to
pay up for Merge because of its role as a software provider for medical images. By
acquiring Merge, whose software has processed over 30 billion medical images, IBM has
opened up Watson to potentially AI-driven health-related image analysis as well as
broader personalized healthcare services. Merge customers will now be able to cross
reference medical image data against broader Watson Health-related data assets for
individual patients and similar patient populations. So clearly this has a lot more to do with
bolstering the Watson data set versus simply acquiring a medical image processing
software provider. Then, IBM went and paid $2.6 billion for Truven Health Analytics' 215
million patient lives data set, which informs benefits decisions for 33% of Americans.
That's 6x EV/REV for a high-single-digit revenue growth established health data provider.


So, one has to wonder what exactly Medidata is worth to IBM?


Its platform already captures all the data related to a patient in a clinical trial. This includes
procedures, lab data, patient reported outcomes, medical device data, and now even
personal mobile health data. As things stand, roughly 60% of electronically captured
clinical trials on the planet are on the Medidata platform. So, there is no denying that this

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3987682-medidata-went-long-ibm-might-acquire 6/16


is an ideal acquisition target for IBM Watson Health. This is mainly because the bulk of
future upside in the Medidata story is in the unique insights/analytics it can deliver to life
sciences customers because of the scale of its platform. Obviously, Watson is the ideal
platform to crunch this type of data and deliver these types of insights. You very rarely are
going to come across something this obvious that is not remotely priced into a stock. In
our view, IBM would be willing to pay at least $60 a share for Medidata and up to as much
as potentially $80 in an auction process that would most likely include Oracle
(NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP).


We think it is important to note that Oracle has refused to throw in the towel in EDC as it
did in life sciences CRM, and we think that is a reflection of the fact that strategically it
likes the future of this space more than pharma rep CRM software. Oracle paid roughly 4x
revenue in 2010 to acquire on-premise EDC competitor Phase Forward when valuations
in SAAS land were much more muted. Medidata is currently trading at an enterprise value
of roughly 5x 2016 revenue, and it's not like Larry Ellison has been shy about buying a
competitor once he failed to compete against them. That of course brings SAP into the
equation, which has so far not delved deep into this space. While SAP jumping into the
clinical data capture space probably seemed like a stretch a few years ago, you could now
argue that Medidata's broader clinical trial SAAS platform and Oracle competitive
displacements as well as increasing focus on analytics-intensive areas like RBM make it a
much more suitable target today. Also, it shouldn't require much to get these two talking as
Medidata's current CFO is the ex-CFO of SAP Business Objects and MDSO has been
using SAP Hana for real time analytics for several years now.


In any case, we still feel IBM makes the most sense. Whether that happens in the near
future remains to be seen, but as more deals are announced in the space, we expect
Medidata's valuation discount to the likes of Veeva to rapidly disappear.


How To Trade This


The SAFEST way to play this is to build a long position in Medidata and match it with a
short in Veeva. We emphasize safe because we have noticed in the past that many other
investors who have contacted us regarding short or long ideas with pairs simply refuse to
hedge. At the current multiple gap, Veeva almost appears to be operating in a different
industry. In fact, at 9.6x EV/2016 REV, Veeva is the most expensive stock in ALL of
Software. This means its carrying a higher EV/sales multiple than Workday, Splunk
(NASDAQ:SPLK), ServiceNow, Ultimate Software, Netsuite (NYSE:N), Salesforce.com,
Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), or even the recently acquired Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) with

the takeover premium included. Remember we are talking absolute multiples here and not
even growth adjusted as almost all these names are expected to grow their top lines faster
than Veeva this year and next!


EV/Rev 2016 2016 Rev consensus growth


rate


Salesforce 6.6 24%


Workday 8.5 33%


ServiceNow 7.8 36%


Netsuite 6.2 30%


Ultimate 7.8 26%


Splunk 7.2 34%


Veeva Systems 9.7 26%


Tableau (NYSE:DATA) 3.4 29%


Medidata 5 18%


Zendesk 7.6 45%


Demandware 8.3 28%


So, clearly a Veeva short here has its own merits beyond simply a pair against a Medidata
long, and should provide a perfect hedge against another SAAS sector valuation crash.
That being said, we do think the current M&A wave in the space combined with the unique
Watson Health appeal as well as record discount in Medidata shares to Veeva makes this
a pretty clear cut outright long that shouldn't leave anyone licking their wounds at these
levels. So, if you are uncomfortable shorting, our view is at the current levels, the
downside simply going outright long Medidata here is minimal.
