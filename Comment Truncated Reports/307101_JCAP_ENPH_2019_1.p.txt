Stealing from 
Tomorrow
 ‣ Stuffed: We think that Enphase is pulling forward sales and 


stuffing distribution channels in order to make sales appear 
better than they are. We have analyzed industry reports and 
estimate that an amazing seven months of inventory is sit-
ting in distribution channels, versus industry norms of about 
four to six weeks. We believe Enphase is losing market share 
in solar inverters.


 ‣ Margin boosting: Inventory build started with the installa-
tion of Enphase’s new COO in Q2 2017, who was elevated to 
CEO in September of that year. Kothandaraman’s arrival coin-
cided with the dizzying ascent of gross margins from 18% to 
34% over nine quarters in which ENPH consistently shipped 
more product than appears to have been installed. Enphase’s 
disclosures since late 2017 appear to have moved farther 
and farther from reality. The company has stopped disclosing 
key metrics and started to stonewall analysts, all the while 
awarding more shares to top management.


 ‣ Being run for the money: A last-minute bailout by a VC 
in 2016 ushered in a new set of managers who, in our opin-
ion, focused on cutting pennies from cost and handsomely 
rewarding executives without regard to company culture or 
morale. Meanwhile, former employees tell us that Ahmad 
Chatila, ex-CEO of SunEdison, who precipitated the biggest 
bankruptcy of 2016, is acting as shadow CEO.

holder of the stock.

Enphase Energy (ENPH US)


Summary


Enphase has gone from a bankruptcy risk to an ostensibly thriving enterprise in less than three years. The company ships more microin-
verters every quarter; analysts crow about its rising market share; and its 
technology is universally admired. 


Enphase has created a culture throttled by consultant-driven bean-count-
ing, in which top management is rewarded for posting heroic results quar-
ter to quarter. This short-termism would explain why ENPH, based on our 
analysis, is pulling forward sales from the future while management ap-
pears to mislead shareholders about market share. In reality, 


 ‣ Channels are stuffed to the breaking point with product
 ‣ Market share is in decline
 ‣ The company is coasting on engineering achievements contributed 


by employees who were fired or left some time ago. 


In Q2 2019 alone, we estimate that nearly three months of sales were 
pulled forward. Investors appear unaware of the disconnect between En-
phase’s reported shipments and market reality. We, on the other hand, 
recognize a pattern of increasingly poor disclosure around market share 
coupled with evasive and blustering discussions.


The most comprehensive market data in the industry shows Enphase has not 
won back share from dominant competitor SolarEdge, which explains En-
phase’s stubborn silence on this topic. Wood Mackenzie, formerly Greentech 
Media, is the gold standard for solar market share data, relied upon by groups 
like the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). Per analysis of publicly 
disclosed portions of that data, which is based on reported installations 
rather than shipments, Enphase’s organic market share (absent the SunPower 
acquisition) has declined significantly over the past two years. Enphase’s 
market share disclosures have gone from robust to nonexistent in a year and 
a half, while management has grown more evasive as time wears on.


The numbers we report exclude revenue acquired from SunPower, a deal 
that raises separate questions about management’s ability to formulate a 
sustainable growth strategy. SunPower’s share in the inverter market has 
declined since Enphase acquired the unit.


Enphase bears a raft of uninspired characters at the helm—in addition to 
an undisclosed puppetmaster, disgraced former SunEdison CEO Ahmad 
Chatila. Yet ENPH stock trades at 7.0x TTM sales, with consensus 2021E 
revenues in excess of $950 mln, an impressive 135% higher than what

culture is

consultant-
driven bean-


counting, 
while top 


management

rewards in

Enphase brings in today.1 Why would any company priced to such perfec-
tion want to spoil the fun for investors, especially when its executives have 
showered themselves with more and more cash and share compensation?


The Enphase that has emerged from reorganization is a business that 
steals from tomorrow to show profits and sales growth today. Over 19 calls 
with former employees and distribution partners, we have found a slap-
dash, incestuous, and aggressive management approach that has driven 
much of the institutional knowledge from the company. 


We want to be clear that Enphase’s legacy technology, while expensive, 
is best-in-class, and the company sits in a growing industry. The problem 
with Enphase, which is distinct from the claims raised in a September 
2019 short report by Citron Research, is that management’s poor and self-
serving choices have stripped the business bare. The continuously delayed 
launch of the next-generation IQ8/Ensemble and the problematic manu-
facturing move from China to Mexico are emblems of Enphase’s strategic 
decrepitude.


The Enphase bull case revolves around growing market share, a gifted ex-
ecutive team, and innovative R&D. We debunk these misperceptions below, 
each in turn.


The Disconnect Between Sales and Installations
ENPH’s unit shipment disclosures fail to mesh with competitors' data. 
Given Enphase management’s problematic incentive structure, we believe 
ENPH and its executives have ample motivation to cover up the truth.


The vast majority of ENPH’s microinverters sold are for residential solar 
applications, and ~75% of its revenues are in the United States.2 According-
ly, the U.S. residential market is existentially important for the company.


We extrapolate from publicly disclosed authoritative installation data from 
Wood Mackenzie—sourced directly from the participating companies, 
including Enphase—to identify the discrepancy between shipments and 
actual installations in the market. Using the most conservative assump-
tions, we conclude that Enphase has at least seven months of product sit-
ting in distributor channels that it has recognized as sold but that has not 
been installed.

We make assumptions that are favorable to the company: 


1. We benchmark shipments against annualized installations for the 
most recent quarter;


2. We apply a one-quarter lag to shipments versus installations to al-
low for time to install;


3. We assume a low proportion of U.S. sales, 60%, for the three quarters 
in which Enphase did not disclose the split with international.


Applying these assumptions, we find that the company has pulled forward 
between seven and nine months of sales.

We believe the evidence is clear: ENPH has improperly recognized seven 
months of sales.


The Numbers Just Don’t Add Up
SolarEdge's market share has grown from 40% to approximately 60% In 
two years, and mathematically, this must be at the expense of ENPH’s 
share. Tellingly, the CEO avoids any comment on market share other than 
to imply it is growing. From the last earnings call:


We are not going to give out any numbers in market share, but the 
reasons why we are gaining market share, I believe, is basically 
along the lines of our core competence is essentially the focus on 
providing the highest quality, the highest customer experience and 
basically, products like Ensemble showed innovation in our product 
innovation capability. Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman, July 30, 
2019


The 10-K on page 38 reads: 


“Our financial operating model sets gross margin, operating ex-
pense and operating income targets expressed as a percentage of 
net revenue. Our financial operating model explicitly focuses on 
profitability rather than market share.”


It is sensible to avoid talking about share, because industry data show that 
share is declining.

Tracking current management’s stated unit sales over time and translating 
them to ENPH market share puts the degree of managerial deception in 
even starker relief.

quarterly microinverter shipments, as well as the annual geographic rev-
enue breakdown. We then assume that a typical installation requires 25 
microinverters and that ASPs are roughly the same ex-U.S. as they are in 
the U.S.4 From the foregoing data points, we can estimate the number of 
ENPH installations in a given quarter. 


Wood Mackenzie has tracked the total number of U.S. residential solar instal-
lations for over a decade via its acquisition of Greentech Media, so we use this 
information to give us ENPH’s market share.5 Previous management described 
ENPH’s market share in 2016 as going from “approximately 20% in Q1 to over 
30% in Q4”, “based on third-party estimates as well as our own data.”6 Our 
methodology dovetails with this quite nicely, illustrating that management’s 
microinverter sales figures used to comport with market-share estimates:


However, digesting management’s most recent disclosures tells a much 
more unexplainable story than the Wood Mackenzie data does. ENPH’s 
market share has apparently eclipsed 45% as of Q2 2019, if the company’s 
statements are to be believed:

These numbers do not survive even basic scrutiny. ENPH would have had 
to be stealing U.S. market share from SolarEdge while squeezing out the 
cheaper, legacy competitors at the same time. Wood Mackenzie data, com-
bined with strong results from SolarEdge, contradict the notion that SEDG 
ceded share. Therefore, it can only follow that ENPH’s reported shipments 
diverge significantly from what installations would imply. The departure 
from Wood Mackenzie figures suggests that Kotharandaman and his team 
are pulling forward a significant amount of demand.


Even when using megawatts shipped instead of inverters, sensitivity 
analysis using a range of household power consumption shows that the 
assumption of 25 inverters per installation holds up reasonably well over 
time:

SolarEdge management, for its part, has openly addressed the numerical 
discrepancy, painting a stark contrast to ENPH’s haughty silence. On the 
Q2 2019 SEDG call, after laying out recent Wood Mackenzie data in detail, 
the company said (emphasis added):


“Lastly, to those who try to calculate market share from reported 
shipments, the shipment number are not representing market share 
trends as these are affected by customer inventory. I hope this will 
give you the motivation to get into the numbers of market share 
from Greentech Media rather from the shipment numbers that com-
panies reported on themselves.”7

Enphase Energy (ENPH US)


Though this commentary stops short of pointing the finger, we have laid out 
the history, characters, incentives, and computations that make it clear ENPH 
must be lying about how much product it is selling, and doing it in a big way.


How?
We cannot say how ENPH may be stuffing channels, but we suspect the 
company’s shift to sales to distributors rather than installers. Distribu-
tors now account for about 80% of sales, according to a former finance 
executive, up from 65-75% two years ago. “Definitely moving more toward 
distributors.” We believe this distributor channel could introduce a risk 
of excessive revenue recognition. Notably, installers may no longer buy 
directly from ENPH, according to our interviews, but are directed to buy 
from distributors, at a higher price. 


ENPH Management Obfuscates
In the face of mounting evidence of market saturation, Enphase’s CEO has re-
sorted to stonewalling analysts. The content of his discussion regarding mar-
ket share has dwindled to essentially nothing in the space of a year. As recent-
ly as last August, he gave concrete percentage estimates. At management’s 
most recent public appearance in July of this year, Kothandaraman declined to 
discuss market share “because we don’t look at the business like that”:


Date Event CEO Commentary


June 2018
SunPower Unit 


Acquisition


"We believe that SunPower's microinverter share 
in the U.S. in 2017 was roughly about 9% and 


Enphase is about 26% to 27%. So, on a pro forma 
basis, the 2017 market share if you combine 


both businesses would be roughly 30% to 36% 
and that is to provide you with the flavor of the 


market share."

Enphase Energy (ENPH US)


Several industry experts we spoke to held up Greentech Media [now Wood 
Mackenzie] as the gold standard in fidelity for deducing share of instal-
lations. One former Enphase employee we spoke to stated not only that 
“Greentech Media’s methodology on the whole has been very consistent” 
but that the data came straight from the horse’s mouth: “That was real data 
we were giving back to GTM.” As a result, it is confusing why Enphase 
would not want to report such an easily obtainable number as the Wood 
Mackenzie market share calculation. We encourage investors to contrast 
Enphase’s evasiveness with SolarEdge’s commentary, which is more help-
ful and nuanced by comparison, especially over time:

Who is the New Management, Anyway?


With less than $20 million of cash in the bank as of year-end 2016, ENPH 
wrangled $10 million from Cypress Semiconductor founder T.J. Rodgers 
and venture capitalist John Doerr in January 2017.8,9 Tellingly, much of this 
investment went into hiring consultants to advise ENPH on how to re-
structure the business.10


In April 2017, ENPH hired Badri Kothandaraman as its COO.11 Kothandara-
man was plucked from relative obscurity. After having spent more than 20 
years at Cypress Semiconductor, rising to the level of executive vice presi-
dent, Kothandaraman struck out on his own to make a crowdfunded charg-
ing adapter. Innocharge Solutions, LLC was incorporated in December 
2016, with its headquarters listed as a residential property in Santa Clara, 
California.12 A screenshot from Innocharge’s website conveys relatively 
modest intentions for the product:13

The accessory seems never to have made it to Kickstarter. Regardless of 
Kothandaraman’s uninspired professional history, he was appointed CEO 
of ENPH in September 2017, less than a month after the previous CEO was 
pushed out and just five months after being appointed COO of the company, 
in April 2017.14

Based on our discussions with numerous former employees, Kothandara-
man is anything but an inspired chief executive. Focused on wringing 
out costs and laying out headline numbers, Kothandaraman was de-
scribed in tyrannical terms, as a manager not keen on learning details 
and prone to angry outbursts when he received unpleasant news. A for-
mer report described him as “very aggressive” in financial statements but 
never crossing the line into improper activity. Our interviews indicated 
that Kothandaraman often demands the impossible and tends to fire 
those who can’t deliver. 


Given Kothandaraman’s middling experience level and predilection for 
bridge-burning, we learned in interviews that someone else was respon-
sible for much of the strategic decision making in the new Enphase: none 
other than Ahmad Chatila, ex-CEO of SunEdison. Enphase has hidden 
Chatila’s involvement in the company, and he serves, nominally, as a con-

sultant. However, he was described to us as a shadow CEO, attending most 
high-level meetings and often more active than the actual CEO. It is not 
hard to see why Enphase does not want to discuss why it employs the per-
son who precipitated the largest US bankruptcy of 2016.15


Meanwhile, as the turnaround progressed, and management grew more 
ebullient, some more troubling signs emerged in ENPH’s internal work-
ings. The company’s CFO resigned in May 2018, according to the compa-
ny.16 In June, ENPH replaced him with Tesla’s former Chief Accounting 
Officer, Eric Branderiz.17 Branderiz had joined Tesla through its acquisition 
of SolarCity and had been out of work since he left Tesla “for personal rea-
sons” in March 2018 after 14 months on the job.18,19

Meanwhile, in October 2018, with a year of new management, Enphase 
made another hire fresh from Tesla: Mandy Yang, who was Tesla’s world-
wide controller for over a year and a half.21 During her tenure, Tesla en-
gaged in particularly dubious revenue accounting, by, for example, using 
the sale of regulatory credits to bump up its net income, pushing out ac-
counts payable, and reducing reported costs in a highly questionable man-
ner.22 Yang and Branderiz had previously worked together at flash memory 
maker Spansion Inc., which went bankrupt in 2009.23


In January 2018, ENPH had hired the former VP of Operations at Energous 
Corporation (WATT) Jeff McNeil to run its Quality and Customer Support 
division.24 WATT is a blatant pump-and-dump, promising wireless charg-
ing, and its stock price has declined more than 80% since McNeil joined

ENPH.25 As if his mere presence were not bad enough, in April 2019, ENPH 
promoted McNeil to COO.26 Like Kotharandaman, McNeil was a long-time 
employee at Cypress.


Clubbiness and Layoffs
ENPH management’s tendency to hire old colleagues and lay off outsiders 
has rocked Enphase to the core. Multiple ex-employees highlighted that 
as time rolled on and the ranks of middle managers—virtually all of them 
ex-Cypress or ex-SunEdison—swelled, there remained fewer and fewer 
employees who actually knew how to build and test Enphase technology. 
Those who stayed on described an atmosphere in which an increasing 
number of engineers with poorer technical skills took on core product de-
sign tasks. Others who left stated they did not even have a chance to prop-
erly transition their roles before being asked to leave.


Emblematic of the disruption to the engineering organization, Enphase 
lost its VP of Engineering, Jan Klube, to home energy storage company 
Electriq Power in September 2019.27 Klube had been at his current role at 
Enphase since late 2017.28 This is one of numerous technical leaders who 
have moved on to other companies in California, taking their expertise 
with them.


Enphase is scrambling to hire additional engineers to plug skilled employ-
ee attrition. LinkedIn data shows engineering job openings have increased 
by more than a factor of 10 in the past year:29

Enphase Energy (ENPH US)


In an interview, we learned that Enphase is pursuing engineers whom it 
fired or alienated to resume doing work for the company, and many of the 
engineers had declined. This information leads us to believe that Enphase 
is scrambling for talent to stem the personnel bleed, rather than growing 
the depth of its engineering bench.


Given the forgoing, it should come as little surprise that Enphase’s next-
generation flagship microinverter, the IQ8, has been delayed multiple 
times, along with the much-touted Ensemble gridless power product. En-
phase continues to push back the rollout date for Ensemble. At the Solar 
Power International conference, CTO Raghu Belur gave the product intro-
duction date “to the end of Q4 2019 or Q1 2020.”30 When the company an-
nounced the product, in June 2017, the launch was projected for Q1 2018.31 
One executive at a major solar distributor whom we spoke to was put off by 
the fact that Enphase had no floor presence at this year’s September Solar 
Power International conference, with nothing of Ensemble to show.


The company makes much of the secrecy involved in Ensemble’s design 
and production, but this silence appears merely to mask poor engineer-
ing and slow progress with unfamiliar new product lines, such as energy 
storage, where Enphase is dwarfed by much bigger and better-capitalized 
competitors. One former Enphase employee we spoke to stated that man-
agement tried to take quality shortcuts on new equipment that would have

The company’s manufacturing transition from China to Mexico has also 
been more fraught than Enphase has let on. Three conversations with for-
mer executives described a well-run, automated manufacturing line En-
phase built in China. Meanwhile, Mexico “manufacturing” was character-
ized to us as currently limited to assembly, with manual processes and less 
skilled staff. Yet, Enphase external commentary has remained disconnected 
from on-the-ground reality, with management instead characterizing the 
issues as “two process steps out of 230 process steps”, while maintaining 
that “we have rapidly corrected the issues, we are now well underway.”


We encourage investors to ask management more probing questions about 
the obstacles to IQ8 and Ensemble development as well as the readiness 
issues at the Mexico plant.


The Curious Case of Jithender Majjiga
Amid all of the subpar management hires, one egregious deal stands 
apart, where it appears the CEO acquired his old college friend’s company. 
Jithender Majjiga, who became VP of cost planning at Enphase, had previ-
ously cofounded an energy storage startup named ActivStor. ActivStor, 
which was incorporated in 2017, gives a residential address as its head-
quarters.32 According to Majjiga’s LinkedIn, Enphase acquired this com-
pany a year later, in January 2018:33 Regardless of Kothandaraman’s unin-
spired professional history, he was appointed CEO of ENPH in September 
2017, less than a month after the previous CEO was pushed out and just 5 
months after being appointed COO of the company in April 2017. 34

as Kothandaraman, just one year earlier:


“Show Me the Incentive…”
New management has tied themselves to ENPH’s short-term share price 
for compensation while increasing the frequency of cash bonuses. In 2018, 
management began to cash bonus payouts quarterly.35 Meanwhile, ENPH 
has begun making 60% of its restricted stock unit grants based on “speci-
fied corporate goals measured over a one-year period” and “achievement of 
stock price targets over a one-year period, which it laughably calls “Long-
Term Incentive”.36,37 Quarterly cash bonus payouts are also non-GAAP and 
subject to numerous adjustments.38 Interestingly, Enphase snuck these 
changes to performance-based compensation in after the 2018 proxy date, 
only noting the difference in compensation structures a year later, in April 
2019.39

SEDG, by contrast, applies a four-year vesting period to all executive op-
tions and pays cash bonuses annually.


ENPH’s pay packages, short-termist as they are, unequivocally encour-
age executives to manage to the quarter, while inviting management to 
juice ENPH’s share price by hiding unfavorable information. Indeed, over 
the last six months, while shares have leapt from below $10 to above $20, 
insiders have sold shares worth $5.4 million.40


Gross Margins
Enphase has reported vaulting gross margin gains quarter after quarter 
since the management change in Q2 2017. Compare those with steady-
Eddie gross margins reported by direct comparable SolarEdge.


We have asked about 15 former executives and competitors how ENPH 
managed to achieve this improvement. The only plausible explanation of-
fered was that, when ENPH received an injection of capital in late 2016, 
the market gained confidence that Enphase would be able to honor its war-
ranty commitments and was more willing to purchase.


We believe that explanation is insufficient. ASPs declined in 2017.41 In

a lot. And, therefore, each transaction needs to be optimized there. 
And very often, we were not able to service some valued customers 
because our costs on IQ 6 were not good enough. Kothandaraman 
August 16, 2018 earnings call


Over and over, Kothandaraman attributed the margin performance to cost-
cutting:


In general, we're making a lot of progress on gross margin. We 
are working on costs day and night. We are working on this archi-
tectural innovation. We are working on accessories, dropping our 
overhead. In addition, as we transition to higher power, higher per-
formance products, our gross margin is naturally better. . . . So obvi-
ously we're cautious. But we really feel good about gross margins.

Not coincidentally, in 2018, Enphase brought forward the vesting date of 
the stock awards that had been given to Chief Commercial Officer David 
Ranhoff in 2017. Had the company not changed the vesting date, Ranhoff’s 
total compensation would have been 70.8% lower than the $2.0 million in 
total compensation he brought in in 2018. 


Overall, top executives’ salaries at Enphase have ballooned as compensa-
tion targets have grown more short-term. Kothandaraman has enjoyed par-
ticular prosperity, with his compensation eclipsing $8 million in 1H 2019:

grown at only +10%, by contrast.43


In August 2018, ENPH increased its market share by a third by acquiring 
struggling solar panel maker SunPower’s microinverter business.44 ENPH 
had no use for SunPower’s technology and immediately discontinued the 
inverters. The rationale of the deal was a contract to supply SunPower for 
five years.


Kothandaraman was rewarded with nearly 1 mln RSUs45 for making this 
purchase, stock that has soared in value since the deal was made. But the 
deal looks foolish in hindsight. In 11 months since acquisition, the Sun-
Power agreement produced $33.6 million in revenues.46 This is despite the 
company’s announcement that the acquisition would bring in $60-70 mln 
in annualized revenues in the second half of 2019.47 At the time of pur-

chase, the purchase consideration was $25 million in cash and 7.5 million 
shares, or $57.3 million altogether.48 This amounts to an annualized sales 
multiple of about 1.6x, which is itself hard to justify for a barely profit-
making book of business. At current share prices (SunPower still holds its 
ENPH shares), SunPower is making over $270 million.49


Amid this lackluster return profile, it is important to note that SunPower 
is not even a timely payer. As of Q2 2019, SunPower owed ENPH $14.3 mln 
in receivables, or approximately 140 days’ sales.50 From a working capital 
perspective, too, this seems like a rotten acquisition. This reinforces the 
perception that management is working to bolster revenue growth how-
ever it can. 


Not coincidentally, ENPH’s CFO, Eric Branderiz, was formerly senior vice 
president, corporate controller, and chief accounting officer at SunPower. 
Mandy Yang, chief accounting officer at ENPH, was also at SunPower at 
the same time reporting to Branderiz. 


We have detailed a business that differs wildly from analyst and investor 
perception. Enphase employs obfuscation to mask eroding market share. 
The company is a refuge for cast-offs from Tesla, PlugPower, SunEdison, 
and Cypress Semiconductor. Meanwhile, ENPH ranks have been stripped 
bare of engineering talent thanks to mismanagement and a short-term 
fixation. The same aggressive practices that led to 200% of Q2 sales being 
pulled forward have delayed and impaired the company’s product pipeline. 
Amid these repeated fumbles, a tight-knit squad of executives continues 
to deceive investors while enriching themselves and those loyal to them. 
Market participants holding Enphase shares do not know what they own.
