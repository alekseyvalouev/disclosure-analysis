AsiaInfo-Linkage: SEC Scrutiny And Concerns Over Financials Lead To High Risk Of Go-Private 
Deal Collapsing 


November 12, 2012 


 
Executive Summary 


Amidst a storm of investor distaste for U.S.-listed Chinese equities, and with its shares trading at a fresh 5-year low 
earlier this year, AsiaInfo-Linkage, Inc. (ASIA) followed the precedent of numerous other Chinese companies in 
announcing it had received a "Go-Private" proposal on January 20, 2012. From the very beginning, the 
announcement was vague and specified only that the offer was "at a premium" over the current stock price. 
ASIA's shares had closed at $8.60 two days prior, but leapt to a high of $12.50 following the announcement and 
settled at $11.78. Investors breathed a sigh of relief that Citic Capital China Partners was named as a potential 
partner in the transaction. Today, after more than 9 months, and no deal even remotely close to being 
announced, investors are ascribing an irrational hope and probability that their shares will be purchased for 
anything close to the current price of $10.50. Given the weak fundamental backdrop in the China telecom and IT 
services market, concerns about the company's VIE structure, close scrutiny by the SEC, and potential for its 
financials to be overstated, a fair value target for ASIA's stock price is $6.50 per share. 


 
History Tells Us Go-Private Deals Are Likely To Fail 


The easiest and quickest way for Chinese companies to scare off short sellers is to create the perception that their 
stock is in demand, and an interested party, or parties, are willing to purchase all the shares at a substantial 
premium. This tactic was used earliest by companies such as Fushi Copperweld (FISN) in October 2010, and later 
by Harbin in 2011. The Harbin takeover saga was well chronicled here on Seeking Alpha, and was a painful drama 
lesson lasting 1 year that taught short-sellers that you can't stop easy money from doing non-economic deals in 
China. 


The latest headline grabbing deal for 2012 was that Focus Media (FMCN) has drawn the attention of a consortium 
of buyers for $27.00/share, valuing the company at approximately $3.5 billion. According to the press release, the 
consortium received a "highly confident" letter from bankers, which provides a limited form of assurance that the 
buyers are serious and have access to capital. Interestingly enough, CITIC Capital China Partners was also named 
as a potential buyer of Focus Media. 


It appears that that CITIC has chosen to pursue Focus Media, and all but abandoned its interest in acquiring ASIA. 
This conclusion is supported by additional information provided by the company in their limited updates on their 
strategic review process. Consider that in March, ASIA announced that it has: 


"Determined to solicit interest from, and engage in discussions with, other potential qualified parties regarding a 
potential transaction." 


The company's last update came on July 30th when the company stated briefly in their second quarter earnings 
press release that: 


"The process remains ongoing. However, there can be no assurance that any definitive offer will ultimately be 
made, or that any transaction will be approved or consummated by the Company."

After more than 8 months without a bona fide offer, it should be incredibly obvious that ASIA is unlikely to see a 
going private deal consummated. What also makes us suspicious is that no price for ASIA was ever indicated, just 
like the purported unsolicited offer at a "substantial premium" that ChinaCast (CAST) received  in November 2011. 
ChinaCast shareholders should have well sold that news when they got it -- their stock has since be delisted to the 
Pink Sheets and trade for pennies. Furthermore, ASIA also suffers from operating under a VIE structure, which is 
coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny. This structure may certainly narrow the universe of potential buyers 
interested in exploring a go-private transaction with ASIA. 


Unfortunately, there is also little objective evidence from the options market to confirm that any transaction is 
imminent. For a company of ASIA's market cap, there is very little open interest of call options through the end of 
the year and no unusual activity that indicates a transaction with upside beyond the current share price.  


What more can we learn from the history of Chinese go-private deals to indicate the likelihood that we have 
reached the correct conclusion? In the table below we've outlined a list of publicly announced going private 
transactions involving U.S. listed Chinese companies. In total, we've identified 31 deals going back more than 2 
years.

Source: Public press releases and filings   


The results indicate that only 36% of the announced deals have closed, and they typically closed within 6 months. 
Only 2 out of 30 deals (6%) dragged on longer than ASIA's deal, and ended in a completed transaction. At its 
current market cap of $745m, ASIA's size dwarfs some of the other Chinese small caps that opportunistically 
announced going-private proposals. Even despite the supposed $257m of cash on ASIA's balance sheet, the 
financing requirement to take them private would be rather large and limiting for many potential buyers.

Buyers Unlikely To Emerge While Fundamentals Are Weakening 


ASIA's core business is in telecom software solutions and IT services in China. Its main customers are China Mobile 
(CHL), China Unicom (CHU), and China Telecom (CHA). These three customers account for 99% of ASIA's revenues - 
clearly a loss or deferral of business from any one customer would have a detrimental effect on their business.   


ASIA competes specifically with much larger competitors in the telecom space including ZTE (HK: 0673), Digital 
China (HK: 0861), Huawei and Neusoft (SHA:600718). If ZTE’s disastrous quarter and earnings warning last week 
are any indication of market conditions in China’s telecom service sector, ASIA shareholders are in for a rude 
awakening. ZTE’s stock plummeted 15% after they warned of a future quarterly loss and commented that 
conditions could get even worse.   


Conditions are not any better in the Chinese IT services sector, which includes companies such as VanceInfo (VIT), 
HiSoft (HSFT), and iSoftStone (ISS). Currently, the Chinese IT sector is under immense pressure to show growth and 
profitability. The recent stock-for-stock merger between VanceInfo and HiSoft illustrates the pressures facing the 
industry. Camelot Information Systems (CIS), a company we warned investors about in an article more than a year 
ago, continues to suffer and is facing declining earnings. Overall, the market is discounting future losses for 
Chinese telecom and IT service. The chart below shows the year-to-date stock price performance of ASIA vs. its 
peers. Every company is trading at or near its low, except for ASIA, which is being sustained on pure hope and 
speculation that a higher bid will emerge. 





Year-to-Date Stock Performance:  Chinese Telecom and IT Service Providers


Asia Receives Go-
Private Proposal





ASIA's Financials:  Proceed with Caution, But Don’t Just Take Our Word, Listen to the SEC 


Perhaps another reason why no buyers are emerging for ASIA is skepticism around the quality of their financials. 
In the charts below, we see that ASIA is reporting a vastly superior gross and EBITDA margin, and is one of the few 
companies producing positive free cash flow in the last 12 months. What makes these results so remarkable is that 
ASIA has a relatively small workforce at just 10,541 employees, and operates in the highly competitive and 
regulated telecom niche. In this niche they compete most closely with global giants ZTE and Huawei, each with 
workforces of 87,000 and 140,000 employees, respectively. However, their average revenue per employee figures 
dwarfs ASIA's. This would indicate they are operating a vastly more productive and efficient operation then ASIA's 
business. Oddly enough, the margins tell a vastly different story that would lead investors to the opposite 
conclusion – that ASIA is highly efficient and/or does higher value-added and more profitable work than peers. The 
disparity is striking and difficult to reconcile. At the very least, it’s a red flag that investors should proceed with 
caution.

Given ASIA’s red flag warning seen by the revenue per employee figures, we went one step further to 
investigate the issue. LinkedIn provides some valuable circumstantial evidence that bolsters the argument that 
their financials and/or its business size/scale is not as large as advertised. Consider that ASIA has a mere 385 
LinkedIn members, which on a workforce greater than 10,000 would indicate a penetration rate of a paltry 
3.7%. This figure puts them at the bottom of the heap. The result cannot easily be explained away either by 
the immaturity of their business since they were founded in 1993 – almost 20 years ago. Furthermore, few 
LinkedIn members seem even interested in following ASIA. It is also worth noting that on its LinkedIn profile, 
ASIA describes itself as employing “over 8,000 people worldwide,” whereas its website and SEC filings paint a 
picture greater than 10,000.

Conclusion 


Given the body of evidence presented, we conclude that it is unlikely ASIA will complete a going-private 
transaction. The company has all but indicated that there are no serious buyers in the process, and the option 
market is indicating a minimal probability of an imminent deal at any significant premium to the current price. 
Our empirical analysis of Chinese go-private deals also ascribes a greater than 90% chance that ASIA never 
completes a transaction. Our suspicion is that no buyers will emerge due to the weak fundamentals in the 
China market, the risks inherent in the company's VIE structure, and the strong possibility that the company's 
financials cannot be relied upon. Once investors come to the realization that no deal will occur, ASIA's share 
price will fall closer in line to its peers, which are trading at 52 week lows. That puts our price target on ASIA at 
$6.50/share (45% downside).
