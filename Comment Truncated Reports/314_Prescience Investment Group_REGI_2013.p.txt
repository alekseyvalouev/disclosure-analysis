Renewable Energy: Dec 31 Tax Credit Expiration Signals Precipitous
Ebitda Contraction, 50% Downside
Dec. 13, 2013 2:21 PM ET20 comments
by: Prescience Investment Group


Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGI) equity has not yet priced in the likely
impact of the impending December 31, 2013 expiration of the Blenders' Tax Credit,
which we estimate to have contributed 77% and 104% of Adjusted EBITDA in 2012
and in the 9ME 9/30/2013, respectively. Upon expiration of this subsidy in 2.5 weeks'
time, we believe REGI's margins will be wiped out and that it will operate at a
significant loss. The expiration of the Blenders' Tax Credit is not without precedence.
The BTC was also not renewed throughout 2010. According to REGI, "The absence of
and uncertainty around the blenders' tax credit during most of 2010 materially curtailed
demand for biodiesel and our ability to cost effectively produce and sell biodiesel,
resulting in our idling production at several of our facilities during that period." In 2012,
REGI generated $39m of Adjusted EBITDA, relative to $107m in the 9ME 9/30/2013. 
From period to period, REGI does not discuss the specifics pertaining to the size of its
Blenders' Tax Credit (BTC) benefit anywhere in its financial filings; and, it aggregates
revenues from all types of incentives into a single line item, “Biodiesel Government
Incentives,” obscuring the significance of BTC revenues. We believe this has
prevented investors from ascertaining the impact of the tax credit on REGI’s financial
state, resulting in a steep disconnect between intrinsic value and trading levels.
REGI’s share price also dislodged from the realities reflected by the D4 RIN price,
which is down ~40% in 2013 – indicating substantially weakened biodiesel demand –
while REGI’s share price is up 75%. We believe most investors are not tracking the D4
RIN price.
US Renewable Group (USRG) – which is headed by Jonathan Koch, a former REGI
board member – was a longtime shareholder and the second-largest shareholder in
REGI as of a few months ago. Over the course of June and July, USRG liquidated
over 3 million shares for total proceeds of approximately $43M, and on many days
accounted for ~20% of average volume, indicating an urgent exit.


We believe based on a confluence of factors that REGI's EBITDA will decline precipitously
in 2014, to levels last seen in 2012, another period in which the Blenders' Tax Credit was
not renewed. We believe the equity is highly overvalued at current levels, with an
intrinsic value of $4.70/share, ~55% below current trading levels.

Introduction


Renewable Energy Group, Inc. is a low-cost producer of biodiesel; through a series of
acquisitions and production capacity builds it has grown to become the largest biodiesel
producer in the United States based on gallons produced. As of September 30, 2013, it
owned 8 active biodiesel production facilities with an aggregate production capacity of
257m gallons per year. In 2012 and the 9ME 9/30/13, it sold 188m and 186m gallons of
biodiesel, respectively, including 25m and 30mm, respectively, of which it purchased from
third parties and resold.


>99% of REGI's revenues are generated as a result of biodiesel revenues; we estimate
that in the 9ME 9/30/12, biodiesel revenues were split 88%/12% between Biodiesel Sales
and Biodiesel Government Incentives, respectively.


Blenders' Tax Credit: 100% of EBITDA, Expires on Jan 1, 2014

The biodiesel industry has been substantially aided by federal tax incentives.
Because biodiesel has historically been more expensive to produce than diesel fuel,
the biodiesel industry has depended on governmental incentives that have
effectively brought the price of biodiesel more in line with the price of diesel fuel to
the end user. These incentives have supported a market for biodiesel that might not
exist without the incentives.


- REGI S4/A filed on 11/23/2009 (Risk Factors)


Any repeal, expiration, non-renewal, substantial modification or waiver of the
renewable fuels mandate or Federal or state incentive programs could reduce the
demand for biodiesel and result in our inability to produce and sell biodiesel
profitably.


- REGI 10-K for 2011


The biodiesel industry - including public companies REGI and Future Fuel (NYSE:FF) - is
dependent on governmental programs and incentives that support the biodiesel market.
The most significant tax incentive program is the federal Blenders' Tax Credit (BTC), which
we believe makes up 90-95% of REGI's Biodiesel Government Incentives revenue. It is
set to expire at the end of December 2013. We believe that because the company
does not customarily disclose the dollar value of the BTC in its financial filings,
which would enable investors to gauge its significance on the company's financial
state, the impact of the expiration on REGI's financials has not been widely
recognized and is not reflected in today's market price.


Based on opaque and disparate disclosures over several quarters' time, we
estimate that this tax credit made up 77% of REGI's EBITDA in 2012 and ~100% of
EBITDA in the 9ME 9/30/2013. When the subsidy expires, in 2.5 weeks, we believe
REGI's margins will be wiped out and that it will operate at a significant loss; the
absence of the BTC will also likely hurt the demand for biodiesel, as exhibited in
past periods it was not renewed.


Dependency on the Blenders' Tax Credit Obscured With Opaque Disclosures


From period to period, REGI does not discuss the specifics pertaining to the size of its
BTC benefit anywhere in its financial filings; and, it aggregates revenues from all types of
incentives into a single line item - "Biodiesel Government Incentives," which is a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1897891-renewable-energy-dec-31-tax-credit-expiration-signals-precipitous-ebitda-contraction-50-percent-downside 4


component of Biodiesel Revenue, obscuring the significance of BTC revenues. Due to
special circumstance, however, the company disclosed a limited amount of information in
its 2012 10-K.


The Blenders' Tax Credit was allowed to expire on December 31, 2011, and was not
reinstated throughout 2012. On January 2, 2013, however, President Obama signed into
law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which reinstated the federal biodiesel
Blenders' Tax Credit for 2013 and retroactively reinstated the credit for 2012. In its 2012
10-K, REGI estimated the net benefit it would recognize in 1H 2013 that related to its 2012
operating performance and results, and included these estimates in a table detailing
Adjusted EBITDA, as if the credit were in effect for 2012; it showed a 2012 net benefit
from the Blenders' Tax Credit of $57.7m, or 60% of EBITDA (refer to table below). Based
on our analysis of opaque disclosures in subsequent quarterly filings, however, indicate
the benefit was ~77% of EBITDA.


In its Q2 10-Q, REGI disclosed a reclassification of an expense that in Q1 was booked as
COGS, reversing it and booking it instead as a reduction in Biodiesel Revenue. It's
described the $69.5m expense as the "Blenders' Tax Credit amount refunded to
customers," with no elaboration.


"During the second quarter of 2013, we revised the presentation of biodiesel
government incentives revenue and biodiesel cost of goods sold from amounts
previously reported in the first quarter of 2013 to reflect the Blenders' Tax Credit
amount refunded to customers of $69.5 million as a reduction of biodiesel
government incentives revenue versus biodiesel cost of goods sold."


Then in its Q3 10-Q, it again reclassified the charge, this time reversing the charge
booked in Q2 against the Biodiesel Revenue line item and booking it instead as a
reduction of Biodiesel Government Incentives. This time the company elaborated on the
nature of the expense; it was a nonrecurring charge against the retroactive BTC benefit.
Per the Revenue Recognition section of the filing,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1897891-renewable-energy-dec-31-tax-credit-expiration-signals-precipitous-ebitda-contraction-50-percent-downside 5


"While in general the Company has not historically offered sales incentives to
customers, the uncertainty around the reinstatement of the federal blenders' tax
credit led to the introduction of such an incentive during 2012. Specifically, during
2012 the Company negotiated contracts with certain customers to allow such
customers to share in the value of federal blenders tax payments if the law
were to be reinstated. The federal Blenders' Tax Credit was reinstated on
January 2, 2013 and the Company recognized $69,534 of cash payments owed
to customers as a reduction of Biodiesel sales revenue. Before 2012, the
Company did not have similar contracts and none of its sales subsequent to
December 31, 2012 contain such provisions."


Its disclosure indicates that in a normal operating environment, this would have been
booked as a BTC benefit to revenue. In order to assess the significance of the BTC to
REGI's financials, then, we would add the value of this figure ($69.5) to the $57.75m
benefit already booked; in such a case, REGI should have booked a total benefit of
$127.3m in 2012 as the result of the tax credit. This number is corroborated by REGI's
Q1'10Q disclosure regarding its change in Accounts Receivable account:


"$127.9 of the accounts receivable increase relates to the retroactive 2012 Blenders'
Tax Credit passed into law on January 2, 2013"


Adjusting for the $69.5m addition, 2012 EBITDA would have been reported to be
$166.05m. The BTC would have made up 77% of 2012 EBITDA.


We adjusted REGI's Q1'2013 Biodiesel Government Incentives line item based on this
information, enabling us to estimate the BTC's impact on YTD 2013 EBITDA. Based on
our analysis, ~104% of Adjusted EBITDA is the direct result of this government
subsidy, and in its absence, REGI would be operating at a significant loss. This Tax
Credit is set to expire in two weeks at the end of December 2013.

The decline of REGI's business in the absence of this subsidy has precedence. The
BTC was also not renewed throughout 2010. Per the 2011 10-K:


"The absence of and uncertainty around the blenders' tax credit during most of 2010
materially curtailed demand for biodiesel and our ability to cost effectively
produce and sell biodiesel, resulting in our idling production at several of our
facilities during that period."


And per the 2010 10-K:


"If Congress decides to eliminate or reduce the blenders' credit, non-RFS2 related
demand for our product could be significantly reduced and/or the price we are able
to charge for our product could be significantly reduced without a corresponding
reduction in the price of feedstock, in either case, harming revenues and
profitability."


So not only does the absence of the BTC impact REGI's bottom-line, it also impacts the
demand for biodiesel because it is split by producers of biodiesel such as REGI and
blenders (REGI's customers), such a Pilot Travel Centers LLC. Blenders are less
incentivized to blend biodiesel since they longer benefit from the tax credit, thus reducing
overall demand for biodiesel.


If the market had already baked in this impending storm, we believe REGI's share
price would be trading substantially lower. At current trading levels, we are left to
believe investors have not yet fully appreciated the significance of the Blenders'
Tax Credit on REGI's financial state.


RFS Mandate Reduction and the Collapse of RIN Prices

REGI's share price appears significantly disconnected from its realities as represented by
the D4 RIN price, which is down ~40% in 2013, as REGI's share price is up 75%.
Because of this, we believe most REGI investors are not following the trend in D4
RIN price, which poses another very significant risk to REGI's share price. The D4
RIN price is reflecting waning market demand for biodiesel.


RINs are a product of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the most important
government program supporting the biodiesel industry, enacted by Congress in the
Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS requires that a specific amount
of renewable fuel be used annually in motor vehicle fuel nationwide. In 2010, RFS began
requiring that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be
made from renewable sources. The RFS requirements for 2011, 2012, and 2013 were set
at 800m, 1B, and 1.28B gallons, respectively. RFS has created demand for biodiesel,
REGI's core product, which has been used to satisfy the vast majority of the RFS
requirements. The program forces petroleum refiners and fuel importers ("Obligated
Parties") to demonstrate compliance with its standards.


As a part of the EPA efforts to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the
renewable fuel standard, it created a system - the renewable identification number, or RIN.
The EPA created the renewable identification number, or RIN, system to track renewable
fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered
producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they
produce. In the case of biodiesel, 1.5 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for
each gallon of biodiesel produced. Most renewable fuel, including biodiesel, is then sold
with its associated RINs attached.


RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with the RFS2.
Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO
during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying
renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing
renewable fuels themselves.


RINs have become a significant portion of the value of a gallon of biodiesel, and the rise in
RIN price was a primary driver of REGI's 2013 profitability. The rise of RIN prices, driven
by the ethanol mandate, was well documented throughout the media, which had positive
impact on biodiesel. However, RIN prices began to fall dramatically in Q3 and Q4 as the
EPA released a "bombshell" November 15, 2013, proposing no increase in biodiesel
mandate of 1.28 billion gallons for 2014 and 2015. Most experts and market participants

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1897891-renewable-energy-dec-31-tax-credit-expiration-signals-precipitous-ebitda-contraction-50-percent-downside 8


expected an increase to as high as 1.9 billion gallons for 2014 and beyond. Craig Irwin,
analyst at Wedbush Securities, articulated this market consensus expectation as early as
2Q13:


"Dan, as we look out at 2014, some of the numbers we understand NBB might be
talking about, it could be as high as maybe 1.8 or 1.9 billion gallons. If you are going
to stay in the range of 15% to 25%, sort of suggest that there is a lot of the potential
for being at the lower end of the range with big numbers like that being tossed
around, how would you prioritize your opportunity for investments to meet a large
RVO like that?


The EPA proposal clearly disappointed, evident in the biodiesel RIN prices subsequently
collapsing.


Biomass-based RINs can be viewed as a mechanism that reflects present and future
demand for biodiesel. As such, we view RINs as a leading indicator of the health of the
biodiesel market. High RIN prices suggest tight supply-demand fundamentals; low RIN
prices suggest low demand or an oversupplied market. Because RINs are generated for
every gallon of biodiesel produced, as is the Blenders' Tax Credit, RIN economics are
shared between the blender and REGI. With RINs hovering close to $0.20/gal, we expect
further drag on REGI's profit margins.


At the moment there is a significant disconnect between D4 RIN price and REGI's
valuation. Year-to-date, D4 RIN prices are down ~40% and yet REGI's share price is
up 75%. We believe the disconnect results from most investors not following what
the D4 RIN is indicating. As investors become aware of its precipitous decline, we

believe REGI's share price is at further risk of substantial decline, in reflection of
market demand. (We should note that we believe the RIN prices will begin to rebound in
2Q14, in normal seasonal pattern, as increases are needed to ensure enough marginal
production to meet the RFS mandate.)


(The comment period for the RFS proposal, ending January 28, 2014, allows for industry
participants to put in their "two cents" on the proposal. Gary Haer VP of Sales and Bruce
Lutes, General Manager of REGI recently provided their testimony at a recent EPA
hearing. However, through our channel checks, it is highly unlikely that we will see any
significant changes to the current proposal. Market prices of RIN means industry watchers
also share our view.)


Industry Characterized by Overcapacity


The National Biodiesel Board (here) is one of the sector's leading industry and lobbyist
groups (annual spending history here), and throughout 2013, was advocating to increase
the mandate to nearly 2 billion gallons per year. Their argument was simple: the industry is
fully capable of producing at a 2 billion gallon per year run rate and will create jobs and, as
such, the EPA should increase the 2014 mandate to nearly 2 billion gallons.


The industry has the ability to and frequently overproduces relative to the EPA's
mandates. This year's projected volume is expected to exceed 1.7 billion gallons of
biodiesel, 33% more than the 2013 mandate. The charts below displays monthly
production (which includes imports into the US), annualized, (in order to be able to
compare to the annual mandates) relative to the 2013 biomass-based diesel mandate of
1.28B gallons. The data behind the charts can be obtained directly from the EPA EMTS
website.

Since the third quarter of 2013, the industry has produced biodiesel at 100% of its
capacity, an annualized runrate exceeding the actual mandate. Industry insiders will tell
investors that the recent increase in production is due to expiration of the tax credit,
resulting in blenders pulling in demand from 2014 into 2013 to obtain the $1 Tax Credit.
This is great for the short term, but what happens in the first half of 2014, which is already
seasonally weak? There will be a high likelihood that in the first quarter of 2014, prices for
biodiesel will collapse as demand sharply falls. We believe poor biodiesel economics will
continue for an extended period of time due to the flat year-over-year mandate and low
RIN prices. As a result, there is a high likelihood that REGI will reduce production, or
even shut plants in light of the new market environment.


Economics 101 suggests that in any market characterized by overcapacity, prices will fall
and profit margins will be razor thin as the marginal biodiesel producer will produce just to
capture a last sliver of profit. Investors should be aware that the US biodiesel market will
likely have overcapacity as a structural problem for the next two years.


Increased Competition from Low-Cost Producers Argentina and Indonesia


On November 20, 2013, the European Union (EU) imposed five-year anti-dumping tariffs
on Argentina and Indonesia biodiesel for levies up to 25% beginning November 28, 2013.
Because the levies on Argentina and Indonesia are so high, reports indicate that biodiesel
exports to the EU will fall substantially and be redirected. Guess where some of this
excess biodiesel is heading? The US.


Argentina, one of the world's largest producers of biodiesel, is expected to double its year-
over-year exports to the US in the fourth quarter 2013 here. In 2014, Argentina is
expected to generate 2.6 billion liters (680 million gallons) of biodiesel, and export close to
half its production at 1.2 billion liters (300 million gallons). Argentina's reported nameplate
capacity for biodiesel production is 5.2 billion liters (1.38 billion gallons). Today, Argentina
is running at 40% to 50% production capacity because of anti-dumping issues with the
EU. Exports of biodiesel from Argentina to the EU fell 50% after the European
Commission opened its investigation.

Indonesia is in a similar position, as most of its production is exported. More than half of
its production is for the export market. Internal consumption is not great enough to absorb
the excess capacity. A lot of the biodiesel was going into Europe, but we expect some of
those exports to be redirected to the US.


Biodiesel Veteran & Former REGI Board Member Sold >50% of His Holdings


US Renewable Group (USRG) - which is headed by Jonathan Koch, a former REGI board
member - was the second largest shareholder in REGI as of a few months ago. According
to its website, USRG is a leading renewable energy focused investment firm with over
$750 million of assets under management.

Since mid-2013 through early 4Q13, USRG has sold shares at a rabid pace, liquidating
over 3 million for total proceeds of approximately $43M. This represents approximately 8%
of the total shares outstanding. More alarming was that USRG, on many days, sold at a
pace of 19% of the average traded share volume, indicating a sense of urgency to get out.
USRG was an investor with REGI before it became a public company. Koch and USRG
were in the front seat at REGI when the Blenders' Tax Credit was allowed to expire in
2012, witnessing first hand its impact on REGI's stock price, which traded below $5. Mr.
Koch's fiduciary duties are to his investors at USRG; but, we believe frequently selling at
19% of daily volume, which can adversely impact the share price. We view this as a red
flag. USRG has liquidated their original common position and the remaining 1.5 million
shares are common shares that have been converted from their preferred holdings.

Target Valuation and Conclusion


We believe REGI's production output and its profitability will contract as the culmination of
the expiration of the Blenders' Tax Credit, fall in RINs prices, structural industry
overcapacity, and elevated risks from foreign exports. We believe REGI's EBITDA is likely

Blenders' Tax Credit was allowed to expire. Our target price is around $4.71 for 2014, a
56% decrease from current levels.

Government Programs Favoring Biodiesel Production and Use


The biodiesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs,
the most important of which is RFS2.


Renewable Fuel Standard


On July 1, 2010, RFS2's biomass-based diesel requirement became effective, requiring
for the first time that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States
be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel requirement can be satisfied
by two primary fuels, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Historically, Renewable diesel has
not been available in the United States in significant commercial quantities and thus,
biodiesel has satisfied the vast majority of the RFS2 biomass-based diesel requirement.

The biomass-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel
requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories
and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel,
which is intended to be satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined
as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to
the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two
subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, which is intended to be satisfied by newly developed
cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and biomass-based
diesel, which is intended to be satisfied by biodiesel and renewable diesel. RFS2's total
advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and biomass-
based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced
biofuels.


The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers
in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as "Obligated Parties" in the
RFS2 regulations, and requires these Obligated Parties to incorporate into their
petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the
form of RINs from those who do. An Obligated Party's RVO is based on the volume of
petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest United States petroleum
companies, such as Valero, Phillips 66, Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum, Chevron and
Shell, represent the majority of the total RVOs, with the remainder made up of smaller
refiners and importers.


Renewable Identification Numbers


The EPA created the renewable identification number, or RIN, system to track renewable
fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered
producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they
produce. In the case of biodiesel, 1.5 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for
each gallon of biodiesel produced. Most renewable fuel, including biodiesel, is then sold
with its associated RINs attached. Under the RFS2 regulations, the RINs may also be
separated from the gallons of renewable fuel and once separated they may be sold as a
separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate
compliance with the RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number
of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can
obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been
separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must be

entered into the EPA's moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation,
transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2
requirements.


The value of RINs is significant to the price of biodiesel. In July 2010, when RFS2 became
effective, biomass-based diesel RINs began trading at approximately $0.55 per RIN. By
the end of 2010, the 2010 biomass-based diesel RIN value had become increasingly
significant to the price of biodiesel, contributing approximately $1.11, or 26% of the
average The Jacobsen B100 Upper Midwest spot price of a gallon of biodiesel. As of
December 31, 2011, RINs contributed approximately $1.83, or 38% of the average The
Jacobsen B100 Upper Midwest spot price of a gallon of biodiesel. During 2012, the value
of RINs, as reported by OPIS, have contributed to the average B100 spot price of a gallon
of biodiesel, as reported by The Jacobsen, and range from a low of $0.63 per gallon, or
24%, in October to a high of $2.39, or 50%, per gallon in January. There was a sharp
decline in RIN prices during third quarter 2012 that carried through the end of the year.
During this period, RIN pricing declined from $1.17 per RIN at June 30, 2012 to $0.64 per
RIN at December 31, 2012, as reported by OPIS, which contributed to the decline in price
of biodiesel.


Blenders' Tax Credit


The Blenders' Tax Credit provides a $1.00 per gallon excise tax credit to the first blender
of biodiesel with at least 0.1% petroleum-based diesel fuel. The Blenders' Tax Credit can
then be credited against such blenders' federal excise tax liability or the blender can
obtain a cash refund from the United States Treasury for the value of the credit. The
blenders' tax credit became effective January 1, 2005 and then lapsed January 1, 2010
before being reinstated retroactively on December 17, 2010. The Blenders' Tax Credit
again expired as of December 31, 2011 and on January 2, 2013, it was again reinstated
retroactively for 2012 and prospectively for December 31, 2013. The Blenders' Tax Credit
is set to expire again on December 31, 2013 and it is uncertain whether it will be
extended.
