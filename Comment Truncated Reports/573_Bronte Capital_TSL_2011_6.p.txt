Trina Solar's very understanding banks...
Trina Solar is fast becoming a test-piece about just how understanding a Chinese bank can become. 
 
They have just produced some pretty ordinary numbers (as pre-announced) but it the massive
changes in their balance sheet that are really interesting.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Trina Solar's very understanding banks...

Cash went up from $490 million to $631 million - an increase of $141 million. 
 
But that was the end of the balance sheet good news. 
 
Short term debt went up from $153 to $343 million. They borrowed $190 million short term. 
 
And long term debt went up from $296 to $383 million. They borrowed another $87 million. 
 
So another way to look at it is that the company chewed through a net (190+87-141=) 136 million
despite their (much lower) stated profit. 
 
What gives? Its a widget company with stated profit but cash burn. 
 
Actually we know what gives - the company still can't sell their product to customers that actually pay. 
 
Inventory went up from $180 to $226 million. This company is still shipping to warehouses... 
 
Receivables went up from $543 to $584 million. So they are selling to people who are slow to pay (but
who have probably already received irrevocable delivery of solar panels and installed them into
levered solar parks. (The project financier almost certainly has the collateral now!) 
 
The rest of the cash burn wasn't really burn - it was (another) large increase in capacity. These
increases are happening despite the obvious problems this company has in selling its inventories. 
 
As I said - the banks are very understanding. 
 
And they will need to be because the company has contracted to buy lots more silicon and it needs to
increase its output substantially. They tell us that the silicon price will be lowered in accordance with
the contract. That is great: they are going to need it. 
 
Today at my office in Sydney I was cold-called by a solar panel installer. Business is quiet so they
were drumming up business. They want to sell me panels at an installed price (with inverters etc).
 The panel price was $1.35 per watt. Not kidding - way below where Trina is currently booking sales. 
 
The brand was Alex Panel - another company which the salesman assured me was "planning to list
on the New York Stock exchange".  
 
Trina say next quarter will be better. At $1.35 per watt sold by retail-cold-call in Sydney I don't quite
see it.
