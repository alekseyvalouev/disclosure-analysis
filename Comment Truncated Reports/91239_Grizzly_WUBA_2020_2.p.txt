WUBA Stock Price Performance

LK Burst


WUBA Buyout Offer


WUBA’s stock price dropped steeply following our report. However, when LK 
announced that it had misrepresented its financials on April 12th, 2020, WUBA 
suddenly announced a buyout offer. We do not view this as a coincidence.

Is 58.com Inc. (NYSE:WUBA) Go-Private Offer Credible?
Grizzly Research LLC published a bearish research report on 58.com Inc. (NYSE:WUBA) on February 13th, 
2020. Please find our research report here, read our full disclaimer here. 


• We published our report outlining in detail our
negative views on February 13, 2020. Prior day’s
closing price was $62.14.


• After seeing its stock decline to $46.70 WUBA
announced a non-binding go-private offer of $55.00
per share. We are highly suspicious of this offer for
multiple reasons:


- Timing: The proposal comes in a bad economic
environment for WUBA. Also, the offer happened
to be received one day after Luckin Coffee Inc.
(NASDAQ:LK)  had to admit accounting fraud
publicly, and many Chinese companies saw their
stocks drop concurrently.


- There are undisclosed relationships between
WUBA’s management and the supposed buyer
Ocean Link.


- There are multiple indications that the
supposed buyer has not and will likely not secure
the financing necessary to consume the acquisi-
tion of WUBA. The press release and offer seem to
be put together on short notice.


• We dare to ask: Is WUBA manipulating the market
price of its stock through a bogus buy-out offer?


• New reports from China suggest that WUBA is
going to decrease its headcount by at least 20%; This
supports our belief that the company faces strong
economic headwinds as it is reliant on an active real
estate and job market in China.


• WUBA failed to respond to the allegations we
raised in our report, but recent management chang-
es seem to imply that WUBA is trying to cover its
tracks.


• We noticed that another long-term director of
WUBA recently resigned from his position.


• WUBA is unusually late in the filing of its 20F
statement. We belief the impact from the quarantine
might be devastating to WUBA’s business.

R E P O R T S


April 29th, 2020


Why We Are Highly Suspicious Of the Go-Private Offer
The closing price of the company on February 
12th, 2020, the day prior to our initial publication, 
was $62.14. Currently, the company is trading at 
$51.88 as of April 27th, 2020. However, we firmly 
believe that if it were not for that seemingly odd 
non-binding go-private offer of $55.00 per ADS, 
the company’s stock would have dropped a lot 
more. In other words, we believe this non-binding 
go-private offer has been used as a “support” for 
the company’s stock. 


WUBA had seen its stock plummet 
already after our initial publication, but 
on the night of April 1st something 
meaningful happened. Luckin Coffee 
Inc. admitted several accounting 
wrongdoings, and saw its stock price 
plummet by over 70% the next trading 
day. Several other China-based 
US-listed companies saw their stocks 
selling off, but not WUBA which 
reported that it received a non-binding 
go-private offer at a premium to its 
trading price, which sent its stock price 
up on that day. We doubt that this was 
a mere coincidence. The sloppiness 
and lack of detail in the press release 
also suggest to us that the go-private 
offer was an overnight PR maneuver.


WUBA claims in its press release that 
the acquirer, called Ocean Link LLC, is 
willing to pay $55 per ADS. Ocean Link 
is a China-based private equity firm 
focused on consumer, travel, and TMT; 
Its strategic partners include Trip.com 


According to the press release on April 
2nd, 2020, Ocean Link Partners Limited 
was the sole named proposing buyer. 
Before that date, there was no 13G/D 
filing from Ocean Link on the company, 
which means Ocean Link did not hold 
an over 5% stake when proposing this 
non-binding offer to WUBA’s board. If 
Ocean Link was to acquire the compa-
ny at $55 per ADS, it would need to pay 
over $8 billion. Per Tianyancha, their 
most significant disclosed investment 
to date trails far behind with only $1.3 
billion. Generally speaking, on a deal of 
this size, the buyer would usually team 
up with some other parties. Yet Ocean 
Link was the only party mentioned as 
the sole buyer in the press release. The 
press release also freely admits that 
this deal is, if anything, at the very 
initial stages. The wording suggests to 
us that neither financing for this 
transaction is secured nor due 
diligence conducted. This reminds us 
of Elon Musk’s recent “funding secured” 
debacle.

Company Update on 58.com Inc. (NYSE:WUBA)


(NASDAQ:TCOM) and another global 
private equity firm General Atlantic. 
What’s worth noting is that, according 
to Qichacha, one of Ocean Link’s 
directors is Chi Zhang, a managing 
partner of General Atlantic. Mr. Zhang 
has also been a director of WUBA since 
2015, according to the company’s 2018 
20F. Also, General Atlantic filed a 13D 
in June 2017, disclosing a 5.9% stake in 
WUBA, and there was no follow-on 
filings since then. Thus, one could 
assume General Atlantic still holds a 
meaningful stake in the company. We 
wonder why WUBA failed to disclose 
this meaningful direct relationship 
between the firms in its press release.

Important information translated below:
An agreement surfaced from anonymous sources indicating that due to COVID-19, 
WUBA’s businesses are strongly affected, which has resulted in the temporary 
termination of certain positions and significant reduction in salary. The agreement 
stipulates a job awaiting period (where employees would not be able to work) from 
March to April. We believe this is clear indication that WUBA has seen a dramatic 
negative impact due to COVID-19.


R E P O R T S


April 29th, 2020


What Will Happen to the Offer?
It seems to us that the buy-out offer is overall 
not credible, so what is going to happen next? 
Our baseline expectation is that the offer will 
linger around and eventually be dismissed in 
the hope that the ADS price has gone above 
the proposed go-private price. We have seen 
multi-ple cases where bogus buy-out offers 
from Chinese buyers of US-listed Chinese 
companies lingered for numerous years to 
ultimately fall apart. 
21Vianet Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: VNET) 
announced on June 10th, 2015 that its board 
received a non-binding go-private offer of 
$23.00 per ADS, and the stock went up 9.7% to 
$21.85 on that day. However, after more than 
one year with no material progress on this non-
binding offer, on June 30th, 2016, the company 
announced that the buyer group 


More Signs of Economic Headwinds 
In March, it was reported in China that certain 
WUBA employee stated that the company was 
going to decrease its headcount by 20% due 
to a challenging business environment. The 
company later responded by saying the infor-
mation was not true and the personnel 
change was normal business adjustments. We 
don’t know if the media report is true or not, 
what we do know is that the company’s busi-
ness, as we stated in our report, should have 
been severely impacted by the pandemic, 
including job recruitment and real estate 
business. This was also reflected in the compa-
ny’s Q1 2020 guidance. The company guided 
25% to 29% year-over-year revenue decrease 
for Q1 2020, and we believe its profitability 
should not only be dramatically impacted in 
Q1, but also in the coming quarters of 2020. 


Company Update on 58.com Inc. (NYSE:WUBA)


withdrew the proposal. By then the company’s 
stock price had already gone down to $10.21 on 
the close, which is 50% less than the proposed 
go-private price. 
AirMedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AMCN, the 
company’s ticker was changed to ANTE in June 
2019, and the company did a 1-for-5 reverse 
split in April 2019). Using the post-split price as 
the reference, the company announced on June 
19th, 2015 that its board received a non-binding 
go-private offer of $30.00 per ADS. The compa-
ny’s stock went up 7.8% on that day to $26.85 
per ADS. However, after over two years on 
December 27th, 2017, the company announced 
the termination of the go-private transaction, 
and the stock closed at $6.75 per ADS, which 
was 75% lower than the price when the initial 
non-binding proposal was announced.

Company Update


April 29th, 2020


Shareholders Should Demand Answers from Management
The company did not respond to our allega-
tions raised in the initial report. Specifically, we 
firmly believe that the company should have 
written down the majority, if not all, of the 
goodwill related to Ganji’s acquisition in 2015. 
We still firmly stand by our belief that by failing 
to do so in the past years WUBA has engaged 
in accounting fraud. The company also did not 
explain why, from 2016 to 2018, there was a 
difference of cumulative RMB 4.6 billion 
between the SAIC consolidated revenues and 
the revenues reported to the SEC by WUBA. vv


Company Update on 58.com Inc. (NYSE:WUBA)


Our initial report alleged that one trick that 
WUBA played is not consolidating 58 Hone into 
WUBA’s reported consolidated financials. We 
listed evidence that supports our belief that, in 
reality, WUBA exercises control over 58 Home 
and thus should consolidate the entity into 
WUBA’s consolidated financials. Interestingly 
enough, we noticed that, according to the 
April 14th, 2020 filing, Xiaohua Chen resigned 
as WUBA’s chief strategic officer so that “he can 
focus on the business operations of 58 Home in 
his capacity as the chief executive officer of 58 


Home.” To us, it seems like WUBA is trying to 
further disconnect WUBA and 58 Home. How-
ever, this does not change the fact that WUBA 
had total control over 58 Home in the past yet 
still chose  not to consolidate 58 Home’s 
financials. 


Another thing we have noticed is that WUBA 
issued its 2018 20F on April 19th, 2019, but up 
until now, ndthe company still hasn’t filed its 
20F for 2019 yet. In addition to that, one of 
WUBA’s board directors, Frank Lin, tendered his 


resignation as a director on the board and a 
member of all the committees of the board 
recently. Mr. Lin has served as WUBA’s director 
since March 2010, and he was a member of 
Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, 
and Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee, according to the company’s 2018 
20F. We do not know the exact reasons for Mr. 
Lin’s departure, but we usually pay attention 
when vital and long-serving directors resign 
from the board. 


Key Issues Raised in Our Initial Report


- WUBA’s biggest acquisition Ganji has fallen completely apart according to our research. Shareholders
deserve transparency and updates regarding WUBA’s biggest acquisition.


- Multiple entities that we identified seem to be not consolidated into WUBA’s financials, but effectively
controlled. What is WUBA hiding by trying to avoid consolidation of these entities?


- SAIC filings suggest that revenues and profits were dramatically overstated. How come the filings show
differences of billions of RMB?


- Shareholders should demand transparency on the numerous acquisitions and spin-offs where company
insiders are counterparties. Who is really getting the benefits here?
