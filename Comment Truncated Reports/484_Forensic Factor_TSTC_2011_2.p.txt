Telestone Technologies (Part II): The Great Wall of Deceit





What is three cents, or less than one-half of one percent?  That was the
impact on the stock price of Telestone Technologies (NASDAQ: TSTC) from the
highly anticipated investor update call, the second unsuccessful call
management has held in the past two months.  The Forensic Factor (TFF) first
wrote about Telestone on January 11th with our report Telestone Technologies
- A "RINO" in sheep's clothing.  In that report, we identified a myriad of
concerns that were the foundation of our request for the NASDAQ to halt
trading in Telestone (seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-thefor...).  Despite
the gravity of the questions we raised, Telestone has failed to address many of
our concerns.  Further, an investor update call held on January 24th by
Telestone management was replete with incriminating commentary that raised
more questions than were answered.  In this brief follow-up, TFF will highlight
(a much more comprehensive final report will examine manufacturing
relationships and provincial branches):





A blatant violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 that should provide sufficient ammunition for
class action lawyers and the SEC.
An accounts receivable balance, and associated DSO level, that defy logic,
and arguably GAAP accounting.

A definitive admission from Telestone management that revenue is indeed
being recognized on a percentage of completion basis, confirming TFF's
suspicion that a restatement is necessary
Sixteen additional questions that the company failed to address, ranging
from: a distributor that was incorporated fifteen months AFTER
Telestone claims to have started the relationship, to an unusual
interest free loan from a related party that represented nearly 50% of the
company's cash at 9/30/10, and a history with an entity that appears to
have had accounts frozen with large quantities of Telestone stock.








Based on the action of the stock, the investing public appears to have voted
with TFF.  This morning, TFF will again ask the NASDAQ to explore the facts in
our first article, as well as examine additional brazen misrepresentations from
Telestone's call on January 24th
(http://www.mzcan.com/cancast/us/register.php?id=usTSTC_3&version=e).





Abraham Lincoln once said, "No man has a good enough memory to make a
successful liar."  Fortunately for the NASDAQ, the SEC, and TFF, a good
memory is not required in the age of public filings and recorded conference
calls.  In our previous write-up, TFF was extremely careful to highlight the
facts, opting to leave any fraud declaration to the class action attorneys and
the regulators.  In addition to the quote above, Abraham Lincoln also said, "It
is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak out and remove
all doubt."  TFF believes that Telestone management would have been better
off remaining silent.  Instead they spoke out yesterday, and essentially sealed
their fate as a reverse Chinese merger that stands for everything regulators
need to fix to restore confidence in the capital markets. 





On the update call, Telestone management chose NOT to address many of the
more heinous issues that we raised in our first article - a fact that was clearly
not lost on the investment community.  Instead, Telestone management chose
to wait nearly two full weeks to confront the growing conflagrations that

should jeopardize their public listing.  In addition to refusing to address many
of our concerns, management also disconnected one investor that appeared to
raise valid questions that TFF will recap below.  To top it off, management
blatantly misrepresented the circumstances of the auditor changes - a fact
that we believe will be picked up on by many of the class action firms currently
investigating Telestone.





At the 15:20 mark of the call on 1/24/11, Telestone management addressed
the juggling auditors - a major concern raised by TFF in our previous report. 
As we highlighted, Telestone had two auditors resign within one year, the
second of which was not disclosed until months after the resignation. 
Telestone disclosed that Mazars had resigned on July 13, 2009 in an 8K filing
(http://google.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?
FetchFilingHtmlSection1?SectionID=6736766-1159-
7337&SessionID=WMJMH6nEJqubgA7), "On July 8, 2009, Mazars CPA Limited
resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for Telestone
Technologies Corporation (the “Company”)."  Buried in Telestone's 10K, they
disclose auditor resignation number two (bold/underlined is TFF emphasis)

TabIndex=2&FilingID=7159133&companyid=64423&ppu=%252fDefault.aspx
%253fcompanyid%253d64423):





During the Company’s fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and
through July 8, 2009, the Company engaged Mazars CPA Limited previously as
the independent registered public accounting firm prior the engagement of QC
CPA Group, LLC on July 9, 2009 through January 14, 2010. QC CPA Group,
LLC performed the interim reviews of the Company’s financial statements for
the period ended June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009.  QC CPA Group,
LLC resigned on January 14, 2010 and the Company engaged Mazars CPA
Limited as the Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm
on January 18, 2010 to audit the Company’s financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2009.

It is the opinion of TFF that management lied and misrepresented the
resignations by proclaiming that the auditor changes were in fact
voluntary.  On the 1/24/11 call, Mr. Wu, who TFF devoted several paragraphs
to in our last report, stated (bold emphasis of TFF):





In the third quarter of 2009, some of our shareholders recommended that we
switch from our long-standing auditor Mazars to a U.S.-based firm called QC
CPA Group.  But soon we found out that this new auditor was not as familiar
with our business and was treating some of our ordinary receivables as long-
term ones.  Due to our high comfort level with our long-time auditor we
switched back to Mazars. 





First, the decision to switch to a U.S.-based audit firm is understandable. 
However, the decision to use an unknown firm out of Beaver Creek, Ohio does
not pass the smell test.  Secondly, this statement by management is fraught
with deceit with the clear motive of misleading investors.   The decision to
switch auditors was not benign and voluntary as management seems to
suggest.  Instead, Telestone's public filings clearly state that both auditor
changes were driven by existing auditor resignations.   TFF believes that
this statement is a violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated there
under (http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec10.html) and
(http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule10b-5.html). 





While the scope of management's discussion was quite limited, there were
other noteworthy issues.  In a press release that hit the wires around the time
the call commenced, Telestone management announced unaudited preliminary
results (finance.yahoo.com/news/Telestone-Technol...).  The numbers are
impressive when viewed in a vacuum.  But the P&L lives outside of a vacuum,
with the balance sheet and cash flow statements providing a complete picture
of financial health.  As TFF asserted in our last report, Telestone's results are
meaningless without cash flows that approximate net income.  Based on
Telestone's guidance for revenues of $131.5 million at the mid-point, this
implies Q4'10 revenues of $60.6 million ($70.9 million for first 9 months).

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/132677-telestone-technologies-part-ii-the-great-wall-of-deceit 5/26


Additionally, Telestone announced net income for 2010 of $30.75 million at the
mid-point, implying Q4'10 net income of $18.5 million ($12.6 million for first 9
months).  Amazingly, the company confessed on the call that DSO's and
accounts receivables increased dramatically.  A major focal point of the call
was again DSO's, which Mr. Wu admitted climbed to 374 days from 358 days
in 2009.  Equally concerning was the disclosure on the call that accounts
receivable increased sequentially by $47 million (from $134 million to $181
million).  To put this lunacy into perspective, using the mid-point of
guidance, the company's revenue only increased $17.5 million
quarter-over-quarter (from $43.1 million to $60.6 million), which
compares to a jump of $47 million in accounts receivable. 





At the 33:20 mark of the call, an exchange took place between management
and an investor that illustrated management's inability to reconcile any of their
numbers.  We would encourage any potential investors to listen to that
segment of the call that ended with management disconnecting the
caller mid-question (http://www.mzcan.com/cancast/us/register.php?
id=usTSTC_3&version=e).  Additionally, TFF found it very odd that
management placed the entire conference call on hold/mute for 15 seconds at
the 35:20 mark and confessed multiple times that they could not explain the
trend in the numbers that they had just provided in their prepared remarks. 
Management finally capitulated at the 39:55 mark, admitting "we can not
reconcile those [numbers] over a phone call like this" and said they would file
an 8K to reconcile the discrepancy between the 10Q disclosures. 





After digging through the September 10Q (http://google.brand.edgar-
online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?
ID=7556714&SessionID=rpAvHj8AoL5mF27), TFF believes it has discovered
the smoking gun that management was unable to reconcile.  As TFF stated in
our last report, Telestone is either booking unbilled receivables or is
misclassifying long-term A/R as short-term.  The recent management call
validated our suspicion.  On the call, Mr. Wu discussed the payment process of
the big 3 and stated (10:00 into the call),"once their payment process is
activated usually we can collect 90% of the customer volume except for
warranty related receivables that isn't due for 24 months."  This appears to be

5/19/2018 Telestone Technologies (Part II): The Great Wall of Deceit - The Forensic Factor | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/132677-telestone-technologies-part-ii-the-great-wall-of-deceit 6/26


a consistent statement with the language in the most recent 10Q,
"Approximately 10% of our professional services revenue are settled after 24
months of our warranty period."  HOWEVER, THESE STATEMENTS DO NOT
RECONCILE WITH THE DISCLOSED AMOUNT IN THE 10Q. 





TFF believes that management's stated policy of 10% of services
settling after 24 month, as well as the policy language in the 10Q does
not reconcile with the disclosed amount of A/R that is expected to be
collected after one year. The September 10Q states, "Of the retentions
balance as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, approximately
US$3,023,000 and US$903,000 respectively are expected to be collected after
one year" (Note 6 - Accounts Receivable).  If the company has $3 million that
represents 10% of the professional service revenues booked over the last 12
months, then that would imply that the maximum service revenue that
Telestone could have recognized over the past 12 months was $30 million. 
However, the trailing 12 month services revenue through Q3'10 was $66.2
million ($41.9 million first 9 mo's of 2010 and $24.3 million in Q4'09).  This
level of service revenue, which comes with 10% of revenues collected after 24
months, would imply at least $6.62 million of receivables to be collected after
one year (this doesn't even include the amounts from Q1'09 - Q3'09 which
would still be under the 24 month collection period and make the numbers
even more challenging to reconcile).  Given the fact the Big 3 purportedly
represent 99%^ of revenues, TFF sees no explanation for these
inconsistencies.  TFF is convinced that Telestone's reported financial are
irreconcilable, and management's inability to answer basic questions on the
call, solidifies our perspective.  As TFF asserted in our last report, we are
nearly certain that Telestone is recognizing revenues without invoicing
customers and/or is recognizing revenues under a percentage of completion
methodology without the necessary disclosures (unbilled receivables). 





While we were unable to find conclusive evidence that Telestone was not
invoicing customers at the time of our last report, we believe management
unwittingly provided confirmation on the investor update call.  At 8:08 into the
call, Mr. Wu defended their ballooning accounts receivable balance by stating,
"A delay in customer inspection reduced our ability to issue invoices."

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/132677-telestone-technologies-part-ii-the-great-wall-of-deceit 7/26


There is no way to interpret this statement other than Telestone has
recognized revenues, booked a receivable, and has not been able to collect
said receivables because no invoice was issued because of a delay in
inspection (approval).  WHAT MR. WU DESCRIBED IS THE EXACT DEFINTION
MOST COMPANIES USE FOR UNBILLED RECEIVABLES -“Unbilled Receivable”
means any Receivable for goods sold or services performed for the related
Obligor, and with respect to which no invoice has been submitted to such
Obligor for payment of the amount thereof"
(www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.22xj6.d.htm).


TFF believes this statement is a confession that Telestone is in fact
recognizing revenues without invoicing customers.  If we are correct,
we believe Telestone investors could face significant consequences
that should start with a restatement.  While there is nothing wrong with
percentage of completion accounting, Telestone has never disclosed this
revenue recognition policy and would need to restate past periods disclosing
unbilled receivable.  Further, as TFF has suspected, investors would be
investing with incomplete and inaccurate information.   If this is the case, and
Telestone is not a fraud (which TFF will again leave to lawyers and regulators
to determine), then this could explain: the astronomical accounts receivable,
the lack of associated cash flows, the ability to recognize revenues with
significant discretion, and the unusual warranty period when revenues are
recognized, but apparently no invoice is issued until some inspection occurs.





In addition to the significant and material misstatements that were gleaned
from the update call, TFF is equally concerned about the areas that Telestone
failed to address:





1)       Why did Telestone claim to work with Quell Corp a full 15 months
before Quell Corp was formed (despite being discussed at length in out first
report, TFF does not believe Quell was referenced in the prepared remarks)?


2)       Why are they not complying with applicable Chinese tax laws as
disclosed in their financial filings?

3)       Why did allowance for doubtful accounts decline by such a large
percentage in Q3'10?


4)       Why are the contacts listed in past Telestone press releases so
inconsistent and mysterious?


5)       Why did the company fail to include Mr. Wu in any of their presentations
or the management slide on their website?


6)       How did Mr. Wu add two years of experience on his resumes in just ten
months between his employment at China Natural Gas and China Medicines?


7)       Why have there been three people listed as Secretary of the Board, one
of whom had a New Jersey phone number and a Gmail account listed as
contact information (this is salient as well as our entire tree of oddities in our
last report)?


8)       Why are Mr. Wu and Mr. Ballard, emailing individual investors, and
potentially providing selective disclosures that are appearing on yahoo
message boards? (http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?
message_id=57397703) and 
(http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Business_%26_Finance/Investments/Sto

dview?m=tm&bn=51264&tid=34952&mid=34952&tof=44&frt=2)


9)       Given the commentary on the update call about retaining Deloitte &
Touche, when can we expect an 8K on their engagement?


10)    What was/is the involvement of Paul Kelley with Telestone?  Why did he
appear in pictures with Telestone's management on the podium of the AMEX in
2005 and Nasdaq Global Market in 2007?  (pictured and detailed -
http://sharesleuth.com/investigations/2011/01/you-wont-find-s-paul/)


11)    Does the frozen account of Winner International own Telestone shares? 
Did the company give 200,000 Telestone shares to Winner International
without disclosing that in SEC filings as Sharesleuth suggests
(http://sharesleuth.com/investigations/2011/01/you-wont-find-s-paul/)?

12)    Did MCC Group receive shares of Telestone in exchange for $50,000
loans as ShareSleuth details?
(http://sharesleuth.com/investigations/2011/01/you-wont-find-s-paul/)


13)    Does CEO Han have any remaining business relationships with MCC
Group?


14)    What is the nature of the loan that CEO Han has provided to Telestone
and why was it necessary?


15)    What is the $536,000 related party loan and why is Telestone not
collecting interest on this loan (http://www.faqs.org/sec-
filings/101115/TELESTONE-TECHNOLOGIES-CORP_10-Q/)?


16)    Which Director lent the company $4.13 million and why was this
necessary if Telestone is in sound financial health?





Like our last report, TFF is very concerned that investors are trading in
Telestone with incomplete and inaccurate information.  This concern seems
particularly germane given the rampant retail message boards and individual
investor interest.  Telestone's message boards on Yahoo Finance had
approximately 359 posts on January 24th alone!  This type of retail
involvement is wonderful for the stock market.  However, if regulators intend
to protect the retail experience, then it is paramount that they begin to
address the massive issues that are present with so many of the Chinese
reverse mergers.  TFF is hopeful that the recent attention from mainstream
publications will expedite regulatory action
(www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/01...) TFF has confidence that our
requests to the NASDAQ and SEC will not fall on deaf ears.  And if
report II does not garner appropriate attention, we are extremely
confident that our final report (NASDAQ:III) that explores the
outsourced manufacturer and provincial offices will.





As we said in our last report, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and
quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck."
