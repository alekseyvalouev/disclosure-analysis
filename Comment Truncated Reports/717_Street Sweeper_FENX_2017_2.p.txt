Fenix Parts Misses Its Nasdaq Deadline

Summary


FENX had until Feb. 13 to file quarterly financial reports in order to meet a deadline
to remain listed on Nasdaq. Fenix has missed the deadline â€¦ huge downside
catalyst.


FENX may have submitted a curative proposal in December, but Nasdaq's reaction
remains to be seen.


Delisting is serious. Most institutional investors and many smaller investors make it a
policy to never own a delisted stock, so a retreat to the over-the-counter market
triggers more decline.


The SEC had launched a probe and issued a subpoena, apparently focused on the
company's internal controls and accounting methods.


Fenix Parts (OTC:FENX) has missed its Nasdaq deadline and may face delisting.


The Westchester, Illinois scrap metal recycler was supposed to get its second quarter and
third quarter reports filed by the extended deadline of Feb. 13, 2017. That was three days
ago. Those reports have not been filed with the SEC.

Since it has been over 180 days since Fenix received its notice of deficiency, Nasdaq will
begin the delisting process.


Fenix may have submitted a curative proposal in December to Nasdaq but Nasdaq's
reaction remains to be seen. The missed deadline is a massive downside catalyst.


Getting kicked off Nasdaq could be disastrous. Delisted stocks sometimes go away and
other times go limping to the over-the-counter market.


Indeed, most institutional investors and many smaller investors make it a policy to never
own an unlisted stock, so the delisting drives these over-the-counter shares even lower ...
Sometimes these companies go into a death spiral toward bankruptcy court.


There are many examples of stocks that have gotten delisted, sustained massive price
declines and eventually evaporated.


TheStreetSweeper warned investors last fall that Fenix was under delisting threat. The
SEC had launched a probe and issued a subpoena to Fenix, apparently focused on the
company's internal controls and accounting methods.
