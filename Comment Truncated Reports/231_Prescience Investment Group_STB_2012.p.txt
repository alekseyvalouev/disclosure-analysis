Student Transportation Inc. | STB
COMPANY: Student Transportation Inc. / STB 


We believe Student Transportation (STB or “the Company”) has a flawed business and financial 


strategy.  It has undertaken a leveraged and dilutive acquisition spree that is not accretive to 


shareholders, but that benefits its bankers and management team. STB’s financing scheme appears 


dependent on continually raising fresh capital from new investors in order to pay its fixed dividend to 


existing investors, or "Borrowing from Peter to Pay Paul."  Conclusion: In the absence of new capital, 


we believe STB’s dividend would be cut, and its stock price would fall closer to our fair value estimate 


of $2.00 per share. 





STB Cannot Support its Dividend w/out Continuous Dilution 


 From 2007-2011, STB generated free cash flow of just $21m, while paying $120m of dividends and 
repurchasing $15m of 100% mgmt owned Series B stock 


 Significantly dilutive equity and convertible debt financings have been used to fund the dividend gap; 
$180m of equity has been raised, causing the share count to balloon by 33% per annum, which further 
exacerbates the dividend burden 


 Based on our analysis, STB’s free cash flow will not cover its dividend again in FY 2013, placing the 
dividend at severe risk of being cut and potentially pushing the stock price toward our fair value 
estimate, ~70% below current levels 


Debt-Fueled M&A Benefiting Management, Not Shareholders 


 School bus industry has largely been consolidated by competitors in the past  
10 yrs leaving many small, independent operators of lower quality as targets 


 STB’s acquisition strategy provides no synergies, is driving top-line revenue growth, with no 
improvement in EPS and limited free cash flow improvement without sacrificing critical capital 
expenditures  


 Management bonuses tied primarily to revenue growth vs. EPS growth metrics used by peers, resulting 
in misaligned incentive structure to grow revenues at any cost; significant goodwill accumulation 
indicates possible overpayments 


STB’s Capacity to Raise New Capital Appears to Be Hitting a Wall 


 STB listed its shares on the Nasdaq in 2011 after trading for years in Canada. Based on its business 
model, we believe the company needed a new venue to issue more stock; STB quickly issued C$75m of 
stock to pay down debt, as it had no excess cash flow to reduce debt, pay the dividend, and support its 
high capex needs 


 STB has almost no institutional investor support; ~66% of the stock is held by retail investors. STB’s 
capacity for finding new retail investors may be limited 


Significant Overvaluation to Peers and Underlying Asset Value  


 STB’s valuation at 11.5x EV/EBITDAR is a significant premium to transportation deal values of 5.0x – 
7.0x; the company’s EV/Vehicle for its 9,000 vehicles is $87,000 vs. ~ $75,000 for the cost of a brand 
new school bus 


 Conclusion:  We believe STB’s shares are worth no more than $2.00 and that they are at risk of a 
precipitous decline in the absence of the continued dilution that appears necessary to support its 
dividend

Shares of Student Transportation (Nasdaq/TSX: STB) are trading near an all-time high from retail investors who are 


attracted to the feel good story of investing in a company that provides school bus services to children. As a return on 


their investment, the company is providing a monthly dividend with an optically attractive dividend yield of 8%.  In 


reality, STB's business and financial strategy benefits bankers and management, and is not accretive to shareholders. 


STB's financing scheme relies on raising increasing capital from new shareholders and creditors to maintain its irrationally 


high dividend, which is akin to taking money from Peter to pay Paul. As a result, in the absence of new capital, we believe 


STB's dividend would ultimately be cut, and its stock price would fall closer to our fair value target of $2.00 per share, or 


70% below the current stock price. As shown below, STB has never been able to cover its dividend from its operating free 


cash flow and is projected to fall short again in FY 2013 (Appendix 3).   





Instead, STB has repeatedly raised money through dilutive security issuances from new investors to pay a dividend to an 


ever expanding group of existing and new investors.   For example, STB recently listed their shares on the Nasdaq in 


September 2011, and wasted no time tapping new investors for C$75m in February 2012 with a dilutive stock offering.  


We believe the company’s listing on the Nasdaq is a strong signal that they have largely exhausted their financing options 


from the Canadian market.  The dividend is really the only thing attracting retail investors to their stock, meaning that 


any strain in financial markets going forward could have severe consequences for the stability of the dividend.  


Growth Story Fantasy 


The school transportation industry is fragmented, but dominated by two large foreign competitors that have already 


consolidated a majority of the industry. STB has been selling investors on their acquisition growth strategy given the 


anemic organic growth in the industry. STB has acquired 47 independent school bus companies over the years in smaller 


markets where they believe there are lower levels of competition and operating costs. While on the surface this makes 


intuitive sense, the company’s own financial results do not support the conclusion that the strategy is yielding benefits. 


There are no revenue synergies and few cost synergies to justify STB’s levered acquisition spree. Overall, the economics 


of the student transportation industry are highly competitive, capital intensive, increasingly regulated, and result in low 


margins and returns to shareholders.

Misaligned Incentives: Management and Bankers Win, Shareholders Lose 


STB is a banker’s dream client because of all the debt and equity capital they require, M&A deals they complete, and fuel 


hedges they execute. In return for the millions of fees that STB pays banks, the company receives glowing “strong buy” 


recommendations and unjustified price targets backing their levered acquisition spree. Of course, STB’s bankers have no 


accountability or alignment with the shareholders, but what about STB’s management and their alignment and incentive 


structure? STB’s management owns less than 1% of the common stock, but instead gets rewarded with a preferential 


Series B stock that allows them to regularly sell shares back to the company. STB’s management has liberally sold millions 


of dollars of stock back to the company, while virtually no common shares have been repurchased under the common 


stock buyback program. Worse yet, the management is rewarding themselves with bonuses tied primarily to revenue 


growth, instead of measures that are directly measurable to shareholders such as EPS or cash flow growth. This allows 


the management to reward themselves richly for growing revenues at any price. Investors need look no farther for 


evidence of overpayment than the massive goodwill and intangible accumulation on the company’s balance sheet, which 


now totals 44% of total assets.  As another measure of STB’s outrageous management compensation plan, the founder 


and CEO reaped $1.8 million of total compensation in 2011, which is greater than STB’s total 2011 EPS. The amount is 


also larger than almost any CEO of a publicly traded North American transportation company, even those with enterprise 


values 4x larger (Appendix 5).  


Retail Driven Ownership Leading to Massive Stock Overvaluation  


Looking at STB’s shareholder base, it is entirely clear that institutional investors have refused to own shares of the 


company.  As of March 31, 2012, 66% of shares were in the hands of retail investors, leaving only 33% of the shares in 


the hands of institutions.  However, even this number is misleading due to the fact that just two institutions own 


approximately 21%.  Management owns less than 1% of the common stock of the company.  


Based on the points described above, it is clear that institutional investors and management are completely unwilling to 


hold the stock at any price.  Yet, retail investors have driven the valuation up to a level which is nearly double that of 


comparable companies. STB currently trades at 11.5x EV/ 2012E EBITDAR and 62x Price / FY 2013E EPS vs. peers which 


trade at only 5-8x and 7-12x, respectively.  No transportation company has ever been sold in a private transaction at a 


multiple that even comes close to STB’s current value. It seems clear that retail investors have simply ignored the 


valuation of STB, its flawed strategy, and misaligned incentive structure. The absurdity of the company’s valuation is also 


seen from the perspective that investors are ascribing a value of $87,000 per school bus, which on average is 6 years old; 


brand new buses can be purchased for much less. 


Conclusion:   Buyer Beware 


As with any financing scheme, the game ends when the company can no longer raise money from new investors to 


continue paying out existing ones. STB’s recent listing on the Nasdaq, rapid stock offering, and weak insider and 


institutional ownership are clear signals that the company is having difficulty finding greater support for their misguided 


acquisition strategy. Meanwhile, global tightness and instability in financial markets does not bode well for capital 


intensive business such as STB’s going forward.  Investors are strongly cautioned to consider the misalignment of 


incentives with this company, and the future security of the dividend.

Student Transportation Inc. was founded in 1997 and today is reportedly the third largest provider of school bus 


transportation services in North America with 9,000 vehicles and revenues of $355 million as of LTM 3/31/12. The 


company’s operations are located in Ontario, Canada and 15 states across America. The company’s primary service of 


transporting students to and from school (“home-to-school” busing) comprises approximately 86% of revenue. Charter 


services for athletic events, field trips, summer camp routes and other non-school related charter services and 


extracurricular activities account for 12% of revenues. The remaining 2% of revenue comes from a non-operating interest 


in oil and gas properties the company acquired through its acquisition of Canadex in 2008.  











The company has grown its business primarily by executing on its A-B-C strategy. Acquisitions have formed the basis for 


the majority of the company’s growth over the years.  STB has completed 47 companies since its inception. As we’ll 


explore in greater detail in this report, many of these acquisitions are privately owned, independent regional operators. 


Bidding activities are directed toward school districts that have chosen to solicit bids from private operators for their 


school bus transportation contracts. These contracts are primarily awarded by school districts based on a competitive 


public bidding process or Request for Proposal, on the basis of the “lowest responsible bid.” Lowest responsible bids 


enable school districts to consider factors other than price in awarding a bid, such as safety records and initiatives, driver 


training programs, community involvement and quality of service. Conversions are focused on privatizing school districts 


in regions contiguous to the company’s existing operations. Approximately 68% of the school bus market is operated by 


school districts, which allows companies like STB to claim there is a large opportunity to grow by converting school 


districts to outsourced operation at substantial cost savings. To date, STB has completed only 10 conversions.

The company was initially founded in 1997 by Dennis Gallagher upon his departure from Laidlaw Inc. Prior to joining 


Laidlaw, Mr. Gallagher sold his school bus transportation company to Laidlaw in 1987 and held a senior position with the 


company. The formation of Student Transportation nearly faltered from the start, when Laidlaw filed an injunctive 


motion claiming its executives breached their non-compete contracts, although the courts ultimately denied Laidlaw’s 


motion for preliminary and supplemental injunctive relief.1  Initial seed capital was provided by Golder, Thoma, Cressey, 


Rauner (GTCR), a private equity firm in Chicago. The company came public in Canada in 2004 on the Toronto Stock 


Exchange through an Income Participating Securities (“IPS”) offering of C$ 116 million which included IPS units and 


Senior Subordinated Notes paying 14%. Over time, the company has eliminated the IPS structure and Subordinated 


Notes through exchange offers, convertible bond and stock offerings. 





Given that the origins of the company’s management and business operations are primarily in the U.S., the choice of 


listing in Canada through the IPS structure appears motivated by the ability to access retail investor demand for income 


yielding securities. To this day, the company has maintained a generous dividend policy, and pays a monthly dividend 


payment of $0.046 cents per share which provides a current dividend yield of 8.0%. The company’s initial equity 


sponsors no longer own shares; today’s shareholders are predominately Canadian and US retail investors who own 66% 


of the shares. The two largest institutional shareholders are Societe Nationale de Chemins de fer France (“SNCF” 12%) 


and Caisse de Depot (9%).

In July 2011, STB made its trading debut for its Class A common shares in the U.S. on the Nasdaq. According to the 


company, the listing “Creates access to a larger shareholder base and allows U.S. institutional and retail investors to trade 


shares more easily and with greater liquidity."  Since the listing event, we don’t believe STB has garnered serious 


investment from any major U.S. financial institution.2   However, we believe the company has used the listing to attract 


additional retail investors who are gravitating towards the dividend. As we will explore later in this report, we believe the 


dividend is a fundamentally flawed financial policy, which the company is highly dependent on paying to sustain its 


investment appeal, and attract new equity capital for its levered growth trajectory.

As indicated in the corporate diagram above, the company’s management owns 100% of the Series B shares. The table 


below provides additional detail on the Series B share classes. The management owns ~1% of the common shares and is 


currently receiving Series B-3 shares as part of their annual Equity Incentive Plan (“EIP”). The Series B is entitled to 


dividends and receives certain preferences to common shareholders that are noteworthy, particularly a put option which 


allows management to force the company to repurchase their shares in annual amounts. This put option is accounted for 


as a liability on the company’s balance sheet, and we will evaluate the impact of management’s exercising these options 


on cash flow later in the report.

The fundamentals in the student transportation market are characterized by limited barriers to entry and few 


proprietary points of differentiation to customers, capital and labor intensity, thin and pressured margins, increasing 


regulatory requirements, and constrained growth opportunities.  


Limited Barriers to Entry; Few Proprietary Aspects of the Business 


There are limited barriers to entering the student bus transportation market. Anyone that can purchase or lease a bus, 


obtain the proper licenses and insurance, can operate and compete in this market. Contracts with school districts are 


announced publicly and bid specifications are provided to any interested party. In advance of bidding, any prospective 


bidder can obtain information regarding that school district's prior or existing school bus contracts. Prospective bidders 


may also obtain information on bids that were submitted to the school board in the past in connection with existing or 


prior contracts from competitors. The awarding of business contracts typically applies the “lowest responsible bidder” 


principle to determining which carrier is selected.  While price is the predominant factor to evaluating this principle, 


other factors such as safety, quality of service, community involvement, etc. may be taken into consideration.  


The industry is largely fragmented with some 500,000 buses in operation across the U.S. However, among the privatized, 


outsourced segment, the market has been largely consolidated in the past 10 years by UK publicly owned FirstGroup and 


National Express whom control approximately 52% of the privatized market. The top 10 providers account for 67% of the 


privatized market.  The current industry concentration presents challenges to the acquisition strategy of companies such 


as Student Transportation, and will be more formally analyzed later in this report. 





Overall, significant competition, limited barriers to entry, and few proprietary aspects of the business that limit the ability 


for one bus company to differentiate itself, constrain the upside potential of the student bus transportation market.

Capital and Labor Intensive 


The school bus transportation market is characterized as capital intensive. New school buses can cost $75,000, have a 


useful life of 12 years, and require significant maintenance capital expenditure costs.  In practical terms, this means bus 


operators need to replace 8 %– 10% of their fleet each year. Keeping a younger bus fleet is advantageous as it helps 


minimize maintenance expense. Buses typically have low fuel mileage economy and require a large labor force to 


operate. Key components of operating capital costs include fuel, wages and salaries and benefits, insurance, regulatory 


compliance, and maintenance expenses. Wages and salaries are the largest cost of operations, with labor unions playing 


a large role in the industry. Approximately 15% of Student Transportation’s workforce is unionized. 


Revenue and Cost Mismatch Pressuring Margins 


As illustrated earlier, revenue contracts are awarded by school districts, which typically last from three to eight years. 


These contracts are primarily fixed price contracts and may include inflation escalators tied to the Consumer Price Index 


(“CPI”). Currently, the non-seasonally adjusted all U.S. CPI is 2.7% as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  However, 


on the operating cost side of the industry, expenses are primarily variable and rising substantially. Take for example diesel 


prices: U.S. No. 2 Diesel Prices have risen 11% in the past year and 86% in the past two years according to the U.S. Energy 


Information Administration (“EIA”).3   Likewise, significant unionization of labor forces in the industry has resulted in 


increases in salaries in wages, while healthcare costs have also risen significantly.  Furthermore, insurance policies must 


be renewed annually, and these costs have also been rising in recent years. A recent study by the U.S. Department of 


Transportation (“DOT”) in June 2009 indicated school bus fatal crashes represented the highest proportion of all bus 


crashes analyzed between 1999 and 2005.4   The overall mismatch between headline CPI inflation, and real inflation costs 


of the underlying business pose serious risks to levered school bus operators. For example, the industry’s fourth largest 


operator, Atlantic Express Transportation, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, and upon emergence from Chapter 11 


in 2003, later went through another financial restructuring in 2009.5   


Increasing Regulatory Environment 


Student bus transportation companies are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to safety, driver 


qualifications, insurance, worker overtime and other matters promulgated by various federal and state regulatory 


agencies including, among others, state motor vehicle agencies, state departments of education, the Federal Highway 


and Safety Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health 


Administration.  Regulatory considerations are increasingly being factored into decisions by operators to remain in the 


industry. For example, Stagecoach recently cited regulatory considerations as a factor for selling its Dairyland business to 


Student Transportation in November 2011, even though it had a favorable financial profile.6  The Dairyland business and 


its financial impact on Student Transportation is analyzed more formally later in this report.

Outsourcing Market Share Shift Slow to Materialize 


The growth of the industry through “conversions,” or outsourcing of bus operations to private contracts, has been slow 


to evolve. Currently, approximately 68% of the market is still operated by school districts, which in theory leaves a large 


market opportunity for private contracts to gain market share. Commentary provided by industry participants such as 


First Student (FirstGroup) and National Express also indicates that the market share shift to conversions has only been 


~2% in the past few years. In practical terms, outsourcing has been slow to materialize due to municipal funding 


pressures, competing priorities for other issues faced by school districts, overall bureaucracy, labor union intervention, 


and limited changes in the total student population and like-for-like mileage growth. Take for example, the recently 


released report in May 2012 by the New York School Board Association. The results of the study indicate that 30.9% of 


NY school districts plan to reduce transportation in their 2012 – 2013 budgets.7  On a national level, the effects of 


reducing student transportation needs are becoming more tangible. For the month of April, the U.S. Labor Department 


reported that school-bus related employment saw the biggest decline in jobs for the month among all industries.8   


These data points cast doubt on the industry growth story. 


Now that we’ve provided an overview of the industry’s conditions, we can analyze whether Student Transportation’s 


aggressive acquisition strategy makes sense. According to the company’s recent February 2012 investor presentation, 


they have acquired 47 companies and target purchase price multiples of 3.5x – 5.5x EBITDA. Given the fragmentation of 


the industry beyond the largest providers, the company has focused on smaller operators in rural markets where they 


believe there are lower levels of competition and operating costs. While on the surface this makes intuitive sense, the 


company’s own financial results and incentive structure do not support the conclusion that the strategy is yielding 


benefits. 


Let’s first look at the management incentive structure of the company. The company’s Short-Term Incentive Plan 


(“STIP”) provides that 40% of management’s cash bonus is tied to annual revenue growth, with another 20% as 


discretionary. A comparison of small-cap North American transportation firms reveals that Student Transportation is the 


only company tying short-term management bonuses primarily to revenue. The most common compensation factors in 


the industry are EPS and return on capital targets. Therefore, we conclude that STB’s managers have a strong incentive 


to maximize revenue, and not cash flow or capital efficiency.

Acquisitions of bus companies appear to offer few synergies to justify aggressive empire building. There are no 


identifiable revenue synergies from adding target companies. In an acquisition, Student Transportation adds its acquired 


contracts with school districts, physical assets, and employees. There may be some very marginal economies of scale in 


negotiating price concessions in purchasing fuel, new vehicles, and other related services. However, adding companies 


and entering new territories and regions also has added integration costs and expenses, such as adding new terminals 


and dispatchers. Overall, it does not appear that there is a net synergy benefit from an acquisition strategy in the 


student bus transportation industry.  Take for example the company’s recently announced acquisition of Dairyland for 


$47 million. By analyzing the company’s recently filed pro-forma financial statements, we can assess the potential free 


cash flow impact.9  A cursory view of the deal indicates that STB’s free cash flow margin would increase from 7.4% to 


8.4% or 100 basis points from the deal. However, this ignores any incremental capital expenditures required from adding 


this new territory in Wisconsin to the company’s geographic profile. A sensitivity analysis suggests that any additional 


expense above $3 million for this acquisition negates free cash flow margin expansion. A careful review of Student 


Transportation’s acquisition announcements indicate a steady disclosure of the revenue accretion from transactions, but 


provide no information on synergies or incremental costs associated with integration (See Appendix 3).

Other challenges faced by Student Transportation of maintaining its acquisition strategy include the expense of 


identifying and sourcing a pipeline of actionable investment targets. With over 4,000 private contractors in the market, 


many local family businesses, the company is dependent on acquiring small operators who want to sell to Student 


Transportation versus retain control, or sell to a competitor who might have greater financial resources to pay for the 


business. Many of the company’s competitors have all been active in the M&A market in recent years, and have shown 


the willingness to pay for the right target, not just any target at all. See the section on Valuation for a complete list of 


M&A deals in the sector and how these deals compare with Student Transportation’s overall company valuation.   


One way to assess the relative aggressiveness of the Company’s acquisition spree is to look at the goodwill accumulation 


that has been associated with these transactions. Intangibles primarily include contract values, non-compete 


agreements, and trade names. Goodwill is the excess of the deal price over working capital, PP&E, and intangibles less 


assumed liabilities.  Goodwill and Intangible assets on the company’s balance sheet currently total over $221 million or 


44% of the company’s reported assets. On average, 35% of the recent purchase price from acquisitions is attributable to 


goodwill.

With our foregoing discussion on the challenging industry dynamics and Student Transportation’s aggressive acquisition 


strategy, we are now in a position to assess if the company has an attractive and sustainable financial business model. 


The charts below show a remarkable result about the company’s capital allocation and margin profile. First, using 


publicly reported information in segment disclosures, we can compare Student Transportation’s adjusted operating 


margin (EBIT) with its two largest competitors, First Student and National Express. The chart shows very clearly that the 


company’s margins trail its competitors by 500 – 600 basis points, and their margins have been under pressure in the 


past few fiscal years. Meanwhile, both competitors have recently undertaken restructuring efforts in their North 


American student bus operations to improve and stabilize margins.  


However, the two most striking observations from the charts are related to the company’s capital allocation strategy in 


the past five and a half years. From these charts we can see clearly the sources and uses of their cash flow, and can reach 


some conclusions about the financial model.  Looking at the sources of cash, we see the company has generated $166 


million from operations, but has raised more money from selling equity in the amount of $180 million in the same 


period. Approximately $212 million has been used for acquisitions, $146 million for capital expenditures, and $120 


million for the dividend have been used. Actual free cash flow, or cash from operations less capital expenditures, has 


amounted to only $21 million. Typically, it would be prudent to use free cash flow for discretionary measures such as 


debt reduction, dividends, or share repurchases. However, the company’s free cash is significantly less than the amount 


used for dividends and Series B stock repurchased from management.

Looking more closely at the capital allocation chart, we can see that cash from operations has been largely stagnant in 


the past three years, while total debt funded for acquisitions has increased by $154 million.  














Leverage Levels are High and Will Increase with More Acquisitions 


The escalation of the company’s debt outstanding and margin pressure is concerning from the viewpoint that free cash 


flow has not increased commensurately. At the start of 2012, the company’s liquidity was not adequate with less than $4 


million of cash on the balance sheet, and under $30 million of borrowing capacity under its credit facility. The company’s 


financial strategy has been to borrow short term for acquisitions, and then term out the debt with dilutive securities 


(straight equity issuance or convertible bonds). The company has the ability to exercise a $100 million accordion in its 


credit facility as well.  According to our analysis, earlier this year the company was close to its covenant levels of 5.0x 


total leverage and 3.0x senior leverage. The covenants reference the company’s EBITDA metric and allow for pro forma 


adjustments based on the acquisitions being made. Accordingly, the company recently announced a C$75 million new

equity raise at $6.85 per share on February 28, 2012. We also consider the company’s use of off-balance sheet operating 


leases amounting to over $70 million a form of debt. For a complete overview of the company’s capital structure see 


Appendix 1. With the new financial cushion, the company has stated that they are currently evaluating additional 


acquisitions. 








Transportation companies do not typically support such high levels of leverage due to many risk factors. The company 


has made use of the fact that it has contracted revenues of 3 – 8 years, and over 184 contracts which provide revenue 


diversity. However, 26% and 29% of its contracts mature in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and there is no guarantee that 


contracts will be renewed; however, the company tends to have success in renewing contracts in the 90% range. With 


school districts under pressure to cut costs, re-opening contracts are expected to be fiercely competed. The company 


also has fuel protection measures in 60% of its contracts, with an additional 20% of exposures hedged through annual 


fixed-price fuel contracts with suppliers. However, pricing under these fuel contracts has annual rollover risk. To 


illustrate, pricing under new contracts has increased 30% year-over-year as of the current quarter.  





How Shareholder Friendly is the Dividend and Series B Stock Repurchases 


In the context of a management team that is highly incentivized to grow revenues, levering up to acquire companies, and 


not growing free cash flow, how wise is the dividend and management owned Series B stock repurchases? As we’ve 


illustrated earlier and in the chart below, the company’s free cash flow is not sufficient enough to cover either the 


dividend or Series B repurchases. The company also recently announced a common stock repurchase program up to $5 


million, but has only purchased $100,000 of common stock. Where is the money coming from to fund these payments? 


The answer is that the money is coming from both creditors and new investors through share issuance. Put in this 


perspective, the dividend is not so friendly after all, but rather akin to taking money from Peter to pay Paul. The company 


will have to continue attracting new sources of capital to grow and maintain its current financial practices; otherwise, the 


dividend will be in jeopardy. As more shares get issued, the total annual cash dividend payment increases. Given that 


leverage is already at elevated levels and will increase with more acquisitions, the most likely outcome for the company 


is continued stock issuance in the foreseeable future. The common stock repurchase announcement also does not look 


friendly from the perspective that the company has repurchased $15 million of management’s Series B stock since 2007.

The Series B has also been collecting dividend payments too, which further incentivizes management to maintain the 


dividend.   











Chart Observations:  Cash from operations (CFO) per share peaked in 2009 and has been under pressure even as 


significant acquisitions have occurred. Free cash flow (FCF) per share is significantly lower than CFO per share; the gap 


has been widening recently. Dividends per share are higher than EPS, CFO or FCF per share. Cash for dividends and Series

By almost every objective valuation metric, the company’s stock price appears overvalued. We have analyzed the 


company from the perspective of relative stock price performance, comparable trading companies, historical valuation, 


broker target prices, and precedent M&A deal values.  





Relative Performance 


STB’s share price has outperformed all its relevant peers and the Dow Jones Transportation Index in the past two years. 


This outperformance is despite the fact that the company’s diluted share count has grown at a compounded average 


annual growth rate of 33%, and per share metrics have also struggled to match the rise in share price. In light of our 


previously highlighted concerns, STB’s share price is terribly overvalued. 











Comparable Companies Analysis 


By analyzing a set of comparable companies in the student bus transportation and North American mid-cap trucking 


universe, we see that an appropriate valuation range is 6.0x – 7.0x Adjusted Enterprise Value to EBITDAR. We have 


adjusted our financial figures to account for sizeable off-balance sheet operating leases that are commonly used in the 


industry. We treat these operating leases as a form of contractual debt and capitalize them through an NPV analysis. 


Student Transportation makes use of these operating leases in their business. On an Adjusted Enterprise Value to 


Revenue basis, an appropriate valuation range is 0.8x – 1.2x

Historical Valuation 


The following charts illustrate the company’s historical valuation in the past few fiscal years. The most interesting 


observation relates to the company’s enterprise value to vehicle fleet. A new school bus can cost up to $75,000, while 


the enterprise value to vehicle ratio at 3/31/12 implies a valuation in excess of $90,000. The average age of the 


company’s fleet is approximately 6 years old. Put in this context, the valuation implies a  


25% premium to the value of brand new vehicle fleet. 











Precedent M&A Valuations 


Another sensible approach to evaluating Student Transportation’s intrinsic value is to look at precedent acquisitions in 


the student bus and transportation market. Fortunately, there are ample transactions to review that point to a consistent 


firm valuation. A very relevant and recent transaction comparable is National Express’ $200 million acquisition of 


Petermann in September 2011. Petermann is currently the 6th largest student bus operator in the U.S. This deal valued 


Petermann at 1.3x EV/Revenues and 6.8x EV/EBITDA. On average, the analysis suggests valuations in range of 6.0x – 8.0x 


EV/EBITDA and 0.70x – 1.3x EV/Sales.

Broker Price Targets 


Student Transportation is currently covered by 4 brokers in Canada and 1 in the U.S., all of which have recently assisted 


the company to raise capital. The average analyst price target is $7.45 per share. Given the current stock price of 


approximately $7.10, the shares appear fully valued with limited upside potential.

Target Stock Price 


We arrive at our share price target of $2.00 by applying realistic multiples to revenues, 2013E EPS and EBITDA based on 


the comparable companies and precedent transaction analyses. Given STB’s current share price of $7.10, we believe the 


stock is a strong sell and materially overvalued.

Summary of Flawed Financing Scheme 














The cycle of buying non-cash flow accretive deals, raising debt and stock, and  
paying out high dividends and stock repurchases cannot continue indefinitely.  


Raising capital from creditors and stockholders to payback stockholders with dividends 
is not a value enhancing strategy in the long-run.

STB is increasingly dependent on releasing promotional “news” to attract new shareholders. Below is an example of a 


recent press release designed more to promote the company to investors, rather than to deliver material news for 


shareholders  


Student Transportation Inc. CEO Predicts Historic Shift in Yellow School Bus Market 


Cites Five Trends That Will Change the Way Kids Get to School 


WALL, N.J., June 14, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Student Transportation Inc. (STI) (TSX:STB) (Nasdaq:STB) Founder and CEO Denis J. Gallagher 
challenged government officials and school districts to find creative solutions for America's aging public-owned school bus fleet and said he is ready 
to raise the capital needed to replace out-dated vehicles and increase jobs for domestic vehicle manufacturers that protect our students and the 
environment. 


"By some estimates, the average age of a school bus in America has increased more than 50 percent in the last decade," Gallagher said. "School 
district budgets are being slashed and school-owned transportation departments are slow to order new equipment." 


"Pupil transportation is the single largest system of public transportation in the United States and approximately 65 percent of all school buses are 
owned and operated by local school districts or states that lack the necessary capital to invest in new vehicles," Gallagher said. 


"In South Carolina, for example, where the Boeing Corporation recently began production of the Dreamliner 787, the most technologically 
advanced aircraft in the world, students are transported to school in the oldest school bus fleet in the nation. There is a major disconnect here; the 
Governor and state legislators understand this and are working hard to provide solutions. Our solution for South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, 
Texas and many other states facing similar issues is to let STI and other contractors bring in new capital. We need safer, more fuel efficient 
equipment on our roads and we need to create domestic manufacturing jobs today." 


Gallagher cited five trends that will lead to a historic shift in the yellow school bus market. 


1. Taxpayers will demand that local school boards challenge the status quo and contract transportation services. Doing so provides the capital 
necessary to upgrade fleets, improve service, save taxes, reduce long term pension costs, create new revenues for states and allow local school 
boards to focus on education. 


2. Public-private partnerships will evolve and develop to where school districts and contractors share responsibilities to provide the safest, most 
cost efficient service by working together, utilizing facilities and taking advantage of private capital to invest in transportation so schools can 
redirect current budgeted dollars back into the classroom. 


3. Parents whose school bus service is curtailed or eliminated by budget cuts will buy transportation services direct from contractors or through a 
partially subsidized program from their school district. The result will dramatically reduce costs for schools, reduce traffic congestion and unsafe 
carpools, and lower the environmental impact when large numbers of parents drive children to school. It is estimated that for every one bus taken 
off the road 36 additional cars are added. 


4. The traditional yellow school bus will be transformed with technology that will connect students to a host of subscription services including Wi-
Fi, real-time parental safety alerts and educational programming. 


5. New investments by contractors will increase demand for CNG, propane and biofuel school buses creating a healthier environment for school 
children and lower costs of operations. 


Gallagher said, "Our fleet of over 9,000 vehicles has an average age of only five years. Our access to capital today is tremendous. Our ability to 
manage drivers, install safety and maintenance programs, and provide new advanced technology systems is unprecedented. Our family of 
professional drivers, dispatchers, maintenance technicians, terminal managers and support staff are committed to providing the safest and most 
reliable service. States need solutions, these are ones that work. The school bus is the safest form of transportation and we can provide this 
service, hire the district's current employees and in the end, save teacher jobs."

STB reported a significant decline in capital expenditures in 2011 on an absolute basis and relative to its growing fleet of 


buses. This result begs the question: Is STB trying to artificially inflate its free cash flow, and boost its stock price, by 


under-spending on capital expenditures? 





The significant decline in reported 2011 capital expenditures does not appear to be related to greater usage of off-


balance sheet vehicle or operating leases.
