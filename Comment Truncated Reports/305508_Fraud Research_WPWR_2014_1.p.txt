Well	Power:	A	Promoted	Shell	Company	That	Will	Continue	To	Crash
Mar.	7,	2014	12:37	PM	ET10	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


Summary


WPWR	is	a	$65	million	shell	company	with	assets	consisting	of	one	licensing
agreement	acquired	for	$400,000.


There	is	an	ongoing	multi-million	dollar	stock-promotion	campaign	for	WPWR	in	an
effort	to	convince	naive	investors	to	buy	the	stock.


WPWR	does	not	own	the	technology	that	is	continually	referenced	in	press	releases
and	on	their	website.


Editor's	Note:	This	article	covers	stocks	trading	at	less	than	$1	per	share	and/or	with	less
than	a	$100	million	market	cap.	Please	be	aware	of	the	risks	associated	with	these	stocks.


Well	Power	Inc.	(OTC:WPWR)	is	a	shell	company,	as	defined	by	Rule	12b-2	of	the
Exchange	Act,	and	it	has	very	minimal	assets.	The	company's	website	attempts	to	create
excitement	about	proprietary	technology	and	clean	power,	despite	the	fact	WPWR	doesn't
own	any	technologies	at	all.


According	to	the	Securities	Act	of	1933,	a	shell	company:


Has	no	operations;	and	either	no	or	nominal	assets;	assets	consisting	of	solely	cash	and
cash	equivalents;	or	assets	consisting	of	any	amount	of	cash	and	cash	equivalents	and
nominal	other	assets.


This	is	an	empty	shell	company	with	one	license	agreement,	yet	it	boasts	a	$65-million
market	cap.	Because	there	is	no	operational	business	and	the	stock	price	is	based	solely
on	an	ongoing	stock-promotion	campaign,	WPWR	represents	one	of	the	best
opportunities	for	short	sellers.

7/18/2019 Well Power: A Promoted Shell Company That Will Continue To Crash - Well Power, Inc. (OTCMKTS:WPWR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2074893-well-power-a-promoted-shell-company-that-will-continue-to-crash 2/10


We	have	attempted	to	contact	Well	Power,	Inc.	by	phone	for	several	weeks	regarding	our
concerns	about	the	company	and	the	ongoing	promotion,	and	have	never	received	a
response.	Emails	were	also	not	replied	to.


The	Business


Well	Power	Inc.	is	the	exclusive	distributor	of	Wellhead	Micro-Refinery	Units	(MRUs)	for
the	state	of	Texas.	Additionally,	the	company	has	first	right	of	refusal	on	additional
territories	within	the	U.S.	The	operational	business	is	a	result	of	a	licensing	agreement
with	ME	Resource	Corp.	(OTC:MEEXF)	("MEC"),	and	is	valid	for	five	years.	The	company
agreed	to	a	consideration	of	$400,000	for	the	licensing	agreement	with	ME	Resources.


According	to	an	8-K	dated	Jan.	22,	2014,	WPWR's	goal	is	to	provide	an	economically
viable	method	for	developing	wasted-gas	opportunities	in	the	oil	and	gas	sector	into
revenue	streams	and	doing	so	with	minimal	capital	expenditure.


The	Technology


A	Micro-Refinery	Unit	(MRU)	combines	commercial	technologies	with	a	micro-
synthesizing	system.	With	the	addition	of	catalytic	reactors	and	power-generation
components,	various	liquid	and	power	outputs	can	be	achieved.	WPWR's	cost	is	$800,000
per	MRU,	which	includes	a	container-sized	unit	with	the	capacity	to	transform	100,000
cubic	feet	of	natural	gas	per	day	into	a	variety	of	clean	power	and	engineered	fuels.

(Source:	Company	8-K)


Well	Power	Inc.	has	obtained	only	the	license	to	distribute	the	micro	refinery	units	in
Texas.	The	company	didn't	acquire	any	operations	of	MEC,	didn't	enter	into	any	joint
venture	with	MEC,	and	didn't	hire	any	of	MEC's	employees.


WPWR's	business	plan	is	to	provide	oil	and	gas	producers	a	method	of	transforming
otherwise-wasted	natural	gas	into	valued	end-products,	including	engineered	fuel.


The	Big	Problem


Well	Power	Inc.	merely	owns	the	distribution	rights	for	Texas	and	possibly	other	territories
throughout	the	U.S.	The	company	doesn't	own	the	technology.	In	fact,	the	technology	is
owned	by	MEEXF.	If	the	MRU	technology	is	a	viable	solution	for	oil	and	gas	companies,
investors	should	begin	researching	MEEXF.	WPWR	currently	trades	with	a	$65-million
market	cap	and	owns	none	of	the	technology.	Meanwhile,	MEEXF	trades	with	a	$15-
million	market	cap,	so	if	the	technology	proves	to	be	successful,	the	clear	value	will	be	in
owning	shares	of	MEEXF.


One	of	the	Most	Actively	Traded	OTC	Stocks


On	a	daily	basis,	WPWR	ranks	among	the	most	active	OTC	stocks	in	terms	of	dollar
volume,	and	the	liquidity	is	entirely	attributable	to	a	$4.1-million	stock-promotion	campaign
spearheaded	by	StockTips.com	co-editor,	Mike	Statler.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2074893-well-power-a-promoted-shell-company-that-will-continue-to-crash 4/10


The	combination	of	email	rhetoric	and	a	professionally	produced	and	very	convincing
marketing	video	is	the	sole	reason	WPWR	currently	is	one	of	the	hottest	stocks	in	the
OTC	market.


The	Stock	Promotion


The	notion	is	completely	backward	that	WPWR	trades	with	a	$65-million	market	cap	while
MEEXF	is	worth	$15	million.	However,	it	becomes	clearer	when	you	consider	the	recent
catalyst	for	Well	Power	Inc.'s	stock	movement.	In	2013,	WPWR	was	worth	$0.25	a	share,
and	the	market	was	completely	inactive.	Before	the	50-for-1	forward	split	that	became
effective	on	Jan.	6,	2014,	there	were	2,150,000	shares	outstanding.	This	would	value
Well	Power	Inc.	at	$537,500.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2074893-well-power-a-promoted-shell-company-that-will-continue-to-crash 5/10


However,	due	to	the	50-for-1	forward	split	and	the	stock-promotion	campaign	that	is	easily
identifiable	in	the	chart	below,	the	company's	market	cap	increased	to	$65	million,	valuing
the	business	at	120	times	greater	than	just	a	few	months	prior.


For	those	unfamiliar	with	StockTips.com,	it	is	one	of	the	world's	largest	penny-stock
promotion	groups	and	currently	is	managing	a	$4.1-million	budget	to	promote	WPWR.
Prior	to	this	campaign	(Point	'A'),	the	stock	had	not	traded	a	single	share	for	months.
However,	during	the	first	13	trading	days	of	the	promotion,	the	stock	has	climbed	from
$0.20	to	$0.83,	with	143,252,589	total	shares	traded	(Point	'B').	It	currently	trades	for
around	$0.60,	and	as	we	will	explain	in	a	later	section,	we	believe	WPWR	is	headed	much
lower.	We	can't	reiterate	enough	that	this	rise	in	stock	price	is	due	entirely	to	hype	and	the
dissemination	of	misleading	information	by	unscrupulous	promoters.


It	isn't	uncommon	for	StockTips.com	to	promote	penny	stocks	with	little	to	no	value,	but	as
you	can	see	from	the	charts	below,	the	gains	always	are	short-lived:

Tiger	Oil	and	Energy,	Inc.	(OTCPK:TGRO)	never	has	generated	any	revenue,	and	has
$675	total	assets.	However,	TGRO	was	promoted	by	StockTips.com,	beginning	on	Dec.	9,
2013	at	$0.35.	The	peak	of	$1.59	occurred	13	trading	days	later,	and	a	total	of	81,132,321
shares	traded	between	the	beginning	of	the	promotional	campaign	and	the	peak.

shares	traded	between	the	beginning	of	the	promotional	campaign	and	the	peak.

Amarium	Technologies,	Inc.	(OTCPK:AMMG)	has	generated	losses	totaling	$5,762,541
since	inception,	and	its	cash	position	and	line	of	credit	total	$105,382.	However,	AMMG
was	promoted	by	StockTips.com,	beginning	on	Aug.	19,	2013	at	$0.25.	The	peak	of	$0.59
occurred	17	days	later,	and	a	total	of	12,027,622	shares	traded	between	the	campaign's
beginning	and	its	peak.


Comparing	WPWR	to	Past	Promotions


Among	the	three	most-recent	stock	promotions	by	StockTips.com,	the	average	span
between	beginning	and	peak	is	13	days.	WPWR	also	peaked	on	the	13th	day	of	the
promotion,	and	has	bounced	several	days	since	then.


TICKER	SYMBOL #	DAYS	TILL	PEAK TOTAL	SHARES	TRADED


AMMG 17	days 12,027,622	shares


PGLO 11	days 46,794,936	shares


TGRO 13	days 81,132,321	shares

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2074893-well-power-a-promoted-shell-company-that-will-continue-to-crash 9/10


WPWR 13	days 143,252,589	shares	


(as	of	2/28/2014)


The	total	volume	generated	during	the	WPWR	campaign	until	the	peak	pales	in
comparison	to	those	of	past	promotions,	and	as	we	stated	in	a	previous	article,	we	believe
there	is	a	strong	indirect	correlation	between	the	number	of	shares	traded	and	the
performance	of	a	promoted	stock.	Therefore,	WPWR	should	continue	to	fall	much	greater
than	their	past	promotions,	AMMG,	PGLO	and	TGRO.


Conclusion


To	date,	the	MEC	technology	hasn't	been	commercialized.	Unless	that	technology
becomes	a	viable	solution	for	oil	and	gas	businesses,	WPWR	common	stock	will	be
completely	worthless.	If	the	technology	does	help	oil	and	gas	businesses	save	money	by
turning	wasted	natural	gas	into	clean	energy,	then	begin	researching	MEEXF	instead.


The	Fraud	Research	Institute's	track	record	exposing	overvalued	and	overhyped
promoted	penny	stocks	is	uncanny.	The	first	two	promoted	penny	stocks	about	which	we
have	published	investigative	reports	in	2014	dropped	45	percent	and	68	percent,
respectively,	within	two	days	of	publication	of	each	of	those	reports.	Last	year,	we	went
out	on	a	limb	and	predicted	that	a	promoted	graphite	stock	would	drop	by	85	percent.	It
took	less	than	one	month	for	that	to	happen.


Considering	Well	Power	Inc.	doesn't	own	any	of	the	technologies	it	continues	to	tout	in
emails	and	marketing	videos,	it	is	obvious	that	investors	should	stay	away.	This	is	a	shell
company,	as	defined	by	the	SEC,	and	it	is	undergoing	a	$4.1-million	stock-promotion
campaign.	We	expect	it	to	drop	by	a	minimum	of	80	percent	during	the	next	year.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	WPWR.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own
opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have
no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.


Additional	disclosure:	The	article	states	that	we	have	stated	that	we	have	attempted	to
contact	Well	Power,	Inc.	by	phone	for	several	weeks	regarding	our	concerns	about	the
company	and	the	ongoing	promotion,	and	have	never	received	a	response.	Emails	were
also	not	replied	to.
