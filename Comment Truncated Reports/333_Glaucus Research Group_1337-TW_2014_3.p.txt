On April 24, 2014, we published our investment opinion (the “Initial Report”) on ASIA PLASTIC 


RECYCLING HOLDING LIMITED (“APR” or the “Company”), a People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) 


based producer of EVA (foam rubber) products. APR issued a written response to our report on April 27, 


2014, (the “APR Response”) and to our rebuttal on April 29, 2014 (the “APR Second Response”).  





In this supplemental report we show how APR has serious internal inconsistencies in its own responses.  


We believe that this is further definitive evidence that APR has made material misrepresentations to 


Taiwanese regulators and investors about the scale and profitability of its business.  





I. DEED TAXES AND STAMP DUTIES DO NOT LIE 
 


APR claims to have spent RMB 126 million in 2011 to acquire 137 mu of additional land for the 


expansion of the Fujian facility (RMB 920,000 per Mu).  However, in our report, we presented publicly 


available government land records which showed that APR purchased this land at auction from the Land 


and Resources Bureau of Jinjiang for only RMB 31 million, which is 75% less than the RMB 126mm in 


acquisition cost reported to Taiwan investors and regulators. 





In the APR Response, the Company confirmed that the cost of the land for the Fujian Expansion Project 


was only RMB 31 million (RMB 226,277 per mu), but argued that the records from the Land and 


Resources Bureau of Jinjiang do not reflect other costs included in the acquisition.  In the APR Response, 


the Company listed every single cost per Mu that it argues should be included in the total transaction 


value: 





1. Purchase from farmers:       RMB 450,000 per Mu 


2. Compensatory pension insurance payments:     RMB 30,000 per Mu 


3. Compensation for land and crops:      RMB 4,000 per Mu 


4. The ‘Eight accesses’ and site leveling fees (aka infrastructure fees):  RMB 150,000 per Mu 


5. Land transfer fees for state-owned properties:     RMB 226,000 per Mu 


6. Deed taxes and stamp duties:      RMB 9,100 per Mu 


7. Other fees paid to village committee:      RMB 50,900 per Mu 





Total cost:         RMB 920,000 per Mu

Company Response: p. 1 





Unfortunately for APR, the deed taxes and stamp duties reported in the APR response (and highlighted 


above) vindicate Glaucus and clearly suggest, in our opinion, that APR misrepresented the true purchase 


price of the Fujian land acquisition.   





Tax policies published by the Fujian provincial government state that the deed tax is 3% of “transaction 


value”
1
, while the stamp duty is 0.05%.


2
  According to the official guidelines, because the land that APR 


purchased at auction was designated as “state-owned” land, the transaction value that is used to calculate 


the deed tax and stamp duties includes the land transfer fee, government infrastructure fees and ALL 


other types of compensation and fees:

Therefore, the deed tax and stamp duties should be 3.05% of the total purchase price of the Fujian land 


(including any infrastructure fees or any compensation paid to farmers).

If APR is telling the truth, and the Company purchased the Fujian land for RMB 920,000 per Mu, then 


APR would have paid RMB 28,060 per Mu in deed taxes and stamp duties (calculated as RMB 920,000 


x 3.05%). 





But according to the APR Response, the Company only paid deed taxes and stamp duties of RMB 9,100 


per Mu, which is 68% less than what it should have paid if the Company was telling the truth.  We 


are not surprised that the Company has been caught in the inconsistencies of its own response.    





II. SOURCE OF TAX LISTS IS THE GOVERNMENT 
 


In our Initial Report, we highlighted annual government tax lists which rank the top taxpaying businesses 


operating in Chendai county, Jinjiang city.  According to these tax rankings, APR only paid between 


RMB 28mm and RMB 80 mm in total taxes from 2010 through 2013, which is only 4% to 12% of the 


amount reported to Taiwanese investors and regulators during that period.  This suggests that APR 


has vastly exaggerated the scale and profitability of its business. 





In the APR Response, the Company claimed that the tax rankings were not sourced from the government.  


Rather, APR argued that the rankings were not reliable because they were assembled by the Communist 


Party based on estimates by party members working at ranked companies.  This is simply not true.   





As shown below, we have identified another set of government tax rankings which rank the top 


taxpaying businesses operating in the city Jinjiang.
3
  Importantly, these tax rankings are produced by 


the Jinjiang city government to recognize the top taxpaying businesses in its jurisdiction.  Note that in 


each list, the description is signed “Jinjiang Municipal People’s Government.” 





The 2011 through 2013 Jinjiang government tax rankings (below) indicate that Sansd Fujian (APR’s only 


meaningful tax paying entity) paid far less in taxes than APR reported to Taiwanese regulators and 


investors.   





Figures are in RMB million APR Reported Taxes Paid* Taxes Paid Per Jinjiang Government Tax Rankings


2011 161.5 Between RMB 10 mm and 50 mm


2012 201.7 Between RMB 10 mm and 30 mm

  The tax rankings highlighted in our Initial Report ranked the top taxpaying businesses in Chendai county, which is located in 


the city of Jinjiang and is the location of APR's headquarters, production facilities, and only meaningful PRC operating 


subsidiary.

APR can no longer distract investors by arguing that the tax rankings highlighted in our Initial Report 


were produced by local Communist Party members and are thus unreliable, because the tax rankings 


above were clearly produced by the Jinjiang city government.    





The Jinjiang government’s tax rankings indicate that APR is paying far less in taxes than the Company 


reported to Taiwanese investors and regulators, which suggests that the Company’s revenues and profits 


are significantly smaller than the figures reported in APR’s financial statements.   





III.   PAYMENTS TO FARMERS INCLUDED 
 


In our Initial Report, we presented publicly available land records, which showed that APR purchased 


land for the Fujian facility and the Jiangsu facility from the government at significantly less than the 


acquisition cost reported to Taiwan investors and regulators. 





In the APR Response, the Company argued that the government records did not reflect the full purchase 


price of the land because they failed to include payments made by the Company to farmers to relocate 


them from the land. 





But according to Article 47, Section 2 of China’s Land Management law, the land acquisition cost (cited 


by Glaucus in its Initial Report) includes compensation for land, relocation payments to farmers, 


compensation for structures and crops.  According to the law, we believe that it is the government, not the 


private buyer, who bears the costs of giving subsidies to farmers for their land.  





 
Source: http://wenku.baidu.com/view/2da2946b561252d380eb6e49.html 





This means that the land acquisition costs cited by Glaucus in its Initial Report should represent the total 


acquisition cost of the land and that APR should not have had to give separate payments to farmers.  This 


is further evidence that APR bought the Fujian land and the Jiangsu land at a cost that was substantially 


less than the amount reported to Taiwan investors and regulators.   





Glaucus has confronted APR with clear and compelling evidence that it has made material 


misrepresentations to the market.  In each response, the Company reaches for new excuses in a desperate 


attempt to salvage the credibility of its previous disclosures.  This is further proof of Mark Twain’s 


famous quote: 
 


“If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.”
