Spruce Point Has Succeeded In 
Canadian Shareholder Activism


Spruce Point has written four critical activist reports in Canada. In a majority of the cases, the share price has met or 


exceeded our downside estimate of intrinsic value. The average share price decline is 57%. A common theme is that 


Canadian analysts don’t ask difficult questions of management, challenge assumptions, and are overly optimistic.

an impairment of assets and that “it is 
possible that an impairment or write-
down will be recognized in Q3’18”


• The Company also clarified its capital 
allocation strategy, and suggested 
that debt pay was a priority, leaving 
the safety of the dividend in question

Executive Summary
6


Spruce Point Believes Dollarama (TSX: DOL) Is A 
“Strong Sell” With ~40% Downside Risk


A Retailer Of Low-End Products With Declining Fundamentals In An Increasingly Competitive Environment


• Undifferentiated Products: Dollarama sells a variety of low-priced products, mostly sourced directly from China. Its purported advantage in “sourcing” is 
contradicted by conversations with industry sources as well as numerous IP infringement lawsuits filed against the Company.


• Moving Upmarket Is A Risky Strategy: Faced with years of negative average traffic growth and an increasingly saturated market, Dollarama is driving 
comparable store sales growth by selling higher-priced items. However, in doing so, it is quickly losing its reputation as a true “dollar store,” and per-store 
traffic numbers are declining as a result. Big Lots (NYSE: BIG) undertook a similar strategy in the 2000s, but reversed course after admitting its failure.


• Saturation Is Imminent: Dollarama cited a 900 store target at the time of its IPO in 2009, when it had just 585 stores. Management has since revised this 
number upwards multiple times: first to 1,200, then to 1,400, and most recently to 1,700. Our analysis shows that this target is unrealistic, and that the 
market is already bordering on oversaturation. Dollarama’s FY ‘19 store opening pace has thus far been its slowest in years.


• Margins Inexplicably High And Likely Unsustainable: Gross margins of 39-40% are remarkably high for a discount retailer, but intensifying competition, 
rising labor costs, rising transportation costs, and a lapsing currency hedge benefit all threaten Dollarama’s high profitability levels. Patterns in 
Dollarama’s hedging profits and gross margins ex-hedging suggest that management may be leaning on its FX-related profits to prevent its headline gross 
margin number from declining (see note on next page).


Troublesome Management And Governance Red Flags


• Founding Family (And A Director) Have Significant Related-Party Deals: The Rossy family launched Dollarama from its legacy retail chain in 1992 and owns 
significant real estate assets that are employed by the enterprise. This may have played a role in management’s recent decision to acquire Dollarama’s 
existing Montreal distribution center from the Rossys rather than open a second distribution facility in western Canada, as have most peers.


• CEO Stepped Down And Installed His Son: Larry Rossy stepped down as CEO in 2016 (and as Chairman in 2018), selecting as his replacement his son Neil –
previously Dollarama’s Chief Merchandising Officer. We question whether a thorough and arms-length search was conducted to fill this position.


• Opaque Supplier Relationship: As part of a deal struck in 2013, Dollarama supplies goods (at an undisclosed profit margin) to Central American discount 
retailer Dollar City in exchange for an option to acquire the chain in 2020. However, Dollarama currently has no formal stake in Dollar City, and therefore 
does not consolidate Dollar City’s results. We are concerned that Dollar City could be overpaying its vendors to lessen the financial burden on Dollarama.


• Insider Ownership Declining: Former CEO Larry Rossy has sold or transferred ~75% of his shares since the 2009 IPO. Bain Capital liquidated the last of its 
shares in 2011 at a split-adjusted price of $5 per share, 1/8th the current price. The current CFO owns no shares and regularly liquidates options.


Dollarama (DOL or “the Company”) is a dollar store which, following a series of price hikes over the course of several years,is no longer a true 


“dollar store.” As a result, DOL has fallen out of favor with value-oriented customers, causing average store traffic to contract and thus 


necessitating further price hikes to support SSS growth. Management is nonetheless aggressively pursuing unrealistic growth targets even as 


competitors flood the discount retail market and threaten its improbable margins. DOL’s shares trade at a 50% premium to peers in the value 


retail space – even following a ~20% drop after a disappointing Q2 – questionable governance and poor earnings quality notwithstanding.


We believe that DOL will continue to miss lofty investor expectations, and that its premium valuation will continue to be pressured.

Spruce Point Believes Dollarama (TSX: DOL) Is A 
“Strong Sell” With ~40% Downside Risk


Questionable Accounting Techniques And Capital Allocation Decisions Weaken Quality Of Earnings And Financial Position


• Currency Hedge Supposedly A Pure Offset To CAD Depreciation, But Has Been A Material Profit Center: Dollarama claims to hedge currencies only to 
lock in consistent prices (in CAD) on which its customers can rely. However, in practice, the Company adjusts prices to match non-hedged competitors, 
leaving us to wonder why it hedges at all. Much of the recent hedge benefit appears to have reversed, but gross margins ex-hedges conveniently rose by 
just enough over the last two years to maintain steady profitability. If nothing else, we question whether Dollarama’s elevated margins are sustainable.


• Tenant Allowances And Leasehold Improvements Are Amortized Over Very Different Periods: While accounting rules may give sufficient leeway to 
permit this difference, we question why lease term assumptions should differ for these two capital accounts. Earnings quality suffers notwithstanding.


• Sales Of Certain Assets, Such As Vehicles, Appear To Be Completed At Above-Market Prices: While the financial impact of these moves is difficult to 
quantify (perhaps due in part to Dollarama’s opaque relationship with Dollar City), the liquidation of certain assets is significant in some quarters.


• Leverage Is Increasing: Dollarama makes long-term financing decisions using short-term debt, the cost of which has risen with recent debt issuances and
is likely to continue to increase with rising interest rates – and as the Company’s credit profile grows riskier. We question management’s decision to 
increase leverage to support buybacks and dividends simply because the earnings yield is above the after-tax cost of debt. We also worry about the 
state of the balance sheet should the economic environment turn, or should the business decline more rapidly.


• Depreciation Is Well Below Capex And Has Been For Years: Capital spending easily bests industry peers, both as a percentage of sales and vis-à-vis 
steadier D&A charges. The mismatch with D&A suggests poor quality of earnings at the very least. Meanwhile, management’s growth orientation has 
diverted capital spending away from store remodeling, giving stores a stale and dated feel despite rising price points.


• Acquiring Real Estate Flatters EBITDA: Acquiring related-party real estate not only lines the pockets of the founding family, but also allows Dollarama to 
shift rent expenses out of the operating line. The artificial EBITDA boost helps management to achieve its EBITDA-based compensation targets.


Easy To Justify ~40% Downside In DOL Shares


• Valuation Is Indefensible: DOL currently trades at a ~50% premium to peers and carries among the highest multiples of any global retailer. Higher only 
are the valuations of crème de la crème global fashion brands – Hermes, Prada, Ferragamo, etc. Such lofty multiples are inappropriate for a dollar store 
with serious near-to-medium-term business risks. Analyst estimates are not sufficiently skeptical of management’s targets in light of these concerns.


• Even If Nothing Goes Wrong, The Stock Is Overvalued: Even if Dollarama executes its growth plan perfectly, maintains its world-leading margin, and 
retains a hefty valuation premium to its peers, the stock is at best fairly valued at ~$43.


• Under More Reasonable Assumptions, DOL Stock Is Overvalued By 40% At Current Levels: Even assuming that Dollarama achieves full market 
penetration – with no negative impact on per-store revenues from competition or cannibalization – the stock is worth $28 under normalized margins 
and at a multiple closer to peer norms, down ~40% from current levels.


• Analysts Bullish, But Wavering: Dollarama’s disappointing Q2 – including SSS guidance contraction and a YoY decline in operating cash flow – provoked 
some downgrades, but analysts still see ~26% upside in DOL shares regardless. We believe that analysts are too trusting of DOL’s growth targets, but 
that the Q2 miss put the Company on notice with a number of analysts. Further disappointing quarters could bring more drastic analyst revisions.

Capital Structure And Valuation


In C$, MM, except per share figures or where indicated 


At present, Dollarama demonstrates impressive margins and is not egregiously over-levered on a Net Debt-to-EBITDA 


basis. However, as competition increases, customers push back against recent price hikes, and operating costs creep 


upwards, we believe that management will have a difficult time maintaining current profitability levels – particularly 


while pursuing an aggressive growth strategy. Leverage will be less sustainable should the business’ performance 


decline or the economic environment turn, threatening management’s ability to support continued buybacks / 


dividends while growing store count.

Dollarama refinanced significant short-term debt just last evening, levering up the business in the process. 


Management refinanced its C$400M of 3.095% fixed-rate notes due this November with C$500M of 3.55% fixed-rate 


notes due November 2023. Management’s use of short-term debt has burdened the business with refinancing risk in 


an environment in which the CDOR rate has risen sharply and is expected to rise for the foreseeable future, which has 


now forced the Company to bear materially higher interest expenses (compare to its 2.203% fixed-rate credit due in 


2022). The Company still has C$1.4B of debt due to mature within the next 12 quarters (including its credit facility), 


leaving it exposed to further rate increases. The Company’s weighted average debt maturity is about 3.5 years.

Undifferentiated Goods & Knock-Off Products


Dollarama sells undifferentiated, low-priced consumer goods, competing almost entirely on price. Many of its products are 


knock-offs. It is no surprise that the Company has been sued by several companies for trademark infringement.

Selling cheap imitations of more expensive brands has turned Dollarama into one of Canada’s most 


successful retailers, earning it big bucks and plenty of lawsuits  (Source)


“I think they have good lawyers working 


for them,” says David Lipkus, a lawyer 


specializing in anti-counterfeit in Toronto, 


who has helped clients sue businesses in 


Canada selling knock-offs. “Often 


retailers make mistakes and end up 


selling fakes.” Many lawsuits are settled 


privately, but the store has been sued 


by Nike, for selling counterfeit 


footwear emblazoned with Nike’s 


iconic basketball player silhouette, and 


by Umbra, a home decoration company, 


for selling a style of waste basket. In 


February 2017, Dixon Ticonderoga 


launched a suit against the dollar 


store chain for a pencil it’s been 


selling since 2002.


Dollarama sells a wide range of discounted knock-offs across product categories.


Its business invites litigation.

Per-Store Traffic Growth Stagnant, But Opportunities 
For Price Increases May Be Exhausted


Growth in per-store sales has been driven by transaction size growth against declining per-store traffic. Transaction 


size growth has itself been driven by sales of higher-priced items: Dollarama’s maximum price point has risen from 


$1 prior to FY 2008, to $2 in FY 2008-09, to $3 in FY 2012, to $4 in FY 2017.


Contracting store traffic puts per-store sales growth at risk absent further price increases, but we question whether 


price-driven SSS growth is sustainable as higher prices erode Dollarama’s value proposition and put it in closer 


competition with more comprehensive big-box retailers. Management has expressed reluctance to raise prices further 


in the near term regardless (though they said the same when the max price was bumped to $3 several years ago). With 


recent price increases now lapping for the first time, SSS growth may be at risk.


Growth has been propped up by price increases which have made its products more expensive than those at dollar store peers.


Between a rock and a hard place: Does management continue to erode Dollarama’s value proposition with price increases, or 


keep prices steady and hope for traffic contraction to reverse?

Increasing Average Unit Revenues Is 
A Very Risky Strategy That Has Failed Before


Raising price points to prop up SSS growth against falling store traffic is a major risk for discount retailers, as their 


entire value proposition comes from their low prices. Higher prices may turn off customers and create difficult 


comps in the event that price increases must be paused or reversed due to customer pushback.


In 2006, for example, Big Lots – a U.S. discount retailer – introduced higher-ticket brand-name items in place of 


comparable budget goods in an effort to get customers to spend more per visit. This strategy reinvigorated same-


store sales growth for a time, but ultimately failed. Subsequent difficult comps resulted in negative SSS growth after 


management abandoned its so-called “Raise the Ring” strategy.

abandoned; lower price 


points are emphasized

items are emphasized


Big Lots alienated shoppers who were 


seeking cut-price, name-brand goods after 


venturing into other areas, 


like selling frozen food:


“Our customer doesn’t come to us expecting a 


Nordstrom’s level of in-store shopping 


experience. They want value, treasures, 


merchandise on the floor and clean restrooms, 


and we need to meet those expectations,” 


[CEO Steve] Fishman said in 2005.


…


“We’re an enigma,” he said at an investor 


conference this month. “It’s been a real 


challenge for the marketplace.”  Source


Calls with industry experts indicate that Dollarama is losing more price-conscious customers to Dollar Tree and other discount retailers 


following its efforts to raise prices, and that this is a major driver behind recent per-store traffic declines.


If price-conscious customers aren’t interested in shopping at Dollarama, we wonder who is…

“NothingForADollarama”: Customers Becoming 
Conscious Of Price Increases Versus Competitors


Dollarama’s price increases may not yet put its prices on par with those of big box retailers like Walmart, but 


customers have taken notice that Dollarama has increased prices against other Canadian dollar stores. Comments 


from various internet forums and news sites reveal that customers no longer believe that Dollarama offers as much 


value as do other discount retailers, suggesting that the strength of Dollarama’s value proposition – the source of 


its appeal and foundation of its business model – is at risk. The below comments are anecdotal, but comments of 


this sort regarding Dollarama in particular are nonetheless common among relevant websites.


“The dollar store is no longer a bargain if you 


shop around you can by the same things 


cheaper or same price elsewhere quit 


calling it dollarama no more dollar things.”

“I enjoyed the days when everything in Rama 


actually was a dollar. I go to Dollar Tree 


more often now just because everything 


there is $1.25 - ($1 in the U.S. of course).”

“Their high prices is the problem, they still 


have better selection than Dollar Tree but 


their prices are always higher. I know some 


dollar store shoppers who go to Dollar 


Tree first for the better prices and then go 


to Dollarama for the stuff they couldn't 


find at Dollar Tree. Myself personally have 


watched the prices creep up. A pair of work 


gloves climbed from $2.50 to 4 or 5 bucks,


the discount over Home Depot is only a 


buck or two now. Also Dollar Tree still 


keeps all items under 2 bucks I believe.”

Just did a quick check of my cleaning cupboard:


DT=Dollar Tree, DM=Dollarama


- 2.84L bleach, $1.25 at DT. Sometimes they even 


have the big 3.7L bottles. Never seen bleach that 


cheap at DM


- 976ml Fabric Refresher $1.25 at DT. DM sells it for 


$1.50 and it's a smaller bottle.


- Oxy First Force spray cleaner. $1.25 at DT. $1.50 at 


DM. 


DT also has a selection of other spray cleaners at 


$1.25 while even other no name ones at DM can go 


up to $2.


- No name dish soap. 1479ml (almost 1.5L) for $1.25 


at DT. 500ml for a $1 (or I guess $1.25 soon) at DM.


- No name Mr. Clean sponges. At DT it's two full 


sponges for $1.25. At DM each sponge is half Mr. 


Clean cleaner sponge and half normal cheap sponge.


- Those square no name tupperware containers that 


are 3 for $1.25 at DM are 4 for $1.25 at DT.


At the dollar-ish level everything I've found at DT 


has been a better value and equal, or better, 


quality.

Transitioning Away From “Dollar Store” 
Identity Threatens Customer Loyalty


Perhaps in recognition of the fact that Dollarama is losing its status as a true dollar store, and that it now belongs to a 


different category, management has stricken almost all references to “dollar stores” from Company filings. This poses 


a major threat to Dollarama’s customer appeal, as evidenced by traffic trends and anecdotal customer reactions.

Margins Are Inexplicably High And 
Perhaps Unsustainable


We acknowledge that Dollarama is a strong operator with a strong value proposition (though perhaps a declining one). However,


we question whether a discount retailer reselling Chinese knock-offs should garner among the highest operating margins of all 


global retailers, and whether a discount retailer with declining per-store traffic can continue to rely on price hikes for SSS growth.


Dollarama stands out among global consumer companies and retailers –


45th out of 584 global retailers by operating margin (and 12th out of 584 


global retailers by revenue multiple)


Dollarama consistently produces operating margins materially higher than 


industry peers, and higher than historical industry norms. This gap has 


only grown more substantial through the last five years.

Debit Card Boost Is Played Out


Dollarama management has characterized the benefit from debit cards as being roughly a doubling in average purchase size. 


If true, this benefit would be visible in year-over-year sales comps.


The Company has not always disclosed penetration – and they ceased doing so after Q4 2016 – but the data suggest that the 


average annual comp benefit was approximately 2.5% from FY 2013-16.

Have All The Levers Been Pulled?


Dollarama has done a good job of increasing per-store revenue while investing in initiatives designed to remove operating 


expenses. We cannot fault management for pulling levers to expand margins, but we believe the low-hanging 


(and high-hanging) fruit has already been harvested.


Management has also taken creative measures to raise effective average prices without raising prices directly – e.g. by 


strategically replacing some lower-priced goods with close substitutes at higher price points, and by reducing the size of 


product bundles (pencils, candies, etc.) without cutting prices. Such back-door avenues to margin expansion may be exhausted 


by this point: as noted previously, customers are beginning to notice that Dollarama no longer offers a value proposition 


comparable to competing dollar stores.

FY 2016 Q4 Earnings Call Q&A



https://seekingalpha.com/article/3962064-dollaramas-dlmaf-ceo-larry-rossy-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single
20


Costs Rising On Multiple Fronts


While management may have largely exhausted avenues for price increases and efficiency gains, other industry and Company 


developments threaten to drive up costs through the near term.


Cost Driver Explanation


Tariffs
A significant share of goods (~20% according to industry experts) are sourced either directly or indirectly from the U.S. 
Tariffs could increase costs on these goods materially.


Minimum 
Wage Hikes


Provincial minimum wages in Canada generally rise much more frequently than do U.S. minimum wages, and many are scheduled to rise on an annual 
basis based on CPI growth. Minimum wage hikes have been particularly significant of late (see below). Even provinces whose minimum wages are not 
tied to CPI growth have seen, or are set to see, material minimum wage hikes in the near future. Notable recent and near-term changes are as follows:


• Alberta: From $13.60 to $15.00 on October 1, 2018 (10.3% increase)
• British Columbia: From $12.65 to $13.85 on June 1, 2019, to $14.60 on June 1, 2020, and to $15.20 on June 1, 2021 (6.3% CAGR)
• Ontario: From $11.60 to $14.00 on January 1, 2018 (20.7% increase), and to $15.00 on January 1, 2019 (additional 7.1% year-over-year increase). 


Will rise according to Ontario CPI growth every October 1 each subsequent year. New Ontario Premier Doug Ford is looking to reverse these plans.
• Quebec: Just increased to $12.00 (+6.6% in May 2018). Significant political push to set provincial minimum wage at 50% of average provincial 


minimum wage by 2020
• Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Yukon: Annual minimum wage hikes according to national or 


local CPI growth


Employee remuneration for FY 2018 was just over 10% of Dollarama revenue. This cost item could realistically grow at a high single-digit rate over the 
next 2-3 years, even if headcount is reduced.


Transportation 
and Logistics


Industry experts have expressed concerns regarding near-term transportation cost increases. These would hit Dollarama particularly hard, as Dollarama 
is unique among industry peers. It has only one distribution center. Rather than invest in a second, Dollarama recently purchased its existing 
distribution center in Montreal – which it previously leased from the Rossy family – for $39.4M (in addition to $23.2M spent on adjacent land). Other 
large Canadian value retailers generally have two distribution centers – one in the eastern half of the country and one in the western half.


Rising fuel costs could result in materially higher transportation expenses, as Dollarama distributes 92% of its merchandise through its single 
distribution center. Industry experts suggest that shipping goods to Vancouver from Montreal via truck can be almost twice as expensive as shipping 
to Vancouver from China.


We find it interesting that Dollarama chose to purchase property from management’s family rather than follow industry norms and open a second 
distribution center in western Canada, and that five of its six warehouses – all located in greater Montreal – are also leased from the Rossy family (the 
sixth warehouse is company-owned, built on land purchased from the Rossy family).


Marketing
Dollarama has historically operated with no marketing expense. However, U.S. peers spend 1-2% of revenue on average on marketing (see subsequent 
slides). As competition increases across the Canadian discount retail industry, management may be forced to expand marketing efforts.
21


Minimum Wage Growth Historically High 
And Accelerating Rapidly


Canada has seen fairly consistent minimum wage hikes since 2000, and minimum wage growth has outpaced inflation in all but 


three years since the beginning of the millennium. Dollarama has been able to manage minimum wage hikes and maintain 


impressive margins since going public in 2009. Note, however, that minimum wage growth from 2009-17 was comparatively mild 


relative to the prior half-decade. Accelerating minimum wage growth through the near term will test management’s ability to 


insulate margins from rising labor costs.

Management states that the vast majority of employees make more than minimum wage. Nonetheless, minimum wage hikes of 10-20% in 


Canada’s most populous provinces could put material upward pressure on labor costs – particularly if these hikes spread to Quebec, where 


Dollarama’s distribution center and all of its warehouses are located. Management includes a risk factor to this effect in its MD&A.

12% weighted average minimum wage growth across Canada, driven by 


20.7% hikes in Ontario. Average minimum wages could very realistically 


continue to grow at high single-digit rates through the next ~2 years if 


planned hikes are enacted.


With labor costs representing about 10% of Dollarama revenue, 


profitability is materially sensitive to changes in this item. 


If labor costs were 10% higher in FY 2018, EBITDA margins would have 


been slashed by 80 bps.


Labor cost expansion of this magnitude would be significant, but is not 


necessarily out of the question within 2-3 years.

2013 Annual Report


In 2013, Dollarama entered into an agreement to export and sell products to Dollar City, a Latin American dollar store with a


presence in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Colombia. In exchange for selling goods to Dollar City “at cost” plus a small markup,


and providing business and operational expertise, Dollarama was given an option to acquire the chain, exercisable in February


2019 (since extended to February 2020).


Details about Dollar City are scarce: Who is the management? Where is company headquarters? Who are the shareholders? 


Dollar City’s website provides limited information, and not a single Dollar City manager was quoted at the initiation of the 


relationship.1 Though management claims to sell to Dollar City “at cost” with a markup, we have no way of determining how they 


are calculating “cost.” It is more likely that Dollarama loads shared costs into the Dollar City bill that flatter Dollarama’s margins, 


and sells merchandise that isn’t selling well in Dollarama stores to Dollar City.

Evidence Of Dollarama Store Growth Slowing


The pace with which Dollarama opened stores through the past several years does not appear to be sustainable. 


Importantly, the inevitable reversal in its pacing appears to be occurring this year. 


The Company opened just eight stores in Q2’19, its lowest store opening count in any quarter of any recent year. 


Its YTD FY 2019 pace of 18 new stores is also trailing the average pace of recent fiscal years (28 openings) by 


~35%. Management did not provide a fully satisfactory explanation for this deficit.


The slowdown in its pace of store openings could suggest that the Company is having a difficult time identifying 


economically-viable locations as it seeks to grow its store count by close to 50% – still a very distant target.

“I want to ask about the pace of store 


openings. As you noted the slower start to 


the year, you did maintain the guidance for 


this year. But wondering about sort of further 


beyond that, obviously, the store potential that 


you put out there gives you room to remain at 


that pace for a while. But does the slower 


same store sales assumption change your 


thinking about how aggressively you want 


to push new stores out there?”


- Mark Petrie, CIBC


“No, it does not. It does not. And that I would 


also add that if the pace at which we've been 


opening stores this year is slower than last year, 


as mentioned often, that just relates to the 


specific timing of real estate. And if stores are 


pushed closer to the end of the year, it could be 


that there is an overlap between a few more 


stores at the end of this year or a few more 


stores in the beginning of next year, and the 


end, it will keep our pace of 60 to 70.”


- Michael Ross, CFO, Dollarama


“Real estate timing issues” 


do a poor job of explaining a 


drop in H1 new store 


openings of over a third.

Dollarama Potentially Pushing The Limits 
Of The Canadian Market


Management’s stated goal is to have 1,700 stores across Canada by 2027, up from 1,178 stores today. We do not 


believe that it can achieve this without risking significant cannibalization. DOL’s target would imply a saturation level 


higher than the largest U.S. dollar stores (Dollar Tree and Dollar General), which also sell many more consumables and 


grocery items.  Additionally, Canada broadly has much lower levels of retail space per capita than the U.S., suggesting 


that Canadian concentration is even more pronounced all else equal.

Walmart is not opening stores in Canada, suggesting that it believes 


the Canadian market is saturated at 11.4 stores per million people –


about 69% of its U.S. concentration (16.4 stores per million people).


Meanwhile, Dollarama continues to expand within Canada despite 


even higher Canadian concentration (32.7 per mil) relative to the U.S. 


concentration of large U.S. dollar stores (45.2 per mil, for a 72% 


ratio). This ratio would be over 100% at DOL’s 1,700 store target.

Dollarama Has Benefited From A Benign 
Competitive Environment


Large competitors have been shuttering Canadian stores continuously through the last four years due to company-


specific issues, highlighted by the high-profile exits of Target and Big Lots from Canada.1,2 We believe that this has been 


a significant tailwind for Dollarama, but one that is largely behind the Company at this juncture.


Dollarama has been able to maintain significant share, high margins, and high returns on capital in large part due to 


missteps among peers and the resulting lax competition. This is likely unsustainable in a more competitive environment, 


as Dollarama has few material competitive advantages: barriers to entry are low, and its discount retailing strategy is not 


unique. Competent competition from growing industry players – Dollar Tree Canada, Miniso, and Amazon, among others 


– could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for Dollarama’s profitability or growth (or both).

Light Competition Has Allowed The Company 
To Spend Nothing On Promotion – Until Now?


Dollarama has no promotional expense. Meanwhile, promotional expenses average 1-2% of revenue among U.S. 


peers. As established competitors continue to expand, and as new competitors enter the market (Amazon included), 


Dollarama’s no-cost marketing strategy may prove untenable.

The Canadian operation is also a relatively small part of the business. However, early results are 


encouraging, and despite competition in the Canadian market, Dollar Tree has found success. Longer 


term the company is aiming for 1,000 stores north of the border, which does not seem unrealistic.

Calls with people at Dollar Tree suggest that the Company is working to 


imitate elements of Dollarama’s strategy and store layout in its own 


Canadian stores (e.g. raised shelves, etc.), and that it plans to expand 


into Canada aggressively once its strategy is refined – likely in 2019

Caught Between The Competition: 
How Will Dollarama Fit In?


Dollar Tree has maintained its reputation as a true dollar store: nothing is priced higher than C$1.25 ($1 in the US)


Miniso has developed a reputation as a “nicer” discount retailer: items can cost up to C$25, but the environment is cleaner and 


more modern, and products are of better quality (but you can still get a dollar-level deal – most products are priced under C$10)


Dollarama has all the character of an old, tired dollar store, but without the dollar prices.


Who will shop there unless management invests in store updates rather than opening new stores?


Value-driven customers are by definition not loyal customers!

Dollarama Makes No Effort To Appeal Millennials –
The Next (And Current) Shopping Generation


Dollarama has zero social media presence, unlike all of its peers. Not only is the Company out of touch with customers in 


an industry which demands a high level of customer engagement, but its brand is becoming demonstrably stale.

Until now, Dollarama has largely been a regional brand with satisfactory name recognition in its provincial home of Quebec. 


Now that the Company is making a bigger push into Anglophone Canada, management should be more proactive in adapting its 


strategy to new markets and to a new customer base. Yet management continues to employ a strategy more befitting a sleepy 


regional business: it does not market or work to improve its brand, it does not stay current with trends, it keeps management


within the family, and it is not expanding its logistics chain to support coast-to-coast growth (see subsequent slides).


Management wants Dollarama to be a national brand, but it does not appear prepared to run a national business.

Questionable Accounting And 
Financial Practices
31


Hedging Instruments A Material Source Of 
Profits In Recent Years


Dollarama’s sales are in Canadian dollars, whereas a majority of its product purchases are U.S. dollar-linked. Management claims to enter 


into CAD/USD hedging arrangements to lock in near-term margins without having to adjust prices in response to FX movements. However, 


management has nonetheless admittedly adjusted prices alongside unhedged peers in response to shifts in the CAD/USD exchange rate, 


rendering its currency hedges a source of profit. 


Forex dynamics through the last two years have erased the large hedge benefit realized by Dollarama in FY 2016, but management reports 


that gross margins have effectively remained flat through this period, implying significant gross margin improvement in the underlying 


business (see graphs below). As the currency hedge benefit has reversed through the last two years, underlying gross margins have 


purportedly risen by *EXACTLY ENOUGH* to keep total gross margins steady between 39-40%. We find this oddly convenient – or, at the very 


least, we question whether management will be able to maintain steady margins in the face of unfavorable FX rate dynamics in the future.


Quick turnaround in 


underlying 


profitability! Just in 


time to keep the 


declining forex hedge 


benefit from dragging 


down margins…


Even as FX hedge gains fell 


from close to 8% of gross profit 


in FY 2016 to a drag on gross 


profit in FY 2018, gross margin 


expanded by over 100 bps over 


the same period, implying gross 


margin expansion ex-forex of 


almost 300 bps within two years 


for a retailer with gross margins 


which were already unusually 


high, and whose margins had 


contracted for four straight 


years before the rapid reversal.
32


Questionable Depreciation Assumptions


Dollarama changed its depreciation schedule for leasehold improvements (store fixtures) in FY 2015, moving from a 10-year to a 15-


year expected life.1 However, management did not concurrently lengthen the amortization schedule for tenant inducements.


We find this mismatch curious, as both quantities should be amortized / depreciated over the expected life of a given lease. 


Adding to the confusion and appearance of foul play, DOL discloses in its AIF that its average lease term is just 5 yrs, and it just 


started disclosing related-party dealing with Director Huw Thomas of SmartCentres – a REIT that lists DOL as a top 10 customer.2,3

While the financial impact of this adjustment is limited, signs of accounting impropriety do not reflect well on management and cast 


doubt on the rest of Dollarama’s reports and accounting practices


1) FY 2015 Annual Report, p. 15. DOL also extended its store and warehouse equipment useful lives from 8-10yrs to 10-15yrs. The total reduction of these three items was decrease of $10m in 


FY15 depreciation expense


2) DOL states in its AIF p. 11: “The Corporation typically enters into leases with base terms of ten years and options to renew for one or more periods of five years each. The average time to 


expiration of the Corporation’s leases is approximately five years.”

Capital Spending And Distribution Of Cash To 
Shareholders Are Overextending The Business


What happened?


Management claimed in 2011 that the business was sufficiently cash-generative to support growth and dividends/share buybacks, 


and that it would be able to pay down debt while pursuing both. However, debt has ballooned since then, with net debt rising 8x 


(and close to 3x versus EBITDA growth). Management is effectively levering up the balance sheet to support dividends and share 


buybacks, with CFO Michael Ross stating that he will continue to repurchase shares as long as the earnings yield remains above 


the after-tax cost of debt.


“For the past few years our cash flow has enabled 


us to continue to pursue our growth plans and 


continue to pay down debt. Our free cash flow is 


now sufficient to fund both those priorities 


while enhancing new to shareholders through 


a quarterly dividend payment. We are able to 


generate the free cash flow to do all of this 


because we employ a simple growth oriented 


business model at Dollarama”


– June 2011 Conference Call


Should Dollarama’s struggles become 
more pronounced – or should the 


economic cycle turn for the worse – this 
debt overhang could loom large over 


the business


Dollarama also consistently spends more on capex (as a percentage of sales) than its peers in the discount retail industry, and 


shows abnormally high capex versus depreciation and amortization. We understand that Dollarama is a growing business, which 


could explain both patterns in part, but it is not the only discount retailer which is investing in store growth.

Where Is The Capex Going?


Management has explicitly identified and discussed various capital expenditures in Company filings over the last 


five years, but this still leaves a large gap versus what was actually spent.


Additionally, there is a large gap between the amount spent on software development and the amortization expense 


associated with this activity, suggesting that earnings may be inflated.


Some of this is 


directed towards 


leasehold 


improvements, etc., 


but with 


management’s 


focus on expansion 


over existing store 


improvements, we 


question where 


management is 


directing this capex

Are earnings 


inflated due to 


insufficient 


amortization?


Note also that a LinkedIn search for software developers at Dollarama turned up effectively nothing – at best one person with a tangentially 


relevant title (source). So where is the software development capex going?


Unlike discount retailer peers, Dollarama 


did not include software-related 


spending in capex until recently, and 


records it separately, in 


“Additions to intangible assets.”1


Do they do this to artificially deflate their 


headline capex figure, thereby inflating 


reported free cash flow?

Lack Of Transparency Regarding Store 
Closures And Associated Costs


It is standard industry practice to report store closures, remodels and relocations alongside new store openings. 


However, Dollarama reports only “Net New Stores” and does not break this number out in detail. Questioned on this 


in Q4 2016, management answered that a larger store base would inevitably result in more closures for reasons 


outside of its control (fires, mall renovations, etc.), and that reporting closures would therefore not communicate 


meaningful information regarding the underlying performance of the business.


We strongly disagree: store closure information is vital to evaluating the health of a retail chain. Management can 


provide color on particular closures if it feels that they have been done for reasons other than performance, but 


failing to report closures entirely hides a key operating statistic from investors.

Other high-growth dollar 


stores like Dollar Tree and 


Dollar General report store 


closures – why doesn’t 


Dollarama?


Store closures, for whatever 


the reasons, incur real 


restructuring and other 


costs. Peer retailers 


generally give detail on these 


expenses, whereas 


Dollarama does not.


We believe that Dollarama 


should follow industry norms 


and increase transparency 


regarding store closures.


U.S. Dollar Store peers historically close 0.8% of stores annually, yet Dollarama has not reported any recent closures
36


SSS Metrics Obfuscate Store Performance


Dollarama’s official “Comparable Store Sales” figure includes “relocated and expanded” stores as “comparable stores,” 


therefore picking up growth in traffic which can be attributed to relocation-related improvements. We believe that this likely 


overstates Comparable Store Sales growth, while also ignoring associated relocation-related expenses.


1) See Q1 FY 2014 earnings call transcript


Management not only hides store closure data as a supposedly uninformative statistic, but proclaims that it has NEVER closed a 


store due to poor performance.1 We find it difficult to believe that a retailer which has existed in its current format since 1992 has 


never needed to close a store for poor performance. If it has indeed never closed an underperforming store, we wonder whether


management has been too ambitious in growing its store base without critically evaluating the profitability of each location.

Cash Flow Beginning To Turn Over Despite 
Efforts To Bolster Results


In H1 FY 2019, Dollarama’s cash flow contracted on a year-over-year basis for the first time since it went public – this 


despite management’s efforts to bolster earnings and EBITDA. The contraction appears to be due in large part to 


changes in working capital. In particular, we are concerned that growth in inventories suggests that management 


overestimated near-to-medium term sales growth, and that declining traffic is starting to weigh on the Company.

As noted, Dollarama leases all but one of its five warehouses from the Rossy family, and recently purchased land from the Rossys


for the construction of a sixth. Management also recently purchased its Montreal distribution center from the Rossy family, which 


leased the facility to Dollarama until this February. We understand that the Rossy family has close historical ties to the business, 


but this level of close dealing draws our attention, particularly given the fact that management has focused on fortifying its 


existing distribution footprint – closely tied to the Rossy family – rather than invest in distribution facilities in western Canada, 


where major competitors already have distribution centers.

Related-Party Transactions With “Independent” 
Director Huw Thomas Only Recently Disclosed…..


Dollarama also leases stores from SmartCentres REIT, whose recently-departed CEO, Huw Thomas, joined Dollarama’s 


Board of Directors in 2011, and was a member of its audit committee through March 2017. 


His “independence” was recently defended by a meandering 260-word footnote in Dollarama’s proxy which belies the 


fact that Dollarama is a top 10 customer of SmartCentres. 


This is all the more suspicious in light of Dollarama’s questionable lease accounting highlighted earlier.

House of Windsor, House of Rossy:
A Case Study In Nepotism


Neil Rossy had been the Senior VP of Merchandising / Chief Merchandising Officer for 25 years prior to being named CEO in 


2016. While his family is still a large shareholder, they are not a controlling shareholder, owning around 5% of the shares 


outstanding. We question whether the Rossy’s century-long family tradition of passing down leadership – one which also 


persists at the Rossy’s “sister store” – is appropriate for a public company, or wise for the long-term health of the business.


Salim Rossy


Opened first “S. Rossy” 


store in 1910 (up-market 


department store concept)


George Rossy


President of S. Rossy, 


1937-1973


Larry Rossy


Grew S. Rossy from 20 to 44 stores before 


converting all S. Rossy stores to new 


“Dollarama” concept in 1992. Sold majority 


stake to Bain Capital in 2004. IPO in 2009.


Neil Rossy


CEO of Dollarama as of 2016


Michael Rossy


Brother of George (one of ten siblings)


Founder & CEO of “Rossy” stores, 1949-2010


Michael DiTullio


Son-in-Law of Michael


President & CEO of Rossy since 2010


Does (or will) the family have a hard time parting with a business that has been in the family for four generations, even if parting ways is 


the right thing to do?


Managing retail chains is very 


much a family affair for the 


Rossys – at both stores


Perhaps Neil was going to be 


anointed CEO of Dollarama 


regardless of the caliber of other 


potential candidates


Let’s hope he’s not Commodus!


BONUS:


Brother branches out 


with separate store…

Insiders Incentivized To Grow EBITDA


Our earlier concerns about EBITDA quality are amplified by the fact that Dollarama executives are compensated 


based on seemingly arbitrary and inflated EBITDA targets. This gives management a strong incentive to be inefficient 


users of capital, as any dollar shifted from operating expense to capex has a direct benefit to key executives.


For example, note that management’s perhaps questionable decision to purchase one of its Montreal warehouses 


will shift what was until recently rent expense into depreciation. This change in the accounting treatment of 


Dollarama’s tenancy costs will provide a windfall to EBITDA, potentially boosting management bonuses.

What Is A Stretch EBITDA Goal?


Bonuses are paid upon achievement of 11% EBITDA growth. This level was “designed to be a stretch objective…. 


attainable only with significant effort”. However, this target was reset lower after FY 2014 – the only year during which 


management did not handily exceed the target! We believe this further calls into question the independence of the 


board and its compensation committee.


Year EBITDA Growth Objective EBITDA Growth Achieved


FY 2018 11% 18%


FY 2017 11% 18%


FY 2016 11% 30%


FY 2015 11% 15%


FY 2014 13% 12%


FY 2013 13% 22%


FY 2012 13% 26%


FY 2014: Management 


misses growth objective


FY 2015: Growth objective 


adjusted downwards


“The thresholds were revised by the 


Human Resources and Compensation 


Committee in the context of its annual 


executive compensation review 


conducted at the beginning of each fiscal 


year to take into account, among other 


elements, the fact that the base for the 


calculation is growing every year.”

Insiders Selling While Company Buys 
Back Stock At Elevated Prices


Management has been buying back shares at elevated prices through the last several years even while pursuing growth, leaving little capital for 


(sorely needed) store updates or other uses. The average repurchase price since Q1 FY17 is about on par with current share prices and ~40% 


below our target. Since Q2 FY18, the average buyback price has been 25% above current levels.


Furthermore, just as the Company has been buying back stock at elevated prices, insiders have been offloading shares. Notably, it is evident 


from past and current proxy statements that CFO Michael Ross has never held onto shares for which he has been granted options: his 


common equity ownership is listed at zero every year. Note that, as the CFO, it is he who is dictating the share buyback decision in large part.

We do not like the fact that insiders have been selling into share buybacks while 


the Company levers itself up with short-term debt to support those repurchases.


It appears that the execs are levering up the business in part to enrich themselves.1) All share information prior to Q2 ‘19 reflects pre-split data, except 
Split-Adjusted Average Prices. Q2 ‘19 repurchases were as stated.

Rossy Family Selling Shares Despite 
Control Over C-Suite


Notably, Founder and former CEO Larry Rossy has trimmed his position tremendously through the last several years. 


Though this is to be expected to some extent, as he recently ceded control of the business, we believe that his 


ownership stake should be held to a higher standard given his insistence on keeping the business in the family.


If he plans to keep the c-suite under a Rossy dynasty, the family’s personal stake in the business should reflect that.

The Market Has Not Taken Threats To 
Dollarama Seriously – But Optimism Is Ebbing


Analysts are generally bullish on the stock, focusing primarily on management’s growth story and taking current 


profitability levels for granted. The prospect of new competitive threats to a business which has until now seen limited 


competition – and the risk that prevailing margins are unsustainable even through the near term – go underappreciated.


Dollarama’s poor Q2 cooled analysts’ optimism to some extent, but we believe that the reaction was largely reactive and 


superficial, as they adjusted their price targets in such a way that, in aggregate, they saw exactly the same upside after the 


post-Q2 dip as they did before. The market still does not fully appreciate the magnitude of the threats facing Dollarama.

While analysts are still not sufficiently critical of Dollarama, the more recent downward move in the stock and subsequent analyst 


downgrades may suggest that the market could be primed to evaluate the Company and its growth story with a more discerning eye.


We believe that the issues which we highlight in this report will provoke further professional skepticism among analysts and investors.

Dollarama Not Priced To Perfection –
Priced Beyond Perfection


We can get close to DOL’s current valuation only if we value it as a mature, ex-growth business today under 


management’s lofty goals for the business for ten years into the future, applying no discounts for time, 


business risk, etc.


Management’s ten-year store target


• Current store count: 1,178 (70% of long-


term target)


Even if Dollarama were a mature business today under management’s long-term targets for the business, 


DOL stock would not have no upside to current share prices.


The market is pricing DOL beyond perfection – a valuation this lofty cannot be justified today.

Dollarama Not Priced To Perfection –

Put another way: The market is implicitly taking it for

Valuation Far Out Of Line With Peers And 
Historical Multiples


DOL shares trade at a 50-60% premium to peers in the discount retail industry. The market is valuing DOL much more like a high-


growth tech company than a brick-and-mortar dollar store (and one with concerning fundamental trends at that). Note that this still 


holds true even after DOL shares traded down significantly following its recent Q2 earnings report.


It is difficult to justify a valuation this high even if one is bullish on DOL vis-à-vis the rest of the industry.

Does The Market Think Dollarama Is A 
Dollar Store Or A Premium Retail Brand?


Dollarama is valued much more closely to premium retail brands than its discount retail peer group.


A bull might “justify” this by pointing to Dollarama’s profitability profile and growth expectations, but its EBITDA margins are so 


out of line with those of its peers that one is forced to question whether they are sustainable (at best) or honest (at worst).


As discussed, Dollarama’s consensus sales growth numbers also ignore looming fundamental threats to the business.

Margins And Multiples Materially 
Out-of-Line With Peers


We do not believe that Dollarama’s profitability levels – which are entirely out of line with peers – are justified or sustainable in an 


industry as competitive as deep discount retail. The Company is already struggling to meet store count growth targets, raising the 


likelihood that its store growth plan will be dilutive to margins. The market assigns a premium valuation to Dollarama on the basis 


of relatively high growth expectations and the Company’s industry-leading margins. However, as discussed throughout this 


report, we doubt both management’s ability to meet its growth targets and its ability to maintain prevailing profitability levels. The 


likelihood that the Company will be able to achieve BOTH of these goals simultaneously is even slimmer. Accordingly, we believe 


that the basis for Dollarama’s substantial share price premium is unfounded.


Dollarama’s margin profile is grossly out of 


line with peers, and we find evidence of 


aggressive accounting and questionable 


business practices that can partly explain the 


issue. We doubt that this would be sustainable 


even if management wasn’t growing the chain.


How will a low/no-moat business with falling 


per-store traffic be able to maintain its 


remarkable profitability advantage while 


aggressively expanding its store base?

As discussed earlier, at 1,700 stores, DOL would have greater penetration than both Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR), 


which both offer a much broader assortment of goods including perishables/consumables. Meanwhile, the U.S. appears to be 


overstored versus Canada. It is likely unreasonable for DOL to target per capita penetration levels on par with its U.S. peers.


Even if we assume that DOL can reach similar penetration levels and match company 


growth targets – with steady margins no less – DOL has little upside.


Valuing DOL as a mature business at its upper penetration bound implies ~40% downside 


in a more realistic, yet still generous scenario in which DOL is valued in line with peers.
