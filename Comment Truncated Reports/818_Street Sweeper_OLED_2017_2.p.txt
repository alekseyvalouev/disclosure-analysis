Universal Display (OLED): Horror Movie In The Making


by Sonya Colberg, Senior Editor - 5/15/2017 8:45:02 AM


Universal Display Corp. (OLED) fans focus on record stock prices and a
commentator’s thoughts … as the company’s biggest commercial licensing deal
fades to black and a major rival steps up.
TheStreetSweeper has seen horror movies like this before. And we don’t want to sit
through another bad sequel.
So we’re sharing seven big risks associated with this company focused on a light-
emission dust used in  screens on phones and other devices.
*1. Biggest License Deal Ends
The New Jersey-based company’s biggest commercial licensing deal … with
Samsung … ends this year:
“Currently, the Company's most significant commercial license
agreement, which runs through the end of 2017, is with Samsung Display
Co., Ltd. (SDC) and covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display
products. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable
in semi-annual installments over the agreement term of 6.4 years. The
installments, which are due in the second and fourth quarter of each year,
increase on an annual basis over the term of the agreement.”
The deal put Universal Display on the map in 2011 and generated millions in
revenue. But this year … it looks like a wrap.
*2. Patent Cliff: Barriers to Entry DropPatent
Patents owned by the company are at the brink of expiration.Patent
Indeed, the company’s fundamental patent (“Transparent Contacts for Organicpatent
Light Emitters”) is scheduled to expire this December. Others hit their 20-year
patent protection expiration date as early as next year, as indicated in the SECpatent
filing here.
The patent cliff is significant because Universal Display’s barriers to entry willpatent
come crashing down. Anybody and everybody will then be able to use the
technology.
*3. Major Competitor: Merck KGaA
Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRK.MI) is ready to shake up the organic light emitting
diode (OLED) world.
The chief executive of Merck, the world’s largest maker of liquid crystals for flat
screens, told Reuters late last month that the company will forge ahead with new
technologies, “for instance OLED.”
Merck has been in OLED chemical production since 2009. Merck doesn’t like the
light emitting diode margins - Universal Display makes pathetic 23% margins. But
Merck’s renewed interest in light emitting diodes comes now that the company
expects erosion of its dominance in liquid crystals.
Merck will naturally go after Apple, Samsung and every other device biggie.
Merck is among dozens of OLED market players, including Dow Chemical and
BASF. Merck plans to lead the market by 2018.
With $15-billion in sales and $900 million in cash (75 times more sales and 9
times more cash) the Merck monster can squash Universal Display like a bug.

5/23/2018 TheStreetSweeper - Universal Display OLED Horror Movie In The Making


http://thestreetsweeper.org/undersurveillance/Universal_Display__OLED___Horror_Movie_In_The_Making 2/4


*4. Commentator Spurs Stock
With all due respect to Jim Cramer, we disagree with him this time.
The stock price rose from about $90 on positive financials on May 4 to $116 in the
days that two analysts reported on the stock, plus the CNBC commentator made
positive remarks on May 5 and May 8.





(Source: CNBC)


(Source: CNN Money)


In the second commentary, with the stock around record highs, the TV personality
said he wouldn’t “step in front of this… I would not short it.”
When the price is preposterously high, it seems rather odd - or maybe just a little
tone-deaf -  to draw more people to the stock at that high point.
But just as importantly, Mr. Cramer isn’t always right. Researchers with the
University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School found the stock picker doesn’t beat
the market, indeed his fund over recent years returned 64.5% cumulatively versus
70% for the S&P 500.  
And we definitely think he’s on the wrong side of this stock.
*5. Expenses Rocket … 50%
The company’s sales, general and administration costs last quarter skyrocketed
by 50.7% to $10.1 million.
Why? Company SEC filings explain:
“Incremental costs associated with the addition of Adesis activity, as well as higher
employee-related costs.”
Companies that indulge in buying or rolling-up other companies in hopes of briefly
raising their own revenue often get hit this way. The expenses and time needed to
weave in the other company go airborne.
*6. Ridiculous P/E, P/S; Stock Over 12-Month Estimates
Universal Display has a price-to-earnings ratio of … wait for it … wait for it … 95.
What can we say?
That 95 is the industry's most expensive  … nearly four times higher than the
average.
The price-to-sales is also the highest. At this level, people are paying 23.6 P/S,
which is five times above average.
The stock is already more expensive than the $100 that analysts estimate for 12
months out.

In fact, insiders themselves are sending signals indicating they think the stock
price is just right for selling …
*7. CEO, Founder, License Manager: All Selling Company Stock
Some company insiders -specifically the chief executive and the chief technology
officer - evidently think $74 to $79 per share were good selling price points.





(Source: CNN Money)


Everyone from the founder to the licensing officer has recently hit the “Sell”
button:





(Source: CNN Money)


With the stock price this high, who would be shocked if insiders sold a lot more
stock?
*Conclusion
As we mentioned, we’ve seen this movie way too many times before. We won’t just
grab two boxes of tissue and wait for another Greek tragedy to carry us away.
TheStreetSweeper expects a screaming swoon for Universal Display … as the stock
retreats to pre-rally levels.
