REGULATION – IT TAKES A
WHILE BUT WHEN IT
COMES – KABOOM –
WATCH OUT WORLD
ACCEPTANCE CORP.
(WRLD)


Last year Citron Research wrote about Apollo
Group (APOL), predicting the inevitability of
forthcoming regulation to curb their extremely
aggressive sales practices.  The shareholders didn’t
listen, and analysts raised their targets.  But in one
year the largest private educator in the country saw
its stock cut in half.


Also last year Citron warned about holding
Amedisys(AMED) in light of forthcoming regulation
of their overly aggressive Medicare billing practices.
The shareholders didn’t want to listen and analysts
raised their targets.  But the government stepped in
and the stock price of the largest provider of home
healthcare in the county is down 50% from its
highs.


Citron has written numerous stories about
government regulation over the years and ALL of
them have come to fruition except one — whose
time has now come.  Recently the US Government
has established the Consumer Financial Protection
Agency.  Picked to head it is none other but
outspoken consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren.

The issue for World Acceptance is eerily similar to
the fate of subprime mortgage originator New
Century,   NEWCCQ) whose model depended on
home prices rising every year for the company to
stay in business.  World needs to be able to
re�nance its portfolio several times per year to roll
over borrowers who can’t pay.  When that becomes
a regulated activity, the house of cards collapses.


This is a major concern to World
Acceptance:  They’ve said so!
For those of you who are new to the story, World
Acceptance is the most sub-prime of all sub-prime
lenders — they lend small dollar amounts to the
US’s most non-creditworthy under the umbrella of
“installment” lending, as contrasted to “payday
lending”, thereby skirting many regulations now
curbing excesses in the latter industry. Still, their
business model is only legal in the eleven (mostly
southeastern) states where they currently operate. 
A staggering 84.7% of WRLD loans are made to
existing or former customers – re�ecting a practice
of relentlessly “�ipping” loans.  Unlike many payday
loans, these loans do not get repaid and then a new
loan is created, instead…they just get rolled
over…..and over ….. and over.


With a $563 million dollar book of receivables that
is collateralized by lawnmowers, CD players and
electric guitars, WRLD is one piece of regulation
from being a company of the past… Don’t listen to
us… just read it from the company’s own 10-K
�lings:


“Federal legislative or regulatory proposals,
initiatives, actions or changes that are
adverse to our operations or result in
adverse regulatory proceedings, or our
failure to comply with existing or future
federal laws and regulations, could force us
to modify, suspend or cease part or all of
our nationwide operations.”


“It is impossible to predict the e�ect that
the creation of such an unprecedented
federal regulator will have on the

Company’s operations and on access to
consumer credit in general; however, there
can be no assurance that any such
regulatory entity would not exercise its
powers in a manner that will, either directly
or indirectly, have a material and adverse
e�ect on, or eliminate altogether, the
Company’s ability to operate its business
pro�tably”


And if you think that is “just SEC disclosure talk” …
go the website of WRLD’s trade association where
the CEO sits on the board.  As they rallied against
the CFPA, they expressed their concern, noting:


“The creation of a new federal agency, in
addition to the state agencies we currently
comply with, will restrict what installment
lenders can charge for our services and
could well force us out of business
altogether.”

Earlier this year WRLD hoped the
CFPA would not get created – IT DID.
Then they hoped banking industry
lobbyists would prevent its
authorization as a separate agency
but rather a part of the Fed- It
became a separate agency.
Their industry lobbyists set out to
create a “carve out” for small lenders,
preventing them from being
regulated by the CFPA — NO “CARVE
OUT” FOR SMALL LENDERS.
Lastly, their industry hoped that
outspoken consumer advocate
Elizabeth Warren would not be the
new sheri�, (branding her
“uncon�rmable”) – And She IS.


So let’s keep this simple and describe the cleaning
up of an industry through government
intervention.  Citron will compare the stated policy

positions of Mrs. Warren to the business practices
of World Acceptance:  you decide for yourself.


In Her Own Words
Last year, Mrs. Warren expressed her outrage for
the problems caused by companies like WRLD in
the following piece.
http://www.hu�ngtonpost.com/elizabeth-
warren/real-change-turning-up-th_b_276887.html
[http://www.hu�ngtonpost.com/elizabeth-
warren/real-change-turning-up-th_b_276887.html]


In it she writes


“ But there is an even bigger change in the
wind: regulating the non-banks… Non-bank
institutions were active participants in the
race to the bottom among lenders. From
subprime mortgage loans to small dollar
loans, they showed how to wring high fees
and staggering interest rates out of
consumer lending. Their �ne-print
contracts, and new tricks and traps,
transformed the market.”


In her �rst order of business this month, Elizabeth
Warren has vowed to end �nancial “tricks and
traps”.  UH OH.  You mean the same traps that keep
80% of their customers in the cycle of debt. ?  And
the same tricks that allow WRLD to operate in many
states that outlaw payday lending.

Elizabeth Warren has also vowed to keeping credit
simple.

This does not fare well for a company that issues
high interest rate subprime loans based on the rule
of 78’s.  Try explaining the WRLD interest formula to
their customers.


u = f * k(k+1)/n(n+1)

u = unearned interest; f = total agreed
�nance charges; k = number of months
paying o� early; n = total term of loan in
months.


So who is this law really protecting?  Here is a
sample loan prepared by WRLD that will hopefully
become a thing of the past.  This was pulled from
bankruptcy court �lings.


In this loan, the customer thought he was JUST
paying 150% interest but let’s look at what really
happened.  A guy walks into a World Finance, owing
them $138.  He gets rolled over into a new loan and
walks out of the o�ce with $60 in his pocket while
he pays $80 in fees alone on that same day.


WRLD Loan 1 [http://citronresearch.com/wp-

A recent white house press release states:

protect-consumers
[https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/09/17/�ghting-

“The new law creates a chance to put a
tough cop on the beat and provide real
accountability and oversight of the
consumer credit market. The time for
hiding tricks and traps in the �ne print is
over.


Would that refer to something resembling the trick
and the trap of this loan?  Beyond all of the extra
insurance that was bought (just an add on fee) what
is most interesting about this loan is that the
borrower �led for bankruptcy just weeks later.
 Notice how on this loan, the borrower paid $279 of
just add on fees (non APR) on that date — all to
walk out the door with $532.

In the opinion of Citron, it is noteworthy that the
analysts covering this stock have not said one word
about the regulatory environment and its
anticipated impact on the sustainability of WRLD’s
business.


Military Lending
As mentioned in an earlier report, there is one
aspect of WRLD’s business that Citron believes is in
most peril.  While the government has made it
illegal for any payday lender to lend money to
members of the military with more than 36% APR,
WRLD has exploited the loophole by hiding under
“installment loans” and not payday loans,
meanwhile operating o�ces surrounding military
bases that focus exclusively on military lending. 
Citron believes that these loans are of their “highest
quality” due to the direct accountability of the
customer.


Elizabeth Warren has previously stated her disdain
for this practice by stating:


“Lenders ring military bases because
military families are vulnerable.  And as
their vulnerability increases, the payday
lenders and other predators close in
tighter.”


http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2006/08/iraq_pay
[http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2006/08/iraq_pay


The Big Picture
World’s stock will not wait for the vulnerability of its
entire loan book to surface.  If government policy
impacts just 10% of World’s loans, leverage extends
the consequences across the company’s entire loan
book, their credit lines, earnings, and their loan
growth metrics.


In the case of �nancial services companies that
have crashed and burned, it wasn’t outright fraud, it
was overleverage – that exposes the uncalculated
risk embedded in the company’s loan book.

World’s $560 million book of loans is collateralized
by …. nothing of value.


Due to the leverage inherent in World’s �nancial
structure, apparently small tweaks to the regulatory
environment which seek to curb business practices
such as :


Military lending
Junk fees such as credit insurance
Interest calculations
Curbs on “loan �ipping”
Curbs on sham collateralizations


… have dramatic e�ects on its credit quality and
earnings simultaneously.


The cumulative e�ects of these provisions will curb
World’s ability to �ip loans, both in terms of
maximum loan size, and number of loans
outstanding to a borrower. It is Citron’s opinion that
these impacts are already threatening the
pro�tability of World’s operations in Illinois, to the
point where its continued presence in the state is at
the very least an open question.


Conclusion
This current Citron report explores changes in the
federal regulatory climate.  There are MANY more
issues that are not being discussed, including but
not limited to:


The change in the many state laws
including changes just enacted in
Illinois.
The elimination of the Income Tax
Refund Anticipation Loan Business of
WRLD.
The future of installment lending in
Mexico
How many loans actually have to
default to bring the company in
violation of their new credit
agreement, which in the opinion of

Citron is only as good as the
legislative status quo


It is impossible to state when and what regulation
will be enacted in the near future, but what is now
clear is that by establishing the CFPA and
appointing Ms.Warren to head it, the Obama
Administration has exercised its mandate to change
the current laws of predatory consumer lending. 
Similarly, while they may move slowly, the few
states that WRLD is allowed to operate in are
beginning to understand the lending practices
fostered by the loopholes in their own lending
laws. …tick tock, tick tock.
