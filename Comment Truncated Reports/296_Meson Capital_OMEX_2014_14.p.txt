SSCA Inventory Unsealed: Confirms Disappointing Salvage, Meson's
Estimates
Jul. 17, 2014 3:31 PM ET111 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


SS Central America inventory matches Meson estimates posted July 10: ~5,000oz
gold total, ~70/30 ingots/coins. ONLY ~150 1oz coins found in last month of work.


Fifth Third credit line borrowing capacity should max out at $7mm unrestricted cash
now, confirms Meson estimates made July 10.


Project now appears incrementally unprofitable for further salvage, seems unlikely
Odyssey Explorer will revisit the site.


Appears OMEXs only hope of surviving August is Oceanica’s roadshow but EIA still
not filed and environmental opposition in Mexico is extremely strong due to
undisclosed overlapping fishing concessions.


The court has just unsealed the inventory of Odyssey Marine Exploration
(NASDAQ:OMEX)'s latest SS Central America inventories. Some news sources have just
recently picked up on this but are not reporting the precise numbers found in the
documents. As usual, we are bringing you transparency before the company itself, as the
results confirm a recovery well below OMEX's stated expectations of 80k+ oz of gold,
coming in at 5,000oz.


As a refresher there have been 4 salvage trips: April 15 ("2 hour dive"); May 8-13; May 19-
June 12, and the most recent June 19-July 15 (which does not yet have a status report
except what we reported July 10: only a few small containers. All of these containers
would easily fit into the trunk of a small vehicle)


The key court documents:


1) Status Report For April 15-May 15


2) Inventory Sheet for April 15-May 15


3) Status Report May 15-June 19


4) Inventory Sheet for May 15-June 19

5) Inventory Sheet for June 19-July 15 (JUST FILED TODAY: only salvaged ~200 Double
Eagles total)


Summarizing the findings


As we know from the documents, gold was $20/oz when the ship sank so the "face value"
reported in dollars can be used to calculate the total oz of gold. We also know that the
Fifth Third credit line allows borrowing $2,000/oz for double eagle coins (1oz) and ½ the
appraised value of ingots (we will conservatively also estimate these at the same value as
coins so $2,000/oz for borrowing against those). After the first $5mm borrowings, the
collateral requirements double to $1,000/oz borrowing capacity.


Note there are numerous other non-gold artifacts but the gold is all that can be borrowed
against on the credit line. Given that these artifacts will not be sold for a very long time
and the trustee does not have to worry about rapid cash burn to pay executives that
OMEX does, they will likely take their time to sell them in an orderly way to maximize
profits to the estate, perhaps over the course of 2 years, but who knows.


The point is the only source of cash for OMEX is the borrowing against these on the credit
line. We believe Fifth Third has made a grave error lending against these assets as they
are not within OMEX's control to liquidate, but that is their issue, not shareholders…


Based on the new data (in green) we can confirm our estimates posted July 10th of an
extra $2.7mm unrestricted cash availability vs May 15th on the credit line. If cash burn is
still at $3mm/month then cash should hit zero (with liabilities at $18.5mm in the first week
of August, about 2-3 weeks from today).


As you can see from the data, the total salvage per day of searching has been on a
steady decline, which makes sense as treasure is not a renewable resource. We further
believe that this latest trip was likely to be unprofitable given the initial indications that the
salvage was minimal and it is likely the Odyssey Explorer will not revisit the site as the
expenses (estimated $60k/day all in - vs $100k/day cash burn at the company overall) will
not be covered.

gamblers out there they did not find any trace of "Army Gold" though they did in fact find a
safe which held a handful of gold wrapped in cloth…

Oceanica is now apparently on a roadshow - last and only hope to have cash for
OMEX past August


Thanks to Green River, as usual, sharing his nonpublic information that he likely received
from OMEX, it seems Oceanica is in the middle of a roadshow to raise money.

As we previously discussed on July 8th, Oceanica still has not filed its EIA and any cash
raised will likely simply be funneled out to pay OMEX compensation at the parent
company.


In fact, we have learned quite a bit more about Oceanica as people in Mexico reach out to
us to share the chaos that is happening with the project. We will share more on this in the
near future but the project appears to be completely unraveling and has hit a wall of
environmental resistance. In fact, it appears that OMEX didn't even have the proper
permits to perform the drilling core samples!


A sample of the powerful environmental resistance in the local Mexican media (which of
course has not been disclosed by OMEX):
