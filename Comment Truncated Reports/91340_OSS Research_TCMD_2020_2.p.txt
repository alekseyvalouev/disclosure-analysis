Summary


This report expresses the author’s opinions. The author of this report has a short
position in TCMD that will benefit from a decline in the price of TCMD’s securities. A full
disclaimer can be found at the end of this report. This is a follow-on to our initial report
published in June 2020. If you have not done so already, we strongly encourage you to
read it here: link


In our first article, we expressed the opinion that Tactile had significantly overstated its
addressable market. Moreover, we presented Medicare RAC audit data showing that
RAC auditor Performant Recovery had audited and retroactively denied over 70% of
Tactile's Medicare claims since February 2019. Finally, we also highlighted the existence
of a whistleblower lawsuit against Tactile in which the relator alleges the company has
knowingly violated the Anti-kickback Statue by providing remuneration to clinicians in
the form of training fees. Read on to learn about our new findings below:


Multiple sources of government data suggest a concerning pattern of reporting
discrepancies between Tactile’s financial statements and VA and Medicare
payment statistics. Backed by hard data, we shed light on what we believe to be
revenue recognition practices that mask the increasingly severe repercussions of both
the Medicare RAC audits as well as the whistleblower lawsuit.


New documents from the Qui Tam case provide further insight into the inner workings of
Tactile’s sales and marketing activity, including witness testimony from former senior
regulators attesting to the presence of systemic misconduct covering kickbacks, pre-
filled prescriptions, and other false claims. Expert testimony on pre-filled
prescriptions is supported by actual documentation sent to us by an industry
insider that we believe suggests these practices are systemic across the Tactile
organization.


If that is not disturbing enough, discovery documents in a discrimination lawsuit also
revealed exorbitantly high rates of prescriber concentration.


All this while five new reputable and well-capitalized MedTech competitors have recently
received 510(k) approval to compete with Tactile—nearly tripling the number of
competitors on the playing field.

RAC Audits Appear to be Homing in On Tactile


Since our report in June, further FOIA requests via CMS have revealed additional RAC
audits targeted at Tactile.


Source: CMS FOIA


FOIA officers provided a table of all E0651 claims audited over the last year, including
dates, denial reasons, and the associated provider. A sample of the raw data we
received is shown below, including highlights indicating some of Tactile's more recent
RAC audit denials (Tactile's NPI code is 1427131424, see here).

(#1)


Using this data, we provide a timeline and analysis of the RAC audit results specifically
for Tactile below:

Source: CMS FOIA, OSS analysis of FOIA data (TCMD denials taken as a percentage
of claims requested from TCMD)


According to the FOIA records, Performant requested an additional 121 claims for audit
on December 10th, 2019. The results of these audits were disclosed to Tactile over the
course of February and March 2020. Our analysis of the data revealed a denial rate of
81%: a further increase from the already sky-high denial rates in previous batches
of claim audits.


Nevertheless, sell-side continues to downplay and ignore the risks continued RAC
audits represent to the company:


Source: Piper Sandler Research Report, June 18th, 2020, emphasis added


Evidently, sell-side have attempted to assuage investors by making three key
arguments:


The RAC audits are broad-based and were not specifically targeted at Tactile,1.


Performant has not requested further claims for review since December 2019, and2.


The RAC audits have had no impact on revenue and prescriber activity in the
Medicare channel


3.


We believe these arguments are spurious and push back below:

Putting aside the previously mentioned fact (from our June report) that Tactile already
represents ~10% of all audits we have data for so far, we believe the evidence actually
suggests an increasing focus on Tactile over time.


Based on CMS FOIA records as shown below, we were able to put together a basic
timeline of the RAC audit process:


Source: CMS FOIA records, some columns were removed to fit table legibly, the original
source document here (#2). Received from a third party's FOIA request


Source: CMS FOIA records, OSS analysis of FOIA data


Between these two waves (the first 800 up to August 2019, and the next 5,000), the
percentage of claims requested from Tactile more than doubled from ~5% to
~12%. We see this as strong evidence that Tactile is being disproportionately targeted.
Recall that in the most recent batch of audits, Tactile once again saw an extremely high
denial rate of 81%.

period as shown in the table. “To Date” refers to the latest data we have, or Aug 2020)


SELL-SIDE COUNTERARGUMENT #2: Performant has not requested further claims for
review since December 2019


According to management, Tactile has not received any additional claims requests since
December 2019. While true, we believe this argument is misleading: what it ignores is
that all Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) medical reviews were suspended as of
March 30, 2020.


Recall that audit results from Tactile's third and most recent batch of claims were
released in February and March of 2020. In other words, all RAC audits were
suspended shortly after the end of Tactile's third batch of reviews.


We believe the fact that Tactile has not received additional claims requests since
December in no way attests to an end in RAC audits. In our opinion, it is purely a
symptom of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notably, CMS authorized the resumption in RAC audit activities on August 3, 2020. We
highlight three points:


Tactile's most recent batch of audits saw an even greater denial rate of 81% vs.
~70% previously.


The percentage of reviews targeted at Tactile has increased from 5% to 12% over
the last two waves of audits.


Medicare has authorized 5,800 claim requests, of which Performant has only
conducted ~2,800. There are another 3,000 claims to go in the current audit wave
alone.


We will let readers come to their own conclusions on the likelihood of further audits on
Tactile.

CMS FOIA Data Reveal Alarming Discrepancies with Tactile
Revenue Reporting


Empirical evidence suggests this is not true and we believe we have hard data to refute
sell-side's claim. This discussion merits a whole other section on its own—one that
addresses a potentially unsettling question. What's going on with Tactile's revenue
reporting?


Detailed analysis of Medicare FOIA data and Tactile's SEC filings revealed the following
fact pattern:


Tactile's self-reported Medicare revenues are 50 - 70% higher than what
Medicare payments data has shown since at least 2019


During this same period, Tactile's Medicare days receivable have skyrocketed by
nearly 3x


Also during this same period, Medicare denials of Tactile billing requests for both
E0651 and E0652 devices have both seen high-double-digit increases


On their own, ballooning days receivable, increasing denial rates, and a large and
growing gap between government data vs. revenue reporting are concerning but
possibly explainable. Together, with the RAC audits, we find it potentially alarming.


Medicare Data vs. Tactile Reporting


To start with, we received data collected by a CMS FOIA officer that allowed us to
compile Medicare payments to and billings by Tactile, by HCPC code. A sample of that
data is included below:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/9/25/51561951-16010196876369708_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394053-strong-sell-on-tactile-systems-part-ii?source=all_articles_title 9/37


Source: CMS FOIA Response


We compiled all claims approved by Medicare to Tactile based on the date of service of
the devices. Notice that the data includes all codes (E0667 / E0668) and not just E0651
and E0652: we believe this should represent an objective, un-biased measure of
Tactile's Medicare revenue as reported by the US government.


A comparison of this CMS data and Tactile's reporting presented to investors revealed
serious concerns. Tactile's reported Medicare revenue of ~$22mm in 2019 appears to
be overstated by 53% when compared with CMS. This gap further increased to 73%
for the first half of 2020.

These are large discrepancies between reporting by the company and the US
government. We have sent Tactile investor relations a full copy of our research for
feedback and comment but have not received a response regarding the discrepancies
we found.


Tactile Medicare A/R vs. Medicare Denial Rates from FOIA


Now consider that since our last report in June, Tactile's 2Q 2020 results revealed yet
another highly concerning increase in Medicare accounts receivable days. Between 1Q
and 2Q, Medicare receivable days stretched by over 68%. This was a ~150%
increase year on year.

Source: Tactile SEC filings, OSS analysis (for each quarter, reported LT accounts
receivable divided by reported Medicare revenue, then multiplied by 90 days)


Though surprising at first glance, the increase in A/R days actually fits with what FOIA
data suggests is happening behind the scenes. Since the RAC audits began in
January 2019, Medicare denials of both E0651 and E0652 devices billed by Tactile
have dramatically increased—nearly doubling in the case of E0651's from March
2019.


(Note that this is different from the RAC audit denial rates: the RAC audit is looking back and denying claims
that have already been paid by Medicare. The denial rate here is denying requests submitted by Tactile and a
refusal by Medicare to approve the product around the time of prescription. Note also that the data sent to us
was through to July 19 , 2020 and the last column may therefore not be reflective of final results.)th

Our opinion is that the high denial rates in January and February 2019 may have been a one-time bump driven
by the beginning of the RAC audit. We believe this because the RAC audit was announced on January 23,
2019, and Tactile denial rates in January dramatically increased into the back half of the month, largely
coinciding with the beginning of the RAC audit:

More Revenue Reporting Questions with the VA Channel

Recall sell-side was claiming that "management saw no selling impact" from the RAC audits.


Tactile Risk Disclosure


The final piece of the puzzle comes from Tactile's own risk disclosure language on this
issue:


Source: Tactile 2019 10K, Risk Disclosure


Instead of writing these receivables down as indicated in the company's own
accounting policy, we believe Tactile has continued to book Medicare revenue
while allowing Medicare receivable days to skyrocket. We have sent Tactile investor
relations a full copy of our research for feedback and comment but have not received a
response regarding our allegations related to revenue recognition.


In fact, based on evidence as presented below, we believe this is potentially a systemic
issue that also affects other revenue channels.

purchases of products from Tactile:

overstatement of ~22% when compared to VA FOIA data.

Concerning Expert Witness Testimony from Qui Tam Lawsuit


Given what appears to be consistent over-reporting of revenue relative to
government data, we feel compelled to express concern about the company's
receivables and/or its revenue recognition policies.


This is probably a good time to share one final chart. Total accounts receivable days for
the entire company. This is including the private payor channel:


Source: Tactile SEC filings, OSS analysis


Before readers bring up Covid-19, don't forget Tactile still grew revenue 16% YoY in
1Q20. And over that same period of time, accounts receivables (EXCLUDING
Medicare receivables) grew a whopping 42%.


As indicated in our last article, a Houston based competitor Veterans First Medical
Supply (VFMS) filed a Qui Tam civil suit against Tactile on August 20, 2018. Qui Tam
suits are filed on behalf of the US Attorney General and represents a legal route for
whistleblowers in the healthcare industry. Central to the lawsuit is the allegations of
Tactile’s use of unlawful financial incentives and marketing practices to induce sales and
share gains.

The full complaint as well as the source documents for our discussion below can be
obtained by visiting the following website: Public Access to Court Electronic Records |
PACER: Federal Court Records. You will need to look up the case number (4:18-cv-
02871) under the PACER Case Locator.


On September 29, 2020, the relator in the Qui Tam lawsuit filed against Tactile released
a new brief that included alarming testimony from two key expert witnesses, Thomas M.
Suehs, former Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services
Commission, and Cynthia Brock, Divisional VP of Regulatory Affairs for Kindred at
Home.


Source: Case 4:18-cv-02871 Document 68, emphasis added


In fact, testimony from both experts strongly corroborates what we have
discussed in our current and previous reports: 1) an indirect sales and marketing
strategy that experts believe to be in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute, and 2)
serious issues surrounding medical necessity for Tactile pump prescriptions as backed
by the RAC audit results.


We informed Tactile about the allegations of kickbacks seeking feedback or comments
through a full copy of our research, but did not receive a response.


While many of the underlying evidence documents remain under seal, we believe what
has surfaced in this brief is already concerning. Let's start with the statement from
Thomas Suehs, the former Executive Commissioner:

Tactile's trainer agreements, consulting arrangements, and more:

Equally, the expert report of Cynthia Brock testifies to a similar opinion:


Source: Case 4:18-cv-02871 Document 68


We believe this following section from Mrs. Brock's statement is even more important:


While industry participants we spoke to have brought up Tactile's clinician remuneration
activity before (see our first article), these Form-1099s appear to represent concrete
evidence of this conduct. The fact these forms are mentioned here is revealing. If the
relator is able to establish links between training compensation and prescriptions, we
believe this would be a crucial piece of evidence for the case.


“Pre-Filled Medical Necessity Verbiage”


Note we have yet to discuss the text we emphasized with red boxes—the expert opinion
relating to Tactile’s use of pre-filled medical necessity and prescription.


What is a pre-filled prescription in this context? Given the rigorous reimbursement and
medical necessity criteria in reimbursing E0652 devices, doctors need to diagnose and
then document patient progress through multiple first-line treatments (if they work,
E0652 is not needed) before filling out a prescription request for the device. A pre-filled
prescription is when a sales rep or distributor fills these documents out for the doctor.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394053-strong-sell-on-tactile-systems-part-ii?source=all_articles_title 19/37


Potentially Systemic Use of Pre-Filled Prescriptions at Tactile


Think of it this way: the salesperson marketing the device is telling/giving the
doctor what to diagnose and prescribe a patient. The conflict of interest issues here
should be self-evident: manufacturer and distributor sales staff have clear incentives to
drive more prescriptions and therefore revenue for their devices, sometimes at the
expense of patient treatment (and of course taxpayers).


Unsurprisingly, pre-filling prescriptions is illegal. If you’re still not convinced, just look at
this recent indictment from the US Dept. of Justice for a case being investigated by the
FBI and OIG HHS in Arkansas. This is an issue prosecutors and regulators take
seriously. Note this is merely an example to demonstrate the legality and seriousness of
these issues. We are in no way suggesting any affiliation between Tactile and the events
or individuals covered in the indictment.

We were recently connected with a reputable industry insider who works closely with
lymphedema patients, distributors, and manufacturers. For the last several years, this
individual has been at the receiving end of mass communications sent by Tactile via
non-digital means.


These documents were addressed to and/or intended for clinics or physicians in the
individual’s wider territory. This source believes these documents were sent to him/her
erroneously. We believe these documents provide strong evidence suggesting
systemic misconduct at the hands of Tactile employee in providing pre-filled
prescriptions and pre-written medical necessity letters to physicians.


A partial list including multiple examples of these documents was shared with us and a
few are shown below personal information redacted by the source. We have further
redacted the full names of Tactile employees in these documents out of respect for their
privacy, leaving only their first initials visible. We present a few samples below to
facilitate discussion and to highlight the critical legal and regulatory risks that these
documents represent for both Tactile and the physicians.


One set of these documents starts with a cover letter specifically requesting for a
physician’s signature and asking the clinic to “Copy and Paste” a “draft
narrative” onto company letterhead. Note the first initial at the top right-hand corner—
an individual whose name we have redacted but can confirm is a Tactile employee (in
this case, a “Sales Support Representative”, others we have found are “Order Intake
Coordinators”). To reiterate, we believe this fax was intended to be sent to a physician
whose name has also been redacted.

The second page of that same fax shows this “draft narrative”—a pre-written letter on
the patient’s medical history, symptoms, and the medical necessity / rationale for
prescribing the Flexitouch pump. Note the empty space left in for the physician’s
signature. Recall from the cover letter that this document was faxed to a physician with
the express purpose of requesting the doctor’s signature on this letter pre-written by
Tactile staff.

It actually gets even worse. The next document is yet another cover letter faxed from
a Tactile employee and intended for a physician (name redacted). This time, however, it
precedes an actual prescription order for a Flexitouch device that is already filled
out (pre-filled, one might say) by a Tactile employee—the only thing empty is the
signature box for the physician. The cover letter itself even directly asks for the
physician’s signature, in all caps no less.

shown below. Notice again that the data and first initial of the Tactile rep match in both
documents.

Sound familiar?


To be clear, we fully acknowledge that we do not prove from these documents alone that
the physicians in these cases are not properly examining or reviewing the patients. In
fact, it might be perfectly reasonable to speculate that these practices were put into
place for the sake of prescriber convenience and time-efficiency. Presumably,
prescribers are also free to modify or disregard these documents if they so choose.


However, we ask readers to put this in context with the 70%+ denial rates from the RAC
audits—all of which related to medical necessity denials—to illustrate this may be a
systemic problem with serious risk to investors.


Consider again this snippet from the US DoJ website detailing its Arkansas pre-filled
prescription indictment:


(Again, note this is an example to demonstrate the legality and seriousness of these
issues. We are in no way suggesting any affiliation between Tactile and the events or
individuals covered in the Arkansas indictment.)


Now consider the fact pattern we have shown both in our current and previous report:


As demonstrated above, Tactile employees appear to be pre-filling prescriptions
that are sent to doctors for signature. Device, patient name, symptoms, and

medical necessity are all already listed.


Citing medical necessity, the RAC auditor Performant has denied over 70% of all
Tactile Medicare claims audited so far.


We do also want to acknowledge the issue of credibility here. While we are highly
confident in the source and the preservation / validity of these documents, readers may
express doubts about their veracity. Understandable.


Since we want to respect our source’s wish to remain anonymous, we can point you to
something else: a medical justification template sent by a Tactile rep to doctors at the
Dallas VA hospital we received via FOIA request.

Prescriber Concentration: More Questions on Tactile's Sales
and Marketing Activity


Source: VA FOIA Records, the original source document sent by the FOIA officer can be
found here (#4)


Though less direct than pre-filled prescriptions, the similarities in language (“Flexitouch
Plus… provides gentler pressures”, “…cannot tolerate the static compression…”) and
intent (“Copy and paste below here”) are hard to ignore. Readers looking to obtain these
records for themselves should request email correspondence between Tactile
employees and the Dallas VA hospital via FOIA.


We sent Tactile investor relations a full copy of our research for feedback and comment
but have not received a response regarding our finding on the apparent use of pre-filled
prescriptions at the company.


In mid-2018, Tracy Sempowich, the former regional manager of Tactile's Mid-Atlantic
region, filed a lawsuit alleging employment related gender discrimination. The case can
be found on Pacer under 5:18-cv-00488-D.


The most concerning items for us were the company's sales account data released
during the discovery process.


It turns out that as of 2017, more than 70% of all Flexitouch devices shipped came from
only 20% of clinics. Conversations with former and current executives at large national
insurers revealed that prescriber concentration is a key indicator that investigators look
for in uncovering potential problems. We walk through our findings below.


The order and shipment data by sales account (e.g. prescriber, clinic, etc.) for the Mid-
Atlantic sales region was released under Exhibit 7 of a recent discovery document filed
on Pacer:

The data includes ~20 pages totaling 458 accounts that shipped one or more Tactile
devices in the Mid-Atlantic region during 2017. A sample is provided below. We believe
each row refers to an account while 'CR12 Ship' refers to devices shipped in the then-
current period (2017) for that account.

We have sent Tactile investor relations a full copy of our research for feedback and
comment but have not received a response regarding the high prescriber concentration
levels we found at the company.


More still, buried in the lawsuit was yet another new reference to potential misbehavior
at the hands of sales staff at Tactile. The excerpt below is taken directly from an email
sent by the plaintiff, Tracy Sempowich, in February 2018 to Tactile's then HR manager
Wendy Watt:

Rapidly Emerging Competition

Source: Case 5:18-cv-00488-D, Document 46-3, Exhibit A033


We find all of this to be highly troubling for investors of the company. Between
the RAC audits, whistleblower lawsuit, Mrs. Sempowich's allegations above,
prescription documents, and the clear evidence of exorbitant prescriber
concentration... all roads seem to be leading to Rome.


Last but not least, we believe the market may not fully grasp the sheer extent to which
competition is intensifying in the PCD industry.


While the distributor side has always been highly fragmented, PCD manufacturing has
historically been dominated by a handful of key players: Tactile Systems, Bio
Compressions, Lympha Press, and 2018 entrant NormaTec.


Since December 2019, five new entrants have received 510(K) approval for PCD
devices - at least two of which were specifically approved using Tactile devices as the
predicate product to establish equivalency.


These new competitors are shown below from the FDA website:

We highlight a few in particular:


VariLymph 12 Pro (August 2020 Approval)


Product Website and Description: link


Developed by German medtech manufacturer SLK Medical GMBH. Varilymph is notable given the company's
high market share and strong presence in the European lymphedema treatment market. Note that Germany is
widely recognized as being at the cutting edge of lymphedema treatment and expertise. Varilymph's launch in
the US will be backed by publicly listed Apex Medical from Taiwan. Apex has existing distribution into wound
therapy clinics that have strong overlap with PCD.


https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K193476.pdf


Varilymph was approved against Lympha Press as the predicate device. Lympha Press is one of Tactile's
largest competitors for the Flexitouch product.

The Aria system is being launched by InovaLabs, an internal spin out from publicly traded ResMed. The
Aria device was approved against the Tactile Entre as its predicate device. Like Koya, the Aria pump looks to
iterate upon legacy technology by adding portability and connectivity features.


Medi USA (January 2019 Approval)


Though not highlighted in our earlier table, we note that Medi launched a competing PCD device, receiving
510-k approval in January 2019. Conversations with industry contacts suggest they are slow-playing
commercial launch in order to avoid reimbursement issues like Tactile.


Note in particular that Medi is an industry giant in traditional compression garments with an extremely strong
presence across all call points for lymphedema treatment and diagnosis.


Over the next few months, we believe the PCD industry will transform from a three-
player oligopoly to a highly competitive field contested by at least nine well-capitalized
competitors.


We believe many of these recent new entrants are in a strong position to take share
from Tactile - especially in light of Tactile's issues with its whistleblower lawsuit and
Medicare audits.

Instead of being a high-growth, disruptive player with a large and growing TAM, we think
Tactile is fighting for a smaller share in a shrinking pie - all while fighting off numerous
regulatory and legal disruptions as a result of the company's marketing practices.
Auditors, regulators, and competitors appear to be closing in. We believe investors
should think twice before investing in Tactile.
