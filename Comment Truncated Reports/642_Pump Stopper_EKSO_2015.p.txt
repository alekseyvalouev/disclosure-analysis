Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest,
Product Failure And Paid Stock Promotion

Summary


EKSO insider Adam Gottbetter jailed for fraud, while other EKSO individuals face
further allegations. SEC's FOIA shows EKSO facing (or faced?) law enforcement
investigation, where is EKSO's disclosure on this?


Boston Dynamics states "nothing to do with EKSO" and any work together
completed months ago, Lockhead states FORTIS "not an Ekso product" and
"independently designed" by LMT and Robrady.


Previously presented EKSO “Charter Clinics” now supporting competing products,
and stating competitor products are superior. Industry shift towards rental/lease
leaves under-capitalized EKSO in an impossible situation.


Huge global companies now competing with EKSO and demonstrably superior and
cheaper products. EKSO's founder left the company and founded competing
company with 1/3 the price and 1/2 the weight.


Accelerating cash burn, product failure and EKSO's financial architect jailed for fraud
as insiders register to sell stock with paid stock promotion make 35x sales and
~$200m valuation clearly unsustainable.


I believe EKSO is an offensive reverse-merger where insider and EKSO's financial
architect, responsible for temporarily dodging a 2013 EKSO bankruptcy, was recently
jailed for fraud. Furthermore, a SEC FOIA response received shows EKSO is facing, or
faced, a law enforcement investigation. I am shocked to find no EKSO disclosure, which
leaves investors in the dark about the extent of any potential issues or what is going on.

Industry research also shows EKSO is now nothing more than a "hype machine" with no
hope of commercial success. Multiple large global juggernauts have apparently displaced
EKSO at many of the company's past "Charter Clinics" as previous partners now tout
competitor's products as superior.


An analysis of all EKSO employees on LinkedIn show the company imploding internally as
key employees depart en-masse. Despite having just 69 full-time employees, in the past
few years, EKSO has churned through ~100 employees, with 2/3 of them not even lasting
past 1 year. Successful businesses about to rapidly grow sales do not have this kind of
attrition, leading me to believe EKSO's sales ramp is impossible.


With less than $6m of revenue and -$15m per year cash burn, EKSO will run out of cash
again in early 2016. EKSO's CEO Nathan Harding presided over near-bankruptcy in 2013
and was forced to stop paying approximately half of EKSO employees. The only
meaningful capital the company has been able to raise was done with partners now jailed
for fraud or charged with other violations. With those sketchy partners unavailable, when
EKSO's cash runs out in ~9 months, I expect the company's bankruptcy is likely. Given
everything above, EKSO's current ~$200m valuation, or >35x revenue, is clearly absurd
and I believe is only temporarily possible due to EKSO's >60% unsophisticated retail
shareholder base and EKSO's paid stock promotion. Supporting this view, EKSO insiders
have registered to sell stock.


I applaud any medical patients finding any relief from any offering anywhere, but from an
investor and financial standpoint EKSO is an obvious disaster that is imploding as we
speak. Generously valuing EKSO similar to peers shows imminent -84.51% downside with
more likely outcome of bankruptcy and total investor wipeout, similar to other Adam
Gottbetter deals and stocks using paid stock promotion (more below).


EKSO Insider and Financial Architect Adam Gottbetter Jailed for Fraud

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


Ironically named, Adam Gottbetter is the financial architect and creator of EKSO through
the reverse merger and financing which temporarily helped EKSO avoid bankruptcy in
2013 when EKSO ran out of cash and was forced to stop paying ~50% of its workforce.


Adam Gottbetter was an EKSO insider as we can see where he is listed as EKSO contact
person for this 11/2013 EKSO SEC filing. I believe that without Gottbetter, EKSO would
have clearly gone bankrupt in 2013 when EKSO basically ran out of money and had to
"pause" the company for nearly a year. Unfortunately for EKSO shareholders, Adam
Gottbetter recently pleads guilty to fraud and is serving time in jail, according to
thedeal.com:


"Investment bank Gottbetter Capital Markets LLC arranged at least 15 PIPEs from
2008 through May 2014, raising $96.1 million for companies including Ekso
Bionics Holdings Inc.……..The SEC action against Gottbetter included allegations
that he and others manipulated shares…"


Adam Gottbetter: Not Smiling Anymore…

You can find the SEC's press release here:


"The three rehearsed stories they would tell if ever questioned by law enforcement.
During one meeting in New York City, Gottbetter complained about the
difficulties of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the
only other way to make so much money so quickly."

Offensively, Adam seems to have used his gains to finance a lavish lifestyle, including a
$12.9 million Manhattan penthouse, complete with separate $1m living quarters for his
maid.


Gottbetter's playbook was simple: acting as attorney, he helped low-quality companies
with no hope of future success (like EKSO seems to be) go public via reverse-merger. His
firm Gottbetter Capital Markets provided necessary cash where Gottbetter would get a
piece of the action so he could, after promotional campaigns kicked in, dump his stock on
the market before it collapses worthlessly.


In an embarrassingly bad interview with disgraced stock tout Tobin Smith, Gottbetter took
the opportunity to promote Gran Tierra Energy (NYSEMKT:GTE) as one of the most
"successful deals he was ever involved in." Gran Tierra was later exposed by Barron's as
a hard glossy-mailer stock promotion campaign in which Gottbetter participated. Another
attorney in the Gran Tierra scandal was charged by the SEC for securities fraud and it
appears Gottbetter regularly partnered with individuals charged with penny stock
manipulation.


One of the broker dealers named alongside Gottbetter in the EKSO Form D is "EDI
Financial" which was recently censored by FINRA for allegedly making inappropriate
private placement investments while "Dinosaur Securities LLC" also participated with
Gottbetter and has also had many alleged disciplinary problems with FINRA. This
5/7/2014 S-1 filing shows EKSO insiders associated with Gottbetter registered to sell an
estimated 950,912 shares while on the other side of the trade (unsurprisingly) we find
62%+ of EKSO shares are held by unsophisticated retail investors. Does this seem fair to
you?


I believe it is obvious that EKSO management must know what is going on as the
company's CEO Nathan Harding co-signed SEC documents with Adam Gottbetter while
even a basic Google search shows numerous concerning allegations against Gottbetter
and associates going back to at least 2007. Why did Nathan Harding and EKSO willingly
choose to partner with Gottbetter, when they should have Knewbetter? Are these the kind
of people you should trust or give your hard-earned money to?


To decipher a pattern for EKSO, let's look at other Gottbetter deals:

EKSO Also Partnered with Opaleye's James Silverman, Who Faced Insider Trading
Charges


Shockingly, it's not just Gottbetter as James Silverman's Opaleye Management is EKSO's
second largest shareholder and has recently been attempting to sell EKSO stock.
Opaleye, previously known as "Risk Reward Capital", was apparently pursued for insider
trading by the Secretary of the State of Massachusetts who accused Silverman of using
an "expert network" to obtain inside information in a quest to improve dismal returns.


*Edit/update: I am told Silverman and Massachusettes settled their differences in an out-
of-court settlement


SEC filings show Silverman owns 10.9m shares of EKSO through Opaleye and Silverman
Insurance Partnership, making him one of EKSO's largest shareholders. In a March 25,
2015, securities registration, Silverman is listed as attempting to sell at least 2,000,000 (!!)
shares of EKSO stock which Silverman/Opaleye acquired in January 2014 directly, with
Gottbetter (from CapitalIQ):


"Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. announced a private placement on best efforts basis of
20,580,000 units at $1 per unit for gross proceeds of $20,580,000 on January 15,
2014. Each unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant.
Each warrant is exercisable at $2 per share for a period of five years. The
transaction included participation from Opaleye L.P, a fund managed by Opaleye
Management Inc., Montrose Capital Group, LLC, and other investors. Gottbetter
Capital Markets, LLC, acted as the exclusive placement agent for the best efforts
transaction and EDI Financial, Inc. acted as a sub-agent."


Interestingly, within months of Gottbetter's EKSO reverse merger, both Silverman and
Gottbetter filed to sell a large amount of stock in 5/2014. Curiously just prior to this, EKSO
stock "mysteriously" rallied dramatically for no apparent reason. Given charges of market
manipulation to people associated with EKSO, you can make your own speculations how
and why that happened. Regardless, we know one thing with certainty: EKSO insiders
were in a hurry to sell stock as EKSO worked with the SEC in an attempted acceleration
of its registration effective date:


Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc., hereby requests that the Securities and Exchange
Commission accelerate the effective date of the above-referenced Registration
Statement"

5/22/2018 Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest, Product Failure And Paid Stock Promotion - Ekso Bionics Holdings, In…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


EKSO's questionable insiders clearly missed that very brief "window" when EKSO stock
rallied as the original offering appears to have failed. Tellingly though, (see below),
insiders have once again filed to sell stock (at a much lower price) while EKSO stock has
more than doubled off the bottom, again for no apparent reason.


Unsurprisingly, Silverman and Gottbetter affiliates have again filed to sell a large amount
of EKSO stock in a March 2015 registration. Affiliates of Gottbetter also registered to sell
stock in this filing, although it's unclear what will happen to Gottbetter's EKSO stock now
that he's in jail, will it be dumped onto the market? If EKSO was such an amazing
opportunity why would insiders register to sell stock at $2 or lower?


SEC's FOIA Response: EKSO Subject of an Ongoing Law Enforcement
Investigation?


Given what we have seen above, I find this SEC FOIA response received last year to be
concerning.

We know FOIA 7(a) exemptions are used during active law enforcement investigations.
We also know, from the Gottbetter trial, that he received a lighter trial by supplying
additional information about his associates so we don't know how deep that investigation
is or who it may be targeting. Since EKSO has not disclosed any information about this, I
don't know what is going on exactly, but with EKSO's financial architect in jail sharing
information with federal authorities, along with all the other EKSO issues explained below,
I am very concerned.


The EKSO "HYPE MACHINE": Partnerships Overblown? and Paid Stock Promotion


Consistent with the Gottbetter playbook, EKSO claims vague "partnerships" with random
companies and uses paid stock promotion by the dubious offshore firm Edison whose
reports appear dressed up to look like real Wall Street research but fine print clarifies

seem to just be paid stock promotion:


(credit Edison "Research")


In this light I find interesting, EKSO's management consistently fails to disclose the
amount or extent of any partnership it gets while playing "fast and loose" with the facts.
For example, EKSO touts incessantly hype a Boston Dynamics relationship which
curiously had zero quotes from Boston Dynamics itself in the press release. It seems this
"partnership" was so important that it didn't even merit a single public statement by Boston
Dynamics.


Further research to Boston Dynamics resulted in the response "we have nothing to do with
that company" with an abrupt end to the conversation. A second email from Boston
Dynamics confirmed any relationship that ever existed ended months ago.


EKSO touts also repeatedly promote past work with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) but a
call to LMT confirmed FORTIS is "not an EKSO product" and "Fortis was independently
developed by Lockheed Martin with support from Robrady Design". Further research with
Robrady design also turns up zero mention of EKSO but instead states it was a Lockheed
Martin project which was apparently gone through "from the ground up". What is really
going on here? Until Lockheed Martin comes out with a public press release clarifying this,
I don't think any of us know what reality is.


Not that it even matters though as EKSO's SEC filings state after 2017 LMT will have
exclusive rights to the military market anyway, cutting EKSO off regardless, while there is
no hope of EKSO competing against a globally dominant manufacturing company like
LMT in any capacity. No wonder insiders want to cash out, who could blame them?


Lastly, on the Q4 call investors asked EKSO management for any color (at all?!) on the
latest claimed agreement with Ottobock. Unsurprisingly, EKSO management refused to
provide any color on the extent, financial terms or really anything at all and simply passed
over the question instead responding with vague and useless "validation" hype.

EKSO has also repeatedly fed investors false promises about its own future and
repeatedly missed its own goals. For instance, after originally saying EKSO would have a
home use personal product done by 2013, in this article EKSO stated in 2012 it would
have a personal mobility device by 2014. Then in this later article EKSO also stated again
and again it would have a personal EKSO in the market in 2014. Despite all this hype
about EKSO entering the home market, in EKSO SEC filings (where the consequences of
deception are much higher) EKSO states its "exploration of this potential market is in the
very early stages".


I believe this is likely because in the ReWalk (NASDAQ:RWLK) FDA disclosures we can
see that a consistent speed for 10m+ of 0.40 meters per second (a function of necessary
time to cross a street) as apparently critical. Unfortunately, the EKSO suit is just too weak
and clumsy to ever achieve this speed hurdle by the comfortable margin it seems is
necessary for FDA approval, effectively making FDA clearance for the home market an
impossibility for EKSO's suit.


The only financial details I can find on EKSO partnerships are that EKSO has generated
just ~$1m in total licensing revenue since inception, which is immaterial for a ~$200m
valued company. We also know if one customer is 10% of revenue, all public companies
are required by the SEC to disclose that. So if EKSO announces a partnership without
mention of financial terms and it is not disclosed in detail in SEC filings you can know that
it may be anywhere between $0 of revenue to 9.99% of revenue, which given EKSO's tiny
total revenue, is telling.


EKSO Technology Already Failing, With Superior Products and Global Juggernauts
Entering the Market


Claims EKSO has superior technology are not grounded in reality and are likely spread by
individuals who have not done extensive work talking to people who actually use products
in the market. Not only is EKSO years behind the curve but, now that a few small
companies have been "first man over the wall", large global juggernauts with superior
R&D teams and endless cash are entering the market with superior products. Even more
concerning, EKSO is attempting to spread its tiny R&D budget across multiple end
markets, making success against larger and more focused competitors impossible.


Obviously, if EKSO were such a promising company it would not have partnered with
jailed fraudster or almost gone bankrupt in 2013 or forced into a sketchy "last resort"
reverse merger with a strange penny stock shell. Any company, from Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to LMT, could have bought EKSO for pennies at

that point and (tellingly) they chose not to. I think EKSO was already behind the
technology curve back in 2013 due to financial stress. Once EKSO was forced to
effectively put the company on pause for nearly a year and stop paying employees, EKSO
effectively died forever at that point and, in this hyper competitive industry against better
funded global competitors, crushed any hope of future success.


With this in mind you should not find my following chart comparing the available
exoskeleton products surprising. This estimated chart was painstakingly built by talking to
multiple people in the industry and digging through countless presentations, and is
(unsurprisingly) not something you see in EKSO's paid "analyst reports".

I applaud anyone walking in these suits, but clearly RWLK technology is light years ahead
of EKSO's crude offering. We can see here RWLK technology has been capable of going
up and down stairs since at least 2011 and is the only suit approved for home use, having
been FDA approved almost a year ago now. This RWLK technology superiority is also
why RWLK was used by this inspirational patient to complete the London marathon as far
back as 2012.

Not only that but RWLK's product list price is $60k as far back as 2013, I don't need to
remind you this is nearly HALF of the price EKSO quotes for their device while RWLK's
device has ~125k different combinations of personal adjustments, making it far better
suited for individual ownership.


RWLK is clearly the leader in home use at the moment as its motors are the strongest and
the fastest walking speeds are clocked in this suit. Furthermore, RWLK uses Samina for
outsourced manufacturing which will allow it to scale while EKSO is trying to build its suits
itself in an old warehouse.


Most importantly, Parker Hannifin's (NYSE:PH) superior Indego product is coming to
market in a matter of months, and proves to be both vastly superior and years ahead of
anything else available. The lightweight modular design and financing options will allow it
to sweep the home market, while the balance sheet of Parker Hannifin and integrated FES
therapy will allow it to revolutionize the rehab market. Indego also had variable assist way
back in 2012, and RWLK has had partial assistance for a long time as well but EKSO
didn't announce this until 2013, with an egregious $20k cost!


For example, we can see below the Indego is thin enough to wear in a wheelchair
(GAME):

Indego also has no big bulky backpack to get in the way like the EKSO suit has.

Indego's FES functionality is even more revolutionary for the rehab market as Clare
Hartigan, MPT at Shepherd Center, elaborates:


"(Indego) Incorporating FES into gait is a huge advantage."


It's not just ReWalk and Indego though as there are literally dozens of companies out in
front of EKSO with superior products approved around the globe from Cyberdyne's HAL to
many others. Cyberdyne products have been tested in 200 rehab centers in Japan and
are in use both in Germany and the US already. Cyberdyne has sold over 350 units and is
just getting started where even the prototype was used to carry a paraplegic friend near
the top of Swiss Mountain Breithorn. While EKSO is controlled by buttons, Osurus literally
has skin implants that read your brain through your skin and nerve endings!

Meanwhile, Honda (NYSE:HMC) is already leasing 100 of its walking assistance
exoskeletons in Japan since 2013. With worker assistance devices in testing as well, and
devices already in trials in Chicago.


I could go on and on but you get the picture. The only positive thing I could find about
EKSO was that, due to its crude design and limited adjustments, in a rehab clinic setting it
is easy to get new patients into the suit fast because the adjustments are limited and
simple. Literally everything else is inferior from what I heard and can deduce. Once RWLK
rolls out variable assist and Indego rolls out with FES and other superior features and a
better sales team, there will be no reason for anyone to buy an EKSO suit.


Lastly, spinal cord injuries are already being cured with stem cells and that technology will
relentlessly improve in coming years. Owning EKSO is, in some ways, a bet against stem
cells and biotech innovation, which is not a bet any smart investor should make.

If you still honestly think EKSO is a technology leader just look at what Honda (Asimo
demo here) and Boston Dynamics' amazing Atlas humanoid robot are capable of. Then
watch EKSO's old, unimpressive technology and you will see why no company acquired
EKSO back in 2013 before it imploded the first time.


Previous EKSO "Charter Clinics" Now Support Competitors With Superior Products


As further evidence of EKSO failure, we see clinics EKSO previously stated were key
partners now endorsing competing products as superior. EKSO previously hyped on past
quarterly calls its top "Charter Centers" as key industry supporters, selecting who they felt
where the most important centers to work with to be supporters and champions for EKSO.

Unfortunately for EKSO, the majority of these centers are now endorsing competitor
products. Craig Hospital, CO for example was the clinic to take first delivery of the first
EKSO GT suit and was working with Berkeley Bionics and EKSO since at least 2011 but is
now a listed partner for Parker Hannifin with Indego.

We see Indego partners here, while Mount Sinai center uses RWLK for patients as does
Spaulding Rehab and TIRR Memorial. Furthermore, RWLK's multi-year head start means
RWLK is in 8 of the top 10 clinics in the US already.

Shepherd Center is widely regarded as the single best rehab center in America. It is one
of few centers to have used all three available exoskeletons and, tellingly, it is apparently
endorsing Indego, the Parker Hannifin product, as the best product available. Pardon the
long quote but this is an absolutely critical read:

"Shepherd Center has a world-class reputation in the field of rehabilitation and we
are proud they have chosen to support us in the commercialization of Indego,"
said Craig Maxwell, Vice President of Technology and Innovation for Parker.
"Shepherd Center is the only rehabilitation facility to have tested Indego and
the two other devices currently being marketed by other companies as
exoskeletons."


"We see distinct advantages in Indego, including its lightweight and modular
design that promotes independence," said Gary R. Ulicny, Ph.D, President and CEO
of Shepherd Center. "From a rehabilitation perspective, we applaud Indego's ability
to vary the degree of robotic assistance and the use of electrical stimulation
based on the user's level of function."


"the Center has concluded that Indego has the most promise as a device for both
rehabilitation and home use."


"Indego is the only robotic exoskeleton that can be worn by a person while in his or
her own wheelchair, as well as in a vehicle or even a restaurant booth," said Clare
Hartigan, a physical therapist at Shepherd Center who leads the clinical research.
"The device can be used for mobility on all surfaces, including stairs."


"We are impressed with how easy Indego is for people to use, as well as its
potential to provide compensatory gait for those with motor complete injuries, in
addition to its rehabilitative potential for those who are motor incomplete," Hartigan
said. "The level of independence Indego offers is unprecedented."


The most shocking aspect of all of this is that the Paker Hannifin Indego product hasn't
even been formally released to the market fully yet. It is hitting Europe this summer and
should be for sale in US shortly after. As this marketing effort and financing (or rental)
terms become formalized this momentum is only expected to increase, and will be
devastating for EKSO has inferior technology and who does not have the cash flow
necessary to support a rental/lease program.


EKSO Industrial Push: Thinly Veiled Desperation and Failure


I believe it is clear EKSO's pending failure in the rehab market and irrelevance in the
personal/home market are why EKSO is now desperately touting the industrial market.
Unfortunately, here EKSO is also irrelevant and years behind the curve while competing
with impossibly sophisticated and capitalized global manufacturing juggernauts.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3229696-ekso-bionics-strong-sell-with-minus-92_3-percent-downside-on-fraud-arrest-product-failure-and-paid-stock-promotion


In this space it seems we are now seeing products from Panasonic, Boeing (NYSE:BA),
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), Honda, Daewoo and Cyberdyne, among many others entering
the able-bodied markets. EKSO has zero hope of success against companies like this.


Panasonic's "Powerloader" for example will be sold at $5k and take 30 seconds to put on.
Raytheon just spun out SARCOS, which just got jump started with serious board members
and VC backing with obviously superior products here, here and here while the military
has stated it is now building its own purpose build Navy device anyway. This whole shift is
behind the curve in my view anyway, as helping people hold heavy grinders misses the
true mega-trend of robotic manufacturing replacing humans entirely.


Note that EKSO didn't announce its own passive exoskeleton for construction until
12/2014. If the previously touted LMT relationship was going so well why would EKSO do
this? Why would EKSO now try to compete with its own partners? Do you honestly believe
tiny, underfunded EKSO can out-manufacture Honda, Panasonic, Boeing and Daewoo??


If I need to expand on this later I can, but this will obviously never be a viable business for
EKSO and, in my view, is clearly a desperate attempt to have something it can hype to
keep the stock from continuing its collapse.


As I look into my time machine I can predict how it seems the disastrous 2015 EKSO
movie will play out. I expect into Q4-2015 and especially Q1-2016 EKSO's business will
start to nose over bad and failure will be impossible to ignore. At that point, as cash burn
accelerates and EKSO becomes increasingly desperate, I believe we need to be wary of
increasingly promotional and worthless press releases about vague "partnerships" and
even tiny amounts of unprofitable commercial end market revenue. We know EKSO will
require cash to survive sometime in Q1 2016 which means it will likely attempt to raise
cash in Q4 2015. Since EKSO failed at this last time, I think it will fail again.


EKSO Previous "Go To Market" Strategy Failed and EKSO Facing Impossible Market
Dynamics


Even worse, there are tectonic shifts occurring right now in the exo skeleton market,
unrelated to technology, which will destroy EKSO.


Tellingly, this last quarter we saw EKSO announce it is shifting its sales strategy towards
renting suits. What EKSO investors are missing is this dynamic creates insurmountable
balance sheet and cash flow issues for EKSO while also demonstrating customers don't
see the value proposition that justifies an outright purchase.

The key issue is if a clinic rents or leases a suit, EKSO is forced to pay cash for the suit up
front and hold it in inventory or as an asset. Each one of these suits costs EKSO at least
$60k+ of cash up front and as EKSO's operating cash burn is also set to accelerate, will
pull forward EKSO's inevitable demise and cash requirement. This working capital
dynamic is absolutely critical, as I estimate every 15 suits EKSO tries to rent or lease will
require ~$1m of cash use off its balance sheet in addition to -$1.5m per month operating
cash burn.


Furthermore, no off balance sheet debt financing partner will finance this. EKSO's suits
are rapidly changing and its future value is impossible to ascertain. Furthermore, without
EKSO support and maintenance (which would disappear in bankruptcy) those suits are
essentially worthless, while EKSO lack of earnings or cash flow certainly cannot support
any level of debt.


This is A KEY ADVANTAGE Parker Hannifin has, which is Parker Hannifin can finance
suits off its own balance sheet nearly for free with the $2b+ cash Parker has on hand.
Furthermore, RWLK is a much more focused company with ~$40m in cash (nearly twice
the cash balance of EKSO). This means EKSO is the financially weakest player in the
market who is too underfunded to compete and left in an untenable position that cannot be
sustained, especially as increased industry competition begins to compress pricing and
drive revenue/asp declines.


All of this ignores the fact EKSO is trying to simultaneously work on the very different
military, commercial, rehab and individual/home markets all simultaneously. This is also
clearly impossible and spreading a very small and vulnerable company far too thin. Given
poor management quality at EKSO, I don't find this surprising, and given EKSO's previous
go to market strategy seems to have failed, I sense a repeating pattern set to occur.


EKSO Creator Left: Started A Competitor With Superior Products


Undisputed robotics genius Professor Kazerooni was the original founder of EKSO and
the one who seems responsible for its technology. He left EKSO and seems to have
founded a competing exoskeleton company called US Bionics which has a product
coming to market priced at just $15k while looking very effective, lightweight and thin
enough to be worn in a wheelchair which Japanese manufacturers apparently already
want.

Just to remind you, Kazerooni was the godfather of EKSO and I believe the one
responsible for essentially all of EKSO's foundational technology with over 40 patents to
his name personally. He built the Berkley Bionics lab from the ground up and put together
the team there so very telling I believe that his out and gunning for EKSO now.


If I was going to invest in anything in this space I would invest in US Bionics and genius
Kazerooni who, along with ReWalk and Vanderbuilt, are the only people in exo-bionics
with a track record of success. The people left in charge of EKSO are a mere shadow of
the original team and if EKSO was such an amazing opportunity with an atmosphere of
innovation why didn't Kazerooni stay and develop his products inside EKSO?


EKSO Imploding Internally, Employees Flee En-Masse As Cash Burn Accelerates


Management of companies burning through tens of millions of dollars and on the edge of
insolvency often blather unrealistic hype. What they often don't discuss is reality.


I believe EKSO's own employees show us that EKSO is imploding internally. Despite only
69 full time employees, I estimate that EKSO has churned through nearly 100 employees
in just the past few years. Of these employees we can see the average tenure is
estimated at just ~1.5 years!

(chart created by me with public Linkedin Profile info)


Key positions across all EKSO departments including head of sales, marketing,
engineering and operations have all experienced shocking levels of turnover with key
people leaving in droves. I don't see how a company in such turmoil could possibly be a
successful, happy work environment driving innovation or effective sales strategies.
EKSO's former VP of Marketing and COO recently both departed for competitor LIM
Innovations while Glenn Davis, a highly qualified senior executive from Siemens left
EKSO in less than a year.

How can you have a marketing ramp if the Vice President of Marketing, Vice President
America's, COO, and Director of EMEA all recently left as the company experiences
staggering turn over?


EKSO has had three CEOs just since 2010 as well, from Bruce Borup to Eythor Bender
and now Nathan Harding, who has the least management experience of any of them and
presided over partnerships with convicted fraudster Gottbetter as well as coming within an
inch of bankruptcy. I have less than zero faith in his competence and assume that is why
EKSO previously had outside CEOs.


It should be clear to others as well. In March of 2014, EKSO claimed it was at a "key point
of growth" even though it furloughed nearly 50% of its workforce in 2013 and then showed
virtually flat revenue growth throughout 2014 at less than $6 million of sales.


Also concerning, EKSO has told investors in its 10-K filing it plans to hire 15-20 more
employees in the next few months but if you look at the "Careers" section of the EKSO
website you will find zero sales positions listed and the page hasn't been updated properly
in awhile.


Furthermore, EKSO's current manufacturing capacity is tiny at best and I see no
production positions being hired for either? I estimate EKSO's current plant and employee
annual manufacturing capacity at just a handful of units per year anyway and, best I can
tell, EKSO has never clarified exactly what its current plant and staff annual manufacturing
capacity anyway? EKSO management have dodged this question anytime it has been
raised, which is a huge red flag in my view, and if I were them I would do what superior
peer company RWLK did and fire the entire manufacturing team and outsource production
immediately.


EKSO Conflicted Wall Street "Analyst" Models Are Mathematically Impossible


As we've seen with UNIS, NEON, ARNA, KEYW, IWSY and countless cash-burning
worthless disasters, the lowest quality Wall Street banks are often blinded by the greed of
banking fees. This typically results in what investors call a "Sell Side Promotion" where
impossible "estimates" are put forth by bottom tier Wall Street banks in a fight to see who
can be most bullish to curry favor from garbage company management teams and secure
capital raise fees.


I think EKSO is one of the worst examples of this I've seen. Let's take classic "bank"
Ladenburg for example and review the steaming garbage they try to pass off as a financial
model.

(credit Ladenburg)


Ignoring the apparently delusional sales estimates, hilariously, Ladenburg's price target
assumes zero dilution and completely misses the working capital and cash dynamics
explained above.


If EKSO were really going to sell suits on the level Ladenburg fantasizes about, we can
run some simple math and see that would require EKSO to raise $252m+ of capital just for
inventory and working capital needs! Given EKSO's lack of fraud partner and $185m
market cap, these cash needs are obviously impossible. Just factoring in the necessary
dilution alone and using Ladenburg's own price target results in a stock price below
today's price… doesn't Ladenburg understand basic math?


Another absurd thing I want to point out is Ladenburg are forecasting ASP will actually
INCREASE into infinity by +4%. As we have seen, competition is increasing dramatically
and EKSO is already overpriced relative to competitive offerings while the company itself
has stated it will try and reduce pricing in the future. As we all know, for technology
adoption to occur, prices decrease, and we are already seeing that literally right now in the
bionics markets.


No real investor is going to buy this garbage and I find it offensive.

5/22/2018 Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest, Product Failure And Paid Stock Promotion - Ekso Bionics Holdings, In…

EKSO previously had -$1.3m of monthly cash burn and is guiding to increased hiring while
none of its commentary includes the increasing cash use the new exoskeleton lease/rental
dynamic will require. In 2014 alone we see EKSO lost -$33.7m and, given the above
dynamics we understand now, we can be sure that number is set to increase. Since EKSO
only has ~$20m in cash, we can see its previous guidance of survival until q2 2016 is no
longer realistic and EKSO will be forced to try and raise more cash much sooner.


Meanwhile EKSO Insiders Pillaging The Company For Millions, Shareholders Get
Destroyed by Dilution


Now that we understand EKSO is a financial disaster, created by jailed fraudster
Gottbetter and with no hope of commercial success, what are EKSO insiders doing with
this worthless mess?


(chart built by me)


Note that insider compensation in 2014 is 300% higher than 2013 and total compensation
is nearly what EKSO total 2014 revenue was. How have EKSO insiders and jailed
financing partner afforded these egregious payments? By absolutely pillaging their
shareholders with an unbelievable amount of dilution.

This is a crippling and unsustainable path of shareholder destruction and given everything
we've seen here, I'm not surprised EKSO could only raise money with the help of a jailed
fraudster and alleged stock price manipulator.


EKSO Cash Burn Increasing, Bankruptcy Inevitable, RWLK Clearly A Superior
Choice for Speculation


If you must speculate on exoskeleton stocks, EKSO seems clearly the "worst of the
worst". RWLK is a "real company" with credible management, has more product revenue,
more market share, is already FDA approved in both home and clinic, has vastly superior
technology with a cheaper exo product and is also a cheaper stock given lower $150m
market cap with ~$40m in cash, nearly twice the cash EKSO has.


Furthermore, RWLK is covered by real banks like Barclays and Jefferies, which coupled
with a real product and real management means it is much better equipped to raise
capital. Compare this to EKSO which is intertwined with countless people facing fraud and
other allegations and is surrounded by "Banks" like Ladenburg and HC Wainwright.


RWLK has "real", sophisticated, institutional investors supporting the company like
Yaskawa Electric and Israel Healthcare while EKSO is largely owned by unsophisticated
retail investors and a guy jailed for fraud.


For all these reasons and more, I believe it is obvious why RWLK had a "real" IPO
supported by real banks while EKSO was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, with
workers furloughed, and forced into a sketchy backdoor reverse-merger while partnering
with a jailed fraudster.

If you insist on speculating in small, longshot, bionics companies then RWLK is obviously
a better choice and the cheaper stock. If you prefer venture capital or private businesses
then US bionics created by the individual responsible for EKSO's original technology is far
more exciting with a much higher chance of success.


EKSO Management Non-Response:


Repeated attempts to contact EKSO management in order to clarify the serious issues
discusses went unanswered. Furthermore, there appears to be zero way for EKSO
stockholders to contact the company they own directly. I view this lack of transparency
and shareholder communication to be a huge red flag and urge all EKSO stockholders to
directly contact the management team that is in charge of THEIR company immediately.
Furthermore, I look forward to public clarification of the many issues at play here as I am
very concerned.


EKSO Valuation


EKSO's temporarily stretched valuation of 35x revenue is clearly unsustainable and
absurd. I believe this crazy valuation is only possible due to paid stock promotion and
confused retail investors. Note EKSO is a manufacturing, medical equipment company
which is attempting to produce mechanical equipment in a Richmond warehouse, which is
both capital intensive, working capital intensive and not scalable. This is not a software or
biotech company that will have huge margins and can grow overnight.


Even hyper growth medical equipment companies with extremely bullish futures are
typically valued at ~5x revenue. I think EKSO is clearly a financial disaster and likely to go
bankrupt, but in the interest of being optimistic let's assume EKSO is worth what high
quality, growing peer medical-equipment companies are valued at.

(chart built by me)


As you can see, even in a "best case" scenario EKSO stock has -84.53% downside right
now. However, I think there is a good chance EKSO's coming capital raise fails and EKSO
just goes bankrupt in less than 12 months, leaving the stock worthless.

CONCLUSION: EKSO Is Clearly Fundamentally Worthless and Imploding


Any medical patient finding relief or making progress is a brave individual who gets
nothing but respect from me and this research has nothing to do with any of you out there.
I want to see injured people walk freely more than anyone and some of the companies in
this space will make great strides in the future to help people.


This is why I find EKSO with its fraud partnership, paid stock promotion and unrealistic
hype to be offensive and distasteful - it is destroying capital at the expense of real
companies doing excellent work in the exo-bionics field, and that hurt's all of us. I believe it
is obvious now that a sketchy reverse-merger led by people jailed for fraud and facing
other allegations, who enrich themselves to the tune of millions, while spending minimal
cash on R&D, are not going to be the ones to cure the world's problems.


The kind of true institutional investors required to feed EKSO's $15-20m+ cash burn
needs are going to require more than misleading "partnership" press releases and paid
stock promotion. It will require real revenue and earnings, neither of which EKSO is
capable of generating. This is why EKSO was on "death's door" in 2013, why nobody
bought it outright when it almost disappeared and why EKSO has never successfully
raised large-scale capital aside from when it partnered with jailed fraudster Gottbetter.
Now that he is in prison and unable to finagle money from questionable investment firms
