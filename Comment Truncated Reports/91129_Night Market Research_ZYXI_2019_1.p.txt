ZYXI


Zynex shares are up ~100x since late 2016 as retail investors buy into a story of
rapid revenue and earnings growth.


However, we believe Zynex is dependent on an abusive pricing strategy - reselling
regular consumer batteries and electrodes at ~90% margins.


Even slightly lower margins on these commodities would eliminate net income,
suggesting how vulnerable the stock is here.


We find it difficult to back into Zynex’s stated revenue per device.


We've reported our concerns to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
private insurers, and publications.

On the surface, Zynex’s (NASDAQ:ZYXI) model of selling electrical stimulation devices
and supplies at high margins with technically little direct competition appears to be an
attractive opportunity. However, the company’s revenues reveal a business model
increasingly vulnerable to competition and/or regulatory scrutiny. We don’t know of
another public medical device company generating the vast majority of its revenue by
reselling non-proprietary consumables (simple 9-volt batteries and electrodes in this
case) at egregious ~90% margins. And after looking at the implied dollar amounts of
supplies sold per device, we find it difficult to come up with scenarios in which Zynex
isn’t engaged in overly aggressive and/or abusive pricing. In our opinion, the model is
unsustainable and a major risk unaccounted for in Zynex’s premium valuation.


Specifically, we calculate that, on each device, Zynex is collecting an average of $1,200
for non-proprietary batteries and electrodes, over the average 6 to 9-month life of a
device. Using the standard Medicare fee schedule and allowing for higher rates from
commercial insurers, we can't approximate this figure.


We notified Zynex of our concern that its billing practices are abusive as the company is
overcharging healthcare payers for device supplies. We asked for comment and also for
detail regarding its reimbursement levels, but have not heard back. Since we believe
Zynex is a prime example of potential waste and abuse contributing to rising costs in our
healthcare system, we’ve reported our findings and questions to numerous groups and
press outlets, including: members of US Senate Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions; US Department of Health and Human Services; Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); commercial insurers, including CVS (CVS),
Cigna (CI), Anthem (ANTM), UnitedHealthcare (UNH); and publications such as Wall
Street Journal and Bloomberg. We alerted the Office of Inspector General (OIG), which
has investigated and found wrongdoing at other TENS device companies, RS Medical
and Empi. Below is a screenshot of part of our complaint to the OIG.

Background


Source: Office of Inspector General


Zynex was founded in 1996 by current CEO Thomas Sandgaard. In 1999, Zynex began
selling its first generation electrotherapy device for pain. In 2004, the company became
public by reverse merging into OTC listed Fox River Holdings. Earlier this year, the stock
was uplisted to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Current outstanding share count is 34M, of
which 1.5M are options with strike prices below $1. Sandgaard owns around half of the
outstanding shares.

The NexWave Device: Old Technology


Zynex primarily markets NexWave, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
device indicated for the management of chronic intractable pain, post-traumatic and
post-surgical pain. Zynex also sells InWave for incontinence and NeuroMove for stroke
rehabilitation, but sales of both are insignificant. The company’s “pipeline” consists of a
blood volume monitor called CM-1500, for which an application for approval was filed in
2015. However, the FDA has repeatedly asked for additional information and data.
Given the apparent lack of progress, we believe approval is unlikely in the medium term.


The use of electricity to treat pain isn’t new. Early electrical devices include the Electreat
from the 1920s. Modern TENS technology, in use since the 1970s, operates on the
same basic principle of applying electricity to areas of pain via percutaneous electrodes.
Today’s devices allow users to adjust the intensity, frequency, and duration of the
electricity according to their preferences.

TENS Manufacturers Exit Business


TENS devices are available by prescription and over-the-counter, although whether or
not there are meaningful differences between the two categories is unclear. We spoke
with the head of a large TENS manufacturer (OTC and Rx units) who said prescription
devices give users more control over the electrical signals, but otherwise, the
differences were minimal. Evidence supporting TENS efficacy is mixed and inconclusive
mainly due to a lack of randomized controlled trials.


NexWave received FDA approval in 2011. In addition to TENS, the device also offers
Interferential Current (IFC) and Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) modalities
which essentially deliver the same electricity at different power levels and formats. While
the use of TENS is covered by most insurers, IFC and NMES are usually considered
experimental and thus won’t be reimbursed.


Patients in the market for a TENS device have an abundance of options: FDA lists
around 75 approved units and dozens of over-the-counter options are available on
Amazon. Zynex’s CEO claims NexWave is the “best” device, but we are unaware of any
clinical comparison study. It’s noteworthy that Zynex doesn’t hold any patents for
NexWave, likely because it’s based on technology that is several decades old.

Zynex has been a micro-cap for most of its existence as a public company. While it was
able to generate profits for several years, cash management was a recurring issue, and
Zynex eventually found itself in default of a $4M line of credit by 2014 (10-K, page 12).

Inflection Point?


Then, Zynex’s two largest competitors mostly left the market. RS Medical and Empi
were generating around $150M of revenue each. RS was under investigation by the
Department of Justice for fraudulently submitting claims to Medicare, eventually paying
a settlement of $1.2M in 2013. RS still markets TENS devices, but apparently, only
through the Department of Veterans Affairs and on a much smaller scale (Sandgaard
estimated RS’ current TENS revenue at $5M).


Empi was also under investigation, accused of selling “unjustifiably large quantities” of
TENS electrodes to TRICARE beneficiaries “with a particularly steep increase in the
number of beneficiaries receiving unnecessary quantities in 2014-2015.” Its parent
company DJO decided to exit the Empi business in 2015 due to a “challenging
regulatory and reimbursement environment.” DJO paid $7.2M to settle the issue in
2018.


Perhaps lifted by the exit of Empi and curtailment of RS Medical, Zynex’s sales
stabilized in 2016. In 2017, revenues increased by 75% with relatively flat SG&A
allowing the company to post its first significant annual profit in five years. Net income
for the year was $7.4M or $0.23 per share. Last year, Zynex posted sales and EPS
growth of 36% and 22%, respectively.


Normally, when large competitors exit a business, it signals opportunity, assuming the
sector is fundamentally viable. DJO parent Empi stated otherwise when it announced
closure of Empi in 2015: “Empi business has created a major revenue and EBITDA
headwind for the entire company for the last 4 years.” We don’t think it’s a coincidence
that both RS Medical and Empi left just a few years after Medicare’s Competitive
Bidding Program (CBP) was instituted in 2011. Between 2015 and 2017, reimbursement
rates for TENS devices were cut from roughly $400 to $70 as a result of the CBP.
Commercial insurers would’ve altered coverage as well. So, it’s not surprising RS and
Empi left the sector. Also, the fact that no other companies have aggressively stepped in
to fill the void (besides Zynex) makes the idea of an unfavorable TENS market even
more believable. In 2014, Zynex itself noted how difficult the TENS business was
becoming due to the impact of Medicare reform, highlighting that, in 2012, Medicare
ended coverage for TENS for lower back pain, and “continued increasing the paperwork
and documentation requirements for reimbursement”.

Sandgaard attributed the apparent turnaround to the loss of competition and increased
billing and collection efficiencies. However, the financial statements reveal a curious
shift in the composition of Zynex revenues around this time. Zynex breaks out revenues
into two line-items: devices and supplies. The device line includes NexWave sales. The
supplies line includes the 9-volt battery that powers NexWave and the electrodes users
attach to their skin. Between 2009 and 2016, supplies as a percentage of revenues
averaged 39%. Then, beginning in 2017, supplies suddenly accounted for 80% of
revenues and has remained at those levels since.


Source: Company filings


The batteries and electrodes sold by Zynex are not proprietary to NexWave. Zynex
simply orders 9-volt alkaline batteries and cloth electrodes from outside manufacturers,
who produce these commodities as “private-label” products with Zynex packaging.
Otherwise, there is nothing unique about the batteries or electrodes (the electrodes are
manufactured by Axelgaard).

Reselling Batteries and Electrodes at 90% Margins


Zynex’s overall gross margins have been above 80% since 2017. In its 2018 initiation
report, B Riley/FBR noted NexWave and supplies had gross margins of 70-75% and
90%, respectively. So, Zynex is capturing ~90% margins on 80% of its revenues for
simply reselling standard batteries and electrodes.


We estimate that Zynex is being reimbursed over $6.50 per battery and $12.50 per pair
of electrodes (we expand on the math later in the report), which is far above prices at
internet retailers. Zynex is essentially conducting an arbitrage between its suppliers and
price insensitive (for now) insurers. We were curious if any other medical device
companies generated most of their revenues from a similar reselling strategy, so we
looked at all 90 companies in the “Medical Appliances and Equipment” industry on
Finviz. We didn't find any that do. Not only that, but most if not all of them are
developing or at least claiming to be developing new and/or patented technologies
unlike Zynex and NexWave.

Reimbursement Math Doesn’t Add Up


Source: Company website, Amazon batteries and electrodes listings


How does Zynex “arbitrage” its generic supplies manufacturers and private and public
payers? We back into potential reimbursed amounts and methods using Medicare rates
and company data.


In its latest investor presentation, Zynex notes the average reimbursement rate on each
NexWave device is $1,500. According to the company, patients use NexWave for an
average of six to nine months. Recall 80% of revenues now comes from supplies, so
roughly $300 is collected for the device and $1,200 from supplies over the course of six
to nine months, on average. We dug through Medicare and commercial insurance billing
information, and we can’t figure out how Zynex collects so much on its supplies without
using an “aggressive” claims strategy on Medicare and/or commercial insurers.

TENS devices are classified as Durable Medical Equipment (DME) by CMS which
assigns Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes and
reimbursement fees for every DME covered by Medicare. The codes aid in billing
standardization and data collection. Private insurers also use the HCPCS codes,
although they aren’t bound by CMS’ fees. The TENS category includes the codes below
(a few other codes are less commonly used so we’ll ignore them). The first two codes
are for the device itself, the bottom three for supplies:


Source: CMS


The prescription and billing process is simple. After a doctor prescribes NexWave,
Zynex verifies Medicare/insurance. Once coverage is confirmed Zynex ships NexWave
to the patient, sets up monthly recurring shipments of supplies and begins billing
insurance using the above codes. Zynex customer service told us patients will typically
either receive two or four 9-volt batteries per month (NexWave is powered by one 9-volt
battery) and two or four packs of electrodes (four per pack).


Medicare and private payers have strict guidelines for how TENS is covered. The
patient has to experience chronic (lasting over 3 months) rather than acute pain. In most
of the cases that we’ve seen, insurers will initially only approve TENS for a two-month
trial period. After the trial, purchase may be approved if the physician states TENS was
effective and further treatment is appropriate.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4297802-zynex-abusive-pricing-model-unsustainable?source=all_articles_title 11/17


For the first two months, Zynex can typically bill insurance using either of HCPCS codes
E0720 or E0730 (with a modifier denoting the device is “rented”). If Zynex initially bills
using the E0730 code for a 4-lead TENS, insurers will typically allow reimbursement for
two “units” of A4595 per month (vs one for E0720) - so Zynex is incentivized to use
E0730. Batteries and electrode supplies are included in the E0730 rental fee. Starting in
the third month, Zynex can again bill with E0730 for the “purchase” and also start billing
for monthly supplies. From our understanding, the purchase price is reimbursed at the
same rate as the rental.


For supplies, Zynex should be using code A4595 which includes one month of supplies
for a 2-lead TENS unit. We believe this includes two batteries and two 4-packs of
electrodes. Medicare won’t allow claims using the A4630 and A4556 codes since A4595
already includes batteries and electrodes. That’s unfortunate for Zynex as the rates on
each are significantly higher in A4630 and A4556. Two “units” of A4595 would be
reimbursed at $20, while the same supplies using separate codes would equal $126.


Recall that Zynex says it collects around $1,500 per device, which implies $1,200 for
supplies. If we use the CMS fees, Zynex collects nowhere near that amount as shown
below. Note the below figure is using an approximate device reimbursement rate.
Depending on where a patient lives can skew E0730 rates higher. For instance, rates for
rural areas are higher than non-rural areas, which may account for the difference in our
device total of $210 compared to Zynex’s implied total of $300.

Lack of Competitors – Red Flag?


So, Zynex must be collecting more than standard Medicare reimbursement rates for
supplies. It’s possible they are billing commercial insurance at much higher rates, maybe
by “unbundling” code A4595 into separate A4630 and A4556:


Note that “unbundling” is generally considered waste or abuse by insurers. But even
assuming Zynex unbundles batteries and electrodes codes, we can’t get to $1,200 for
supplies or $1,500 total in our hypothetical scenario.


It’s possible that private payer rates are higher than public rates, although in many
cases, commercial insurers base their reimbursement rates off of Medicare. It would be
surprising if private rates were so much higher (over five times higher in this case),
especially for a category like TENS, given its widespread usage and dated technology.
We’d be very interested to see exactly how Zynex manages to collect $1,200 on its
supplies, because the numbers don’t seem to add up.

That no other public medical device company operates with a similar high margin
reseller model for the overwhelming majority of its revenues should prompt questions
from Zynex shareholders – and it could also draw the attention of regulators. As we
discussed above, no other public company has stepped into the TENS sector since RS
Medical and Empi essentially left despite what Zynex would like investors to believe is a
normally functioning market with up to 90% gross margins. This doesn’t make sense, in
our opinion.


Zynex and the sell-side analysts who cover the company are portraying the model as
the fabled “razor-razorblade” in which a primary product is sold inexpensively to lock
consumers into purchasing high margin consumables on a recurring basis. However,
unlike the consumer market for razor blades, the payer market for TENS supplies isn’t
free. It’s at least partially government mandated with prices set by healthcare
bureaucracies with a goal of supporting public interests.


How sustainable is a business model that resells commodity products for 10x retail
prices, especially to a healthcare system increasingly focused on reducing costs?
Bullish investors might point to payer inefficiencies being commonplace and that Zynex
is merely exploiting the system. We acknowledge there is no shortage of controversial
pricing examples in healthcare, but from what we’ve seen, other examples involve at
least some level of innovation – they don’t involve companies essentially acting as a
distributor of generic, household supplies.


And despite what bulls claim, there are no significant barriers to entry here. TENS
technology is old, cheap and non-patented. The ability to bill and collect from insurance
companies isn’t a moat. If Zynex is in fact billing properly, we would expect competition
to enter the space soon, pressuring margins. More companies exploiting this pricing
inefficiency would increase the chances of insurance companies and government
agencies re-examining reimbursement rates.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4297802-zynex-abusive-pricing-model-unsustainable?source=all_articles_title 14/17


Valuation Doesn’t Account for Risk


Why has this pricing situation persisted since at least 2017? It's improbable that Zynex
has the exclusive ability to source incredibly cheap batteries and electrodes and sole
access to a captive market of commercial insurers. More likely is that insurance
companies don’t realize they’re reimbursing for everyday 9-volt alkaline batteries rather
than batteries proprietary to NexWave. Or maybe the dollar amounts have remained
small enough to this point and thus haven’t triggered scrutiny. This year, Zynex is
expected to generate over $30M in supplies revenue (up 25% y-o-y). As absolute
reimbursement levels grow, so does the probability of payers re-examining
reimbursement policy, in our opinion.


We’ve reached out to CFO Dan Moorhead with our concerns and questions but have yet
to hear back.


Despite the risks inherent in Zynex, the company’s market capitalization has soared 70x
in the past 2 years. Overvaluation may be a reason why institutional ownership is only
12% and almost entirely made up of index trackers (stock was added to the Russell
2000 in July 2019). Extended valuation might also be a reason why Sandgaard recently
registered his 16.7M shares for potential sale. Since the filing, he’s sold around 300K
shares, 100K of which were sold this month.


For reasons discussed – regulator and payer scrutiny, potential competition - it’s unlikely
Zynex’s pricing anomaly can persist for much longer and we don’t think the stock’s
valuation is properly accounting for this risk as it’s currently trading at 10x EV/Sales and
40x EPS, multiples far above the average levels of medical equipment peer group
companies as shown below:

Source: Company filings, analyst reports


If Zynex were valued at average multiples, the implied downside in the stock would be in
the 30-50% range. However, we believe Zynex should trade at a discount to peers,
given the risk in its egregious pricing model. Consider that if insurance companies
were to begin reimbursing for NexWave supplies at lower levels, yet still allowing
Zynex to collect 2x what they paid for batteries and electrodes (50% gross
margins), the company would no longer be profitable.


Source: Sell-side analysts and our estimates


Even the slightest hint of Medicare or private insurers pushing back on Zynex’s current
reimbursement rates would re-price shares at the lower-end of peer multiples, in our
opinion. This would equate to prices in the $3-6 range or downside of 50-80%.

Given what we believe is an overly aggressive and/or potentially abusive pricing model
based on overcharging insurance companies for generic products, we think Zynex
shares are uninvestible and vulnerable to a significant repricing. Even if we are wrong,
and Zynex billing practices are industry standard and sustainable, competition would
enter the TENS market given the ~90% gross margins on supplies, cutting profitability.
Due to the egregious level of the overpricing during a time of increased focus on rising
healthcare costs, we would not be surprised to see insurance companies begin to
examine their reimbursement rates to Zynex in the near term.
