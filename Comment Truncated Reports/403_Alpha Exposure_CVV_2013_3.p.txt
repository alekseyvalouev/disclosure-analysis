CVD Equipment - Exposing The Truth On The Graphene Hype

As we stated in our first article (here), we don't believe that CVD Equipment
(NASDAQ:CVV) has unique capabilities in graphene. Instead, investors should look past
the graphene hype and focus instead on CVD's rapidly declining backlog, revenues, and
profitability in order to value the company. Interestingly, CVD Equipment came out and
essentially corroborated our claims in a press release (here), and that is just one of the
many reasons we believe CVD is a compelling short and have a price target of $5.


Nevertheless, we wanted to share our extensive due diligence on CVV's graphene
capabilities, which made us conclude emphatically that CVV has no unique capabilities in
graphene and should be shorted aggressively.


Joint IP Development Agreement with Pre-Development, Lab Stage Start Up


CVV recently signed and touted a "Joint Intellectual Property Development Agreement"
with Graphene Batteries AS. While the press release (here) is positive and sounds
exciting, it contains very little information about Graphene Batteries. Our due diligence
unveiled that Graphene Batteries is a newly formed startup that is less than one and a half
years old, comprised of only 3 people, and, so far, Graphene Batteries' only source of
funding is a $1 million grant from the Norwegian government, which may have run out
already.


To see how undeveloped Graphene Batteries is, one only needs to visit the website
(here), which only has 7 total pages and contains little substance, such a research papers,
information about R&D accomplishments, and an overview of its product development
milestones.


Moreover, Graphene Batteries only has 3 development stage products, none of which
have progressed beyond lab scale. This means they are years away and face significant
challenges to ever see the light of day.


CVD's Graphene Equipment Can Be Purchased From Dozens Of Others


As part of our due diligence, we also consulted with a leader in the graphene space. The
consultant was emphatic that CVD Equipment has no proprietary graphene know-how.
First, the acronym "CVD" stands for "chemical vapor deposition." Put simply, CVD

Equipment sells chemical vapor deposition equipment, which we found can be purchased
from at least 42 other manufacturers, as seen here.


Specifically, what CVD Equipment sells for graphene is a tube-shaped furnace that
deposits a layer of graphene onto a surface using heat. The same exact product is also
sold by much larger and better competitively advantaged public companies such as
Aixtron (OTCPK:AIXXF) and Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), as well as leading private
players such as Moorfield (here) and MTI Corporation (here).


CVD's furnace is a commoditized product that one can purchase from dozens of
manufacturers. This further explains why CVD has such low commodity-like margins.


Insignificant Patent Portfolio and Less Than 5 PhD's


In our first article, we also touched upon CVD's insignificant patent and IP portfolio, which
CVD carried on their balance sheet at a cost of $18,287 and $23,327.


We searched for CVD's patent portfolio on the United States Patent and Trademark Office
website and found only 3 patents. One can find CVD's patents by searching for "CVD
Equipment" under Assignee Name. The results can be found here.

Two of the patents are from 1985 and 2003, which is well before graphene entered the
mainstream in 2010, and are about an automatic valve shut-off system (unrelated to
graphene!) and a compartmentalized oven (again, unrelated to graphene!). The 3rd patent
concerns a high-throughput chemical vapor deposition system, which, as we showed
above, is manufactured by dozens of other companies and has little to do with graphene
in particular.


Why does CVD have no patents? The obvious answer is because CVD has no intellectual
property, as explained in our first write up (here) where we highlight CVD's miniscule R&D
spending. But why does CVD spend so little on R&D? Based on our diligence, as of June
30th, we believe CVD does not have more than 5 employees with PhDs on their payroll
currently and may have as few as 2. While our due diligence has been exhaustive, we
may be wrong on this figure. If CVD wishes, the Company can clarify the number of
employees it has with PhD's. Nevertheless, this is not indicative of deep know-how about
an emerging technology such as graphene.


Conclusion - CVD's Graphene Hype is All Smoke and Mirrors


We have done extensive due diligence on CVD and believe investors should be wary
about the Company's promises on graphene development. It is all hype. Instead, investors
should be alarmed by CVD's rapidly declining backlog, revenues, and negative cash flows.
