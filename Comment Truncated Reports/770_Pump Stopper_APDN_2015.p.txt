Applied DNA: 90+% Downside On Fraud Partners, Opaque U.K. Shell
Deal And Paid Stock Promotion

by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


APDN partnered with multiple people facing jail time, fraud allegations or shut down
by regulatory agencies. Tellingly, APDN has spent 6.6x more on insider
compensation than R&D.


APDN’s much-hyped DLA deal has now failed as APDN set to lose -61.2% of
revenue next year. With just ~6 months of cash APDN is now facing imminent
insolvency.


Registry docs show APDN hyped UK Patronus is opaque Limited Partnership
apparently started by “directors for hire,” no website and no material financials. Is
this “Valeant-esque”?


APDN’s 1999 era Chinese technology hopelessly obsolete as superior Synthetic
DNA and competitors dominate pharma, cotton and banking. APDN endless dilution
is egregious, with shares outstanding +6,600% so far.


Valuation temporarily inflated with paid stock promotion to obviously unsustainable
48x revenue level while superior peer companies trade for 1.5x. Imminent -92.62%
downside in “best case” scenario.


"The Truth Will Set You Free"


I believe Applied DNA Sciences (NASDAQ:APDN) is one of the worst retail-shareholder
wipeout machines I have ever seen, with insolvency risk and immediate -92.62%
downside. APDN is involved with penny stock wipeout artists including Robert DePalo,
indicted for defrauding investors out of $6.5m which DePalo spent on Bentleys and a $22k
lawn jockey statue. APDN co-founder Richard H. Langley Jr. was charged with
"conspiracy to commit securities fraud" in a nationwide FBI stock fraud sting. APDN CEO
James Hayward also associated and partnered with Michael Morris and Ronald
Heineman, who were barred by FINRA in October for engineering a "fraudulent scheme",
among many other questionable insiders.

With a recent "Valeant-esque" relationship with questionably opaque UK entity "Patronus"
full of red flags, APDN faces serious accounting and financial integrity questions with
confusing CFO and auditor turnover, as their latest auditor w found to have "audit
deficiencies". Perhaps clarifying APDN's true reason for existence, APDN insiders have
cumulatively paid themselves $33.36m which, is 6.6x total amount invested in R&D while
consistent cash burn has been funded with endless dilution as shares outstanding have
ballooned 6,600%. Concerning related party transactions abound where APDN CEO
loaned money to his own company and then converted it into stock 2 months later at
ridiculously favorable terms, turning a swift $1.41m profit for himself while apparently also
deciding to have APDN acquire assets from a company he and another APDN board
member were investors in.


Further research shows APDN's 1999 era Chinese product, acquired for stock over 10
years ago, is hopelessly obsolete in the face of superior competitors with modern
Synthetic DNA and integrated nanotech products already established with pharma, cotton
and cash customers.


Meanwhile APDN's primarily retail shareholder base is missing APDN's desperate
financial situation. With less than 6 months of cash burn left, APDN is now imminently
facing near term insolvency as business results are set to implode. The one time nature of
two non-recurring US government grants, apparently mostly pulled forward into 2015, and
the failed DLA contract imploding, means APDN will lose ~61.2% of their revenue in year
2016 with no legitimate way of making it up I can find.


As a result of paid stock promotion alongside unfounded DLA, Pharma market, Textiles
and "Patronus" hype, APDN stock has temporarily inflated to the valuation of 48x
forecasted sales, which is clearly ridiculous for an obsolete reverse merger based on old
Chinese technology lead by a group of self-enriching wipeout artists. Even assuming
APDN is a "real" company and using optimistic estimates, APDN stock has immediate
-92.62% downside similar to CEO James Howards other company Q-RNA.


A Brief APDN History Lesson: 1999-era Chinese Technology, Reverse-Merged Into
Penny Stock Shell

In 2002 APDN was born as a reverse merger into an OTC penny stock with a $2.5m
equity raise based on a 15 year licensing deal with Chinese company "Biowell" for a DNA
marking and authentication product created in Biowell's lab in 2001. Biowell made an
unsuccessful global push to commercialize this product themselves in the 2000s when
landed some US government deals while attempting to advance relationships with
multibillion dollar Asian companies. While Biowell even seems to have generated some
small amount of revenue, with company guidance of $10m in annual revenue back in
2004 on the back of a large scale, international advertising campaign, ultimately Biowell
sales appear to have been miniscule at best.


(pic credit google images)


At the time APDN licensed Biowell's technology for limited regions and APDN forecasted a
"very conservative" $5m of US revenue in 2004 (reality was $638k) with the CEO stating
he expected $500m+ of revenue, with "big markets" in oil/gas, textiles and microchips
(sound familiar?). APDN announced lots of supposed pilot programs, partnerships with the
US government, including the DOE and Hologram companies, while Biowell announced
deals with the USDA. Ultimately though it seems shareholders received repeated failure
while APDN insiders used the stock to issue massive amounts of dilutive equity to keep
the gravy train going as meaningful revenue never materialized. As one APDN insider
apparently put it: APDN had "no product, no sales and no hope of signing any customers".


As Biowell and APND both failing, Biowell decided to give it up and sold the DNA product
outright in a stock swap deal to the failing penny stock APDN in 2005. As a result, APDN
has been in the business of trying to sell this Chinese, daisy-DNA product to companies
as an authentication mark ever since.


The fundamental estimated economics of APDN's tiny business are that it sells a "license"
to customers in order for the right to use their DNA marking product and for APDN to
create the customer's DNA mark. This license cost has apparently been about $35-49k
historically with an extra $500 per additional DNA mark any customer may need.
Curiously, this price appears to have possibly increased for the DLA deal with the US
government to as much as $68k for some reason? The ~$50k estimated license ARPU
can be further corroborated with the total $1.45m of 2014 DLA revenue APDN disclosed
divided by the estimated ~28 DLA customers they had, for another way to estimate arpu of

~$50k. Customer cost for auditing can be another $5-10k per year and there are some
modest customer setup/training costs, I estimate to be another ~$5k per initial installation.
Since only the tiniest miniscule amount of ink is used per item, there is potentially a very
small amount of revenue from ink used per year plus some low margin equipment which I
estimate APDN has other companies manufacture and then primarily resells to its
customers with minimal profitability. As you can see above, the actual unit economics for
APDN depend almost exclusively on up front license revenue, which is based on the
number of new customers, as that is the only revenue they have with meaningful margin. I
don't think any of the investment banks or retail shareholders have built out their own
individual models based on the individual unit economics for each of APDN's products.
This is why it is critical you understand these dynamics in order to understand how
APDN's business is now imploding, as I will explain later on in this report.


Note that my opinions, research based on publicly available info and estimates are all
shared below free for the public good so you can form your own views. But I think the
evidence presented here is strong.


APDN Partners and Insiders: Multiple Fraud Allegations and Stock Market Disasters


As with any investment of any kind, we all agree the quality of the management and
insiders involved is of paramount importance. Unfortunately with APDN we have perhaps
the worst collections of stock market wipeout artists and convicted fraudsters I have seen
in quite some time.


I believe this mess started with co-founder and major APDN supporter Richard H. Langley
in the ProHealth Medical reverse merger. At the age of 33, Richard H. Langley Jr. was
charged with "conspiracy to commit securities fraud" and was a part of "the largest single
set of arrests ever made in the securities industry" where he was named as one of "45
penny-stock promoters, brokers, and company officers [that] were charged with securities
fraud after a nationwide [FBI] sting" leading to Langley's arrest.


For example, a schedule 13D apparently filed by Langley shows he owned 6% of Swiss
Medica, Inc. (OTC:SWME) which has a suspicious looking stock price chart….

Bad Habits Die Hard: Applied DNA CEO Continues the Penny-Stock Legacy


James A. Hayward is Applied DNA's current Chief Executive Officer and has been at the
helm since 2005 where it seems to me he has apparently decided to carry on the Langley
legacy with a twist: striking incredibly unfavorable (to shareholders - dilutive) deals with
some of Wall Street's worst financiers and convicted fraudsters.


Why is Applied DNA's CEO Associated with These Kind of People?

It turns out Hayward also has experience as a penny-stock investor. Hayward is the
general partner of the Double D Venture Fund and although I originally had high hopes for
this entity, it turns out the "Double D" could have stood for "Double Digit" losses as the
Double D Venture Fund invested in a company called Q-RNA which lost nearly all of its
value since going public. To make things worse, Hayward was also apparently a Director
at the company.

Hayward's longtime business buddy, Sidney Braginsky was also on the Board of Q-RNA
and serves as the managing director of the Double D Venture Funds LLC. Braginsky's
seemingly close business relationship with Hayward is highly concerning for a number of
reasons not the least of which is Braginsky's history of also being involved with numerous

Unfortunately this doesn't conclude the Braginsky saga, as from 1994 to 2000 he served
as the President of Olympus America Inc. Olympus lawsuit (Case No. 11-cv-7103) alleged
"financial fraud and decades-long cover-up" and Olympus admitted an "accounting
fraud going back to the 1990's". The Olympus Scandal, as it came to be known, was a
national disgrace in Japan in a similar scope as Enron or Worldcom in the US, described
as "one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in Japanese
corporate history." According to Wikipedia, "Despite Olympus' denials, the matter quickly
snowballed into a corporate corruption scandal over concealment of more than 117.7
billion yen ($1.5 billion) of investment losses and other dubious fees and other payments
dating back to the late 1980s and suspicion of covert payments to criminal
organizations."

Is it more likely that a key executive of the company like Sidney Braginsky (who was, in
fact, President during a significant portion of the time period in question), was completely
unaware of a large amount of fraud occurring right under his nose or, that he was in some
way a part of it? I'll let investors decide. The question here is why does James Hayward
feel so compelled to have seemingly close relationships with people like this in the first
place?


Applied DNA CEO Strikes Lucrative Deals with Wall Street's Worst Financiers and
Fraudsters


In 2007, Applied DNA CEO James Hayward agreed to a ridiculously dilutive financing
arrangement with Arjent Limited that allowed the bridge loan to be converted into stock.
Below are the details of the arrangement:


"The Bridge Loan shall be convertible, at the investor's option, through the first
anniversary of issuance, into shares of Common Stock at a price equal to 50% of
the average closing price of the 10 days prior to the date of the conversion
notice, not to be less than the "automatic conversion" price (30% discount to the
average volume, weighted average price of the Common Stock for the ten trading
days prior to the closing date of this Bridge Loan…)"


***These terms essentially guaranteed that Arjent Limited would make money at the
expense of other shareholders***


Furthermore, Applied DNA made the following payments to Arjent Limited:


"On May 2, 2006, we closed on the first tranche of the Offshore Offering in which we
sold 20 units for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,000,000. We paid Arjent Limited
$375,000 in commissions, fees and expenses from these gross proceeds. On
June 15, 2006, we completed the second tranche of the Offshore Offering in which
we sold 59 units for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,950,000. We paid Arjent
Limited $442,500 in commissions, fees and expenses from these gross
proceeds. Additionally, on July 10, 2006 we issued 2.4 million shares of our
common stock to Arjent Limited at $0.001 per share as partial consideration
for its services in connection with the Offshore Offering."


Robert DePalo is the Chairman of Arjent Limited. A lawsuit filed in 2015 by the SEC
charged Robert DePalo, Joshua Gladtke and Arjent Limited with allegedly employing a
sophisticated "scheme to defraud investors." DePalo, Gladtke and Arjent Limited all

appear in Applied DNA's filings under the name Vertical Capital Partners, Inc. or other
affiliated entities.


Court documents revealed that DePalo transferred millions of dollars of investor
funds to his own personal bank account and proceeded to spend the money on 3
Bentleys, a lawn jockey statue worth $22,000, a Rolex watch worth $10,000, thousands of
dollars for men's clothing and other lavish personal expenses. Furthermore, Joshua
Gladtke, was "charged with grand larceny, money laundering, criminal possession of
stolen property".

Unfortunately, this does not appear an isolated event for Applied DNA. According to
Applied DNA's 10-K, the company has also executed several financing arrangements
totaling $15,000,000 with an entity by the name of Crede Capital Group, LLC controlled by
former junk bond salesman Terren S. Peizer.

In 2003, Peizer founded the Prometa Treatment Program and took the company public
through a reverse merger in 2004. According to SEC filings, Peizer was the Chief
Executive Officer and significant shareholder of the parent company Hythiam, Inc. Peizer
raised $150 million from investors and rushed Prometa to market without the usual
medical research and government approvals. One doctor suggested that Peizer had
exploited a loophole in the system. CBS News reported that "Terren Peizer is selling hope
to the desperate" and others viewed Peizer as "snake oil salesman".


The company claimed that it's cocktail of medications benefitted people who were
addicted to methamphetamine. A study apparently paid for by Hythiam touted 80% of
patients "experienced a significant clinical benefit" from the treatment but the scientific
journal Addiction found that Prometa "is no more effective than a placebo in reducing
methamphetamine use".


Medical experts and the media expressed "sharp criticism" and doubt that the treatment
worked as advertised alleging that it lacked sufficient scientific evidence. That didn't stop
Peizer from being excessively promotional about the enormous plans he had for the
company and claiming "the results are positive" in an upcoming study that had not been
published. The chart below says it all: Prometa was a wipeout for investors.

Prior to the Prometa tragedy, Terren Peizer was the president of Hollis-Eden
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., another company that came public through a reverse merger.
Peizer apparently became some sort of AIDS guru, hyped its anti-AIDS drug (Immunitin)
and went as far as to suggest that there might be a partnership deal ahead. It seems that
through press releases and hopeful comments, Peizer was able to spin a tale that sparked
the imagination of investors who thought this could be a potential cure for AIDS. The stock
soared to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and ultimately the stock collapsed as

one doctor rightly pointed out "You can see the pseudoscientific language this is couched
in. It's gibberish, gobbledygook." The shares now fetch a fair "gibberish and
gobbledygook" price of just $0.09 (now known as Harbor Diversified).

Closing the Terren Peizer wipeout saga, is his involvement with another small cap stock
called Urethane Technologies. Peizer was the Chairman of the company that touted it had
a bicycle tire that wouldn't go flat. Peizer acquired 50% of the company and managed to
"dump his shares at a profit before the company eventually limped into bankruptcy in
1997".

Crede Capital Group shows the recent financings they have been a part of, but as far as I
can tell these companies appear to perform terribly over a longer time horizon. Let's
review some of Peizer's transactions that are proudly displayed on the company's website.

The Terren Peizer story doesn't end here, one of his associates, Michael Wachs, a
principal at Crede Capital Group, LLC (formerly known as Socius) is a convicted felon and
apparently a confessed embezzler barred by FINRA in 1998 for "stealing approximately
$20,800,000" (direct quote) and served 11 months in federal prison for his crimes. This
lawsuit shows Crede/Socius are closely associated with CEOcast, a website "shilling
penny stocks in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and shares",
according to Barron's.


Another Peizer associate, Richard Josephberg, a "commissioned salesperson" of the
Crede/Socius entities was sentenced to prison for 50 months for not paying taxes for 29
years. Josephberg's own children apparently testified against him in court and jury
convicted him of all 17 charges.


Two of Applied DNA's financiers while at Arjent, Michael Morris and Ronald Heineman,
were barred by FINRA in October of this year for engineering a "fraudulent scheme"
involving private placements. Remember that both Michael Morris and Ronald Heineman
were employees of Arjent which participated in a private placement with Applied DNA
according to Applied DNA's own SEC filings where both of the sanctioned individual's
names appear (emphasis mine):


"Arjent, a registered broker-dealer; Michael Morris, Susan Diamond and Ronald
Heineman, all of whom are employees of VC Arjent, are an "underwriter" as that
term is defined under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934"


And just when things couldn't possibly get any worse, Craig Josephberg, a registered
representative of the company Morris and Heineman are involved with, was named by the
SEC as a defendant in a "fraudulent scheme" . According to the Wall Street Journal
prosecutors indicted 7 individuals including a Craig Josephberg whom they specifically
accused for his participation in engineering $300 million "pump-and-dump" schemes. In

5/22/2018 Applied DNA: 90+% Downside On Fraud Partners, Opaque U.K. Shell Deal And Paid Stock Promotion - Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. (NA…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618566-applied-dna-90-plus-percent-downside-fraud-partners-opaque-u-k-shell-deal-paid-stock 16/75


my opinion, the following excerpt is especially important in regards to Applied DNA:
Prosecutors accused the defendants of using "misleading news releases and hidden
and illegal trading to dupe investors into believing companies with essentially no
assets or activities were worth hundreds of millions of dollars."*


(As a side note APDN has essentially no assets and is temporarily trading with 9-
figures of market cap)


And for the grand finale tying this whole nightmare together the FINRA complaint said the
following about fraudulent kickback scheme (emphasis mine):


"In May and July of 2012, Cell Therapeutics issued convertible preferred stock in two
private placements that raised $20 million and $15 million, respectively. The
investor in each was a fund managed but Los Angeles-based Crede Capital
Group LLC, formerly known as Socius Capital Group LLC…[the] deal was
coordinated by Michael Wachs, a partner at Socius"


So not only are several Applied DNA financiers who are tied directly to APDN's CEO
Hayward being accused and/or convicted of fraudulent wrongdoing but some of them
actually join forces? With this many alleged and convicted fraudsters involved with Applied
DNA this simply cannot be disregarded and I think at the very least Applied DNA's CEO,
James Hayward, owes APDN shareholders a thorough explanation of why he repeatedly
chooses to enter into agreements with these individuals over a multi-year time horizon
while also engaging in egregious self-enriching related party transactions.


Applied DNA's History of Hiring Questionable Investor Relations Individuals


Over the years, Applied DNA has also engaged several individuals to supposedly provide
investor relations services and often times suspiciously appear to be excessively
compensated in cash, stock and/or warrants. According to Applied DNA's own filings, it
already has several internal employees that are supposedly focused on providing investor
relations services. So why would APDN need additional outside investor relations support
from these individuals who at best have questionable penny-stock backgrounds and
lackluster track records?


Furthermore, why does a company that was recently trading for just pennies per share on
the OTC market need 3 investor relations people at all?

In 2009, Applied DNA engaged Crystal Research Associates, LLC to prepare an executive
informational overview more commonly known as a research report. For their services,
Crystal Research Associates received 200,000 warrants at a price close to the then
market price of APDN, a whopping $0.07 per share. Even more bizarre, is the following
disclosure contained in Applied DNA's SEC filing:


Crystal Research Associates, LLC v. Applied DNA Sciences, Inc., Docket No.:L-7947-04


"On April 29, 2005, Crystal Research Associates, LLC obtained a default
judgment against us for $13,000 in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex
County. We intend to move to vacate the default judgment on various grounds. We
dispute the allegations of the complaint and we intend to vigorously defend this
matter."


Why would Applied DNA engage Crystal Research Associates to provide services to the
company AFTER Crystal Research Associates took them to court a few years prior?
Furthermore, Crystal Research Associates, LLC has provided research products for other
companies that happened to be "not so great" long term investments:


· XOMA Ltd. (XOMA-NASDAQ)


· Unilife Corporation (UNIS-NASDAQ)


· Provectus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PVCT-OTC)


· Advaxis, Inc. (ADXS-OTC)


· Neonode Inc. (NEON-NASDAQ)


Applied DNA also worked with Jeffrey Salzwedel, another investor relations professional
that has been fined by NASD for allegedly making "unsuitable" stock recommendation for
customers while he headed Salzwedel Financial. Again, why would Applied DNA choose
to do business with these types of people and why did Jeffrey Salzwedel receive $630,000
from Applied DNA in 2004? Let's review some of Jeffrey Salzwedel's past associations
with penny-stock companies:


Salzwedel Financial Communication, Inc. signed an investor relations agreement with
Morgan Beaumont, Inc. in exchange for 1.8 million shares in the publicly traded company.

APDN Paid Stock Promotion and Questionable Stock Touts


If there is one thing investors need to know it is that they should never ever buy any stock
involved in a paid stock promotion campaign or any questionable stock tout circle. Time
and time again we have seen these kind of bottom tier stocks end up with violent
wipeouts.


Unfortunately APDN is associated with such reputable investment professionals as
"FreeHotPennyStocks.com", "PennyStockShark", "RICHSTOCKS" and the very
questionable Patrick Cox from SEC sued Agora Financial. For example, we can see
FreeHotPennyStocks.com touting APDN as "bringing the potential for 100% profit!" but a
quick glance into the tiny foot notes show the truth of huge payments for their
promotion:


"FreeHotPennyStocks has been compensated one hundred and fifty six thousand
dollars for a three month investor awareness campaign"


"PennyStockShark" was also apparently touting APDN in exchange for at least $35k for
their shill campaign.

It also appears "TheMarketCaliberTeam" was paid at least $40k as well as
"SuperNovaStockPicks.com" disclosed stock promotion payments of at least $30k, "Penny
Stock Money Train" disclosed $30k, Penny Stock Prophet disclosed $40k in
compensation, "CoolPennyStocks" apparently was paid $80k, as was "RICHSTOCKS"
where we also find another $80k compensation disclosure, along with many many others.

I don't want to waste your time so I will not go through the horrific track record of these
stock promotion outfits but if anyone believes investing alongside paid tout firms is a good
idea I can do a follow up article to show how bad they really are.


Patrick Cox has also been touting APDN's potential "life changing gains" from the "most
explosive stock opportunity I've found." Patrick Cox is a well-known (among short sellers)
newsletter author associated with Agora Financial. What I believe is most amazing about
Patrick Cox is he has one of the most uncannily consistent track records of recommending
retail investor stock wipeouts I have ever seen. A quick review of his picks include famous
retail shareholder wipeouts as STSI, which Patrick Cox touted as "an opportunity to hit the
mother lode". Unfortunately STSI's retail holders hit a brick wall and lost -99.13% of their
money as STSI stock fell from $123 per share to $0.88, changing its name to Rock Creek
Pharma (RCPI).

Or Galectin Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GALT) which was also exposed for curious paid stock
tout shenanigans as Patrick Cox touted GALT in "Ideas That Will Change the World".
Unfortunately GALT appears to have instead issued large amounts of dilutive equity and
"changed" retail shareholder cash into a much smaller amount as GALT stock fell from
$18 per share to $2 for a swift -88.8% loss.

And who could forget the amazing Provectus Pharmaceuticals (OTC:PVCT) which Patrick

Patrick Cox from "Agora Financial": Associated With Many Wipeouts, Also Associated
With APDN


(pic credit)


I believe Patrick Cox's Agora Financial itself is pretty questionable in its own right. While
the founder and President William Bonner apparently enjoys a Chateau in France, Agora
faced SEC allegations regarding an "ongoing scheme to defraud public investors"
involving disseminating false information and claiming to have insider information to sell
for $1,000.


I would never ever invest in any company associated with any paid stock promotion or
anyone like Patrick Cox and Agora Financial. As you can see above, touted stocks
typically swiftly implode creating large, permanent losses and should always be avoided.
Furthermore, they are a critical red flag because if the business fundamentals were truly
exceptional the company would be focused on that and not need to pay for, or be
associated with, any of these low quality stock tout outfits.

A series of recent exposes on Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) (here, here, and
here) reveal the company is allegedly using deconsolidated entities to juice profits and
manipulate shareholders, with some claiming VRX may be nothing more than an Enron
style scam. Unfortunately after looking into APDN's opaque relationship with their curious
"Patronus" UK banking deal partner I couldn't help but find eerie similarities. I'll let you be
the judge if this Patronus deal is actually great news and all just a big silly mix up or if
there is instead something much darker going on…


Patronus appears to be an opaque offshore shell recently setup by curious individuals with
no material banking background, with no website, little or no assets or sales, founding
address at a virtual office, with corporate registry documents showing connections to a
group of serial directors who have served on dozens of now defunct private Limited
Partnerships in the UK with confusing ownership.


On 9/17/2015, APDN issued a vague press release about an exclusive 5 year deal with a
curious UK-based company named "Patronus Systems Ltd." where no revenue terms
were disclosed. Bulls rejoiced and APDN stock rallied, but who exactly is Patronus?
Outside of the APDN press release, I could find nothing of substance about Patronus.


I pulled the corporate registry for Patronus Systems Limited and Patronus Cash Systems
Limited from the UK Companies House, a government owned corporate registry in
England. Based on the Certificate of Incorporation (Company No. 8915529), we know
that Patronus did not even exist before the 27th of February, 2014.

While curiously, Patronus apparently even registered a website domain but never thought
it necessary to actually have a website built despite virtually free cost? What kind of
business claims big banking relationships yet doesn't even have a website?


The Patronus press release quotes Duncan Grant, a company director at Patronus, who
said:


"I am relatively new to the cash handling industry…" "Leading banks across Europe
are working with us in adapting this new technology."


How do those two statements possibly belong together? And who exactly is this curious
Duncan John Grant? It appears Duncan James Grant brings such heavy hitting
experience to the cash handling industry as his background with a wine events company,
a claimed artificial intelligence company, and EURORAXX Limited, a company apparently
involved in the sale of retail sporting goods. In fact, an extensive search for Mr. Grant

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3618566-applied-dna-90-plus-percent-downside-fraud-partners-opaque-u-k-shell-deal-paid-stock 25/75


reveals that he apparently has no substantial background at all in the cash handling
industry (something he freely admitted in the PR) prior to founding Patronus Systems in
early 2014 and none of his other companies have any evidence of success I could find.


The rabbit hole gets deeper too as below we find a Peter Mila joining Duncan Grant on the
board of this Patronus shell. Peter Mila's date of birth at 23/10/1968 puts him at age 48.

Given the hype around the APDN-Patronus relationship, it would stand to reason Mila
ought to be a cash handling expert, but that doesn't appear to be the case either. Like
Grant, Mila appears to be a part of a series of active and defunct Limited Partnerships that
seemingly have nothing to do with cash handling, while his main job appears to be as
Logistics Director for Thomas Pink, a high-end clothing designer in London. Needless to
say, Thomas Pink is NOT in the cash handling business at all, so it's unclear what
expertise Mila would bring. It seems highly likely to me that this is the same Peter Mila as
the Peter in the LinkedIn profile, who, at age 48, would have approximately 26 years of
professional experience after completing university. There is no educational information
listed on Mila's LinkedIn, but his listed experienced does span back to 1989, 26 years ago,
seemingly indicating a match to me but it is admittedly unclear.


The last member of the team at Patronus is Peter John Rogers. Rogers has been
involved in no less than 47 board appointments for various Limited Partnerships in
the UK spanning back to at least 1990, according to Company House UK records. Is
Rogers a "director-for-hire" for random limited partnership shells? If he is not here to
obscure true ownership what exactly is going on here? Are we to believe the clothing
designer and wine events guys above are the true people behind APDN's recently
founded "game changing" cash handling shell company? While I was not able to get
APDN on the phone to confirm or disprove my speculations, I believe these people
involved have all the hallmarks of a group of proxy directors hired to create opacity and so
I advise caution and forming your own opinion.


In Patronus registry documents, the previously address was The Beehive, City Place,
London Gatwick Airport, Gatwick, West Sussex, England, RH6 0PA (also here). "The
Beehive" is a apparently a virtual rent-an-office next to the airport, where a mailing
address can be rented for as little as 49 pounds a month.


As of a new filing dated 2/17/2015, Patronus has relocated down the street to the Explorer
Building Fleming Way Crawley West Sussex England RH10 9GT, which Endole lists it as
having "No Accounts," zero cash in the bank, and zero net worth. Also residing at the
same address is Assetturn Limited, another Duncan Grant Limited Partnership, which also
apparently has little or no assets and is listed as "Dormant".


At this point I believe APDN shareholders deserve immediate answers to some very
serious questions:

Who are Rogers, Grant and Mila? If they are proxy "stand in" directors, who is honestly
behind this concerning shell company?
Does Patronus have any material customers, sales, or assets?
Why are multiple no asset Limited Partnerships involving Grant residing at the same
address?
Why did APDN put out a press release about Patronus when it appears to be a brand
new startup with little or no operations?
Was APDN or any of its officers involved in setting up the Patronus Limited Partnership
and putting proxy directors on the board of Patronus?
Have any cash or stock payments been made to Patronus?
Given the opaque Patronus ownership and various past APDN partners facing fraud
allegations, what exactly are the financial terms of the deal signed with Patronus?


As it turns out, the "Companies House" is infested with fraudsters


Two articles here and here reveal troubling information that thousands of people
registered with the Companies House have participated in financial fraud, terrorism,
money laundering, illicit arms dealing, drug trafficking, corruption, and general
shenanigans. According to The Times, "The research exposes an apparent absence of
vetting of who can and cannot register a business and become a company director in
Britain" and that "that the vetting regime in place was so lax that 1,500 disqualified
directors were also found on the register."


A money-laundering consultant added, "Considering the way that companies can be used,
one might think that in this age there would be close monitoring of the identities of
directors."


Quoting the article, qualifications to sit on the board include such rigorous standards as:


No qualifications are required to become a company director
Private limited companies must have at least one director and one company secretary
The only stipulated job of a director is to submit the company's accounts and returns
on time to Companies House

boards, with no website, against entrenched competitors in a 30+ year old mature
industry?


But magic aside, let's take a look at the cash handling business in Europe. APDN would
have you believe they are already a leader in the cash handling business in Europe even
though the company has been in Europe for over 5 years and APDN's revenue has
effectively never ramped to meaningful scale.


Similar to the US, countries in Europe employ a variety of Cash in Transit (NYSE:CIT)
protection methods including armored vehicles, armed guards, and Intelligent Banknote
Neutralization Systems (IBNS). The purpose of IBNS is to mark or destroy the money
contained in a cash safe box if the box is improperly opened: If a thief cannot reap the
reward of the theft, there is no reason to commit theft in the first place.


According to a European Union Commission Report, "All countries operate armored
transportation and to a certain extent IBNS." Meaning, IBNS is not a new technology, and
the market in Europe is mature with all countries listed in the report already using some
form of IBNS.


Furthermore, an EU proposal in 2010 created additional demand for IBNS by
standardizing intra-country cash transfers across the EU. This demand never flowed
through to APDN, apparently, because APDN is a tiny company and largely
inconsequential in the market relative to the larger, established companies already
providing this service.


From the impact assessment, we can see that the IBNS industry in Europe was supportive
of this proposal, creating a win-win for all involved parties:


"Intelligent Banknote Neutralization systems (IBNS) manufacturers are supportive too and
would like the use of intelligent banknote neutralisation devices to benefit from the
initiative as they can help resolving the difficult issue of the carrying of weapons in a
cross-border context. Their argument is that the use of 'smart devices' to transport cash
provides a high degree of security without necessarily involving the use of weapons."


The rule was ultimately adopted at the end of 2012 in the EU.


The IBNS provider industry in Europe is mature and very competitive

There are six major global players in this market: 3SI, Spinnaker, SQS, Villiger, Gehrer,
and Oberthur Cash Protection; these companies export IBNS to many countries
worldwide. They are members of EURICPA - European Intelligent Cash Protection
Association. EURICPA focuses on promoting ink staining technology as the most secure
and safe solution for CIT.


Oh, I'm sorry, where are Applied DNA and Patronus on the list? You're goin' nowhere!


You already know how this movie ends but just for fun let's briefly review some of these
competitors:


Oberthur


Oberthur Cash Protection is a French manufacturer of Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation
Systems to protect cash, based in Dijon, France. Established in 1985, the company holds
one of the first IBNS patents to protect valuables by neutralizing them with ink and, as of
2011, is the largest manufacturer of Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation systems in
the world, with over 60,000 systems installed.


Oberthur Cash Protection's customers are major CIT companies (G4S, Loomis, Brinks,
Prosegur), banks (Travelex, HBOS, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, Credit du Nord, BPCE,
Banque Postale, Banque De France, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, CIBC,
Swedbank,Raiffeisen Bank, and others), and ATM manufacturers (NCR, Wincor Nixdorf,
Diebold, retailers, and others).


Spinnaker


Founded in 1985, Spinnaker leads the market in intelligent bank note neutralisation
systems. Spinnaker exports cost-effective solutions worldwide, and has developed many
flexible systems that provide a safe and secure medium for the transport and storage of
cash and ATM cassettes.


Spinnaker's range of products offer leading solutions for cash security with ink degradation
and indelible security ink. Our continuing innovation for the security of bank notes
means that we are already prepared for this significant change in bank note production.


Villiger


VILLIGER SECURITY SOLUTIONS AG, established in 1988, belongs to the leading
manufacturers of intelligent security solutions.

But what about APDN? They frequently issue incredible sounding press releases
that lack revenue terms or any meaningful details about the viability of their
business!


The problem is, Applied DNA has been providing IBNS products in Europe since 2009 and
yet scant revenue has ever been produced by the company.


As far as I can tell, there are only three possible explanations for this:


APDN has tiny market share of the IBNS market in Europe and has never been able to
ramp the business up, and probably never will
The unit economics of the IBNS business are incredibly small, so even with decent
market share, no significant revenue will ever be generated
APDN is a "me too" IBNS service provider who has never been able to become a "go
to" supplier for any of the major customers in the market and may only have revenue
generated from one-time or short duration trials


So Mr. Grant, who exactly are these "Leading banks across Europe?" that you are
speaking with?


I wonder if Patronus is talking to the same "leading banks across Europe," from the
section above because it seems like APDN's competitors already have it under control?


If the APDN product is so good, why don't they have partnerships with any of the major
suppliers in Europe, instead having to settle for a Limited Partnership started 18 months
ago by guys who sit on a lot of Limited Partnership boards but have apparently no
meaningful cash handling experience to speak of?


Exclusivity Means Exclusive


The terms of the deal include a 5 year exclusivity agreement with Patronus, meaning
APDN is now exclusive with this 18 month old company run by directors who sit on
multiple Limited Partnership companies, with no website, and apparently no revenue or
assets from what I can tell. Another nice way of saying this is that, in all probability, APDN
is exclusive with a company that seems incapable of ever win significant new revenue-
generating contracts, thereby prohibiting APDN from getting any significant new customer
wins.


This is like shooting yourself in the foot. Why would APDN do this if they were confident in
their product? The question answers itself, in my view.

APDN Historical Revenue

Picture made by me


APDN's Obsolescence and Failing DNA Market Position: Synthetic DNA and
Competitor Superiority


Now that you understand the quality of the people behind APDN, let us evaluate the
product they are touting so you can begin to understand the bigger picture of what is
happening here. It seems many APDN shareholders and touts believe APDN has
something unique or the best DNA authentication offering available. I think research
shows that nothing could be further from the truth. While APDN's failed CEO apparently
compares their obsolete technology to penicillin and Thomas Edison's light bulb (q1 2015
call), real investors who have done deep work talking to competitors in the industry know
APDN's technology is obsolete and failing.

Remember APDN's product and technology was created in a late 1990s Chinese lab,
which apparently gave up on it and sold it to APDN in exchange for penny stock shares.
Since then APDN has spent virtually nothing on R&D so you should not be surprised to
learn APDN is now hopelessly behind the technology curve while other DNA tagging and
authentication companies dominate APDN in this small niche market. Not only are there
other superior plant-based organic technology based products and companies available
but a whole new class of "Synthetic DNA taggants" have been invented since APDN came
on the scene, which offer vastly superior security and functionality at a structurally lower
cost.

The global leader in DNA authentication is SelectaDNA, a UK company that has been
offering its technology since 1985 and which has already marked over 30 million items.
SelectaDNA offers its products in over 30 countries and hosts a database of marked items
that is accessible to police forces around the globe. APDN isn't even close, and for any
police force or commercial customer requiring DNA-authentication products, they might as
well just go with SelectaDNA, which is vastly superior to APDN in terms of experience,
brand, size, scale, and global presence.

Authentix is another global authentication giant with a large head start on APDN, having
been formed in 1992 and incubated at Royal Dutch Shell before ultimately spinning out as
a standalone company. The company has a number of Fortune 500 and government
clients. Currently, Authentix is backed by the The Carlyle Group, one of the top private
equity firms in the world. The company has what is probably the best management team
in the industry, serves 5 out of the top 10 global healthcare companies with $50 billion of

products carrying the Authentix brand, protects 48% of the US gasoline market, and has a
significant presence in currency and consumer products applications. APDN has virtually
no chance against this juggernaut. In my view: Authentix would crush APDN in any head-
to-head bidding scenario I can think of and there is zero chance APDN has any
technology advantage over Authentix. All of this should be self evident as APDN's revenue
has failed to ramp over the lifetime of the company.


As if clearly superior global juggernauts were not enough, the DNA authentication
technology market place has moved to Synthetic DNA. There are many reasons for this
but the two most important aspects are that synthetic DNA can encode significantly more
target information, allowing a higher level of encryption and allowing more target data to
be embedded into the product, while simultaneously synthetic DNA has a huge cost
advantage over botanical DNA products. There are many offering this superior technology
from BrandWatch, which has already signed large pharma customers, to DNA
Technologies, Obiex DNA Solutions and others.


DNA Technologies is a formidable competitor and far ahead of the curve relative to APDN,
having key relationships with such industry giants as Avery Dennison (serving 11 top
apparel brands), Thomas Kinkade, the NFL, and tennis balls provided at the US Open. It's
almost certain that these industry leaders would have also sought discussions with APDN,
only to pass and go with the superior provider.


This continues to render APDN increasingly obsolete and irrelevant, pushing them further
into the bottom end of the market competing against all the other standard DNA
authentication companies like TraceTag, DNAtrax and others. In this context it is not hard
to see why APDN is more known for endless stream of largely meaningless press
releases instead of actually signing revenue or profit generating contracts.


APDN Government DLA Deal Failed: APDN Unraveling with -61.2% of Total Revenue
Now Going Away


The recent hype responsible for the current temporarily inflated APDN valuation is the
retail investor dream of a 2012 US government DLA contract finally coming to fruition.
Unfortunately for APDN shareholders though, deep industry research shows that
relationship has officially blown up into an unprecedented cluster with the economics now
going in reverse for APDN as revenue falls off a cliff. Given how badly this went for APDN
and the US government, I also don't see how APDN's relationship with the DLA has not
become permanently impaired.

For background: in 2012 the Defense Logistics Agency ("DLA") decided to test drive anti-
counterfeit technology in response to publicity regarding fake semiconductor chips
potentially in military equipment. The DLA started with a small class of chips in the FSC
5962 class for this product marking experiment and mandated that chip manufacturers
and the (most likely counterfeit) distributors to all mark their chips with APDN technology.
APDN bulls rejoiced as they expected APDN to receive lucrative license revenue from all
the DLA's 5962 class suppliers which would each need their own DNA mark and license.
Per APDN's SEC filed 10s this DLA-derived revenue is estimated at ~50% of sales in
2014 and 2013 driving virtually all of the small revenue growth and decreased cash burn
APDN has seen.


Unfortunately the whole thing quickly blew up into a cluster of unparalleled magnitude
wasting untold amounts of US tax payer money. Perversely, INCREASING the risk of
counterfeit chips entering the military supply chain and harming US soldiers as the DLA
began buying 80% of their chips from brokers and other channels - which is apparently
where counterfeits typically come from. It is important for you to also understand that the
DLA typically buys chips from two main sources: first the Original Component
Manufacturers (OCMs) which build the chips in house, or secondly the DLA can buy chips
from brokers and distributors who source the chips themselves from wherever is available.

Immediately after the DLA's ruling, the large and trustworthy Original Component
Manufacturers (OCMs) quickly withdrew from selling to the DLA. Their cited concerns
include: that the new DNA program would not prevent counterfeits anyway, the
hassle was prohibitive and the technology unsound relative to other solutions already
available which could be implemented in the critical QC step for every chip anyway, while
the industry was not comfortable being locked into a "sole source" relationship with any
one marking provider DNA or otherwise and losing control of their own supply chain
process meant they were not comfortable providing warranties since opening their
packages and administering the ink technically alters the parts which are then not in "as
shipped" condition.


As Dan Deisz from Rochester Electronics explains product integrity dramatically declines
while costs to US tax payers almost immediately doubled for the newly less reliable parts:


"What simultaneously happened was that all the authorized suppliers backed out
because they said they wouldn't use the DNA marking and brokers recognized an
opportunity to be in a sole-source position where they could increase prices with the
DLA. In six quarters after mandating DNA marking, their costs doubled for FSC
5962 product, as they flipped from buying 80 percent of the 5962 products
from authorized suppliers to buying 80 percent of the same products from
brokers. They are now unwinding that. However, it's a slow switchback due to
various purchase agreements and red tape."


Even worse, with questionable brokers now supplying DNA stamped chips to the DLA the
whole system seems to have quickly broken down with multiple instances of questionable
parts seemingly being unable to verify authenticity despite having APDN's DNA stamps:


"There have been three documented instances where a QSLD broker has put
DNA marking on a suspect counterfeit product. One of these instances resulted
in a GIDEP Agency Action Notice from DLA. In all three of these instances, the
suspect product was returned to the seller in violation of NDAA 2012
requirements. Most suppliers agree that the DNA is probably uncopyable, but if it is
being misused and put on suspect counterfeit product what value does it add?


This DNA stamping fiasco seems to have lowered product integrity and reliability so much
that:

"Some prime contractors and government program managers will not take product
from DLA any more because they don't trust the parts they are getting" " DNA
marking has been and continues to be a waste of taxpayer money. If you put out an
irrational directive, and all of your authorized suppliers say 'no thank you, we choose
not to do business with you,' shouldn't you look at your directive and the unintended
consequences?"


Given the extent of this fiasco it should not be a shocker the DLA quickly backpedaled. On
10/11/2014 the DLA announced they had rescinded their decision, with new terms going
into effect 12/15/2014 that the DLA now would be the sole DNA stamping party with
forecasted 1 year time frame to completion for this transition. This is an unmitigated
financial disaster for APDN, let me explain.


Remember that APDN's primary source of revenue in this contract, and otherwise, is from
upfront license fees they charge. Previously has received an estimated $50k each from
~28 distributors to license the APDN DNA stamp. As you can see below, this created a
temporary revenue ramp into 2014. However now the DLA is the only party stamping the
electronics and they require only one ~$50k license, sending APDN's business into swift
financial reversal as that $1.45m of revenue goes to ~$50k.

In a rare bout of APDN financial transparency you can begin to see the impact of this
financial dynamic on APDN into 2015 where, as of the 8/2015 call and only 8 months into
the one year transition, APDN's DLA revenue had already declined by -55.17%. This DLA
dynamic not only removes almost $1.5m of very high margin revenue but I believe likely
impairs APDN's relationship with the US military.


With the DLA now backed into the corner they have admitted:


"We are open to other solutions and tools as we learn about them."


Simultaneously, I don't see how the DLA is equipped to properly verify semiconductor
chips for authenticity where APDN themselves say "product inspections are of limited
value" in regards to inadequate authentication methods. So how is the DLA attempting to
physically verify each chip in their possession independently possibly a bullet proof
solution to counterfeit chips? Semiconductor quality control is not the DLA's specialty and
this recent shift to DLA verification and stamping seems like an obviously flawed idea to
me.


Is it a coincidence that now APDN's superior competitor DDT just signed a major contract
with one US government agency and have started a pilot "proof of concept" with another?
Meanwhile a well funded non profit has created a counterfeit verification method that is
100% reliable, and only takes seconds in a standard QC procedure. How can APDN
possibly compete with a company with no need to generate a profit?


I would not be surprised to hear APDN's technology completely removed by the DLA.
Either way I imagine whichever poor individual championed APDN's products at the US
military is not in good standing now and APDN's relationship is permanently impaired.


Going into Year 2016, APDN Expected to Lose -61.2% of Their Revenue


Furthermore, the only reason APDN didn't implode in 2015 was they got lucky with two
non-recurring government grants they received for a total of $4m over 2 years. However, it
seems APDN may have "pulled out the stops" to hit milestones necessary to pull that
revenue forward. Now APDN has recognized ~68.7% of that "one time" grant revenue in
2015 which means it will not recur in 2016, creating a large revenue cliff they cannot
avoid.


The combination of the nearly $1.5m of high margin DLA revenue APDN will never see
again and the $2.75m of non-recurring grant revenue that will not occur in 2016 means
APDN will lose -61.2% of their revenue going into 2016 with no legitimate prospects of
making that up I can find. Even more concerning, APDN CEO has guided to higher

operating expenses with more hiring while they will lose that $1.45m of nearly pure margin
DLA license revenue, meaning APDN cash burn is set to accelerate dramatically as
revenue falls off a cliff. This is already underway and should begin to hit APDN's financial
statements in Q3 and Q4, which should send the stock into a tailspin as excuses will be
insufficient once revenue starts shrinking rapidly while losses continue to pile on.


Applied DNA: Financial Integrity In Question - Multiple Accounting Red Flags With
Auditor Deficiencies


According to several reports by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, an
inspection into the audit activities of Applied DNA's former auditor RBSM LLP found "audit
deficiencies". More specifically:


"deficiencies identified in one of the audits reviewed included a deficiency of
such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm did not
obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the
issuer's financial statements."


RBSM LLP has been involved with other penny stock companies that appear to worth
close to nothing in the end.

Even more concerning is that fact that Applied DNA has previously reported material
weaknesses in its own filings and received multiple letters from SEC regarding the
company's filings and disclosures. On top of all of this, in 2014, APDN dismissed RBSM
as its independent public accounting firm and appointed Marcum LLP in its place. Marcum
LLP appear even worse than RBSM to me, with their own PCAOB cited deficiencies
ranging from insufficient evidential matter to support their opinion to failure to perform
sufficient audit procedures to test revenue, among other issues.


Speaking of Marcum, APDN's current Chief Financial Officer, Beth Jantzen was employed
there right before she started working at APDN. Below is Beth Jantzen's bio directly from
Applied DNA SEC filings:


"Beth Jantzen, age 38, was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
effective February 15, 2015. Ms. Jantzen held the position of Controller since May
2013. Prior to joining the company, Ms. Jantzen was a senior manager at Marcum
LLP, the Company's independent registered accounting firm since June 23,
2014, where she managed multiple engagements and specialized in SEC policies,
practices and procedures, including Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Ms. Jantzen holds
a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Accounting from the State University of New York at
Binghamton and is also a Certified Public Accountant (NYSE:CPA)"


Before Jantzen was the CFO, Ms. Gray was appointed as Chief Financial Officer effective
October 14, 2013 and resigned effective February 15, 2015. Did Ms. Gray resign due to
concerns about the company's financial integrity?


Frequently changing your Auditor, Chief Financial Officer, and further reporting material
weaknesses in your financial statements are all major red flags. Taken together, these
issues should give investors extreme pause about the reliability and integrity of the
company's financial statements.


APDN's Empty "Pharma Opportunity" Hype

APDN stock also seems to have been recently strong based on misplaced optimism
among retail investors betting on APDN's new "Pharma Opportunity". Unfortunately, while
APDN endlessly press releases new meaningless "pilot projects", their DNA
authentication competitors and the pharma industry have left then hopelessly behind
years ago and vague press releases don't keep the lights on or sustain a high stock price
forever.


For instance, DNATrax is apparently already approved for human consumption by the
FDA and already in pharma. DNA Authentication company "DNA Technologies" already
has a pharma industry product. Schreiner MediPharm already launched their DNAsecure
product at the huge NYC medical packaging conference back in early 2014 with full "plug
and play" IT integration. Not to mention Schreiner offers a comprehensive broad product
offering of RFID solutions, color shifting ink, thermos reactive print and the most advanced
anti counterfeiting, with logistics track and trace functionality, of any company in the world.


Brandwatch rolled out their superior synthetic DNA authentication product for pharma
customers with one of the world's largest pharma companies back in 2012. Abbott Pharma
also apparently was rolling out BioDetect's DNA anti-counterfeit technology back in 2007


The future of authentication technology is in nanotechnology anyway and the pharma
industry is already rapidly advancing this option instead of DNA authentication products
anyway. In fact, SchreinerMediPharm's "next gen" product is a complex 3d hologram with
embedded nanotechnology magnetic wires that can be machine read alongside
LaserHighSecure products in second with handheld tools in seconds, that are essentially
impossible to reproduce.


APDN is years behind the curve here touting an inferior product. More "pilot program"
press releases of hype are not going to cut it at this point. With a hopelessly obsolete
product and in the face of intense superior competition I estimate APDN's probability of
landing profitable and large pharma customers generating material ($2m+ sales annually)
at ~0%.


APDN Cotton Claims = 11+ years of Broken Promises For Commoditized and
Unviable Offering


The final factor currently driving APDN stock hype are unfounded claims APDN will
generate profitable revenue growth based on selling products to the cotton and textiles
markets. Despite APDN touting this textile story since at least 2004 when they signed
"pilot programs!" with NC based Champion Thread, and 11 other apparel brands trialed
competing DNA authentication technology as far back as 2003, this story refuses to die

and is back again. Basic research and fact checking shows any outlandish claims APDN
could do tens of millions of dollars in sales for simple, generic cotton genotyping are
delusional though. Identifying cotton genes, or genotyping, is old technology and has been
done for decades and basically just involves extracting the DNA and matching it up. To
think cotton companies will routinely pay APDN $10m+ per year for essentially the same
process used to identify illegitimate fathers on Jerry Springer is clearly absurd. If
necessary I will go into more detail on why APDN's cotton story is clearly unviable.
However, for now you can simply google research "cotton genotyping" to find countless
places that either have or could easily and cheaply provide this service. Like this journal
that outlines a lab process for extracting cotton DNA for as little as $0.05 per sample using
basic lab techniques.


"DNeasy Plant Mini Kit": Plant DNA kit available online for $218, requires zero APDN

Any gene lab in the country could simply buy this $218 "DNeasy Plant mini kit" for the dna
extraction while universities around the world have already been identifying specific cotton
genes for many years. Affymetrix will sell you your own Axiom cotton genotyping array if
you just call them.


Meanwhile the cost of DNA sequencing is falling in half every 22 months, so any value
add in this space is only becoming increasingly commoditized as the cost goes to nearly
$0.

Rapidly Falling DNA Sequencing Cost Rendering APDN Increasingly Commoditized

To think the cotton industry has not worked out their own way to identify specific types of
cotton is clearly absurd and the probability APDN generates a meaningful profit from this
segment is obviously zero.


Understanding APDN's True Purpose: Flagrant Insider Enrichment and Concerning
Related Party Transactions Abound


Since we now understand APDN's is hopeless unviable; what is the true purpose of
APDN's existence? What is this team of wipeout artists possibly doing with this old and
unviable technology in a reverse merger shell?


The chart below makes me sick and I don't see how any shareholder alive would consider
this anything other than abusive and offensive. I apologize as the chart below is a bit small
but this is absolutely critical for you to understand so please follow along closely.


The body of this table breaks down APDN's insider compensation, below that is APDN's
revenue and R&D spending for each year.

In yellow on the right you will see APDN insiders have "earned" a staggering $32.36m of
compensation, coming straight out of shareholder pockets.


Most offensively, APND has invested just $4.87m into R&D over the last 11 years
combined. This means insiders paid themselves a ridiculous 6.63x what was invested in
R&D. How could APDN possibly stay relevant in a hyper competitive industry given this
gross abuse of shareholder money? How could this possibly be considered fair and
acceptable?!


What have APDN's retail shareholders "enjoyed" as a result of paying these people tens
of millions of dollars?


Why is APDN CEO James A. Hayward Smiling? He made $13.2m from the APDN
Piggy Bank (I'd be smiling too) while APDN has Burned -$211m of Shareholder's
Money (so far)…..

How have APDN insiders possibly funded this incredible insider compensation in the face
of constant financial disaster?


Then how has this relentless dilution driven piggybank for insiders been possible?


Likely as a result of APDN's 10+ years of failure and paid stock promotion, there are no
credible sophisticated investors involved. The only shareholders you would recognize by
name are typical large holders who directly replicate the NASDAQ index for their clients as
passive index investors. Meanwhile a full 76.84% of the shareholder base is "mom and
pop" retail holders who lack the time or resources necessary to do conduct proper
institutional-quality due diligence on APDN to understand what is truly going on.

That's Not All! APDN's Spiderweb of Related Party Transactions With Concerning
CEO Loans


Apparently making $32m+ for doing nothing I can see is still not enough for the APDN
team. On 10/11/2014 [aa5] the APDN team and CEO James Hayward decided the best
idea they could come up with was for James Hayward to loan money to his own company
for 10 months at 12.5%. Then even more upsetting, just 2 months later James Hayward
and the APDN gang all agreed to convert this loan into an egregious amount of stock,
giving him 252,137 shares along with another 252,137 warrants struck at $3.25. With
APDN stock now temporarily hyped up to nearly $8 per share that XYZ loan is now worth
~$3.2m excluding any interest payments he may have received for a whopping $1.41m
profit to CEO James Hayward! Not bad for 2 month loan to your own company at the
expense of shareholders!!


That isn't all though as in 2012 APDN CEO and insiders again decided the best idea they
could come up with would be to issue a million dilutive warrants and a generous revenue
share to a tiny company James Hayward and APDN insider Yacov were both investors in:


" We acquired rights to certain software and intellectual property pursuant to an
agreement we entered into with DivineRune Inc., a secure cloud-computing
specialist, on January 25, 2012. DivineRune was issued a 3 year warrant to
purchase one million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of$0.071 per
share vesting in full on the first anniversary of the date of grant as compensation for
a license to DivineRuneâ€™s patent portfolio. We will also share revenues on any
future sales of products generated as a result of this agreement. We expect that the
partnership will enhance and extend our core anti-counterfeiting, anti-diversion, and
security systems into the digital track-and-trace sphere. James A. Hayward, our
President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Yacov Shamash, a
member of our Board of Directors, were among the early investors in
DivineRune. "


Does this all seem fair to YOU?? These guys are making millions and millions of dollars
while diluting unsophisticated retail investors into oblivion and losing literally hundreds of
millions of dollars of investor money. How much longer can this possibly continue??

APDN's Dangerous Financial Position: Imminently Facing Insolvency as Cash Burn
Accelerates


Unfortunately for APDN's retail shareholders, huge insider compensation, -$211m of
losses (so far) and an unviable product mean APDN loses a staggering amount of money
each and every year. As this trend has only gotten worse, despite APDN's constant
dilutive and abusive equity raises, APDN is always one failed capital raise away from
bankruptcy. Today is no different and with current cash dwindling as APDN cash burn is
now set to get worse, I believe we are fast approaching the "event horizon" where APDN
finally goes up in smoke and ceases to exist.


(chart by me with public information)


As you see above, APDN is estimated in the "optimistic case scenario" to have barely ~6
months of cash left before bankruptcy. Note that I believe companies are typically required
to keep at least 1 year of cash needs on hand in order to avoid the dreaded "going
concern" auditor statement which typically marks so many companies before their demise.


This means APDN is now in a precarious position and I believe only has three options left:

1. "Most Likely Outcome": APDN is totally unviable and survives only on repeated dilution.
APDN gets stuck in a game of "chicken" with potential investors who are happy to sit back
and let APDN squirm as cash flow dwindles. The kind of sharky investors who participate
in equity raises for these bottom tier companies are not afraid of playing games and drag
desperate APDN into a "death spiral" as they push for increasingly better terms at the
expense of APDN shareholders. Eventually a deal is executed on horrible terms and
APDN stock becomes unhinged as it violently breaks down to it's fair value of $0.19 per
share on this terrible news.


2. "Next Most Likely Outcome": APDN struggles to find more bagholders willing to
immediately put up the $10m+ of cash they require, and with a failed capital raise APDN
swiftly goes bankrupt like countless other failed and unviable micro-cap penny stock tech
stories. APDN stock goes to $0.


3. APDN management's blathering finally becomes reality and APDN grows revenue over
the next two quarters and becomes cash flow positive. In this case I am completely wrong,
APDN never issues equity since that is not necessary with their revenue growth and
profits. As a result, APDN has zero need for any more dilution and current shareholders
rejoice. However APDN is still valued at 12.5x even the "fantastyland" estimates put forth
by APDN's obviously conflicted investment banker Maxim. Peers trade at 1.5x revenue
though and I don't see how APDN is worth 12.5x sales so honestly APDN stock is still
quite overvalued even using the unreasonably aggressive estimates put out but their most
passionate cheerleaders.


DNA-Authentication Shareholder Wipeouts: We've Been Down This Road Before…..


Unfortunately APDN is not the first DNA authentication wipeout to occur as APDN is
essentially just a left over zombie company from the early 2000 authentication bubble.
This DNA technology and concept is neither new, nor successful - in fact it is over 15
years old and the industry is littered with failures like APDN. Most interestingly, as I will
explain, some of these companies appear vastly and irrefutably superior to APDN as well.
First, a history lesson in DNA authentication wipeouts as none of these companies have
worked out and all have been wipeouts:


First, APDN: A Shareholder Loss Odyssey in 1080 HD


Starting back in the early 2000s, coinciding with the Authentication bubble, APDN
managed to inflict severe pain on anyone unfortunate enough to be long the stock at
virtually any point in its history.

Not to be outdone, the Aussies got into the game with a company named DataDot that
has done nothing but go "Down Under" for its shareholders over the last decade, now
trading at $0.02, similar to where APDN stock was before the 60:1 reverse stock split.

In order to show how absurdly over valued APDN has temporarily become let us look at
DataDot as a comparison since is an obviously superior company and also the most
accurate benchmark for valuing APDN. Through reviewing the DDT investor presentation,

we can understand several key facts about the DNA authentication industry and DDT's
clear superiority.


First, DDT is more global than APDN while competing in some of the same territories:


Source: DDT Investor Presentation


While APDN continues to tout partnerships with obscure companies, some of which seem
especially Valeant-esque to me, like APDN's much touted but apparently unviable UK
partner "Patronus", DataDot has a blue chip customer base boasting impressive market
share in key territories and is aggressively expanding into the US, recently being awarded
a key contract with the US government while recently starting a proof of concept with
another US government authority.

Thirdly, DDT serves a wide variety of industries and also apparently has more revenue
than APDN.

While DDT is clearly a superior company with ~$7.2m in 2014 revenue (in ASD), DDT has
a whopping $15 million market cap (ASD) and $0.02 per share (ASD) valuation. If we
value APDN similarly to superior DDT we see that APDN is -92.62% overvalued with a fair
value of $0.57 per APDN share using generous assumptions.

APDN's Non-Response


Despite having multiple full time IR employees APDN seems unable to answer the phone
for investors. Multiple calls were made over multiple days to try and get anyone from
APDN on the phone but apparently could not be bothered to pick up the phone even once.
I have serious questions that deserve immediate answers so I look forward to hearing
APDN's detailed point-by-point response to what I have expressed here along with the
serious issues my research has uncovered. If I owned APDN stock I would immediately
call the company for answers. Always remember: They are supposed to work for you and,
as a shareholder, APDN is YOUR company. I think any company that does not take this
responsibility is obviously un-investible as I expect any company I invest in to take the
time to speak with me.


As a result of recent, unprecedented hype and paid stock promotion, despite rapidly
deteriorating fundamentals and cash burn, APDN reached the temporary valuation level of
$180m based on an insane 48x APDN's forecasted 2016 revenue.

(table and estimates built using public info)


Not only has APDN never seen this valuation before but last time it got even close APDN
quickly filed an equity shelf registration (preparation to sell stock) on 7/24/2013 and did yet
another large, dilutive equity raise on 10/2/2014 while the stock quickly fell -76.9%
afterward.


Unprecedented, Temporarily Inflated APDN Valuation

Note last time APDN's stock value temporarily approached the current valuation, APDN
immediately fell -76.9% despite incessant press releases about DLA and more vague
"pilot programs". Another way to look at APDN is that before the current DLA hype, APDN
languished with a $10-30m market cap.


We have seen above that APDN's revenue is set to decline next year as the temporary
DLA inspired license fees and revenue expire while at the same time the one-time US
government grants are not repeated. Simultaneously APDN management has guided to
higher expenses through expanding the sales force, which means even worse losses and
cash burn than in the past. As this hype blows over and APDN is not able to ramp revenue
dramatically or drive profitability next year, I would expect APDN to break down back to
past valuation levels or lower. Assuming APDN can avoid bankruptcy, using the current
21.49m shares outstanding and generously using 6x my 2016 revenue estimates puts
APDN stock at $0.98 per share for -87.32% near term downside.


Plungey Makes The Call: APDN Will Be Near Total Wipeout, With -92.62% Near-Term
Downside


APDN Conclusion: "Don't Fall For It."


As APDN's DLA contract failure becomes impossible to ignore and the two non-repeating
US government grants roll off, APDN revenue will never hit the revenue or profitability
metrics investors are expecting. As this hype wears off APDN will find itself desperately
short of cash, facing either another emergency dilutive equity raise at terrible terms, or
swift bankruptcy. With APDN trading at the dot-com bubblicious valuation of 48x
forecasted 2016 revenue there is no downside protection for this obsolete Chinese based
