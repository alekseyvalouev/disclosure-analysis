Newell Brands Inc (“NWL” or “the Company”) uses accounting tricks in order to mask a terrible 


acquisition while creating a windfall payout for management.  We believe that NWL is misleading 


investors in order to hide declining organic sales growth, net income and cashflows, which will 


eventually result in a declining share price as the company struggles with its punitive debt load. We 


initiate coverage of NWL with a price target of $19.16 or downside of 55% 


NWL completed the acquisition of Jarden Corporation (“JAH”) on April 15, 2016.  This acquisition 


saddled the company with substantial amounts of debt, and accounting tricks associated with the 


acquisition have been used routinely to overstate quality of performance while benefitting insiders. 


We believe that the acquisition of JAH was a disastrous decision, and in this report, we will 


demonstrate: 





 NWL used the timing of the JAH acquisition to 


artificially boost operating cash flow (“OCF”), and is 


likely to show big problems in the second half of 


2017, reminiscent of infamous roll up collapse 


Valeant Pharmaceuticals (ticker: VRX). 





 NWL manipulates sales disclosures to overstate 


“core” sales growth for the benefit of insiders and 


misstates the effects of the “slime” fad 





 The fastest growing categories in private labeling go 


head to head with both NWL’s legacy businesses and 


JAH. Likely to result in significant problems for the 


Company

Cash Flow Tricks Not So “New” and Not Done “Well” 


For the full year of 2016, NWL reported OCF of $1.82Bn, a 200% increase over 2015.  This was not due to 


any brilliant new product line by management or significant increase in revenues, it was simply an old 


school accounting trick.  As you can see from the box above, this is because JAH’s product portfolio was 


made up of lots of items that tend to be given as gifts during the holidays. Although for shareholders of 


NWL, this looks a lot less like a gift and a lot more like a burglary.  NWL will struggle to service their debt. 


When one company buys another, acquisition accounting conveniently allows the buyer to stuff all 


acquisition costs into investing cash flows. When a company like JAH spends the first half of the year 


buying and creating inventory in preparation for sales in the second half, this results in significantly 


negative OCF.  The company is building inventories and shipping to large retailers ahead of the holiday 


season, but they have not sold much of it, and have also not been paid for the bulk of what has been 


shipped.  


By timing the acquisition in 2Q16, NWL got to exclude all of this from their OCF statement.  The 


inventory build and cash outflows associated with JAH all get conveniently allocated to the Cash Flows 


from Investing activities.  Then in 3Q and 4Q as that inventory gets sold, the very cash that was spent 


buying JAH’s inventory magically reappears as operating cash flows!  Inventory adjustments were 


responsible for $785mm of NWL’s $1.8Bn in OCF in 2016! 


This is an old trick and has been used by many acquirers to mask a poor acquisition.  This trick was 


pushed to its maximum threshold by the famous roll up Valeant Pharmaceuticals (ticker VRX).  When the 


music stopped on VRX, it dropped over 90%, which we believe is certainly a possibility for NWL.  


While VRX was able to continue the charade for several years, the wheels already appear to be coming 


off for NWL.  In the first half of 2017, OCF fell apart, declining from $336mm in 1H16 to -$241mm in 


1H2017, a nearly 200% decline and almost entirely due to inventory.  


“Jarden makes anything that you would find left behind after a burglary” 


-John Oliver, Last Week Tonight, 11/22/2015 


NWL purchased Jarden on April 15, 2016.  Jarden was itself a roll up of various branded consumer 


goods backed by notable roll up promoter Bill Ackman. It sells branded consumer products like Yankee 


Candle, Crock Pot, Ball jars, Diamond matches, Sunbeam kitchen appliances, and many other brands 


that you would probably be familiar with if you were born before 1975 and remember hanging out in 


your friend’s kitchen. The most common reaction when discussing Jarden in our office was “They still 


make that stuff?!”
3 
 


Management is already changing its tune.  Let’s look at what the CFO had to say about OCF on the 4Q16 


conference call: 





This implies that this was normal cash flow generation with opportunity for improvement (we will get to 


management’s games in the next section), but going into the second half of 2017, they are admitting 


that was essentially false guidance.  


In 1Q17, management continued to mislead the street saying: 





Management can no longer keep up this false narrative heading into the second half of 2017. Let’s see 


what he had to say on the last call: 





How do you go from “feel good” and seeing “opportunity there over time” to saying this is “unusually 


high”?  This is a classic example of bait and switch by management.   


Taking apart the guidance for the rest of 2017, we can see that the situation is only getting worse. The 


CFO said they are now only expecting $1Bn for the full year:
4 
 


Why is $1bn so bad? Well, it’s really showing a decline when observed versus the apples to apples of a 


2016 combined cash flow statement of JAH and NWL. With -$241mm of OCF in 1H17, a full year of only 


$1bn would imply 2H17 OCF of $1.241Bn.  When compared to the 2H16 cash flow of $1.493Bn, this 


shows that management is actually lowering cash flow forecasts by $252mm or a whopping 27%! With 


cashflow declines of 27%, just like VRX, NWL will likely face problems with their over $10Bn in debt. 


Given the retail landscape (to be discussed further later in this report), and historical lies, we do not 


believe that management’s forecasts are at all reliable and holders of this stock should be very worried.  


Cash interest expense is over $300mm a year.  With shrinking cash flows despite slight revenue growth, 


NWL finds itself in a tough predicament.  Credit markets have already begun to take notice as the NWL 5 


year CDS is climbing: 








Many companies that start off borrowing too much money do so when it is affordable.  As NWL’s 


borrowing costs increase it may find itself being unable to refinance at the same low rates. We believe 


that an inability to refinance at tight spreads could lead to huge destruction of equity value.

Rotten to the “Core”, Very Slimy 


NWL regularly discusses its “Core Sales” growth in earnings releases, in fact it is featured prominently as 


the first bullet in earnings releases (which as a non-GAAP figure, is potentially a violation of SEC rules, 


but that’s a different discussion).  This is meant to illustrate to investors what sales are doing after 


adjusting for various one time items, and according to the company “provides a more complete 


understanding”.  The term “core sales” appears 46 times in NWL’s last earnings release, but exactly zero 


times in the same period’s 10-Q.  


In the most recent earnings release, the company defines “Core Sales” as: 


Core sales exclude the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions (other than the Jarden acquisition) 


until their first anniversary, and planned and completed divestitures. 


In fact, Core Sales Growth is a target which has a 50% weight in Mnagement performance goals 


according to the most recent Proxy statement: 


Performance Goals    Weight   Rationale for the Measure 
Core Sales Growth    50%   Incent overall growth 
Normalized EBITDA    50%   Incent profitable growth 
 





However, for the purposes of getting bonuses, management uses a separate definition of “Core 


Sales”.  From the same document: 


Core Sales growth for purposes of the Bonus Plan is calculated on a different basis than 


reported Company financial performance. As noted above, reported Core Sales growth 


for the Company was 3.7%. However, the performance measure used under the Bonus 


Plan differed in several respects, recognizing differences between legacy Jarden and 


legacy Newell Rubbermaid methods of evaluating sales growth. The Bonus Plan metric, 


unlike reported sales, included the impact of acquisitions below 1% of Jarden’s 2015 


sales, and excluded the impact of product line exits. The Bonus Plan calculation also 


included Jarden results for the full year, and adjusted targets to reflect any deviation 


from budgeted results during the period prior due to the completion of the Jarden 


acquisition. For additional information regarding reported Core Sales, see “Appendix A—


Non-GAAP Reconciliation.” 


This likely created a windfall for management.  While using the definition presented to investors, core 


sales growth would have barely passed the target level of 3.6%, using the changed definition 


substantially increased compensation:

This is in addition to huge increases management received, which are apparently a reward for merely 


paying a high multiple and loading the company with debt:

What’s more, the “Core Growth” seen in 2Q17 appears to be driven by absolutely no special effort by 


management while they reap the benefits. While we said earlier that it’s likely you aren’t familiar with 


JAH products if you were born after 1975, you probably aren’t familiar with the “slime craze” if you were 


born before 2005. Making “slime” – a slimy concoction of various household items – has become a huge 


trend driven primarily by social media.  The standard slime recipe calls for a PVA based glue, and Elmer’s 


(a NWL brand) has been a huge beneficiary.   








In June the New York Times ran an article about the trend: 








Also early in 2Q, many consumers noted shortages:
8 
 








However, we now see evidence that the slime trend appears to have hit its zenith in 3Q.  








Google search traffic for both “slime” and “Elmer’s” is showing substantial declines since August:
9 
 








Additionally, Elmer’s has competition.  On office Depot’s website, we can see that while Elmer’s glue 


sells for $1.99, Office Depot is selling its own brand for only 50 cents! Both are equally good for slime 


making, and now consumers have a better value proposition.
10 
 


(This is also evidence of the private label threat that NWL faces on many products, but that is to be 


discussed in our next section) 


Management did not create the slime trend, but that hasn’t stopped them from touting “core sales 


growth”.  In 2Q16, management disclosed Elmer’s revenues of $80mm.  On the 2Q17 earnings call, 


management the CEO said: 








If the overall glue market grew 40%, and Elmer’s took an additional 14% share, that means that total 


Elmer’s 2Q17 revenue could have been as high as $175mm, a very impressive nearly 100% growth, 


which also ties to the huge increase in search activity.  This is also troubling because “Core Sales 


Growth” in 2Q17 was only $93.8mm according to the company’s press release: 





This means that Elmer’s alone could have been responsible for the entire “Core Sales Growth” in 2Q17, 


and management forecasts of growth are essentially tied to what is a declining social media trend.  As 


the slime trend fades, we believe NWL will find it nearly impossible to hit sales growth forecasts.   


As we have seen poor governance and misleading guidance already, we believe that NWL is poised to 


disappoint investors in the second half.  


Brandpocalypse  


It is not new news to anyone that many retailers are suffering. In fact, the term “Retail Apocalypse” now 


even has its own Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_apocalypse. The products sold by 


NWL and JAH are heavily dependent on brick and mortar retailers. According to the most recent 10-K: 


The Company’s top-ten customers in 2016 included ( in alphabetical order ): amazon, Bed, Bath & Beyond, 


Costco, Lowe’s, Office Depot, Staples, Target, The Home Depot, Toys ‘R’ Us and Wal-Mart. 


 



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_apocalypse
11 
 


In addition to the effects of Toys R US bankruptcy, NWL should be impacted by these large customers 


moving more towards private label in effort to increase margins, and therefore presenting competition 


to NWL’s brands. According to Nielsen, consumers are very open to private labeling: 








Let’s now take a look at the threat to NWL.  In core product lines like home Décor and Writing, sales 


have begun to erode at retailers like Bed, Bath and Beyond and Office Depot: 


Bed, Bath and Beyond:
12 
 





Office Depot: 





Meanwhile, sales are growing at retailers offering heavy discounts and investing into private labeling like 


Costco, Target and Walmart.  NWL’s products are ripe for displacement by private label or discounting: 





As we can see from the above, commodity products like markers, kitchen supplies, garbage cans, and 


candles are all easily disruptable as they require no technological advantage in order to produce them.  


Even for the iconic Rubbermaid brand, bins are the fastest growing category in private label:
13 
 


Valuation 


We believe that eroding cash flows and a slowdown in the slime trends, and increasing competition will 


not only cause NWL to disappoint analysts’ earnings expectations, but also divre a significant equity 


price correction due to the huge debt load form a terrible Jarden acquisition.  Free to manipulate results 


for compensation purposes, we think management has shown they will look after themselves and not 


shareholders.  


We use EV/EBITDA as a valuation metric in order to account for the significant debt load. We believe 


that this year is more likely to compare to last year in terms of EBITDA generation but could turn out to 


be worse.  We use an 8x EBITDA multiple to account for the shenanigans and earnings manipulation 


used by management as well as macro headwinds and the end of slime.
