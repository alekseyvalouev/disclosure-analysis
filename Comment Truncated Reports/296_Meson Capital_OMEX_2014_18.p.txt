Odyssey's SEC 10Q: Out Of Cash In Weeks, Neptune Minerals
Declines -94%

Summary


OMEX’s legal 10Q filed with the SEC paints a dramatically different and darker
picture than the vague, hype-filled PR and conference call which is caveated by a
safe harbor disclaimer.


Out of cash in weeks - Legal 10Q: “Our consolidated cash balance at June 30, 2014
was $5.7 million which is sufficient to support approximately two months of
operations”.


Or Get ready for dilution - Legal 10Q: “We may enter into convertible debt deals... At
times, conversion prices could be lower than market price of our common stock”.


Look out Mako & Oceanica - OMEX re-traded and crammed down junior securities
at Neptune Minerals, officially valuing it at $1/share, a decline of 94% from $17.50
last reported.


$10mm marketing agreement “Binding LOI” (an oxymoron) hyped on the conference
call has NOT closed and seems dubious as OMEX does not have title to SSCA
coins.


After Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s Q1 disastrous conference call due
to critical questions piqued by our assessment of the Q1 10-Q (Odyssey Marine: Shrinking
Cash Position Fails To Cover Current Bills, CEO Greg Stemm Must Go), OMEX
management was clever enough this time to release the 10-Q immediately before the
conference call so that nobody would have time to read it and form critical questions. Most
investors don't understand the difference between the 10-Q, which is a legal document
filed with the SEC and the press releases and conference calls. The difference is that lying
in a 10-Q with the SEC can mean serious legal sanctions whereas false statements in a
press release or conference call are protected by a "safe habor" disclaimer: that
boilerplate that few investors read allows companies to basically say anything they want
under the caveat emptor of "forward looking statement." The OMEX Q2 10-Q legal

document and conference call / PR is one of the most divergent we have ever seen. As a
father may tell his daughter interested in dating a boy: pay attention to what he DOES
(SEC Legal filings) not what he SAYS (PR/Conf calls)…


We have made dozens of well researched statements about OMEX, all backed by hard
facts and have included the referenced, public documents linked in those statements. We
have no need here to refute blanket dismissals of those claims with no supporting
evidence made by OMEX management. There are enough new facts to focus on that are
important to shareholders that OMEX management omitted from their vague, hype filled
conference call.


CEO Transition a Step in the Right Direction but Too Little Too Late


First, to give some credit to the OMEX board of directors, we applaud the decision to
remove Greg Stemm as CEO. We advocated this last quarter and are impressed with the
decisive action. Unfortunately as Warren Buffett says, "When a manager with a reputation
for brilliance takes the helm at a business with a terrible reputation, it is usually the latter
that remains intact." The unending losses and unviability of the treasure hunting business
do not provide incoming CEO Mark Gordon an easy task. In addition, former OMEX
employees have recounted to us how Greg Stemm has described COO Mark Gordon as
his "Sock Puppet" does not leave us with a feeling of confidence that Gordon will be able
to hold the house of cards in order for very long after the Founder Stemm has left the
sinking ship.

SEC 10-Q: OMEX language appears to be a CYA for Bankruptcy Filing to be Made
Shortly or Dilutive Equity Raise


If cash inflow is not sufficient to meet our desired projected business plan requirements,
we will be required to follow our contingency business plan which is based on curtailed
expenses and requires less cash inflows. We may also have to revert to capital raises that
include equity and/or convertible debt to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our
consolidated cash balance at June 30, 2014 was $5.7 million which is sufficient to
support approximately two months of operations.... While we have been successful in
generating cash inflows and raising the necessary funds in the past, there can be no
assurance that we can continue to do so in 2014 or the following twelve months. …


We may enter into convertible debt deals whereas our shares may be acquired from time
to time upon conversion of the outstanding debt. At times, conversion prices could be
lower than market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. We previously had
outstanding senior convertible debt that was converted at a discount to market

Longs will no doubt highlight that this was as of June 30, 2014 and since then they have
claimed to draw additional cash from the Fifth Third $10mm credit line and also have a
new $10mm "marketing agreement "Binding LOI". These two sources of cash are only
mentioned in the press release, protected by a 'forward looking statement' safe harbor and
are NOT mentioned in the 10-Q. Unlike in Q1 where the $10mm Fifth Third credit line was
announced and properly documented, these sources of cash appear far more tenuous
and dubious.


Firstly: We accurately predicted that $7.5mm would be the max allowable draw on
the $10mm Fifth Third Credit line back on July 17th (SSCA Inventory Unsealed:
Confirms Disappointing Salvage, Meson's Estimates). Our July 16 bankruptcy prediction
was always caveated on them being unable further draw on this line, they have bought
themselves a few more weeks from now it appears. 10-Q: "At June 30, 2014, the
outstanding loan balance on this credit facility was $7,436,514"


Secondly: We find it highly suspicious that the CFO would announce that they have
made an additional draw on the Fifth Third $10mm credit line given that A) the
Odyssey Explorer is still at sea (returning today) and the collateral needs to be on shore to
allow a further cash draw and B) He was evasive and would not answer questions about
the amount of the credit line draw. Regardless, this amount is likely to be small - perhaps
max $1mm and we will know in the next few days based on the inventory sheets from the
court.


Thirdly: A $10mm loan "Binding LOI" is referenced on the PR but not in the 10-Q. If
it were a material event, it would legally be required to be filed with the SEC. So either: A)
it is NOT material because the only thing "binding" about the LOI is confidentiality or some
other noneconomic issue and there is still substantial uncertainty that the deal will close
(CFO said it would close "in the coming days or weeks" - highly vague) or B) OMEX is
failing to satisfy its SEC filing obligations. A seems more likely. Further, why would any
coin dealer be willing or able to loan money to OMEX, at the brink of insolvency, while it
doesn't even possess title of the coins and those coins already have a secured loan
against them? This is highly suspicious and we believe this loan is unlikely to materialize.


Finally: What exactly does the CFO think "non-dilutive" means? This statement has
been used repeatedly in press releases and conference calls and our version of "non-
dilutive" is "that sharecount will not increase without a commensurate increase in value."
However, we are befuddled what definition is being used at OMEX as the sharecount
JUST in 2014 OMEX has " issued 1,290,155 shares of common stock" (Q2 10Q)

What Ever Happened to the Neptune Minerals Phosphate Project? It just officially
got valued again, down -94% from the last time OMEX updated shareholders!


OMEX has been working on undersea phosphate mining for years now, Oceanica is just
the most recent incarnation of this pipedream that has not been done anywhere
commercially in the world, ever. Neptune Minerals, run by OMEX co-founder and former
CEO, John Morris, was last valued at $17.50/share by management, indicating a
whopping $100m+ valuation for OMEX's stake.


source: OMEX Investor Presentation Oct 2013


We have previously highlighted the unusual structure of the Oceanica capital raise (Do
Mako Investors Realize Their Tenuous Security Position In Oceanica?) that leaves
investors in a very weak security position. With OMEX holding a senior security (the
$10mm receivable for services) and Oceanica insolvent by design, OMEX could in theory
cram down and wipe out the minority shareholders at MAKO or any new investors at their
whim. While some have pointed out they would have no incentive to do this - THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT JUST HAPPENED AT NEPTUNE THIS LAST QUARTER!

SEC Q2 10-Q: "during the three-months ended September 30, 2013, we, along with a
second creditor, loaned funds to NMI of which our share is $500,000...


The note was convertible into NMI's Class A voting shares at $12.00 per share upon
maturity. 26 During April 2014, we modified the conversion feature with NMI whereas,
during April 2014, the note was converted into 5,225 shares of Class A Preferred non-
voting stock. These shares are convertible into 522,500 shares of Class A voting shares
and require no further exchange of consideration for conversion. As a result of the
conversion of the loan into equity, we recognized $522,500 of additional investment in NMI
and appropriately wrote it down to the loss in unconsolidated entity."


Note that including accrued interest this works out to a valuation of Neptune Minerals
shares of about $1.00/share vs $17.50/share previously highlighted by management - a
decline of 94% in value! OMEX's 6.7mm shares would be worth a mere $6.7mm at best
even assuming no liquidity discount. More likely these shares are worthless as we believe
Neptune has ceased material operations.


Conclusion


We agree with one thing OMEX said on the conference call - investors should focus on
facts and not false statements made for personal gain. We have consistently included our
evidence here and have followed up in the comments section to legitimate questions.
Meanwhile, the CEO is now jumping ship and the incoming CEO asks shareholders to
have an "open mind" about what they are capable of while citing project economic
numbers for Gairsoppa with NO EVIDENCE to support it. The FACT is that the company
still lost $10mm/year for the two years while completing by far the most successful project
in its history. If it's true that the Gairsoppa created $67mm cash inflows and only cost
$27mm (implying a project profit of $40mm) - where did the other $60mm of expenses go
during 2012-2013? $60mm is a huge number! If a project is profitable them OMEX should
appropriately account for this in its legal SEC filings but it doesn't because they know this
is without support.


OMEX does some interesting projects but should not exist as a for-profit enterprise, it
exists as a vehicle to enrich insiders who make millions while making vague promises to
shareholders who need to place more "belief" on the legal SEC documents than
management statements protected by safe habor disclaimers. The wrap-up phase for
OMEX's nearly 20 year history of destroying over $190mm of shareholder value appears
