Even Bulls Seem To Agree: AmTrust's Loss Reserves Defy Accounting
Logic

Summary


AFSI's Loss Reserve Triangles Imply Negative Remaining Reserves, Which
Accounting Logic Forbids.


Review of Peers' Disclosures Confirms AFSI Situation Is Anomalous.


AFSI Bulls Ignoring Significant Problem (Despite Independently Computing Same
Amounts!).


BDO & Audit Committee Members Face Significant Risk If They Ignore Reported
Problems.


Independent Investigation Necessary & Increasingly Likely; Could Trigger Significant
Restatement.


AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) has been the focus of two letters from
Alistair Capital in recent weeks.


First, AFSI's Audit Committee received a letter criticizing the Company's accounting and
arguing that AFSI appeared to have material deficiencies with respect to internal controls
for financial reporting.


Then, the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority received a letter that described yet more
accounting problems and highlighted a troubling fact about AFSI's intra-company
reinsurance agreements. Specifically, nearly all of the eligible assets in AFSI's
Bermuda captive reinsurance subsidiary have been pledged to AFSI's US
subsidiaries, leaving the Bermuda captive almost nothing with which to fulfill its
obligations to AFSI's European subsidiaries.


In both letters, an apparent flaw in AFSI's 10-K reserves was discussed as an example of
why AFSI is significantly under-reserved and/or has significant accounting control issues
(or both). For example, the letter to the PRA states:

"AmTrust's reserve deficiency can be seen by converting the Company's calendar
year loss triangles, as presented in its most recent Form 10-K, into accident year
results. Upon doing so, it becomes clear that accident years 2008 and 2009 are
significantly under-reserved because the Company has already paid claims in
excess of the Company's revised estimate of ultimate claim payments for those
accident years, implying negative remaining reserves - an 'accounting impossibility'.


"I believe AmTrust is under-reserved for other accident years as well, but chose to
focus on these accident years because I believe it is the clearest demonstration that
the Company has underestimated its liabilities for claims."


There have been some comments that criticize this analysis, but they fail to provide any
substantive argument for how the critics' methodology is incorrect (or what their alternative
calculation implies).


Instead, AFSI bulls seem to rely on sell-side analysts to justify their positive views. Yet the
bulls seem to ignore the fact that even the sell-side analysts they use to justify their
positive views of AFSI arrived at the same conclusion as the letters' author.


At the same time, it seems the analysts themselves have chosen to gloss over their own
calculations and ignore the fact that AFSI's accounting is, in all likelihood, erroneous.


If (when?) AmTrust finally acknowledges a TWGP-esque reserve deficiency, long holders
will probably be shocked but they shouldn't be. After all, the sell-side was bullish on
TWGP until it was too late as well. In fact, most of them kept buy ratings on TWGP even
as the collapse became increasingly obvious.

Long-time investment banker to the Karfunkels, FBR, included the tables below in their
April 9 note titled "2014 Reserve Analysis: Favorable Read on TRV, XL, AMSF; AIG, AFSI
Neutral". Note that FBR arrived at the same amounts (rounded) for "Unpaid" reserves at
AFSI as what was Alistair Capital computed for "Remaining Net Reserves," including the
critical years of 2008 and 2009. FBR's paid-to-incurred ratios of greater than 100% for
those years confirms this result.


In fact, of the 24 companies in FBR's table below, only one company had a year
where paid-to-incurred was greater than 100%: AFSI.


Each and every one of the other 23 companies FBR reviewed (see the table below) had
paid-to-incurred ratios below 100%, as they should, because exceeding 100% defies
accounting logic.

Note: FBR's tables covering all companies only go back to 2009. AFSI's paid-to-incurred
(revised) also exceeded 100% for AY 2008 (163.7%).


Barron's


If FBR's confirmation of Alistair's calculations does not sway bulls, they could also look to
the Barron's article from May 31, 2014 ("Balance Sheet Risk Makes AmTrust Shares
Vulnerable") which noted AFSI's negative reserves:

Questions about whether the company is under-reserved arise because of some
puzzling accounting disparities: AmTrust and Maiden Holdings show a $400 million
difference in their accounting for the same reinsurance activities; AmTrust's numbers
for acquired reserves differ by $50 million in different parts of its financial
reports;while the latest 10-K's tabulation of loss reserves leaves AmTrust with
negative reserves for some years-an impossible accounting that would mean that
policyholders would actually pay AmTrust millions for claims in those periods.


...


Insurance investors usually study a company's annual tabulation of loss reserves for
each year. But, as noted, AmTrust's 10-K indicates that its reserves remaining after
claim payments for all the years up through 2007 are $95 million more than the
amount for those years plus 2008 -- which if correct, would indicate that
policyholders will pay AmTrust that $95 million on the 2008 incidents.


KBW


In response to the Barron's article, KBW published a note on June 1, 2014 ("Barron's
Publishes Another Negative Article on AmTrust") which implied agreement with Barron's
criticism:


Conclusion


Since FBR, Barron's and KBW all seem to agree with the view expressed in the letters
sent to AFSI's Audit Committee and the PRA -- that AFSI's 10-K reserves imply
(nonsensically) negative reserves for 2008 and 2009 -- the criticism and analysis appear
to be well-founded.


The question now is:


Will BDO and the Audit Committee continue to ignore these obvious problems?


Doing so might to maintain the facade for now, but BDO and the Audit Committee are
likely feeling significant pressure to initiate an investigation since BDO is likely doing their
last audit of AFSI (NYDFS condition) and the Audit Committee members now risk
personal liability via Sarbanes Oxley if they continue to ignore the problem.
