Lentuo International (LAS)
– Obvious Holes Remain in
LAS’ Explanation of
Disclosure and Filing
Obligations
June 5, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary:


We believe Lentuo International (LAS) does not
adequately address the full spectrum of two
undisclosed loans executed in 2013 totaling RMB 250
million  (RMB100M, RMB 150M).
LAS does not even address one of the loans at all
(RMB100 million).
Assertion that Chairman’s “equity interest in the
Company is not pledged as collateral to secure
the RMB150M loan” ignores fact that Chairman
personally guarantees the loan with his assets.
Assertion that the revenue of Company is not
pledged as collateral to secure the RMB 150 loan
ignores fact that revenue from all LAS’s 4S stores are
collateral to loan.
In light of potential risk factors, it is evident that
NYSE/LAS’s auditor need to scrutinize the loan
structures and their potential impact to financial
statements and disclosures made to shareholders.


On May 28, 2014 we published our due diligence findings
on LAS. We provided evidence that a related party
company in Lentuo International’s (LAS) corporate
structure, Lentuo Electromechanical (“LE”), borrowed

money through two trust agreements (Chinese investors)
totaling RMB250 million (RMB150M + RMB100M). These
loans were not disclosed in LAS’s SEC filings. We provided
evidence showing that the Chairman’s assets and the
revenues from ALL of LAS’s 4S car dealerships were put up
as collateral to the trusts loans. We also stated that Lentuo
Electromechanical is likely using loan proceeds to
build/operate 4S dealerships that will compete with LAS.
Lentuo Electromechanical owns 100% of the VIE that
comprises the majority of LAS’s operating units.


After we published our LAS report the company responded
on May 29, 2014 by stating:


“All of these statements are false and
potentially misleading. As the Company’s annual
report clearly disclosed, while LE is controlled by
Mr. Guo, LE is not part of the Company. Any loan
incurred by LE that does not impose any
obligations or liabilities on the Company or its
assets is not required to be disclosed. Mr. Guo
has confirmed that LE incurred one loan with one
trust fund in the amount of RMB150 million in
January 2014, and this loan does not impose
any obligations or liabilities on the Company and
its assets. Neither Mr. Guo’s equity interest
in the Company nor the revenue of the
Company is pledged as collateral to secure
this loan. Based on the above, the Company is
not required to disclose this loan or include it in
the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2013. The Company
believes that it has made full and accurate
disclosure in its annual report on Form 20-F for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 in
accordance with the rules and regulations under
the U.S. securities law.”

We have read many rebuttals of U.S. listed Chinese
companies accused of misrepresentations over the last few
years that we believed dodged the relevant issues. In
keeping with that theme, the comments made in LAS’s
rebuttal contain obvious misstatements that we frankly
can’t believe. Furthermore, investors may want to take
note of what the company did not address. While the
company did admit to the existence of the RMB150 loan, it
did not comment on our RMB 100 million loan findings.
Why?


Once again, we will explore the facts surrounding the loans
that are clearly spelled out in the trust.


Our Full rebuttal:


We understand that LE is not part of LAS but it is in
fact controlled by Mr. Guo.
LAS confirmed the RMB 150 trust loan but did not
mention the other RMB 100 loan. It’s not clear
whether LAS is denying the existence of that loan.
LE raised the RMB 150 million partly to finance its new
Audi Dealership in Beijing (as disclosed in the trust
documents), which should have been disclosed in
LAS’s 20F since LAS has disclosed that it is building an
Audi dealership in Beijing.
We believe consolidation of Lentuo
Electromechanical into LAS’s financial
statements is required. Of particular relevance is
that LAS’s 2013 20F states :


“Furthermore, as our reorganization was
conducted between entities under the common
control of Mr. Hetong Guo, the historical financial
results, assets and liabilities of the affiliated
entities and Lentuo Electromechanical have
been reflected in our consolidated financial

statements as if the current organizational
structure had always existed.”


It is highly likely that the trust loans incurred by LE should
be accounted for or at least disclosed in LAS’s financial
statements.


The RMB 150 million trust loan document clearly
states the sources of collateral: 


“…


a. Source of funds pledged to repay the
loan:


Revenue generated from all 4S stores
(including 4S stores under construction) of
Beijing Lentuo Electromechanical Group Co.,
Ltd.


b. Guarantor:


Beneficial owner of Beijing Lentuo
Electromechanical Group Co., Ltd., Guo
Hetong and his wife provide unlimited joint
and several liabilities.


…”


The trust file states the revenues generated from all
4S stores (including 4S stores under construction) are
pledged as the source of funds to repay the loan. If
pledging the revenues of the 4S stores is not collateral
as stated by LAS in its rebuttal, then what is?
Play on words; The company is clever in its assertion
that Mr. Guo’s equity interest in the Company is

not pledged as collateral to secure the RMB150M
loan. However, Mr. Guo is collateral to the loan
putting all his assets at risk. As stated in the trust
loan file, Mr. Guo and his wife provide unlimited joint
and several liability guarantees for the trust loan. In
the event of default, Chinese investors in the RMB 150
million trust loan could sue Mr. Guo and claim Mr.
Guo’s LAS shares and other assets in court. LAS has
not disclosed this risk factor in its SEC filings.


The other RMB 100 million trust loan carries similar
provisions as the RMB 150 million trust loan and is being
used to build 4S dealerships. We therefore do not
understand why LAS denies the existence of collateral and
the company’s potential exposure to Mr. Guo’s obligations if
he is unable to repay the loans.


Does LE have other 4S stores outside of the ones
owned by LAS that can be pledged as collateral?


We believe that NYSE and LAS’s auditor should review the
facts and circumstances related to the trust loans extended
to LE and guaranteed by Mr. Guo to determine whether LAS
and its shareholders are exposed to potential liabilities if
Mr. Guo fails to meet his obligations. In our opinion, LAS’s
financial statements should be restated to reflect the loans.
