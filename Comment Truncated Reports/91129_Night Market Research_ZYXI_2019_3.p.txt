Summary

ZYXI


We identify UnitedHealthcare as Zynex’s largest payor and estimate it was paying
~7x more per order relative to other commercial insurers, artificially sustaining the
weak underlying business.


We find UHC recently changed its TENS coverage policy which may lower its
payments to Zynex by 80% - equivalent to 40-100% of 2021 EBITDA.


Reimbursement pressure is evident in accounts receivable which ballooned in Q3,
outpacing revenue growth. Days sales outstanding rose to highest level in over 4
years.


Zynex could be forced to modify its revenue recognition and write-down accounts
receivable to adjust for the new policy.

At the same time, Zynex’s CEO will likely continue to tap his 43% stake to meet
substantial personal cash flow needs.

The bull case for Zynex Medical (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:ZYXI, "the Company") is based
on the belief that insurers would continue to pay for its overpriced TENS units and
generic electrodes because waste and abuse is ingrained in the US healthcare system.
"Everyone is overbilling." The idea proved more resilient than we expected. We thought
payors, particularly commercial insurers, would have a better handle on waste and
abuse, especially involving products as unproven and primitive as transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units which are technologically on par with transistor
radios. Skeptics like us believed Zynex would eventually collapse, the only question was
when. We think the end is in sight.

Temporary Payor Vulnerabilities Enabled Zynex Turnaround


We have identified UnitedHealthcare (UHC), the benefits division of parent UnitedHealth
Group (NYSE: UNH), as Zynex's largest payor and primary target of abuse. We
estimate UHC was paying Zynex ~7x more per order relative to other commercial
insurers. We find the insurer recently changed its coverage policy for TENS, which
will cut its reimbursement to Zynex by approximately 80%. Consequently, Zynex
will lose high margin orders that we estimate account for 40-100% of 2021
EBITDA.


Zynex was already showing signs of nearing the limit of what insurers would tolerate,
backing away from aggressive hiring guidance and reducing staff beginning in Q1 2021.
Now after being cut-off by a large source of earnings, Zynex will be left with few options,
none of them good for shareholders. Any meaningful order growth will likely come at the
expense of margins as the average reimbursement per order turns loss making. Zynex
could focus on pockets of high reimbursement, but this means becoming a much
smaller company.


If the stock weren't about to be crushed fundamentally, it will nonetheless be pressured
by CEO Thomas Sandgaard who is selling stock to meet his significant cash flow needs.
In 2020 Sandgaard, whose wealth is tied up in his 43% stake in the company, bought a
3rd-tier English football club that was burning through £1m per month. Sandgaard most
recently tapped his shares in August 2021 ahead of the league's transfer deadline. His
Premier League aspirations will require copious funding underwritten by unwitting Zynex
shareholders.


With the fundamentals and technicals aligned, we think now is a great time to be short
Zynex.


It's important to remember that before Zynex began its rise from an OTC penny stock in
2017, its underlying business was so weak that it was on the edge of bankruptcy under
the weight of a $3m line of credit [Pg. 9]. At the end of 2016, Zynex couldn't even pay
the premiums on its liability, property and auto insurance [Pg. 25].


Then out of nowhere the business improved. Zynex was offering the same unpatented,
archaic TENS unit yet revenue per order nearly tripled from 2016 to 2017 - suddenly the
business was profitable.

UnitedHealthcare Closes Reimbursement Policy Weakness


The improvement was never well explained. After the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted competitive bidding in 2015, slashing Medicare
reimbursements for TENS, public reimbursement policy has remained weak. Sandgaard
claims the upswing was the result of increased market share after the exit of two large
competitors. He's likely referring to an increased share of the workers' compensation
market, which pays TENS claims at levels far above average. We think Sandgaard was
also referring to patients insured by UnitedHealthcare which we believe has been
Zynex's largest single source of high margin revenue since the turnaround in 2017.


We think Zynex's unexpected "hockey stick" growth in 2017 was due to 1) an
increased share of workers' compensation patients and, 2) the exploitation of
reimbursement policy weakness at UnitedHealthcare.


The workers' compensation market might be the last area where the TENS business is
feasible, due to an arcane and poorly controlled reimbursement and coding framework.
While our checks with workers' comp investigators indicate the industry is tamping down
on Zynex's abusive billing tactics, our focus here is on UHC and its new policy which we
think will render the business unviable in its current form.


UHC did not have an official TENS coverage policy until recently. Instead, the insurer
negotiated reimbursement rates and allowable supplies with manufacturers ad hoc.
Sometime in 2017 it appears Zynex was able to negotiate a nonsensical quantity of
electrodes per patient - 64 pairs per month, a figure we confirmed with UHC
employees and patient claim forms.

Exhibit 1 - Supplies as percentage of revenue jumps in 2017


Source: Financial statements


Sandgaard hinted at this during the Q4 2017 call in response to a question about the
increase in supplies revenue (bold emphasis added):


"And then we have also seen that there are some insurance plans that actually
allow for more supplies than we have, we've been able to negotiate in the past.
That's very much a negotiating item and by being able to negotiate well and make
sure that the patients get the supplies that they actually need."


An increased share of workers' comp patients and the new opportunity to dump massive
quantities of electrodes on UHC patients led to major shifts in the company's financials:
supplies rose to 79% of revenue in 2017 after averaging 39% between 2009 and 2016
(Zynex breaks out revenue for devices and supplies). Revenue per order increased
160% Y/Y in 2017 - while device revenue per order decreased. Operating margins,
negative to slightly better than flat in the years prior, jumped to 38%. UHC and workers'
comp propped up an otherwise limp, money losing business.

Zynex exploited UHC's reimbursement vulnerability through 2020, and concurrently
grew its salesforce by roughly 5x which naturally led to order and revenue growth.
Investors saw a rapidly expanding, profitable company with no significant competition.
Sandgaard meanwhile was making reckless projections - at a time when the average
sale rep was generating just above $200K in annual sales, he touted plans of an 800-
person salesforce generating $800m in sales, utterly ludicrous figures for the TENS
market. Zynex stock went from $0.10 in 2016 to nearly $30 in 2020.


Unfortunately for Zynex, UHC eventually woke up. In February 2021, UHC announced
a new coverage policy for TENS effective May 2021 which specifies the quantity of
supplies allowed per prescription. The policy stipulates "usual maximum utilization" is
one or two units of a monthly supply pack which includes electrodes, batteries, and
conductive gel.

Processed Claims Show Policy Effect and Damage to Zynex


Source: UnitedHealthcare


Instead of being reimbursed for 64 pairs of electrodes per patient every month, Zynex is
limited to at most two units of a supply pack.


Our prior work on Zynex, which included interviewing former employees and reviewing
the reimbursement policies of numerous commercial insurers, led us to suspect UHC
was reimbursing Zynex abnormally. This was confirmed when a UHC insured patient
sent us Zynex claims information.


Zynex's standard monthly claim was for lead wires, 2 batteries, and 64 pairs of
electrodes. For the electrodes, Zynex was billing an "MSRP rate" of $49.50 per pair for a
total of $3,168 per month. Over 10 months, the patient received 640 pairs of
electrodes.


Exhibit 4 - 640 pairs of electrodes received by UHC patient over 10 months

When UHC approved the claims, it allowed $0 for the batteries, $14 for lead wires and
almost $520 for the electrodes (UHC pays Zynex the total allowable minus the patient's
copay). Including $250 for the device, Zynex was collecting nearly $5,600 for patients
with UHC commercial health plans over the average 10-month prescription.

After two months, concerned about their co-pay obligation the patient reported the
excessive quantities to UHC which flagged the patient's file and led to denials of 4 of 8
submitted claims. Relevant for Zynex investors is the change in denial reasons.


Exhibit 6 - UHC policy change prohibits abusive coding by Zynex


Source: UnitedHealthcare patient, NMR


As shown in Exhibit 6, UHC had been denying claims due to "incomplete medical
records", meaning Zynex did not provide documentation to support the medical
necessity of 64 pairs of electrodes (note UHC would have paid these claims had the
patient not complained). Two months after the new TENS policy went into effect in May
2021, UHC began denying the claims for improper coding as Zynex was still billing with
the "unbundled" electrodes HCPCS code A4556 rather than one or two units of the
supply pack using the "bundled" code A4595. The use of "unbundled" codes is a
common method of fraud and abuse in healthcare billing.


Two claims were approved for $115.62 without being reviewed to meet regulatory
compliance timelines. Although both are subject to review and recovery, the $115.62 for
6 units of A4595 ($19.27 each) is the best case for Zynex going forward - an 80%
reduction in the rare case UHC pays a claim without review. But the likely outcome is
that both claims will be denied upon review and Zynex will be left with $38.54 for two
units of A4595.


The most recent claim was denied due to "evidence that services have been
misrepresented". Here, UHC reviewed the claim and determined that 6 units of the
supply pack, instead of 1 or 2, was a misrepresentation of provided services.

Using Zynex's stated average reimbursement duration per device of 10 months, we

The Ugly Math: Revenue Loss Equivalent to 40-110% 2021E EBITDA


Not only will Zynex lose revenue - it's margins will be materially impacted. We estimate
the average reimbursement per UHC order was ~5x the ex-UHC average, skewing the
overall average higher and making a big contribution to margins. Using Medicare's fee
schedule, our estimate of commercial insurance reimbursement and our work on UHC,
we estimate reimbursement by payor and worker's comp orders which we think lie
somewhere in the middle:


Exhibit 9 - Estimated average reimbursement per order by payor


Source: NMR estimates


Based on discussions with CFO Dan Moorhead, who told us that UHC is Zynex's
largest source of revenue, and the company's disclosures which note that two
payors make up 37% of accounts receivable [Pg. 16], we think UHC may account
for only 2-5% of orders, but 10-25% of revenue. As such, the UHC orders are highly
capital efficient - Zynex won't be able to simply reduce expenses to offset the lost
revenue.


Exhibit 10 - We think UHC is a small part of orders but larger part of revenue

Exhibit 11 - Equivalent loss estimate for 2021E earnings


Source: NMR estimates


Assuming the new policy cuts UHC reimbursement per order by 80%, depending on
how much UHC makes up of current revenue, it's possible Zynex will be left unprofitable
going forward (Exhibit 11).


Early effects of the new policy are evident in Q3 accounts receivable which rose by
$5.9m Q/Q vs an increase in revenue of $3.8m. Days sales outstanding (DSO)
increased sequentially by 17% to over 60 days, its highest level in over four years.

It Could Get Worse: UHC May Attempt to Recoup Millions in
Overpayments from Zynex


We think the large receivables and DSO increases are at least partly due to lower
collections from UHC, and that Zynex hasn't yet changed its revenue assumptions to
account for the policy. As a result, most of the receivables attributed to UHC in Q3 and
on may not be collectable. If so, Zynex will eventually have to write-down accounts
receivable and restate earnings. Precedent occurred in 2009 when Zynex
underestimated payor discounts forcing it to restate receivables and net income lower
for the year prior by ~50% and 95% respectively [Pg. 41].


While Zynex may not be accounting for the policy in its financials, we think it's reducing
its salesforce and adjusting investor communications in response to the change at UHC
and for what we think is a workers' compensation industry stiffening its reimbursement
protocol.


Consider the narrative shift - coming into 2021 Zynex had over 500 sales reps, the story
was aggressive growth into untapped market share and over 600 reps by end of the
year. At Q1, Zynex reduced its salesforce to under 500, but still expected 600 by year-
end. By Q2, rep headcount was reduced to 450 and year-end guidance was lowered to
550 (Sandgaard attributed the reduction to a "competitive job market" and a "focus on
productivity"). By the end of Q3 the salesforce shrank to 430 and Zynex no longer
planned to make any net additions before year-end.


Also noteworthy was the abnormal amount of discussion on the Q3 call devoted to the
so-called Blood Volume Monitor, a product that received FDA clearance in February
2020 yet has generated zero sales. The increased messaging around this failed device
suggests a dim outlook for the TENS market.


UHC's change of policy was overdue. It's surprising that it took so long since UHC acted
against a Zynex competitor for billing in the same manner, although less egregiously.
We became aware of the situation through a lawsuit filed by the competitor.

Tampa-based EMSI, a private TENS manufacturer, is Zynex's largest competitor and the
only other TENS company in UHC's network. In September 2018, after conducting an
audit of EMSI claims, UHC demanded EMSI stop billing for individual pairs of electrodes
and to instead use the bundled supply pack code. In addition, UHC reduced the
allowable quantity of electrodes per patient from 8 pairs to 4 pairs per month (2 supply
packs).


Exhibit 12 - Excerpt of EMSI vs UHC lawsuit


Source: EMSI v. UHC, 2020


In October 2018, only one month after UHC demanded the coding change, EMSI
"succumbed to the pressure" and began billing only two units of the supply pack. EMSI
has billed with this code ever since, according to an EMSI representative we spoke with.


In July 2019, UHC demanded EMSI repay $5m for almost four years of paid claims with
the unbundled electrode code (A4556, the same code Zynex has been using) or UHC
would "offset" future EMSI claims against this amount. Last year EMSI filed a lawsuit
against UHC seeking an injunction to block the $5m repayment demand (the case went
to arbitration).

Source: EMSI v. UHC, 2020


Several elements of the EMSI case are relevant to Zynex shareholders:


UHC has shown a willingness to attempt to recoup payments from a TENS
manufacturer billing improperly


1.


Not only can UHC litigate for immediate repayment, it can also offset future claims
against the amount owed


2.


EMSI was only billing for 8 pairs of electrodes per month per patient. Zynex was until
recently (or may still be) billing for 8x this amount!


3.


If UHC were to conduct a similar audit of Zynex claims, any overpayment demand is
likely a multiple of $5m considering the quantity difference and that Zynex is larger
than EMSI


4.


We don't know why UHC initially only acted against EMSI and not Zynex even though it
was sending patients 8x more electrodes. Even if Zynex and EMSI negotiated different
contracts with UHC, why allow such wasteful supply quantities to persist? It doesn't
make sense. However, after following Zynex since 2019, we've learned that insurers
move slowly, especially large ones like UHC. Whatever the reason, the EMSI case
shows that once it identifies abusive billing, UHC will pursue the culprits and attempt to
recoup overpayments. So, the penalty for Zynex could go beyond reduced future
reimbursements and include liability for past profits.

Technical Pressure: CEO Forced to Sell Shares to Meet Cash flow Needs


The risk of a repayment demand makes the recent announcement of a 10% cash and
stock dividend seem ill-advised. Rather than conserving cash or making the effort to
move past a teetering business reliant on abusive medical billing by investing in new
technology or M&A, Zynex is spending cash on a reckless attempt to "reward
shareholders" - the largest of course being its own CEO.


The fundamental blow couldn't have come at a worse time for Zynex whose CEO is
forced to sell shares to meet his significant personal cash flow needs.


Sandgaard bought the English football club Charlton Athletic in September 2020. To
fund the purchase, he sold 1.25m Zynex shares two months prior. Charlton was nearly
bankrupt or on the edge of "administration" before Sandgaard took over. At the time, the
club required £1m in cash per month to operate and although the financial strain is
currently lower with spectators once again allowed to attend games - operating a lower-
tier team (Charlton is in League One, the third tier of the English Football League) is an
unprofitable and expensive venture.

Growth Topped Out, Reimbursement Risk in Focus: 75%+ Downside


This is especially so for Sandgaard who has advertised ambitious goals for Charlton,
hoping to take the club to the Premier League within 5 years. Serious EFL fans scoff
(the British press has referred to Sandgaard as a cross between Bon Jovi and the
fictional character David Brent from the mockumentary The Office), but what's important
is that Sandgaard's dreams will require a lot of money and most of his wealth is tied to
his 43% stake in Zynex.


We've already seen Sandgaard's Charlton endeavors leak into Zynex when he sold
$2.7m worth of shares on August 6 as the league's trade deadline was approaching.
Also remarkable is that Zynex stock was supported by an active share buyback program
at the time. Whether or not these discretionary, open market sales were appropriate is
controversial, but Zynex stock is 20% lower since. Another trade window closes on
January 31 and, if the curiously timed $0.10 dividend or $1.5m he is effectively paying
himself on January 21 is insufficient, we expect Sandgaard to tap his shares again.


Consensus revenue and EBITDA estimates for 2022 are $181m (+38% Y/Y) and $38m
(+65% Y/Y), respectively - the street is modeling growth, yet Zynex has stopped adding
sales reps and likely lost its largest source of revenue. We believe both numbers will be
materially cut next year when Zynex is forced to lower guidance and/or disclose
repayment demands. We think the EBITDA figure could be cut by 40% or more based
our view that UHC accounts for a large part of Zynex's profitability (Exhibit 11). To stem
losses Zynex will be forced to cut staff significantly and reduce non-profitable orders
from Medicare and most commercial health insurers. Private competitor EMSI, roughly
half the size of Zynex in terms of employees and revenue, is a model of where Zynex
potentially goes from here.


Where should a structurally unprofitable, one product, no (meaningful) pipeline, growth
challenged company trade?

For illustrative purposes, if we assume UHC accounts for 15% of Zynex revenue, an
80% reduction in UHC reimbursement, and that ex-UHC 2021 revenue of $110m grows
10% next year (fair to optimistic considering the company is no longer making net
additions to its salesforce), a 0.5-1.0x multiple on $126m revenue equates to
~$1.60-$3.30 per share (post stock dividend share count of 38.5m). We think the
multiple range is appropriate considering our stalled growth forecast, remaining
reimbursement risk, and possibility of UHC overpayment clawbacks and accounts
receivable write-downs.
