China Marine Food Group: Auditor's Role in Another Alleged Fraud
Jun. 16, 2010 5:47 AM ET31 comments
by: Chinese Company Analyst


Throughout my past few posts on China Marine Food Group (NYSEMKT:CMFO) (see
here and here), I have implied that the small size and unknown reputation of CMFO’s
auditor, ZYCPA Company Ltd., should give investors pause.


This article takes a far more concerned stance. According to a lawsuit filed in Hong Kong
last year, ZYCPA (or, more accurately, its predecessor firm) and its majority shareholder
were active participants in a series of frauds committed against a foreign investor.
According to the allegations, ZYCPA and the shareholder, Johnny Tang, were not mere
bystanders in the fraud. Rather, Tang was allegedly an active co-conspirator who helped a
Chinese businessman steal HK$108mm from the foreign investor.


My prior post on CMFO’s Xianghe acquisition, as well as Chimin Sang's, provides
compelling evidence that China Marine Food is defrauding investors. Specifically, I believe
that the company is much smaller than its SEC filings indicate. Previously, I simply thought
that the company was able to falsify its financial statements because it was receiving
negligible oversight from its auditors. But if the lawsuit’s allegations are true, the actual
circumstances may be far more sinister.


Primary Documents


There are several primary documents worth reading.


First, here is the Statement of Claim for the lawsuit.


Second, here is a link to a 9-page report written by Target Newspapers, a Hong Kong
business periodical, discussing the lawsuit.


Third, here is a lawsuit for defamation filed by Tang against the foreign investor.


The Lawsuit


Issued on March 23, 2009, the original lawsuit is between Christian Emil Toggenburger,
and two holding companies he owns, against (i) Hung Viet Derrick Luu, (ii) Zhong Yi
(Hong Kong) C.P.A. Company Ltd and (iii) Ka Siu Johnny Tang (the majority shareholder
of Zhong Yi).

Zhong Yi (Hong Kong) C.P.A. Company Ltd is the predecessor to ZYCPA Company Ltd,
CMFO’s auditor. Zhong Yi changed its name to ZYCPA as a result of potential bad press
coming out of this lawsuit.


I will first show a graphic timeline outlining the order of events that transpired during the
alleged fraud.


The cast of characters are as follows:


Christian Emil Toggenberger is the foreign investor who was allegedly defrauded and was
cheated out of HK$108mm.


Hung Viet Derrick Luu is the Chinese “businessman” who allegedly defrauded
Toggenburger and to whom the HK$108mm was transferred.


Ka Siu Johnny Tang is the majority shareholder of ZYCPA Co. Ltd. (successor to “Zhong
Yi (Hong Kong) CPA Company Ltd.”), and actively helped Luu execute the fraud,
according to the allegations. ZYCPA is CMFO’s current auditor.

The Allegations


I will first discuss a summary of the fraud allegations. Then I will focus on the active role
that the majority shareholder of ZYCPA played in the fraud, according to the allegations.


The events that follow are based on the allegations in the lawsuits I provided above,
primarily from Toggenburger’s original lawsuit. Tang has countersued Toggenburger for
defamation. The litigation is ongoing. The following allegations have not yet been proven
in a court of law, and I am merely summarizing the sequence of events as alleged in the
lawsuit.


Warderly Fraud Allegation


The events began when Tang introduced Toggenburger to Luu in November 2006. Tang
represented Luu to be a billionaire entrepreneur who was well-connected in China and
Hong Kong.


Shortly after the initial introduction, Luu and Tang met Toggenburger in January 2007 to
pitch a HK$25mm loan to Warderly International Holdings Ltd, a publicly traded company
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Over the course of two meetings, Luu proposed that
Toggenburger make a convertible loan for HK$25mm. The loan would be convertible to
20%-25% of Warderly’s equity, or pay 2% per month for 2 years until maturity. Warderly
would use the loan to acquire an oil re-processing plant in Beijing from a business partner
of Luu.


Toggenburger agreed to make the investment.


In March and April 2007, Toggenburger lent HK$23mm to an intermediary escrow agent.
HKD$5mm was transferred to a subsidiary of Warderly, while HK$18mm was transferred
to a separate unrelated investment project of Luu’s. Luu promised Toggenburger that the
HK$18mm transfer was temporary and would soon be repaid, with the funds being
redirected to Warderly.


Toggenburger never received any bonds or shares of Warderly. Luu received shares in
Warderly for the contribution of HK$5mm to the Warderly subsidiary, and kept the shares
for himself. The remainder of Toggenburger's investment stayed locked up in Luu’s
separate investment project.


Here is a graphical representation of the flow of funds:

As we can see from the graph, HK$23mm left Toggenburger and was essentially
redirected to Luu.
In April/May 2007, Tang called Toggenburger to say that Warderly “was in trouble” and the
Warderly agreement “was not working out”. Simultaneously, Luu was “in trouble” and
could not repay the money transferred to his investment project.


In May, shares in Warderly were suspended and in January 2008, the Warderly subsidiary
in which Luu had received shares was wound up.


Toggenburger had lost HK$23mm.


Car Racing Fraud Allegation


Our story doesn’t end there.


When Toggenberger found out that his HK$23m investment was lost, he was naturally not
pleased. Tang, however, told him not to worry and that Luu would make it up to
Toggenburger by offering another attractive investment opportunity. Luu had an equity
stake in a racing car project in mainland China, and would offer part of that stake to
Toggenburger at a reduced valuation.


Specifically, in a May meeting also attended by Tang, Luu offered to sell to Toggenburger
a 15% share in a car racing project in mainland China. The 15% stake was valued at
~HK$40mm, according to Luu, but he offered to sell the 15% stake at a discounted price
of HK$16mm to make up for the failed Warderly investment. Luu told Toggenburger that
the car racing project was so profitable that investors would earn a return of 100% on their
investment every 6 months. He also said that broadcasting minutes for commercials to be
shown during car races had already been sold and such cash flow alone was enough for
Toggenburger to get repaid his initial investment within two months.


Tang also claimed that he had seen and checked the documentation for the project (ie.
contracts with Champ Car World Series LLC, the leading US car racing association); that
the project was a good investment for Toggenburger; and that it was the only way for

https://seekingalpha.com/article/210294-china-marine-food-group-auditors-role-in-another-alleged-fraud 5/19


Toggenburger to recoup his losses from Warderly.


Toggenburger agreed.


On May 21, 2007, Toggenburger paid HK$16mm to Zhong Yi as escrow agent, with the
escrow agreement stipulating that the funds would be released to Luu only if the transfer
of certain racing contracts were transferred to the holding company that Toggenburger
was investing in.


The HK$16mm was released to Luu without this stipulation being met.


No car races have been held pursuant to the car racing project. No revenue has been
earned from the car racing project. Toggenburger received no return on his investment.


Toggenburger lost HK$16mm.


Listed Company Fraud Allegation


It still doesn’t end there.


On the last week of May, Luu and Tang introduced a further investment to Toggenburger.
They told Toggenburger that they could assist him to acquire a listed company (ie. a
“shell” company), and that the car racing project or any of Luu’s other projects could then
be injected into that shell. Luu and Toggenberger would ultimately become shareholders
of the listed company.


Toggenburger agreed.


Between June and July 2007, Toggenburger wired HK$73mm to Zhong Yi CPA Company,
Ltd, which again acted as the escrow agent. In July 2007, Luu and Tang introduced
Toggenburger to a firm that introduced Toggenburger to the owners of a publicly listed
shell company in Hong Kong. In October, Toggenburger signed a contract with the shell’s
shareholders to purchase a majority of the shares of the shell.


In December, Toggenburger told Tang and Zhong Yi to transfer the escrowed funds to the
shell’s shareholders. Tang told Toggenburger that there is “some problem”, and the
transfer could not be carried out. Toggenburger was not able to complete the transaction
with the shell’s shareholders.


In February 2008, Tang told Toggenburger that the HK$73mm “was being used in another
account” belonging to Luu. It was “still locked” in Luu’s “other investments”.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/210294-china-marine-food-group-auditors-role-in-another-alleged-fraud 6/19


Zhong Yi, acting as escrow agent, had transferred the funds to Luu and/or used them to
the benefit of Luu, without the knowledge of Toggenburger.


Toggenburger had lost HK$73mm.


As collateral for the HK$73mm, Toggenburger had been given 1mm shares of China Oil
and Methanol Group Inc., a company incorporated in Nevada. On June 23rd, 2007, Luu
took Toggenburger on a day trip by car to Guangdong province and showed him 3
refineries, which Luu said were assets belonging to 3 of China Oil’s operating subsidiaries.


Ultimately, it surfaced that China Oil has no operating subsidiaries, does not own any
industrial complexes and is not earning any revenue.


In total, Toggenburger was cheated out of HK$108m, according to the lawsuit:


Tang’s and Zhong Yi’s Roles in the Fraud


As can be seen from the above events, Tang allegedly played an active role in the frauds.
He was present in many of the meetings between Luu and Toggenburger. He also
allegedly made a variety of untrue claims that were fraudulent in nature.


In two instances, his majority-owned firm, Zhong Yi CPA, acted as escrow agent between
Toggenburger and Luu. In both instances, Zhong Yi allegedly violated the terms of its
escrow agreements and transferred funds to the benefit of Luu and to the detriment of
Toggenburger.


In the car racing project, Zhong Yi CPA was contractually obligated to hold in escrow
Toggenburger’s funds until certain racing contracts were transferred from Luu’s entity into
another legal entity that Toggenburger was indirectly investing in, and certain other
conditions pursuant to “closing” were met. Zhong Yi allegedly transferred the funds to
Luu’s benefit without these conditions being met.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/210294-china-marine-food-group-auditors-role-in-another-alleged-fraud 7/19


In the listed company fraud, Toggenburger transferred HK$73m to Zhong Yi for the
purpose of investing in a listed shell company. Zhong Yi instead allegedly transferred the
funds for the benefit of Luu. When Toggenburger asked for the funds to be transmitted to
the owners of the shell company, Tang told him that there was “some problem” and that
the funds were locked in Luu’s investments.


Tang also represented that he had viewed the car racing contracts with Champ Car, as
well as the land title agreements to land near the car racing project to which Luu planned
to develop properties, and to which Toggenburger was to receive interests. Instead, the
Champ Car contracts were allegedly materially misrepresented to Toggenburger, and the
land titles didn’t exist.


Tang was present in many of the meetings between Toggenburger and Luu, and
recommended Toggenburger to invest funds with Luu. He was also responsible for
originally introducing Toggenburger to Luu.


Conclusion


The same man who owns a majority stake in ZYCPA is alleged to have actively aided the
defrauding of a foreign investor out of HK$108m. Johnny Tang is one of two partners at
ZYCPA and its majority owner.


Investors should not be merely concerned that CMFO is receiving inadequate oversight
from its auditor. They should be concerned about whether ZYCPA is actively aiding China
Marine Food management in falsifying its SEC financial statements. As discussed in
previous posts, the business claims made by Xianghe are simply not possible. The
Xianghe financial statements are very likely falsified in my opinion.


These same financial statements, as well as the financial statements of China Marine
Food, are audited by ZYCPA.


Disclosures: At the time of writing, I have a short position in CMFO.


In no part of this post do I attempt to provide false or misleading information. The
discussion of events in this post are primarily based on allegations in a lawsuit from March
2009, which I've included in the post. This lawsuit is ongoing and none of the allegations
have been proven in a court of law.
