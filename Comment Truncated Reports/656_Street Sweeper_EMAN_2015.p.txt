eMagin: Imagine This Stock Collapsing Below $1

by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Considering the most bullish projected 2015 earnings of $0.03 per share, EMAN is
trading at an astounding ~100 times earnings.


Already struggling with a product issue that left one customer "not interested" in its
microdisplay, EMAN has just lost a Navy contract to its greatest little rival, Kopin.


EMAN’s thin, thin profit - after nearly two years of losses - can't erase the falling
revenue last quarter versus the same-quarter 2014, and full-year 2014 versus 2013.


Institutional holders have recently been selling out or decreasing positions in EMAN,
including two well-known institutions.


Looking for all the world like a virtual reality gamer, eMagin Corp. (NYSEMKT:EMAN) has
been virtually running in place ever since the introduction of its first microdisplay 14 long
years ago.


And now one of the OLED (organic light emitting diode) display maker's greatest rivals has
reached across and hit eMagin's reverse button… stealing a Navy contract right out from
under its nose.


This - and additional adversity - will likely squash the almost flat revenue anticipated for
2015. Though eMagin (pronounced imagine) just turned a slight profit after seven straight
quarters of losses, these challenges suggest it may have a tough time hanging on to that
oh-so-tenuous profitability.


Investors may check out other viewpoints here, which include bullish points such as
eMagin may gain government contracts, develop advantages over rivals and find more
growth opportunities. The company has not returned TheStreetSweeper's request for
comment.


Meanwhile, we'll hit the top reasons eMagin's virtual shoot-out will likely end badly. We're
looking for the stock price to drop below $1 because:


1. Yowza! Trading At 100 Times Earnings?!?

The most bullish analyst estimates EMAN's earnings will reach 3 cents per share for the
year. So that means investors are paying an astronomical 100 times more than the
earnings they expect to receive.


That's a lot considering the fact that EMAN is a little OLED microdisplay maker with
declining revenue - not one of the highflying biotechs working on a cure for cancer. We'll
save the multiple we're generously projecting for EMAN for the conclusion of this article.


2. Ouch! EMAN's Little Rival Nabs Military Contract


One of EMAN's greatest rivals, Massachusetts-based Kopin Corp. (NASDAQ:KOPN), just
pulled off a stunning upset. The rival announced a US Navy production order for its high-
brightness color SXGA displays for full-color, helmet-mounted display products for MH-60
helicopters.


Kopin stated its SXGA color display is the first microdisplay allowing full-color advantages
in aviation helmet-mounted displays. Lack of full color is a distinct disadvantage with
EMAN's prototype, though EMAN plans to add blue soon, according to this Upload article.


Military customers are vital to EMAN, of course. Hopewell Junction, NY-based EMAN has
won several Army and Navy microdisplay agreements, though most have been completed
in the last couple of years. Filings state one $6.3 million deal reached in 2014 remains
alive, but will die out completely in 2016.


EMAN certainly cannot afford to lose a single contract.


3. Contract Problems Began Earlier


The Kopin deal may or may not be tied to EMAN's earlier customer problems. Three
customers stopped shipments last year due to an apparent wire bonding problem in
EMAN microdisplays. Two clients resumed shipments, but the third customer is now "not
interested," according to EMAN.


EMAN has been trying to meet that customer's requirements. But, let's face it, it doesn't
sound promising. See the filing note on page 45 here, especially noting the last line:


"It is reasonably possible that eMagin will incur a future loss once the terms of the
proposal are finalized."


EMAN is learning the priceless lesson that one disappointed customer can sucker-punch
a company and leave it reeling for a long, long time.

4. Real, Robust Rivals


Kopin is just one of numerous large and small companies, nipping and thrashing away at
the very same market opportunities pursued by EMAN. Here's EMAN's link mentioning the
"highly competitive" industry packed with rivals such as:


Yunnan OLiGHTEK Opto-Electronic Technology Co. (Olightek) in China and
MicroOLED in France, the Sony (NYSE:SNE) division in Japan and Himax
Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) in Taiwan.
New York-based Vuzix Corp. (NASDAQ:VUZI), and private, San Francisco-based
Osterhout Design Group.


Quickly comparing EMAN with a couple of competitors shows the company has performed
worse than Kopin in half of the metrics and nearly as poorly in the other half… and worse
than Himax in all metrics:

5. Reality of EMAN's Virtual Reality: A Mixed Bag


CEO Andrew Sculley recently commented about potential partners' or customers' positive
reactions to EMAN's headset prototype as the company tries to attract a manufacturer to
produce a consumer product. But the prototype may not be hitting all the right buttons with
everyone.

Recent reviews during the Consumer Electronics Show by Virtual Reality Reporter
indicate the Osterhout Group's screen resolution, user-interface and overall experience
vaulted that new release into preferred status, though tempered by price concerns.


Reviewers also indicate Oculus Crescent Bay impressed with its display resolution and
immersive experience. They also liked Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Gear VR and the
affordable $99 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Tech - Go4D for use on all
smart phones.


While EMAN's most recent prototype apparently wasn't shown at this year's Consumer
Electronics Show, investors can see that EMAN's rivals have acquired a certain status.


The author of a June 9 Upload article tried and liked eMagin's newest prototype, but noted
some distinct negatives. Along with the currently missing blue LED, eMagin's display
cords would fall out unless its Dan Cui held them in place when the reviewer moved his
head. Also, the headset's headtracking was not ideal, though Mr. Cui said an add-on could
produce positional tracking that could improve gamers' experience.


A Seeking Alpha author also offers a nice comparison of the head-worn-wearable
components of EMAN and several other companies, here, suggesting EMAN offers
nothing extraordinary.


6. Institutional Investors Bow Out


Uh-oh, institutional investors appear to be discovering EMAN's negatives, too. It's always
a good idea for average investors to be on the alert if more institutional holders are selling
a stock than buying it.


That's exactly what is happening to EMAN:

Institutional holders that dumped their EMAN shares as of March 31 include Robert W.
Baird & Co. and Deutsche Bank. Altogether, 16 institutions unloaded some or all of their
holdings for a total of 100,873 shares sold, pretty close to double the number institutional
holders bought. Not a good sign.


And that unfortunate selling trend may link to another unsettling reality… revenue slips.


7. Slipping Revenue: Putting Income In Perspective


After almost two years of operating losses, EMAN last quarter reported income of
$320,000. That's great. But before we start imagining piles of pennies in EMAN's future,
let's take off our virtual reality headsets and grab a dose of actual reality.


Pushing through the Securities and Exchange Commission filings, investors can see
revenue is actually slipping. Down, down, down, down. Accumulated losses are going up,
up, up, up… to $207 million.


Check out last quarter revenue versus the same time a year ago, below:


And revenue dropped by over $2.2 million in 2014 versus 2013, almost as much as the
$2.6 million drop from the year before:


(Sources: SEC filings, here, here)


While we applaud EMAN for cutting enough costs to help it lightly step into net income last
quarter, companies cannot just cut their way into long-term profitability. They have to do
just the opposite of what EMAN has done lately… groooow revenue.


8. More Reality: Unsustainable Upward Trend


Over the last four months, EMAN appears to have been extremely overbought, reaching
an unsustainable excessive uptrend that occurs only 5 percent of the time. So, according
to NASDAQ, investors can expect the stock to turn sideways or drop.
