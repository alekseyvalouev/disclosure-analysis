Executive Summary
Spruce Point Is Short Caesarstone 
(CSTE) For the Following Reasons:


4


Our Independent Lab Tests Show CSTE’s Samples May Contain Less Quartz Than Advertised : We ordered 


product samples directly from CSTE (along with samples from 7 competitors) and sent them to a material testing lab. 


Our tests suggests that CSTE’s quartz countertops contain approximately 88-89% quartz vs. the 93% advertised 
industry benchmark. CSTE’s samples contained among the lowest % of quartz among all of the samples tested. In light 


of CSTE’s rising quartz costs, it is possible that it is mitigating price increases by including less quartz. Numerous 


product quality complaints about chipping / staining may also support our conclusions


SEC FOIA Request For CSTE’s Quartz Contracts Show Substantial Cost Pressure: CSTE’s confidentiality period 


for its key quartz supply contracts lapsed on Dec 31, 2014. A FOIA was quickly filed and found that quartz, its key raw 


material cost for its quartz countertops, rose substantially by ~20% in 2014, yet they told investors in its SEC filings the 
impact was just 4%. Before acquiring these documents, CSTE used to request a 1yr confidential period, now they have 


requested 5yr confidential period coverage (what are they hiding?). CSTE just invested $115m to open its new U.S. 


production facility and has indicated it still does not have long-term quartz supply agreements, exposing them to 


increased margin pressure


Dependent on Positioning itself as “Premium,” Competition Rising Fast:  CSTE prominently touts its quartz 


product as “premium” and lists it as the #1 key investment highlight in its investor presentation. In light of our lab testing 


results, and commoditized nature of its products, we believe this positioning may be misleading. With little more than 
style being the main product differentiator, we find it difficult to believe CSTE can maintain its prices while new 


competitors from China and Europe enter the U.S. market at lower price points up to 25% less. The recent Chinese 


Yuan devaluation will add further price pressure. We obtained dealer price quotes to support our claim of price 


pressures. Further, we note that CSTE’s R&D headcount and margin have been shrinking every year and its largest 
competitor, Cosentino has launched a new super premium material called Dekton. Early indications show it is gaining 


rapid traction

Questionable Market Share Gains: CSTE's story to investors is that its North American market is growing, and it is 


gaining market share. It cites a custom, paid-for, research provider paid for by CSTE called Freedonia Market Research. 


Since 2010, the report indicates its market share in Australia has declined, Canadian market share has been flat (2012-
2014), but that it is gaining significant market share in the U.S. - up from 14% in 2010, to 19% in 2014. Ascertaining true 


market shares are difficult given all are private companies (ex: CSTE), so we sourced proprietary U.S. import shipping 


data collected from port documents. Since CSTE is Israeli-based and dependent on importing to the U.S. market, we 


believe our data is highly reliable, and it indicates that its market share may not be growing
Spruce Point Sees 40% – 75% 
Downside In CSTE Shares

Auditor Concerns, Signs of Financial Strain: CSTE is audited in Israel by Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer. Two 


recent inspection reports revealed audit deficiencies including failure to perform sufficient procedures to test 


revenue and test the existence of inventory. Upon closer inspection, we find CSTE has abnormal days sales 


outstanding, payables, and inventory turnover ratios relative to peers


Cracks in the Story, Massive Overvaluation, Majority Owner Liquidating: CSTE’s price recently corrected after 


Q2’15 earnings beat Wall St. estimates, but it cut its sales range from $515-$525m to $495-$505m, while 


maintaining its EBITDA guidance. We believe this is the canary in the coal mine, and CSTE’s EBITDA margins 


appear overstated. CSTE is at risk of missing its goals in light of flat import tonnage growth and rising competition.


CSTE trades at 3.4x and 13.5x 2015 Sales and EBITDA, respectively, a huge premium to building products peers at 


1.3x and 12.0x on the premise it can maintain share and grow sales 15% p.a. We believe CSTE should trade at a 


discount to peers of 8x - 10x EBITDA given our concerns about product + earnings quality (sales growth slowing + 


margin pressures), its shares would be worth $11 - $29 (40% – 75% downside) on a normalized EBITDA margin 


range. Since its 2012 IPO, its shareholder has reduced ownership from 79.0% to 32.6%; we expect continued sales


Unquantifiable Product Liability for Silicosis-Related Deaths: CSTE is a party to a growing number of lawsuits 


related to death and injury as it relates to injuries suffered by workers and fabricators of its products in Israel (from 


14 in 2012, to 60 today). A single plaintiff and motion for class action certification alleges a $56m damage. CSTE’s 


insurer said it would only be partially covered, thus exposing CSTE to a material risk. CSTE is also in the process of 


opening its new facility in the U.S. and OSHA has recently warned about the dangers of silicosis, specifically 


highlighting issues in Israel. Increasing regulatory scrutiny could drive up its cost of doing business

Margins May Be Significantly Overstated:  CSTE’s gross margins of 42% are substantially higher than its peers in 


the building products sector which average 22%. Because it is the only publicly traded quartz countertop company, it 


is difficult to disprove its margins. However, we’ve pulled private financials for Cosentino S.A. (largest Spanish 


competitor) along with other private financials for Italian stone and countertop makers and find that CSTE’s margins 


appear vastly superior. We’ve also obtained CSTE's Australian and Singapore subsidiary filings which indicate gross 


margins of 24.7% and 31.6%, respectively. We believe currency effects are masking up to 7% gross margin erosion. 


We also find its raw material costs to revenues to be abnormally low. There are also many related party transactions 


with its largest shareholder that could enable operating margin overstatement. We also question CSTE’s distribution 


deal through IKEA, which is inconsistent with its premium brand image and carries lower margins

Samples Obtained Directly From Caesarstone Samples We Tested


We obtained samples directly from Caesarstone to test the 93% quartz content claims
Lab Testing Results Suggest CSTE’s 
Countertops May Not Contain 
The Advertised Quartz Content


9


• A majority of quartz countertops in the marketplace, including Caesarstone, advertise their products as 93% quartz


• We collected quartz countertop samples from a 8 different manufacturers and engaged the Rutgers University Department of Mate rials 
Science & Engineering to conduct a Thermogravimatric Analysis (TGA). Two runs were conducted on each sample 


• In order not to bias the researcher, we did not inform the lab which brand we were investigating 
• Simply stated, a TGA analysis involves putting the samples in a furnace and raising the temperature to 600


o
C where the inorganic 


materials such as resins would burn off at high temperatures, and reveal the indicative quartz content 
• A countertop with 93% quartz would experience a weight loss of approximately 7% (greater weight loss = less quartz content). As can 


be seen from the table, two Caesarstone samples ranked among the highest average weight loss at 10.5% and 11.3%, indicating 
that its quartz content was 3.5 – 4.5% less than advertised. The only sample that performed worse was one of the Chinese import 


samples from Element Quartz!

Thermogravimatric Analysis (TGA)

Caesarstone samples test poorly against competitor samples:


• The graphs below presents the graphical results of the TGA Analysis for Run 1 and Run 2, respectively.  As can be seen the samples all 


achieve a baseline Wt. % Loss at about 500oC meaning the majority of all the organic content has been completely evolved,  hence 
comparison of the values at 600oC to add an additional level of confidence  


• One notable event occurs for the Cambria sample in Run 1 at about 750oC, this is likely some form of phase transformation present in one 
of the inorganic Quartz materials, sometimes known as calcination when a carbonate group is evolved from an inorganic mineral .  It is not 


present in Run 2 and irrelevant for this analysis
• Ultimately, it is the expert opinion of the Testing Lab that there are statistically different values between the average binder content in these 


samples.  It is outside the realm of their expertise to understand how the amount of resin binder improves the overall quality of a Quartz 
synthetic countertop.  However, one can speculate that the true engineered quality component of the countertop structure is l ikely the resin 


material and the more that is used the more the overall properties can be tailored to achieve a final result beyond aesthetic qualities

Warning: CSTE Offers Conflicting 
Explanations For Margin Contraction


14(1) Disclosed or implied from SEC 20-F Filings


2014 Annual Report (page 43):  “In 2014, gross profit 


margins decreased mainly due to unfavorable exchange 
rates, increased IKEA business related to fabrication and 


installation activities, which comes with lower gross margin 
and a non-recurring $3.5 million credit to cost of revenues 


from 2013.” 


And later a slightly different story (page 49): “..cost of 
revenues increased primarily due to volume increases and, 


to a lesser extent, due to the IKEA installation and fabrication 
component. Also contributing to the increased cost of 


revenues were the elevated production levels of our 
differentiated super natural collection, which, despite 


incurring a premium in price from consumers, carries higher 
manufacturing costs, and an increase in quartz raw material 


prices” (1)


Annual Report (page 35): “The price of quartz was relatively 


stable until 2013. However, given increasing global demand 
for quartz, quartzite prices increased by approximately 4%


in 2014 and have increased at approximately the same 
rate in 2015. Any future increases in quartz prices may 


adversely impact our margins and net income.”


CFO on the Q4 Conf Call: “Quartz prices went up and that 
caused around less than 60 basis points impact on gross 


margin for Q4. In 2015, we expect some additional pressure 
from quartz pricing, again, not much less than 60 basis points.”

What is really driving margins; FX, dilutive IKEA deals, Quartz; can CSTE precisely explain? Or is this another potential red flag of 
further margin contraction?

Stone Fabricators (CSTE’s Main Customers) Are 
Worried About Margin Contraction


15


• CSTE supplies its products primarily to fabricators, who in turn resell them to contractors, developers, builders and consume rs. CSTE 


says in its 20-F, “Direct sales accounted for 86.6% of revenues and are mostly to fabricators.” 


• It is critically important to understand what fabricators are saying about the state of the market, and not just take what the 


company says at face value


• According to Stone World’s 2015 Fabricator Survey:


• The percentage of fabrication shops processing both natural stone and quartz surfacing has remained consistent for the last three 
years at 78% in 2014, 79% in 2013 and 76% in 2012


• The percentage of fabricators indicating that small margins are their greatest challenge increased from 26% to 37% (2014 – 2015) 
• When asked about the level of competition in the stone market, 41% said it increased vs. 2013 while 42% say it stayed the same


• If CSTE’s largest customer base is worried about smaller margins, what do you think CSTE is also worried about?

“I have had the black Caesarstone 


installed 6 years ago. It has chipped in 3 
places no impact either. It has one scratch 


in it. It has dulled out. I would never buy 
this product again”


“I work at a marble shop. Caesar stone 


have problems on slabs from time to time. 
I say 10-20% of the time. Their customer 


service is non-exist”


“Can’t say anything good about my brown 
Caeserstone countertops. I have white 


pitting marks that range from a pin head 
size to a pea size all over two of my 


counters”


“My whole experience with the installers and the 
Caeserstone reps has been a joke but I am not 


laughing.


“In my previous apartment, where I lived for 6 
years, I had granite countertops, and I didn’t 


have any problems. I so much regret that I 
choose this Caesar stone. I am trying to get it 


replaced, but I am not sure I will be successful. I 
am telling all my friends and people I know 


never to choose Caesar stone and I want to 
warn anybody who comes across this post to be 


aware of sub par quality of Caesar stone”


“I think Caestarstone is a beautiful product. It 


looks great and the warranty sounds 
great. But I would NOT recommend this 


product at all. I truly regret my decision to 
install this product in my kitchen”


“The countertop looks fabulous WHEN it is 


clean. However, cleaning it is quite a process. The 
countertop shows watermarks, streaks from the 


"method" cleaner they recommend and scratches are 
very visible. The countertops also chip VERY easily”


“Be wary of using this product for two reasons. It 


stains and scratches easily and they will not sell to 
licensed contractors, only certified fabricators”


“I had the Caesarstone rep come to our home 


twice. Both times he worked on several spots with 
his bag of tricks. So I learned how to eliminate 


spots, but they just keep coming day after day. AND 
THESE ARE WATER SPOTS!!!” 


Bottom line, don't believe the CS hype - if a 


cellphone leaves an imprint, that tell's it all! I would 
never purchase this product again. If anyone thinks 


that the CS warranty covers everything - guess 
again.

Outrageously High Gross Margin Relative to 
Leading U.S. Building Products Peers


Suspiciously Low Raw Materials / Revenues vs. 
Foreign Stone and Countertop Makers

• As a producer of a commoditized building products, CSTE’s gross margins are outrageously higher, with no clearly 


identifiable reason, than any publicly traded U.S. company tied to housing products including doors, pools, windows, 


decking, flooring and ceilings, and cabinets


• CSTE competes directly with foreign private companies, so we pulled financials for leading stone manufacturing and 


countertop makers in both Spain and Italy. Due to differences in financial reporting standards, we compared CSTE’s 


disclosures of raw materials usage to total revenues, and found they reported a materially lower margin

Significant Margin Erosion Appears To 
Be Masked by FX Benefit


22


Note: As provided by company SEC correspondence, Australian sales take place in US$ and as such there is no impact of currency 
exposure to Australian and USA sales.  Currency depreciation assumptions from Q2 -14 to Q2-15: Shekel 0.2886 to 0.2583, C$ 0.9170 to 


0.8132, EUR 1.1372 to 1.1063.  This analysis is for illustrative purposes.


Real margins would be
Approximately 3.7% – 5.0% 


lower than reported
and although


Caesarstone will
continue to realize a
currency benefit over


2015, we believe that
margins will continue


to face headwinds
going forward


• In the recent quarter, CSTE provided commentary about revenues on a constant currency basis. For example. Its headline boasted, 


“Revenue Up 9.9% to a Record $127.5 million, up 20.2% on a Constant Currency Basis” 
• However the Company does not indicate the precise effect foreign currencies had on gross margins or EBITDA


• Our pro forma analysis attempts to adjust CSTE’s gross margins to illustrate what they would look like if there were no change in currency 
year-over-year. We make some assumptions about the percentage of Cost of Goods Sold incurred in the Israeli Shekel, where a majo rity of 


its manufacturing took place
• By removing the FX effects, we estimate that CSTE is facing significant margin erosion in its core business. We will detail why we 


believe this is the case in the coming slides
• It is worth noting that CSTE recently cut its sales guidance range to $495m to $505m (from $515m to $525m) while holding its 2015 EBITDA 


forecast unchanged and cited “slightly lower-than-expected U.S. growth and the further negative impact of foreign exchange rates” as the 
reason for the guidance reduction. However, a closer look suggests that the FX effect masked underlying margin erosion in itsbusiness

We sourced quotes from dealers for some basic Caesarstone Classico designs (originally introduced in 1987). Since 


then, the company has introduced three additional product collections, Concetto, Motivo and Supremo, which are 


marketed as specialty high-end product collections. Our basic price quotes came in around $1,600 - $1,700 (pre-tax) for 


a basic countertop with sink cut out.

Pental Quartz Q From MSI


We sourced quotes from dealers of three competing brands and found substantially lower price estimates, upwards of 


25% less than Caesarstone’s prices. Prices ranged from $1,287 to $1,427 for the exact same project and dimensions. 


What was more perplexing, some dealers indicated to us that Caesarstone had recently raised prices by a couple 


percent even in the face of lower priced entrants.

order to inflate its margins and ultimately its stock price. We observe that the Kibbutz has sold its stock through secondary issuances 


since coming public twice already, netting it approximately $260m

Israel Society of Pulmonology Israel Ministry of Health 


• Silicosis is an occupational lung disease that is progressive and sometimes fatal, and is characterized by scarring of the lungs and 


damage to the breathing function
• CSTE is party to 60 pending (up from 41 a year ago and 14 in 2012) bodily injury lawsuits that have been filed against it directly 


since 2008 in Israel or that have named it as third-party defendants by fabricators or their employees in Israel, by the injured successors,

certain fabricators and their employees in Israel.
• Most of the claims do not specify a total amount of damages sought, as the plaintiff’s future damages will be determined at t rial; 


however, damages totaling approximately $22.3m are specified in 55 of the claims currently pending against us in Israel (excluding the 
claim that is seeking class action recognition)

• CSTE has an unusual and significant spread between its DSO and DPO. The spread of 30 at year end 2014 was 


the widest in the past 4 years. This suggests that CSTE is trying to stretch out its payables as far as it can to generate 


temporary cash from operations and may be having trouble collecting from its customers 


• Analysis of U.S. Building Products Peers:  Suggest a normalized DSO and DPO is around 33 – 35 with minimal

• Caesarstone often touts its “World Class Manufacturing and R&D Capabilities” to “maintain innovative and leading

In November 2013, CSTE announced it would accelerate its initial investment of its US manufacturing facility, which 


was originally planned to cost $100m. As of its latest 20-F filing, the expected costs have risen to $115m. However, 


our greater concern is that CSTE is expanding its manufacturing into a rapidly saturated market where there are 


already 4 major producers in North America, and more than a dozen imports.

CSTE Announces IKEA Partnership


Our Take On This Deal


• Highly inconsistent with CSTE’s “premium” branding strategy 
to sell through a low cost retailer such as IKEA


• CSTE gets limited/no brand exposure with this deal. Our visits 
to IKEA revealed no in-store exposure that CSTE’s brands 


were being sold; similar to catalogue exposure (left)
• Sales through IKEA lower CSTE’s gross margins because 


CSTE has to bear the cost of fabrication and installation
• We believe the IKEA deal may support our case that CSTE’s 


gross margins are too high, and the deal could be used to 
explain away CSTE’s margin deterioration
