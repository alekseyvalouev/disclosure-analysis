Cyberdyne Is The Most Ridiculously Priced Stock In the World.  
Japanese Investors are ADVISED to  


EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION 


Target Price: 300¥ -- 85% Downside 





With its share price ~ 2,000¥, Cyberdyne’s market cap exceeds $4 billion USD. 


The story of Cyberdyne MUST be told to the worldwide investment community. 


Cyberdyne (TYO:7779) CEO Yoshiyuki Sankai has become a cultural icon in Japan. With his “mad 
scientist” appearance and his lifelong passion for robots, he has become the face of innovation 


and science in Japan…..But what is the truth? 
 
While Sankai’s creation of the HAL® (Hybrid Assistive Limb) was unique and creative in 2005 
(named one of Time Magazine's most amazing inventions of the year,) -- time and competitors 
have eclipsed Cyberdyne; the company has yet to effectively commercialize any product. 
Worse, when you get past the rhetoric, propaganda and press, you find a company that is more 
interested in making a “Gundam Stock” rather than an underlying business of authentic value.  
 
Citron first became aware of Cyberdyne when normally bullish Japanese equities investor Seth 
Fischer cited Cyberdyne’s valuation as “unrealistic” during a recent Sohn Hedge Fund 
Conference in Japan.  


http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-01/japan-bull-fisher-says-short-cyberdyne-as-valuation-
unrealistic 


 
While we found Fischer’s valuation argument to be beyond compelling, we knew there had to 
be a reason HOW the stock ever got to these nonsensical and ridiculous levels … which is 
precisely what Citron explains to the investing public below.

Before going any further into the story, let’s have a look at 


Cyberdyne’s ugly operational results: 





 
 
At the time of Cyberdyne's IPO, it was noted that:  “The company expects to post sales of 469 
million yen for the year through March, up 60% from the previous year. For the following fiscal 
year, it sees sales jumping 200-300% [e.g. 1.4 -1.9 billion yen].” 
 
However, total revenues for 2015 amounted to just ¥631 million, an increase of just 35%. For 
2015, Cyberdyne posted a net loss of ¥915 million. 
 
To make matters worse, Cyberdyne does not break out its revenue, so investors do not know 
how much of their revenue is from the sale of exoskeletons, how much is the sale of cleaning 
robots, and how much comes from ticket sales to its robot museum (yes, this is true…read on.)   
 
What we do know is that a full 25% of Cyberdyne's miniscule 2015 sales were transacted with 
its largest shareholder: Related party Daiwa House, and its strategic partner, the University of 
Tsukuba. 


 
 
Cyberdyne released its quarterly earnings this week and, needless to say, there was no good 


news.  Earnings surprise?  Only a negative one.  Revenues were only ¥271m, scarcely more 
than half of the company’s own very minimal ¥500m guidance.  (appx $2.7 mil vs. $5 mil 
estimated.)   


Related Party Sales ¥m


Sales to Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd. 70


Sales to University of Tsukuba 88


Total related party sales disclosed 157


Total Sales 631


Percent of Sales to Related Parties 25%

What investors cannot ignore is the catastrophically declining growth in their core technology 
and product:

Let's Talk Exoskeletons 
 


Most investors in Cyberdyne believe that CEO Sankai’s human-assisting space age robot is the 
singular iconic symbol of Japanese innovation. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Cyberdyne is now just one among many strong competitors in the exoskeleton market. Yet, 
despite their valuation and hype, Cyberdyne does not lead this niche in either sales or research.  
 


While Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Honda and Panasonic are just some of the multinational 
names in the exoskeleton market, we will instead look at the efforts of Parker Hannifin as well 
as other “pure play” publically traded exoskeleton companies.  
 





(Pictures from Raytheon and Lockheed) 





Parker Hannifin 
 


Cyberdyne’s most formidable competitor is Parker Hannifin (a company with more than 1,800 
times Cyberdyne’s revenue, yet only 4 times its market cap.)   Parker-Hannifin is already light 
years ahead of Cyberdyne in terms of developing, manufacturing and selling functional 
exoskeletons.  
 


Parker-Hannifin’s Indego is already FDA approved for sales into the US, and has earned the CE 
mark for sales into Europe. The product is approved for both clinical and personal use. Because 
of its substantial head start, PH’s Indego is has already established itself in the scientific 
community. It has been more widely researched and studied than any other exoskeleton in 
existence or even in development. As part of its extensive FDA clinical trials, PH’s Indego was 
studied in more than 1,200 individual sessions. Indego has also been researched for more uses 
and specific patient types than any competitor. The product goes beyond just “level surface” 
use and has been proven effective for “variable geometry stair ascent and descent”. The 
product has also been the subject of multiple studies for its use by paraplegics, stroke victims, 
and victims of spinal cord injuries.

Even so, PH is staying conservative, rather than touting its sales prospects. In fact, despite its 
massive head start vs. competitors and existing commercial transaction, PH is being noticeably 
subdued in its financial forecasts. In fact, PH is going out of its way to manage Street 
expectations for sales of the product. 
 


 
 
According to PH, “Annual sales of the devices are expected to total less than $10 million 
initially.” 
 


And this is for the company which has secured a strong first mover advantage and FDA approval 
in the world's largest market (in addition to Europe), with existing government contracts (DOD). 





Panasonic 
 


Panasonic has been developing exoskeletons for years, but only in 2016 has the company 
begun to receive much attention. The reason for the attention now is that Panasonic’s products 
are actually starting to hit the market.  
 


As featured in this video, Panasonic recently unveiled a variety of advanced exoskeleton 
products. This includes the AWN-03 which is intended for industrial use, and which is already 
being deployed in various workplaces. Panasonic also has the PLN-01 (AKA the “Ninja”) which 
assists in walking running and even lifting. Panasonic specifically notes that it is designing its 
products to assist the elderly.

Honda  
 


"We’re not claiming this business will be hundreds of millions of dollars a year "

Likewise, Japanese mega giant Honda is best known as a car company. But the company has 
been working on functional exoskeletons for over a decade. Even 3 years ago, Honda was 
already leasing these assisted walking devices to hospitals.  





 
Honda Exoskeletons 





The competition is real and it is local as well as worldwide. While Sankai enticed investors with 
expectations of near term profitability and rapid growth in sales of its exoskeletons, he failed to 
acknowledge the truth -- that Cyberdyne is losing the race to the real leaders in exoskeletons. 





  So How Can Anyone Value Cyberdyne? 
 
Amongst the vast competition, two US listed exoskeleton “pure play” firms stand out most 
clearly:  ReWalk and Ekso Bionics. 





ReWalk Robotics 
 


ReWalk Robotics (NASDAQ:RWLK) is an Israel-domiciled pure play on exoskeletons which is 
listed on NASDAQ. ReWalk bears the distinction that it was the first exoskeleton to receive FDA 
approval in the US. ReWalk received FDA approval in June of 2014. The device has been 
approved in Europe since 2012. 
 


ReWalk went public in a 2014 IPO at a price of $12. As with Cyberdyne, the initial concept of a 
life-changing device with a huge addressable market fueled strong investor enthusiasm. At the 
time, ReWalk had just become the first FDA approved exoskeleton in the US. Within days of the 
IPO, the stock peaked at $37.15. 
 


But once investors got past the “big story” and focused on the actual business, ReWalk steadily 
traded down, while investors waited for sales that never seemed to materialize. By December 
2015, the shares were trading at just $5.00, down by 87% from their post IPO peak.

ReWalk is currently valued at just $83 million, compared to 
Cyberdyne’s $4.0 billion.   
 


Cyberdyne's promotional materials would lead you to believe that they are a leader in the 
exoskeleton market … but real companies take action while the pretenders just talk.   Just look 
at this Cyberdyne press release, proudly announcing that it is the subject of a case study by 
Harvard Business School.   
 


Citron has read the case study. Far from a testament to the strength of Cyberdyne's product or 
technology prospects, the only outstanding point from the study is the observation that 
Cyberdyne is a promotional company. 





http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=50543 
 


Ironically, in the same month in which Harvard Business School published its Cyberdyne case 
study, Harvard entered a bona fide research collaboration -- with ReWalk.  
 


http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpressrelease/259/wyss-institute-collaborates-with-ReWalk-robotics-to-develop-
wearable-exosuits-for-patients-with-limited-mobility 





"In Japan, the promotion of prescribed drugs or medical devices through mass media was 
prohibited. Instead, HAL and Sankai had been frequently featured over the past few years on 
special TV programs and TV news, as well as in newspaper and magazine articles and on 
the Internet. In this way, HAL had built some recognition in Japanese society without 
spending money on promotional efforts. "

And just last week ReWalk entered into another prestigious research collaboration – this time 
with Stanford University. 





Ironically, the largest investor in ReWalk is none other than Japan’s 
largest manufacturer of robots: Yaskawa Electric Corporation.

http://ReWalk.com/wearable-ReWalk-device-finds-an-investor-and-strategic-partner-in-japanese-robotics-firm/ 


 
Despite all of the advantages that ReWalk has over Cyberdyne, the stock trades 
at a market capitalization roughly 1/50


th
 of Cyberdyne -- a mere $85 million 


compared to more than $4 billion.

Ekso Bionics 
 


The other direct comparable to Cyberdyne is Ekso Bionics (NASDAQ:EKSO). 
 


As we saw, in 2005, Time Magazine had been featuring Cyberdyne’s HAL as one of its “Most 
Amazing Innovations of 2005”. By 2010, the target for this enthusiasm for the cutting edge in 
robotics had been redirected onto Ekso’s device.  
 


In 2010, Time featured Ekso’s eLegs among the “50 Best Inventions of 2010”.  With Cyberdyne’s 
device now being 5 years out of date, accolades for Ekso continued. Wired Magazine, called 
eLegs (then knows as Berkeley Bionics) as #2 among its “Most Significant Gadget of 2010”. Ekso 
Bionics was also featured in Inc. Magazine as one of "5 Big Ideas for the Next 15 Years". 
 


Ekso has already received FDA approval in April of 2016: “Ekso GT™ Robotic 


Exoskeleton Cleared by FDA for Use With Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury Patients” 


Ekso came public in 2014 at a price of around $2.00. As with Cyberdyne, initial enthusiasm for 
Ekso was overwhelming; the stock soared rapidly to as high as $6.00. As with ReWalk, the share 
price quickly faded to around $1.00, as financial realities dampened initial enthusiasm. 
 


Much like ReWalk, Ekso enjoys several major advantages when compared to Cyberdyne. First, 
the company is dealing with much newer technology. Ekso was founded in 2005 and 
subsequently developed its technology. Second, Ekso is already FDA approved. Third, Ekso 
already has been able to successfully license out its technology to a major industrial 
conglomerate.  
 


As a result of these advantages, Ekso is trading at an all time high valuation, 


which amounts to just $67 million, a mere 1/60
th


 of Cyberdyne’s $4 billion 
valuation!

The only chart you really need to consider 
 
While ReWalk and Ekso are both approved by the FDA and are more advanced in research and 
development, the disparities between ratios of Enterprise Value to Revenue are devastating.  








  Research & Development    不言実行。 
 


It is obvious that Cyberdyne does not have the financials to support is market valuation. Is the 
future any better?   NO!  While Sankai is busy talking about innovation, he has not dedicated 
any significant investment in R&D to the efforts despite the fact that Parker Hannifin, 
Panasonic, Honda and the other real leaders in robotics are spending billions of $USD to 
advance robotics technology into the marketplace to take future market share 
  
CEO Sankai is aware of this as Cyberdyne has published in its most recent annual report: 
 





https://www.cyberdyne.jp/company/download/20160513_financialresults_FY2016_en.pdf 





“Research and development activities for creation of innovative 


technologies and new industries: Research and development activities of 


the Group are based on three keywords: “challenge,” “overseas 
development” and “innovation.”

  UNKO       
Lets start here. This is a list of patents from Cyberdyne's 2015 annual report. 
Despite the advances made in technology and by its competitors over the last 
decade, there is nothing new for Cyberdyne since 2005.  
 





Research and Development Expenditures:   
From a company supposedly leading Japan in innovation, Cyberdyne's investment 
in R&D is virtually non-existent? 
 


  
2012 2013 2014 2015 Total 


Cyberdyne R&D 
($ m  USD) 


 
$6.5 $7.2 $9.0 $8.3     $31.0 





$31 million USD over 4 years, spread amongst all of their claimed projects, is a bad joke. 
Cyberdyne spreads this budget across a variety of pet projects. This is not enough money to 
dominate the exoskeleton market, nor stand as the face of technology in Japan. 



http://www.cyberdyne.jp/english/company/ar2015/pdf/CYBERDYNE-AR.pdf
Citron Reports on Cyberdyne August 15, 2016 Page 12 of 19 
 


To put this in perspective, Nissin Foods (2897), the maker of Top Ramen Noodles spends 6x 
as much on research and development each year compared to 
Cyberdyne.  Is this the future of Japanese Innovation???? 
    


 
 
 
As for overseas development and innovation, we will discuss these issues further in our sections 
on the FDA and the cleaning robots. 
 


Intellectual Property 
 


To make matters worse, Cyberdyne doesn't even own the patents underlying its intellectual 
property: 
 


 
 
Most of the patents founded by Yoshiyuki Sankai are in fact property of the University of Sankai 
(list of patents). In addition, Cyberdyne will owe the University of Tsukuba an undisclosed 
percentage of royalties (Mar 31, 2014 Financial Results – Page 16 highlight Royalty).  
  


“The patents of intellectual property related to Robot Suit HAL have been 
acquired by the University of Tsukuba, Japan. The company with exclusive 
rights to use all the patent rights has competitiveness in the wearable robot 
market. Various enterprises are proceeding with research and 
commercialization of wearable robots and their development status of new 
technologies might affect the company group’s business performance and 
business development.”

 Cyberdyne and the FDA: Something is REALLY wrong here. 
 


It is universally accepted by everyone (including Cyberdyne) that the US is the world's largest 
market for exoskeletons. This is why Cyberdyne’s competitors have made FDA approval a top 
priority.  
 


It should be noted that ReWalk Robotics, Parker Hannifin and Ekso Bionics have all obtained 
FDA approval to market exoskeletons in the US. 
 


How has so much time elapsed without progress on Cyberdyne's approval?  Here is a brief 
timeline of Cyberdyne’s FDA application process. 
 


In August 2014, at the time of its IPO, Cyberdyne announced: 
  


CYBERDYNE Inc. has begun seeking approval from the U. S. Food and 


Drug Administration (FDA) to export Robot Suit HAL for Medical Use to 


the United States. A Section 513(g) Request for Information 


summarizing the characteristics of the device and requesting a judgement 


clarifying the device classification was submitted, and received by the FDA 


on June 27, 2014. 
 


http://www.cyberdyne.jp/english/company/PressReleases_detail.html?id=1075 


 
Less than a year later at the June 30 2015 quarter end, we read: 
 


“CYBERDYNE Group submitted to the Food and Drug Administration 


(FDA) in November 2014 a request for approval of HAL® for Medical Use 


(Lower Limb Type) as a medical device, with the intention of receiving 


approval during 2015.” 
 


https://www.cyberdyne.jp/company/download/20150814_kessantanshin_1Q2016_en_1.pdf 


 
As 2015 was coming to an end, and investors were expecting approval, we read: 
 


In USA, the Company has applied for medical device certificate of HAL® 


for Medical Use to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and aims to 


receive the certificate within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016. 
 


https://www.cyberdyne.jp/company/download/20160212_financialresults.pdf 


 
OK, so it was delayed a bit … It happens. But then the story changes again … just 
three months later…

Citron Reports on Cyberdyne August 15, 2016 Page 14 of 19 
 


March 31 2016 Quarter End 
 


 In November 2014, an application for HAL® for Medical Use (Lower Limb 


Type) has been submitted to the FDA and the Company resent a revised 


application (Form-510k for a new type of device). 
 


https://www.cyberdyne.jp/company/download/20160513_financialresults_FY2016_en.pdf 


 
and now…. 
 
June 30 2016 Quarter End 
 


Also in the United States, in anticipation of obtaining medical device 


approval for HAL® for Medical Use (Lower Limb Type) by the U.S. Food 


and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Company began the process of 


establishing an American incorporation CYBERDYNE USA Inc. 
 


http://www.cyberdyne.jp/company/download/20160810_kessantanshin_1Q2016_en.pdf 


 
Investors must ask themselves and the company:  When and how did 


Cyberdyne’s HAL FDA application change from a “de novo” to a 510k?   
 


A “de novo” application is for a unique medical device that has no precedent and would 
position Cyberdyne as an innovator and first mover. But then the application changes to 510k, 
which means they are just offering an alternative device to something that has already been 
cleared by the FDA, and can be compared to it for regulatory approval.  
 


http://www.meddeviceonline.com/doc/are-you-sure-you-know-the-best-regulatory-pathway-for-your-new-
medical-device-0001 





This change clearly demonstrates that  Cyberdyne admits it is now just a follower, not a leader -
-- without ever informing its own shareholders. 
 


http://www.cyberdyne.jp/english/company/PressReleases_detail.html?id=1460 
 


What happened to the prior application?  Was it rejected?  Withdrawn?   
 


But this is MOST Disturbing … 
 


It is now 20 months since the alleged revised 510k submission to the FDA and still no approval. 
 
By comparison, when earning their own 510K approvals, both ReWalk and Ekso Bionics 


obtained their approvals in just a matter of a few months.

Why is Cyberdyne going on 20 months and investors hear only silence??? 
Citron has a theory. 
 


Perhaps Cyberdyne does not want approval. When you have a market capitalization so high, 
you cannot let investors discover the harsh truth. It is easier to pretend that the future is 
unlimited rather than be confronted with the reality that, despite what you tell your investors, 


if and when you ever earn FDA approval, it will come with adding no significant new 
revenues to your company. 
 


Even after years following its FDA approval in the US, ReWalk continues to sell less than $10 
million of exoskeletons in the world's largest market. Parker Hannifin has told investors to 
expect a similar level of sales.  
 


Despite Cyberdyne having received regulatory approval in Europe and Japan, and having 
marketed products since 2009, total cumulative sales over the last four years -- from April 2012 
through March 2016 have amounted to a mere $22.8 million -- less than a six million per year 
run rate – and that figure is not even income allocated purely from robotic products.

 If Cyberdyne is not the technology company it claims 
to be…… What Is It? 
 


It is the opinion of Citron that the ridiculous market valuation of Cyberdyne is the result of a 
promotional CEO taking advantage of the long-standing fascination with robots in Japanese 
culture.  
 


Cyberdyne has never generated significant revenues. 
Cyberdyne has never invested realistically in Research & Development. 
Cyberdyne has no regulatory approvals and no presence in the world's largest 
market. 
Cyberdyne trails behind all of its competitors.

  Cyberdyne is a massive stock promotion.   
 


Part of the promotion is operating a robot museum. Yes a robot museum.  
In one of the busiest shopping malls in Tokyo, Cyberdyne feeds on the public’s fascination with 
robots, offering a display that is a tribute to robots of the past and future. 
 





 
 
Instead of actually selling exoskeletons to hospitals, they are giving free demonstrations in 
shopping malls to able bodied people… perhaps potential investors.  In what Citron considers 
to be Cyberdyne’s greatest success, they have actually created a tourist destination out of a 
robot museum:

tsukuba/5813 





And as ridiculous as this might sound, there are many retail investors and enough naïve 
consumers who believe that Cyberdyne is on the verge of creating the famous Gundam Robots 
that have become a part of the Japanese popular fictional culture.

*It should be noted that the shopping mall that houses the museum is owned by Daiwa House, 
Cyberdyne’s largest investor and largest customer:

Complicit Role of the Japanese Government 
 


In order to make the promotion work without paying for advertising coverage for a medical 
device, CEO Sankai has been clever enough to enlist the help of the Japanese government. 
Citron assumes that the Japanese Government did not look too closely at Cyberdyne’s 
promotional agenda before unleashing a series of commercials (complete with commercial 
jingle music) that made Cyberdyne the face of technology in Japan: 
 





https://www.ispot.tv/ad/7eMc/the-government-of-japan-robots 
 


Appropriating Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s image and quotes – completely inappropriately. 
This in a country where it is not legal to promote sales of drugs and medical technologies!   
 


OF course, CEO Sankai brags about the above video in corporate PR.  More no-cost, no-value, 
no-point-except-stock-promotion noise.

Then there’s this one.   Etc., etc.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm35YzviaqM 
 


   Cyberdyne Trying to Clean Up the Dirt! 
 


In what seems to be nothing more than another attempt to distract investors from the slow 
moving exoskeleton business, in 2013 Cyberdyne entered the robotic-driven cleaning business 
in an attempt to be a “comprehensive robot company”.  It is three years later now. But as of its 
last shareholders’ report, there are only 14 robots in operation.  
 


Cyberdyne was quick to put out a press release of a trial cleaning robot at the Tokyo Airport: 
 


… but this bizarre explanation to investors in a quarterly report footnote speaks for itself: 
 


“Main reasons for business combination: The company group judged that it would 


develop into a comprehensive robot company, centering on Robot Suit HAL, by taking 


over the cleaning robot business of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and pushing forward with 


research and development of robots for cleaning and transportation, with which its 


proprietary advanced technologies will be combined.”

Though this sounds unique and sophisticated, it is anything but. These Cyberdyne cleaning 
robots were acquired for less than $200,000. Currently the company has only 14 in operation, 
and are unlikely to ever compete with or compare to iRobot’s Roomba, which shipped over two 
million units in each of the past two years.  
 


We have a robot cleaning company in the United States called iRobot. If you want to see what 
the financials of a cleaning device robot company look like….here you go…..these financials 


CRUSH Cyberdyne … Cyberdyne’s revenues are 1/50
th


  of iRobot, yet Cyberdyne trades for 
4x the market cap of IRobot’s.

    Citron Research Offers a Respectful Message to Japanese 
Investors: 
 


Citron Research is an activist short seller. Building upon our 16 years’ experience in publishing 
about dangerous investments, we try to add insight into stock markets that are otherwise 
clouded with promotion and misinformation.  
 


Recently Japan Exchange Group CEO Akira Kiyota commented that activist short selling can be 
considered “ethically challenged." 
 


http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-itochu-japan-exchange-idUST9N19L02F 


Telling the truth is never ethically challenged. What is ethically challenged, in our opinion, is 
the campaign of misinformation and promotion that will eventually hurt investors, which has 
been perpetuated by Cyberdyne itself!  The fairest and most efficient markets are free markets, 
and the ability to tell the “other side of the story” is important to keep balance in the 
marketplace.  
 


Further comment to Japanese Investors:  For those of you who still want to own a Japanese 
company with exposure to robots we suggest Softbank…..yes, Softbank.  Their ‘Pepper’ robot 
has sold out thousands of units upon launch!  This is buying real innovation with an underlying 
business and management that is dedicated to execution of business

   Conclusion 
 


Many great technology advances have come from innovative Japanese 
companies -- BUT CYBERDYNE IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Far from the great 
Japanese companies that have transformed the automobile industry and 
pioneered the video game industry, Cyberdyne is an example of a company that 
is taking advantage of the naiveté of retail investors and lack of open 
information about stocks in the Japanese stock market. Citron Research has no 
doubt that as soon as the investing public understands the real Cyberdyne, the 


stock will embark on its downward descent to reality -- 85% below current 
levels. 
 
Cautious Investing To All
