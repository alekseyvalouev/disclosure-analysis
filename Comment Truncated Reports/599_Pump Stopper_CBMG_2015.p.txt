Cellular Biomedicine: Strong Sell On CAR-T Failure, Dishonesty
Allegations And Stock Promotion, -94.6% Downside

Summary


With paid stock promotion CBMG has achieved an unsustainable $500m valuation,
and with $20m in stock sold and insiders stock registered to sell, I expect CBMG will
continue to collapse.


CBMG "Car-T" technology was acquired for $1.8m, has experienced patient deaths
and is worthless. CBMG recent R&D of just $4.9m makes the $500m valuation
clearly absurd.


CBMG founders face dishonesty allegations, are responsible for alleged illegal
offshore stem cell clinic, while partnered with John Mattera who is currently serving
11 years in prison for fraud (again).


Multiple accounting and financial integrity issues, CFO and Auditor turnover,
"material weaknesses" and "inability to timely file" a full 50% of quarterly SEC filings
raises accounting and financial integrity questions.


Assuming CBMG is "real" and generously valuing CBMG on fundamentals show
-94.6% near term and imminent downside.
