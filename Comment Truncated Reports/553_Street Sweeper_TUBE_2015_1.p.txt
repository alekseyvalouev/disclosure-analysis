TubeMogul: Why This Stock Will Go Down The Tubes
Jan. 30, 2015 4:24 PM ET46 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


TUBE’s capture of Oreo-maker Mondoleze helped fuel its successful IPO. However,
despite the CEO’s reassurances, Google has secured much of TUBE’s business
with that customer.


Google’s gain may signify the beginning of TUBE’s customer base erosion.


Almost as soon as the 180-day post-IPO lockup expired, TUBE's CTO began selling
thousands of shares. This suggests a lack of confidence; opens floodgates for more
selling.


TUBE is extremely expensive as it tries to navigate in a field of nearly 200
competitors, including many well-heeled, proven household names.


TUBE is not only expensive for potential investors, its price is so high it will repel any
potential buyers.

Behind the scenes, TubeMogul (TUBE) is in a world of hurt. Digital media giant Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has practically run away with one of Tube's
biggest customers.


But this bad break - and its unfortunate future implications - has flown under the radar until
now. It's the first of three negatives threatening to clobber Tube's shareprice.


Flash back to last June. Folks in the Emeryville, Calif. headquarters buzzed with
anticipation that TubeMogul had seemingly knocked down a king-maker partnership with
Mondelez International.


TubeMogul provides self-serve software that allows advertisers to plan, buy and measure
the effectiveness of video ads. Its recent customer Mondelez manufactures Oreo, Wheat
Thins and various chocolates, gum and candy.


Brett Wilson, TubeMogul's CEO and co-founder said,

Mondelez International's digital branding strategy has always been ahead of the
curve. The way they harness the power of software to amplify their strategy is
groundbreaking and we're proud to enable that in video.


The deal helped propel the money-losing Tube to its initial public offering last July.


Tube quickly settled into an overvalued spot on the Nasdaq. Though the IPO price got cut
to $7 from the originally proposed $11-$13, Tube shares blasted off, quickly gaining 240
percent. Shares settled recently around $16, handing the company a valuation
approaching half-a-billion dollars.


But, just four months after the TubeMogul announcement, Google and Mondelez held
what's described as contentious behind-the-scenes negotiations.


Google wanted Mondelez to use DoubleClick Bid Manager, Google's demand-side
buying platform, instead of competitor TubeMogul, to execute the YouTube
transactions as part of the deal, and it was using YouTube's TrueView pricing system
as leverage, according to multiple executives directly involved in the negotiations.


- Digiday, a website for tech geeks, wrote of the Mondelez-Google negotiations.


Google had pushed Tube aside.


Bonin Bough, Mondelez vice president of global media said,


The Google partnership is one of the most substantial partnerships we've done to
date. Not only does it give us access to deep and rich consumer insights, as well as
measurement and tracking, but we're also collaborating with Google on these
content-creation pilots by leveraging YouTube studios.


He added in this video,


We believe this new model of high content-creation at low cost will help us craft a
path towards the future.


During Tube's November earnings call, RBC Capital Markets analyst Rohit Kulkarni asked
about the Google-Mondelez deal.


But CEO Wilson seemed to gloss over the issue:

… broadly speaking we thought that the Mondelez announcement was positive. It is
yet another large brand signaling that they are shifting TV ad dollars into digital. In
this case, into digital video.


Now this particular announcement was a spend commitment that Mondelez is
making with Google as a publisher. We believe that we will continue to be used as
Mondelez's software for brand advertising and will be the pipes, if you well, to
facilitate any of their publisher buys Google or otherwise. The Mondelez partnership
continues to do well.


During that same earnings call, CEO Wilson's introduction included this upbeat
promotional comment:


Mondelez, the world's largest snack company with beloved brands like Oreo, Chip
Ahoy! and Wheat Thins, has likewise indicated that they are targeting for 50% of
their total ad budget to go into digital by 2016, so it is no longer a question of
whether TV dollars will shift to digital. It is just a question of how much of the $200
billion global TV ad market will shift and how long it will take.


But the promise has fizzled. Now the situation appears to be a jaw-dropping loss for Tube.


Digiday wrote,


Google's Mondelez deal called for Google to make YouTube inventory - including
TrueView ads - available to be bought programmatically sometime in early 2015, a
feature that does not currently exist. The catch was that Mondelez would have to
buy that inventory through Google's DSP.


Mondelez, a $59 billion snack company, agreed to buy a certain percentage of ads
through TubeMogul and use Google for the rest.


And the arrangement describes a greater decline in use of Tube in the future:


But part of that compromise was an understanding that Mondelēz would in
subsequent years purchase a greater percentage of its TrueView ads with DBM, and
use TubeMogul less.


- Digiday reported.

An analyst who requested anonymity told TheStreetSweeper,


It's clear Tube's technology is nothing special, since Google did this. And besides
Google, there's a lot of other companies that could do the same. There's no
stickiness to their business.


A Tube federal filing clearly notes the concern:


A variety of factors outside of our control could affect our revenue growth, including
changes in spend budgets of advertisers and the timing and size of their spend.


So, Google's gain is just the beginning of Tube's customer base erosion. What's to keep
Google and other giants from snapping up another customer - and another?


On that basis alone, we believe it won't be long before Tube's nearly $500 million
valuation gets the axe.


Today's press release about Tube providing the platform, not inventory, for two 15-second
Mondelez ads during the Big Game is simply a test of technology during the football
game. This doesn't cancel out the arrangement that over time, Google will take over most
of Tube's deal with Mondelez.


This also highlights how Tube issues promotional press releases about Mondelez, but
doesn't want to talk about Google's significant threat to Tube's partnership.


Investors may read other viewpoints on Tube HERE, but we'll point out some other jarring
bumps affecting Tube.


*Insider sells shares right after lockup expiration. Expect more to follow.


The IPO offered 6.25 million shares. But, nearly three times that many shares - 22.4
million - were set aside as restricted shares for Tube officers, directors and other major
shareholders.


Insiders were required under a lockup agreement not to trade those shares for 180 days.
Those millions of looming shares poised to dilute stock currently held by Tube investors
have now been unlocked.


With the stock trading as high as $18.40 - more than double the IPO price - the shares
unlocked Jan. 14, 2015.

The very day the lockup expired - Bam! - Tube's chief technology officer Adam Rose sold
over 7,500 shares.


Under an automatic sales plan set up and controlled by Mr. Rose, this was the first of four
batches the freshly minted millionaire has sold so far, totaling 82,531 shares at an average
price of about $16.50.


As of Jan. 20, Mr. Rose had 473,393 shares left (a comma was left off in Nasdaq's chart
below), yet he's clearly taking a lot of chips off the table, according to the filing.


Interesting that, the day after Mr. Rose's first sale, the CEO stated he knew of no insider
selling. CEO Wilson told Bloomberg on Jan. 15, when asked to comment on the apparent
sell off of company stock and resulting 20 percent price drop at lockup expiration,


I'm not selling. I'm not aware of any of our major shareholders that are selling.


What does Mr. Rose know that Mr. Wilson doesn't? And if this insider truly believes the
company's future is strong, why sell now?


Furthermore, if the football game arrangement Tube announced today is so big, why on
earth would insiders be selling shares now?


Mr. Rose may be leading the charge. We expect to see more insiders follow suit at these
prices, further pinching the value of shares held by average investors.


*Pricey Stock Compared to Rivals


Perhaps the competition, beginning with customer-grabbing Google, is part of what has
spooked the chief technology officer. In this competitive space, Tube finds itself up against
108 prepackaged software companies.

These include flexible, well-heeled household brands like Adobe Systems, Intuit and
Microsoft.


Looking at a total of 169 reviews comparing Tube with nine competitors currently offering
similar functionality, Tube's competitors, with rare exception, were rated as performing
well. Tube did well with the only two people who reviewed it.


In contrast, 92 people reviewed Google's product and offered generally glowing reviews.
One Google reviewer stated:


It allows us to reach a large audience with an investment that is significantly less
than traditional advertising methods such as print advertising.


Let's compare two more similar emerging video ad companies, Rocket Fuel
(NASDAQ:FUEL) and YuMe (NYSE:YUME). Investors can see from the chart below that
Tube - with revenue last quarter falling behind the previous quarter - is outrageously
overpriced compared with these peers.


Tube's price to earnings ratio is spectacularly high, and the often preferred metric -
enterprise multiple or EV/EBITDA (enterprise-value-to-earnings-before-interest-taxes-
depreciation-and amortization) - also shows Tube is pricey for average investors. It is 4 ½
to 8 ½ times more expensive than the others. That high enterprise multiple also tells
bigger companies that Tube would be a very poor buyout candidate. Here's the chart:
