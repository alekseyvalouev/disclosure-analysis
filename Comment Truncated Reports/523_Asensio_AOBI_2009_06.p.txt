Patti Appear Incomplete.


Posted on September 22, 2009 by Asensio.com


Notice

titled "Additional AOBO Comments on Third Parties Website
Postings." AOB’s new disclosures were related to this
asensio.com report. asensio.com published a report to its
registered users titled “AOB Issues Comments on Technology
Integration and Cosimo Patti” based on the contents of AOB’s
September 25th new disclosures. To view AOB’s posting click

Public filings show that Cosimo Patti, a director of American


Oriental Bioengineering, Inc. (NYSE: AOB), received compensation


not disclosed by AOB through consulting fees paid to Technology


Integration Group, Inc. (“TIG”), a penny stock company where Mr.


Patti was the 91% owner and sole employee. Mr. Patti has been an


AOB director since September 27, 2004, and serves on the AOB


board’s audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate


governance committees. Mr. Patti is presented as an “independent”


director.

that 90% of its revenue for the year came from AOB, or $153,441 of


TIG’s $170,081 in total reported revenue. TIG also reported a


smaller amount of revenue from AOB in fiscal 2005, approximately


$20,000, or 15% of total revenue.


In AOB’s SEC filings for fiscal years ending December 31, 2004, 2005,


and 2006, there is no disclosure concerning payments to TIG.

AOB discloses payments of director’s fees to Mr. Patti personally of


$30,000 in cash and options in 2004, $30,000 in cash and 22,026


shares in 2005, and $45,000 in cash and 4,511 shares in 2006.


In October 2006 TIG completed a reverse merger with Odyne


Corporation, where Odyne became the surviving entity. After that


date, Mr. Patti’s consulting business and any fees collected from


AOB are no longer reflected in this entity’s SEC filings. Mr. Patti and


TIG’s one other shareholder received $100 for their 87.8 million TIG


shares in the reverse merger.


A company called Silver Linkage Holding Ltd. (“Silver”) was


incorporated in Hong Kong in January 2002, according to filings


with the Hong Kong Companies Registry. According to these filings,


in 2006 AOB’s CEO, Shujun “Tony” Liu, owned 51% of Silver, AOB


director Jun Min owned 8%, and AOB’s CFO, Yanchun “Lily” Li,


owned 8%. Li was also a director of Silver. A Jason Liu owned 33%,


but in 2008 his shares were transferred to Tony Liu, raising Tony’s


ownership to 84%. None of Silver appears to have been owned by


AOB.


A TIG SEC filing, dated March 16, 2006, contains a letter from Mr.


Patti to Silver, describing a contract for consulting services related


to building pharmaceutical companies. The letter refers to a


conversation with “Tony” and is addressed to “Lily.” Patti’s letter


describes an agreement for Silver to pay him $1,000 per day for


consulting services, “for at least 10 working days per month,” “for a


period of two years.”
