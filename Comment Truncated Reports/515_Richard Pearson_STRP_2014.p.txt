After Recent Spike, Straight Path Could Fall 50%
Nov. 4, 2014 9:30 AM ET29 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Straight Path holds wireless spectrum and patent troll assets. The stock is up by
100% in the past month, and is held overwhelmingly by retail investors.


Announcements that it was suing Apple, Verizon and others sent the stock soaring.
But past awards to STRP have been consistently at just $1-$2 million from other
giants.


Straight Path's patents begin to expire next year, and two weeks ago (AFTER the
Apple/Verizon announcement), elements of the first one were invalidated by the
USPTO as "unpatentable".


Straight Path's wireless spectrum assets are in the millimeter bands, and are years
away from commercialization, if at all. There is currently no logical reason to bid up
the stock.


Yet, retail investors have bid up the stock by 100% due to a simple FCC blog post
requesting comments on mm spectrum. Straight Path is likely to fall 50%.


The recent travails of Globalstar Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSAT) serve well to illustrate how retail-
oriented stock promotions can achieve wildly overvalued share prices, until they are found
out and come crashing back to earth. Prior to a report from Kerrisdale Capital, Globalstar
had been trading at almost $4.00. Following a lengthy exposé on the true value
proposition at the company, Globalstar fell to as low as $1.56, a max decline of well over
50% within 2 weeks. It has now rebounded slightly. Institutional ownership stands very low
at just 35%, and there is minimal institutional research on the name. It is overwhelmingly a
retail investor stock play, which explains how the stock ended up trading up to such
unjustifiable levels (and why the crash was so severe).

The company I am focused on today is Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP),
whose share price is up by around 100% in the past month, solely due to a handful of
misunderstood headlines regarding its wireless spectrum and its small portfolio of patent
troll assets. Once investors grasp the underlying reality, Straight Path is likely to give up
most of these recent gains and should fall by around 50%, back to where it was a few
weeks ago. In April, Straight Path had traded as low as $6.00. It is currently trading north
of $20.00.


Straight Path currently has a market cap of $250 million. Despite the rise in the share
price, there is virtually no short interest in the name, at just 2% of shares outstanding and
only 1 day's trading volume. As far as I can see, there are at least 1 million shares
available to borrow at brokers such as IB.


Also, like Globalstar, institutional investment is very, very low at just 26%. There is no
institutional research coverage for Straight Path. Please note that Straight Path has a July
31 year-end, such that it just released its Annual Report for fiscal 2014 (which ended in
July), and the company is now in fiscal 2015.

In short, Straight Path soared because it announced in September that it was filing patent
claims against Apple, Avaya, Cisco, and Verizon. Retail investors are envisioning massive
settlements with hundreds of millions, simply based on the size and scope of the giant
targets.


But the reality is that Straight Path has already filed and/or won 12 similar suits against
very similar defendants, including some of the largest giants in the tech space, such as
BlackBerry, Netflix, Vonage, Sony, Toshiba, LG, Samsung, Skype and eBay. Despite the
dozen wins, Straight Path has only brought in a total of $18 million, or around $1.5 million
each.


In fact, the most recent 4 wins (against BlackBerry, Netflix, Vonage and ZTE) only brought
in an average of $600,000 each. At these levels, these suits can only be described as
"nuisance suits".


In addition, although announcing these wins for the full size, Straight Path has only
recognized $4.4 million as revenue in 2014, because the remaining amounts are deemed
too uncertain to be collected. Yet, the sunk legal costs of these wins already exceeds $8
million. So far, Straight Path has only recognized $2 million of these costs.


But wait, it gets better. The patents that Straight Path is asserting actually start to expire in
2015 - just next year - making the ultimate future of this business very limited.


But wait, the best is yet to come.

On October 9th (three weeks after the announcements of launching the
Apple/Verizon suits), the USPTO ruled that various parts of the Straight Path's
primary core patent (the '704 patent), were "unpatentable".


As a result, it may now be impossible to even collect on the suits that are in
process.


No 8K was filed at the time announcing this development. Instead, it was simply
buried in the recent annual 10K filing.


A back and forth legal battle has begun over this patent, and Straight Path has noted its
intention to appeal.


A second reason for the spike in the share price was an announcement from the FCC
which simply stated that it was asking for comments in a Notice of Inquiry on the potential
use of spectrum bands above 24 GHz for use in mobile communications. This could one
day potentially include the spectrum assets (28GHz and 29 GHz) owned by Straight Path.
But even the company itself discloses that any progress on this is likely to be years away,
if ever.


In fact, the spectrum assets (which have been owned by Straight Path/IDT since 2001)
are already being utilized by customers, including AT&T, TelePacific Communications and
UNSI.


So what is it bringing in for revenues?


For all of 2014, total revenues from spectrum amounted to just $424,000 in 2014 and
$525,000 in 2013. And (as shown below) that is the level we should probably expect for at
least the next 5 years.


But again, as with Globalstar, a small group of retail investors has somehow come to the
conclusion that they alone have figured out that Straight Path is sitting on a spectrum
goldmine. As we will see below, this is demonstrably not the case.


Background of Straight Path and IDT Corp.


Straight Path was spun out of its parent company IDT Corp. (NYSE:IDT) in 2013. IDT is
best known for its legacy as a provider of discount calling cards for making international
calls. As competition from free or ultra-cheap international calling services (such as
Skype, magicJack and Vonage) has increased, this business has become nearly

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 5/23


profitless, and IDT reached out into a wide range of get-rich-quick schemes in a variety of
areas, including investment in shale oil, hedge funds, real estate, consumer debt
collection, broadcasting and even comic books. This also includes Straight Path.


The spectrum assets which are now part of Straight Path were first acquired by IDT for
$55 million in 2001 from the bankrupt Winstar Communications. Winstar had spent
hundreds of millions on that same spectrum, before going bankrupt with it. IDT then spent
hundreds of millions of dollars itself, trying to build out these assets. It then abandoned
these efforts, before spinning off the assets to shareholders in the form of Straight Path.


IDT has largely been run as a family fiefdom for and by the relatives of CEO Howard
Jonas. Mr. Jonas appointed his son Shmuel (aka "Samuel") Jonas as the COO of IDT at
the age of 25. Shmuel's previous experience was as an apartment manager in the Bronx
and as an operator of a frozen dessert delivery business. Mr. Jonas also appointed his
other son, Davidi (aka "David") Jonas, as CEO of Straight Path. Davidi's former
experience was that of a Rabbi in the Bronx and a high school teacher of Judaic studies.
Davidi was 26 years old, and has been employed by IDT / Spectrum since 2012. IDT's
General Counsel (responsible for approving its large corporate transactions and spin-offs)
happens to be Mr. Jonas' sister, Joyce Mason. IDT obtained its insurance policies from
IGM Insurance Brokerage, owned by Mr. Jonas' father, his mother and his brother-in-law
(Jonathon Mason). Mr. Jonas also appointed his son-in-law (Michael Stein) as vice-
president of Corporate Development.


The point is that because of these relationships, it is easy to approve these get-rich-quick
ventures which are notably value-destructive and unfriendly to shareholders. As featured
in Crain's New York Business, these diversions into high-risk, speculative (and totally
unrelated) ventures such as Straight Path have now cost IDT shareholders over $1 billion
in destroyed value.


As noted by Crain's,


"IDT's Howard Jonas has a million ideas. He's lost $1 billion. Read about his latest
scheme."


Each time the new ventures fail to produce results, IDT typically spins them off to
shareholders, as it did with its failed energy project, Genie Energy (NYSE:GNE). Genie is
a shale oil play which was acquired by IDT at the peak of the shale boom, and then was

later spun off to IDT investors in 2011. The share price of Genie has fallen from $9.00 in
2011 down to $7.00 at present, although (like Straight Path) it did see a brief spike in 2013
to almost $18.00, before falling by more than 50% to current levels.


As we saw with Genie, we are currently seeing a similar spike in Straight Path, which
should correct quickly back to its original level of $10.00 or so.


Genie Share Price


The typical modus operandi for the IDT spin-offs is for the Jonas family to take additional
management and board positions in the new company, paying themselves handsomely. At
Genie, Howard Jonas (CEO of IDT) also became the new CEO and chairman, paying
himself handsomely for the role, despite the fact that the share price has faltered and
Genie continues to lose money.


At Straight Path, Mr. Jonas appointed his 26-year old son, Davidi Jonas, as CEO, and has
already awarded him over $1 million in compensation. As mentioned before, Davidi had
previously worked for his father at IDT for almost 2 years, but prior to that, his only work
experience was as a high school teacher of Judaic studies and as a Rabbi. Again, that is
the CEO of Straight Path.


Straight Path currently has only 6 employees and operates out of a space in Glenn Allen,
Virginia, which it rents for just $575 per month. A separate office in New Jersey is rented
for $733 per month.

What caused the share price of Straight Path to double?


Back in early September, Straight Path was trading at just $9-$10 on very low volume. But
a series of announcements from the company has sent the stock doubling since then,
recently hitting an all-time high of $22.00.


Straight Path has two business segments. One is in wireless spectrum assets, and the
other is in enforcing patents (i.e. patent trolling) with a small portfolio of IP assets. The
recent announcements pertained to both segments.


In each case, the announcements have been largely misinterpreted by the
overwhelmingly retail investor base, such that the share price should be expected
to return to around $9-$10 when investors realize the facts.


PART I: The real prospects for the patent portfolio?


The first catalyst for the spike in Straight Path was an announcement that on September
24th the company had filed patent infringement complaints against Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL), Avaya Inc. and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). On September 26th,
the company then filed against Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ).


Clearly, this is something that could have multi-billion dollar potential, right?
Wrong.


We can actually get very close to determining the value of these suits. Based on past
facts, it is highly likely that Straight Path will, in fact prevail, in these suits. The company
has already filed similar suits against other tech mega giants, including Sony, Toshiba,
BlackBerry, LG, Samsung, Skype, eBay and others. More importantly, it has already been
winning these suits.


But the key point here is that while Straight Path has indeed won these infringement suits,
the amounts that it has won have been tiny. They have also been very consistent in their
size.


As I will show below, there are a wide variety of issues facing Straight Path and its patent
troll prospects. What it all boils down to is that the revenue prospects are very much
limited. Yet, by bidding up the stock by 100%, retail investors are clearly assuming that
there must be truly massive revenue potential ahead. This is wrong.


There is precisely zero chance of Straight Path winning even $10 million off of any
one of these suits. In fact, the real number is most likely less than $1 million each.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 8/23


Problem #1: The amounts won are demonstrably very small


For the year ended July 31, 2014, Straight Path won 8 of these suits against the tech
mega giants, for a total of $15.8 million, which amounts to around $2 million each.


In the subsequent few months, Straight Path prevailed in 4 more suits, bringing in $2.4
million more. For this second part, we are now talking about just $600,000 each for the
suits against the giants BlackBerry, Netflix, Vonage and ZTE.


Again, it should be kept in mind that these tiny awards have been in suits against the
largest giants in the tech industry, which have combined revenues in the hundreds of
billions. These are basically just "nuisance lawsuits" designed to pull in around $1 million
each, and the giants can just pay to make them go away.


The point is that even if we can expect Straight Path to win in the suits against Apple,
Avaya, Cisco and Verizon, the amounts will likely be in the range of $1-$2 million each (at
most). So, at most we are talking about perhaps $6-$8 million. At the low end of the range
($600,000 each), we would be talking about less than $3 million in total.


Clearly, even in the best-case scenario, this doesn't merit the stock price doubling in a few
weeks, adding over $100 million in market cap. Instead, it was just excessive and
misplaced retail enthusiasm due to the headlines about suing Apple and Verizon. There is
no chance of a massive settlement for Straight Path.


Problem #2: Running out of new parties to sue


Relative to the other problems, this one is relatively minor. But it should become fairly
obvious to readers.


So far, Straight Path has filed suits against around 15 parties, which includes the
following:


Skype
eBay
Bandwith.com
BlackBerry
Sony
LG
Samsung
Toshiba
Vocalocity

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 9/23


Amtran
Huawei
ZTE
Vonage
Verizon


The problem now is that Straight Path will quickly run out of new parties of adequate size
to sue. There are a limited number of giant targets in this size range, and Straight Path
has now hit most of the low-hanging fruit. Only a few other names (such as perhaps
Hewlett-Packard) quickly come to mind. Straight Path will no doubt broaden its target list.
But at most, the company might be able to find another 20 parties to sue. As the parties
get smaller and smaller, the likely awards will also get smaller. So we can assume that
future revenues from patent trolling may be somewhere in the range of perhaps $20-$40
million at most, and perhaps even less than $10 million as the award sizes shrink. This
would include any proceeds that we should expect from Apple and Verizon.


But as we will see below, looking at gross proceeds ignores the cost of litigation, which
can be in excess of 40%. It also ignores the fact that much of the awards are "contingent",
and collection is not even reasonably assured. So in reality, the likely best-case scenario
is now a future benefit to Straight Path of less than $20 million.


Problem #3: What are the REAL revenues? What are the COSTS associated?


Clearly, the headline numbers look great. In a short period of time, Straight Path appears
to have pulled in over $18 million in patent troll wins. But this is not the case. In fact, for
the full year of FY 2014 (ended July 31), Straight Path only recognized $4 million in
revenue from these suits. The total wins as of that time were already over $16 million. One
problem is that portions of the amounts are too uncertain in terms of collectability to
declare as revenue. It is not as simple as "win $16 million and collect $16 million".


Meanwhile, the costs associated with these wins are very concrete and represent money
already spent. These costs already exceed $8 million spent for just $4 million in
recognized revenues. But Straight Path has so far only recognized $2 million of the costs.


As a result, the real benefit (in terms of profit) to Straight Path has so far been just
around $2 million from all 12 suits.


Problem #4: Straight Path's patents begin to expire in 2015 (next year!)


Here, we can see that the problems start to become more serious and structural.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 10/23


Retail investors have gotten very excited about Straight Path's patent troll prospects, but
not just because of the recent wins. These wins (a total of $18 million in revenues, only $4
million of which was recognized) are clearly too small to justify a doubling of the share
price and an extra $100 million in market cap.


Instead, these wins are being taken as an indicator that bigger and better wins are set to
come and the Straight Path can truly make a sustainable business out of suing tech
giants. Unfortunately, that party is set to end much quicker than many retail investors
understand.


The reality is that the key patents begin to expire next year, such that there is truly no
sustainability to the patent troll revenue stream.


This is why Straight Path was in such a rush to begin filing suits as soon as the spin-off
was completed, and why it continues to rush to hit the biggest names in the industry (such
as Apple) as fast as it can.


Problem #5: As of October, elements of Straight Path's core '704 patent were found
to be "unpatentable". Is it game over?


Back in April of 2013, Straight Path was already suing Sipnet EU, a Czech technology
company, for infringing Straight Path's core '704 patent. Sipnet filed with the US patent
office for a Inter Partes review with the goal of demonstrating the claims within the patent
are in fact "unpatentable". Straight Path fought this hard in 2013, but just two weeks ago,
on October 9th, the USPTO issued an administrative decision that most of the '704 patent
is in fact "unpatentable".


Despite the magnitude of this decision, Straight Path did not put out an 8K at the time to
disclose it to investors. Instead, it was simply buried within the recently released 10K
(page 15) that:


During the pendency of an inter partes review, or related appeal, any litigation
related to the patents in review could potentially be subject to an order to stay the
litigation while the review proceeds. Therefore, while a review is pending, we may
be unable to enforce our patents.


This all happened after the announcements about suing Apple and Verizon sent the stock
soaring. Yet, it may now be the case that Straight Path cannot even attempt to enforce
ANY of the pending suits.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 11/23


As shown in the final decision from the USPTO:


The Board has jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. § 6(c). This final written decision is
issued pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 318(a) and 37 C.F.R. § 42.73. For the reasons
discussed below, we determine that Petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that claims 1-7 and 32-42 of the ʼ704 patent are unpatentable.


Yesterday, an 8K was filed noting that the action had been stayed (as expected from the
disclosure above), and that Straight Path has again said it intends to appeal.


The point of all of these problems is that investors have massively overestimated
that revenue potential from Straight Path's very limited patent portfolio. In doing so,
they have bid up the stock price by as much as 100%, adding $100 million in market
cap. The fact is that the realized benefit to Straight Path has only been a few million
dollars.


Future benefits are certain to be very limited, due to the expiring patents and the
fact that elements of the core '704 patent have now been found to be
"unpatentable".


PART II: What about with wireless spectrum?


The fantasy of winning riches from the wireless spectrum game is now turning into a
classic value trap for retail investors. We saw it with the rise (and then plunge) in
Globalstar, and we are now seeing it again with Straight Path.


This is not much different than what we saw with the boom and bust in marijuana stocks
earlier this year, and what we have seen with Ebola stocks in recent weeks.


As with Globalstar, Straight Path is overwhelmingly held by retail investors, and lacks any
meaningful institutional analyst coverage. In both cases, retail investors should ask
themselves why both buy-side and sell-side institutions are shunning these companies as
investment ideas. After all, if there were even modest prospects for large upside,
institutions would be flocking to these stocks in droves. But they are not.


Prior to the spin-off of Straight Path, parent company IDT had acquired the spectrum
assets from Winstar out of bankruptcy in 2001. IDT had paid $55 million for these assets.
Winstar had spent hundreds of millions of these assets, and went bankrupt in the process.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 12/23


The logic of this particular scheme was that paying $55 million for something that had
recently been "worth" several hundred million must be a good deal. The problem was that
just because these assets had "cost" several hundred million didn't mean that they were
"worth" anything at all.


IDT then spent as much as $300 million trying to effect its own build-out on these assets.
But when this failed, the company simply spun off Straight Path as a separate entity to IDT
shareholders. This is the same model that IDT has used for multiple other failed business
ventures, including Genie Energy.


So far, the spectrum assets have proven to be of limited use. Total revenues from
spectrum for the past 2 years have amounted to just $424,000 and $525,000.


But the hope is that the FCC will one day approve the very specific frequencies held by
Straight Path for use in mobile communication networks. At that time, the value of these
spectrum holdings would soar dramatically.


The FCC recently put out a Notice of Inquiry, which I would strongly encourage people to
read.


What it comes down to is this:


The FCC is now simply asking for comments about the implications of opening up the
higher frequencies (above 24 GHz, known as the "millimeter frequencies") for use in
mobile communications, in order to facilitate the eventual development of higher-capacity
"5G" digital networks. The bull case is that one day, this could potentially include the 28
GHz and 39 GHz frequencies where Straight Path has licenses.


The first point should be obvious. This is simply a "Notice of Inquiry", where the FCC is
seeking a wide range of comments on technical and practical implications of opening the
millimeter frequencies. The FCC is simply asking questions, not by any means delivering
policy. As can be seen from the link above, the length and scope of the questions mean
that this is a multi-year discovery process.


The document runs 38 pages long, and concludes with:


The beauty of today's Notice of Inquiry is that no one in this room knows where it will
eventually take us. Which spectrum bands above 24 GHz can be effectively used in
the short term, over the long term ? Will the technologies be mobile or fixed,
unlicensed or licensed ? What equipment will be necessary to utilize these bands ?
Only research and time will tell.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2634745-after-recent-spike-straight-path-could-fall-50-percent 13/23


Investors in Straight Path should pay particular attention to the reference to the use of
unlicensed spectrum, which would end up making the millimeter bands held by Straight
Path largely worthless.


In fact, it is quite clear that the FCC is evaluating a broad range of alternatives for freeing
up spectrum, most of which would have no benefit to Straight Path.


The second point is that there are a number of potential choices above 24 GHz. For
Straight Path, it is clear that it is banking on the 39 GHz far more than on the 28 GHz
(LMDS). The company discloses that:


In the previous two quarters we have worked with a radio vendor that has developed
a next-generation PMP radio that operates in the LMDS (A1) frequency. We have
already entered into Spectrum leases as a result, and we expect the adoption of
PMP to increase due to the cost effectiveness and flexibility to scale due to wide
coverage area sectors.


We expect to work with this and/or other radio vendors to develop a similar offering
in the 39 GHz frequency, where our Spectrum holdings are far greater. The
development of such a radio will take time, and in the interim we are using our
LMDS holdings to demonstrate the proof of concept with the intent of offering a
similar capability in 39 GHz when it is available.


Keep in mind that the "Spectrum leases" which are referred to above are what was
responsible for less than $1 million in revenues in the past two years combined.


The third point is that the advent of 5G networks is expected to happen by around the year
2020 or later. This is a widespread industry forecast, as can be found by simply running a
Google search on "5G 2020". In other words, we are still 6 years away from even the
potential for the widespread use of ANY millimeter spectrum in 5G networks. And again,
there is certainly no guarantee that it will be the 39 GHz that Straight Path made its bet on
13 years ago. Yet, the stock has already doubled in just a few weeks, and now sports a
market cap of over $250 million.


The objective of using millimeter spectrum is to build out backhaul networks for cell phone
voice and data connectivity. The envisioned solution is that small antennae would be
placed close to ground level in high-traffic areas to connect those areas to the fiber optic
network of the carrier. The key limitation is that these millimeter frequencies typically
cannot penetrate intermediate objects, such that they must be used in areas which are

limited to "line of sight". However, there are currently efforts being made to attempt to
mitigate this limitation. These are all part of the issues that the FCC is reviewing to
determine spectrum policy for 5G by 2020.


Conclusion


Shares of Straight Path have doubled in the past month, simply due to extreme hype by
the retail investor base over several press releases and 8Ks in late September. The news
has been interpreted by the retail investors to mean that Straight Path is on the verge of
winning mega patent troll suits against such giants as Apple and Verizon. The hype has
also been driven by a simple blog post from the FCC, requesting comments on the
potential use of millimeter frequencies for cell phone backhaul networks.


The reality is that Straight Path has already demonstrated the full commercial potential of
its patent troll portfolio. Its wins from tech giants such as BlackBerry have recently fallen to
an average of just $600,000 per suit, and that is without taking the 40% cost of litigation
into account. In addition, the patents begin to expire next year, greatly limiting the potential
for future suits. Most importantly, the USPTO has already begun invalidating parts of
Straight Path's core '704 patent as being "unpatentable". As a result, Straight Path may
now be unable to enforce even the pending suits.


In wireless spectrum, Straight Path owns licenses in two bands, the LDMS and the 39GHz
bands. The FCC has only just to evaluate the use of any millimeter frequencies, and is
now only requesting comment in advance of expected 5G rollouts in 2020. There are a
wide range of alternatives for building backhaul networks, including the use of unlicensed
spectrum. However, a blog post by the FCC asking for comments on the use of millimeter
frequencies has also been the reason for the quick doubling of the share price in just a
few weeks. The lengthy regulatory process and key limitations of the millimeter
frequencies mean that any revenue potential from these licenses could be 5-6 years away.
In the meantime, these assets generate just a few hundred thousand dollars per year.


The "news" which has caused Straight Path to double was hardly news at all. The
doubling was more the result of retail hype and a lack of institutional ownership and lack of
research coverage.


We have seen similar irrational price surges and crashes in other retail heavy names
which can trade up solely on misplaced hype and sentiment.


As a result, the share price should be expected to return back to $10.00, from where it
began just a few weeks ago.
