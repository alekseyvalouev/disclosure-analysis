Impac Mortgage: Poor Business Model, Misleading Accounting:
Target: $5.96
May 11, 2015 2:06 PM ET31 comments

Summary


Recent stock runup due solely to acquisition of Cash Call.


Cash Call successfully sued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and a
number of states for deceptive and abusive practices, harassment and charging
customers interest rates of 100%+.


Cash Call is a refinancing machine that generated huge profits in Q1, 2015, but that
won't continue and is already waning.


Most all profits from Cash Call must be paid back to previous owners.


Legacy IMH business continues to lose money.


Impac Mortgage Holdings (NYSEMKT:IMH) has recently experienced a dramatic run-up in
stock price. Starting at around $5 last November, it doubled to $10 in early February, then
on to $15 two weeks ago, and recently peaked at $28. It's already correcting and the
technicals look bad going forward.

Why the runup? There is no good reason. In our opinion, IMH has little value as a
company, and no good future prospects. The only catalyst has been the one-time high
quarterly earnings results put up by IMH in Q1, 2015. IMH reported $2.94 EPS on April 23.
But these numbers were due solely to IMH's recent acquisition of Cash Call ('CC') and
they won't continue going forward. In addition, CC has a dubious history, having been
sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and by a number of states. Given
CC's past, we can only conclude that IMH made the acquisition as a desperate attempt to
save its money-losing business.


Cash Call (NYSE:CC) in the News


Here is some of the history on CC:


In December, 2013, CC was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
for collecting money consumers did not owe. The CFPB alleged that the defendants
engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices, including illegally debiting consumer
checking accounts for loans that were void.

In September, 2014, CC was sued by the West Virginia Attorney General and paid a
$13mm fine after being accused of abusive debt collection in violation of the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). CC allegedly "harassed its consumers through
excessive phone calls throughout the day and night, threatened involving local law
enforcement, disclosing private financial information with friends and acquaintances of the
borrowing consumers, and charging their customers 139 percent interest on the loans
serviced". Cash Call allegedly made 84,371 calls in total to 292 West Virginia borrowers.
That's an average of 289 calls to each borrower.


In October, 2014, the Iowa Department of Justice announced that the Superintendent of
Banking repealed CC's Iowa lending license. CC was banned from lending in Iowa, and
had to pay victimized borrowers $1.5mm. The charges brought for illegally charging Iowa
borrowers interest rates of up to 169% on their loans. CC's defense argued that the loans
were made on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation so were outside the laws of Iowa.


In August, 2013, N.Y. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against CC for
violations of New York's usury and licensed lender laws alleging CC charged annual rates
of interest on loans from 89% to more than 355% to thousands of New York consumers.
CC was ordered to pay 1.5mm in fines and to provide refunds to borrowers.


In December, 2013, Colorado filed a civil complaint accusing CC of operating illegally in
Colorado and servicing and collecting predatory loans made to approximately 5,000
consumers statewide, with annual percentage rates (APRs) that ranged from 90 percent
to in excess of 350 percent. CC again claimed it was not subject to the laws of Colorado
since it was operating under tribal immunity and preemption. But the Denver District Court
rejected those claims.


But CC hasn't stopped these business practices. In February, 2015, California ordered CC
to pay $1mm in fines and restitution to consumers for "exorbitant" interest rates and using
"bait and switch" tactics.


In this section of the Consumer Affairs website, consumers write on their experiences with
CC. There are lists of instances listed with allegations such as interest rates above 100%,
loan balances that increased after payments were made, agents that are "rude and
harassing", "incompetent and shady", "who had more tricks in his vocabulary than
scrabble". The complaints number more than 400 and are as recent as last month - so it's
obvious that CC has not changed its practices.

IMH signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) to acquire CC on January 2nd. The
acquisition closed March 31st. The value of executing the APA on January 2nd is that IMH
was able to include CC's 1st Quarter 2015 results in the results of IMH's previous
operations (the 'Legacy IMH business'). The agreement includes:


· purchase price of $10mm cash (with $5mm due May 5, 2015 and the other $5mm due
over the ensuing 12 months


· 500k shares of IMH stock


· earn-out of:


o 100% of CC earnings for January and February, 2015


o 65% of CC earnings for March thru December, 2015


o 55% of CC earnings for 2016, and


o 45% of CC earnings for 2017


Because it's a call center, CC is a refinance machine. Call centers do very well in
refinancing waves, which is what occurred in 1Q15 and the beginning of 2Q15. But the
wave is waning now due to the recent rally in interest rates. So CC put up a great first
quarter number, but it won't continue. The Legacy IMH business generates losses. That's
why the stock price was at $5. But the significant first quarter operating profits at CC -
even with the continued losses at Legacy IMH - allowed IMH to book non-cash results
(Deferred Tax Asset - DTA) that further improved finance results. Obviously this can't
continue.


IMH ran out of cash in 4Q14 and required a $6mm short-term note investment. Further,
On May 8th IMH announced a convertible deal at 7.50% convertible at $21.5 (Guess there
is always a greater fool). However in this case the Fool was already saddled with a huge
position in the stock that they need to protect. The main lender of the $25M debt raise was
the Pickup family who already owns about 20% of the outstanding shares. They loaned
IMH $20M 2 years ago when the company was out of cash, now they're doing it again.
Now one wonders why they chose such a ridiculous convert level. "hey, lets use $21.5 and
maybe the stock will hang around there and we can get a better price for an equity raise.
Of course it will not matter if the stock ever reaches the convert level, the Pickup's just
want to protect their equity investment. They are loaded with the stock. They are happy to
get a 7.5% interest rate while they hope to eventually offload their equity position for $5-$8
in the future years. The family was the only one willing to make this transaction. The

payment for CC was necessary by May 15th and the company could not find institutional
investors to do it. The Pickup's were just protecting their stock investment. If you listen to
the last conference call 13 minutes in IMH states that it needs $50mm or an additional
$25mm in equity capital this month and needs to complete an equity/debt deal before then
as they have little operating cash today. The company has indicated that the next raise will
most likely be equity, but they have not located any investors at this time.


In the 4Q14 earnings call, IMH reported that CC originations - they bought loans on a
correspondent basis in 4Q14 - were 76% refinances. While they didn't report this same
metric in the 1Q15 results - wherein they now report CC originations as "retail" -
management has stated that when they provide the 10-Q, the refinance % of 1Q15 CC
originations will exceed 4Q14 levels. In other words, it's mostly all refinancing. IMH paid
$140mm for a refinance machine. As a call center originator, it has shown no ability to
originate loans direct to retail in a purchase-dominated market. The press release on the
acquisition was very detailed, i.e. sufficient so that IMH will not have to file a 10-Q
prior to raising capital. This is advantageous as they will not provide detailed data
showing that CC originations are even more refinance-centric than they were in 4Q14.


The Legacy IMH business loses money. For 2014, IMH lost (-$0.68) per share and
has an operating loss of (-$10.8mm). A significant portion of revenue is from Real
Estate Services, money it pays itself for managing its own loan portfolio of behalf of
investors. These are loans originated in prior years and securitized. For managing defaults
and other activities, IMH charges fees. This portfolio is amortizing and these fees will
subside over time.

investment to meet cash requirements.

A LOOK AT 1Q15 RESULTS - THE BENEFIT OF THE OPTICS OF CASH CALL


Cash Call originations were recorded as "retail" in 1Q15 at gross GOS margin of 275bp.
Refinances as a % of total originations exceeded 76% allowing for a very efficient cost-to-
originate of 111bp (very little media spend required), and once again legacy IMH lost
money. Putting aside the change in Fair Value (FV) of debt and the tax accounting, IMH
reported $17mm of operating income in 1Q15, approximately $1.67 per share if you
include the 500k shares issued to Cash Call on 4/1/2015. Management also noted that
$3mm of the $6.5mm MSR charge was mark-to-market of the MSR so if you add that
back, operating earnings were ~$1.94 for the quarter which resulted in a significant rally in
the shares.

IMH Expenses ($17.2mm)


Operating Results at IMH ($6.2mm)


The IMH Legacy business continues to lose money - even more in 1Q15 than it did in prior
quarters - and this in a refinance wave. The impact of buying CC is obvious - a
refinance machine will burden the balance sheet (increased goodwill, increased
intangible assets) but make the income statement look great even though almost all
of the earnings are required to be paid out to CC management.


To be clear, the 164bp above is CC gross GOS of 275bp less its cost to originate of 111bp
(both in the press release). It is recorded in the consolidated IMH as a net number.


FOCUS ON 1Q15 CASH


IMH reported ending cash of $5.6mm which means it burned $4.4mm of cash during the
quarter. The biggest use of cash is the increase in warehouse line haircuts given CC large
origination volumes. As you can see, the $25mm cash payment owed CC puts them at
significant cash deficit requiring a capital raise. We highly suspect IMH sold more
mortgage servicing to raise cash and these funds will be received in 2Q15. Going forward,
IMH is likely to continue selling originated servicing rights, and future earnings streams, to
raise cash to meet warehouse equity obligations and future CC payments.

THE 2015 OPERATING MODEL


Assuming a slow-down in refinancing activity, Legacy IMH will continue to lose money on
an operating basis. Management indicated April originations for CC will be $600mm.


Assuming even a modest decline - not one indicative of a ~80% refinance-driven business
- we estimate 2Q15 net GOS revenue of ~$27mm falls to $16mm in 4Q15 and then
continuing at that level. Obviously GOS could fall much lower if refinancing declines a lot
and the company is not able to generate purchase-related mortgages. There is virtually
no historical evidence of a call center strategy that worked in a purchase market.
These assumptions - probably too optimistic vis-à-vis CC originations - take estimated
2Q15 EPS of $1.24 to $0.51 for 4Q15 and to $0.36 for 4Q16 on a PRE-TAX BASIS. This
assumes $50mm raised at $15 per share plus the convert.


Using a (relatively high-end) multiple of 8x for pre-tax earnings, and after making
adjustments for the contingent payments, the retained portfolio and the RE servicing
runoff, we see a company that looks like it has a value of $33.52 per share now, but
drops to ~$12.99 per share by 4Q15 and then to $5.97 per share by 4Q16:
