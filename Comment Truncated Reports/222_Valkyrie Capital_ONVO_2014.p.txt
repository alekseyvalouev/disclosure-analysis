Best Short Idea In 2014: Organovo Holdings, Inc.
Mar. 10, 2014 8:40 AM ET136 comments
by: Jake Bergmann


Summary


ONVO's promise of creating "3d bio-printed organs" for humans is a pipe dream
decades away, and ONVO has neither the capital nor people necessary to succeed
at such a venture.


ONVO's 3D bioprinting technology is far too slow and expensive to deliver a viable
product for drug toxicity testing, the only near-term market identified by
management.


ONVO's patent protection is extremely weak and does not come close to claiming all
of the methods necessary to "print" human organs in the future.


ONVO scientific co-founder, Gabor Forgacs, has left his role at the company and is
pursuing more viable opportunities (synthetic leather & meat) with notable venture
capital backers.


ONVO executives are cashing out: the top three (Keith Murphy, Barry Michaels and
Sharon Presnell) have sold ~$7 million worth of ONVO stock and pay themselves
nearly $1 million annually.


[Editor's Note: Some facts have been corrected in this article after we were contacted by
Organovo's management]


I am writing this solely to demonstrate high quality trade ideas for my investment firm,
Valkyrie Capital. In doing so, I am putting my personal reputation (and that of my firm) on
the line. I am not a serial short seller and ONVO had originally been brought to me as a
long idea, but after some research, it has become my top short idea for 2014. While I am
short, I am not looking to deliberately "short and distort" either: my position is based on
detailed research, my own deductions and an expectation that Organovo's share price will
decline significantly before December 2014. It's also worth noting I do not post frequently
and my last post recommended long positions in Two Harbors (NYSE:TWO) LEAPs and
levered Annaly Capital (NYSE:NLY) preferred stock on December 16th, which are both up
more than 50% and 18% - 25%, respectively.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 2/50


With that said, I'm recommending a short position in Organovo Holdings, Inc.
(NASDAQ:ONVO) against a long position in Cellular Dynamics, International Inc.
(NASDAQ:ICEL) as well as buying ONVO puts across multiple maturities. This is the first
of two posts, which will detail my short Organovo thesis. The next post will detail my
reasons for upside in Cellular Dynamics.


Short Organovo Thesis


My opinion is that Organovo Holdings, Inc. is a reverse merger company that has grown to
nearly $1 billion in market cap (and uplisted to the NYSE MKT) through a spree of press
releases and what Valkyrie considers a cult-like investor following. Its single largest asset
is $49.8 million of cash raised from selling stock.


ONVO has not developed any products, and its 3D bioprinting "technology" is substantially
slower and more expensive than traditional cell culture techniques. ONVO has no credible
partnerships or institutional investors; the stock is driven solely by press releases and
hype. Once the hype subsides, I believe investors will realize there is no intrinsic value
beyond reported cash in the bank of $0.65 per share - a downside opportunity of more
than 93%.


Organovo investors should sell and instead buy shares of Cellular Dynamics, with a
current market cap of ~$300 million. ICEL "develops and manufactures fully functioning
human cells in industrial quantities to precise specifications." More specifically, Cellular
Dynamics uses stem cells to grow specific human cells, including hepatocytes, which are
the raw materials Organovo must purchase to create liver tissue. ICELs technology is
protected by more than 700 patents + applications and it addresses a near-term market
opportunity of more than $10 billion.


Additional Rationale for Shorting Organovo:


1. Promise of creating "3d bio-printed organs" for humans is a pipe dream decades away,
and ONVO has neither the capital nor people necessary to succeed at such a venture


2. ONVO's 3D bioprinting technology is far too slow and expensive to deliver a viable
product for drug toxicity testing, the only near-term market identified by management


3. ONVO's patent protection is extremely weak and does not come close to claiming all of
the methods necessary to "print" human organs in the future


4. ONVO has no real partnerships; both Autodesk and Knight Cancer Research are over
a year old and neither has claimed any progress since announcement


5. ONVO scientific co-founder, Gabor Forgacs, has left the company and is pursuing
more viable opportunities (synthetic leather & meat) with notable venture capital

backers
6. ONVO executives are cashing out: the top three (Keith Murphy, Barry Michaels and


Sharon Presnell) have sold ~$7 million worth of ONVO stock and pay themselves
nearly $1 million per year while ONVO has no recurring revenue and a burn rate of
~$12 million per year


7. ONVO has few institutional shareholders compared to its peers, and its stock price
appears to be driven by Google searches for "ONVO" rather than revenue or cash flow


Catalysts: 1) I think ONVO's PR campaign is overextended and the speculative money
has been made; 2) Management is both issuing and selling shares on the open market; 3)
based on its own milestones the Company must prove it has a viable product by
December 2014.


Macro Background: 3D Printing


Commercial 3D printing attracted Valkyrie's attention in 2011 with the Economist's feature
"Print me a Stradivarius." At that time, total 3D printing revenues were ~$2 billion
(primarily prototyping and some limited manufacturing) and cash flow earned by the
market leaders, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE:DDD), was a
scant $70 million or so. Fast forward to today and cash flow for these two companies has
doubled to ~$140 million while their market cap increased to nearly $14 billion at the peak.


While commercialized 3D manufacturing may be revolutionary, we are in the very early
days. If the tech bubble taught us anything, it should be that 100x EV/EBITDA ratios are
not good investments - no matter how promising the technology. There is just too much
risk associated with early stage ventures to pay exorbitant prices.


Nowhere in my research, however, did I find viable investments in 3D bioprinting of human
organs. To be honest, I first heard about bioprinting through my wife because 3D organs
were featured on Grey's Anatomy. It makes great television, but the technology is decades
away at the earliest. Regular 3D printing is in its infancy: 3D bioprinting of living human
organs for implant is still a pipe dream.


Today 3D bioprinting is almost exclusively performed as research, and I can't find any
information on a "market" for 3D bioprinting. One group estimates a potential market of
$112 million by 2020 and $307 million by 2023. This is tiny and 6-9 years away. Moreover,
ONVO isn't even the leader in 3D bioprinting or regenerative medicine (as is often claimed
by investors). A simple Google search up turns up several prominent universities doing
more advanced work than Organovo:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 4/50


The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (which is moving away from
bioprinting due to high cost)
Princeton and Cornell have printed working human ears
University of Pennsylvania is printing vascular networks
Chinese universities are printing kidneys
A Sunnyvale, CA open source hackerspace group known as BioCurious (yes, really)
even created their own 3D bioprinter from scratch using, "a couple of old CD drives, an
inkjet cartridge, and an Arduino"!


Hepatotoxicity Testing is Intensely Competitive


Understandably, Organovo doesn't pretend 3D organs are around the corner, but instead
focuses on printing 3D liver samples for drug toxicity testing (known as hepatotoxicity).
Hepatotoxicity testing, however, is not a revolutionary new market; it is an intensely
competitive niche of pharmaceutical drug development.


(Source:"Diagnosing the decline in pharmaceutical R&D efficiency." Jack W. Scannell,
Alex Blanckley, Helen Boldon & Brian Warrington. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 11,
191-200 (March 2012)."


To better understand the opportunity in hepatotoxicity, I consulted Ph.D.s and academic
research (the most important of which is available here). The short story is that big
pharma is spending more on drug development while receiving fewer FDA approvals
(humorously referred to "Eroom's Law" in the pharma industry).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 5/50


Specifically, big pharma now spends almost 20% of revenue (~$70 billion annually) on
drug R&D. Only 5 out of every 10,000 compounds reach clinical trials and of these only 2-
3 out of 10 recoup their cost. In total, the average cost to develop a new drug (including
failures) is $0.4 - $1.8 billion and can take 10-15 years from discovery to approval.


Hepatotoxicity is a major cause (estimated up to 1/3) of drug development failure. Up to
50% of liver failure is caused by "Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)" and during 1995 - 2005,
34 drugs were withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity.


Due to the high cost of drug development and high likelihood of hepatotoxicity, it is
crucially important for big pharma to test for hepatotoxicity early and accurately. To-date,
there have been two methods for testing a drug's hepatotoxicity: in vivo ("in the body")
with live rats or in vitro ("outside the body") with 2D or 3D liver tissue samples.


It is important to note here that 3D liver test samples - considered the Holy Grail by
Organovo's management - already exist and are being supplied to most of the big pharma
companies at low cost by InSphero. InSphero can produce tens of thousands of 3D
cultures in a matter of days compared to a full month required to produce 400 samples by
ONVO.


I questioned Organovo's CFO and IR team via email about InSphero, specifically asking,
"I've heard that 3D printing of liver tissue is substantially slower and far more expensive
than traditional cell culture techniques employed by InSphero? What do you view as
Organovo's competitive advantage in hepatotoxicity testing?" IR's reply is telling:


"In regard to 3D liver competitive positioning - we believe that the data that we have
publicly described demonstrates superiority over the current market standard which
dominates market share, the use of hepatocytes in traditional 2D cell culture. We
also believe that because we are actively working towards launching the world's only
3D liver tissue that recreates human liver structure and activity, that if we reach that
goal, our 3D liver tissue will offer characteristics superior to all potential competitor
products."


I love "actively working towards" and "if we reach that goal" (I could say the same thing
about winning the lottery)! More importantly, Organovo does not even address their
primary competitor, InSphero, or the higher cost and time it takes for Organovo to produce
the same 3D product as InSphero. Instead, it states the "data publicly described" (note it's
data, not a product) is superior traditional 2D cell culture.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 6/50


In regards to 3D samples being superior, there isn't yet conclusive scientific evidence that
3D samples are superior to 2D samples. 2D samples can be more easily measured for
hepatotoxicity whereas 3D samples cannot be viewed in the same plane (which makes
toxicity measurements difficult). Moreover, in vitro testing (either 2D or 3D) will never fully
replace in vivo testing with live rats, because even 3D liver tissue cannot accurately
replicate the complexity of a living organ.


Per the above cited paper by van Tonder, Steenkamp and Gulumian:


"The ultimate goal of predictive toxicology would be to develop techniques that can
be used in vitro. However, it should also be noted that it is highly unlikely that animal
studies will be avoided altogether, at least not for the foreseeable future, which
leaves room for in vivo profiling technologies as adjuvants to conventional safety
pharmacology testing. In fact, it may help justify the use of animals for safety
pharmacology testing. It is not impossible to employ these technologies using in vitro
platforms, but more research is necessary to develop and establish effective
methodologies and biomarkers."


Hepatotoxicity testing is an important decision milestone in drug development, but
Organovo's potential product (if developed) will not be a silver bullet. It will be too
expensive and too slow and face intense competition from InSphero (backed by
RedAlpine), Hurel (backed by Sanofi-Aventis), Vivo Biosciences and heavyweights like
Sigma-Aldrich (NASDAQ:SIAL) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO).


Intellectual Property is Weak


As outlined above, Organovo isn't the only company (or even the first) to create a 3D
bioprinter. Of note, EnvisionTEC, a German company, has been selling its 3D Bioplotter
since 2001. Second, Organovo didn't even create its own "NovoGen MMX Bioprinter" in
house: development was outsourced to an Australian company named Invetech. Anthony
Bozza, of Lakewood Capital Management, also found the NovoGen MMX to be something
of a joke in his letter and this article:

"We were lucky enough to have found one university professor (and
prominent tissue researcher) who had evaluated Organovo's machine for
purchase…she pointed out that it was cheaper to build the machine in-house
with 'a few grad students.' Surely, a machine made by 'a few grad students'
would never match up against the revered product of a $1 billion market
capitalization company like Organovo," his letter notes, setting up the punch
line. "We asked the professor how much they had to sacrifice in terms of
quality by making it themselves. She responded, 'Oh no, our machine is
better.'"


Third, and most importantly, investors hoping Organovo's patents will claim all rights to 3D
organ printing are going to be disappointed:


The Clemson patent (US Patent No 7051654) only claims a method for forming viable
cells, "wherein at least about 25% of said cells remain viable on said substrate after
incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees C in a 5% CO.sub.2/95% O.sub.2 environment"
- hardly an all-encompassing claim on 3D organ printing (who wants a 25% alive
organ?).
The first Forgacs patent (US Patent No 8241905) appears to provide the broadest
protection, but only includes one claim covering "A method of producing a three-
dimensional biological engineered tissue" with no mention of cell life-span or entire
organ fabrication.
Organovo has another 5 applications into the USPTO (see patent application numbers
20140012407, 20130345794, 20130190210, 20130164339, 20120116568), but all the
application dates are within the past 1-3 years. For those unfamiliar with patent law, an
invention must be statutory, useful, non-obvious, and new. Both EnvisionTEC and Dr.
Anthony Atala at Wake Forest have publicly discussed and demonstrated 3D
bioprinting technology more than a year before Organovo existed, which is longer than
the 1 year requirement to be considered "new" under Section 102 of US Code 35.
Thus, I think Organovo has a minimal chance of receiving additional patents on
its 3D bioprinting process.


The intellectual property required to engineer living human organs will likely require
hundreds or thousands of patents claiming every method of fabrication. Claiming that a
single company (especially one with just 3 patents!) owns the rights to the entire 3D
bioprinting process is absurd. It's like claiming a single company owns all the rights to
manufacturing motor vehicles or smartphones.

By comparison, Cellular Dynamics has over 700 patents+applications for the manufacture
of human cells. At a $235 million market cap, ICEL trades at $335,714 per patent vs.
ONVO's outrageous $114 MILLION per patent. Yes, that means ONVO is 340 times more
expensive than ICEL on a per patent basis! And as a prelude to my next post, ICEL also
has a bigger market opportunity and a far more credentialed and experienced
management team.


Organovo's Partnerships are Questionable at Best


Organovo's lack of in-house technology or valuable patents probably explains why they
can't find a long-term research partner or acquirer. Investor presentations and press
releases hype up "partnerships" with pharmaceutical (like Pfizer, Harvard and UTH here)
but the only one I can verify with the actual partner is Knight Cancer Institute, and when I
called, Knight said there was nothing new they could report and they couldn't provide
further info without approval from Organovo. I ran into similar walls with Autodesk and
Invetech, both whom had to "check with the company first" and then never followed-up or
couldn't comment. Interestingly, L'Oreal (which ONVO claims as a partner) lists its
research partners for toxicity testing online:


"Private Sector Partnerships" refers to for-profit enterprise and Organovo is not listed (but
most of its competitors are there).


I also called multiple departments at L'Oreal, Pfizer and United Therapeutics. No one at
those companies knew of a partnership with Organovo. These are all large companies, so
it's possible I didn't find the right department or person. Given the importance of these
partnerships, however, I think investors should demand more information from Organovo's

management than a press release that says, "Organovo Holdings, Inc. has entered into an
agreement with L'Oreal exploring the use of 3D skin for testing skin care products. Terms
have not been disclosed."


Moreover, management hasn't provided any progress on other partnerships, many of
which are several years old but still touted in public investor presentations. When I
questioned IR about the partnerships, it refused to provide an update, responding:


"you noted that 'I've already reached out to contacts at Invetech, Autodesk and
Knight Cancer Research (all of whom declined to provide an update) and I've been
unable to identify the key people at United Therapeutics, Pfizer or L'Oreal.' We are
not trying to be overly harsh or reactionary in saying this, but we think it's entirely
appropriate for these partners to decline to update you, and entirely inappropriate
that you reached out to them directly."


Okay, "we are not trying to be overly harsh or reactionary," REALLY? I've spoken with
many management teams, and this is the first that DID NOT want me to speak with their
business partners and/or clients. Most companies love to make introductions to their
customers and business partners. They'll cherry pick the best ones, but they always
provide contact information for clients who can verify said company's services. Organovo
has no real customers to speak of, and they refuse to provide contact info or updates on
their partnerships? Does this mean they can't even find one partner they trust enough to
talk positively about the company?


I seriously question if all of these hyped up partnerships actually exist, and I certainly think
Organovo's management owes its shareholders regular progress updates on these
partnerships since they have no meaningful quarterly earnings to report.


Gabor Forgacs, the Scientific Co-Founder, has Moved on to Greener Pastures


In my view, however, the most telling sign of Organovo's weak competitive position is the
exit of its scientific co-founder, Dr. Gabor Forgacs, and his son, Andras Forgacs. The
Forgacs moved on to new ventures in 2013 to pursue what I believe is a more viable
business model in 3D bioprinting: synthetic leather and cultured meat. Organovo's
management claims Gabor still "consults" with ONVO, but that is yet another "claim" - like
ONVO's partnerships - that is impossible to verify. What we do know is that Andras
resigned from the Board of Directors and Gabor is no longer listed on the website.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 10/50


More importantly, the Forgacs's new company, Modern Meadow, is built on the same
intellectual property as Organovo and is backed by Peter Thiel's Breakout Foundation,
Artis Ventures, ULU Ventures, the Singularity University, the USDA and the National
Science Foundation. None of these notable venture investors have backed Organovo. In
fact, it seems Organovo has rarely had a significant percentage of institutional investors -
even its first $3.5M "angel" round included 57 people!


ONVO Has Few Institutional Investors; Share Price Appears Driven by Google
Searches


Institutional holdings of Organovo are only 16.4% according to Morningstar, of which 8.9%
are owned by ETFs, leaving less than 10% owned by institutions that perform professional
security analysis. Other large biotech firms have institutional ownership percentages
between 80% and 90%, and even ICEL (at a $235M market cap), has 58% institutional
ownership. Institutional owners typically perform more due diligence than most retail
investors, so the lack of institutional owners or partners should be a red flag for investors.


Another red flag should be the correlation between Google searches for ONVO and the
stock price. I pulled the frequency of searches for "ONVO" and compared it to the stock
price over the past 2 years. It appears that ONVO's share price is driven more by Google
searches than any fundamental measurement. I may be old school for thinking this, but
shouldn't the share price go up based on revenue and earnings rather than publicity?


Organovo's Management Team is Cashing Out


The R&D team may be researching real challenges in 3D organ printing, but the
management team looks like it's using the high share price and public financings to cash
out personally. Keith Murphy, the CEO, even warns investors to ignore "short and distort"
articles. Blind adherence is rarely a good investment strategy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2077693-best-short-idea-in-2014-organovo-holdings-inc 11/50


While asking its shareholders to ignore the short sellers, Organovo's management team is
selling $7.4 million worth of shares, with CEO Keith Murphy unloading $1M per month
since November 2013. The salaries of the top three insiders combined (CEO Keith
Murphy, CFO Barry Michaels and CTO Sharon Presell) are more than $800k per year -
this is multiples of what Organovo paid to license its hyped-up patent rights!! Management
should not get rich while burning through shareholder cash. Most start-up founders pay
themselves less than $75K/year, and Peter Thiel (notably NOT an investor in Organovo)
describes low founder salaries as an indicator of success because: "It goes to whether the
mission of the company is to build something new or just collect paychecks. In practice we
have found that if you only ask one question, ask that."


Per Seeking Alpha's due diligence requirements, I asked Organovo IR about the high
salaries and stock sales. Their response (predictably) is to simply quote their Rule 10b5-1
trading plan and Compensation Committee filings. They claim compensation is in line (or
even below) peers, but per Peter Thiel's advice, investors should question management's
motives, especially given the long time and low probability of ONVO ever delivering a
viable product.


Organovo requested a clarification to the above paragraph; asking me to note that their
response only referred to 10b5-1 and Compensation Committee filings, asked for my
"exact comparison peer companies" and that "it was compensation strategy of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to provide a cash component to
executives that was significantly below median for our peer group."


As noted in the paragraph above, I maintain that ONVO should not have become a public
company until they had developed viable products that generate sustainable revenue.
Thus, its management compensation should be similar to an early development stage or
start-up company. Per ONVO's objection, however, I will also detail my opinion on why
their executive compensation is still high relative to publicly traded peers:


Using Morningstar, I compared both CEO and Total Executive annual compensation
(including salary, stock options, etc - but excluding stock sales) to both ttm revenue and
ttm burn rate (defined as total operating expenses) for all biotech companies which went
public in 2012. Because ONVO is a pre-revenue, development stage company, I believe
the best way to compare executive compensation among different sized companies is not
absolute dollars, but rather the percent of either revenue or operation expenses spent on
executive compensation.

I divided ONVO's public peers into two groups: 1) Development Stage (either zero or
<$5M ttm revenue) including KYTH, ICPT, DRTX, TSRO, SUPN and MSTX; and 2)
Revenue Stage (>$5M ttm revenue) including RGLS, HPTX, MACK, CCXI, CEMP and
VSTM. On average, Development Stage biotech firms pay their CEO 3% of burn rate and
they pay their entire executive team 6% of burn rate. ONVO pays its CEO 8% of burn rate
and its entire management 22% of burn rate - that is 2.9x and 3.7x the average for
development stage peers.


If anything, ONVO's executive compensation is more in line with revenue stage peers
(which ONVO is not yet at revenue stage). Full detail is provided in this spreadsheet. All
data is from Morningstar:


Management's historical performance doesn't help either. There is no demonstrated
record of start-up success and Barry Michaels prior two stints as a public company CFO
ended as zeroes:

In addition to cashing out personally, management has filed a shelf registration to issue
shares "at-the-market." Their investor presentation (page 29) claims it is less dilutive than
a marketed public offering, but we strongly suspect it is because they cannot attract any
institutional investors to anchor another share raise. So they are selling shares directly to
retail buyers in the open market!


The entertainment continues with the following slide justifying "the importance of sufficient
capital." "7.5% dilution would double opportunities" (dilution isn't bad, it's great!) and
"Avoid more significant dilution during market downturns or when cash on hand is low"
(aka [in my opinion] we gotta sell this sh*t while it's hot!). Best of all is page 31 warning
investors to, "remain on guard against spurious information." That's good advice in
general - does it also apply to Organovo's investor presentations?


Summary, Valuation and Trade Idea


Given all of the above information, it's interesting to take a look at "Organovo Highlights"
from the Investor Relations section of the website:

1. Statement number one is just false: as best we can tell EnvisionTEC developed the
world's first commercial 3D bioprinting technology


2. Statement number two might technically be true, but InSphero creates "fully cellular"
3D liver tissue (and sells it for profit!) faster and in greater quantities than ONVO -
adding the bioprinter just takes longer; it's like bragging about building a house behind
schedule and over budget


3. Number 3: Should I invest because they were written up in MIT's tech review?
4. Number 4: TIME? Really? Not even technical validation there…
5. Number 5: There is no timeline, no financial details were released (I bet ONVO is


paying ADSK) and ADSK hasn't confirmed they are actually doing anything!
6. Number 6: This is the real kicker - they list 15 media outlets but no customers or


partners!


Since inception, Organovo has earned a paltry $0.04 of revenue per share, spent $13.5
million on R&D, issued 29 press releases and raised $77 million in capital. In a best case
scenario ONVO is barely worth the $0.64 per share of cash on its books (and even this
will probably be paid out to lawyers and liquidators).


Organovo has minimal institutional shareholders combined with stock uplistings, large
insider ownership and exciting new technology. It reminds me of the Poseidon Concepts
hydraulic fracking pool scheme that blew up last year. POOSF was listed on the TSX 500,
made it to the $1 billion valuation mark and even had a big 4 auditor! Its management

team owned more than 10% of the outstanding stock. The company was constantly in the
media and even picked up equity analysts from large Canadian banks (Organovo hasn't
even done that). Everyone was in love with Poseidon Concepts: then it collapsed.


Therefore, I recommend shorting ONVO stock against a long position in Cellular
Dynamics and buying put options on ONVO. ONVO shares are liquid with ~2 days to
cover per the last NASDAQ report, but the borrow rate ranges from 27% - 39% if you can
even find shares to short. Options are surprisingly liquid for ONVO, so I'd recommend a
short call spread and long puts.*


*Note there was some confusion about option strategies on my last post. This is just an
example of how Valkyrie executes trades: options are not for everyone and you should
consult your own financial advisor and do your own due diligence before making any
financial decision.


Risks


1. ONVO's share price trades on hope and dreams and the milestones are set by
the company, so management could continue the charade for a while. I think the
PR campaign has run its course and take my cue from management that now is the
time to sell. They've set December 2014 as their milestone for delivering a viable liver
toxicity assay, and I think a lack of progress and/or sales will disappoint before then.
Also, the long position in ICEL should hedge against any irrational bull run in biotech
stocks.


2. The US government is increasing its funding for 3D printing and Organovo could
get a significant research grant. There are dozens of universities developing this
technology with better teams and credentials than Organovo, but never underestimate
government ineptitude.


3. Organovo could be acquired by a larger pharmaceutical or biotech company. We
think this is extremely unlikely. Organovo has been shopping its ideas around for two
years now without any serious suitors or institutional investors.


4. Short Squeeze. This is always possible, especially in a bull market. However, the
stock is very liquid with ~2 days to cover and there aren't any large Carl Icahns who
might corner me on this, so I think the likelihood of a deliberate short squeeze is quite
low.

The company is usually recently founded through the reverse merger of a shell
company and with the name changed accordingly to address a particular exciting
disruptive technology such as 3D Printing, Nano Drug Delivery, Graphene, Solar, etc.)
The company possesses one patent or a small number of patents that are said to
address an application of said disruptive technology. These patents will usually be
acquired in the reverse merger or invented by someone in senior management whose
credentials and past successes are heavily touted.
The company's marketing materials, financial statements, SEC filings, etc., will expand
upon in great detail the size of the market opportunity and just how exciting of an
opportunity exists as opposed to the success of their product in capturing revenue
from said market application.
Many individuals on stock message boards such as the ones found on Yahoo Finance
will suddenly start posting messages touting the merits of the stock using phrases
such as "load up," "get on the train," "the next Microsoft," "easy ten bagger," etc.
Any constructive criticism of the company will be met with accusations of short selling
when in fact the short selling of OTC stocks is very difficult and rare.
The company will not have any significant revenues but will keep announcing
partnerships, memorandums of understanding, and agreements that never result in
meaningful revenues.
In addition to the original technology focus, the company will then start to identify other
application opportunities for their technology when the original opportunity does not
transpire.
They will then continue issuing private placements to support the company until the
share price completely collapses and the long-term shareholders are left holding
shares that are worthless.
