Plus500 appears to have an undisclosed Belize subsidiary called
Geostrading Ltd. Plus500 previously ran an unlicensed operation under the
brand 10pips.com.


Plus500 admits to unlicensed activity in its Admission Document. It is interesting to review what that
actually entailed.

http://www.cablecarcapital.com/your-capital-at-risk-part-7/ 2/12


Two very useful websites, the historical whois records lookup on Domaintools.com and the Wayback
Machine, reveal elements of Plus500′s past that it has not chosen to share with investors. In the
Admission Document, Plus500 discloses only the existence of a dormant Cyprus subsidiary called
MeVideoCY, without any discussion of what this subsidiary was or what it did. Unmentioned entirely is
another entity that may or may not actually exist: Geostrading Ltd, a Belize-based entity also referred
to as Plus500 Ltd, Belize.


I have been unable to locate any records of this entity other than its repeated mention on Plus500 and
10pips.com marketing materials still scattered around the Internet. Google “Geostrading Ltd” and
every result is related to Plus500 in some way. There is an excerpt from an old English-Malay
translation request. There is a Spanish-language affiliate’s website dated 27 December 2012 that still
refers to Plus500 as being operated by Geostrading Ltd. There is even an amusing discussion thread
in which a Plus500 representative tries to convince skeptical moderators of a website validation
service, Web of Trust, that its business is legitimate. And of course there is 10pips.com, which I will
discuss in a moment.


First, consider the text on the bottom of the Plus500 About Us page over time:


2 January 2009: “Plus500 is operated by: MeVideoCY Ltd, Larnaca, Cyprus.”
31 October 2009: “Plus500 is operated by: Plus500 Ltd, Belize.”
2 May 2010:  ”Plus500 is operated by: Geostrading Ltd.”


Beginning in July 2010, after Plus500UK received its FSA license, the phrase disappears entirely.


Whois records also reflect these changes. Note the UK (+44) country code for the phone and fax
numbers for the Belize entities. There also seems to be a private joke of some sort listing the
administrative contact as “Hedge” Haber, perhaps a play on Gal Haber’s name.

“10 pips a day – that’s all you need to become a millionaire…”


Wayback Machine archives of 10pips.com reveal a strange evolution from an online backgammon
affiliate site to a fully-fledged trading platform operated by MeVideoCY very similar to Plus500.


2007: 10pips.com is a placeholder.
8 October 2008: 10pips.com links to Gammoned.com, an online backgammon website
11 February 2009: 10pips.com is now a mock-up of a CFD provider, but has yet to describe itself
15 March 2009: “10Pips platform is operated by: MeVideoCY Ltd, Larnaca, Cyprus.”
12 June 2010: The last capture before 10pips.com was closed on 14 July 2010.
8 August 2010: By August, 10pips.com was replaced with a redirect to Plus500.


10pips.com also includes a link to the “Costumer agreement” from March 2009 that makes explicit its
operation by MeVideoCY. (They caught the typo by July). The user agreement page remained active
until November 2013, although Plus500 states in the Admission Document from July 2013 that
MeVideoCY was already dormant.


References to Geostrading Ltd instead of MeVideoCY as the operator of 10pips.com  appear on
some affiliate websites:


10PIPS platform is operated since 2008 by: Geostrading Ltd. Albert Street
Belize City, 8024. Belize. Fax Number: +44 203 002 7290, Email:
support@10pips.com


Apparently, 10pips.com ran an active affiliate marketing scheme and international unlicensed CFD
business right up until Plus500UK received its FSA authorization. The website was pulled without
warning less than 3 weeks before the license was granted, angering some affiliates. More on affiliate
marketing and 10pips.com in Part 9.


In addition to the warnings from regulators in Hong Kong, Quebec, and Brazil already cataloged by
Dan McCrum, the activities of Plus500 generated additional warnings from Slovenia and Greece.
Cyprus warned both Plus500 and MeVideoCY in 2009, although apparently all is forgotten now that
Plus500 has received a license from Cyprus. Most recently, the Croatian regulator issued a warning to

Plus500UK in 2012 before being forced to backtrack in 2013 due to the passporting mechanism of
Plus500′s UK license in the rest of Europe. The Croatian regulator nevertheless stands by its warning
to customers. Perhaps investors should heed it as well.
