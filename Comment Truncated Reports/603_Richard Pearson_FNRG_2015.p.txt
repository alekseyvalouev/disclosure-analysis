ForceField Energy: Undisclosed Promotions And Management
Connections To Past Frauds
Apr. 15, 2015 9:30 AM ET63 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Heavily promoted by multiple paid promoters (including undisclosed).


Stock has spiked to an all-time high.


Company is out of cash and is delinquent in its filings.


Management with close connections to past frauds.


Expect a very near-term financing to drop the stock by at least 30-40%.


Short Thesis


This is not an article about ForceField Energy's (OTC:FNRG) business. It is about paid
stock promotion and connections to past fraudulent activity.


ForceField Energy is a paid-for stock promotion targeting retail investors. Institutional
investment in the company totals just 1% of outstanding shares. ForceField is a company
which is out of money and clearly needs to sell stock in the very near term. There has
been a flurry of promotions over the past few weeks and months, indicating that a
financing is likely imminent.


The promotions have worked and the stock is now hitting all-time highs on increased
volume.


Management members have close ties to past fraudulent companies and activities.


Meanwhile, the company has still not filed its annual report (Form 10-K). As soon as the
10-K is filed (potentially within days), ForceField will take advantage of the share price run
up to issue a large amount of stock. The stock will likely trade back to around $3.00-$4.00
in the near term.


ForceField is currently running on fumes. As of its most recent financials, ForceField had
just $500,000 in cash. It had been reported that ForceField had sold its interest in
TransPacific Energy for $2.0 million. However, it was the case that ForceField only
received $50,000 in cash. The remaining $1,950,000 was in fact just hypothetical. The

"buyer" simply returned its shares of ForceField (which had been owned by the buyer)
which were then simply cancelled by ForceField. The cancelled shares are worth nothing
and cannot be resold. As a result, ForceField only received $50,000 not $2.0 million.


ForceField has never been cash flow positive. Its only source of cash has been the
issuance of new shares. ForceField recently completed several new acquisitions using
stock. These acquisitions will increase expenses and cash burn, such that ForceField will
need to raise substantial proceeds as soon as the delinquent 10-K is completed.


Background


In the past, there has been some debate about the validity of the business at ForceField
Energy. After several failed iterations in the past, ForceField's most recently adopted line
of business is the installation of LED and other energy efficient lighting.


Critics of ForceField's business model mostly share the same concerns as critics of
comparable LED installer Revolution Lighting (NASDAQ:RVLT). Revolution once traded
as high as $5.00 (a valuation of over $700 million), but has since plunged 80% to around
$1.00. Revenues have continued to build strongly for Revolution, but net losses have
increased even more. Despite the headline enthusiasm for the major shift to LED lighting,
there is simply too much competition in this low margin business to ever realize a profit.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3071896-forcefield-energy-undisclosed-promotions-and-management-connections-to-past-frauds 3/26


Revolution currently has a market cap of around $150 million based on quarterly revenues
of $27 million. Meanwhile (following the stock promotion), ForceField also has a market
cap of around $150 million despite quarterly revenues of just $2 million. On this basis
alone, it is clear that ForceField has a long way to fall.


In fact, prior to a recent acquisition, ForceField had no material revenue. The recent
revenues are simply the result of acquiring an existing installer (which was acquired for
stock) which already had revenues.


Like Revolution, the primary catalyst which has driven the stock up has been the repeated
partnerships being announced with companies that might allow ForceField to expand its
sales. But as we can see from Revolution, even obtaining massive sales in this business
still does not allow for even remote profitability.


Note in the chart below that revenues at Revolution have grown massively from $4
million to $77 million in 3 years. Yet profitability is as elusive as ever. This is why
the stock price is down 80% from its peak.


But again, this is not an article about ForceField's business model. It is an article
about a paid stock promotion and connections to past fraudulent activity.


The history of Forcefield

ForceField began its life as a Chinese reverse merger known as SunSi, focused on the
manufacture in China of a certain chemical used in the production of polysilicon. Note that
this is NOT simply the history of the shell company. The Chinese SunSi was run by current
ForceField management David Natan and Richard St. Julien, who still run the company
today.


The Chinese activities failed to produce meaningful results. More importantly, in 2011,
Chinese reverse mergers became uninvestable due to rampant fraud in the space. There
was clearly no money to be made by running a Chinese reverse merger.


As a result, Natan and St. Julien simply changed the name of the company and moved its
nominal operations to Costa Rica as they searched for a new business definition.


The company's next venture was via TransPacific Energy, making "Organic Rankine
Cycle" units to maximize heat recovery and minimize waste. After a back and forth fraud
lawsuit, ForceField sold TransPacific back to its original owners for $50,000 cash and the
return of stock.


Most recently, the company is now in the business of being a distributor of LED lighting
which it buys from a single manufacturer in China. In March of 2013, the company formed
a subsidiary in Costa Rica. Up until its recent acquisition of American Lighting ("ALD") the
company had noted that "All of the Company's long-lived assets are located in Costa
Rica."


You may ask "why Costa Rica?" That will become clear later in this article.


The bull thesis on ForceField is that it has bid on over $100 million worth of lighting jobs.
The bull case states that if the company were to realize even a fraction of that pipeline, it
would send the stock sharply higher.


First off, we should again note that Revolution is already doing $76 million in sales without
coming close to turning a profit. Yet that company is only valued at $150 million.


But there is something else that isn't right here either. A full $95 million of this
supposed "pipeline" is comprised of a single job which ForceField bid on, but
which has yet to be fulfilled. Aside from that, all remaining hoped-for jobs total just
$5 million. It is next to nothing.


The $95 million job is simply a red herring designed to prop up the share price. And
so far, promoters have successfully used this to run up the share price. We will see
more about this below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3071896-forcefield-energy-undisclosed-promotions-and-management-connections-to-past-frauds 5/26


ForceField and stock promotions


In the past, ForceField was a Dream Team client. The Dream Team was a firm that got
paid to write undisclosed paid articles, which were edited and approved by management
teams of their clients. The retail targeted articles were designed to prop up the share price
and volume so that companies could issue stock to raise money. The scam worked
exceptionally well.


But now there is a new generation of different promoters which use a variety of
techniques. What we can see is clear evidence of recent promotions at the precise
time when ForceField needs to issue stock to raise money.


This creates two immediate concerns.


First, the share price is artificially way too high as a result of the promotions.


Second, the stock is about to head sharply lower due to an upcoming and much
needed financing.


In the near term, I expect to see ForceField hit $3.00-4.00. Over the longer term, it should
trade substantially lower.


Before getting into the current round of promotions, it is useful to review ForceField's
involvement with the Dream Team Group.


Back in 2014, I wrote a detailed article about stock promotion firm "The Dream Team
Group" which was hiring out writers to conduct undisclosed paid promotions on small cap
companies. The writers would pretend to be well qualified industry experts putting forth a
professional analysis (and a strong buy) on a stock. In fact, they were simply hired gun
writers with no credentials whatsoever. Yet their professional writings invariably caused
their target stocks to soar. The authors managed to infiltrate a wide variety of locations,
including Forbes.com, TheStreet.com, Seeking Alpha and the Wall Street Cheat Sheet.


To gain information, I posed as a paid stock promoter looking to write undisclosed paid
articles. The chief writer for the Dream Team (Tom Meyer) then began giving me
assignments.


The main stocks I wrote about in this promotion scandal were Galena Biopharma (GALE)
and CytRx (NASDAQ:CYTR), both of which ended up plunging by as much as 50-80%
when the promotions unraveled. CytRx has rebounded some, while Galena has continued
to plunge.

But there were other companies which I did not give as much attention to because they
were too small or illiquid to matter at the time. (Although I did not write about many of
these stocks, I did notify all of the various websites such as Seeking Alpha, TheStreet.com
and Wall Street Cheat Sheet so that they could remove any articles and ban any violating
authors).


ForceField Energy is one such stock. At the time, it was one of a number of beaten down
illiquid stocks which didn't seem to be catching the promotional wave. But now it appears
that the continued promotional efforts have resulted in the stock hitting all-time highs on
much greater volume. This is all occurring just as the company needs to raise money.


ForceField was a paid Dream Team promotion which was written about by both Tom
Meyer (multiple aliases including Wonderful Wizard and others) and John Mylant. These
were the two main Dream Team writers. Their articles have since been removed from
Seeking Alpha, but the original references can still be found in various places. In addition,
ForceField is listed here among the other Dream Team clients on the Investors Hub page
for Mission IR. Mission IR was the Dream Team subsidiary responsible for handling the
paid articles.


Mr. Meyer was also attempting to recruit me as a paid writer specifically for
ForceField. ForceField was an ongoing project of his.


It should be kept in mind that the standard process for these writers was to submit
their drafts to management at the target company for review before publishing. In
other words, management of these companies knew and encouraged the illegal
stock promotion as a way of getting their share prices up.


But now it seems that a variety of other promoters have taken the helm from the now
defunct Dream Team Group.


One such promoter is "Goldman Small Cap Research" (no connection to Goldman
Sachs). As it turns out, Tom Meyer from the Dream Team was moonlighting for Goldman
Small Cap Research in addition to working for the Dream Team. Tom informed me that the
primary advantage of writing articles for Goldman Small Cap Research was that he gets
paid with money orders made out to "cash" such that he could avoid paying taxes or
being traced.


Tom had assigned me to write an article for Goldman Small Cap on LiveDeal
(NASDAQ:LIVE), which I sent to him for his review and for company approval. Tom had
been writing his articles for LiveDeal using a female alias by the name of Christine

Andrews at places such as TheStreet.com and Wall Street Cheat Sheet. (Those sites
were informed and those articles have since been removed)


After I submitted my article, Tom responded with edits and a new title. This is a copy of the
edits provided to me by Rob Goldman for an undisclosed paid article on LiveDeal which
was requested to appear on either TheStreet.com or Seeking Alpha. Goldman Small Cap
continues to engage in paid promotions for Live Deal, as shown. (Note: I never accepted
payments for any articles and I saw to it that none of the draft articles would ever be
published).


The point of all of this is simply that Goldman Small Cap is a pay to play research firm
used for hyping microcap stocks.


So now let's see how Goldman Small Cap covers ForceField Energy.


Tom, along with Dream Team's John Mylant, both had previously written multiple articles
on multiple sites on ForceField, touting it as a strong buy. Goldman Small Cap has now
taken over directly for Tom and just a few weeks ago released a report on ForceField,
hyping the company with a $10 target, stating:


"ForceField Energy has recently achieved a new 52-week high on strong volume via
the strength of very favorable news on the business development front and appears
primed to continue this trend. A diversified green energy provider, FNRG's recently
acquired subsidiaries enable the Company to serve as distributors, installers, and
managers of large scale LED lighting projects for Fortune 500 companies. Since
FNRG does not produce its own products, it can offer best of class solutions and not
be subject to current and potential gross margin deterioration of a commoditized
product like LED lights, that may plague other companies. Moreover, its "No Money
Down" project financing approach has already garnered sizable deals and a hit list of
over $100M worth of potential projects in its pipeline, via active bids. This innovative
model typically fosters greater than industry standard top-line growth and valuation."


(Notice the focus on the $100 million worth of projects with no mention of the fact
that $95 million of it comes from one speculative hoped-for project).


We can see from the past that coverage of ForceField by Goldman Small Cap has been
extensive, with at least 20 different notes and reports.

Promoter number three: In addition to the Dream Team (Tom Meyer) and Goldman
Small Cap, ForceField is also being promoted by Mark Bonnaci's Small Cap Street
promotion machine. Small Cap also uses the name Cap Rock.


Perhaps not by coincidence, Small Cap Street is also currently co-promoting LiveDeal
along with Goldman Small Cap. Their report on ForceField came in February and cites as
a source for info (in small print at the very bottom) Goldman Small Cap Research.


Small Cap Street was recently highlighted for promoting an OTC marijuana stock called
Growlife (OTC:PHOT) which was halted by the SEC as a fraud and which has since
plunged to just 2 cents. In that article, the same author sheds light on a different stock
promotion by Small Cap Street called Provectus (PVCT) which has since plunged by 80%.
The point is that having your stock promoted by Small Cap Street / Small Cap IR is a sure
sign that there is a promotion campaign going on, elevating the stock price to unnatural
levels.


Promoter number four: Ultimate Stock Alerts uses the technique of associating the name
of ForceField with larger much more liquid stocks in various press releases posing as
news articles, such as this one featured on MarketWatch. The article pretends to be a
research note highlighting 3 great stocks: Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), BIND
Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BIND) and ForceField. In fact, it is clear from reading this article
that the purpose of mentioning these other stocks is simply to hijack their high traffic hit
rates and draw attention towards much smaller ForceField. Ultimate was paid $35,000 to
get this note posted on MarketWatch posing as a research article.


The names listed above are the heavyweight promoters, but there are other lightweight
promotions going on nearly every week. This includes paid mentions at "US Markets
Daily" and "Journal Transcript".


Message board promotion: There is also an ongoing campaign to populate message
boards (such as Yahoo) with bullish messages about ForceField. This has proved to be a
very successful method of luring in retail investors.


Here is one example taken from the message board for Neogenomics (NASDAQ:NEO).
The strategy for these posters is to seek out companies whose share price has risen
strongly and which are getting a lot of attention. The posters then seek to draw readers'
attention to ForceField. Some small portion of the readers end up buying into ForceField,
elevating share price and volume. Surprisingly, this strategy can work if there are
thousands of postings to other high performing and high interest stocks.

The way to find these postings is to simply look for stocks which are spiking up on high
volume. The ForceField postings can often be found there. Aside from Neogenomics, we
can see the same thing on the BioTime (NYSEMKT:BTX) message board and on the
Chanticleer Holdings (HOTR) board, among many others. None of these companies have
anything in common with ForceField or its purported energy/lighting business.


Paid email promotions: ForceField is also the subject of several paid email promotions
targeting retail investors. The most recent of these consists of a paid promotion via "Penny
Stock Prophet" which began this week. PSP was paid $15,000 to send out these promo
emails, which (of course) cite Goldman Small Cap Research as their source. More
information and the full promo can be found at pennystockprophet.com

It is no coincidence that this flurry of promotional activity is all happening at the
same time for a company which happens to be out of cash. Because ForceField is
delinquent with filing its 10-K, it is likely not able to issue stock right now. But as
soon as the 10-K comes out (likely within the next few days), we should expect a
large equity offering to drop the stock back down to around $3.00-4.00. The timing
of all of this promotion should be seen as no coincidence.


Again, the dual concerns are that a) the share price has been elevated to artificially
high levels, and b) the stock is about to crash based on a badly needed upcoming
equity offering.


Past connections with past fraudulent activity

In reality, the notion that ForceField is being promoted before an equity raise should come
as no surprise. Aside from their history of using the Dream Team to promote their stock,
ForceField's three top managers all have extensive ties to past fraudulent companies
which have gotten into substantial trouble, including investigations by the SEC, FBI, the
US Senate and the Canadian Federal Government.


ForceField is run by CEO David Natan. Notably, Mr. Natan does not name any of his past
companies on his official bio. We can now see why.


From Bloomberg we can see the detailed history of Mr. Natan and his lengthy history of
working with promotional companies based out of Boca Raton. For those who don't know,
Boca Raton happens to be the center of stock promotion (and sometimes fraud) in
America.


Further digging shows that his past companies are mostly bankrupt former pink sheets
companies based out of South Florida, such as MBf, Global Technovations and IMX
Pharma.


Just prior to running ForceField/SunSi, Mr. Natan was CFO of a company called SFBC
and he was the one responsible for signing off on their financial statements.


SFBC was basically a south Florida recruitment mill for finding subjects (often illegal
immigrants) to act as guinea pigs in clinical trials for drugs that had not yet been approved
by the FDA. A lengthy and scathing exposé on SFBC can be found on Bloomberg, entitled
"Big Pharma's Shameful Secret", and it is well worth reading. Anyone who has an interest
in pharma or clinical trials should absolutely read that article. In the wake of this exposé,
SFBC's share price fell by as much as 75%.


According to the fraud complaint filed in the District Court of New Jersey, SFBC told
investors that it had a new state of the art facility which would drive the majority of
revenues going forward. In fact, the building was nothing more than a dilapidated former
Holiday Inn that


was so structurally unsound that the Miami Dade County Unsafe Structures Board
has since ordered the facility to be demolished.


It was fraud, plain and simple.


The fraud case goes on to state that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3071896-forcefield-energy-undisclosed-promotions-and-management-connections-to-past-frauds 12/26


SFBC risked its reputation and recruitment ability by utilizing a variety of unethical
and dangerous practices that severely compromised the integrity of the drug trials
conducted by the Company. For example, as detailed below, SFBC violated
applicable minimum waiting requirements, used deceptive payment schemes to
decrease the likelihood that a participant would report adverse reactions to the
drugs being tested, failed to put into place adequate controls to prevent participants
from applying to concurrent drug trials at other facilities, and failed to ensure that
participants - the majority of whom are low-income individuals who speak
English, if at all, as a second language - provided the required "informed
consent."


Further, in order to ensure that SFBC's improper and unethical practices
remained hidden from public view, the Company hired regulatory companies that
were completely beholden to SFBC and its employees. For example, throughout
the Class Period, SFBC paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a regulatory
company called Southern Institutional Review Board ("Southern IRB") - a
supposedly independent review board ("IRB") - to oversee and "approve" a
substantial portion of their clinical tests. Southern IRB was owned and operated by
the wife of a senior officer of SFBC. Similarly, SFBC utilized LeeCoast IRB to
supervise its tests, despite the fact that LeeCoast IRB was owned by an SFBC
subsidiary and employees of LeeCoast were paid directly by SFBC with checks
prepared by SFBC's own accounting offices.


Clearly the goal of all of this was to prop up the stock so that money could be
raised. And that plan worked quite well.


Defendants' untrue and misleading statements and omissions allowed SFBC to
project the appearance of growth and success, which inflated the price of
SFBC's securities and enabled the Company's insiders to enrich themselves at
investors' expense. Indeed, during the Class Period, the individual defendants sold
significant portions of their SFBC stock, generating tens of millions of dollars in
personal profits. They were also able to orchestrate two large secondary offerings
of SFBC securities, which allowed the Company to raise a total of approximately
$250 million from unwitting investors.


Insider sales were large. As noted in the Sought Florida Business Journal, "SFBC execs
pull in $15.71M from stock sales". This was just shortly before the fraud came unraveled
and occurred before the stock price collapsed.

CEO Natan isn't the only one with connections to fraudulent companies in his background.
Like Mr. Natan, Chairman Richard St-Julien refrains from actually naming any of his past
ventures or employers. He simply notes in his bio that:


Richard has a great deal of success and experience as a practicing attorney in the
areas of Commercial and International Law. In addition, Richard has been involved
in numerous business ventures as an entrepreneur in Canada, the U.S., China and
other countries.


In reality, it is a bit more colorful than that. Mr. St. Julien appears to be an expert at moving
money around in places such as (again, no coincidence) Costa Rica. Costa Rica is, of
course, where ForceField ended up establishing its operations and where 100% of its
assets were located until 2014.


In 2009, Mr. St. Julien was working as a lawyer in Costa Rica helping to funnel cash to
and from convicted fraudster Jean LaFleur who was running a fraudulent scheme in
Belize.


The Canadian federal government was suing LaFleur for $7 million for his role in a
government sponsorship scandal. According to the Globe and Mail:


Federal lawyers allege in the court documents that Mr. Lafleur "tried to liquidate his
assets when it became obvious that [the government] would undertake legal action
to recoup money that it had paid to [Mr. Lafleur] as part of his fraudulent scheme."…
Mr. Lafleur said as part of his bankruptcy proceedings that he called on Mr. St-Julien
to invest the money on his behalf in Liechtenstein, the Caribbean and Belize… Mr.
St-Julien is a member of the Quebec bar, but he is working in Costa Rica, and has
refused to explain what happened to $460,000 from the house sale that was
invested in his Belize company, Parameter, which is now insolvent.


LaFleur was ultimately sent to prison for his role, but the money disappeared.


As for ForceField's CFO, Jason Williams, he notes on his bio that he was previously at
Protective Products of America (OTCPK:PPAFQ), which happens to be a pink sheets
company that trades for less than 1 penny. Not surprisingly, Protective was based in South
Florida. In the 3 years that it traded as a public company, Protective never filed a single
financial statement, so it is unclear what Mr. Williams' actual duties might have been at
that company. (At ForceField, financial statements have been delinquent in each of the
past 3 years, again raising doubts about his role as CFO).

But it gets better.


Prior to that, Williams notes that at PharmaNet he was an integral part of the management
team that facilitated a market capitalization rise from $150 million to $800 million during a
three-year period. It does sound impressive.


However, this bio fails to mention some key facts. Most importantly, PharmaNet is in
fact the same SFBC that settled fraud charges two years after the Bloomberg
article.


Yes, in fact, the stock did spike to a valuation of over $800 million during the tenure of Mr.
Williams. But that was before it cratered to as low as $50 million (down 85%) in the wake
of the Bloomberg fraud exposé.


I would encourage readers to re-read the fraud case against SFBC and its management to
fully appreciate its implications.


From the introduction of the fraud case:


This is a case about a company that repeatedly misled investors about the most
fundamental aspects of its business and operations. That company is SFBC, and
throughout the Class Period, SFBC and its senior officers told investors that SFBC
was a well-run business with highly-qualified management and significant
competitive advantages in its field. In reality, however, SFBC suffered from a raft of
undisclosed problems that infected its business and threatened the
Company's very survival.


After the US Senate launched an official investigation into the company, they simply began
running their clinical trials in Canada.


You can read about the name change and the move to Canada in this article.


"Troubled SFBC changes its name in hope of changing its fortunes"


The point of this is that all three top managers have substantial ties to companies
with fraudulent activities in the past. They are now all working together in a
fledgling company that is hitting all-time highs even as there are obvious signs of
stock promotion. And of course, the company happens to be out of money.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3071896-forcefield-energy-undisclosed-promotions-and-management-connections-to-past-frauds 15/26


ForceField Energy is a stock promotion pure and simple. The company has been
engaging paid promoters to issue a series of upbeat reports on its prospects which has
successfully powered the stock higher. Some of the reports on ForceField have made use
of undisclosed promotions pretending to be independent authors. Since this time last year,
the stock has nearly doubled off of its lows and volume has increased several fold. This is
a reflection of the success of the promotions.


Management has a troubling history of involvement with fraudulent companies, misleading
investors and the ability to shift money around in international locations such as Costa
Rica, where ForceField continues to maintain the bulk of its operations.


The hype surrounding ForceField continues to focus on "$100 million" worth of projects
being bid on, while ignoring the fact that a single white elephant project accounts for $95
million of the supposed pipeline.


With ForceField running dangerously low on cash, the timing of the recent flurry of hype
and promotions becomes clear. ForceField has still not filed its annual Form 10-K (it is
delinquent). But as soon as the 10-K comes out (any day now), ForceField will end up
issuing a large amount of equity. This will be the catalyst for a very sharp drop in the share
price to $3.00-4.00 or below.

corporate office were not returned.
