—————-


In recent months, we have focused on uncovering and exposing the
pervasive fraud that we believe is taking place at MiMedx.  Extensive
evidence has emerged of channel stu�ng, Medicare and coding
fraud, anti-kickback violations, undisclosed related party
transactions, and the systematic harassment of whistleblowers. New
information reveals that the company has also put patients at risk.


After MiMedx announced it was unable to �le its �nancials and
would commence a second internal investigation, investors have
increasingly begun to recognize the severity of the company’s
problems.  Yet shares still trade at a lofty valuation of 2.5x sales
because many seem to believe the company’s products have
signi�cant intrinsic value.


But this report speci�cally exposes severe undisclosed
manufacturing problems and contamination risks uncovered by FDA
investigators that are so serious that Mr. Petit “expressed concern
regarding their product being pulled from the market”. Even though


“if we have bad news, we’ll get it out to you ahead of
time. Okay”


-Promise made by MiMedx CEO Parker Petit to investors
during a company earnings call

FDA investigators identi�ed issues that “pose a signi�cant risk to
the recipient”, the company is marketing unapproved products
produced by these facilities for experimental indications such as
spinal injections. Unsuspecting patients are being defrauded
through false advertisements used by dubious clinics to entice
them into receiving the injections. We therefore believe the FDA has
no choice but to immediately intervene and protect patients.


The MiMedx stock promotion is premised on the growth potential of
new products that management claims will transition MiMedx into a
valuable “biopharmaceutical company”. The lynchpin of this
narrative is Amnio�x Injectible (“AI”), a product intended to treat pain
that MiMedx touts as having the “potential to become a blockbuster
therapeutic biologic, with long-term peak revenue potentially
exceeding $4 Billion”.


Yet as an unapproved drug, there is no legal basis for Amnio�x
injectable to be marketed for sale (we explore this in greater detail
later in this report).  MiMedx attempted to address this issue on its
website in January by invoking the results of a 2012 FDA inspection
in an effort to portray AI as having regulatory legitimacy.  MiMedx
declared the “actual facts” include:


This is an egregious misrepresentation because MiMedx has
concealed the existence of two subsequent FDA inspections in 2014
and 2016 which uncovered severe de�ciencies that were
documented in Form 483s (failed manufacturing site inspection
reports).  The agency’s �ndings are so serious that the FDA
investigator noted in 2016 that: “Mr. Petit expressed concern
regarding their product being pulled from the market as well as the
effect of such actions on their stock values” (below). We �nd it
particularly telling that Petit was primarily concerned about the
impact of these problems on MiMedx’s stock price rather than the
potential impact on the patients who have been injected with his

company’s products. Yet not only has MiMedx failed to disclose the
existence of these de�cient inspections to investors, but the
company took steps to conceal documents from the public by asking
the FDA not to release them via FOIA requests (the FDA’s report can
be viewed here).


The FDA’s 2016 inspection focused on MiMedx’s micronized
products (which include Amnio�x Injectable) and identi�ed 13
separate de�ciencies that the investigators outlined in the Form 483
issued to MiMedx.  Industry experts we spoke with described both
the quantity and severity of the FDA’s observations as being
extremely unusual and troubling.  In addition to uncovering
signi�cant problems with the claimed sterility and purity of MiMedx’s
manufacturing process, the FDA speci�cally identi�ed issues that
“pose a signi�cant risk to the recipient”:


Additional troubling observations documented by FDA investigators
during the 2016 inspection include:


“Written representation that processing methods reduce the
risk of transmission of communicable disease by HCTp/S was
not based on a fully validated or veri�ed process”


“fails to address bacteriostasis and fungistatis testing”


“each batch of drug product required to be free of
objectionable microorganisms not tested through appropriate
laboratory testing”


“The �rm’s endotoxin validation is inadequate”

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/mimedx-undisclosed-failed-inspections-illegal-injections-fda/ 5/8


“signi�cant de�ciencies within the Micronization process. The
most egregious violations were that the �rm failed to fully
validate their micronization manufacturing process”


“the current process lacks validation of particle size,
distribution, product identity, safety, and potency”


“drug products do not bear an expiration date determined by
appropriate stability data”


During the FDA’s earlier inspection of MiMedx in 2014, the
investigator observed that “procedures for cleaning and sanitizing
the equipment were not followed”. The investigator also identi�ed
that “tissue cartons contained discrepant product labeling” and cited
two examples where the label on the cartons was different than the
label on the product’s barcode.  This is problematic because it
suggests that the FDA has also uncovered tissue tagging
irregularities at MiMedx.


Furthermore, we discovered that MiMedx uses a Texas manufacturer
named INCELL to produce Ortho�o, an unapproved amniotic �uid
product that both MiMedx and its captive distributor/agent, SLR
Medical, market for orthopedic injections.  MiMedx has failed to
disclose that INCELL received an October 2016 FDA warning letter
(following two de�cient inspections) stating that:


“ the investigator observed serious de�ciencies in your
practices for producing sterile drug products, which put
patients at risk” (emphasis ours).  In addition “The FDA
investigator noted that drug products that were intended
or expected to be sterile were prepared, packed, or held
under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been
contaminated with �lth or rendered injurious to health”.

Despite these serious manufacturing issues, MiMedx is now actively
marketing its unapproved products for experimental and exotic
indications.  For example, we received an internal MiMedx email
which demonstrates that MiMedx’s sales team is marketing AI for
Epidural Steroid Injections (below).

Injections of unapproved substances into the spinal column can be
extremely dangerous because the drug directly enters the central
nervous system. This is problematic because the nervous system is
particularly susceptible to infection from unsterile products and also
could experience side effects from substances that have not been
subjected to robust clinical study. The extreme risks can be seen in
the New England Compounding Center Meningitis Outbreak, in which
76 patients died after receiving contaminated epidural steroid
injections illegally produced by a compounding pharmacy.


We also have learned that many doctors and clinics are selling AI
through false advertisements which claim that these are “stem cell
injections” (they are absolutely not).  We believe that unsuspecting
patients are being defrauded because the advertisements are used
to entice them into receiving an injection of an unapproved drug
under false pretenses. Several examples of these advertisements
include:


So why has the FDA continued to allow MiMedx to actively market
and sell Amnio�x Injectable?

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/mimedx-undisclosed-failed-inspections-illegal-injections-fda/ 8/8


In our opinion, the most likely explanation is that the FDA is simply
not aware that MiMedx is marketing its products in this way. For
example, we �nd it implausible that the FDA would have signed off
on injections of an unapproved biologic like AI as an epidural steroid.
Especially since the FDA’s 483 report to MiMedx stated that the
agency “discussed the fact that his [Mr. Petit’s] product is a
biological drug and as such must have an approved biological
license [BLA] in effect in order to be legally marketed and
distributed”.  Since MiMedx does not have an approved BLA, we
believe  that these products are clearly being marketed and sold with
no legal basis.


Mr. Petit is a CEO who believes himself to be above the law. It is
possible that his political benefactors have kept the FDA at bay, at
least up until now. But we believe this evidence leaves the FDA with
no choice but to immediately intervene in order to protect patients.
