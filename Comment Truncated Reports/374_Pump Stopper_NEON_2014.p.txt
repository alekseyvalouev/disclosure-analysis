Neonode: Strong Sell On Shell Games, Fraud Litigation And Hyping
Obsolete Technology
Jun. 18, 2014 2:36 PM ET105 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Neonode AB has gone bankrupt twice, and is now in its THIRD attempt to hype an
obsolete IR-touch technology, and I believe facing inevitable bankruptcy again.


Swedish court documents show NEON Exec. Chairman Bystedt faces an ongoing
lawsuit alleging fraud and shell games, where investors were wiped out after
bankruptcy.


NEON management has issued over 160 promotional press releases, yet lacks
material revenue after 3 years. Meanwhile, NEON insiders have made millions from
stock sales and compensation.


US customs import documents show NEON's much-touted HP printer deal has
produced only $154k in estimated total revenue to NEON as of 6/9/2014.


NEON's technology is commoditized, appears worthless and is rapidly becoming
even less relevant as infrared touchscreens lose market share, while capacitive
becomes relentlessly cheaper.


Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) is a reverse merger that traded for $0.50 per share on the
OTC market just a few years ago, that has gone bankrupt twice already. With promises of
future revenue, 160 promotional press releases and questionable ties to an alleged paid
stock promotion scandal, NEON now trades at an eye-popping "bubble valuation" of
$153m, despite just $4.3m of trailing 12-month revenue, which is a -31% decline from
2011 revenue.


Most importantly, Swedish court documents show NEON executive Chairman faces fraud
allegations from profiting off of the sale of a shell company that went bankrupt and wiped
the investors out. This, along with the multiple bankruptcies of Neonode in the past paints
an interesting pattern to me.


NEON has consistent cash burn, and has only survived thus far due to consistently
issuing dilutive equity to fund cash needs. Primary industry research shows current
contracts are not generating material revenue, while NEON's fundamentals are rapidly

deteriorating due to obsolete and commoditized "technology". I expect as NEON's story
continues to come unwound, NEON will need to continue issuing an increasingly large
number of shares, diluting shareholders in an accelerating manner, to fund its cash burn.


I believe NEON stock is literally worthless, and my price target is $0.00, as I believe
investors will soon refuse to fund Erikson and Bystedt's compensation and obviously
unviable project, driving NEON into bankruptcy (again).

The Neonode "Shell Game": Recycling the Same Story to Investors After Two
Bankruptcies (so far)


Neonode has gone bankrupt twice (so far) using a similar playbook: hype an unviable
business idea within a publicly traded shell, issuing optimistic forecasts, raising investor
capital and then going bankrupt. It seems this playbook also includes multiple shell
companies, subsidiaries, and often results in lawsuits and investor wipe-outs.


The first two "iterations" of Neonode, both Swedish companies, as today, named
"Neonode AB", resulted in bankruptcy and investor wipe-outs. "NEON 1.0" was formed in
2000, with current CEO, Thomas Erikson and current NEON chairman, Per Bystedt
apparently both involved. Despite extremely bullish revenue "projections" of $200m,
NEON 1.0 generated just ~$2m. Shortly after a supplier sued, alleging shell games to
deliberately avoid paying its bills, "NEON 1.0" is reported to go bankrupt in 2005.

NEON 2.0 rebooted in 2007 with a reverse merger onto Nasdaq, but its product flopped
again, resulting in another swift bankruptcy restructuring and investor wipe-out in 2008.
Swedish patents and trademarks are apparently valued at a mere ~$30k per bankruptcy
documents (translated version here).


Did NEON insiders pay back their compensation after these brutal investor wipe-outs?
With two bankruptcies already, what makes you think "this time will be different"?

please read the supporting document HERE.

Perhaps the increased involvement of Per Bystedt as a leader at NEON in 2008 means
fresh blood from a competent and ethical individual? Perhaps the "new NEON" is led by
trustworthy people?


Per Bystedt: Undisclosed Swedish Lawsuit Describes Fraud Allegations and Shell
Companies


Per Swedish court documents I found through Private Investigators and translated by
professionals, I have uncovered an ongoing lawsuit (case T-2795-13) alleging NEON's
executive chairman (joined the team in 2008) is also involved in questionable shell
companies, where he profited personally but investors were wiped out. Plaintiffs allege
fraud and deception.


Summary of Lawsuit (Full Swedish and Translated English versions)


Through a complex chain of questionable shell companies, Per Bystedt appears to me to
have sold shell company Pjaxen to another empty shell company he controls, IABO, and
ultimately to investors with a hotel in Sweden called Högfjällshotellet AB.

Per Bystedt apparently profited to the tune of 3 million SKR on the deal by, undisclosed to
the buyer, issuing himself shares and immediately selling them at a premium to the buyer!
Unfortunately for the investors, though, this purchased company allegedly had
undisclosed liabilities, and the seller was technically IABO, an empty shell controlled by
Bystedt with no assets to pay for the debts it owed.


(Chart from Swedish lawsuit documents, with my commentary)


This lawsuit is ongoing, and I believe, is very telling about the people in charge of NEON.
It is also interesting to me that it appears Bystedt, et al are not refuting the fact of
undisclosed liabilities, but are instead apparently arguing that the Hotel did not complain
quickly enough. Read the translated Plaintiff (Hotel) and Respondents' grounds for
yourself. With potential judgement given Thursday, the uncertainty here is a very
dangerous catalyst investors should consider, in my view.


Furthermore, Executive Chairman Per Bystedt also seems to have a history of failing to
notify regulators properly about his ownership and insider status changes. He was fined
15,000 Skr in 2006 for failing to notify Swedish regulators in a timely manner. (English
translation)


For much more detailed notes on the background and timeline of this lawsuit, I strongly
encourage you to read my translated notes here.


Note, I am not a Swedish lawyer, and I strongly encourage investors to look up the court
documents themselves and form their own view. I paid two translators to interpret these
documents, and made my best good faith effort to summarize these complex issues for

you. In addition, I shared the documents I view as most vital here for the public good to try
and help you with your research. If NEON had disclosed this in a transparent manner, we
wouldn't have this issue.


Why were these issues not disclosed to US investors? What does this tell you about
NEON and the people running it today?


NEON Technology is Obsolete and Has Already Lost the Market to Capacitive Touch


Even if you believe NEON is not a shell company heading for bankruptcy (again) while
insiders get rich, the technology is so hopelessly obsolete, in my view, I question how
NEON management can honestly believe what they are doing is financially viable. Let me
explain.


There is no disputing the global touchscreen market has been growing rapidly for many
years now.

1. Despite rapid touchscreen industry growth, NEON's trailing 12-month revenue is just
$4.18m, which is actually a -31% decrease from 2011 revenue of $6.06m, as cash burn
has simultaneously accelerated. If NEON has some amazing technology, how could this
be? The financial reality NEON seems to find itself in and the wildly optimistic press
releases NEON continues to put forth don't seem to mesh...


(Chart built by me using NEON SEC filings)


2. The reason is Optical Infrared seems to be the modern touchscreen equivalent of an "8-
track" player. Don't believe me? Go find someone who is in charge of deciding what kind
of touchscreen gets integrated into a phone or electronic device. If you choose to NOT do
this, then admit to yourself you are blindly following what biased management or conflicted
Wall Street analysts are telling you.

3. We can see from the "Other Technologies" category at the top of the chart below that
Optical Infrared does not seem to have had meaningful market share in global
touchscreens even going back to 2007. Even worse, that tiny market share has been
shrinking rapidly, with expectations of that trend continuing.


(Chart source, page 5)


In 2007, resistive touch had 93% market share, capacitive was 4% and the various other
types (including optical infrared) were a tiny 2.8% market share. Worst of all (for NEON),
this "Other" market share has shrunk to just 0.3% of the market now, and is forecasted to
continue to shrink, according to the presentation from touchscreen industry consulting
group Walker Mobile above. Other sources further support that infrared has the smallest
market (page 13 on the right) share of any touchscreen technology.


4. Why have NEON and the other optical infrared technologies lost their relevance? There
are many reasons why infrared optical touch has fallen, but primarily, there are very
specific performance issues with this technology that haven't been fixed yet. Meanwhile,

capacitive touch continues the relentless march of improved performance and decreased
cost. While you can argue with me or quote whatever management has told you, the years
of shrinking market share, declining sales and NEON's continued cash burn with inability
to generate material revenue seem hard to ignore.

5. Optical infrared touchscreen technology is OLD, and was originally developed as
far back as 1965 and offered to consumers in 1983 with the HP-150 PC. The fundamental
technology here is not cutting-edge, and many superior touchscreen technologies have
been invented since. Even if a company has the best, A+, top-tier, "8-track" technology,
that technology has little value in the modern world that is generations ahead.

(Image source, page 269)


1. Even in the niche IR-touch space, NEON is a weak competitor: Even if you are
stuck on the idea that optical infrared is the superior tech, which will suddenly reverse
its years of market share losses, there are many other competitors offering optical
infrared touchscreen that seem to be years ahead of NEON.


1. Winstron and Quanta were reported to be launching infrared optical touch
notebooks with Windows as far back as 2009. If NEON had critical IP or patents in
this space, why hasn't it sued Winstron or Quanta or Elotouch?


1. General Touch's proprietary Projected Infrared Touch meets Win8 Logo, and is
extremely flat with small bezel. PQ Labs has 40 patents in infrared touchscreen
technology, and boasts "the thinnest infrared screen". TimeLink appears to offer
up to 48 points of touch on a 100" LCD panel using infrared touch as well.
PulseIR has multi-touch infrared touchscreens as well in up to 103" sizes.


2. Per this 2012 document, NEON was not listed as a supplier capable of
providing 48-touch infrared touchscreen technology.


1. Per discussion with NEON investor relations, NEON appears to only be
capable of 10 fingers touch. How can NEON be expected to compete, when
competitors appear to me to offer more advanced infrared touchscreen
technology?


3. There appear to be countless other Chinese suppliers of cheap infrared
touchscreens as well.

4. Perhaps most telling, what appears to be the global leader in infrared/optical
touchscreen technology, "NextWindow", has recently shut down after
restructuring due to the uneconomic reality of the business, as optical infrared
has faced declining sales for some time now.


1. NextWindow had over $60m in 2010 sales, with 120 employees, not to
mention partnerships with HP, Sony, Dell, Asus, Lenovoa, Medion, NEC,
etc. while based in South Korea, presumably giving it superior access to
companies such as LG, Samsung, etc.


5. NextWindow was acquired in 2010 by SmartTech, and is now shut down.
6. If the global leader with revenue 10x higher than NEON with 3x the employees


and vastly superior partnerships decided pursuing optical infrared wasn't worth
doing, why is NEON still spending shareholder cash on this unviable market?


7. BOTTOM LINE: Infrared touchscreen technology is a shrinking, uneconomic,
obsolete and commoditized industry, where NEON is not even the leader. It is
not surprising to me that NEON is failing, and I question why and how NEON
management apparently is ignorant of the uneconomic position they find
themselves in.


2. Lastly, NEON seems to make it more difficult to do business with it by selling its
offering in a format that customers apparently do not prefer. Remember, NEON doesn't
sell the touchscreen component, it just licenses the technology so the customer can then
have the component built themselves. NEON sells design specs to its version of an
infrared touchscreen, and it typically bundles that with some engineering support. The
problem is that most electronics manufacturers aren't in the business of adding complexity
to their already complex manufacturing processes and partnerships. Based on NEON's
tiny and declining revenue, customers would apparently prefer to simply have one source
for their touchscreen and display and leave it at that, rather than expend additional time
and money on integrating and manufacturing some alternate touchscreen option.


3. NEON's position is unviable now, and rapidly getting worse.


1. While infrared touchscreen technology is currently inferior and losing market share, it
is actually expected to get worse.


2. Capacitive touchscreen costs declined by -20% in 2013, and is expected to decline by
another -20% in 2014, likely putting the costs at $0.40-0.70 per diagonal inch or
cheaper. It is tough for a small company to compete with global giants, where the price

of the competition relentlessly drops by -20% year after year as their performance
improves.


3. Capacitive touchscreen performance is improving rapidly as well. Capacitive has been
useful in gloved applications for years too; this is not an advantage specific to NEON.


4. The last time NEON and these executives went up against global giants in cell phones,
they quickly went bankrupt.


5. NEON is attempting to tout a technology that the market has said is inferior, faces
declining volumes and decreasing market share, at the same time, pricing (revenue) is
declining -20% year-over-year, while its competition, Samsung and Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL), are spending fortunes on R&D.


(Chart built by me with SEC filings)


Considering NEON is already burning a tremendous amount of cash with immaterial
revenue, how long can NEON survive before going bankrupt again?


4. NEON's much-touted Hewlett-Packard printer deal appears to have produced only
$154k of estimated revenue for NEON. This can be calculated using public US customs
documents. HP has already made the decision to use capacitive touchscreens in its
higher-end printers and not NEON, so increased market penetration at HP is apparently
not happening. Why did NEON not press release this important piece of news to its
shareholders?


1. It is possible to track the shipment of products imported into the US with surprising
accuracy using publicly available US customs documents. There are many services
that offer this, and some of them are even free.


2. For reference, here is an example of an HP US Customs Bill of Lading document for a
shipment of HP Officejet 8620 printers that occurred 2/17/2014. I have data as recent
as 6/9/2014 for shipment volume of these HP Officejet printers.

2. We can go through every one of these since last year, searching by product number,
and tally up the total volume of HP Officejet 8610, 8620 and 8630 printers shipped into the
US. For example, this exercise shows us there have been 136 containers of 8620 HP
Officejet printers shipped to the US since the launch.


1. This gives us a "real-time" estimated revenue model for the royalty that NEON will be
paid. I have been surprised at how little revenue from this much-touted deal actually
goes to NEON. Since this printer was launched, even though HP has shipped 255k of
these, the total royalty to NEON for the first 6 months of 2014 seems to be only $154k.
Note that NEON is burning ~$1m per month, so this $154k of estimated revenue over
6 months is barely even a drop in the bucket towards stemming NEON's consistent
cash burn.

(Chart built with my own estimates and US Customs data)


Note, I am using what I consider generous assumptions for NEON on the royalty rate for
the 8620/8630 printers. I believe true NEON royalty amount could likely be far lower.


1. Also note that these initial printer shipments likely contain excess volume necessary to
fill the supply chain, retailer inventory, etc. It is possible the run rate printer volumes
could be lower than what is stated here.


5. NEON has a history of customer loss and partnership resulting in lawsuit.


1. NEON lost Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as its customer in 2012, which is well known.
2. However, NEON also appears to have lost Volvo now as:


1. ""Volvo has been the best because Volvo's new infotainment system comes with a
capacitive display."


2. Where is the NEON press release about this?
3. NEON used to tout a relationship with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but that appears to


have resulted in a contentious lawsuit. Where is the NEON press release about this
also?


6. I Believe NEON Analyst Estimates are far too high, and will need to be revised
downward.


1. Given the deteriorating fundamentals for NEON, market dominance of capacitive and
the immaterial revenue from the HP deal, along with HP's announcement to use
capacitive touch in other applications, the consensus estimates for NEON appear far
too high and will need to be revised downward again.


2. Disgraced and allegedly illegal paid stock pumper "Tech Guru" was forecasting $58m
in 2014 revenue. Slightly less credible analysts (in my opinion) from Ascendiant and
Craig Hallum have apparently pushed out revenue estimates (again), with 2015 now

3. According to data obtained on CapIQ, NEON paid Craig Hallum almost a million
dollars in fees when Craig Hallum acted as lead underwriter for NEON's follow-on
equity offering in September, 2013. Ascendient also earned large fees for their
participation in the May 2014 offering -- $600,000 in fees for underwriting the shares,
and another $600,000 in connection with warrant exercises, as well as 117,879
warrants for Ascendient. Are these fees influencing the sell side's bullish estimates that
seem to me to be essentially impossible? Should investors be relying on these
estimates, despite this obvious conflict of interest?


4. How long will NEON shareholders tolerate this endless moving of the goal posts
before they begin to feel manipulated and misled?


5. We can see that again (not surprisingly) NEON will fail to produce the sales hockey
stick estimates that NEON analysts have been predicting literally for years. I believe it
is obvious 2014 will (again) underwhelm, as will 2015.


6. We can go end-market by end-market to show this:


1. The much-hyped HP Printer "Opportunity" has already been debunked thoroughly
above, so it's clearly off the table and I won't repeat myself.


2. Auto: NEON's only tiny deal with Volvo never materialized into anything substantial,
and then Volvo switched to capacitive touch for its newest generation of in-car
offerings.


1. Virtually every car company in the world has already developed an in-car
touchscreen offering, and they are all capacitive, or in some rare cases,
resistive technology. I was unable to find even one large car manufacturer with
any optical infrared touchscreen in their entertainment system.


2. Toyota, Cadillac & GM, Ford, VW, Honda and BMW all use capacitive
touchscreens, with Ferrari choosing resistive, and with Volvo finally catching up
and using capacitive technology now too.


3. Handsets: NEON IR has told me that it has essentially stopped pursuing this
market diligently, as capacitive is already dominant; Apple and Samsung are ~70%
of the market, and both of those vendors have invested in capacitive touchscreen
technology, so there seems to me to be essentially zero chance any optical infrared
touchscreen (let alone NEON) gets in any major handset. As evidence, no major
vendor has done this yet, and capacitive touch is only increasing in performance,
while decreasing in cost.


1. Furthermore, NVDA has sued NEON recently, and so that relationship is clearly
not going well.

5/22/2018 Neonode: Strong Sell On Shell Games, Fraud Litigation And Hyping Obsolete Technology - Neonode, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEON) | Seeking A…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2275253-neonode-strong-sell-on-shell-games-fraud-litigation-and-hyping-obsolete-technology 17/45


1. E-readers: NEON has already demonstrated an inability to generate meaningful
revenue in this segment when they partnered with AMZN, who is one of the world's
largest e-reader producers. Since NEON lost AMZN as a customer, though, the e-
reader market is now shrinking rapidly, -28% or more depending on the source.


1. Computers: Same situations as handsets, where performance is far too important
to compromise using a cheaper, inferior touchscreen technology.


1. NEON seems years behind the curve in computer and notebooks anyway, not
even receiving Windows 8 certification until early 2014, while competitors are
already selling optical touchscreen PCs. I am guessing the delay is likely
because it is extremely difficult to meet the required specs with infrared
touchscreen technology.


1. Unfortunately for NEON, the competition had Windows 8-compliant
touchscreens already on the market for 2 years, while it appears other
optical infrared touchscreen vendors are already on the market. If they are
theoretically infringing on NEON's IP, then where are the lawsuits?


2. There were computer and tablets proposed back in 2009 with optical
infrared touchscreens, and those never really caught on. I don't see why
any computer company would want to repeat a decision that was already
shown to be a failure.


3. AAPL is already firmly entrenched in capacitive touch, while MSFT recently
acquired its own touchscreen company.


1. Small Appliance Buttons: The only other application that seems even remotely
possible is the touted appliance or small button market. We have seen how much
revenue NEON generates from the HP opportunity, and refrigerators are a much
lower-volume market than printers. Furthermore, there are dozens of apparently
superior competitors any appliance manufacturer could choose over NEON. If NEON
is generating an immaterial amount of revenue from the HP printer deal with 3-4"
screens, how can selling much smaller screens in lower volumes save NEON?
Furthermore, pricing in the touchscreen market is declining -20% every year, so any
future deals will likely have to be signed with lower pricing?


The sad truth is that NEON only receives a very tiny piece of its apparently very weak
value proposition to potential customers. Even years back, before touchscreen pricing
declined dramatically, despite selling into the enormous Kindle e-reader market with 100%
market share for that product at the time, NEON generated only $3m of revenue from that

customer, despite Kindle e-reader sales of $3-4b. With NEON focusing on smaller screens
with lower industry touchscreen pricing, what does this say about NEON's future revenue
potential?


7. NEON patent value is dubious, and I believe clearly worth $0.00


1. NEON bulls claim NEON has a slide-to-lock patent worth "BILLIONS!" but I believe it is
obvious to anyone at a cursory glance that the patent is actually without any value.


2. In addition to other expert analysis, my own analysis indicates NEON's patents are
worthless. More importantly, if you look at NEON's actions, it seems clear to me they
are worthless also.


1. NEON's head of IP quoted it was actively seeking licensing deals and would be
contacting AAPL back in 2/2012.


2. Yet, NEON has not monetized a single patent yet, as far as I can tell.
3. Instead, NEON has sold more stock to get cash. If the patents could be monetized,


it would have done so by now to raise cash and dilute everyone.


3. If the patents were worth anything, they would presumably have been sold by the court
back when NEON went bankrupt. Instead, the outcome shows there is apparently
nothing of material value there.


4. Furthermore, if there was some enormously valuable treasure trove of IP and patents,
Neonode would have monetized them years back, instead of going bankrupt.


5. If NEON's touchscreen IP and patents were so comprehensive and valuable, how are
there dozens of competitors offering what appear to be equivalent or superior
technology, and yet, NEON has not sued any of them, despite announcing intentions
to do so a long time ago?


If NEON's "technology" is clearly obsolete with decreasing relevance, how does
management not know this? What are they honestly doing with this reverse-merger shell
company?

NEON CEO, Thomas Erikson collected $1.38m in compensation in 2012 alone, per
CapIQ.


2. NEON previously tied to disgraced Seeking Alpha stock pumper "Tech Guru",
who had all his public NEON articles removed by Seeking Alpha after the "Dream Team
Group" illegal paid stock pumping scandal.


1. "Tech Guru" appears to have written 8 NEON articles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) in a short
period of time.


2. NEON also featured on Dream Team Group's website several times.
3. What legitimate company would be involved with an alleged paid stock tout scandal?


What was NEON's connection to "Tech Guru"?
4. Could investors who bought NEON stock or who participated in a NEON capital raise


over this time frame (3/2013-10/2013) sue NEON, based on concerns about a
potentially illegally inflated stock price? Could these investors demand to get their
money back?


3. I find the following "estimates" from NEON in its 2011 investor presentation very
"questionable". Did NEON management honestly believe they were going to take an old
technology that has been losing market share for years, which apparently saw no serious
interest from global technology giants during bankruptcy, with estimated 9-18 month sales
cycles, and then grow revenue 2,100% in 2 years?

(From 2011 NEON Investor Presentation)


1. NEON seems very "good" to me at issuing press releases about "design wins" and
selling stock to investors, but seems to me it is bad at actually generating revenue.
See this slide stating dozens of "design wins" back in 2011; despite these promotional
proclamations, NEON failed to generate meaningful revenue and actually lost its
largest customer .

(From 2011 NEON Investor Presentation)


4. NEON Seems To Me To Be Collapsing Internally. Technology and R&D-based
companies are just teams of individuals in the lab. NEON seems to me to have constant
turmoil and turnover in key R&D, engineering and sales positions, indicating to me NEON
is falling apart from the inside out.


1. CEO Erikson is apparently so difficult to work with that the CFO allegedly complained
about discriminating against the elderly. The CFO is ~62 years old also, by the way.


2. How do you feel about these alleged comments from NEON CEO Eriksson towards
head of North American sales, Young, that Young is "old and tired and should just go
home for a drink"? Does this make you think NEON CEO Eriksson is an inspirational
leader set to dominate the world of technology?

(Quoted from 2013 Lawsuits against NEON)


1. NEON senior VP of Global Sales, Xerxes Malekani left Neonode 2 months ago, while
the head of North American sales was fired in 2013.


1. I checked LinkedIn data, and I was surprised by the number of key players that
have left the company in recent years. Of course, some level of turnover is
expected at any public company, but how can Neonode realistically expect to have
dramatic sales growth when key designers, engineers and sales people are
leaving? If the technology was legitimate and the stock about to go up a million %,
why are these people leaving?


(Chart built by me using public LinkedIn information)


1. Some of these employees had long tenures at Neonode - the employment date listed
here only reflects their most recent job. When key employees leave, it takes time to
replace them and often results in delays.


1. Xerxes Malekani, former senior vice president of Global Sales, for example, had
high-quality prior experience at VeriSign AB and Vodafone AB, so it's likely he is
highly capable. I have not spoken to Xerxes, but presumably, he would have
stayed at Neonode if sales really were going to dramatically ramp.


2. Quoting directly from Xerxes' LinkedIn profile:

Part of the Executive team. Responsible for entire enterprise global sales operation,
with HQ in Stockholm, and offices in US Japan & Korea. Targeted
customers/partners are OEM's, ODM's, EMS's.


Considering that Neonode didn't have any material OEM, ODM or EMS revenue during
this period, my guess is that Xerxes left for greener pastures.


5. NEON management has a very questionable "pattern" of consistently failing to
meet their own estimates given to investors.

(Chart sourced from NEON Press releases and my opinion on the implications)


a. Based on my chart above using some of NEON's press releases, I find NEON
management's consistent failure to apparently even meet their own guidance to be highly
questionable.


NEON Management Response: I was able to finally get in touch with NEON investor
relations. With multiple phone calls, though, I was unable to get an extensive call, and
unfortunately, I found his commentary to be promotional and without detailed insight on
the questions I asked. Instead of detailed explanation of industry dynamics along with
strengths and weaknesses or lawsuit disclosure, I instead received extensive discussion
about NEON's current definition of "design wins" that I found disappointing. When asked
about future business prospects for NEON, I only got vague platitudes. Instead of details
on revenue or why past design wins do not seem to me to become revenue, I got broad
statements about how large the market opportunity is. Given NEON's inability to generate
meaningful revenue or cash flow, I believe shareholders deserve more than that.
