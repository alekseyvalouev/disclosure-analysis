Deceptive	Conduct	Haunts	Fresh	Healthy	Vending
Feb.	26,	2014	10:07	AM	ET22	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


Fresh	Healthy	Vending	(OTCQB:VEND),	a	niche	vending	company	aimed	at	providing
healthier	snack	options,	commands	a	lofty	$200	million	market	cap	that	is,	in	our	opinion,
primarily	driven	by	a	multi-million	dollar	stock	promotion	campaign.	After	its	recent
meteoric	rise	from	$1	to	$10	over	a	period	of	less	than	six	months,	we	believe	VEND.OB
is	one	of	the	most	overvalued	stocks	on	Wall	Street.	Based	on	the	company's
fundamentals,	an	eventual	60-85	percent	collapse	in	share	price	is	likely.


We	urge	investors	to	beware	of	the	promotional	propaganda	that	is	fueling	this	massive
run.	We	also	advise	the	general	public	that	this	penny	stock	is	at	risk	for	an	SEC
suspension	because	its	relative	volume	spike	and	price	movement	is	eerily	similar	to	that
of	recently	suspended	stocks	Centor	Energy,	Inc.	(OTCPK:CNTO),	Imogo	Mobile
Technologies	Corp.	(OTC:IMTC)	and	Makism	3D	Corp.,	Inc.	(OTC:MDDD).


This	report	will	focus	on	the	following:


Fundamentals	that	no	rational	investor	would	assign	to	a	$200	million	"going	concern"
penny	stock;


A	significant	number	of	skeletons	in	the	closet	for	past	and	present	affiliates	of	the
company,	including	"deceptive	conduct";


Increasing	competition,	low	barriers	to	entry	and	the	lack	of	any	significant
differentiation	between	Fresh	Healthy	Vending	and	competitors;


The	current	stock-promotion	balloon,	which	has	sent	shares	of	VEND.OB	soaring,
definitely	will	pop	because	there	has	been	little	to	no	change	in	the	intrinsic	value	of
shares.


To	date,	we	have	expressed	a	number	of	these	concerns	with	the	company	via	email,	but
have	not	received	a	response.


Not	A	Financially	Sound	Company

In	later	sections,	we	will	focus	on	the	main	elephants	in	the	room	-	including	VEND.OB's
most	recent	penny	stock	promotional	campaign	and	misleading	and	deceptive	conduct	by
the	company's	founder,	Mr.	Nicholas	Yates.	For	now,	we	will	highlight	some	of	the	more
important	numbers	taken	from	the	latest	quarterly	report	for	the	period	ending	Dec.	31
2013:


Revenues	for	the	three	months	ending	Dec.	31,	2013,	were	64	percent	lower	than
those	of	the	same	period	in	2012;


The	company	incurred	a	$503,887	net	loss,	compared	to	a	net	profit	of	$441,934	for
the	same	three	months	of	2012;


Gross	margins	decreased	from	52.6	percent	to	41.8	percent,	representing	a	20
percent	decrease;


Cash	on	the	balance	sheet	did	increase,	but	is	less	than	$500,000.


There	is	no	denying	that	Fresh	Healthy	Vending	does	have	sales	and	an	operational
business.	However,	it	is	absurd	to	place	a	valuation	in	excess	of	$200	million	on	a
business	with	increasing	competition,	few	barriers	to	entry	and	a	very	limited	marketing
budget.


The	fundamentals	alone	give	us	reason	to	believe	that	VEND.OB	presents	one	of	the	best
opportunities	in	the	market	for	short	sellers,	but	the	background	of	the	players	involved
and	the	most	recent	promotional	campaign	lead	us	to	believe	it	is	almost	certain
VEND.OB	will	trade	below	$2	sometime	during	the	next	12-24	months.

Fresh	Healthy	Vending	generates	most	of	its	revenue	from	vending	machine	sales.
According	to	a	representative	of	the	company,	low-end	agreements	are	typically	in	the
range	of	$100,000-$120,000.	Although	payment	terms	vary	on	a	case-by-case	basis,
approximately	40	percent	cash	consideration	is	due	at	the	time	of	signing.


Any	seasoned	entrepreneur	giving	consideration	to	an	up-front	payment	of	$40,000	or
more	would	reasonably	be	expected	to	perform	proper	due	diligence	on	the	company	and
its	employees.	In	doing	so,	that	entrepreneur	quickly	would	discover	numerous	red	flags.
A	simple	Google	search	for:	fresh	healthy	vending	llc,	legal	yields	some	disturbing	results.


Red	Flags


California	Commissioner	of	Corporations	Settlement


Item	3	-	Legal	Proceedings	from	the	company's	most	recent	annual	report	outlines	a
March	2013	settlement	agreement	with	the	State	of	California	regarding	"allegations	of
inaccurate	and	incomplete	disclosures"	in	the	company's	Franchise	Disclosure
Documents	during	2010	and	2011.	As	part	of	the	settlement	agreement,	a	number	of
California	franchisees	were	entitled	to	a	refund	of	their	initial	franchise	fees	and	the
depreciated	market	value	of	the	vending	machines.


Franchise	Investment	Protection	Act	of	Washington


Fresh	Healthy	Vending,	LLC	entered	into	Consent	No.:	S-11-0712-12-CO01	to	determine
whether	there	were	any	violations	of	the	Franchise	Investment	Protection	Act	of
Washington.	Fresh	Healthy	Vending	neither	admitted	nor	denied	the	findings	in	the
Consent	Order.

That	is	a	major	red	flag,	so	we	conducted	background	checks	of	all	individuals	either
associated	or	previously	associated	with	Fresh	Healthy	Vending.	We	believe	the
inaccurate	or	incomplete	disclosure	relates	to	company	founder,	Nicholas	Yates,	former
principal	and	manager,	Mark	Trotter,	or	possibly	both,	perhaps	in	an	effort	to	hide	their
past	wrongdoings.	Based	on	an	article	published	on	unhappyfranchisee.com,	our
concerns	appear	valid:


The	State	of	Texas	Civil	Action	No.	A-05-CA-017-SS	named	Trotter	and	alleged	the
dissemination	of	mass,	unsolicited	commercial	emails	(SPAM)	using	Microsoft,	Inc.
(NASDAQ:MSFT)	accounts.


In	an	unrelated	case,	the	Federal	Court	of	Australia	found	that	Yates	"engaged	in
misleading	and	deceptive	conduct	in	the	operation	of	a	vending	machine	business."

ACCC	Chairman,	Graeme	Samuel	states:


"Small	business	investments	and	franchises	have	the	potential	to	attract
unscrupulous	operators	[and]	this	makes	it	one	of	the	areas	that	the	ACCC	targets.
Operators	who	make	false	claims	about	the	profitability	of	small	business
opportunities	risk	civil	or	criminal	action	by	the	ACCC."


Even	more	disturbing	reports	about	the	checkered	pasts	of	Trotter	and	Yates,	reports	that
go	into	more	detail	about	"vending	industry	scams,"	have	been	published	by	consumers
on	RipoffReport.com.


Trust:	The	Most	Valuable	Business	Commodity


The	external	business	environment	for	Fresh	Healthy	Vending	is	enormous	and	will
continue	to	grow.	New	legislation,	such	as	Section	4205	of	the	Patient	Protection	and
Affordable	Care	Act,	continues	to	be	put	in	place	and	will	dramatically	alter	the
marketplace	for	vending-machine	businesses	by	requiring	"clear	and	conspicuous
statements"	disclosing	the	number	of	calories	on	specific	items	sold.


An	article	published	on	VendingMarketWatch.com	further	validates	the	business	model
Fresh	Healthy	Vending	is	seeking	to	execute.	While	the	market	likely	will	grow,	there	are
few	barriers	to	entry.	So	few,	in	fact,	that	if	the	"fresh	healthy"	concept	gains	widespread
consumer	acceptance,	billion-dollar	multi-national	corporations	will	completely	decimate
Fresh	Healthy	Vending,	whose	marketing	budget,	relatively	speaking,	is	virtually
nonexistent.


The	biggest	problem	that	VEND.OB	faces,	in	our	opinion,	will	be	an	inability	to	acquire
new	franchisees	in	the	wake	of	past	legal	problems	surrounding	individuals	either	involved
or	previously	involved	with	the	company.	Vending	machine	sales	historically	have
accounted	for	roughly	90	percent	of	total	sales,	and	during	the	past	two	years,	those
numbers	have	been	slashed	in	half.	Unfortunately	for	VEND.OB,	we	believe	the	drop	is
partially	due	to	a	lack	of	trust	among	potential	franchisees.

A	Stock	Promotion	Bubble	Waiting	to	Burst


A	color	brochure	touting	Fresh	Healthy	Vending,	Inc.	as	a	"$42,000,000,000	opportunity"
that	could	"make	investors	a	fortune"	due	to	new	Federal	legislation	has	made	its	way	into
physical	mailboxes	across	the	country.	We	have	already	debunked	the	notion	that
VEND.OB	will	be	a	market	leader	in	this	space	in	previous	sections,	so	we	will	focus	on
the	primary	reason	for	the	recent	rise	in	share	price	-	the	promotional	propaganda
designed	to	lure	naive	investors	into	buying	shares	of	VEND.OB:


Zoom	in	on	the	VEND.OB	brochure	legal	disclaimer	published	on	timlento.blogspot.com,
and	you	will	discover	one	very	important	sentence:

Brown	Dog	Marketing,	Inc.	paid	one	million	three	hundred	thousand	dollars	to
marketing	vendors	to	pay	for	all	the	costs	of	creating	and	distributing	this
advertisement.


Risk	vs.	Reward:	Accounting	For	Multiple	Halt	Risks


The	SEC	has	become	very	proactive	in	halting	penny	stocks	such	as	VEND.OB	for	a
variety	of	reasons,	and	it	appears	that	a	common	trait	is	that	most	halted	OTC	stocks	use
color	brochures	and	convincing	online	ads	costing	millions	of	dollars	to	produce.	Millions
of	dollars	are	spent	by	advertisers	in	order	to	sell	millions	and	sometimes	tens	of	millions
of	dollars	of	worth	of	stock	that	was	acquired	for	pennies	on	the	dollar.


The	use	of	color	brochures	and	online	ads	make	it	easy	for	the	SEC	to	identify	potential
investigations,	so	while	the	probability	of	any	one	particular	penny	stock	being	halted	on	a
given	day	is	low,	VEND.OB	is	one	of	the	most	active	penny	stocks	in	the	murky	OTC
market,	due	in	large	part	to	its	stock	promotional	advertising	campaigns.


The	magnitude	of	the	SEC's	recent	effort	to	curb	penny	stock	promotions	has	taken	many
by	surprise.	It	can	affect	any	company	actively	being	promoted,	including	operational
businesses	like	VEND.OB,	due	to	the	vague	response	typically	given	by	the	SEC	that	can
be	open	to	much	interpretation:


While	VEND.OB,	like	all	actively	promoted	stocks,	is	at	risk	for	a	trading	suspension,	we
believe	there	is	much	more	going	on	behind	the	scenes	in	an	effort	to	curb	unscrupulous
career	promoters.	In	our	opinion,	efforts	to	cease	stock	promotions	will	come	from	a
number	of	angles.


On	May	9,	2013,	the	Financial	Industry	Regulatory	Authority	(FINRA)	was	granted
authority	under	Rule	6440	to	halt	trading	in	OTC	equity	securities	if	it	determines	an
extraordinary	event	has	occurred,	which	has	a	material	effect	on	the	market	for	the	OTC
equity	security.	Some	would	argue	penny	stock	promotion	is	one	of	those	extraordinary
events,	because	it	certainly	has	a	material	effect	on	the	marketplace.	To	date,	FINRA	has
utilized	the	Rule	6440	"extraordinary	event"	halt	once	on	April	17,	2013,	when	it	halted
trading	in	Eco-Trade	Corp.	(OTC:BOPT).

It	is	our	opinion	that	promoted	penny	stocks	such	as	VEND.OB	may	also	begin	to	run
afoul	of	the	Federal	Trade	Commission.	Color	brochures	like	the	one	shown	above	are
highly	deceptive	marketing	materials	that	are	subject	to	interstate	commerce	laws	and	the
Federal	Trade	Commission	Act.


To	date,	the	FTC	has	not	pursued	cases	of	false	advertising	relating	to	promotional	penny
stock	brochures	similar	to	the	one	designed	for	Fresh	Healthy	Vending.	But	to	a
reasonable	person,	it	would	seem	that	truth-in-advertising	rules	clearly	are	being	broken
and	that	the	color	brochure	advertisements	are	incredibly	misleading.


Every	savvy	trader	and	investor	should	attempt	to	measure	risk	vs.	reward	prior	to
entering	a	trade.	There	was	a	time	when	OTC	traders	neglected	to	consider	SEC	trading
suspensions,	but	that	time	has	passed.	When	measuring	risk-to-reward	with	promoted
penny	stocks	like	VEND.OB,	it	is	a	necessity	that	investors	consider	SEC	suspension	and
FINRA	halt	risks	even	to	the	slightest	degree,	along	with	the	very	small	possibility	that	the
Federal	Trade	Commission	begins	taking	an	interest	in	these	misleading	and	deceptive
advertisements.

Part	A	depicts	the	illiquid	market	for	VEND.OB	shares	trading	in	the	fall	of	2013	around
$1.	Due	to	the	lack	of	liquidity,	large	VEND.OB	shareholders	would	be	unable	to	favorably
liquidate	the	millions	of	shares	they	purchased	at	less	than	a	penny	in	private
transactions.


Part	B	begins	in	mid-November,	when	a	$1.3	million	stock	promotion	campaign	launched
and	volume	picked	up.	Then,	in	February,	it	is	apparent	more	ad	dollars	were	spent,	and
thus	more	volume	was	created	for	large	early	shareholders	to	sell	stock	to	the	naive
public.


After	Part	B	is	completed	and	large	shareholders	have	finished	liquidating	stock,
promotion	spending	stops,	and	with	fewer	buyers	in	the	marketplace,	the	result	is	always
the	same:

We	believe	that	an	eventual	60-85	percent	collapse	in	share	price	is	likely.	As	our	track
record	shows,	Part	C	above	is	almost	fail-proof.	Sometimes,	the	share	price	of	promoted
penny	stocks	declines	more	than	99	percent,	but	as	we	pointed	out	earlier,	Fresh	Healthy
Vending	has	an	operating	business	with	existing	revenues,	so	a	60-85	percent	correction
is	more	reasonable.
