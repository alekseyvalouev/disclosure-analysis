The Undisclosed Lawsuit That BofI Holding And H&R Block
Shareholders Should Know About
Feb. 2, 2015 7:30 AM ET76 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


BOFI has not disclosed a ~$400M breach of contract lawsuit dating back to July
2012.


The breach of contract case is set to go to jury trial in October.


The damages claimed in the lawsuit appear to be material in relation to BOFI’s book
value.


BOFI states in its SEC filings that it is not involved in any material legal proceedings.


In our opinion, Gregory Garrabrants displayed a rather distasteful sense of humor during
the BOFI 2Q15 earnings call. When a KBW analyst inquired as to whether regulators had
asked BofI Holding (NASDAQ:BOFI) to tweak anything in its business model as part of the
H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) approval process, he had a rather odd response:


I have to say, Julianna, I'm going to give you like the award for that. I think my dad
had a good sense of humor and he used to say - when you get a question like have
you stopped beating your wife, you always have to stop and say, wait a minute, what
was that question?


We find nothing humorous about domestic violence.


We are glad that sell-side analysts are beginning to ask the same questions we have been
asking.


We did have one question for management coming out of the earnings call that we were
unable to ask.


Why is BOFI not disclosing a lawsuit from 2012 that is going to jury trial in October of this
year?


Given this case pertains to an acquisition of deposits and breach of contract, we think
H&R Block shareholders would be particularly interested in the details of the lawsuit.

Two current and active lawsuits (links provided below) have been brought to our attention
since our first article on BOFI. We encourage readers to digest the contents of the lawsuits
on their own and form their own conclusions. We provide short summaries below.


Undisclosed Lawsuit #1 - Breach of Contract Claim


BOFI is accused of breaching a contract with Waterfield Financial Services in connection
with an acquisition of deposits.


We summarized the damages claimed in this case below:


Undisclosed Lawsuit #2 - Class Action Wiretapping Lawsuit


BOFI is accused of recording phone calls without the plaintiff's permission.


In its most recent 10-Q, under legal proceedings, BOFI states the following:


Item 1. Legal Proceedings:


"We are not involved in any material legal proceedings. From time to time we may be
a party to a claim or litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business, such as claims
to enforce liens, claims involving the origination and servicing of loans, and other issues
related to the business of the Bank."


We reviewed BOFI's financial statements dating back to 2012 and found no mention
of any active legal proceedings.


We have no view on the merits of the lawsuits. Given the nature of the lawsuits, we do not
believe that they fall under the category of "ordinary course of business" lawsuits. We also
note that the damages claimed in the breach of contract lawsuit appear to make up a
significant proportion of BOFI's book value.

BOFI has also countersued, and the case appears to have been actively litigated for
several years now. We therefore found it highly irregular that BOFI has never disclosed
the existence of these lawsuits in its public filings, particularly given that the July 2012
case is set to go to jury trial in October 2015.


Most public companies that we follow provide ample disclosures regarding lawsuits of this
magnitude. Details provided generally include the name of the case, the venue, a brief
description of the case, and some commentary on the merits of the case. Therefore, the
lack of any mention of these court cases surprised us.


Just look at H&R Block's filings to get a sense for what standard litigation disclosures look
like.


We already covered the numerous questions we have about BOFI's disclosures in our last
article:


BofI Holding: Will Regulators Strike?


We were also surprised BOFI received no questions about its loan book performance on
the earnings call. We note that non-performing and delinquent loan issues appear to be to
manifesting themselves at BOFI, with NPLs / 90 day past due delinquent loans picking up
rapidly sequentially. Despite these trends, BOFI yet again recorded an incredibly small
allowance for loan loss provisions:

Given the uptick in NPLs, one would expect to see loan loss provisions grow
commensurately with the NPL growth. We plotted out BOFI's allowance for loan losses
against its NPL balance. For those less familiar with bank analysis, we looked at the size
of BOFI's loan loss reserves in comparison to its non-performing loan balance. For a bank
growing loans at a 50%+ pace, one would expect the allowance for loan losses to run at
>100% of current NPLs in even the healthiest of banks in order to capture loan growth.
We also plotted out the sequential growth in BOFI's allowance for loan losses against its
NPL growth in the past two quarters. In our opinion, both metrics point to management
under-reserving against future loan losses.

Other questions that we think should have been asked on the earnings call:


What proportion of your loans are to foreign nationals? Given the recent appreciation
of the USD, do you see any risk of an uptick in defaults in your foreign national loan
portfolio given mortgage affordability has stepped down meaningfully for non-USD
denominated home buyers?

Based on your recent loan to Vapor Hub International (OTCPK:VHUB) (see loan
agreement here), is BOFI now entering the penny stock lending business? How do you
think about loss rates when you lend to these types of companies?
How are the January 2014 changes to prepayment penalty rules impacting your
business? Your refi/prepayments appear to be accelerating - is this a potential
headwind to loan growth going forward?


Summary Thoughts


During the conference call, Garrabrants also took the unusual step of calling out short-
sellers of his stock. He said that "short-sellers are trying to stem the pain they're going to
feel by choosing poorly which shares they short".


Ultimately, short-sellers and long investors are looking for the same thing - transparency in
order to conduct fundamental stock analysis. On the 2Q15 conference call, Mr.
Garrabrants expressed clear frustration with the "short-sellers" of his stock.


Attacking the short-sellers will not alleviate these frustrations.


A simple solution to Mr. Garrabrants' frustrations would be for BOFI to provide investors
with more color on: the contents of its loan book, its lending standards, why it finds its
current loan loss provisions appropriate, and what regulatory risks it is taking in the
process of underwriting its wide spread loans.


Garrabrants on the call also stated that "people have been able to write things that are
untrue about us, and, really, I don't know how much effect they've had…I think mostly
they've been disregarded for the drivel that they are".


We see signs that Garrabrants himself has not disregarded our previous write-up as
"drivel". We note that since our article was published, both he and the CFO have modified
their official biographies.
