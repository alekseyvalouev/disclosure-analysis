Kandi Set To Surrender Gains Again

Volatile times have returned once again to Kandi Technologies (NASDAQ:KNDI). Just 8
days ago, Kandi was a $5.00 stock. But then 3 bullish articles and 1 brief press release
sent the stock soaring by more than 80%.


Back in June we saw the same thing. The stock more than doubled to $8.50 on the back
of several extremely bullish articles and 2 press releases that appeared transformational
for Kandi. Predictions swirled that "this time was the real deal" and that Kandi would
continue to soar to ever higher highs. But just as it has each time in the past, Kandi
quickly fell by 50% from those highs, giving up nearly all of its gains. The stock quickly
settled back to below $4.50 and the transformational news was forgotten.


We are now seeing the same phenomenon again. The recent gains are evaporating on
huge volume. By Monday, the shares had fallen by as much as 20% to $7.50 in extended
hours trading. Just as we saw in June and July, the stock is once again likely to find itself
back around $5.00 as investors come to better understand the latest developments.


I have lived in and out of China for over 20 years. I speak Chinese. I have owned and
driven multiple electric vehicles in China. I have followed Kandi for years. If Kandi truly
had multi bagger potential, I would be the first one to take a large long position and tell the
world why. I would be thrilled to make a few hundred percent, as predicted by the Kandi
bulls.


No one can predict what will happen in 5-10 years. It may still be the case that Kandi can
turn itself into the company that its promoters are claiming it is now.


But in the near term, there are two reasons why the stock is basically certain to return to
$5.00 or below.


First, some of the most important information being written by the Kandi bulls is 100%
inaccurate. Despite the claims of the Kandi bulls, even with the cooperation with Geely,
Kandi is still a very small player in the EV market in China. The bulls continually suggest
that Kandi is the only or the largest EV player in China. They liken Kandi to Tesla Motors
(NASDAQ:TSLA), BYD or ZipCar (ZIP) which is just simply not the case.

Kandi's latest surge is due to the hype surrounding China's announcement of subsidies for
electric vehicles. But what the bulls have missed is that there are in fact hundreds of
identical EV makers in China that make cars which are nearly identical to Kandi. These
manufacturers are already selling a far greater volume than Kandi. In fact, during the last
quarter, Kandi only sold a few hundred EVs in total. The vast majority of its sales were for
gasoline powered Go Karts. Other EV makers in China have a wide head start on Kandi,
even though American stock market investors have never heard of them.


The latest developments with Geely and HangZhou will no doubt increase Kandi's sales of
EVs into the thousands within a year or so.


But any statement that Kandi is the "only" company who will benefit from Chinese
subsidies is 100% false. In fact, any statement that Kandi is a meaningful player in
the Chinese EV market is 100% false. Investors who wish to confirm this can do so
quite easily for themselves.


A link to prices and descriptions of literally hundreds of identical vehicles from different
manufacturers can be found here on Alibaba. These descriptions are in English. In
addition, beyond these there are even hundreds of additional makes and models which
are listed in Chinese only. Additional searches on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) or even Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) will reveal the same thing. Those who are interested can simply paste
in the search term "电动汽车". The performance specs for these vehicles are nearly
identical to the very generic vehicle made by Kandi. The production capacities for these
hundreds of manufacturers in China is often larger than Kandi's. And the prices of these
vehicles is consistently in the same range as (or even lower than) Kandi's.


This directly contradicts the repeated statements of the Kandi promoters that Kandi is
unique in China the way that Tesla is in the US. It is simply a convenient hyperbole which
helps to boost the stock.


The second reason why Kandi refuses to hold its gains is that Kandi is starting to
become an obvious stock promotion scheme for Kandi to sell stock at higher
prices.


Whenever the stock spikes, it is only because of promotional articles and well timed press
releases from Kandi. Each time it seems that Kandi then issues millions worth of stock
and the price immediately begins to plunge.


We have now seen the same exact game three times in 2013 alone. And we just saw
it again last week.

We saw this in January when Kandi announced Geely news just in time to extend the
maturity of millions of dollars in warrants.


We then saw it again in June when Kandi's share price soared by 100% to $8.50 following
two press releases and several hyper promotional articles. The promotion and ramp up in
the stock coincided perfectly with Kandi's need to issue equity immediately thereafter.
Kandi had $25 million in debt coming due the following week and only $3 million in cash.
After Kandi issued $26 million in stock plus millions of warrants, the stock quickly fell back
to around $4.50. The seemingly "transformational news" quickly became irrelevant after
Kandi had the money in hand.


Now we have seen it again in September. Once again, Kandi soared past $8.50 on a
series of promotional articles and a press release. This was no different than in June. The
stock had previously been trading at just $5.08. On September 20th, Kandi once again
took advantage of the fortuitous share price spike to file an S3 registration statement
covering over a million warrants which will result in over $5 million of new money to Kandi.
The strike price on the warrants was $5.40, such that without a convenient stock
promotion, the warrants would not be exercised and Kandi would not take in the $5
million. As in the past, now that Kandi has their money, the stock has quickly begun to
plunge. The stock has already fallen by as much as 20% from its recent high and on very
heavy volume.


The point is that every time the stock surges on major news, it seems to coincide
with Kandi extracting money from an elevated stock sale. And every time Kandi
gets it money, the stock price fades almost immediately.


Evaluating the recommendations from Kandi bulls


Authors Art Porcari, Harris Goldman and Tom Konrad have now written over 30 articles on
Kandi between them.


Art Porcari himself has now written 19 articles on Kandi and has never written an article
focused on a single other company. He is solely focused on this single stock. Mr. Porcari
previously ran his own brokerage firm and his financial involvement with Kandi and its
management dates back roughly to its reverse merger more than 5 years ago. In a
previous article, I documented Mr. Porcari's regulatory violations where he misled
investors by providing inaccurate information to imply a "short squeeze" in order to inflate
the value of a stock. I will leave it to readers to determine for themselves if this is relevant
to the present.

On June 24th he wrote an article that made the most bullish claims for Kandi yet, stating:
"Kandi Technologies' Recent Multi-Billion Dollar Coup Creates An Avis ZipCar Times Ten"


As always, it was the prediction of a short squeeze that would make this investment payoff
for those who quickly bought shares of Kandi. The stock surged (as always) and the very
next day Kandi issued $26 million in stock. Management at Kandi should certainly be
grateful for this timely publication of the "Billion Dollar Coup" analysis. But as soon as
Kandi had their money, the stock price began to plunge. It settled below $4.50 within
weeks.


Again on September 17th, the former brokerage owner predicted that an epic short
squeeze would send Kandi soaring. Kandi did in fact soar based on the information
provided by Mr. Porcari. Within 3 days, Kandi was filing an S3 for warrants which
otherwise would not have been exercisable. Over the past 3 days, we can already see the
20% plunge from the top.


Mr. Porcari's relationship with Kandi management and his initial ownership of stock dates
back to the time of their reverse merger. But Mr. Porcari has publicly stated that he has not
taken compensation at any time for promoting the stock over the past few years or for
introducing various investors to Kandi.


In actuality, investors who have bought on the back of Porcari articles have done
extremely well for themselves - just as long as they get in early and then dump their
shares within a few days of the rise. If the institutional buyers cited by Mr. Porcari have
been selling on the back of each pump, then this series of successful articles has become
a formula for them to make millions of dollars every few months. But those who simply
hold their shares find that their gains all consistently evaporate within a few weeks of the
pump.


Back in June, Mr. Porcari had given assurances in comments on Seeking Alpha and
Yahoo! Finance that somehow he knew who was holding the majority of shares in the float
and that these were very firm hands that would not sell below $15-30. He also assured us
that Kandi would never consider issuing stock at prices below $15.00. Some were
therefore surprised when Kandi issued $26 million of stock at $6.02 and the "firm hand"
investors clearly dumped their stock. After hitting a new high for the year, Kandi quickly
plunged by 50%.


But again, the pattern to notice is that Mr. Porcari tends to write his articles when the
share price is low. The share price then leaps up accordingly, which is very fortunate when
Kandi needs to raise money. As a result, buying on the back of a Porcari article has been

profitable, but only if one sells very quickly thereafter.


This contrasts sharply with Harris Goldman.


Mr. Goldman has written a total of 4 articles on Seeking Alpha. As with Mr. Porcari, he has
never written about any stock other than Kandi, despite his 40 years of investment
