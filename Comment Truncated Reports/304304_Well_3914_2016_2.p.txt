• No	sign	this	is	a	high-tech	company:	No	capex,	no	R&D,	and	suspiciously	low	
employee	wages
• Company	business	and	strategy	make	no	sense	to	industry	specialists
• Press	releases	are	misleading	and	massive	misrepresentations
• Company	“partners”	do	not	acknowledge	Jig-Saw
• Accounting	practices	raise	red	flags
• The	only	target	co.	makes	public	is	its	desired	market	capitalization

The	Jig-Saw	Story:	a	humble	beginning


3


Jig-Saw’s	history	is	different.	According	 to	its	own	official	
account,	the	firm	was	founded	 14.5	years	ago	in	Sapporo	
City,	northern	 Japan.	Its	name	was	“IP	Telecom”	and	it	
worked	on	software	development.	For	7	years,	nothing	 of	
note	happened.	 In	2008	the	company	was	renamed	“Jig-
Saw”	and	merged	with	2	others,	”Yunikid Holdings	 Corp.”	
and	“Super-Edition	Corp,”	neither	of	which	have	an	online	
presence.	Soon	after,	Jig-Saw	entered	systems	and	server	
management.	No	other	business	directions	are	mentioned	
by	the	company	at	this	point.


Fast-forward	to	2014.	Jig-Saw	moves	HQ	to	Tokyo	and	starts	
preparing	 for	an	IPO.	Suddenly,	in	2015	a	different	company	
emerges	…


Most	early-stage	IT	companies	start	with	
one	product	or	area	of	specialization.	For	
example,	Google	 started	with	a	search	
engine;	Facebook	with	a	social	media	site,	
and	DeNa with	mobile	phone	games.	Over	
time,	once	this	product	is	successful,	the	
company	expands.

Jig-Saw	Reloaded:	by	2015	Co.	Claims	it	Develops:


• Auto	Sensoring &	Auto	Direction		(A&A)
• Internet	of	Things		(IoT)
• Artificial	Intelligence	(AI)
• Blockchain
• Autonomous	Driving
• Big	Data
• Augmented	&	Virtual	Reality		(AR	&	VR)
• MVNO

Jig-Saw	Opens	”Japan’s	Largest	Control	Room”


Six	months	year	before	making	an	initial	
public	offering,	the	company	says	that	it	
opened	a	24-hour,	365-days	a	year	state-
of-the-art	control	room	in	Sapporo,	taking	
up	500	m2 of	prime	real	estate	in	the	
center	of	the	city.


Jig-Saw	claims	that	32	staff	work	at	its	
Sapporo	center.


5
Result:	IPO	Success,	Flamed	by	VIP	Names


• Jig-Saw	sells	its	shares	amid	rumors,	later	
confirmed,	that	Japan’s	most	famous	music	
producer,	Yasushi	Akimoto,	will	buy	a	stake


• Well-known	entrepreneur	Hidehito	Maeda,	
the	founder	of	the	Hanamaru Udon noodle
chain	also	buys	stock


• Stock	is	mainly	pitched	to	Japanese	retail
investors	with	minimal	details	on	the	state
of	Jig-Saw’s	business

Red	Flag	#1:	Spending	More	on	Offices	Than	R&D


The	first	red	flags	were	in	Jig-Saw’s	IPO	
documentation.	The	chart	on	the	right	
shows	how	Jig-Saw	described	spending	
plans	post	IPO.	


Keep	in	mind	that	“New	Technology”	
was	detailed	as	the	development	of:

Red	Flag	#2:	Hiring	Budget	Insufficient


According	to	the	data	of	Robert	
Walters,	one	of	the	biggest	
recruitment	firms	in	Japan,	the	
average	salary	for	a	software	
engineer	in	Tokyo	is	between	¥6	
million	and	¥10	million.


This	means,	Jig-Saw’s	budget	would	allow	
for	the	hiring	of	10-24	staff.


If	you	divide	that	by	the	number	of	
technology	areas	that	Jig-Saw	says	it	is	
developing,	the	result	would	be	an	
addition	of	1	or	2	staff	per	area	over	3	
years!


8
Red	Flag	#3:	No	Sense	or	Synergy
We	presented	Jig-Saw’s	own	explanation	of	its	operations	and	business	model	with	the	
company	name	blurred	out	to	a	number	of	IT	industry	experts.	This	is	what	they	said….


“It	just	seems	 like	they’re	throwing	together	buzzwords.	I	have	no	idea	what	the	context	is.	I	mean,	I	
know	the	individual	areas	but	I	can’t	tell	from	the	[company]	description	what	problem	they’re	
solving.	Data	management	can	mean	a	lot	of	things.	I	see	that	they	provide	some	kind	of	SaaS*	cloud	
platform.	But,	what	it	does	exactly	and	how	it’s	useful	is	beyond	me.”
Computer	Science	staff	at	a	Cambridge,	Massachusetts-based	University,	U.S.


“It	seems	a	bit	weird	to	put	so	many	buzzwordsnext	to	each	other.	It	doesn’t	make	anything	clear.	
This	is	a	puzzle…	I	think	they’re	very	early	stage	and	[seem	to]	avoid	saying	what	they	actually	do.	
What	they	claim	to	have	is	a	set	of	algorithms	capable	of	detecting	certain	patterns	and	weak	signals	
to	help	managers	manage	things	better.	Lots	of	people	work	on	this	subject.	It’s	not	new.	The	claim	of	
having	something	that	works	for	everything	is	a	bold	one.	Nothing	is	impossible	in	software	and	I’m	
an	optimist,	but	I’d	like	to	see	what	they	do	before	investing.”
Founder	of	a	European	VR	firm,	tech	investor

*	SaaS:	Software	as	a	service,	a	software	licensing	and	delivery	model	in	which	software	is	licensed	on	a	
subscription	basis	and	is	centrally	hosted.	It	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	"on-demand	software.”	(Wikipedia)
Red	Flag	#4:	Jig-Saw	Gave	its	External	Auditors	
Stock	Before	the	IPO…	and	They	Sold	It!
• Jig-Saw	gave	its	three	external	auditors	–
who	are	supposed	to	be	unbiased	in	
fulfilling	the	fiduciary	duties	– equity	stakes	
in	the	company.	This	is	a	major	conflict	of	
interest.


• Not	only	that…	The	three	sold	all	of	their	
shares	at	the	IPO.	What	did	they	know	
about	Jig-Saw’s	prospects	that	ordinary	
stakeholders	did	not?

Jig-Saw	Openly	Talks	About	its	Market	Cap	Goal


13


“Our	first	checkpoint	is	a	
market	value	of	¥500	billion…”
See	Below


As	for	the	¥500	billion	market	cap	
target,	"I'll	say	one	thing,	this	is	
the	clear	intention	of	the	
management.	It's	our	waypoint.	
That's	the	reason	we're	expanding	
the	business.	 There'll	be	
challenges	but	we	have	the	ability	
to	venture	forward.	....	And	we're	
not	thinking	of	a	long	span	such	
as	10	years.	We	want	to	succeed	
as	soon	 as	possible."
"I	can't	comment	on	the	stock	
price,	but	I	think	 that	increasing	
the	value	of	the	business	 and	its	
share	price	is	everything....	I	am	
always	watching	the	stock	price."

But	What	Actually	Drives	the	Stock?	Hype	and	
Fact	Distortion


14


Big	Name	Partners1. Jig-Saw	issued	more	than	60	press	releases	
over	the	last	year	building	on	its	buzzwords,	
but	not	giving	further	detail	on	its	business


2. Among	these	were	frequent	mentions	of	
tie-ups	or	partnerships	with	major	
companies	and	even	foreign	organizations	
such	as	NASA


3. Company	announcements	about	the	size	of	
a	market	in	which	they	have	no	products


4. Announcements	of	acquisitions	that	in	fact	
were	immaterial	to	Jig-Saw’s	financials
Red	Flag	#5:	Jig-Saw’s	Business	“Partners”


• None	the	companies	that	Jig-Saw	announcement	partnerships	with	have	
reciprocated	with	a	statement	on	their	own	website


• Of	those	that	responded	when	approached	on	this	issue,	none	of	the	companies	
were	able	to	confirm	an	official	partnership	with	Jig-Saw


• Some	of	the	“partners”	said	that	Jig-Saw	was	a	client for	the	services	they	
provided


• A	manager	at	an	major	international	firm	said	unofficially	that	when	he	saw	the	
Jig-Saw	press	statement	he	was	shocked	at	the	mis-representation.	His	firm	
considered	taking	action	and	may	still	do	so


15
Jig-Saw’s	Acquisitions:	What	Value?
• As	part	of	its	hype	campaign,	Jig-Saw	has	dedicated	10	press	releases	to	acquisitions.	All	of	these	
were	of	small	companies	that	were	either	funded	by	or	introduced	to	Jig-Saw	by	its	own	biggest	
shareholder:	Mr.	Jun	Emi


• None	of	them	have	significantly	added	to	Jig-Saw’s	cash	flow


16


• Rev	of	only	
¥59m…	down	
74%	YoY!


• OP	of	 ¥(40)m


• Jig-Saw’s	biggest	investor	
Jun	Emi	led	¥100m	angel	
round	for	30%	stake	 in	
co.,	suggesting	it	has	total	
value	of	only	¥300m


• Kudan does	not	have	any	
strategic	investors


• The	co.	has	just	12	staff!


• Jig-Saw	acquired	a	2-3%	
stake	in	Sekai with	Emi’s	
involvement


• Despite	Jig-Saw	claims,	
Sekai has	nothing	to	do	
with	Blockchain


• Sekai completed	one	real	
estate	deal	using	Bitcoin.	
That’s	the	extent	of	its	
foray	into	Blockchain.


• Emi’s	connection	from	
his	Accenture	days


• Very	small	consulting	
firm	with	capital	of	
only	¥6,850!


• Has	nothing	to	do	with	
“smart	transportation”	
as	claimed	by	Jig-Saw
Jig-Saw	CF	Statement	Confirms	Stakes	Worth	
Very	Little


• 83%	stake	in	Mobicom
acquired	for	only	¥50.0m


• Insignificant	stakes	in	
Kudan and	Sekai were	
acquired	for	¥30.6m


• News	regarding	these	
companies	should	not	
move	the	stock.	But	it	did!


17
Despite	all	the	M&A	and	Hype	Jig-Saw	Failed	
to	Meet	Financial	Targets	or	to	Give	Outlook
• Revenues	were	light	and	growth	decelerated	from	33%	in	FY15	to	30%	in	FY16
• No	company	guidance	issued	for	this	financial	year	5	months	into	the	year.	During	May	quarterly	
results,	Jig-Saw	said	that	it	was	“too	difficult	to	give	a	meaningful	forecast”	for	its	financial	results	
this	year.	It	also	said	it	could	not	issue	a	forecast	for	its	majority	owned	Mobicom.


18
Reason	for	the	Revenue	Miss:	Maybe	Jig-Saw	
Isn’t	Actually	Doing	What	It	Says?
Let’s	remember	again	what	Jig-Saw	says	it	is	developing:


• Auto	Sensoring&	Auto	Direction		(A&A)
• Internet	of	Things		(IoT)
• Artificial	Intelligence	(AI)
• Blockchain
• Autonomous	Driving
• Big	Data
• Augmented	&	Virtual	Reality		(AR	&	VR)
• MVNO
• Space	Exploration
• Smart	Transportation
• Cloud	and	Cloud	Security	Services


19
So,	Where’s	the	Investment	to	Act?


In	fact,	2015	R&D	was	only	¥11.7m	and	capex	
was	almost	zero:


20


FY15	Total	Capex	of	
¥588,000…..the	cost	
of	3	computers!


FY15	Total	R&D	of	
¥11.7m	is	enough	to	
support	1	or	2	
employees	max!


At	the	time	of	the	IPO,	the	promised R&D	amount	
for	2015	was	¥28	million:
Where	Are	the	High	Tech	Engineers?


1. Jig-Saw’s	average	employee	salary	is	
extremely	low.	These	are	not	expensive	
engineers


21


2.					The	caliber	of	staff	Jig-Saw	is	hiring	has	not	
increased.	Its	staff	average	only	2.5	years	at	the	
company	and	are,	on	the	whole,	very	young


Average	call	
center	wage	in	
Japan	 is	4.5m!
Wait….	Where	are	any Jig-Saw	Staff?
We	sent	an	investigator	to	check	on	Jig-Saw’s	
state-of-the-art,	500	m2 control	room	in	
Sapporo	City.	The	facility,	the	company	claims,	
hosts	32	staff.


Over	1	day	of	monitoring	in	April	2016,	the	
investigator	counted	3	staff	entering	and	
leaving	the	office.	Subsequent	interviews	with	
building	management	confirmed	that	very	
few	people	stop	by	the	Jig-Saw	office.


22


Maybe	this	is	why	Jig-Saw’s	Sapporo	
office	 looks	so	empty	in	the	picture….
It’s	clear	Jig-Saw	doesn’t	have	the	investment	
or	the	R&D	team	to	develop	cutting-edge	
technology.	


What	about	its	clients?	Do	they	need	the	
products	Jig-Saw	claims	to	be	working	on?


23
Jig-Saw’s	Top	Clients	are	Small	and	Low	Tech


This	is	a	list	of	Jig-Saw’s	biggest	clients	in	terms	of	receivables	due	at	the	time	of	IPO	in	April	2015:


• Nifty:	Internet	provider	and	e-commerce
• Data	Stadium:	Sports	data	simulation
• Nagase:	Education	/	training
• Forecast	Communications:	Online	media
• IDC	Frontier:	Cloud	storage


24


None	of	the	above	are	widely	known	to	be	involved	in	AI,	IoT,	VR,	AR,	Autonomous	Driving,	Blockchain,	
or	the	other	hype	initiatives	Jig-Saw	says	it	is	developing.


Also,	where	are	the	big	name	partners	mentioned	in	Jig-Saw’s	many	press	releases?
What	does	Jig-Saw	actually	do?


After	looking	through	the	client	list,	speaking	with	some	of	Jig-Saw’s	associates,	and	
dissecting	the	company’s	veiled	and	vague	statements,	our	conclusion	is	that	its	main	(and	
probably	only)	real	business	is…….


Computer	Server	Maintenance	and	Network	Monitoring


25


The	problem	is,	the	evolution	of	cloud	computing	is	
putting	this	low	tech	server	business	into	decline,	as	Jig-
Saw’s	operating	profit	table	for	2010	to	2014	shows……
Unlike	Jig-Saw,	Real	High-Tech	Companies	are	
Putting	Their	Money	Where	Their	Mouth	Is….

• These	companies	include	hair	salons,	jewelry	retailers,	schools,	toy	stores,	and	
funeral	service	firms	among	many	other	“low	tech“	businesses


• None	of	these	companies	are	looking	to	monitor	robots	on	the	moon,	to	pursue	A.I.,

Conclusion
• If	Jig-Saw	cannot	articulate	its	strategy,	business	model,	or	product	set;
• If	Jig-Saw	promises	to	make	investments	and	does	not	follow	through	on	this	


spending	and	fails	to	attract	top	talent;
• If	Jig-Saw	makes	frequent	but	vague	announcements	on	new	acquisitions	and	tie-


ups	that	are	immaterial	to	its	financials;
• If	Jig-Saw’s	supposed	“partners”	do	not	acknowledge	the	relationship;
• If	Jig-Saw	becomes	massively	overvalued	versus	faster	growing	peers;
• If	the	company	misses	their	first	and	only	financial	guidance	then	refuses	to	give	an	


outlook;
• And	If	Jig-Saw’s	managers	and	top	investors	are	selling	its	stock….


What	should	ordinary	shareholders	do?
