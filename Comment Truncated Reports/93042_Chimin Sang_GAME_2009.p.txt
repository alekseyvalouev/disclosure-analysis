In my previous two articles: "Shanda Games SpinOff" and "Shanda Mispricing", I talked
about how Shanda Interactive (SNDA) is mis-priced based on the market value of
Shanda Games (GAME), because each Shanda Interactive share owns about $20 cash,
3 shares of GAME and $9 worth of a gaming platform business.


It actually does not take a PhD degree to figure out from the articles that you can extract
the value of the ex-Game stub of SNDA by long one share of SNDA and short 3 shares
of GAME. This stub has been on sale between $14 and $18 for the past 2 weeks, while
its actual value is more like $29.


For the past 3 days, the stub price has been rising. The SNDA price dropped, but the
GAME price dropped even harder.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the

Many GAME stock holders get frustrated on the GAME share price drop while they did
not find much change in fundamentals and believed that the share price became
disproportionally cheaper than its peers. Many of them believe that the majority of
money managers will choose to sell SNDA and buy GAME since GAME is a much purer
online game play than SNDA, which will expand into the content business.


But the truth may just be the opposite. A hedged position has about 60% upside, from
$18 as of today to $29. As I mentioned in "Shanda Mispricing", one way to converge is
for SNDA to announce a complete spin-off of GAME shares. But I believe that the
convergence, or a close convergence, will come as early as the next earning report,
when the numbers are made clearer. As a result, a smart money manager is most likely
doing the opposite: buying SNDA and selling GAME.
