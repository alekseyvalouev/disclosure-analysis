Did The CEO Of Herbalife Violate The Fair Disclosure Rule?

We discussed three issues in our first report on Herbalife (NYSE:HLF). The report focused
on the company's violation of a California Court order, the Belgium pyramid scheme ruling
and the suspiciously high packaging fees levied on distributors.


Since Bill Ackman's presentation on December 20th, Herbalife has, to no one's surprise,
been on the defensive. CEO Michael Johnson made some phone calls last week that he
might just end up regretting. Here's a timeline of the chain of events, with further
discussion surrounding the seriousness of these potential violations.


Timeline


1. On December 20, 2012, noted hedge fund titan Bill Ackman accused Herbalife of
being a pyramid scheme during a presentation that lasted over three hours. Ackman's
presentation was attended by reporters and investors and it was streamed live on the
Internet.


2. In a press release dated December 24, 2012 Herbalife announced it will host an
Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York at 9:00 AM EST on January 10, 2013. The
press release notes that "Senior management will discuss the company's business in
detail" along with a "comprehensive response to investor questions on its business
model." This is being done in response to Ackman's presentation and pyramid scheme
allegations.


3. LA Times article dated December 21, 2012:

Pressure for Johnson to take action intensified Friday as Herbalife's shares slid 19%
to $27.27. The stock has dropped 36% since Ackman first said Wednesday that he
was shorting the stock. It's down more than 60% from its peak this year.


With investors punishing his company's stock for a third consecutive day, the top
executive of Herbalife Ltd. sought to reassure shareholders Friday [December 21,
2012] that his company is not a pyramid scheme. Working from the firm's tony
headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, Herbalife chief Michael Johnson
telephoned institutional investors, including fund managers at Fidelity, disputing
highly publicized criticism from prominent New York hedge fund manager Bill
Ackman.


(Emphasis added)


4. As of July 31, 2012, Fidelity's various funds [collectively] held 17.1 million Herbalife
shares.


5. On December 24, 2012 (half trading day due to Holiday) 19.287 million Herbalife
shares traded; ending down 4.44% from the previous day.


6. Regulation FD Violation


On August 15, 2000, the SEC adopted Regulation FD to address the selective disclosure
of information by publicly-traded companies and other issuers. Regulation FD provides
that when an issuer discloses material nonpublic information to certain individuals or
entities-generally, securities market professionals, such as stock analysts, or holders of
the issuer's securities who may well trade on the basis of the information-the issuer must
make public disclosure of that information.


According to the LA times, Johnson's telephonic conversations with institutional investors,
including a fund manager at Fidelity, consists of "disputing highly publicized criticism" [Bill
Ackman's allegations and presentation].


Herbalife, including but not limited to Johnson, will not reveal Herbalife's version of the
facts "disputing highly publicized criticism" [Bill Ackman's allegations and presentation] to
members of the public, including any institutional investors not called by Johnson on
Friday, until January 10, 2013.

Johnson had direct telephonic conversations with a fund manager for Fidelity and an
unidentified number of other institutional investors.


We have no way of knowing what information was given by Johnson to these large
holders of Herbalife's shares. However, it would seem clear to any reasonable person that
Johnson withheld any material information from Fidelity and the unidentified other
institutional investors that had the potential to cause these entities to dispose off their
positions in Herbalife.


In the aforementioned December 24, 2012 press release, Herbalife noted that "it has
retained Moelis & Company as its strategic advisor." It is noteworthy that Moelis &
Company are prominent in the field of Leveraged Buy-Outs ("LBO").


Johnson may have hinted (to Fidelity and the unidentified institutional investors) that
Herbalife is planning an LBO; which may have nudged these institutions into holding their
positions in Herbalife. Because Herbalife has concealed the actual conversation Johnson
had with Fidelity and the unidentified institutional investors, we have no way to determine
what non-public material information Johnson disclosed to these entities.


According to the LA Times article (note # 3 in the timeline above) Michael Johnson
telephoned institutional investors, including fund managers at Fidelity." Did Johnson call all
institution investors that maintain long positions in Herbalife; or, did Johnson select
specific institutional investors (perhaps based on their Herbalife holdings)?


Even if Herbalife issues an 8K revealing the fact that these private conversations occurred
on Friday; since these conversations were telephonic (as opposed to written) the public
will never know the specific back-and-forth conversations between Johnson and the fund
managers.


Bill Ackman has publicly stated that he intends to hold his short position (20 million
shares, according to Ackman) until Herbalife goes to zero. I believe that the total short
position on Herbalife is about 24 million shares.


We know that Johnson called the institutional investors for the purpose of "disputing
highly-publicized criticisms" of Herbalife [Ackman].


Perhaps Johnson's conversations with these institutional investors fell on deaf ears.


On December 24, 2012 (in a half day of trading) a little less than 20 million shares traded.
We can reasonably assume that Ackman was not participating in the market [Herbalife]
today. It is not unreasonable to suspect that either Fidelity or one of the other unidentified
