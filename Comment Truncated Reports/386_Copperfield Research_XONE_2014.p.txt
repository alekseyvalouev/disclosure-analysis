Before discussing the simple question of the title above, we want to
congratulate Gotham City Research on its outstanding work uncovering the
Let's Gowex fraud. Kudos to Gotham City Research for its outstanding work!


Moving on to ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), shares have had a parabolic move since
early May, climbing nearly 90% from its lows on minimal news. However, two
recent filings with the SEC led us to ask the simple question - Who is Tu
Guihua, Mega Fame Holdings, and Novel Century Ventures? This morning, a
Form, 3 was submitted with the SEC disclosing an initial statement of
beneficial ownership of 2,235,596 shares in XONE by a consortium "group"
comprised of two British Virgin Island funds called Novel Century Ventures and
Mega Fame Holdings, as well as an individual named Tu Guihua, that uses a
Chinese address in the Guizhou Province.[1] The shares reported by the
"group" would represent 15.5% of the outstanding shares based on disclosures
in ExOne's most recent 10Q.[2] Surely, the magnitude of the purchases,
representing a large percentage of volume during the recent parabolic move,
could explain the mysterious move in XONE. Based on the Form 3 disclosures,
it appears the "group" exceeded 5% requirement on 7/1/14 for 13D disclosure
pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1934. However, under the short
swing profit rule of the very same act, the "group" would be subject to short
swing profit restrictions given its ownership exceeds 10% of outstanding
shares. The goal of the six month statutory window is to "eradicate speculative
abuses."[3] (Investors may recall the Wood River Endwave securities
fraud/prison sentence when discussing the importance of beneficial ownership
filings[4]).
