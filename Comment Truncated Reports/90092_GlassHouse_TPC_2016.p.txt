Initiation of Tutor Perini (TPC) with a target price of sub $5.00 


GlassHouse Research inaugural research report focuses on the cash burning machine known 


as Tutor Perini (TPC). There is mountains of evidence laid out within this report that shows 


management has been more than cavalier (if not fraudulent) with its recent revenue 


recognition policies.  





Who is GlassHouse Research? GlassHouse Research is made up of former forensic 


accountants/analysts that have worked for prominent hedge funds on Wall Street as well as 


boutique forensic accounting firms. Our purpose is to expose fraudulent companies that have 


been taking advantage of US GAAP as well as IFRS accounting for their benefit. We seek to find 


companies where GAAP (or even worse non-GAAP) earnings are deviating from true economic 


earnings of the target firm.  





 Tutor Perini’s free-cash-flow plummets over the past five years: The combined impact 


of higher AR, rising claims and falling unearned income caused cash collections to 


plummet over 2012, 2013, 2014, and now 2015. 





 Ineptitude of TPC’s lackluster work exposed by looking at their accounting: While 


management continues to downplay the firm’s work delays and contract disputes on 


their conference call, the 10-K reveals a different story of bloated unapproved change 


orders and claims. 





 Lawsuits litter TPC’s 10-K filing attributable to shoddy work and exorbitant pricing 


invoiced to customers: Tutor Perini’s 2015 Annual Report details 10 lawsuits against the 


firm all due to contract disputes with previous customers.  





 Secret “other” assets accounts may be being used to hide bloated AR: The company’s 


“other current assets” and “other assets” accounts spiked 58% and 130% YOY, 


respectively. With no explanation given in the firm’s 10-K, we believe these accounts
could be used to either 1) hide some of the already bloated unbilled AR on the balance 


sheet and/or 2) capitalize operating expenses similar to WorldCom in the early 2000s. 





 Cost in excess of billings trends a harbinger for low quality backlog: The decline in cost 


in excess of billings suggest that TPC is taking less upfront payments on their work in 


order to entice customers. In our view, this as unsustainable going forward. 





 Debt levels cannot be repaid and default looms over the company: Already in violation 


of debt covenants, we call into concern TPC’s ability to repay contractual obligations in 


2018. 





 Accounting of Joint Ventures leads to many questions with no answers. 





 Insiders jumping ship in 2015 concurrent with stock price decline: Key executives 


Robert Band (President) and Michael Kershaw (CFO) bail at an opportunistic time.  








TPC’s Non-Existent Free-Cash-Flow 


   2015  2015  2013  2012  2011 


Cash From Operating Activities $14.1 -$56.7 $50.7 -$67.8 -$31.6 


Free Cash Flow -$21.8 -$131.7 $8.3 -$109.0 -$98.3 


Non-GAAP Earnings $59.1 $107.9 $87.3 $70.3 $86.2 





 As shown above, TPC has a major free-cash-flow problem. While the company has been 


able to report positive non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 (2015), $2.20 (2014), $1.80 (2013), 


$1.46 (2012), and $1.80 (2011), can we truly believe any of these figures??? 





 Revealing the subjectivity to TPC’s earnings, we provide this excerpt from the 10-K: 





(c) Use of Estimates 
  


The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and 


assumptions that affect reported amounts. These estimates are based on information available through the date of the 


issuance of the financial statements. Therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates. 





(d) Construction Contracts 
  


The Company and its affiliated entities recognize construction contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion 


method, based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Cost of revenue 


includes an allocation of depreciation and amortization. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred. Changes to total 


estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined.
 How has management done with their estimates??? Well let’s just take a look at this 


small footnote in the 2015 10-K: 


(a) During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a decrease of $0.53 in diluted EPS due to 


unfavorable adjustments on various Five Star Electric projects in the Specialty Contractors segment. In 


addition, there was a decrease of $0.28 in diluted EPS due to unfavorable adjustments to the estimated cost to 


complete a Building segment project in New York.  





 So how does management get away with this? Simple, due to percentage-of-completion 


accounting, management has the discretion to recognize revenue even though the firm 


is way behind on its projects! More in the next section. 








Unapproved Change Orders and Claims Dominate the Balance Sheet 





 What are unapproved change orders and claims and why are they important?  





According to the company they are: Both unapproved change orders and claims are 


amounts subject to pending litigation or dispute resolution proceedings. These amounts

Unbilled Costs and profits incurred to date Unapproved change orders Claims
are management’s estimate of the probable cost recovery from the disputed claims 


considering such factors as evaluation of entitlement, settlements reached to date and 


experience with the customer.  In the event that future facts and circumstances, 


including the resolution of disputed claims, cause a reduction in the aggregate amount 


of the estimated probable cost recovery from the disputed claims, the amount of such 


reduction will be recorded against earnings in the relevant future period. 





 In layman’s terms, TPC can recognize revenue on the income statement for sales that 


have not been invoiced or even agreed upon by the customer yet!   





 In fact, unapproved change orders and claims are the worst of these receivables and 


they are up 67% and 31% YOY, respectively in the last quarter! Put another way, TPC 


recognized $110.6 million in QOQ claims on the income statement this last quarter on 


sales that the company is in dispute with the customer!  


 So what’s going on here? With simple analysis of TPC’s accounting, we can see that the 


company is missing major milestones within their projects over the past 5 years. But 


instead of recognizing less revenue like a conservative manager should, TPC continues 


to recognize the full amount like nothing happened! This game can only last so long. 





 This is all corroborated with TPC’s plethora of lawsuits listed in the annual report. What 


are all these lawsuits about? You guessed it, shoddy work that the company has done in 


the past (google MGM & Tutor Perini). 





Other Assets Accounts Provide No Disclosures
 TPC lists two line items on its balance sheet (other current assets and other assets) and 


provides not disclosures for in its filings. 





 While no disclosure in itself isn’t concerning, it’s the rapid growth of these two accounts 


that boggles the mind. Specifically, other current assets is up 58% YOY to $108.8 million. 


While LT other assets are up an astonishing 130% YOY to $202.1 million.  





 While these two accounts may sound innocent enough, remember it was WorldCom 


that got into issues with capitalizing operating expenses on the balance sheet in the 


early 2000s. The same issues may apply here.  





 While CFO has to make payments each quarter to suppliers for normal operating 


expenses, the CFO has discretion to capitalize these expenses on the balance sheet 


instead of letting them flow through on the income statement. 





 Also, there is a risk here that management has just decided to reclassify many of the 


questionable receivables down in the “other” line item to be unnoticed!  





Backlog and Deferred Revenue Trends Will Lead to Top Line Decimation 





 While the firm’s noted backlog decline has been documented by the company. It’s the 


deferred revenue trends that are most telling about the company. 





 This tells us how much upfront cash customers are willing to give TPC before the project 


starts. Think of it as a down payment. Deferred revenues are now down 3 quarters in a 


row by double-digit YOY declines. Even worse, relative to sales, DR is now down in 13 of 


the last 14 quarters on a YOY basis! 





 Relative to total backlog, DR is now down in 11 of the last 14 quarters on a YOY basis. So 


as we can see, management is trying to entice customers to give them awards based on 


a lower upfront payment, but as we can see from award trends, this is not working. 





 This is quite telling from the firm’s quarterly book-to-bill ratio that has been under 1.0x 


for the last 5 periods (average of 0.9x). What does this mean? This means that TPC is 


taking more from its well of orders (total backlog) and not replenishing it fast enough 


with new orders.
TPC’s already modified debt covenants may increase incentives to manage earnings 


 In addition to the financial risks inherent to a company adding more debt to its capital 


structure, we are concerned about its potential impact on quality of earnings. In this 


regard, academic research indicates that high debt firms may be motivated to make 


more lenient accounting choices in an attempt to avoid violating its debt covenants 





 Tutor Perini just violated a bank loan covenant and required a waiver: 


In November, Tutor Perini had an earnings conference call for analysts that was notable 


for what it was missing – the earnings. Tutor ended up filing its required quarterly 


financial statements a week late. It needed the time to include a last minute court 


decision that caused it to take a small write-off.  Tutor failed to mention on the (non) 


earnings call that they also needed the week to work out things with their bank 


creditors, as they were in non-compliance with their bank covenants, according to the 


10q SEC filing. 





 The bank loan size was increased last year and covenants eased to accommodate 


Tutor’s need for more debt: 


In 2014, Tutor Perini was getting very low on cash.  The company needed to borrow 


more from its banks and reduce the payments on its existing debt so they renegotiated 


their bank loans in June 2014.  Because of the additional debt, there was no way to 


comply with the existing bank covenants. The key restriction on Tutor Perini was a ratio 


of its debt to the earnings available to pay the debt, called the “Consolidated Leverage 


Ratio”.

 While the specific financial figures in the bank loan documents make it difficult to 


calculate the ratios exactly, we estimate that Tutor’s debt was $886 million and the 


adjusted earnings figure was $240 million for the September 30, 2015 period.  This is a 


ratio of 3.69, above the 3.5 requirement. 





 The banks gave Tutor Perini a waiver – but the California High Speed Rail Authority and 


investors should still be concerned. 





 First, the write-off wasn’t that big. This means it was not a one-off occurrence. Tutor is 


in danger of violating its covenants again. Tutor’s debt has continued to grow over the 


last couple of years, despite a couple of very large cash inflows from longstanding legal 


disputes that just got settled. They have been forced to sell off assets at losses and have 


a limited ability to take on new debt. 





 Second, this is a write-off that should have been taken two years ago. A Tutor Perini 


subsidiary lost a lawsuit as part of a consortium that had failed to complete a tunnel 


project in Washington State. They had actually handed over the cash to the plaintiff for 


their share in 2013, but decided they were “owed” the money and booked a future 


payment in accounts receivable for the same amount while the case was being 


appealed. This is extremely aggressive accounting. While it may not have been material 


as a percentage of Tutor Perini’s annual revenues, it was just enough to make sure that 


Ronald Tutor met the threshold for corporate earnings to receive his multi-million bonus 


in 2013.

 Why did the state of California agree to pay Tutor Perini $32 million before they were 


required to? 


The violation of the debt covenant should draw attention to a change in the payment 


terms for the CP 1 construction contract (first segment of the California high speed rail 


project) this summer. The “earned value” / invoiced amount of the contract jumped 


suddenly this summer. Project officials said that this did not represent additional work 


that had been done, but rather a change in how Tutor Perini was being 


compensated.  The September 2015 operations report stated,” The increase in CP 1 


earned value during the August pay period is primarily a result of revising the way the 


Contractor is compensated for administrative overhead incurred to date.”  This was a 


substantial change. 





 In August 2015, the remaining contract value only decreased by $6 million, while the 


amount invoiced to date jumped from $134 million to $172 million. This suggests that 


the state of California, out of the goodness of their heart, allowed Tutor Perini to 


frontload an additional $32 million in payments.  While Tutor Perini did not disclose this 


payment or how they accounted for the windfall cash, it would have been enough to 


keep them in compliance with their bank covenants for the third quarter.  Why did the 


state make this payment? Why did they agree to this arrangement? Is there anything 


the state is getting, formally or informally, for helping Tutor out of a sticky situation? 





 This gets particularly concerning as Tutor Perini needs to disclose any changes in their 


financial status, including bank waivers of covenants, as part of their bid for CP 4, a 22 


mile construction segment. 





 The Authority should provide additional information about the change in contract 


payments. 


It should also require a full explanation from Tutor Perini about their need for additional 


debt, given the fact they are showing accounting profits. In particular, the agency should 


request detailed information about what comprises the accounts 


receivable category. Unlike all other large construction firms, Tutor’s ability to collect 


from its customers has declined substantially and consistently over the last couple of 


years. This either is a sign of a poorly run company or an indication that Tutor is saying 


people owe them money that maybe they don’t.1

Does the company’s current joint venture with a director, Raymond Oneglia, create a conflict 
of interest? 





 The Vice Chairman of O&G Industries (O&G), Raymond Oneglia, also serves as a director 
for TPC, where O&G occasionally participates in joint ventures with the company. While 
the total amount or revenue earned from the joint venture with O&G is currently 
marginal compared to total revenue, we remain concerned regarding a potential 
conflict of interest pertaining to contracts, especially if the joint venture starts to 
engage in larger projects together and/or disagreements with clients emerge.  





 Specifically, TPC shares of revenue from the joint venture amounted to $10.7 million, 
$7.0 million, $6.9 million, $19.3 million, $5.5 million and $1.2 million in 2015, 2014, 
2013, 2012, 2011 and 2009, respectively. Also disclosed in the 2015 10K, as of 12/31/15 
the company has a 30% interest in a joint venture with O&G as the sponsor for a 
highway construction project with an estimated total contract value of approximately 
$357.0 million. In addition, we note that O&G’s cumulative holdings of TPC’s stock as of 
12/31/15 were 500,000 shares.  





 Again, we observe that while the current revenue generated from this joint venture 
with O&G may be minimal, we see that there is potential for the JV to earn substantially 
more revenue in the future. And if this is the case, we question whether contracts made 
with O&G can truly be made at an “arm’s length” transaction with Mr. Oneglia as the 
Vice Chairman of O&G.  





 In addition, the use of the proportionate method of accounting here instead of the 
equity method is highly questionable in this situation as the firm owns less than 50% of 
the JV. This leads to decreased disclosures regarding the JV as well as no quarterly 
earnings data given from this JV. 








Conclusion: 


In light of our concerns regarding lackluster free-cash-flow generation, outsized growth in 
unapproved change orders/claims and a declining deferred revenue balance, we find the current 
stock price highly egregious with default risk on the horizon. Furthermore, we see added risk 
regarding the company’s limited disclosure regarding its joint ventures. Accordingly, we are 
initiating coverage on Tutor Perini a sub-target price of $5.
