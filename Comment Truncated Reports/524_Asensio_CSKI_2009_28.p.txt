More on CSKI’s Colorful Japanese Connections.


Posted on November 4, 2009 by Asensio.com


Two reports previously issued by asensio.com focused on


connections between China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI)


and two Japanese nationals. One individual, KinKin Kure, became


the owner of an entity with an early and important involvement


with CSKI, Luminus Capital Management, Ltd. No other records


were found regarding Kure’s involvement in any other investment


organization, or regarding the basis for the transaction with


Luminus. The other individual, Toshio Masuda, acquired CSKI


warrants in some manner not disclosed by CSKI. Masuda faced


fraud accusations concerning a Japanese investment scheme that he


allegedly ran.


In researching these two Japanese connections, asensio.com came


across another colorful Japanese character connected to the


arranger of CSKI’s reverse merger.


Charles Hung is the principal of American Eastern Securities, Inc.,


the firm that arranged CSKI’s reverse merger. Hung appeared on


the Japanese website of the “International Peace and Culture


Foundation” (IPCF), pictured with the foundation’s leader, Kengo


Chiba. Chiba claims to be an advisor to American Eastern.


On IPCF’s English-language website, the foundation’s goals are


described as to “help with the development of technology, publish


books, consult, invent and sell any goods on world peace and on


saving the Earth (as well as the Cosmos).”


While saving the Cosmos is an admirable goal, the association of


this foundation with the U.S. securities firm that brought CSKI to


the U.S. market seems irregular, just as KinKin Kure’s transaction


with Luminus appeared irregular.
