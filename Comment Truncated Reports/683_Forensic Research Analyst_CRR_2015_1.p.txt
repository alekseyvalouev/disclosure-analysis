Ceramic Proppant Is Going To Zero

Summary


An analysis of FracFocus indicates that there has been a secular, rather than
cyclical, shift away from ceramic proppant towards sand for oil well completions.


Only three material consumers of ceramic proppant remain in the industry today.
Industry overcapacity is thus overwhelming. Chinese and Brazilian proppant has
flooded the Bakken.


Given the secular shift, we believe that domestic ceramic proppant producers like
Carbo Ceramics no longer have sustainable business models under any oil price
environment.


An analysis of FracFocus, which is a publicly available database in which all E&Ps must
report the composition of each individual oil well completion, indicates that there has been
a secular shift away from ceramic proppant towards sand. Given that Carbo Ceramics's
(NYSE:CRR) business model relies on ceramic proppant for the vast majority of its gross
profit, we believe that CRR is at high risk of going extinct in the near term.


90%+ of ceramic proppant demand comes from the Bakken in North Dakota.


It is well known that Rosetta Resources (NASDAQ:ROSE) publicly stopped using
ceramics in the middle of 2014. Also, the market appreciates that upon acquiring Kodiak,
Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) largely stopped using ceramics on Kodiak's acreage.
ROSE and Kodiak were two of the largest consumers of ceramic proppant in 2014.


We have analyzed the well completions of the largest Bakken producers and arrived at
some shocking conclusions.


After being one of the largest consumers of ceramic proppant in the world in 2014,
Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) completely stopped using ceramic proppant in January
2015.
Statoil (NYSE:STO), another one of the largest producers in the Bakken, completely
stopped using ceramics in early February 2015.
QEP Resources (NYSE:QEP) stopped using ceramics in 2014 and has not drilled a
single ceramic well in 2015.

Newfield Exploration (NYSE:NFX) stopped using ceramics all together in January
2015.
WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) and Oasis Petroleum (NYSE:OAS) have not drilled a
ceramic well since the first quarter of 2015.


There are a handful of smaller producers still drilling the occasional well with ceramics in
the Bakken. These producers include:


Liberty Resources
Emerald Oil (NYSEMKT:EOX)
Zavanna
Triangle Petroleum (NYSEMKT:TPLM)


The only material consumers of ceramic proppant in the Bakken today are the following
three companies:


Whiting Petroleum - Ceramic proppant completions as a % of total completions are
declining significantly as WLL is completing wells with more sand
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) - the only material producer in Bakken that is actually
increasing ceramic proppant usage as of the second quarter of 2015
Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) - ceramic proppant usage has declined ~50%
quarter over quarter in the second quarter of 2015.


On Carbo Ceramics's earnings call this Thursday, it would be very helpful if management
could explain for investors which companies aside from WLL, COP, and CLR consumed
more than 20 million pounds of ceramics in the second quarter of 2015, and which
companies' management expects to consume at least a similar amount of ceramics in the
third quarter of 2015?


The data is clear. Ceramic proppant demand is not cyclically depressed; rather it is
secularly challenged. Producer data indicates that ceramic well completions are
going extinct.


Including Chinese, Russian, and Brazilian ceramics proppant, which according to our
checks is currently being sourced FOB Bakken at $0.22-0.23 per pound, total industry
capacity is somewhere between 8-10 billion pounds. Our analysis suggests that total
industry nameplate capacity is only 10-20% utilized. The data indicates that the entire
domestic ceramic proppant market could be easily serviced by the Chinese and Brazilian
ceramic producers alone.
