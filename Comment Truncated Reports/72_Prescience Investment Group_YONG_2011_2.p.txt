Yongye International: Further Evidence Calls For Regulator Scrutiny

Investors and analysts have for the past year or so have hurled accusations of fraud at
Yongye International, Inc. (NASDAQ: YONG). Its seemingly too good to be true business
model appears riddled with related party transactions and the acquisition of assets of
dubious quality from those related parties for tens of millions of dollars. In this analysis, we
present further evidence of Yongye playing fast and loose with the facts as it seeks to
present a bullish case to investors and evade auditor scrutiny. Specifically, we believe
Yongye is overstating its raw material costs by at least 50x in an effort to manage the
margins it reports on an inflated top line.


We urge the NASDAQ, the SEC, and KPMG to closely examine the evidence put forth in
the public domain in their efforts to protect public shareholders and defend the integrity of
our financial markets. (Our initial analysis can be found here.)


Yongye claims that humic acid – the supposed key ingredient of the company’s
Shengmingsu fertilizer – makes up a great part of its costs. In its response letter to an
SEC inquiry, Yongye stated (question 7), that “Humic acid accounts for over 50% of our
cost of goods sold and is derived from lignite coal. We believe that our gross margin will
show incremental improvement if we start to use our own coal in the future.”


Our research reveals that its response to the Securities and Exchange Commission is
implausible and, further, that its investment in a coal mine is not likely to produce the gross
margin improvements that the company is touting.


According to Yongye’s most recent 10-K, in 2010, the company’s cost of sales was
$94,833,834 and it sold 18,800 tons of Shengmingsu, implying an average cost of
$5,044/ton per Shengmingsu (Shengmingsu made up 97% of sales in 2010). According to
Yongye’s response to the SEC inquiry, of this amount more than half, ~$2,500/ton of
Shengminsgsu, is due to humic acid costs.


This is impossible; Yongye’s statements to the SEC simply do not add up with claims
made in its own fertilizer license filed in China and market realities. Humic and fulvic acid
(i.e. water-soluble humic acid) can be sourced for well under $1,000/metric ton (examples
here, here, here, and here). According to Yongye's own fertilizer license (here and here),
each ton of Shengmingsu requires 50 kilograms of humic acid. Thus, a ton of humic acid
is sufficient to produce roughly 20 tons of Shengmingsu.
