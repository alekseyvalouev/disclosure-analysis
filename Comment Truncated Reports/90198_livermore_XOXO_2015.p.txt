Summary


Short Ideas Tech


XO Group, owner of The Knot.com, is in the midst of a transformation that has
sparked wild growth estimates that are unrealistic.


We recommend shorting the equity of the company prior to their August 6 earnings
announcement.


We believe shares of XO Group are worth $9.89 in a best-case scenario (35%
downside).

XO Group (NYSE:XOXO) is the owner and operator of TheKnot.com, TheBump.com,
and TheNest.com. The company focuses on key transitional events in life including
Getting Married, Having a Baby, and Buying your First Place. The company is currently
undertaking a strategic transformation in order to increase growth and build a vendor
"platform". The company wants to build a platform, as platform businesses are thought
to have high growth potential and they often get much higher multiples from the market.
I previously shorted another "Platform" company called Points International (PCOM) that
had similar ambitions of a Loyalty Points trading platform only to have the stock cut in
half, as the market realized that building a platform business is not very easy. This
platform strategy was laid out by XO Group's management shortly after the new CEO,
Mike Steib, took over in March of 2014. We believe that the stock is wildly overpriced
because the current valuation already takes into account the success of this transition to
a growth-oriented platform business. We view a quick transition to growth as optimistic,
given the company's history and the fact that the wedding vendor market is highly
bifurcated.


Company History And Segments


The company was started in the late-1990s at the dawn of the internet, AOL style, by a
husband and wife team. Originally called The Knot Inc., the company built its brand
around the website TheKnot.com which focuses on weddings. The website,
TheKnot.com, is by far the largest part of XO Group's business, generating 90% of the
company's revenue. TheBump.com accounts for 9% and TheNest accounts for 1% of
the company's revenues. TheKnot.com is the largest website of its type focusing on
Weddings. I personally used TheKnot.com back in 2009 when I got married and found it
very informational, although I don't think I bought any products from their website.


As of Q1 2015, XO Group generated 73% of its revenue from online advertising. The
rest is split between Registry and Commerce, Publishing, and Merchandise (which they
are in the process of discontinuing). See below the revenue breakdown for the last four
years including their EPS per year. As you can see the company has always struggled
to make any significant net income or EPS. EPS peaked at $0.35 in 2012 and has since
fallen off to $0.02 in 2014.

To be fair the company does produce material free cash flow which is an alternative way
to value its shares. I summarize their free cash flow in the below table. As you can see
on a free cash flow per share basis, the company also peaked in 2012 and has since
fallen off.


2010 2011 2012 2013 2014


Capital Expenditures ($m) -2.9 -11.6 -2.9 -6 -5.1


Free Cashflow (FCF) ($m) 8.1 12.4 22.5 16.3 14.9


Diluted Shares 33.7 29.7 25.2 25.6 25.6


FCF / Share ($) 0.24 0.42 0.89 0.64 0.58

A majority of their revenues are generated from advertising and not other Commerce
services which are tied to their Vendor Platform. Right now XO Group is purely an online
content company with niche content specializing in weddings. Their Commerce and
Vendor Services is a small but fast growing segment that still will take several quarters
to materially contribute to the companies earnings. Unfortunately for the company their
traditional business of Publishing and Online Advertising has seen slowing growth and
they continue to struggle to generate any net margin due to the fact that high SG&A
costs are required to support their business.

Vendor Platform


XO Group wants to build a Vendor platform in order to connect brides with vendors
quickly and easily. They make money through commissions or referral fees paid by the
Vendors. The Vendors currently fall in four categories; Caterers, Venues, Bar Service,
and Rentals.


We see one main problems with a Vendor Platform like this within the Wedding Industry.

Good Vendors already have cheaper and better options for referrals. There is no reason
for a high quality Vendor to join XO Group's vendor platform. In the wedding world all
good vendors are already well booked up way out into the future and get referrals for
free from wedding planners, previous clients, and other vendors they know in the
industry. This means that there is some natural selection at play in the Vendors that
want to be a part of the Vendor Platform. The highest quality vendors are naturally not
included in the platform, leaving the slightly less favorable Vendors or outright bad
Vendors to be a part of the platform. Honestly there is little they can do to get around
this as that is how the wedding business works.


Growth And Valuation


XO Group provided the following guidance about how the transformation will positively
effect their business going forward.

Their forecasts of double-digit growth may be correct when referring to their Commerce
business, but that business needs years of growth to materially effect the overall
revenue growth. As they continue to wind down their Merchandise Business and the
Platform related revenues for Commerce are still very small, this model won't be
realized for at least a year if not a couple of years. We believe when investors start to
realize this the shares of the company will trade down towards a more realistic level
around $10 a share. The stock is currently giving the company credit for high double
digit growth, when they have showed no capacity to achieve this level of growth on a
larger scale.


We completed a DCF analysis of the company that included a 15% y-o-y growth rate for
the next five years (a rather high rate compared to historical rates and rates we believe
they can achieve in the short term) that yielded a valuation of only $9.89. Again that is a
valuation of the company using a growth rate above the most optimistic long term
growth rate the company expects, which values it at 35% below where it currently
trades. Please see our assumptions and conclusions of our valuation below.

XO Group is an excellent short opportunity right now as growth assumptions are way
out of line with the reality of the transformation they are currently undergoing. We
believe a more realistic valuation of XO Group shares is around ~$10 a share and
believe the next 2 to 3 quarters earnings reports will drive the share price towards that
figure. The company reports Q2 earnings on August 6 and we believe shorting the stock
prior to that report is wise. What XO Group is trying to do in regards to strategically
transforming its business and building a vendor platform is not an easy task. We don't
think the market is currently pricing in any margin for error for this transformation which
is good for those short the stock. The major risk to this thesis is if the company reports
accelerating growth in their Commerce segment and Vendor platform way above their
current estimates. One other minor risk to our short thesis is the company does have
cash on hand ($82m) and has historically bought back their shares and reduced their
outstanding share count.
