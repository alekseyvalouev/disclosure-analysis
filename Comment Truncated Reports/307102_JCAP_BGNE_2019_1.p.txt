No Cure


BeiGene May Be Faking 
60% of Sales
 ‣ Confidence game: BeiGene has no future, and we think 


management knows it, which explains the rapid pace of stock 
sales by management since inception. We have clear evi-
dence that the company is faking sales in order to persuade 
investors that it can develop a successful platform in China; 
we suspect management may also be skimming R&D and 
capital budgets. At best, this is a poorly managed company 
pursuing commoditized drugs, with internal controls, even in 
the context of Chinese companies, that we find to be lax. At 
worst, BeiGene executives may be robbing shareholders.


 ‣ “Golden opportunity”—for management to cash out: 
BeiGene executives keep telling investors they have a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest another round of capital in 
a native Chinese biotech company. Clearly, they see an op-
portunity, but not for investors. Top management has sold or 
registered to sell $322 mln in stock, the founder accounting 
for $189 mln of that.


 ‣ Capex: really? BeiGene owns three manufacturing facili-
ties, racking up $157 mln in net fixed assets since 2016, with 
another roughly $300 mln committed, and has paid $25 mln 
toward a fourth despite having no drugs to manufacture. Irra-
tional spending of this level in a highly regulated and corrupt 
environment like China’s is a red flag.


 ‣ Fake revenues: Our extensive interviews in China and re-
view of Chinese Tax Department financial statements indi-

cate that BeiGene has invented over $154 mln in revenues 
since Q4 2017, when it took over sales of Celgene drugs in 
China, an overstatement of 133%.


 ‣ The world’s most expensive R&D staff: Reported staff 
costs within China are about $65 mln higher than we believe 
is feasible given staff compensation standards. R&D expendi-
ture overall is eight times higher than the direct competition. 
This further strengthens our belief that the company, without 
a single drug approved in its nine-year history, is desperately 
wasteful or padding expenses.


 ‣ No special privileges: BeiGene portrays itself as a native-
son pharmaceutical company favored by regulators. In real-
ity, BeiGene stands at the back of the line for approvals, with 
other foreign companies. We interviewed Chinese regulators, 
who said that BeiGene does not enjoy the privilege of fast-
track approval that a fully Chinese firm would. We have con-
firmed with regulators that trials for BeiGene’s own drugs 
cannot be completed before the end of this year, meaning 
there will be no new BeiGene drug in the Chinese reimburse-
ment lists this year. 


 ‣ The disappearing $70 mln: A BeiGene subsidiary with no 
address or operations—and which has not been audited—
shows $69.8 mln in “costs.” We think that money was used to 
roundtrip sales.


 ‣ Suspicious acquisition: In 2018, BeiGene made a nonsen-
sical decision to purchase a building on which it already had 
a 10-year lease for R&D in Beijing, spending $38 mln. Based 
on local comparisons, that price seems to be at least $10 mln 
too much. There appears to have been zero commercial ratio-
nale, and the seller looks suspiciously like a related party.


 ‣ Nothing to invest in: BeiGene has little to show for nine 
years of operations. With no commercialized IP assets of its

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


Once upon a time, BeiGene’s founders might have thought they could establish China’s first biotech powerhouse. That idea, if it existed at all, lasted no lon-
ger than the lock-up period after IPO. Board member Donald Glazer—who is still 
with the company and $22 mln richer than he was in 2016--registered $5.9 mln in 
shares for sale on the very day lock-up ended, and, soon, co-founders Wang Xia-
odong and John Oyler followed suit. 


BeiGene is still pumping and dumping. With a chaotic, over-priced, and ineffectual 
R&D program for me-too drugs, BeiGene is trying to excite the market and prop up 
share price by posting high growth in sales of drugs on behalf of Celgene (CELG). 
But our research indicates that these sales reports are simply a lie.


BeiGene buys drugs from Celgene offshore at a steep discount and sells to a Chi-
nese distributor that has exclusive distribution rights. Market demand just doesn’t 
support the volume that BeiGene committed to when it signed with Celgene. So 
BeiGene secretly buys the drugs back from the distributor in China. Some of those 
repurchased drugs are stored, and we imagine some may be discarded. We esti-
mate that about 60% of the sales are fraudulent. The China market isn’t absorbing 
the drugs, so BeiGene is overstating its sales by about 133%.


Why should BeiGene lie about this? Because claiming a crack sales force makes 
BeiGene look like it can be a player in the Chinese drug market. That has moved 
the stock and subsequently enriched founders.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


The reality is that no one on this management team seems to have confidence in 
the company. Wang, the co-founder with real scientific chops, does not even work 
for BeiGene. He is employed by a Chinese research institute and he “consults” for 
BeiGene. John Oyler, the American co-founder, was formerly CEO of a small biotech 
called Galenea and headed the Chinese side of a contract research organization 
called Bioduro. Oyler finally struck gold: BeiGene has made him a billionaire before 
actually developing any drugs.


Faked Sales – 57% Lower Than Reported
In its eagerness to win distribution rights, BeiGene appears to have over-commit-
ted to minimum drug purchases from Celgene and now cannot unload the drugs. 
That is why, we believe, BeiGene is faking sales. BeiGene buys from Celgene off-
shore, sells to the Chinese distributor then buys the drugs back from that distribu-
tor.


We are confident that BeiGene is lying about its sales, because we have inter-
viewed Chinese distributors and hospitals who buy the drugs, all of which provided 
estimates of Celgene drug sales that are far below what the company claims. We 
then reviewed financial statements of BeiGene’s operating companies in China and 
found evidence of round-tripping that leads us to our revenue estimate.


Stuck with unsellable product
We interviewed executives of BeiGene’s master distributor and of two Tier 2 dis-
tributors. We also interviewed 15 former salespeople for BeiGene and competing 
drug companies, two former BeiGene executives, two pharmaceutical executives

familiar with the company, director of a company that conducts clinical trials on 
behalf of BeiGene, and 10 oncologists at major cancer hospitals in Tier 1-2 cities, 
plus a handful of Chinese regulators and the sales director of a large state-owned 
pharmaceutical company. All these interviews provided a clear picture of BeiGene’s 
operations: the drugs are not actually selling well in the market.


For Q1 2019, BeiGene reported spectacular, 147% sales growth for the Celgene 
drugs. Distributors selling the drugs beg to differ. All said that sales have been flat 
or down in Q1 and H1 2019 compared with the same periods in 2018. 


Distributors of the drugs BeiGene sells in China on behalf of Celgene estimated for 
us sales of the drugs in 2017, 2018, and Q1 2019. They said:


 ‣ Sales have been flat or down in Q1 and H1 2019 compared with the 147% 
growth reported by BeiGene. 


 ‣ BeiGene claims it sold $130.9 mln in Celgene drugs in 2018. Our interviews 
indicate that actual sales—including $42.7 mln in sales to themselves--were 
in the range of $90-100 mln or lower by 24-32%. 


 ‣ In the four months from its acquisition of the Celgene Shanghai company 
to the end of 2017, BeiGene reported that it sold $24.4 mln. Our checks with 
distributors and former sales indicate it was $14 mln at most. 


“Only Tier 1 city top hospitals will buy these medicines,” said a sales executive of a 
Chinese distributor. “This year, sales are doing poorly.”


“This year, the Celgene products won’t have much growth,” a sales executive with 
the large SOE pharmaceutical distributor Sinopharm told us. “Celgene products 
don’t have an advantage over domestic products. The efficacy is the same, but the 
price of imported drugs is much higher. That is their disadvantage.” 


“Revlimid sales rose a bit in 2018. Abraxane was flat. Vidaza was up a bit--after all, 
sales are very low,” said a sales representative in charge of Celgene drug sales for a 
large Chinese distributor. Sales this year, the rep said, are flat.


“2019 looks pretty poor,” said another.


Our survey of cancer doctors in 10 major hospitals around China supports our view 
that Celgene drug sales to patients in China are lower than BeiGene has stated and 
are growing more slowly. Sales are limited to the major hospitals in Tier 1 and a 
few Tier 2 cities, where consumers can afford the higher-priced drugs. In the lower-
tier cities, doctors believe domestic drugs, costing as much as 80% less than their

10%, while in lower-tier cities, we do not see potential for much growth at all. 


Qualitative responses 
Does your patient’s ability to pay impact what you prescribe?


All 10 doctors said yes and said they give the patients a choice, but most patients 
choose the cheapest option. Cheaper domestic drugs are a challenge for Celgene 
product growth in China. Comments:

“Revlimid is an imported product and costs ¥21,000 for a course of treat-
ment. 80 -90% of patients will choose a domestic product like Anxian, 
which costs ¥5,300 per treatment and is free for the fourth purchase. Qilu 
Pharma's product has just launched and is only ¥3,000.” - Grade 3 General 
Hospital Tier 1 North China


“If you use Xian Janssen’s Velcade and Revlimid at the same time, you can 
only get reimbursed for one of them. So, patients will buy Velcade and then 
go to a pharmacy to buy a domestic substitute for Revlimid. Patients can 
accept costs up to ¥15,000 per treatment cycle.” - Grade 3 General Hospital

How do Celgene products compare with those of competitors? 


Eight doctors said that Celgene products were no better than domestic products, 
and two said they have superior efficacy with fewer side effects.

not any better than the domestic products from Chiatai Tianqing and Bei-
jing SL Pharmaceuticals” - Grade 3 General Hospital Tier 2 North China

natives to choose from, like CPSC, Jiangsu Hengrui, Qilu Pharmaceutical, 
Yangzi River Pharmaceutical, Jiangsu Kanghe Biopharma. Each manufac-
turer has similar efficacy. As a doctor, you cannot be superstitious and only 
use Western medicine. Also, CPSC is in this province, it has a good name 
and is better priced. We also use Luye Pharma cancer drugs.“ Grade 3 Gen-
eral Hospital Tier 2 North China


We have identified three round-tripping strategies that allow BeiGene to bury the 
overstated sales in company accounts:


Faking strategy 1: Buying own drugs
BeiGene has a shell company in Guangzhou with a fake address and no operations 
but $70 mln in 2018 costs. The “costs” mean that money can be funneled into Cel-
gene drug purchases.


Established July 11, 2017, BeiGene Guangzhou is described by BeiGene as a “medical 
and pharmaceutical research company.” But we visited its registered address and 
discovered that no such company resides at the address—and in fact, the address 
does not even exist; there is no No. 333 on the street where BeiGene Guangzhou is 
registered. The company’s annual report filed with the State Administration of In-
dustry and Commerce (SAIC) reports zero employees. Importantly, BeiGene Guang-
zhou was not audited in 2017 or before the Hong Kong listing in 2018.1


Although there is no operating company at BeiGene Guangzhou’s registered ad-
dress and no staff, the company shows massive costs. We obtained statutory fi-
nancial statements for BeiGene Guangzhou through Chinese attorneys. In 2018,

September 5, 2019


BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


BeiGene Guangzhou reported no revenue but lost ¥480 mln ($69.8 mln). 


The shell company was established in July 2017 but had no activity until 2018, 
when it was made the 100% owner of a company then called Huajian Pharma-
ceutical, the only BeiGene subsidiary that is licensed to buy and sell drugs. All of 
BeiGene’s sales of the Celgene drugs go through an exclusive Chinese distribu-
tor, and until it acquired Huajian, BeiGene had no legitimate way to buy the drugs 
back. In China’s highly regulated environment, companies need a special distribu-
tion license to buy and sell drugs. Huajian provided that. 


Huajian had been acquired from two individuals for $612,000 in cash in September 
2018 and renamed BeiGene Pharmaceutical Guangzhou (BPG). BeiGene reported 
that it valued BPG only for its license to buy and sell pharmaceuticals and classi-
fied it as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.


Curiously, the registered capital of this shell parent was raised from $200,000 to 
$15.8 mln on June 11, 2018, to $50 mln on September 24, 2018, and to $90 mln on 
December 27, 2018. If you don’t have revenue, you need capital to buy things. Each 
one of these increases occurred just before the end of a quarter and would have 
provided the company with enough capital to purchase inventory.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


So, using money from its shell parent, BPG buys Celgene drugs that have been re-
corded as “sold.” We interviewed employees of the company, who confirmed to us that 
Huajian buys Celgene drugs from the Chinese distributor and holds Celgene inventory.


Faking strategy 2: company acquisition
Before it was even acquired, BPG seems to have bought around $25 mln in Celgene 
drugs--without paying, a conclusion we draw from the company’s statutory ac-
counts. BeiGene then bought the company and appears to have extended an inter-
company loan to allow BPG to pay the bill—without anyone having to report debt. 
Evidence comes both from interviews and from the company accounts.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


Accounts show that, at the end of 2018, BPG had an outstanding loan of ¥205 mln. 
BPG’s immediate parent company, BeiGene Guangzhou, extended a loan of ¥200 
mln, likely to BPG. This loan is not disclosed by BeiGene Ltd. in its U.S. or Hong 
Kong reports. Meanwhile, BPG reports ¥175 mln ($25.4 mln) of “other non-current 
assets.” Based on our interviews with BPG staff and with the Chinese distributor 
of Celgene drugs, we think the “other non-current assets” are Celgene product and 
that BPG may have chosen to characterize the inventory as “non-current” to reflect 
the fact that the company has no means of disposing of it in the near future. 


“Company inventory includes some frequently used drug products, mostly for hos-
pitals, including some generic drugs, new drugs, and some Celgene drugs,” a per-
son close to BPG told us. We also confirmed with a Chinese drug distributor famil-
iar with BPG that BPG buys Celgene inventory. Company accounts obtained from 
the China Finance Department show that the “non-current assets” remained on the 
books at the end of 2018.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


Given that the Celgene drugs are 1) perishable and 2) falling rapidly in price, hold-
ing inventory does not make commercial sense. BeiGene could have passed off this 
transaction to auditors as an "Other Non-Current Asset" of $25.2 mln and folded 
it into the year’s $40.2 mln increase, which it described as “primarily related to 
prepayments for acquiring long-term assets” (page 131, Hong Kong 2018 Annual 
Report, page 104, 2018 10-K).


BPG changed its name three times in six months, and we believe this maneuver 
may have been undertaken to trick auditors into thinking that the purchaser of 
Celgene product is different from the company BeiGene acquired. Until February 
26, 2018, BPG was called Guangdong Jianbang Pharmaceutical.2 Jianbang then 
changed its name to Huajian Pharmaceuticals.3 It then again changed names on 
July 12 to Beiji Shenzhou,4 which in Chinese is a homonym for the current name, 
BeiGene Pharmaceuticals Guangzhou; in Chinese script, only one character differs. 
That name difference could have allowed the company to register the loan without 
discovery by auditors.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


When BeiGene reported the acquisition, it stated:


“On September 21, 2018, BeiGene (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. ("BeiGene Guang-
zhou") acquired 100% of the equity interests of Baiji Shenzhou (Guangzhou) 
Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huajian Pharmaceuticals Co., 
Ltd.), which subsequently changed its name to BeiGene Pharmaceuticals 
(Guangzhou) Co., Ltd., a pharmaceutical distribution company, for total 
cash consideration of $612,000 including transaction costs of $59,000. The 
acquisition was concentrated in a single identifiable asset, a drug distribu-
tion license, and thus the Company has concluded that the transaction is an 
asset acquisition as it does not meet the accounting definition of a business 
combination. The total cost was allocated to the drug distribution license 
and corresponding deferred tax liability, resulting in a $816,000 intangible 
asset for the license and a deferred tax liability of $204,000.” 


The transaction price of $612,000 is a huge mismatch with the $90 mln later in-
jected into BPG’s immediate parent company. But BPG has not been greatly ex-
panded, nor do any other companies sit under this corporate parent. Why would so 
much capital be required?


When we visited the offices of BPG in Guangzhou in June 2019, staff said the name 
of the company prior to acquisition was “Guangdong Jianbang Pharmaceutical,” a 
name never mentioned in BeiGene disclosures but that was the legal name until 
February 2018. Why change the name unless it was to fool auditors?

Faking strategy 3: “we subsequently acquired inventory”
BeiGene’s acquisition of Celgene Shanghai also seems to have been a way to round 
trip sales of Celgene drugs. We believe that BeiGene may have used the acquisition 
as a smokescreen to buy $17.7 mln of Celgene drugs and pretend they were sold to 
external customers.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


Those drugs, we believe, based on our interviews, ended up in BeiGene’s Suzhou 
subsidiary. BeiGene used a local auditor for that company, BeiGene Suzhou: Zhon-
ghui Certified Public Accountants LLP, separate from E&Y Hua Ming, which audits 
the group.5 Given the material size of BeiGene Suzhou, this is irregular. 


BeiGene is now claiming huge sales of the Celgene drugs. But on acquisition, 
BeiGene valued the distribution rights it obtained from Celgene at a mere $7.5 mln 
over 10 years.6 


BeiGene acquired Celgene Shanghai for $28.1 mln, of which just $4.5 mln was paid 
in cash and the rest in a discount on share purchases by Celgene. 


 ‣ In its Hong Kong listing documents, BeiGene claims that it “subsequently” 
paid Celgene $17.7 million for inventory--something Celgene never men-
tioned. The sale document for this acquisition was never made public. 


 ‣ The disclosure is vague as to where the inventory was at the time. The com-
pany implies that it acquired inventory in the Shanghai company. But we 
know Celgene Shanghai did not have inventory. If the purchase was made 
from Celgene or from the Chinese distributor, it would probably have been 
booked as a sale.


5  See Hong Kong listing documents page 115


6  “Product distribution rights consist of distribution rights on the approved cancer therapies licensed 
from Celgene, ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID®, and VIDAZA®, and its investigational agent CC-122 acquired 
as part of the Celgene transaction. The Company is amortizing the product distribution rights over a 
period of 10 years.The trading license represents the Guangzhou drug distribution license acquired 
on September 21, 2018. The Company is amortizing the drug distribution trading license over the 
remainder of the license term through February 2020.”

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


 ‣ We think BeiGene must have lied about acquiring $25 mln in cash from the 
subsidiary. We reviewed Celgene Shanghai’s 2016-18 financial statements, 
and the company did not and could not have had that cash. Why lie about 
it? Because that lie could have papered over the inventory purchase—the 
balance sheet would show no change, so it would have looked like BeiGene 
acquired cash and used the cash for inventory. Actually, BeiGene could easily 
dip into its R&D or clinical trials budget to buy the drugs.


 ‣ The inventory ended up in BeiGene’s Suzhou subsidiary, according to the 
accounts and our interviews. Recorded inventory in BeiGene Suzhou at the 
end of 2018 was $15.9 mln. As Beigene reported in the 2018 10K “The Com-
pany’s inventory balance of $16,242 and $10,930 as of December 31, 2018 
and 2017, respectively, consisted entirely of finished goods product purchased 
from Celgene for distribution in the PRC.” (Page F29 2018 10k) Based on our 
interviews, we have a high degree of confidence that the inventory held by 
BeiGene Suzhou is Celgene product. That means it has to have been repur-
chased from the Chinese distributor within China.


The undisclosed distributor
All of this round tripping is made possible by a massive commercial relationship 
that BeiGene has failed to mention to its investors. Due to Chinese regulations, 
BeiGene’s commercial operations are almost entirely outsourced to a large, state-
owned pharmaceutical distributor called China Resources Pharmaceutical Co. (CRP). 
Chinese industry news reports say that, following BeiGene’s acquisition of Celgene 
China operations on August 31, 2017, BeiGene awarded distribution rights to CRP,

on November 10, 2017.7 All BeiGene sales of Celgene products are through CRP, 
according to CRP executives. This means that all of BeiGene’s revenues from Cel-
gene drugs should be booked when BeiGene sells them to CRP offshore. There is no 
good reason for BeiGene then to re-acquire $49 mln in inventory of Celgene drugs 
within China.


The sales process works like this: outside of China, BeiGene purchases Celgene 
drugs and then exports them to CRP in China. CRP is the legal owner of the Cel-
gene drugs, which are held in a CRP warehouse in a bonded zone. BeiGene sales-
people visit hospitals or hold seminars and persuade doctors to order the drugs 
from CRP, which then makes delivery from its own warehouse. So, what possible 
excuse could BeiGene have for holding Celgene drugs in its own inventory? 


We asked BeiGene current and former clinical staff about use of Celgene drugs in 
trials. An overseas executive told us that the Celgene drugs are used in combina-
tion studies outside of China. But executives in China told us that that Celgene 
drugs are not used in combination trials of BeiGene drugs within China. BeiGene

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


should not hold ANY Celgene drugs in China. We think that BeiGene may be strug-
gling over purchase commitments to Celgene. The company may end up buying 
more from Celgene than CRP can sell. So BeiGene buys back the drugs in China 
and stores them.


BeiGene Suzhou could easily hide a transaction of the magnitude we suspect. The 
company is a pharmaceutical manufacturer with a lot of operating and capital ex-
penses, and accounts payable have risen substantially. On its income statement, the 
Suzhou company in 2018 shows an amazing $44 mln in “administrative expenses,” 
up from just $6.7 mln in 2017. There is no operational reason for this manufactur-
ing company of 115 staff to have expenses that high. Suzhou could conceivably use 
this expense line to hide purchases of the Celgene drugs, perhaps through bundled 
R&D contracts.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


The first time that BeiGene disclosed a minimum purchase requirement was on 
page F-45 of the 2018 10-K, with the following single statement: “As of December 
31, 2018, purchase obligations amounted to $9.7 million related to minimum pur-
chase requirements for finished goods inventory purchased from Celgene.” That 
requirement suddenly looked very high in the Q2 2019 report. BeiGene made the 
following startling disclosure: "As of June 30, 2019, the Company had purchase 
commitments amounting to $134,897 [note: numbers are in thousands, so this is 
$134 mln] related to minimum purchase requirements for inventory purchased 
from Celgene and contract manufacturing organizations." Given the high mark-
ups that BeiGene’s distributor is able to apply in China, this is a huge quantity of 
drugs.


Did BGNE commit itself to minimum purchases with Celgene to get the Celgene 
distribution license deal on the cheap, and now is finding it cannot sell all the Cel-
gene drugs it is required to buy?


Exaggerated Margins Confirm Inflated Revenue
When a company fakes its sales, margins are often the tell. During the period when 
BeiGene took over sales and drugs entered China’s reimbursement lists, negotiated 
prices for Celgene products have fallen between 37% and 63%, yet the company 
claims margins fell by only 8 points. We estimate, based on the sales mix reported 
by the company and discounted prices we have confirmed in the market margins 
should have fallen by 21 points. This provides further confirmation that Beigene’s 
sales reports are implausible. 


BeiGene claims gross margins on Celgene product sales were 81% in the first 
quarter of sales, Q4 2017, and fell to 73% in Q1 2019. But that is very unlikely. Our 
interviews and gazetted prices of public tenders to supply hospitals with drugs in-
dicate that Revlimid’s price fell 63% from Q1 2018, Vidaza 47% from Q4 2018, and

Abraxane 37% from Q1 2019. Margins would necessarily have fallen to 60% based 
on these price declines and the reported product mix of Beigene. 


These price discounts imply that sales volumes had to double in 2018 just to make 
up for the price decline, and volume had to increase fourfold to have achieved the 
sales revenue claimed by BeiGene. Our interviews with BeiGene’s distributor, with 
former salespeople for BeiGene, and with eight cancer hospitals in China indicate 
that this is not true.

Where has the money gone, really?
We believe that the faked Celgene sales are just the provable tip of an iceberg of 
fraud at BeiGene. The company has engaged in highly questionable spending on 
physical plant, on an acquisition in Beijing, and on massive external R&D.


BeiGene claimed losses in Switzerland of $152 mln in 2017 and $100.8 mln in 
2018 even though the company had only a small marketing presence in Switzer-
land until Q3 2018.8 It lost $47.7 mln in Australia in 2018, although the trials be-
ing conducted there are Phase 1 trials, which typically cost $1-2 mln, according to 
an executive of a company that conducts stage 1 trials for Chinese pharmaceutical 
companies outside of China.

BeiGene has raised more than $3.12 bln in capital with more than $2 bln raised 
pre-IPO. It raised $158 mln in its Nasdaq IPO and $210 mln in debt. The company 
raised $903 mln in a July 2018 Hong Kong IPO, after commitments of $276 mln 
from cornerstone investors, including the Baker Brothers. Our work on BeiGene 
leads us to believe that a large portion of the enormous sums being raised are sim-
ply being channeled out of the company.


Mysterious factories
In our experience, rapid growth in land and manufacturing assets in China is 
always a red flag. It is relatively easy in China to obtain inflated invoices for prop-
erty, plant, and equipment with which to persuade auditors that money has been 
put to work rather than simply vanished. BeiGene concerns us in this regard. Dur-
ing its frenzy of financing, we have been unable to find any mention in the calls or 
“Use of Proceeds” disclosures that it planned to build manufacturing capacity, yet 
every time the company raises money, despite having no approved drugs and hav-
ing prepaid contracts for manufacturing, BeiGene builds new facilities. 


BeiGene is currently building a large biologics facility in Guangzhou at the be-
hest of a government financing vehicle and says phase 1 will be complete in 2019. 
BeiGene Guangzhou Biologics Manufacturing will manufacture the company’s 
PD-1 antibody under development, tislelizumab. But tislelizumab has not complet-
ed clinical testing. Either the company has supreme confidence about both com-
mercialization and its ability to sell tislelizumab, or this is a reckless capex spend. 
Surely it makes more sense to wait until commercialization and known demand 
before construction, and to use a third-party contract manufacturer in the interim 
period.

BeiGene has two other manufacturing facilities: a factory in Suzhou for small-mol-
ecule drug candidates and pilot-scale biologics and a small facility in Beijing mak-
ing clinical trial materials. Additionally, the company discloses paying about $25 
mln to a third-party drug manufacturer for a facility expansion to help BeiGene 
manufacture in the future. The disclosure is as follows: 


“Represents a payment for a facility expansion under a commercial supply agree-
ment. The payment will be credited back to the Company through credits on supply 
purchases over the life of the supply agreement.” (2018 10-K, F-35)


We speculate that this payment is not actually for a factory but hides BeiGene’s 
own purchase of Celgene inventory. If it is really for a factory, BeiGene needs to 
explain why.


Now, BeiGene’s shell company in Guangzhou has purchased 10,000 sq m of land-
use rights on at a cost of ¥22.34 mln. In the Q2 report, BeiGene said: “A second 
Guangzhou land use right was acquired in May 2019 for the Company's research 
and development activities.” The local government told us that BeiGene had com-
mitted to start construction on a research base on the land in H2 2019 and would 
open the research center in 2021. Given that this company, which has no successful

R&D to date, already has a large R&D base in Beijing and that it outsources half of 
its R&D, we wonder about the need for such a facility.


No Approved Drugs: Black hole for money
One of the enduring mysteries of BeiGene’s operations is why the company spends 
so much money and yet cannot commercialize a drug.


Whether in the United States or Hong Kong, BeiGene provides very little disclosure 
to explain where all this cash is going. The company discloses conducting about 50 
clinical trials around the world and employs 800 people in clinical development. In 
the 2018 results presentation, BeiGene claimed that it had a “clinical team of over 
800, with over 50% in China and remainder in US, EU, AU.”


But why? BeiGene’s former executives do not expect the drug candidates to achieve 
significant sales outside of China. The three BeiGene drug candidates, a PD-1 drug, 
a BTK drug, and a PARP inhibitor, will enter a very crowded field of competitors if 
they ever get out of the gate. 


The targets were chosen, according to scientific staff formerly with BeiGene, for 
fast approval in China. Said one senior researcher about deciding to take a job with 
BeiGene: “Maybe this would be an opportunity to open the door to ‘me-too’ drugs 
in China and then work on leading-edge drugs from overseas.”


This scientist said that BeiGene is wasting money on overseas trials. If it’s a “me-
too drug,” the manager said, it is possible to select a smaller number of trial par-
ticipants for targeted testing and complete trials faster at lower cost in China. Yet 
BeiGene is conducting extensive international trials at vast expense.


BeiGene’s nearest-term hope for a commercial drug is a BTK drug called zanubru-
tinib. If approved before the patent expires on the existing competitor, Abbvie drug 
Ibrutinib (Imbruvica), zanubrutinib will have to prove superiority in head-to-head 
trials, and that is a high bar. If not, then zanubrutinib will enter a generic market. 
It is not completely clear when Imbruvica comes off patent, given many defensive 
patent registrations by pharmaceutical companies, but by 2027, the drug is certain 
to be a generic. That means that even proving superiority would give BeiGene a 
short ramp before dropping off the patent cliff.


If it’s so valuable, why give it away?
The other most anticipated pipeline drugs are a PD-1 drug called tislelizumab and 
a PARP inhibitor called pamiparib. 


Several times, BeiGene executives have said that the company is “about to launch” 
tislelizumab, a drug that the company calls “one of our two lead products (see Q1

call page 2). But BeiGene has given away 10% of the potential future revenue for 
tislelizumab in return for a shareholder loan—which BeiGene is paying back at 7%. 


BeiGene Guangzhou Biologics is currently a 95-5% joint venture with the Guang-
zhou GET Technology Development Co (GET), an SOE investment vehicle owned by 
the Guangzhou Development Zone, set to move to 90% BeiGene and 10% GET. GET 
made a shareholder loan of ¥900 mln for a 76-month term at 7% interest. The debt 
can be converted to equity at any time before it becomes due, which would increase 
GET ownership of the JV from 5% to about 10%.


In order to get its equity share, BeiGene invested the China rights to its PD-1 anti-
body under development, tislelizumab. At a Barclay’s Global Healthcare Conference 
in March 2019, CFO Howard Liang said:


So in terms of our two lead products, zanubrutinib and tislelizumab, as you 
know these are addressing potentially large market opportunities as BTK 
inhibitors and PD-1 antibodies. . . for both of the agents, we've reported a 
very strong data in 2018. (Bloomberg transcript page 2)


According to government information in China, rights to develop and market the 
drug tislelizumab belong to a BeiGene shell company in Shanghai that was inject-
ed into the GET joint venture.9 That company was transferred to BeiGene Biologics, 
the JV manufacturing company now under construction, in November 2017.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


This has not been disclosed to the market but just loosely mentioned as "a subse-
quent contribution of one or more biologics assets." This means that BeiGene has 
given away a share of the future sales for what the company portrays as its most 
promising pipeline drug—a move that suggests low confidence that tislelizumab 
will be the blockbuster the company often claims.


The fact is, several scientists have told us that tislelizumab and pamiparib are 
well behind international competition in the development cycle. A former BeiGene 
scientific director said in a phone call that “China has around 25 PD-1 drugs” ap-
proved or in development, while the U.S. has several. We identified five PD-1 inhibi-
tors that are commercialized or close to approval in China.


The CEO of a company running clinical trials for cancer drugs said that, of 2,800 
drugs now in pre-clinical studies, there are hundreds of PD-1s. “This class is quite 
crowded now.” That means that BeiGene, he said, needs to spend more to try to find 
a way to distinguish its own drug from the pack.


Regarding the PARP inhibitor, we spoke with a scientist who was formerly an ex-
ecutive with BeiGene, who is very positive about BeiGene overall. That executive 
said that BeiGene’s PARP inhibitor is a poor drug. A biochemist who is unaffiliated 
with the company said of BeiGene’s PARP inhibitor: “There are several of them out 
there, and they’ve under-performed in every respect.”


Out-of-control R&D expense
We estimate BeiGene’s unexplained overspend on R&D within China at $65 mln in 
2018. 


Looking at expenditure on R&D staff within China seems to be the best way to 
gauge overspending, and those costs are unreasonably high. We estimate that 
BeiGene’s R&D staff costs are three times higher than what they should be, based 
on industry salary surveys and competitor comparisons. If you include share com-
pensation to R&D staff that increases to 4.5 times higher. The overspend was about

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


$65 mln in 2018, according to our calculations.


We estimate that, of the $167 mln in R&D-related staff costs, $63.8 mln were in 
the United States, based on the disclosure that 200 clinical development staff were 
in the United States in 2018 and an estimate of compensation from disclosed con-
tributions to the company 401-K plan.10 The company contributes a maximum 3% 
of compensation to U.S. employees' 401-K plan. This contribution was $455,000 in 
2017. If the average contribution was some 2% of U.S. staff compensation in 2017, 
this implies $22.8 mln U.S. staff compensation in 2017. Similarly, for 2018, a 2% 
contribution rate on $1,275,000 implies U.S. staff compensation of $63.8 mln, or an 
average U.S. employee annual wage of around $212,000 (assuming average 300 U.S. 
staff employed during 2018). 


That means that China and “Other R&D” staff costs were around $103 mln. "Other" 
includes Australia and Switzerland, where there is a maximum of 26 staff. We esti-
mate China R&D staff cost of around $96 mln in 2018, or $156,000 per China R&D 
staff member, based on 500 staff. That compares with the roughly $50,000 salary 
you would expect—already, arguably, generous. 


According to the latest Kelley Services Salary Guide for the China’s11 pharmaceuti-
cal sector, a clinical research manager earns ¥400,000/annum ($59,000). A clini-
cal research associate earns ¥150,000/annum ($22,000), an R&D director earns 
¥1.5 mln/annum ($220,000), and a research project director earns ¥600,000/an-
num ($88,000). A former research manager at BeiGene told us in a phone call that 
Chinese compensation for the company is 30% at the lower levels and 70% at the

highest level of that in the United States. He also said U.S. compensation is in line 
for the industry, not unusually high. 


Using an average of 200 research staff in China, 300 clinical development staff 
in China and Asia-Pacific, and 115 China manufacturing staff (for internal R&D 
clinical trial drugs) in 2018, and assuming an average compensation of $50,000/
annum, we come to a more realistic 2018 China R&D staff cost of around $31 mln. 
And yet the filings tell us that actual China R&D staff cost was about $96 mln--a 
difference of $65 mln. 


Within the very large 2018 $167 mln R&D staff costs, some $54.4 mln was related 
to share compensation, up from $30.6 mln the previous year. BGNE claims the 
increase in staff share compensation expense was the result of new hires and a 
higher share price, but this misses the point that 2018 R&D share compensation 
expense accounted for about one-third of total R&D compensation when the com-
pany has yet to commercialize a drug, and also came in a year when overall group 
net losses increased from a $93.1 mln to a massive $673.8 mln. We get it that there 
may be share compensation progress awards for successful clinical trials, but such 
large awards without profitable commercialization, even for new hires, while the 
losses are huge, is on a best-case scenario poor corporate governance and a sign of 
freewheeling financial controls.


BeiGene has repeatedly told the market that it has a cost advantage in China, 
whose large population yields more patients willing to participate in trials. For 
example, slide 16 in the Q2 presentation starts: “China Enables a Model to Succeed 
in an Evolving Global Environment: BeiGene is uniquely positioned to leverage the 
large commercial base.” But the company financials belie those comments.


In a presentation to the American Society of Hematology December 3, 2018, John 
Oyler said: “The majority of the cost in our industry is upfront, and you have mil-
lions of patients when you amortize that cost over millions of patients instead of 
tens of thousands of patients.” (Bloomberg transcript page 11)


BeiGene’s total internal R&D expenditure is 4.7 times that of a domestic competitor 
on a per R&D staff member cost. If you include the external R&D costs of BeiGene, 
that increase to eight times higher. 


Compare the expenses reported by Jiangsu Hengrui, which has developed a com-
petitor to BeiGene’s still-in-development BTK drug, zanubrutinib. Hengrui does not 
disclose compensation paid to its R&D staff, but it reports that the company spends 
a total of $129,457 per R&D employee. That compares with $608,000 spent in R&D 
costs per R&D employee by BeiGene internally. And it does not count a whopping 
$436 mln spent on external R&D.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


The head of a partner company to BeiGene said that the company wants to take 
more of the trials in-house. “U.S. companies are much more lean [than Chinese 
companies],” he said. “They outsource more. Chinese companies want to be verti-
cally integrated. If they could, they’d own their own [trial] sites.”


Outsourcing
One wonders how BeiGene manages to claim superior, low-cost R&D in China and 
yet outsource more than half of its R&D activities. In 2018, BeiGene discloses that 
internal R&D activities cost $243.2 mln out of a total of $679 mln. External R&D 
and clinical-stage programs cost $346.8 mln in 2018. (2018 10-K, page 99) The 
company’s long-lived assets and revenue are in the PRC, but 83% of losses are in 
“other” countries. That suggests that the R&D budget could be a vessel for trans-
ferring cash to related parties.

BeiGene Ltd.(BGNE US)


BeiGene spent a meager $7 mln on lab equipment. It is hard to fathom how a com-
pany can spend a cool $679 mln on R&D expense in 2018 and yet the amount of 
capital it spent on laboratory equipment during the same year amounted to a mea-
ger $7.04 mln ($22.64 mln minus $15.59 mln in the accounts). Not many compa-
nies break out lab equipment, but the few that do show a much higher proportion of 
equipment to R&D expense. Ampio Pharmaceuticals (AMPE) in 2018, for example, 
spent $1.1 mln on lab equipment and $6.8 mln in R&D expense. Bionano Genomics 
(BNGO) spent $4.4 mln on lab equipment in 2018 and $9.5 mln on R&D. Nutriband 
(NTRB) spent $144,585 on lab equipment out of $5 mln on R&D.


Poor controls
We were amazed to learn that the company does not account for R&D costs by re-
search program. Page 96 of the 2018 10-K contains this astonishing disclosure: “We 
do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs 
to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed 
across multiple product programs under research and development and, as such, 
are separately classified as unallocated research and development expenses.”


How will they know whether a drug is profitable? But more to the point, surely this 
will lead to massive cost overruns and cost abuses. At the very least, it can be said 
that BeiGene has very poor internal controls, and in an environment as fraught as 
the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, that is very dangerous.


Said the former chief executive of a Chinese pharmaceuticals company in a phone 
call: “If I were deeply avaricious and immoral, I’d open a research institute, be-
cause how can you ever track what’s being done?”


The Innerway acquisition
Because BeiGene’s overspending is so staggeringly big, we relegate a clearly prob-
lematic, $38 mln acquisition almost to a footnote. 


On October 4, 2018, BeiGene purchased Beijing Innerway Bio-tech Co., Ltd., the 
owner of the Company's research, development and office facility in Beijing, for 
$38.3 mln in cash, thus acquiring the building it has leased for three years. We 
think the acquisition may have been a means of slipping company funds to a 
friend. Innerway’s 2017 financial statements, before the BeiGene acquisition, show 
a mere ¥15.3 mln ($2.2 mln) in fixed assets, including buildings, with no construc-
tion under way. The land and building values for Innerway booked in the U.S. 
filings are 8x and 12x, respectively, the values booked by BeiGene in the Chinese 
2018 subsidiary financials. Although the Chinese financials may not account for 
appreciation—which has been extreme in Chinese real estate—we believe the dis-
parity suggests that BeiGene overpaid for the assets.

In late 2018, property in the area of the science park was going for ¥30,000/sq m. 
The building, according to the contract posted in BGNE’s 2015 S-1, is 6,144 sq m, 
meaning that top price, at ¥30,000 per sq m, should be $26.8 mln. Another way of 
looking at it is that BGNE paid 40 years of rent, which would have been (the high 
figure) ¥5,940,594.


Innerway was and is a biotech company that is ultimately owned, via several shell 
companies, by a Texas businessman named Pei-Hsung Hu or Thomas Hu. His ulti-
mate holding company is registered to a residential address in Plano, Texas that is 
11 miles from the home owned by BeiGene company co-founder Wang Xiaodong in 
McKinney, another Dallas suburb.12 Some of the companies registered to Hu’s ad-
dress include Stm Biotech, Oakridge Venture, Therondunn Investment, and McKin-
ney New Ventures.


Oddly, the company leasing the Changping building to BeiGene was named as Bei-
jing Xintaike Medical Device Co., Ltd.13 in the company’s S-1 filed October 16, 2015. 
The address is the same, and the owner of Xintaike is the same Hu Pei-hsung as 
for Innerway. Yet Xintaike cannot be found on any records and was not mentioned 
when BeiGene acquired Innerway. Paying rent to a dummy company could also be 
a means of conveying cash to a related party.


Innerway is an indirect shareholder in a company that shares the third floor with 
BeiGene’s Changping R&D base. The company, called Beijing CoWin Biotech,14 
tests for cancers that will respond to exactly the drugs BeiGene is working on—
a PD-1 and a PARP inhibitor. CoWin owns subsidiaries in pharmaceutical research 
and manufacturing in Beijing and Jiangsu Province. CoWin’s financials show zero 
revenue but $4.5 mln in capital investment and receivables. 


12  Hu’s address is 3600 Therondunn Ct, Plano, TX 75023 and Wang’s is 2413 Geneva Ln, McKinney, TX 
75070 according to Property Shark.

Getting in line for approvals
BeiGene claims to be favored in China without sacrificing excellence in research. 
The former is provably untrue and the latter hard to argue when BeiGene has been 
uniquely unable to commercialize a drug.


In late June, we interviewed two regulatory officials with oversight of the pharmaceu-
ticals industry in Beijing and Hebei Province. “BeiGene is a foreign company,” one said.

Whatever argument BeiGene might have had for getting a jump on competitors has 
now been mooted. Back in 2016, BeiGene hoped to be the first company in China to 
introduce a self-developed drug in any of three categories: PD-1, PARP inhibitors, 
and BTK. Now there are approved competitors, including drugs developed by Chi-
nese firms, in each category.

John Oyler has repeatedly spoken of the opportunity created by a closed Chinese 
market. At a March 7, 2017 Cowen healthcare conference, he said:


While we're a global oncology player, we're also uniquely positioned to cre-
ate value in China. We're set up as a company that can approach China as a 
local organization, and this enables us to take advantage of the structural 
features in China that are advantageous for local companies. (Bloomberg 
transcript page 1)


CFO Howard Liang told a Morgan Stanley healthcare conference in May 2018:


[W]e're a China-based company where the intention is -- the original vision 
of the founders John Oyler and Professor Xiaodong Wang was to build the 
leading biotech company in China, where there is a lot of opportunity wait-
ing as the country develops its healthcare system at the health -- the drug -- 
from clinical market develops.


Oyler echoed this sentiment in the 2018 results presentation:


“Established leadership in China inclusive global development to leverage the his-
toric opportunity that China represents” (2018 Annual Results Review and Investor 
Presentation, February 27-28, 2019, slide 5)


Market opening in China has meant that the practical issues of price and reim-
bursement levels determine market success, not the willingness of regulators to 
create market barriers to foreign drugs. That is bad news for BeiGene, which tells 
investors that the company has a “once in a lifetime” opportunity to develop drugs 
for a closed Chinese market. 


Prompted by the spiraling cost of care and by consumers’ anger over the high 
prices and low quality of drugs, Chinese regulators in late 2016 embarked on a se-
ries of industry-shifting reforms whose net effect has been to erase any advantage 
BeiGene might have had from starting its R&D operation in China.

“There’s nothing company-specific to BeiGene that I understand is driving special 
access to registration,” said the former CEO of one of China’s largest pharmaceu-
tical distribution firms in a phone call. “As for superior research overseas, I call 
bulls---.”


In 2017, China’s drug-approval process was mired in red tape, which meant that 
China had failed to provide market access to 34 cancer drugs that had been ap-
proved in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. Public outcry was assisted 
by the release of a film in 2018 called “Dying to Survive,” criticizing a system that 
refused to admit life-saving foreign drugs and yet could not produce the drugs on 
its own. Following the film, 17 foreign cancer drugs were approved.


In the first stage of attacking corruption and high costs in the pharmaceutical in-
dustry, in 2016 through 2017, regulators undertook “supply-side reform” in pharma 
distribution, effecting the exit from the market of perhaps one-third of China’s 
drug distributors and shifting market share to the dominant three SOEs.


In the next wave of regulation, from 2017 to mid-2018, regulators focused on low-
ering the cost of medicines to consumers. Strategies included:


 ‣ Banning mark-ups by hospital pharmacies


 ‣ Implementing a “two-invoice system” to limit to two the number of middle-
men—and thus mark-ups--between manufacturer and pharmacy


 ‣ Accepting data generated from clinical trials run overseas for rare or life-
threatening diseases, including cancer


 ‣ Adding 15 cancer drugs to the catalog of medication covered by public health 
insurance


 ‣ Beginning May 1, 2018, removing import tariffs on cancer drugs and reduc-
ing value-added tax from 17% to 3%.


 ‣ Reorganizing the regulatory bureaucracy and adding inspectors


The net effect has been to make a wider range of cancer drugs available but at price 
cuts of about 70%.


Insiders cashing out
Management seems to have low confidence in BeiGene, as they have been selling 
stock ever since lock-up expired. Company officers and directors have sold down a 
total of $322 million since listing with company co-founder, John Oyler, alone sell-

ing $188.5 mln in stock since listing. 


Oyler said on the Q4 2018 earnings call:


We believe that we're part of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will 
positively and fundamentally change how drugs are developed globally and 
in the future. BeiGene was created with this opportunity in mind, and it is 
indelibly imprinted in our DNA. (Bloomberg Q4 2018 call transcript, page 2)


We rarely agree with Oyler, but when he says there is a great opportunity, we have 
to concur. Only it’s an opportunity for management to cash out.


The former CMO left the company in December 2018 and cashed in more than $16 
million on her way out the door before any drug she was responsible for had even 
left the clinical trial stage for approval. Clearly, compensation and performance are 
not matched. 


BeiGene has not only failed to commercialize a drug in nine years, with massive 
capital, but the company is manifestly lying to investors. We believe this company 
is uninvestable.
