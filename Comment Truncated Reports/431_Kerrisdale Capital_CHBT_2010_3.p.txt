China-Biotics: An
Investigation of
Its Alleged Store
Base
Sep. 9, 2010 10:14 PM ET18 comments | Includes: China-B…


On August 31, China-Biotics released the addresses of its supposed store base,
in response to allegations of fraud from Citron Research. Citron asked a simple
question: if CHBT is reporting accurate financial statements in its SEC filings, it
should be able to provide the addresses to its 100+ stores, which contributed
more than 25% of revenue in Fiscal Year 2009.


After the company released its locations, a colleague and I hired local
investigators to visit a majority of the disclosed locations to determine whether
the the stores in fact exist.


We’ve published our findings on the following website: www.therealchbt.com


The company’s list of locations provided 80 locations. One of these locations is
a repetition of a previous location, leaving 79 independent locations. We
visited 43 of these locations. A China-Biotics store was found at only 2 of these
43 locations. The remainder of the addresses were supermarkets, hotels, office
buildings and empty lots. There were no CHBT stores-within-a-store or kiosks
at any of the locations.


Technically, the company's list "is a list of sample locations where you can find
[their] products." Published the day following Citron's allegations, the list has
been assumed by many to indicate addresses of the company's stores. If the
company never intended that, then it has continued to refuse providing
addresses to its 100+ stores, which appears to me to be a transparent
admittance that its 100+ stores do not actually exist.


On our website, we have included a tab that lists all of the locations for which
we have sent an investigator to, with information on:

1. whether a standalone store existed at that location
2. whether a store-within-a-store existed at that location
3. whether the company’s products were found at all at the location
4. if the product was found, where it was located.


By clicking on any given address in the stores tab, such as here, you can see
further information about what our investigators found when they inspected
the location, as well as pictures of the address and outside of the store, as well
as a picture of any China-Biotics products available at the store.


The only standalone stores that we found are essentially the same ones that
showed up when we searched for the chinese characters of the company’s
stores ("益生有益" or click here if your browser doesn't support Chinese fonts)
at http://map.baidu.com/, http://shanghai.aibang.com/, and
http://www.mapbar.com/. These search sites only yield 6-7 CHBT locations.
Many of the locations released by the company referred to supermarkets like
Tesco or Carrefour. Some of these supermarkets carried the company’s
products on their shelves. Some didn’t. None had “stores within stores”.


The conclusion, in my opinion, is simple. The company claimed to have 100+
stores. Based on our simple visits to a majority of the addresses provided by
the company, I believe that's a blatant lie.


In my opinion, their misrepresentation of their store base is one of many
pieces of false information that the company has provided in its SEC filings.


Did the Company ever specifically claim it had stores?


Yes, the company has historically claimed that it owned 100+ stores.


Here is disclosure from their 2010 10K. The company says:


“We intend to expand the sale of our retail products to the other metropolitan
cities in China through a combination of traditional distribution channels and
dedicated Shining outlets. We have a total of 111 outlets as of March 31,
2010.”


The company makes a specific distinction between “traditional distribution
channels” and “dedicated Shining outlets”. I don’t think shelf space at a Tesco
supermarket is what investors typically have in mind when they read
“dedicated Shining outlets”. Elsewhere, the company refers to its outlets as

stores. See this press release from third quarter 2010, where the company
announces the opening of “four new retail stores”. Or here, where they claim
that in 2008, they “opened 51 new Shining-branded retail outlets, bringing the
total number of stores to 60”.


Even in the press release announcing their investor day, the company
promises visitors a “tour visiting China-Biotics' retail stores”. A more accurate
statement would be a “tour visiting China-Biotics’ shelf space”.


Are the stores a material part of the company’s business?


Yes, the stores have historically been a material part of the company’s alleged
business.


Here is a breakdown of the company’s alleged sales based on distributors
versus “retail outlets” for 2008, 2009 and 2010, according to its SEC
disclosure.


The company generated more than a quarter of its sales from its retail outlets
in 2009. Click here for the relevant disclosures from the 2008, 2009 and 2010
10Ks discussing the company’s share of sales from distributors, as compared
to “retail outlets”.


Note that the company doesn’t specify whether distributors refer to
distributors for only the retail operations, or for both the retail and bulk
additives operations. In the above table, we’ve given the company the benefit
of the doubt, and assumed an interpretation of the company’s SEC filings that
minimizes the company’s sales from retail outlets.


Further Fabrications in SEC Filings


The evidence that the company operates far less than 100 stores indicates
that it is also fabricating other aspects of their SEC filings, in my opinion.

First, the company, as I see it, is fabricating information about its employees.
Here is disclosure from the 10K, where the company lists 232 full-time
employees at its retail outlets.


Our investigators did not see any full-time China-Biotics employees manning
the Shining Golden Essence shelves at Carrefour. It certainly doesn’t take 232
employees to operate 6-7 retail outlets.


Second, the company has, as I see it, fabricated portions of its Management’s
Discussion & Analysis in prior SEC filings. See the following disclosure in its
2008 10K, which I've also attached here:


"Selling expenses were $6,869,109 or 16.2% of net sales for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2008 compared with $4,502,687 or 14.7% of net sales for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. The operating costs of the retail
stores are included as selling expenses. This increase in selling
expenses was primarily caused by the roll out of retail stores. As of
March 31, 2008, we had a total of 60 retail stores in operation (as of
March 31, 2007, we had 9 retail stores)."


As discussed, the company doesn’t appear to have anywhere close to 60 retail
stores.


Third, the company is fabricating its lease expense, in my opinion. The
company reported $3.4m and $3.9m of lease expense in fiscal years 2009 and
2010 (see here). After excluding the $74k of lease expense for its Pudong
facility (the company disclosed that it has no recurring lease expense for its
Qingpu facility), that leaves $3.3m and $3.8m of lease expense for its store
base.


$3.8m of lease expense for 6-7 stores would imply annual rent of $550k per
store. Small stores such as those shown here and here are more likely to incur
annual rent expense of $20k to $50k per store. As a result, I believe that the
