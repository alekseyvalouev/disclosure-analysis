On 5/16/2014 we mentioned to our premium members that there has been
recent third party promotional activity for Medijane (OTCPK:MJMD), and that
we were looking into the story for red flags regarding the characters involved
in the story.


We stated that Tobin Smith was part of the pump campaign. It's worth noting
that out of the 25 stocks Tobin has promoted (that we tracked since August
2011), the average return is negative 95%, with only two stocks showing
positive returns. This increases our confidence that MJMD will ultimately dump.
We were able to confirm that the promotional budget is being financed by a
large shareholder/shareholders of MJMD that intend to sell the stock. One
thing to keep in mind - the promotional budget is fairly sizable ($400,000 per
week).


Here is an excerpt from the disclaimer of the campaign:
