Celgene And The Chronic Disease Fund: The Next Domino To Fall?
Dec. 11, 2013 12:08 PM ET23 comments
by: Ikarian Point Research


In October we posted an article on Seeking Alpha detailing some apparently shady
dealings between the Chronic Disease Fund (CDF) and Questcor Pharmaceuticals
(QCOR). A week later, on its Q3 earnings call, QCOR announced that the, 'USAO [US
Attorney's Office] for the Southern District of New York and the Los Angeles Office of the
Securities and Exchange Commission are also participating in the ongoing investigation
by the USAO in Philadelphia,' which has been investigating the promotional practices of
QCOR since September 2012. This is no simple matter as another regulatory body, the
SEC, has begun investigating QCOR and is working in conjunction with the US Attorney
for the Southern District of New York, which, unlike the SEC pursues criminal proceedings.
The timing may be a coincidence - or not.


Banigan's Gone


Another event which occurred in the last few weeks and which we find very unlikely to be
a coincidence is that the Founder, Chairman and President of the Chronic Disease Fund,
Michael Banigan, has stepped down from his post at the CDF. Michael Banigan is no
longer on the Leadership page nor is he the Chairman or a Trustee of the Board. Even the
'Our Founders' Story' discussing Michael Banigan's personal struggles with Crohn's
Disease has been scrubbed from the website. The new Board Chairman is the Hon. Glen
M. Ashworth, a retired judge and professional arbitrator/mediator. We find it curious that
just as the CDF is receiving a large amount of scrutiny it hires a Chairman well versed in
lawsuits of all kinds. Maybe they are getting ready to deflect future legal problems.
Further, we highlight the fact that the entire CDF Board has turned over. In 2012 the Board
consisted of seven people: Michael Banigan, Al Henry, Jay Arbetter, Kenneth Brown,
Steven Block, Mike Scholten and Joel Fineberg. Not one of those people is currently on
the Board. Banigan, Henry, Arbetter, Block and Scholten had been on the board for over
five years. In our view, this is not a coincidence. The CDF has been exposed and they
appear to be covering their backs. This may potentially produce large problems for one of
the CDF's largest donors: Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).

We know that CELG works with the CDF because its major drugs Revlimid, Abraxane,
Thalomid and Pomalyst, which collectively account for ~86% of CELG sales, are covered
by the CDF. According to the 2011 CDF Audited Financials we also know that two
pharmaceutical companies account for 81% of the $215 million of donations received that
year. Based on conversations we have had with experts in the industry and directly with
CELG we believe one of these donors is CELG. Assuming CELG represents 40% of total
donations then CELG donated $86 million to the CDF in 2011 and possibly much more in
2012. If the CDF were to shut down or curtail its operations significantly it would be a big
problem for CELG because the CDF's copay assistance program drives a large proportion
of CELG's revenues.


CELG reported in its most recent 10-Q that it increased its donations to independent non-
profit organizations in the United States by $25.5 million Y/Y which accounted for 27% of
the company's $94.1 million SG&A increase Y/Y. This is a huge number - CELG is on
pace to increase its donations to US-based charities for copay assistance programs by
$100 million annually (which is an acceleration from the $72 million increase in 2012). We
also note that the $72m increase Y/Y in 2012 was a 6x acceleration from 2011 when
donations increased by just $11.7 million Y/Y. These increases are extremely important
because copays average about 10% of the cost of the purchased drug. In other words,
$100 million in increased donations to copay assistance programs like those run by the
CDF can ultimately generate $1 billion in incremental drug sales for CELG. Given that
CELG is likely to increase revenue in 2013 by about $1 billion this year and according to
Street estimates another $1 billion next year we think any meaningful change to their
ability to drive revenue through copay assistance programs will impair earnings growth.
Finally, we note that if CELG donated $86 million or more to the CDF in 2012 then such
donations likely drove as much as $860m worth of CELG's total revenues (16% of the total
and 27% of US revenues).


Companies like CELG and QCOR need these large scale copay assistance programs
because very few people can afford their high-priced drugs. What we find remarkable is
despite the fact that CELG's drugs sell for tens of thousands of dollars per year, they
continue to raise prices. The CELG 2012 10-K indicates that 24% of the company's
revenue growth that year was due to price increases ($162.2 million of increased revenue
related to price increases vs. $685.9 million of total net product revenue increase). CELG
highlighted its US price increases in the 10-K: 'the increase in price was primarily due to
price increases on Revlimid, Vidaza and Thalomid in the US market.' CELG's pricing was
actually down Y/Y in 2011 as the company had problems with Medicare: 'The decrease in
prices was primarily due to increased Medicare Part D Coverage Gap [the donut hole]

rebates resulting from the Health Care Reform Act.' We find it hard to believe that CELG
increased donations to charities like the CDF in 2012 by $72 million without expecting
some sort of revenue increase. They had a problem getting reimbursed due to changes in
Medicare laws and utilized charities like the CDF to help sell their high-priced drugs.


Financial Implications and Price Target


Without the increased utilization of copay assistance programs like those provided by the
CDF we estimate 2012 price increases for CELG would have been nil and total revenues
would have been $720 million lower ($72.0 million in increased copay can generate 10x
the sales) This compares with reported US sales growth for CELG in 2012 of $309.1
million. We believe that without the increased help of charities like the CDF, CELG's US
sales could have declined meaningfully in 2012. Incremental margins for CELG are
around 55% so lower sales of $720 million would lower EBIT by nearly $400 million (15%
lower) and EPS by $0.80 (16% lower). In other words, without help from charities like the
CDF 2012 non-GAAP EPS could have been $4.11 (up just 8% Y/Y vs. the reported $4.91
which was up 29% Y/Y). CELG is an expensive stock; it currently trades at 28x 2013E
consensus EPS estimates. Any hiccup to its growth rate could result in meaningful
multiple contraction. Assuming the CDF's activities are largely curtailed and CELG has
difficulties ramping up spend elsewhere we see 2014 revenues 10% lower than
expectations at $6.55B and EPS of $6.20 (representing growth of just 3% Y/Y) vs.
consensus expectations of $7.05 - a 12% miss. Our price target is $112 (down 34%): 18x
our $6.20 2014E EPS estimate.


Conclusion


Some critics of our analysis would say, 'Even if the CDF is shut down Celgene will simply
move their copay assistance dollars elsewhere.' While this may be true we think it is
instructive to highlight just how big the CDF is compared to the six other charities with
copay assistance funds CELG operates with. The CDF took in and spent about $200
million in 2012 on copay assistance programs. Collectively, the six other copay assistance
programs CELG works with spent about $224m, only slightly bigger than the CDF itself.
And nearly half of these expenditures come from just one charity: Patient Access Network
($108m). The rest are relatively small: CancerCare ($6.8 million for financial assistance),
The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ($46 million for copay assistance), HealthWell
Foundation ($42 million), National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD - $11 million
spent on patient services), and NeedyMeds ($10.5m in total 2012 donations). Looking at
this analysis it would stand to reason that the CDF represents about half of all the copay
assistance donation dollars CELG spends ever year.
