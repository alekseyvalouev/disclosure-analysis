CTE’s Potential Overpayments for Drilling
Equipment could exceed US$100 million.


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


SinoTech Energy Limited, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTE $2.80) buys its Lateral


Hydraulic Drilling (“LHD) rigs from Jet-Drill Well Services, LLC.


However, there is an intermediary named Dongying Luda


Petrochemical Equipment Co., Ltd., which is used for the purchases


of these units. CTE makes payments to Dongying Luda, which then


purportedly makes payments to Jet-Drill; the rigs are then delivered


to CTE.


Dongying Luda has been paid approximately $6.5 million for each


of the LHD units. We believe that significantly superior LHD units


from manufacturers with for greater experience than Jet Drill are


available in the market for less than $1 million. CTE alleges to have


purchased 20 rigs for approximately $6.5 million each.


Component specification can vary widely even for the most basic


elements of LHD rigs. For instance, the steel coil that is wrapped


around the tube that is run down the oil well to deliver the pressure


that powers the down hole drilling tools can be constructed of


different diameters, wall thickness and different qualities of


stainless steel. The pump, tank and spool specifications and the


complexity of the layout configuration materially affect the rigs’


cost and can vary widely.


Our estimate of $750,000 per LHD unit refers to a deep-well LHD


built with the highest grade material and construction standards,


and with above standard component redundancy.
