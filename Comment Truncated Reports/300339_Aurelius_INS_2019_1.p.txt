any report or information on this website to re�ect such positions or
changes in such positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius
A�liates” are not in any way associated with Aurelius Capital
Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and
any a�liates of or funds managed by the latter company.


We are short Intelligent Systems (NYSE: INS).


Relentless hype on social media has propelled shares to all-time
highs and a monster valuation of roughly 15x trailing sales and 40x
trailing EBITDA. While INS is touted as a �ntech set to disrupt the
payments space with breakthrough technology, we believe the
company is merely a glori�ed Indian outsourcing business that, like
so many other stock promotions, will leave investors chasing the
prospect of quick riches disappointed by the underlying economics
and growth prospects.


INS features a problematic cast of cronies, including the disgraced
former CEO of MiMedx, Parker “Pete” Petit, whom INS made the
“�nancial expert” of its Audit Committee, even though he orchestrated
a giant fraud at MiMedx that has thus far cost investors over $1.5
Billion in losses. Although INS claims Petit is independent, we found
undisclosed �nancial dealings between Petit and INS’ CEO Leland
Strange, who have been business partners for decades. We
discovered that Strange himself has personal entanglements with
the company’s auditor and may have also engaged in undisclosed
related party dealings related to the company’s venture capital
portfolio.


INS shares have surged from $13 to as high as $48 this year
following a March Bloomberg report that Goldman Sachs hired
CoreCard, INS’ primary operating subsidiary, to help handle payments
for its planned credit-card partnership with Apple.   Bulls have used
this headline to run wild on social media with projections of massive
near-term revenue growth leading to a $1B+ business or buyout.


This report explains in detail why we believe they company’s
prospects are dramatically over-hyped. Even if the Apple Card is a

spectacular success, the company is likely to receive far less money
than some have touted. INS is miscast as a highly-scalable software
business that, instead, is largely a bill-per-hour Indian outsourcer that
has substantial capacity constraints that inherently limit its growth
potential. Our research also found that INS operates in a processing
niche that has increasingly been commoditized and lacks the
innovative technology add-ons fueling the industry and that
dominant card processors have invested large sums to create.


As the reality of the business sets in and the promotion fades, we
believe it’s only a matter of time until the stock reverts to a valuation
that re�ects the underlying economics. If INS were to trade at 2-5x
sales, multiples typical of Indian outsourcing businesses and larger
processors, the stock would be worth roughly $5 to $12 per share
(70% downside). The mere presence of Parker Petit makes any
equity he’s involved with un-investible and, in our opinion, the
undisclosed relationships between various gatekeepers at INS
introduce additional risks and dysfunction that are simply not being
properly discounted by investors.


We therefore see substantial downside potential.


INS’ Problematic Cast of Cronies


Farcically, INS has declared Parker Petit, the “�nancial expert” of its
Audit Committee. INS’ SEC Filings claim Petit is quali�ed for this role
based on his experience “in overseeing the preparation of �nancial
statements” at public companies, which INS reiterated even after
Petit was terminated “for cause” by MiMedx in 2018.


This assertion appears particularly absurd after yesterday, when
MiMedx announced the damning results of its internal investigation
which detailed the elaborate lengths that Petit and his confederates
went to hide the pervasive malfeasance at MiMedx. MiMedx’s
�ndings include that Petit made false statements to the SEC and
Board, submitted false documents to the auditors, “purposely took
action to disregard revenue recognition rules under GAAP” and
directed “Project Snow White”, which involved a secret surveillance
system used to retaliate against whistleblowers. The company also
warns that “if Mr. Petit were to be re-hired in any management

capacity, there would be a very high risk that the Company could not
engage a new auditor or any previously engaged auditor would
resign”.

So what is Petit doing on INS’ Board and Audit Committee? We note
that at MiMedx, Petit had multiple undisclosed personal ties to
company gatekeepers he falsely championed as independent. INS
has also declared Petit as independent, even though documents
show that Petit and Strange have had undisclosed �nancial
dealings. We learned that the two have partnered together on real
estate deals in Naples as demonstrated by a 2014 corporate �ling
(below) that lists them as co-o�cers of a Florida entity named Atrix
Realty, Inc., a relationship that we have not found disclosed in INS’
SEC Filings (Petit has been on the INS board since 1996).

Documents also show that Strange was a Director at Healthdyne
Technologies, one of Petit’s old companies. Petit and Strange are
also listed as Trustees Emeritus of the Georgia Tech Foundation
along with another INS Director classi�ed as Independent, A. Russell
Chandler, who has appeared with Petit in �lings related to the GRA
Venture fund. The only other outside INS Director, a lawyer named
Philip Moise, represented INS for decades as outside counsel while
in private practice and before joining the Board.


Importantly, we also learned that Strange has undisclosed personal
ties to INS’ auditor, Nicolas Cauley, a Georgia out�t whose only
publicly traded audit client is INS. Strange and the audit engagement
partner, Ian Waller, serve as leaders of the same church according to
a book published by the church pastor in 2017, which states that
Strange and Waller helped lead a �ve-month development process
together. How can Waller independently audit INS’ �nancials while
simultaneously leading a church with the company’s CEO? We note
that the SEC requires auditors be “capable of exercising objective
and impartial judgement on all issues” and has announced
enforcement actions related to auditor independence issues

involving undisclosed personal relationships with management in
recent years.


We also found evidence of potential undisclosed related party
dealings involving Lumense, a failed gas sensor venture that both
INS and the GRA Venture fund made minority investments in. We
learned that Strange was the Chairman of Lumense and appears to
have also held a personal stake, according to online reports. But INS
never disclosed Strange’s role as Chairman of Lumense or his
apparent personal �nancial stake, and INS eventually wrote down its
entire investment in 2016.

We also note that two CFOs and the former Chairwoman of the Audit
Committee have departed INS in the last 3 years, with the latest CFO
departure occurring in January 2019.


The Recent INS Stock Promotion


INS shares have surged from $13 to as high as $48 this year
following a March Bloomberg report that Goldman Sachs hired
CoreCard, INS’ primary operating subsidiary, to help handle payments
for its planned credit-card partnership with Apple.   While Strange
appears to have largely tried to temper growth expectations, a
parade of tout pieces and social media promotion has fueled
expectations of massive near-term revenue growth leading to a $1B+
business or buyout.


Due to a signi�cant new customer (presumably Goldman), INS
doubled its revenues in 2018 to $20 million from $9 million the prior
year. Strange has cautioned about extrapolating this kind of growth
into the future and said on the March conference call he would “be
happy to scale at 25% a year, maybe higher” over the next �ve years.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 8/16


Yet online promoters have advanced notion that the business will
grow far faster, with one bull modeling that the company will
generate more than $40 million in revenues this year growing to over
$100 million in sales in 2021.


At its current valuation, INS (CoreCard) is now valued as if it’s a
highly scalable SaaS (software as a service) business with disruptive
technology. But we view CoreCard as merely a glori�ed Indian
business process outsourcing company that is unlikely to produce
anywhere near the kind of growth now baked into the stock’s current
market price.


CoreCard performs most of its services in India, where the bulk of
the company’s 430 employees reside. The company also has
operations in Romania, but this appears to be a relatively obscure
location that Romanian legal �lings state has only 8 employees.

CoreCard is typically hired to help set its clients up as processors
through a back-end system that CoreCard customizes for speci�c
card programs. Most clients pay a relatively small upfront fee to
license CoreCard’s system, with CoreCard earning the bulk of its
revenue from bill-per-hour professional services tied to the
substantial customization and ongoing con�guration work that must
be performed by CoreCard’s staff.
7/10/2019 INS: A Wolf in Pete’s Clothing - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 9/16


Our research leads us to believe that Goldman selected CoreCard
because Goldman wanted to build a customized system to conduct
processing in-house and that large processors such as First Data are
less than eager to assist with this kind of work, creating an
opportunity for CoreCard. Strange wrote in his 2019 investor letter
that “truth be told, we got ‘lucky’ when a big opportunity arose that
CoreCard was uniquely positioned to handle”. We note that Goldman
lifted out the team from Final, Inc. in 2018, this was a private card
venture that INS owned a minority stake in, a deal we speculate got
CoreCard in the door at Goldman.


Revenue Potential From Goldman Deal Is Over-Hyped


Before the Goldman deal, a key customer didn’t believe CoreCard’s
equity was even worth $20 million in total at the end of 2017. Central
National Bank (CNB), received an option to buy 5% of CoreCard for
$1 million (at an implied $20 million value for the entire company) in
2012 in exchange for becoming a processing customer and agreeing
to provide consulting expertise. CNB declined to exercise the option
before it expired worthless in December 2017, a decision that has
looked quite foolish as the company’s market cap has skyrocketed to
as high as $400 million earlier this month. But while the Goldman
deal is clearly positive for CoreCard, we doubt it’s anywhere near as
valuable as implied by the meteoric rise of INS’ share price.


Much of the online promotion is premised on the notion that
CoreCard now has an open-ended license stream and is set to earn
$1+ for each Apple credit card issued in perpetuity. This has led to
wild projections on social media of near-term cash windfalls for INS
as high $100-$200 million (example below).



https://www.fastcompany.com/40523758/goldman-sachs-buys-credit-card-startup-final

7/10/2019 INS: A Wolf in Pete’s Clothing - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 10/16


Strange explained on a conference call earlier this year that
CoreCard’s license contracts typically have tiers, where the company
can collect an additional one-time payment per customer account
over time. Our discussions with industry experts suggest that
CoreCard is unlikely to receive a one-time payment of much more
than $1 per customer account, and possible signi�cantly less. These
deals also typically contain sunset provisions, where license income
per account begins to decline and end completely after the �rst few
years, an arrangement that would further limit the aggregate amount
of money that INS could earn.


This means that even if the Apple Card is a spectacular success, INS
will likely receive far less than promoters tout. For example, if Apple
gathered a full 27 million accounts over the �rst 3 years, equal to the
entire number of American Express basic consumer cards-in-force in
the U.S., INS would likely receive no more than $27 million in
cumulative non-recurring payments ($9 million per year). Bulls have
pointed to estimates by an HSBC analyst that the Apple Card could
onboard as many as 15 million customers per year, but that report
speci�cally cautioned that take up rates would fall signi�cantly if
Apple / Goldman decides to limit the card to customers with prime
credit scores (which we expect they will). There is also reason to
doubt that Apple will get as much traction as hoped because, even
with a strong brand, it’s not easy to penetrate a saturated market like
credit cards, which is dominated by entrenched players. We note that
reviews on the bene�ts offered by the Apple Card have been
underwhelming and are informed that card launches by IKEA and
Uber, for example, both have failed to capture more than 2 million
accounts.


Furthermore, even though CoreCard has done work for other multi-
billion dollar companies for years, we calculate that INS has
recognized less than $4 million in total license revenue since
inception. In 2016 Strange stated that INS customers have “easily
recognizable names but contracts prohibit disclosure”. We learned

7/10/2019 INS: A Wolf in Pete’s Clothing - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 11/16


that a major INS customer has been Wirecard, the large German
payments company currently embroiled in scandals involving fraud
and money laundering allegations, according to multiple online
postings made by employees of both companies. But of course, the
public disclosure of Wirecard as an INS customer doesn’t have the
same promotional impact or appeal of Goldman Sachs / Apple.


CoreCard’s Business is Capacity-Constrained and Di�cult to Scale


Because many investors mistakenly view CoreCard as a highly-
scalable SaaS business, the Goldman deal has been promoted as
heralding a “Sea Change” set to unlock exponential near-term
growth. But we believe investors are overlooking the reality that
CoreCard has substantial capacity constraints that inherently limit its
ability to grow.


CoreCard relies on labor-intensive processing and con�guration work
to drive revenues. The company’s own �nancial statements show
that more than 90% of revenue over the past three years was earned
from services, as opposed to product licenses. Similar to Indian
outsourcers, INS has minimal amounts of deferred licensing revenue
because most of its fees are earned from hourly billings of its
engineers and techs.

7/10/2019 INS: A Wolf in Pete’s Clothing - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 12/16


Most of CoreCard’s recent revenue growth has been a direct product
of the substantial upfront customization and con�guration that the
company’s workers have been doing for Goldman, which is largely
non-recurring in nature. As a result, Strange said his team was “100
plus percent utilized” during 2018 and had to “slow down working”
with some customers and “politely decline” new business. Capacity
will begin to free up when CoreCard’s work for Goldman begins to
decline, but then the company will need to add new customers just
to replace the lost revenues. Strange himself explained on the May
2019 earnings call that:


“we’re still very much totally absorbed personnel-wise with the large
licensing client …we don’t have the capacity to add more large ones


[customers] and what is traditionally thought of as a pipeline”.


Fast growing SaaS businesses don’t have these kind of capacity
constraints and, conversely, tend to have virtually unlimited capacity
to sell additional licenses and scale rapidly. Yes, CoreCard can hire
more people, but Strange has repeatedly articulated a controlled-
growth philosophy and said that it takes about two years for new
hires to become productive. This puts a ceiling on INS’ revenue
growth potential, a dynamic which Strange also referenced on the
March 2019 call when he said that:


“if I had about 20 more people that had 15 years of experience using
CoreCard software, I could grow faster and there’s no magic wand that


can make that happen”.


This is exactly why we believe INS compares similarly to Indian
outsourcers such as Syntel, Wipro, and Infosys when measured on a
sales per employee basis (below). But the $46k that INS generates
per worker is only a fraction of the e�ciency of a sampling of SaaS
businesses:

CoreCard Lacks Technology to Compete with Dominant Players


INS has said it wants to grow CoreCard’s in-house processing
business where, unlike the Goldman deal, CoreCard itself becomes a
card processor for clients. Although CoreCard’s processing revenues
are very small, a mere $1.8 million in Q1 2019, they tend to be
recurring and bulls argue that CoreCard is well positioned to start
taking large clients and real market share from dominant players
such as First Data (FDC) and Total System Services (TSS). But our
research indicates that CoreCard’s capabilities are signi�cantly over-
hyped.


We spoke to an industry expert with over 15 years of experience
managing various facets of credit card programs who is deeply
familiar with the card processing and outsourcing landscape.   The
expert explained that CoreCard is technically able to do many of the
same things as others in its base processing business but the expert
was not impressed by the “overall robustness” of CoreCard’s
offering. The expert felt that CoreCard could be a good �t for smaller
retailers and loyalty/�eet card programs, but that large banks and
issuers typically avoid smaller processors like CoreCard due to
concerns about scale, integration and security and compliance
infrastructure.


The expert also explained that base processing services, where
CoreCard is relatively strong, have increasingly become
commoditized and subject to pricing pressures. Most of the value
proposition, especially for large clients, is in add-on features and
7/10/2019 INS: A Wolf in Pete’s Clothing - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 14/16


technologies that are included in a suite of processing services
provided by the larger processors. The large processors have spent
signi�cant sums of money to build or acquire these add-on
technologies, which is where most of the innovation (and margin)
exists in the industry. The expert mentioned several examples of
technologies valued by large clients that were also highlighted by a
Total System Services executive at the company’s 2018 analyst day:


Furthermore and contrary to suggestions by some bulls, First Data
remains a strategic partner of Apple’s and provides a variety of
technologies that are integral to Apple Pay.


We note that First Data is associated with more than 1,500 Patents
on Google and spent $293 million on R&D over the past two years. By
contrast, CoreCard has only a single patent we’re aware of (�led in
2006) and has spent less than $11 million over the past three years
on R&D. On the most recent conference call, Strange said the future
expiration of CoreCard’s patent is “not a concern at all” because “we
haven’t actively used that per se”.

7/10/2019 INS: A Wolf in Pete’s Clothing - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/ins-a-wolf-in-petes-clothing/ 15/16


We note that in a 2016 video, a CoreCard VP explains “our bread and
butter is the systems that have been around for 20 years” and
multiple Indian employees have complained online that CoreCard
uses outdated technology (below). After all, if CoreCard possessed
technology set to disrupt the industry, wouldn’t CNB, a consultant
and one of CoreCard’s oldest processing customers, have had
enough con�dence to exercise its option at a mere $20 million equity
valuation in 2017?


Yes, CoreCard can probably continue to grow its processing
business over time, but we are highly skeptical the company will on-
board new clients at either the pace or size currently anticipated by
many. We note that Strange stated on the May 2019 conference call
that “No, there are no other multi-million processing customers in
the pipeline” and referenced conversations with some larger
enterprises that are “not going to happen this year or probably even in
the next twelve months”.


We See Substantial Downside Potential


We view INS as largely a niche Indian outsourcing business miscast
by investors as a disruptive SaaS company. In our opinion, shares
have been propelled to highs by speculators chasing recent

sets in, we believe it’s only a matter of time until the stock reverts to
a valuation more re�ective of the underlying economics.


At its current $350 million market cap, INS trades at premium
valuation of 15x trailing revenues and 40x trailing EBITDA. If INS
were to revert to a valuation of around 2-5x trailing sales, a multiple
typical of Indian outsourcing businesses such as Syntel and Wipro
as well as larger processing companies such as First Data, the stock
would be worth roughly $5 to $12 per share (70%+ downside).


We also don’t think investors should count on spectacular
management execution. To Strange’s credit, he has not participated
in the kind of promotional theatrics we have grown accustomed to
seeing from other small cap CEOs. But evidence points to a culture
of cronyism within INS that we �nd highly problematic and unworthy
of a premium valuation. We also believe the presence of Parker Petit
and undisclosed relationships between various parties at INS
introduce additional risks and dysfunction that are simply not being
properly discounted by investors.


We therefore see substantial downside potential and are short INS.
