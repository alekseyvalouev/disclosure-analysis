TowerJazz:	Fair	Value	Of	$5	Per	Share
Top	Idea | Feb.	3,	2015	5:00	AM	ET96	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


TSEM's	Non-GAAP	EPS	is	grossly	inflated	due	to	the	exclusion	of	depreciation	as
an	expense.


Severe	and	consistent	shareholder	dilution	greatly	limits	TSEM's	future	earnings
potential.


TSEM	management	has	a	history	of	over-promising	and	under-delivering,	as	well	as
enriching	themselves	at	the	expense	of	shareholders.


The	company	has	underperformed	its	peers	for	the	past	several	years,	and	may
have	a	hard	time	maintaining	its	market	share	due	to	increasing	competitive
pressures.


Shares	are	overvalued	by	over	65%	at	the	current	share	price	level.


In	November	2014,	I	published	a	short	thesis	on	Supercom	(NASDAQ:SPCB).	At	the	time,
SPCB	was	riding	a	wave	of	positive	news,	which	helped	propel	the	stock	from	around	$4
per	share	in	late	2013	to	a	peak	price	of	$13.78	per	share	on	October	28th.	In	my	article
on	SPCB,	I	argued	that	it	was	a	tremendous	short	opportunity	because	the	company's	rich
valuation	was	not	supported	by	its	future	growth	prospects	in	the	EID	and	RFID	segment.
Since	then,	SPCB's	stock	price	has	declined	by	almost	40%.


In	many	ways,	the	situation	at	TowerJazz	(NASDAQ:TSEM)	is	similar	to	SPCB.	Like
SPCB,	TSEM	is	another	Israel-based	business	whose	shares	have	significantly
appreciated	over	the	past	year	due	to	recent	positive	events.	Over	the	past	year,	TSEM
shares	have	more	than	doubled	from	$6.26	on	January	30th,	2014	to	$15.17	per	share	on
January	30th,	2015.	This	increase	in	share	price	was	driven	by	the	Company's	recent	JV
with	Panasonic	and	a	rebound	in	growth	in	FY	2014.	The	Company	has	attracted	positive
attention	from	investors	and	research	analysts.	Many	positive	articles	on	the	Company
have	been	published	on	SA	(here	and	here).	Also,	most	research	analysts	are	very	bullish
on	TSEM	shares,	with	price	targets	significantly	above	the	current	share	price	of	$15.17.

Unfortunately	for	TSEM	longs,	TSEM	is	also	similar	to	SPCB	in	that	both	are	overhyped
stocks	with	overly	rich	valuations.	I	believe	that	TSEM	is	even	more	overvalued	than
SPCB	for	a	number	of	reasons.	First,	research	analysts	and	investors	mistakenly	believe
that	the	Company's	earnings	performance	has	been	strong	due	to	the	use	of	a	misguided
Non-GAAP	EPS	metric.	In	actuality,	the	Company's	earnings	performance	has	been
dismal	over	the	past	few	years.	TSEM's	current	definition	of	Non-GAAP	EPS	is	grossly
inflated	due	to	the	strange	exclusion	of	depreciation	expenses.	If	depreciation	is	included,
TSEM's	FY	2015	Non-GAAP	EPS	is	projected	to	be	negative.	In	addition	to	inflated	Non-
GAAP	financials,	TSEM's	business	performance	has	been	poor	compared	to	its	peers	for
the	past	several	years.	At	the	same	time,	while	earnings	have	declined,	the	Company's
fully	diluted	share	count	has	increased	by	over	58%	since	FY	2010.	Although	the	recent
rebound	in	TSEM's	business	in	FY	2014	is	a	positive,	it	is	highly	questionable	whether	the
current	growth	in	the	business	is	sustainable.	The	semiconductor	industry	is	highly
cyclical,	and	major	foundries	appear	to	be	increasing	their	presence	in	the	analog	space.
Finally,	management	has	a	history	of	over-promising	and	under-delivering,	as	well	as
enriching	themselves	at	the	expense	of	shareholders.	Due	to	all	of	these	concerns,	I
believe	that	TSEM	shares	are	overvalued	by	67%	at	the	current	share	price.


Contrary	To	Popular	Belief,	Depreciation	Is	A	Real	Expense


For	some	reason,	TSEM's	management	does	not	consider	depreciation	as	a	real	expense
for	the	business.	This	is,	to	be	frank,	simply	absurd.	In	its	Non-GAAP	financials,	the
Company	excludes	depreciation	when	calculating	adjusted	net	profit	and	adjusted	EPS.
Excluding	depreciation	expenses	from	a	foundry	is	akin	to	excluding	R&D	expenses	from
a	biotech	company.	It	simply	makes	no	logical	sense.	Foundries	typically	have	to	spend	a
significant	amount	of	capex	to	sustain	their	manufacturing	facilities	and	periodically	add
new	capacity.	This	large	investment	in	capex	is	reflected	in	the	considerable	amount	of
depreciation	that	foundries	expense	on	their	P&L	each	year.	Prior	to	discovering	TSEM,	I
had	never	seen	a	foundry	exclude	depreciation	as	an	expense.	Comparable	foundry
semiconductor	companies,	such	as	TSMC	(NYSE:TSM),	United	Microelectronics
(NYSE:UMC)	and	American	Semiconductor	(NYSE:ASX),	all	include	depreciation
expenses	in	their	Non-GAAP	financials.	TSEM	should	be	no	different.


Management	justified	their	exclusion	of	depreciation	from	Non-GAAP	financials	by	stating
the	following	during	the	Q2	2013	earnings	call:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 3/18


"...	If	you	have	a	look	how	much	it	costs	us	to	buy	a	fab	4	which	is	the	Nishiwaki	fab.
So	about	$40	million	cash	and	20	shares,	so	$60	million	took	to	purchase	the	Jazz
facility	fab	3	cost	between	$20	million	to	$30	million.	But	to	built	fab	2	cost	us	$1.5
billion.	So	actually	this	huge	cost	of	establishing	a	fab	from	scratch	fab	2,	creates	for
us	now	such	a	burden	of	accounting	of	reflecting	the	historical	expensive
investment.	So	it's	really	our	assumption	that	we	believe	we	should	show	to	the
investors,	also	the	numbers	excluding	that..."


"...we	believe	that,	we	focus	that	within	two	years	the	numbers	of	depreciation	will	go
down	to	the	level	of	the	numbers	of	the	CapEx	then	we	can	really	be	much	more
profitable	and	we	don't	need	to	show	the	non-GAAP	anymore,	because	the	GAAP
will	reflect	the	operation	efficiency..."


Basically,	management	is	stating	that	depreciation	is	excluded	because	the	Company's
current	depreciation	expense	is	artificially	inflated	due	to	its	expensive	fab	2	facility.	As	a
result	of	the	expensive	build-out	of	fab	2,	TSEM's	current	depreciation	expense	is	about
twice	as	large	as	its	ongoing	capex.	For	example,	for	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2014,	the
Company	reported	$149mm	of	depreciation	and	spent	$73mm	on	capex.	Thus,	due	to	this
large	difference,	management	feels	it	is	justified	in	excluding	depreciation	entirely	from	the
Non-GAAP	financials.	In	other	words,	because	depreciation	is	larger	than	capex,	the	most
appropriate	way	to	adjust	for	this	discrepancy	is	to	dramatically	understate	depreciation	by
excluding	it	as	an	expense.	This	is	some	pretty	backwards	logic.


Management's	assertion	that	depreciation	should	not	be	considered	as	an	expense	for	the
business	holds	no	weight.	TSEM's	depreciation	expense	over	the	past	4	years	has	been
between	$140mm	to	$200mm	per	year.	During	that	same	time	frame,	capex	has	ranged
between	$80mm	to	$120mm	per	year.	No	matter	how	one	looks	at	it,	the	Company
spends	a	significant	amount	each	year	on	maintaining	its	fabs	and	adding	capacity.
Although	TSEM's	depreciation	expense	is	larger	than	capex	today,	this	could	reverse	in
future	years	if	the	Company	is	not	fortunate	enough	to	acquire	new	capacity	at	cheap
prices.	Thus,	I	believe	that	the	entire	amount	of	the	depreciation	should	be	expensed	from
the	P&L.


The	Disconnect	Between	Non-GAAP	EPS	And	Actual	Financial	Performance


Due	to	the	exclusion	of	depreciation	as	an	expense,	TSEM's	Non-GAAP	EPS	results	are
artificially	inflated	relative	to	the	Company's	actual	performance.	To	illustrate	my	point,	I
have	included	below	a	comparison	of	TSEM's	historical	Non-GAAP	EPS	results	in	relation
7/18/2019 TowerJazz: Fair Value Of $5 Per Share - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 4/18


to	its	key	balance	sheet	and	cash	flow	metrics.	I	have	drawn	a	box	around	what	I	feel	are
the	most	relevant	metrics	to	focus	on.


As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	over	the	past	five	years,	TSEM's	overall	financial
performance	has	been	poor,	while	the	overall	analog	foundry	industry	has	grown
significantly.	From	FY	2010	to	YTD	FY	2014,	the	Company	did	not	generate	any	FCF	on	a
cumulative	basis.	In	fact,	during	that	time	frame,	cumulative	FCF	was	actually	negative,	as
the	Company	burned	through	$37mm	of	cash.	In	addition	to	this,	the	Company	has
decreased	its	net	debt	by	only	a	modest	amount	since	FY	2010.	The	only	reason	why	net
debt	decreased	rather	than	increased	is	due	to	cash	raised	from	asset	sales	and
additional	shareholder	dilution.	Speaking	of	shareholder	dilution,	TSEM	continues	to
consistently	and	severely	dilute	its	shareholder	base,	as	the	fully	diluted	share	count	has
increased	by	over	58%	since	FY	2010.


From	this	historical	financial	information,	it	is	clear	to	see	why	management's	definition	of
Non-GAAP	EPS	is	misleading.	Since	FY	2010,	Non-GAAP	EPS	has	been	meaningfully
positive	every	single	year	due	to	the	exclusion	of	depreciation.	At	the	same	time,
operating	cash	flow	has	been	negative,	and	TSEM	has	continued	to	issue	shares	and	sell
assets	in	order	to	sustain	the	business.	Thus,	the	Company's	Non-GAAP	net	profit	and
EPS	figures	are	a	poor	gauge	of	its	financial	performance.

Investors	Are	Basing	Their	Valuations	Off	of	a	Misguided	Metric


So	why	is	this	a	big	deal?	It	is	a	big	deal	because	investors	are	not	taking	depreciation
expenses	into	consideration	when	valuing	the	Company.	For	example,	research	analysts
that	cover	TSEM	are	currently	using	management's	definition	of	Non-GAAP	EPS	as	a
basis	for	their	valuation.	Consider	the	following	quote	from	Zacks	Investment	Research	in
their	latest	research	report	on	TSEM:


"...	Another	way	to	value	TSEM	is	by	looking	at	PE	multiple	versus	other	foundry
companies.	Using	the	same	group	of	companies	as	above	we	see	the	average	PE	is
17.1	times.	Were	we	to	apply	that	multiple	to	TSEM	s	estimated	2014	non-GAAP
EPS	of	$1.53;	this	would	result	in	a	valuation	of	$26..."


As	another	example,	Ascendiant	Capital	is	also	using	Non-GAAP	EPS	as	a	basis	for	their
valuation.	Consider	the	following	commentary	from	Ascendiant	in	their	latest	research
report:


"...	We	also	maintain	our	FY15	revenue	estimate	of	$1.01	billion	and	EPS	of	$2.55...
Our	$24	price	target	is	based	on	a	slight	to	the	blended	adjustment	of	TSEM's
forward	P/E	and	P/S	multiples	to	that	of	its	peer	group..."


In	addition	to	research	analysts,	contributors	on	SA	also	consider	management's	definition
of	Non-GAAP	EPS	as	a	credible	gauge	of	company	performance.	For	example,	fellow	SA
contributor	Jaret	Wilson	stated	the	following	in	his	August	2014	article:


"...	Ascendiant	Capital	Markets	covers	TowerJazz	with	a	price	target	of	$24.	They
use	some	different	assumptions	than	I	do	regarding	share	count	and	revenue,	but
end	up	with	an	EPS	number	of	$1.93	for	2015...	I	believe	their	price	target	and	EPS
numbers	are	in	the	right	ballpark..."


So,	as	these	examples	demonstrate,	management's	misguided	definition	of	Non-GAAP
EPS	is	being	used	as	a	basis	for	TSEM's	valuation.	As	a	result,	research	analyst	price
targets	for	TSEM	are	grossly	inflated.	If	research	analysts	had	used	an	acceptable
definition	of	Non-GAAP	EPS	(which	includes	depreciation	expenses),	then	EPS	would	be
negative	and	their	price	targets	would	be	much	lower.	I	will	provide	a	more	comprehensive
analysis	of	valuation	in	a	separate	section	toward	the	end	of	this	article.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 6/18


So	when	will	the	market	come	to	its	senses	and	begin	to	value	the	Company	on	a	more
reasonable	metric?	I	believe	that	this	will	occur	as	the	balance	sheet	and	cash	flow
performance	continue	to	lag	the	Non-GAAP	EPS	performance.	As	can	be	seen	by	TSEM's
historical	share	price,	the	stock	was	trading	at	a	share	price	of	under	$5	prior	to	the
announcement	of	the	Panasonic	JV.	Thus,	at	the	time,	the	market	was	assigning	a	more
reasonable	valuation	to	TSEM.	I	believe	that	the	Company	will	once	again	decline	to	a
more	reasonable	level	as	the	shine	of	the	JV	wears	off,	and	the	overall	financial
performance	continues	to	lag	Non-GAAP	EPS.


Management's	Severe	Dilution	of	Shareholders


In	addition	to	providing	inflated	Non-GAAP	financials,	TSEM	has	a	consistent	history	of
severely	diluting	its	shareholder	base.	Over	the	past	five	years,	basic	shares	outstanding
have	increased	from	19mm	in	FY	2010	to	53mm	as	of	Q3	2014.	Despite	the	sizable
increase	in	shares,	the	Company	still	has	a	large	amount	of	options,	warrants	and
convertible	debt	on	its	books.	Assuming	all	of	these	instruments	are	converted	into
shares,	research	analysts	estimate	that	the	shares	outstanding	will	further	increase	from
53mm	to	~90mm	fully	diluted	shares.


The	fact	that	the	share	count	has	consistently	increased	year-after-year	by	such	a	large
amount	is	alarming	by	itself.	Unfortunately	for	TSEM	longs,	it	gets	worse.	A	closer	look	at
the	Company's	public	filings	reveals	that	analysts	are	underestimating	the	remaining
amount	of	dilutive	instruments	on	its	books.	According	to	information	provided	on	pg.	71	of
the	Company's	FY	2013	20F,	TSEM's	fully	diluted	share	count	is	actually	~104mm.
This	is	14mm	shares,	or	16%,	higher	than	the	estimate	of	90mm	fully	diluted	shares
that	research	analysts	have	provided.	I	have	provided	my	detailed	calculation	of	the
fully	diluted	share	count	in	the	Appendix.


Even	Under	The	Most	Optimistic	Scenario,	TSEM's	Earnings	Potential	Is	Severely
Limited


The	severe	and	ongoing	dilution	of	TSEM's	shareholders	greatly	limits	the	Company's
future	earnings	potential.	To	illustrate	this	point,	I	have	included	below	my	financial
projections	for	TSEM's	business.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 7/18


The	assumptions	that	I	used	in	my	financial	projections	are	as	follows:


Revenue:	FY	2014	and	FY	2015	revenue	based	on	consensus	estimates	on	Yahoo
Finance.	FY	2017	revenue	based	on	management's	projection	that	current	capacity	of
$1.2Bn	in	revenue	will	be	fully	utilized	by	FY	2017.
Gross	Margin:	Gross	margins	to	increase	from	30%	in	FY	2014	to	37.5%	in	FY	2017
as	capacity	utilization	increases.	37.5%	gross	margin	in	FY	2017	is	generous,	given
that	the	Company's	gross	margin	has	not	exceeded	37%	over	the	past	five	years.
Adjusted	Depreciation:	I	believe	the	entire	amount	of	GAAP	depreciation	(currently
~$200mm	annually)	should	be	expensed.	As	per	management	guidance,	depreciation
eventually	declines	to	$25mm	per	quarter	by	FY	2017.
Operating	Expenses:	Assumes	operating	expenses	increase,	but	at	a	slower	rate
than	the	revenue	growth.
Interest:	Assumes	all	convertible	instruments	are	converted	into	shares.
Minority	Interest:	Represents	Panasonic's	49%	share	of	the	profits	/	losses	in	the
TPSCo	JV.
Taxes:	As	per	management	guidance,	TSEM	will	be	fully	taxed	on	profits	in	the	US
(35%	rate)	and	Japan	(36%),	while	Israel	profits	will	be	tax-free	due	to	NOLs	and
accelerated	depreciation.	Thus,	I	assume	a	blended	tax	rate	of	25%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 8/18


Fully	Diluted	Shares:	As	of	the	end	of	FY	2013,	there	were	104mm	fully	diluted
shares	outstanding.	I	have	conservatively	assumed	a	1mm	increase	in	fully	diluted
shares	per	year.


It	should	be	noted	that	I	am	using	generous	assumptions	in	my	projections.	Given	the
Company's	poor	and	inconsistent	performance,	I	believe	that	TSEM	will	struggle	to
achieve	management's	revenue	growth	targets.	Also,	gross	margins	of	37.5%	in	FY	2017
is	very	optimistic,	given	that	TSEM's	gross	margin	has	not	exceeded	37%	over	the	past
five	years.	Finally,	I	am	assuming	only	a	modest	increase	in	share	count,	which	is
conservative	given	the	Company's	heavy	dilution	of	shareholders	over	the	past	few	years.
According	to	my	projections,	FY	2014	and	FY	2015	fully	diluted	EPS	are	projected	to
be	a	loss	of	$0.58	and	$0.10,	respectively.	TSEM's	current	facilities	provide	the
company


with	$1.2Bn	of	peak	annual	revenue	capacity.	Management	believes	that	they	can	achieve
$1.2Bn	of	peak	revenue	by	FY	2017	or	FY	2018.	Thus,	I	have	also	provided	a	projection
for	FY	2017	in	order	to	illustrate	TSEM's	earnings	at	peak	utilization.	By	FY	2017,	I
project	that	the	Company	will	generate	$0.91	of	fully	diluted	EPS.	This	means	that
even	after	using	generous	assumptions,	TSEM's	fully	diluted	EPS	will	still	be	below
$1.00	at	peak	utilization!	Thus,	based	on	these	projections,	it	is	clear	to	see	that	the
massive	amount	of	dilution	over	the	past	several	years	has	greatly	limited	the	Company's
future	earnings	potential.	It	is	also	worth	keeping	in	mind	that	my	projections	for	FY	2017
assume	that	TSEM	is	able	to	meet	its	growth	targets.	Given	its	poor	performance	over	the
past	several	years,	meeting	these	targets	is	anything	but	assured.	One	final	thing	to
note	is	that	these	projections	also	demonstrate	how	investors	are	overestimating
the	profit	potential	from	the	Panasonic	JV.	Although	the	JV	provides	TSEM	with	a	lot	of
new	capacity,	over	half	of	that	capacity	is	going	to	be	filled	by	low-margin	Panasonic
products.	At	the	same	time,	the	profit	generated	from	filling	the	remaining	capacity	has	to
be	split	51%	/	49%	between	TSEM	and	Panasonic.	As	a	result,	the	overall	profit	potential
from	the	Panasonic	JV	is	limited.


Management	Has	Enriched	Themselves	At	The	Expense	Of	Shareholders


Recent	actions	by	management	suggest	that	they	are	more	concerned	about	enriching
themselves	than	creating	value	for	shareholders.	For	example,	throughout	FY	2013,
TSEM	shares	were	trading	at	a	very	depressed	price.	Included	below	is	a	5-year	stock
price	chart	for	TSEM.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 9/18


As	can	be	seen	in	the	chart	above,	in	FY	2013,	TSEM	shares	traded	at	a	price	ranging
between	$3.86	to	$8.55	per	share.	The	severe	decline	in	the	Company's	share	price	was
due	to	the	poor	performance	of	the	business.	So	what	did	management	do	in	response	to
this	poor	performance?	A	reasonable	management	team	might	have	taken	a	pay	cut	until
the	business	turned	around.	Unfortunately,	TSEM's	management	did	the	exact	opposite.
As	TSEM's	business	and	stock	price	were	floundering,	the	Company	inexplicably	adopted
a	generous	new	share	incentive	plan.	In	FY	2013,	5.4mm	options	were	granted	to	key
personnel	at	the	Company.	This	represents	over	10%	of	the	basic	shares
outstanding!	By	comparison,	it	only	granted	30K	of	options	in	FY	2012	and	788K	of
options	in	FY	2011.	Worse	yet,	these	options	were	granted	with	an	average	exercise
price	of	$4.54	per	share.	Basically,	management	decided	to	take	advantage	of	rock-
bottom	stock	prices	at	the	expense	of	shareholders,	and	issued	an	egregious	amount	of
options	to	themselves.	In	my	view,	this	act	of	greed	is	rather	appalling,	and	certainly	calls
into	question	the	integrity	of	management.	I	have	never	seen	any	credible	management
team	demonstrating	such	irresponsible	behavior.


Unfortunately,	this	is	not	just	an	isolated	incident.	In	2013,	the	board	of	directors	paid	a
performance	bonus	to	the	CEO,	despite	failing	to	obtain	approval	from	shareholders.	This
is	documented	on	pg.	61	of	TSEM's	FY	2013	20F:


"In	March	2013	and	April	2013,	the	Compensation	Committee	and	board	of
directors	approved	an	annual	performance-based	bonus	for	the	year	2012	to
the	CEO,	and	pursuant	to	the	recently	enacted	Amendment	20	to	the	Israeli
Companies	Law,	the	grant	of	said	bonus,	despite	the	failure	to	obtain
shareholders'	approval	at	the	Annual	General	Meeting	of	the	Shareholders	held	on
May	23,	2013."

Overall,	TSEM	appears	to	be	a	business	where	those	in	charge	(management,	board	of
directors,	etc.)	are	not	all	that	concerned	about	its	shareholders.	This	is,	in	my	opinion,	a
major	red	flag	and	a	reason	enough	by	itself	to	sell	shares.


A	History	of	Over-Promising	and	Under-Delivering


During	my	research	of	TSEM,	I	also	discovered	that	management	has	a	consistent	history
of	over-promising	and	under-delivering.	Provided	below	is	past	commentary	provided	by
management	regarding	their	outlook	on	the	business.	The	first	quote	is	from	TSEM's	Q4
2010	earnings	call:


"...	We	ended	the	year	with	over	450	design	wins	surpassing	the	2009	record	level	of
308	wins.	It's	important	to	note	that	it	takes	between	one	to	two	years	or	even	more
for	a	design	win	to	reach	volume	production	level.	To	illustrate,	during	2008,	we	were
at	a	quarterly	design	win	average	of	slightly	above	50.	This	was	predominantly	what
has	driven	the	2010	revenue	growth.	In	2009,	we	achieved	about	75	per	quarter,
which	will	fuel	the	2011	growth	and	in	2010	we	had	bided	an	average	of	close	to
120	design	wins	per	quarter,	which	will	fuel	the	2012-2013	growth.	Hence	we
have	a	lot	of	continued	growth	to	look	forward	to..."


Next	is	a	quote	from	the	Company's	Q3	2012	earnings	call:


"For	these	past	nine	months,	we	had	5,600	new	mask	into	our	factories,
representing	a	50%,	40%	and	20%	increase	versus	2009,	2010	and	2011
respectively.	This	gives	us	confidence	in	continued	growth	in	2013	as	a	record
number	of	prototypes	enters	high	volume	production."


The	final	quote	is	from	TSEM's	Q4	2012	earnings	call:


"...	2012	was	a	noteworthy	and	strategically	significant	year	for	the	company.	We
acquired	the	Nishiwaki	factory	with	an	understanding	of	long	term	capacity
needs	of	our	business.	This	demand	is	being	realized	and	satisfied	in	the
Nishiwaki	factory	with	the	press	released	Vishay-Siliconix	advanced
technology	transfer…and	multiple	new	Japanese	and	Korean	customer
engagements…"

7/18/2019 TowerJazz: Fair Value Of $5 Per Share - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 11/18


As	can	be	seen	from	the	quotes	above,	management	has	consistently	spoken	in	very
bullish	tones	about	the	business.	Unfortunately,	as	was	discussed	previously,	the	actual
performance	of	the	Company	has	not	matched	their	bullish	rhetoric.	To	further	illustrate	my
point,	I	have	provided	below	a	detailed	breakdown	of	TSEM's	revenue	from	FY	2010	to	FY
2014E.


From	FY	2010	to	FY	2013,	TSEM's	revenue	from	its	base	customers	(excluding	Micron)
decreased	by	28%,	from	$509mm	to	$369mm.	This	dramatic	decline	in	the	Company's
base	revenue	directly	contradict	management's	comments	in	Q4	2010	and	Q3	2012	that
growth	in	design	wins	and	new	products	would	lead	to	strong	growth	in	FY	2012	and	FY
2013.	Also,	management's	comments	in	Q4	2012	about	demand	being	realized	at	the
Nishiwaki	factory	were	puzzling.	TSEM	had	struggled	to	fill	the	Nishiwaki	factory	since
acquiring	it	in	2011.	The	Company	had	hoped	that	the	purchase	of	a	fab	in	Japan	would
lead	to	significant	engagements	with	Asian	customers.	This,	ultimately,	did	not	happen,
and	the	factory	was	closed	earlier	this	year.


As	can	be	seen	from	these	examples,	management	has	a	consistent	history	of	making
misguided	predictions.	Thus,	any	comments	by	management	about	the	future
performance	of	the	business	should	be	taken	with	a	grain	of	salt.	Recently,	management
has	indicated	that	the	current	growth	in	new	products	entering	factories	will	translate	to
strong	growth	in	FY	2015	and	FY	2016.	Although	growth	in	new	products	entering	the
Company's	factories	is	a	net	positive,	it	is	hard	to	gauge	how	new	products	wins	will
translate	into	actual	volumes	produced	and	sold.	This	was	clearly	demonstrated	by	the
poor	performance	of	the	business	in	FY	2012	and	FY	2013,	despite	strong	growth	in	new
products	and	design	wins.	The	Company	has	also	indicated	that	its	recent	Panasonic	JV
should	lead	to	strong	growth	with	Japanese	customers.	However,	management	had	stated
virtually	the	same	thing	upon	acquiring	the	Nishiwaki	fab.	Ultimately,	the	Nishiwaki	fab	did
not	lead	to	significant	growth	in	Asia,	and	the	fab	was	closed.	Thus,	it	remains	to	be	seen
whether	the	Company's	new	JV	with	Panasonic	will	lead	to	accelerated	and	sustained
growth	with	Japanese	customers.


TSEM	Has	Underperformed	the	Overall	Industry
7/18/2019 TowerJazz: Fair Value Of $5 Per Share - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 12/18


Although	TSEM's	business	has	grown	relative	to	last	year,	the	Company's	growth	over	the
past	five	years	has	lagged	the	overall	Analog	IC	industry.	Provided	below	is	a	chart	of
historical	and	projected	growth	of	Analog	IC	industry	revenue	provided	by
GlobalFoundries:


From	FY	2010	to	FY	2014,	Analog	IC	revenue	is	projected	to	increase	from	~$45Bn	to
~$55Bn.	This	represents	an	increase	of	over	20%.	By	comparison,	from	FY	2010	to	FY
2014,	TSEM's	revenue	from	its	base	customers	(excludes	Micron	&	Panasonic)	is
projected	to	decline	from	$509mm	to	$468mm.	This	implies	that	TSEM	has	actually	lost
market	share	to	competitors	over	the	past	few	years.


Unfortunately	for	TSEM,	it	appears	that	the	competitive	landscape	is	only	going	to	get
more	challenging	going	forward.	Thus,	the	recent	rebound	in	the	Company's	business	in
FY	2014	does	not	appear	to	be	sustainable.	TSEM's	management	team	has	mentioned
that	the	analog	sector	is	attractive	for	them	because	it	requires	less	capex	and	R&D
investment.	What	they	fail	to	mention	is	that	the	lower	capital	and	technology	investment
requirements	of	the	analog	business	creates	lower	barriers	to	entry	for	competitors.	Many
of	the	major	foundries	are	beginning	to	make	a	stronger	push	into	the	specialty	space.	For
example,	GlobalFoundries	is	in	the	process	of	expanding	its	300mm	Fab	7	in	Singapore
for	mixed	signal	&	analog	production.	In	2013,	UMC	converted	its	300mm	fab	in
Singapore	into	a	specialty	process	production	fab.	Finally,	TSMC	has	already	established
itself	as	a	player	in	the	analog	&	mixed	signal	space,	and	the	Company's	presence	will
likely	get	stronger	as	time	goes	on.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 13/18


It	will	be	very	difficult	for	TSEM	to	compete	successfully	against	the	major	foundries	in	the
specialty	space.	In	general,	the	major	foundries	have	more	resources	and	are	better
capitalized	than	TSEM.	Another	advantage	that	the	major	foundries	have	is	their	ability	to
convert	old	digital	facilities	into	analog	facilities.	This	greatly	reduces	their	ongoing	capital
requirements.	By	contrast,	TSEM	does	not	have	any	digital	facilities	that	it	can	convert	to
analog.	Instead,	the	Company	has	to	hope	that	it	can	keep	finding	cheap	capacity
acquisition	targets.	Thus,	TSEM	is	at	an	inherent	disadvantage	to	the	major	foundries	with
existing	capacity.	Given	TSEM's	relatively	weak	competitive	position,	it	is	highly
questionable	whether	the	Company	can	maintain	its	market	share	going	forward.	To	close
this	section,	I	have	provided	below	a	table	which	illustrates	TSEM's	poor	performance	and
weak	competitive	position	relative	to	the	major	foundries.


The	Nishiwaki	Fab	Disaster


In	June	2011,	TSEM	purchased	the	Nishiwaki	fab	from	Micron	for	~$60mm.	At	the	time,
the	deal	was	described	as	a	transformative	event	which	greatly	expanded	capacity	and
would	allow	TSEM	to	serve	a	large	pool	of	Asian	customers.	Unfortunately,	this	acquisition
turned	out	be	a	complete	failure.	When	TSEM	closed	the	facility	earlier	this	year,	I
estimate	that	it	had	lost	a	total	of	over	$100mm	from	this	acquisition.	Based	on	Company
filings,	I	estimate	that	TSEM	invested	a	total	of	~$70mm	in	capex	during	its	ownership	of
the	facility.	After	adding	the	$60mm	spent	for	the	initial	purchase,	the	Company	invested	a
total	of	$130mm	for	purchasing	and	maintaining	the	facility.	In	addition	to	this,	I	estimate
that	TSEM	achieved,	at	best,	breakeven	overall	from	operating	the	facility.	I	assume	that
7/18/2019 TowerJazz: Fair Value Of $5 Per Share - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 14/18


the	2nd	half	of	FY	2011	and	FY	2012	were	profitable	from	an	operating	perspective	due	to
strong	sales	to	Micron.	However,	after	that,	sales	to	Micron	fell	off	dramatically,	and	the
facility	was	operating	at	a	significant	loss	in	excess	of	$10mm	per	quarter.	Thus,	overall,	it
is	reasonable	to	conclude	that	TSEM	lost	at	least	$100mm	from	this	"low-cost"	capacity
addition.


Currently,	investors	believe	that	adding	capacity	from	the	Panasonic	JV	at	a	low	cost	is	a
transformative	move	for	TSEM.	However,	as	the	Nishiwaki	deal	illustrates,	adding	cheap
capacity	does	not	necessarily	translate	into	financial	gains.	Although	acquiring	cheap
capacity	is	a	positive;	if	the	Company	is	unable	to	execute	and	fill	this	capacity,	then	the
capacity	addition	will	be	a	financial	burden.	This	is	clearly	demonstrated	by	the	significant
losses	sustained	from	the	Nishiwaki	fab	after	Micron	reduced	and	eventually	stopped
purchasing	products	from	Nishiwaki.	It	appears	that	TSEM	may	once	again	run	into	the
same	problem	at	its	Panasonic	fabs	in	the	near	future.	Consider	the	following	quote	from
the	Company's	FY	2013	20F:


"Panasonic	Corporation	is	going	to	be	a	significant	customer	of	TPSC	at	least
during	its	initial	years	of	operation	and	is	expected	to	comprise	major	portion	of
its	revenue	for	at	least	the	coming	two	years.	For	these	two	years,	our	ability	to
successfully	operate	TPSC	is	essentially	dependent	on	Panasonic	Corporation
ordering	a	sufficient	number	of	wafers	and	manufacturing	services	from	TPSC...
Failure	to	receive	sufficient	amount	of	revenue	from	Panasonic	may
significantly	jeopardize	TPSC	and	our	plans	and	negatively	harm	our	financial
results"


It	appears	that	Panasonic	may	not	be	a	major	customer	of	the	JV	after	two	years.
Although	Panasonic	has	a	five-year	agreement	with	the	JV,	there	are	no	specifics
regarding	the	amount	of	volume	it	has	committed	to.	Based	on	the	quote	above,	it	appears
that	volumes	may	eventually	fall	off	in	a	similar	fashion	to	the	Micron	deal.	If	Panasonic
dramatically	reduces	its	product	purchases,	as	Micron	did	at	the	Nishiwaki	fab,	then	this
fab	will	quickly	become	a	substantial	cash	drain	on	the	business.	It	is	also	worth
mentioning	again	that	investors	are	overestimating	the	profit	potential	of	this	JV.	Over	half
of	the	capacity	of	the	JV	facilities	will	be	used	to	produce	low-margin	products	for
Panasonic.	The	remaining	capacity,	which	I	estimate	to	be	between	$200m	to	$250mm,
will	be	used	to	produce	higher-margin	products,	but	almost	half	of	the	profits	will	have	to
be	shared	with	Panasonic.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 15/18


In	summary,	the	failure	of	the	Nishiwaki	fab	illustrates	that	the	recent	Panasonic	JV	carries
significant	downside	risk.	Panasonic	appears	to	have	only	committed	to	purchasing
products	for	two	years	from	the	JV.	If	Panasonic	cuts	back	its	purchases,	then	the	JV	will
quickly	become	a	cash	drain	on	TSEM's	business.	Finally,	the	profit	potential	of	the	JV	is
limited,	given	the	fact	that	half	of	the	profits	will	be	split	with	Panasonic.	As	result,	there	is
no	guarantee	that	the	Panasonic	JV	will	create	financial	gains	for	the	Company.


Valuation


TSEM	trades	at	what	is	in	my	opinion	a	ridiculous	premium	to	the	leading	semiconductor
foundries.	Provided	below	is	a	comparable	analysis	of	TSEM's	valuation	metrics	relative	to
TSM,	UMC	and	ASX.	Valuation	multiples	for	TSM,	UMC	and	ASX	are	based	on
consensus	analyst	estimates	for	Non-GAAP	FY	2014	and	FY	2015	EPS.	It	should	be
noted	that	analyst	estimates	for	all	the	comparables	include	depreciation	expense.


TSMC,	UMC	and	ASX	are	all	currently	profitable,	and	trade	at	an	average	PE	multiple	of
14.4x	FY	2014	EPS	and	12.7x	FY	2015	EPS.	By	comparison,	TSEM's	FY	2014	and	FY
2015	PE	multiples	are	irrelevant,	given	that	EPS	is	projected	to	be	negative.	Thus,	TSEM
is	considerably	overvalued,	considering	that	the	Company	is	projected	to	lose
money	for	the	foreseeable	future.	To	further	illustrate	my	point,	consider	that	TSEM	is
projected	to	make	only	$0.91	in	FY	2017	under	very	optimistic	assumptions,	as	discussed
previously.	Based	on	this	optimistic	projection,	the	Company	is	currently	trading	at	16.6x
FY	2017	peak	earnings,	while	its	comps	are	trading	at	just	12.7x	FY	2015	EPS.	From
this	analysis,	it	is	clear	to	see	that	the	market	is	valuing	TSEM	at	an	overly	rich	valuation.


So	what	is	an	appropriate	method	to	value	TSEM?	Given	that	the	Company	is	projected	to
lose	money	over	the	next	couple	years,	I	believe	that	the	most	sensible	way	to	value
TSEM	is	to	apply	a	multiple	to	projected	FY	2017	EPS	and	then	discount	the	implied	stock
price	back	to	today.	Currently,	TSEM's	comparables	trade	at	an	average	PE	multiple	of

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 16/18


14.4x	current-year	earnings.	I	believe	that	TSEM	deserves	a	much	lower	multiple	than	its
comps	for	various	reasons.	First,	the	Company	is	in	a	weaker	competitive	position	and	is
not	as	well	capitalized	relative	to	companies	such	as	TSMC	and	UMC.	Also,	my	FY	2017
projections	are	aggressive,	given	that	the	Company	has	delivered	inconsistent	and
generally	poor	historical	results.	Finally,	management's	questionable	actions	and
continuous	dilution	of	shareholders	are	of	great	concern.	Taking	all	of	these	factors	into
consideration,	I	believe	TSEM	should	trade	at	a	discount	of	50%	to	its	comparables.	A
discount	of	50%	results	in	an	implied	valuation	multiple	of	7.2x	FY	2017	EPS.	Multiplying
$0.91	of	projected	EPS	by	7.2x	results	in	an	implied	share	price	of	$6.58	by	the	end	of	FY
2017.	Discounting	this	price	back	to	the	present	(assuming	a	discount	rate	of	10%),	I
estimate	fair	value	for	TSEM	shares	to	be	approximately	$4.95	per	share.	This
represents	a	67%	discount	to	the	current	share	price	of	$15.17	as	of	market	close	on
January	30th.


My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	note	that	I	sent	an	email	to	investor	relations.	In	this	email,	I	posed	various
questions	to	management	about	a	number	of	concerns	raised	in	this	article,	including:


Rationale	for	excluding	depreciation	from	the	Non-GAAP	financials
Aggressive	awarding	of	stock	options	in	FY	2013
Rationale	for	awarding	a	bonus	for	FY	2012	to	the	CEO	against	shareholder	wishes
Further	detail	on	Panasonic's	volume	commitment	to	the	JV
Management's	history	of	failing	to	meet	its	stated	goals
TSEM's	fully	diluted	share	count


I	have	yet	to	hear	back	from	the	Company.	If	I	receive	a	reply,	I	will	provide	an	update	in
the	comments	section	or	in	a	separate	article.


Conclusion


TSEM's	lofty	valuation	is	not	supported	by	its	current	performance	and	future	prospects.
Given	all	of	the	issues	that	I	have	outlined	in	this	article,	there	is	no	reason	why	TSEM
should	trade	at	such	a	substantial	premium	to	its	comparables.	I	believe	TSEM	is	the	best
short	opportunity	I	have	come	across	in	the	past	12	months.	Thus,	I	would	recommend
initiating	a	short	position	or	selling	shares	if	you	are	an	existing	TSEM	shareholder.


Appendix
7/18/2019 TowerJazz: Fair Value Of $5 Per Share - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2876476-towerjazz-fair-value-of-5-per-share 17/18


In	this	section,	I	will	describe	in	detail	the	manner	in	which	I	calculated	TSEM's	fully	diluted
share	count	of	104mm.	Provided	below	is	an	ownership	table	of	TSEM's	major
shareholders	provided	on	pg.	71	of	the	FY	2013	20F:


From	this	ownership	table,	I	was	able	to	calculate	the	implied	fully	diluted	share	count	for
TSEM.	The	first	step	in	calculating	TSEM's	fully	diluted	share	count	was	to	figure	out
Israel	Corp.'s	fully	diluted	share	count.	Footnote	3	in	the	table	above	is	provided	below,
and	can	be	found	on	pg.	71	of	the	20F:


"Based	on	information	verified	with	Israel	Corp.,	it	had	as	of	March	31,	2014
approximately	18	million	shares,	as	well	as	warrants	exercisable	to	acquire	1.67
million	shares	and	4	thousand	Ordinary	Shares	issuable	upon	the	exercise	of
options"


Based	on	the	information	in	this	footnote,	on	a	fully	diluted	basis,	Israel	Corp.	will	own
19.7mm	shares.	Next,	I	used	Israel	Corp.'s	fully	diluted	ownership	and	share	count	to
calculate	the	implied	fully	diluted	share	count	of	TSEM.	Provided	below	is	Footnote	2	from
the	table	above	(also	found	on	pg.	71	of	the	20F):


"Assumes	that	all	currently	outstanding	securities	to	purchase	ordinary	shares,	other
than	those	which	cannot	be	calculated	as	of	the	date	of	the	date	referred	to	above,
have	been	exercised	by	all	holders"


Thus,	the	"Percent	of	Class	Diluted"	column	represents	the	fully	diluted	ownership	of	each
major	shareholder,	assuming	the	conversion	of	all	dilutive	instruments.	By	dividing	Israel
