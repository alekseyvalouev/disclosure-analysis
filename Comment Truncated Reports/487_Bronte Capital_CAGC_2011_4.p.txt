China Agritech: How should I reply to Kevin Theiss re China
Agritech?
Forgive me a brief gloat about a successful short. 
 
China Agritech has fired its auditor after the auditor threatened to resign.  NASDAQ has suspended
the stock and there is no indication of when it will trade again. 
 
The Carlyle representative on the board (Anne Wang) has resigned and never answered any email I
sent her or any questions on this blog. 
 
The auditor firing 8K is a gem.  Ernst & Young has recommended the "initiation of an independent
investigation, in order to verify certain transactions and balances recorded on the Company’s financial
statements and records for the year ended December 31, 2010." 
 
E&Y also "orally advised the Audit Committee that it may not be able to rely on management’s
representations based on the issues identified." 
 
In other words they thought management may be lying and they thought an "independent
investigation" (meaning independent of the board) was warranted.  
 
None of this should be a surprise to any reader of this blog.  
 
I also annoyed China Agritech's management especially because of my repeated (and unsuccessful)
attempts to talk to Carlyle.  
 
This is a letter I got from their PR flack on 24 February.  How should I respond?  Note that the flack
(Kevin Theiss) says we (meaning Grayling - not China Agritech) have collected evidence that my
allegations were groundless.  
 
 


Dear Mr. Hempton, 
 
We are aware that you have published a series of blog articles to negatively comment
on China Agritech's business operations and attack the Company's credibility. It is
becoming more alarming that you have repeatedly reached out to our largest outside
shareholder. Your intention and ongoing efforts to derail our well-established, long-term
relationship with our largest shareholder has come to our full attention. If you have any
questions, concerns or comments, we welcome you to contact China Agritech’s
management directly. We will provide you with our timely answers. Lastly, we have
collected evidence that your allegations are groundless. If you continue to harass our
shareholder, we will take further legal action against you. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Kevin Theiss

PS.  Huntsworth PLC - the company that ultimately threatened to sue me on behalf of China Agritech
- is publicly listed.  Their CEO states on their website that Huntsworth "have developed a culture of
rigorous focus on margin improvement throughout the Group". Is there any business not worth doing
for a high margin?  Does this letter represent the quality of their work?
