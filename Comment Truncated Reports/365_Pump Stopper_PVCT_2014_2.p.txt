Provectus: More Concerns, Reiterate 'Strong Sell' On BTD Failure

by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


PVCT has definitively been denied its Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)
application by the FDA.


According to the May 23 call, PVCT received notice of BTD failure on Wednesday,
May 21, the same day it stated in a PR, “The FDA has not reported back to the
Company."


Was PVCT selling stock to the public last week, while shareholders did not possess
this critical BTD information that was with the company?


Why was PVCT stock halted all day Friday, May 23, when the 8K was out by 2:18
pm?


FDA letter highlights prior concerns in 4 separate communications going back to
April 2010, along with other issues.


I am reiterating my STRONG SELL rating on shares of Provectus (OTC:PVCT), as I still
believe this stock has $0 intrinsic value and the fundamentals appear to be deteriorating.


My opinion is that shares of PVCT, when unhalted, could gap down substantially, before
ultimately dribbling down to my long-term price target of $0, just like PVCT management's
last company, Imcor Pharma.

5. PVCT shareholders looking forward to an ASCO "catalyst" could be disappointed, as I
believe that is a "non-event", and I explain why below.

The Suspicious Timeline of Provectus' BTD Failure Announcement and Stock Halt


On Wednesday, May 21st, I released a report detailing how, based on changes PVCT
made to its website on May 20th at what appeared to be the 60-day BTD deadline, I
believed it was likely Provectus had already received a negative BTD decision. Later that
day, 5/21/14, Provectus issued a press release where it said:


The article alleges that the Company's oncology drug PV-10 "appears to have failed
their Breakthrough Therapy Designation." This statement is completely false. The
FDA has not reported back to the Company with respect to the Company's
application for Breakthrough Therapy Designation.


We now know that actual FDA correspondence about Provectus' BTD failure was dated
Friday, May 16th - apparently five days before I issued my first report. In my opinion, it is
troubling how Provectus has attempted to spin this.


On its May 23rd conference call, Provectus claims to have received the FDA response on
Wednesday 5/21, the same day its press release stated "The FDA has not reported
back to the Company," but appears to have withheld this information from shareholders
until it formally announced the BTD failure on 5/23. On the call, management states they
were out of the office and did not receive the FedEx from the FDA, as they were ringing
the NYSE opening bell on the 5/22.

Why was PVCT Stock Halted ALL DAY on Friday 5/23 Before a Long Weekend?


Once management released the BTD failure news, why was the stock halted? Before the
stock market opened but after the BTD failure was announced, PVCT stock was halted
the entire day of Friday before the 3-day long Memorial Day weekend. I find this very
confusing. With this extremely bad news now public, why was it necessary for PVCT stock
to be halted ALL DAY, when its 8-K with the full disclosure had been filed by 2:18 pm
EST?


FDA Letter Discloses Additional Concerns


The FDA letter is a "must-read" for any PVCT shareholder, and I believe some of the other
issues mentioned in the FDA BTD failure letter are even more concerning than the BTD
failure.


I believe the most important part of the FDA letter that all PVCT shareholders need to
focus on is this quote below direct from PVCT's BTD failure letter (emphasis mine):


preliminary clinical data do not demonstrate substantial improvement over existing
therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. This determination is based
on the paucity of data on endpoints indicative of clinical benefit"


This is a direct statement from the FDA about PV-10, based on the clinical data they've
been shown that is about as clear as I can imagine.

Furthermore, in my first report, I provided source material supporting my estimate that the
BTD response in recent years was in excess of 90% negative (refusal) by the FDA.


We also know, quoted directly from the FDA's BTD failure letter to PVCT below (emphasis
mine), that:


FDA previously communicated concerns regarding the development program and
provided advice regarding the type of data that should be systematically collected to
investigate the clinical benefit(s) of an intratumoral treatment of a subset of individual
lesions in a systemic disease (malignant melanoma), as previously discussed at
the April 8, 2010, March 7, 2011, and October 18, 2011, end-of-Phase 2
meetings and the December 16, 2013 General Guidance teleconference.


Provectus management knew well in advance - in fact 4 years ago, on April 8th, 2010 -
that the FDA had significant concerns about the data regarding PV-10 drug.


What has PVCT Been Doing Clinically the Last 3+ Years?


Remember, PVCT was a tiny penny stock trading for $0.60 per share recently. It would
have been difficult to fund Provectus' substantial cash burn with a share price of $0.54 at
the end of 2013, and may have been difficult to obtain the necessary shareholder votes to
change the company's Certificate of Incorporation. On January 15th, PVCT released a
press release hyping a Type C meeting with the FDA in December. Why now, after 4
years, with no additional clinical support?


And why did several paid research reports follow after this announcement?


The initial Small Cap Street paid research report was issued on January 21st, 2014 - just
days after the Type C meeting. Provectus still has not answered questions raised in my
initial report about why this report was issued and how it was paid for. We know the Small
Cap Street report was paid for by Hunter Marketing, but who paid Hunter Marketing? Was
it Provectus?


Path Forward? PVCT needs an expensive Phase III Trial just to apply for approval,
but has just $19mm of cash left, while already burning ~$1m per month.


As I discussed in my initial report, Provectus has survived by repeatedly executing highly
dilutive capital raises with some of Wall Street's shadiest investment banks. According to
CapIQ data, PVCT has executed no less than 19 dilutive financings, while producing
lifetime revenue of zero and losses since inception of $153 million. During this time period,

management has personally earned stated compensation of ~$49 million. More shocking
still, $24 million of this stated compensation was been paid to executives between 2011-
2013, according to PVCT proxy statements. This is the same time period in which
Provectus management apparently disregarded trial advice from the FDA that could have
positively impacted the BTD decision.


The company has $16.6m of cash on hand as of its latest 10-Q balance sheet, which
apparently increased to ~$19m in the mean time, despite the cash burn (per the update
call). Given I estimate PVCT will need to maintain $4-5m in cash, this $19m is enough to
cover a little over one year of operations, considering the company's trailing 4-year
average free cash flow burn of $13m per year.


Including fully diluted warrants, the company's share count today is ~245 million shares.
The Provectus Certificate of Incorporation allows a maximum share count of 250 million
shares. Provectus is currently attempting to raise this limit to 300 million shares at the
company's June 16, 2014 annual meeting. What will the company do to raise capital if it is
unable to increase its maximum share count?


ASCO Event a PVCT "Non-Event" In My View


Some PVCT shareholders seem to believe the upcoming ASCO conference is an
important "catalyst" for PVCT stock, based on PVCT's "presentation" there. I want
investors to be clear that, as far as I can tell, the hyped PVCT "ASCO Presentation" listed
here is identified as a "Poster Highlight Session". This is not a Keynote speech presenting
some groundbreaking information. In fact, when checking the implications of this on the
ASCO website here, the "Poster Highlight Session" description is explained down near the
bottom as:


"Poster Highlights Sessions feature selected abstracts of clinical research in poster
format. The posters are grouped by topic and are on display for a specified time"


Is PVCT simply putting PV-10 information on a cardboard poster somewhere at the
conference? It seems so to me, and if this is true, for a drug with no large pharma partner,
which the FDA has stated has a "paucity of data" and "clinical data do not demonstrate
substantial improvement over existing therapies", with Phase II trials done years ago and
with no Phase III trials, I do not see how a poster at a huge conference for a drug whose
trial happened years ago will have any material impact or could be considered any sort of
catalyst. I believe ASCO is a "non-event" for PVCT.
