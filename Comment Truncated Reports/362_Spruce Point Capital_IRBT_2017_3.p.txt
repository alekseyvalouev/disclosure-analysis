Why SharkNinja/Ecovacs Entering Vacuum Robotics Would Pose
20%-50% Downside Risk To iRobot
Jun. 27, 2017 12:51 PM ET61 comments
by: Ben Axler


Summary


With iRobot’s share price now +300% since 2016, investors are cheering the re-
acceleration of sales and earnings growth following years of disappointment, and
ascribing a peak valuation to plateauing EPS.


We expect SharkNinja to launch a competing product at lower price points.
SharkNinja outsold Dyson to claim market share in traditional vacuums and will
partner with China robotics leader Ecovacs.


iRobot's recent patent defense strategy and acquisition of its Japanese distributor
are defensive moves. Irreconcilable financial control issues are again surfacing at
iRobot; investors should tread carefully.


Robot is trading at a peak valuation and 30% above its average analyst price target
of $77. Many of its long-term fundamental investors have been selling. Insiders also
have been heavy sellers before its recent share price increase. Its valuation dwarfs
best of breed technology consumer companies such as Apple. If iRobot were to
trade closer to peers and its long-term valuation at  3x - 4x book value and 1.5x –
2.5x sales, we could see 20% – 50% downside risk.


Spruce Point Capital Management is pleased to issue a critical update report and alert our
readers it has re-established a short position in iRobot (Nasdaq: IRBT) as a result of our
industry research that suggests SharkNinja and Ecovacs, two widely successful
companies in vacuums and robotics may enter the market as earlier as Q4. In addition, we
have new evidence to suggest financial irregularities tied to iRobot's acquisition of its
related-party distributor. We believe there is 20% - 50% downside risk potential. Please
review our disclaimer at the bottom of this email. We also encourage all of our readers to
follow us on Twitter@sprucepointcap for regular updates.


I. Executive Summary


In May 2014, Spruce Point made its first short recommendation on iRobot, noting
fundamental struggles, signs of channel stuffing, and bad governance practices. We
later pointed to struggles to penetrate the Chinese market in Sept 2014. For the

following 2 years, iRobot’s share price languished and significantly
underperformed the Nasdaq technology index. A majority of our criticisms and
forecasts proved accurate.
With iRobot’s share price now up 300% since 2016, investors are cheering the re-
acceleration of sales and earnings growth following years of disappointment, and
ascribing a peak valuation to plateauing earnings. Spruce Point believes the financial
improvement reflects temporary factors and may not be sustainable. We expect new
competition to storm the market, and challenge iRobot’s US market share dominance.
iRobot’s recent financial performance reflects restocking of its supply chain after years
of false starts, the removal of the struggling military business, and the acquisition boost
from its Japanese distributor. We believe these factors will create very difficult
comparisons for iRobot to lap in the future, and create headwinds for future share price
appreciation. Furthermore, we believe recent gains are a result of lowering the price of
its Roomba to move down market, which we believe is a long-term negative on
margins for a technology hardware company with a narrow product focus
Investors are overlooking disruptive competition likely to enter iRobot’s US market.
Based on Spruce Point field research, we expect SharkNinja to launch a competing
product at lower price points. SharkNinja outsold Dyson to claim market share in
traditional vacuums. We believe they will partner with Ecovacs, the leader in the
Chinese/Asia market which stole significant market share from iRobot. SharkNinja has
a proven track record of disrupting numerous home appliance markets with dynamic
market strategies, and superior products. With 88% US market share, iRobot’s share
can only go down from here
Investors are overlooking financial control issues tied to iRobot’s recent acquisition of
its Japanese distributor. The Company suspiciously retracted certain statements made
about Japanese sales growth (reversing big gains to declines), and made revenue and
earnings revisions which don’t add up. Spruce Point has previously pointed out early
warning signs at Sabre (acquired its Asia distribution partner Abacus) and
Caesarstone (acquired its US distribution partner), ahead of financial problems
surfacing. Market observers will also note that Valeant’s option to buy its distributor
Philidor opened Pandora’s Box and was the canary in the coal mine
iRobot is trading at a peak valuation and 30% above its average analyst price target of
$77. Many of its long-term fundamental investors have been selling, while retail and
index funds buy. Insiders also have been heavy sellers before its recent share price
increase. Its valuation dwarfs best of breed technology consumer companies such as
Apple. If iRobot were to trade closer to peers and its long-term valuation at 3x - 4x
book value and 1.5x – 2.5x sales, we could see 20% – 50% downside risk

Timeline of Recent Events Affecting iRobot Since Our Reports in 2014:


2014-2015: iRobot misses revenue and earnings expectations multiple times after our
report’s warning


April 2015: iRobot attracts the attention of another activist investment firm who wagers a
proxy fight, criticizing the Company’s poor capital allocation and governance


Feb 2016: Under pressure, iRobot sells its struggling defense and security business and
has received just $23m in cash; the Company expands its share repurchase program by
$100m


March 2016: Repurchases $85m of its $100m through an accelerated share repurchase
Oct 2016: Raises guidance for second time, backs view of 15% consumer revenue growth


Nov 2016: Pursues inorganic growth by acquiring its Japanese distributor Sales on
Demand Corp for ~$18m


Feb 2017: Offers 2017 guidance of 17-19% revenue growth, but EPS to a wide range of
-9% to +11%; restates earnings transcript to correct gross mischaracterization of
Japanese performance +20% to -17%


April 2017: Raises top end of 2017 revenue and EPS range by just $5m and 0.05c,
respectively. Revises Japanese distributor contribution. After years of promoting the value
of its intellectual property, iRobot finally filed ITC Patent infringement complaint against
robotic vacuum cleaner products sold by Bissell, Hoover and Black and Decker covering 6
patents


A Majority of Spruce Point’s iRobot Concerns Have Proven Accurate

II. SharkNinja and Ecovacs: Roomba’s New Competitive Threat


SharkNinja, headquarted in Newton MA fifteen miles from iRobot, is an innovative
consumer home appliance company that has disrupted markets it enters with high
performance products, at affordable price points. Shark Ninja is a leader in vacuums and
blenders, and targets consumers through infomercials. Based on our research, we believe
they will enter the robotic vacuum market and challenge iRobot


From an article by Forbes entitled “ How Shark Ate Dyson’s Lunch In America” –
Dec 2014


Formerly known as Euro-Pro, a 100-year old company that had a mere 1% of vacuum
cleaner sales in 2008, SharkNinja now controls more than 20% of the US market
Over the past seven years, its Shark vacuum cleaners and Ninja blenders and food
processors, all manufactured in China, have increased sales at a compound annual
growth rate of 25%, enabling the firm to triple its workforce from 250 to 800 employees
This growth has been aided by an aggressive push on television shopping channels,
with $130m spent on TV advertising last year (examples: 1, 2, 3)
The Company has doubled revenues from $800 million to more than $1.6 billion and
usurped Dyson as leader of the US vacuum cleaner market since bringing in
consultants Gap International two years ago

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4084237-sharkninja-ecovacs-entering-vacuum-robotics-pose-20-percentminus-50-percent-downside-risk 5/31


Channel checks show SharkNinja already has key distribution partners: Home
Depot (HD), Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY), Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco
(COST), Best Buy (BBY) and Many More


These key distribution outlets overlap with many of iRobot’s existing distribution
partners
In addition, SharkNinja is known for its extensive infomercials and television
advertising. The Forbes article says it spent $130m on TV advertising, whereas iRobot
spent just $64.4m on advertising in 2016 (not all TV)


Shark Ninja Recently Hired Goldman Sachs To Evaluate A Sale According To
Reuters (April 2017)


Sources suggest that private equity firms have expressed the most interest in
SharkNinja
Given that PE firms are financially motivated to grow their investments to achieve
15%+ p.a. returns, a financial buyer would be incentivized to grow SharkNinja through
product and market expansion


Our Field Research on SharkNinja’s Robotic Vacuum Ambitions


We believe SharkNinja strives to be the #1 or #2 leader in markets it enters. Based on
its track record in traditional vacuums and blenders, we believe SharkNinja is a
credible threat to iRobot
SharkNinja’s displacement of Dyson in vacuums was a result of a laser-like focus on
the consumer, and its ability to engineer a superior product at a value price point. As
an organization, Linkedin data shows that SharkNinja employs more engineers than
sales or marketing people
We believe Dyson failed to gain traction with its robotic vacuum because its price point
of >$1,000 was simply too high, and it did not deliver meaningful performance
advantage to the customer. Simply stated, Dyson could not offer a compelling value
proposition
We believe SharkNinja will use a similar strategy it used to displace Dyson with its go
to market with iRobot – deliver a high performing product at a lower price point, in this
case in the $299 - $399 price range
Given SharkNinja’s marketing prowess stated to be $130m annually (2014 figures), we
wouldn’t be surprised to see it spend at least 10% or more to broaden product
awareness

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4084237-sharkninja-ecovacs-entering-vacuum-robotics-pose-20-percentminus-50-percent-downside-risk 6/31


SharkNinja has many existing relationships with retailers such as Target (TGT),
Walmart (WMT), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Best Buy (BBY) and Costco (COST).
We would not be surprised if they leverage these relations to distribute their robotic
vacuum in addition to infomercial marketing
Our research suggests that SharkNinja will partner with Ecovacs, the leading Chinese
robotics maker and company that has gained significant share against iRobot in China


SharkNinja Commands Significant Shelf Space At Leading Retailers


It’s easy to see why retailers would want SharkNinja to enter the vacuum robotics
market. Its current vacuums and blenders command significant shelf space and are
very popular with customers.


Retailers Preparing To Shrink iRobot Shelf Space


Two of our recent site visits demonstrated a disregard for iRobot’s shelf space and
proper product display. Is this indicative of retailers preparing to reduce its shelf
space?

SharkNinja Just Filed a Robotic Vacuum Patent, Before iRobot’s Patent Defense
Campaign


SharkNinja’s filing of a robotic vacuum patent in April 2017 has gone unnoticed by sell-
side analysts and investors, but Spruce Point believes it is a significant indicator of
SharkNinja’s ambition to leverage its success in traditional vacuums to compete in
home vacuum robotics.
Coincidentally iRobot announced its patent complaints two days earlier on April 18,
2017 against Bissell, Hoover, b0bsweep, iLife, Black& Decker and three Asian
companies. In our opinion, we believe IRBT’s recent patent claims are defensive, and
it is clearly worried about its competitive position

Ecovacs Has Grown Market Share Against IRBT in Asia, Now Expanding Into the US


Ecovacs is an Asian market leader in home robotics, that has taken significant share
from iRobot, and is taking clear steps to invade iRobot’s US market share. An IPO will
raise capital and give it a public currency to continue its market share gains. We
believe SharkNinja will partner with Ecovacs
Aug 2016: ECOVACS plans to introduce seven new home cleaning robots in the US in
2016: five clean bare-floors and carpets, and two wipe glass doors and clean windows
Feb 2017: Ecovacs Expands U.S. Footprint, Smart Home Technology; as part of its
continuing global expansion plan, Ecovacs Robotics will move into its new 3,000-
square-foot North American headquarters in San Francisco. The location of the new
headquarters itself was chosen with the company’s expansion plans in mind and in
large part due to its growing focus on smart home technology development.

Recent iRobot Performance A Result of Going Down Market, Deflating Prices


Based on our field research, we believe that iRobot has experienced the greatest

get market share gains
The pricing data below confirms our field research that. In the long run, we view this as
a negative that iRobot, retailer of a hardware consumer product, has to erode its brand
value by lower prices
We expect margin pressure to result in the coming quarters, especially because iRobot
has no more meaningful product introductions planned for next year

iRobot Appears To Be Obfuscating Its Price Deflation


Look carefully at iRobot’s “Supplemental Information” at the bottom of its recent press
releases and you will notice they stopped providing “ average gross selling prices for
consumer robots” – Is iRobot trying to obfuscate its price deflation?

iRobot Is Now Cutting Prices of Its High End New Roomba Product


The Company often promotes its latest iteration of essentially the same Roomba

980 starting at $899
iRobot said in Q1 that“ The $40.6 million increase in revenue from our consumer

III. Warning Signs From Recent Japanese Distributor Acquisition


Investors would be well cautioned to closely evaluate iRobot’s acquisition of Sales on
Demand Corp, its related-party Japanese distributor
There are numerous examples of early warning signs when companies acquire their
distribution partners or related-party entities.


New Signs Suggesting IRBT Is Gaming The Financials From Its Distributor
Acquisition


Notice That IRBT’s CFO Issues Corrective Statements About Japan’s Performance in
Q4’16:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4084237-sharkninja-ecovacs-entering-vacuum-robotics-pose-20-percentminus-50-percent-downside-risk 13/31


Original CFO Comment on Japan( Q4’16): “Austin just to circle back on your initial
question on Japan and China in the fourth quarter, so without getting too specific, Japan
was up probably about 20% in the fourth quarter year-on-year and China’s a fairly difficult
comp just based on the timing both last year and this year. So don’t read too much in to
this, but it was over 200% growth in the fourth quarter on China. But again we encourage
everybody to really focus on the full year growth rates for all of those regions versus Q4
specifically.”


Revised CFO Comment on Japan ( Q4’16): “Austin just to circle back on your initial
question on Japan and China in the fourth quarter, so without getting too specific, Japan
was [down 17%] (corrected by company after the call) in the fourth quarter year-on-
year [because we wanted to make sure the channels were clear ahead of our
acquisition and China was down 50% from Q4 last year as expected. As you may
recall we received an $11M order in Q3 2016 from China that we were expecting in Q4 so
China was up 140% in Q3 and then down year-over-year in Q4] (corrected by company
after the call). But again we encourage everybody to really focus on the full year growth
rates for all of those regions versus Q4 specifically.”


Then Following Quarter (Q1’17): “We have reduced our Japan expectations versus those
provided in February due to our analysis of inventory at retailers in Japan at the end of
Q1, which was higher than we would typically like to see. We have lowered the level of
incremental revenue post acquisition as we work through this channel inventory.


Revision of Deal Terms and Financials Suggest More Inventory Acquired: The
purchase price of the acquisition increased from earlier estimates. The purchase
price is mostly inventory. The higher the purchase price, the more inventory
acquired.


11/21/16 (press release): iRobot will acquire the business for a cash amount equal to the
book value of the acquired assets at close, primarily inventory, estimated to be between
$14m-$16m, subject to exchange rates in effect on the date of acquisition.


5/5/17 (Q1’10Q): On April 3, 2017, the Company closed its previously-announced
acquisition of the iRobot-related distribution business of Sales On Demand Corporation for
approximately $18 million in cash, equal to the book value of the acquired assets. The
acquisition price is subject to adjustments and will be finalized no later than May 18, 2017.


Why does IRBT need 6 months to accurately account for and value inventory it acquired
from its distributor? How hard is it to count the number of unsold Roombas sitting in a
warehouse and at retailers?

Financial Impact Revision From Distributor Acquisition Very Questionable


Original sales increase from Japanese acquisition of $20-$25m and ($0.25) to ($0.35)
EPS dilution (Q4’16 Press Release)
Later sales cut in half to $10-$12m and loses double ($0.50) to ($0.60) (Q1’17 Press
Release)
The distributor acquisition closed on schedule, yet is now expected to have a negative
contribution to Q2? IRBT says it has to sell through acquired inventory.


iRobot’s Japanese forecasts simply aren’t adding up.


Recall that it revised its sales contribution from $20 - $25m to $10 - $12m between
Q4’16 and Q1’17.
This revision amounts to between $10 - $13m lower sales
However, based on previous statements noted below made directly from management
the expected revision should have been just $4.7m - $7.0m
Therefore, we believe this is irrefutable evidence of financial control issues

(1) Q4’17 Earnings Call: As our largest international market, Japan is estimated to
comprise roughly 15% of this year’s total revenue.


(2) Q1’17 Earnings Call: For the full year, we expect revenue in the U.S. to grow from 18%
to 20%, China and Japan to grow approximately 30% each, and EMEA to grow mid-teens
over 2016.


IV. iRobot’s Significant Overvalution and 20% - 50% Downside Risk Potential


IRBT At Irrational Premium To Price Targets, Recent Brokers Are Negative


iRobot is trading at 23% above the average analyst price target; what do current
investors know that its seasoned analysts don’t? We caution that Canaccord
downgraded IRBT recently from Buy to Hold


Cannacord 5/30/17: We are downgrading IRBT to HOLD from Buy following nearly a 70%
appreciation for the stock YTD, and 50% PE expansion on consensus NTM earnings.
While we remain positive on growth prospects for the company (healthy momentum in the
U.S. as connectivity is driven deeper into the Roomba portfolio and accelerating
international growth), we expect only modest upside to our estimates for the balance of
the year and see little additional room for valuation expansion from present all-time highs.
Further, the lack of a new flagship product in 2017 could heighten uncertainty ahead of the
holiday season and drive multiple compression. Our price target remains $90 and our
estimates are unchanged.

iRobot Insiders Always Sell


Our previous reports noted that insider ownership has declined materially over the years,
and that trend continues. Insiders were heavy sellers even before the recent share price
increase, which should be considered a red flag. We expected continued insider sales
while the share price remains elevated

Peak Valuation For Fundamentally The Same Vacuum Company


Investors are ascribing a peak valuation to iRobot based on its recent renewed growth.
However, we believe there one-time factors aiding recent growth such as inventory
restocking, removal of the losing defense business from the financials, and the inclusion of
the Japanese distributor. Absent any new product drivers, iRobot will face significant year-
over-year comparison which will most certainly be difficult to achieve.

iRobot At An Irrational Premium To Peers


iRobot is best viewed as stagnant technology hardware company with limited growth
or innovation opportunities
As we’ve illustrated before, many of its previous product introductions such as health
telepresence or lawn robots have failed to gain traction.
For comparison, iRobot’s current valuation exceeds Apple (AAPL), which many would
argue is the primer consumer technology company
For investors that want exposure to home appliances and consumer products, we
believe Newell Brands (NWL), Whirlpool (WHR) and Spectrum Brands (SPB) are safer
bets
Our long-run base case view is that iRobot will be revalued in line with broken/faddish
technology companies such as GoPro (GPRO) and FitBit (FIT)
