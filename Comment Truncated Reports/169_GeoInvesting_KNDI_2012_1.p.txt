Connecting The Dots: Kandi's Clever But Apparent Related Party
Transactions
Sep. 27, 2012 2:13 PM ET32 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Kandi Technologies, Corp. (NASDAQ:KNDI) is located in the People's Republic of China
("PRC"). The company designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes all-terrain
vehicles, go-carts, and specialized automobile related products for the PRC and global
markets. We felt research on KNDI was warranted due in part to the entity that helped
bring the company public - Winner International. Winner was the key financial middleman
in the reverse mergers that turned Telestone (NASDAQ:TSTC), New Oriental Energy
(OTCPK:NOEC) and Orsus Xelent (ORSX.pk) into publicly traded companies. The stocks
of all three of those companies were decimated after allegations of deception in their
business practices surfaced.


So as it goes, KNDI is the latest Chinese small cap RTO that the GeoTeam has
discovered with curious transactions with undisclosed related parties that not only bring
into question the nature of the transactions but the credibility of the company itself. Given
this backdrop it is not surprising that KNDI makes the dubious portrayal of a bright future
for its electric vehicle ("EV") business. The facts on the ground clearly indicate KNDI's EV
business hasn't gotten off the ground and we question its viability.


The transactions we analyzed involved at least nine individuals with connections to
KNDI and its Chairman, and seven different entities. The transactions all appeared to be
planned well in advance and involved individuals who were senior executives of KNDI's
management team either at the time of or shortly before the transactions were completed.
When all was said and done two of the transactions resulted in the transfer of $20 million
in cash and stock to individuals influenced or controlled by KNDI's chairman. The other
transaction involved the sale of KNDI's import and export business to individuals who also
had close ties to KNDI and its Chairman. It seems KNDI's Chairman prefers dealing with
individuals he may know, influence or control. We highly doubt that any of the transactions
we analyzed were negotiated on an arm's length basis.


Investors should take note of the fact that the referenced individuals controlled two entities
that were party to the transactions. One of the entities became KNDI's largest supplier and
the other one of its largest customers. The chain of events is suspicious given the related

parties involved in the transactions, leading us to ponder whether they were possibly
planned, structured, and staged in a manner intended to confuse regulators and investors
attempting to perform due diligence on the company.


We evaluated three transactions made by KNDI after its reverse merger. For one, the
2008 acquisition of Kandi Special Vehicles Co., Ltd., the company falsely claimed that no
material related party relationship was involved in the transaction. The company also
failed to disclose related party relationships regarding the acquisition of Scrou in February
2012 and the disposition of Dingji in 2008. Details regarding the transactions we evaluated
follow:


The acquisition of Kandi Special Vehicles Co., Ltd. ("KSV") in April 2008. KSV was
owned by Lang Jianfeng and Hu Xintao, two gentlemen with connections to KNDI
both before and since the transaction. KNDI claimed (incorrectly) that these two
individuals had "no material relationship" with KNDI. The KSV acquisition had a
curious set of circumstances that make it appear as if the transaction was planned and
staged:


Six months before KNDI's reverse merger in 2007, KNDI's Chairman and vice
president (Hu Xiaoming and Hu Wangyuan, father and son) owned 100% of Kandi
Investment Group Co., Ltd. ("KIG"). For unknown reasons and apparently without
consideration, the chairman transferred ownership of KIG to Lang Jianfeng and
Hu Xintao on October 18, 2006.
Adding further intrigue, KNDI signed a letter of intent to acquire KSV with Lang
Jianfeng and Hu Xintao in November 2007, only four months after KNDI's reverse
merger and, remarkably, before KSV was formally established in March 2008.
Almost immediately after KSV was established, KNDI disclosed the acquisition of
the company for $12.3 million in April 2008. The transaction closed in June 2008.
KIG and KNDI have the same official address. We confirmed this by calling KNDI
and verifying that Lang Jianfeng has or had an office in KNDI's facility and he
is/was in charge of the company's SAIC and other corporate matters.
It should be noted that KIG owns 100% of another company called Zhejiang
Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd. ("ZEMC").


Acquisition of Scrou, a manufacturer of electric motors in February 2012 from
shareholders of KO NGA for 2.3 million shares ($7,952,524) of KNDI. Scrou was spun
off as a separate entity from ZMEC in November 2011 apparently to facilitate its sale to
KNDI. ZMEC had been and still is 100% owned by KIG. As previously noted, KIG
was owned by KNDI's chairman and vice president before he transferred ownership to

Lang Jianfeng and Hu Xintao, the same gentlemen who formed KSV to facilitate the
previously described $12.3 million acquisition of that company by KNDI. Furthermore,
KNDI also discloses ZMEC as one of its largest suppliers. ZMEC is not only a supplier,
it is also a competitor as the company manufactures the same products (ATV and go-
carts) as KNDI and sells those products into the same markets.
The sale of KNDI's import/export business called Dingji in 2008 to Lu Erwa and Zhu
Bilian, two individuals with close ties to KNDI. One was a former director of Kandi
Vehicle; the primary operating entity of KNDI, before the reverse merger and the other
is the supervisor of ZMEC. However, we found that Lu Erwa and Lang Jianfeng, rather
than Zhu Bilian, really acquired Dingji three months before the disclosure by KNDI.


The relationship among these related entities and individuals can be summarized under
this chart:


"C" denotes current relationship (ownership, director or supervisor) between the person
and the company .


"F" denotes former relationship (ownership, director or supervisor) between the person
and the company .


Following is what we learned about the related companies that were party to and the key
individuals who facilitated the KNDI transactions. We also discuss the current state of
KNDI operations and provide recordings to support our findings.


I. Related Companies Involved In The KNDI Case


Zhejiang Kandi Vehicle Co., Ltd.


Zhejiang Kandi Vehicle CO., Ltd. ("Kandi Vehicle") is the primary operating entity of KNDI
located in the Jinhua City Industrial Zone, Jinhua City, Zhejiang province. Information
obtained from Kandi Vehicle's SAIC filing is enclosed as Exhibit A. Our Investigator visited
Kandi Vehicle in August 2012. Based on conversations with several different Kandi

Vehicle employees, there are around 450 employees at the facility. This finding is
consistent with the 447 of employees reported by KNDI in its Form 10K filing at December
31, 2011.


The employees also confirmed that the main products of Kandi Vehicle are all terrain
vehicles ("ATV"), go-carts, and electric vehicles ("EV") and that most ATV and go-carts are
built for export. The employees further confirmed that Kandi Vehicle is promoting EV with
the brand "Kandi" in China.


We found four production facilities on Kandi Vehicle's property. The facilities cover around
250 to 300 meters by 80 to 100 meters. There are also two seven-floor dormitories, a four-
floor office building, and a two-floor activity building on the site. Pictures of the buildings of
Kandi Vehicle follow:


Kandi Investment Group Co., Ltd.


Kandi Investment Group Co., Ltd. ("KIG") was established on July 3, 2003 by father and
son, Hu Xiaoming (83%) and Hu Wangyuan (17%). Hu Xiaoming currently controls KNDI.
On December 28, 2006, six months before KNDI's reverse merger, Hu Xiaoming and Hu
Wangyuan transferred ownership of KIG to Lang Jianfeng (83%) and Hu Xintao (17%).
KIG's SAIC file is included with this report as Exhibit B.

Both before and after the transfer of KIG's ownership, Ling Li (following the last name of
her mother, Ling Yueping, the daughter of Hu Xiaoming and sister of Hu Wangyuan)
served as supervisors of KIG.


Examination of SAIC filings revealed that KIG shares the same registered address as
Kandi Vehicle at Jinhua City Industrial Zone (industrial zone of Jinhua City development
zone), Jinhua City, Zhejiang province. Our investigator called KNDI to confirm that Lang
Jianfeng, the chairman of KIG has/had an office at KNDI's campus and is/was in charge of
the company's SAIC matters. The recording of that conversation can be heard here.
(Read transcript)


In April, 2012, Hu Wangyuan, the vice president of KNDI visited Huiyuan County
apparently representing himself as the chairman of China Kandi Investment Group to
make an investment (Bing translated) in an electric vehicle project.


KIG currently owns 100% of Zhejiang Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd. ("ZMEC").


Zhejiang Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd.


ZMEC is a Chinese company with its registered address at Huajie Industrial District,
Huajie Town, Yongkang City, Zhejiang province.


ZMEC was 100% owned by KIG before September 10, 2008. On September 10, 2008, a
group of 25 individual investors jointly owned 48.13% of ZMEC, while KIG owned the
remaining 51.87%:


On August 24, 2009, the group of 25 individual investors transferred 100% of their ZMEC
ownership to a company called Changzhou Tianfa Donglizongcheng Zhizao Co., Ltd.
("Changzhou").

https://seekingalpha.com/article/892201-connecting-the-dots-kandis-clever-but-apparent-related-party-transactions 6/29


On June 1, 2010, Changzhou transferred 100% ownership of Mengdeli to a company
called Yongkang K S Electric Co., Ltd. We also found that Yongkang K S Electric Co., Ltd.
was established on May 25, 2010 by K S Asia Limited (Hong Kong), only five days before
its acquisition of ZMEC.


On November 18, 2011, Scrou was spun off from ZMEC as an independent company. On
February 9, 2012, Yongkang K S Electric Co., Ltd. transferred 100% ownership of ZMEC
back to KIG. ZEMC's SAIC file is included with this report as Exhibit C.


Our investigator visited ZMEC in August 2012 and learned that ZMEC shares the site with
another company called Kandi Door. There are several signs for "Kandi Door" (康迪门业)
(KandiHome Door (康迪红门业) next to ZMEC's sign at the entrance of the building. There
is also a clear sign reading "Kandi Group" (康迪集团), which indicates ZMEC and Kandi
Door are associated with "Kandi Group" (康迪集团).


Our investigator spoke to some of ZMEC's employees. They said that ZMEC
manufactures two-wheel scooters, all terrain vehicles (ATV) and go-carts. Our
investigator also saw a small chalk board on the security gate that was being used to
recruit 2 ATV inspectors.


ZMEC's SAIC file describes the company's business scope as follows:


"Electric Vehicle, ATV, off-road two wheel vehicle (except car and motor cycle),
vehicle appliance, vehicle parts (except vehicle engine) hardware tool, scooter,
Electronic shower, toy, toy motorboat, go-cart, exercise equipment and its parts
development, manufacture, and sales."


In additional to the sign identifying Kandi Group at ZMEC's entrance, we found numerous
online sources citing ZMEC as a subsidiary of Kandi Group, including the following:


1. As a subsidiary of KIG, ZMEC executed an agreement with Huaiyuan County
Government to invest in an electric scooter, electric vehicle, and golf cart production
line in Huaiyuan County.

3. On various internet web pages, ZMEC's contact person is Hu Wangyuan, the vice
president of KNDI and the son of Hu Xiaoming, the chairman of KNDI. Here are some
relevant links:

You may also use the Chinese spelling to search Mengdeli "梦得力" and Kandi "康迪" in
any search engine, such as Google, Baidu or Bing. You will find that ZMEC is
associated with Kandi Group and is described as a subsidiary of Kandi Group.


Since ZMEC and Kandi Door occupy the same building and the two companies may very
well share production lines, we are unable to verify the size of ZMEC's production
facilities. Pictures of buildings housing ZMEC and KandiHome Door follow:

Yongkang Scrou Electric Co., Ltd.


"Scrou was part of ZMEC before it was spun off from ZMEC on November 18, 2011.
Before the official separation, ZMEC made an announcement on the Yong Kang Daily as
follows:


The translation of the announcement:


The Separation announcement of Zhejiang Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd.


Based upon the decision of the shareholders, this company will be divided into
Zhengjiang Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd. and Yongkang City Scrou Electric Co., Ltd.
The registered capital of the original Zhejiang Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd. is RMB 80
million. After the separation, the registered capital of Zhejiang Mengdeli Electric Co.,
Ltd. is RMB 40 million and the registered capital of Yongkang City Scrou Electric
Co., Ltd. is RMB 40 million. Within 45 days after this announcement, creditors have
the right to request our company to pay the liability and/or provide relevant

It is noteworthy that Scrou's separation from ZMEC as an independent company was only
three months before it was acquired by KNDI. Scrou's SAIC file information is included
with this report as Exhibit D.


Our investigator visited Scrou in August 2012. Scrou has around 60 employees (58 was
the count given by Scrou's security guard). The security guard also confirmed that Scrou
was previously part of ZMEC and has been independent of ZMEC since the end of 2011.
Scrou has three four-floor buildings on the site, shown in the pictures below. The security
guard also confirmed that the company's main products are electric motors, which is also
claimed by KNDI in its press release.

"In November 2007, the Company signed a letter of intent with the
shareholders of Kandi Special Vehicles Co., Ltd., by which the Company
would acquire 100% of Kandi Special Vehicles Co., Ltd. The Company paid
$12,270,859 as a deposit in 2007. The total consideration for the acquisition was
$12,314,988. All the transactions of this acquisition were completed in June 24,
2008. There is no material relationship between the Company and Kandi
Special Vehicles Co., Ltd."


In KNDI's 2009 10-K, the company disclosed the acquisition as follows:


"KSV is located in the Jinhua city of Zhejiang province of China and is registered
under the laws of the PRC. KSV was established on March 17, 2008 and is at its
development state. KSV plans to produce special vehicles, electric vehicles, and
automobile parts and sell the products in the PRC market."


The acquisition of KSV can be explained as follows:


KNDI signed a letter of intent to acquire KSV, a non-established company, from Lang
Jianfeng and Hu Xintao (neighbor of Hu Xiaoming) in November 2007, four months after
the reverse merger which happened on June 29, 2007. On April 18, 2008, one month after
the establishment of KSV, KNDI disclosed the acquisition. At the same time, KNDI claimed
that there was no material relationship between Lang Jianfeng, Hu Xintao and KNDI. This
statement, however, is not true since from November 3, 2006 to April 30, 2008, Lang
Jianfeng was director of Kandi Vehicle, the primary operating entity of KNDI.


Lang Jianfeng is also the owner and chairman of Kandi Investment, which Lang Jianfeng
and Hu Xintao (neighbor of Hu Xiaoming) obtained apparently without consideration from
Hu Xiaoming, chairman of KNDI and Hu Wangyuan, vice president of KNDI on October
18, 2006, six months before KNDI's reverse merger.


Also noteworthy is that KIG shares the same business address as KNDI. So the
management of Kandi Investment, Lang Jianfeng and Hu Xintao share office space with
the management of KNDI, Hu Xiaoming and Hu Wangyuan.


KNDI claimed to sell Dingji to Lu Erwa and Zhu Bilian on May 8, 2008

5/23/2018 Connecting The Dots: Kandi's Clever But Apparent Related Party Transactions - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seek…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/892201-connecting-the-dots-kandis-clever-but-apparent-related-party-transactions 15/29


Based on its May 9, 2008 press release, KNDI sold Yongkang Dingji Import & Export Co.,
Ltd. ("Dingji") to Lu Erwa and Zhu Bilian for RMB 5,000,000 ($712,027)


As previously noted, Lu Erwa served as the supervisor of Kandi Vehicle, the operating
entity of KNDI, from April 30, 2004 to Nov. 3, 2006, six months before the reverse merger
with KNDI. Zhu Bilian also currently serves as the supervisor of both ZMEC and Scrou.


However, based on Dingji's SAIC file, KNDI (Kandi Vehicle) had already transferred 100%
ownership of Dingji to Lang Jianfeng (30%) and Lu Erwa (70%) on February 5, 2008,
three months before the disclosure made by KNDI. Zhu Bilian was not and is not the
owner of Dingji. The SAIC file of Dingji is enclosed as Exhibit E.


We believe that as of April 18, 2008, KNDI already disclosed that Lang Jianfeng and Hu
Xintao sold KSV to KNDI. In an apparent effort to avoid referencing Lang Jianfeng again
KNDI forged the information stating that Zhu Bilian, rather than Lang Jianfeng, acquired
Dingji from KNDI along with Lu Erwa.


KNDI acquired Scrou on Feb. 8, 2012 for 2,354,211 shares ($7,952,524)


On Feb. 17, 2012, KNDI disclosed in an 8K the acquisition of Yong Kang Scrou Electric
Co., Ltd. ("Scrou") with 2,354,211 shares of KNDI:


"On February 13, 2012, Kandi Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Agreement") with KO
NGA Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation ("KONGA") and each of
the shareholders of KO NGA ("KO NGA Shareholders," and, together with KONGA,
the "Sellers"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Sellers will exchange an
aggregate of 253 shares of KO NGA, representing 100% of the issued and
outstanding shares of KO NGA, to the Company for a total of 2,354,211 shares (the
"Exchange Shares") of the company's common stock (the "Exchange"), representing
an aggregate exchange purchase price of RMB 50,052,387.66 (approximately
$7,952,524), which is primarily derived from KO NGA's indirect, wholly-owned
operating entity Yongkang Scrou Electric. Co., Ltd. in China and based upon a
valuation report by an independent, third party valuation firm. Upon consummation of
the Exchange, KO NGA will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Company is obligated to file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or if Form S-
3 is not available another appropriate form) registering the resale of the Exchange
Shares that are to be issued to the Sellers."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/892201-connecting-the-dots-kandis-clever-but-apparent-related-party-transactions 16/29


KNDI filed the share exchange agreement concerning the acquisition of Scrou as exhibit
10.1 of its annual report filed on March 30, 2012. Based upon this agreement, the
2,354,211 shares were issued to the following members:


As previously noted, Scrou was part of ZMEC and was spun off as an independent entity
on November 18, 2011, three months before being acquired by KNDI. At the time of the
spin off, Lang Jianfeng was the chairman of Scrou and Zhu Bilian was the supervisor. Gao
Shuping only became the chairman of Scrou after December 15, 2011, two months before
the acquisition. As already noted in this report, Gaqo Shuping was a director of Kandi
Vehicle with Lu Erwa from April 30, 2004 to November 3, 2006, six months before the
reverse merger. Zhu Bilian and Lu Erwa acquired Dingji from KNDI in 2008. Zhu Bilian is
still the supervisor of Scrou.


We also found in our research of ZMEC that from September 10, 2008 to August 24,
2009, there were 25 individual investors who jointly owned 48.13% of ZMEC. All seven
members who received shares from KNDI as the consideration for the acquisition of Scrou
were among the 25 individual investors that held equity in ZMEC.


IV. ZMEC: A Supplier, Competitor and Related Party of KNDI


In the 10K, KNDI did not disclose the names its major customers and suppliers. Instead
KNDI lists unnamed companies based on the % of business it does with them:


We don't know why KNDI is reluctant to disclose the names of its major customers and
suppliers as most other public companies do unless such disclosures would raise issues
and questions the company would like to avoid. We note, however, that KNDI did
reference ZMEC in the SEC filing as follows:



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1316517/000114420412028958/v312867_ex10-1.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/892201-connecting-the-dots-kandis-clever-but-apparent-related-party-transactions 17/29


"On August 24, 2010, the Company entered into a guarantee contract to serve as
guarantor for the bank note borrowed from Huaxia Bank Hangzhou branch in the
amount of $1,256,933 by Zhejiang Mengdeli Electric Co., Ltd. ("ZMEC") for the
period from August 24, 2010 to August 24, 2012. ZMEC is a supplier but not
related to the Company."


Given the amount of the bank note and close relationship with KNDI, it is reasonable to
assume that ZMEC is KNDI's largest supplier that accounted for 61% of total purchases in
2011 and 84% in 2010. As we detailed in this report, ZMEC is a related party of KNDI.
This related party relationship has not been properly disclosed by KNDI.


Of more relevance is that based on our on-the-ground due diligence, ZMEC manufactures
ATV and go-carts under the "Mengdeli" and "Kandi" brands. We have a recording with the
front desk operator(0086-579-87293399) of ZMEC to further support our thesis (Read
transcript). ZMEC is therefore directly competing with KNDI for the manufacturing and sale
of ATVs and go-carts.


It is curious that ZMEC is both a competitor and a business partner of KNDI. In fact,
ZMEC's marketing materials refer to the company as a subsidiary of Kandi Group along
with Kandi Vehicle, the principal operating subsidiary of KNDI. We can't explain why these
companies are manufacturing the same products to directly compete with each other. In
such circumstances, how can US investors know their best interests are being protected
given ZMEC is controlled by the Chairman of KNDI whose daughter, Ling Li, is the
supervisor of KIG, the sole owner of ZMEC? What is in the Chairman's and his daughter's
best interest may not coincide with what is in the best interest of US investors.


V. Dingji, Claimed to Having Been Sold to Lu Erwa and Zhu Bilian, is Now One of
KNDI's Top Customers


We researched Dingji, which is claimed to having been sold to Lu Erwa and Zhu Bilian
(two senior executives of KNDI) on May 8, 2008. We found that Dingji continues to export
go-carts and motorcycles to several customers in the United States, including a company
called Kandi USA Inc. in 2010 and 2011.


We also found the website of Kandi USA Inc. The description of Kandi USA Inc. on its
website is as follows:

"About Kandi USA, Inc.:


Kandi USA, Inc., a California corporation with a large office and warehouse in the
Los Angeles area, is a factory power sports distributor for the dealer network
throughout North America, Central America, the Caribbean region and South
America.


About Manufacturer


Established in the 80's, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd., wholly owned by Kandi
Technologies, Corp. , engages in the design, development,..."


KNDI is the manufacturer for the products sold by Kandi USA Inc. Dingji is the import and
export agent for KNDI's ATVs and go-carts sold to Kandi USA Inc. So we can therefore
conclude that Dingji is one of KNDI's key customers for ATVs and go-carts.


However, in the annual report, KNDI disclosed only the rankings but not the names of its
top customers:


We believe that based on our research that Dingji, a related party of KNDI, is one of
the company's largest customers. The related party relationship between KNDI and
Dingji has not been properly disclosed.


VI. KNDI's EV Business Far From Successful


On July 16, 2012, KNDI issued a press release with the title "Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd.
Signed a Cooperative Letter of Intent With China Aviation Lithium Battery Co., Ltd. to
Promote 20,000 Pure Electric Vehicles in Hangzhou" including the following excerpt:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/892201-connecting-the-dots-kandis-clever-but-apparent-related-party-transactions 19/29


"Under the project, AVIC/CALB will be responsible to produce automobile-use lithium
batteries and purchase 20,000 electric vehicles for personal leasing, while the State
Grid will be responsible for the construction and supply of the charging network to
power the operation of 20,000 EVs as well as the procurement of integrated
automobile-use power battery sets. The Hangzhou municipal government will
provide financial subsidies and create supporting policies that are beneficial for the
promotion of EVs."


On Aug. 13, 2012, KNDI issued another press release with the title "Kandi Signed
Cooperative Framework Agreement With Zhejiang Guoxin Vehicle Leasing Company to
Promote Self-Driving Pure Electric Vehicles Rental for Public Transportation in Hangzhou
Project", including the following excerpts:


1. Parties will cooperate according to The Feasibility Study of a Public
Transportation Project of 100,000 Self-driving Rental EVs in Five Years in Hangzhou
City…


2. Parties intend to launch the preparation work for the Project immediately after
signing the cooperative framework agreement. Guoxin Leasing will first purchase
200 EVs from Kandi Vehicles to launch the project, and the final terms and time for
delivery have yet to be determined.


KNDI's press release conveys a very promising outlook for this project. Following these
news stories, an article was published on Seeking Alpha by Perry Coleman to tout KNDI -
Kandi Technologies: A practical Approach to the EV market.


Kandi's actual business is, however, anything but successful at this stage. In the 10-Q for
the second quarter of 2012, KNDI states:


"For the EV products, the Company has not realized mass unit sales during this
reporting period. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, revenues from our Super-
mini car decreased by $771,005, or 22.6% from the same period of 2011, which was
attributable to an increase in unit sales of 17.9% from 542 units in the first six
months of 2011 to 639 units in 2012. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the
average unit price of our super-mini-cars decreased 34.4%, because during
this reporting period, the Company adopted the sales mode of charging or
exchanging batteries to sell the super-mini-cars without batteries."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/892201-connecting-the-dots-kandis-clever-but-apparent-related-party-transactions 20/29


An online report at sina.com.cn (Bing translate) regarding the EV lease business was
published on August 20, 2012. The key information of the report follows:


1. The original subsidy plan of Hangzhou city will expire at the end of 2012. The new
subsidy plan has not been released yet. Under the original plan, the rental price of an
EV can range from around RMB 800 to RMB 1,000 per month. However, without the
subsidy, the rental price will be RMB 2,000 per month, too high for most consumers to
rent the car.


2. The battery of KNDI's EV is flat while the traditional batteries used by other EVs are
rectangular. So far there is only one recharge station (Gucui Road Station) that can be
used by KNDI's EV. All other recharge stations would have to be remodeled to
accommodate KNDI's EV.


3. The first 100 vehicles allocated for the rental project are still in KNDI's factory. To date,
there hasn't been a single vehicle delivered to a customer under the rental project and
there is no timeline for future deliveries. The entire 200,000 EV leasing project is still in
the planning stage and is far from implementation.


4. Although there have been some inquiries regarding KNDI's EV rental business, a new
subsidy plan and additional recharge stations that can accommodate KNDI's batteries
are needed to make the company's EV viable.


To further develop this story, we had our investigator visit Hangzhou City to investigate
KNDI's actual business at the end of August 2012. Our investigator talked to a manager of
Hangzhou Electric Vehicle Enterprise Development Co., Ltd. ("EV Enterprise"), the
company that is promoting the KNDI's EV rental business. Click here to listen to a
recording of the conversation with the officer of the EV Enterprise. (Read transcript)


Our investigator also visited Hangzhou Guoxin Vehicle Leasing Co., Ltd.("Guoxin") and
found that there are still no EVs available for lease. Further, the company hasn't even
established a leasing price for the EV or set a timeline for delivery of the vehicles.


It is therefore apparent that implementation of KNDI's EV business plan in Hangzhou City
is far from reality and the entire project depends on generous government subsidies that
do not appear likely to be renewed after they expire at the end of 2012.


VII. Conclusion


Two transactions, the acquisition of KSV from Lang Jianfeng and Hu Xintao for
$12,314,988 and the acquisition of Scrou for 2,345,211 shares ($7,952,524) from Gao
Shuping and others, accounted for the payment of over $21 million to individuals who
either worked for KNDI at the time of or just prior to when the transactions were

completed. Those transactions were executed without necessary disclosure of the
relationships the individuals involved in the transactions had with KNDI and its
chairman.
KNDI claimed to sell Dingji, its import and export business, to Lu Erwa and Zhu Bilian,
two individuals related to KNDI for only $712,027. However, based on the SAIC file,
KNDI sold Dingji to Lu Erwa and Lang Jianfeng. As Lang Jianfeng sold KSV to KNDI
on April 18, 2008, only 20 days before the sale of Dingji, it is likely that for the purpose
of avoiding using the same name again, KNDI referenced Zhu Bian instead of Lang
Jianfeng, the actual person involved in the transaction. Furthermore, Dingji continues
to operate the import/export business and even sells products to a company called
Kandi USA Inc. Given the close ties of the individuals involved in the transaction it
would be easy for KNDI's management to set pricing at levels that would facilitate the
transfer of gross margins to Dingji.
ZMEC, one of KNDI's largest suppliers is also a direct competitor. We do not know
how under the circumstances KNDI's chairman can guarantee ZMEC is not taking
business from KNDI. At the same time, ZMEC is also one of KNDI's major suppliers.
There is no way for investors to know business between the entities is being
conducted on an arm's length basis and that margins that should rightfully accrue to
the benefit of KNDI's shareholders are not going to Dingji.
ZMEC continues to grow its business and just signed a contract to expand production
(Bing translate) of its electric scooters, electric vehicles, golf carts and more in
Huaiyuan County, Anhui province with a planned investment of RMB 1 billion. ZMEC
also plans to develop a real estate complex zoning for hotel, commercial building, and
residential buildings in Huaiyuan County, Anhui province with a total investment of
RMB 1 billion. It is entirely possible that KNDI's chairman could use KNDI as a vehicle
to finance ZMEC's expansion plans in Huaiyuan County.
KNDI's EV business is still far from viable in Hangzhou City. The entire 20,000 KNDI's
EV rental business is still in the planning stage and the first 100 vehicles promised to
consumers have not been delivered. KNDI's EV rental business depends on subsidies
from Hangzhou City, which are going to expire at the end of 2012. Currently, there is
no new subsidy plan to replace the existing one.
