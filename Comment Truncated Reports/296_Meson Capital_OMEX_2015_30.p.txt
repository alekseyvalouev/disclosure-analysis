Chatham Rock Phosphate Drops 90%: Minor Setback Or More Serious
Issue?

Summary


Odyssey undersea mining partner and investee Chatham Rock Phosphate had its
marine consent application rejected - stock has dropped over 90%.


OMEX held approximately 10mm shares of Chatham so this is an immediate
economic loss of around $3mm.


More importantly, Chatham spent far more than Oceanica on attempting to achieve
environmental approval for a similar undersea phosphate mine but was resoundingly
rejected by the regulators.


This appears to be a major setback for OMEX's undersea phosphate project
Oceanica in Mexico as it shared a similar process with Chatham including Royal
Boskalis for dredging.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) became a major shareholder in Chatham
Rock Phosphate (CRP.NZ) by providing services and partnering with them for Chatham's
New Zealand undersea phosphate mining project.


Despite undersea mining for bulk materials not being demonstrated to be economic or
practical ever before, OMEX has made this a core focus of their business to pivot away
from historic shipwrecks after legal challenges have left that business apparently
impractical.

OMEX highlighted these "off balance sheet" value creators repeatedly to investors in 2013
before our initial report challenging the accuracy of these. Above is an update. First
Neptune Minerals was written off 94% last fall after OMEX lent $500k which was not
repaid. In November 2014, Oceanica was Suspended at the Mexican environmental
regulator SEMARNAT pending OMEX answering follow up questions - shareholders are
still awaiting an update on this approximately now 80 days after the process was
suspended. And today in New Zealand, Chatham Rock Phosphate officially appears to be
dead with the Marine Consent being declined.


Chatham's stock declined by over 90% on the news and it does not appear they have the
capital to continue the business.

According to Chatham's CEO, "We had a strong level of agreement by scientific and other
experts from both sides that the environmental effects were either limited or manageable."


The CEO also noted that they spent $33mm on the project over 7 years attempting to get
environmental approval. This contrasts to an estimated $10mm at OMEX's Oceanica in
Mexico over a mere 2 years so far. Chatham appeared more credible than Oceanica in
other ways including the large dredging company Royal Boskalis as a disclosed major
shareholder and partner. OMEX has not referred to Royal Boskalis in any official specific
capacity, nor as a shareholder, only vaguely that they are "working with" Boskalis.


NZ EPA Rejection Ruling against Chatham Phosphate


However the official NZ environmental regulator felt very differently about the project.


Summary of EPA report


Press release of EPA Report


The FULL CRP Rejection Report


Summary:


1. "It concluded that mining would cause significant and permanent adverse effects on
the existing benthic environment. "


2. "The DMC found that the destructive effects of the extraction process, coupled with
the potentially significant impact of the deposition of sediment on areas adjacent to the
mining blocks and on the wider marine environment, could not be mitigated by any set
of conditions or adaptive management regime that might be reasonably imposed


3. "DMC also concluded that the economic benefit to New Zealand of the proposal
would be modest at best"


4. there were also concerns about vibrations and noise impact on the environment from
this project


5. "concluded that the application could not be approved either in part or in whole "


Relevant quotes from the full document with relevant analysis to Oceanica and similarities:


Noise is a key concern with Oceanica regarding impact on local marine animals and whale
migration, NZ decided noise is a serious concern too:

"Other risks to the environment considered by the DMC included: effects on the
trophic web (including primary production, microbes and zooplankton), fish and other
pelagic fauna, rock lobsters, paua, water quality and seabirds; the effects of mining
related noise, including on marine mammals; and the risks to biosecurity and human
health."


The issues can not be managed and would permanently destroy the ecosystem:


i. The destructive impact of the drag-head on the seabed and on the benthic fauna in
and on the


seabed was a major concern, given that:


(NYSE:A) these effects could not be avoided, remedied or mitigated


...........(NYSE:D) the habitat would not return to its present form but rather would be
transformed


wholly into soft sediment habitat.


Desktop and computer models (like what Oceanica EIA is based on) are not sufficient to
approve these projects - actual time based, expensive field studies are needed


"uncertainties stemming from the fact that this would be the first seabed mining
project ever undertaken at such depths anywhere in the world, and from the heavy
reliance placed on insufficiently validated modelling to predict the impacts of the
project


Unlike Oceanica, Chatham proposed environmental compensation, acknowledging
implicitly that marine/environmental damage would occur.


"The various proposals made by the applicant for environmental


compensation did not in the DMC's view amount to mitigation."


It appears Royal Boskalis uses tax shelter Cyprus residency for vessels, potentially
making environmental liability enforcement challenging for these unprecedented projects,
this may concern locals near one of these phosphate projects....

", Mr van Raalte stated that normally Boskalis' larger


vessels sailed under the Cyprus flag. Mr Currie suggested that Cyprus was known
as a flag of


convenience, making liability compensation potentially difficult to obtain in the event
of


unforeseen circumstances.

This may explain why OMEX/Oceanica have not proposed a test pilot - it was simply too
expensive for Chatham:


"As indicated above, it might have answered some of the questions raised by
submitters and


resolved some of the uncertainties if it had been possible to run a pilot mining
proposal over a


limited period in order to verify Boskalis' initial design work. Such a test pilot was not
however


deemed viable by the applicant because of the initial investment required.


86"


NZ makes it extremely challenging to appeal this project and does not present any
pathway around the rejection ruling. Note this was after years of back and forth with
opposing scientists where Chatham was able to hear and address the objections and this
is particularly interesting given that OMEX has been suspended and nonresponsive to
SEMARANT in Mexico - why would they be dragging things out?

"Since the DMC concluded after reviewing all the


evidence and testimony that the application could not be approved (on grounds
largely


independent of the mechanics of the mining operation), the DMC did not consider it
necessary


to either seek more information from the applicant or ask the applicant to undertake
further work


on the proposed conditions and adaptive management regime relating to the mining
operation


Sediment could potentially be churned up into the water and drift for 103 square
kilometers and stay in the water for decades:


"For example, the modelling predicted that sedimentation of up to 1 cm thick would
occur over a


seabed area of 35 km2 and up to 1 mm thick over an area of 103 km2"


" Professor Watling, who stated in his evidence "In addition,


the time for sediment de-watering, known as self-consolidation, seems to be very
hard to


predict, but could easily be of the order of decades. "


Chatham phosphate was too high in uranium and, if used, would pollute soil over 40-50
year time frame until unsuitable for agriculture:


" The ESR report concludes that the use of


Chatham Rise phosphorite as a direct application fertiliser would increase uranium
inputs by a


factor of eight"


New Zealand government acknowledges the risks to fishing industry:

"In the area of commercial fishing generally, risks were identified in terms of stock
reduction,


displacement, product branding and sustainability certification."


"It seemed to be generally agreed that a price of around US$ 125 per tonne would
constitute a break-even point for the proposal.


Conclusion


Shareholders of OMEX have been completely left in the dark now since November about
why the company hasn't responded to SEMARNAT. This is similar to last summer when
there were repeated promises that the Oceanica EIA would be filed "shortly" which meant
many months of delays. Now with the project "suspended pending more information" at
SEMARNAT, it begs the question: Why would OMEX delay - now 80 days?


It would seem: Either


A) The SEMARNAT questions require costly test mining and field work environmental
testing which are beyond OMEX's financial capacity


B) The SEMARNAT questions are relatively simple and just require 'desk work' - in which
case why would it take 80 days?


or C) OMEX is deliberately delaying the process for some unknown reason. Do OMEX
insiders think that as soon as SEMARNAT officially rules on the project, it could all be over
including them being out of jobs?
