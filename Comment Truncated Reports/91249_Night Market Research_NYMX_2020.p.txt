NYMX


Despite repeatedly telling investors that it would file for approval, Nymox has never
filed a marketing application in the US and withdrew the application it claimed it
filed in Europe.


Nymox recently claimed it would file for approval in 1H20 but we are skeptical.


Resume of former employee validates concerns: we believe NYMX was never
close to filing an NDA or an adequate MAA, and will likely be unable to file anytime
soon.

Management Responds to Our Questions with Identical
Talking Points


New Evidence: Employee Resume


Nymox Corp (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:NYMX) has been developing NX-1207 for the
treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for the last 20 years. In 2014, two
pivotal Phase III trials missed their primary endpoint. Instead of conducting another set
of trials in consultation with the FDA and EMA, Nymox has pursued tangents for the last
5 years – reporting data from long-term extension studies (extremely unlikely to be
accepted by FDA as adequate evidence of efficacy), and claiming that approval filings
would be made in near future all while raising ~$35M through private placements.


We presented our concerns and questions to Nymox CFO Erik Danielsen twice. During
our first conversation in early 2019, Danielsen told us that Nymox was busy working
alongside experts on the large and complex tasks involved with filing an NDA and MAA.
When asked why Nymox had repeatedly missed its filing timelines in the past, he told us
this should be expected since Nymox was a small company and that regulatory filings
shouldn’t be rushed. We asked why Nymox has only ever done private placements and
he answered by describing a recent conversation he had with a banker:


“I just got off the phone with a Wall Street banker who wanted to raise money for us.
We have bankers calling us all the time. He proposed a deal with 100% warrant
coverage. We said no. We’d rather raise money with our loyal shareholders.”


He told us Nymox shares were a great value since other biotechs that have completed
Phase III trials in large indications were worth “billions of dollars.”


When we next spoke with him last month he again told us of a recent (“an hour ago”)
conversation with a banker who proposed a 100% warrant coverage secondary offering.
He also repeated the excuses for missing filing guidance and again said that Nymox
was working with experts and shares were cheap when compared with other biotechs
that have completed Phase III trials.


Danielsen’s identical talking points only added to our suspicion that Nymox was not
being completely transparent with investors about the true regulatory status of NX-1207,
but we lacked compelling direct evidence – until now.

We recently found an employee resume that we believe substantiates concerns about
Nymox's claims. Below is an excerpt:


Source: Nymox employee resume


Several things should be very concerning to Nymox investors:


This temporary employee was apparently the only person in Clinical
Operations, and they were only employed for six months. This during a time when
Nymox claimed it was working on an NDA, and years after Nymox claimed it filed
for decentralized approval in Europe.


The employee was tasked with creating an electronic Trial Master File (eTMF)
“from scratch”. A TMF is defined by the European Medicines Agency as a
“collection of essential documents that facilitates the conduct and management of
the clinical trial and allows that the integrity of the trial data and the compliance of
the trial with GCP can be evaluated.” It’s explicitly required by the EMA as part of a
marketing application. More background on TMFs can be found here. The FDA
requires healthcare companies to maintain compliance with standards set by the
International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), in
which there is an expectation of maintaining a TMF. From FDA guidance: “Trial
master files should be established at the beginning of a trial, both at the
investigator’s site and at the sponsor’s office.” The FDA further recommends,
“Essential documents should be retained until at least 2-years after the last
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region…”


The employee notes that 11 years of trial records were “contained in storage
boxes with no organization.” Recall this was 16 months after Nymox claimed it
filed for approval in five European countries. Were these applications actually filed?
If so, a TMF would have already been built and the trial records would have already
been organized. The only evidence of the European filing is a May 2017 Nymox
press release and a September 2017 press release announcing its validation.

We’ve presented Nymox with our findings and asked for corroborating evidence of
a European filing but as of publication haven’t received a response.


In July 2018, Nymox said in a press release it “expects to file for approval in the US
later in 2018.” It's difficult to reconcile this statement if records sat
unorganized in storage boxes and management only hired someone – a
single person - in September 2018 to create a TMF. Nymox management next
updated investors in October 2018, when it said “preparatory work for regulatory
filings on track.” We asked Nymox to comment on these inconsistencies but have
yet to receive a response.

The employee notes creating a TMF “from scratch” with “intent of filing an NDA in
the future”. It's curious an MAA isn't mentioned. Not only is it unsettling that Nymox
didn’t have a TMF in place and hadn’t even begun the process of assembling one
before this person was hired, it’s also concerning that the only apparent person in
Clinical Operations - the only employee creating the TMF - doesn’t mention an
MAA.


The employee worked in the “Quality Assurance” office Nymox opened in Irvine, CA
in August 2018. The person who answers the phone at Nymox’s Montreal office

gave us a number to the Irvine office which we have called multiple times. Nobody
has ever answered, and the number doesn’t go to voicemail.


We’ve reached out to the employee in case they were willing to discuss their experience
at Nymox but haven’t heard back.


Nymox's last private placement was done 13 months ago. This is the longest period of
time Nymox has gone without selling new shares since 2003. And Nymox’s largest
benefactor, 84-year old movie producer James Robinson, was a consistent buyer of
private placement and open market shares but hasn't bought any stock since July 2019.
Taken together with Nymox now guiding towards US and EU filings in 1H20, we believe
the larger investors have signaled an unwillingness to provide further funding until
Nymox files.
