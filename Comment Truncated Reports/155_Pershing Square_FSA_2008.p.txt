Ackman targets 3rd bond insurer
The activist investor who predicted trouble for Ambac and MBIA says the
nation's third-largest municipal bond insurer will end up in similar straits.

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- Bill Ackman, the activist investor
best known for his scorched-earth campaign against MBIA
and Ambac, has trained his sights on yet another
municipal bond insurer: Financial Security Assurance.


Ackman told a crowd of about 100 hedge fund managers
in New York Wednesday evening that, like MBIA (MBI)
and Ambac (ABK), FSA is an "example of what happens
when you start with a low-risk business, then add more
risk to get higher returns. A company will keep doing that
until it does something stupid." His remarks were delivered
following a panel discussion on the convergence of private
equity, real estate funds and hedge funds that was hosted
by the law firm Jones Day.


Since FSA was purchased in 2000 by the French bank Dexia, Ackman isn't shorting a stock, as he
did with MBIA and Ambac. Instead he is buying credit default swaps on FSA's bonds. This means
he is purchasing a type of insurance against the event of default. If the market were to decide that
FSA was troubled, the value of that insurance would rise as people rushed to buy the swaps.


FSA is the nation's third largest muni bond insurer, also known as a monoline insurer, just behind
MBIA at number one and Ambac at number two. However, the term monoline is now a bit of a
misnomer, as these companies long ago plunged into the much riskier business of guaranteeing
complex structured bonds. And to simplify Ackman greatly, this is why these companies are in
trouble.


Traditionally, monolines insured municipal bonds, which had very low default rates. The insurance
made it a bit cheaper for local governments to borrow money, and in turn the insurance companies
had sterling reputations and the very highest credit ratings. This allowed them to ink a lot of
contracts and keep a relatively low amount of cash on hand.


But structured finance has proven to be a very risky business with plenty of defaults, and now
Ackman says FSA, like its competitors, does not have the capital necessary to make good on its
riskiest contracts.


While Standard & Poor's has downgraded MBIA and Ambac, it has preserved FSA's AAA credit
rating.


"The market has not woken up to FSA because people still depend on the ratings agencies to do
due diligence," says Ackman. He adds that the only legitimate bond insurance company working
today is Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A).


It seems peculiar that Ackman might choose now to go after FSA (particularly since there's no stock
to actually short) given that he has studied the monolines carefully since 2002.


When asked about this lag, Ackman said that it takes time to find the hard information he needs to
decide to take a short position. While that may be the case, it's worth noting that his decision to
highlight possible problems at yet another monoline brings more scrutiny to bear on a group of
companies that he wants to see trade lower.


In response to Ackman's comments, FSA said that it had "avoided the pitfalls of the current market,"
and that it would "do what it takes to maintain and build our position."


Ackman, the founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, rose to prominence as
one of the first people from any corner of Wall Street to say that MBIA would run into severe

Unlike MBIA and Ambac, FSA has
preserved its AAA credit rating.

problems because of its decision to move beyond its core municipal bond insurance into
guaranteeing structured securities.


His predictions about insurers like MBIA, Ambac and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. (FGIC)
were made long before asset-backed securities began to default. Ackman's saber rattling began
long before the credit maelstrom that has destroyed banks, wiped out profits and seriously
damaged the bond insurers. He said that the monolines didn't have enough money to cover the
insurance contracts they had written on structured finance products.


But Ackman was clearly onto something. Since January of 2002, MBIA shares have plummeted to
$6 from $54; Ambac has plunged to $2 from $60. Ackman says he'll give the money he's made
shorting these stocks to Pershing Square's charitable foundation. Though he has made a bundle,
he continues to hammer them.


The ratings agencies, always slower than the market to react to a company's changed fortunes, are
starting to catch on. In the past few weeks, Standard & Poor has cut its rating on MBIA and Ambac
from AAA to AA; and Moody's has put both companies on review for a possible downgrade. FGIC,
which was AAA just this January, was downgraded to BB by S&P.


Ratings downgrades on the monolines are particularly troubling since they impact the prices of
anything the companies insure. In addition to creating kinks in the municipal bond market, the
downgrades have an even more severe impact on structured bonds, securities that are much
harder to rate than the health of a city or county.


"In our view, the impact of the downgrades on the structured finance market is widespread," says
S&P in a report released this month. "Roughly 1,600 tranches, representing around $350 billion of
original issuance, are affected. Securities supported by MBIA account for 40% of the issues and
44% of the dollar amount, while securities supported by Ambac account for the remaining 60% of
the issues and 56% of the dollar amount."


Well-respected as he is in many circles for his call on the monolines, Ackman has not always been
a golden boy. After he published his MBIA findings, then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
investigated whether Ackman had engaged in manipulative trading on the stock. The Securities and
Exchange Commission followed with its own investigation. Both cases were dropped without any
finding of wrongdoing.


More recently, he has made big long bets on under-performing companies including Target (TGT,
Fortune 500) and Sears (SHLD, Fortune 500), saying that all of them are misunderstood and
undervalued by Wall Street. Target has treaded water since the beginning of the year and Sears
has fallen from $106 to $80.
