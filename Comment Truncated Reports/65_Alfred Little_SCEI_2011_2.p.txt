Evidence Proves SCEI Chairman Fabricated Production Videos

Editor's note: On May 11, Sino Clean Energy published information on its website in
response to questions raised in the article below (see here). On May 12, a second
Seeking Alpha contributor examined Mr. Little's evidence and the company's, and drew his
own conclusions (here).


:::::::::::::


On May 3 , Sino Clean Energy (NASDAQ: SCEI) Chairman Baowen Ren published a
letter to shareholders in which he attempted to rebut four months of video surveillance of
SCEI’s three coal water slurry fuel (CWSF) factories that showed little or no production. At
the core of Ren’s rebuttal were 10 days of his own security camera videos from SCEI’s
Tongchuan plant, spanning April 20  – 29 .


I spent last week conducting a thorough analysis of Ren’s videos and uncovered two
absolute proofs they were filmed sometime after the dates he claimed. My findings
detailed in this report prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the production activity in
Ren’s films was staged.


First Proof: Ren Installed the Security Camera After the Fact


IFRA surveillance of SCEI’s Tongchuan facility began in January and continued up until
April 26 . Ren claims his videos were shot by his security camera and time-stamped from
April 20  – 29 . Did Ren really have a security camera installed on those dates? It is
certainly not visible in any of the IFRA surveillance footage through April 26 .


The following time-lapse still was taken on April 26  at 7:45am:

Zooming in on the factory itself, there is no sign of a security camera:


From these pictures and dozens more in the IFRA archive I reviewed I questioned
whether Ren’s camera even existed. So to find the truth I sent one of my investigators to
secretly photograph the factory on May 7  to get a closer look. To my surprise, the
investigator found a large security camera attached to the buiding as shown below:

Here is a close up of Ren’s new security camera (the wire connecting the camera is also
visible):


Since Ren's security camera does not appear in any of the IFRA images, he did not install
the camera until sometime after 4/26 and probably after 4/28, the date I published my first
report (link here). Therefore his production videos from 4/20-4/29 could not possibly have
been filmed on the dates he claimed since he had no camera set up on those dates. Why
then should anyone believe his videos are real?

A sample screen shot from Ren’s April 23  video is below:


You can tell from the angle of the camera that this video was filmed from the new security
camera attached to the building as seen in my May 7  image. However, on April 23  no
such camera existed. This video and the other videos must be fake.


Second Proof: Most of Ren’s Videos Were Filmed in the Rain. What Rain?


This is easy to prove. Let’s start with easiest video to debunk, the 4/23 14:08 camera 1
video, a still from which is shown above. The ground is all wet. The same soaked scenery
is apparent in the 4/23 08:55 camera 1 video that morning. Why was it raining in Ren’s
videos? April 23  was a bright and sunny day in Tongchuan without a drop of rain
according to the official record of the Tongchuan City Meteorological Bureau (interview
transcript here and recording of the call here). IFRA’s surveillance video of the bright and
sunny April 23  (linked here) showed no rain. No trucks appeared either. The Tongchuan
plant again showed little or no signs of production.


In fact the weather bureau staff reported absolutely no rain in Tongchuan after 4pm on
April 20  until 8am on May 1  when it rained until 8pm. If Ren’s videos are really from
April 20  – 29 , a period in which Tongchuan received no rain, why is there rain in 14 of
his videos? (the table below includes links to Ren’s videos I uploaded Vimeo to make
viewing easier)

* After heavy rain at 12:00am the ground was completely dry at 05:48am


Another serious inconsistency in the time sequence is the fact that the ground was dry at
5:48am on April 22  following heavy rain at midnight (April 22nd Midnight and April 22nd
05:48am). It is impossible for the ground to dry out that fast during the night!

Together the evidence proves Ren’s videos were not filmed during the dry April 20-29
period as claimed. I believe the only possible conclusion is that sometime after April 29
(the date in China he read my first report) Ren set up a security camera at the Tongchuan
factory, rented some trucks and staged production activities for the new camera in an
attempt to “debunk” IFRA’s surveillance record to get SCEI’s stock price higher. Ren’s
rainy videos were thus filmed on May 1 , when it rained from 8am to 8pm. The rest of
Ren’s videos may have been filmed a day earlier or a day after, but definitely not during
the April 20  – 29  period as he claims.


Further analysis of the videos:


IFRA’s video analyst notes that there appear to really be only 2 CWSF tankers in most of
the videos. In the 4/23 14:08 camera 1 video these two tankers appear to drive in circles
onto the scale. The 1 , 3 , and 5  tankers are the same truck. The 2  and 4  tankers
are the same truck. Loop the video for yourself a couple times and you can easily verify
this.


In addition to filming the weigh station, IFRA’s camera captures images of the factory,
itself. IFRA’s surveillance videos spanning January to April show the factory is always dark
at night, a fact verified by IFRA’s team at the beginning of the project.


During the first few weeks of observing the Tongchuan plant in January, IFRA field agents
determined the plant’s operating hours were 8am (when workers first showed up) to
around 6:30pm (when workers went home). After dark the factory is just that, dark. No
lights can be seen coming from the factory and no trucks pass through the scales. IFRA
let its cameras run until around 10pm in January and February and midnight in March and
April.


In addition to the rainy weather proof that Ren’s videos were fabricated, a comparison of
two of Ren’s night videos that appear to show production activity inside the plant are
contradicted by IFRA’s videos from the same time showing the plant was dark. Compare
Ren’s 4/21/11 21:42 Camera 2 and 4/26/11 20:15 Camera 2 to IFRA’s April 21st and April
26th videos. Ren’s videos appear to show production inside a lighted factory at night.
IFRA’s videos show darkness inside factory during the same times, each night.


Similarly, Ren’s following videos showing tankers being weighed on the scales are
contradicted by IFRA’s videos from the same time showing no tankers passing through the
scales:
