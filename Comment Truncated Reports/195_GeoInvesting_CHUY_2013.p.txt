Chuy's Trading At Unsustainable Multiples
Apr. 11, 2013 10:00 AM ET15 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Overview of Company


Chuy's Holdings (NASDAQ:CHUY), through its wholly owned subsidiary, Chuy's Opco,
Inc., owns and operates Chuy's, a full-service restaurant offering a distinct menu of
authentic, freshly-prepared Mexican and Tex Mex inspired food. The menu has few items
over $10 and the average check is around $13. The company launched its business in
Texas in 1982 but did not start to expand its operations until 2006. CHUY has added 22
restaurants since 2009, including 8 in 2012 and currently operates 39 restaurants in 8
states. The company's management plans to add another 8 to 9 restaurants in 2013 and
have 75 operating by 2016.


The company completed the initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock in July
2012. CHUY issued 6,708,332 shares, including 874,999 shares sold to the underwriters
pursuant to their overallotment option. The company received net proceeds from the
offering of approximately $63 million after the $19 million one-time special dividend to
preferred shareholders (mainly insiders). The net proceeds from the offering were also
used to repay approximately $60 million of outstanding debt under its old bank credit
facility. Since the IPO, the company secured a new $25 million revolving credit facility and
drew on it to pay off the $5.0 million balance on its old credit facility.


In this article, we discuss factors that led us to conclude that CHUY's current valuation,
partly supported by little liquidity for its stock, does not take into account significant risks,
all of which should give current or prospective investors pause.


Insiders are liquidating most of their stock holdings;
CHUY boasts a P/E of 49X estimated 2013 EPS despite the fact that it expected to
report flat 2013 non-GAAP EPS growth;
CHUY trades at 25X its EV/EBITDA while its peers trade at 8 to 12X;
P.F. Chang's, with better metrics and product offerings, went private in early 2012 at an
EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.5X;
EV/restaurant of $14.4 million is 5X the capex and start-up costs of the average
restaurant; and
CHUY is now a public company that in many ways is still managed as a privately-held
business. No less than 20 related transactions are disclosed in SEC filings, many of

which we feel should have been renegotiated or terminated as part of the IPO
(cleansing) process.


CHUY's Share Price Is Supported by Relatively Few Shares in the Float and Low
Liquidity


Since going public on July 25, 2012 (priced at $13.00), CHUY has benefited not only from
a very favorable market environment for the restaurant sector but, perhaps more
importantly, a low public float and little liquidity for its shares. The circumstances, however,
changed when in January of 2013, the company registered 5,175,000 shares in a Form S-
1 filing that became effective on January 24, 2013. Those shares, priced at around
$25.00, will likely find their way into the market as purchasers look to lock in profits, given
the recent rise in the share price to over $30. More telling is that JP Morgan, CHUY's
underwriter of the IPO, used the secondary offering to sell most of its stake in the
company, and insiders liquidated roughly 50% of their equity positions. JP Morgan and
insiders are not done selling yet. As part of a proposed 3.5 million share secondary
offering filed on April 8, 2013, JP Morgan and insiders plan to sell more shares.


To sum it up, in less than a year, upon the closing of the April 2013 secondary, insiders will
have essentially blown out of most of their common stock:


After the July IPO, the insiders beneficially owned approximately 62.6% of outstanding
common stock; and
Following the January 24, 2013 secondary offering, insiders owned approximately
31.4% of outstanding common stock.


The April 8, 2013 prospectus discloses that insiders will only own 9.9% of CHUY
common stock following the offering. When insiders are selling this much stock, should we
be buying?


CHUY is a Prime Short Candidate - Valuation is Stretched by Any Reasonable
Measure


We view CHUY as extremely overvalued. Using any reasonable measure, whether by
EPS multiples or enterprise value, the same result is attained. At a P/E of 49 and 40 on
2013 and 2014 analyst EPS estimates, respectively, we believe CHUY is trading at a large
premium to its fundamentals and all of its peers - especially when one considers that
CHUY's 2013 non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to be unexciting from 2012 and that its
overall growth profile is in line with several of its top performing comps. CHUY's EV to
EBITDA of 27 vs. peers' EV to EBITDA ranging from 8 to 12 is the most glaring valuation

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1333971-chuys-trading-at-unsustainable-multiples 3/17


metric that points to CHUY's overvaluation. We believe that CHUY's premium valuation is
in part being supported by euphoria stemming from a cult-type following that it has been
able to garner from its patrons, as evidenced from numerous positive reviews on sites like
Yelp.com. However, it is only a matter of time before the market will price CHUY on par
with some of its peers. We don't think the company's shares will be able to sustain the
current trading price of over $30. It wouldn't surprise us if CHUY ultimately settled in a
trading range at half of its current price. As an overview, consider the following business
metrics and how CHUY stacks up against other restaurant chains such as Texas
Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH), Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT), Bravo Brio
Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:BBRG), BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI), Ignite
Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:IRG), Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE), Red Robin
Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (NASDAQ:RRGB), Ruby Tuesday, Inc. (NYSE:RT) and Fiesta
Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:FRGI):


EPS Multiples Are High vs. Industry Peers' Projected Performance and Multiples


CHUY's lofty 49X forward EPS, based on the recent share price of around $33.00 and
management's 2013 EPS guidance of $0.66 to $0.69, is not sustainable.


Our own modeling of CHUY's business indicates modest EPS growth despite the
anticipated increase in the number of restaurants from 38 to 75 by 2016. The modest EPS
growth is due to CHUY's high operating costs as a percentage of revenues. From 2009 to
2012, operating costs ranged from 90% to 93% of revenues.

The following table shows our projections. Keep in mind that they do not fully account for
risks such as increased food and labor costs, nor do they consider the prospect of future
share issuances to raise capital to pay down debt that may accumulate as the company
incurs capex for new restaurants (assuming around $2.4 million per restaurant). Overall,
we were conservative in our assumptions, leading to a better bottom line growth profile
than those communicated by analysts. But the conclusion is still the same; CHUY is
trading well ahead of its growth.


Although the accuracy of future financial projections cannot be assured, CHUY's business
metrics are pretty well locked in and predictable to a great extent. However, as previously
noted there are variables in the business model that will likely work out to be worse than
one might logically assume today. For example, will the proposed increase in the minimum
wage from $7.25 to $10 be approved? Even a lesser adjustment in the minimum wage
would increase CHUY's labor costs and negatively impact margins. Not only would
CHUY's direct labor costs increase but input costs for food and other consumables used in
the business would increase as well. Of course, the company could raise prices to offset

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1333971-chuys-trading-at-unsustainable-multiples 5/17


higher costs, but that might reduce traffic given that the average check is already around
$13 and has remained relatively stable in recent years. It is therefore inevitable that costs
will rise over time, and we doubt the company has pricing power to fully offset increased
costs.


CHUY's $500+ Million Enterprise Value


Enterprise value, or EV, measures a company's value based on market cap plus debt,
minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. This is the
theoretical takeover price of the enterprise since an acquirer would have to take on and
eventually pay the company's debt, but would keep its cash. CHUY's enterprise value is
currently around $546 million based on the recent market price of $33 and projected
shares outstanding for 2013 of around 16.7 million. In CHUY's case, debt and cash more
or less offset one another.


The Ratio of Enterprise Value to EBITDA Far Exceeds Peers


CHUY is currently trading at 25X its EV/EBITDA while its peers trade at 8 to 12.5X. We
are hard pressed to think of any market sector, other than perhaps biotech, that would
trade at such multiples. Even if we use projected 2016 EBITDA, when CHUY will be
operating twice as many restaurants, it will still have an EV/EBITDA ratio of 12X… and
keep in mind that is three years down the road.


Enterprise Value per Restaurant Excessive


CHUY boasts an enterprise value of $15.6 million per restaurant based on $546 million EV
divided by 35 equivalent/full year restaurants (assuming the 8 added in 2012 were
operating for 6 months each). Management reports that EBITDA at the restaurant level is
20% of revenue which implies $1.0 million based on average revenue of approximately
$5.0 million per location. That means investors are paying nearly 15X EBITDA for each
restaurant. A truer measure of earnings per restaurant, though, would be achieved by
factoring in unallocated corporate overhead costs that totaled nearly $15 million in 2012 or
over $430,000 per location. Using an EBITDA/restaurant after allocating overhead costs
yields $570,000 EBITDA/location, meaning the market is really paying 25x EBITDA for
each location. Either way, paying 15X or 25X EBITDA per location is excessive.


Enterprise Value/Cost per Restaurant


CHUY invests around $2.4 million in capex and over $430,000 in pre-opening costs for
each new restaurant. So each new location costs $2.8 million to build, promote and get up
and running. The market is currently valuing that investment at $15.6 million or over 5X
5/23/2018 Chuy's Trading At Unsustainable Multiples - Chuy's Holdings (NASDAQ:CHUY) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1333971-chuys-trading-at-unsustainable-multiples 6/17


the company's average restaurant capex and startup costs. As points of comparison,
consider the following EV/Cost per restaurant ratios; EAT (0.5), CAKE (1.5) and FRGI
(2.2). What does CHUY possibly have that makes its restaurants so much more valuable
than its peers' establishments? We see nothing to justify such a valuation.


What would a Potential Acquirer Pay for CHUY's Business?


To put CHUY's current valuation into perspective, we looked at a recent transaction that
took a restaurant chain private. P.F. Chang's went private in early 2012 at an EV/EBITDA
multiple of 8.5X. At that time, they received a 30% premium over the market price of the
shares. P.F. Chang's had 400 stores operating and averaged EBITDA/Store of $350,000,
significantly less than the $570,000 EBITDA/Store (adjusted for overhead allocations)
Chuy's restaurants generate. P.F. Chang's also had more infant revenue streams when it
went private, including frozen food items made available in grocery stores and another
restaurant chain.


Giving due consideration to its growth prospects, if we assume a higher 10x
(EV/estimated 2013 EBITDA) valuation for CHUY, then with 16.7 million shares
outstanding, we calculate an enterprise value of $260 million and an implied share price of
$15.00. Even if we use the 2016 forecasted EBITDA with the same assumptions we get
an enterprise value of $429 million, implying a share price of $25.70, and that's nearly
three years from now. It seems a stretch given the risks inherent in the business model of
any restaurant chain to assume CHUY can "grow" into its current valuation.


CHUY's Principal Stockholders Exert Great Influence Over Corporate Matters and
Transactions


Prior to the recent secondary offerings, Chuy's was defined as a "controlled company,"
meaning that is was not required to have an independent board because a majority of the
shares were not aggregated in the public float. In fact, the board controlled the majority of
voting shares. CHUY is no longer considered a controlled company after certain insiders
and related parties sold 5,175,000 shares in a public offering made effective in January
2013. Although CHUY is no longer a controlled company, principal stockholders still
influence significant control over the company. Cutting to the chase, what is in their best
interest may not be in the interest of public stockholders. The following is from the Form S-
1/A that became effective in January 2013:

"As of January 18, 2013, Goode Chuy's Holdings, LLC, our controlling stockholder,
and its affiliates, and MY/ZP Equity LP, which is controlled by our founders Mike
Young and John Zapp, own approximately 49.6%, and 5.6%, respectively, of our
outstanding common stock. Our controlling stockholder also has the right to vote an
additional 1,340,791 shares of our common stock under a voting agreement entered
into among us, our controlling stockholder, MY/ZP Equity LP and other stockholders,
which will terminate upon consummation of this offering. Upon the completion of this
offering and the termination of the voting agreement, Goode Chuy's Holdings, LLC
and its affiliates and MY/ZP Equity LP are expected to own approximately 25.6%
and 2.9%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock, or 22.7% and 2.6%,
respectively, if the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is fully
exercised. Because Goode Chuy's Holdings, LLC will collectively own less than 50%
of the total voting power of our common stock, we will no longer be a controlled
company within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards upon completion of this
offering. See "Risk Factors-Although we will not be a controlled company within the
meaning of the Nasdaq Marketplace rules upon the completion of this offering,
during the phase-in period we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain
corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other
companies." However, as a result of their significant ownership and voting
power with respect to our common stock, Goode Chuy's Holdings, LLC and
MY/ZP Equity LP will continue to have significant influence over corporate
matters and transactions and may have interests that differ from yours. See
"Risk Factors-Our Sponsor will continue to have significant influence over us
after this offering, including over decisions that require the approval of
stockholders, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key
transactions. Our Founders may also continue to exert significant control over
us."


Principle Stockholders who effectively Control CHUY:


Goode Partners


Goode Partners was co-founded by Joe Ferreira and David Oddi. Messrs. Ferreira and
Oddi are also board members of Chuy's. Mr. Ferreira is the Chairman of the Board,
Treasurer, Chairman of the Compensation Committee, and on both the Audit Committee
and Corporate Governance Committee. If he obtained the majority vote from the board, he

could then take control of Chuy's or influence and even control the CEO through his role
as Chairman of the Compensation Committee. Michael Stanley is the Vice President of
Goode Partners and also serves on the board of Chuy's.


Three Star Management GP, MY/ZP IP Group, Ltd, Three Star Management, Ltd


Three Star Management ("TSM") is an entity owned by Chuy's co-founders John Zapp
and Michael Young. Mr. Zapp is a Board Member, Chairman of the Corporate Governance
Committee, and on the Compensation Committee. Mr. Young is also a Board Member, on
the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and is also Chairman of the Corporate
Governance Committee.


The Ability of Insiders and Related Parties to Influence Key Transactions Matters


It is human nature for people to do what is perceived to be in their own best interest
(which may or may not be in your best interest). Given Chuy's long operating history
before the IPO and the influence that co-founders, insiders and other related parties had
over the company and its operations, there is a long list of legacy transactions that are not
in the best interests of CHUY's current stockholders. The following is a list of such
transactions imposed, as disclosed in the recent Form S-1A filing (descriptions of
transactions available on pages 98 - 102 in filing):

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


The following is a summary of transactions that occurred on or were in effect after
January 1, 2009 to which we have been a party in which the amount involved
exceeded $120,000 and in which any of our executive officers, directors or beneficial
holders of more than 5% of our capital stock had or will have a direct or indirect
material interest.

To illustrate our point further, the following are the particulars of two of the related party
transactions listed above:

Loan from related party with excessive interest: TSM loaned Chuy's Holding
Inc. $1.7 million in September 2007 @ 15% interest per annum, amortized
monthly. Over the 26 month term of the loan TSM collected $322,000 interest.
That's nearly $150,000 more than the company would have paid under their
existing credit facility. See "Bonus Payments and Related Note Payable to
Founders" listed above.
Properties leased from related party at above market rents: TSM owns the
building that Chuy's leases for their headquarters and six of the "Heritage"
Chuy's Locations. The following from the recent Form S-1A filing noted above;
"We lease our corporate office space as well as our North Lamar, River Oaks,
Highway 183, Round Rock, Shenandoah and Arbor Trails properties from
subsidiaries of Young/Zapp, a company owned 47.5% by each of our Founders
and 5.0% by Sharon Russell. In 2012, we paid Young/Zapp $112,598, $229,912,
$434,778, $490,676, $457,046, $288,476, and $308,548, which includes rent
and a percentage of gross sales in excess of our base rent, with respect to
our headquarters, North Lamar, River Oaks, Hwy 183, Round Rock, Shenandoah
and Arbor Trails locations, respectively.


…"


Based on an average square footage per restaurant of 8,000 sq. ft., we can calculate that
the $2.2 million paid to TSM for six restaurant locations in 2012 works out to $46.00/sq. ft.
Separately, we derived that the rents paid for CHUY's other locations averaged around
$27.50/sq. ft. That means the company is paying related parties excess rent of as much
as $18.50/sq. ft. Assuming 6 stores with 8,000 sq. ft. X $18.50/sq. ft., the company might
be paying $888,000/year in rents over fair market price.


Company Intends to Implement Controls over Related Party Transactions - But the
Horse is Already out of the Barn!


Now that CHUY is a public company, management intends to adopt a written policy
regarding related party transactions, but the horse is already out of the barn.
Management's noble declaration of intent to control related party transactions is no doubt
due to heat from shareholders who are aware of the long laundry list of transactions. The
following is from page 102 of CHUY's recent S-1A filing:

Related Party Transactions Policy


We intend to adopt a written policy relating to the approval of related party
transactions. Our audit committee will review certain financial transactions,
arrangements and relationships between us and any of the following related parties
to determine whether any such transaction, arrangement or relationship is a related
party transaction:


any of our directors, director nominees or executive officers;
any beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding stock; and
any immediate family member of any of the foregoing.


Our audit committee will review any financial transaction, arrangement or
relationship that:


involves or will involve, directly or indirectly, any related party identified above
and is in an amount greater than $120,000;
would cast doubt on the independence of a director;
would present the appearance of a conflict of interest between us and the related
party; or
is otherwise prohibited by law, rule or regulation.


The audit committee will review each such transaction, arrangement or relationship
to determine whether a related party has, has had or expects to have a direct or
indirect material interest. Following its review, the audit committee will take such
action as it deems necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, including
approving, disapproving, ratifying, canceling or recommending to management how
to proceed if it determines a related party has a direct or indirect material interest in
a transaction, arrangement or relationship with us. Any member of the audit
committee who is a related party with respect to a transaction under review will not
be permitted to participate in the discussions or evaluations of the transaction;
however, the audit committee member will provide all material information
concerning the transaction to the audit committee. The audit committee will report its
action with respect to any related party transaction to the board of directors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1333971-chuys-trading-at-unsustainable-multiples 12/17


In our view, management is giving lip service to the issue of related party transactions.
Those who personally benefit from the transactions have too much influence and control
over the company for us to take management's declaration seriously. If management truly
wants to win the confidence of public stockholders we would suggest that they not only
adopt the specified policies but also renegotiate some of the more material related party
transactions that remain in force, starting with the leases with TSM for headquarters and
six operating locations. Anything short of that will not sway our view that the interests of
CHUY's public shareholders are being trumped by the interests of insiders and related
parties.


Other Issues


CHUY's Inability to Use Chuy's Brand in Nevada, California and Arizona


Reading RISK FACTORS in SEC filings might make most investors' eyes glaze over.
Many dismiss risks as unlikely events that public companies are forced to disclose.
Investors might, however, want to take a look at CHUY's risk factors detailed on pages 15
to 34 in a recent Form S-1A that became effective in January 2013. Among the
disclosures is the following that notifies investors that the company may not use the brand
"Chuy's" in Nevada, California and Arizona. It seems to us that these are three prime
states where CHUY's should want a presence.

"We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in
turn, could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.


Our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability
to build brand recognition in the areas surrounding our locations using our
trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our brand names,
logos and the unique ambience of our restaurants. We have registered or applied to
register a number of our trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark
applications will be approved. Also, as a result of the settlement agreement with
an unaffiliated entity, Baja Chuy's, we may not use "Chuy's" in Nevada,
California or Arizona, which may have an adverse effect on our growth plans
in these states. Additionally, our brand value may be diluted as a result of their use
of "Chuy's" in these states. Third parties may also oppose our trademark
applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our
trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our goods
and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to
devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands.


…"


Conclusion


We have deep concerns about the valuation the market has placed on CHUY. The stock
has recently been trading in the low $30 range, representing an unsustainably lofty 49X
estimated 2013 EPS with EV that is 25X EBITDA.


As indicated in our report, insiders seem to agree that CHUY is overvalued and are
dumping the vast majority of their holdings. According to the last 2 S-1 filings, insiders
have gone from owning 62.6% of company shares as of December 2012 to as little as
9.9% following the latest offering. As we have said, there is nothing wrong with insiders
cashing in on their investments, but the magnitude of their exodus only gives us more
reason to be bearish on CHUY at these very lofty valuations.


We are also concerned about obvious risk factors such as increased labor costs driven by
an inevitable upward adjustment in the minimum wage. The only questions are when and
by how much labor costs go up. Investors should note that increased wages will not only
impact direct labor costs but other input costs for food and other consumables used in the
