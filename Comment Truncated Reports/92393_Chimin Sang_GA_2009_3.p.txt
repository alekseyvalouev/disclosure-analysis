Earnings Analysis Services China


Giant Interactive (NYSE:GA), a Chinese online
gaming company, issued its earning release
Thursday night. The revenue, $40.4m, came slightly
below the Street estimate, $41m, and the EPS, 12
cents, a notch above the consensus, 11 cents.
Based on the earning report and what I heard from
the conference call, I believe that Giant Interactive is
currently fairly valued between $7 and $8 and the stock has a higher chance to go
higher than lower.


As I mentioned in my earlier analysis after the Q3 results, Giant's flagship product, ZT
online, was plagued by the revenue loss due to closing of certain gambling features.
Giant Interactive was making some changes, and one of them, launching ZT online
Green Version, seems to take effect.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy and these new Tech Kings are leading the way


The most recent earning report revealed further reduction in ARPU, but higher ACU
(Average Current User) and higher APA (Active Paying Account). Typically in the FTP
(Free to Play) online gaming model, ACU leads APA, which leads the revenue number.
So I am expecting the future revenue to improve. According to the management, a
quarter-over-quarter revenue increase is expected in Q1 2010 since they have observed
a positive trend.


Further, I believe that the company has a right COO, Ji Xuefeng, for the job. It is unclear
how innovative this person is, but he has been changing ZT online in the right direction.
First he introduced a Green version, which is targeted to players with limited budgets.
Second, he is migrating the existing ZT online into the same direction. It appears that
these moves have stopped the revenue bleeding.


With the assumption of flat to slight positive revenue growth in sight and new games
being introduced, I can make a reasonable estimation for the company's value.


The balance sheet shows that the whole equity line is as good as cash -- the only non
cash equivalent items in the assets can be more than offset by the deferred revenue line
in the liability. The deferred revenue will be mostly transferred to equity line in the next
two quarters. So we can count $865 cash equivalent position.


The company can run on the deferred revenue alone and its net income has very little to
do with the current assets item. In 2009, the net income of the company amounted to
$125 million. It is reasonable to pay 6x - 8x for the cash generation power, assuming no
growth.


This gives us 1.6 billion USD to 1.8 billion USD for the market cap, or $6.9 - $7.8 per
share. Based on this, I believe the company is quite fairly valued as of now on a
conservative assumption. $7 should be its bottom.


Future verification of improved game performance or new successful game introduction
could drive the stock price higher, while misuse of its cash is the main negative risk.

the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.
