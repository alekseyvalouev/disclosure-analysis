Summary 


In this research report, we present concrete evidences 


showing that the majority of the revenue and net income 


of China Household since its backdoor listing is fabricated. 


We found material discrepancy between the financial 


figures disclosed by China Household and SAIC & Tax 


filings. Our physical inspection shows that its major 


business, sales of household furniture, has ceased 


operation long ago. We conclude that the only possible 


fate of China Household is to be delisted from the market. 





1. Acquisitions that can never meet profit guarantee 


China Household has been acquiring numerous 


companies with almost no tangible net asset at a high 


premium. Although these acquisitions came with profit 


guarantees and China Household disclosed that these 


profit guarantees are mostly met, all three separate 


sources, i.e. SAIC fillings, local tax filings and public 


overdue tax records, show that the actual net income of 


these acquired targets are all minimal. Nearly RMB 400 


million of net income was fabricated from 2013 to 2016 


from these acquired companies. 





2. Material discrepancy with SAIC and tax filings 


We compared the revenue and total tax amount filed in 


SAIC and tax filings of all subsidiaries with the disclosed 


revenue and PRC tax expense of China Household, and 


found that at least nearly 60% of the reported revenue 


was fabricated from 2013 to 2016. Actual tax paid is at 


most 13% of the tax expense reported in annual report. 





3. Physical inspection shows no point of sales 


Our investigators visited China Household’s head office 


and its retail shops in Zhongshan, and found that one of 


the two retail shops it owns has already been closed, and

the another one does not sell any furniture anymore. Moreover, China Household’s employees 


confirmed to us that China Household do not sell furniture anymore, and its head office has 


already been occupied by another company. We further inspected other selling channels of China 


Household, including its distributors and online stores, and found that China Household almost 


has no sales in furniture. 





4. Numerous red flags on fabricated cash 


Although China Household reported it has around HK$ 400 million cash in 2015, its interest 


income is as low as HK$ 0.2 million. The interest rate of China Household on its cash is as low as 


0.06%. Moreover, it has been issuing numerous convertible bonds even with a large pile of cash. 


It has not paid any dividend since its backdoor listing in 2013. We believe it is highly possible that 


the cash balance is fabricated. 





5. Stock price manipulation with over 90 brokerage accounts 


We have obtained the internal documents of China Household and found that the controlling 


shareholder has over 90 brokerage accounts to hold his shares and manipulate stock price. The 


controlling shareholder actually holds more than 60% of the shareholding while disclosing only 


13%, to prevent the trigger of mandatory general offer and reverse takeover. We found that 


almost half of the turnover of China Household’s market comes from brokerage accounts 


controlled by the controlling shareholder, and we observed the phenomenon of wash trade 


between these accounts. 





6. The aerospace project that can never materialize 


China Household has been emphasizing on an aerospace project recently. We analyzed the 


feasibility of such a project, and concluded that the project is highly infeasible. We found that the 


lands purchased by China Household for the development of the project to have no commercial 


value, and the project has already been abandoned for five years before the recent emphasize by 


management. 





7. Notorious auditor 


The auditor of China Household, Elite Partners, is notorious in Hong Kong market. It has replaced 


17 resigned auditors of Hong Kong listed companies since 2016, and more than half of these 


companies have certain issues revealed by the former auditors. 





In conclusion, given the extraordinary extent of fraud of China Household and the large 


amount of evidences we collected, we believe that the only fate of China Household is to 


be prosecuted by SFC and delisted from the market, just like China Metal Recycling. A 


valuation is unnecessary, since its intrinsic value is zero in our opinion. We also recommend 


all investors to avoid trading of China Household, since the active market is just a delusion.

Introduction 





China Household Holdings Limited (“China Household”) is a company that sells household 


furniture in PRC. It was listed in Hong Kong Exchange with the stock code of 00692 through 


backdoor listing in 2012 December. 





China Household’s former name is Bao Yuan Holdings Limited (“Bao Yuan”), a very famous 


company specialized in financial trick such as rights issue to deprive rights of shareholders. There 


have been three share consolidations, with the ratio of 50-to-1, 20-to-1 and 20-to-1, two rights 


issues with the ratio of 1:8 and 1:22, one open offer with the ratio of 2:7 and 5 share placements 


from 2010 to 2012. Even if you held 50.0% of the shareholding at the start of 2010, your 


shareholding will be reduced to 0.0% at the end of 2012 without selling one share. Fortunately, in 


2013, Mr. Li Zhixiong (“Mr. Li”) took over the company and the company changed name to China 


Household. 





On 2012 Dec 14, Bao Yuan announced the very substantial acquisition of Chang Ye Holdings 


Limited, which indirectly held Zhongshan City Prado Style Household Company Limited (“Prado”), 


from Mr. Kuang Yuan Wei, a close friend of Mr. Li, at HK$ 60 million. The transaction was 


completed on 2013 Jan 3. Bao Yuan than proposed to change name to China Household on 2013 


Jan 8. 





Since then, Prado constitutes most of the revenue of China Household. China Household main 


business then became sales of household furniture in PRC, including home furnishing solution 


and wooden product:

The main distribution channels of China Household’s furniture include the two retails stores in 


Zhongshan, distributors in other regions called operating centers, and online stores. It has also 


acquired several furniture-related companies after the injection of Prado.

Website: www.blazing-research.com / Email: blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch 


Although the reported net income is negative since 2014, it is mainly due to impairment of assets 


acquired before 2013. By adjusting the impairment cost, China Household has quite a profitable 


business from 2013 to 2015. 





On 2016 Oct 29, China Household announced the new development strategy of Shenzhou Space 


Park Project in ZhongShan. It proposed to acquire certain lands in Zhongshan for the development 


of Shenzhou Space Park Project at HK$ 13.5 billion. According to China Household’s disclosure, 


the China Aerospace-Themed Tourism Township Project is the first interactive, intelligent and 


aerospace-themed tourism town in China. It is located in Shenwan Town, Zhongshan City, 


Guangdong province with a total site area of 750,000 square meters. 





In this research report, we will investigate China Household from multiple perspectives to discover 


the truth of its business, including the authenticity of its reported financial statements, commercial 


existence of its furniture products, analysis on its numerous acquisitions, trading activities, etc. We 


have used substantial amount of time to collect large amount of evidences, and came to 


the conclusion that almost all of its furniture business does not exist, and the controlling 


shareholder of China Household has been manipulating the stock price for years. We believe 


the extent of fraud of China Household can be compared to China Metal Recycling, and our 


evidences show that China Household has little chance of escaping the fate of being 


prosecuted by SFC and delisted from market.


1 This is the minimum figure since China Household only disclosed that more than 90% of revenue comes 


from sales of household furniture in 2015 and 2016 
2 Same as 1 
3 Equals to net income adjusted for impairment divided by revenue

Part 1. Numerous Acquisitions that never fulfilled Profit Guarantee 





As discussed in introduction, China Household was formerly known as Bao Yuan (prior to being 


known as Bao Yuan, the listed company was known as Ching Hing). Therefore, all current PRC-


incorporated subsidiaries of China Household were injected into the listed company through 


acquisitions. Apart from Shannxi Tai Sheng Da Mining Company Limited which was injected back 


when it was known as Ching Hing, all the other five acquisitions came with profit guarantee.

While the Company disclosed that most of the profit guarantees above have been fulfilled, we 


discovered exactly the opposite from their respective SAIC filings and local tax filings, i.e. most of 


the profit guarantees have never been fulfilled. We discovered that the disclosed financial 


performance, including both revenue and net income, of all these companies after acquisition are 


mostly fabricated. We will discuss each these acquisitions one-by-one in the following. 





Zhongshan City Polar Sunshine Company Limited (“Polar Sunshine”) 





On 26 Jul 2013, China Household announced to acquire 100% share capital of Polar Sunshine from 


Mr. Lin Kai at the consideration of HK$ 380 million, to be settled by issuance of convertible bonds 


(mature in 3 years with no interest). According to the announcement, Polar Sunshine will be 


principally engaged in trading of heating wooden household products and other basic materials 


for heating wooden household products. As of the date of announcement, Polar Sunshine was in 


the process of establishment and has not yet commenced any business with no revenue and profit.  





After rounds of announcements delaying the acquisition, China Household finally announced on 


30 Apr 2014 that it has entered into a supplemental agreement with Mr. Lin Kai on acquisition of 



http://www.blazing-research.com/

mailto:blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch
Website: www.blazing-research.com / Email: blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch 


Polar Sunshine. The consideration was lowered to HK$ 210 million, to be settled by issuance of 


356 million shares of China Household.  





Regarding the resume of Mr. Lin Kai, the announcement stated that: 





“Mr. Lin Kai has accumulated more than nine years working and management experience within 


the wooden household related industry especially on the area of, supply chain management, 


research and development management and production management. 





Upon 2011, Mr. Lin has been denoting himself in the research and development of the far infrared 


heating technology in how to apply such technology into traditional floor tile and household 


products. He does not hold any patent.” 





In its 2014 annual report, fair value of consideration to acquire Polar Sunshine was estimated to 


be HK$ 238.52 million, which consisted identifiable net assets of HK$ 100.47 million (with 


intangible assets of HK$ 134.00 million, i.e. the net tangible asset is negative HK$ 33.53 million), 


implying a goodwill of HK$ 138.05 million. Proportion of intangible assets and goodwill to fair 


value of consideration for Polar Sunshine would be as high as 114%.

Exhibit 3: Disclosure regarding breakdown of Polar Sunshine’s acquisition consideration 


 
Source: China Household 2014 Annual Report, Page 105 





We do not understand the reason for China Household to acquire a company that has negative 


net tangible asset and no operations with HK$ 210.04 million. Still, it may seem like a good deal 


since it came with a profit guarantee: 





In the acquisition, the vendor guaranteed its total net profit after tax of the years ended 31 


December 2014, 2015 and 2016 shall not be less than HK$ 7,500,000 (~RMB 5,916,525), HK$ 


12,000,000 (~RMB 10,053,360) and HK$ 27,000,000 (~RMB 24,151,770) respectively.

Exhibit 4: Profit Guarantee of Polar Sunshine  


 
Source: Company announcements as of 30 Apr 2014 





In subsequent announcements, China Household disclosed that Polar Sunshine successfully 


met all of the above profit guarantee. However, from the SAIC filings and tax fillings of 


Polar Sunshine, we discovered that almost all the reported net income is fabricated: 





China Household announced in its 2014 annual report that “The after-tax net profit of Polar 


Sunshine Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 amounted to approximately HK$ 


7,600,000 (~RMB 5,999,000). Accordingly, the profit guarantee for the financial year ended 31 


December 2014 was satisfied”.  





However, Polar Sunshine actually reported a net loss of RMB 59,475.64 in its 2014 SAIC 


filing:

In 2015, China Household stated in its annual report that “The after-tax net profit of Polar Sunshine 


Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 amounted to approximately HK$ 19,689,000 


(2014: HK$ 7,600,000). Accordingly the profit guarantee for the financial year ended 31 December 


2014 and 2015 was satisfied”. However, according to 2015 SAIC filing, Polar Sunshine’s profit 


before tax and net profit after tax are merely RMB 630,358.42 and RMB 478,846.05 


respectively, far short of the HK$ 19,689,000 (~RMB 16,495,000) disclosed in annual report.

Going forward to 2016, which was the last year with a profit guarantee on Polar Sunshine, China 


Household only disclosed in its annual report that “The after-tax net profit of Polar Sunshine Group 


for each of the financial years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016 were above the 


abovementioned profit targets and hence there had been no shortfall”, without disclosing the exact 


amount of net profit after tax. To no surprise, Polar Sunshine only reported profit before tax 


of RMB 535.55 and net profit after tax of RMB 401.66 in its 2016 SAIC filing, far short of 


HK$ 27,000,000 (~RMB 24,152,000), the purported profit target in 2016.

In conclusion, more than 99% of the disclosed net income of Polar Sunshine was fabricated 


from 2014 to 2016, and more than RMB 46.22 million of China Household’s net income was 


fabricated from Polar Sunshine during the period:

China Household also has the habit of not paying tax in time even though the tax payable is 


minimal. Its subsidiaries’ names are frequently listed on local tax bureau website, which are 


publicly available. Readers can visit http://www.etax-gd.gov.cn/xxmh/html/index.html to see that 


the tax amount of Polar Sunshine is indeed minimal: 





Exhibit 13: Overdue Tax Record of Polar Sunshine from Guangdong Electronic Taxation Bureau 


 
Source: Guangdong Electronic Taxation Bureau, http://www.etax-gd.gov.cn/xxmh/html/index.html  





We can observe the value-added tax (VAT) of Polar Sunshine is merely RMB 2,756.7 in 2017 May, 


and all other amounts of tax payable are also minimal as observed from above. It seems to be 


impossible for a company that earns more than RMB 24 million of net income to only pay 


two thousand VAT in a month. We can confidently conclude that Polar Sunshine’s business 


and net profit are completely fabricated. 





Zhongshan City Kassade Wood Production Limited (“Kassade”) 





On 13 May 2013, China Household announced to acquire Kassade from Ultra Hero Limited (a BVI 


incorporated company but its ultimate beneficial owner was never disclosed in the relevant 


announcements. We suspect China Household is trying to hide its connection with seller since the 


identity of sellers in other acquisitions were all disclosed) at a consideration of HK$ 100 million, 


to be settled by issuance of promissory note maturing in 5 years with no interest. Similar to Polar 


Sunshine, Kassade was in the process of establishment and has not yet commenced any business 


and has not generated any revenue and profit as of the date of announcement. The transaction 


was completed in Jul 2014. 





There are no descriptions about Kassade’s principal business in the announcements but according 


to company’s annual reports, Kassade is principally engaged in manufacturing of floor tiles, 


various wood frames and other household wood products.

In its 2014 annual report, fair value of consideration to acquire Kassade was estimated to be HK$ 


59,065 thousand, implying goodwill of HK$ 59,869 thousand which was even larger than the fair 


value of its consideration. The net asset value is also negative. 





Exhibit 14: Disclosure regarding breakdown of Kassade’s acquisition consideration 


 
Source: China Household 2014 Annual Report, Page 103 





Similarly, Kassade’s acquisition came with a profit guarantee. The seller of Kassade guaranteed 


that (i) the aggregate audited net profit after tax of Kassade for the year ending 31 December 


2013 and for the year ending 2014 shall be not less than HK$20,000,000; and (ii) the audited 


consolidated net profit after tax of the Target Group for each year ending 31 December 2015, 


2016, 2017 and 2018 shall be not less than HK$20,000,000.

Source: Company announcements as of 13 May 2013 





Subsequent announcements of China Household disclosed that Kassade has met all the profit 


guarantee from 2014 to 2016. We then compare the disclosed net profit of Kassade with its net 


income on SAIC filings, and again found a material discrepancy (Please refer to Appendix A and 


Appendix B for the relevant profit disclosure and full SAIC filings respectively):

Difference (%) 101% 100% 108% 102%

From SAIC filing, Kassade has a total net loss of RMB 13.63 million from 2014 to 2016, while 


disclosing its total net income during the period is RMB 61.19 million on annual reports. 


We believe Kassade has fabricated RMB 62.56 million of net income for China Household 


from 2014 to 2016. 





We have also collected the local tax filings of Kassade, and the total tax paid of Kassade from 


2014 to 2016 is merely RMB 2.32 million, further collaborating our finding in SAIC filing: 





Exhibit 17: Difference between Kassade’s tax filings and estimated profit tax expense from company’s 


disclosure (RMB ‘000) 


  2014 2015 2016 Total

Difference (%) 69% 94% 101% 89% 


Source: Tax filings and China Household annual reports 





Readers may ask that why a company having loss would have a positive total tax paid from tax 


filing. This is because the total tax paid in tax filings include all kinds of tax, including Business Tax, 


Value-Added Tax, Urban Maintenance Tax and Profit Tax, etc. We are conservative in comparing 


the total tax paid directly with estimated profit tax expense, since the actual profit tax paid must 


be lower than the total tax paid. 





One interesting fact is that Kassade disclosed net profit after tax is HK$ 16.146 million in 2016, but 


still claiming that it has satisfied the profit guarantee of HK$ 20 million. We do not know how this 


is satisfied, and believe that the Company may have secretly changed the terms of Kassade’s profit 


guarantee without notifying its shareholders, which may constitute a breach of listing rules in our 


opinion. 





Again, Kassade has also not paid its tax on time:

We can again observe that Kassade payable taxes are minimal from the overdue tax record. For 


example, the VAT for Kassade in 2017 May is only RMB 18,740. We can again conclude that 


Kassade’s business and net income is also completely fabricated. 





Zhongshan City Wei Xin Household Company Limited (“Wei Xin”) 





On 7 Aug 2013, China Household announced to acquire Wei Xin (known as Red Hero Group in 


the announcement) from Mr. Cai Zhisen at a consideration of HK$ 480 million, to be settled by 


issuing convertible bonds (mature in 3 years with 2% interest rate per annum). Again, Wei Xin was 


in the process of establishment and has not yet commenced any business and has not generated 


any revenue and profit as of the date of announcement. The acquisition was then completed at 


the end of 2013.  





According to the announcement, Wei Xin will be principally engaged in providing virtual interior 


design simulation and electronic household product trading platform for selling the Company’s 


household products. Mr. Choi, the seller, has over 10 years of experience in information 


technology, retail software, internet sales and 3D interior design software and information 


technology system operation and consultancy for large scale household product companies.  





In China Household’s 2013 annual report, fair value of the acquisition was estimated to be HK$ 


294,816 thousand, implying goodwill of HK$ 294,826 thousand from this acquisition. China 


Household was again acquiring a company with almost no assets. You may refer to appendix C 


for the relevant disclosure. 





Similar to Polar Sunshine and Kassade, seller of Wei Xin guaranteed that (i) the aggregate audited 


consolidated net profit after tax of the Wei Xin for the year ending 31 December 2013 and for the

year ending 2014 shall be not less than HK$2,600,000; (ii) the audited consolidated net profit after 


tax of Wei Xin for the year ending 31 December 2015 shall be not less than HK$76,000,000; and 


(iii) the audited consolidated net profit after tax of Wei Xin for the year ending 31 December 2016 


shall be not less than HK$162,000,000.  





Exhibit 19: Profit Guarantee of Wei Xin 


 
Source: Company announcement as of 7 August 2013 





To no surprise, China Household reported net profit for Wei Xin in 2014 and 2015 but Wei Xin’s 


SAIC filings showed net loss from 2014 to 2016. We compare the disclosed net profit of Weixin 


with its net income on SAIC filings, and again found a material discrepancy (Please refer to 


Appendix D and Appendix E for the relevant profit disclosure and full SAIC filings respectively):

A savvy reader may notice that the profit guarantee in 2015 was not satisfied and you are correct. 


China Household then entered into a supplemental agreement with the seller of Wei Xin to cancel

the profit guarantee requirement and reduce the principal amount of convertible bond on 30 Mar 


2016 (that’s why China Household doesn’t have to disclose Wei Xin’s net profit/loss in 2016). Even 


though the profit guarantee was not satisfied, there is still significant fabrication in its profit.  





Again, tax filing of Wei Xin also indicates significant discrepancy with disclosed net income:

Exhibit 22: Overdue Tax Record of Wei Xin from Guangdong Electronic Taxation Bureau 


 
Source: Guangdong Electronic Taxation Bureau, http://www.etax-gd.gov.cn/xxmh/html/index.html  





The major business of Wei Xin is the development and operation of an online platform that sells 


household furniture. However, we found out that the online business of China Household does 


not exist completely. Please refer to part 3 for further details. We can conclude that most of Wei 


Xin’s business and profit are fabricated.

Zhongshan City Prado Style Household Company Limited (“Prado”) 





On 18 Oct 2012, China Household (known as Bao Yuan at that time) announced to acquire Prado 


from Mr. Kuang Yuan Wei (one of the executive directors of China Household now) at a 


consideration of HK$ 60 million, to be settled by issuance of promissory note (mature in 3 years 


with 4% interest rate per annum). Prado was the only company already established as of the date 


of announcement among the 4 acquisitions, however, it only began to operate the business in 


early 2012. The transaction was then completed in Jan 2013. 





According to the announcement, Prado is principally engaged in trading of wooden home 


furnishing products in the PRC and provision of one-stop home furnishing solution. Prado 


accounts for the majority of the revenue of China Household since acquisition. However, our due 


diligence in Zhongshan and other cities show that it has almost no sales in furniture. Please 


refer to Part 3 for details. 





In its 2013 annual report, fair value of consideration to acquire Prado was estimated to be HK$ 


50,808 thousand, which consisted identifiable net assets of HK$ 14,877 thousand (with intangible 


assets of HK$ 14,846 thousand, and therefore the net tangible asset is merely HK$ 31,000), 


implying goodwill of HK$ 35,931 thousand. Proportion of intangible assets and goodwill to fair 


value of consideration of acquiring Prado would be as high as 100%. You may find the detailed 


breakdown of consideration in appendix C. 





In the acquisition of Prado, the seller guaranteed that (i) the audited net profit after tax of Prado 


for the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013 will not be less than HK$15,000,000; and 


(ii) the audited net profit after tax of Prado for each year ending 31 December 2014 and 2015 will 


not be less than HK$15,000,000.

Although Prado is the only acquisition that can meet its profit guarantee according to SAIC filings, 


China Household still fabricated 86% of Prado’s net profit from 2013 to 2015. This amounts 


to a total of RMB 342.375 million fabricated net income from 2013 to 2015, which accounts 


for 93.6% of the net profit adjusted for impairment of China Household during the same 


period (Please refer to Appendix F and Appendix G for the relevant profit disclosure and full SAIC 


filings respectively):

The local tax filings of Prado also show that its total tax paid from 2013 to 2015 is merely 


RMB 24.79 million, which is only 19% of the estimated profit tax expense according to China 


Household’s disclosure:

Source: Tax filings and China Household annual reports 





As discussed above, since total tax paid include other kinds of tax, this 81% difference is the 


minimum discrepancy between reported tax expense and actual tax expense. The tax figures can 


be further corroborated by the public overdue tax record of Prado:

Exhibit 26: Overdue Tax Record of Prado from Guangdong Electronic Taxation Bureau 





 
Source: Guangdong Electronic Taxation Bureau, http://www.etax-gd.gov.cn/xxmh/html/index.html  





We can see that the actual profit tax of Prado in 2015 is merely RMB 870,226.91 from the 


above overdue tax record, which is very close to the RMB 615,039.30 profit tax expense in 


2015 SAIC filing (Please refer to Appendix G). (The difference is due to the fact the former one 


is actual tax payable while the later one is tax expense from accounting) Both figures are 


nowhere close to the implied tax of RMB 25,420,000 from the disclosed net income of 


76,205,000 in 2015. 





Further, we can observe that the actual profit tax of Prado from 2014 April to September (6 months) 


is RMB 958,501.24+RMB 1,259,242.31=RMB 2,217,743.55. By annualizing the figure, the rough 


actual profit tax of Prado in 2014 is RMB 2,217,743.55 x 2 = RMB 4,435,487.1, which is also far 


lower than the implied tax of RMB 55,803,000 from the disclosed net income of RMB 167,410,000 


in 2014. 





All three sources (SAIC filing, local tax filling and public overdue tax record) show that most 


of the net income of Prado is fabricated. We usually prepare for all possible responses of 


management beforehand, but we are regret to say that we cannot think of any good excuse for 


management and accountant to reconcile the difference. For the remaining net income of Prado,

we believe it mostly comes from New Oasis Wood Co. Limited (“New Oasis”), a disclosed 


connected transaction, and other undisclosed related party transaction. 





Shannxi Tai Sheng Da Mining Company Limited (“Tai Sheng Da”) 





Apart from the 4 above mentioned acquisitions relating to household industry, China Household 


also owned a titanium dioxide mine located in Ziyang County, Shaanxi Province, the PRC. The 


mine was acquired by China Household (known as Ching Hing at that time) from Mr. Fung Man 


Chun, Madam Li Ying, Madam Yang Xiaoli and Madam Qu Yinghong in early 2010 at a 


consideration of HK$ 1,680 million, settled by issuance of convertible bonds.  





However, the mine was never materialized since being acquired by China Household. China 


Household recognized exploration assets (an intangible asset subject to annual assessment of 


impairment) of HK$ 1,698,102 thousand after completion of the acquisition. Unluckily, over 97% 


of the exploration asset has been impaired as of 31 Dec 2016, indicating acquisition and operation 


of this titanium dioxide mine as a total failure.

In addition to the huge impairment of exploration assets, China Household also claimed to be 


obtaining relevant mining permit in order to commence operation. However, the timing of 


obtaining such permit was delayed year after year. At last, the claim of obtaining such permit was 


never materialized and its mining business was abandoned. We strongly doubt if the management 


of China Household has ever devoted any efforts in operating its mining business. 





Exhibit 28: Disclosure about mining business 


Year Disclosure 


2010 To broaden our sources of earnings, the Group acquired an iron and titanium dioxide mining 


company in China on 30 March 2010. The mining company holds a mining license with which 


the company has the right to conduct mining and exploitation works in a mine located at Ziyang 


County, Shaanxi Province, the PRC. Exploration on the mine was completed. Restructure of the 


management committee was accomplished. During the year under review, the mining business 


recorded a loss of HK$1.5 million which was mainly attributable to the administrative expenses. 


2011 On 30 March 2010, the Group acquired a mining company in order to broaden the income base 


of the Group and diversify its business into non-ferrous industry. The mining company held a 


mining licence under which the company has the right to conduct mining and exploitation works 


in a mine located at Ziyang County, Shaanxi Province, the PRC.

Year Disclosure 


The application for the PRC approval of the Mine is still in progress and the Group did not have 


any operation during the year ended 31 December 2011. The directors are of the opinion that 


the mining plan will be delayed. The Group engaged an independent valuer, to assess the 


recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation asset, pursuant to their valuation report, 


an impairment loss of approximately HK$160,829,000 on the exploration and evaluation assets 


was made by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011. 


During the year under review, the Group has submitted the application for the licence to the 


relevant authorities in order to commence the production in the upcoming future. The approval 


procedures were still in progress as at 31 December 2011. 


During the year under review, the mining business recorded a loss of HK$163 million, which was 


mainly attributable to the impairment loss and administrative expenses. 


2012 During the year under review, the application for the PRC approval of the Mine is still in progress 


and the Group did not have any operation in the mining business. Meanwhile, the Group has 


submitted the application for the license to the relevant authorities in order to commence the 


production in the upcoming future. the directors decided to postpone the mining plan and the 


Group expected all the required licences and approvals will be obtained by Year 2014. 


During the year under review, the mining business recorded a loss of HK$3 million. 


2013 During the year under review, the application for the PRC approval of the Mine is still in progress 


and the Group did not have any operation in the mining business. Meanwhile, the Group has 


submitted the application for the license to the relevant authorities in order to commence the 


production in the upcoming future. the directors decided to postpone the mining plan and the 


Group expected all the required licences and approvals will be obtained by Year 2015. 


During the year under review, the mining business recorded a loss of approximately 


HK$3,149,000. 


2014 During the year under review, the application for the PRC approval of the Mine is still in progress 


and the Group did not have any operation in the mining business. Meanwhile, the Group has 


submitted the application for the license to the relevant authorities in order to commence the 


production in the upcoming future. the directors decided to postpone the mining plan and the 


Group expected all the required licences and approvals will be obtained by year 2017. 


During the year, the mining business recorded an impairment loss of approximately 


HK$733,400,000. 


2015 Giving the slump in the international metal market, the management envisaged market players 


were incurring enormous losses thus slowing down its pace in the capital investment in the 


mining business. During the year, the mining business recorded a further impairment loss of 


approximately HK$699,200,000. 


2016 As a result of volatile metal commodity market, we recorded a significant impairment loss on 


exploration and evaluation assets of HK$699,200,000 in previous year and narrowed to 


HK$56,400,000 this year.

For the above mentioned four acquisitions about its household business (Polar Sunshine, Kassade, 


Wei Xin and Prado), we can conclude the common characteristics of China Household’s acquisition:  





 Claimed to have met its profit guarantee, but SAIC filings showed that the net income is either 


negative or immaterial, and the profit guarantee was never met 


 Local tax filings show only minimal amount of total tax paid 



http://www.blazing-research.com/

mailto:blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch
Website: www.blazing-research.com / Email: blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch 


 Public overdue tax records show that all kinds of payable of tax are minimal 


 The operating subsidiaries were not incorporated and no operations were commenced by the 


time the acquisition was announced, meaning that China Household was always purchasing 


merely a chain of shell companies that are just set up 


 The consideration consisted of a large amount of goodwill and intangible assets (combined 


over 100% of the consideration), and a negative or minimal tangible net asset 


 The true identity of seller was not disclosed in some of the acquisitions 





We here summarized the discrepancy between net income disclosed by China Household and 


reported in SAIC filings for the four acquisitions below:

We can see that nearly 90% of the net income from these acquisitions are fabricated, and 


these acquisitions helped China Household to fabricate at least RMB 471.46 million of net 


income. 





Below is the summary of the intangible assets acquired through these acquisitions:

In view of the above, we do not believe there is any commercial substance in these acquisition.

believe that the fraudulent extent of China Household can only be matched by China Metal 


Recycling.

into details to discuss profit guarantee of Shenzhen City Hong Xun Electronic and Technology Company 


Limited

Part 2. SAIC filings indicate at least RMB 2.2 billion of revenue fabrication 





Similar to many other fraudulent companies being revealed in the past, we noticed significant 


discrepancy between its SAIC filings and its disclosed revenue. As discussed in Part 1, based on 


information disclosed in its annual report, we retrieved SAIC filings of all China Household’s PRC 


incorporated subsidiaries from 2013 to 2016 (please refer to Part I and appendix for the income 


statements). You may find the list of China Household’s subsidiaries from 2013-2015 in appendix 


H for your reference.

A savvy reader may notice that all the PRC subsidiaries was a target of the acquisitions listed in 


part 1, while Polar Sunshine, Kassade, Wei Xin and Prado together made up all of China 


Household’s household business in the PRC. As mentioned in Part 1, almost all of the net income 


of these subsidiaries are fabricated. As expected, we also observed a significant discrepancy in the 


total revenue of all these PRC incorporated subsidiaries from SAIC filings and China Household’s

China Household disclosed that it has RMB 242.83 million of PRC profit tax expense from 


2013 to 2016, but local tax filings show that all its subsidiaries have only paid RMB 30.39 


million of tax, which is 87% lower than the disclosed figure.

Part 3. A Furniture Company that does not sell Furniture 





In this part, we inspected all purported distribution channels of China Household, including its 


retail shops, operating centers, and online store. We have appointed third-party investigator to 


visit the stores of China Household, interviewed China Household’s employees and contacted their 


purported clients, and came to the conclusion that China Household only has minimal amount of 


sales (if not none) in furniture.  





China Household disclosed that over 90% of the revenue and operating income from 2013 to 


2016 came from the sales of household furniture in PRC, therefore the revenue from household 


furniture in PRC in 2015 and 2016 should be higher than HK$ 1,036.89 million and HK$ 785.11 


million respectively.8 Its disclosed distribution channels include: (a) retail shops owned by China 


Household, (b) operating centers which distribute China Household’s furniture, and (c) online store 


operated by China Household. We will explore these distribution channels one-by-one in the 


following. 





(A) Retail Shops of China Household in Zhongshan 





According to the circular of the acquisition of Chang Ye on 2012 Dec 14, 





“Prado will establish a network of one-stop home furnishing solutions retail shops at different tier of 


cities and at different regions in the PRC for providing services and solutions directly to end users. 


The retail shops, on one hand, serve as display rooms for the collections of the household wooden 


products of Prado, on the other hand, serve as platforms for Prado to communicate with customers 


to illustrate preliminary simulation of the interior design concept to customers upon understanding 


their requirements.” 





Although with the aggressive plan of establishing a network of retail shops in different cities, China 


Household disclosed that it only has two retail shops in all announcements, which are located in 


Banfu and San Xiang of Zhongshan9. There has been media visiting these two stores in the past, 


and found that no furniture can be bought in these stores. China Household responded that the 


two stores are only “the showroom of the Company to display its products, but not a retail 


shop”10,which is already different from its initial disclosure on acquisition circular. Nonetheless, we 


have appointed third-party investigator to visit the showroom in 2017 April to understand more 


about China Household’s business. Our investigator firstly went to the store in Agile Town, San 


Xiang, Zhongshan:

However, our investigator cannot find any appearance of Prado’s stores in Agile Garden. Our 


investigator then went to the customer service center and asked the employees there about 


the location of Prado’s store, and all said that they did not know the existence of Prado’s 


store in Agile Garden. We believe that Pardo’s store in San Xiang has already ceased 


operation. 





It is surprising that one of the two stores of China Household has ceased operation already, while 


sales of furniture still contributed almost all of the revenue for China Household in 2016. Our 


investigator then went to Banfu’s store, where the head office of China Household was located. 


Luckily, the store there still existed:

Our investigator then went inside, pretending as a customer of Prado’s furniture. The employees 


there were surprised at people buying furniture with the following conversation: 





Employee: How may I help you? 


Our investigator: We would like to understand more about Prado’s furniture. 


Employee: Oh, we do not do any furniture business anymore. 


Our investigator: We would like to order furniture here. Isn’t it Prado’s furniture store? 


Employee: In the past only, not now. Now we only sell floor tiles, and do not sell furniture 


anymore. Our boss Mr. Li wants to do furniture business but it failed. 


Our investigator: Is there any furniture showrooms in the upper floor? 


Employee: Now the upper floor is mostly New Oasis’s office already, but part of the showroom 


still remains. 


Our investigator: Can we have a look? 


Employee: Sure. 





Then the employee brought our investigator to visit the showroom:

During the tour, our investigator’s conversation with the employee continued: 





Our investigator: The logo of Prado is still here! 


Employee: Yes, but now the office was occupied by New Oasis and another company already. 


Our investigator: Where is Prado’s office then? Are there any other Prado’s stores? 


Employee: All ceased operation when I came here already. There should be no other stores 


selling Prado’s products anymore. 





All of the above conversation were recorded and will be sent to SFC separately. We also observed 


from ground floor that the flank of building is indeed New Oasis’s store instead of Prado:

It is crystal clear that China Household did not sell any furniture already. However, to prevent 


China Household from using the excuse of ignorant employee and revenue coming from other 


channels instead, we continued our due-diligence in other distribution channels of China 


Household. 





(B) Operating Center: The Presence in Thousand Cities 





In 2015 annual report, China Household disclosed its new strategy of “Presence in Thousand Cities 


to increase its market share and awareness of the household business and built up strong clientele 


and reputation.” It aims to partner with companies in other cities to sell China Household’s 


furniture under the brand of Prado Style. These companies are called operating centers, and is 


responsible for market promotion, sales development, customer support and quality monitor in 


the assigned region.11 From China Household’s official website, there are a total of 13 operating 


centers:

Since the contact information are also listed on the website, we contacted the above operating 


centers one-by-one, asking if there are any China Household or Prado furniture that can be 


purchased. However, the result is that either no one listened to the phone or the contact 


person said that they do not operate any Prado furniture anymore. 





To further confirm our finding, we used substantial amount of time to collect all the SAIC 


filings of the above companies, with the below results:

It is obvious that the revenue of these operating centers is minimal, and is far away from the 


revenue disclosed by China Household. We can conclude that the strategy of “Presence 


in Thousand Cities“ has failed miserably. 





(C) Online Store: the cryptic code of OAO2C 





Similar to other companies that want to repackage itself into an online company so as to gain a 


high valuation, China Household has been emphasizing its online business strongly. It has even 


created a very creative term of “OAO2C” as its new business model, which actually stands for 


“Online And Offline To Customer”, and is in the center of the first page of China Household’s 


Annual Report from 2013 to 2016. Although the term sounds like a cryptic code, we believe this 


is just another name for “B2G” (“Business-to-ghost”) model, just like Cogobuy.

China Household has three websites, which are mall.chh692.com, www.chh692.com and 


www.360chh.com. Firstly, let look at the traffic of these websites:

The traffic of all its websites are so minimal that Alexa does not even have enough data to estimate 


its ranking. Data from SimilarWeb also shows the websites have minimal amount of traffic. Now, 


let visit mall.chh692.com, where according to the Company, “many customers have visited the 


website and obtained information on the Company’s products and services.”12

Although we were accessing the webpage in desktop computer, it gave us the mobile version of 


website instead. Anyway, we proceeded to register an account, hoping to purchase some furniture 


online. After registration, we were redirected to the following page:

It stated “taking order” on the webpage, but we do not understand what orders we were taking. 


We waited for several hours and the webpage stayed the same. We tried all buttons and links, but 


could not find any “information of the Company’s products and services”. We believe the website 


has already been abandoned and has no use anymore. 





We then tried www.chh692.com, which is the official website of China Household:

It seems a much proper webpage. However, this is only the official webpage of China Household 


showing the information and news about the company, and we cannot find any product 


information or purchase any products here. One interesting fact about this website is that it seems 


to be hacked on 2017 June 10: 





Exhibit 46: Google’s description on www.chh692.com

We will not show the screenshot of the hacked webpage here, since it contained a lot of colorful 


images that you can imagine. Luckily, the website has been fixed now. But the key question is, 


how can a company with such an emphasize on OAO2C have its official website hacked? Now, let 


move to the last website of China Household, www.360chh.com:

immediately:

It seems that China Household has provided a wrong request to Alipay, leading to the error. It is 


already rare for a user to be willing to pay RMB100 to just register an account, and even if you are 


willing to pay, you cannot pay as well. The website is full of similar bugs such as invalid link and 


images. For example, the top recommended product page is full of broken images:

There are also no places to place any orders. It seems to be just an online catalog of its products. 


We also tried to call its service hotline several times but no one listened. We believe this website

has been out of maintenance and was abandoned for a long time already, which collaborated with 


the traffic data from Alexa and SimilarWeb.  





Its Taobao website also shows only one product and zero sales. We cannot find any Tmall shops 


for products related to Prado or China Household, therefore Taobao and Tmall stores cannot be 


excuses either. 





In conclusion, just like the strategy of “Presence in Thousand Cities”, the grand plan of 


“OAO2C” failed miserably. We also reminded the readers that China Household used HK$ 480 


million to purchase these websites (See acquisition of Zhongshan City Wei Xin Household 


Company Limited in Part 1). When criticized by the high premium, China Household responded 


that the acquisition target has profit guarantee to protect the interest of shareholders. But China 


Household later just waived the profit guarantee for 2015 and 2016 when the profit of it did not 


meet. 





(At the time you read our report, China Household may already have fixed the above errors. But 


we have already archived most of the webpages mentioned above, and you can visit 


web.archive.org to visit the past versions of the company’s website.) 





If you would like to purchase Prado’s furniture, you will find yourself almost desperate in finding 


its products, and there are completely no ways to purchase its products. From the above 


investigation, we have confirmed that all distribution channels of China Household’s furniture 


either do not exist or has no sales at all. This was also confirmed by the employee in China 


Household. How can China Household have nearly one billion of sales in furniture when its 


furniture cannot be bought anywhere? We believe China Household is another pioneer in B2G 


model, instead of OAO2C. 


8 China Household only disclosed that the sales of furniture accounts for more than 90% of revenue in 


2015 and 2016, and does not disclosed the exact figures

Part 4. Serial capital raiser, mysterious cash balance and history of zero dividend 





Given our view that most of China Household’s revenue and net profit were fabricated, we would 


expect some red flags in its cash flow corroborating our findings. Unlike Cogobuy which recorded 


huge increment in trade receivables and inventories, China Household seems to fabricate its cash 


balance directly instead. 





With the current interest rate in PRC, one would reasonably expect at least 1% interest income 


annually from its cash and bank balance. However, we discovered that China Household’s average 


interest rate is as low as 0.06% in 2015, which is far away from the reasonable interest rate level. 


Such a low interest rate implies that China Household’s cash and bank balance is likely to be 


fabricated. We suspect China Household to borrow some cash and inject it into its bank accounts 


for just 1-2 days in every end of year to fool the auditors (China Household’s auditor is notorious 


in Hong Kong stock market. Please refer to [Part 7. Notorious Auditor – Elite Partners] for full 


details).

Despite its ever increasing cash balance, we found China Household to be a serial capital raiser 


since its backdoor listing in 2013. China Household has issued 6 batches of convertible bonds 


since the start of 2016, raising a total of HK$ 813,145 thousand as “general working capital”, which 


also exhausted the general mandate granted every year. This is another clear red flag showing 


that most, if not all, of China Household’s cash balance is fabricated. Why would China Household 


need to continuously raise funds with an ever increasing cash balance?

The convertible bonds issued by China Household are mostly converted, which severely dilutes 


the shareholdings of shareholders. The total issued share increased from 2,186.65 million shares 


in the start of 2013 to 6,994.09 million shares in 2017 May, representing a 220% increase. 





With a fabricated cash and cash equivalents balance, one should not expect China Household be 


able to declare dividends to its shareholders. Indeed, China Household has never declared any 


dividend since its backdoor listing in 2013. (Actually, 692.HK has never declared any dividend since 


its listing in early 2000, no matter what name (China Household, Bao Yuan or Ching Hing) it is 


using.)

Part 5. Stock Price Manipulation with over 90 Brokerage Accounts 





We have collected the internal documents of China Household through unconventional mean, 


and have obtained huge amount of evidences related to the trading activities of China Household. 


After weeks of investigation, we concluded that Mr. Li has been using over 90 brokerage accounts 


in more than 40 brokerage firms to conduct trading of China Household, in order to (i) hide 


controlling shareholder so as to prevent triggering of mandatory general offer and reverse 


takeover, and (ii) create a false impression of active market. 





Over 90 Brokerage Accounts of Mr. Li 





It is by no means normal for a furniture company’s shareholder to control over 90 brokerage 


accounts. But from the internal documents of China Household, we found that Mr. Li has actually 


controlled over 90 brokerage accounts. After weeks of analysis, we can generally classify these 


brokerage account into three types: 





Type A: Owned by Mr. Li or his related parties and controlled by Mr. Li for holding purpose 


Type B: Owned by Mr. Li’s related parties and controlled by Mr. Li for trading purpose 


Type C: Owned by Mr. Li’s friend 





Below is the table of brokerage accounts from an internal document titled “李总账户.xls” (Mr. Li’s 


accounts.xls):

observe that Mr. Li alone has 10 accounts (#1-#10 account) and his wife Wu Guanwen has 3 


accounts (#11-#13). Most of the remaining people are closely related to Mr. Li. For example, Mr. 


Xie Yusheng (#14-#16) is one of the subscribers for the convertible bond announced on 2015 Aug 


6, and is also the shareholder and supervisor of Zhongshan New Oasis Wood Products Co. Ltd. 


(“中山市新绿洲木业有限公司”), which is effectively controlled by Mr. Li and had connected 


transaction with China Household before. Mr. Ruan Xinghan (#17) is the legal representative,

Dongli Supply Chain Management Limited(“深圳市东利供应链管理有限公司”), a company that is 


closed related to Zhongshan New Oasis Wood Products Co. Ltd, and Mr. Xie Yusheng mentioned 


above is the supervisor of this company as well.  





We do not observe much daily change in the position of these accounts, and we believe the main 


purpose of these accounts is to hide actual holding of Mr. Li in China Household. We classify these 


accounts as type A brokerage account. We will explore these accounts’ holding and trading 


activities in later section. 





We then noticed another file called “张总账户.xls” (Mr. Zhang’s accounts.xls) with the following 


accounts:

Again, the password is masked here. We checked the trading activity of these accounts and found 


that there have been extremely frequent trading activities for these accounts. We guess that these 


accounts may be linked to 深圳市前海日昇祥资产管理有限公司, a company specialized in trading 


security, since both 张海浩 and 罗翠频 listed above has been legal representative of this company. 


We believe that Mr. Li has hired this group of people to carry out wash trade so as to manipulate 


stock price and create a false impression of active market in China Household. We classify these 


accounts as type B brokerage accounts. The shares held by these type B brokerage accounts, alone 


with the shares under type A brokerage accounts mentioned above, are described as “控制股数” 


(Controlled Shares) in the internal document of China Household, hence we believe type A and

type B brokerage accounts are both owned by Mr. Li effectively, but only for different purposes. 


We will cover this in details in later section. 





We also observed some accounts marked as “李总朋友但不能查阅” (Mr. Li’s friend but cannot be 


checked) in other files. We called these accounts as Type C brokerage account, which we believe 


to be owned by friends of Mr. Li. From the huge amount of documents, we summarized the major 


accounts found from the internal documents of China Household below:

We observed that there are 92 major brokerage accounts (we ignore the accounts that has no 


stock) in the internal documents of China Household. Almost all of the above accounts are not 


disclosed to public. Why would a furniture company need 92 brokerage accounts to hold and 


trade its own stock? The answer is to (i) hide controlling shareholder so as to prevent triggering 


of general offer and reverse takeover, and (ii) create a false impression of active market. 





Controlling over 60% of shares but disclosing only 13% of shares 





There are a group of listed companies that focus on financial trick instead of real operation in 


Hong Kong, and are generally called “老千股”. This is a relatively unique phenomenon in Hong 


Kong’s market. One major characteristics of these companies are that they have no disclosed 


substantial shareholder, by having friends of large shareholder to hold the shares on behalf of 


him or her, with all holding below 5% and therefore no obligation need for disclosure arises. 





The main benefit of having no disclosed substantial shareholder is that it can circumvent all 


definitions of relevant rules in Listing Rule, Takeover Code and HKFRS, such as related-party 


transaction, connected transaction, triggering of general offer, need of abstaining from voting, 


etc. For example, before Mr. Li controlled China Household, China Household had no disclosed 


substantial shareholder in 2012. In 2012 June, Hong Kong Exchange even required the Company 


to investigate the identity of its shareholder and the Company replied that no substantial 


shareholder can be identified. 13

After Mr. Li gaining control of China Household in 2013, Mr. Li has been the substantial 


shareholder holding around 10-20% of China Household’s shares. But from the internal 


documents of China Household and record of its brokerage accounts, we found out that Mr. Li 


has indeed controlled over 50% of China Household’s share through the above accounts. For 


example, on 2014 July 3, the shareholding of the above Type A brokerage accounts is as follow:

Source: Internal Documents of China Household and record of brokerage accounts 





We can observe that Type A brokerage account, i.e. those that are directly under the control of 


Mr. Li, already accounted for 32.60% of the issued shares on 2014 July 31. However, from public 


disclosure, Mr. Li only held 13.04% of share as of the same date. Using similar analysis, we also 


calculated the shareholding held by Type B brokerage account and Type C brokerage account of 


Mr. Li. The full details can be found in Appendix I, and here is the summary:

 Shareholding % of Issued Shares 


Type A Broker Accounts' Shares 1,017,930,000 32.6% 


Type B Broker Accounts' Shares 544,710,000 17.4%

Total Issued Shares 3,122,314,964 100.0% 


Source: Internal Documents of China Household and record of brokerage accounts 





We can observe that Mr. Li has indeed controlled over 60% of China Household’s share as of 2014 


July 31, while disclosing only holding 13.04% shares. This is a complete violation of Takeover Code 


and Listing Rule by hiding the change of controlling shareholding. Since Type A brokerage 


accounts are all owned by Mr. Li (the excel indicated those shares under these brokerage account 


as “李总持有股份”, i.e. “Shares controlled by Mr. Li “), at least all holders of Type A brokerage 


account should be considered as persons acting in concert according to Takeover Code, and 


therefore Mr. Li have already gained control (more than 30% of voting rights) of China Household 


under the definition of Takeover Code. This would lead to the requirement of mandatory 


general offer under Takeover Code. Most importantly, since the acquisition of Chang Ye 


Holdings (i.e. Prado) announced on 2012 Oct 18 constituted “Very Substantial Acquisition”, 


the change of controlling shareholder should also trigger the definition of Reverse Takeover 


under Listing Rule 14.06(6). China Household should therefore be treated as new listing 


applicant and go through the whole process of IPO. 





Over 50% of Trading on Exchange from brokerage accounts controlled by Mr. Li 





We then collected the trading record for the above brokerage accounts of Mr. Li. We noticed that 


there has been numerous trading for the Type B brokerage accounts stated above. Below is the 


screenshot of one of its brokerage accounts as an example:

We then calculated the total trading volume and turnover from the trading activities of these 


brokerage accounts, and found out that the trading volume from these accounts already account 


for more than 50% of the market volume on average, and on some days almost all of the trading 


can be from these accounts alone. For example, on the week of 2014 Nov 24 to 2014 Nov 28, the 


summary of the trading activity of brokerage accounts controlled by Mr. Li is as follow:

We can observe that on 2014 Nov 28, brokerage accounts controlled by Mr. Li already generated 


over 95% of the market turnover. And on average, brokerage accounts controlled by Mr. Li 


generated around 50% of the market turnover. We calculated these statistics directly from the 


trading records of these brokerage accounts, which we will send to SFC separately. 





Most importantly, we observed the phenomenon of wash trade between these accounts, i.e. 


buying from one account and selling from another account. We believe this constitutes false 


trade and price rigging under Securities and Futures Ordinance Part XIII. This can be a 


criminal offense and the maximum penalty for the relevant crime is imprisonment for up 


to 10 years and/or a fine of up to HK$10 million.  





We will send all the above evidences, including trading records of each brokerage 


accounts, to SFC. The above accusation can be easily verified by SFC such as IP address of 


these brokerage accounts, and therefore it does not help much to delete these records

now. From our years of experience in security industry, we believe these evidences are 


sufficient to bring proceeding to the relevant people responsible for these trading 


activities. We also remind all the investors to avoid trading the shares of China Household 


since the active turnover is just a delusion.

Part 6. The Aerospace Project that can Never Materialize 





We have demonstrated that vast majority of China Household’s current business, including both 


revenue and net profit, are fabricated in previous parts. Recently, China Household has been 


emphasizing on a so-called aerospace-themed tourism township project (“aerospace project”) in 


Zhongshan, and we will investigate the feasibility of this project in this part. 





On 29 Oct 2016, China Household announced that it has entered into a memorandum with 


Zhongheng Investment (China Shenzhou Aerospace Park), pursuant to which, the Company 


indicated its intention to acquire a national 5A tourist spot under China Shenzhou Aerospace-


Themed Park Tourism Township Project, which encompasses tourism, culture and industry 


element. The project was orchestrated by China Academy of Space Technology (Space Fifth 


Institute) and parties to the project, with full support from Zhongshan City Government. China 


Household also claimed in the announcement that the aerospace project is currently the first 


aerospace-themed park and education base for science popularisation in China, which has been 


included in the “Thirteenth Five” key construction projects in Guangdong province in 2016 and in 


the major construction projects of Zhongshan City in 2016. 





On 9 Dec 2016, China Household further announced acquisition of Guangdong Sunsea Yacht Club 


Company Limited (“Sunsea Yacht Club”) from Mr. Wong Hung Chiu (“Mr. Wong”) at a 


consideration of HK$ 1.35 billion, to be settled by issuance of convertible bonds or promissory 


notes. Although China Household claimed to be acquiring “aerospace-themed tourism township 


project“ in the announcement, Sunsea Yacht Club has not conducted any businesses yet and have 


not generated any revenue and profit since their incorporation. The only assets being acquired 


in this transaction are four plots of land located in Shenxi Village of Shenwan Town (one of 


the least developed towns in Zhongshan) that was still occupied by various villagers for 


agricultural and residential uses, with no demolition and resettlement works performed and 


zero commercial value as estimated by property valuer.

Exhibit 61: Description of the land in property valuation report 


 
Source: Company circular as of 28 Apr 2017, page V-5 





The management may argue that the aerospace project is still in its preliminary phase of 


development. However, this aerospace project was actually initialized five years ago back in 2012, 


with nothing materialized during these five years. We found numerous news articles on the 


Internet about the aerospace project back in 2012 but then no progress has ever been reported 


since 2013, until China Household made the voluntary announcement about this project in late 


2016. We strongly doubt if a project abandoned for five years could ever be materialized under 


the leadership and management of China Household, a company full of fabricated revenue and 


net profit.  





Another good reference on the feasibility of Zhongshan’s aerospace project is another similar 


aerospace park project planned in Wenchang, Hainan province (“Wenchang aerospace project”). 



http://www.blazing-research.com/

mailto:blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch
Website: www.blazing-research.com / Email: blazing.research.m@protonmail.ch 


Wenchang aerospace project is owned by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation 


(“CAST”), parent of the China Academy of Space Technology who supports the aerospace project 


in Zhongshan. Wenchang aerospace project was initiated back in 2007. After almost a decade of 


efforts, CAST decided to pull out from Wenchang aerospace project in 2017 March.  





If a city closely related to China’s aerospace development like Wenchang (Wenchang has one 


of the only four satellite launch centres in PRC, and the other three are located in Jiuquan of Gansu 


province, Xichang of Sichuan province and Taiyuan of Shanxi province respectively) could not 


complete its aerospace project after a decade, why should one expect the aerospace project 


can be materialized in a town totally irrelevant to China’s aerospace industry like Shenwan 


Town in Zhongshan? Moreover, CAST directly owned Wenchang aerospace project but has 


no stake in Zhongshan aerospace project. CAST will only provide support to Zhongshan 


aerospace project. If the idea of aerospace project is indeed commercially feasible, CAST should 


have completed the project in Wenchang, without need of pulling out of the project after a decade 


of efforts. We therefore hardly see any commercial substance or feasibility in the aerospace project 


proposed by China Household, and believe this is just another junk asset acquisition made by 


China Household.  





Reader may also question why the target company owning the lands is called Sunsea Yacht Club 


as there seems to have no connection between an aerospace project and a yacht club. This is 


actually another story of failed project initiated by Mr. Wong Hung Chiu, vendor in the transaction. 


Back in 2012, Mr. Wong claimed that a yacht club with 650 yacht parking space, together with the 


aerospace project, will be built in Modao island of Shenwan town, which would become a “flagship 


yacht club project in China”. The yacht club project was jointly developed by Mr. Wong and a 


Singaporean real estate company called Keppel Land. The project is now called “Keppel Cove”,  


which consist of both yacht club and real estate project.  





There are a total of 42 houses available for sales in phase I of Keppel Cove since 2015. But after 


two years of time, only four of them were sold in 2016 with one being cancelled subsequently, 


showing that the yacht club project has again turned out to be a complete failure after five years 


of effort. We have retrieved SAIC filings of Sunsea Yacht Club (Zhongshan) Limited Company 


(where Mr. Wong is one of the directors), the PRC company owing the yacht club and real estate 


project. We found that it has only generated a revenue of RMB 50,000 in 2016, with zero revenue 


from 2013 to 2015.

We have also appointed third-party investigator to visit Keppel Cove physically, and were 


informed by the sales representative there that the 4 houses sold mentioned above were bought 


by Mr. Wong himself and no one is currently living in Keppel Cove. After 2 years of effort, no single 


third party has ever bought 1 house at Keppel Cove and you can imagine how successful Mr. 


Wong is as a businessman.  





China Household further disclosed in the announcement that “The Board intends to invite Mr. 


Wong to join the management of the Company to manage and be responsible for the 


implementation and development of the China Aerospace-Themed Tourism Township Project upon 


completion of the Acquisition”. Given Mr. Wong disastrous track record in the past five years on 


both aerospace project and yacht club, we do not think inviting Mr. Wong into company’s 


management is beneficial to China Household. We are not convinced that the aerospace park will 


be able to be materialized after being abandoned for years. 





In conclusion, the past and present of China Household is full of fabricated business, and the 


future of China Household is full of unrealistic projects. We do not think China Household has any 


value as a listed company, and should be suspended from trading and delisted as soon as possible 


to prevent more investors being duped.

Part 7. Notorious Auditor – Elite Partners 





Auditors are usually the first line of defense in detecting fraudulent companies, since accountants 


are able to review detailed accounting books of the company. Therefore, reputation of auditor is 


a common criterion for investors to make investment decisions, and investors would generally 


prefer big four as accounting firms. Although many of the fraudulent companies revealed before 


were audited by big four, their reputations are still better than most other accounting firms in the 


market.  





We believe that the auditor of China Household, Elite Partners, was at best reckless in performing 


their audit work such that they could not discover such an obvious fraud, or at worst colluding 


with China Household in creating fabricated accounts. We hope SFC, or even ICAC, to conduct 


investigations on the role of Elite Partners in the scam of China Household. Auditors should not 


be exempted from legal liability of fabricating accounts.  





Elite Partners is notorious in Hong Kong market as an auditor specializing in replacing resigned 


auditors. When an auditor resigned, even with the reason of fee dispute, it generally indicates that 


the listed company could not pass their internal review procedures. Elite Partners has replaced 17 


Hong Kong listed companies’ auditors since 2016, in which more than half of them had certain 


issues revealed by the former auditors explicitly:

The above table speaks for itself about the professional standard of Elite Partners. We believe Elite 


Partners were either reckless in preparing the audit reports for China Household or they were 


colluding with the management in fabricating accounts. No matter which case it is, we believe 


that the engagement director of Elite Partners of this audit job, Mr. Chan Wai Nam William with 


Practising Certificate number P05957, should be held responsible.

Valuation and Conclusion 





Given the extraordinary extent of fraud of China Household and the large amount of evidences 


we collected, we believe that the only fate of China Household is to be prosecuted by SFC 


and delisted from the market, just like China Metal Recycling. A valuation is unnecessary, 


since its intrinsic value is zero in our opinion. We also recommend all investors to avoid 


trading of China Household, since the active market is just a delusion. 





We also believe the recent subscribers of China Household’s convertible bonds, including Mr. Luo 


Jianhua, the chairman of Lanju Group, and Mr. Zeng Wenbin, the chairman of China Fujian Gaoli 


Property, have the rights of reversing the subscription of the convertible bonds, if they did not 


know about the truth of China Household’s fabricated business and stock price manipulation 


before. With the only capital raising platform cut off, we also believe the grand plan of Shenzhou 


Space Park Project will never come to materialize. 





Moreover, with the recent regulators’ emphasize on the liabilities of listed company’s directors, all 


the directors of China Household, especially Mr. Li, Mr. Fu Zhenjun and Mr. Kuang Yuanwei should 


be prosecuted (please refer to appendix J for information of fraudulent companies delisted or 


suspended until now in Hong Kong market). We urge SFC to use SFO Section 390 to prosecute 


the relevant officers with criminal liability (maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment 


and a fine of HK$ 10 million) to China Household’s executive directors. We also urge SFC to 


use SFO section 212 to wind up China Household to protect minority shareholders and 


creditors, just like the case of China Meta Recycling. 





Lastly we would like to restate SFC’s recent reminder to all directors here14: 





“Heavy is the head that wears the crown” 





In preparing this report, we have engaged various third parties to assist us (including but not 


limited to site visits). These parties worked independently of each other and were unaware of the 


nature of the final report.

in possession of certain information, which we have decided not to publish in this report given its 


sensitive nature. The information has been encrypted and stored probably. If we feel the safety 


and anonymity of any party has been jeopardized, we will release all sensitive information we 


possess.
