Summary


Short Ideas Tech


MITK


Mitek has significantly increased in value after being added to known penny-stock
(aka pump-and-dump) websites.


There are at least two directors who are/were defendants of legal proceedings
(settled, lost, and ongoing) related to financial accounting manipulation in the midst
of heavy insider selling.


The 2016 Proxy assures investors this isn't the case despite public filings showing
otherwise. There's also heavy insider selling at Mitek.


Mitek also uses an obscure auditor.


RTI believes this is a case of "history repeating itself", and has a price target of $3-
4 (~50% downside).

Mitek Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MITK) develops, markets and sells mobile
capture and identity verification software solutions. The Company's technology allows
users to remotely deposit checks, open accounts, get insurance quotes, pay bills, as
well as verify their identity by taking pictures of various documents with camera-
equipped smartphones and tablets. MITK is the leader in the space, but it turns out that
it's not that difficult for banks to create their own(arguably more advanced) software.
MITK also face challenges from businesses such as Daon, which work with banks/other
to create their own software that's comparable to Mitek. It's also well known that MITK
has attempted to protect its niche through patent infringement cases against USAA and
Top Image, who called out MITK's software as ineffective. You may be thinking, "Real
Talk, this is all old news. In fact, I also know about all the insider selling that has been so
widespread that the audit committee members are now"major holders" relative to other
employees. If that's what you're thinking, great! I'm glad we're all caught up.


The information herein was located after a mere few hours of digging. My experience
tells me that if you can find dirt in a short period of time, there is more to come. For now,
I'll leave some meat on the bone for the small cap short specialists out there. I hope to
continue posting on this name, but I make no promises either way.


Real Talk Investments has reason to believe that Mitek has misrepresented publics
facts within their proxy statement regarding the evaluation of the ability and/or
integrity of their Directors. From the 2016 proxy:


Legal Proceedings Contradicting the Proxy:


It turns out that not one, but at least two directors who sit on multiple boards have not
only questionable backgrounds, but highly suspect backgrounds that involve legal
proceedings that accuse the directors of being involved in earnings manipulation
tied to companies with significant amounts of insider selling. This seems like the
bar must be pretty low regarding ability/integrity. I hope you've fact checked the
significant amount of MITK insider selling, but if not see the next graphic:

In late 2007, Mr. Aulet (member of the Compensation Committee and the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee) settled a lawsuit that alleged earnings
manipulation in order to garner a credit line and increase the company in question's
stock price. Mr. Aulet was the CFO of Viisage Technology during the period in question.
The stock tumbled after the following quarters earnings release by 20%, and then
tumbled another 20% after BDO issued an adverse opinion. My favorite excerpts are
below, please read all the docs yourself (case number is the first graphic):

This settled lawsuit qualifies as "legal proceedings within the last 10 years" and certainly
calls Mr. Aulet's integrity into question, which is in direct contrast to the statement within
the Proxy statement (picture above, pg. 8 of the 2016 proxy). This misrepresentation
ought to concern shareholders on its own, but when one also considers the heavy
insider selling at Mitek, one needs to ask, "is history repeating itself?".
Unfortunately for shareholders, Mr. Aulet is not the only director attached to legal
proceedings that suggest impropriety.

The other member of the Compensation Committee and Nominating Corporate
Governance Committee has an even more recent mark on his resume that calls into
question the appropriateness of his appointment to said committees. Do you remember
the VeriFone scandal? The SEC formally charged VeriFone for falsifying accounting
records to improve margins and income.


Mr. Hart was a member of the team that put VeriFone on the SEC's radar. It turns out
that he's currently being sued for ongoing actions that took place AFTER the SEC
case. Case number and excerpts:

Mr. Hart's ties to a committee of a company that was sued by the SEC calls the
appropriateness of his appointment into question, but when combined with an ongoing
proceeding (in which he is personally being sued), one really ought to think hard about
the statement within the proxy on the bottom of page 8 (see above).


Does management not know? If not, why? Did they not look? If not, this ought to
concern investors as it relates to competency. Does management know and not care?
This ought to concern investors if they feel these lawsuits are relevant to the director's
ability/integrity. Either way, this "miss" is a negative for investors.


If I found these proceedings but Mitek insider selling wasn't heavy and the financials
looked good... I wouldn't have found enough to convince myself that the stock will
continue to decline. But combining these proceedings, with the fact that Mitek insider
selling is very high and the financials are less than ideal, RTI is concerned for
shareholders.


Financials:


Looking at the financials, it is also a fact that receivables are growing much faster than
revenue (~62% 2YCAGR compared to a ~30% 2YCAGR). This is a signal that the
quality of the sales is on the decline and that there may be some "channel stuffing"
taking place as discussed by the wall street journal and posted by NYU here.

Real Talk also has other concerns related to MITK's meteoric rise over the last 8 months
. MITK shows up on numerous "pump and dump websites" targeted at unsuspecting
retail investors looking to make a quick buck, with little regard for the fundamentals of
the business or the industry.


For those who don't know... publishers of these websites often get into these names and
push the long thesis though articles, day trading websites, and blogs (PUMP). When
then when momentum slows, they exit their position (dump). This is comparable to what
was highlighted within the film "Wolf of Wallstreet".

Auditor:


Another negative sign is that Mitek uses an obscure auditor. Although It's reasonable to
use a cost-effective auditor when you're a micro-cap company... it is certainly not a sign
of confidence. And at a minimum a "red flag" that warrants further research in order to
get comfortable with a long investment. Given some of the media around MITK's auditor
(one such article above), RTI believes that the obscure auditor strengthens the MITK
bear case.

Conclusion:


Mitek has made a misrepresentation within their 2016 proxy in RTI's opinion. The
misrepresentation is material to stock holders because directors of multiple boards have
ties to earnings manipulation scandals (amidst high insider selling) within the last
10 years (at least one is ongoing). The parallels are concerning given the high level of
insider selling at Mitek along with the fact the financials suggest that management may
be "channel stuffing" given the comparison between revenue vs. receivables growth.
Further, MITK can be found on numerous "penny-stock" websites (considered by RTI
to be platforms for "pump and dump" schemes), and uses an obscure auditor.


RTI Valuation:


This is a clear "buyer beware" situation, and RTI believes the stock will decline to $3-4
(~50%).


Offering the world some REAL TALK when expectations equate to irrational exuberance.
