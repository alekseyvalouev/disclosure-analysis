Tuesday's Conference Call: Qihoo's Web Game Revenue Grows Faster
Than The Math

If a person of sound mind tried to tell you that he had a three-foot crowbar inside a one
foot square box, you wouldn't need to (1) look inside that box, (2) get a subpoena from a
judge, or (3) debate the man's honesty. You know that (1) this is mathematically
impossible, (2) additional information would be nice, but it wouldn't be necessary, and you
would also know instantly that (3) he's lying to you. That's what's so nice about deduction.
It's neat; it's clean; it's done.


Qihoo 360 recently changed its reported ARPU quotes from Monthly to Quarterly figures.
(ARPU stands for Average Revenue per Paying User.) What was once quoted as
somewhere between the impossible 380 and 440 monthly ARPU is now reported at 400
… for the quarter. Qihoo also tells us that this is gross ARPU.


In Tuesday night's Conference Call:


"Total web game playing users reach 148,000 in June. Web game gross ARPU for
this quarter was approximately RMB400." (Transcript and audio)


400 RMB converts to $62.96 USD. (here)


Unfortunately, those numbers belong on the left side of the revenue equation and cannot
possibly equal what Qihoo claims for the right side: total revenue. They said,


"Within IVAS, web game revenue were $19.1 million, up 189% from the same period
last year and up 10% from the prior quarter." (IVAS stands for "Internet value-added
service"; Transcript and audio)


Is this revenue net of sharing with developers?

"We concluded that game developers are the principals based on the fact that the
games are primarily hosted on the game developers' servers and such developers
are responsible for the maintenance of the games and determination of the prices of
the virtual items used in the games. Therefore, we report such revenue on a net
basis." ~ QIHU SEC 2011 20-F


But of course, in the real world none of this matters. Even if filed with the SEC, words and
definitions are constantly changing in this business ‒ with apparently little consequence.
(EG, here and here.) And then we have the press at large, who resist the hardest facts in
order to keep the broadest audience. So our most serious debates are left to message
boards. As I write this I can already hear the "refutation" ‒ "They meant gross-this, but you
said net-that" ‒ or vice versa. So I'd like to pin this squirming little bug down to the
Styrofoam. Let's forget about the revenue split with developers and net ARPU. We will
take the gross ARPU of 400 RMB as claimed in the conference call and multiply it by the
maximum ‒ the ending user base for June. We have 148,000 users in June, up from
139,000 users last March, which means that the average user base for the quarter would
be somewhere in between, but we're going to forget that. Let's count the whole 148,000
users for the entire quarter. This gives Qihoo maximum room for the math to work.


148,000 x $62.96 = $9.3 million USD … versus the total $19.1 million that Qihoo claims
they made. (And as a reminder, this is before revenue share with developers.)

As you can see, the reported numbers are so bad that even if we gave Qihoo maximum
elasticity to reinterpret "net" and "gross," the numbers are not even close. If someone
wanted to say that the $19.1 million represents revenue before revenue sharing (forget the
other implications for now), then the bar chart shown here would accurately show the
disproportion. The point here is not to illustrate revenue as it is, but to demonstrate the
impossibility of using Qihoo's numbers and arriving at Qihoo's totals ‒ while providing
Qihoo with the best possible set of numbers.


Let's cover every possibility … or, impossibility rather. If we refer to the $19.1 million (left
bar) as total revenue net of sharing with developers, then our calculated $9.3 million (right
bar) does not correspond and is much too high, since for argument's sake it has been
