China Green Agriculture: Still Waiting for Answers

China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA) investors who call its IR firm, HC International, this
week will discover that HC and CGA are parting ways after weeks of turmoil over
questions raised by the International Financial Research & Accounting Group, a summary
of which I originally wrote here.


CGA is expected to hire a new IR firm to replace the well-respected HC in the near term.
HC representative Ted Haberfield is telling inquiring investors that they weren’t happy with
CGA’s slow and tepid response to the questions raised. Nor are investors likely to be
happy with CGA’s two press releases issued Monday in an attempt to explain itself.


Before I review those press releases, I’d like to first point out to investors that a friend
made a recent site visit to CGA’s 88 acre “R&D greenhouses” project and took this very
revealing photo of a CGA’s banner at the site promoting the project. 


The picture clearly shows 30-40% of the land will be developed as a large scale real
estate project, complete with what appear to be lakes, condos, villas and large facilities
one of which is designated “science center”, while the others appear to be entertainment
related. The Chinese characters at the center of the billboard clearly translate
“Tourism/Relaxation Zone.”

Now, the last time I saw a project like this, and it was hardly this large scale, was
American Oriental Bioengineering’s (AOB) Beijing real estate splurge that reportedly cost
$70 million to develop and managed to alienate just about every institutional investor.
CGA management should have considered that investors don’t like companies that mix
their focus up, be it on real estate or Chairman Li Tao’s failed Kingtone Wireless IPO.


Regarding Monday’s dual press releases, they served only to point out why Chinese
companies need an experienced CFO and solid IR. The two press releases are full of
errors and omissions. Consider first the disclosure of CGA’s corporate income tax (CIT)
paid for calendar years 2008 and 2009:


More specifically, Jinong paid RMB 14,466,731.61 (approximately $2.1 million)
in March 2009 for the CIT incurred for calendar 2008. It paid
RMB21,040,562.21 (approximately $3.1 million) in March 2010 for the CIT
incurred for calendar 2009.


Anyone with a basic understanding of the Chinese tax system knows that Corporate
Income Tax has to be filed and pre-paid to the SAT within 15 days after the end of each
month or quarter. By the end of the 5th month after a calendar year ends, the enterprise
must file a final tax return along with all adjustments to prior pre-payments and its audited
financial statements. So it is simply impossible for CGA, as it claims in its press
release, to have paid each calendar year’s income taxes in a lump sum in March of
the following year. In fact, CGA’s own SEC filings prove its claims in the press release to
be inaccurate. In the Cash Flow Statement within the 10-Q filed on Feb 10 2010 (link
here), CGA disclosed income tax cash payment of $621,367 during the 6-month period
ending December 31, 2009.


CGA then proceeds to try to explain its value-added tax (VAT) accounting. The
explanation is hopelessly wrong and as a former licensed CPA myself, I will explain the
proper accounting to readers myself, in simple form.


First of all, VAT is not expensed in the Income Statement. In fact, there's no such thing as
a VAT expense. The way VAT is accounted for under GAAP is as follows:


The following VAT related accounting entries are made only to the accounts on the
Balance Sheet:


1. Sale of goods: An increase in Cash (or Accounts Receivable) and VAT Payable for the
amount of the VAT sales output tax

2. Purchase of goods: A decrease in Cash and the VAT Payable for the VAT purchase
input tax deductible


3. VAT payment to the SAT: A decrease in Cash and VAT payable


In other words, the balance of VAT Payable on the balance sheet is the net difference
between the sales output tax payable and the purchase input tax deductible. The VAT
amount does not enter or touch the Income Statement as any cost or expense. The
explanation given by CGA in its press release is totally incorrect. 


CGA’s explanation of the amount of VAT Payable also completely fails to mention the fact
that VAT is required to be accrued and paid on a monthly basis. Any amount of VAT
Payable that CGA reports on its balance sheet must be paid within 30 days (to avoid
severe penalties). It is therefore entirely reasonable to add up all the quarter ending VAT
payable balances for the 8 quarters in question, equal to $14.99 million, and conclude that
CGA must have paid have at least that amount to the SAT. But the official tax records
obtained by IFRA here show only RMB 469,000 VAT paid during this period. CGA
described those records as “incomplete” on its fourth quarter conference call but as we
have seen it has since failed to provide any evidence to support its position.


Regarding the inflated 88-acre land purchase, CGA has still not explained the payment of
RMB 54.83 million to an unnamed SOE. In fact, according to an additional government
record obtained by IFRA that you can download here (within footnote 22) is titled “Notice
of Approval for the Land Use Right Sale from Hu County Government”. It explains very
clearly that the government took back the usage rights to the land from the previous owner
on April 3, 2009 before reselling it to CGA subsidiary Yuxing. It is also clearly stated in the
land use right transfer agreement that Yuxing acquired the land use right directly from Hu
County government's Land and Resource Bureau. The agreement is titled "State-owned
Land Use Right Transfer Agreement" and the seller is the Land and Resource Bureau of
Hu County, Xi'an, Shaanxi. Therefore, there is absolutely no possibility of the RMB 54.83
million payment CGA claims it made to the unnamed SOE to purchase the land use rights.


In addition, the Deed Tax Receipt showed a tax payment of RMB 520,534.78, an amount
CGA also confirms in their press release. According to the Deed Tax Regulation from
website of Shaanxi provincial government here, the applicable deed tax rate for such
transactions is 3% according to Section 5 of the regulation. Section 6 (1) clearly explains
that 3% shall be calculated on the contracted price of land usage rights and properties,
including all forms of payments made in monetary considerations, tangible, intangible
assets and economic interests. The land usage right sale price based on the RMB
