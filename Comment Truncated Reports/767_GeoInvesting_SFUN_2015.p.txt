Soufun

Summary


Widespread layoffs at Soufun being reported in China have reportedly come as a
result of “faked contracts” employees were involved in creating.


Other outlets report that Soufun may have had knowledge that these fake
transactions were taking place.


Soufun has not made any disclosures in the U.S. regarding these layoffs and owes
investors and regulators some answers.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.

We have once again found information that has been released in China and may not have
been thoroughly explained and disseminated in the United States. This time it involves
Soufun (NYSE:SFUN), a real estate holding company that's headquartered in Beijing,

China. Soufun trades under SFUN on the NYSE and at a price of around $7, has a $2.9
billion market cap.


We believe the organized information we are presenting speaks to the importance of our
unique brand of due diligence and access to information which may not be available in the
U.S. We use this information to help investors protect their portfolios in cases just like this
one.


We recently uncovered several articles from Chinese media sources, such as this one in
SINA Finance, regarding a large scale employee layoff incident at SFUN. When
translated, this news report (paraphrased) states that:


"……Up to 1,000 brokerage employees from SFUN's secondary housing business in
the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu received a layoff text message from the
company on September 28, [2015]. SFUN says it fired these brokers due to faked
contracts during their tenure at the company."


It was also reported in the article that some of the laid-off employees came together to
protest in front of SFUN's offices in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai.


After further research, it seems to us that things may be more serious than they sounded
in the initial report. For example, in this article written by Southern Metropolis Daily, it is
reported that:


"……part of the brokers told [the reporter] that they want to 'protest' because SFUN
has known these activities (fake contracts) all the time, which is equal to an
'acquiescence'."


We don't know if the report is true or not regarding SFUN having knowledge of these fake
transactions, but if it is true, then SFUN owes an explanation not just to its investors, but
to regulators.

Further research led us to some Tieba message board threads (a discussion group
platform offered by BIDU), on which former and current employees of SFUN make posts
or comment on other people's posts. Below are some of the posts that we found:


1.


"Deducting salary? Fake contracts? No place to complain? Forced to sign unequal
agreement? Everybody complain together, I am from the city of Hongzhou and
welcome people who are hurt by SFUN to join the chat group 103229877….."


2.


"SFUN in city of Shanghai did the same thing to fire employees…


3.


"…I am from city of Nanjing, and am also fired…"

Group chat titled: "SFUN Owes Employees Salary Complain"


A: "The company says if there's no transactions, then employees will be laid off. I have
made no transactions for some time, then the manager called me out to ask me, 'Don't
you know how to make fake contracts? Download some real estate certificates and
IDs online.'"


A: "Then I quit."


B: "It's the same in city of Chengdu."


A: "Haha"


A: "Now [the company] is investigating the fake contracts."

A: "When the team results do not meet the requirements, the company pressures
employees to make fake contracts to boost results. Now that results are up, then [it is]
killing the donkey (meaning firing the employee)."


C: "The branch office boss asked to make fake contracts, I am under pressure to get
results."

"Same with city of Shenzhen, do the work for nothing."

According to the thread, this is in the city of Hongzhou. This protesting banner says:


"[SFUN] forcefully laying off employees, and employees don't have a place to go".

According to the thread, these picture are of the SFUN office in Shanghai.


The caption above the picture reads:


"There are more people on the scene, and associate police are getting more officers"


Here are some of the Tieba links that we used to conduct our research. All of the pictures
above have been taken from these forums:

In the meantime, we are not guaranteeing that these people or the IDs on these forums
are telling the truth (that would depend on the reality of what is actually happening in
China right now); rather, we are delivering this information because it's the type of
information that's sometimes looked over by the mainstream media. Please be reminded
that these threads, technically speaking, can be deleted by Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), under
request by SFUN or a government authority. It would not be surprising to us if, in the near
future, these threads have been removed.

According to this Chinese article on October 16, 2015, SFUN responded to the media
regarding this issue. The article states (paraphrased):


"On October 16, [2015], the department of publicity of SFUN wrote an email to China
Business Daily that the firing [of employees] due to fake [contracts] recently is not
the first time. In May of this year, broker Liu in the rental business department was
found during a routine investigation to have 3 fake contracts out of 56 contracts in
month of April, and [Liu] was fired by SFUN. In the same month, the investigation
centered in the city of Shanghai sampled transacted contracts and found that three
employees, including Chen, conducted photoshopping of ownership information in
the submitted contract attachment [to the company], and the photo of three parties
[in the transaction] was obtained online. These three employees were also fired due
to fake contracts.


Although both parties (meaning fired employees and the company) are holding up to
their own argument, SFUN didn't give the exact number of the employees that have
been fired."


Conclusion


After conducting our research on this issue, we believe that this incident deserves
more attention from public investors. First of all, our analysis of the articles online and
threads on the discussion boards make us question whether or not middle management
could have knowledge of some of these fake contracts being perpetuated. These types of
fake contracts are outside the realm of what normal retail investors would be able to
research when looking at a company; therefore we believe this should cast a shadow of
scrutiny on SFUN.


Our major takeaways from this analysis are:
