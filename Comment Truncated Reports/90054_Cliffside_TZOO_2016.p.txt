TZOO


We estimate current new member acquisitions have a negative ROI. If it is unable
to reverse this trend in the long term, the company is worthless.


The true underlying cost of new members is approximately 4x higher than the
company reports.


Its business is dying as revenue remains in long term decline due to competitive
pressure and lower ad rates in mobile vs. desktop. Mobile is now 50% of ads and
growing.


This has forced the company to transition its revenue to hotel bookings. This will
cannibalize existing revenue. Larger competitors like Kayak have attempted this
transition and failed.


Google Trends search for "travelzoo" has been a good predictor of revenue. Search
trends for "travelzoo" remain in decline with no bottom in sight.

Cliffside Research is pleased to announce a compelling short thesis on Travelzoo, Inc.
(NASDAQ:NASDAQ:TZOO). TZOO is overvalued by at least 50% and long term, we
make the case that the stock could approach zero. For the entire "strong sell" thesis,
please visit our website.


Overview:


TZOO came public during the tech boom days in 1998. The stock has been on a roller
coaster ride ever since, twice breaching $100 per share in a burst before eventually
crashing back to Earth just as quickly. Its "technology" is old, outdated, clunky and at
times difficult to use. This is directly the result of years of under-investment as it has
strictly run the business to maximize cash flows. We are big fans of maximizing cash
flows but in TZOO's case, it has maximized them for short-term gains and to the long-
term detriment of the business. This strategy had worked for several years as the
business was able to grow revenue despite the lack of unique technology but in 2013,
its revenue growth run ended and now it's time to pay the piper. The company is now
attempting to return to growth via a hotel booking platform but we believe this strategy
will fail.


How did it get here? Most executive management teams find themselves reassuring
analysts while walking down overly aggressive expectations. Often it's not a matter of
growth, but investment in the future of the company that delays the near-term earnings
euphoria for long-term earnings sustainability. TZOO finds itself in the opposite camp.
The company has largely been run profitably over several years but it has mainly relied
on what worked in 1998 to do so, an advertising-based vacation deals email newsletter.
It calls those who sign up for its newsletters "members" but its members are mainly just
an email distribution list. While the competition has promoted and invested in product to
improve functionality, ease of use and increased engagement on multiple platforms for
the consumer, TZOO chose to mainly focus on its vacation deals email list. Despite
more recent attempts to push into mobile apps and social, this simple email list is still
the major driver of revenues even now in 2016. First, we'll review TZOO's competitive
position and then we'll breakdown current sources of revenue.


Blurred Lines - Where Does TZOO Fit?



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TZOO?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

http://www.cliffsideresearch.com/
Within the travel category, there are four or five major buckets a company can fit in. The
categories include online travel agent (OTA), customer review, metasearch, back-end
systems and Internet advertising. Increasingly, they all do a little of each. Priceline
(NASDAQ:PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) are generally considered OTAs and
they currently dominate the category. However, they are also major players in all the
other categories. For example, Priceline's Kayak and Expedia's Trivago would be
examples of metasearch sites. Metasearch sites search several different travel providers
for the best price, but due to consolidation, the options increasingly are dominated by
PCLN and EXPE. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a customer review site, but it now has
rolled out its own hotel booking platform and advertising largely drives its revenue. TRIP
is also a metasearch provider. On the back-end, we include B2B service providers, hotel
management systems and the like. PCLN is increasingly a major player in this category
as it looks to build deep, sticky relationships with the supply base. Then there's Airbnb
(AIRB) and the "home sharing" category, which is a whole other ball of wax but clearly is
another competitor in hotel booking.


As you might imagine, these industries are tech-heavy, highly competitive and extremely
innovative. TZOO is none of that. TZOO is loosely considered a media publisher, but
really it is mainly known as a travel package and local deals advertising platform. It
distributes an advertising newsletter to an email list. The model hasn't changed much in
its 18 years. It has added mobile apps and is attempting to monetize social but if it is
having major success monetizing these options, it has been keeping that secret to itself.


For example, mobile apps have become a major component of travel bookings. Several
travel apps rank well above TZOO. In the travel category of the newly released iOS 10,
there are dozens of travel apps available. TZOO's app is not featured at all. An app
store search for "travel," a word that is in its name, has it listed as the 25th option. A
search for "hotel" lists it as the 38th option.


Revenue Breakdown:


TZOO's three sources of revenue are travel, search and local.


Travel:



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCLN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRIP?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
Travel revenue includes travel publications, which consists of its Top 20 newsletter,
Newsflash email alert service, websites, and network revenue consisting of third-party
websites that list TZOO published travel deals. In addition, "local getaway" vouchers
and the hotel booking platform revenue also fall in the travel category. When TZOO
references "members" it is referring to the 28.9mil email accounts that have signed up
for its email newsletters, mainly the Top 20 newsletters. Although it is unclear exactly
what percent of this division is driven by advertising revenue, it's safe to assume that the
vast majority is from advertising. This division is the foundation that the business was
founded on in 1998.


Travel has been in a steady decline for the company since 2014. Major drivers of the
decline include declining advertising rates due to the move to mobile, lost customers,
increased competition and FX. With the exception of FX, we believe the trends
impacting it are long term in nature, not likely to reverse course and cause the company
to be seen as increasingly irrelevant to advertisers and consumers alike.


Currently, TZOO is rolling out its hotel booking platform. It first began rolling out the
platform in Q2 of 2014. The rollout has been extremely slow and cautious. To date, it still
has not rolled out the platform worldwide. Success in the hotel booking platform is
critical for TZOO. It has been extremely guarded about the platform and has not
released any meaningful information regarding the percent of revenue it now represents.
The company expects its hotel revenue to increasingly shift to this platform over time.
We believe this is a major transition for the company and an extremely negative
development for several reasons. Here are five key reasons.


The shift to the hotel platform appears reactionary to deteriorating market conditions
in advertising and voucher sales. It's essentially an act of desperation.


1.


The company doesn't have experience in hotel booking, hence the very slow rollout.2.


Expedia and Priceline dominate the category. Both are much larger players and with
the recent entry of TripAdvisor and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) into hotel booking,
competition has only increased.


3.


Due to the competitive nature of the space, margins will be lower than TZOO's
existing margins.


4.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
The company has admitted the shift will cannibalize advertising and local getaway
revenue. We fear this doesn't add revenue, but simply slows the decline at best.


5.


Search:


Search revenue includes SuperSearch and Fly.com pay-per-click advertising revenue.
These products fall in the "metasearch" category with competitors like Priceline's Kayak
or Expedia's Trivago and others. Search has been in decline, and the company expects
the decline to continue. The decline has been driven by intense competition and the
move to mobile, which the company has found difficult to monetize. TZOO has been
scaling back spend on traffic acquisition for several quarters. As a result, the search
product is increasingly irrelevant to the marketplace.


Local:


Local revenue includes local deal vouchers and entertainment non-vouchers. Local
deals and the local "getaways" product (included in travel revenue) were the main
drivers of increased revenue beginning in late 2010 through mid-2012. These products
compete with providers like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Living Social. In yet another
example of a reactionary mindset, we believe TZOO entered this space due to
competitive pressure. In mid-2012, local revenue began a long, steady decline that
continues today. The decline is driven by several factors including competition, declining
demand and decreased take rate (commission) earned from merchants for vouchers
sold.


TZOO has claimed in the past that the segment has suffered from irrational competitors
that are offering money-losing deals in local. TZOO has chosen to focus on profitability
at the expense of lost market share. We believe this is the correct decision, but it means
this division is unlikely to be a driver of meaningful revenue or income growth going
forward.


Changing consumer habits have also impacted local revenue. As competition has
increased and consumers have acclimated to the "deals" voucher concept, they are
increasingly choosing to purchase vouchers at the time they are planning to use them
rather than on impulse. This change in consumer mindset from "push" to "pull" has also
been blamed for the decline.

The APAC division was acquired in Q3 2015. The chart below restates revenue as if
APAC had been acquired in Q1 2013 for comparison purposes. We note that no region
is experiencing growth and all are in long-term decline. Total Revenue and North
America revenue peaked in 2013 and show no signs of recovery. The Q1 and Q2 uptick
are purely seasonal in nature and down year over year.

Terrorism Likely Impacts Q3 & Q4 and Beyond:


In its most recent quarterly call, the company acknowledged that terrorism had an
impact on its quarter and it expects the impact to be greater in both Q3 & Q4 this year.
CEO Holger Bartel explained in great detail on the call how their business is impacted in
two ways. First, in places where there have been terrorist activities like France, Belgium,
Germany and Turkey, the advertisers don't want to advertise travel packages.
Interestingly, Turkey happens to have been a very popular destination for European
travelers. Mr. Bartel stated that, "a year or two ago, Turkey was probably one of the
most popular destinations promoted in our UK Top 20, now it happens very rarely." The
UK represented 19% of TZOO's revenue in 2015, so this is significant. TZOO, wisely, is
also not looking to advertise high-risk areas like Egypt, for example.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/9/25/47406777-14748559526908185_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3993219-travelzoos-tzoo-ceo-holger-bartel-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
The second impact comes from its members who, of course, are less interested in
traveling to those destinations, but are instead choosing destinations that are perceived
as safe like Spain and Portugal. These popular destinations are very busy and it's far
more difficult for TZOO to find good deals in these locations. In fact, these destinations
are now so popular that the locals in some cases have written graffiti encouraging
tourists to leave and politicians are considering several measures to cap tourism. Since
TZOO is mainly known as a last-minute travel deal provider, this is further hurting its
business. Unfortunately, due to recent events, New York City also may be an area
vacation travelers increasingly avoid. Travel to the US by foreigners has been one of the
areas of strength for TZOO and New York City is one of the top destinations.


Ultimately, we believe none of these developments are welcome for small travel-focused
operations like TZOO that are likely to be impacted more than larger, diversified
organizations. We argue that when vacationers feel both fearful to travel to some
regions and unwelcome in others, it is more likely to stay home. We feel this trend will
likely continue as consumers opt for more "staycations" in coming years. These cheaper
packages likely won't generate the same kind of advertising rates and commissions for
TZOO, further widening the gap to its much larger competitors.


Google Search As A Predictor of Revenue:


Searching for "travelzoo" on Google appears to be a good predictor of TZOO's revenue
and can be found here. Google searches for "travelzoo" peaked in June 2011. TZOO's
revenue peaked in the March quarter of 2013 and, as we mentioned, has been declining
since. There are several points of note with the charts below. The blue line represents
the percentage of searches for "travelzoo" vs. peak searches in June 2011. As you can
see, "travelzoo" is currently about 35% of peak. All the annual peaks tend to land
around June.



http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/tourist-go-home-why-youre-no-longer-welcome-in-spain/news-story/4febc459dcd721f25bc113eab6c509e5

https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=travelzoo
There is an interesting seasonal "M" pattern that is very consistent. The left peak of the
"M" is usually December and the right peak is usually June of the following year. As
searches for "travelzoo" were increasing from 2004-2011, the right peak of the "M" tends
to be higher than the left, indicating increased search momentum for "travelzoo." Once
searches peak in 2011, the left side is higher, indicating searches for "travelzoo" have
lost momentum. We believe this is directly the result of increased competition and the
move by consumers to mobile devices. Relative to peers, TZOO is a very small player in
travel. It will be very difficult for the company to regain momentum. While its business
and by extension its relevance to advertisers has shrunk, its much larger competitors
have kept growing. This further widens the gap and makes it that much more difficult for
TZOO to return the business to growth.


It's also important to note that much of its revenue growth in recent years came from the
launch of local deals in late 2010 and local getaways in 2011 to compete with Groupon
and Living Social. Entry into these categories pushed revenues to the peak in March
2013. Local deals and local getaways are no longer a driver of the business but a drag
on revenue. It does not appear that this trend will improve in the near term as
management appears focused on slowing the bleed in its core travel advertising
segment, which represents the bulk of revenue.


We also note that the re-acquired Asia Pacific division has helped boost its revenue in
recent quarters. We provide the bright red line to show what revenue would be without
the acquisition to show that the underlying business remains on a downward trend. We
are now coming upon the weakest part of the year for TZOO (Sept. - Nov.). This will add
further pressure to declining revenues.

Below, we provide a second graph that contains the same data as above but zoomed in
showing 2010 to present. The downward trend in Google search for "travelzoo" remains
firmly in place and likely will get worse as we now begin to enter the seasonally weakest
part of the year for TZOO in addition to the terrorism impact. As an example, we
highlight the recently completed month of August compared to August 2015. It is clear
TZOO still has not turned the corner. The revenue data ends with the June quarter. We
fully expect Q3 & Q4 revenue to follow the search trend downward.

Entry Into the "Local" Division Didn't Save It:


In the 4th quarter of 2010, TZOO had high hopes for its local deals business as it was
playing catch-up to Groupon and others. In its presentation for that quarter, it had a slide
that indicates the local deals opportunity to be at least $110mil in annual revenue, or a
nearly doubling of its annual business from 2010. At the time, it said revenue per
member, or subscriber as it called them back then, could reach $14.30.

You can see in the chart below that what happened instead was an initial improvement
to $8.19 in the 3rd quarter of 2011 followed by a steady decline. In the most recent
quarter, revenues per member hit a new low of $4.77. This figure will likely continue to
decline over the seasonally weak Q3 and Q4.

While revenue per member is continuing a steady decline, average cost per acquisition
of a new member is steadily increasing.


Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside Research


True Cost of New Members Far Higher Than Reported:


The chart above doesn't take into account member churn. Member churn is the result of
email unsubscribes by members, or periodic list maintenance for bad email addresses.
When we account for churn, or net new members after subtracting out members that are
churned out of the base, the cost per net new member is much, much higher. We
believe this is a critical discovery for investors in TZOO but it gets worse. The chart also
shows that while the company is spending more for net new member adds, it is actually
adding far fewer net new members. In fact, in the 4th quarter of 2014, it lost more
members than it added despite spending nearly $2mil by our estimates. We believe this
was the first time in TZOO's history that it had net negative member adds for a full
quarter.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/9/25/47406777-14748563674919648_origin.png
Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside Research


Travelzoo has often explained away the issue of declining net member adds by claiming
a focus on higher quality member adds. We don't know how it defines higher quality
members. We're only able to analyze the results, and the results tell a different story. As
it has spent more to acquire fewer but "higher quality" new members, revenue per
member has continually declined. The chart below compares revenue per member to
the cost of adding net new "higher quality" members. It is very clear that despite
increasing spend on higher quality new members, revenue per member continues to
decline. Simply put, the strategy is not working.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/9/25/47406777-14748564762967572_origin.png
Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside Research


In the most recent quarter, cost per net new member add was $10.28 and revenue per
member was $4.77. This means that unless TZOO is able to improve its revenue per
member figures, it will take about 2.15 years for TZOO just to cover the cost of acquiring
the new member. It will be even longer for the customer to go from breakeven to
profitable. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2010, at the far left of the chart, the time
to cover the cost of a new member was about .58 years, or about 7 months.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/9/25/47406777-14748565520025628_origin.png
In TZOO's first quarter 2015 call in the Q&A section Holger Bartel was asked about
member acquisitions and he states that it takes about two quarters for these more
expensive, higher quality members to begin showing results in revenue. A year and a
half later, the results still haven't arrived. What gives? We suspect that the quality of the
vast majority of the 28.9mil subscribers is far lower than the recently acquired members.
That would explain why revenue isn't improving despite TZOO's efforts. Unfortunately,
this likely implies many years of investment, as it would have to churn out a large
percentage of its member base before revenue per member improves meaningfully. In
our opinion, there's no doubt that this is a dying business.


Negative Member ROI Trends:


Based on the above, we began considering what TZOO's ROI trend might look like for
new member acquisitions. TZOO is very protective of its user metrics. It provides no
information regarding ROI on its investment in new members or member churn rates.
On several earnings calls, analysts have asked for this type of information and
management always says maybe it'll have it next time, but the next time it never does.
History has taught us that any time a company doesn't want to provide investors
information, it's probably not a good thing. Less data is never better. So we tried to see if
we could back into some of the data, it doesn't want to provide by further exploring the
data that it does provide and we found some interesting points.


First, the company appears to have about a 10% average member churn rate over the
past several years. That means that each year about 10% of its members leave.
Currently it has about 29mil members, so this year we expect it to lose about 2.9mil
members. To keep things simple, let's just call it 3mil. That means that to add a net 1mil
members to the user base to reach 30mil members, it has to add 4mil new members.
Another way to look at this is to say for every four new members it acquires, it loses
three (approximately). This is the reason net new member costs are so high. To acquire
one net new member it really has to acquire four. Unless it can reduce churn and/or
reduce member acquisition costs, this equation only gets worse as the user base grows.
That means it likely will need to continue to increase member acquisition costs going
forward just to keep the member base where it is.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/3075866-travelzoos-tzoo-ceo-christopher-loughlin-on-q1-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
Regarding member ROI what we found is truly shocking. TZOO provides revenue per
member and it calculates it by annualizing quarterly revenue and dividing it by members
at the beginning of the year. We decided to do the same thing but instead using Non-
GAAP net income as provided by the company. That gave us Non-GAPP net income per
member by quarter and we calculated that back to 2010. We calculated an ROI based
on cost of a new member as provided by the company. TZOO doesn't provide the
average life of a member, so for this we had to make an educated guess. Since the
churn is 10%, over 10 years, it will basically have replaced all of its members. Based on
this, it seems fair to assume the average life of a member is about five years. We feel
this is likely generous and if anything it is probably lower. Then we multiplied Non-GAAP
net income per member by five years to find the lifetime Non-GAAP net income value
per member. From there, it was easy to back out the acquisition cost per new member
to get to an estimated member ROI.


The results in the chart below show that TZOO's member ROI is likely trending negative
and has been since Q3 2014. We believe this largely explains the acquisition of the
APAC division in Q3 2015 as the company is essentially trying to pull out of a nosedive.
What the chart indicates is that the company is currently spending more on acquiring
new members than it can ever reasonably expect to make on them over five years.
Since we believe the average life of a member is probably less than five years, the data
could actually be considerably worse than our estimates. To put it simply, it is
investing in new members for which we expect a NEGATIVE RETURN on its
investment!!!
Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside Research


The recent improvement in the past two quarters is simply the result of staff cuts. We do
not see this as a long-term solution to its decline. Two years of investment in "higher
quality" members is not coming through in results as revenue per member continues to
reach new lows.


You Can't Cut Your Way To Growth:


If you work at TZOO today, you're likely in fear of losing your job and/or looking for
another one. Since Ralph Bartel's brother Holger Bartel was reinserted first as Chairman
and then as CEO in October 2015, it's been open season on TZOO employees. About
20% of the workforce has been let go and we suspect there's likely more on the way.
Cutting the workforce makes up the vast majority of its financial improvement and that
has led to a rally in the stock of about 60% off its lows.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/9/25/47406777-14748566474275784_origin.png
While there may still be some meat left on the bone, we feel the workforce improvement
is now mostly baked into the stock. Certainly, cleaning house is a short-term positive for
the company and shareholders, but at some point in the next couple of quarters, we feel
it is going to need to show it can actually grow revenue for the stock to continue higher.
Attempting to squeeze increased production out of fewer employees may prove to be
difficult and ultimately a major mistake. TZOO is a very small company in comparison to
peers. The fact that it cannot seem to grow and the only way to improve financial results
is to cut employees is a very negative sign for its long-term survivability. As they say,
when it comes to business if you're not growing, you're dying.

Model Crumbling Under Intense Competition:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/9/25/47406777-14748567057091174_origin.png
How competitive is the travel and local deals business? Not even Jeff Bezos was able to
successfully compete. Amazon decided it'd rather stick to easy targets like Wal-Mart
(NYSE:WMT), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rather than
compete in TZOO's industry. In April of 2015, Amazon rolled out a local hotel booking
product called Amazon Destinations. The idea was to offer "weekend getaway"
destinations similar to TZOO, GRPN, Living Social and others "getaway" products. Less
than seven months after launch, the division was shutdown with little explanation.


On the other hand, Google is increasingly looking to integrate travel into its platform.
This makes sense because it can access personal itineraries from Gmail and integrate
that information with Search and Maps. These features were just introduced to the new
Google Trips app. While Google Trips currently does not include booking capability, it
keeps the traveler engaged with Google's mobile platform by attempting to provide a
seamless travel experience.


Google has also recently launched Google Destinations, a trip planning search feature
complete with flight and hotel prices. Google rolled out the Destinations feature on
mobile in March and has just released it on desktop this month. These are the kind of
changes that could completely destroy TZOO's advertising business, which
represents the vast majority of its revenue. No wonder it is diversifying away from
advertising. Additionally, it is largely assumed that these entries into travel are the
beginning of a move by Google to directly compete with OTAs for bookings.


In light of the above, we believe TZOO is experiencing intense competition on nearly
every aspect of its current business. It offers nothing unique and is an extremely small
player that is only getting smaller. We note that its hotel booking platform has many
listings, if not most listings, offered in partnership with Travelscape LLC, a division of
EXPE. This makes TZOO nothing more than an added middleman looking for a cut of
the pie.


Its Business Is Dying:


Why is TZOO taking a huge risk attempting to transition its business into a highly
competitive category dominated by giants? One word: mobile.

As Internet traffic has rapidly transitioned from desktop to mobile advertising rates have
come under pressure. This is not good for companies like TZOO who rely on the
majority of its revenue from Internet advertising. TZOO has said in its recent 10-K that
the switch to mobile is hurting its business because advertisers are not willing to pay the
same rates for tiny mobile screens. Mobile doesn't convert as well as desktop. This is a
major problem for TZOO's business model and puts it in an extremely precarious
situation. While the local and search businesses are struggling, its bread & butter
advertising business is also struggling. Additionally, as a very small player in the space,
it is only getting smaller as traffic and ad dollars consolidate to larger advertising
platforms. It is becoming increasingly irrelevant to both consumers and advertisers over
time. Simply put, this is a dying business!


So what does a dying business do when it's been forced into a corner? In TZOO's case,
it has decided to enter the extremely competitive low margin cut-throat hotel bookings
category hoping to slow the bleed. The fact that it has no experience or technological
edge in the category doesn't factor into the decision to enter the market for one simple
reason; it has no choice. It has been backed into a corner by the move to mobile and
competition. In our opinion, it simply doesn't know what else to do. Now it is left with
convincing its user base to use it when booking planned travel.


On the surface that might not sound like much of a stretch but we believe it is. The
competition in the hotel bookings space is so intense, the competitors are so much
larger and competing technology is so much better and well established that we feel this
will be an extremely difficult market for TZOO to meaningfully penetrate. How much
larger is the competition? In 2015, EXPE had sales of $6.7bil and PCLN had sales of
$9.2bil. It's estimated that the 2016 gross worldwide travel bookings market is $1.4
trillion and growing yet somehow tiny TZOO can't find growth with a hotel booking
platform that's taken it over two years to roll out and counting.


Entry into hotel bookings also makes TZOO a competitor to some of its much larger
advertising customers. Lastly, we believe that like the local getaways business, which
cannibalized its advertising business, the hotel bookings business will also cannibalize
its revenue. The takeaway here is that the hotel bookings business should not be looked
at as a source of revenue growth. The company alluded to this point on its recent
earnings call in what we feel was a very telling explanation of how it sees the hotel
bookings business

In regards to hotel bookings business…


Analyst:


Curious about so what it is today, maybe how you think that will look maybe exiting
the year? And then maybe a couple years out kind of this going to sort of drastically
kind of change the kind of composition of your North American travel revenues over
the next few years, or is it going to kind of just be sort of a complement to kind of the
core business?


CEO Holger Bartel then downplays the hotel bookings opportunity:


I mean hotels is only part of our business…so hotel is only a part of our revenues and
then again commissions on hotels are again just a part of hotel. So just keep that in
mind.


CFO Glen Ceremony follows up stating they are reacting to mobile and implies hotel
bookings will cannibalize existing business:


Not a not a significant portion right now and I wouldn't expect it to be dramatically
larger by the end of the year as you remember. There are a few reasons why we got
into this business; one was just those trends on mobile, we wanted a solution that
we could give our members a good experience on the hotel deals that we represent.
And one thing, nothing's changed, we're still presenting really amazing hotel deals.
It's just the way we're presenting that is different and the way we're monetizing that is
changing. And there is - I would say a gradual shift from our advertising and the
voucher-based hotel products to this hotel platform.


When a company says it is shifting" its revenue, it is cannibalizing revenue.


Hotel Bookings Are Not The Answer:
EXPE and PCLN have been consolidating the industry for the past several years and
now dominate travel bookings. Meanwhile, TZOO has been hung out to dry. For
example, Expedia has purchased Hotwire, Travelocity, Orbitz, Trivago and HomeAway.
Priceline has purchased Kayak, Booking.com, Hotel Ninjas, Rocketmiles, OpenTable
and others. Many of the companies purchased were formed long after TZOO. Why has
TZOO been continuously passed over?


For one, competitors have continued to innovate and rapidly grow revenue, even
smaller competitors that had a far later start than TZOO. From a technology perspective,
competitors are years ahead of anything TZOO has to offer. TZOO on the other hand
has taken a reactionary approach, only investing in the business model and changing
directions when threatened.


As if the market for hotel booking wasn't already competitive enough, customer review
and metasearch company TripAdvisor entered hotel booking in the US in 2014. Its
product, which is called Instant Booking, just fully rolled out globally in the 2nd quarter of
this year. This also appears to be a reactionary move as it has also felt a negative
impact from the move to mobile. Like TZOO, it mainly relies on Internet advertising
revenue to drive its business.


Neither TZOO nor TRIP was the first advertising-based travel business to attempt a
transition to hotel booking. That title belongs to Kayak. Kayak attempted to enter hotel
booking in 2004. Kayak co-founder and CEO Stephen Hafner thinks TripAdvisor will
ultimately regret going the hotel bookings route and eventually get out, like it did. So far,
TRIP has had a rough go of it in instant bookings. A key metric for TRIP, revenue per
hotel shopper was down 19% in Q2 driven by difficulties in transitioning to Instant
Booking and mobile trends. TRIP revenue in the quarter was $391mil compared to
TZOO at $34mil, or more than 10x TZOO revenue. If TRIP is having a difficult time
entering hotel booking and Kayak gave up on it, we believe the far smaller TZOO will
find it much more difficult.


TZOO Provides No Unique Advantage:

As hotel and travel booking has essentially become a duopoly in the past few years,
hoteliers have become concerned about the leverage EXPE and PCLN hold over them.
Increasingly, they are seeking to protect their room inventory by encouraging bookings
on their own websites. TZOO argues it is another option for hoteliers and can push
consumers directly to the hotel's website. TZOO feels this gives it an advantage over
competitors. However, we've found that EXPE & PCLN are addressing these issues.


For example, EXPE has expanded its business in advertising with its Expedia Media
Solutions division. We see this as a major threat to TZOO's advertising business. In July
of 2015, Expedia Media Solutions launched TravelAds Direct. This is in direct response
to the trend by hotels to encourage bookings on their own site instead of with the OTA.
With TravelAds Direct, hotels can now advertise on Expedia sites and when the link to
the listing is clicked, it takes the customer to a new tab on the hotel's own site.


According to Matthew Reichek, senior director of product and analytics for EXPE, "a
supplier-direct product like that would have been unthinkable for Expedia three years
ago." While TZOO is coming after hotel booking dollars with its new offering, EXPE is
coming after TZOO's advertising dollars. We believe TZOO will badly lose this battle.


This article discusses in great detail EXPE's move into advertising and based on what's
described it appears light years ahead of anything TZOO is currently focused on.
Additionally, this small internal unit formed in 2007 is already over $200mil in revenue
and growing 20% per year. TZOO, formed in 1998 closed out 2015 with $142mil in
revenue and declining. In our opinion, TZOO brings nothing to the table that Expedia
and Priceline can't do better on their own.

https://www.tnooz.com/article/up-close-with-expedias-fast-growing-ad-agency/
This issue also highlights a major point we made in our August initiation on digital
advertising company Everyday Health (NYSE:EVDY). Ad budgets go where Internet
traffic goes. Within travel, PCLN and EXPE have consolidated traffic through a
combination of growth and acquisition but they are not the only places to advertise
travel. Increasingly, the largest platforms like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are
consolidating traffic while smaller platforms suffer. These are well-established trends
that are long term in nature and not likely to change. As recent as 2007, 50% of
consumer Internet traffic came from several thousand websites, today over half the
North American traffic comes from only 35 websites. Traffic to TZOO websites peaked in
2011 with 13.8mil unique visitors per month and has been declining ever since. 2011
was also the last year TZOO provided page views.

In the meantime, while TZOO is working out the kinks on its basic hotel booking platform
where it competes with industry giants, the competition is leapfrogging it by looking to
the future. In a recent interview, Kayak CEO Steve Hafner said they are investing in "a
lot of artificial intelligence" and "services that help younger generations connect with us."
For example, it has a Facebook Messenger chat bot and interaction with Amazon's
Alexa service where you can say things like 'Hey Kayak, where can I go this weekend
for $300?' That sounds an awful lot like TZOO's turf to us. A few years from now, we
don't think TZOO will be able to compete with this kind of technology. It simply doesn't
have the technological experience, resources or scale to operate effectively in that kind
of environment.


TZOO Is Complacent and Lacks Innovation:

TZOO's entry into the "local" category is a perfect example of its reactionary approach to
competition. GRPN was formed in 2009 creating a new, innovative local deals and
getaways business model. We believe TZOO immediately recognized the threat of this
model to its business. It began competing in local deals in mid-2010. TZOO had about a
10-year head start on Groupon. How was it caught off guard? TZOO could have
buttoned up the local deals category for itself years ago if it was forward thinking and
innovative, but it let competitors slip in because it was complacent. So instead it was
forced to play catch-up with the launch of local deals after Groupon had already
leapfrogged it.


Initially, local deals were a big growth driver for TZOO and it led to its best year ever in
terms of earnings in 2011. In that year, it also launched local "getaways." Local
getaways compete with Groupon's and Living Social's getaway travel offer. Initially,
getaways also helped drive revenue but over time, it became clear that it was actually
cannibalizing its much higher-margin advertising-based travel business based on its
email list. The space was and remains extremely competitive and as we've discussed,
changing consumer purchase behavior has led to weakening results. TZOO's revenue
began rolling over in 2013 while GRPN and others also continue to struggle.


Groupon remains a major competitive threat to TZOO. 120mil people worldwide have
downloaded Groupon's app. In comparison, TZOO has had just over 5mil mobile app
downloads. In 2015, Groupon had revenue of $3.1bil compared to $142mil for TZOO. At
the time of its IPO in 2011, Groupon had 1,000 deals available worldwide. Now it has
650,000 deals worldwide. TZOO has closer to 1,000. Groupon intends to significantly
increase marketing spend to drive customer growth according to its 2015 10-K.


We're not arguing that Groupon's uber-aggressive market share at any cost approach
has been the path that TZOO should follow. Our argument is that Groupon and TZOO
are on opposite ends of the extreme. Groupon formed in 2009 now has revenue of
$3.1bil. TZOO formed in 1998 is struggling to stay above $130mil. TZOO's extremely
cautious, reactionary approach has led to years of underperformance for shareholders.
We believe this is the result of the shareholder structure of the company where one
person, the founder, holds a controlling 50+% of the stock.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490281/000149028116000087/groupon201510-k.htm
The above point illustrates a concern with TZOO. They are followers not leaders. When
TZOO was formed in 1998, it was smart to be cautious and grow slow at first, but as it
matured it should have become more aggressive to keep up with competitors that were
gobbling up the market. As a small cap company, it can no longer afford to be followers
with lagging technology that's consistently late to new markets. Unfortunately for TZOO
shareholders, we believe it's already too late.


TZOO Isn't Shareholder Friendly:


We feel the company largely has been run as the personal piggy bank of founder and
current Chief Talent Officer Ralph Bartel. Ralph Bartel currently owns 53% of TZOO. As
a result, your vote as a stockholder doesn't count. Ralph Bartel can choose to do
whatever he wishes with TZOO and there is nothing you can do about it. This has led to
some interesting decisions by the board.


For example, in November 2009, TZOO's board approved the sale of its Asia-Pacific
(NASDAQ:APAC) division to Azzurro Capital for $3.6mil. Azzurro Capital is 100% owned
by TZOO founder, former Chairman and majority shareholder Ralph Bartel. Then last
year, only six years after selling the business, TZOO bought the APAC division back
from Azzurro Capital for $22.6mil. TZOO also made holders of APAC debt whole and
the holder of debt for the APAC division was…you guessed it, Azzurro Capital. TZOO
paid $3.4mil including interest to pay back loans made by Azzurro Capital (Mr. Bartel) to
the Asia Pacific business. If we include the debt payments the acquisition price paid to
Mr. Bartel was $26mil.


In November 2014, Azzurro provided a loan to Asia Pacific of $1.0 million with a
stated interest rate of 8%. There were $1.0 million loans and $5,000 accrued interest
due to Azzurro as of December 31, 2014. From January 1, 2015 to August 20, 2015,
Azzurro provided loans to the Asia Pacific amounting to $2.2 million with a stated
interest rate of 10%. In September 2015, the Company paid the due and outstanding
principal loan amount of $3.3 million and accrued interest of $128,000.

https://skift.com/2015/08/26/travelzoo-reacquires-its-asia-pacific-business-from-founder-ralph-bartel-for-22-6-million/
For most public companies, this kind of activity would raise serious eyebrows. Not for
TZOO. Investors seem to have largely ignored the issue. A few travel news blogs have
attempted to spin it as a positive for the company. The general consensus has been that
the APAC division, which was TZOO's smallest and only started in 2007 was losing
money. So Ralph Bartel bought the division to get the losses off TZOO's books during
this growth phase. In the meantime, TZOO retained the option to buy the company back
anytime between 2011-2020. During this period, Mr. Bartel could grow the APAC
business and fund the losses to drive growth himself. Once the business was cash-
flowing positively, he could sell it back to TZOO. It's been spun as a win-win for TZOO
shareholders, which, of course, also largely benefits Mr. Bartel.


There's a problem with this theory. The APAC business is still not cash-flowing positively
and the number of APAC "members" peaked in 2011-12. Members were still in decline
when TZOO purchased APAC. Revenues have also declined from $12mil in 2013 to
$10.7mil as of 2015. Regarding the acquisition, former CEO Chris Loughlin was quoted
as stating that "the audience is over 3 million members and we are clearly past the start-
up phase." We would add that the division is not only past the "start-up" phase but has
quickly moved to the "decline" phase. Returning the division to growth will likely require
a substantial investment, an investment that TZOO shareholders were supposedly
avoiding by selling the division in the first place.


Our theory is that when the business was losing money in the 2009 recession, it was
easy to sell it cheap, hence the $3.6mil price tag. Since that time the business has
grown from about $2mil in revenue in 2009 to over $10mil, albeit now with stalled
growth. APAC is still not cash flow positive, yet the company justified paying $22.6mil
(plus another $3.4mil in debt repayment to Azzurro) to reacquire the money-losing
operation.


Our first point should be pretty obvious. Who made money on this deal? Ralph Bartel.
While the cash drain from the APAC business was being held off TZOO books, the
company was able to post profitable growth in its North American and European
divisions. Coupled with a short squeeze, the increased profit led to a large gain in the
stock, eventually breaching the $100 per share mark.



https://skift.com/2015/08/26/travelzoo-reacquires-its-asia-pacific-business-from-founder-ralph-bartel-for-22-6-million/
During this period of extreme valuation beginning in 2011 when the stock at times was
valued over 70x peak EPS, Bartel began selling TZOO stock. From April 2011 to
February 2013, he sold 3.7mil shares for gross proceeds worth $210,994,952.
We're guessing the proceeds from these sales largely offset any investments in the
APAC division by a substantial degree.


Post these sales, Mr. Bartel still remains the majority shareholder of TZOO with 7.4mil
shares or 53% of shares outstanding. The entire market cap of TZOO is $180mil dollars.
Sales of TZOO stock have netted Mr. Bartel total gross proceeds over $395mil, more
than 2x the entire market cap of TZOO. It's possible he also made a nice gain on the
sale of the APAC division back to TZOO, so that's a win-win…for Bartel.


If you were a long-term shareholder over this period you would have seen the stock hit
over $100 and then promptly drop into the $30s in 2012. Eventually, TZOO meandered
its way down into the $8s. The move was triggered by several developments, not least
of which was the fact that earnings peaked in 2011 at $1.42 per share. In 2013, a
revenue peak followed and TZOO has been dying a slow death ever since.


Zika Is A Worldwide Threat and It's Getting Nasty:


2016 was the year we were introduced to the Zika virus. Thus far, the media spin on
Zika has focused on its impact in the Caribbean, Central America, South America and
Florida. It has also been categorized as a disease that the general populous shouldn't
worry much about unless you're a female who's looking to get pregnant. However,
mainstream media has largely ignored recent discoveries about the disease and it's
beginning to spread to other tourism-heavy countries throughout the world. While the
short-term impact to tourism has been largely downplayed, we believe over the long
term, it has the potential to make certain regions of the world virtually off-limits for
tourism. The impact to travel and tourism is further exacerbated by the fact that regions
affected tend to be warm, tropical climates best suited for vacations.
We found an article in the Orlando Sentinel with quotes from Seth Forman, general
manager of destinations at TZOO. In regards to Zika, Mr. Forman claims that although
travelers have concern and anxiety regarding Zika, they are still committed to traveling
to affected destinations like Florida. According to TZOO's survey, in February, 30% of
American Travelzoo users said it would be a factor in their travel decision. That figure
increased to 40% last month. Forman also said that Zika hasn't impacted international
travel decisions much. We believe that could change in a major way.


As we're exiting the mosquito season, Zika concerns in the US are moving to the back
burner but in other parts of the world, Zika is just getting started. Recently, Asia and
Africa have become areas of concern for a major Zika outbreak, and many of these
countries are ill-prepared to handle an outbreak. Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand
have all experienced recent outbreaks and other countries including India, China, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh all contain the humid
tropical elements Zika mosquitoes typically thrive in. Singapore has confirmed at least
341 cases of Zika since August 27th and Thailand announced at least 200 infections
with many more likely unreported. China, the UK, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and
the US have all recently issued travel warnings for Singapore.


While the outbreaks are of concern, if the infection only impacts expectant mothers then
it likely won't meaningfully slow the travel industry. Increasingly, there is evidence that
Zika may harm infected adults with long-term consequences. Unfortunately, when it
comes to Zika, the best science can tell us for now is that they just don't know. At first,
they said it was only transmitted by a mosquito bite, then they found it could possibly be
transmitted via intercourse. Now there is speculation it could be transmitted by saliva,
tears or other bodily fluids.

http://www.cntraveler.com/story/us-issues-travel-advisory-for-singapore-due-to-zika
What we find most disturbing, and what we think would be a game changer for the travel
industry, is that there is some evidence that Zika can have a neurological impact on full-
grown adults. In one recent case, a woman exhibited damaged memory after
contracting Zika. Some of the effects have been described as similar to Alzheimer's and
Multiple Sclerosis. There's growing concern that Zika actually may slowly destroy the
brain's stem cells, cells responsible for developing neurons critical for learning and
memory and the long-term impact for those infected simply is an unknown. It is still early
and the implications, if true, would extend far beyond TZOO, but the impact of Zika, in
combination with terrorism concerns, present potentially major near-term hurdles for a
small company already in decline.


Here's the deal: The more we've learned about the Zika virus, the nastier it is.


~William Schaffner, infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University


The Balance Sheet Isn't As Strong As It Looks:


One of the strengths of TZOO is its cash position of $27.6mil with no debt. We note that
while this is strong, it's not as strong as it had been prior to the APAC acquisition. APAC
remains a cash burn for the company and the acquisition drew down its cash balance by
about $26mil. So the balance sheet strength has deteriorated. We also note that the
majority of the cash, $16.2mil, is held outside the US. This cash is not accessible to US
shareholders unless the cash is repatriated at the corporate tax rate of 35%. Tax
affecting the cash held outside the US results in a meaningfully smaller cash balance of
$21.9mil vs. the publicly reported $27.6mil.


Additionally, we discovered in TZOO's SEC filings that it has been under an IRS audit
for the past few years regarding the sale of the APAC unit. The IRS has issued a
Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) to TZOO concluding the company owes back taxes and
federal penalties of $31mil excluding possible additional interest and state penalties.
The IRS audit conclusion is based on its view that the APAC business that was sold to
Ralph Bartel's Azzurro Capital had a significantly higher valuation then the proceeds the
company received upon the sale. It appears that the IRS agrees with our
assessment that the sale of the APAC division to Azzurro Capital doesn't pass the
sniff test.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/08/18/zika-can-infect-adult-brain-cells-not-just-fetal-cells/
To date, TZOO has not taken a reserve for this amount. It plans to fight this decision and
will take the IRS to court if necessary. Not only is this scenario a distraction for the
company, which could impact operations, it also adds to expenses. If TZOO exhausts all
appeal options and ultimately has to pay $31mil in back taxes, it will have more than
depleted all its cash reserves if paid in full. We argue this puts TZOO in an extremely
precarious situation given the company is struggling to stem the tide of declining
revenue with no imminent signs of improvement on the horizon.


Valuation:


TZOO's earnings have improved in the past two quarters strictly due to staff reductions.
We see no signs of a turn in revenue despite increased spend on member acquisitions
that began in Q3 of 2014. The company has been rolling out a hotel bookings platform
now for over two years and appears to still be having difficulty with the transition. We
believe this is directly the result of the intensely competitive nature of the booking
industry where it has little to no background or technological advantages. The transition
to mobile is crushing its advertising revenue and increasingly as the company shrinks it
is becoming less relevant.


Currently, it is entering the seasonally weakest time of the year. In the first half, it was
able to improve earnings over 2015 solely on cost cuts. We anticipate the second half
will be better than the second half of last year but not as strong as the first half of this
year. We are modeling for 10c in EPS for the 3rd quarter followed by 6c in EPS for the
fourth quarter consistent with seasonal trends. That brings full year EPS to 44c. With the
stock around $13 per share, the company is currently trading at nearly 30x 2016
earnings. We believe this is extremely overvalued for a dying business in the early
stages of the largest operational transition in its history.
In 2017, we're anticipating the company will continue to attempt further staff reductions
but to a lesser degree as much excess will have been wrung out of the system. At the
same time, we expect investment in APAC to ramp meaningfully, specifically for member
acquisition. The company has alluded to this in its recent investor calls. It likely needs to
invest further in the hotel booking platform as well. Declining revenue in its core North
American business, which represents 63% of revenue, is likely to continue weighing
heavily on its ability to maintain long-term profitability. With 2017 looking like a year of
slack revenue with increasing costs driven by APAC, we're forecasting EPS to decline
vs. 2016. We're currently modeling for 33c in EPS for 2017.


We believe this is the most dangerous time to be an investor in TZOO in its history. The
business is in decline and the future of the company relies on making significant
progress in the hotel bookings portion of its business. The stock has already made a
major bounce purely on cost cuts so the risk now is to the downside on failure to
execute a transition to revenue growth. For the several reasons mentioned above and
based on management's own comments, the chances of successfully transitioning the
business is very low in our opinion. Therefore, we feel a 20x multiple on 2017 earnings
is more than generous. Our 12-month target price for TZOO is $6.60 per share
representing downside of approximately 50%.


If TZOO is unable to reverse what we estimate is a negative ROI on new members,
we question its survivability as a business entity. In this scenario, downside would
be closer to zero.


Conclusion:


The recent increase in TZOO shares has been driven by higher EPS for the past two
quarters of 28c and represents a solid improvement over the 11c in the first half of last
year. Unfortunately, the entire improvement has been based on cost cuts almost entirely
from staff reductions. Fundamentals continue to worsen with revenue remaining in a
long-term decline. The company is currently in the early phases of an attempt to
transition the business increasingly away from advertising into hotel bookings. Hotel
bookings are not an area where it has experience and as we've described, competition
in the space is fierce. For two years now, it has tried to roll out the hotel platform but to-
date has had little success. We believe its transition to hotel bookings will ultimately fail
due to several reasons.
Larger, better operators have tried in the past to transition to hotel bookings and
failed (see Kayak)


1.


No technological advantage over competitors2.


Little to no experience running a hotel booking operation3.


Difficulty transitioning its user base to think of it as a place to book planned travel4.


Increased competition resulting from consolidation and new entrants including TRIP,
GOOGL and Airbnb


5.


A confused user base that doesn't understand subtle differences between getaway
vouchers vs. hotel bookings vs. Top 20 vacation package offerings


6.


The local deals (vouchers) part of its business continues to decline due to competitive
pressure and a change in consumer habits from a "push" to "pull," or purchase at time of
use, mentality. These pressures are unlikely to subside.


In search, the company appears willing to allow this portion of its business to die on the
vine. It has substantially reduced investment in the division and as a result, traffic trends
continue to decline for fly.com and SuperSearch. Again, competitive pressures appear
to be the culprit for the decline. We see no reason for a reversal in this trend.


We do not believe TZOO has been able to achieve the "critical mass" in travel, local or
search necessary for long-term survival. Despite the fact that the Internet advertising
industry is consistently growing about 10% per year, TZOO's revenue has been in
decline since 2013. Mobile is now approaching 50% of digital ad spend and over time,
this is likely to grow. TZOO has found mobile difficult to monetize due to lower click-
through and conversion rates on mobile vs. desktop. This trend will continue to
negatively impact its business.

As one of the earliest adopters to Internet advertising, TZOO has had plenty of
opportunity to capitalize on the shift to digital. For several years, it was able to ride the
tailcoats of this shift but the days of easy growth are over. As technology has advanced,
TZOO hasn't reinvested enough to stay ahead of the competition. Like Kodak or Sears
(NASDAQ:SHLD), we believe that TZOO became too comfortable in its niche and hasn't
stayed ahead of the curve. History is riddled with examples of companies that failed to
anticipate a changing marketplace. In most cases, by the time, they figure it out and try
to "play catch-up", it's too late. This accurately describes TZOO's current situation.


While members continue to grow, revenue per member is consistently down while cost
per new member continues higher. Additionally, when accounting for churn the
acquisition cost of new members is far higher than reported by the company. Long term,
these trends are unsustainable. The company claims it is acquiring higher quality
members to justify the cost but there is no evidence of this in the financials. We believe
there is no reasonable basis to assume it can make money on the members it is now
acquiring, resulting in a negative ROI. It is also being impacted by issues like terrorism
and we feel Zika could present a bigger issue for TZOO than is currently assumed.


In our opinion, the company is not shareholder-friendly due to the fact that the founder
owns over 50% of the company. This has led to a lack of innovation and questionable
financial arrangements. There is no opportunity for shareholder activism to improve
operations at TZOO.
