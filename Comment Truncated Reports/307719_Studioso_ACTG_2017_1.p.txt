Why	Buy	Veritone	Stock	When	Acacia	Research	Is	Trading	At	A
Substantial	Discount	To	Book	Value?

Summary


Veritone	stock	has	soared	in	recent	weeks,	rising	from	$7.87	on	August	18	to	$65.91
on	September	26,	a	rise	of	over	737%	in	less	than	six	weeks.


This	is	mainly	due	to	a	positive	mention	in	a	Barron's	article	on	August	18,	and	the
737%	increase	in	such	a	short	period	is	excessive.


VERI’s	growth	in	expenses	is	outpacing	its	increase	in	revenues,	and	its	losses	are
increasing.


Acacia	Research	owns	over	4	million	shares	of	Veritone	and	is	trading	at	a
substantial	discount	to	book	value	following	the	latter’s	dramatic	surge.


Veritone	(VERI)	completed	its	IPO	on	May	12	amid	little	fanfare.	The	company	sold	2.5
million	shares	at	a	price	of	$15.00	per	share.	On	its	first	day	of	trading,	the	company’s
stock	traded	as	high	as	$15.64,	but	by	August	18,	it	had	fallen	to	a	close	of	$7.87.


Barron's	Article


On	August	18,	Barron's	published	an	article	which	made	a	brief	one-sentence	mention	of
Veritone	in	a	general	discussion	about	artificial	intelligence.


That	was	enough	to	fuel	a	49%	surge	in	the	stock	on	the	next	trading	day,	Monday	August
21,	to	a	close	of	$11.75.	There	has	been	little	fundamental	news	to	explain	the	stock’s
continued	rise	to	the	September	26	close	of	$65.91.

The	company’s	most	recent	SEC	filing	was	its	10-Q	for	the	June	30	quarter,	which	was
filed	on	August	8.	The	only	company	press	release	since	the	Barron's	article	was	an
announcement	about	management’s	attendance	at	some	investor	conferences	in	early
September.	One	would	hope/assume	that	if	material	information	was	provided	at	those
conferences,	then	the	company	would	have	filed	an	8-K	in	order	for	the	information	to	be
available	to	all	investors.


Other	companies	have	released	press	releases	about	Veritone	in	recent	weeks	(Dalet
Digital	Media	Systems	on	September	14	and	Quantum	on	September	20).	However,	it	is
important	to	note	that	in	both	instances,	Veritone	did	not	bother	to	publish	its	own	PRs,
which	strongly	suggests	the	information	is	immaterial.


The	simplest	explanation	for	Veritone’s	surge	is	that	the	stock	is	simply	enjoying	a	surge
fuelled	by	hype	and	momentum,	initially	sparked	by	the	Barron's	article.	The	momentum
has	been	particularly	strong	in	the	month	of	September.	The	stock	closed	on	August	31	at
$15.56.	In	the	17	trading	sessions	in	September,	the	stock	has	risen	15	times,	and	one	of
the	two	declines	was	a	trivial	loss	of	$0.07.

The	hype	surrounding	Veritone	relates	to	its	artificial	intelligence	business.	However,	in	the
company’s	most	recent	quarter,	revenue	from	this	business	was	a	mere	$348,000	and
represented	less	than	10%	of	the	company’s	total	revenue	of	$4,087,000.


Multiplying	this	total	revenue	figure	by	4	(to	estimate	an	annual	figure),	we	get	$16.348
million.	With	the	large	increases	in	the	company’s	share	price,	the	company	now	fetches	a
market	capitalization	of	$985	million,	which	gives	Veritone	a	price	to	revenue	ratio	of
(985/16.348)	over	60!


Furthermore,	despite	the	company’s	significant	increase	in	revenue,	expenses	also
increased	by	a	similar	percentage,	and	the	company’s	losses	in	Q2	2017	were	higher	than
those	in	Q2	2016.


Given	this,	it’s	difficult	to	see	the	company’s	path	to	profitability,	and	we	don’t	believe	that
a	multiple	of	over	60	times	revenue	can	be	justified.


Acacia	Research	Ownership	Of	Veritone


Regardless	of	one’s	opinion	of	Veritone’s	valuation,	an	interesting	quasi-arbitrage	exists
with	a	related	company.	Acacia	Research	(ACTG)	owns	4,119,521	shares	of	VERI,	as	well
as	(deep	in	the	money)	warrants	to	buy	another	809,400	shares	at	$13.61.


Based	on	the	September	26	close	of	$65.91,	we	can	compute	the	value	of	ACTG’s
ownership	as	follows:


Stock:	4,119,521	*	65.91	=	271,517,629

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4109833-buy-veritone-stock-acacia-research-trading-substantial-discount-book-value 4/8


Warrants:	809,400	*	(65.91	–	13.61)	=	$42,331,620


Total	ownership:	$271,517,629	+	42,331,620	=	$313,849,249


Given	a	market	capitalization	of	$255	million,	ACTG’s	stake	in	VERI	is	worth	more	than
the	publicly	traded	value	of	ACTG’s	stock.	We	should	note	that	it’s	reasonable	to	assign	a
discount	to	ACTG’s	shareholding,	given	that	it	would	be	difficult	to	sell	all	4.928	million
shares	at	$65.91.	Using	the	“estimated	discount	for	lack	of	marketability”	of	6.5%	as
disclosed	on	page	11	of	ACTG’s	most	recent	10-Q,	we	arrive	at	the	following	figures:


Total	shareholding	(assuming	warrant	exercise)	4,119,521	+	809,400	=	4,928,921


Share	price	used	for	calculation	65.91	–	(6.50%	*	65.91)	=	$61.63


Value	of	shares	after	discount	4,928,921	*	61.63	=	$303,748,946


Cash	outlay	to	exercise	warrants	809,400	*	13.61	=	$11,015,934


Net	value	of	shareholding	303,748,946	–	11,015,934	=	$292,733,012


Despite	the	application	of	this	discount,	ACTG’s	stake	is	worth	$292.733	million,	higher
than	its	market	capitalization	of	$255	million.	This	is	even	before	we	consider	the	other
assets	on	ACTG’s	balance	sheet!


Acacia	Research:	Background	And	Balance	Sheet	Analysis


According	to	page	5	of	its	10-Q,	Acacia	Research	invests	in,	licenses,	and	enforces
patented	technologies.	The	company’s	balance	sheet	as	at	June	30	is	shown	below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4109833-buy-veritone-stock-acacia-research-trading-substantial-discount-book-value 5/8


As	at	June	30,	the	company	had	stockholders’	equity	of	$243.696	million,	excluding	the
non-controlling	interests	in	operating	subsidiaries.	However,	as	at	that	date,	Veritone’s
stock	price	was	a	mere	$11.71.	On	page	11	of	Acacia’s	10-Q,	it	disclosed	that	the	stock
was	valued	at	$45.104	million,	and	the	warrants	(at	the	time,	out	of	the	money!)	were
valued	at	$4.713	million.	Therefore,	the	total	value	of	Acacia’s	stake	was	valued	at	45.104
+	4.713	=	$49.817	million.


Using	the	figure	of	$292.733	million	calculated	above,	this	represents	an	increase	of
$242.916	million.


Acacia	Research:	Liquidation	Analysis


For	the	three	months	ended	June	30,	Acacia	had	expenses	of	$24.381	million	and
recorded	a	loss	of	$7.924	million.


Q3	is	almost	complete,	and	it’s	reasonable	to	assume	the	company	has	incurred	a	similar
level	of	expenses	for	this	quarter.


In	order	to	be	conservative,	let’s	also	assume	that	apart	from	the	upwards	revaluation	in
Acacia’s	stake	in	Veritone,	it	had	no	other	revenue.


We’ll	also	discount	Acacia’s	other	assets	as	follows:


Asset June	30	value	($


millions)


Discount


(millions)


Writedown	($


millions)


Patents 75.233 100% 75.233


Short-term


investments


55.052 6.50% 3.578


Accounts	receivable 14.245 10.00% 1.425


Total 80.236


Therefore,	our	rough	approximation	for	Acacia’s	net	assets	can	be	calculated	as	follows:


(values	in	$	millions) (per	share	values)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4109833-buy-veritone-stock-acacia-research-trading-substantial-discount-book-value 6/8


ACTG	stockholders’	equity	as	at	June	30 243.696 $4.82


plus	increase	in	value	in	VERI	stake 242.916 $4.80


less	expenses	for	Q3 (24.381) -$0.48


less	writedown	in	assets	as	tabled	above (80.236) -$1.59


Approximate	liquidation	value 381.995 $7.55


Net	assets	(excluding	asset	writedowns) 462.231 $9.14


The	third	column	in	the	table	above	shows	the	per-share	values	based	on	50,597,449
ACTG	shares	as	at	June	30.	As	we	can	see	from	the	second-last	row,	our	approximate
liquidation	value	for	ACTG	is	$7.55,	about	49%	higher	than	the	September	26	close	of
$5.05.	If	we	ignore	the	asset	writedowns,	ACTG	looks	even	better,	with	net	assets	of
$9.14	per	share,	more	than	80%	higher	than	the	last	traded	price	of	$5.05.


Future	VERI	Stock	Sales?


Part	of	the	reason	for	VERI’s	high	valuation	is	that	only	2.5	million	of	its	shares	are
publicly	traded,	compared	to	the	total	shares	outstanding	of	14,956,068.	The	customary
180-day	lockup	period	following	the	company’s	IPO	expires	on	November	8,	at	which	time
insiders	(including	but	not	limited	to	Acacia)	will	be	able	to	sell	their	stock.


Given	the	massive	increase	in	the	company’s	shares	since	the	May	12	IPO,	we	can
assume	that	insiders	will	want	to	sell	some	or	all	of	their	stakes	when	the	lockup	expires.
We	also	agree	with	another	Seeking	Alpha	author’s	view	that	VERI	is	likely	to	sell
additional	stock,	given	that	it	has	only	two	years	of	cash	remaining	at	current	cash	burn
rates.


Regardless	of	the	absolute	valuation	of	VERI,	we	believe	that	ACTG,	with	a	market
capitalization	of	only	$255	million,	offers	compelling	relative	value	to	VERI,	which	has
ballooned	to	a	market	capitalization	of	$985	million.	It’s	difficult	to	imagine	that	VERI	can
continue	to	be	valued	at	3.86	times	ACTG	for	much	longer.	The	chart	below	shows	the
ratio	of	VERI’s	stock	price	to	ACTG’s	stock	price.

Possible	Veritone	Acquisition	of	Acacia?


If	this	valuation	disparity	continues,	it	would	make	sense	for	VERI	to	make	an	all-stock
offer	to	acquire	ACTG,	in	order	to	buy	the	latter	at	a	discount	to	book	value,	and	to	access
Acacia’s	healthy	balance	sheet,	which	includes	$63.22	million	of	cash,	amongst	other
assets.


Specifically,	Veritone	could	offer	to	buy	Acacia	for	4,928,921	shares	of	VERI.


4,928,921	shares	of	VERI	*	$65.91	=	$324.865	million


$324.865	million/50.597	million	shares	of	ACTG	outstanding	=	$6.42	per	ACTG	share.


This	represents	a	premium	of	27%	to	the	last	traded	price	of	$5.05	for	ACTG.


In	this	scenario,	Veritone	would	issue	4,928,921	new	shares	to	ACTG	shareholders,	for
the	acquisition,	but	it	would	also	receive	the	4,928,921	shares	owned	by	ACTG.
Therefore,	there	would	be	a	net	stock	issuance	of	zero.	The	net	effect	of	this	hypothetical
acquisition	would	be	to	acquire	Acacia’s	other	assets	(cash,	investments,	patents)	at	no
cost	to	Veritone.

We	believe	that	on	an	absolute	basis,	VERI	is	overvalued	and	is	trading	at	current	levels
almost	entirely	based	on	hype	and	momentum.	On	a	relative	value	basis,	we	doubt	VERI
can	continue	to	be	valued	at	3.86	times	the	value	of	ACTG	for	much	longer,	especially
with	the	November	8	lockup	expiry	just	around	the	corner.
