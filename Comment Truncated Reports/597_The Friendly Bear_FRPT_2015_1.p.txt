Combine A Bulldog With A Shih Tzu, And You Get Freshpet

Summary


The bankers who took Freshpet public did "too good a job".


Sell-side analysts are now caught between a rock and a hard place as they try to
justify the stock's egregious IPO/current valuation.


The sell side is omitting crucial facts from their analysis in order to prop Freshpet's
stock.


Freshpet is going to free fall as soon as the sell side gets a reality check.


We don't know about you, but we absolutely love award shows. And with the Oscars and
Grammy's now both behind us, we have been starved for a new award show. So we
decided to create our own. We don't know much about movies or music, but we do know a
little bit about stock research.


So today, we are announcing the inaugural edition of the "All-Hype" research awards. The
All-Hype award is a special designation for sell-side analysts who have gone above and
beyond in their research to find new, creative, and innovative ways of propping the stock
prices of absurd companies.


Winners must do far more than just publish hyperbolic research. They must demonstrate
an ability to give life to stocks that, in the absence of sell-side coverage, would not even
be viable standalone public companies.


And today, we are excited to announce our first nominee to 2015's All-Hype Team - the
Goldman Sachs Consumer Packaged Goods Investment Research Team.


However, we are firm believers in the phrase "it takes a whole village to raise a child". In
the case of Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT), it appears to have taken a whole underwriting
group to prop up the stock. So we would also like to extend special recognition to the
broader sell-side community covering Freshpet that has rallied in support of this flimsy
IPO, misconstruing even the most marginally positive data point as the basis for stock
price upgrades.

While we generally avoid weighing in on stocks with exceptionally high levels of short
interest, and where borrow is unobtainable, we could not help ourselves in the case of
FRPT.


Before we are accused of being overly sensational, we thought it would be helpful to share
with readers a headline we saw from the most recent Credit Suisse research regarding
Freshpet:

We found an actual picture of a short seller "having a great fall" in response to the Credit
Suisse note:

Humor aside, we thought that the purpose of sell-side research is to analyze and assess
the fundamental strengths and weaknesses of a company. We didn't think the purpose of
sell-side research was to attack short sellers!


Perhaps we could understand the attacks if Freshpet's stock had been languishing
following its IPO. But with the stock sitting at a cool ~45% premium to its IPO price, we
cannot help but wonder why the sell side has taken such an aggressive stance against the
short interest in Freshpet's stock.


Take the time to browse through research reports on Freshpet, and you will see comment
after comment that either "refutes the bear thesis" or that outright claims the "shorts are
wrong".


In the case of Freshpet, we understand that the underwriters of this IPO are likely quite
sensitive to negative reports, given the sheer volume of short reports that were circulated
following the company's IPO, and given the flimsy nature of this company's business
model. In fact, we cannot even recall an instance in which the sell side has paid this level
of attention to short reports. The underwriter attack on the shorts itself should raise
serious red flags for anyone analyzing Freshpet.


In this article, we explain why we believe the sell side is so near-term focused on
squeezing the shorts. This article is also meant to be educational, as we think readers
would benefit from learning more about how misaligned incentives drive stock research
decisions. We also explore the reasons why we believe Freshpet's stock is going to crater
once the sell-side support for the stock languishes.


Diving Deeper into the All-Hype Team Award


By now, you must be wondering why Goldman's crack team deserves this rather special
award. The judges of the All-Hype Team Award deliberated for many weeks to determine
the winner, and compiled a portfolio of evidence to help justify the decision. We evaluated
candidates based on a number of factors.


Approach to Valuation


The first category we took into consideration was "approach to valuation". We could not
help but lead with the chart below, as we believe it speaks to the absurdity of sell-side
research on this name. In the chart below, Freshpet, a company that will continue to burn
significant amounts of cash for the foreseeable future and generated $37M of losses in

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3051856-combine-a-bulldog-with-a-shih-tzu-and-you-get-freshpet 4/22


2014, is compared against best-in-class and highly profitable growth companies such as
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN), and Restoration
Hardware (NYSE:RH).


Wait a minute. CMG? DNKN? RH? What do a best-in-class casual dining operator, a
donut company, and a high-end home furnishings store have to do with a pet food
company?


Even a third-grader knows the answer to that question: absolutely nothing.


But when a lead underwriting bank is looking for ways to justify the valuation of a recent
IPO, unrelated high-flying stocks have a way of creeping into the comp set.


Why not throw Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) on there for good measure? We can't think of
anything that goes together better with yoga pants than refrigerated pet food.

Not only are the comps irrelevant, but Goldman is valuing the business based on 2018
estimated EBITDA in order to justify its target price for Freshpet.


We cannot fathom how anyone other than a muppet would ever buy into this egregious
valuation framework.


Let's put Freshpet's valuation into context. HAIN, a human food CPG company that also
focuses on the organic food trend, has over $2.5B in revenues and trades for a ~$7B
valuation. The company is also highly profitable, generating over $300M of EBITDA
annually. Freshpet, on the other hand, has $87M in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of
$5.7M (we won't dive into the absurdity of Freshpet's adjusted EBITDA metric in this
article, but we remind readers that we have observed dozens of JOBS ACT IPOs that are
riddled with "adjustments" that would make even Enron blush).


In other words, Goldman wants you to believe that Freshpet is a conviction-list buy,
when it is a cash-burning machine that generates only 3% of HAIN's revenues, under 2%
of HAIN's EBITDA, yet has a valuation that currently represents over 10% of HAIN's
valuation. By this simple heuristic alone, Freshpet appears to be at least around 3-5x
overvalued.


The bulls on this name will now complain that our simple analysis ignores the "growth
potential at Freshpet".


So let's put Freshpet's supposed growth potential into context.


What if we told you that there was a retailer with over 13,000 locations that still
somehow lost money.


Any way you cut it - that is what Freshpet represents. It is a "store within a store" concept.
Each fridge represents a Freshpet "store location". In other words, Freshpet may have set
a record for generating the most atrocious level of profitability ever seen in a company
with such a broad store footprint. The company's future growth needs to be looked at in
context of its already massive store footprint. In fact, if you told us you had found a
company with over 13,000 retail locations that still loses money, the only "list" we would
add it to would be the "Companies That Are Too Ridiculous to Possibly Exist" list.


Items Conveniently Missing from Research Reports

The next category we assessed in our All-Hype award was "items conveniently missing
from research reports". The bulls on Freshpet obviously point to the company's M&A
takeout potential as being a key tenet of their bull case. First of all - if anyone wanted to
buy the company, the transaction would have likely occurred in lieu of an IPO. Private
equity sponsors are well aware of the time value of money and focus on IRR, because this
is what limited partners are focused on.


In other words, if the private equity sponsors had an opportunity to exit their investment in
Freshpet all at once, they would have jumped at the chance rather than being stuck with
stock they need to dribble out through a series of secondary offerings and block trades.


In order to frame the M&A opportunity, Goldman points to the precedent transactions
listed below:


We see a rather obvious problem in the chart above. Where are all the pet food
companies? There is not a single pet food transaction listed in the table above. Was
Goldman unable to find a single pet food transaction with which to estimate Freshpet's
M&A takeout potential value? Goldman's table would lead us to believe that there have
been no pet food related transactions in recent history.


So we did a quick Google search, and this one popped up from February 2015. That's
right folks - February 2015 - a little over a month ago:

(Source: J.M. Smucker Press Release)


We were wondering why Goldman never published about this highly relevant transaction.
This is arguably one of the most notable deals in pet food M&A ever. SJM acquired Big
Heart Pet Brands - one of the largest portfolios of pet food brands in the U.S. - for $5.8B.
That's a big deal! Perhaps the sell side had not heard of it?


Turns out that can't be the case, given that the same GS team that covers FRPT also
covers SJM.


So perhaps something else explains why no one on the sell side is talking about this deal.


The price paid by SJM for Big Heart represented ~2.5x May 2015 TTM sales and ~13x
May 2015 TTM EBITDA. If we applied that valuation range to FRPT, we'd arrive at a value
of somewhere around $7/share. Even applying a 30% premium to that range (for the
supposed "growth" at Freshpet) would only get you to at best a $10 stock price - still 33%
below IPO price and more than 50% below the current price.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3051856-combine-a-bulldog-with-a-shih-tzu-and-you-get-freshpet 8/22


It is even more troubling that in Goldman's March 2015 upgrade piece, the SJM
transaction was not even mentioned once!


Ask yourselves this question. Do the lead underwriters of this IPO want to come out
and admit that they just sold stock to the public at a valuation that lacks any real
support? Probably not…


Now we started wondering. Maybe those guys at Goldman just missed that one
transaction because it came out after they initiated on Freshpet. Maybe there have been
no other deals in the pet food space for the past 20 years for them to use as precedents.
So we did a little digging. Shockingly, we found 14 pet food transactions that took place in
the past 16 years. Given the vast resources of Goldman Sachs, we are pretty sure that if
they had bothered to do the digging, they would have found these transactions as well.
We are sure we are missing some, but the evidence is clear that pet food companies do
not trade for the types of valuations Goldman would have you believe.


Which begs the question - why were none of these transactions included in the pet food
M&A transaction tables? Maybe because the EV/EBITDA multiples implied in prior pet
food deals would get you to a stock price that is more than 50% below the IPO price
of Freshpet.


Engineering a Short Squeeze to Prime a Stock for Secondary Action
5/23/2018 Combine A Bulldog With A Shih Tzu, And You Get Freshpet - Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3051856-combine-a-bulldog-with-a-shih-tzu-and-you-get-freshpet 9/22


Arguably the most important category when deciding the winner of the "All-Hype" team
award is the "ability to successfully engineer a short squeeze". Goldman, yet again,
demonstrated excellence in this category with the addition of Freshpet to its coveted
"Conviction List" a few weeks ago.


This is one of the few instances in which we understand the logic of their analysis. With
days to cover currently sitting at 42, and an upcoming lockup expiration on May 6, we
understand that the underwriters of FRPT needed to do something to keep the stock price
alive and healthy ahead of the lockup expiry, so that the secondary is successfully priced
at above IPO price (it never looks good for secondary offerings to price below the IPO).


According to reports, the lead sponsor in the Freshpet deal is currently actively fundraising
for its next private equity fund. Limited partners always like to see realizations as part of a
PE fundraising process. Given the pet food company valuation framework we laid out
above, we believe that any prudent fiduciary will be jamming down the sell button the
moment the lockup expiration hits. So expect even more positive sell-side coverage
through the May 6 lockup expiration, including reports with titles such as "Freshpet
Freezer Expansion Gives Short Sellers the Chills."


You may also be wondering why the sell side and management harped on velocity
improvements so strongly following the recent earnings call. Velocity - which the sell side
appears to be measuring by looking at year-over-year changes in revenue per fridge - had
been slowing up until the 4th quarter. While velocity appears to have improved in the most
recent quarter, we point out that management did not really provide much color on how or
why the velocity improved. One way velocity can improve is simply by cramming more pet
food into the fridges (which would accelerate sales into the channel, but has no impact on
retail sell-through). This would make near-term velocity look like it is optically improving
(because Freshpet's measured revenues are based on wholesale revenues rather than
actual consumption at retail). Perhaps, however, advertising campaigns are working, and
the business is actually seeing some positive momentum. An IPO can often help raise
short-term awareness, for example.


So we caution investors to do their homework before reading too much into headline
velocity improvement.


One of the key variables to the short thesis on this stock that was conveniently ignored by
the sell side is the fridge growth potential. The company said it would only deliver between
15,100 and 15,600 fridges this year. Heading into the quarter, Goldman expected the

5/23/2018 Combine A Bulldog With A Shih Tzu, And You Get Freshpet - Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3051856-combine-a-bulldog-with-a-shih-tzu-and-you-get-freshpet 10/22


company to deliver 15,700 fridges. This is very clearly a downward revision to guidance.
The sell side is now claiming that this range simply reflects conservatism (management
echoed this sentiment on the earnings call).


We therefore wonder why no one is now asking why the company was running around
being overly aggressive in its original IPO guidance, given that the IPO took place only a
few months ago. Did the company not believe in conservatism when it was trying to
get its IPO done?


Could it be that in reality the company is starting to find it harder to add fridges? Fridges
have been contributing over 2/3rd of top line growth, so if fridge growth is slowing, this
would put the company's ability to meet its guidance at significant risk. Furthermore, what
does this imply for 2016 estimates? And why did no sell-side analyst push on this point or
even publish on this point? Were they too busy "busting the shorts" to bother to ask? Is
this perhaps an inconvenient question to ask right ahead of a secondary offering?


Even if the company is able to sustain its current "velocity" level of 12% (revenue per
fridge growth), it needs to put up ~18% fridge growth annually, in order to remain a 30%
compounding top line story. This goal is not only aggressive, but is also farcical in light of
the company's commitment to not increasing advertising spending at all and based on its
rapidly slowing fridge growth. Even if the company were to hit these goals, it would still be
grossly overvalued, based on any M&A precedents we have found (i.e., real M&A
precedents, not the irrelevant ones used by the sell side).


Finally, we wanted to point out another glaring problem with the sell-side analysis of this
company. One of the main elements of the short thesis on Freshpet has revolved around
the absurd incremental margin guidance provided by the company. Below, we have
plotted the incremental margin actually realized in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, as well as the
incremental margins implied in the Goldman Sachs model for Freshpet for each quarter in
2015.

(Source: Our analysis/calculations and Goldman Sachs Investment Research model
estimates as of December 2014. "P" denotes a GS projection data point.)


We have yet to ever see a 30%+ top line grower that is able to put up incremental margins
that are equal to or above gross margins. Sustaining top line growth of 30%+ requires
incremental investment in opex (advertising, people, facilities, etc.).


Is Freshpet somehow immune to the inflationary forces that require even mature
businesses to increase their annual opex spend? Adding to the ridiculousness of the
guidance is that this company is in the midst of adding a new facility, in which it will
presumably need to add more heads. How in the world are incremental margins going
to improve so much in the back half when this company is in expansion mode?


Oops. Our apologies. We are asking too many tough questions. We forgot that to be a
successful sell-side analyst, your first job is to hide any possible data point that would
paint your recent IPOs in a negative light.


Ignoring a CEO's Past Ventures


Lastly, while a smaller issue of consideration, one other category we used to judge the
recipient of the "All-Hype" award was "the inability to judge a CEO's history of execution".


It takes passion for product to be a successful entrepreneur. So we admire Mr. Thompson
for being so passionate about his product that he actually ate dog food on live TV in front
of the whole world.

You may be wondering what Mr. Thompson was doing prior to eating dog food on national
television. While the sell side has played up his involvement in Meow Mix to try to create
the illusion of robust M&A potential at Freshpet, few sell-side analysts have asked about
his foray at American Italian Pasta.


From his prospectus biography:


Mr. Richard Thompson has been a member of our Board of Directors since
December 2010 and has served as Chief Executive Officer since January 2011
when MidOcean made its initial investment in us. From 2007 to 2010, Mr. Thompson
made investments in various businesses including ZooToo, an online community for
pet lovers. He served as Chief Executive Officer of The Meow Mix Company from
2002 until its sale to Del Monte Foods in 2006. Mr. Thompson has been involved in a
number of successful ventures, including the American Italian Pasta Company,
which he founded in 1985 and where he served as its President and Chief Executive
Officer from 1986 to 1991. Mr. Thompson provides the Board of Directors with
knowledge of the daily affairs of the Company, public company experience and
expertise in the consumer products industry.


His biography fails to mention that Mr. Thompson stayed on as a Board member at
American Italian Pasta all the way until 2006. He ultimately resigned 2 days after the
company announced to the market that it was taking a massive accounting charge and
5/23/2018 Combine A Bulldog With A Shih Tzu, And You Get Freshpet - Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3051856-combine-a-bulldog-with-a-shih-tzu-and-you-get-freshpet 13/22


being investigated by the SEC. Some years following Thompson's departure, the SEC
charged the company with accounting fraud. Thompson was never accused of any
wrongdoing by the SEC, but we did find this excerpt in a class action lawsuit following the
accounting problems at American Italian Pasta:


Yet another item not mentioned in Thompson's biography is his company called
Thompson's Nutritional Technology. According to this article, Thompson founded a pasta-
based pet food company, Thompson's Nutritional Technology, in 1994. The company filed
for bankruptcy in 2000, shortly after he resigned from the company.


It appears Thompson has some history of resigning right before things get ugly at
companies he founded.


Despite being highly analogous to Freshpet (i.e. a supposedly "disruptive pet food
company"), sell-side reports also failed to mention his involvement in this "pasta pet food"
company.


Summary


The sell-side analysts covering Freshpet have done anything to refute a "velocity
deceleration" short thesis. Why would that be? Simple: to change the focus of the
discussion.


When did the "short thesis" on Freshpet solely hinge on a "velocity deceleration" pitch?


Velocity is just one small component of the short thesis on Freshpet. It also happens to be
the variable that is most readily under management's control, and the variable that is most
likely to upside surprise in the first quarters following an IPO (how many other IPOs have
we seen flame out after a few quarters of strong growth out the gate). In other words,
shifting the discussion to velocity is a fantastic way to distract an audience.

Shift focus to velocity, and you no longer have to answer questions about how to
appropriately value a pet food company. Shift focus to velocity, and you can gloss over the
miss on fridge guidance. Shift focus to velocity, and you can ignore the absurd implied
incremental margins embedded in guidance.


Not one sell-side analyst has been willing to talk about actual pet food M&A comps,
including the recent Big Heart deal, because these comps would suggest Freshpet is
65%+ overvalued. It would also suggest that the underwriters sold their clients a massively
overvalued IPO.


Not one sell-side analyst has ever bothered to ask the question "How could a company
have over 13,000 store locations and not make any money?"


And finally, not one sell-side analyst has pushed on why the company is now guiding
down fridge growth. Any other growth stock trading on a revenue multiple would have
been lambasted for even the slightest miss out the gate, but not only does Freshpet get a
pass, it gets a pat on the back for now choosing to "be conservative".


With Blue Buffalo's IPO around the corner, we think anyone analyzing Freshpet needs to
look at sell-side research in context of the upcoming Blue Buffalo IPO, which underwriters
will be vying for, given the lucrative fees.


We also have GREAT news for the underwriter group. In our research, we uncovered a
new "disruptive" pet food company that seems to be right up the alley of the Freshpet
underwriters.


Through ABC's Shark Tank television show, we discovered a company that is
manufacturing pet frozen yogurt. The company's management team came on the Shark
Tank television program to try to convince the Sharks to provide them with expansion
capital.

(Source: ABC and Facebook)


The Sharks ultimately walked away from the deal because they thought valuation
expectations were stretched, and they also had questions around the scalability of
perishable pet foods (hmmm... does that sound familiar?).


That's when we had a brilliant idea. Why don't the underwriters of Freshpet's IPO help
"The Bear & The Rat" with their capital raise. Sure, pet dessert is a smaller addressable
market than pet "main courses", but given the unique ability of this underwriter group to
hype up the valuations of fresh pet food companies, we figure they can find a way to raise
capital for this company for at least a $100 million valuation!
