China Agritech: more photos - more detail
In the last post I (erroneously) showed pictures of a gate of a plant supposedly leased to China
Agritech. This was the photo as supplied to me. 
 
The sequence was that the American lawyer in Shanghai who I hired to do this project had a (junior)
colleague in Anhui for New Year. Her family came from Anhui. 
 
She visited the site. She got several photos of the plant by poking in the Window but did not supply a
photo of the gate. I have included one - it is a metal-working plant as advertised. Alas she supplied
me the photo of the gate from the website of the metal working company - not a photo she took
herself. 
 
 


 
 
 
So my Shanghai lawyer went to Anhui (standing room only on the train!) and took the photos himself
today. He was - when seen taking photos - escorted quickly off site. However he found the mysterious
China Agritech office. 
 
Here is the building on site in which the China Agritech office resides. 
 
 


 
 
 
There are more modern factories on site - but this is the office building. 
 
China Agritech has its office on the second floor on the right hand side of this building. The office was

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Agritech: more photos - more detail

deserted - it was after all the New Year holiday. It is not large - but this office is the only evidence that
China Agritech had any facilities that we found. 
 


 
 
 
There was no fertilizer plant on this site - even though this was clearly the low-rise site where -
according to the SEC filing - China Agritech leased its Anhui Plant. 
 
Finally the road to the site was not a rutted road as described in the Lucas McGee report - indeed it
was a large site with more than one gate. Here is one gate - my contact was sent off site before he
photographed the gate as photographed in the last post. 
 
 


 
 
 
 
We have now clearly found China Agritech facilities - but they are NOT the plants as described in
China Agritech filings. They are however at the addresses given for those plants in the Agritech
filings.
