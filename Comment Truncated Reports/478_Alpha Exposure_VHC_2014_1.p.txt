VirnetX Is Worth Well Under $1 Per Share

Summary


VirnetX stock is nearly worthless.


VirnetX has little hope of generating free cash flow.


VirnetX faces high likelihood of losing new FaceTime infringement suit.


On July 9th 2014, under an article entitled "The VirnetX Tinderbox" we posted the
following comment:


While our timing prediction that a decision would come in the next four weeks was
incorrect, we correctly anticipated that VirnetX (AMEX: VHC) would lose on appeal at the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). At the time we posted this comment, we
did not elaborate on why we felt VirnetX would go to approximately $0, because borrow on
the stock was in short supply and we did not want our cost of borrow to rise nor did we
want our borrowed stock to get called away. Now that borrow availability has eased, we
will elaborate on why we think VHC is worth less than $1 a share.


On September 16th, the CAFC released its decision in "VirnetX, Inc. v. Cisco Systems,
Inc. et al." The judges ruled: "We affirm the jury's findings that none of the asserted claims
are invalid and that many of the asserted claims of the '135 and '151 patents are infringed
by Apple's VPN On Demand product. We also affirm the district court's exclusion of
evidence relating to the reexamination of the patents-in-suit. However, we reverse the
jury's finding that the VPN On Demand product infringes claim 1 of the '151 patent under
the doctrine of equivalents. We also reverse the district court's construction of the claim
term "secure communication link" in the '504 and '211 patents and remand for further
proceedings to determine whether the FaceTime feature infringes those patents under the
correct claim construction. Finally, we vacate the jury's damages award and remand for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion."

While this decision caused a 44% decline in the price of VirnetX's stock, we believe the
market is not fully grasping the impact of the decision which reads, "However, we reverse
the jury's finding that the VPN On Demand product infringes claim 1 of the '151 patent
under the doctrine of equivalents. We also reverse the district court's construction of the
claim term "secure communication link" in the '504 and '211 patents and remand for
further proceedings to determine whether the FaceTime feature infringes those patents
under the correct claim construction." Accordingly, any patent involving the term "secure
communications link" must go back to the district court for a new jury trial. This leaves
open the very real likelihood that a new jury determines that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did
not infringe VirnetX's patents. At the very least, it puts VirnetX in the precarious position of
needing to win in front of a jury again and, even if they win in front of a jury, see that the
next verdict is upheld on appeal in front of the CAFC all over again. Realistically, this
process is likely to take at least another two or three years.


Along with needing to re-try the most important part of their case against Apple, VirnetX
will also need to come up with an entirely new damages theory for the patents that Apple
was found to have infringed. The CAFC ruling tells VirnetX that it cannot use Nash
Bargaining and that it cannot just assign an arbitrary royalty rate to the list price of a
product such as an iPod, iPad, or iPhone. Instead, VirnetX must present the jury with a
credible damages theory based on the actual value of the invention. Investors should
therefore note that the court implicitly blessed using a $29 software upgrade for the Mac
that included FaceTime as one of many features as a potential royalty base. Therefore,
FaceTime (and VPN on Demand) "cost" some fraction of $29. Thus, a jury will need to
determine what percentage of the software upgrade is attributable to FaceTime and VPN
on Demand.


Below we will lay out two hypothetical scenarios to show how meager the royalty VirnetX
receives is likely to be. While being able to charge a royalty on the whole $29 may be
difficult to justify, the CAFC to some extent does seem to endorse the $29 figure (at least
as a starting point, i.e. a maximum for the royalty base), when it said, "Because Apple has
not challenged it, we offer no opinion on whether the $29 software upgrade is itself so
closely related to the patented feature that VirnetX may rely on its entire value in
determining the proper royalty base for the FaceTime feature." Apple does not tell us
exactly how many units were sold in the U.S., but they do say that 39% of their revenue
last year came from the U.S., so we approximated that 39% of units are also sold in the
U.S. With the exception of the $29 for the Mac software upgrade, all numbers are
hypothetical.

The table above shows that if VirnetX is able to collect a royalty for both FaceTime and
VPN at a 1% rate, it would achieve $38.5 million in annual revenue. Alternatively, if
VirnetX is unable to prove to a jury that FaceTime infringes its patents, its royalties fall to
just $8.7 million a year.


But VirnetX may find it hard to even achieve 1% since it has signed royalty deals at as low
a rate as 0.24%, as was pointed out in this decision, which stated "Finally, Apple notes
that the sixth license covered sixty-eight VirnetX patents, and was therefore much broader
than the license to four patents Apple would be seeking in the hypothetical negotiation. It
also equated to a 0.24% royalty rate, which is significantly lower than the 1-2% rate
Weinstein testified VirnetX would accept." Therefore, VirnetX receiving 1-2% is not
guaranteed. In a situation where VirnetX only collects a royalty rate of 0.24%, their
hypothetical revenue falls by approximately 75% relative to the scenario outlined above.

This would equate to about $10 million if they could collect for both FaceTime and VPN on
Demand. If they can only collect for VPN on demand, this revenue number would fall to
just $3 million.


Now that we have gone through what the CAFC ruled and what this means for VirnetX's
future royalties, we will discuss VirnetX's probable path forward. VirnetX's next step will
likely be to petition for a rehearing and/or a rehearing En Banc at the CAFC. If the En
Banc is denied, which is likely, they will then have 90 days to appeal to the Supreme
Court. If their motion to the Supreme Court is denied, they will then have to make a
strategic decision on whether or not to have a new trial covering infringement by
FaceTime. VirnetX may decide not to have another trial on FaceTime and instead only ask
for a new hearing regarding damages for the patents infringed by VPN on Demand if it is
concerned that it will lose the new infringement trial and such a loss would negatively color
the jury when it goes to debate damages for VPN On Demand. Once VirnetX has a new
trial covering FaceTime infringement, a new damages hearing on infringement by VPN on
Demand, or both, it will receive a jury decision, which the loser will inevitably appeal. Keep
in mind, there is a substantial risk that VirnetX will lose the new trial on FaceTime because
both the VirnetX and Apple experts agreed that FaceTime does not meet the anonymous
requirement that is now part of the definition of a Secure Communications Link. At the end
of the day, it will be years before VirnetX sees any money, if they even see any at all from
FaceTime. This of course leads us to an examination of VirnetX's balance sheet.


VirnetX ended the most recent quarter with $25.7 million in cash compared to the $38.9
million it started the year with. In other words, VirnetX burned $13.2 million in the first half
of 2014. If we carry forward the $13.2 million cash burn in the first half to the full year,
VirnetX will end the year with $12.5 million in cash. Since VirnetX is burning over $26
million a year, ending the year with only $12.5 million puts the company in the position of
needing to do an equity raise before the first half of 2015 ends. We believe VirnetX will do
an equity raise soon so that it can avoid putting in a going concern warning in their SEC
filings, which would be required in the 2014 10-K if the company has less than 1-year of
operating cash on its balance sheet at the time of the 10-K filing.


Before we take the final step of valuing VirnetX, we would be remiss not to bring up two
more points. First, this decision also has ramifications for the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
case because we now know that VirnetX cannot rely on the same damages theory and
VirnetX will need to construe Secure Communications Link as including both security and
anonymity. We believe that this definition makes infringement unlikely and, in any case,
