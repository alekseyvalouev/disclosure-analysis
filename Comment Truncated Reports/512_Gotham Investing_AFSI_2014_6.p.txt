AmTrust: Just-Released Statutory Filings Reveal Substantial
Deterioration

Summary


3q14 Statutory Filings Show Substantial Adverse Case Reserve Development (Less
Discretion).


Instead of Taking Charge, AFSI Reduced IBNR Reserves (More Discretion).


IBNR Should INCREASE, Not Decrease When Case Reserves Develop Adversely
(Incurred Method).


Significant Implications for Earnings, Book Value, & Statutory Capital.


Case Reserves vs. IBNR Reserves:


AmTrust Financial Services Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI), like all P&C insurers, must set up
reserves for the ultimate amount they expect to pay policyholders for claims filed (loss and
loss adjustment expense reserves). The two components of Loss and LAE reserves are
case reserves and IBNR reserves.


Below is the definition of case reserves, which demonstrates that an insurer can adjust its
estimate of severity, but not frequency, since the claim has already been filed.


A case reserve is an estimate of the amount for which a particular claim will
ultimately be settled or adjudicated. Insurers will also set reserves for their entire
books of business to estimate their future liabilities.


In contrast, IBNR is much less certain in that the both the frequency and severity of claims
must be estimated. Not only that, the severity of these projected events must be estimated
without any information about the specific "incurred but not reported" claims. This provides
insurers MUCH more latitude in reserving for IBNR.


An estimate of the liability for claim-generating events that have taken place but
have not yet been reported to the insurer or self-insurer. The sum of IBNR losses
plus incurred losses provides an estimate of the total eventual liabilities for losses
during a given period.

YTD 2014 Reserve Development:


Technology Insurance Company ("TIC") is AFSI's largest US subsidiary, and it participates
in 20% of AFSI's US underwriting operations (net of excess of loss insurance) through
intra-company reinsurance agreements. Another 10% of the underwriting is retained by
the US subsidiary that issued the policy (except TIC cedes 10% of policies to Rochdale
Insurance Company), and 70% is ceded to AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ("AII"),
AFSI's reinsurance captive in Bermuda. Maiden Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ: MHLD)
participates in 40% of the 70% assumed by AII, leaving AII with 30%. As a result of this
structure, TIC serves as a good proxy for how AFSI's US operations are doing.


The excerpt below is from TIC's 3q14 statutory filing, and it reveals that TIC's estimate of
case reserves were far too low at 12/31/13 which indicates AFSI is under-estimating the
severity of claims filed. However, TIC reported favorable development because they drew
down IBNR reserves by even more than case reserves had to be increased.


Incurred Method:


AFSI discloses in their 10-K that they use the "Incurred Method":


We began writing workers' compensation in 2001. In order to establish IBNR reserves, we
project ultimate losses by accident year both through use of our historical experience, and
the use of industry experience by state. Our consulting actuary projects ultimate losses in
two different ways (emphasis added):

Quarterly Incurred Development Method (Use of AmTrust Factors). Quarterly
incurred loss development factors are derived from our historical, cumulative
incurred losses by accident month. These factors are then applied to the latest
actual incurred losses and DCC by month to estimate ultimate losses and DCC,
based on the assumption that each accident month will develop to estimated
ultimate cost in a similar manner to prior years. There is a substantial amount of
judgment involved in this method.


Yearly Incurred Development (Use of National Council on Compensation Insurance,
Inc. ("NCCI") Industry Factors by State). Yearly incurred loss development factors
are derived from either NCCI's annual statistical bulletin or state bureaus. These
factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and DCC by year by
state to estimate ultimate losses and DCC, based on the assumption that each year
will develop to an estimated ultimate cost similar to the industry development by year
by state.


Each method produces estimated ultimate loss and DCC expenses net of amounts
that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers. Our consulting actuary
estimates a range of ultimate losses, along with a selection that gives more weight to
the results from our monthly development factors and less weight to the results from
industry development factors.


We establish IBNR reserves for our workers' compensation segment by determining
an "ultimate loss pick," which is our estimate of our net loss ratio for a specific
period, based on actual incurred losses and application of loss development factors.
We estimate our ultimate incurred loss and DCC for a period by multiplying the
ultimate loss pick for the period by the earned premium for the period. From that
total, we subtract actual paid loss and DCC and actual case reserves for reported
losses. The remainder constitutes our IBNR reserves. On a monthly basis, our
consulting actuary reviews our IBNR reserves. On a monthly basis, we review our
determination of our ultimate loss pick.


In other words, the ultimate loss pick for a given accident year is a multiple of the actual
case reserves incurred. Therefore, adverse development in case reserves should cause
IBNR to increase as of a given date. Instead, AFSI is doing the opposite.


Therefore, the component of reserves where AFSI has less accounting discretion
(case reserves) was severely deficient. To cover this up, AFSI reduced reserves
where they have more accounting discretion (IBNR reserves) IN SPITE OF their

stated actuarial methodologies.


Comparison to Tower Group International, Ltd. ("TWGP") 3q13:


Comparing TIC's YTD development with that of Tower Insurance Company of New York
("TICNY") in 3q13 is instructive. When TWGP took a $365m reserve charge, TICNY's
case and IBNR developed worse by $16.6 million (14.9%) and $40.7 million (47.8%),
respectively (i.e.: increased severity of case prompted increases in to the IBNR).


IBNR reserves that was 2.5x more than their case reserve charge (as one would expect).


Had AFSI merely not bled down IBNR reserves, earnings would have been significantly
lower for AFSI.


Had AFSI used the same methodology as TWGP for estimating the reserve charge
needed, TIC's capital likely would have been wiped out and AFSI would be in breach
credit agreements and regulatory capital requirements.


I believe this example demonstrates the extreme nature of AFSI's accounting shenanigans
with respect to its US operations YTD in 2014.


NYDFS Conditions & Implications


As I discussed in "AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I",
the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") imposed conditions upon
AmTrust in conjunction with ACP Re's acquisition of TWGP. Among them were
requirements to increase actuarial resources and provide the NYDFS with "any and all"
financial information it requests:
