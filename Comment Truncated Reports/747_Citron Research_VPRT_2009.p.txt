CITRON RESEARCH
REPORTS ON VISTAPRINT
(VPRT)


What are you going to do if 44% of your net
income disappears?


For the past few years, Vistaprint has been a
controversial name amongst investors.  On one
hand you have a printing servicing company that
provides printed products to small business at an
a�ordable price.   But on the other hand, you have
a company with a dirty secret which derives a large
portion of its income from “referral fees” – from
companies that o�er web loyalty shopping clubs, or
in layman terms, those $14.95 a month charges on
your credit card bill that leave you scratching your
head.


The word “referral” sounds innocent enough, but in
real terms, as a consumer, when you complete an
online purchase, you are shown a button saying
something like “Save $10 on your Next Purchase
from this Company”.  Beware!  If you click, even
accidentally, your full contact info, but worse, your
credit card information, is sent on without your
permission to a 3rd party company you haven’t
given your permission to.  From that point, the
debate rages about how many of these charges
represent trickery, and how many more are simply
fabricated without the consumer’s consent or
knowledge.


“You don’t have to be a Rockefeller to help a
fella’…”… but it helps!

For years short sellers have criticized this business
model, but love it or hate it the money kept coming
in….well all that is about to change.  This past
quarter Senator John D Rockefeller IV has decided
to make these web loyalty programs the target of a
Senate Commerce Committee formal inquiry.

Here is some more reading on Rockefeller and his
mission.

Should have seen this coming


The company has been giving tells that the
relationship with their referral provider Vertrue was
having troubles.  As stated in their last 10-K: 


“We expect that revenues we derive from
third party referral programs, particularly
membership discount programs, will
decrease in the future, which could
adversely a�ect our results of operations.” 
They go on to state:  “…we expect that
referral fee revenue from membership
discount programs will decline in absolute
dollar terms over that period of time,
including possibly to as low as zero…”


It is the opinion of Citron that neither Vistaprint nor
their web loyalty partner saw this Congressional
probe coming.  They were probably referring to the
seven class action lawsuits that were �led against
Vistaprint and Vertrue.

None of this is surprising considering the massive
volume of complaints that exist online about
Vistaprint for unauthorized credit card charges:

So what happens if the referral business goes
away?


Well here is where the devil lies in the details.  To
be current, we will examine the last 2 quarters.


                                                          
           


Mar
2009


Dec
2008


Revenue                                   127,523 138,903


Pretax earnings 15,506 20,438


Pretax earnings minus Referral
Revenue


8,748 14,048


Referral revenue 6,758 6,390


Referral as % revenue 5.3% 4.6%


Referral as % Pretax income 43.6% 31.3%


Vistaprint’s cheerleaders will have you believe
referral is not a problem because even if it goes
away, it only represents a bit more than 5% of
revenue last quarter. What they don’t tell you is that
with the margin it carries, this type of business,
which according to the company’s own disclosures
is generated with zero operational costs, represents
close to 44% of Vistaprint’s net income.  If you
compare the past two quarters you will see that the
company is becoming increasingly dependent on
that income.  Vistaprint’s already aggressive 36.5
PE balloons to an unsupportable 64.75 for its non-
referral business.

How will Vistaprint ever be able to grow their
business and �ll a void left by this free boost to
earnings which they been enjoying for years?  We
guess the old adage holds true, “if it seems too
good to be true it probably is” When you generate
such a signi�cant part of your income from a non-
core business that has generated so much scrutiny,
it will eventually come to an end.


Taxes


Additionally, Vistaprint has yet to project the e�ects
on its earnings of tightening tax rules on its foreign
domestication (currently Bermuda).  Its current tax
rate is 8.6%, compared to typical 35% – 40% for
typical US companies. 


The current administration has made it clear that
these types of tax dodges are clearly in its sights.
  Even though the company has changed their
domicile to the Netherlands, this should still be of
concern to shareholders.


Conclusion


Many times, critics of a company are way too early
in predicting when a business model will start to
unravel.  Commonly enough, as in Vistaprint’s case,
a steady stream of insider selling provides a reliable
hint to cautious investors. 


With the current class action lawsuits combined
with the Senate �nally paying attention to these
unscrupulous business practices, Vistaprint had
better quickly de�ne a “plan B” to replace 45% of its
net in income in its future.


Cautious investing to all.
