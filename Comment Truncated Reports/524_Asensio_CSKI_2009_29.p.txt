The China Sky Show Continues in Its Third
Quarter 2009 Earnings Release.


Posted on November 24, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) released its third-


quarter earnings on November 17, 2009. The financial irregularities


that asensio.com began reporting on in April 2009 continued to be


evident in CSKI’s third-quarter financial statements.


China Sky continues to report a questionably low inventory level.


asensio.com compared CSKI to three U.S.-listed competitors (AOB,


TCM, and TPI) in terms of days of inventory on hand. The three


comparables have at least double CSKI’s inventory level relative to


sales.


China Sky’s gross profit margin also continues to be questionably


high in contrast to its competitors. CSKI reported third-quarter


gross margin of 75%, while the three comps averaged 55% – a full


20% lower than CSKI.


As discussed in a previous asensio.com report, CSKI’s reported gross


margin has remained relatively constant, despite dramatic changes


in reported product mix. The third-quarter continues the same


trend. While gross margin was 75%, within one percent of gross


margin for the prior quarter and the prior-year period, CSKI’s 10-Q


states, “Due to the Company’s acquisitions of Tianlong and Peng Lai,


there have been material changes to its product portfolio in the


three months ended September 30, 2009.”


CSKI has not shown any significant intellectual property for its


products that would suggest any barriers to entry to make such


high margins possible. Indeed, CSKI’s CFO, Stanley Hao, recently did


an interview with the Wall Street Transcript, in which he identifies


at least two other companies as competitors for one of CSKI’s new


best-selling products, “Compound Camphor Cream” for the

he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

treatment of dermatitis. Hao states that the competition is “running


red hot.”


Hao also makes questionable statements in the interview


concerning distribution of CSKI’s slim patch product in the U.S. Hao


states, “…during a roadshow in Los Angeles in the middle of
September, we signed another distribution agreement with a


distributor in Los Angeles for our Slim Patch product.” The ability


of CSKI to distribute its slim patch in the U.S. lawfully seems


doubtful. As noted in a previous asensio.com report, the U.S.


Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as recently as 2007 obtained a


court order banning a company from selling patches for weight-


loss. The FTC stated, “Products worn or rubbed on the skin do not


cause weight loss.”


Most importantly, CSKI has apparently not addressed two issues


that should be principal concerns for all CSKI shareholders:


financial statements filed with the China State Administration for


Industry and Commerce vastly different from CSKI’s SEC filings, and


the suspension of the subsidiary supposedly holding all of CSKI’s


operating assets.


Today asensio.com released a separate report on CSKI’s SAIC filings;


click here to view the report.


CSKI still has not corrected the suspension of its main subsidiary,


American California Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. (ACPG). ACPG was


organized in California, and according to CSKI, ACPG owns 100% of


TDR, CSKI’s Chinese operating subsidiary. However, ACPG’s status


with the California Secretary of State is shown as “suspended.”


According to website for the California Secretary of State,


suspension means that “the business entity’s powers, rights and


privileges were suspended or forfeited in California 1) by the


Franchise Tax Board for failure to file a return and/or failure to pay


taxes, penalties, or interest; and/or 2) by the Secretary of State for


failure to file the required Statement of Information and, if


applicable, the required Statement by Common Interest


Development Association.”


It appears problematic for CSKI shareholders to have any claim on


assets held through a business whose status is “suspended,” and at


the very least suggests continuing negligence on the part of CSKI


management.
