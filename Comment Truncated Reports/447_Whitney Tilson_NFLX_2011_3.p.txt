When the facts change, I change my mind - what do you do, sir?


-- John Maynard Keynes


In mid-December, we published a lengthy article on why Netflix was our largest bearish
bet at the time. With the stock up nearly 25% since then, one might assume that we’d
think it’s an even better short today, but in fact we have closed out our position because
we are no longer confident that our investment thesis is correct. There are three primary
reasons for this:


1) The company reported a very strong quarter that weakened key pillars of our
investment thesis, especially as it relates to margins; 


2) We conducted a survey, completed by more than 500 Netflix subscribers, that showed
significantly higher satisfaction with and usage of Netflix’s streaming service than we
anticipated (the results of our survey are posted here); and  


3) Our article generated a great deal of feedback, including an open letter from Netflix’s
CEO, Reed Hastings, some of which caused us to question a number of our assumptions.


In summary, while we acknowledged in our December article that Netflix “offers a useful,
attractively-priced service to customers, is growing like wildfire, is very well managed, and
has a strong balance sheet,” we now believe that it is an even better business than we
gave it credit for. The company has enormous momentum and substantial optionality (for
example, international growth), and management is executing superbly. In particular, we
tip our hat to Reed Hastings, whom we had the pleasure of meeting last weekend. In
addition to his success building the business and navigating the transition from DVD-by-
mail to streaming media, he’s also one of the most down-to-earth, honest and
straightforward CEOs we’ve ever encountered. 


To be clear, in covering our short and writing favorable things about Netflix in this article,
we are not recommending purchase of the stock. Many things will have to go very right for

the company to justify its current market valuation, but we no longer think it’s wise to bet
against Netflix. 


This is particularly true in light of our belief that this market is filled with much better short
opportunities that are in our sweet spot: outright frauds (our very favorite), industries in
decline or facing major headwinds, weak or faddish business models, bad balance sheets,
and incompetent, excessively promotional and/or crooked management. It’s so much
more rewarding, both psychically and financially, to short these types of businesses. 


Our Short Thesis 
Our short thesis was predicated on the following stream of logic:


1) Netflix’s future depends on its streaming video business (rather than its traditional DVD-
by-mail business); 


2) The company’s streaming library is weak, which would lead to customer dissatisfaction
and declining usage; 


3) This would either cause subscriber growth to wither or force Netflix to pay large
amounts to license more content, which would compress margins and profits; 


4) Either of these two outcomes would crush the share price. 


We are no longer convinced that #2 and #3 are true.


Customer Satisfaction With Netflix’s Streaming Service 
To measure the quality of Netflix’s streaming movie library, we looked at the top 50
grossing movies of all time, Internet Movie Database’s 20 top-ranked movies of all time,
Rotten Tomatoes’ 20 top-ranked movies of all time, and the 10 top-selling, top-renting and
top-video-on-demand DVDs for the week ending 11/28/10. In our December article, we
shared our findings: “of these 120 movies (including duplicates), Netflix has a mere 17
(14.2%, and 0% of the current most popular movies) vs. 77 for iTunes (64.2%), 63 for
Vudu, 62 for Amazon, and 41 for cable.” A similar analysis for TV Guide’s list of the 100
most popular TV shows showed that Netflix streamed fewer than 25% of them. 


Thus, we concluded that Netflix’s streaming library is weak and customers would be

dissatisfied and reduce their usage of the streaming service – but our survey of more than
500 current Netflix customers revealed increasing usage over time and reasonably high
satisfaction:


In response to question #8, Compared to the first month that you started using Netflix’s
streaming service, has your usage changed?, 36% of respondents said they were
streaming more than twice as much, 25% said somewhat more, 23% said it’s about
the same, 12% said somewhat less and only 4% said less than half as much. In other
words, 61% said they were using the service more and only 16% said less. (For
details, see appendix A; all of these percentages exclude respondents who said “I’m
new to the service or don’t stream.”)


In response to question #9, Overall, how satisfied are you with Netflix’s streaming
service?, 40% said highly satisfied, 40% said moderately satisfied, and only 11% were
dissatisfied. While these are lower satisfaction levels than Netflix’s DVD rental service
(our survey showed 65% highly satisfied and 24% moderately satisfied), Netflix’s
customers are much more satisfied with the streaming service and are using it much
more than we expected.


The most commonly cited explanation by the Netflix customers in our survey for their
increasing usage and overall satisfaction is that they appreciate the easy-to-use, widely
available service and perceive good value. For a low monthly price – typically $7.99 or
$9.99, less than the cost of a single movie ticket and a tiny fraction of their cable bill – they
can have unlimited access to nearly 20,000 movies and TV shows. While many
respondents complained about the weak streaming content, most seemed to understand
that at such a low price point, they’re not going to get the latest, hottest movies like Avatar. 


Here are some representative comments from our survey:


Needs more & better content, but everyone knows that!


I believe we get what we pay for.


Not enough selection and not enough updates. Still great convenience & video quality.


I can watch what I want, when I want, for a price I can afford.


Great value, simple, problem free, no advertising.


Easy to use, good selection, and getting better all the time. It’s the best deal out there,
even with the recent price increase.

Streaming itself is great. The library of streamable choices is lacking, especially for
movies. Once you get hooked on a TV show Netflix carries, though, the streaming is
awesome!


I’m not married to Netflix. I would easily switch to a carrier with the fastest and widest
selection of titles. The flip side is I haven’t tried other services because Netflix is easy.
I’m not a tech expert and don’t even know what Hulu does.


Good product at good price. Online quality is much better than I expected. Lots of kids
content to stream (don’t need the latest). Netflix finds TV shows that I may like but did
not know existed and/or would not rent as DVDs. Have gotten rid of the expensive
cable bill as a result.


Margin Compression 
In our December article, we pointed out that Netflix was paying increasing amounts for
streaming content, which pressured margins in Q3 10 – and we predicted that this trend
would continue. We wrote:


Our belief that the increased costs of streaming content will negatively impact
Netflix’s margins isn’t just a theory. Last quarter, strong evidence emerged to support
our view: in Q3, Netflix’s operating margin was 12.6% and net margin was 6.9%,
down from 14.9% and 8.4%, respectively, in Q2. That’s a huge decline in only three
months. 
 
The result was a 12.5% sequential decline in earnings from $0.80 in Q2 to $0.70 in
Q3.


When Netflix reported Q4 earnings on January 26th, we were exactly right about the
impact of higher streaming costs on gross margin, which fell to 34.4%, down from 38.0%
year over year, and 37.7% sequentially. Yet the margins that count, operating and net,
rose to 13.1% and 7.9%, respectively, up from 12.6% and 6.9% in Q3 10. How did this
happen? To our surprise, marketing expense fell to 10.5% of revenues, down dramatically
from 15.9% year over year and 14.7% sequentially. 


Of course, any company can goose its margins and profits in the short term by slashing
marketing spending, but this usually triggers a fall-off in sales and customers. Yet this
didn’t happen to Netflix: in Q4, the number of paid subscribers jumped by 2.4 million to
18.3 million, up 53.5% year over year and 15.2% sequentially, both the highest levels
going back more than four years. Subscriber growth isn’t merely high, but it’s accelerating.

Such a large gain in subscribers fueled at 34.1% year over year jump in revenues, the
highest percentage gain since Q1 07. 


This surge in subscribers and revenues is creating a virtuous cycle for Netflix, both in
terms of word-of-mouth buzz (which is, of course, the best – and cheapest – form of
marketing) and financially. Allow us to explain the latter. In our December article, we wrote
the following:


Netflix’s Dilemma 
Why is Netflix’s streaming content so weak? The primary reason is that, unlike its
competitors, Netflix isn’t willing to pay what content providers demand for the best
movies and TV shows. For example, Netflix’s competitors typically charge $4.99 to
stream a popular movie, of which $3 goes to the content provider, and the
economics are similar for the $1 TV shows. 
 
But this model doesn’t work for Netflix because it’s only charging $7.99 per month for
unlimited streaming. Given that content providers aren’t about to slash their prices,
Netflix has three choices, all of them unpleasant:


1) It can have a weak library and maintain low prices, or 
 
2) It can license better content and pass the cost along to its customers, which
would crimp growth, or 
 
3) It can license better content and eat the cost, which would hurt margins.


Netflix’s Q4 earnings report underscored for us that there is a fourth possibility – one
which is very pleasant for the company: high subscriber growth leads to higher revenues
and profits, which allows Netflix to license more/better streaming content (without
sacrificing margins), which leads to even more subscribers. 


To see how this might work, let’s consider the scenario in which Netflix continues to grow
its net paid subscribers by 2.4 million for each of the next four quarters (9.6 million
incremental). Last quarter, the average paying customer generated $11.64/month in
revenue (based on $596 million in revenue divided by 17.1 million average paid
subscribers). Let’s assume that the new customers are mostly signing up for streaming (at
$7.99/month), so that the average revenue is $10/month: that’s an incremental $1.15
billion in annual revenues for Netflix.
