Stellar Biotechnologies: We've Seen The Pump, Now Here Comes The
Dump
Sep. 23, 2014 10:15 AM ET31 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


We believe Stellar Biotechnologies' share price to be a product of a well-timed
promotional campaign.


SBOTF's share count has risen 88.2% in three short years, and the September 2013
PIPE was done at a fully diluted share price of $0.3415/share. (sourced below).


The company appears to be operating far below its capacity, and has reported net
losses of ($14.8M), ($5.1M), and ($3.5M) for the past three years. (source 3).


Promotions have touted the company's former agreement with Sigma Aldrich, but
we've found that this agreement had expired in 2013.


SBOTF's biggest competitor, BioSyn, established in 1984, claims to be able to
produce far more than 1,500 grams/year. (SBOTF's current capacity).


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Stellar Biotechnologies (SBOTF) has been an intriguing story these last two months.


We've found three things about Stellar Biotechnologies to be concerned with right off the
bat. These items, combined with the results of further due diligence, lead us to believe that
Stellar will make its way back to $0.70 and resume its descent downward from there.


First, we've found a promotional campaign that we believe to be the cause of the
company's stock price moving up in rapid fashion without material news or fundamentals
to back it up. We've found third-parties that have issued questionable campaigns that are
touting SBOTF, and these promotions have made some robust claims that we believe they
can't back up - including, at one point, commenting that SBOTF would list on the
Nasdaq "as soon as August 31, 2014."


Second, we will shine light on exaggerations made by these promotions about future
operational expansion, which we view as unnecessary and a non-issue due to Stellar's
already anemic history of production (sourced below). In addition, the company itself

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 2/48


admits that it does not know if it is economically feasible to expand at this stage in its
growth. We question why the company would think about expanding when we believe it to
be operating far under capacity and production appears to be falling. Our conversations
with BioSyn, a 30+ year veteran in the Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ("KLH") niche, confirm
to us that Stellar's capabilities are nowhere near as robust as this competitor. Stellar's own
20-F from 2013 states that it produced under 50g of KLH for 2013, representing less than
4% of the company's 1,500g capacity. Stellar's V.P. of Corporate Development &
Communications, Mark McPartland confirmed that the company was operating at far less
than capacity, and had never operated over 10% capacity.


Finally, we question the validity of promotions tied to the company's former agreement
with Sigma Aldrich. When SBOTF's CEO was questioned about production during the
2014 Rodman & Renshaw conference, he commented on the record that Stellar currently
supplies KLH to Sigma Aldrich (NASDAQ:SIAL) via a publicly disclosed agreement
between the two companies. His comments implied that this supply agreement was active
and ongoing, yet we can't find any mention of it in either company's recent filings. SBOTF
VP, Mark McPartland told us that the company doesn't comment on who it sells to, and
that the agreement was a "rolling agreement".


Furthermore, posing as a buyer, GeoInvesting tried to purchase KLH from Sigma Aldrich,
who told us it was manufactured in-house by its operation in Israel.


To further back this up, we found that according to Stellar's Form 20-F filed on
December 31, 2013, its contract with Sigma Aldrich had expired in June 2013
without being extended.


It calls itself the "world leader in sustainable manufacture of KLH (source 28)," but from
what we've found, this is probably not the case. BioSyn, a U.S./German company, is
acknowledged as Stellar's main competition. We called BioSyn to discuss Stellar's
production capabilities of 1,500 grams/year, and BioSyn's president, Shammana
Muddukrishna said, "We already produce much more than that."


In addition, the company states in its own filings that it doesn't know "if it is economical to
manufacture KLH and related products on a large scale" (source 3).


After a steady walk down from the $1.60 levels in March of this year, SBOTF found itself
trading around $0.70 to end the month of July - less than a month and a half ago.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 3/48


Beginning on August 11th, and seemingly without rhyme or reason, the stock began a
rocket-like ascent from those $0.70 levels to near $2.30/share on no news and record
volume - all in less than one month's time.


What major material news could have occurred in such a short time that would cause this
struggling, money-losing company to mysteriously triple its value? According to a
company-issued press release, nothing (source 8). According to what we believe, this
is the product of a comprehensive and well-timed promotional campaign about a
company that is in no way as exclusive as the promotions it is making it out to be.


In this piece, we're going to show:


The promotion that we believe caused a rapid ascent in SBOTF's share price to
current levels.
That a partnership agreement used to tout the company by promoters has been
expired and has not been extended since June 2013.
Why we think SBOTF's stock crashed just days after spiking - and why we expect
another decline.

That SBOTF's own paid research firm only has a $1.14 price target on the stock
(sourced below) - representing about a 33% downside to current trading levels around
$1.70.
The company appears to be operating far below its capacity,  
 
and has reported net losses of ($14.8M), ($5.1M), and ($3.5M) for the past three years
(source 3).


The company does not have a monopoly on KLH as newsletters claim, nor do we
believe it to be the leader in its industry; in fact, its biggest competitor, BioSyn, claims
to be able to produce far more than 1,500 grams/year (SBOTF's current capacity), and
also claims to have supplied the KLH to "almost 90% of the clinical trials that have
taken place to date and the ones that are continuing now."
SBOTF and some "lucky" investors valued shares at around $0.34/share during the
company's September 2013 private placement. (sourced below)
Why we think there's significant more downside to SBOTF at current levels, and well
below the $1.14 price target set by the company's paid analyst report.


The Promotions Begin


Stellar Biotechnologies drew our attention due to its bizarre trading.


When we began to dig and look for information as to what could have caused the stock to
move the way that it did on such short notice, we turned up some interesting information.


First, we obtained the following e-mail, which appears to have been issued on August 18,
2014. (source 1)

The enclosed link to "our most exciting initiative ever" has been taken down recently, and
we are instead given the following message when we try to follow the link:

Using Google Cache, we were able to locate a copy of the report, which appears to first
have been issued in July 2014 (source 2).

The name "Stellar" or ticker symbol "SBOTF" do not appear in the report itself, but the
similarities between this report and SBOTF are uncanny. The newsletter also fails to
mention any other public companies, prompting potential investors to reach out to Michael
A. Robinson, the name signed on the report, for "the goods."


The newsletter is clearly a lead in to a promotion of Stellar, as you can see from a few
examples showcasing the similarities between the data points in the newsletter compared
to SBOTF's SEC filings (source 3).


Things like the "Scientific Board" that is touted in the newsletter fit Stellar to a tee. Here is
an excerpt from the newsletter:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_4.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 8/48


The above statement from the newsletter runs commensurate with the "Scientific Board"
in SBOTF's 20-F filings:


A post at Stock Gumshoe (source 4) also believes that the newsletter was, in fact, touting
Stellar:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 9/48


If you want to read into this particular newsletter a bit more, you can log onto the Stock
Gumshoe site and read the comments to this piece. A lot of them seem to be of the
consensus that this was a well-timed and well-placed promotion.


This was taking place from the July date on the newsletter through August 11th, 2014,
when the stock began its run. Sources that we have spoken to have told us that they
received a copy of this newsletter for the first time on August 18th, 2014, well after the
stock had begun its ascent upward.


Here are some other similarities:

We even found promos using the exact same text as the newsletter on Facebook (source
5):

Also, we found a couple of interesting statements that were made in an e-mail blast that
we believed to have gone out around August 19th, 2014 (source 6). This e-mail from
Money Morning also has Michael Robinson's name in it:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_10.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 12/48


After speaking with the company, we take Stellar at its word when it says that these
promotions did not operate in conjunction with the company, nor do we believe that Money
Morning actually got this uplist date directly from Stellar's management. However, when
we spoke with Stellar's VP, Mark McPartland, he told us he was aware of these
promotions.


Regardless of whether or not the company had anything to do with it, the statement about
uplisting is irresponsible. We find such a forward-looking claim to be a red flag, regardless
of whether or not it was the CEO or simply the newsletter that put it out in the first place.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 13/48


Stellar's corporate video (source 25) seems to be the source for many of the images that
were included in the newsletter. Here are two example images used in the newsletter and
in Stellar's corporate video:


On August 25th, word went out that the newsletter that was touting SBOTF was going to
have to "shut down the most extraordinary venture [they've] ever developed (source 7)."



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_12.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 14/48


In either event, in terms of the uplist, it is worth noting that we are well beyond August
31st, and SBOTF continues to trade on the OTCQB.


"Coincidentally," during the first hours of trading on August 28th, the company lost over
29% of its value. From August 27th to September 2nd, the price dropped from over
$2.20/share to as low as $1.40/share, an astounding 36% drop in just three short trading
days. Those that were buying on the hopes and dreams issued by this newsletter had
taken significant losses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 15/48


On August 29th, the company issued a press release (source 8) that stated it was "not
aware of any material change in the Company's operations that would merit such trading
activity." We find it interesting that SBOTF (or its securities lawyers) felt prompted to put
this press release out after the drop in the stock price, but not while the stock was
rocketing upwards without "material changes" occurring. After Stellar made us aware
that it knew of these promotions, we were taken back by how the company has
seemingly failed to control this dissemination of false and misleading information.


With the company admitting no material changes had taken place, we strongly believe the
drastic swing in the stock's price was nothing more than a result of this newsletter going
out.


Again, it comes as no surprise to us that this company is still listed on the OTCQB in the
U.S. and the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada at the time of this article being prepared
on September 16, 2014 (source 29).


Supplemental Findings


We've also noted that Stellar's stock seems to be associated with MissionIR and
DreamTeam - two names that give us pause due to their questionable track records.
While we don't believe the company has directly hired these promoters, we find it
noteworthy that these names are involved in touting how great of an investment SBOTF
is.


For a little background, we know that MissionIR is a brand that's affiliated with
DreamTeamGroup (source 9).



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_14.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 16/48


To familiarize yourself a bit more with DreamTeam, you can read Richard Pearson's write-
up entitled "Behind the Scenes with DreamTeam, CytRx, and Galena" on Seeking Alpha
(source 10). Put simply, in this piece he claims that DreamTeam disguised themselves
under different pseudonyms to promote CytRx. As a result, the article notes that over 100
DreamTeam articles had been removed from various sites across the web.


A follow-up article was published by ValueWalk (source 11).


Again, we are not implying that SBOTF hired DreamTeam or any of its affiliates, but simply
pointing out that we think it's a red flag that an affiliate of DreamTeam is promoting SBOTF
online.


We also believe these promotional touts for SBOTF contain false and misleading
information.


MissionIR seems to have been posting about SBOTF for some time now (on various
websites). Here are a couple of the posts that we've found:


1. On February 14, 2014, there was an instablog written on Seeking Alpha by MissionIR
(source 13). The article had this vague disclaimer at the bottom of it.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/360252_14114382409316_16.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 17/48


2. On August 14, 2014, there was a post made by MissionIR about SBOTF on Investors
Hub (source 14). The post has the "Compensated Awareness Post" banner at the top of it,
leading one to that assume that MissionIR may have been compensated by the company.


The MissionIR post claims that:


"Stellar has also entered into an agreement with the SAFC division of Sigma Aldrich,
a highly respected international vendor of specialty chemicals and biologics for
commercial life science applications. Under the terms of the contract, SAFC will
"sell, distribute and market" Stellar's high molecular weight keyhole limpet
hemocyanin (HMW KLH) for application in therapeutic vaccines."


We find it interesting that in 2013, it appears that SAFC allowed the "Marketing and Sales
Agreement" with SBOTF to expire. This is what the company's Form 20-F reads from
more than a year ago (source 3).


If this is true, MissionIR is promoting the company with a deal that isn't even in place any
longer. Here are two more examples that we believe to be extremely misleading.

MissionIR seems to have published this article in as many venues as they could. Aside
from Investors Hub and Seeking Alpha, you can find it on MissionIR's website (source 15),
Small Cap Network (source 16), DreamTeam Network (source 17), and Twitter (source
18).


The Latest Promotion


It was surprising to us when we saw SBOTF up 5% at the open September 5th.


Once we checked, we saw the following headline (source 19):


Despite the fact that it's unusual for a company to issue a press release announcing an
analyst report, we found that this BrokerBank Securities, Inc. link to this particular report
led us to a website called smallcapstreet.com. You can view this by following the link that's

leads us to numerous results - most of which seem to be the same style of analyst reports.

From the same search, we found disclosures like this one, which tie the two names
together:


"Apr 9, 2014 - No liability is accepted by Small Cap Street, LLC and BrokerBank

We also recall that "Small Cap Street" seems to have had a history of promotions, as
they're noted in a critical article about Provectus (source 20):

a week ago, PVCT traded around $3.75, the stock now trades around $2: a crushing
-46% plunge in the stock" -- May 2014. (Now it trades at $1.05)


In addition, Bleecker Street Research also released an article (source 21) about VGGL,
where they are critical about Small Cap Street's involvement in potentially promoting it.
The stock has gone from $5.73 near June 3rd (when this piece was put out) to $3.44,
what it is trading at today. This represents downside of nearly 40%.

In 2014, Promoters Are Touting an Agreement that Expired in 2013


We should note that with regards to Stellar's 2011 "Marketing and Sales Agreement" with
SAFC, a Sigma-Aldrich subsidiary. This announcement of a "strategic agreement" was
announced in a press release on 8/03/11. When it was released, Stellar's CEO, Frank
Oakes stated:


"The agreement solidifies our position as the only source for a scalable supply of
cGMP-grade HMW-KLH for the vaccine business. We have put Stellar's aquaculture
KLH supply front and center in combination with what we believe is the most
important manufacturer and marketer of cGMP biologics in the world, Sigma-
Aldrich's SAFC business unit. This exciting development will allow us to move
aggressively forward on our diagnostic programs, knowing that the state-of-the-art
quality assurance and production capabilities of SAFC will be providing the
backbone for companies seeking the highest quality HMW-KLH available for vaccine
developers anywhere in the world. We look forward to continuing growth in this
relationship and will begin manufacture of SAFC's initial order as soon as possible."


After an initial purchase order, for which a press release was issued in September of 2011
(source 22), there doesn't seem to be any tangible traction resulting from the 2011
partnership. The last note that we see about this relationship appears in Stellar's Form 20-
F for 2013. The Form 20-F notes that the "agreement was active until June 2013 when it
expired without extension."


Sigma Aldrich or SAFC does not appear on Stellar's website under partners, nor does it
appear in any subsequent filing after this information was disclosed in the 2013 Form 20-
F. There is also no mention of this partnership in the company's most recent corporate
presentation, published in June of 2014 (source 23).


A search on Stellar's website for "SAFC" yields only the original release and the initial
purchase order:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 23/48


When we asked Stellar about whether or not this deal was active, VP Mark McPartland
told us it was a "rolling agreement", but would not tell us if the company had made any
sales to Sigma Aldrich this year.


When we asked Sigma Aldrich's IR if there was any continued business going on between
the two, he stated:


"To be honest, I'm not aware of anything and we don't tend to comment on
agreements other than what we put out in our SEC filings; so I can't really give you
much comment beyond that. I don't believe we've said anything in our filings."


Just to double-check, we went back through Sigma-Aldrich's filings through when the deal
expired, and we don't see Stellar, or KLH for that matter, in any of them.


To triple-check, we called Sigma-Aldrich sales, and a nice gentleman was happy to walk
us through the procedure to distinguish what the origin of its KLH product is.


He gave us the lot number of the KLH it was selling, and that led us to this:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 24/48


Once we pulled up the certificate of origin, the gentleman confirmed over the phone that
since the KLH was manufactured in Israel, that it was indeed Sigma's own product (not
manufactured from an outside source).


We also watched CEO Frank Oakes' presentation at the Rodman & Renshaw conference
just days ago. We've obtained the video and audio from this presentation, and have
posted them here so that everyone can see.


We note that at 18:29, when asked about the competitive landscape, the CEO responds:


"Stellar supplies KLH through a publicly announced agreement with Sigma Aldrich, a
major global reagent supplier, we produce the KLH intermediate from our aquiculture
program - they purify it into a proprietary formulation that they supply to drug
companies"


We question if the company is still, in fact, supplying Sigma Aldrich, and if they are, in
what capacity, given its limited production.


We also obtained a research report by Stonegate Securities that went out on July 15,
2014 on SBOTF. Stellar VP, Mark McPartland confirmed that Stonegate was compensated
by Stellar, and in this report, they only give SBOTF a valuation of $1.14/share:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 25/48


We also noted the disclaimer at the bottom of the report says flat-out that Stonegate is
receiving compensation from Stellar.


If company-paid analysts think SBOTF is only worth $1.14, what do non-company paid
analysts think?


The Share Count Has Risen 88.2% in Three Short Years, and the Company Placed a
Valuation of Just $27M on Itself As Recently as Last Year


We note that the number of outstanding shares in SBOTF has increased dramatically over
the last 3 years. According to the company's 2013 Form 20-F, the number of shares has
risen from 41.6 million in 2011 to 78.3 million as of today. That's an increase of 88.2% in
just three short years.


If it keeps adding shares at this percentage rate, the company will have 147 million shares
outstanding three years from now.

In the past, shares have been issued at alarming discounts.


If you reference the September 2013 private placement, you'd see that each unit was
issued for $1.05, and included a half share warrant to purchase at $1.35.


"The Company issued 11,428,570 units for total gross proceeds of $12,000,000.
Each unit consisted of one common share and one-half of a share purchase warrant,
with each full warrant exercisable into one additional common share at a price of
$1.35 for a period of three years from the issuance date of the warrants."


SBOTF, on the day prior to the announcement, closed at $1.89 per share.

How can we look to see how much SBOTF values its own shares in this particular
placement?


We can do this in an easy three-step exercise:


1. First, we can compute the value of the 5,714,285 three year-long warrants issued
during the PIPE using the Black-Scholes model.


2. Then, we subtract the value of the warrants from the gross proceeds raised by the
company during the placement ($12,000,000-$8,096,897.44). This gives us a figure of
$3,903,102.56


3. We take the result of step two and divide by 11,428,570 (number of common Shares
issued), which gives us the alarming result of $0.34/share. The work looks like this:


From this, we can derive two more alarming figures:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 28/48


1. The company offered shares on September 23, 2013 at a 81.93% discount to the pre-
announcement trading price of $1.89.


2. This deal only values the company at around $27M vs. its current market cap of
over $130M, despite any material developments at the company. We found this by
taking $0.3415 times the 78,865,031 shares outstanding at 12/31/2013 (source 3).


That leads us to ask: Why should shareholders and investors value this company at
about FIVE TIMES what the company values itself- especially given the inability of
the company to generate profit?


The Company is Operating Far Under Capacity and Is Not the Leader in KLH


In addition to the share count increasing, the company has constantly been talking about
increasing production. However, filings show that the company is by far consistently
operating under its current allocated production. The company has disclosed that for both
the fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013 (source 3), it has a production capacity of 1,500
grams of KLH/year. The Form 20-F states:


"Currently, the Company's production capacity is 1,500 grams per year. The
Company currently has live M. crenulata inventory sufficient to increase KLH
production volume by approximately 3,000 grams per year. The Company
anticipates scaling up its production through the addition of the required equipment
and personnel as demand warrants using funds received from the September 2013
private placement."


Yet, what we found in the company's last annual report is that for 2011, 2012 and 2013,
the amount of KLH grams produced seems to have been a small percentage of capacity -
and has declined year over year. The 2013 20-F (source 3) reads:


"The quantity of KLH pharmaceutical intermediate produced in fiscal 2013 was
approximately 46 grams for product development and research. The Company sold
approximately 0.34 grams of KLH in various formulations from prior years'
production. The quantity produced in 2012 was 161 grams for commercial sales,
contract obligations, product development and research and 20.5 grams of KLH in
various formulations were sold, including a portion from prior years' production. The
quantity produced in 2011 was approximately 340 grams for commercial sales,
contract obligations, product development and research. The Company sold 0.76
grams of KLH in various formulations in that fiscal year."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2514425-stellar-biotechnologies-weve-seen-the-pump-now-here-comes-the-dump 29/48


From this, we can project what capacity SBOTF has been operating at over the last three
years:


FY KLH Produced+Sold (Grams) % of 1,500g Capacity Used


2011 340.76 22.71%


2012 181.5 12.1%


2013 46.34 3.09%


We asked the company about the amount of grams produced in 2014, but we were told
we would have to wait for the coming 10-K.


This data seems to suggest to us an astonishing figure: SBOTF only produced at 3.09%
of its potential production capacity in 2013. In addition, the percentage of capacity
seems to have dropped significantly since 2011.


Puzzling about these figures is that the company seems to be pushing the
possibility of ramping up production.


In the MD&A (Exhibit 99.2) for the nine months ended May 31, 2014, the company wrote
the following:


Then, we have this mystifying paragraph buried in the company's 2013 Form 20-F (source
3):


We have to ask how much business the company actually expects to do in the coming
years that it would need to expand production by 1200%, when it's currently only
using under 4% of its 1,500g capacity and openly admit in its own filings that it
doesn't know if it's economical to manufacture?

Finally, SBOTF does not, by any means, have a monopoly on the KLH niche as the
promotion was suggesting. Biosyn Corporation has been the market leader in KLH for the
past couple of decades (source 26), and it's been in business since 1984. We reached out
to BioSyn's president, Shammana Muddukrishna, who was nice enough to speak with us
via phone. When I asked whether or not Stellar had a monopoly on KLH, he laughed.
From our conversation with Mr. Muddukrishna, we were told the following items that
should alarm SBOTF shareholders:


BioSyn got its first approval in 1997 to use KLH to treat bladder cancer, "which Stellar
is trying to mimic now."
It has supplied KLH for "almost 90% of the clinical trials that have taken place to date
and the ones that are continuing now."
If "all of the clinical trials going on now are approved, [BioSyn] will have more than
necessary to supply."
[BioSyn] has "interacted with almost all of the major pharmaceutical companies
working with KLH and they continue to use our KLH."


To add insult to injury, when told that Stellar has the capabilities to produce 1,500
grams/year, BioSyn's president said, "We already produce much more than that."


Summary and Investment Thesis


What we have here is the case of a yet another company with a "good story", but a
company that's also significantly overvalued, in our opinion. Like any other speculative
company in the biotech sector, this is a case where there's the prospect of a win in the
distant future, but we believe SBOTF to be years from tangible results and steady
fundamentals. Until they reach that point, dilution is likely going to be a reality as the
company fights to fund itself, like any other speculative biotech.


We were pleased that VP Mark McPartland took time out of his day to have a call with us,
and we in no way believe that he was being anything but honest and realistic to us when
we spoke to him. He came off as extremely knowledgeable and passionate about what the
company is trying to do, and he invited us out to visit the company - an offer that we may
take him up on in the future. He seemed to know exactly what we were talking about when
we questioned him about the promotions, and when we suggested that the stock price
may have gotten away from being realistic, he didn't come out and disagree with us.


The unfortunate circumstance that this company has found itself in, however, is one where
the stock has been pushed up to an unrealistic valuation, and the company has made the
mistake of not aggressively going after the parties involved in the false and misleading

promotion.


We believe SBOTF to be far overvalued, and we place a value on the company near what
the company placed upon itself during its September 2013 PIPE - somewhere around
$0.35-$0.50.


Now that the promotion is wearing off and the true "niche" of SBOTF's business is
exposed as one that has substantial competition with far more production capability, we
believe SBOTF will resume its pre-promotion decline, eventually making its way back to
$0.70 and resuming its downward move from there.


We expect the descent to be further catalyzed by continued dilution from the company in
coming months, as well as by lack of intrinsic fundamentals to hold the company afloat.
The company, as of its last quarterly report, has $11.2 million in shareholders' equity,
which equates to roughly $0.15 per share in equity.


So far, SBOTF has failed to achieve any substantial revenue, and is currently trading at a
price-to-sales ratio of 178.25. If "grant revenues" are excluded from total revenues, we are
left with an astounding price-to-sales ratio of 403.88. Assigning a generous multiple to
these intrinsic values, we believe a $0.35-$0.50 price target to be a reasonable and fair
measure to value the company's future prospects at this point.


Investors buying at these levels should assume caution; with Stellar Biotechnologies, we
believe we've seen the pump, and are now as is often the case, just waiting on the
inevitable dump.
