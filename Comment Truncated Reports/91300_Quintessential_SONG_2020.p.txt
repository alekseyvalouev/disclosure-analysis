QCM OPINION:
AKAZOO LOOKS LIKE AN ACCOUNTING SCHEME


• Users, subscribers, revenue and profit may be profoundly 
overstated 


• Company is a fraction of its claimed size and loss-making
• Service available only in a handful of countries (and barely used).
• We suspect round-tripping between Akazoo and foreign shell 


companies.


• Infrastructure is collapsing (offices closing, employees leaving in 
droves)


• Several key individuals may have ties with suspected frauds


We believe that Akazoo is a scheme orchestrated by 
management to profit while egregiously deceiving investors

www.qcmfunds.com


WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE


• Suspicious signs of accounting manipulation: 
• Cash inconsistencies; total lack of taxes. 


• App unavailable in many core countries.
• Disappearing infrastructure
• (undisclosed) closed offices
• Disappearing workforce


• Suspicious related party transactions.
• Links with former frauds.
• Serious allegations by field sources.

HISTORY


• Founded in 2000 by Panagiotis Dimitroupulos as 
website design company (part of InternetQ).


• IPO on London AIM market in 2010
• In 2015 InternetQ acquired R&R using a $17m private 


placement provided by Tosca/Penta.
• In 2016 company accused by UK blog 


shareprophets.com to be a suspected fraud.
• Company taken private shortly after then re-listed on 


NASDAQ in late 2019 through a reverse merger. 
Akazoo is currently living its second, and last life.

--- Private & Confidential ---42
The Evidence


In theory auditors should prevent situations such as this one
from occurring. However,  in practice this is not always the case


--- Private & Confidential ---43
www.qcmfunds.com


CROWE LLP HAS SIGNED OFF AKAZOO’S FINANCIALS 
SINCE 2015…


--- Private & Confidential ---44
www.qcmfunds.com


UNFORTUNATELY, CROWE HAS ALSO SIGNED OFF THE 
ACCOUNTS OF CORPORATE RESOURCE SERVICES* INC…


--- Private & Confidential ---45 * https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-302
www.qcmfunds.com


THE SEC DETERMINED THAT CROWE: 
• The SEC's order against Crowe finds that its audit team 


identified pervasive fraud risks in connection with its 2013 
audit of Corporate Resource Services yet failed to:


• Properly identify and audit the company's related-party 
transactions;


• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to respond to these 
fraud risks, support recognition of revenue, […]


• Evaluate substantial doubt about the company's ability to 
continue as a going concern; and


• […] Crowe was not independent as a result of an ongoing 
direct business relationship with [its client] […] Crowe’s […] 
was aware of the high-risk nature of the engagement and 
the inability to obtain appropriate evidence.


--- Private & Confidential ---46
www.qcmfunds.com


CROWE AND THE SEC - EPILOGUE


• Crowe was fined $1.5m to 
settle the charge.


• The SEC charges look to 
us similar to the issues
we suspect are 
happening at Akazoo.


• The fact that Akazoo is
using such an audit firm is
highly suspicious to us


--- Private & Confidential ---47
www.qcmfunds.com


HOW CAN COMPANIES EVADE AUDITORS CHECKS?


• Main auditors typically check
only the consolidated accounts. 


• Akazoo subsidiaries are NOT 
audited by Crowe, but by little
known local accountants.


• These local accountants do not
have the same trustworthiness. 


• We have witnessed exactly the 
same situation at Globo Plc
and at Folli Follie.

THE EVIDENCE


Inaccurate information about geographic reach and possible
copyrights infringement


--- Private & Confidential ---49
www.qcmfunds.com


IN HOW MANY COUNTRIES EXACTLY DOES AKAZOO SELL 
ITS MUSIC?


Akazoo’s claims (SEC filing Form 424 (b)(3):


“Akazoo currently operates in 25 countries throughout the 
world and PubCo may further expand its geographies throughout
its future operations.”
“ Akazoo’s revenue is derived primarily in emerging markets
(including Poland, Russia, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, 
Ecuador, Brazil and Mexico, among others). 


--- Private & Confidential ---50
www.qcmfunds.com


AKAZOO CLAIMS PRESENCE IN THESE COUNTRIES (FROM 
PRESENTATION TO INVESTORS)


--- Private & Confidential ---51
www.qcmfunds.com


QCM CHECK: EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE…
• QCM has attempted to open an account in dozens of 


countries.
• We succeeded in opening an account (using a VPN) only


in Poland, Malaysia, Indonesia, Greece, Cyprus. 
• For other countries we tried, including those where


Akazoo claims to be active in, we received the following
message: 


“We would really like to be here. For now, our
service is not available in your country. Please check


back, you never know.”


--- Private & Confidential ---52
www.qcmfunds.com


WE COULD REGISTER ONLY IN 5 COUNTRIES (OUT OF 25 
CLAIMED): WE DETECTED NO SIGNIFICANT USAGE 
ANYWHERE


Poland Orange partnership no longer in place.  Can regsiter, 
but negligible user volume*.


Russia App exists, but cannot register.


Brazil App exists, but cannot register.


Indonesia App exists, can register. Negligible usage.

QCM CHECK: MUSIC DISTRIBUTORS


• We checked with Sony Music, a major music distributor to 
Akazoo. 


• Akazoo has purchased distribution rights for only 5 (five) 
countries, namely: 
• Greece, Cyprus, Poland, Ghana and Malaysia. 


• We fear that either Akazoo is lying about its
geographic reach (25 countries claimed) or may


be breaching music copyrights.

AKAZOO SUSPECTED FAKE OFFICE IN ATHENS

AKAZOO MAY HAVE VIOLATED GDPR RULES


• In Greece Akazoo has a partnership 
wherebyViber users would have access
to Akazoo music.


• This may have allowed Akazoo access to 
end users’ contact list in their
smartphones.


• Our investigation suggests that the 
company may have used such data to 
spam promotions via sms.


If true, this might be against GDPR (EU 
online privacy) rules

Ties with former frauds

AKAZOO: EMPLOYER OF CHOICE FOR ACTUAL AND 
SUSPECTED EX-FRAUDSTERS?


• A surprising number of 
Akazoo’s employees and 
managers were formerly
employeed at Globo Plc
(a fraud exposed by 
QCM) and at Velti (a 
suspected fraud)


• Given the similarties
between Globo and

THE CURIOUS CASE OF SOLUTION SYSTEM TOUCHMEDIA


• Touchmedia (nowVeoo Malaysia) is a Malaysian company 
related to InternetQ’s CEO Panagiotis Dimitroupulos. 


• Touchmedia performs «monthly billing and collection
of revenues from the Malaysian Operators*»


• We find it highly suspicious that the CEO of Akazoo’s
former parent company controls a payment processor in 
charge of billing and collection of revenues.


• Obviously this situation, if it exists today as well, may lead
to conflicts of interest and enable dishonest behavior.

CONCLUSIONS
• Akazoo appears to be a far smaller company that it claims


to be and a rapidly shrinking one.
• Official figures show irreconciliabile discrepancies with 


objective data collected by QCM. 
• Accounting and audit history show worriying red flags.
• Allegations of fraud and other serious breaches by a field


sources. 


The facts lead us to believe that Akazoo is a 
scheme orchestrated by management to profit 


while egregiously deceiving investors


--- Private & Confidential ---64
www.qcmfunds.com


WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN? 
• If our allegations are correct, 


Akazoo’s financials may
prove false. 


• The company may have
made serious
misrepresentations on 
official SEC filings.


• Akazoo may be simply a 
gross exercise of deception
to investors and its equity be 
correspondingly worthless.


• Our target price is zero.
