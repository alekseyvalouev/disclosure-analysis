Valeant: O Tidings of Comfort and Joy
As every holiday movie watcher knows, it’s your Christmas spirit—
the very power of your belief—that gives Santa’s reindeer the get-up-and-go to deliver a
sackful of toys. But like those woebegone characters who openly ques�on the very
existence of gi�-bearing emissaries from the frozen north, we doubted Valeant’s ability to
wring new sales from old drugs, to conjure organic growth from exis�ng brands facing
generic compe��on. Shareholders had a party, and we were grumpily bah-hum-bugging
over by the bar. We didn’t believe.
 
And so, in the midst of this holiday season, we are gathered here today to announce our
triumph over doubt, our victory over misgivings, and our embrace of the fes�ve spirit.
What ghostly portend of a ghastly Christmas future has restored us to the faithful flock?
Well, like Scrooge before us, first we need a look at Christmas past.
 
Valeant completed the acquisi�on of Medicis on 11 December 2012, almost three years
ago today. And before Valeant’s warm embrace, sales of Medicis’ acne treatment Solodyn
had fallen through the ice, so to speak, according to the respec�ve 10-Q filings:
 


 
A Marketwatch ar�cle told the tale:
 


[Valeant] stock has fallen back amid worry that sales of Medicis's blockbuster drug,
Solodyn, may be declining faster than expected.…
 
Solodyn generates about 40% of Medicis's annual sales, analysts say. Morgan
Stanley & Co. es�mates the treatment accounts for around 75% of the company's
earnings per share. A Medicis representa�ve declined comment. Valeant Chief
Execu�ve Michael Pearson, in an interview, said he agreed with the 40% revenue
es�mate, but declined comment on the profit projec�on.
 
Some analysts are taking issue with the drug's growth prospects, amid signs of
flagging sales. Solodyn prescrip�ons in the U.S. fell 44% during the last week of
August from a year earlier, according to data from IMS Health, a healthcare
informa�on company. In the first two months of the third quarter, Solodyn
prescrip�ons fell 24% from the first two months of the second quarter, according
to Piper Jaffray & Co., based on IMS data.
 
On Sept. 14, Morgan Stanley downgraded Valeant to equal weight from
overweight, “concerned about Solodyn's growth outlook.”

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: O Tidings of Comfort and Joy


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-o-tidings-of-comfort-and-joy.html 2/12


But Valeant was unbowed. While its forecast of $250-$275M (p. 10) in sales for Solodyn in
2013 was far too high (actual was ~$200M, p. 5), a fairly sizeable decline from what we
can see of 2012), sales appear to have stabilized in 2014 ($210M, p. 9) and even started
growing again (LTM: $250M, #7 product worldwide as of 3Q15, p. 5).
 
Forgive the mixed metaphor, but another holiday tale provides a nice summary: sales of
Solodyn that could barely sa�sfy Wall Street for another quarter (give or take) have
miraculously lasted more than eight quarters (give or take).
 
During this �me, retail prices of Solodyn have climbed from about $700 in 2011 to over
$1100 for a 30 day supply. On Valeant’s account, they sold more pills at higher (list) prices,
despite compe��on from cheap generic alterna�ves. A holiday miracle, indeed.
 


 
 
But how? How can you sell more volume of an old drug at a higher list price while facing
generic compe��on? In fact, a recent ar�cle in JAMA Dermatology made the observa�on,
a�er checking retail prices of several dermatology drugs over a six-year period, that prices
for Valeant's drugs had risen the most.
 


 
 
The ValeantNow PR commandos, quick to the barricades, helpfully pointed out that
Valeant sells a lot of dermatology drugs and that they didn't own these for the en�re
period, just lately. Apparently retail prices rise of their own voli�on, and the fact
that “these products faced generic compe��on” makes such increases less notable, not

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: O Tidings of Comfort and Joy

more. (Note to analysts: we see the opportunity for more “cost synergies” in the
marke�ng department: at Valeant, prices self-levitate.)
 
Generous to a fault, Valeant takes pains to remind us that its net prices have risen much
more modestly. On the 3Q15 conference call, Mike Pearson said (p. 7):


 
As most of the commentary around price centers on the wholesale price or list
price, we wanted to provide a more clear picture on what Valeant actually realizes
from a price ac�on, which is considerably different than what has been portrayed.
If you look at the top 10 dermatology products, which represent approximately
62% of our dermatology por�olio, we took, on average, a 14% gross price increase
on these products this year, yet we realized less than a 2% price increase on a net
basis.
…
In reality, we increased price on 85 of our 156 branded pharmaceu�cal products,
or 54% of our products. And our average gross price increase was 36%. It is
important to note that our realized price increase was 24%.
 


Furthermore, Valeant’s “pa�ent assistance” (aka “access”) contribu�ons to unnamed
founda�ons grew far faster than its revenue, at a rate of 128% compounded from 2012 to
2016 (p. 39), reaching a projected total of ~$1B in 2016. And yet a recent presenta�on
states 14% of “organic growth” in the “promoted branded Rx business” was due to “gross-
to-net adjustments” (p. 86). As net revenue is gross minus “cash discounts and
allowances, chargebacks, and distribu�on fees...as well as rebates and returns” (p. 33)—
things that make net less than gross—doesn’t growth from gross-to-net adjustments
mean a decrease in a discount? Meaning net prices rise? (Also, discounts can shrink only
so much before disappearing; perhaps a be�er name for paying someone cash to buy
one’s drug would be “subsidy.” Colour us curious as to how “durable” this source of
organic growth will prove.)
 
Point being, this is befuddling. Apparently Valeant risked widespread public opprobrium,
unwanted press a�en�on, the ire of Congress, and even federal inves�ga�ons for what we
are told is a minor benefit to realised prices. And nobody, apparently, pays list prices. So
why did they raise them? And if they hadn’t raised gross prices, would net prices have
declined? And if the explana�on for the gross-to-net difference is the stunning growth in
rebates and discounts, what is the point of raising prices only to, in essence, give out lots
of coupons, except in the hope that such coupons don’t get used? Giving someone gold so
they can purchase your frankincense and myrhh is a strategy, I suppose.
 
You can see why we were perplexed. We didn’t believe they could raise prices, grow
volume, and increase “organic growth.” And, defying us, they did it. How? Well, Valeant
pre�y much told us. In two words: “alterna�ve fulfilment.”
 
Here’s then-CFO Howard Schiller describing, at the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference
on June 11, 2013 (p. 7), the improvements Valeant made to Medicis’ original program.
(Note: Two weeks later, Philidor would receive its first pharmacy license in Pennsylvania,
having signed a contract with Valeant within its first month of existence.)
 


Howard Schiller, CFO, Valeant
So I probably think under Medicis, alterna�ve fulfillment was held out a li�le bit
too much as the holy grail. I really think it's -- it's actually the star�ng points, and in
some ways, it was quite a clumsy star�ng point. It wasn't that different, but it's a
process where we have genera�on two and genera�on three. But it's all trying to
focus on profitable scripts, and stay away from those scripts that are unprofitable,
and more judicious use of co-pay cards and the rest, and making sure when a
customer, a pa�ent is covered, you get reimbursed for it.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: O Tidings of Comfort and Joy


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-o-tidings-of-comfort-and-joy.html 4/12


Gary Nachman, Analyst, Goldman Sachs
So do you feel like you've made a lot of progress from when you took over, and
now you can see, a couple years from now, you'll be at a point where what you're
talking about really comes to frui�on? I mean, not just with (mul�ple speakers)
 
Howard Schiller, CFO, Valeant
Yes, I think -- I'm hoping -- we've got genera�on two and genera�on three, which
I'm hoping sort of turn it into a pure defense, into more of an offensive tool to
allow us to grow profits. And that's really the focus, is growing profits.


 
Alterna�ve fulfilment with a focus on profits is what we now know (knew?) as Philidor.
 Here's what that looks like in the field: 
 
 





The elves at Philidor, creatures of the Christmas spirit all, were happy to sell Valeant’s dermatology
drugs at low, low prices. To our understanding, it worked like this: if an insurance company could be


persuaded to cover a Valeant drug dispensed by Philidor, the patient paid little if any cash co-pay. But
if the patient didn’t have insurance or was ineligible for co-pay assistance, Philidor would supply the
drug at a greatly reduced cash price. Outwardly, this is charitable, as patients get cheaper medicines


and harried doctors and pharmacists don’t have to spend time on the phone dealing with
reimbursement issues. It is also an offensive weapon to combat payers’ attempts to substitute
generics for expensive Valeant drugs, including requirements for proof of clinical necessity or


completion of step-therapies (trying the generic first).
 
Philidor was, in a sense, a prescrip�on “dri� net”: if doctors could be persuaded by
Valeant’s sales reps to direct pa�ents to Philidor to fill prescrip�ons, then Philidor’s elves
worked their magic. If your insurer could be persuaded to pay, Philidor’s team billed them
the ever-increasing full price. But if you were uninsured, your carrier couldn’t be swayed,
or your co-pay couldn’t be legally waived, then Philidor sold you Valeant’s drugs at much
lower cash prices warding off generic subs�tu�on. Since your local Walgreens or CVS
won’t spend hours on the phone trying to convince a reluctant insurer that a branded
drug is required—unless your doctor wrote “dispense-as-wri�en,” they’ll just give you the
generic and you’ll be on your way—Valeant needed what is essen�ally a �ed pharmacy,
namely Philidor.
 
This, we must admit, is diabolically clever. List prices for drugs can skyrocket, and some
insurers will be persuaded to pay them (net of rebates). Average net prices, however,
won’t move up as much, as some prescrip�ons are sold cheap to those insurance won’t
cover or whose co-pays can’t be legally waived. Meanwhile the volume of Valeant
prescrip�ons dispensed grows, as some pa�ents who would have bought the generic at
Walgreens get the branded drug instead at prices low enough to avoid subs�tu�on
(especially as the cap�ve pharmacy does not offer a subs�tute). Insurers’ second line of

defence a�er co-pays—extra paperwork for harried doctors and pharmacists to prove the
medical necessity of a higher-�er medica�on with a generic alterna�ve—is de�ly evaded
by a team of elves dedicated to obtaining as large a reimbursement as possible,
apparently by any means necessary.
 
What’s more, finding ways to get insurers to pay for a large number of expensive branded
prescrip�ons is a nice cudgel with which to beat them into agreeing to trade larger
rebates in one therapeu�c area for be�er coverage in another. Six months later, at
another Goldman Sachs conference on Jan. 7, 2014, Mr Pearson described the progress of
Solodyn and “alterna�ve fulfilment 2.0” (p. 7-8):


 
Gary Nachman, Analyst, Goldman Sachs
On the derm side, just we've talked about this in the past, but the alterna�ve
fulfillment program that you inherited with the Medicis transac�on and Solodyn
has been sort of the bellwether product and you guided very conserva�vely and
then it stabilized. It seems to have declined a li�le bit more recently. Just in terms
of what they were trying to accomplish to improve the profitability of the
prescrip�ons, have you guys go�en there? And is that an important part of the
derm business at this point?
 
Mike Pearson, Chairman & CEO, Valeant Pharmaceu�cals Interna�onal
No, I'd say we didn't -- we have not been as successful with Solodyn as we had
planned and that is why we have -- now the one silver lining that has been a very
good bargaining chip with managed care. And since it is one of the largest and
most expensive derm products, we have been able to trade discounts for Solodyn
to include other products or get pricing in other parts, so we have been using that
pre�y aggressively. So from an economic standpoint, it delivers more than its
weight.
The AF program was I think rolled out a li�le bit too quickly and there were lots of
bugs in it and we have a next genera�on that we're going to -- which we are
implemen�ng, which we aren't going to talk about the details of, but net-net I
think Solodyn, it's a lot less important to us now than when we -- than it was to
Medicis obviously.


 
Perhaps investors will inquire what the loss of Philidor will mean for those rebate
discussions.
 
It doesn’t end there. Like Santa’s network of hidden workshops, Philidor was non-
repor�ng, so volumes dispensed and prices paid were invisible to the outside world. Had
Santa not been extra careful to file UCC statements securing his interests in the elves’
tools—and not crossed paths with an obstreperous pharmacist at R&O—we would have
been none the wiser.
 
Add to this financial consolida�on, removing the requirement to iden�fy Philidor as a
customer. Throw in a set of nested zero-strike op�ons to avoid the need (perhaps) to re-
license the pharmacy in 50 states. Toss in a mountain of LLCs with obscure names that
Valeant was shocked (shocked!) to learn about thanks to the damnable short sellers who
were kind enough to inform them. The point being, Santa’s no dummy.
 
On this hypothesis, Philidor allowed Valeant to increase list prices and to show volume
growth besides—all without anyone no�cing. Anybody who can deliver millions of
presents while remaining u�erly invisible has some serious reindeer-power (or works for
Alibaba).
 
We believe that Philidor was a bigger success than Valeant and most investors (ourselves
included) could have imagined. But now, with Philidor unwound, Valeant now faces the

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: O Tidings of Comfort and Joy

task of rebuilding its network of atypical “specialty pharmacies” that dispense its
expensive branded products in the U.S.
 
To get a sense of how challenging that might be, we need to get our arms around
Philidor’s contribu�on to Valeant’s results. Just how successful was this secret fulfilment
network? On a scale of one to “team of eight flying reindeer,” Philidor was Rudolf. Let’s
talk numbers.
 
Valeant maintains that Philidor’s contribu�on to pulling the sleigh has been modest, at
best. On the Oct. 26, 2015, call they said:


In Q3 2015, Philidor represented 6.8% of total Valeant revenue (p. 10)


Philidor accounts for 5.9% of Valeant net revenue YTD (p. 11)


At the time of the Purchase Option Agreement in December, 2014, Philidor YTD  net
sales were $111 million  (p. 53)


Mr Pearson emphasized Philidor’s apparently meagre contribution, stating on Nov. 10: “Lost in all the
news about Philidor is the fact that it represented only $190 million of revenue in the third quarter, or
6.8% of our $2.8 billion in overall revenues for the quarter” (p. 4). With $454.9M of revenue YTD
(5.9% of the total) and $189.5M in 3Q (6.8% of the total), that means 1Q+2Q were $265.4M, an
average of $132.7M for the first two quarters. In other words, on average, Philidor exceeded its entire
2014 total in the first quarter alone. That is impressive growth. 
 


 
 
Philidor grew from almost nothing to almost 7% of sales over three quarters. If we weight
the 1Q and 2Q figure of $265.4M by Valeant’s US revenue in 1Q15 and 2Q15, we can
es�mate that Philidor has been growing at an average of 28.5% quarter over quarter in
2015. (As far as we know, Philidor only operated in the United States.) Had Philidor’s only
customer not decided to sever a rela�onship it defended as “legal and maybe…unusual”
(p. 20) mere days before, we presume such growth would have con�nued. Applying the
same growth rate of 25.9% that we es�mated for 3Q/2Q, Philidor could have hit $238.5M
in 4Q revenue, for a 2015 total of $693.4M. (Arguably we could have weighted this by
dermatology sales instead—see below—but the difference is minor, and non-dermatology
products were being added to the Philidor stable.)
 


 
 
Perhaps you are a jaded Wall Street type who doesn’t find this par�cularly notable. Well,
consider this: over the first three years of meaningful revenue genera�on, Philidor
trounced both Google and Facebook in dollars collected. (Yes, most of this was pass-
through to Valeant. ’Twas ever thus.)

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-o-tidings-of-comfort-and-joy.html 7/12


 
 
Most companies facing the difficult problem of how best to announce a wild success
choose the “shout it from the roo�ops” solu�on. But as we all know, other than his mode
of entry and egress, Santa likes to keep his methods a bit more covert. Asked on July 31,
2014, about the stupendous growth of the “second genera�on” of alterna�ve fulfilment
(aka Philidor, up and running for over 1.5 years by that �me), Mr Pearson was a bit more
circumspect (p. 38).
 


Greg Fraser, Analyst, Deutsche Bank
Okay. And then just a last ques�on on the alterna�ve fulfillment ini�a�ves. I know
you've made improvements there, versus what Medicis was doing. Can you just
give us a sense of how much volume tends to run through that channel? And what
products you've [rolled] that program out to?...
 
J. Michael Pearson, CEO, Valeant
We're not going to give specifics. It's—we think it's a compe��ve advantage that
we have. And it is s�ll primarily the Medicis products, although not exclusively the
Medicis products. And—but I don't want to give specific numbers, but it is a very
successful ini�a�ve.


 
(When word of Philidor leaked out, Valeant was quick to men�on that other companies
had “specialty pharmacy” rela�onships, too (p. 8). How a common, nothing-to-see-here
industry prac�ce is also a compe��ve advantage is for wiser folks than ourselves to
contemplate. Perhaps such i�nerant wise men could also tell us why we know Philidor’s
revenue to two significant figures but its “EBITA” to barely one [“~7%”] and then only for
3Q.)
 
Anyway, the elves at Philidor—toiling away in invisible, snow-bound factories—were even
more industrious than Santa could have hoped. Beyond their contribu�on to overall
growth, Philidor had the poten�al to shi� the mix of sales in ways that ma�ered greatly to
Wall Street, and hence to Valeant. Like the spoiled children they are, Wall Street types
aren’t sa�sfied with a pricier gi� every year; they also want more in number. More
concretely, Wall Street wishes for “organic” growth in revenues, meaning increases in
volume, not just price.
 
As above, it seems reasonable to assume that Philidor only operated in the US, as
otherwise it would have needed licenses to ship medica�ons to other countries (and
Valeant would need rights to sell each drug in those countries). So while management
compared Philidor to total revenue, let’s have a look at our quarterly es�mates compared
to U.S. sales in 2015.
 


 
 
Now 9.6% (3Q) isn’t all that much more than the 6.8% we were told, but it’s a heck of a lot

more than 2.5% (1Q) and closer to the magic 10% of materiality. And remember, Philidor
was only $111M for all of 2014. If anything, Philidor was rapidly becoming far more
important to Valeant than they let on.
 
But even this comparison leaves something out. For as we explained above, what
dis�nguished Philidor was its ability sell Valeant’s branded drugs. According to the most
recent quarterly earnings presenta�on (p. 24), sales of “U.S. Branded Rx”—the bea�ng
heart of Philidor—were $914M in 3Q15. As Philidor’s revenues in the same period totalled
$189.5M, Philidor was responsible for 20.7% of US branded drug sales. (That’s not quite
two reindeer out of eight, for those not yet sick of the Christmas metaphor.)
 
In fact, if we look at US “same store sales,” Philidor’s contribu�on to Valeant’s growth is
even more apparent. As a percentage of “same store sales” in each quarter of 2015, on
our es�mates, Philidor’s revenue had mushroomed from 9.7% in the first quarter to 14.4%
in 3Q, and could have reached 16.5% of US same store sales in 4Q15 (using the original
10% “same store sales” growth es�mate Valeant provided for 4Q).
 


 
Philidor itself accounted for a substan�al por�on of same store sales growth. If we take it
out en�rely, then such growth is cut in half, and might even be nega�ve in 4Q15 on our
es�mates. If only 50% of Philidor’s revenue is lost, the “organic sales growth” numbers
would look far less gaudy. Moreover, Valeant has disclosed the increase in price in US
branded Rx (the vast bulk of Philidor’s revenue, we believe). Even if only 50% of Philidor’s
revenue is lost, the average price increase for US branded Rx exceeds the remaining rate of
organic growth. The implica�on: volume growth ex-Philidor is minimal/nega�ve. Not only
that, but we are told dermatology prices rose less than other segments, meaning that ex-
Philidor, the average price increase as a component of same store sales growth is higher
yet.
 
Now Philidor didn’t dispense every product sold by Valeant. As Mr Pearson stated on the
Nov. 10 conference call, Philidor’s revenues were “99% dermatology” (p. 10). 
 


 
Using this figure, we discover that Philidor accounted for almost 40.3% of dermatology
revenue in 3Q15 and 33.4% of 2015 YTD. Dermatology was a bright spot for Valeant this
year, having generated $438.9M more in revenue through the first three quarters of 2015
than it did over the same period in 2014. As Philidor notched $454.9M YTD, versus
~$111M in 2014, it seems fair to conclude that the vast majority of this year’s dollar
growth in US dermatology revenue was effec�vely Philidor.

And this, dear reader, is the problem: Philidor succeeded all too well. Philidor managed to
make old drugs with generic compe��on into “durable” machines for “organic
growth.” Sell-side analysts, the most eager believers in the power of the corporate Santa
Claus, were right all along: Valeant did have something special. It just wasn’t the
“decentralized opera�ng model” (p. 3) and the heaping dollop of McKinseyism that
everyone thought.
 
But now, on direct orders from the Christmas-ha�ng grinches at PBMs,
payers, conspiratorial na�ering nabobs of nega�vism, and—who else?—Congress, the
miracle on Horsham Road has officially declared its receipt of a lump of coal. Valeant,
meanwhile, is working very hard to “put in place a new specialty program to complement
the retail scripts” (p. 7) to replace Philidor.
 
One problem, of course, is that PBMs and payers are wising up to what’s been going on.
And they have ways to fight back against the rising �de of “specialty pharmacies.” A
pharmacy that dispenses almost en�rely branded dermatology drugs from one company
tends to s�ck out, we’d imagine. 
 
Also, if it took the magic of Philidor to make drugs like Solodyn grow “organically,” how
“durable” are those products really? Some have argued that growth in IMS-reported
prescrip�on numbers a�er Philidor’s disclosure in late October shows that Valeant didn't
really need them anyway. (They come not to praise Philidor, but to bury it.) Why, then, did
Philidor exist at all? How was it a “compe��ve advantage?” Why did a rapidly growing
por�on of Valeant’s revenue pass through its fingers? Valeant says that drugs sold by
Philidor were less profitable. So who needs the hassle and the secrecy? The point is not
that there’s no demand for Valeant’s drugs, only that Philidor makes such demand appear
ar�ficially robust, in our es�ma�on. If nary a prescrip�on will be lost without Philidor,
surely Valeant wouldn’t have sought to expand it or, a�er its hasty burial, to resurrect it.
 
On that note, we pause here for a brief holiday message.
 
Dear “specialty pharmacy” workshops that Valeant is feverishly rebuilding atop the ruins
of Philidor. We wish to inform you that Santa may be watching you via a joint steering
commi�ee, may have superhero supernumeraries sta�oned on your premises, may have a
zero-strike op�on to purchase you, and may even be consolida�ng your naughty-and-
niceness onto his big ledger. But should a present-delivering mishap occur, you elves are
on your own, ’cause Santa is legally indemnified. Pay a�en�on, Direct Success Pharmacy
of New Jersey.
 
Enough about them. What about the people most in need of our thoughts and prayers
during the holiday season, the large ins�tu�onal shareholders? Reuters reports that
“Investors said Wall Street wanted three things from Wednesday's mee�ng: a 2016
forecast for earnings around $14 per share versus the $11 projected for 2015, no more
bad news or surprises, and a new plan for selling dermatology products through specialty
pharmacies.” We confess that we don’t quite understand why a promise of “no more bad
news” would be more convincing today than it was on say, October 19, the date of the
third quarter call on which Philidor's existence was first disclosed. Maybe we’re ge�ng
too old for Santa.
 
Anyway, for those who believe, in whose heads dance visions of sugarplums, 20% IRRs,
six-year cash paybacks, and up-and-to-the-right price charts, what will they find in their
stock(ings)? Like all well-behaved children—mindful of their manners when Santa is
watching—what investors want most is a return to the happy golden days of yore. For
once we are old enough to learn the truth about Santa, receiving presents is never the
same.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-o-tidings-of-comfort-and-joy.html 10/12


Posted by John Hempton at 11:46 PM  


But don’t worry, Valeant’s got a plan. And, like kids on Christmas morning, shareholders can’t wait
until 8 AM EST on December 16, when a jolly man in a suit will slide down the conference call
chimney bearing gifts, good tidings (non-GAAP) for the new year, a hankering for cookies, and the
joyous and comforting news that the end of the Philidor miracle was a non-cash event. 
 
 
 
 
Postscript 
 
Overflowing with the holiday spirit, I’ll save the cheery folks at ValeantNow a few minutes. 
 
Here are a few responses they might consider, and why I believe they are wrong. 
 
1) Philidor wasn’t acquired until December 2014, so it wouldn’t be part of “same store sales” or
“organic growth.” 
 
This is a distinction without a difference. First, Valeant has stated that Philidor was an ordinary, arms-
length customer before December 2014. Sales of drugs to Philidor—like any pharmacy—were thus
included in Valeant’s 2014 revenue. Comparing 2015 to 2014 is perfectly fair, as the drugs sold to or
through Philidor were counted in Valeant’s revenue in both years (and as far back as 2013, when it
started). When Valeant consolidated Philidor is irrelevant. 
 
Second, if we excluded Philidor’s revenue from same-store sales in 2015, then the stated numbers
wouldn’t match. Total US sales in 3Q15 were $1,968.2M, while “same store sales” were $1,315.4M, a
difference of $652.8M. The difference should roughly match 3Q sales of products acquired in 2015.
To wit: GI and Urology/Oncology, acquired this year from Salix and Dendreon, generated $462.8M
and $69.3M in 3Q15, while Isuprel and Nitropress added $50M and $35M, respectively. Those four
together total $617.1M. If we are to add Philidor’s $189.5M to this $617.1M, then the reported same
store sales figure is overstated. (Even ignoring Isuprel and Nitropress, the difference would be too
large.) Point being: Valeant counted Philidor’s numbers in organic growth, and so do we. 
 
(Note that the total U.S. Sales numbers in Table 3 and Table 6 of the 3Q press release don’t match, at
$1,968.2M vs. $1,947.8M, respectively, and the difference is more than the footnote to Table 6
explains. We’ve used the figure from Table 3, as it’s the largest such difference and thus would be
most contrary to our explanation.) 
 
2) “Philidor didn’t only dispense Valeant products.” Ok, but as you have told us, the difference is about
$1M a quarter (p. 8).  We’d be happy to have a detailed breakdown of the price and volume of each
drug Philidor dispensed (see #3 below), so please feel free to provide one. 
 
3) “Philidor dispensed more than just branded products.” Sure. Please provide a list of the Valeant
products Philidor dispensed, with a count of prescriptions filled and average total prices paid, grouped
by drug and by co-pay amount.
