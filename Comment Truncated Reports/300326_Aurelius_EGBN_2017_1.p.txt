We are short Eagle Bancorp (NASDAQ: EGBN) because we have
uncovered evidence of an insider loan scheme involving the CEO and
certain Board Members that we believe jeopardizes the safety and
soundness of the bank while potentially leading to severe regulatory
penalties.  In our opinion, insiders treat Eagle as their own private
piggy bank.


Eagle Bancorp is a Maryland headquartered regional bank earning
outsized yields by primarily making commercial real estate and
development loans.  Many investors appear to believe that Eagle
offers robust growth with minimal risk, a narrative that underpins the
stock’s surge to all-time highs and a $2.3 Billion market
capitalization. But our research has uncovered a pattern of conduct
that we believe is hauntingly similar to the characteristics that have
preceded previous bank failures:


Large Insider loans that �nance the CEO’s companies but
haven’t been disclosed.


Fraud accusations that favorable loans are used to enrich the
CEO and certain Board Members.


Undisclosed �nancial entanglements between largest
borrowers and the CEO


Indications that loans to companies owned by insiders are
distressed.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 3/37


Compromised and con�icted Board oversight.


Large recent Insider stock sales.


Eagle’s Chairman and CEO, Ronald D. Paul, has used Eagle to issue
large preferential loans in exchange for being personally awarded
cheap equity stakes in Eagle borrowers, according to undisclosed
fraud suits �led by the founders of two businesses co-owned by
Paul.  Documents show that Paul even extracted a $35 million
deferred loan origination fee for himself in a transaction that
simultaneously included Eagle modifying the borrower’s loan. An
email sent from the private accounts of Paul and Eagle’s General
counsel asks for the founder of a different borrower co-owned by
Paul to sign retroactive documents that are allegedly used by Paul to
cover up his self-dealing from Federal Reserve examiners.


Our research suggests that Eagle’s expansion into riskier Acquisition
Development and Construction loans is fueled by Paul’s own
business interests rather than those of shareholders. Documents
reveal that Eagle has made over $180 million in loans to �nance the
ventures of Paul’s private real estate company through a series of
undisclosed transactions that may violate the law.  Paul’s company
also holds undisclosed direct/indirect �nancial stakes in real estate
developments of two of Eagle’s largest borrowers who, in turn, have
received hundreds of millions in loans from the bank.


Many of Eagle’s “Independent” Directors have received loans or
appear to be otherwise bene�ting from transactions with the bank
they’re entrusted with overseeing.  The Directors have collectively
received over $80 million in loans from Eagle with several Directors
also investing alongside Paul in at least one borrower. Loans from
Eagle also �nance business ventures of two members of the Audit
Committee, including the Chairman, who previously consented to a
permanent injunction with the SEC to settle insider trading
allegations (without admitting or denying wrongdoing).


The fundamental problem is that insider self-dealing is often
symptomatic of pervasive rot within the institution’s lending and risk
management functions. History demonstrates that bad banks have
been able to hide the risks lurking in their portfolios during benign
credit cycles, only to have them explode to the surface once the

music stops. With shares trading at a premium valuation of 2.4x
book value, it is our belief that investors simply have yet to discount
the true nature of Eagle’s activities.  We therefore see enormous
downside potential in EGBN shares.


Our Research Process


We completed an exhaustive forensic investigation into Eagle’s
undisclosed activities.  We analyzed thousands of pages of public
documents including court records, corporate entity ownership
records, county deed records of real estate transactions, and state
UCC �lings (which are used to perfect loans).   We also engaged a
former senior FDIC attorney (“FDIC attorney consultant”) who has
over 40 years of experience focusing on banking regulations.  The
FDIC attorney consultant helped us assess Eagle’s compliance with
banking regulations as well as the potential implications for Eagle’s
regulatory exams.


Background


Executive self-dealing and insider loan fraud have featured
prominently in bank failures throughout history.  A federal study into
286 earlier bank failures found insider malfeasance at about half of
them.


Examples include Westsound Bank, where the FDIC said insiders
“acted in their own self-interest at the expense of the bank”.  Prior to
its 2009 collapse, Westsound made millions of dollars of generous
loans to �nance the Chairman’s real estate enterprise, the banks
directors, and construction developments where the bank’s top loan
o�cer held an undisclosed �nancial stake.


The head of Virginia’s failed Bank of the Commonwealth was
sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2013 after having treated the bank
“as his own personal �efdom”.  The fraud included reciprocal
relationships whereby insiders would receive favors and bene�ts
from borrowers in exchange for favorable real estate loans from the
bank.

Insider self-dealing is closely associated with bank failures because
it is often symptomatic of severe de�ciencies in the institution’s
lending and risk management functions.  When regulators see
insider self-dealing “they suspect everything else”, according to a
banking expert quoted in an article on Westsound’s collapse.


A federal law, Regulation O, guards against insider malfeasance by
prohibiting preferential loans to insiders and severely limiting loans
to executive o�cers.  Insider loans and ties between insiders and
borrowers are amongst the most serious aspects of regulatory
exams, according to our FDIC attorney consultant. The consultant
also explained that since since Reg O violations can trigger penalties
of as much as $1.1 million per day, many banks avoid making insider
loans of any kind.


Undisclosed Fraud Allegations Point To “Cheap Debt for Equity”
Insider Enrichment Scheme


While acting as the Chairman and CEO of Eagle, Ronald D. Paul
simultaneously is the President of the Ronald D. Paul Companies
(“RDP”), which owns a portfolio of real estate properties and
operating businesses. Paul has used Eagle to issue preferential
loans in exchange for being awarded cheap equity stakes in Eagle
borrowers, according to undisclosed fraud suits �led by the founders
of two different businesses co-owned by Paul. These allegations, if
proven, are extremely problematic because they appear to put Paul in
direct con�ict with his �duciary obligations to Eagle’s investors and
depositors.


The �rst suit was �led in February 2017 by Raymond Rahbar, the
founder of a co-working business named MakeO�ces, against
Ronald Paul and a�liates of MRP Realty (“MRP”), a developer that is
one of Eagle’s largest borrowers that also owns a stake in
MakeO�ces (Case No. 2017 02133 Fairfax County Virginia Circuit
Court). Rahbar states that he was initially referred to Eagle by MRP in
2015 for a “cheap debt for equity” deal with Mr. Paul. According to
the complaint, MakeO�ces then received a $10 million line of credit
from Eagle at preferential terms not otherwise available in exchange
for Rahbar personally awarding Paul an equity interest in
MakeO�ces at a favorable valuation.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 6/37


To conceal his self-dealing from regulators, Rahbar states that Paul
began to pressure him to sign retroactive documents that Paul said
he needed in order to “demonstrate ‘legitimacy’ to the Federal
Reserve during routine audits”. In a February 2016 email (below) sent
approximately 7 months after the loan was made, Paul requested
that Rahbar sign a “clari�cation letter” created by Eagle’s General
Counsel, Larry Bensignor. The proposed letter, “to be typed on Make
O�ce letterhead”, called for Rahbar to attest that there were “no
tying arrangements” between the terms of the loan from Eagle and
Paul’s investment in MakeO�ces. Paul and Bensignor also needed
Rahbar to attest that he did “not believe we received and we would
not accept terms from EagleBank more favorable than market” and
“we consider the relationship we are developing with you [Paul] and
the relationship we have with EagleBank to be independent”.

7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 7/37


According to the former senior FDIC attorney we engaged as a
consultant, the allegation that Paul is deceiving regulators about
loans to companies he owns is extremely serious and could explain
how this activity has persisted. The mere existence of this letter
should cause bank examiners to ask “What is going on here? This is
a problem because it is so unusual”.


Separate undisclosed fraud allegations surfaced in a complaint �led
in August 2017 by Ted and Mark Neal, the co-founders of a
restaurant company named Matchbox Food Group against Eagle
Bancorp, Ronald Paul, and Directors of Eagle (Case No. 430230-V
Montgomery County Maryland Circuit Court).  The complaint states
that Eagle loaned $25 million to Matchbox, where Mr. Paul’s brother
is a senior manager. Then in March 2016, a group of investors led by



http://aureliusvalue.com/content/uploads/2017/11/Matchbox-Case-Neal-Copy.pdf

https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevepaul12/
7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 8/37


Paul made a $10 million investment in Matchbox in exchange for
interest payments and a 6% non-dilutable equity interest.


After Matchbox’s cash �ow began to deteriorate, the complaint
states that Paul gained control of the company through an additional
$10 million investment made through an entity he controls named
Egg Cream, LLC in August 2016.  Paul used his position at Eagle to
accomplish the transaction by threatening to “padlock the doors”
unless the owners “take this money and sign all of the documents”,
according to the Neals.


In exchange for the additional investment, the transaction
documents (here) show that Egg Cream extracted a $35 million
deferred loan origination fee from Matchbox in a deal that included
Eagle simultaneously modifying its loan.  This transaction strikes us
a very clear example of self-dealing, especially since Eagle’s General
Counsel is also an investor personally in Matchbox and was
appointed to its Board of Managers with Paul. It also puts Paul and
Bensignor on the opposite side of the table from Eagle (as Matchbox
representatives) when they should be exclusively focused on the
interests of Eagle investors.

proceedings


There are indications that Eagle’s loans to Matchbox and
MakeO�ces are distressed, which is problematic because the FDIC
attorney consultant explained that bad insider loans tend to “wake
up” bank examiners.  Furthermore, banks are required to provide
more detailed disclosures in SEC �lings of all related party loans that
are “restructured or potential problems”, but the existence of these
loans wasn’t even disclosed to investors in the �rst place.

Paul and his co-defendants have denied the allegations and separate
complaints are �led against both Rahbar and the Neal brothers
alleging that they misappropriated assets from the companies
(Rahbar: Case No. 2017 00817 Fairfax County Virginia, Smith v. Neal:
Case No 430230 Montgomery County.) But even if this is true, it only
worsens the fact pattern for Eagle because it means the loans were
subject to fraud on top of the apparent �nancial deterioration of the
businesses.


After Rahbar was ousted as CEO, a July 2017 letter sent by
MakeO�ces to its former general counsel, Jaimie Shapiro, states
that MakeO�ces “likely faces bankruptcy” and is “millions of dollars
in arrears and under the threat of eviction at most or all of its
operating locations”.  Other documents �led in court state that
MakeO�ces became “in technical default of its loan obligations with
Eagle Bank” as early as 2016.


Source: Exhibit to Case 1:17-cv-01759-EGS  in U.S. District Court
District of Columbia related to a wrongful termination suit brought by
Ms. Shapiro. Her departure from MakeO�ces triggered both parties
to accuse each other of wrongdoing (with Shapiro being named a co-
defendant in the suit against Rahbar).


The default of an Eagle loan to a company owned by Paul would
likely undermine the credibility of his claims regarding the bank’s
credit discipline. Therefore, Paul’s restructuring efforts may have
also been intended to keep the existence of the loans from being
exposed to investors. The Neal’s complaint even states that a
Matchbox partner had hired Paul’s brother as a cheap “insurance
policy” and that Ron Paul would not trigger the “default any of our
loans because of his reputation as Chairman of Eagle Bank”.  This
assertion makes sense because Matchbox’s default likely would

have forced Paul to report it to investors, raising tough questions
about his involvement.


More broadly, we �nd this pattern of behavior as being strongly
suggestive of pervasive undisclosed insider activity. Since these
dealings surfaced only because Paul’s feuds with the founders
bubbled over into nasty litigation, how many similar situations must
be buried inside Eagle’s balance sheet?


Undisclosed Loans That Finance CEO’s Real Estate Ventures Elevate
Eagle’s Risk Pro�le and May Violate the Law


Our research suggests that Eagle’s expansion into riskier Acquisition
Construction and Development (“ADC”) loans is fueled, at least in
part, by Paul’s outside business interests rather than those of
shareholders. Documents show that Eagle has made over $180
million in undisclosed loans to �nance RDP’s real estate ventures. 
RDP also has direct/indirect �nancial stakes in real estate
developments of two of the bank’s largest borrowers, Akridge and
MRP, which have collectively received hundreds of millions in loans
from Eagle.


Not only do these activities dramatically heighten Eagle’s overall risk
pro�le, but they could potentially trigger severe regulatory penalties.
According to our FDIC attorney consultant, the existence of loans of
this nature would be “wildly in excess” of what’s permitted under Reg
O. Regulators typically view violations as a direct threat to a bank’s
safety and soundness because “time and time again its violations of
these regulations that lead to a bank’s downfall”.


According to public documents we obtained, Eagle has made loans
�nancing at least 10 different RDP properties with amounts totaling
over $180 million or over 21% of the company’s Tier 1 capital of $827

million.   We know RDP owns these properties because its website
speci�cally names them as such along with pro�les detailing
planned developments.  Some of these deals appear to be controlled
entirely by RDP, while others are described as joint ventures between
RDP and other parties. Deed records and UCC �lings con�rm the
existence of loans from Eagle secured by the properties with
documents that, in some cases, even bear the signature of RDP’s
COO.  We have included a detailed explanation of the forensic trail of
documents used to identify each of these loans in exhibit A.

Note: The loan amounts re�ect totals found in deed records as of a
point in time and so the balances currently outstanding could differ
signi�cantly.


Our FDIC attorney consultant con�rmed that Reg O speci�cally
prohibits loans to executive o�cers and their related interests
(companies they control) in excess of $100 thousand except in the
narrow circumstances of �nancing a home or children’s education
(see § 215.5 (c)). During a recent call with another investor, an Eagle
representative stated that no executive can borrow from the bank



https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/7500-1300.html
7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 14/37


except in these circumstances.  Eagle representatives also
repeatedly denied that Eagle makes any loans to RDP:


“on any of the properties that Ron owns individually that is through his
company, he does not borrow from the bank to �nance those
projects…he never has. He just feels that would be a con�ict and he’s
never done that”


But this is clearly false.


Eagle even appears have �nanced Paul’s speculation in land. Deed
records (here) show that Eagle made a $7.5 million loan in 2015
(later up-sized to $9.3 million) to �nance RDP’s purchase of a vacant
Washington DC parcel near the baseball stadium.  An October 2016
image of the site shows a sign bearing RDP’s logo promising a future
development that RDP’s website describes as being a potential
mixed-use concept. Shortly after the purchase, Mr. Paul told the
Washington Business Journal that he was contemplating future
development at the site but “we’re going to hold it for a while, we
have no immediate plans. We believe the market is strong as ever”.


In our opinion, this transaction alone may violate Reg O because RDP
is clearly a related interest of Paul’s and therefore included in the
law’s prohibitions.  Many transactions we reviewed are similarly
structured so that the Eagle makes loans to LLCs owned by the
Potomac Investment Trust, an entity created by Paul for the bene�t
of his family. But according to our FDIC attorney consultant,



http://aureliusvalue.com/content/uploads/2017/12/1319-South-Clean.pdf

7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 15/37


structuring the transactions through the trust does not open any
loopholes in Reg O for Paul. Especially since the Trustee is Kathleen
McCallum, RDP’s Chief Operating O�cer, and the properties held by
the trust appear to be controlled by Paul as an extension of RDP (as
seen in this example).


The other key consideration is if Eagle’s loans to RDP contain
preferential terms, the existence of which would violate Reg O.  We
�nd it unusual that the majority of the properties RDP lists as being
“under development” are �nanced by loans from Eagle while the
majority of RDP’s stabilized properties are �nanced by loans from
other banks. This suggests that RDP might be using Eagle to �nance
riskier ventures at terms it could not get elsewhere. Otherwise why
wouldn’t RDP have also used loans from these other banks to
�nance its development deals?


RDP also holds �nancial stakes in the real estate developments of at
least two of the bank’s largest borrowers, Akridge and MRP. This
creates serious con�icts of interest for Paul because Eagle has
made hundreds of million in loans to these developers and, in at
least four cases, RDP holds a �nancial stake in the deals.
 Documents, for example, show Eagle made large loans to �nance
two “trophy” o�ce developments that RDP’s website speci�cally
describes as being joint ventures with Akridge (1701 Rhode Island
and 1760 Reston). RDP has also partnered with Akridge for a third
o�ce tower development, One Tysons East.  Eagle, in turn, has made
loans for other Akridge developments such as an o�ce tower at
1101 Sixteenth Street which just broke ground in September.


RDP also has numerous joint ventures with MRP, described in a
media account as “cowboys” having a “very disciplined, wild west
philosophy”.  RDP’s website lists ten different “Venture Capital
Investments” in properties that are simultaneously featured as
“portfolio” properties on MRP’s website.

Our review of Delaware UCC �lings indicates that Eagle has �nanced
at least 8 MRP real estate deals, including ambitious development
projects near DC’s waterfront where a media report states that Paul
has also partnered with MRP.  At least two loans from Eagle �nance

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 18/37


MRP/RDP ventures, an industrial building named Collington Park and
a planned development at 600 Rhode Island in Washington DC.


Loans to RDP, Akridge, and MRP comprise a sizeable portion of
Eagle’s ADC portfolio, which its SEC �lings recognize as being
inherently risky because it includes loans tied to speculative real
estate developments that often generate no cash �ow until
stabilization. Since these loans are highly sensitive to cyclical
downturns even with normal underwriting standards, the Federal
Reserve has published risk guidance that establishes threshold
amounts for this category. Eagle’s ADC loans have grown materially
in excess of this guidance to $1.44 Billion or 23% of the bank’s total
loans (more than 30% above the amount implied by the threshold).


Disclosures state that 79% of Eagle’s ADC portfolio is serviced by
loan funded interest reserves, meaning that the borrowers pay
interest with funds from the initial loan disbursement as opposed to
cash generated by the property.  The bank’s SEC �lings recognize
that “one of the risks inherent in the use of interest reserves is the
potential masking of underlying problems with the project and/or the
borrower’s ability to repay the loan”.  This risk strikes us as being
particularly acute because RDP has a �nancial stake in so many of
the borrowers. After all, if Paul is unwilling to trigger the default of
loans to Matchbox, why would he trigger the default of large loans
tied to developments he is involved in?


Activities of “Independent” Director’s Undermines Board Oversight


Eagle’s Board of Directors, by de�nition, should be watchdogs who
are responsible for preventing and deterring loan fraud.  But our
research shows that certain purportedly independent Directors have
received large loans from the bank while also investing alongside
Paul in at least one Eagle borrower.

7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 19/37


These activities create serious con�icts of interest because the
Directors have received loans or otherwise appear to be bene�ting
from transactions with the bank they’re entrusted with overseeing.
Unlike loans to executive o�cers, Reg O does not have the same
prohibitions on loans to Directors so long as the terms are not
preferential.  But the practice is controversial because it has
historically been symptomatic of poor board oversight that has
preceded bank failures.


Eagle’s proxy includes a brief paragraph revealing that insider loans
in 2016 amounted to $82 million, or roughly 10% of Tier 1 Capital,
with an ending balance of $52 million. An Eagle representative
stated that this total consists primarily of credit lines to the bank’s
Directors. Since Eagle has disclosed related party loans to the
Directors and not Mr. Paul, our FDIC attorney consultant questioned
if the board has approved the loans �nancing Paul’s companies.


On the surface, it seems possible that the board could be unaware of
the existence of the loans involving Paul.  But documents �led in the
Matchbox case (here) demonstrate that Directors Harvey Goodman,
Steve Fanaroff, and Robert Pincus (the recently retired Vice
Chairman) invested with Paul and Bensignor in Matchbox.

Director Goodman signed as a Matchbox investor using his Forum
Hill Partners, LLC and KLD-HMG, Ltd entities. Glaringly, this
investment appears to be �nanced by Eagle since Maryland UCC
�lings reveal that Eagle has lent money to Forum Hill (below).


Eagle’s Chairman of the Audit Committee, a former area car dealer
named Dudley Dworken, is directly responsible for “minding the
store” and approving the related party transactions at the bank.  But
we were alarmed to learn that after joining the board of Eagle in
1997, Mr. Dworken consented to a permanent injunction with the

SEC in 1998 to settle insider trading allegations (without admitting or
denying wrongdoing).  The allegations centered on his conduct while
on the board of Allegiance Banc Corporation, a different bank that
Mr. Paul was also a Director of (a media pro�le states that Dworken
has been a “close friend” of Paul since the 1980s).


Source: SEC News Digest


Eagle has also made loans to �nance the business ventures of
Dworken and another member of the audit committee, Norman
Pozez.  Pozez is the CEO of a retail toy company, Ridemakerz, that a
Delaware UCC �ling states is �nanced by Eagle.  A Maryland UCC
�ling similarly demonstrates that Eagle is �nancing Dworken’s
Frederick Road, LLC entity which appears to be a real estate venture
of some kind.

We See Enormous Downside Potential in EGBN Shares


Many investors seem to believe that Eagle offers robust growth and
outsized returns with minimal risk. But since the �rst undisclosed
fraud suit was �led, CEO Ronald Paul and his wife have made 19
open market sales to dump over $10 million of stock (list of trades
here).  Prior to this time, Mr. Paul never sold a single share
throughout his entire multi-decade tenure at the company, according
to data from Bloomberg. Four Board Members have also sold stock
in the open market this year.

The fundamental problem is that Paul is selling his stock to investors
that are likely completely unaware of the pervasive undisclosed
activity occurring at the bank.  That’s why we believe it’s imperative
that Mr. Paul release the information that he and the board possess. 
Eagle should immediately disclose:


1. An itemized list with names and principal balances for each
loan to O�cers, Directors, and their family entities including
companies where they hold a �nancial stake.


2. An itemized list of all loans to Eagle borrowers that O�cers,
Directors, or their family entities have obtained a �nancial
interest in along with a detailed explanation of how that
interest was obtained.   This should include the aggregate
balance of loans to real estate developers that insiders have
engaged in joint ventures with.


3. The terms of each and every one of the loans from 1 and 2
including interest rate, loan to value or leverage point, and the
existence of any restructuring or modi�cation.


4. Attestations that these transactions were disclosed to the
Board of Directors, Federal Reserve examiners, and Eagle’s
independent auditors.


The fundamental problem is that insider self-dealing is often
symptomatic of pervasive rot within the institution’s lending and risk
management functions. History demonstrates that bad banks have
been able to conceal the risks lurking in their portfolios during
benign credit cycles, only to have them explode to the surface once
the music stops. With shares trading at a premium valuation of over
2.4x book value, it is our belief that investors simply have yet to
7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value

discount the true nature of Eagle’s activities. We therefore see
signi�cant downside potential in the stock.


All investors are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence


 


 


 


 


Exhibit A:  Forensic Trail of Documents Used to Identify Eagle Loans
to RDP


 


1701 Rhode Island Avenue N.W. Washington DC


RDP’s website highlights the property as being a joint venture
between RDP and Akridge.
7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 25/37


RDPs website states that it is developing that YMCA at 1711 Rhode
Island into an o�ce building that will be renamed 1701 Rhode
Island.  Washington DC deed records show a $63 million loan from
Eagle to 1711 Rhode Island Owner, LLC secured by the YMCA Parcel.
 The loan is signed for by a representative of Alcion Ventures, a
partner of Akridge, but we don’t have enough information to know
the size of RDP’s interest in the development.


1319 South Capitol Street S.W. Washington DC


RDP’s website describes this property as a future mixed-use
development.

7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 26/37


Deed records show that Eagle made a $7.5 million loan in 2015 (later
up-sized to $9.3 million) to �nance the purchase of the vacant
parcel.  The loan was made to an LLC, 1319 Capitol Associates,
managed by Paul’s family trust and signed for by RDP’s COO. The
COO �led a form D for this LLC with the SEC in 2015 which disclosed
it raised $5 million from 5 different investors.  An October 2016
image of the site shows a sign bearing RDP’s logo promising a future
development. Shortly after the purchase, Mr. Paul told the
Washington Business Journal that he was contemplating future
development at the site but “we’re going to hold it for a while, we
have no immediate plans. We believe the market is strong as ever”.

Tysons Center


RDP’s website describes this property as a joint venture with
NVCommercial to produce a 2 million square foot mixed use
development.


Deed records show that Eagle made a $34 million loan in 2014
secured by property at Tysons Center. The loan was made to Tysons
Central LLC and was signed by a representative of NVCommercial. 
We don’t have enough information to know the size of RDP’s interest
in the deal. Also, a series of transactions recorded in 2017 suggest
that at least one of the Tyson’s Center parcels was subsequently
sold to entities owned by other developers.


One Florida Avenue & 8 P Street
7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 28/37


RDP’s website describes this property as a gas station / convenience
store that it plans to redevelop into a 230,000 square foot multi-
family property.


Washington DC Tax Records con�rm that this property is owned by
RDP through an entity named St. Elmo LLC.  Deed records show that
RDP purchased the property in August 2014 for $11.2 Million.


Deed records also show that Eagle made a $10.3 million loan in 2014
to Bethesda St. Elmo, LLC secured by this property.   The loan was
signed by RDP’s COO on behalf of Potomac Investment Trust.

Documents from November 2016 show that Eagle made a separate
$2.2 million loan to �nance Bethesda St. Elmo’s purchase of an
adjacent parcel at 8 P Street.  Our review of the deed records
indicates that St. Elmo purchased the property from a different RDP
entity, 8 P Street NE LLC, which had acquired the property shortly
beforehand with a loan from Eagle.


700 Constitution Avenue
7/10/2019 Eagle Bancorp’s Insider Loan Scheme Exposed - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/egbn/ 30/37


RDP’s website states this property is a joint venture between RDP
and Borger Management to convert a hospital into a multi-family
property.


Our review of deed records suggests that Eagle �rst made loans
related to the property in October 2008. A September 2017 deed
record shows that Eagle made a $35 million loan in September 2017
secured by a ground lease of the property.  The loan was made to an
entity named 700 LLC and signed for by Thomas Borger.   We don’t
have enough information to know the size of RDP’s stake in the deal.

2009 8  Street


RDP’s website states that this property as a planned development of
a nightclub into a multi-family apartment building.  Although not
explicitly stated on RDP’s website, we believe this must be a joint
venture with the Jefferson Apartment Group. The Washington
Business Journal reported in 2016 that the property was owned by
the Jefferson and stated that any development is at least a couple
years away.

Deed records from June 2017 show that Eagle bank expanded its
original $6.9 million loan secured by the property to $14 million.  The
loan is made to a Delaware LLC named 2009 8  Street Apartments
and signed by a representative of Jefferson Apartment Group.  There
is not enough information to know the size of RDP’s stake in the
deal.


Collington Park Industrial Building


This is an Industrial property simultaneously displayed on RDP’s
website as a “Venture Capital Investment” as well as an MRP
website.  Deed records con�rm the existence of a $11.9 Million loan
from Eagle but the size of RDP’s stake in the deal is unknown.

A Delaware UCC �ling shows an Eagle �nancing to 1760 Reston
Investors, LLC, an entity that is registered to RDP’s headquarters
address.  The �ling states that Eagle is secured by the LLC’s interest
