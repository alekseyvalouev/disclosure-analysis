SEABRIDGE GOLD
(AMEX:SA) -WHY THE
MAJORS ARE SAYING ‘NO’
WHILE WALL ST. IS SAYING
‘YES’.


There are now hundreds of junior gold mining
companies throughout the world, doing extensive
drilling. It is really getting challenging to look at
every project.  Best practices for investors are to
stick to companies that have partnerships, earn-ins
and drilling agreements with major mining
companies.


However, there aren't many with zero gold reserves
and a billion dollar market cap.


And then there's Seabridge Gold. (AMEX:SA)


Seabridge claims that its KSM prospect is sitting on
"one of the �ve largest undeveloped gold projects
in the world"…. sound good?  [ 
http://www.seabridgegold.net/projects.php
[http://www.seabridgegold.net/projects.php]   ] In
this report, Citron will explore why no major mining
companies have partnered with them and test the
credibility of their claims.


Seabridge is a junior mining company whose stock
has been jacked up since 2005 on a series of clever
promotions and hype.  In the opinion of Citron it is
all based upon a premise that is fraudulent to US
investors.

While much has been published on Seabridge over
the years, in a series of articles Citron will put
forward the de�nitive piece of research that will
prove what the major companies already know
about Seabridge:  it is a bridge to nowhere.


The Big Kahuna – KSM


Seabridge acquired KSM from Placer Dome for just
hundreds of thousand of dollar in stock in 2001. 
This prospect had been owned and poked by many
of the majors going back to 1961.  Enter Seabridge,
which then enlists the following players, ups its
estimates, pays some promoters and o� to the
races it goes.


Michael Lechner:  The Billion Dollar Man


The resource analysis of the Seabridge Gold's KSM
project is headed by Michael Lechner of Resource
Modeling Inc (RMI) of Tucson Arizona.  It is
important to note that Seabridge has increased
KSM's resource "estimates" by over 1300% during
Lechner's engagement, even though they have
only drilled only 40% of the holes on the project,
which has been poked by many of the majors as
early as 1961.  So who is RMI?  A picture is worth a
1000 words.


The address for Mr. Lechner’s operation on �lings
was 1960 W. Muirhead Loop, Tucson AZ.   We
encourage shareholders to look at the o�ce of RMI
and see where these billion dollar claims are
coming from.

Muirhead-Loop,-Tucson-AZ.---_rb/]


Yes, this is the world headquarters of Resource
Modeling Inc.


When analyzing a potential gold �nd, the feasibility
study is as important as the resource estimate in
determining the economic value of the resource. 
There's lots of gold and other minerals in places
where the cost of extraction simply renders it
uneconomical.  Seabridge's reassuring message to

https://citronresearch.com/seabridge-gold-amexsa-why-the-majors-are-saying-no-while-wall-st-is-saying-yes/ 3/7


investors describes how KSM is located in safe and
predictable Canada, not some foreign country. 
What it doesn't state is that the property is
extremely remote and largely located under a
glacier.  The capital investment needed to extract
any gold from the site is daunting indeed – the
price tag is in the billions.  Extraction would require
them to drill miles-long underground tunnels just to
gain access the site, plus hydroelectric dams and
roads…and that's before establishing the mining
and milling facilities.


The feasibility study for KSM was produced by a
company named Moose Mountain.  There is not
much record of Moose Mountain before 2007, as
they went by their old name:  GR Technical
Services.  GR was involved in one of the largest
feasibility study �ops ever in the gross
underestimate of a notorious project called
Galore Creek.  After shareholder lawsuits and
serious damage to its reputation, GR did the
obvious thing….they changed their name. 


In May of 2007, Novagold partnered with a Teck
Cominco on a potentially huge mine – Galore Creek
— based on work done by GR Technical.  In August
of 07, GR Technical changed its operating name to
Moose Mountain and in November of 07, the new
feasibility study done by the big-business partner
found that GR grossly underestimated costs at
Galore Creek – so much so that the project was
cancelled.  Shares of Novagold tanked — but who
cares?  By then, they were already Moose
Mountain……needless to say Lechner's estimates
were also involved in this debacle.


The possible reason Seabridge has not found a
partners is that the majors are becoming a lot more
skeptical of feasibility studies by juniors and their
one-man shop consultants, as many large projects
have been misrepresented during the recent gold
rush.


Abullah Arik- Is this kosher??


In their most recent o�ering, Seabridge stated that
it was raising money in order to develop their
project at Courageous Lake (easier than going back

to the KSM story).  The study at Courageous Lake
was done according to �lings by “Michael Lechner
and Abdullah Arik who are both independent of
Seabridge.”

SessionID=jhWQjmmKL9Jga2Z&ID=3953926]


But wait …we have never seen Arik work with
Lechner before — only on this project.  So who
does he really work for??  Concurrently in other
SEC �lings we see that Arik’s real employer is
Mintec, where he still works.  Mintec’s CEO is
none other than Fred Ban�eld — a director and a
signi�cant shareholder of Seabridge.  This type of
shenanigan is normally reserved for OTC stocks …
but if you don't get caught, that makes it legal?  The
National Instrument 43-101 is a strict guideline for
how public companies can disclose scienti�c and
technical information about mineral projects on
bourses supervised by the Canadian Securities
Administrators.  NI 43-101 clearly describes
independent quali�ed persons and when they are
required.  Here is the link to the regulations:

The Promotion


Seabridge claims that it is has more gold ownership
per share than any listed company.  This claim is at
the basis of their whole promotion of Seabridge's
stock.  This claim is ILLEGAL.


US Securities law strictly speci�es the rules under
which companies can claim the asset value of in-
the-ground resources Yet, on its website, and
promotional TV advertisements produced for the
company and broadcast on US investors, it has

�aunted the law in the most misleading way
imaginable, without any disclaimer whatsoever.


Seabridge's "proven reserves", the only term legal
to claim value of an in-ground resource to US
investors, is zero.  This is not a technicality!  The
company has never done su�cient work either on
the resource (asset) or feasibility (cost) side to claim
extractable resources with certainty to meet the
legal standard.   


The company has been so blatant in committing
this deception on investors that they even took a
commercial on CNBC (so typical of a stock
promotion) making that misleading and fraudulent
claim.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7UugsDIBNI]


Due to the lack of independent analyst coverage,
Seabridge has been largely dependent on
promotional companies to get stock sold to
investors.  One of their largest promoters has been
Stansberry Investment Research, who has written a
multitude of promotions on Seabridge for the past
4 years.

q=stansberry+research+seabridge&hl=en&sourceid=gd&rlz
[https://www.google.com/search?
q=stansberry+research+seabridge&hl=en&sourceid=gd&rlz


It should be noted that the SEC has sued Porter
Stansberry, and its parent Agora for engaging and
an “ongoing scheme to defraud public investors by
disseminating false information in several internet
newsletters…” 
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18090.htm
[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18090.htm]


Seabridge's promotional claim extends to EVERY
single piece of marketing material put forward by
the company which reiterates that one line so
prevalent that it is the company's tag line “More
Gold Ownership Per Share”.  This line is false and
fraudulent by its very nature.  Ever since people
were selling shares in the Brooklyn Bridge,
securities laws have required companies to
demonstrate that an asset is monetizable to claim

an asset value.  Seabridge's corporate presentation
of itself has gone for years in laughing in the
regulators faces as they claim ownership in
something that is nothing more than an inferred
resource.  CEO Rudi Fronk knows what the
company is doing is wrong as he told Forbes
Magazine in 2007 that the SEC has “forced” the
company to state that they have no knows
reserves.  
http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0813/034.html
[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0813/034.html]


With that, we ask Wall St. and the SEC, ”How many
companies do you know whose corporate slogan is
an illegal claim to investors?”


As of now, no one has “bought” this story except
shareholders as they still don’t have a JV, buyout, or
any respectable Wall St. coverage.


Is the gig �nally up?


Seabridge CEO Rudi Fronk and the company's
mouthpieces have for years talked about a
partnership or buyout.  It goes back to as far as
2006 when gold was in the $600s per ounce and
Agora touted Seabridge in June of 2006:


“It plans to partner with a major mining �rm, who
will take the �nancial risk. Seabridge Gold couldn’t
identify who that partner is, but it said it has
con�dentiality agreements with four majors for this
project (sic) The major mining �rms wouldn’t be
interested unless this is potentially a major gold
mine.”

gold.asp
[http://www.dailywealth.com/archive/2006/jun/seabridge-
gold.asp]


Fronk also told Bloomberg in 2008 that he seeks a
sale or a partnership with another gold company.

And in a last ditch e�ort before he had to go to the
street for more money, Fronk begs in

We are now in 2010 — and still no partner or
buyout.  This leads us to believe that the majors
think the same thing as Citron — that the resource
at KSM is uneconomical regardless of what the
claims company might tell shareholders.  Please,
there is no reason for the company  or any of their
mouth pieces to go into the various media outlets
and defend the company….all they have to do is get
a partner….we won’t be holding our breaths.


We'll have more to say about this story at is
unfolds.
