China Sky Selected for IBD List Just Before $2
Warrant Expiration


Posted on July 27, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) appeared on the


Investor’s Business Daily IBD-100 list this week, the publication’s list


of high-performing “growth” stocks. It is the fourth time this year


the stock has appeared on the list. In previous cases, CSKI was


removed from the list one week after appearing on it. A report


previously issued by asensio.com commented on CSKI’s on-again,


off-again status with the IBD list. Click here to read the report.


This re-appearance of China Sky on the IBD list happens to coincide


with an expiration of warrants issued by the company in


connection with its reverse merger, allowing for the purchase of


CSKI shares at $2.00 per share. China Sky’s 2008 Form 10-K states,


“the Company agreed to grant warrants to advisors for the services


they already performed for the reverse merger in July 2006,


entitling them to purchase up to 500,000 shares on or before July 31,


2009, at a price of $2.00 per share.” The 10-K also states, ‘All of these


warrants are also exercisable on a “cashless” basis under certain


circumstances.’


China Sky’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2009,


discloses that warrants for 150,000 shares at an exercise price of


$2.00 per share remained outstanding at the end of the first


quarter. The profit from the ‘cashless’ exercise of those remaining


warrants would be about $2 million at today’s CSKI share price.


Last week, CSKI shares showed very irregular trading activity,


which again caused IBD to add it to its list. In particular, on


Tuesday, July 21st, CSKI shares traded up 6% in the first fifteen


minutes of the trading day on no news.


If history is any guide, CSKI’s place on the IBD list will not last more


than a week. It is also likely fair to predict that the $2 warrants will
