Athenex – Rehash  
Athenex recycle press re leases to pump investors . Viceroy release 


details of further con flicts with Athenex CROs. 


October 28, 2019 – This report will continue to touch on major Athenex conflict of interest issues. 


▪ In another slap to the face for invetors, Athenex, instead of addressing any of the major issues Viceroy have 


put forward, have chosen to instead re-publish a press release from March 4, 2019, marketing the results 


of topical medication with their project partner, Almirall. 


▪ In case the connections to fraud were not already apparent, Almirall has recently settled both a $3.5m 


Department of Justice and $3.1m California Department of Insurance claims relating to kickbacks and 


bribery of physicians for the promotion of their product. Athenex aim to use Almirall for their vast sales 


network. 


▪ Viceroy today release data showing PharmaEssentia, Athenex CRO, is also a related party. To recap, all three 


major Athenex CROs have an interest in the approval and ongoing success of the products they are 


conducting the trials for, as we have previously reported on CIDAL and ZenRx. 


▪ Athenex CEO Johnson Yiu Nam Lau is a busy man, moonlighting at yet another anti-cancer company, 


Taiwanese comapny Taivex Therapeutics. Investors should be asking what Athenex’s Chief Executive 


Officer is doing at another anti-cancer biotechnology company, especially if he finds the time to be credited 


in numerous academic papers sponsored by that company, and what possible conflicts of interest may have 


arisen. 





We conclude that Athenex exists to abuse capital markets and enrich its management through related party 


transactions and licensing deals, rather than bring revolutionary drugs into the market.   


Viceroy value ATNX stock at US$2.83 – a 71% downside –the sum of its tangible book value and 1x 


valuation on its licensing & consulting revenue streams, for the year ending June 30, 2019. With ATNX’s 


questionable license acquisitions and management’s precedent for overstated top line figures in previous 


ventures: this is optimistic. 





Viceroy remain short Athenex.

1. Athenex moves into recycling 
On October 28, 2019 Athenex released a press release titled: “Athenex Announces Progress Update from Partner 


Almirall on Tirbanibulin Ointment”1 


 
Figure XX Athenex Announces Progress Update from Partner Almirall on Tirbanibulin Ointment 


This is a complete rehash of a release dated March 4, 2019 relating to a March 2, 2019 presentation2. There is 


no new information about the clinical trial, nor have new results come to light. The only new content on this 


press release is the quote by Athenex Chief Medical Officer Rudolf Kwan who is either 7 months late to the party, 


or putting on a brave face. 


We must question the motives of rehashing a positive press release in the context of Viceroy’s publication of its 


research into Athenex. As with Ebix, we believe this type of misleading announcements constitutes stock 


promotion and serves to stray away from addressing any major issues we have highlighted. 


In their defense, it may be difficult to refute allegations of related party transactions given the fact management 


have continuously disclosed that the company frequently engages in transactions that are not at arms’-length. 


 
Figure XX Extract – ATNX 10Q – Q2 2019 


It will be curious to see Athenex’s auditors first ever internal control attestation report at the end of 2019, as 


the company falls from exemption under emerging growth company. 


 
Figure XX Extract – ATNX 10Q – Q2 2019 


In case the connections to fraud were not already apparent, Almirall has recently settled a $3.5m Department 


of Justice and $3.1m California Department of Insurance claims relating to kickbacks and bribery of physicians 


for the promotion of their product. Athenex aim to use Almirall for their vast sales network3.

2. Taivex 
Athenex CEO Johnson Yiu Nam Lau is a busy man: especially given he is moonlighting at yet another anti-cancer 


company, Taiwanese comapny Taivex Therapeutics (泰緯生命科技股份有限公司). Taivex’s management 
page states it’s original investor be Taivex, LLC, a company launched by Lau in 2010. 





Figure XX Taivex.com History4 


Taivex acquired all its anticancer patents during Lau’s tenure at Athenex, raising questions as to why he didn’t 


simply bring them into the Athenex umbrella5. Of course, he could have been planning to resell them to the 


company for a profit, if history is any guide.  


Taivex is still active, in April 17, 2019 Taiwan’s National Health Research Institutes entered into a licensing 


agreement for DBPR216, an anti-cancer developmental drug candidate6. We are unable to ascertain if this 


undisclosed activity is in breach of Lau’s employment agreement without more information on DBPR216 and 


Taivex’s other formulations.  





We are unable to ascertain if this undisclosed activity is in breach of Lau’s employment agreement without more 


information on DBPR216 and Taivex’s other formulations. 


Investors should be asking what Athenex’s Chief Executive Officer is doing at another anti-cancer biotechnology 


company, especially if he finds the time to be credited in numerous academic papers sponsored by that 


company. 


3. PharmaEssentia 
Our previous research has shown how Athenex’s Contract Research Organisations (CROs) ZenRx and CIDAL are 


conflicted with incentives to produce favorable clinical trial results. Another CRO is similarly conflicted, 


Taiwanese operator PharmaEssentia7 (TWSE:6446). PharmaEssentia is conducting clincal trials for several of 


Athenex’s products including Oraxol for breast cancer, Oraxol + Ramucirumab for Gastric Cancer and KX-01 for 


psoriasis.  


There are several ties between PharmaEssentia and Athenex 


• Athenex owns a 68,000 share equity stake in PharmaEssentia worth ~US$250,000 likely received as part 


of certain regulatory and milestone payments 


• Athenex receives consulting and cost-sharing funds from PharmaEssentia (include relevant amount) 


• PharmaEssentia holds the exclusive license for development and commercialization of Oraxol and 


Oratecan in Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore.

• PharmaEssentia holds the exclusive license for KX-01 and KX-02 for treating psoriasis and other non-


malignant skin conditions in China, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. 


To recap, all three major Athenex CROs have an interest in the approval and ongoing success of the products 


they are conducting the trials for. We are currently investigating Athenex’s clinical trial relationships and will 


keep the market informed of our research as and when it becomes relevant. 


However even the CRO’s appear to be getting screwed by the many stumbling blocks in Oraxol’s development. 


We previously discussed how Hanmi Pharmeceutical, after a decade of almost no progress on the Orascovery 


platform, handballed it to Athenex for US$7.5m upfront. It appears like Athenex is now doing the same to its 


Contract Research Organisation, PharmaEssentia. 


 
Figure XX PharmaEssentia presentation8 


PharmaEssentia originally had grand plans for Oraxol: PharmaEssentia CEO Ko-Chung Lin believed that Oraxol, 


Oratecan and KX-01 would be available for sale “within two or three years”.

Annexure A 


We believe it is fitting that re reiterate our previous summaries, and stand behind our work in its entirety, given 


management have decided not to address our data in specifics: 


Viceroy value ATNX stock at US$2.83 – a 71% downside –the sum of its tangible book value and 1x valuation 


on its licensing & consulting revenue streams, for the year ending June 30, 2019. With ATNX’s questionable 


license acquisitions and management’s precedent for overstated top line figures in previous ventures: this is 
optimistic. 


Management – A Company of Rogues 


▪ Several members of Athenex’s management team have a history of what appears to be either gross 


incompetence in fiduciary duties or clever mismanagement in infamous frauds internationally, 


collectively resulting in billions of dollars of write-offs including Sino Forest and Suntech.  


▪ ATNX directors have also acted as sellers and drop-shippers to rip off Athenex shareholders with margin-


stealing exercises through their investment entity: Avalon Global. Cash has consistently exited the 


business via similar related party deals.  


▪ Breaches in corporate governance principles: Athenex directors screwed investors by purchasing CDE for 


themselves and flipping it to Athenex for a 262% profit in 6 weeks. The company failed to report the 


circumstances of the transaction in any meaningful way. 


▪ In a separate instance, Directors pocketed a 3,300% profit by flipping an “anti-cancer mechanism” license 


to Athenex for US$5m, for which they paid just US$150,000 just 6 months earlier.  


▪ Directors award themselves millions of dollars’ worth of stock at no cost through the issuance of 


promissory notes that are cancelled on a time-vested basis.  


▪ Athenex directors have an uncanny ability to avoid any disclosure or reference to their involvement in 


historical fraud or related party deals. It's Viceroy's view that if investors were aware, they would not 


have bought $ATNX in the first place.    


▪ Athenex’s CFO J. Nick Riehle left unexpectedly for a “planned” retirement, just 10 months after joining the 


company but is now seeking work as a consultant. 


▪ Our investigations have found ties between Polymed and its management team’s ties to the largest taxol 


smuggling ring in history Hande Yunnan, resulting in 50 arrests and 32 imprisonments. Major perpetrators 


and shareholders of this scheme now work for Athenex.   


▪ Polymed appears to continue sourcing its taxol from Hande Yunnan, despite the fact that our investigations 


show Hande Yunnan no longer produce taxol. 


▪ Further inspection of Polymed’s management show inconsistencies in prior executive roles, specifically of 


William Zuo. Zuo was also the US liaison of bringing smuggled taxol to the USA. 


▪ A deep dive into Chinese regulatory notes from the Ministry of Emergency Management, coupled with 


Polymed’s history of objectionable site inspections by Chinese regulators and the FDA, lead us to believe 


that Polymed’s manufacturing facility suspension was anything but voluntary. In any event, Athenex’s 


manufacturing facility does not manufacture anything. 


▪ Viceroy dismantles photoshopped Polymed advertisements for its facilities and expose chemical 


manufacturing facilities we believe are non-existent or outsourced.

Oraxol – Flagship or Shipwreck? 


Athenex has been reliant on the marketed prospect of Oraxol in order to obtain access to capital, having 


received going concern qualifications from Deloitte since 2016 and current yearly cash-burn rates of ~$100m. 


The company has raised ~US$360m in equity and US$80m in debt since 2017. Even if R&D costs are removed 


from the equation, Athenex’s licensing and consulting segments are operationally loss-making.  


▪ After consultation with industry specialists and oncologists, Viceroy believes Athenex’s flagship paclitaxel 


drug, Oraxol, cannot compete with the current standard of care available in the USA.   


▪ Oraxol’s clinical trial’s control dosing regimen of IV paclitaxel as monotherapy is an outdated treatment 


schedule dating from the 1990’s.  


▪ Oraxol’s marketed quality of life improvements are redundant. Patients will still require IV /treatment 


post-treatment, alongside complications from oral treatment.  


▪ Oraxol’s side effects appear more severe than those of the current US standard of care, Abraxane, and may 


require hospitalization due to their life-threatening nature. Reported adverse effects grade 4 neutropenia, 


grade 3 vomiting and unspecified GI complications were more severe than IV paclitaxel intake.  


▪ None of Oraxol’s clinical trials have included a US patient component. While the FDA does allow data 


overseas trials, these results are treated with much higher scrutiny. Viceroy believe ATNX studies are being 


conducted in South America due to a lower local standard of care: US patients could not be enticed to trial 


a drug against an outdated active control regimen.   


▪ Athenex’s Orascovery program – key to its marketed value proposition – was purchased for just US$7.5m 


upfront in 2011 after its previous owner experienced decade-long development delays with little headway 


into development. The Orascovery platform is busted.  


▪ Through consultation with experts, we believe Athenex’s pursuit of the 505b(2) pathway for Oraxol will be 


hampered by the fact that its paclitaxel delivery mechanism, HM30181A, has never been approved by the 


FDA. The FDA may require Athenex to pursue a further NDA for HM30181A. 


▪ Viceroy have identified what we believe to be Intellectual Property Theft from UK company Immunocore.  


XLifeSc’s flagship technology (in which ATNX put $35m upfront) may already be owned by GSK and further 


along the development pipeline: GSK’s solution is currently undergoing phase 2 trials in the US. 


Athenex’s operational and R&D cash-burn rate is over US$100m a year – the company would be lucky to survive 


until HY 2020 without needing a further cash injection from investors. Even if Athenex scrapped its R&D 


completely, the company’s revenue streams operate at a substantial loss. 


Accordingly, we believe our valuation of $2.83 is optimistic, and will be realized in the short term. We do not 


see a future for the company in its current state.
