BANC: Extensive Ties To
Notorious Fraudster Jason
Galanis Make Shares Un-
Investible


OCTOBER 18, 2016 | BANC


“Despite the experience of recent
years, corporate rogues continue
to �nd their way to positions of
power at the top companies.
Thousands of people every year
are fooled into investing in
companies that turn out to be
dishonest, unethical, or even
downright criminal.”

Background


In 2010, COR Capital (“COR“), an obscure investment �rm most
visibly known for its associations with Pink-Sheet stocks, led the
recapitalization of a Los Angeles based regional bank named First
Pactrust (“FPB”). In 2012, Steven Sugarman, COR’s Managing
Member, became the CEO of the bank and began a
“transformational” growth strategy fueled by a combination of
(oftentimes related party) acquisitions and loan growth.


Growing its balance sheet by a factor of 10x and now having crossed
the critical $10 Billion asset threshold, the renamed Banc of
California (NYSE:BANC) has touted itself as a “community
reinvestment” lender. The bank has cultivated relationships with
politicians and celebrities to project an air of success and credibility
as California’s Bank. Investors have increasingly adopted these
promotional narratives and BANC’s shares had doubled over the past
year.


The PR effort hit new highs in August when BANC agreed to pay
$100 million, roughly 10% of its market cap, for soccer stadium
naming rights to the LA Football Club (which just happens to be part-

owned by Steven’s brother Jason Sugarman and Jason’s father-in-
law Peter Guber).


With our interest piqued by yet another related party transaction, we
conducted exhaustive due diligence into BANC’s leadership team,
collecting tens of thousands of pages of publicly-available state,
federal, and international documents. Taken together, these form to
assemble one of the most ominous fact patterns we have ever seen.


Our research establishes that BANC’s senior-most o�cers and
board members have a broad mosaic of extensive and indisputable
ties to Jason Galanis. We believe this introduces a signi�cant un-
discounted risk that notorious criminals gained control over the $10
Billion taxpayer guaranteed Banc of California.


Jason Galanis and his infamous father, John Galanis, have a long
history of secretly gaining control of banks and public companies
via front men, looting assets, and leaving unsuspecting investors
and taxpayers with hundreds of millions in losses. The mere
presence of a bank leadership team associated with Galanis should
send diligent investors running for the hills.


We see striking similarities between BANC and Gerova Financial, a
$1 Billion NYSE listed �nancial institution that collapsed on the
revelation of Galanis’ secret control. Like BANC, Gerova’s executives
had signi�cant ties to Galanis and touted their community
reinvestment efforts with politicians to establish credibility. In the
end, the promotion was a diversion from a giant fraud that left
investors with devastating losses.


As a result, we believe Banc Of California is simply un-investible.


A summary of key research conclusions we are releasing in this
report include:


Jason Galanis Controlled COR, BANC’s Founding
Shareholder. SEC documents detail how Galanis gained
control of COR portfolio companies to orchestrate the Tribal
Bonds Ponzi Scheme. Galanis laid claim to Banc of California
to display his �nancial wherewithal and even managed the

scheme out of an o�ce in the same building as BANC’s
headquarters.


An Off-Balance Sheet Lender Controlled By BANC’s Senior-
Most O�cers Financed Galanis. Steven Sugarman holds an
undisclosed interest in Camden Capital, an off-balance sheet
lender controlled by BANC’s Vice Chairman, Jeffrey Seabold.
Camden was used to �nance Galanis amidst the recent Tribal
Bond Scheme and engaged in transactions with Galanis
during the Gerova Financial fraud.


BANC’s Lead “Independent” Director Has Strong Ties To
Galanis. BANC’s Lead “Independent” Director, Chad
Brownstein, has strong ties to Jason Galanis, his indicted
associates, and COR Capital. Mr. Brownstein also accepted
an undisclosed loan from Camden that is secured by his Los
Angeles Mansion but appears to �nance his outside
business ventures.


We See Similarities Between BANC And Galanis’ Gerova
Financial fraud. In wrapping BANC in the �ag of “community
reinvestment”, Steven Sugarman has recycled a nearly
identical narrative to what Galanis propagated at Gerova
Financial. Further parallels include a leadership team and
founding shareholder with undisclosed ties to Galanis, a bevy
of suspect related party transactions, and the use of opaque
assets as regulatory capital.


Note: Neither Banc Of California or its executives have been named in
any government indictments.

Steven Sugarman’s COR And Jason Galanis Control The Same
Offshore Insurance Company


Seasoned readers will likely recall that John Galanis was one of the
most notorious �nancial criminals of the 1970s and 1980s. Before
being served with a 58-count RICO indictment in 1987, Galanis
defrauded investors out of hundreds of millions through a variety of

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-extensive-ties-notorious-fraudster-jason-galanis-make-shares-un-investible/ 5/29


stock scams, frauds, and ponzi schemes that led to the seizure of at
least four banks. Speci�c historical examples include:


A fraudulent tax shelter scheme orchestrated by gaining
control of two banks, bribing o�cials of another and gaining
control of three California mutual funds. Rudolph Giuliani,
called this “one of the largest white-collar crimes the FBI has
ever had.”


The looting of Chase Bank in the early 80s as part of an
“inside job” in which a series of fraudulent loans were made
to Galanis companies.


Charges brought by Canadian authorities in 1973 that
allegedly involved fraudulent investment securities that were
purchased by a Montreal Bank that Galanis indirectly
controlled through his control of the bank’s largest
shareholder.


John has reportedly had a “heavy if not controlling in�uence” over his
son, Jason Galanis, who became known in the early 2000s as“Porn’s
New King” and subsequently settled SEC accounting fraud charges
related to Penthouse’s bankruptcy.


In September 2015, father and son were charged by both the SEC
and Department of Justice (having since pled guilty) for their role in
secretly gaining control of Gerova Financial (OTC:GVFG), a Bermuda-
based reinsurer. This now infamous heist of what was then a nearly
$1 Billion NYSE listed company saw its stock decline 95% after a
short seller’s reportexposed Gerova’s ties to Jason Galanis.


In May of 2016, Jason & John Galanis, while out on bail for the
Gerova fraud, were again charged by the SEC and Department of
Justice along with �ve associates for a complex ponzi-scheme. The
alleged fraud involved sham tribal bond placements, the proceeds of
which were transferred into shell corporations and used to purchase
luxuries and pay legal expenses.


Central to the scheme was the Valor Group (“Valor”), also a large
Bermuda-based insurance holding company that, according to the
SEC, “was controlled by Jason Galanis.” Valor was used to �nance

the acquisition of asset managers who, in turn, purchased the
fraudulent tribal bonds on behalf of their clients.


Source: SEC Complaint


Two troubling ties to Steven Sugarman, who remains the Managing
Member of COR Capital, immediately emerged:


Hugh Dunkerley, a former COR-executive, was indicted along
with Galanis as being a key alleged player in the fraud. Mr.
Dunkerley’s involvement in the scheme dates back to 2013,
when he incorporated Valor while still at COR.


Jason Sugarman, is the Founder, Chairman & CEO of
Valor(according to both an SEC �ling and an interview).
During the same period, Jason served as a paid BANC
consultant and continues to be described as an advisor.
(Note: Jason Sugarman was not named in the complaint or
accused of wrongdoing.)


Given these associations, the Tribal Bond Scheme was brie�y
mentioned in Bloomberg’s recent pro�le of BANC’s related party
dealings. The article reported that:


Steven Sugarman said his company had no role, and there’s no direct
link between Galanis and the bank or its CEO.


Mr. Sugarman’s assertion is directly contradicted by SEC obtained
documents and mysteriously deleted COR websites,all of which
indicate that COR owns Valor.


1) The sworn declaration of an SEC enforcement attorney (below)
states that Valor’s primary insurance subsidiary (Wealth-Assurance
AG) and Burnham Financial (the placement agent for the Tribal

included under COR’s umbrella are BANC, CS Financial (a 2013 BANC
acquisition), Valor’s Wealth-Assurance and Burnham.

COR Capital’s website (www.corfunds.com) previously included
executive biographies of Steven Sugarman and Hugh Dunkerly. This
website has also been completely deleted.


Experience has taught us that when websites start being erased, it’s
time to start asking serious questions.


The critical question for BANC shareholders is how Jason Galanis
could control an offshore insurance company that was simultaneously
owned by COR Capital, an entity ostensibly led by Steven Sugarman?

We believe Jason Galanis Controlled COR.


Our belief is directly supported by the aforementioned SEC
enforcement attorney’s declaration (below) which states it was
“understood that Galanis was associated with COR Capital.


Source: Case 1:15-cv-09764


In a related court transcript (below), the SEC names a “host of other
companies… [that are] part of the COR Group” and that “all of these
entities…seem to be controlled by [sic] Jason Galanis.”


Source: Case 1:15-cv-09764. Note: the above document mis-transcribed
Jason Galanis as “Chase and Gollanis”


The same SEC declaration also describes how Galanis installed
o�cers at COR portfolio companies to conceal his control. Michelle
Morton, an indicted Galanis associate who was put in charge of the
asset managers “primary contact with any of the Galanis-related

companies was always Jason Galanis” but “other individuals were
presented to her as o�cers of the companies.”


Galanis even used Banc of California to portray his �nancial
wherewithal. SEC investigators obtained an email from Galanis that
attached a document titled “Introduction to COR Capital” that was
used to “demonstrate who [the] �nancial sponsors are.” BANC of
California was featured as the marquee name amongst COR
companies claimed by Galanis.

SEC pursuant to case 1:15-cv-09764.


But most shocking is that Jason Galanis and Hugh Dunkerley
orchestrated the Tribal Bond Scheme out of a Burnham o�celocated
in the same building as Banc of California’s corporate headquarters.

Agreement. Publicly �led by the SEC pursuant to case 1:15-cv-09764.


Galanis’ demonstrated control over COR’s portfolio companies
combined with his physical presence at BANC’s headquarters
building, introduces the material risk that Galanis also gained control
of Banc of California. This risk is ampli�ed by the trail of indisputable
ties between BANC’s senior-most o�cers and Jason Galanis.


An Off-Balance Sheet Lender Controlled By BANC’s Senior-Most
O�cers Financed Galanis.


In May 2013, BANC acquired an option to purchase a mortgage
lender, CS Financial (“CS”), from then Board Member, Jeffrey
Seabold. As part of the deal, Mr. Seabold stepped down from the
board to become BANC’s Chief Lending O�cer (and was
subsequently promoted to Vice Chairman). In 2014, BANC exercised
the option to acquire CS for $10 Million.


Two former a�liates of CS, Camden Capital Partners (“Camden”)
and Camden Escrow, were not acquired by BANC. In fact, Mr.
Seabold’sinitial employment agreement speci�cally carved out his
ability to continue to direct these outside companies but restricted
him from serving as a loan o�cer (curiously, this restriction was
lifted in Mr. Seabold’s 2015 amended agreement).


We found that Steven Sugarman holds an undisclosed interest in
Camden Capital and its managed real estate entity, Camden Real
Estate Opportunity Fund I, LLC. A May 2015 reconveyance document
obtained from the L.A. County Deed Records, signed by Jason
Sugarman and Jeffrey Seabold, lists JAS Partners I, LLC as a
managing member of Camden.

Camden has been actively transacting with employees and insiders,
including at least one independent board member. For example,
Camden made a complex series of loans to one of BANC’s top
mortgage producers to �nance this expensive Beverly Hills home.


The crucial fact is that Steven Sugarman and Jeffrey Seabold are
using an off-balance sheet entity (Camden) to make loans to
insiders.


But it gets far worse.


In June 2015, deed records show that Camden made a loan to Jason
Galanis in the midst of the alleged Tribal Bond Scheme. The loan
(below) was secured by Galanis’ Beverly Hills mansion and was
made directly to his Thorsdale Fiduciary and Guaranty Company.

According to the SEC, Thorsdale was used as Galanis’ “piggy bank”
to spend ill-gotten proceeds on items such as Prada & Gucci gear. In
a post-indictment court transcript, John Galanis states that he
received funds from Thorsdale in 2015 (case 1:15-cr-00643
Document 153).


An FBI agent attests that Galanis also used Thorsdale to transfer ill-
gotten funds directly into the Valor Group to �nance an acquisition:

The facts are irrefutable: BANC’s senior-most o�cers �nanced the
Galanis’ and the entity used as a centerpiece of the Tribal Bonds
Fraud.


In addition, the Justice Department’s complaint describes how
allegedly ill-gotten Tribal Bond proceeds were transferred. In an
email supplied by the FBI, Bevan Cooney, Galanis’ “best friend of 23
years”, states that a large transfer “went out to Camden Escrow for
the down payment for the 1920 bel air purchase”:

According to his current Bloomberg pro�le as well as corporate
record websites, Mr. Seabold remains the President of Camden
Escrow.


Sugarman and Seabold also used Camden to engage in transactions
with Galanis-controlled entities during the Gerova fraud.


Galanis Transferred Gerova Real Estate Assets To Camden


One of the key alleged facets of the Gerova fraud, which is still
subject to civil litigation, was that Galanis and his associates
stripped tens of millions in real estate assets from the Stillwater
Funds. Galanis allegedly used Gerova and a related entity, Net Five,
to enrich himself and insiders by transferring and diverting the
assets without consideration.


Public records indisputably con�rm that Galanis’ Net Five transferred
the Miami St. Augustine Hotel to Camden. According to the Stillwater
receiver, Camden paid just $400k for a property that was appraised
for $6.4 Million.


Source: Miami-Dade County Recorder’s O�ce


The Stillwater receiver also alleged that Galanis diverted Stillwater’s
$18.3 million note on the Pali House Hotel in West Hollywood, CA but
said, “It is unclear what happened to this loan interest.” We
discovered that Galanis acquired an overt �nancial interest in the
Pali-House Hotel (through his River Ranch Assets, LLC).

Prior to that, an SEC �led document reveals that a Gerova a�liate
transferred the Pali-House loan interest to BANC’s senior-most
o�cers (through Camden). Camden subsequently transferred it to
NORe Capital (below), a British Virgin Islands LLC. NORe’s Tortola
address (which is listed in the Panama Papers), matches that of two
Galanis-controlled entities (NatProv Holdings and Allius Ltd.) as well
as that of Valor.

In a transaction that appears to have monetized the note and sent
millions offshore, NORe exchanged the Pali-House note for $19
million in shares of a now-defunct penny stock named Inspired
Builders (OTCPK:ISRB). Inspired Builders was registered to COR
Capital’s address and was formerly managed by Carlos Salas, the
President ofCOR Clearing (a clearinghouse owned by COR).


Salas’ involvement in Inspired Builders, in our opinion, is revealing.
COR Clearing was �ned $1 million by FINRA for Anti-Money
Laundering (“AML”) violations related to OTC securities that occurred
during the same time period as these transactions. In fact, a COR

behavior” towards) alleged that the clearing operations were being
used to “facilitate material or signi�cant money laundering
activities.” (Note: the case was settled in February, 2016. COR,
Steven Sugarman, and Carlos Salas denied the whistleblower’s
accusations. Case Number: 8:12-cv-00238.)


That is why we think shareholders should be dismayed to discover
that BANC has failed to disclose its recent hiring of none other than
COR Clearing’s Carlos Salas in a “Consulting Role as Chief of Staff”
to “recommend governance, operational and process improvement.”
The fact that BANC would task the former head of a penny stock that
engaged in transactions with both Camden and Galanis-controlled
entities with operational “improvement” is farcical.


Importantly, the Camden transactions during both the Tribal Bond
Scheme and Gerova fraud con�rm the long-standing ties between
BANC executives and Galanis. In light of the Galanis’ history of
concealing control of �nancial institutions behind undisclosed
associates, we believe the indisputable ties between BANC’s senior-
most o�cers and Galanis increase the material probability that
Galanis gained control of Banc of California.


Our concerns are further increased by the board’s undisclosed ties to
Galanis and substantial con�icts of interest.


BANC’s Lead “Independent” Director Has Strong Ties To Jason
Galanis


One of BANC’s largest investors, PL Capital, and its principal, Richard
Lashley, have thoroughly detailed BANC’s governance and board
independence issues in a series of 13D �lings (here, here, here). The
�rm has implored BANC’s Lead “Independent” Director, Chad
Brownstein, to enact governance improvements. In return, BANC has
sent a subpoena to Mr. Lashley as part of a bizarre defamation case
and hired a “special counsel” to send (in our opinion) a threatening
letter to PL Capital.


Our research indicates that Mr. Brownstein has strong ties to Galanis
and is actually participating in the very activities he is responsible to
independently oversee.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-extensive-ties-notorious-fraudster-jason-galanis-make-shares-un-investible/ 18/29


To start with, Mr. Brownstein has received an undisclosed loan from
BANC’s senior-most o�cers via Camden (below). The 2013
transaction, secured by Mr. Brownstein’s Los Angeles mansion,
appears to �nance his outside business ventures (as indicated by the
address of his trust, which differs from that of other deed records).
This loan may very well be disqualifying for Mr. Brownstein as NYSE
independence standards extend to outside dealings between
management and the board.


Source: L.A. County Deed Records.


Most shockingly, however, are Mr. Brownstein’s ties to Jason Galanis
and his indicted associates. Mr. Brownstein Co-Founded and was
Vice-Chairman of Prospect Global (NASDAQ:PGRX). In it’s Gerova
Fraud complaint, the SEC plainly states that Jason Galanis
transferred ill-gotten proceeds to ” Prospect Global Resources, Inc.,”
which it de�nes as a company that Galanis “owned, controlled, or
was associated with.”

Source: SEC Complaint.


In fact, we found that Mr. Brownstein (through an entity he controlled
named Quincy Prelude, LLC) was one of only four shareholders of
Prospect’s 2011 reverse merger entity along withJason Galanis’ wife,
Monet Berger, and Galanis’ now-indicted best friend, Bevan Cooney.
Devon Archer, also recently indicted as an alleged Galanis Tribal
Bonds associate, became Prospect’s Audit-Chair (pictured with Mr.
Brownstein below).


Following the reverse merger, COR engaged in a variety of complex
transactions with Prospect and, at one point, owned 9% of the
company. In a 2011 agreement signed by Steven Sugarman, COR
was awarded additional shares in exchange for becoming Prospect’s
paid IR Consultant and to “establish an image for the company in the
�nancial marketplace.” Even after becoming CEO of BANC, Steven
Sugarman publicly promoted Prospect Global to investors unaware
of Galanis’ involvement, and was quoted in 2013 as touting that:


“We think Prospect Global is the best potash investment
opportunity in North America”

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-extensive-ties-notorious-fraudster-jason-galanis-make-shares-un-investible/ 20/29


We note that shares of Prospect Global are now essentially
worthless, leaving investors who listened to Mr. Sugarman with
massive losses.


The bottom line is that BANC’s Lead Director, who has approved a
number of large related party acquisitions under the guise of
independence, has substantial con�icts of interest and strong ties to
Jason Galanis, his indicted associates, and COR Capital.


We also have concerns about the independence and quali�cations of
each of the other Independent Directors (below). It is self-evident, at
least in our view, that the board cannot be trusted to protect
taxpayers, let alone investors.

We See Similarities Between BANC and The Gerova Financial Fraud


The last time Galanis gained control of a $1 Billion �nancial
institution was during the Gerova Financial fraud. Gerova Financial
was an offshore insurance company that Jason and John Galanis
originally capitalized through secretly controlled entities. Galanis
then installed associates as executives and used Gerova to embark
on a series of related party transactions designed to enrich insiders.
Gerova’s balance sheet was riddled with illiquid holdings of asset
backed loans and hedge fund portfolios that, in turn, were used for
regulatory capital.

The giant fraud unraveled after Galanis’ involvement in Gerova was
exposed in a January, 2011 short report and the stock dropped 95%
before being halted by the NYSE.


We see striking similarities between BANC and Gerova:


Undisclosed Ties To Galanis.


Our research has �rmly established that BANC’s CEO, Vice-Chairman,
Lead Independent Director, and Founding Shareholder all have
extensive undisclosed ties to Jason Galanis. The fact that Gerova
entities even transferred real estate assets to BANC executives
(through Camden) makes the similarities particularly acute.


Shared Promotional Narratives and Associations With Politicians.


In wrapping BANC in the �ag of “community reinvestment,” Steven
Sugarman has recycled a nearly identical narrative to what Galanis
propogated at Gerova Financial.


In the below email exchange (provided below and publicly �led as
part of litigation), a Gerova-a�liated executive explains to Galanis
that they need to “get support at Mayoral and Councilman level” and
states “we need to pitch that we are there to help build and
revitalize communities and neighborhoods…this should be a great
platform for some councilman to look really good in the community.”

Galanis discusses political contacts and the executive goes on to tell
Galanis that,


While we don’t know which Sugarman is being referenced, Steven
Sugarman has followed a similar playbook by closely associating
Banc of California with a variety of high pro�le politicians.


Source: Case 1:03-cr-00131


In a recently �led letter to employees (which used the word
“community” in 25 seperate instances), Steven Sugarman touts
BANC’s Community Development Committee, which has the support
of former LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa:


Jay, when we are with Sugarman, we need to get next to
his Pal from Ohio.

A term sheet sent by Galanis for the purchase of asset managers as
part of the Tribal Bond Scheme (below and publicly �led by the SEC),
stated that he would: “introduce suitable candidates to request to
serve on the Board of Advisors, including an introduction to the
former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and to Mr. Eric
Holoman”. Galanis’ document speci�cally highlighted Mayor
Villaraigosa’s status as a “senior advisor to Steve Sugarman and the
Banc of California”.


Source: Case 1:15-cv-09764


(Note: We do not mean to imply or allege any wrongdoing on the part
of Mayor Villaraigosa or Mr. Holoman.)


Large Holdings Of Opaque Assets For Regulatory Capital


BANC’s securities portfolio has grown by nearly $2 Billion since the
end of 2014 and now exceeds 25% of assets. The portfolio includes
$1.3 Billion worth of level 2 collateralized loan obligations
(alternatively described as “structured products” in call reports) that
have been subject to only sparse disclosure. This leaves BANC
investors holding a portfolio of non-transparent securities that far
exceeds the bank’s tangible equity.


BANC has also expanded into insurance backed lending and
insurance premium �nance (�rst referenced in its 2013 10-K). BANC
has indicated that it is providing credit facilities to hedge funds
backed by life insurance policies as well as other unspeci�ed assets.


“Mayor Villaraigosa also joined with our directors – led
by Eric Holoman and Chad Brownstein – to form a
Community Development Committee of our Board to
engage with community groups”

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/banc-extensive-ties-notorious-fraudster-jason-galanis-make-shares-un-investible/ 25/29


In light of the Galanis’ history of insurance fraud and Sugarman’s ties
to Valor, BANC’s foray into the world of insurance and hedge fund
lending concerns us greatly.


BANC’s expansion into other categories, such as EB-5 escrow,
foreign national lending, and “no tax return” loans, underpin our
worries about BANC’s broader banking activities. Steven Sugarman,
who has no prior banking experience, has surrounded himself with a
de-facto all-star team from the subprime era. BANC’s Chief Risk
O�cer, Chief Investment O�cer, Chief Production O�cer, COO Of
Home Loans, Chair of the Audit Committee and a variety of Vice
Presidents were previously employed at failed or sanctioned lenders.


A Bevy Of Related Party Transactions That Bene�t Insiders


In becoming one of the fastest growing banks in the country, BANC
has engaged in a staggering number of related party transactions
including CS Financial and the soccer stadium naming rights deal.
These transactions have sent millions in proceeds to Sugarman
family members.


In another notable deal, BANC made an equity investment in an
a�liate of St. Cloud Capital, a private fund managed by Marshall
Geller. Mr. Geller is a Director of COR Clearing and an
investor(through St. Cloud) in both COR Securities Holdings and
BANC’s recapitalization. While BANC disclosed the transaction, it did
not mention that Mr. Geller appears to be a business associate of
Jason Galanis.


We discovered that Geller is the manager of EGS, LLC, a closely-held
entity that includes Galanis’ VL Assurance (Bermuda) Ltd. as a
member (VL Assurance is a subsidiary of Valor). Mr. Geller led a
2015 �nancing of Merriman Holdings (where he is also a Director)
that sent warrants to VL in the months preceding VL’s active
involvement in the Tribal Bonds Scheme. We think that BANC’s
willingness to use taxpayer-guaranteed deposits to �nance Mr. Geller
is a profound warning sign.


Note: Neither Mr. Geller or St. Cloud have been named in Government
complaints or accused of wrongdoing.

Perhaps most glaring is the 2015 resignation of BANC’s long tenured
CFO who signed a “Separation and Settlement” agreement that paid
him $1 million and included a release of claims.


Finally, we note that the bank has a history of delayed �nancial
reporting, complex executive compensation packages, recently
experienced a sharp increase in audit fees, and has had previously
disclosed (but since remediated) material weaknesses of internal
controls.

7/10/2019 BANC: Extensive Ties To Notorious Fraudster Jason Galanis Make Shares Un-Investible - Aurelius Value

In the Forewarned Investor, Steven Sugarman states:


“Investors have fallen for the same bag of tricks again and again. This
occurs despite the fact that every business rogue leaves tracks in the
sand. In isolation, these signs are usually minor and can be explained
away. But viewed in their totality, a damning picture emerges.”


The totality of our research establishes that BANC has a broad
mosaic of ties to the notorious fraudster Jason Galanis. In light of
Galanis’ demonstrated history of secretly gaining control of publicly
traded companies and large �nancial institutions, we believe there is
a material risk that Galanis gained control of Banc of California. Our
belief is strengthened by the striking paralells between BANC and
Galanis’ Gerova Financial which left unsuspecting investors with
enormous losses as part of a giant fraud.


As a result, we believe Banc Of California is simply un-investible.


Investors are strongly encouraged to conduct their own due diligence
into these factors and to take one more piece of advice from Steven
Sugarman:


– The Forewarned Investor, a treatise on identifying corporate fraud
co-authored by BANC’s CEO, Steven Sugarman


“The signs of fraud are often uncovered �rst by a small
number of people who have been watching a company
closely. When those people start to make their �ndings
public, they may be the voice of the minority, but they
may have important information to share… Skeptics
can come from a variety of places. One place to look
for them is among short sellers, who are betting that a
company’s stock will decline. When executives blame
short sellers for the decline in their stock price, you
can be pretty sure that something else is wrong with
the business.“
