NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


by Melissa Davis - 3/21/2011 7:36:42 PM


* Editor’s Note: The following is the second story in a two-part series on Northern Oil and Gas. Simply click here
to access the earlier article.


Northern Oil and Gas (AMEX: NOG) sure boasts a pretty stock chart for a company with so many ugly stains.


In just two short years, NOG has managed to overcome its dark history as a dubious penny-stock company to
become one of the brightest stars in the entire energy sector. With its stock rocketing from $2 to $29.44 during
that brief period, including a 150% jump since last May alone, NOG now sports a generous $1.8 billion market
value that rivals those achieved by far more established players – with far less baggage – in the red-hot energy
space.


Of course, NOG proudly showcases the company’s best features – its exploding revenue, its perfect drilling record,
its heavy focus on the oil-soaked Bakken shale – in the pictures it paints when seeking to impress Wall Street.
Meanwhile, throughout its recent rally, NOG has managed to escape the harsh public spotlight that burned it once
but has since faded away and allowed fresh dirt to gather under the safe cover of dark.


Still, corporate filings reveal, those blemishes – the tainted company founders, the incestuous business
arrangements, the fishy transfer agent, the sanctioned stock promoter, the relentless insider sales (which
skyrocketed last week) – lurk just below the surface ready to grab the attention of curious bears or even distracted
bulls who suddenly decide to open their eyes and take a careful look. Just one of those festering sores, let alone a
combination of all of them and more, could prove damaging enough to leave permanent scars on NOG and its
gorgeous stock price.


Take NOG’s transfer agent, a party often overlooked as irrelevant, just for starters. Standard Registrar & Transfer,
a tiny firm hired by NOG despite its faraway base in a suburban Utah home, lists Ronald P. Harrington as its
president. Harrington, in turn, lists no past regulatory violations in his firm’s official filings with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Based upon an extensive review conducted by TheStreetSweeper, however,
Harrington – or at least someone who shares his name, his profession and even his same corner of Utah -- has
been sanctioned by the SEC at least two different times in the past.


“We haven’t had any problems like that,” Harrington insisted last week, “unless you know something I don’t.”


After TheStreetSweeper offered to share the evidence it had gathered, however, Harrington quickly hung up the
telephone. During that brief conversation, Harrington referred to TheStreetSweeper’s questions – covering
everything from the size of his firm’s staff and clients to his professional track record – as “personal” and
“offensive” and, other than denying past regulatory sanctions, never addressed any of them.


The SEC routinely asks transfer agents similar questions about their past conduct, however. Specifically, records
show, the SEC asks if regulators have ever found the transfer agent or any “control affiliate” in violation of
securities laws or restricted either one’s professional activities – both relevant issues in this case – for any reason.


Peter J. Henning, a law professor who formerly served as a senior attorney for the enforcement division of the SEC,
warns of potentially serious consequences for those who supply misleading reports to federal regulators.


“If it came to the SEC’s attention, hopefully they would pursue at least an investigation if not an enforcement
action,” says Henning, who worked as both a regulator and a prosecutor before assuming his current post as a law
professor focused on white-collar crime at Wayne State University. “Those disclosure requirements are very
important.” 


Years ago, records show, the SEC cracked down on Ronald P. Harrington for allegedly concealing the true
ownership of “free trading stock” held by insiders in nominee accounts and then sold into the public marketplace.
Before that, records show, the SEC actually banned Harrington from serving as an accountant for any publicly
traded company after he allegedly issued audit reports that violated generally accepted accounting practices. 


That same year, government filings indicate, Harrington simply abandoned his accounting career and became a
transfer agent instead. For some reason, NOG now trusts Harrington to keep track of its stock – which currently
trades, on average, more than 1.5 million shares a day -- from the apparent comfort of his Utah home some 1,240
miles away.


Henning notes that most big companies hire brand-name firms, such as State Street or BNY Mellon, to serve as
their transfer agents instead.


“For a company with a lot of shareholders, that’s a very important job,” explains Henning, who writes a popular
column for the “White Collar Watch” section of The New York Times. “These are the owners (shareholders) of the
company you are dealing with, and the last thing you want are shares out there that can’t be tracked …


“So a company should be careful and do its due diligence,” he adds, “because it has to be able to trust that its
transfer agent is doing that job right.”


NOG failed to answer questions for this story.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 2/226


NOG’s non-executive founders (discreetly identified in an early corporate filing) look rather alarming, too. The
first, Douglas M. Polinsky, previously served as CEO of a gambling-machine company that made headlines years
ago because of its suspected ties to the Mob. (His father Jerrold Polinsky – portrayed as the secret force behind
that company – later wound up in prison, the local St. Paul Pioneer-Press reported, for convictions on fraud and
bribery charges.) The second, Joseph A. Geraci II, worked as a broker until the National Association of Securities
Dealer slapped him with its harshest sanction possible – a permanent ban from the industry – because of the
“egregious nature” of his activities and its efforts to “protect the public interest” from any future transgressions
down the road.


In 2008, the year after NOG went public through the reverse-merger process favored by shady microcap players,
Polinsky and Geraci dumped a combined $9 million worth of company stock – despite a so-called “lockup
agreement” restricting insider sales – before quietly fading from the scene ahead of a damaging Barron’s report
that delivered a powerful hit to the company and its double-digit stock price. They never disappeared entirely,
however, with both men since resurfacing as named defendants in a 2010 shareholder lawsuit against NOG
insiders (including its current executives and their relatives) for alleged conflicts involving the creation of yet
another energy company – now known as Voyager Oil and Gas (AMEX: VOG) – that has supplied a fresh source of
stock and the opportunity to repeat the lucrative NOG cycle all over again.


Michael L. Reger serves as the founding CEO of NOG, while his brother James Russell “J.R.” Reger (who, together
with his uncles, sold NOG some of its first leases) fills the same post at younger VOG.  The companies themselves
look more like clones than brothers, with NOG establishing the definitive genetic traits – including some of the
same nasty birthmarks – that’s essentially turned VOG into its younger twin.


Thanks to NOG’s four-year head-start, Michael Reger has already capitalized on that powerful formula to become a
multimillionaire. Like Polinsky and Geraci, as well as fellow co-founder and current NOG President Ryan R.
Gilbertson, Michael Reger cashed in on the stock’s early run with lucrative insider sales that appeared to violate a
restrictive lockup agreement and only halted after Barron’s raised uncomfortable questions about those
transactions and the company itself. NOG’s top executives carried out the last of those original sales in July of
2008, near the peak of a rally crushed by Barron’s just one week later, and never sold another share until the stock
fully recovered (with the lockup agreement now comfortably expired) as 2009 drew to an end.


Since then, Reger and Gilbertson have gone on to pocket enormous stock-related gains. For the past year, records
show, Reger and Gilbertson have sold stock like clockwork – cashing in hefty profits every single month -- in a
frenetic selling spree that has delivered a combined $40 million-plus to their well-stuffed bank accounts. Reger
executed his biggest sales by far during a three-day span last week, new corporate filings show, when he collected
almost $23 million after dumping a full 20% of his previous stock holdings in the company he helped found. 


Reger actually reported the third-largest open-market sale by any insider on Friday (the day after
TheStreetSweeper sent NOG a list of detailed questions for this story), TheStreet.com revealed, and the largest sale
by a company executive – as opposed to a “beneficial owner” such as JP Morgan – by a landslide.


As NOG’s top executive, the insider arguably best equipped to foresee additional gains, Reger could have held onto
that stock or even purchased more if he expected the price to keep on climbing higher. Like his sidekick Gilbertson,
however, Reger has never joined outsiders in the recent buying frenzy. Instead, records indicate, Reger has rushed
to capitalize on NOG’s breathless rally by dumping so much stock at such handsome prices that he recently
managed to shatter his old records by scoring the equivalent of $1.17 million an hour – or almost $20,000 a
minute – when the market was open for business to accommodate his transactions during last week's
massive three-day selling spree.


The Rap Sheet


For years, research indicates, NOG has carried more weight than some penny-stock companies while largely
escaping the forces of gravity that often hammer those shares.


Even Barron’s took a relatively light swing at NOG when covering the company’s two non-executive founders. It
merely identified Polinsky as the past CEO of International Gaming Management (IGM), for example, and noted
that the company specialized in distributing gambling machines before its stock was ultimately delisted. It then
vaguely mentioned that Polinsky’s father wound up “charged with crimes,” which sent him to prison for several
years, but never shared any of the sensational details – widely covered by the press earlier – about IGM’s
suspected ties to the Mob.


“Officials are investigating IGM because of its alleged links to New York’s Genovese crime family,” The
Commercial Appeal of Memphis reported in mid-1994. “A combined federal and state gambling task force raided
the company’s offices (and) also searched homes of some IGM executives, including Douglas Polinsky, the former
chief executive officer, and his father Jerrold Polinsky …


“IGM enriched the elder Polinsky and his alleged underworld ‘handler,’ Gary Danzo, an associate of the Genovese
family, the search warrant affidavit states. (Moreover), the agents further accused the Polinskys of swindling
shareholders in order to enrich themselves.”


The elder Polinsky was convicted of bribery in 1997, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press later reported, and then
convicted again on fraud and tax evasion charges the following year. He was ordered to serve three years in prison
on the first conviction, the newspaper said, and roughly twice that amount on the second. (He was never charged
in a bigger gambling case that nailed several mobsters linked to an IGM supplier, the newspaper noted, and
consistently denied any Mafia ties to the end.)


Meanwhile, records indicate, Douglas Polinsky himself escaped criminal charges entirely. After bouncing back
from that big scandal, corporate filings show, Polinsky joined forces with Geraci – harshly sanctioned by the NASD
just a few years earlier – to help launch NOG and, like Geraci, go on to become a multimillionaire.


Polinsky and Geraci never responded to phone messages and email requests seeking input for this story.


The Magic Formula


NOG officially went public at $4 a share in the spring of 2007, records show, with the stock largely ignored –
barely trading when it traded at all – for the next several months. The company then hired a tainted publicity firm
to promote its stock, however, and soon enjoyed a jump in its share price and a corresponding burst in its trading
volume.


Under the leadership of founding President Gerald N. Kieft, a disgraced broker suspended by the NASD for
allegedly issuing dubious research reports in the past, Wall Street Resources has aggressively touted a slew of risky
penny stocks over the years (and caught the attention of TheStreetSweeper along the way). WSR added NOG to its
client list in mid-2007, records show, pocketing a combination of cash and company stock for its initial six-month
publicity campaign.


NOG marched to almost $7 a share during that promotion, records show, with the company’s top executives –
soon joined by their fellow co-founders – kicking off their first major selling spree near the end of that big climb.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 3/226


The company again hired WSR in October of 2008, records show, hoping to stage a comeback from the Barron’s
report that had recently hammered its shares.


NOG continued to pay WSR for “investor relations services” for the next two years, records show, with company
insiders launching their current stock-selling spree along the way. In fact, according to a standard company profile
featured on CNNMoney.com, NOG still relies on Kieft as its head of investor relations to this day.


At this point, records indicate, NOG’s in-house director of investor relations – Vice President of Business
Development Erik Nerhus – has landed in trouble with authorities, too. At 2:40 a.m. on Friday, the inmate roster
for the local Hennepin County Jail shows, Erik Anders Nerhus was taken into custody for allegedly driving while
impaired and then refusing to submit to a sobriety test. 


Less than 24 hours earlier, TheStreetSweeper had contacted Nerhus by telephone and email seeking input for this
story. He never responded to a detailed list of questions, however, and Kieft (sarcastically) dismissed a request for
information as well.


Meanwhile, records show, WSR has snagged VOG – a newer version of NOG itself – as a paying client as well.
Today, records show, WSR prominently showcases VOG in both the “Focus List” and the “aggressive growth
portfolio” featured on the homepage of its website. WSR’s president now shows up as the head of investor relations
for VOG, too. 


For the most part, records show, WSR’s other clients trade for less than $1 – many for mere pennies – if in fact
they continue to trade at all. As a result, both NOG and VOG jump out from that crowd.


Following the path blazed by NOG after it first hit the market, VOG has fared so well as a brand-new Bakken oil
play that it managed to “up-list” from the OTC Bulletin Board to the American Stock Exchange before it even
celebrated its first birthday as a publicly traded company. Like NOG before it, VOG also enjoyed rapid triple-digit
gains along the way. All told, VOG has rocketed almost 250% -- soaring from $1.40 to $4.89 a share – since the
company (a former poker stock) set out to become the next NOG less than one short year ago.


TheStreetSweeper called VOG seeking information for this story. After TheStreetSweeper identified itself,
however, the company’s CEO abruptly hung up the telephone.


The Insider Maze


NOG insiders have actually been accused of helping VOG – and essentially blamed for its success – by
shortchanging investors in their own company.


A pending shareholder lawsuit, filed last year against insiders at both companies, spotlights a web of family
connections and potential conflicts that reaches far beyond even those revealed in official corporate filings. The
players, as alleged in the complaint, include the following: 


* Michael Reger, the founding CEO of NOG


* Michael Reger’s wife Brittany L. Reger, the manager of Reger Gas, a family-operated company (sharing NOG’s
address) that owned 20% of Plains Energy Investments before it became VOG and controlled 1.73% of VOG’s stock
even after that


* James Russell “J.R.” Reger, the CEO of VOG and the brother of NOG CEO Michael Reger


* James Randall Reger, the father of both Michael and J.R. Reger, the founding CEO of Plains Energy and the
owner of more than 5% of VOG’s outstanding shares


* Ryan R. Gilbertson, an NOG co-founder and top company executive (current president, past CFO) and early
investor in Plains Energy who, together with two affiliated firms -- Crystal Bay Capital Consulting and Wayzata
Energy Capital – owned a combined 19% stake in Plains Energy before it became VOG and (through Wayzata)
retained a stake in VOG itself


* Weldon W. Gilbertson, the father of NOG President Ryan Gilbertson, the original founding president (and 1.8%
owner) of Plains Energy and an ongoing shareholder in VOG as well


* Chad D. Winter, the current CFO (and past vice president) of NOG and the founder of another investment firm --
Wayzata Bay Capital – with an early stake in Plains Energy that led to ownership of VOG shares


* Douglas M. Polinsky, a co-founder and former director of NOG and the president of Great North Capital
Consultants, yet another early investor in Plains Energy that retained a stake in VOG itself


* Joseph A. Geraci II, also a co-founder and former director of NOG and the manager of Mill City Ventures, which
(like Polinksy’s firm) took an early stake in Plains Energy and wound up with stock in VOG as a result


The lawsuit basically claims that NOG executives, “aided and abetted” by their fellow co-founders and insiders at
VOG, hurt the company through a conflicted deal that created a new competitor (with an identical business model)
that could essentially capitalize on opportunities that NOG should have pursued itself. Even if that lawsuit fades
away, with both NOG and VOG seeking to dismiss it in court, the complaint has already showcased a maze of
troubling conflicts – and the continued involvement of NOG’s tainted non-executive founders – for the entire
world to see.


The Permanent Stain


Corporate filings add more layers to that pattern. 


In 2009, records show, Lantern Advisers – a firm co-managed by Polinsky and Geraci – helped VOG sell 3.4
million shares of stock at 85 cents a share in a private placement before it merged with a corporate shell (originally
known as World Poker Tour) and became a Bakken oilfield stock. Great North Capital Consultants, the Polinsky-
led firm mentioned in the shareholder lawsuit, then followed up by raising additional funds for VOG just a few
months ahead of its official debut as a publicly traded energy company. Both firms collected valuable chunks of
VOG stock for their services, records show, with Great North signaling plans to sell its entire stake -- for a quick
return of roughly $1 million (based on the offering price) – in a registration statement filed just before the
company began trading under its current name.


Polinsky and Geraci essentially hit the jackpot twice, with NOG first and VOG later, in records otherwise defined
by losing bets on hapless penny stocks instead. 


For example, records show, the pair teamed up to launch a new gambling company – Poker Magic (OTC:
POKR.OB) – the year before NOG hit the market. They actually assumed leadership roles in this particular case,
records show, with Polinsky still serving as CEO and Geraci as CFO of the obscure poker company to this day.
POKR has never traded above the $1 mark (and often fails to trade at all), records indicate, peaking last month at
90 cents before quickly plummeting to its current price of just 30 cents a share.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 4/226


Today, records show, NOG and POKR actually share the same neighborhood – their corporate offices separated by
a mere one-minute drive – despite the vast differences in their market value and available resources. Of course, as
documented above, NOG still looks like a penny-stock company in many telling ways. NOG never really outgrew
the traits that defined it at birth, research indicates, even if the company’s share price suggests that it did.


In a late 2008 interview with the local Twin Cities Business newspaper, Reger confidently (if prematurely)
predicted the stock’s big breakout. Although NOG had staged a modest comeback from the damaging Barron’s
report by then, the stock would soon reverse course and lose more than two-thirds of its value in the months that
followed. But NOG finally found its bottom around $2 a share in March of 2009 -- just days before the old
restriction on insider sales happened to expire – and soon launched the explosive rally that took it all the way to
this month’s record-breaking highs.


To some, Reger now looks like a fortune-teller who saw the light before the market even opened its eyes. To others,
however, he looks like a false prophet whose blinding faith – and bright forecast -- could come back to haunt him
in the end.


“I could fall asleep under my desk for the next two years,” Reger told the local business journal about two years
ago, “and wake up a hero …


“I talk to my investors and say, ‘Help me figure out a way I could screw this up,’” he concluded. “Because I can’t see
one.” 


* Important Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this article, TheStreetSweeper (through its members) has
effected a “short sale” of 53,000 shares of the stock of NOG beginning on March, 17, 2011, at an average price of
$28.7889 a share, with the intent of profiting from decreases in the price of the stock. (This represents an
increase from the 50,000 shares sold short at an average price of $28.7536 a share disclosed at the end of
TheStreetSweeper's first NOG story on March 21.) TheStreetSweeper covered 20,000 shares of its short position
at $28.64 on March 22; it covered the remaining 33,000 shares at $26.435 on March 23. TheStreetSweeper may
choose to take additional positions in the stock going forward and will fully disclose the details of those trades if
and when they occur.


Update: TheStreetSweeper began establishing a new short position in NOG on April 22. It has sold a total of
13,471 shares of NOG short, at an average price of $24.60 a share, since that time. It covered that position at
$23.5025 a share.


New Update: TheStreetSweeper established another new short position in NOG on May 9, when it sold a total of
38,500 shares short at $21.23 a share. It covered 18,900 shares at $20.25 a share on May 12 and the remaining
19,600 shares at $19.95 on May 16. TheStreetSweeper may choose to establish a new short position in NOG and
will fully disclose the details of that investment if and when it occurs. 


New Update: TheStreetSweeper began establishing a new short position in NOG on Aug. 30, when it sold 2,000
shares of the company's stock short at $20.90 a share. It covered that position on Sept. 2 at $19.22 a
share. TheStreetSweeper sold 3,000 shares of NOG stock short on Sept. 8 at $20.35 a share and then covered
that position by repurchasing the stock on Sept. 9 at $19.21 a share. It established a new short position in NOG
on Sept. 13, when it sold 2,000 shares of the company's stock short at $20.74 a share. TheStreetSweeper may
choose to adjust the size of this position going forward and will fully disclose the details of any future
transactions as they occur. 


New Update: TheStreetSweeper established a new short position in NOG on Dec. 26, when it sold 4,000 shares of
the company's stock short at $24.40 a share. It covered that position on Dec. 27 at $23.89 a share. It then
established another short position in NOG on Jan. 3, selling 8,100 shares at $24.86 a share. It shorted an
additional 4,500 shares on Jan. 4 at $25.33 a share and has now sold a total of 12,600 shares of NOG short at an
average price of $25.03 a share. TheStreetSweeper covered 4,500 of those shares on Jan. 5 at $24.81 a share,
reducing its short position to 8,100 shares at this time. It covered the remaining 8,100 shares on Jan. 6 at $24.79
and no long has a position in the stock.


* New Update: TheStreetSweeper established a new short position in NOG on Jan. 10, when it sold 6,400 shares
of the company's stock short at $25.39 a share. It covered all 6,400 shares on Jan. 12 at $24.58 a share and no
longer has a position in the stock at this time.

Turtle Beach (HEAR): Too Expensive!


Turtle Beach (HEAR) is running like a gazelle following the market's optimistic take on the first
quarter financial results released Wednesday.


But we’re expecting a nice correction long before Turtle Beach reports next quarter’s net loss.


The headset company did see revenue grow to $40.89 million in the first quarter and a net
income of $2 million… quite commendable.


But company guidance shows some disappointment ahead in the second quarter. While
revenue is expected to rise, net losses are also expected to return. Anticipated net loss is
$-0.05 per share, the company states. Those losses will ramp up the $-168.69 million
accumulated deficit.


Meanwhile, the market has gone overboard on optimism and ignored the losses and
challenges, including the onerous risk of a headset division built on finicky adolescent gamers.


The popular battle games "Fortnite" and "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" were credited for
the quarter's improvement. The challenge here is that today’s popular game may become
tomorrow’s loser.


And there are other issues that make this stock appear risky right now…


*1. Declining Interest

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 5/226


Searches for Turtle Beach headsets have recently slumped, according to Google Trends.


“Turtle Beach XO Three,” was Googled most during Nov. 19-25 and Dec. 24-30. Interest
dropped from 100… down to the April 29-May 5 timeframe of just 13:


(Source: Google Trends)


Peak popularity of “Turtle Beach Ear Force” hit Dec. 24-30. Search interest plunged into the
April 29-May 5 timeframe to just 40 and near the end of the May 6-12 timeframe, the figure is
34.


(Source: Google Trends)


“Turtle Beach Stealth” searches dropped 67% from December to May 5th, falling in at just 33.


(Source: Google Trends)





*2. Rivals Racing


Meanwhile, Turtle Beach headsets didn’t even make the cut in PC Gamer’s 2018 review of
gaming headsets.


In the review released earlier this week, Turtle Beach’s arch rivals Kingston HyperX Cloud
Alpha and Arctis Pro GameDAC earned top honors.


Other headsets that received favorable comments in this veritable bible for gamers were
models by Logitech, Creative and Corsair.


(Source: PC Gamer)


Both the Google trends and PC Gamer’s snub raise questions of whether Turtle Beach could
see future deterioration in market share.


*3. Adding To Rally 


The stock is rising again this morning, following a Wedbush "outperform" rating and 12-month
price target increase from $4 to $12.50. The stock is already ~34% higher... suggesting a
significant drop may be just ahead.

Genprex (GNPX): Another Introgen Bomb?


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for investors considering Genprex (GNPX)!


After going public in late March at $5 per share, the stock has shot up by an ominous 190+%.


But the market has missed the risks inherent in this 4-person, pre-revenue biotech linked to a spectacular biotech
bust, Introgen Therapeutics.


Whether Genprex will follow Introgen’s pathway is anyone’s guess. The company has already lost $17.5 million in
getting its experimental therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Oncoprex, to Phase I/II trials.


It may well be years, if ever, before it reaches Phase III. Even under the best of conditions, the next steps are
expensive and extensive, as demonstrated by Novartis. Its NSCLC drug, Zykadia, finally got FDA approval three
long years after receiving accelerated approval.


If Genprex happened to become one of the 15% that receives FDA approval and commercializes, it would face
other multi-billion-dollar giants with approved NSCLC therapies such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Indeed, if Genprex
ever gets to market, newer technologies may be waiting, too.


Any advancement by Genprex will likely require many, many years of destroying shareholder value through dilution.

Tandem Diabetes Care (TNDM): Pumping Up Risk

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 6/226


The stock has shot up and is now positioned to plunge as risks escalate, including:


*A raft of $3.50 warrants for over 9 million shares pose significant dilution potential and stand to increase the hefty
$337 million market cap.


*The CEO has recently taken advantage of the high stock price and warrant opportunity to sell stock through his
trust.


*Tandem is a small, undifferentiated player in a field dominated by Medtronic.


*Heavy weights J&J and Roche have transitioned out of the insulin field, amid heavy competition, making Medtronic
their partner-of-choice.


* Tandem is investing in more sales people and commercialization, which will require fresh infusions from more
dilutive financing.


*Big banks, retirement funds and other institutions show very minimal interest in the stock .. and positions have
plunged by 7.7 million shares.

Odyssey Marine Exploration (OMEX): Drifting To The Bottom Of The Sea


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for investors considering Odyssey Marine Exploration
(OMEX).


The Tampa, Florida company once lured investors with swashbuckling explorations of gold-
laden shipwrecks. But now, as a mundane marine service company, focus has turned to the
unapproved plan of dredging seabed phosphate off the coast of Mexico.


Odyssey has already run through $235 million of investors’ money and the investment risks
are blowing up:


*The stock has shot up more than 200% since mid-March. This unwarranted, dangerous
increase positions the stock to suddenly unwind.


*The company is debt-riddled, cash-poor and rapidly burning existing cash.


*Annual revenue has dropped to the lowest level in over a decade.


*Odyssey just sold more assets. Most of the few remaining assets have been pledged to
lenders.


*Odyssey refuses to disclose estimated massive costs of the Don Diego project.


*The biggest short-term harm to current shareholders would be if Odyssey really did get the Don
Diego permit. Exploding costs and tremendous dilution would crush shareholders.

Generation Next Franchise Brands (VEND): Looming $100+ Million Meltdown


Generation Next Franchise Brands (OTCQB: VEND) stock is flying around 4-year highs …
even as the company sells stock for under half today’s going rate.


By the end of June, the company hopes to roll out vending machines containing small robots
that serve frozen yogurt, a fad that has come and gone amid oversaturation in recent years.


But the bulletin board stock’s $100-plus million market value seriously overestimates the value
of the business, in our view.


We believe the valuation is difficult to justify considering Generations’ business failure,
promotional efforts, checkered past, financial condition and recent desperate discount stock
sales.


The company stated it would soon respond formally to TheStreetSweeper’s questions
regarding the market cap and other issues. So watch for later installments to this story.


Meanwhile, check out Generation’s website here, before we examine some issues threatening
to melt this yogurt stock.


*Selling Stock At 63 Cents


Selling stock and booting its accountants kept Generation busy around the first of the year.


The stock traded at $2.06 at the closing bell on March 29. The next day, the company
disclosed it sold a whopping 6.159 million shares for one-third the going price or just 63 cents

apiece.


Earlier, on Jan. 2, 2018, with the stock fetching 88 cents per share, the company raised $6.4
million as it sold 12.8 million shares at 50 cents apiece.


About two weeks later in January, the company raised a red flag as it dismissed its accounting
firm Anton & Chia – which replaced a firm that resigned in 2015 – which replaced a
firm dismissed in 2013 after expressing doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a
going concern.  The most recent accountant group is a small, lower-tier, non-Better-Business-
Bureau-accredited firm, Benjamin & Young.


Cheap stock will be hitting the market, while more dilutive offerings and financial hurdles likely
wait around the bend as Generation dives into an expensive proposition …


*Replacing Failed Vending Business


Under the name of Fresh Healthy Vending International, the company tried to freshen up the
vending machine franchise business a few years back by selling healthy snacks and drinks.


But net losses of over $-2 million yearly persisted in 2014 and 2015 amid franchisee issues.
By June 2016, net losses had grown to $-5 million. Generation’s assets are now around $21.7
million. But liabilities are nearly twice that at $40.8 million.


The business just wasn't cutting it.


So, last spring, the freshly minted Generation Next Franchise Brands Inc. discontinued new
franchise sales and ceased all marketing of healthy snack vending franchises. “Furthermore,”
the company disclosed, “we have sold our corporate route and no longer operate our own
healthy vending machines.”


Yet the company promotes the old business on its website today, urging visitors to “Get
Started!” in the healthy vending business that Generation has ditched:

Regardless, now Generation states it is focused on vending machines containing small robots
that serve up frozen yogurt in 60 seconds.

Orgenesis (ORGS): Five Top Investment-Killing Risks


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for Orgenesis (ORGS) investors.


A few days after trading began on the Nasdaq and a few months after a reverse split,
Orgenesis stock has gone crazy … not in a good way.


It’s not good because the business has not changed and simply can’t support the $150+
million stock market valuation.


Though it touts itself as a medical product company, the truth is that it is multi-millions of
dollars, tremendous dilution to stockholders and many years away from getting its diabetes
product to market… if it ever happens.


Instead, Orgenesis is actually in the fiercely competitive world of manufacturing drugs for other
companies. The company has the arguable disadvantage of an overseas manufacturing plant.
Plus Orgenesis lost $12.4 million from its manufacturing business last year alone.


The company’s viewpoint is here. Meanwhile, let’s consider five top risks presented by
Orgenesis:


*1. Cash Hungry


On revenue of $3.4 million, Orgenesis net loss hit $865,000 last quarter.


That was considered a good quarter. So it’s easy to see that the company survives on a
steady diet of stock selling and convertible debt. In the last couple of months, the company
had to enact a private stock offering to raise $1.2 million so it could keep the lights on a couple
more quarters.  


Even though it has done almost nothing to advance its technology, the company burns through
about $1 million per quarter. Any attempt to advance would require some 50 times that figure.


It's hard to take the former "Business Outsourcing Services" seriously, as it began
repositioning itself as a drug development company back in 2011. The company has had
plenty of time to advance, yet its working capital is a negative ... $-10 million.


*2. Loans Coming Due


The company’s debt is piling up and clamoring for attention as notes convertible to stock come
due.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 8/226


The company warns that other than converting those notes to stock or somehow raising a lot
of money, “we may not be able to pay them when due.”


“As of November 30, 2017, we owed approximately $8.7 million in principal amount and
accrued interest under convertible loan agreements with third party lenders with varying
maturity dates, the latest of which is August 22, 2019.” 


*3. Overseas Ownership, Operations


Most Orgenesis directors and executive officers live in Israel and Belgium.


“The majority of our assets are located outside the United States,” SEC filings state.


If the company has nothing to distinguish itself in the highly competitive outsource drug
manufacturing business ... besides a foreign plant and other assets, that's not much.


Foreign ownership and assets can be risky because U.S. investors may well have trouble
asserting any claims in other countries, and the U.S. courts and securities laws may be
ineffective overseas.

RenovaCare (RCAR): Investigation Or Other Issues Spark Skull-And-Crossbones Designation


TheStreetSweeper releases a RenovaCare investor alert.


The stock has been hit with OTC Markets' skull-and-crossbones designation.


OTC reserves the skull-and-crossbones for stocks with major concerns including: An
investigation, spam email promotions, and disruptive corporate actions.


Other concerns include:


*RenovaCare’s OTC designation is the most ominous development to date.


*RenovaCare has applied Rule 144 to allow the technology inventor to sell all of his stock
immediately.


* We’ve asked why the inventor is selling. Is he doubtful about the technology’s value?
Doubtful of the company’s future or the absurd $685 million valuation? No response thus far.


*The majority stockholder, Harmel Rayat, is still on course to sell over 2 million shares. That
registration remains unaltered, despite some investors’ misunderstanding that the stockholder
has backed off.


***


RenovaCare (RCAR) has received a designation reserved for the worst of the worst stocks,
the OTC Markets' skull-and-crossbones:





RenovaCare trades on the Over-The-Counter exchange, reserved for stocks that lack the right
stuff to trade on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.


Now, the OTC has slapped RenovaCare with the caveat emptor warning.





(Source: OTC Markets, TheStreetSweeper)


OTC applies the skull-and-crossbones symbol when it becomes aware of:


* Investigation of Fraud or Other Criminal Activities — There is an investigation or other
indication of fraudulent or other criminal activity involving the company, its securities or insiders.


Other issues that may have entered into OTC’s decision to place RenovaCare in the bad
category include:


*Stock promotions with inadequate information for the public -  


This may include “spam email, unsolicited … news releases, whether published by the company or a third
party.”


*Other public interest concerns -


Concerns “may include but are not limited to promotion, spam or disruptive corporate actions.”

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 9/226


(See OTC’s caveat emptor policy overview here)


The company has not responded to our numerous emailed and phoned requests for comment,
including several new requests.


Meanwhile, there is yet another cause for concern about the experimental spray-on skin
company, RenovaCare…


*Technology Inventor Is Registered To Sell Stock


The technology developer, Jorg Gerlach, can now SELL EVERY SINGLE SHARE of his
RenovaCare stock.


That’s right.


RenovaCare, which paid just $400,000 for the technology, recently disclosed that Dr. Gerlach
is now free to sell everything …


“The Company has determined that all shares required to be registered on behalf of Jörg Gerlach, MD
PhD. may now be sold without restriction under Rule 144…”

RenovaCare (RCAR): Dancing With Deception


RenovaCare (RCAR) is now dancing dangerously close to fraud.


Today, the company released “news” that a patent dispute has been settled. A naïve market
bought into this nonsense and pushed the stock to 5-year record levels exceeding $10. The
stock market valuation is now teetering on $750 million … for a company with nothing but a
pretty story surrounding its sole, experimental product which has not been submitted to the
FDA for approval.


RenovaCare doesn’t tell investors the truth.


So we will.


*1 Nothing Like “Old” News


Today’s company headline screams “RenovaCare Secures Patent Victory…”


Yippee, right?


But … on Dec. 18, 2017 … a Final Written Decision was issued by the US Patent Office,
resolving the patent dispute.


The decision date is right there in RenovaCare’s own SEC filing.


Now, desperate RenovaCare has issued a statement that claims “patent victory.”


Notice also that RenovaCare doesn’t dare enter this press release into its SEC filings. That
would invite closer regulatory scrutiny.


RenovaCare, in our opinion, has probably committed fraud. At best it is deceiving people with
3-month-old information dressed up as news.


*2.  The Motivation


What’s behind today’s shenanigans?


Well, the motivation is clear.


RenovaCare's SEC filing that contains the patent decision date is the S-1.


This Feb. 12, 2018 document sets up insiders to unload millions of shares of their cheap
stock.        


So obviously, RenovaCare wants to put on a good show so insiders can sell into the inflated
stock price.


*3. More Out-Right Deception


Yesterday, Feb. 20, small investors breathed a sigh of relief.


But RenovaCare had just duped non-insiders.

TheStreetSweeper issues a brand-new report on Zion Oil & Gas (ZN)!


The stock has shot to dangerous levels as this oil exploration company explores, in our opinion, the best way to get
to investors.


Zion is perfecting its approach:


1. Release a meaningless report, spiked with hyperbole. 


2. Target uninitiated, preferably religious, folks to buy into the story.


3. Wave in front of these people a unit purchase plan, in hopes they will fund continued failure equal to Zion’s last 18
years.


4. Watch the stock price shoot up.


5. Use God and scripture to distract new investors from realizing that they will likely ultimately be staring down yet
another dry hole … After all, Zion has a long history of dry holes.

RenovaCare (RCAR): Pumping 101: First the Pump, Then the Registration


TheStreetSweeper issues an updated “dump” alert for
RenovaCare (RCAR)!


The company has just released a virtually
meaningless press release in response to
TheStreetSweeper’s probe into the biotech. But at
same time, RenovaCare failed to tout the real
breaking news: The CEO, majority shareholder and
other insiders are set up to sell 4.4 million shares
of RCAR.


At today’s inflated stock price, those 10 sellers
could see a $33 million payday … on a bulletin board
stock that paid $400,000 for its heavily promoted,
unproven, sole asset.


RenovaCare has taken the next step in what we

RenovaCare (RCAR): Multiple Catalysts, Untold Downside


TheStreetSweeper releases an investor alert regarding RenovaCare (RCAR).


RenovaCare is the most dangerous stock covered to date, as these and other downside risks pile up:


*RenovaCare is run by 1 full-time employee and 3 part-time contractors … including the part-time CEO.


*The sole product was acquired on the cheap and has not been presented to the FDA for approval.


*The stock is gassed up by numerous, sometimes questionable, paid promotions … which recently came under
questioning by the OTC (Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board).


*A foreign stock promoter – formerly in trouble with the SEC – holds the controlling stock ownership position.


*No sales; little cash; big operating losses; auditors doubt the company can continue as a going concern.

arthritis beyond beginning phase III recruitment.


*The stock is rallying in conjunction with a large, third-party funded promotional campaign.


*The stock is also reacting to Can-Fite’s release of news, rehashed 17 days later.


*A recent registration of $50 million worth of stock allows immediate stock sales, complete with looming dilution
potential.


*The Israel-based company has lost $103 million and the stock price has dropped over the years, yet executive
compensation has risen above $3 million.

Digital Power Corporation (DPW): Crypto-Thriller Turns Into Stockholder-Chiller


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for Digital Power Corporation (DPW) investors!


The Fremont, California company has lost money six out of the last nine years since hitting the stock exchange.
Revenue captured back in the day - when its electronic power products sold fairly well to European businesses and
the military – has dropped by 36%. And the early years’ razor-thin profits have disintegrated into $1 million losses.


So Digital Power has jumped onto the investor-frenzied cryptocurrency rollercoaster. But the market is missing the
risks that lurk around every bend, including:


*SELLING. While the stock price was very high after the closing bell Monday, Digital filed notice to sell 640,000
shares … representing a major watering down of investors’ stock. 


*CRUNCH: Cash is very low, while working capital is negative at $-4 million. Virtually impossible for the company to
manage $9.8 million in short-term liabilities. 


*ODD: Curious perks for the CEO’s daughter.


*SELLERS: Majority stockholders have lined up to sell cheap Digital Power stock at crypto-fueled prices. More
dilutive actions loom dead ahead.


*DISINTERESTED: Big, reputable institutional firms are yawning at Digital Power. When the investment banks, big
retirement funds and other significant institutions hold less than 3% of the stock, it doesn't exactly inspire
confidence.

Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA): Taking Investors Down A Hole?


 Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA), an experimental RNA-based technology company, is a sudden highflyer that we
believe is positioned to plunge. Issues include:


*Company leadership is tied to another RNA-based company, Genta, a spectacular biotech bomb that burned up
$1.2 billion in investors’ money before it fizzled into oblivion.


*The recent development deal with Boehringer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Deals like this come and go frequently.
Indeed, Dicerna itself lost a similar $25 million deal last year.


*Dicerna has already tried – and failed – to advance a product beyond Phase 1 human trials. That failure cost the
company over $41 million.


*Dicerna has switched focus to GalXC and merely hopes to submit application to the FDA for US clinical trials next
year. If approved, Dicerna would take investors down a costly, 6-year to 11-year road of human trials.


*The stock is overvalued at this point and extremely risky.

Overstock (OSTK): Overextended


Overstock (OSTK) shares look ready to get shot down.


Overstock set itself up for the big plunge after it doubled its stock market valuation by tossing
out the words "alt-coins" and  “blockchain.”


Overstock is a Midvale, Utah retailer that sells unwanted furniture and clothing online. Now the
company is overstocked with buzzwords and is presenting itself as a whole different kind of
cowboy – and the market thinks it may suddenly be worth $1 billion.


Overstock is wading into a currency that the nation’s biggest banks and greatest investment
minds warn is a dangerous bubble, rippling with illicit activity.


Yep, the wild, wild cryptocurrency West is jammed with scams…


* Overstock and Cryptocurrency Scams


Overstock’s crypto-fueled stock surge began in August, after the online retailer began allowing
shoppers to pay with bitcoin and other digital tokens.


In September, the company announced plans for an exchange to trade tokens.


In October, the CEO announced a subsidiary, tZero, intends to hold an ICO – initial coin
offering – from Nov. 15 until Dec. 31. Rather than shares of stock, digital tokens would be
issued in the private placement.


One problem is that cryptocurrency is the latest weapon in the pump-and-dump and
Ponzi scheme world …


*Case in point:


The FBI busted the brother of a Morgan Stanley banker on Wednesday on charges he crafted
a cryptocurrency scam that relieved investors of $300,000.


Federal prosecutors said businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy touted ICOs that were supposedly
backed by real estate and diamonds. But it was all just a scam, according to prosecutors’
complaint. The New York Post reports Mr. Zaslavskiy smiled and winked at his brother, sitting
in the back of the courtroom. He faces up to five years behind bars.


*Another case in point:


The SEC recently pounced on a gentleman who created trendy companies and allegedly
misled investors into believing they would get rich quick:

*Yet another case:


OneCoin, which pitched itself as the next Bitcoin, has been denounced as a Ponzi scheme by
multiple national authorities. It is believed to have moved over $350 million in allegedly
scammed funds through a German processor.


*Warren Buffett: “A mirage.”


Meanwhile, none less than billionaire icon Warren Buffett thinks coin offerings will end badly.


“People get excited from big price movements, and Wall Street accommodates,” said Mr.
Buffett.


He described bitcoin as a “real bubble,” adding: “You can’t value bitcoin because it’s not a
value-producing asset.”


Mr. Buffet several years ago warned that cryptocurrency is “basically a mirage.”

TransEnterix (TRXC): When The CEO Sells, We Sell


TheStreetSweeper releases a brand-new report on TransEnterix (TRXC)! The stock price has rocketed to perilous
heights for this Morrisville, North Carolina company after its Senhance surgical robotic system received FDA
approval. Risks that we believe will soon lead to a massive stock plunge include:


*When the CEO sells, we sell. Five days after Senhance's FDA approval, the CEO sold off a whopping 600,000
shares of company stock. 


*In four years, the company has notched two commercial failures on FDA-approved products, one FDA rejection
and extreme shareholder dilution.


*The Senhance robotic system gained approval for overseas sales six years ago. But only three systems have sold
in all that time.


*In contrast, Intuitive Surgical sold and shipped 149 of its da Vinci systems from last July through September; 20
more were shipped under operating leases.


*It's absurd to assume the bot that failed overseas can gain a US toehold by winning over the world's brightest
medical minds while fighting giants like Intuitive and Johnson and Johnson/Google.


*The TransEnterix CEO says he doesn't expect a US sale for one year to 18 months.


*The three top officers’ compensation rose 36% last year to $4.9 million, despite overseeing the company's
accumulated losses of $333 million.


*RBC’s raised price target may be bad news for TranEnterix investors.


*The stock costs around 100 times past sales. Shares are extremely pricey even under the most outrageously
optimistic scenario.


*The easy part is over. Now the company has to build a business.

IZEA Inc. (IZEA): 5 Top Reasons To Run From This Stock


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for potential investors in IZEA, a momentary highflier that we
believe is positioned to plunge.


In just five days the stock has rocketed a jaw-dropping 200%, merely amplifying the issues
surrounding this chronic money-loser including:


1. Major Investor Sells


IZEA's desperation is palpable as a major investor reports on Tuesday that it has  dumped
450,000 shares of the company stock at $4 to $6.87 per share. The sale of nearly half-a-
million shares sounds like a robust sell signal to us:

(Source: Company SEC filing)


AWM Investment owned 1,018,215 shares in February 2016. So the investor has trimmed
holdings by a whopping 44%.


(Source: Company SEC filing)


*2. Desperate Recovery Attempt


After losing $4.1 million in six months in its business of connecting advertisers, freelance
writers and other content providers with social media publishers - and learning the 10% owner
was unloading IZEA  - the company needed to come up with a new, exciting story.


So 8 hours and 49 minutes before the investor filed the big stock sale, IZEA made an obvious
attempt to deflect that bad news by rushing out a statement that it has landed a seven-figure
contract with a big company over an unspecified period of time.


At the same time, CEO Ted Murphy announced IZEA is into artificial intelligence and
augmented reality .. which just happen to be among the hottest sectors right now.


"We believe our commitment to service, bolstered by our technology investments in areas
such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, will lead to ongoing opportunity with the
world’s leading brands,” Murphy stated.


So, IZEA's suddenly an AI  and AR force? Really???...


*3. AI, AR Not There


There's absolutely no mention in the company's SEC filings of AI or AR ever being part of
IZEA's business.


Instead, the Florida-based company works with no patented technology in the fiercely
competitive, low-barrier-to-entry field of pushing ads through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and
Youtube. The marketing message deliverery company also competes against direct mail, TV,
radio, cable and print, which now incorporate social media. IZEA regulatory filings also have
this to say about the company:

long-form text, videos, photos, illustrations, and status updates on behalf of marketers through websites, blogs
and social media channels. Marketers receive influential consumer content and engaging, shareable stories that
drive awareness.


 
The most recent 10-Q states:
 
The Company's primary technology platform, the IZEA Exchange (“IZEAx”), enables transactions to be


completed at scale through the management of custom content development, creator search and targeting,
bidding, analytics, and payment processing. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the
creation of multiple types of content including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a wide
variety of social channels including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, among others.


 
In addition to IZEAx, the Company operates the Ebyline technology platform it acquired in January 2015.


The Ebyline platform is a self-service content marketplace which was originally designed to replace editorial
newsrooms located within newspapers with a “virtual newsroom” to handle their content workflow.
 


Now IZEA claims it is suddenly in the AI and AR business ... and the market rewards this
silliness by running up the stock.


But IZEA sees that effort is levitating the stock and knows it needs recurring promotional
activity to keep feeding the beast...


*4. Promote, Promote, Promote


So IZEA pops out another tweet, arguably inexcusable at this point as it pre-announces an
announcement:





(Source: Twitter)


Meanwhile, professionals and novices troll the stock message boards, promoting IZEA in
hopes of further fueling the stock rally and ultimately selling on the backs of unwary retail
investors.


Professional promotions are probably happening now, considering IZEA's long history of
paying professional promoters. These promotions began in 2011, when IZEA's net losses had
nearly doubled to $-4 million that year alone:





All this pumping and story-switching is inexcusable - but not surprising - considering what
IZEA will almost certainly pull next ...


*5. Potential Raise, Dilution Ahead

Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY): TheStreetSweeper Demands Correction


TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert regarding Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY).


The stock has rocketed as jaw-dropping discrepancies and other issues fly under
shareholders' radar, including:


*HMNY’s CEO Ted Farnsworth served as president/CEO/CFO/sole director of Purple
Beverage Company, a flat-lining stock. But HMNY's regulatory filings do not disclose this vital
information to shareholders. TheStreetSweeper demands a correction.


*We’re also calling for HMNY to correct discrepancies in SEC filings – and preferably to issue
a clarifying press release – regarding Mitch Lowe, CEO of MoviePass. People are buying
HMNY stock partially because they think the chief executive of HMNY's acquisition co-founded
Netflix. Lowe told TheStreetSweeper this notion is wrong.


*Lowe's experience as a director at SEC sanctioned Medbox needs to be disclosed in HMNY
filings.


*The stock is heavily promoted via scores of tweets, including many from an apparent
promoter who has been silent on Twitter for two years before suddenly tweeting about HMNY.


*Bugs have angered subscribers after the recent rollout of the new $9.95 pricing plan by
MoviePass.

Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY): Shaking Down Shareholders


Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY) is an information technology company hooked on

The New York company merged with Zone Acquisition in November 2016, which ignited
additional losses.


The stock has rocketed by 90% and is now TheStreetSweeper sees a riskier investment than
ever:


*Financial Fumes


HMNY has been running on fumes …  $54.98 million in the red.


It’s burning $5 million in two quarters.


At the end of June, HMNY had just $1.4 million in available cash.


Here’s how dire the situation was, in management’s opinion:


“In management's opinion, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern through one year after the issuance of the accompanying financial
statements.”


Losses are growing exponentially. Investors endured a stunning $-1.97 loss in June:


The inability to make money – and we don’t believe it will ever be profitable -  has forced
HMNY to hurt shareholders, as shown below …


*Dilute and Destroy


HMNY’s apparent mission? Casual destruction of shareholders’ value.

Adomani is expanding its efforts to “enhance shareholder value” by hiring an IR firm
that doesn’t return phone calls.


The world’s most overvalued company hustled out a press release early Friday
morning, Sept. 1, announcing it has retained Hayden IR to “increase awareness.”


Eager to shine light on Adomani, TheStreetSweeper called Hayden for an interview.
IR expert James Carbonara answered but upon learning TheStreetSweeper was
calling, he took the number and said he’d call back on a better phone line. That
return call didn't happen. And no one would pick up the phone, though we tried to
reach investor relations again five times. Why is Adomani retaining a firm that isn’t
doing its job?


We wanted to know …


Isn’t it irresponsible to attempt to get retail investors into the stock at this level?


After a ~2% rise with the IR announcement, the stock’s teetering at a market
valuation exceeding $800 million.


Should Hayden really encourage people to buy high?


Wouldn’t a more responsible entry point be when the stock falls to around 75 cents
per share, or around a $50 million market cap?


The Newport Beach, California company makes drivetrains to convert gasoline
vehicles to electric vehicles.

But in five years, it has sold zero conversion kits and exactly two converted buses.
Yes, in five years.


One sale was so unremarkable the CFO said in a telephone interview with
TheStreetSweeper that he didn’t know how much money it generated.


The second life-time sale was a bus described by the CFO this way: “We got their
deposit in 2015. Delivered the vehicle in ‘16 and recognized a whopping $68,000 in
revenue in June of ’16."

MGT Capital Investments (MGTI): And This Week's Business Is ????


MGT Capital Investments (MGTI) is flying high while the company tries to decide whether to focus on social casinos,
fantasy sports, cybersecurity, mobile gaming or bitcoin mining. But now, TheStreetSweeper believes this indecisive
company is positioned to plummet, thanks to issues that include:


*Insider Sales. The CEO just sold 100,000 shares of the company stock.


*Leadership Turmoil: Two weeks ago, the CEO displaced the ever-controversial John McAfee, who resigned as
CEO and has been named the Chief Cybersecurity Visionary.


*Terrible Financials: MGT is low on cash and burns $2.15 million in two quarters. Losses in just six months hit $10
million. Substantial doubt exists that the company will be able to continue as a going concern.


*Poor Investor: Unable to finance a mining computer purchase order, MGT was forced to rely on UAHC Ventures,
which reports a 12-month loss of 12 cents per share and trades OTC for ~88 cents.


*Institutional Disinterest. Big banks avoid owning this stock.


*Horrid Ratios. The stock sports unimaginably bad ratios, including Price-To-Sales of 132, Price-To-Book of 860 and
investors’ negative Return-On-Equity of -1,251.

Trembling Time at Tremor Video (TRMR)


Shares in New York-based ad tech company, Tremor Video (TRMR),  have shot up
and are now at a trembling point, thanks to the following issues and more…


*Tremor stock will naturally realign itself with others in this beaten-down sector.


*Tremor is an indistinguishable non-contender in a space where even the best
takeout deal is blah.


*Tremor’s platform is a far weaker performer compared with existing solutions.


*Insiders are selling their Tremor stock.


*Tremor consistently loses money and appears highly unlikely to overcome its
financial issues and terrible returns to investors.

Adomani (ADOM):Adamantly The Worst $800 Million Company Ever


Zero-revenue Adomani (ADOM) may have lured more investors Thursday with the
release of the company’s take on a year-old announcement.


Below is the headline, which we consider highly deceptive:


ADOMANI Sees $2.9 Billion in Settlement Funds, from Volkswagen Environmental
Mitigation Trust, As Unprecedented Product Funding Opportunity in its Goal to "Help Yellow
Go Green!"(TM)
ACCESSWIREAugust 17, 2017


(Source: Adomani press release)


Investors couldn’t be blamed for concluding from this headline that Adomani might
receive $2.9 billion in settlement funds.


But that would be wrong. Adomani dredged up an old Environmental Protection
Agency announcement, in our view, in hopes of buffaloing investors and driving up
the stock.


The VW settlement – announced in 2016 – resulted from the car maker using “defeat
devices” to cheat emissions tests.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 18/226


Among other actions, VW agreed at that time to pay $2.7 billion to fund emission-
reduction projects across the country.


Adomani, which makes drivetrains to convert gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles
(and mentioned the settlement in previous filings), is not named as receiving
anything. But, in our view, this is the type of misleading information investors have
been subjected to since the financially burdened Adomani went public via
Regulation A in May and became the nation’s first Reg A to list on the NASDAQ in
June.


The company has released three arguably promotional, unclear, suggestive press
announcements in the past 10 days. This effort, along with those of professional
promoters and chatroom folks who didn’t know or didn’t care about fundamental
weaknesses apparently helped promote the stock to an absurd valuation of over
$800 million.


TheStreetSweeper is convinced that this stock will never, ever be worth even $18 million
much less $800 million.


Other issues include:


   *Adomani’s own CFO said he can’t justify the valuation.


   *Various options and warrants loom, including a stunning 21 million vested,
exercisable stock options at 10 cents. A potential bloodbath may be launched once
these shares are unlocked.


 *Untenable pre-IPO materials project the company could turn last year’s $11 million
loss into a $7 million gain this year.


  *No sales last quarter, in fact no sales for the past two years.


    *Only two bus sales ever.


   *No sales of conversion kits.


   *No plant.


  *Virtual headquarters.


  *Just 10 employees, nine of those working out of their homes.


  *No institutional interest.


  *Net losses, no material revenue since inception in 2012.


  *Price-to-Sales ratio of 13,072


  *$31 million accumulated losses.


Check out the company’s viewpoint here, then consider the top reasons we believe
this stock is headed for the junkyard:


*CFO Can’t Justify Valuation


In a July telephone interview with TheStreetSweeper, Adomani’s own chief financial
officer said he couldn’t justify the stock’s valuation.

Zion Oil & Gas (ZN): Cheap Warrants + Minimal Cash + No Revenue=Looming Dilution


 Dallas-based Zion Oil & Gas (ZN) is making a last-ditch effort to explore in the second of its two solitary leases in
Israel. Shares shot up in a month by an unsustainable 200%. Yet this stock presents multiple layers of risk to
investors, including:


*Engineers conducting an independent study of Zion’s final drilling prospect report low confidence in the project that
is surrounded by dry holes.


*Zion states it has no economically recoverable reserves.


*Zion had to plug its previous multi-million-dollar exploration project.

* Cash is very low as Zion begins exploratory drilling.

Ominto (OMNT): Something's Wrong In Denmark ... And Boca


After the market closed Thursday and the stock settled at one-month highs, Ominto
(OMNT) insulted investors by releasing a filing that shows its acquisition was even
worse than everyone thought.


In an odd action last December, Ominto paid $10.2 million in stock, cash and debt
expense for a 40% stake in Lani Pixels, a company at the brink of going under. Far
removed from Ominto’s struggling Boca Raton, Florida-based online coupon and
cash-back business, the Denmark/Dubai company is basically a father-and-son
shop that focuses on computer generated animated films.


It turns out that Lani is an even bigger wreck than we originally believed. Ominto’s
preliminary estimates of what it actually received for that outlandish price were bad.
But the actual numbers are miserable:


(Sources: Company SEC filings here, here, TheStreetSweeper)


Lani’s pathetic revenue turned out to be 80% lower than the estimated numbers. Loss
per share was 33% more severe.


Instead of paying 16 times estimated sales for an unrelated business, Ominto paid
a jaw-dropping 77 times actual sales!

Ominto: Revenue Depends On Recruits


Much of Ominto’s revenue depends on recruits. The unprofitable company says as
much in SEC filings:


"Success of our DubLi Network business is dependent on the ability and productivity of our Business Associates.
 


Our DubLi.com revenues are generated through the efforts of our network of Business Associates (our independent
marketing representatives) whose drive individual consumer traffic and business client's customers traffic to the DubLi.com
shopping site. DubLi.com is the product of DubLi Network and, as such, requires the network to penetrate consumer
registrations. To increase our revenues, we must increase the productivity of this network. Therefore, our success depends, in
significant part, upon our ability to recruit, educate, retain and motivate our Business Associates and their ability to expand
their organization network and to generate customers who shop at our shopping portal. Our operating results could be
harmed if our existing and new business opportunities do not generate sufficient interest to retain and motivate existing
Business Associates and attract new Business Associates; or if we fail to educate them about our products in ways that
ensure their success or if we fail to properly support them in their efforts."
 **
 


“The increase was primarily due to an increase in: (i) business license fees from Business Associates as a result of a
higher volume of registrations under the program; and (ii) membership subscription fees from increased sales of VIP
memberships."





So let’s look more closely at last quarter’s revenue.


First, most revenue - $4.9 million – came in from “membership subscription fees”
and “commission income.”


(Source: Company SEC filing)


Associates are required to buy promotional packages that are resold to customers …
recruits also must buy “membership subscription products” to be resold to other
associates.

Ominto lumps in “commission income,” which is apparently miniscule and paid by
merchants who use the company shopping website.


The second source of revenue is “business license fees.”


(Source: Company SEC filing)


Once again, associates pay these fees: “Business license fees are paid by our BAs
and our Partner Program participants. The fees from BAs enable them to sell our
products.”


Ominto also charges recruits a marketing and training “setup fee:”


 “Business Associates (BAs) pay an initial business license fee and Partner Program participants (excluding
not-for-profit organizations) pay a setup fee for the marketing and training services provided by us which
enables them to begin their sales of DubLi.com’s products and services.”


Third is “advertising and marketing programs.” ...

Ominto: Multilevel Marketing � Or Possibly A Lot Worse


Ominto may be operating as a legal multilevel marketing business (MLM). But some
characteristics resemble the classic illegal, unsustainable pyramid scheme.


The company’s 10-K acknowledges the pyramid risk:


“We are subject to the risk that, in one or more markets, our network marketing program could be found not
to comply with applicable law or regulations. Regulations applicable to network marketing organizations
generally are directed at preventing fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as “pyramid” or
“chain sales” schemes, by ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that
advancement within an organization is based on sales of the organization’s products rather than
investments in the organization or other non-retail sales-related criteria. The regulatory requirements
concerning network marketing programs do not include “bright line” rules and are inherently fact-based,
and thus, even in jurisdictions where we believe that our network marketing program is in full compliance
with applicable laws or regulations governing network marketing systems, we are subject to the risk that
these laws or regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by
governmental agencies or courts can change. The failure of our network marketing program to comply with
current or newly adopted regulations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in
general.”


The Securities and Exchange Commission warns that some MLMs are really
pyramid schemes.


SEC enforcement director Andrew Ceresney said complaints regarding pyramid
schemes seem to be increasing.


Participants “profit not from the product they are selling but almost exclusively through recruiting
other people to participate in the program,” said Mr. Ceresney.


While Ominto isn’t making a profit, most revenue appears closely tied to recruits,
more fully described in our sidebar, “Ominto: Revenue Depends On Recruits.”


Mr. Ceresney continues:


“In these schemes, there is usually no genuine product or service. Instead, participants in these schemes
frequently claim to own, or be developing, some sort of ethereal technology service, such as … Internet
marketing through websites …”


“One common characteristic … is the increasing use of new technologies … The use of social media such

Ominto (OMNT) : Seven Reasons We�re Not Buying


TheStreetSweeper issues an Ominto (OMNT) investor alert.


The Boca Raton, Florida company operates an online coupon and cash-back shopping site. The stock took flight
after the struggling company uplisted to the Nasdaq in March. We believe the stock is absurdly overvalued and
prepared to plunge. Issues include:


*This multi-level marketing business requires associates to pay thousands for an “accelerator program” to set up
personal shopping web sites, followed by more fees to stay in the game. The focus seems to be on selling the multi-
level plan to unemployed grannies, retired teachers and down-on-their-luck folks.


*Word is spreading that the multi-level program may not be a dream-maker for associates, after all.


*The plan is not a dream-maker for the company either. Losses rose a stunning 46.86% last quarter, hitting -$4.45
million. Horrible finances have already forced Ominto to close four facilities.

Cryoport (CYRX): Time to Ice This Stock


Cryoport (CYRX) is running investors down a path that’s getting colder and darker by the
second.


The Irvine, California company provides refrigerated shipping containers for the healthcare
industry’s vaccines and other biological items. It doesn’t make money doing that … Never has.


The company discloses: “ substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern.”


The company’s viewpoint is here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper lists the current Cryoport issues
most likely to ice investment portfolios:





*1. Overdone Ballyhooing


When a small company isn’t busy making money – and Cryoport is losing millions – it’s
tempting to brag about how things might be, someday, if only …


Cryoport, its fans and more blatant promoters are promoting what isn’t. And they seem
somewhat successful in convincing others that Cryoport will benefit from any biopharma wins.
Here’s a recent Twitter sampling:


*2.Taking The Bad


If Cryoport wants to try to align itself with what might someday be advances for drug
developers (examples are here : Cryoport provides logistics solution and services for Kite
Pharma’s lead clinical program in cancer immunotherapy, here : Cryoport to support ProMab
Biotechnologies’ Car-T cell preclinical services and here : $CYRX clients $KITE and $NVS
continue to push the envelope…), the company also has to take the bad.


Cryoport had been trying to convince investors that it could potentially supply refrigeration
services at a commercial level for Kite Pharma.


But nobody hyped Kite’s May 8th disaster.


A patient died after taking Kite Pharma’s investigational drug. Though Kite’s KTE-C19 had
been accepted for FDA review in April, the death may obviously doom both Kite and any
associated hoped-for Cryoport benefits.


Cryoport has invested a lot of hope and hype in Kite and/or Novartis getting FDA approval for
hematological cancer drugs. But Cryoport stock is way ahead of itself and the regulatory
process.


It’s all too iffy as FDA approval is definitely not a given. Even if approval occurs, commercial
manufacturing is still a very long, bumpy road. Manufacturing problems aren’t unusual and can
plague even bigger companies. Portola’s anticoagulant drug solution looked like it was a shoo-
in. But Portola was unpleasantly surprised last year when the FDA issued a CRL or complete
response letter. The reason: manufacturing problems and the need for additional data.


Meanwhile, Juno Therapeutics serves as a chilling cautionary note. Last November, Juno
voluntarily put a study on hold following two more deaths of patients in leukemia drug trials,
bringing the total up to five.


Alongside tragic human consequences, Juno’s stock price plummeted and has not recovered.
The former $54 stock now trades around $23.

22nd Century (XXII) Announcements = Promos, Dilution, Institutional Selling


TheStreetSweeper issues a quick update for anyone caught up in 22nd Century Group’s (XXII)
smoke.


The third-party promotions just keep on coming as this off-brand low-nicotine cigarette
company attempts to justify its $165 million market valuation.


Now, the second-hand smoke from this Clarence, New York company (here) may be poised to
kill the average investment portfolio, thanks to:


*Promotions, Promotions, Promotions


The company last Friday hyped a previously hyped meeting with the Food and Drug
Administration … an announcement (here) ultimately tied to paid promotions and stock
dilution.


We’ve seen these “very encouraging and productive” meetings before with other companies.
This hype, in our view, amounts to nothing more than an effort to pump up the stock price. The
press release concludes XXII will simply continue with its modified risk tobacco product
(MRTP) application. This appears to be just self-promotion. No news.


The company's additional recent promotion came as an announcement about an XXII-
sponsored survey on low-nicotine cigarettes.


That's not all, of course. More hype has been puffed out... via third-party promotions.


A hype-maker called TheStockExpert pumped out a series of late-week promotional emails,
including:


“This could be your last opportunity to get in at these levels. Make sure to continue to closely watch XXII for
today because we expect to see this one continue its trend of gains today.”


And this:





The real surprise is what some unbelievably kind-hearted third party has paid to get XXII
pumped:


“TheStockExpert.com has been compensated $12,500 dollars by a third party (Sunrise Media, LLC) for an investor
awareness campaign regarding XXII. TheStockExpert.com was previously compensated $20,000 dollars for an
investor awareness campaign regarding XXII, which has expired.”

Since April 11, the firm has conducted more than 40 sell transactions at prices ~10% to 40%
cheaper than today’s trading level.


Just since June 1, CommScope has dumped more than 170,000 shares of HYGS!


(Source: Company SEC filing, click to see entire list)


CommScope has seen fit to cut its approximate 1.6 million shares owned in 2014 (when it sold
shares  for around $23 apiece) to less than 620,000 shares.


CommScope’s previous ownership exceeding 10% has plummeted dramatically:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


This may be the beginning of the end … this type of selling by a major partner – which is well-
positioned to judge HYGS’ future.


*2. Analysts: No Room For Growth


The stock has recently attracted coverage of a paltry two analysts.


First, Cowen & Co., gives HYGS the rare rating of “Hold,” and a 12-month price target of $9.


Second, Roth Capital (whose coverage is generally not met with great enthusiasm) reiterated
its “Buy” with an $11 price target, two bucks below the ratings given HYGS last year.


(Source: TipRanks)


According to TipRanks, Mr. Irwin has a 46% success rate and an average return of 2.2%.
While Mr. Osborne has a 38% success rate and a negative average return of -17.2%.


HYGS stock is currently nearly at the analysts’ 12-month average price target of $10 …
signifying over 3% downside …


So virtually no room for HYGS to grow.


*3. Analysts Consistently Overestimate HYGS


As pitiful as analysts’ expectations are, HYGS fails to live up to those predictions again and
again.


The company has missed quarterly estimates over the years by 10% to 217%:

If 22nd Century’s (XXII) idea of reduced-nicotine cigarettes worked as well as its paid
promotions, the business might be commercially viable.


While it’s easy to blow smoke at investors, the Clarence, New York company is finding it’s a lot
tougher to produce.


Investors may find the company’s viewpoint here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents the
top reasons we believe this smoking stock will get stomped out.


*Insiders Yell “Sell!”


Average stockholders have gotten what sounds like a sell signal last Friday from none less
than the XXII president and CEO.


CEO Hery Sicignano exercised cashless warrants at $0.60 apiece for 300,000 shares… and
sold off 98,631 shares.


Another executive may be preparing to sell, too. The VP of Research and Development
exercised the right to buy 20,468 stock options at $2 apiece.


*Blowing Smoke: Excessive Promotional Activity


Professionals’ hype machines have gone into overdrive pushing XXII.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 24/226


In the days leading up to the CEO’s stock selling, a couple of promotional outfits, BroadStreet
Alerts and Small Cap Traders, have littered email inboxes with updated hype about the stock.


Another professional promoter, Research Driven Investing, pushed the stock June 7, getting
the advertisement on Yahoo. The firm’s disclosure says in part:


RDI will not be liable to any person or entity for the quality, accuracy, completeness, reliability or timeliness
of information in this advertisement…


RDI adds: “WE ARE COMPENSATED AND ARE BIASED”


A similar outfit called Traders News Source also pushed the stock June 8. The firm discloses:
“Our reports/releases are a commercial advertisement and are for general information purposes ONLY. We
are engaged in the business of marketing and advertising companies for monetary compensation. Never
invest in any stock featured on our site or emails unless you can afford to lose your entire investment.”


More promotions occurred in March and April, plus at least half-a-dozen times last year.


In fact, since March 2014, XXII has been the subject of at least 36 massive campaigns by
various promoters. These “investor relations campaigns” are often paid by some incredibly
kind-hearted third party.

Cancer Genetics (CGIX): Genetically Predisposed To Drop


Despite massive losses, getting busted for Medicare fraud and red-flagged broker reports,
Cancer Genetics (CGIX) is watching its stock shoot up.


 TheStreetSweeper breaks through the smoke and mirrors that obliterate the risky nature of this
biological testing company based in Rutherford, New Jersey.  


Key issues facing Cancer Genetics include:


*$100 million stock shelf. The company just beat down the wall to begin selling a new raft of
stock, posing a significant dilution hazard to current shareholders.


*Historical shareholder destruction. Depends on two stock sales yearly to keep the doors
open. Since inception in 1999 – 18 years ago – the company has accomplished little beyond
paying a $1 million Medicare fraud settlement and consuming cash.


*Multimillion-dollar losses quarterly. Stock jumps ~185% even though losses have
continued, hitting $2.8 million last quarter alone.


*Product is nothing special. Giants like Labcorp, NeoGenomics offer similar tests.


*Rodman & Renshaw/Wainwright special. Sole coverage by troubled broker-dealer is a red
flag; also foretold the recent stock offering. Prepare for potential watering down of current
shares … and plummeting stock price.


Investors may find the company’s viewpoint here. Meanwhile, consider the top seven reasons this company appears
genetically predisposed to destroy shareholder value:


*1 Massive Losses; Strange Stock Action


CGIX is one cash-chomping machine… as shown by the sharp drop in cash and equivalents over the past few
years:


(Source: Bloomberg)


Operating income is precipitously dropping. The chart below shows operating income -  net profit after operational
expenses - from 1Q 2015 to 1Q 2017. The tan blocks show estimated figures in the second and third quarters:


(Source: Bloomberg)


This situation puts CGIX in a tough spot. The company spends millions - about $4.45 million every three months -
more than it makes.


So on March 22, the company had to run out and gather up some restructured heavy debt - $12 million-worth
(costing up to 11.5% interest,  plus warrants for 443,262 shares exercisable at $2.82 per share) - just to keep the
doors open.


And a funny thing happened. The stock rocketed over 74%, at that point taking the year’s full levitation over 200%,
and left us wondering … why … why… why?


*2 Product Is Nothing Special, A Pain


Well, we can’t thank the company products for that stock action. Products include proprietary tests and services,
plus non-proprietary tests and laboratory services.

The proprietary cancer diagnostic test is, unfortunately, very similar to tests produced by rich giants that have
already scratched and clawed their way into the field … leaving little room for CGIX now or in the future.


The rivalry in this field calls forth a comment by Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful.

New Age Beverages (NBEV): Investment Junk Food


New Age Beverages (NBEV) has turned into junk food for investment portfolios.


Right now, this functional beverage company is rolling. We don’t mean it’s rolling in cash.
NBEV has indulged in rolling up other weak companies. We’ve written cautionary notes before
about how roll-ups’ flashy announcements get everyone excited, then they briefly get to claim
acquisitions’ revenue. Everything looks fine for a while.


Then bigger expenses and headaches hit … and often bigger losses … before long, the whole
thing may wash into a roaring abyss. We’ll offer an example below.


This Denver roll-up has gone into a cash-starvation diet that may be resolved with a significant
cash raise.


NBEV was once a little craft beer company that didn’t exactly produce the envisioned Rocky
Mountain high. NBEV sold everything 1 ½ years ago for just $395,650 plus debt. So now it’s
trying tripped out water – so-called functional beverages – in an attempt to compete against
established name-brands produced by industry giants. Drinks include Live Kombucha, Xing
Tea and Aspen Pure, which users can apparently only buy directly from the company.


NBEV’s viewpoint is here and here. Meanwhile, let’s look at why we think it’s time to stop
guzzling the NBEV Kool-Aid …


*Poor Performance; Extremely Expensive


NBEV margins and cash flow to sales ratios are terrible.


Below, we compare key profitability ratios for NBEV versus peers.


(Sources: CFRA/S&P Global, TheStreetSweeper)


But the company’s peers perform far better. NBEV also loses money, while the others make
money.


Nevertheless, NBEV’s price is 37% higher than competing drink companies.

Exact Sciences (EXAS): Exactly The Wrong Investment Right Now


TheStreetSweeper issues an investor warning for Exact Sciences (EXAS).


The Madison, Wisconsin company loses over $780 million as it focuses on a stool-based
colon cancer test. The stock is up partially on news that United Healthcare will cover the
company’s test, Cologuard, recently called “unproven” and “not medically necessary” by the
insurer.


That coverage is great. Except now it’s factored into the stock price. And the pressure’s on
Exact to show that its product plan makes the company worth its $4 billion valuation.


Investors may find the company’s viewpoint here or here. Meanwhile, consider the top seven
reasons we believe Exact Sciences is exactly the wrong investment right now:


*Cash Burn: $13 Million Monthly


Exact Sciences is smoking cash; spending around $2.25 to $2.90 chasing each $1 in
revenue. 


(Sources: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


This quarter will be worse. The company expects operating expenses will increase about $5
million to $6 million. That boosts quarterly cash burn to around $38 million to $39.6 million…
about what’s left in cash coffers.


As expenses ramp, EXAS could tap marketable securities. But why do that if the stock is
trading at record highs? Selling stock now makes sense.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 26/226


*Promotional Comment?


The stock rose even more Thursday following a Barron’s story stating company CEO Kevin
Conroy sees a large addressable market.


The executive’s insinuation that Cologuard could get 30% to 40% of the patient population is
ludicrous. And, in our view, such a comment is irresponsible considering rapidly changing
technology, the field’s well-versed companies and colonoscopy’s indisputable dominance.


*Patients’ Resistance


The comment may be imprudent, too, because while volume is up, Exact’s poop-in-the-box
testing faces resistance by a rather high percentage of patients.


Patient compliance – people who complete Cologuard tests that have been ordered for them -
has dropped from 74% (2014) to 71%  (2015) to 67% (2016) to last quarter’s 67%.


That’s a notable 7% decline from 2014, when Cologuard became the first screening test to
gain FDA approval and Medicare coverage.


Completed tests really matter as Exact’s first-mover advantage slips. Revenue comes upon
delivery of a test result to the doctor who ordered it.


“Laboratory service revenue. Our laboratory service revenues are generated by performing
diagnostic services using our Cologuard test, and the service is completed upon delivery of a
test result to an ordering physician.”


Recent clinical guidance in the Southern Medical Journal compares Cologuard versus the
quick, cheap, non-invasive test known as FIT or fecal immunochemical test. Cologuard is
referred to as sDNA below…


"With sDNA, the patient must self-collect the entire stool and ship the specimen via delivery
agency to the laboratory for analysis. In contrast, FIT requires only one stool sample. Patients
seem resistant to sample their own stool. The requirement of collecting the entire stool and
shipping the specimen for sDNA testing,” researchers wrote, "rather than taking a small
sample for FIT and dropping it off at a local laboratory is concerning for many."

Titan Machinery (TITN): Titanic Risks


Titan Machinery’s (TITN) challenges are exerting titanic forces against the North Dakota
agriculture and construction equipment company.


The company’s struggles are evident in the lower sales and lower guidance reported in its pre-
Memorial Day financial report.


It’s a good thing management doesn’t have to pitch Titan to the entrepreneurs on the TV show
Shark Tank. We can imagine Mark Cuban squinting and scowling as he asks Titan how last
quarter went…


*Another Miss


Last quarter wasn’t so hot. Neither was the previous one, Titan folks would have to say.


Though analysts consistently expect losses, quarter after quarter after quarter, in its pre-
holiday report Titan actually missed estimates once again.


Analysts thought the company would lose 16 cents per share. Bad enough, of course, but not
as bad as what Titan actually lost … 19 cents.


That’s nearly 22% worse than everyone thought.


In the past 6 quarters, Titan’s losses have been worse than the losses analysts anticipated.


(Source: Etrade)





* “The Money. You’re Not Making Any”


And since Titan lost money - US sales dropped 17% versus the prior year and overall revenue
dropped 7% (with 14 more store closures expected amid restructuring cost savings that “will
be less than previously expected”) – the stock can’t even be evaluated in the common method
of trailing Price-to-Earnings.


So, turning to Price-to-Cash Flow, Titan is jaw-droppingly expensive:

Consistently making no money is, well, really unfortunate. So unfortunate that entrepreneur
Kevin O’Leary might reiterate a blunt comment made on Shark Tank:


“The money. You’re not making any…  Do you think any investor up here wants to join you in
that madness? Money’s binary.  Either you make it or you lose it.”


Titan is losing money and losing ground to the competition. While the company lost $5.9

Pulse Biosciences (PLSE): Shock Therapy Doesn�t Cut It


Pulse Biosciences (PLSE) churns out disappointing study results and accelerated losses, yet
the stock has shot up over 400% as unwary investors follow a billionaire’s whims.


The Burlingame, California company is working on technology that shoots electrical pulses at
cells in hopes of annihilating tumors. The materially weak company burned up $8 million last
year alone as it flitted along its non-FDA-cleared, non-product, non-revenue wavelength.


Now, stockholders face shockwaves amplified by the baseless stock action.


Investors may get the company’s viewpoint here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper weighs in,
offering the current points that have this stock pulsing with risks for average stockholders:


*Billionaire Getting Boring?


The mundane Puse had trudged along trading in the $4 to $5 range since its May 2016 initial
public offering. It became a rock star early last February, after the company announced
billionaire investor Robert Duggan’s ~15% stake in the  company. He initially bought stock for
$6.10 per share.


The influential executive has been adding to his stake and news outlets have reported his
frequent filings since then. Below is the recent run-down:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The stock gassed up to $30-plus in March and then cooled off to $20:

Regardless, large institutional investors just do not care. Big institutions hold a miniscule 3%
stake in Pulse as small investors follow along behind Mr. Duggan.


But now everybody seems to be getting a little bored.

Universal Display (OLED): Horror Movie In The Making


Universal Display Corp. (OLED) fans focus on record stock prices and a
commentator’s thoughts … as the company’s biggest commercial licensing deal
fades to black and a major rival steps up.


TheStreetSweeper has seen horror movies like this before. And we don’t want to sit
through another bad sequel.


So we’re sharing seven big risks associated with this company focused on a light-
emission dust used in phone screens.


*1. Biggest License Deal Ends


The New Jersey-based company’s biggest commercial licensing deal … with
Samsung … ends this year:


“Currently, the Company's most significant commercial license agreement, which runs
through the end of 2017, is with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC) and covers the manufacture and sale
of specified OLED display products. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable
in semi-annual installments over the agreement term of 6.4 years. The installments, which are due in the
second and fourth quarter of each year, increase on an annual basis over the term of the agreement.”


The deal put Universal Display on the map in 2011 and generated millions in
revenue. But this year … it looks like a wrap.


*2. Patent Cliff: Barriers to Entry Drop


Patents owned by the company are at the brink of expiration.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 28/226


Indeed, the company’s fundamental patent (“Transparent Contacts for Organic Light
Emitters”) is scheduled to expire this December. Others hit their 20-year patent
protection expiration date as early as next year, as indicated in the SEC filing here.


The patent cliff is significant because Universal Display’s barriers to entry will come
crashing down. Anybody and everybody will then be able to use the technology.


*3. Major Competitor: Merck KGaA


Germany’s Merck KGaA (MRK.MI) is ready to shake up the organic light emitting
diode (OLED) world.


The chief executive of Merck, the world’s largest maker of liquid crystals for flat
screens, told Reuters late last month that the company will forge ahead with new
technologies, “for instance OLED.”


Merck has been in OLED chemical production since 2009. Merck doesn’t like the
light emitting diode margins - Universal Display makes pathetic 23% margins. But
Merck’s renewed interest in light emitting diodes comes now that the company
expects erosion of its dominance in liquid crystals.


Merck will naturally go after Apple, Samsung and every other biggie.


Merck is among dozens of OLED market players, including Dow Chemical and
BASF. Merck plans to lead the market by 2018.


With $15-billion in sales and $900 million in cash (75 times more sales and 9 times
more cash) the Merck monster can squash Universal Display like a bug.


*4. Commentator Spurs Stock


With all due respect to Jim Cramer, we disagree with him this time.


The stock price rose from about $90 on positive financials on May 4 to $116 in the
days that two analysts reported on the stock, plus the CNBC commentator made
positive remarks on May 5 and May 8.





(Source: CNBC)


(Source: CNN Money)


In the second commentary, with the stock around record highs, the TV personality
said he wouldn’t “step in front of this… I would not short it.”


When the price is preposterously high, it seems rather odd - or maybe just a little
tone-deaf -  to draw more people to the stock at that high point.


But just as importantly, Mr. Cramer isn’t always right.

One Horizon Group (OHGI): Penny Stock Land On The Horizon


After a late April reverse stock split, One Horizon Group (OHGI) stock heated up
and within days blasted upward by over 680%, following chatroom promotions and
despite miserable financials. The stock, in our view, is now teetering at the brink of
rapid decline.


Based in Limerick, Ireland (located at Limerick University where the government is
now launching a probe into allegations of misconduct)   the company struggles
within the intensely competitive voice over internet protocol field.


Five key factors amping the risk for stockholders include:


*1. Losing A Fortune


The company loses a fortune every year.


Last year alone, OHGI lost $1.3 million.


Only by deferring payments to vendors, the company softened its losses of $2.1
million from the year earlier.


And OHGI’s working capital deficit hit $1.9 million.


*2. No Cash; Dilution Ahead


Cash-burner OHGI rakes through $325,000 every three months.

Clean Diesel Technologies (CDTI): What Goes Up On Paid Promotions, Must Come Down


TheStreetSweeper releases an update on Clean Diesel Technologies (CDTI). This
Oxnard, California automotive emissions control company's stock has apparently
reacted to a strange pump piece published yesterday.


The piece is particularly concerning because the promoter first says it received no
compensation and at another point states that its pieces are bought-and-paid for.
Federal regulators recently filed charges against firms and individuals connected
with fraudulent promotion of stocks.


Below is the tweet from the paid advertiser, directing people to the advertiser's site:


(Source: Twitter)


The link to the promotional piece is here.


The promoter's report ignores substantial risks affecting CDTI, including:
  


1. CDTI is a cash-burn machine, running on empty. The burn rate is about $3.5
million per quarter. Cash sat at about $7.8 million at the end of the year. So at this
point, it would have barely enough cash to operate another quarter.


2. A cash raise - perhaps stock selling or a debt tap - appears imminent. More
raises are likely ahead, too, with the potential to water down existing stock.


2.Losses hit $23.5 million last year, accelerating total losses to nearly a quarter-
billion bucks. Going concern issues threaten the business.


 
3.The stock rose recently - not on the merits of the company - but on paid
advertisements.


 
4. Catalyst revenue - the chief source of revenue - has dropped as the chief
customer backs away. CDTI reports that entire revenue will end next year.


 
5. Revenue faces additional risk as President Trump has clearly signaled he wants
cuts to emissions control regulations, thus reduced need for CDTI products.





So we explain the downside risks associated with this stock. But the pump
piece author talks unconvincingly about financial figures that seemed fine
and finally concludes that they don't really know what's going on with the
stock ... and ends with this telling bit of information:

Clean Diesel Technologies (CDTI): Heading To The Junkyard


As Clean Diesel Technologies (CDTI) attempts to leave a terrible earnings report
behind, a series of slippery mudholes stretch out in the road ahead.


The Oxnard, California company focuses on emission control products for light
trucks and cars.   


But TheStreetSweeper expects the stock to fall face down in one or more of the
following five mud puddles:


*1. Burning Cash: Raise Ahead


The company is burning cash at the rate of about $3.5 million per quarter.


Cash coffers, at the end of last year, contained just $7.8 million.


At this point, Clean Diesel is practically running on fumes. It should have barely
enough cash to operate another quarter.


The snapshot below summarizes the cash and declining revenue problem:


(Source: CNN Money)


So, Clean Diesel has to raise more money soon.


And since it historically operates in the red, it will continue to search for operating
cash via debt deals or potentially dilutive stock sales well into the foreseeable
future.


Average investors will find little or no relief from the company’s poor financial
condition… a condition that resulted in negative earnings per share of $ -2.71 in
2015 becoming even worse at $-3.84 EPS last year.


*2. Big Losses, Going Concern: CEO Wants Raise


Meanwhile, the company lost $23.5 million last year and overall losses have
accumulated to $223 million.


Auditors have expressed serious doubts about the company’s ability to continue as
a going concern.


Yet guess what is on the stockholders’ meeting next month?


Shareholders will get a peek at the salary of the executives who are steering this
wreck…


(Source: Yahoo)


The disclosure to shareholders includes the salary of CEO Matthew Beale … whose
compensation has accelerated to $1.36 million.

Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (AKTS): $200 Million Company Admits Patent Worth $114K


Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (AKTS) is now priced at an unsustainable
~$200 million valuation.


That kind of market valuation makes no sense for a risky no-product,
old-patent, minimal-revenue, professionally promoted company whose
key stockholder was investigated for manipulating stocks.


The Huntersville, North Carolina company is focused on an RF filter
patent filed by CEO Jeffrey Shealy in 2000. The company hopes its older
technology may eventually compete with well-funded, established
companies whose products help wireless carriers reduce dropped calls.


Investors may find the website here of the company, which has not
answered our numerous calls and emails requesting comment. However,
the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering the information
we've submitted.


In this second part of an investigative series (Part 1 is here),
TheStreetSweeper presents additional reasons we consider Akoustis stock a
major risk to investment portfolios.


*1. Company: Our Patent Portfolio Isn't Worth Much


Regulatory filings state just what Akoustis thinks its patent portfolio is
worth ... $114,000!





(Source: Company SEC filing)


Yet this patent portfolio - worth about as much as a fancy pickup - is
driving the whole company.


*2. Foundering Factory: Losing Millions


The stock has also recently risen on the wings of an Akoustis
announcement of plans to buy an old upstate New York factory referred
to as STC-MEM. The company trumpeted that a university owns the
factory, which it claims historically brings in "about $3 million in
revenue."

Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (AKTS): Deal Guy, Paid Promotions, Discrepancies and Other
Risks


TheStreetSweeper issues an investigative report on Akoustis Technologies (AKTS).


Executive bullet points:


*Significant voids. The company currently lacks a commercial product, filter plant, distribution
plan and ready customers.


*Patently poor. The company is based on a 17-year-old patent for a filter designed to help
carriers improve battery life and cut dropped calls. Current technology has left Akoustis’
patented technology in the dust.


*Mark N. Tompkins owns 14.8% of recent reverse merger Akoustis Technologies. Tompkins
and business partner Adam Gottbetter were investigated for possible stock manipulation of
reverse merged companies. Tompkins wasn’t charged but Gottbetter pled guilty to stock fraud
and just got out of prison last November.


*Tompkins co-owned Akoustis and the Russian shell it jumped into, which took the stock
public in over-the-counter trading.


*Major discrepancies exist between SEC filings and state legal records as to when Akoustis
and its shell were incorporated. The dates are nearly two years off.


*Switzerland. Tompkins manages his Akoustis ownership from luxurious quarters in
Switzerland, filings indicate.


*SEC interest. TheStreetSweeper has filed a verbal and written complaint with the Securities
and Exchange Commission regarding Akoustis activities.


*Recent uplist. The lofty stock accelerated after the NASDAQ uplisting on March 13.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 32/226


*Paid promoters. The stock price continued its flight path after several highly optimistic
Akoustis reports by a paid promoter. 


*Current questions. News of a pending filter factory and incentive possibilities were
misunderstood and apparently further pushed the stock price. Both are problematic.


*Insiders primed to sell. In our view the stock is about 900% overvalued, creating opportune
timing for Tompkins and other cheap-stock-holders to sell their registered, freely tradeable
stock … over 4 million shares.


*Offensive. CEO Jeffrey Shealy smiled and rang the NASDAQ closing bell March 22, 2017.
 Three months earlier, he had joined other insiders who registered to sell their stock. He is
prepared to sell 134,000 shares of his company stock. The company will receive no proceeds.


*Offensive II. Records show Tompkins is prepared to sell about 86% of his stake ... for about $20
million.


*More stock selling. Akoustis burns millions of bucks quarterly. In a couple of quarters at
most, we believe there will be a significant dilutive stock offering in order to generate operating
cash.


*Anyone home? Our repeated calls to the CEO went to an answering machine and weren't
returned. This supposed $200 million company can’t hire an assistant who’ll answer the
phone?


***


Recent reverse-merger, Akoustis Technologies, Inc. (AKTS), we believe is partially
controlled by a hard-partying but secretive man once investigated for possible stock
manipulation of reverse merged companies. This Canadian resident quietly rides
herd over Akoustis from his luxurious apartment in Switzerland, SEC filings indicate.


But the market is unaware of that interest in this company with no meaningful
revenue, no commercial product, a single patent and no clear execution route.


Indeed, the over-the-counter stock uplisted to the NASDAQ a few weeks ago and
caught fire. The market valuation quickly ripped to around $200 million dollars and
the ugly stick of misunderstanding began gently tapping on the market's front door.


The company did not respond to TheStreetSweeper’s requests for comment but
investors may find the company website here. Meanwhile, we present 12 risks
associated with this Huntersville, North Carolina radio-frequency filter developer for
carriers.


*1. The Merger: From Russia With Love


Akoustis Technologies took the cheap and easy route to the public market in May
2015 by merging into a public shell company - a Russian shell dreaming of making
mobile games for Apple.


(Source: Akoustis SEC filing)


The shell existed as a one-man band with Ivan Krikun at the lead. He juggled seven
corporate positions while the band banged out a melody of zero revenue, big losses
and auditors' warnings that "going concern" issues could kill the whole thing. The
Apple games didn’t happen.The business plan fell apart.


The current rendition of Akoustis is very similar: Big dreams. Uncertain pathway to
execution. Going concern issues. Big losses. No meaningful revenue.


Behind the scenes, a deal guy may be adding Akoustis to his collection of stock
toys...


*2. Mysterious Deal Guy; Offshore Accounts


We believe the man behind the Akoustis curtain, Mark N. Tompkins, has been a
moving force behind both the current company and the Russian-owned shell.


His involvement is not just interesting. It's a risk factor. In 2009, federal prosecutors
in Manhattan investigated whether Mr. Tompkins and his business
partner/lawyer/buddy had manipulated stocks.


(Source: YouTube, Adam Gottbetter)


The lawyer/business partner, Adam Gottbetter (pictured above, a key subject in
TheStreetSweeper's report on reverse-merger Ekso Bionics here) pleaded guilty in 2014
to conspiracy to commit stock fraud and received a 1 ½ year sentence.


Mr. Tompkins wasn't charged but the investigation did shine light on Mr. Tompkins
and his moneymaking system of promoting stocks.


Divorce proceedings in 2006 and investigators' subpoenas revealed a living-life-to-
its-fullest, but cautious man who said he didn't maintain business records and

Pulse Biosciences (PLSE): Furiously Peddling Toward More Risk


TheStreetSweeper releases an investor alert regarding Pulse Biosciences (PLSE).


The company is working on a device that uses pulsed electric to possibly treat
tumors and skin problems such as warts. Stock in the zero-revenue company
began trading on the Nasdaq last spring.
 
Investors may find the company website here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents
Pulse's rickety basket of risks:
 
*1. Best Estimate of Pulse's Value: IPO Value
The Burlingame, California company conducted its initial public offering or IPO less
than a year ago ... at a price per share of $4.
We were not thrilled to see that MDB Capital Group acted as co-underwriter. The
riskiest of companies have to sign up with an investor like MDB because most other
banks shy away from such teeth-chattering risk.
 
All too often, struggling companies are underwritten by MDB, enjoy a fleeting stock
rise, then suffer a big drop back.
Second Sight Medical Product (EYES) is one example. The firm managed their
initial public offering three years ago at $17 per share. Shares jumped out at $21
but have declined more than 90% to ~$1.20:


- mmmm(Source: Yahoo)
So Pulse is the same company it was on that warm, sunny day last May 18 when
the stock first began trading on the Nasdaq.


Pulse has no source of revenue, no commercial product and has not made a dime.
 
(Sources: Company SEC filings, TheStreetSweeper)
 
And though Pulse touts its 510(k) submission, the submission is insignificant; the
FDA has decided nothing and a study shows that candidates that make it to phase
II rarely advance to phase III - only 31% move forward. Indeed, the company has
shown no meaningful progress since the initial public offering.
 
So at this stage, TheStreetSweeper can't imagine the stock being worth even 20%
higher than IPO price.
 
But the market has been running headlong, pushing Pulse over 500% since then ... to a price
that we believe remains unjustifiable.
 
*2. Ripping Through Cash
Pulse has been digging the hole deeper and deeper because new medical device
companies simply get doggone expensive just swaying in place. Much less stepping
ahead.


Pulse is already over $12.6 million in the hole.
 
The company is ripping through cash at a rate of about $970 each hour...
approximately $2 million in a quarter...
(Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


So, thanks primarily to its IPO, the company had around $16 million in cash in
December. If you add the $5 million made from the February private stock sale and
subtract current cash burn, there's enough for a while.


But the real money-gobbling begins if the company ever progresses. Then it would have to
add massive costs for everything from clinical trials, to making the device to
marketing and distribution.


To get an idea of the money Pulse would need to approach the human trial stage,
let's consider some  rivals...


*3. Competition: Clobbering Pulse


Competitors in the cancer market include Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Kite
Pharma (KITE).

Research and development is the lifeblood of all the biotechs. But Juno spent 18
times more than Pulse on research and development. And Kite spent over 118
times more on R&D.


(Sources: SEC filings, Marketwatch, TheStreetSweeper)


Clearly Pulse will have to spend much more to catch up with Juno and Kite. And
those two have barely stepped on the gas toward the accelerated spending
required to fuel a biotech.


But even spending hundreds-of-millions on research and development can't assure
success or profit.


These companies are doing much better than Pulse as far as revenue and cash.
But despite their experience, Juno and Kite are still very risky and sickly, too.


(Sources: Company SEC filings, year's end cash, TheStreetSweeper)


Similarly, Pulse revenue, cash, earnings and R&D budget fall far short of a
competitor in the targeted wart and dermatology field, Syneron:


(Sources: Marketwatch, Yahoo, TheStreetSweeper; ELOS last available 2015 numbers)


Biotech carries no guarantees, other than you can bet on burning plenty of cash
chasing a product that may or may not ever become reality.


Case in point: Juno shares recently declined again when the company announced it
would not progress its cancer treatment due to "unfortunate and unexpected
toxicity." The stock reeled late last year after several patients died during clinical
trials.

Care.com (CRCM): Jaw-Dropping Insider Selling, Obscene P/E


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for any investor considering stock in Care.com
(CRCM).


The stock has recently ripped to an unsustainable level and is now dropping back a
bit. We believe the current decline may be the beginning of a larger, well-deserved
unraveling.


The Waltham, Massachusetts company connects caregivers, such as babysitters or
tutors, and families through a website.


The stock ran way ahead of the company's true value, in our view, after Care.com
announced it had beaten guidance expectations.


Though Care.com's operating losses were reduced, traders may have missed that
the company lost $0.7 million in 2016 ... not exactly a hallmark of a booming
business.


Here's the executive summary:





*Extreme Insider Selling: In a year, insiders have dumped 4.3 million shares!
Officers sold > 53,000 shares last week, alone.


 *Outrageously Expensive: The stock's P/E is 114!
 *Outclassed By Competition: The chief rival makes 10 times more revenue and 2 ½


times more earnings. But Care.com is 2 ½ times pricier than the rival’s stock.
 *Tripping Hazard: Care.com is a roll-up. Just one of its eight business acquisitions


has resulted in ~$36 million in impairments.
 *Risky Business: An attorney general is looking into complaints surrounding


Care.com. Consumers have lodged more than 600 complaints against the
company.


Investors may find the company website here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents
the top reasons we think Care.com might be ready to be renamed Care.bomb:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 35/226


The Cambridge, Massachusetts company spun out its initial public offering in
September 2013. Since inception eight years ago, the genomic profile testing
company has lost money ... totaling ~$345 million.


Investors may find the company website here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper highlights
the top issues that we believe will soon crimp this stock.


*1. Stockholders' Earnings Disintegrate, Revenue Drops


Stockholders are suffering a significant decline in earnings from Foundation.


From quarter one to quarter four, losses increased a miserable 79.6%!


                                                                                                   1 Q 2016         2 Q 2016      3 Q 2016          4 Q 2016


(Source: CNN Money, TheStreetSweeper)


Along with these big losses, Foundation's revenue is declining, too:


                                                                                    1 Q 2016           2 Q 2016          3 Q 2016              4 Q 2016


(Source: CNN Money, TheStreetSweeper)


*2. Misunderstood “News”


Foundation's stock has recently flown despite the complete lack of meaningful news  (here) and
its recent release of another disappointing financial report.


Along with lower revenue and higher losses, gross margins have plummeted ... from 57% to
39%.   


So why on earth have shares continued to levitate?


Well, Foundation's financial report chirped out old news regarding an August 2016
announcement that the company has applied for a combination Food and Drug
Administration/Medicare process for premarket approval. And a website
incorporated that old news (here) in a piece about Foundation’s financial report.


It may be that traders misunderstood this line: “advancing its universal, pan-cancer
companion diagnostic assay through the FDA and CMS parallel review process to
decision and launch in the second half of 2017.”


But Foundation actually said that the parallel review process will end in the second half of
2017, they think. That’s starkly different from a commercial launch … which would
come far later after studies and other FDA requirements.


Bottom line: old, misunderstood “news” likely helped levitate the stock price.


*3. Stock Pump


Another factor in Foundation stock's rise may be promotional material spun out by
Paul Mampilly's Extreme Fortunes newsletter sporting a $2,999 subscription rate.

Pulse Biosciences (PLSE): Checking Its Pulse, Finding Nothing

TheStreetSweeper lists the top four reasons we believe the stock is at risk of
suddenly pulsing downward:


*1. Around The Corner: Cheap Stock Sales


When the company IPOd last May, some stock was locked up but has been freely
tradable since November.


However, a massive 4.5 million shares of stock is looming, waiting to be unlocked.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 36/226


"Of the 12,565,451 shares of our common stock expected to be outstanding following completion of
the offering, 2,996,253 shares will be freely tradable without restriction pursuant to Rule 144
following the expiration of the 180-day lock-up previously agreed to by those stockholders
and 4,539,637 will be freely tradable without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 following the
expiration of the 12-month lock-up agreed by those stockholders."


Especially if sold en masse, those millions of shares have the potential to
significantly water down shares owned by existing stockholders.


The lock-release date is just around the corner and some cheap warrants are
attached (worth 299,625 shares) that can be exchanged for stock for as little as
$2.67 apiece ... so why wouldn't those investors sell off if the stock on the release
date is anywhere near current levels?  The stock is set to be unlocked for sale the
first week of May 2017.


The company recently sold $5 million worth of stock to private investors in a Band-
Aid measure, bringing cash to around $5.7 million. But considering the $5.7 million
three-quarter cash burn ...





...or ~$1.9 million per quarter ... while the company is just striding in place, that
money will quickly vanish if Pulse intends to move forward.


So we expect many more stock sales in the future...and more potential for existing
shares to get watered down.





*2. Bad News: MDB Capital Special


MDB Capital Group was the company's underwriter ... and the company has paid
through the nose to get its stock before the public.


1. The underwriter got $1.8 million in discounts.  2. MDB installed its own director as
Pulse chairman of the board. 3. The underwriter also got $1.4 million worth of cheap
stock warrants.


(Source: Company SEC filing)


But does MDB's track record justify the high cost to Pulse and its investors?


Well, things have turned out poorly before for many stocks with strong MDB
participation. Just a few examples include:


The firm handled Second Sight Medical Product's (EYES) initial public offering three
years ago at a stunning $17 per share. TheStreetSweeper warned investors of
Second Sight's risks here, when the stock traded at ~$6.93.


The chart below shows what has happened to the stock. Since MDB's handling of
its IPO, shares have declined ~90%!

*Whenever a company lists its address as a post office box on an island, as IPDN’s
Chinese investor does, it’s a red flag … indeed it’s TheStreetSweeper’s skull and
crossbones.


*Cheap $2 warrants for 246,445 shares of IPDN stock were set free on Feb. 14.
The lender holding that stock may now sell any or all shares.


*If many of those cheap shares are sold, other investors holding more expensive
stock face getting their share value watered down.


*Under Nasdaq delisting threat and eager to please a sell-happy lender, IPDN
pulled a reverse stock split. Stock typically jumps initially before dropping back to

pre-split levels or worse.


*Revenue is dropping, partners are walking away, customers are mad.


*Cash burn’s high, money’s tight and a dilutive stock offering or debt appears likely
within a quarter or two.


Investors may find other viewpoints here and the IPDN website here. Meanwhile,
let's examine five good reasons to dump this stock now:


*1. Warrants: Just Set Me Free.


IPDN has set up the paperwork so a stockholder, White Winston Select, can sell off
the lion's share of its stock...Now.


White Winston loaned $5 million to the company in March 2016. In exchange, in
one piece of the current dilution, the lender picked up some warrants for 246,445
shares of stock for just $2 apiece. Now the lender wants to unload some stock.

Wecast Network (WCST): Scooting Into Oblivion


Wecast Network (WCST) has stumbled along since 1996, when the company was
called Gallery Rodeo International, a Beverly Hills “art business” turned
hotel/gaming business with $327 in cash.


After seven incantations over the decades, Wecast is now a mishmash of China-
linked businesses, controlled by Chinese parties and overseen by a Chinese
chairman toting 40% of the company’s common stock. Meanwhile, the company rips
through millions of dollars, subtly pushing average stockholders closer to watching
their shares get watered down in the future. 


Formerly called You On Demand Holdings, the video-on-demand provider operates
primarily in China. After numerous business changes, Wecast now hopes to
develop a consumer management platform for businesses and consumers ... or
maybe headsets ... or whatever idea strikes their fancy tomorrow.


Here is an executive summary:


*Controversial underwriter Chardan Capital Markets helped take this company
public through a reverse merger into a shell company… a less than auspicious
introduction to the public.


*The stock has surged on two silly announcements of merger agreements … with
companies owned by none other than Wecast’s Chinese chairman. One bogus “merger” is really
a loan deal and the other bogus “merger” is a freebie thrown in apparently because
it’s worthless and easy to hype.


*The chairman’s companies off-loaded to Wecast include a third-tier Chinese
publication. The other company sells scooters and furniture ... not our definition of a
leading “global supply chain” manager.


*The chairman who controls the company is a Chinese entertainment guru who has
helped grind his former company into the ground.


*Wecast's Valentine's Day announcement sounds like pure promotion designed to
drive up the stock. Wecast wants investors to believe that it's really a tech company
... rather than a failed video provider that just bought a scooter company.


*Wecast is more a tiny scooter-and-furniture maker than a global supply chain
manager or video-on-demand provider … or a headset maker. This company can't
decide on or focus on a business.


Investors may find other viewpoints here and the company website here.
Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents the top nine reasons Wecast is a monumental
risk.


* 1. Rat's Nest of Related Party Deals


The stock ran up following two mergers with companies owned by Wecast's chairman.


*Merger 1: Wecast announced the Feb. 1 completion of a merger with Sun Video
Group to buy 51% of M.Y. Products. The company name was changed from You On
Demand to Wecast Network Inc.


The cost: 33.3 million shares of Wecast stock, actually a $50 million loan.


The hype: Sun says it will generate $15 million profit within 12 months of closing or
return the shares.


The hitch: M.Y. Products is owned by Sun Video. Sun is owned by chairman Bruno
Wu. This debt deal is off if Sun Video doesn't reach its target. If Sun Video were

really able to reach $15 million profit in a year, no one would be able to buy it for a
mere $50 million. The deal sounds fishy to us.


*Merger 2: Wecast on Feb. 2 acquires 55% of Wide Angle Group Limited.


The hype: Wide Angle is an industrial/trade media and commerce company. Wecast
gets the Wide Angle shares from BT Capital Global Limited... which is owned by
guess who? Chairman Bruno Wu and his Sun Seven Stars.


The cost: Nothing. "WCST will pay no additional monetary or stock consideration for the acquisition."


The hitch: Wecast's chairman threw in his company, Wide Angle, for free.


Why on earth would he do that? It could be that Wide Angle is worthless. It could be
the chairman wants to promote the stock. Or maybe both.


*2. Who's Your Daddy And You Say He's Selling Scooters?


Let's look at the two companies, owned by the chairman, which are intricately
bound to Wecast.

Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) And The Trump Tales


Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK) may be using Trump tales to hook investors.


The company appears to be allowing distribution of extremely aggressive and
possibly misleading news - even suggesting the new administration has “a desire to
permit” Northern’s stalled project. These claims appear to be nothing but hype used
in an effort to pump up the stock. 


And it’s working. The stock darted upward about 75% after a couple of key stories
hit in late December and January, spreading misconception about Northern.


Northern wants to mine copper and gold deposits along Alaska's Bristol Bay
watershed which supports the world’s biggest sockeye salmon fishery. But the
"Pebble" project has been stalled for three years amid a firestorm of opposition and
a lawsuit with regulators. Northern sued the Environmental Protection Agency in
2014 after the agency used a rare veto initiative to block mine construction before
the company had applied for a federal permit. Northern lost its funding partners a
year earlier after half-a-billion-dollars in costs and  permitting problems. 


And the EPA indicated to TheStreetSweeper on Feb. 9 that the agency isn't ready to
back down.


But let’s look closely at the Canadian company's claims:


*1. The Claim: Desire to Permit


Northern's public comments were used by Bloomberg for a Jan. 23 story in which
the company makes a tall claim that sounds indefensible to us:


(Source: Bloomberg)


So the CEO said that Northern has Trump's backing and the new administration has
"a desire to permit Pebble?" And they'll resolve the issue within 100 days?


Really?


The company has ignored TheStreetSweeper's numerous requests for comment. But a
reliable source and a StreetSweeper research provider did talk to investor relations,
confirmed through Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 emails.


Investor relations said no one with Northern ever spoke to the Trump team or the incoming
EPA team.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 39/226


But after two whirlwind weeks into his presidency, Mr. Trump is cracking his knuckles over all
things Mexican.


On Thursday, the president warned Mexico’s president that he might send US troops across
the border: “You aren’t doing enough to stop (bad hombres.) I think your military is scared. Our
military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it.”


As US-Mexican tensions escalate, Superior is feeling the blows …


*1. Tariff Would Damage Superior


President Trump has just signed an executive order to build a wall along the Mexican border.


And he has announced plans to impose a 20% border tax on all imports from Mexico to pay
for it.


A 20% border tax, or possibly even a 35% tariff, on parts made in Mexico would be a major
blow to Superior.


While Trump’s plan to lower corporate taxes and dampen some regulations might help offset
Superior’s additional potential costs, a 20%-35% tax could be overwhelming, considering:


*Margins are already very low.


*A big import tax on top of terrible margins would likely force Superior to cut its wheel prices.


*2. Uncompetitive Gross Margins


Indeed, the company’s gross margins are an awful 6.25%.


The company is ranked lower than 81% of the industry.


And margins have been in free-fall for years. The average yearly rate of decline is -4.7%.


So Superior enters the Trump era with deteriorating margins that prevent the company from a
sustainable competitive edge.


And the risks just keep growing for this company whose strategic priority is to increase
Mexican manufacturing capacity…


*3. NAFTA Hit: Creating Profitability Mayhem


President Trump made dismantling NAFTA a central theme of his campaign, calling NAFTA
"the worst trade deal in the history of the country."


But NAFTA smoothed the pathway for Superior to expand into Mexico, according to its
website. “The passage of NAFTA led Superior to open its first manufacturing facility outside of
the United States in Chihuahua, Mexico.” 


Now today’s auto parts makers are playing duck and cover for the sake of their plants that
make cheap parts overseas.  


Within days, the president is expected to sign an executive order to renegotiate NAFTA. The
agreement eliminated most trade tariffs between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Magellan Petroleum (MPET): $3 Billion Valuation? Indefensible!



http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?i=26331

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MPET?p=MPET
5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 41/226


Magellan Petroleum (MPET) stock has rocketed into treacherous territory as the
market misunderstands the extreme risks ready to slam the shares.


The Denver, Colorado company has abandoned the oil business amid plans to
reverse merge with Tellurian Investments and eventually build a liquefied natural
gas terminal.


But TheStreetSweeper warns investors that Magellan is one of the most overvalued
stocks we’ve ever seen. The ~$15.6 billion construction costs, $168 million lawsuit,
misunderstood major investment, uncertain LNG demand, fierce competition, 5-year
construction schedule – plus the current technical RSI indicator - all multiply the risk
exponentially.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper shares the
eight top risks expected to annihilate this stock:


*1. Grudge Company: No Revenues


Investors seem excited right now about the planned reverse take-over of private
company Tellurian Investments into Magellan.


Tellurian is the grudge company created by Charif Souki shortly after Cheniere
Energy kicked the former chief executive out the door in late 2015. Mr. Souki wants
the merged company to build a multi-billion-dollar natural gas liquefaction plant in
Louisiana.


Unfortunately, the combined revenue of Magellan and Tellurian over nine months
just barely eclipsed what a fast-food employee makes - $31,000:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


Ironically, the measly revenue came from Parallax Enterprises, which has been
sued by Mr. Souki's former company. Cheniere had loaned Parallax money as the
two made plans for a liquefaction plant joint venture. Cheniere sued, according to
the complaint, when Parallax (wholly owned by Martin Houston,  expected to
become the newly merged company's executive vice chairman, alongside Charif
Souki, chairman) didn't cough up payments.


Meanwhile, there has been substantial doubt about Magellan's ability to continue
operating. Company filings say Tellurian is in bad shape, too.


"Because Tellurian’s assets do not currently generate revenues, the combined company
is also likely to experience liquidity constraints."


*2. Magellan Stockholders' Ownership Decline


Under terms of the merger awaiting shareholder approval in February, each share
of Tellurian will be converted into 1.3 shares of MPET.


Former Tellurian investors will walk away with almost the entire company ... about
96%.


Magellan stockholders will find themselves on the wrong side of this deal. They will
be left with just a sliver of the company ... just over 3%.


*3. Unjustifiable After-Merger Valuation


As it turns company control over to Tellurian shareholders, the merger will
dramatically increase Magellan's current outstanding share count of 5.88 million. At
the current lofty share price, Magellan winds up with an unconscionable market
valuation:

campaigns.


The Denver, Colorado company has lost $20 million since shares in the marijuana-
users social network first began trading on the OTC Markets in April 2015. Despite
MassRoots' poor finances, the stock has risen 126% over the past three months...
including a 6% one-day jump on Thursday.


The idea of connecting pot heads arose back in 2013 among a group of 20-
something friends.


"I thought up MassRoots when I was smoking weed in my college friend's
apartment," co-founder Isaac Dietrich told CNN Money of the idea of sort of a
Facebook for pot smokers.


"I wouldn't want my grandmother to see a picture of me taking a bong rip every time
she logs into Facebook," said Mr. Dietrich.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents
the highlights as we begin to dig into this risky stock.


*Promotional Dependence


Third parties have shelled out about $700,000 since September to promote
MassRoots. That figure is far greater than the $100,000 plus shares that
MassRoots is paying for its acquisition, online ordering company Whaxy.


These incredibly kind-hearted third parties have paid for at least 48 campaigns to
promote a penny stock company that lost $3.5 million just last quarter.


TheStreetSweeper has requested an interview with MassRoots and a couple of
promoters to discuss who's behind the promotions and why. The companies have
not responded.


Promoters pushed out 10 of these MassRoots "awareness" campaigns in
December, according to data gleaned from stockpromoters.com. The snapshot
below shows two recent promos.


(Source: stockpromoters)


And the hits just keep coming ... As recently as Thursday, Jan. 5, MassRoots
promoters blasted out more email promos. The disclosure for the promo below
warns that the promoters may hold and liquidate stock positions in the advertised
company without notice, even after they have made positive comments about the
company.

Skyline Corp. (SKY): Falling Back To Earth

flashy multi-billion-dollar UK company with nearly the same ticker symbol.


Booming Skyline stock is now swooning a bit as the market begins to understand
that news of a plan to take over media giant Sky Plc may have been inadvertently
advancing Skyline stock. 


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents
the top issues threatening those invested in the mobile home manufacturer.


UPDATE: Today's Sky Plc news did erroneously end up in Skyline's news feed,
once again:





*1. SKY.L News Appears In SKY's News Feed


Skyline stock took off on a rollercoaster ride last Friday.


We believe the stock gained much of its strength that day because Skyline's news feed
contained news that Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox had made a bid to buy Sky

***


(Source: Yahoo, TheStreetSweeper)


Skyline's stock had been headed downward until about an hour after Sky's news
erroneously appeared in Skyline's news feed, at which time the stock began to
climb:


(Source: Yahoo Finance)


Investors who took a cursory glance at Skyline's news feed may not have taken the
time to understand the vast differences between the two companies...or how
extremely unlikely it would be for Murdoch to show the slightest interest in Skyline.


Skyline Corp. began manufacturing mobile homes in the 1950s in tiny Elkhart,
Indiana, population 51,421. Skyline has $224 million in revenue and $8 million in
cash. The ticker symbol is SKY.


But Sky Plc. is a British company whose parent company is 21st Century Fox and
has $11.96 billion in revenue plus $2 billion in cash. The ticker symbol is SKY.L.


Sky Plc predictably shot up on the 21st Century Fox bid news:


(Source: Yahoo, TheStreetSweeper)


But the news that understandably spurred Sky Plc. has nothing whatsoever to
do with Skyline mobile homes.
So the blurb is deceptive when it is part of the Yahoo Finance news feed for
Skyline. Now it needs to be deleted.


We believe this is the second time a Skyline stock surge may be linked to the wrong
story getting into Skyline's news feed.


Last summer, we wrote about investors apparently buying Skyline on the news that
Sky media planned to launch a new TV channel in the UK. One line in the Yahoo
story may have generated even more misplaced frenzy: "Fox - owned by Rupert
Murdoch - has a 39% stake in Sky..." referring to Sky Plc, of course, not the mobile
home company.

Ingram Micro (IM): Leaked Documents Could Jeopardize Buy-Out


TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert for Ingram Micro (IM).


Leaked Chinese government documents indicate the $6 billion acquisition of Ingram
could be in trouble.


In February, Ingram Micro announced China-based Tianjin Tianhai Investment
would pay $38.90 per share cash to acquire Ingram.


But now a Chinese company will not be allowed to acquire a company for $1 billion
or more that is not in their core business, suggest new Chinese regulations leaked
to the Chinese media.


Under the buyout deal, Ingram Micro would become a subsidiary of China-based
HNA Group specializing in logistics, aviation, financial services and tourism. HNA is
a major shareholder of Tianjin Tianhai, which focuses on shipping, logistics and
financing.                


California-based Ingram Micro would be outside the Chinese companies' core
business because it is an information technology company.


Below is a partial copy of the photographed document said to be from the People's
Bank of China conference record, indicating the central government likely has
already passed the regulation on to the bank. It's not perfectly clear whether the
restrictions would institute an actual ban or more intensive scrutiny, but the
economic issues demand that China reduce its capital outflow:

Reform Commission, the guideline mentioned above should be followed.


Our interpretation, along with that of reputable third-party Chinese speakers, is that
other government departments must follow the "no filings" and "no approvals"
guidelines. The exception would be if undefined "relevant departments" have
already approved the foreign investment.


The South China Morning Post states the ban would be effective from now until
September of next year.


The declining value of the yuan, as documented in numerous news stories, has
pressured China to cut down on assets flowing out of that country.


Since the documents are in Chinese and have just been leaked, we believe very
few U.S. investors are aware of the regulations that could doom Ingram Micro's
acquisition.


*2. Other Chinese Buy-Outs Suffer


The leaked documents reached the ears of some investors in Changzhou, China-
based Trina Solar (TSL), a billion-dollar company which sells solar products to
power plants and grid operators.


The company had received a definitive agreement from the parent company to pay
$11.60 for each American depositary receipt. Trina called a Dec. 16 shareholder
meeting to vote on the merger that would take the company private. 


The stock had been trading around $10.33 over the past month but reacted quickly
following a couple of tweets Nov. 28 about questions raised by the leaked
documents:

Airgain (AIRG): Epic Rise, Epic Decline


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for investors of Airgain (AIRG), a recent IPO that
is prepared to wipe away a ton of shareholders' stock value.


Investors bought into the wireless network antenna distributor when it first offered its
stock to the public last summer. The stock has flown nearly 200% in the last three
months.


But now the company is planning a massive follow-on offering. Yes, another stock
sale already after the generation of $40.4 million from private stock sales,
convertible notes and the IPO. Investors are witnessing the relative calm before the
storm of shares hit the market and spark a stock price decline.


Below are TheStreetSweeper's top six reasons this stock is looking to get smashed:


1. No Thanks


Airgain filed a registration statement at 5 p.m. Nov. 23, shortly after most investors
took off for the Thanksgiving break.


Airgain will be able to sell $20 million worth of stock, with another $6 million for the
underwriters' option. Insiders will also be able to sell $20 million in stock ... and all
those proceeds go to those stockholders rather than Airgain.


At the current price, about 2.3 million shares may be released into the market.

*2. Why This Follow-On Offering Is Dangerous


The price of a stock typically drops after a secondary offering because IPO
investors' level of ownership decreases with the increase in shareholder base.


The chart below demonstrates how a seemingly small jump in outstanding shares -
from 7.6 million to the new estimated level of 9.88 million - makes a big difference in
the early investor's value:


(Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


Aigain's plans could conceivably change but based on the current situation, Airgain
IPO investors' shares could face a jaw-dropping 23% devaluation.


And investors have just been exposed to the possibility of watered down shares ...


*3. Dilution Potential Begins Now


This secondary offering dwarfs Airgain's $12 million initial public offering at $8 per
share.


For its IPO in August, Airgain registered 1.5 million shares and locked up another
5.7 million shares plus another 1.05 million in stock options.


Now the underwriter has just released the lockup restrictions, effective after market
close Nov. 28.


So all those shares that would have been locked up a couple more months have
been set free so those lucky shareholders - including officers and directors - can sell
their stock

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 48/226


here, TheStreetSweeper releases the five top reasons to avoid this unfolding
investor nightmare.


*1. The SEC Subpoena


The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation into
Fenix's financial reports.


Fenix disclosed on Oct. 13 that it had received a subpoena from the SEC's Chicago
office demanding that company documents be turned over.


The SEC seems to be scrutinizing the company's accounting methods, internal
controls and recent change in auditors (on July 8, auditor BPO was dismissed, a
red flag event).


"The SEC inquiry appears to be focused on the Company’s recent change in its independent registered
public accounting firm, its previously announced business combinations and related goodwill
impairment charge, the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and its inventory
valuation methodology."


The filing of a subpoena indicates the inquiry is now a formal SEC investigation,
according to the SEC's "How Investigations Work." Such investigations are often
drawn out and end poorly for the company.





*2. Late Financial Report


Fenix rolled up 11 companies into one and completed its initial public offering in
May 2015. As TheStreetSweeper has described many times before, things don't
always go too well with roll-ups.


Fenix hinted at big troubles ahead through its numerous notices of delayed financial
reports.


In fact, since the summer of 2015, Fenix has filed notice that its yearly or quarterly
financial reports would be late a total of six times.


The most recent - the delay of the third quarter financial report - was filed Nov. 15.


"The Company’s filing of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 has been
delayed due to the transition time necessitated by the Company’s recent change in its auditors. This delay could
not have been eliminated by the Company without unreasonable effort and expense."
 
"More specifically, the delay is attributable in large part to the complexity of accounting for the Company’s multiple
business combinations, the coordination of the transition of responsibilities between the Company’s prior and new
independent registered public accounting firms, and additional procedures on purchase accounting and inventory
following the Company’s recent receipt of a subpoena from the Chicago Regional Office of the SEC requiring the
production of various documents."
That notice followed another bombshell notification ...


*3. Loan Covenant Bombshell


The financial report is also apparently on hold because the company was "not in
compliance with a certain loan covenant." And according to the Aug. 16 late filing
notification, the lender hasn't given Fenix the needed written waiver. Here's the
broken covenant reference:


"The extension is necessary due to the transition time necessitated by the Company’s recent change in its
auditors. This delay could not have been eliminated by the Company without unreasonable effort and expense."


"In addition, the Company was not in compliance with a certain loan covenant in its credit facility and had not yet
received a written waiver from the lender for such non-compliance as of the due date of the Form 10-Q. The
Company has been in discussions with the lender with respect to the written waiver, which the Company expects to
receive."


So the covenant breach is a bombshell because investors are on notice now that
Fenix's track record will likely make it more difficult for the company to borrow
money.

Some significant investors have gotten fed up and dumped all of their

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 49/226


So big sell-outs begin TheStreetSweeper's list of reasons we believe this
stock is primed to drop long before the studies or permits are ever
completed for the Pebble Mine project.


*Big Investors Back Away


Investors should not be fooled by this Canada-based shell company's
flaunted "Pebble Partnership." The partnership consists solely of Northern
Dynasty Minerals, now that Anglo American has backed away.


In fact, companies have backed out of the ill-conceived plan like crazy.


*Mitsubishi Corp.


In 2007, Mitsubishi became a major shareholder, even increasing
ownership to 11% by 2009.


In February 2011, Mitsubishi divested every single share of Northern.


*Rio Tinto


In 2007, Rio Tinto became a ~19% owner when it bought 9.4 million
shares of Northern for $10 apiece.


But Rio Tinto divested all shares in April 2014.


*Anglo American


After wasting more than half a billion bucks - $573 million to be precise
-  Anglo American withdrew from the partnership.


Following its investment in 2007 and six years of paying for lawyers and
studies for the Pebble project, Anglo gave up its half of all rights to the
project in December 2013.


*Amber Capital; Cutter


More recently, Northern has been able to attract a few no-name
investors. But even some of those are selling out. Grand Cayman-based
Amber Capital Management sold out its 602,982 shares and Cutter & Co.
sold its 10,000 shares the third quarter.


So Northern will find it difficult if not impossible to find large reputable
investors after losing so many significant partners.


*Enough Losses To Go Around


While Northern has been unable to generate much more than litigation
with the Environmental Protection Agency, it has generated plenty of
losses. In the past four quarters alone, Northern's losses have
approached a gut-wrenching $34 million.


The figures below are in thousands of dollars.


(Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


Much of that money, about $1.9 million or ten times more than the
previous quarter, went toward share-based compensation.


The company handed out 6.2 million stock options to insiders. The
chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer also received
compensation of ~639,000 restricted share units and ~458,000 deferred
share units.


The company is important to insiders for another reason ...


*Contract: Scratching Backs


The company is paying millions to a private company owned by Northern's leaders.

Trump's Obamacare Promise: Teladoc's Code Blue?


President-elect Donald Trump's dump Obamacare pledge could be Teladoc's code
blue.


Obamacare has been a luscious target for companies like Teladoc (TDOC),
releasing a veritable army of telemedicine companies onto Wall Street in the last
few years.


Obamacare  "is certainly an accelerator for us," Teledoc CEO Jason Gorevic said in
a September 2014 article.


In a press release titled "Obamacare creates greater need for telehealth
innovations," Teledoc emphasized Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as
a telehealth driver. The release announced new board members David B. Snow and
U.S. Senator William Frist, M.D., who said the ACA “has infused an additional 8
million patients into the health care system ... Teladoc is an innovative and effective
solution for addressing the current access barriers to primary care..."


And in its annual report, Teladoc wrote of the risks of ACA:


The impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the
healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Our revenue is dependent on the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare
spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other
influences. The PPACA made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and increased
access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.


But the catalyst is a "catastrophe," according to the president-elect. Mr. Trump
pledged that after he won the election, he would convene a special session of
Congress to repeal the ACA:


(Source: NBC News/YouTube)


"Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it. And we will do it very, very
quickly," he said in a Nov. 1 healthcare policy speech.


The day after the election, Republican leaders promised that they will "hit the
ground running." Getting rid of Obamacare is a top priority.


Investors may find other viewpoints on Teladoc here. Meanwhile,
TheStreetSweeper takes a closer look at the Teladoc foundation that is precariously
propped up by Obamacare.


*Cash Burn; Dilution Ready


Teladoc's business of connecting patients to doctors by webcam, app or phone has
limped along for 14 years on loans plus private and public stock offerings - losing
money since inception.


The cash burn rate is ~$14.6 million per quarter, which places a mighty squeeze on
Teladoc's $44 million cash and equivalents.


And as many assumed Obamacare would be relatively safe with Hillary Clinton in
the White House, company managers said that cash and borrowings would last "as
we exit 2017."


Still, Teladoc prepared to plug any cash hole by issuing more stock.


The shelf of shares registered Sept. 20 may be sold in any amount from time to
time, giving company the power to dilute.





APPROXIMATE DATE OF COMMENCEMENT OF PROPOSED SALE TO THE PUBLIC: From time to time after the effective
date of this registration statement.
So at the current stock price, Teladoc would be able to sell about 17 million shares.
This means more than another third of shares outstanding could hit the market.

aggregate of common stock identified above, in each case from time to time in one or more offerings.
"
The registration, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Oct. 5, also cleared the path for unnamed selling stockholders to unload 2 million
shares. Sellers will get all proceeds. Not one dime will go to the company.


*Losses: Analysts Expect More Of The Same


Normally optimistic analysts offer a rather poor prognosis for this year and next for
Teladoc:

Those analysts apparently noticed that Teladoc got a big boost from its $163 million
initial public offering last year and saw revenue grow from $26 million to $32 million
last quarter (with a ~$4 million revenue assistance from the July 2016 HealthiestYou
acquisition) ... while earnings have been mired in red since the beginning.

Skyline Medical (SKLN): Going Down The Drain


While Skyline Medical (SKLN) hasn't turned a penny's profit in 14 years, it's sure
learned how to dilute stockholders' shares.


Shares have blasted up recently, placing the medical device company's quivering
finger on the trigger to continue draining share value.


The Eagan, Minnesota company - previously saddled with the gag-worthy name of
"BioDrain Medical" -  offers a system that drains fluids from patients using standard
surgical tubing.


Here's a bird's eye view of the reasons Skyline is a highly risky investment:


1. Skyline is low-cash, high-cash-burn and has sold only one unit since 2015.


2. It funds operations solely on a loan, convertible debt and stock offerings.


3. The company is under threat of being delisted from Nasdaq.


4. It recently filed a $20 million offering. Those shares can be sold at any moment,
representing a significant dilution event.


5. The firm depends on reverse stock splits and professional stock promoters to
boost the stock price.


6. Skyline repeatedly touts an unfortunate Polish-American partner; the market falls
for it.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, let's look more closely at the
factors conspiring to dump this stock.


*1. Financial Despair


Skyline had always been in serious financial straits but things had grown much
worse by the end of last quarter.


The company had been crippling along on ~$22 million in debt financing and
offerings, including the public offering of August 2015.


Skyline had given up on even trying to sell its surgical drain product Streamway
FMS. In the entire first half of 2016, they hadn't sold a single unit.


"There were no sales of STREAMWAY FMS units in the 2016 period, as sales
efforts were curtailed in late 2015 due to our concentrated efforts on customer

management. The ramp up in our sales efforts following our public offering have not
yet resulted in sales of units."


Skyline's cash had predictably tanked and the burn was hot and high:


(Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


Skyline must be getting used to such trouble ...


*2. Despair Deepens: Nasdaq Delisting


Skyline stumbled and fell at the very beginning.


The company first tried to sell shares in the public market in September 2014. But
factors such as ongoing operating losses - Skyline lost $6.5 million in 2014 and lost
another $4.4 million the next year -  delayed its  public offering until August 2015. 


Not long after Skyline's delayed offering, Nasdaq warnings arrived saying the stock
was at risk of losing its listing.


That was no surprise because at times, investors could have picked up five or even
20 shares of Skyline for the price of a latte.


The stock was failing both Nasdaq's $1 per share price minimum and the $2.5
million minimum shareholder equity requirement.


Carl Schwartz, a dentist and then-interim CEO, said during a September update-
proxy conference call that shareholders needed to approve three proxy items,
including a proposed reverse split. The company simply didn't have the luxury of
time:


"We believe the only practical way to meet the NASDAQ requirement in time, or to
be eligible for an extension, is to get approval now for a reverse split."


Shareholders approved the measure. They understood all too well that a delisting
would push the stock to the dreaded over-the-counter bulletin board where sickly
companies typically go to die.


*3. Reverse Stock Split


So on Oct. 28, Skyline conducted what it fruitlessly hoped would be a Nasdaq
listing-saving 1-for-25 stock split:





(Source: Yahoo Finance, TheStreetSweeper)


The desperate measure didn't change the value of the stock one bit. These reverse
splits increase the stock price awhile and later serve as an ugly footnote to
companies that go on to under perform.


The reverse split has pushed the share price to $1 or more for the past seven days
(minimum requirement is 10 consecutive trading days).


But the stockholder equity rests well below the $2.5 million minimum:

Robot Reboot Will Fail To Transform TransEnterix (TRXC)


Like the evil robotic transformer Starscream,TransEnterix (TRXC) just keeps
transforming itself, returning to the battlefield again and again.


Each time the company switches course, it strings investors along for a long,
thrilling build-up followed by yet another dramatic failure.


Though the experimental surgical robot company has been so busy rebooting, sales

So we believe this newest transformation will ultimately send this Morrisville, North

TheStreetSweeper would like to chuck this stock now...


*1. Hyped Stock

rumors or "something is cooking" hype and not one in ~75 dares to offer a less than
bullish opinion on the stock:

Retail investors got pulled into the stock early in the year partially because, as one
analyst noted, the stock was the subject of a "constant newsletter pump from
January to March by Money Map Press (to be clear, TransEnterix was not behind
the pump/did not compensate anyone for the newsletter pump)."


And this gag-worthy video probably pulled in a few folks:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 54/226


(Source: YouTube)


Blue Horse Shoe Stocks, Penny Stock News and Biotech Insider Alert have all
jumped into the promotional pandemonium.


Such promotions, often paid for by some mysterious third-parties, are always red
flags. Real companies with real products or at least real promise don't depend on
gags and hype.


*2. Multiple Failures


That sort of promotional effort is needed to draw in new, unwary retail investors
when a company fails again and again and again...


Failure Number 1: The company entered the public market via a reverse merger with
SafeStitch in September 2013 that cost ... prepare yourself ... $94 million. That
stock-and-cash deal went for a company with virtually no sales, property or assets.
TransEnterix booked an unbelievable $93.8 million to goodwill.


That's quite the deal, especially considering that TransEnterix actually said in a
letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission:


"As previously discussed, the projections for SafeStitch show that a profit is never
expected to be attained."


Failure Number 2: The company's Spider surgical system, a manual laparoscopic
system, got cleared in Europe in 2011 ... and cleared by the US Food and Drug
Administration in 2009.


But doctors didn't like the Spider and sales were almost nonexistent. Spider was
discontinued on Dec. 31, 2014.


Failure Number 3: SafeStitch had received FDA clearance to market its hernia repair
stapler, AMID HFD, in 2010, and also CE Mark approval in Europe. Sales began
and stopped in 2010. After again getting FDA clearance in 2012, US sales
resumed.


But no royalties were paid, implying no sales, in 2013 or 2014 under TransEnterix'
watch. AMID was discontinued by Dec. 31, 2013.


*3. Another Failure: SurgiBot Rejected


The FDA recently handed Failure Number 4 to TransEnterix when it rejected the
company's application to sell the SurgiBot robot system in the U.S. The company
announced the rejection on April 20, 2016.

(Source: YouTube video of Adam Gottbetter singing "Take Me, I'm Yours" with Squeeze)


... even a money raise for shock jock Howard Stern's favorite strip club.


Mr. Gottbetter became a key figure behind Ekso's private placement offering in
January and February 2014 - Mr. Gottbetter's entity and sub-agents received ~3
million warrants exercisable at $1 per share, plus $3.03 million in commissions for
handling the private placement.


But the good times came to a screeching halt.


Seven months after Ekso's PIPE, Mr. Gottbetter was sentenced to 1 1/2 years for
stock fraud.


His guilty plea was in connection with schemes to manipulate three other
companies' stock "with a view to selling his own shares at a profit." He's reportedly
been involved with more than 160 companies but the  companies named in the
SEC criminal complaint were Kentucky USA Energy (KYUS, bankruptcy), Dynastar
Holdings (DYNA, now $0.05, little or no trading) and HBP Energy Corp. (HBPE,
now $0.00).


(Source: SEC)


The Securities and Exchange Commission had this to say about Ekso's former
investment banker:


"The SEC alleges that Adam S. Gottbetter orchestrated promotional campaigns that
touted the prospects of microcap companies and enticed investors to buy their
stock at inflated prices so he and his cohorts could sell shares they controlled and
reap massive profits."


"During one meeting in New York City, Gottbetter complained about the difficulties
of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the only other way to
make so much money so quickly."


When the trade publication QMed wrote about Mr. Gottbetter’s jail time for stock
manipulation, the publication posted this comment from Ekso:


(Source: QMed)


But Ekso apparently did not break ties with Mr. Gottbetter's law firm after his plea.


In the company's April 2016 filing regarding Ekso's private offering, we see that Mr.
Gottbetter's entity, Gottbetter & Partners, examined the validity of the stock offering.


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The SEC broke ties with the attorney last year due to the SEC complaint and Mr.
Gottbetter's guilty plea. In a remedial action dated June 23, 2015, the SEC
suspended Mr. Gottbetter from practicing before the commission as an attorney:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 56/226


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents
an executive summary on the Ekso investment risks:


*The company went public via a reverse merger with a Chile-based shell, followed
later by a reverse stock-split.


*Despite pleading guilty to criminal stock manipulation charges, Ekso's investment
banker remained tied to the company through his law firm, an Ekso filing indicates.


*Potential dilution looms. In an August stock sale, Ekso greatly reduced the price of
warrants and preferred shares, which may pose potential dilution following the Nov.
7 lockup release. Also, another 195,313 share unlock occurs on Dec. 1, 2016.


*Ekso partners are signing up with rivals.


*Ekso enjoys very little institutional interest and some institutions have sold their
Ekso stock.


*Professional stock promoters are trying to increase the stock price.


*Executive compensation exceeds $3 million.


*Sales are low and plunging to just $1.6 million last quarter, while operating losses
hit $9.4 million.


*The cash burn rate is ~$7 million or 4 1/2 times sales last quarter.


*Persistent negative cash flow.





Now we'll step back four years, when the investment risks were beginning to form.


*1. Background: Building Risk


Ekso took a rather unconventional route to getting listed on the Nasdaq.


It began with PN Med Group, a company operating out of its president's home in
Santiago, Chile. PN Med initially sold shares for $0.02 in its May 2012 public
offering. The two-person company planned to use the president's car to distribute
medical supplies made in China to clinics in Chile. But by the end of fiscal year
2013, it had managed nothing more than $16,949 in losses and no revenue.


This sort of shell company is just what companies look for when they're planning the
cheap, fast alternative to going public.


So Ekso spotted PN Med. On Jan. 15, 2014, the companies conducted a reverse
merger into Ekso Bionics, with plans to develop and sell "bionic human
exoskeletons." Concurrently, the company completed a complicated deal involving
bridge notes and the Gottbetter-managed private placement resulting in a $1 per
unit alternative public offering.


But the new Ekso stock didn't catch on and by early 2016 fetched only about $0.85
per share. So the company pulled a 1-for-7 reverse stock split on May 4, 2016,
pushing the post-split price to $5.44 per share on June 1.


The share price plugged along at ~$6 through the terrible July 28 quarterly earnings
report that revealed eight sales to rehab centers and a $10 million ($-0.61/share)
loss.


Then the stock price got predictably hammered in the Aug. 9, 2016 follow-on public
offering of 3.75 million shares at $4 per share. Though Ekso tried to soften the blow
by leading the press release with news that the stock had been uplisted, the stock
that traded for ~$6.22 plunged 37% to $3.94 in one day.





                                                                                                 (Source: Yahoo Finance)





Now this Richmond, California exoskeleton maker just continues to heap risk on top
of risk...


*2. Adjusted Prices Favor Insiders, Dilution Looms For Average Shareholders


That August raise generated about $14 million but came stacked with preferential
treatment for some shareholders.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 57/226


The company greatly lowered the price at which both warrants and preferred shares
can be converted to common stock.


"Holders of our Series A preferred stock will be entitled to an anti-dilution adjustment as
a result of this offering, which will result in dilution to the holders of our common
stock, including the shares issued in this offering “ and “— The exercise price of
certain of our outstanding warrants may adjust as a result of this offering, and the
exercise of such warrants would result in dilution to our stockholders.”


So the conversion price of the preferred stock has been adjusted down from $7.07
to $3.74 per share."


And the warrants that would have carried an $8.75 exercise price were adjusted
down to the bargain basement price of just $3.74 per share.


The filing includes this ominous note:


So these cheap shares owned by insiders will be released from the 90-day lock-up
about Nov. 7, posing significant dilution potential for average shareholders.


*3. Partners Switch To Rival Technologies

Investor Alert: Resolute Energy Corp. (REN) Downside Risk


TheStreetSweeper issues a critical alert for Resolute Energy Corp. (REN) investors.


The Denver, Colorado-based oil and gas company's stock blew up to the year's
high, after announcing an acquisition and millions of dollars of new debt. 


TheStreetSweeper highlights the key reasons we consider this stock very, very risky
right now.


*Outrageously Expensive Acquisition


It may sound ridiculous for a company reporting $424,000 in cash and a net loss of
$-36.9 million ($-2.44/share) in June to announce plans in October to spend $135
million.


But that's exactly what happened.


REN on Friday completed the acquisition of oil and gas property in Texas for $135
million. The deal consists of $90 million cash and 2.1 million in common stock.


We might wonder where they came up with all that money. Well, REN is able to
accumulated another 3,295 acres in the Delaware Basin by tapping its revolving
credit facility and cranking out some new preferred stock.


The owners of the 62,500 shares of new preferred stock will be eligible for
dividends that common stockholders will not enjoy. And those preferred shares are
convertible at any time at ~$29.53 per share.


So the stock is currently trading above the initial conversion price, meaning dilution
for existing shareholders.


*Blind Faith


REN is acquiring properties from Firewheel, a teeny oil company reporting only $4.3
million revenue over the six months ended June 31.


These properties "contain estimated proved reserves of 6.2 MMBoe with PV-10 of
$45.8 million."


So REN has spent about three times the estimated value of reserves for production that
may or may not pan out. This could be a very expensive disappointment for REN,
whose own yearly production level has dropped ~4% to 7% from the previous two
years.


*Short Squeeze


The enormous stock rally appears to be in part due to a short squeeze.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 58/226


The market must have been smoking weed when it ran up the stock in 22nd
Century Group (XXII) to the highest levels of the year.


The cigarette company - which shares space in a Clarence, N.Y. office with a
private cigarette company and a dentist -  lost a stunning $11 million last year and
$2.8 million just last quarter.


The company is researching genetically engineered cannabis but focuses on
genetically modifying tobacco to produce high and low nicotine products.


The main products include high-nicotine and low-nicotine cigarettes called Red Sun
and Magic, very low nicotine cigarette Brand A and very high nicotine cigarette
Brand B, Spectrum cigarettes used in research and the X-22 smoking cessation aid.


Despite the stock rally, XXII has been swirling within a smoky venue of paid
promotions - a lawsuit blocking key market entrance - heavy cash burn - poor
financials - looming warrants - failed study endpoint - likely inability to get modified
risk tobacco product (MRTP) labeling - and expected inability to nab a partner for
phase 3 testing.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper highlights
the top reasons we think XXII will end up burning investors:


This stock has been stoked by a series of paid promotional campaigns at a cost of
$15,000 to $30,000 per campaign... Paid for by third parties.


(Source: stockpromoters; click for full list)


XXII promotions consist of a stunning 14 campaigns this year, with most hype
emailed to investors in May.


Many of these promotions suggest XXII could get MRTP labeling.That's modified
risk tobacco product labeling from the Food and Drug Administration. The labeling
would be a key marketing tool because a tobacco company can't legally make
reduced risk claims without it.


Despite the promotions, much evidence suggests that XXII will not get MRTP labeling ...


*2. XXII Failed Study, Swedish Experience Foretell Doom


It's highly unlikely XXII will get that desirable labeling.


Why?


First, the company has failed to advance its one and only phase 2 study. The study
of the smoking cessation product called X-22 has been inactive for five years:

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 59/226


(Source: US National Institutes of Health)


Yet Swedish Match, a Stockholm-based company, is in the midst of about 70 active
or completed studies for its products:


Source: US National Institutes of Health)


But with all that data for the FDA to consider, even Swedish Match has failed to
secure MRTP approval for its various finely ground smokeless tobacco products
thus far.


So we can't imagine how XXII - without a single completed study - can possibly
expect approval of its MRTP application.


*3. Partner? Study Results Say No


XXII realizes that MRTP label depends on getting at least one study completed. But
that will take at least $25 million.


The company doesn't have that kind of money. Cash coffers contained just $2.8
million in June but added ~$5 million from a stock and warrant deal. Also the
company runs through millions and millions of dollars every six months. Cash burn
jumped 64% in the first half of the year versus the prior year to $5.9 million or ~$3
million per quarter -- without the costs of resuming the study:


Even with cash now around $5 million, XXII will have to find a partner if it wants to
take the next step.


But that is unlikely.


A partner would want some legitimate hope that phase 3 might succeed.


Though most investors don't know it, the study was dropped years ago after phase 2
failed to show any difference in the four-week period between X-22 and conventional cigarettes:

Anyone willing to bet $25-$30 million that phase 3 will produce better results than
phase 2? We didn't think so.

Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT): Destined To Wipe Out


Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT) has been riding a wave of momentum trading
activity. Since mid-July it's been a lot of fun.


But TheStreetSweeper has spotted ferocious waves swelling up on the horizon ...
And OPTT is careening toward a teeth-jarring wipe out.


OPTT began operating two decades ago and still hasn't figured out how to
commercialize its system of generating electricity from ocean waves.


On the surface, OPTT's virtually non-existent revenues appear to depend upon the
government.


Really though, stock offerings and debt have kept the company afloat. It closed two
stock deals last quarter but is left with no committed sources of equity or debt
financing right now.


Meanwhile, OPTT has figured out how to attract a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation ... and become the subject of a class action lawsuit
poised with potential stock dilution for loyal stockholders.


The stock is flying right now, partially because the market doesn't understand the
insignificance of the September 13 announcement. The company hopes to develop
a power buoy with the U.S. Office of Naval Research. The initial phase won't be
complete until early June 2017. And OPTT is only getting ~$250,000 for that phase
and maybe up to another $500,000 more if it's completed and Naval Research finds
the funding....a whole lot of ifs.


Let's look at nine factors TheStreetSweeper believes will dunk this stock.


*1. Money Flies Out The Door Month After Month, Year After Year


In the most recent quarter, OPTT made just $200,000. And it took ~15 times that to
operate the business ... a whopping $2.9 million.


(Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


In the entire fiscal year of 2016, the company's revenue didn't even reach $1 million
... But losses hit the $13 million mark...


(Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper)


The financials are so awful that auditors say it's highly doubtful the company can
even continue to operate.


OPTT just stuffed its piggy bank with $3.6 million raised from a stock offering in
July, raising the total cash to $9 million.


But the company makes ~$1 million hits on the piggy bank each month, bringing the
cash to about $7 million.


That won't last long ...

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 61/226


OPTT warns that it can't seem to stop burning up money and shareholders'
investment may be lost:


"If we are not successful in our efforts to raise additional capital sufficient to support
our operations," the company's latest 10-Q warns, "we would be forced to cease
operations, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company."


In fact, the potential for diluting OPTT stock once again could happen as soon as
November ...


*3. Tragedy, Lawsuit, Dilution Overhanging


The stock dilution threat is just around the corner, depending on a federal judge's
approval of settlement terms of a consolidated lawsuit aimed at OPTT.


The company has been sued by a class of investors who bought the stock during
the April 4, 2014 secondary offering at $3.10 per share. The lawsuit alleges untrue
and misleading statements and/or omissions occurred around that time. 


At this point, it looks like OPTT will pay $5000,000 and its insurer will pay $2.5
million under the settlement.


Here's the kicker: OPTT will also hand over 380,000 shares under the current
terms. That's about 12% of the 3.15 million shares outstanding.

Everyday Health (EVDY): Quick, Call The Doctor!


Everyday Health (EVDY) is looking so pale that it may be secretly looking up its
symptoms on rival website, WebMD.


Everyday had never exactly been the picture of health. The WebMD wannabe had
racked up a $2.38 per share net loss when it went public in February 2014. The
company made money in 2014 but slumped back to a $12 million loss or -$0.36 last
year.


Housed in luxurious $4.5 million Manhattan suites far from Silicon Valley, Everyday
is showing some disturbing symptoms exacerbated by its financial operations and
the changing industry.


Here's how the prognosis looks to TheStreetSweeper:


Investors may find other viewpoints here plus additional risks and background here.
Now let's look at why we think this healthcare search site needs to call the doctor.


*1. Google Changes


Ten years ago, WebMD was part of Google's experimental program to help improve
health search results.


The experiment worked and WebMD became a popular site for consumers to
diagnose their own illnesses. Before long, the Mayo Clinic developed its own well-
recognized symptom checker.


Everyday Health and other content aggregators rushed in and began offering their
solutions. The problem is that they must depend on Google searches because they
aren't recognized brands.


Now a decade later Google wants to keep eyeballs glued to its own pages rather
than rushing them away to the content aggregators.


Google began this effort in June, when it rolled out a new symptom search for
Androids and Apple phones or tablets.


Now this mobile platform is pushing Google ahead of the game as more and more
people switch from PC to smartphone searches.


*2. Looming: More Risk


Everyday Health and other content providers are dependent on Google, the No. 1
destination for health information: Get strong Google results or die.


Other risks are building right behind those posed by Google's new symptom search,
including:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 62/226


*The app is initially available in English in the U.S. with plans to expand over the
months into other languages, countries and enhancements, thus introducing future
challenges to Everyday Health.


*Google's symptom search eliminates the need to cross-check symptoms on
WebMD or Everyday Health because cross-checking can be done on Google.


*Google is partnering on symptom search with institutions such as Harvard Medical
School and the Mayo Clinic. Doctors are helping with Everyday Health's symptom
lookup but most content is by writers who aren't doctors. Examples include:


(Source: Everyday Health)


*3. Mobile App Downloads Decline


Mobile is of growing importance to Everyday Health, which gets 75% of its total
traffic from mobile.


Everyday's 2014 mobile revenues grew 82% to $68 million. But mobile has slowed
drastically, with 2015 revenues hitting only $73 million or just 8% growth. However
the company stopped breaking out mobile revenue after the third quarter of 2015,
so we assume revenue growth has further declined.


The chief reason for the mobile disappointment is likely because iPhone users show
far more interest in WebMD than Everyday. Everyday Health download rankings
frequently fall below 1,500 in the health and fitness category:





(Source: App Annie)


That compares with WebMD's app which consistently ranks around the top 73
downloads:

Teck Resources Limited (TCK): Lurching Toward A Monstrous Drop


The soft, scraping sound behind you is becoming more urgent. Don't look back.
Rest assured the source of that cacophony is a clomping pair of red-splattered
boots worn by zombie stock,Teck Resources Limited (TCK).


Indeed, this stock appears to be one of those on the ragged edge of the looming
apocalypse. Dying sales figures, horrifying commodity prices and grotesque
earnings - a 96% second quarter decline - have been sucking the life out of Teck.


The trick will be walking away from Teck as it leads a swarm of undead toward a
cataclysm of unspeakable terror. To aid in that effort, TheStreetSweeper offers the
top 10 bumps in the night for this stock.


*1. Sales Decline


The Canadian mining company focuses on coal for steel-making, copper and zinc
through assets in Canada, the United States, Peru and Chile.


But now the company is clearly struggling as quarterly revenues dropped 13%,
which CEO Don Lindsay said was "primarily due to lower prices for all our principal
products." First-half sales dropped 15%:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The sales trend has been nothing but down, down, down for five years:


(Source: MarketWatch)


Revenue fell 4% in 2015 from the prior year. Since 2011, Teck has seen a
staggering 28 percent drop in revenue.


The situation resulted in CEO Lindsay issuing a warning, "we have lowered our coal
and copper cost guidance for the full year."


*2. Valuation Absurd; Profits Plunge


Yet the stock sports a ridiculously oversized forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.44.

But Teck isn't even making a net income. Teck earning figures took an epic drop into
the red in 2015 ... The company lost over $2 billion!





(Source: MarketWatch)


Shareholders continue to take it on the chin this year, too. In the second quarter,
profit dropped 96.2%.


That's right. Teck management said adjusted profit declined to $3 million Canadian, or
$0.01 per share, versus $79 million or $0.14 per share last year.


But rather than driving a stake in Teck's heart, the terrible July 28 financials fueled
the rocket ship:


(Source: Benzinga)


The desperate company has been deferring capital expenditures, gradually laying
off 1,000 of its 3,000 employees, selling assets and even shutting down its Coal
Mountain project, a British Columbia mine once anticipated to produce 2.7 to 3.5
million tons of coal.


But even those efforts likely will not be enough for this commodity-dependent
company. Such commodity businesses have taken a beating for a couple of years.


More trouble lies dead ahead...


*3. Commodity Prices Forecast: Demand Declines


Judging by the stock run, the market must have bought into the CEO's second
quarter comments on his commodity business.


"While the commodity cycle continues to be challenging, we are starting to see
some positive changes in the direction of zinc and steelmaking coal prices," said Mr.
Lindsay in a statement.


But the world steel industry itself indicates the future appears gloomy.


Global steel demand contracted -3% in 2015 and the World Steel Association
believes demand will decrease once again by -0.8%.


China has been Teck's chief customer. Yet the World Steel economics committee
chairman, TV Narendran, said the greatest weakness in steel demand is expected
to be in China:


“The economic environment facing the steel industry continues to be
challenging with China’s slowdown impacting globally across a range of
indicators contributing to volatility in financial markets, sluggish growth in
global trade and low oil and other commodity prices...


"In 2016, while we are forecasting another year of contraction in steel
demand in China, slow but steady growth in some other key regions including
NAFTA and EU is expected. Growth for steel demand in all markets except
China is expected in 2017."

(Source: World Steel Association)


Indeed, World Steel anticipates China's demand to drop 4% this year and another
3% next year. Annual steel product demand is expected to be 626.1 million tons ...
a whopping 15% lower than in 2013.


*4. Negative: Free Cash Flow


Meanwhile, the company is already failing to generate cash. In fact, last quarter's
negative free cash flow hit a stunning $-87.86 million.


That makes negative cash flow in each of the last three quarters ... adding up to
negatives in 8 of the past 11 quarters (here).

Airgain (AIRG): Looming Dilution, A Potshot From Its Own Underwriter ... And More!


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert for Airgain (AIRG) investors. This recent IPO has
flown for no reason and now circumstances have aligned to suddenly take all the air
out of Airgain.


*Development No. 1: Nearly 3 million shares registered late Friday


The wireless network antenna seller has taken advantage of the high stock price to
set up employees for more gains. Almost two hours after the market closed on
Friday, Airgain filed to register 2.69 million shares of stock available under various
incentive plans ... 


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The issuance represents a cost to current investors ... looming potential dilution.
And that's not all!


*Development No. 2:  1 million stock options pose immediate dilution


A second raft of potential dilution awaits investors, too.


Roughly 1 million options are exercisable immediately, according to the chief
financial officer's comments during the earnings call 


Those options appear to be awfully cheap ... exercisable at just over $2 per share.

But Airgain isn't finished diluting shares yet...


*Recent Development No. 3: Another ~5 million shares loom just around the
corner


A third raft of potential dilution awaits investors in the form of ~5 million shares - in
converted preferred shares, dividends and warrants. These shares have been held
since the IPO in August and will be available for trading as soon as the 180-day
lock-up period ends.


Imagine all the champagne-cork flying and caviar gulping at insiders' New Year's
Eve parties as they begin celebrating their potentially huge payday around Feb. 7!


After all, the stock is trading ~94% higher than just six weeks ago.

Exact Sciences (EXAS): Flush This Stock!


Other than the out-of-whack stock price, nothing seems to be going exactly right for
Exact Sciences (EXAS).


In the 21 years since the Madison, Wisconsin company began trying to develop and
sell a DNA-based colorectal cancer screening tool, it has produced three failures
and one product whose fate remains to be seen.


PreGen-Plus, Effipure and ColoSure initially attracted a partnership with commercial
lab Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp). Just a few years after
the 2003 launch of PreGen-Plus, Exact got slapped with an FDA warning letter
noting "serious regulatory problems." The medical device couldn't seem to rise
above that issue or a general lack of popularity despite the efforts of LabCorp's
1,100 sales people.


So LabCorp discontinued both PreGen-Plus and Effipure in June 2008. ColoSure
was launched the following month, but soon suffered bad press and very
disappointing sales, generating paltry royalties of $20,000 and $26,000 yearly in
2010 and 2011, respectively. Finally, in 2012, LabCorp reported "no sales," thus no
royalties for Exact. Now LabCorp had its third failed product by Exact.


About half-a-billion dollars had gone down the latrine by the time the company
launched its most recent DNA-based colon cancer diagnostic, Cologuard, in 2014.


But last quarter only 54,000 Cologuard tests were processed at $21.2 million
revenue, generating two times more operating losses than revenue.


The company was so desperate it funded its own study in hopes of getting good
test results from Cologuard.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 67/226


But disappointment struck this time, too.


Researchers recently released results showing the more traditional screening is
both less expensive (FIT's ~$30 versus Cologuard's ~$600, though covered by
Medicare and some insurance companies)and, in apparent conflict with an earlier
study, more effective than Cologuard (referred to as MT-sDNA.)


(Source: gastrojournal)


In fact, researchers found Cologuard would only be comparable with FIT (fecal
immunochemical test) if consistent participation by users jumped 68% or
Cologuard's cost fell a whopping 60%.


But Exact can't discount Cologuard 60%.


Why? Because Exact spends so much to generate revenue. The company reports
spending 62% of revenue to capture those sales.


The self-funded study bummer is just part of what is not exactly right with Exact.
Investors may find other viewpoints here, while we consider other risks that could
send their investment straight down the water closet.


*1. Clinician's Guide: Patients Resist Cologuard Requirement


Cologuard costs some 20 times greater than other stool tests. And it turns out that
patients resist the stool sample collection and preparation required by Cologuard
(referred to below as sDNA).


That's according to doctors who wrote a clinician's guide to fecal blood testing that
was published last April in the Southern Medical Journal:


"With sDNA, the patient must self-collect the entire stool and ship the specimen via
delivery agency to the laboratory for analysis. In contrast, FIT requires only one
stool sample. Patients seem resistant to sample their own stool. The requirement
of collecting the entire stool and shipping the specimen for sDNA testing ..."





(Photo source: Cologuardtest.com)


"rather than taking a small sample for FIT and dropping it off at a local
laboratory is concerning for many," researchers wrote.


In fact, Exact has noticed the ewweeww factor with Cologuard - which still requires
the "whole stool" collection used by its previous failed products. Patient compliance
for Cologuard was already low at 69% in the first quarter ... but fell even more in the
second quarter to just 68%.


*2. Dangerous False-Positive Results


Another concern is Cologuard's high level of false-positive results.


That's according to final recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF). The group noted that FIT-DNA (Cologuard) found 92% of cancers
versus FIT's 74%, however Cologuard correctly identified 8% fewer true negatives
than FIT identified.


The stock had moved on hope the panel's update to its earlier report would remove
Cologuard from "alternative" testing to "recommended" testing. But the final
recommendation simply dropped the terms alternative and recommended.


The USPSTF provided the table below, summarizing various screening techniques.

The task force also wrote that FIT-DNA (Cologuard) produces "... more false-
positive results per screening test and an increased probability of harm from
diagnostic colonoscopy."


(True negative means the disease being tested for was not found. False positive
means the proportion of people who are actually free of the disease but test
positive.)


The task force added that the FIT-DNA (Cologuard) false-positives mean "a higher
likelihood of follow-up colonoscopy," an invasive procedure which has downsides of
anxiety, discomfort and even morbidity.

Resolute Energy Corp. (REN): Primed To Decline





Resolute Energy Corp. (REN) stock is primed and just one down-tick away from
disaster.


TheStreetSweeper issues this quick alert on this Denver-based oil and gas
company that is still the same miserable money-loser it was a couple of weeks ago
... except now the stock is even more dangerously overpriced.


Here are TheStreetSweeper's top five reasons that we believe this stock is begging
to tank:


*1. Nothing New: Management Cheering


The company's production is substantially declining:


Not surprisingly, financial results for 2Q were just as horrible as the production
figures. Revenue declined and negative earnings persisted. "Resolute recorded a
net loss of $36.9 million, or $2.44 per share, on revenue ...  of $35.4 million during
the three months ended June 30, 2016.  This compares to a net loss of $259.1
million, or $17.30 per share, on revenue ... of $48.4 million during the three months
ended June 30, 2015."


The company placed that vital information on page 4, well below the company
cheerleading statements that began with: "Production guidance revised upward by
thirteen percent."


During the month following the release of those financials, the stock climbed from
$8.35 to $22.88, an astounding 174%. Why? Because REN guys felt optimistic. And
others piled on more unfounded optimism...

*2. Pumping: Chat Rooms, Fool


Chatter within chat rooms such as investorshub has heartily promoted REN to retail
investors. Such attention is often a hallmark of a stock groomed to be a highflier
one day, and doomed to be a lowdown loser the next. Note that nobody talks about
the company's financial condition or potential. It's all about the stock movement.

Briefing.com threw REN onto the radar, too:

Motley Fool also published a bullish piece (here) which helped rocket the stock,
while the author suggested the company's optimistic production guidance was the
primary driver.


*3. Big Investor: Selling REN Stock


A major investor - SPO Advisory managed by John Scully - has found reason to sell
REN stock.


SPO dumped 10 million shares in late April, severely trimming the investment firm's
ownership:

Indeed, institutional investors were selling out, pre-reverse-split, at nearly three
times the rate of those taking new positions:

Rentech (RTK) Kryptonite Slams Investors


Like a diabolic superhero, Rentech (RTK) has tried to leap tall financial issues with
a single bound.


But now a ton of kryptonite is headed its way, promising to decimate the company
stock in one fell swoop.


TheStreetSweeper's executive bullet points summarize the superhuman problems
that will chop this wood fiber company's stock into splinters:


*A one-time tax gain creates an illusion of profitability.


*Revenue drops 20%; EPS falls 486%.


*Negative and extremely low margins doom profitability.


*The natural gas industry presents indomitable competition.


*Key plant reaches only 40% of capacity, three years after acquisition.


*Nearly $19 million in contract penalties and plant modification costs pressure cash
coffers.


*Interest in low-performing nitrogen sector further weighs on Rentech.


*The company loses $153 million in 2015; executives make millions.


Investors may find other viewpoints here and the company website here.
Meanwhile, here's a closer look at Rentech's stock slayers:


*1. Not So Super, After All: One-Time Gain


Rentech's second quarter turned in a $358.6 million book gain. But an overly
excited market rushed to pop up the stock without taking time to understand what's
really behind that number.


The figure is just an illusion of profitability caused by a one-time tax gain.


During the Aug. 10 2Q earnings call, chief financial officer Jeff Spain said:


"We recorded a pretax gain on the sale of Rentech Nitrogen of $358.6 million which
was booked in discontinued operations. This gain was comprised of cash proceeds
of approximately $60 million in common units of CVR Partners valued at $202

million based on CVR’s closing price on March 31. These values were compared to
Rentech Nitrogen’s net book value excluding the capacity in holdings which was a
negative $97.6 million."


Completely misunderstanding the book gain, the market sent shares soaring more
than 20% in a day and over 50% in seven trading days.


*2. Revenue: Can't Save The Day


People didn't understand that Rentech's second quarter revenues actually swooped
lower!

Resolute Energy Corp. (REN): Overloaded And Ready To Tank


TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert for Resolute Energy Corp. (REN).


Considering this stock's flight to a mind-blowing $20 per share early this week,
investors would never guess the pathetic condition of this Denver-based oil and gas
company's finances nor its junk status nor its huge 2Q loss of $-2.44.


The stock jumped following the Aug. 8 2Q report that the board had approved
continued drilling in 2016 and average daily oil production improved from 9,016
barrels the quarter earlier to 11,865 barrels. What wasn't announced is the recent
production level is a ~4% to 7% drop from the previous two years.


The market pushed up Resolute and other oil companies' stock with the crude oil
rally on Aug. 15.


In a heartbeat, everything changed.


Oil prices tumbled yesterday and, after the closing bell, Resolute filed notice that
Nicholas Sutton will retire as CEO.


Mr. Sutton owns 2.1 million shares of the company stock. Considering the stock
price has nearly tripled this month, TheStreetSweeper thinks it wouldn't be a bad
idea if he chooses to sell a bunch of shares and ride off into the sunset.


It's unclear how smoothly the company can replace the man who has been CEO
since the company's founding in 2004. Mr. Sutton will stay on as executive
chairman but the new chief executive will be Richard Betz, a manager since 2004
and chief operating officer since 2012.


Below are five more big reasons TheStreetSweeper is warning investors that this
stock will almost undoubtedly suffer a rapid, tooth-rattling drop from the current
ridiculous levels.


*1. Reverse Stock Split: Stock Flies


Resolute stock looked like one big empty oil tank when it pulled a 1-for-5 reverse
stock split effective just  two months ago, on June 8.


The maneuver worked better than anyone might have imagined, rocketing the
stock nearly 3,000%.


(Source: Nasdaq)


The stock split put Resolute in compliance with the $1 per share minimum
requirement. The reverse split also helped improve the valuation following its latest
New York Stock Exchange delisting notification received last November. The
company had been out of compliance because market capitalization and
shareholder equity have each dropped below $50 million. The exchange will
continue to monitor those factors.


*2. Wandering In: Wunderlich, Etc.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 72/226


Within days after this stock split, investment analysts began lining up to put in their
two-cents worth about Resolute.


Barclays analysts on June 14 maintained an "underweight" rating and raised the
price target from $1 to $4.


On July 11, Wunderlich Securities upgraded the stock from "hold" to "buy" and set
an $8 price target, up from $4. The very next month, the firm raised the PT two
more times ...


On Aug. 10, Wunderlich raised the price target again... this time to $15.


Despite no Resolute news (and bad news about oil prices and the CEO departure
just two days away), on Monday, Aug. 24, Wunderlich raised Resolute's price target
to $25, triple the July figure.


Other firms' Resolute ratings are shown below.


(Source: MarketBeat)


Wunderlich, Barclays and Johnson Rice each shared underwriting responsibilities
for the company's 16.25 million share offering at $8.22 back in May 2013. We can
only imagine that these firms would also be interested in handling any future
underwriting duties.


*3. Downgraded: Junk Status


Resolute had already been suffering from a junk rating when its deteriorating credit
quality spurred Standard & Poor's further downgrade ... just four months before the
reverse stock split and the odd glut of analyst attention:

Zagg (ZAGG): Why Investors Should Zag Away From This Stock


We couldn't blame Zagg Inc. (ZAGG) if it's quietly suffering buyer's remorse.


But the cell phone accessory company will really be in trouble when investors
understand the reason for the disappointment ... and that buyer's remorse rubs off
on them.


The troubles can be traced back to shortly after February, when Zagg bought
Mophie, maker of an iPhone battery case called Juice Pack Air. Mophie's pretty
battery cases seemed to be flying off the shelves. So Zagg, looking to diversify,
rushed in and bought out Mophie for $100 million.


It was supposed to be a fire sale.


Enter the PokemonGo craze. The augmented reality game launched July 6 and
immediately became a phone battery hog.  Zagg's stock ran up 38% on hopes that
Zagg could help address the need with its Mophie battery-extending case.


But now Zagg is positioned to run out of steam.


Investors may find other viewpoints here and the company website here.
Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper examines why Zagg's stock is now incredibly risky.


*1. Set Up For Failure


As it turned out, Mophie had been losing multi-millions. As competition has grown,
business has deteriorated, handing Mophie last year a loss of $29 million.


So Zagg management justified the $100 million cash-and-debt acquisition by touting
sales and growth figures.

"Mophie’s 12-month sales are estimated to range from $210 million to $230 million,
or sales growth of 3% to 13% compared to 2015 estimated sales of $203 million,"
said chief financial officer Bradley Holiday during the March 9 earnings call.


Then two months later, after everyone had forgotten about management's
estimates, the pro forma numbers came out. Sure enough, Mophie sales grew only
slightly to about $186 million. ... The reality was $24 million to $44 million less than
those fancy touted numbers.


(Chart 2 Source: Zagg SEC filing)


Those exaggerated numbers have set Zagg up for failure ....


*2. Touted Growth Despite Deteriorating Business


Since 2015 sales turned out puny compared to those touted by management, the
Mophie segment will have to sell a ton of cases this year:


The Mophie segment must be gulping over those expectations ... because the
business has been deteriorating over the last couple of years.

Magellan Petroleum (MPET): Gas Mask Needed For This LNG Plan


Magellan Petroleum Corporation (MPET) threatens to become the poster child for
the "good deal" gone bad.


Teetering at the brink of bankruptcy, MPET is an old time oil and gas company that
executed a reverse split last year, then recently fell into a reverse takeover on
hopes of floating an $8 billion idea that won't be operational until 2025. The plan is
to build a liquefied natural gas terminal on 477 leased acres in Louisiana. The idea
is stoked by a man who has been vilified by activist investor Carl Icahn.


The stock has rocketed on this plan ... but is now precariously positioned for
decline.


Investors may find other viewpoints here and the company website here.
Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents the immense risks facing MPET investors.


*1. Billions: Cost of MPET Plan


At the core of the MPET merger is Driftwood LNG. Former Cheniere Energy CEO
Charif Souki filed a request in May with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) to begin an environmental review process for Driftwood.


The new, as-yet-unnamed company hopes to produce and export 26 million tons
per year of LNG in facilities in southwest Louisiana. Construction is hoped to begin
in 2018 and will likely take seven years, with the first plant operational in 2022. 


Company officials expect the project to become fully operational the second quarter
of 2025. The project is expected to cost $8 billion.


In contrast, Denver, Colorado based oil and gas company MPET has turned into a
shell of a company forced to sell its assets to fund operations. The company
operates under the cloud of going concern issues and earnings have been
negative. Over the last 12 months, the earnings per share have been in the red at 
$-9.17.


(Source: E-trade)


At the end of March, MPET's available cash had fallen to $131,000.

*2. "This Is Insane"


Yet this odd pairing of a dying company with a startup anticipating billions of dollars
in expenses has captured retail investors' imagination and pushed MPET shares up
over 400% since the Aug. 3 merger announcement.


The reverse takeover of MPET will allow Mr. Souki to take his new company public,
Tellurian Investments, with business partner Martin Houston.


Just last December, billionaire shareholder Carl Icahn ousted Mr. Souki from
Cheniere.


He said Mr. Souki was “taking $80 million out, and any stock he could sell, he sold."


Mr. Icahn continued his comments on Mr. Souki, according to Bloomberg:


“So here he is doing this, going in with one idea after another. I looked at this and
said, ‘This is insane. This is the problem.’”


“I’ll tell you know what he knew -- he knew how to go almost bankrupt, because
that’s what happened to him.”


Cheniere approached bankruptcy in 2008 as Mr. Souki developed a multibillion-
dollar plan to import liquefied natural gas into America, but the U.S. had become
awash in gas production from shale drilling. Cheniere was left with huge, expensive
LNG tanks and nearly empty pockets, as Forbes wrote.


Then Mr. Souki pushed an even more expensive idea of exporting some of that U.S.
gas overseas. But the collapse in oil prices came as the costly plan was slowly
unfolding.


(Source: Yahoo Finance)


Cheniere shares fell by more than half in 2015, attracting Mr. Icahn's stake in the
company in August 2015, two seats on the board and an interest in examining Mr.
Souki's ideas. 


According to Bloomberg's April 2016 article, after Mr. Souki was fired, Mr. Icahn
commented that Mr. Souki had “harebrained ideas.”


Under the MPET deal, each share of Tellurian will be converted into the right to
receive 1.3 share of MPET. The company will issue about 122 million shares of
common stock to Tellurian shareholders - about 95% of MPET's outstanding stock.
This dilutive deal is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2016.


Yes, that's 122 million shares added to the 5.8 million outstanding. So at around $5
per share the market cap exceeds $600 million ... for a company that has nothing
but an idea.

Northern Dynasty Minerals (NAK): Looming Dilution Potential, 6 More Downside Risks


After a decade of controversy over its proposed Pebble mine, Northern Dynasty
Minerals (NAK) is still absolutely nowhere.


At first glimpse, unwary investors might expect significant news because the stock
has practically doubled over a month to unsustainable levels.


The Pebble property covers 153 square miles of land in Alaska, taking in at least 15
square miles for the proposed mine operation and tailings ponds. The project would
place one of the world's largest copper and gold mine against the world's largest
salmon fishery and environmental concerns.The project has not yet entered the
permitting phase.


So there's no real news now and this stock has no upward trajectory left. Investors

the biggest, and highest grade copper gold deposits in the world, it is subject to a
legal and political dispute. In our opinion, a political resolution with Alaskan
Indigenous owners would solve the legal dispute, and both sides have ample
incentive to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This will be a binary outcome, a
huge win, or a substantial loss, and the time frame is indeterminate."


Some of the air had gone out of the stock from the time of the Sprott disclosure a
month earlier until Mr. Rule's suggestion last week ... But NAK again rose -
notwithstanding the fact that Sprott Resource Corp. itself extended its losses
recently, reporting $17.5 million net loss in the second quarter. Traders apparently
also didn't notice Sprott's stock chart:

Indeed, the suggestion from Sprott advanced the NAK stock runup.


Congratulations to those who got in on the momentum trading over the past four
weeks or so.


Congrads to Sprott ... likely poised to sell more stock right now.


Keep in mind that this trade activity is based on - indeed in spite of - the same old,
same old ...


*3. Same Ol' Losing Company


NAK is the very same company it was on Aug. 12.


The day after Mr. Rule included NAK among his investment suggestions, NAK finally
had some real news. On Aug. 12, the company reported it had lost millions again.

Energous (WATT): Don't Get Shocked ... Big Downside Risks


Judging by the stock buoyancy of Energous (WATT), you'd never know that the
developer of wireless charging technology just announced it lost $10.3 million. And
on a per share basis the loss hit $0.62.


It seems the market missed the Santa Jose, California firm's comment near the
bottom of the press release that it has a new investment ... which is dilutive.


Maybe the market is beginning to get bleary eyed at yet another overly optimistic
spin: "With the new investment from Ascend Capital and our first silicon and royalty
revenues expected before the end of this year, our financial position is secure. We
are poised to expand our company and accelerate the pace of licensee expansion
to make our vision of a ubiquitous WattUp ecosystem a reality and solidify our
position as market leader."


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper alerts
investors to four good reasons this stock is poised to wreck investment portfolios:


*1. WATT: More Money, More Money


WATT keeps running to the stock trough in search of more cash. And each time the
company goes back for more, the quality of the stock offering declines.
Consider:


*Dec. 10, 2014: Secondary offering. $7/ share. Raises $21 million. (Oppenheimer,
Roth, National Securities)


*Nov. 17, 2015: Secondary offering. $6.90/share. Raises $19 million. (Ladenburg
Thalmann, Roth, National Securities) Note: lower share price, lower raise, second-
tier bank compared with 2014.


*Aug. 9, 2016: Ascend Legend private purchase. $12.36/share. Raises $20 million.
Note: Generally undesirable PIPE (private investment in public entity) deal results in
warrants good for 5 years, each worth $6.80/share, according to a Black-Scholes
calculator. The deal participant makes money if he can sell the common share at
$6, which has a dilutive effect on current shares.


*2. Puff-Puff: High Claims; Delivery's Tougher


WATT doesn't need the fluff pumped out by professional promoters, such as those
who hyped the stock in 2014 and 2015 (here). It can be overly optimistic all by itself,
thank you very much.


Claim: "Ascend is a multibillion-dollar hedge fund based in California," CEO Steve
Rizzone said during the Aug. 9, 2016 earnings call.


"The second consideration is the investor, receiving an investment of $20 million
from a $3 billion hedge fund like Ascend is a strong validation point for Energous,"
Mr.Rizzone added.


Reality: Ascend isn't a multi-billion company. Bloomberg shows Ascend is valued
about 230% lower:

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 77/226


Milestone Claims: WATT managers consistently talk (as SA author Paulo Santos
notes) about commercialization being just around the corner...


* Q1 2014 earnings call: "We believe that we will have actual consumer product
in the market in the third quarter of 2015 and as a result we should start to see
our royalties flow in the fourth quarter of 2015."


*Q4 2014 earnings call: "... we now intend to have WattUp technology full integrated
into products from strategic partners supporting the internet of things at the 2016
CES Show and available to the consumer by the end of the first quarter,
beginning of the second quarter of 2016.


*Q2 2015 earnings call: "... our technology will be incorporated into their products
and as a result they will make the call on terms of timing ... we believe it's a
technology through either our strategic partners that we will sign in the coming
months who may have accelerated product cycles who will likely will be available
towards the end of 2016, the first part of 2017 and it will have a broader
expansion into markets in the latter half of 2017."


*Q4 2015 earnings call: Did not push out product time line. But changed the topic
from full scale WattUp transmitter to mini WattUp transmitter.


*Q2 2016 earnings call: "We are also reconfirming our projections that consumer
products from our licensees of the Mini WattUp transmitter technology will be
shipping late this year or early next year. The WattUp enabled Midsize transmitter
applications will be shipping in late 2017 and the Full-size WattUp transmitters will
be shipping in early 2018."


For some reason ... well, many reasons...WATT bears an unfortunate resemblance
to Second Sight Medical Products (EYES).


*3. WATT: Reminiscent of EYES

Image Sensing Systems (ISNS): What Goes Up Must Go Down ... And Fast





TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert on Image Sensing Systems (ISNS).


The company focuses on software-based detection products for the transportation
industry. 


Incredibly, the stock is flying following a dull announcement that it is expanding its
product offering (here).


But investors need to be alert to the company's extreme risks at this point,
including:


*1. Cash Poor


ISNS reported as of June 30, it had about $964,000 in cash. That's too little to run a
company, and well below the (also paltry) $2.6 million reported in December.


*2. Extreme Cash Burn


ISNS is burning the cash. In just a quarter, it rips through around $1 million to $1.2
million. This suggests a capital raise may be imminent.


*3. Poor Earnings


In six months ended June 2016, net income was $0.18 or $0.10 higher than in
2015. However, company revenue declined from a year earlier, while cost of
revenue increased:


(Source: Company SEC filings)


Unfortunately, the year's revenue was the lowest reported in 8 years.

Investor Alert: Odyssey Marine Exploration (OMEX)


TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert for Odyssey Marine Exploration
(OMEX).


The shipwreck exploration company is rapidly turning into an epic shipwreck that
will leave unwary investors drowning in its wake.


The company faces massive issues, including:


*Virtually no cash left.


*At the brink of Nasdaq delisting.


*Likely bankruptcy or major dilution looming.


*Professional promoters, chatrooms hype the stock.


*Don Diego project application is dead.


*Recent announcement apparently meaningless; actually a lost opportunity.


*OMEX loses millions while executives make millions.


Financial distress has forced this Tampa, Florida company to essentially give up
salvaging shipwrecks in December 2015 to re-focus on mining underwater
phosphates in Mexican waters. But that plan was derailed six months ago when the
Mexican government rejected the company's environmental application to dredge in
the "Don Diego" deposit.


Let's look more closely at OMEX, most likely the worst company we've ever
considered...


*1. Virtually No Cash Left


Today's investors might be surprised to learn that OMEX has operated as a hobby
for the past decade, as shown by consistent yearly net losses.


(Source: Company SEC filings, here, here, here)


Those losses reflect OMEX' ongoing predicament of cash burn exceeding available
cash:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The company managed to add to cash and cut debt by selling its exploration boat,
headquarters building and shipwreck inventory in December 2015. Company filings
say now there's no remaining inventory.


And by the end of September 2016, barely assisted by a $2.4 million contract,
OMEX was likely almost down to its last dollar. But Epsilon Financing agreed to
amend a note to give OMEX its final $3 million infusion - at a draconian 10%
interest rate. The loan allows OMEX to limp along another quarter until the wolves
line up at the doorstep again ...


*2. Finance Or Delist


So OMEX is left with two choices: It must get significant financing, likely via
convertible shares ... or go to the dreaded over-the-counter bulletin board.


When the stock goes to the bulletin board, the show's over. Everyone moves on.
And the stock we believe is left to trade for about 50 cents apiece.


*3. Nasdaq Delisting


OMEX is, indeed, at the brink of being delisted from the Nasdaq because its market
valuation has been below the required $35 million level for the past six months.

The delisting notification boils down to this...


To hit that valuation, shares need to trade for about $4.65 per share and remain at
that level for 10 consecutive business days by Nov. 21.

Broadwind Energy (BWEN): Miserable Margins, Horrific History Sweep Away Potential


Broadwind Energy's (BWEN) chief executive recently commented, "I am tempted to
say everything went wrong."


The CEO referred to production problems when she made that comment during a
recent earnings call.  Issues such as paint spatter resulted in $4 million worth of
unusable wind tower sections and left an important wind tower order unfulfilled.


But those words beautifully sum up Broadwind's past and present condition.


The executive behind those words is Stephanie Kushner. She settled SEC charges
just last year - along with Broadwind and a former CEO - related to allegedly
keeping investors in the dark about Broadwind's financial deterioration.


Today, the Cicero, Illinois wind tower support manufacturer remains a disaster, with
operating losses 253 percent worse than a year earlier.


Regardless, Broadwind stock has risen ... and is now precariously positioned to fall
apart.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents
the top eight reasons we believe an investment in Broadwind will soon be gone with
the wind:


*1. Historically Peak Production: Still Losing Money


Broadwind's business is so poor that even at near-peak production of 450 towers in
2015, the company still lost money hand over fist.





(Source: Marketwatch)


In 2015, Broadwind whipped up the following:


*Lowest revenue in 5 years. A 17% drop from prior year.


*Worst net income in 3 years. A 99% drop from prior year.


*Worst return to stockholders in 4 years. Earnings per share dropped 220% from prior
year.


Broadwind is twisting and flailing like a mosquito in a tornado, thanks to some basic
problems...


*2. Smashed: Margins


One massive problem is that Broadwind is selling a commodity weighed down by
terrible gross margins.


Margins for the year hit the lowest level in 4 years ... 3.95%:

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 80/226


(Source: Bloomberg)


So out of every $1 Broadwind makes in sales, it gets to keep less than 4 cents.


The company did manage to cut costs and raise the margin slightly last quarter. But
cost cutting can go only so far.


Sales, general and administrative costs were 8.9% (9% for the year) of revenue.
Broadwind can't make a profit with yearly gross margins of just 4% to 7% - the
range the company has reported over the last five years.


*3. Wind Tower Production: Not Like Canning Beans


A bull somewhere may find hope in Broadwind's announced $137 million contract
over three years or about $45.6 million per year. But the challenge will be dealing
with the combination of terrible margins and production problems.


Ms Kushner talked about those production killers during the fourth quarter 2015
earnings call (here):


"We produced only 450 towers, although we had sold 500 and we paid dearly for
this miss in cost overruns, efficiency losses and customer penalties."


Ms. Kushner went on to describe the roughly $12 million cost of production
mishaps.  She added:


"There was clearly too much variability in our production results. The majority of our
problems are in two key areas: the paint process and managing an increasingly
complex supply chain."


Additionally, she suggested the Abilene, Texas plant layout was poor and cramped,
and the workers were relatively inexperienced. The CEO added:


"And I think if we were making cans of beans or something, it would be great."

Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT): Expanded SEC Probe, Promotions, Revenue Decline


Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT) is creating waves alright ... just not the right
kind.


Over 32 years, the company has failed to turn electricity-generating ocean wave
power into a real business.


But the company has created waves over the years by recycling old "news." All
backed by a veritable brigade of promoters eager to push the old news and thus
keep the company on investors' radar.


Ocean Power has turned into swamp gas, racking up over $177 million in losses but
no commercial product.


Yet the stock recently lifted off and floated to price levels not seen in over a year.


TheStreetSweeper alerts investors about what's really behind this rally ... and why
the stock is precariously positioned to sink into the deep blue sea.


First, the executive bullet points:


*SEC investigation expands


*No cash set aside for SEC investigation losses


*Regurgitated news


*Oddly timed stock promotions

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 81/226


*Losses rising


*Nearly $1 million cash burn monthly


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, below are
TheStreetSweeper's details surrounding  Ocean Power's stormy seas:


*1. Agreement: Just Rehash


On June 1, the stock shot up some 300 percent on a company press release
announcing Ocean Power's lease agreement with Mitsui for a power buoy "planned
to be deployed off Kozu-island..."


(Source: Yahoo Finance, TheStreetSweeper)


All well and good, right? Except that Mitsui deal is not new. The companies began
working together eight years ago.


But in October 2013, Ocean Power reeled out a strikingly similar press release
which said the company agreed with Mitsui "to cooperate in the development and
commercialization" of the power buoy.


Ocean Power's habit of recycling old news goes back several years. In 2012, the
company announced it clinched a deal with Lockheed Martin for a demonstration
project in Australia. here.


That worked so well, it spun out the same news two years later here. The company
didn’t even bother to change many words. But guess what? The deal fell dead in
the water in 2014.


*2. Amazing: Pitiful Sum, Many Years In The Making


One thing about the recent, much-trumpeted Mitsui deal is amazing. It has taken
Ocean Power three years to progress from agreeing, to agreeing some more and
planning to deploy a power buoy. All that time and effort for an engineering services
and licensing contract expected to be worth only $975,587 over half a year or so...


Mitsui apparently considers this arrangement no more than a science experiment;
the Mitsui website doesn't even mention Ocean Power and its ballyhooed
agreement.


(Source: Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding)


Alarmingly, Mitsui's sub-million-dollar contract is Ocean Power's "one revenue
producing contract."


Lately, Ocean Power has needed to lean heavily on its one viable deal...


*3. Critical Timing: July 14 Press Release


Ocean Power's July 14 press release should have been considered skeptically.


You see, the very next day, the company was scheduled to release its fiscal year
financial report. And that report was filled with shockers.

Vuzix Corp. (VUZI): Dismal Business, SEC Inquiry, Habitual Stock Offerings


Looking through Vuzix (VUZI) eyewear, we see a future clouded by an SEC inquiry,
paid promotions, more stock-diluting raises and more investor money thrown down
the drain.


Executive bullet points for Vuzix include:


1. Company is a glorified stock promotion


2. Operates a minimal, declining business


3. Under SEC inquiry.


4. Has nothing to do with PokémonGo.


5. Faces stock dilution which we believe is imminent.


Here are details on the top five reasons that TheStreetSweeper wants to toss out


Vuzix and its goofy, not-that-smart eyewear:


*1. May 24: SEC Launches Vuzix Inquiry


On May 24, the Securities and Exchange Commission notified Vuzix that the
company is under inquiry.


"On May 24, 2016, we received a letter from the SEC, dated May 19, 2016, notifying the
Company that the SEC is conducting an informal inquiry relating to the Company, and requesting that
the Company produce certain documents relating to the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. If, in connection with this informal inquiry, the SEC determines to take action against the
Company, the Company’s financial position could be adversely affected."


 
On July 6, Vuzix finally mentioned the SEC inquiry. Instead of immediately
disclosing this crucial matter in an 8-K, the company waited six weeks to disclose the
news near the bottom of its prospectus.


Why? First, let's look at recent events and then we'll put it all together ... Read on
....


*2. Promotion: After The SEC Notification


On June 9, professional promoters pushed a video news release promoting a so-
called collaborative agreement between Vuzix and an undisclosed party.


(Source: CEOLive)


The CEOLive host quickly mentions that no licensing agreements or technology
transfers have happened; but the parties have agreed to work toward a prototype;
and that this "big" announcement is really just a follow-on effort.


So this hype appears to be an oddly timed regurgitation of an old, small, tenuous
deal. Regardless, this information helped fuel the stock rally.


*3. Investors Remain In The Dark


Incredibly, that June 9 promotion hit about two weeks after Vuzix got the SEC inquiry letter.
At the time of the promotion, apparently only Vuzix managers knew about the SEC's
inquiry.


But investors were in the dark.


Likewise, many didn't realize the company had been struggling and stumbling along
since before it ever began selling smart glasses in late 2013. Losses altogether had
flown to more than $61 million. Losses last quarter alone hit $3.8 million.


The company also reported dismal losses and gross margins for 2015 versus 2014:

But its current project may be the most challenging yet ... a desperate dive to
recover its own shipwrecked company.


While investors may find other viewpoints here, TheStreetSweeper sees one titanic
disaster in the making. Here's why:


*1. Poof: Cash, Assets, Don Diego Hope


The company reported, as of March 31, operating cash had fallen to $2.8 million ...
At the same time the company is burning through $2.7 million in just one quarter.


So OMEX appears to be operating on fumes.


At the same time, OMEX is struggling with debt deals and owns virtually no assets.


Filings state: "we have pledged the majority of our remaining assets to MINOSA,
and its affiliates, and to Monaco, leaving us with few opportunities to raise additional
funds from our balance sheet.”


OMEX's financial lifeboats recently have been anchored on expectations that
Mexico approve the Don Diego permit. But Mexican authorities denied this critical
application.


The Don Diego represents a Hail Mary business restructuring for OMEX and, in our
view, another reason for investors to brace for failure. Read on….  


*2. Mexico: Application Denied


Way back in 1994, the company began navigating the thrilling but choppy waters of
undersea excavation and recovery.


OMEX found five major shipwrecks over those 22 years but lost $123 million in the
process, Bloomberg reports.


In 2007, the company began a very public 5-year battle with Spain over gold and
silver recovered from the "Black Swan" warship. OMEX lost the loot and a federal
judge ordered the company to pay $1 million for "bad faith and abusive litigation."


In the midst of that public drama, the company restructured operations in 2010 to
focus on deep water seabed exploration of minerals.


Much hope went into the Don Diego seabed deposit off the Mexico coast -
considered the restructuring centerpiece -  and shares ran up around $9 in early
April.


Then on April 11, Mexico denied the company's environmental permit application
amid concerns about the environmental impact on sea turtles. OMEX plans to
dredge Don Diego's phosphate rock lurched to a halt and the stock took a 55%
dive.

Digital Ally (DGLY): Why This Stock Will Get Chopped


TheStreetSweeper issues an investor alert on Digital Ally (DGLY).


Shares in consistently unprofitable Digital Ally have rocketed following last week's
shooting rampage that left five police officers dead and more fighting for their lives.


As the gunman blasted away and the crowd panicked, police body cameras
supplied by Taser International (TASR) captured video of the scene. With the nation

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 84/226


focused on Dallas and other shootings, it's not too surprising that Taser shares
soared 5.9% to $27.30.


Flying in under Taser's wings, DGLY surged from ~$4 to $7, bumped along and then
topped out July 13 at $6.23 per share. This morning, the stock opened at $5.49 as
people begin to realize DGLY is a poor copycat focused on an antiquated product.


TheStreetSweeper's executive bullet points below summarize why we expect the
stock to plummet back to earth:


1.    DGLY stock is up after the market has mistakenly aligned the stock with body
camera market leader Taser International.


 2.    The vast majority of DGLY's revenue - 43% - comes from DGLY's in-car videos,
not from body cameras, as the market wrongly assumes.


 3.    Compared with Taser, DGLY's product costs nearly two times more and offers
inferior resolution, battery life and field of view.


 4.    DGLY's revenue has been dropping over the last 4 quarters; earnings remain
negative. In contrast, Taser offers positive earnings and revenue is nearly 10 times
greater than DGLY.


 5.    DGLY has attracted very, very little institutional ownership, only ~5%.
  


TheStreetSweeper's full details follow:





*1. No Comparison: Taser Owns The Market


The company's nemesis Taser International initially gained attention with its stun
guns. But now the company has catapulted into the market-leading position for
body cameras, controlling three-fourths of the body camera business in the United
States.


Cops in cities from Dallas to Los Angeles to Washington wear Taser's state-of-the-
art Axon body cameras. A key component is Taser's "Evidence.com" site ...


(Source: Taser Evidence.com)


Taser's Evidence.com allows police to log on and manage their body camera video.


Meanwhile, Digital Ally is focusing on a different product. Though the company
began in 2003 as a bow-hunting product company, in 2006, it began shipping what
is still its primary product - the old-time, in-car video camera. These DVMs or digital
video mirrors make up the vast majority of company sales at 43%.


*2. Digital Ally: Product Miss


Yet investor and consumer interest is clearly focused on high-tech body cameras.


Somehow Digital Ally has gotten swept up in the excitement even though its body
worn camera called "FirstVu HD" and "FirstVu" is a tiny portion of its business.


Digital Ally has found that its body camera sales are seriously lagging behind its old
in-car products. Worse yet, last quarter, the body cameras lost even more ground:





(Source: Company SEC filing)


Though Digital Ally is a minor player in the body camera business, its cameras cost
surprisingly more than Taser's:

(Source: bodycamerareviews)


(Source: bodycamerareviews)


According to company filings, Digital Ally's body cam costs nearly two times more at
$795.


Digital Ally's specs fall short, too. These cameras depend on an external battery
which provides less than half the battery life of Taser's camera.


Taser's video resolution and field of view also dwarf its small competitor's specs.


So it's no surprise that police departments don't want to pay nearly twice as much
for a Digital Ally product that offers features about half as effective as Taser...

RadiSys Corporation (RSYS): Racing Toward A Radical Drop


All the good news has already been priced into RadiSys Corporation (NASDAQ:
RSYS), creating a perfect jumping off point.


Now RadiSys looks poised for a radical hit.


The Hillsboro, Oregon-based computer server company has turned in consistent
net losses for years. But the stock went ballistic recently when the company named
Verizon as the customer that earlier placed a DCEngine trial order. RadiSys had
hinted at the identity at least four months before. But the June 7 announcement
kicked the stock out of sight.


(Source: morningstar)


So ... the announcement is the first reason TheStreetSweeper believes RadiSys
has become radically overpriced and doomed to drop (other viewpoints here):

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 86/226


RadiSys investors had kicked the stock in the pants following its quarterly financial
report released in May.


Investors were not pleased to learn that gross margins had dropped again year-
over-year and sequential earnings losses had worsened.


So the customer announcement weeks later about the DCEngine server for the
phone company worked beautifully to juice the stock by about 70%.


But RadiSys can't hold up under such a frothy valuation.


*2. Legacy Biz: Help Me, Help Me!


The RadiSys rise is unsustainable as sales continue their perilous downward spiral.
Part of the problem is that 75% of the company's revenue comes from its old-line
server business.


Unfortunately, this legacy business segment is dropping, dropping, dropping...


(Source: Bloomberg)


The sales dropped 15% in 2015 and 21% the year before. 


Hmmm. What if Shark Tank's Mark Cuban scratched his chin and blurted:


"What's your margins?"


RadiSys would have to stammer out something like:


"Our margins are declining... Like crazy."


This chart below is a snapshot from a company presentation.


(Source: RadiSys presentation)





The chart shows that the company's legacy business "Embedded Products" has
been enduring 24% to 20% margins for 1 1/2 years. And last quarter's margins
dropped all the way down to 15%.

Copart (CPRT): Five Reasons To Terminate This Stock


Copart (Nasdaq: CPRT) has barely felt the losses now running cyborg-like through

But that will quickly change.


As soon as the Copart double-digit exposure to the United Kingdom market
becomes evident, even the Terminator himself could be expected to turn tail and run

from this stock.


Copart is in the online junk-car business. The Dallas-based company sells recycled
scrap cars to the public, vehicle dismantlers, exporters, etc. in the United States
and elsewhere, including Britain.


Britain voted Thursday to exit from the European Union. Stock losses are extending
as global markets consider the potential economic turmoil and the uncertainties.
Now Copart is vulnerable ...

Indeed, Brexit has conspired with other issues to prepare Copart for - not a rise of
the machines - but a brutal fall.
 
Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, consider the top five reasons
TheStreetSweeper believes Copart investors might want to run for safety.
 
First, here are TheStreetSweeper's executive bullet points:
 
*About 18.7% of Copart revenue faces exposure to European concerns.


*Brexit is expected to exacerbate Europe’s declining used car sales.


*Any economic squeeze can cut driving, accident claims and Copart’s business.


*A sluggish economy also creates more uninsured drivers who typically just fix their
cars, meaning fewer cars for Copart to salvage out.


*Since the Brexit vote, other auto stocks have suffered double-digit declines.


*Copart has ~$137m in cash … and a $96 million “demand for payment” of back
taxes and penalties.


* Insiders are selling their stock.

StraightPath Communications (STRP): Investors Beware


StraightPath (STRP) fans haven't recognized it yet, but the Federal
Communications Commission Chairman dropped the "C" bomb right on top of
StraightPath.


"C" as in competition. Chairman Tom Wheeler told members of the National Press
Club that America needs to "open up vast amounts of spectrum for 5G
applications."


But Mr. Wheeler's interest in kickstarting the 5G frontier actually rips away some of
StraightPath's mojo.


"...competition in the supply of backhaul remains limited and that can translate into
higher prices for wireless networks and higher prices for consumers," he said.


So the big picture is that plans are to increase competition for licensed and
unlicensed network providers.


Additionally, 5G networks won't even be available until 2020!


Enthusiasm over the possibilities of 5G high frequency spectrum has irrationally
stretched StraightPath's  stock price.


Now, the latest 5G excitement is actually a huge disappointment to the company.
When investors realize this, we believe the price will quickly reverse.

SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG): Insider Selling, Rival Actions Cool Off This Stock


Just beneath investors' radar, SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) is fighting a feud
worthy of the infamous Hatfields and McCoys. There will be no "hog trial" this time
around but today's revenge-fueled struggle would make those rival clans proud.


(Clan leaders William "Devil Anse" Hatfield, Randolph "Rand'l" McCoy. Source: tourpikecounty)


Indeed, SolarEdge's chief rival, Enphase Energy, is heating up the feud with the
launch of a potential game-changer. One solar contractor predicts Enphase's new
battery backup system for homes will make SolarEdge technology virtually
obsolete.


And risks just keep piling up against this solar power systems inverter. (Inverters
change solar panels' DC electricity into AC or alternative current for use by in-home
appliances and community electricity grids).


When the gunsmoke clears this time, a most unfortunate loser will stumble out ...
current SolarEdge stockholders.


Investors may find other viewpoints on Israel-based SolarEdge here. Meanwhile,
TheStreetSweeper presents a brief executive summary, followed by details on the
top reasons we dislike this stock.


Executive bullet points:
  


*Extreme insider selling exceeding $25 million. What do they know that the market
has missed?


  
*Singularly focused rival Enphase pressures SolarEdge with new technology and
severe, continuing price cuts.


  
*SolarEdge has been forced to cut prices. And its new rollout has been delayed by
as much as half a year.


  
*Chinese vendors are crowding into the commercial side of SolarEdge’s business
with bargain rate products, likely forcing more price cuts.





*1. Smart Insiders: Bid SolarEdge Stock Goodbye


Insiders have been unloading their company stock. Year-to-date, insiders have sold
well over $25 million worth of stock - an action that could be a sell signal for other
investors, too.

Indeed, insider buying is virtually nonexistent compared with insider selling:

Maybe insiders know something the market has missed ... something like the
following huge risks....


*2. Grudge Match: Old Nemesis Plots Revenge - Aggressive Price Cuts, New
Tech


Not long ago, Enphase Energy (ENPH) was a big ol' boy in the business.


The maker of solar microinverters claimed bragging rights until SolarEdge came
along with a cheaper alternative and stole away market share.


A grudge match ensued. Now Enphase is determined to shove SolarEdge aside by
introducing new technology and aggressive price cuts.


*3. Kicker: "Rolls Royce" Enphase Ups The Game


"Enphase ... is the Rolls Royce of all inverters in the industry," according to a solar
contractor who spoke with TheStreetSweeper.


He said Enphase has introduced a battery backup for homes that is incompatible
with SolarEdge.


The SolarEdge technology involves DC current that must be converted to usable
energy before it can charge a battery. Enphase's microinverter, however, has
already converted DC to usable AC energy that charges the battery. 


(Source: Enphase)


The new AC battery is part of the Enphase system, including microinverter,
networking hub and an energy tracking system that lets homes and businesses
monitor how much solar energy they are generating and using. Then the system
determines whether the solar energy should be stored or used.


(Source: Enphase energy storage system)


Enphase launched the AC battery last month in Australia and New Zealand as part
of its international expansion. The United States launch is planned later this year.


"We expect the initial demand to be driven by installers looking to retrofit existing
residential solar PV systems," Enphase executive Nathan Dun told PV Magazine.
"Emphase expects the next wave of demand to be driven by new solar PV system
owners enticed by the elegance and simplicity of our solution"


If people like the new Enphase system well enough, SolarEdge could lose serious
market share...

Indeed, informed investors couldn't be blamed for walking away as downside risks
mount up for this South Carolina manufacturer of capacitors - battery-like gizmos
that store electric energy.


Kemet entities have been slapped with investigations or inquiries into alleged anti-
competitive actions by: *The United States; *China; *Europe; *Brazil; *South Korea;
*Taiwan; *Singapore; *Japan.


Yet the stock turned upward as Kemet reported a quarterly earnings miss and $183
million revenue down 5% year over year; as well as settlement of one of these
investigations.


This misunderstanding-fueled rally grows more ludicrous when we consider three
factors.


*First, filings show lawsuits, verdicts and investigations - for March 2015-March
2016 alone - cost Kemet about 6.1 billion yen or $58 million. 


*Second, price-fixing probes are not over yet. The company and subsidiaries are
defendants in multiple ongoing global investigations into price fixing and bid rigging
conspiracies by capacitor manufacturers.


*Third, Kemet may be on the hook to pay ~$400 million to acquire the "one who
done him wrong."


While investors may find other viewpoints here, TheStreetSweeper's top executive
bullet points on Kemet's downside risks include:


 *Falling sales
 *Low margins 
 *Numerous rivals scratching and clawing for the same business


 *Unreasonably expensive planned total acquisition that faces more price-fixing
inquiries/investigations


 *Uncertain future costs associated with its planned acquisition, which has already
pleaded guilty to criminal price-fixing


 *Junk bond ratings
 *Excessive executive compensation


 *Insiders yell, "Sell!"


Below, TheStreetSweeper presents details on why we believe Kemet stock is
perfectly tuned to fall back toward sanity.


*1. Calling Dr. Phil: Troubled Relationship Begins


Kemet paid $50 million three years ago for a 34% stake in Nec Tokin - the partner it
intends to buy in its entirety.


But Nec Tokin has pled guilty to criminal price fixing. The US Department of Justice
determined that from April 2002 to December 2013, Kemet's partner had been
"conspiring ... to fix prices" for capacitors in America.


FBI Special Agent David J. Johnson stated: “For over a decade and through various
financial crises, NEC Tokin has exploited American consumers and fixed the price
of capacitors..."


Investigators said the company had set prices using code names and misleading
justifications "to cover up their collusive conduct."


Nec Tokin pleaded guilty Jan. 21, 2016 and was sentenced to pay a $13.8 million
criminal fine.


Also, Taiwan slapped fines on Nec Tokin and other Japanese companies involved in
an alleged price-fixing cartel, while EU, South Korea, Brazil and Singapore continue
investigating such allegations.


Despite the market's misunderstanding, Kemet continues to defend itself and its
entities (pages 20-21) in ongoing antitrust lawsuits.


But how much has Nec Tokin gotten to Kemet thus far? .... Read on ...

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 91/226


GenMark Diagnostics (GNMK) stock is just about to get a shot of reality. And the jab
will go straight into stockholders' hearts and wallets.


GenMark is a never-profitable Carlsbad, California company that sells diagnostic
testing equipment used to sniff out viruses, bacteria and problems such as
sensitivity to Warfarin. The company is struggling with:


*Financing is already registered and dilutive stock selling could be imminent.


*Event fueling the company's stock rally - CE Mark designation - is now worthless.


*A common, virtually indistinguishable product.


*Wealthy dog-eat-dog competitors, more favorably valued.


*Highly compensated, low-performing management.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper provides
details of the top seven reasons we believe risky, expensive GenMark stock is
supremely poised to swoon.


*1. Wait For It, Wait For It: Stock Offering


The last thing investors want to see is a big stock offering that will dilute the shares
they're holding.


But that's exactly what GenMark has ready to go. Stock worth $30 million (over 3
million shares) may now be sold at any time:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


Shareholders won't have long to wait to feel the sting of dilution...


What's more once those 3 million or so shares are sold, GenMark can always go
back and clean off the shelf. An overhang of another $95 million worth of potentially
dilutive stock - about 10 million shares or so - is just waiting to be sold at the drop of
a hat.


The timing is perfect to sell stock because shares have been flirting around the
year's record.


Why has the stock popped?


Ah, that's another story. It's a story that ultimately turned on GenMark like some sort
of mad scientist ...


*2. Company's CE Mark: Now Worthless


The company desperately needed good news after investors fled the stock in early
May. People were irritated by the earnings report showing revenue had slightly
beaten consensus as it sluggishly moved to ~$11 million. Earnings had missed
consensus, falling more deeply into the red at $-12.96 million.


The stock reflected company struggles as the price dropped from around $5.70 to
$5.25 per share.


(Source: Yahoo Finance)


GenMark had been chasing the CE Mark since 2012. Managers could have
expected CE news to drive up the stock as it cleared the way for ePlex testing
system sales in Europe.


Seemingly fortunate at the time, GenMark announced on June 8, 2016 that it had
received its CE Mark designation. Sure enough, the stock smashed above $9.40
per share.

Then the unexpected happened. Less than three weeks after GenMark got its CE
Mark, Britain shocked the world by voting to exit the European Union.


The historic trade barriers previously knocked down by the CE Mark have now
jumped back up. GenMark wasted all those years and millions (~$3 million)
pursuing the designation.


Unfortunately, Britain hasn't negotiated a trade deal since the European Union
materialized in the 1970s. So now the sovereign state is scrambling ... at wit's end,
apparently ...    


       to negotiate new trade arrangements. 


(Source: The New York Times)


So everyone had pinned great hope on the newly CE Mark-approved ePlex launch
in Europe in the third quarter.


But the CE Mark is now worthless to GenMark.


*3. The Big Sting: Executive Compensation


While the company loses millions, executives are raking in millions. Our chart
shows top executives' compensation.

Nearly $9 million - including $3 million for the chief executive alone - seems
generous.


After all, GenMark lost more than that last quarter ... nearly $13 million.

investors will want to run the opposite direction.


So today's wildly overvalued SGRY is poised to become tomorrow's laggard.


The company stock hit the Nasdaq last October, opening at $17.55 per share, far
below the expected $23-$26 range. The disappointed company focusing on short-
stay surgical centers needed every penny possible to help repay more than $1
billion in debt.


We've been looking at what you pay for the stock versus what you get for it.


Indeed, SGRY appears to be the type of stock billionaire investor Carl Icahn
referred to when he issued a recent warning. He said stock prices have been
pushed artificially high but lack the economic fundamentals to support those prices.


The guy who grew up on the mean streets of Queens recently rattled cages of the
nation's shareholders when he predicted a "day of reckoning" will correct this
imbalance (video here).


(Source: YouTube)


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, check out
TheStreetSweeper's top six reasons we consider SGRY a "day of reckoning" poster
child...


*1. Overpriced Today: Laggard Tomorrow


SGRY sports an outlandishly high valuation ... A price-to-earnings ratio of 639.


That's right.


Stocks with high valuations are shouting to investors, "We're really expensive. You
can bet it'll be tough to live up to these expectations!"


The Wall Street Journal reports that the most expensive stocks - measured by
various valuation metrics - have underperformed the S&P 500 by 5 percentage
points yearly, lagging in 25 of the last 35 years.


Rivals Surgical Care and AmSurg are bargains compared with SGRY. In each of
four critical measurements, SGRY comes out in the red:


(Source: Yahoo Finance, here, here, here)


We can't imagine how anyone can justify paying 25 or 42 times more for a company
that offers a fraction of competitors' value .... and is unprofitable to boot.


*2. Earnings: Extremely Inefficient As Competition Rises


Small surgical centers are popping up all over the country. Competitors are vying for
every other street corner and every doctor who wants to perform surgery on every
hurt knee or misaligned jaw.

Relypsa (RLYP): Eight Reasons We Wouldn't Run Away & Join This Circus


Relypsa (Nasdaq: RLYP) is a misunderstood dog-and-pony show that shines a light
on its one and only trick pony, Veltassa.


Relypsa fans keep the show going by sticking a carrot out in front of investors.
Indeed, the company's oh-so-benevolent stock promoters - plus a short squeeze
that we believe is now over - have managed to push the stock to nosebleed levels.
Now there's nothing but air left in the stock.


Investors may check here for other viewpoints on the Redwood City, California-
based chronic money-loser with one lonely drug to its name and a cash burn rate of
~$300 million. Meanwhile, here are TheStreetSweeper's top eight reasons this
stock is riskier than a colicky circus pony:


*1. Sole Drug: Cheap Castoff


The market has missed a telling issue regarding Relypsa and its only drug.


The company acquired the potassium-lowering drug, Veltassa, for just $12.5 million,
according to the SEC filing.


But the seller, Ilypsa, didn't even bother to keep a percentage of any royalties:


"We do not have any royalty obligation under the IP License Agreement with respect to Veltassa, and
in March 2013, we satisfied our sole milestone payment obligation with respect to Veltassa with a
payment of $12.5 million...


"While the IP License Agreement does require that we make certain royalty payments on sales of
covered products, other than in respect of sales of Veltassa, we are not currently developing any
covered products under the IP License Agreement."


If the developer had any faith in Veltassa's intellectual property, it would have never
sold that property on the cheap ... especially without hanging onto at least some royalties.


Ilypsa just wanted to unload the drug.


Relypsa's sales indicate the seller was smart to take the money and run... Read on
...


*2. Free Drug, Doc? Thanks, Not Really


Veltassa got cleared last fall to treat excessively high blood potassium or
hyperkalemia. But not before the FDA had attached the dreaded "black box"
warning label. The agency concluded the drug dangerously binds with other oral
drugs, thus decreasing their effectiveness.


The stock got crushed because the FDA's strictest warning greatly limits the drug's
possible uses - specifically not in critical life-or-death situations. Relypsa has rushed
to submit more data in hopes the FDA might lift the black box warning.


The company began shipping the drug late last December. But Relypsa can barely
give the drug away:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story

Mitek Systems (MITK): Looking For A Nose-Dive





We occasionally see company insiders sell shares to pay their massive tax bill
(Facebook guru Mark Zuckerberg's 2014 tax bill hit an estimated $2 billion plus).


Or they sell stock to fund their big fat Greek weddings. Or to settle their messy
divorces (oil tycoon Harold Hamm settled with his ex for $974,790,317.77).


But Mitek Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: MITK) insiders have steadily unloaded massive
amounts of stock since November - when the share price began rocketing by some
170 percent to the current ~$9 per share ... ah, yes, maybe the peak before the
plunge.


Altogether in that timeframe, Mitek insiders have dumped about $9 million worth of
company stock. 


That's right. And that's why insider selling tops TheStreetSweeper's list of seven
good reasons we think Mitek stock is poised to flip faster than Madonna in her
famous on-stage nose-dive. Investors may also find other viewpoints on Mitek, the
San Diego-based mobile imaging technology and software provider here.


*1. Insiders Yell: "Sell! Sell! Sell!"


Insiders' trading trigger fingers started getting itchy when the stock run really picked
up speed back in November 2015:


(Sources: Company SEC filings; Nasdaq.com)


It's always a concern when company leaders start selling their stock.


But selling of this magnitude is extreme.


It could suggest that insiders may be losing faith in their company's future, may
understand something the rest of us don't or may be wanting to sell at the peak
before the stock breaks down.


*2. Company's Intellectual Property: Weak
A chief worry about Mitek goes straight to the foundation of its business. The
intellectual property is weak.


Here's why ...


A. The company thought so little of its own IP that it withdrew its patent
infringement lawsuit.


"Let 'em have it," Mitek essentially said in 2014 after dropping the lawsuit against
Top Image (TISA), explaining that "the cost of litigating the case would be higher
than any potential financial benefit to Mitek."


Both parties agreed to cover their respective legal costs. That was it. Settlement
reached.


Top Image stated: "Mitek realized that their case against TIS was weak and their
patent portfolio was ineffective."


B. A patent infringement lawsuit bloodies Mitek's nose - and damages a major
revenue source.


Mitek and former client USAA had been battling it out in court for years.

Then Mitek suffered a major blow in mid-2014 when a federal court threw out its
infringement claims against USAA.


In lockstep, Mitek's chief technology officer suddenly departed "to pursue other
opportunities."


A couple of weeks later in September 2014, the company settled with USAA with
devastating results. The whole mess frustrated investors who exited Mitek stock,
crushing the price by 60 percent.


The sucker punch: Under the settlement, USAA now gets to use Mitek's check
deposit software for free.


So Mitek has forever lost part of a revenue stream.


While Mitek sustains this revenue loss, the company finds itself in the midst of a
growing tangle of fierce competitors all vying for the very same customers.


But first, guess who proceeded to show up Mitek? Ol' nemesis USAA ... Read on...

Vuzix Corp. (VUZI): Let The Caterwauling Begin








Struggling Vuzix (VUZI) reported losing millions last quarter on revenue that
dropped 55% from a year earlier. Yet stock in the video eyewear company quickly
returned to absurdly lofty levels - - afloat on paid promotions and a lingering
misunderstood story.


TheStreetSweeper believes the 26 cents per share losses might not look too bad
compared to what may come next.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, consider TheStreetSweeper's
top eight reasons why all the screaming about this stock will likely soon turn into
caterwauling:


*1. Hype: Paid Stock Promoters


Vuzix stock has fallen into the unfortunate hype-fest category. It has been promoted
by at least 21 professional campaigns.


Paid promoter MicroCapResearch pushed out a lengthy Vuzix promotion just last
week, on May 17. On Tuesday, May 24, various posts linked to the promo.


At the bottom of the long newsletter promotion, a disclosure shows some generous
third party dished out big bucks to promote Vuzix:


Click on the disclaimer/terms of use and investors will find: "Since MicrocapResearch.com
may sometimes receive compensation from, and its owners, operators and affiliates may hold stock in, the profiled
companies, there is an inherent conflict of interest in MicrocapResearch.com statements and opinions and such
statements and opinions cannot be considered independent."


(Source: MicroCapResearch)


Also, out of the goodness of its heart, Star Media paid $15,000 for another recent
"investor awareness campaign" hyping Vuzix.

Paid stock promotions like these offer an excellent way to spot a desperate, often
troubled company. Stable companies with real products and a real future don't need
or want such stock promotions.


Indeed, some of the recent fluff picked up by investors came from the company
itself ...

MGT Capital: Heading Retail Investors To The Slaughterhouse


MGT Capital Investments (MGT) just may be the most self-promoted, worthless,
risky stock we've ever observed.


Now, in our opinion, the company is poised to lead retail investors gently to
slaughter.


You see, MGT stock is flying on tweets and Facebook page promotions from
controversial wild man, John McAfee. The fallen icon will become the company's
"proposed Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer," the company
announced.


And MGT has bought Mr. McAfee's old anti-spy asset, D-vasive. Though the press
release doesn't explain this, D-Vasive is a product of Mr. McAfee's Future Tense
Secure Systems,, the company which will now be consulting for MGT. MGT paid
$300,000 cash and millions of cheap-o shares for the questionable privilege of
taking Mr. McAfee's languishing property and try to breathe commercial life into it.


Now Mr. McAfee is hyping his new company. And unwary stockholders are buying
into tweeted comments that we believe are material - and deserving of Securities
and Exchange Commission attention.


In a nutshell, it becomes clear who benefits from this deal:


*Mr. McAfee gets paid for something he already owns.


*The company pays for D-vasive, Mr. McAfee's anti-spy property that has been
virtually ignored.


*Mr. McAfee gets a job.


*Newly issued shares increase value for Mr. McAfee.


*A low-value app gets some fleeting attention.


But this MGT combo is now perfectly priced for a tooth-rattling drop when investors
realize the massive risk they're holding onto right now.

MGT Capital: Retail Investors To Get Herded To Slaughter House


TheStreetSweeper almost hopes the MGT Capital Management (MGT) pump will
hold. If it does, we'll tell investors all about one of the most incredibly over-hyped,
useless stocks we've ever observed.


MGT stock is flying on word that the world's most controversial once-super-wealthy
man who's essentially hit the skids - John McAfee - will become the company's
"proposed Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer." 


The stock is hyped by formerly super wealthy McAfee who watched his net worth of
more than $100 million nose dive to about $4 million in 2009.


You see, MGT paid $300,000 cash and 4.76 million cheapo shares to take McAfee's
property off his hands.


The company has going concern issues and even filed a late 10-Q ... blazing red
flags that suggest the company is headed down and out.


So it's no surprise this desperate duo - McAfee and company - are promoting the
heck out of McAfee's old "D-vasive" asset.


But it seems they can hardly give D-vasive away. We'll get into the miserable
downloads ... and oh so much more.


Stay tuned....we're working up a full report explaining how unbelievably risky this
stock is at this level.


* Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in MGT and stand to profit
on any future declines in the stock price.

Coeur Mining (CDE): Debt-ridden, Overvalued Miner Just Discloses New $75 Million ATM


Coeur Mining (NYSE: CDE) shareholders may have missed a series of under-the-
radar actions that pose additional significant risk to their investment.


Coeur netted $367 million in losses last year and reported half-a-billion in debt.
Nevertheless, the junior miner managed to dig its way into stock portfolios of
everyone from the next-door-neighbor to teachers' funds to retirement funds.


The Chicago-based silver and gold miner and its peers have risen over the last few
months in concert with improved metal prices.


But let's step back in time to about an hour after the closing bell rang on Friday, May
13th. Most traders had just loosened their ties and begun enjoying their weekends
when ...





Bam! At 5:11 p.m., Coeur filed a surprise ATM document with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.


*The Late-Hour Stock Offering Notice


We knew they needed capital but it came even earlier than we had anticipated.
Indeed, that after-market notification cleared the way for Coeur to sell up to $75
million worth of stock using the at-the-market filing.


What the ATM filing (here) means is this: Coeur and BMO have joined hands to
raise cash through stock sales.


The more stock that hits the market, the more dilution to the stock already in shareholders'
hands.


*Hungry Gorilla


And that $75 million offering? Unless the stock price falls out of bed and disrupts
Coeur's plan ... it's likely just the beginning of the dilution coming at shareholders.


Coeur is like the hungry gorilla you try to feed just one banana. The beast pounds
his chest and shrieks for more ... and more ... and more.


So the cash-hungry miner will demand far more, we believe, to stay in the game
after the entire $75 million-worth of stock sales is shot.

Trupanion (TRUP): This Dog Insurance Stock Is Begging To Drop


Trupanion's (TRUP) recent stock rally may have the market wagging its tail but
we've begun digging into the fundamentals. Consequently, we're yelling "Bad dog!"
at the wayward pet insurance company.


Seattle-based Trupanion is a pet insurance company founded in 2000 by young
technical school graduate Darryl Rawlings. Mr. Rawlings initially started selling
cigars from his car to aficionados in western Canada. After a few years and a retail
presence, he snuffed out the cigar biz and began selling pet insurance. The
company went public in 2014 and has accumulated $74 million in losses since then.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper offers
seven good reasons to send Trupanion back to doggie obedience school:


*1. Over 2 Million Shares: Looming Stock Sale


Within 60 days of April 1 – that would be June 1 - insiders will be able to sell ~2.19
million shares of stock. That boatload options poses a potentially significant risk of
dilution and tremendous pressure on the stock.


Our chart breaks down warrants, options, restricted stock units and convertibles
that executives and directors will be allowed to convert to common stock and sell
within a month:


(Source: Company regulatory filings)


That stock release is a negative catalyst for current shareholders. But still more
stock-selling issues dog Trupanion ...


*2. Insiders Yell, "Sell!"


Trupanion's own CEO pushed the "sell" button just last week. Under his auto trading
plan, CEO Darryl Rawlings sent 3,500 shares to the public market at just about
$12.63 per share.

Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP): Compounding Risk


A private company that is a walking liability has been acquired by Adamis
Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ADMP), posing an incredible danger to the public.


Yet when Adamis announced it was paying ~$9.7 million in stock for the little
Arkansas drug store dogged by a big product recall, the uninformed market
cheered.


Incredibly, fevered buying continued, sending Adamis shares this morning to a
multi-year high of over $9 per share.


TheStreetSweeper presents six key risks poised to hammer this stock back down to
sanity.


*1. Terrible Acquisition


Shares blew up on news that Adamis would be acquiring US Compounding in a
stock deal worth nearly $10 million.


What investors didn't understand was what Adamis got for its investment.


Adamis has acquired a company that recently recalled ALL of its sterile products
nationwide, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. In fact, the recall is
ongoing (here) for more than 70 veterinary products.


(Source: FDA)


Click here to see the recall list affecting patients, clinics, providers and hospitals
nationwide.


All US Compounding sterile products were recalled because the FDA is concerned
about sterility.


The recalled human and veterinary products were distributed from March 14, 2015
to September 9, 2015. Before the recall, customers had filed 108 formal complaints
with the FDA about US Compounding products.


When the FDA walked in one day last August to inspect the little drug store, agents
uncovered their own long list of issues. The problems they discovered spanned 11
pages, here.


Nevertheless, under the acquisition agreement, Adamis will pay the US
Compounding CEO more than 866,000 shares plus a $300,000 yearly job with
Adamis.


And what will Adamis receive for its investment?


In return, Adamis has gotten $5.7 million worth of debt, the challenge of trying to
squeeze some revenue from a troubled drug store, plus a huge dose of liability
exposure ... as evidenced by that company's recall "due to deficient practices."


If Adamis had been serious about building a compounding business, it would not
have bought a company with deficient practices, sterility concerns and a massive
recall under its belt.


*2. Why US Compounding Put Itself Up For Sale


US Compounding found itself in a pickle. Its name had been indelibly tainted by last
winter's recall.

Great Panther Silver (GPL): Perfectly Priced To Cave In?


Great Panther Silver (NYSE: GPL) stands at the brink of a teeth-chattering stock
decline.


Over the course of the past year and a half, stock in the Canadian silver mining
company settled in below $1 per share, sometimes falling to 30 cents.


Then shares suddenly blew up. Did this happen because the company hit a rich
vein of silver?


Not at all. Rather than Panther suddenly hitting on fortune and reversing
shareholders' negative return on equity, the stock has been shored up by ambitious
stock promoters. Now Great Panther appears perfectly priced to drop.


Here are the top six reasons TheStreetSweeper is shouting, "Look out below!"


*1. Why Great Panther's Stock Is Up: Jonathan Lebed Special
After seven months of trading between ~40 cents and ~$1 per share, Panther stock
suddenly blew up in late April:


(Source: Nasdaq)


What happened? Well, Panther can primarily thank a well-known stock promoter.


Indeed, last Thursday, on April 28, 2016, National Inflation Association sent out a
stock promotion to thousands of email recipients. The hype began like this:


(Source: National Inflation Association)


Despite the name of the sender, this email and others like it have nothing to do with
the organization's purported mission of fighting inflation. NIA is not some quasi-
governmental agency sworn to help people but instead is all about enriching the
NIA.


Jonathan Lebed is the main man standing behind the NIA's flimsy curtain of
respectability. Mr. Lebed attracted national attention in 2001 when the Securities
and Exchange Commission accused the then-teenager of manipulating stock in a
pump-and-dump scheme. Without admitting any wrongdoing, he settled for
$285,000.


Mr. Lebed commented:


(Source: New York Times )


Mr. Lebed has been a key figure in stories by TheStreetSweeper and publications
such as The New York Times, which wrote of Mr. Lebed's stock trading activities:


"This type of stock fraud is hardly victimless. When a stock price rose from $1.38 to
$4.69 on the strength of his false recommendations, then fell to $1.88 after his
manipulation stopped, there were winners and losers."

p pp
The recent NIA/Johnathan Lebed promotion on Panther is merely the latest in a
long string of hype that has inflated the stock.


Mr. Lebed has been cheerleading Panther periodically since 2014. Back in August
2014, Lebed.biz emailed a promotion to thousands mentioning Panther under its
Toronto Stock Exchange trading symbol of GPR. The hype said in part:


There's a huge fundamental problem with promoted stocks, arguably most
especially those promoted by Mr. Lebed.


Such stock promotions themselves push up the share price. So the stock price
increase typically is not a reflection of any good business practices or even good
luck experienced by the company.


That means the share price will virtually always drop. Because there's nothing but
fluff supporting the price.


*2. Kiss Of Death: Rodman & Renshaw


Panther investors need to understand two unfortunate, crucial actions by investor
Rodman & Renshaw.


First, Rodman & Renshaw - which was a key institution investigated during the
Chinese stock fraud issues of 2010 to 2013 - raised its target price for Panther from
$1.10 per share to $1.50 on April 14.


Panther stock rose.


Next, on April 20 - six days later - the firm inked a deal with Panther for a $10
million at-the-market (ATM) facility.


By that time, the stock had jumped 33 percent from the day of the price target upgrade
to $1.48 on the day Panther and Rodman & Renshaw signed the deal.

Back To Earth For Skyline Corp. (SKY)


 
An odd case of mistaken identity has sent Skyline Corp. (SKY) stock on a thrilling
flight upward ... where it is perfectly poised for decline.
Skyline shares have traded around $4 for the past year or so. That price looked
high for a mobile home company that has lost money for the last seven years and
offered shareholders a negative equity exceeding -14%.
But one day, the share price jumped about 89 percent and then rose another 28
percent to around $11 per share.
What is most stunning is why the price apparently took that leap.
And that reason is a key point in this StreetSweeper alert that highlights Skyline's
seven most seriously misunderstood and overlooked negatives:
*1. Mistaken Identity
Skyline shares took off the very day that a completely unrelated company issued
big news.
On March 9, a news report hit Skyline's news feed on Yahoo Finance with a story
headlined, "Vice's new TV channel Viceland will launch on Sky TV in the UK in
September."
Bam! People bought Skyline stock.
There was just one problem.
Skyline is a trailer and module home seller ...

(Source: Skyline website)
And ...
Sky is a UK entertainment company ....


(Source: Sky news website)
 
Skyline and Sky have nothing to do with one other.
 
The story was based on Sky's announcement that it will launch a new TV channel in
the UK and Ireland this fall. Good news for those folks. But a United Kingdom-
based TV channel is about as far removed from an Indiana-based mobile home
seller as you can get.
 
This line in the story picked up by Yahoo Finance stirred up things even more:
 
"Fox — owned by Rupert Murdoch — has a 39% stake in Sky and a 5% stake in
Vice."
 
As shown here, Mr. Murdoch does hold a stake in Sky, the entertainment company.
 
But rest assured, the billionaire who oversees a vast media empire, has no
ownership in a mobile home company named Skyline, which trades under the symbol "SKY."
 
The story just got tangled up in Skyline's news headline feed, shown here. The
article should be taken down.
 
Once the dramatic mix-up dies down, Skyline investors will be left with six more
sobering realities poised to further drive down the price of this dull mobile home
company...
 
*2. Skyline Loses Millions Yearly
Skyline has struggled for years to create net income and in fiscal year 2016 finally
netted a meager $352,000.
The stock resumed its trajectory after the recent earnings report showed slightly
improved finances.
But net losses have historically exceeded $10 million for each of the previous five
years.

Almaden Minerals (AAU): Six Reasons Why This Stock Is Fool's Gold


Almaden Minerals (AAU) stock has shot up on misconceptions surrounding a highly
speculative gold mine projected to cost more than $1 billion, while the company has only a
measly $2-or-$3 million in the kitty.


Meanwhile, promotions have pushed the unprofitable company’s stock even as losses race on
beyond $59 million.


Before any more investors put another penny into this kettle of fool’s gold, we present these
executive bullet points that point to downside risks:


1.The company kitty contains only several million dollars, yet its sole mine prospect, the Ixtaca
project, would cost over $1 billion total; $28 million for construction alone.


 2.Ixtaca’s large pits appear to be economically marginal or unfeasible, suggest notes by
authors of a preliminary study.


 3. The company justified a likely pending stock offering by pitching its $6.5 million option deal
to buy a Nome, Alaska mill as a way to reduce Ixtaca expenses.


 4. Unaware of the likely stock dilution, the market actually pushed up the stock price ...
primarily thanks to professional stock promoters.


 5. Some institutions have recently sold out of their Almaden holdings.
 6. Almaden's largely inferior financial position, low return on equity and other notable


weaknesses spurred a recent and rare "Sell" rating.


TheStreetSweeper offers the following six reasons that Almaden appears precariously poised
for a huge decline:


*1. Ixtaca Project: Risky $1 Billion Bet


Hype surrounding a study indicating possible gold and silver reserves at its Ixtaca project in
Mexico escalated the stock price some 70 percent almost overnight to a 52-week high. But the
market doesn't realize that any Ixtaca mining is projected to bust the budget.


Construction costs alone, according to the pre-feasibility study, would take $28 million. And
total initial costs could reach or exceed a whopping $100.2 million.


Stunningly, construction costs plus sustaining costs associated with the Ixtaca project are
expected to exceed $1.1 billion (table 1-5) - practically a thousand times greater than Almaden's
cash reserve.


Yet Almaden's cash is a tiny, tiny sliver of that amount.


(Source: Company SEC filings)


Our estimates are based on cash reserves falling to just $6.2 million on December 31, and a
burn rate of about $2.47 million a quarter.


Projecting those assumptions over 1 ½ quarters, cash has now probably dropped to between
$2.5 million and $3.7 million …  about 10 percent of construction requirements, about 2

percent of needed initial capital and a fraction of a percent of the sustaining expenses,
assuming mining ever takes place.


*2. Non-Cherry Picked Pit: Negative Financial Returns


Ixtaca’s large pits - which were not selected for study - appear to be economically marginal or
unfeasible, suggest notes by authors of the preliminary feasibility study.


While the pits that were selected for study may produce minerals worthy of mining and could
perhaps pay back in 2.6 years, authors say it’s all very risky …


“The economic results are based on the potentially mineable tonnages in the selected
ultimate pit…The reader is further cautioned that the preliminary economic assessment
is preliminary in nature, and that there is no certainty that the preliminary economic
assessment will be realized.”


Most importantly, authors wrote:


“The selected (undiscounted) ultimate pit limit is chosen where the incrementally larger
pits produce marginal or negative economic returns.”


So in a nutshell: the larger pits likely will pay off very little or won’t pay off at all.


*3. Previous Action: Dilution Looms


Just last October, Almaden announced what amounts to three years of stock dilution required
to buy a mine that was mothballed over seven years ago.


The company pitched a $6.5 million option deal to buy the Nome, Alaska mill (closed in part
due to “problems with mineral reserves”) saying that the deal would reduce costs to get Ixtaca
rolling.


“The Rock Creek mill only operated for several months before the mining operation was curtailed in
2008 and has been kept in excellent condition during subsequent care and maintenance.”


The old equipment will be dismantled (Almaden contends in an email to us that the equipment
was used six weeks and has been on “care and maintenance” since it was mothballed back in
2008). Then the equipment will be barged 4,300 miles from Alaska to Ixtaca east of Mexico
City, Mexico, for possible use at Ixtaca.


Almaden’s corporate development vice president, Donald McDonald, told TheStreetSweeper
that the company has depended on stock offerings and joint venture-sales deals to operate for
30 years. And “continued development activity at Ixtaca is subject to our ability to raise capital
from equity, debt and/or other traditional sources…”


So the deal is poised to dilute shares if Almaden proceeds with the option to buy Rock Creek
by 2018.


Yet the market happily bought into the story.


Here’s why …


*4. Hello: Stock Promoter


Almaden’s stock recently went crazy after the market bought into an e-newsletter campaign
launched by professional stock promoter Broad Street Alerts.


On April 7, 2016, a release headlined, “Compelling Gold and Silver Project at Almaden
Minerals,” promoted the company report, here. The author was paid up to $250 a shot for
redistribution rights and Broad Street cautions:


“Our reports/releases are a commercial advertisement and are for general information
purposes ONLY. We are engaged in the business of marketing and advertising companies
for monetary compensation.”


TheStreetSweeper asked if Almaden managers were aware of the Broad Street promotion or
made any sort of payment to the firm or its associates.

Why Real Industry (RELY) Can't Turn Net Losses, Recycled Aluminum and Face Cream Into
Gold


Real Industry’s (NasdaqGS: RELY) mishmash business of selling face cream and recycling
aluminum is unreal in and of itself. Then mix in its price-to-earnings ratio…


And investors will find a ludicrous 1,037 P/E, while the scrap metal industry's P/E is just 11.


Stocks trading at extremely high P/E ratios are great stocks to avoid. Overvalued stocks are
more likely to suffer future losses than stocks trading at lower P/Es.


Add the enormous P/E ratio to recent insider selling and investors begin to get a glimpse of
numerous downside risks piling up against Real.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 107/226


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, let's consider those ramping risks:


*1. Net Carry Forward: Not Real Revenue


A couple of promotional pieces, here, have apparently been misinterpreted, resulting in
support for Real’s stock price. The piece comments that the company operates on a plan of
taking tax advantages based on net operating losses (NOLs).


An NOL is not the way to build a business.


Only a truly troubled company would try to build a reputation on taking a tax advantage based
on losing millions of dollars.


Yet someone holding shares of the stock has gone out and promoted that effort on the
Seeking Alpha financial website.


The author added: "We are happy with the performance so far. We didn't buy the stock only for
its aluminum business, we bought it because of the NOLs, and the management's disciplined
capital allocation."


Racking up losses and calling them tax benefits - and then having someone crow about it -
may work for a little while.


But to take advantage of those losses, the company has to have a positive operating income -
something Real has missed in three of the last four years.


The overarching issue is this: Organic growth is the lifeblood of solid companies. Any growth –
and all planned growth for Real – depends on acquisitions and NOLs. That's not a great
growth plan.


*2. The Foundation: Rollup Company


At its very foundation, Real is a rollup company.


And Wall Street is strewn with battered remnants of rollup companies much like Real. Studies
show that 70 percent to 90 percent of mergers and acquisitions fail. Failures are undoubtedly
even greater for rollup companies with acquisition after acquisition after acquisition.


What happens is that all too often, companies simply choose the wrong candidate, pay too
much and don’t know how to integrate the new business, suggests Harvard Business Review.


Unfortunate mergers include Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, which culminated with Daimler-Benz
spending hundreds of millions to sever the deal after management realized lower-income folks
didn’t fit with the luxury car business; and Kmart and Sears, a mishmash of poor inventory
investment and sub-par locations that has left the retailer's stock price whimpering to an all-
time low.


*3. Former Subprime Lender: Operating Losses Grow


Since emerging from bankruptcy proceedings initiated in 2010 under the legacy business
called Fremont – a subprime loan lender - the company has reported significant net losses
from business operations:

BioPath Holdings Inc. (BPTH): Why A Bad Golf Company Won't Make A Good Gene Therapy
Company


BioPath Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: BPTH) has swung and sliced to the right. Now it hopes
investors will run after the ball. 


The company spent six years fruitlessly trying to make a buck selling ugly pants, clashing
shirts and other golf paraphernalia. It eventually made the unlikely transformation into ...  gene
therapy.


But BioPath is still missing the ball and almost certainly will continue to do so as this company
attempts to produce a drug delivery platform.


Indeed, the new company presents these massive risks for investment portfolios:


* Reverse Merger; Inexperienced Management: The
CEO/CFO/Treasurer/Chairman/President reverse merged a golf company to create a biotech.
He is among the company's four leaders with virtually no experience in biotech. 


* Unfortunate Supporter: Recent support from Rodman & Renshaw is good reason for
investors to avoid BioPath.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 108/226


* Uncertain Revenue Generation: Any possible product sales are distant dreams. The top
drug candidate is only in Phase II study. The second candidate is approaching Phase II. So
the prospects must get through one to two more phases of study before even going after FDA
approval to market the drug. 


* Fierce Competition: No one knows whether the drug candidates will succeed and some
experts are skeptical. Meanwhile, many established companies are developing strong
therapies for the same patients.


* Low Institutional Interest: Five institutions have sold out, including a particularly
noteworthy investor.


* Stock Dilution Looms: BioPath's cash has fallen to an estimated $7.65 million. At a $1.25
million quarterly burn rate, it will take a significant cash transfusion to proceed with trials and
business operations. A big ATM brimming with share dilution potential is poised.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, here are details on the top six reasons
TheStreetSweeper is convinced BioPath's drug game will be no better than its golf game.


*1. Odd Beginning


So it all began in 2000 when Ogden Golf Corp. opened and began selling golf items in Ogden,
Utah.


After six straight years of losses and nothing to show for it but over-tapped friends and family,
the board apparently realized the golf course would not drive the company straight to wealth
and happiness. So managers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
began selling shares for 50 cents apiece and looked around for business ideas.


They found that idea in the most unlikely of places ...


*2. Reverse Merger; Inexperienced Management.


Two years after Ogden Golf closed, the CEO/CFO/Treasurer/Chairman/President decided to
reverse merge his golf company to create BioPath Holdings in 2008.


But, while Peter Nielsen may know golfing, he lacks biotech or healthcare leadership
experience. Yet here he  is - the CEO, CFO, treasurer, chairman and president of a Bellaire,
Texas biotech - albeit a biotech that has failed to advance a product as far as Phase III in eight
years.


Peter H. Nielsen. Mr. Nielsen is a co-founder of Bio-Path, serving as its Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief
Financial Officer/Treasurer and Chairman of the Board since 2008. Mr. Nielsen has developed a close working
relationship over the last six years with key individuals at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and
its suppliers. Mr. Nielsen has a broad management background in senior management, leading turnarounds of
several large companies.  He also has experience in finance, product development, cost and investment analysis,
manufacturing and planning.  He has also worked with several other biotech companies developing and executing
on strategies for growth and previously served as a director of Synthecon, Inc., a manufacturer of 3D
bioreactors.  Prior to joining Bio-Path, Mr. Nielsen served as Chief Financial Officer of Omni Energy Services Corp.,
a NASDAQ traded energy services company.  Mr. Nielsen was a Lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Nuclear Power
program where he was Director of the Physics Department and was employed at Ford Motor Company in product
development.  He holds engineering and M.B.A. finance degrees from the University of California-Berkeley.


But Mr. Nielsen's biotech experience is so light that the second line of his biography highlights
his friendship with folks at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.


While the bio states he led "turnarounds of several large companies," it mentions Synthecon, a
company that seems to be a Houston Technology Center incubator product with little public
presence since 2010. And it mentions an oil services company, Omni Energy Services Corp.,
where he became CFO in September 1999.


But the oilfield service company priced at  $11 per share in its initial public offering in 1997
soon fell into financial disarray.


Mr. Nielsen's presence there could hardly be related to any "turnaround." According to this
release on a lawsuit, his predecessor claims to have been hired as part of a turn-around team
because "its stock price was depressed and the company had narrowly avoided delisting."


Indeed, Omni reported gross profit worsened from $-2.7 million when he arrived to $-3.6
million, when Mr. Nielsen apparently left as he signed his last amended annual report in April

And, considering how little the 11-person company has advanced in nearly a decade,
executives are generously rewarded. The two top executives haul in around $1 million yearly.


(Source: Company SEC filing)


Now, let's look at an investor that was, in our opinion, unfortunately attracted to BioPath.


*3. Unfortunate Support: Rodman & Renshaw


One reason for investors to be cautious is the April 18, 2016 $5 buy rating from Rodman &
Renshaw. The note apparently helped push up the stock but a price increase is temporary ...
and could suddenly reverse course.

Why The Virtual Reality Biz Likely Won't Become Himax Technologies' (HIMX)Reality


As virtual reality fans geek out over the latest goggles hitting the market, Himax Technologies
(NASDAQ:HIMX) stock is shooting over the moon.


Himax shares have rocketed as much as 45 percent in the last couple of months. This rally
came in lockstep with mass hysteria over the late-March shipping date for the "Oculus Rift"
virtual reality goggles and the preorder date for "Microsoft HoloLens" goggles.


Taiwan-based Himax is a chip company focused on the driver IC used in TV and cell phone
panels. The hype is tied to its second-tier product, a display piece used in virtual reality and
augmented reality (VR and AR) headwear.


Yet when investors understand how Google Glass hype failed Himax previously - and how
many other issues are chewing at the company - this stock could quickly get booted back to
reality.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents the top
eight reasons Himax shares are  so risky:


*1. Rift: Weak, Largely Unpromising Sales Impact


The opportunity presented by Oculus Rift is weak and of little financial significance to Himax.


The Himax product used by Rift is the timing controller. Other Himax components could
conceivably be used but the most prevalent piece by far is the timing controller, a chip that
sells for about $1 apiece.


Some analysts estimate that 12.2 million virtual reality headsets may be shipped in 2016,
according to Fortune.


Let's assume the unlikely scenario that Oculus Rift sold all of those headsets and Himax
provided the timing controller for each one. The best gross revenue would be ~$12 million or a
mere 1.75 percent of 2015 sales. Considering the current 3.64 percent profit margin, then, Rift
would be worth less than half a million in net income.


And some analysts say that scenario is highly optimistic...


(Source: oculus.com)


In fact, primarily thanks to issues explored in "Product Reviews" below, some analysts expect
only around 3.6 million Rift sales in 2016.


Again applying the company's low profit margin, that would make the Himax opportunity
unworthy of a mention at somewhere around $131,000 - yes, $131k - for the entire year.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 110/226


So the case for a reality check goes deeper yet as we consider ...


*2. HoloLens: Too Expensive


The company's opportunity with HoloLens is also limited and very speculative.


Himax provides two LCOS display engines at $25 apiece and an array lens at about $100
apiece for HoloLens. However, Microsoft is uncertain about the mass market and few
applications exist for the headset. So Microsoft is selling only a prohibatively expensive edition
for developers... Indeed, the headsets sell for a whopping $3,000 apiece.


Too rich for most folks. And that price tag is reminiscent of Himax's snake-bitten Glass
experience.


*3. Lesson Learned: Google Glass Gone


Himax remembers all too well the good and bad of Google Glass. The good news for Himax
was that it supplied LCOS microdisplays for Google Glass. The bad news is that Google Glass
has shattered.


In one click of the Google Glass website, investors can quickly grasp that the "smart" eyewear,
as we knew it, is gone:


(Source: Google.com)


That's right. Despite Glass appearances on actors on the red carpet, on models in Vogue
fashion spread and in the imaginations of fans who thought the devices would inexorably
change their lives forever - everything fell away in one horrid swoop.


Glass faced massive criticism and legislative efforts aimed at safety and privacy concerns. But
the final blow came in the form of a viral video of a middle-aged, not-all-that-fit-looking tech
blogger wearing Glass ... as he took a shower.


Gasp! Glass is for geezers??

Odyssey Marine Exploration (OMEX): Seven Reasons This Stock Is A Shipwreck


Odyssey Marine Exploration’s (NASDAQ:OMEX) dumping its shipwreck business is like
rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.


And - like members of the orchestra valiantly playing as the ocean water laps at the hems of
their trousers - Odyssey is playing sweet tunes designed to convince investors that the
inevitable won’t happen.


Odyssey is a Tampa, Florida company that has changed course from shipwreck recovery to
undersea mineral exploration. In light of a messy controversy over the HMS Victory shipwreck,
a former UK official calling the company a "scam," and a consistent record of losses other than
one small net income blip in 2004, the company finally determined that its shipwreck recovery
business was a wreck. So now the company hopes its unproven mineral idea will someday tip
the ship upright.


TheStreetSweeper is not buying it. Investors may find other viewpoints here, as we look at
seven reasons investors should expect more troubles before Odyssey can ever get to work on
a single seabed mineral deposit.


*1. Cash Poor


The company is running out of cash fast. Cash and equivalents had dwindled down to $2.2
million at year's end. And Odyssey burns through more than $17 million per year.


That means Odyssey burns through about $4.3 million in cash each quarter.


At the same time, Odyssey's working capital deficit has hit $21.1 million. And, while revenue
did increase to $5.3 million in 2015, net losses hit $18.2 million and a "going concern" issue
still dogs the company. The snapshot below indicates the ongoing financial disappointments.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 111/226


(Source: Company SEC filing)


*2. Looming Dilution 


With cash burning, financial burdens mounting and just fresh from a Nasdaq delisting threat,
the company recently had to ink a quick, draconian deal to borrow $3 million from Epsilon
Financial at 10 percent interest. 


Odyssey received $1.5 million on March 31 and will receive the remainder on April 30.


While the deal addressed cash burn for one quarter, it actually poses a noteable risk to
existing stockholders.


That's because it gives Epsilon the right to convert every penny outstanding into Odyssey
stock at $5 per share.


Here is the relevant part of the agreement:


"At any time and from time to after Epsilon has advanced the full $3.0 million to OME, Epsilon
has the right to convert all amounts outstanding under the Note into shares of Odyssey
common stock upon 75 days’ notice to OME or upon a merger, consolidation, third party
tender offer, or similar transaction relating to Odyssey at the conversion price of $5.00 per
share..."


A default by Odyssey would halve the conversion price to $2.50. So, if Epsilon converted the
full amount into shares, the lender would receive about 600,000 shares. If Odyssey defaulted,
the lender would get more than 1.2 million shares.


So as the company tries to stay afloat with its mineral dredging attempts, investors could very
soon face diluted shares.


But even more ominous dilution potential looms ahead, as we explain in the "Extensive Stock
Dilution" section below.


*3. Blame Game


Solid companies seldom blame others for their troubles. Not so with Odyssey.


When the company submitted its 2014 annual report, the US Securities and Exchange
Commission responded with questions about its initial business of shipwreck excavation. The
commission asked about recent UK Telegraph reports that the Maritime Heritage Foundation
had only 65,000 pounds and that the HMS Victory site where Odyssey had planned to
excavate is believed not to have a treasure.

Resonant Inc.: Big Troubles Could Send This Bad Boy To Penny Stock Land


Merely 11 months ago, we marched hyperactive Resonant Inc. (NASDAQ CM: RESN) right to
the time-out chair for bad behavior. Since then, Resonant has been tottering along without
making one penny in revenue, just digging a hole deep enough to hold $30 million in debt...
and it's still digging.


Goleta, California-based Resonant, developer of radio frequency filters for mobile devices,
held its initial public offering in May 2014 at $6 per share. That IPO generated $16 million or
just enough to survive a couple of years. But the stock has zigzagged like a youngster hyped
up on sugar, even as the company has failed to commercially launch its filters.


Today, Resonant is in big trouble... probably the worst ever.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, we’ll hop back into Resonant’s
playground to check out the five latest issues spatting the company's fingers.


*1. No Cash: How To Make Payroll?


With no way to generate revenue, Resonant's operating losses rose about $4 million in 2015
to hit almost $10 million.


Now Resonant is hurting for money. In December 2015, its cash and equivalents dropped to
$2.5 million:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


But that was one quarter ago. And the company burns cash at a rate of $2.3 million per
quarter.


So Resonant may have already run out of cash.

*2. Surprise! Going Concern Issues Tucked Into Holiday Filing


It was 6:32 p.m. on Good Friday eve. The markets were closed and most traders were
consumed with thoughts of Easter egg hunts or religious services or simply enjoying a long
weekend break from the stock market.


That’s when Resonant managers chose to file a stunning disclosure.


And Good Friday had dawned before the US Securities and Exchange Commission could file
the company’s annual report containing that "going concern" disclosure tucked away on page
38. The disclosure included a revealing note from auditors to directors and stockholders.
Auditors wrote:


"... the Company has earned no revenue since inception through December 31, 2015 and has incurred
significant losses from operations since inception. In addition, the Company’s operations have been funded
with initial capital contributions, proceeds from the sale of equity securities and debt. The Company's
principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2015 consist of existing cash balances and investments of
$5.5 million. These events and conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern."


Clearly now, auditors doubt the company will survive.


*3. Now What? Potential Stock Dilution Looms


In addition to the going concern notice, the company filing warned:


“We have determined that additional capital from the sale of equity securities or the
incurrence of indebtedness and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating
revenues will be required for us to continue operations through the second quarter of 2016 and
beyond.”


As any self-respecting 10-year-old might say, “Duh! They’ve gotta sell stock or get a loan.
Because you can’t squeeze pennies out of an empty piggy bank.”


So, considering the rapid cash burn rate, only a white knight or a $9 million-plus stock offering
could slap a Band-Aid on Resonant at this point and keep it breathing for one more year.

US Concrete: Ready To Crack Under Pressure


Investing in US Concrete is like investing in a pair of concrete shoes for your investment
portfolio.


The stock, (NASDAQ CM: USCR), is set to go down, down, down, in our view. And US
Concrete investors could soon find their portfolios swimming with the fishes.


US Concrete sells ready-mixed concrete principally to customers in its home state of Texas,
plus northern California and New York/New Jersey.


The company hasn't responded to our request for comment but investors may find other
viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, let's look at an executive summary followed by details on why stock in this
concrete company is ready to crack under massive pressure.


*Executive Summary
 *Ridiculous valuation.


 *Insider selling of company stock.
 *Quarterly revenue slip.


 *Nothing proprietary.
 *Sensitive to economic stagnation, a housing bubble or just an economic hiccup.


 *Very low cash, suggesting the need for a raise such as a stock offering.
 *Excessive executive compensation equal to nearly one-quarter of the company's entire net


income.


*Numbers Would Scare Even Crazy Joe


TheStreetSweeper has seen more than our share of crazy ratios over the years. But one key
Concrete ratio absolutely floored us.


US Concrete's trailing Price-to-Earnings ratio hit an incredible 544!  That means people are
paying 22 times more for US Concrete than the average 24 P/E seen within the industry
overall.


Why? A P/E of 544 is just as outlandish as the nearly $1 billion market valuation placed on a
company that is not curing cancer or selling the fountain of youth ... rather a company that
sells cement. And it sells cement primarily in just three regions of the country.


That bizarre ratio hasn't gone unnoticed by the folks that investors look to for guidance ...
insiders.

Why You Could Go Broke Buying Broke Out


When two UK twenty-something buddies - who sold "streetware" and "head ware," in 2014
and greeted customers with "Yo Peeps" -  swing a stock deal with a Belize company owned by
a guy in China, what can possibly go wrong?


Plenty.


First of all, that unlikely team has actually formed a publicly traded company called Broke Out,
Inc. (OTC Pink: BRKO) and sold stock in the company. Now people are actually buying the
highly risky over-the-counter "pink sheet" stock.


Unfortunate investors have no idea that this is a company that has gone $81,559 into the hole
as it holds only $3,762 in cash.


Yet, levitated by a heavy promotional campaign over the last couple of days, Broke Out is now
teetering on a market valuation of not $1 million ... Not $10 million ... But $100 million.


Incredibly, Broke Out soared on news that it has acquired an app called "Secret Menu for
Starbucks™." 


The company is trying to tie itself to the popular international coffee store. But there's every
reason not to buy into this stock.


Broke Out has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment and there's really
nothing beyond blatant promotions offering the bull case to this company which just may be
the biggest financial disaster we've ever covered.


But let's look at the top reasons Broke Out will likely leave investors broke:


*1. Background; Switch-eroo


Broke Out started as a way for a young UK man to express himself and perhaps make some
extra bucks.


Here's Broke Out founder Jason Draper modeling one of his line of eight pieces of clothing, as
well as a snippet from his thoughts penned on the Broke Out website:





(Source: brokeout.co.uk)


But Broke Out was, well, broke.


So, on January 27 this year, Broke Out issued 4.6 million shares to a Belize company
controlled by Chinese resident Chan Set Kuan; Jason Draper also sold 15 million shares
privately to Mr. Kuan. Mr. Draper and the other officer backed away, leaving Chan Set Kuan as
the sole executive and director.


The stock offer wrapped up assets of Megapps Ventures, a company that had existed three
months and spent the entire time not building apps but buying them.


Overnight, the struggling fashion company became a struggling app company operating out of
a home office in Berlin, Germany.


Should something go wrong - and it will - this China-Germany combination will make it very
difficult for investors to find recourse, as filings spell out on page 11.


*2. Absurd Acquisition


So how did a little two-man operation selling eight items of street wear become a two-man app
company wrongly valued in the multi-millions?

KEYW Holding Corp.: Five Key Challenges Pose Significant Downside Risk


An embarrassing acquisition and declining gross margins are among the issues poised to kill
the stock price of KEYW Holding Corp. (KEYW).


Indeed, while a rally is temporarily holding up the share price for the holding company,
massive challenges have set up prime conditions for a dive. These hazards are tied to the
company's failed attempt to jump from a declining government contract business into the
cyber security business and back out again.


The Hanover, Maryland-based company hasn't responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for
comment but investors may find various viewpoints here. Meanwhile, we present the top five
reasons KEYW faces big troubles.


*1. KEYW Must Dump Embarrassing Loser


The company had plodded along as a boring government contractor until it captured investors'
attention by forming the Hexis Cyber Solutions product line and beginning to remake itself into
a cyber security company.


Investors bought into KEYW's expectations for Hexis. They were under the impression that the
new business was brimming with hope, based on the company's revenue projections:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


But Hexis has fallen far short of expectations. The segment generated $7 million revenue less
than anticipated in 2014. And the expected $40 million contribution to revenue in 2015 turned
out to be under $14 million:


(Sources: Company SEC filings and earnings call)


So KEYW wants to put this major misstep behind it by trying to sell all or part of Hexis. In the
last earnings call, CEO Bill Weber said:


"KEYW will not continue to invest in the unconstrained way it has in the past. As a public
company, we have the utmost obligation to shareholder value. And as such, we initiated a
process a few months ago for a strategic alternatives for the Hexis business. Those
alternatives include an investment or sale of our Commercial Cyber Solutions business in one
or more transactions to buyers."


But dumping Hexis means that KEYW could get dumped, too.


*2. Bye-Bye Hexis; Bye-Bye Investor


We've asked KEYW if managers are worried that selling all or part of the glamorous cyber
security segment could give investors a reason to sell the stock. We haven't heard back. But
let's consider why we believe looming stock selling is a clear and present risk to current
investors.


The situation revolves around KEYW's activities as a risky roll-up - a company that chases
after revenue by conducting acquisition after acquisition. All too often, these deals produce far
less revenue than hyped and consume far more money and management attention than
expected. We've frequently warned investors about roll-ups such as Revolution Lighting
(RVLT, $4.08 on publication day, $0.77 now) and InterCloud Systems (ICLD, $3.15 then, $0.54
now).


In the case of KEYW, the company wanted the Hexis acquisition to propel the company into a
sector showing some life - cyber security.


So the company's entry into the cyber security field in 2012 must have seemed perfect for a
fund called PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK).


PureFunds bought in. KEYW became a tiny 1.24 percent of PureFunds' portfolio (here). For
perspective, here's a snapshot of PureFunds' top holdings in cyber security leaders.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story

Indeed, the KEYW holding is small - the fund's third smallest holding. Yet the 1.8 million
shares of KEYW means the fund holds a meaningful 4.5 percent of outstanding shares.


But PureFund now has an issue. The former glamour fund is now a bummer carrying homely,
if not downright ugly, returns.


(Source: Bloomberg)


With both the impending divestiture of Hexis and PureFunds' quarterly portfolio rebalancing
right around the corner, KEYW is likely in trouble. PureFunds may well sell all or at least a
massive amount of KEYW stock once KEYW boots its cyber security business.


That poses a screaming threat of stock dilution for today's investors.

Broke Out II: Unbelievable Hype, Crushing Drop Ahead


Broke Out (OTC-Pink: BRKO) has been floating on hot air from a well-oiled hype machine
over the last few days but the inevitable is just ahead: This stock is ready to deflate.


TheStreetSweeper sent a detailed email to securities regulators late last week about the
actions surrounding Broke Out.  The company appears to be in the "pump" stage of what in
our opinion will ultimately become a particularly egregious pump-and-dump tactic. We believe
this tactic is poised to leave many Broke Out investors flat broke.


We've seen many pump-and-dump tactics over the years but seldom have we seen anything
quite this appalling.


The apparel retailer with just eight different articles of clothing last year made a desperate
pivot to offering apps. But loses have continued to rocket, leaving the company with only
$3,762 in cash at the end of the year.


Yet nearly 100 times that amount - $315,000 to be precise - has gone into a four-day Broke
Out promotional campaign. And who is the sugar daddy who paid promoters big bucks in
recent days to hype Broke Out?


The group shelling out over $300,000 to promote a company with about $3,700 in cash is a
two-man fund called Bullseye Asset Management. We can assure you we'll be keeping our
eye on this incredibly generous Denver hedge fund.

Primarily thanks to those promotions, the stock exploded by more than 146 percent, handing
Broke Out an unbelievable market valuation of $105 million.





(Source: hotstocked.com)


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment. Meanwhile,
let's look more closely at the ridiculous hype and other issues investors must consider with this
stock:


*1. Most Promoted Stock


Broke Out now holds the dubious distinction of becoming the most heavily promoted stock in
March, according to Hotstocked. That's right.


Subscribers were treated to 25 emails by a group of newsletters that form Elite Penny Stock.
Elite is the same outfit that promoted CLOW ($0.07), EURI ($0.09) and AREN ($0.01), all of
which started at pennies, briefly exploded, then collapsed when the promotions stopped.


The Broke Out promotions over the last few days included:


"BRKO's moment to shine is right now and if you don't buy shares of it today you may look back in
regret once its shares are trading at around 10 dollars," crooned SmartStockChoices in a widely
distributed March 9 email.


The fine print at the bottom of the email explains, "We do not publish research or due diligence and
only publish favorable promotional information about the Profiled Companies because we are paid to
do so."


And ... this:


"BRKO is the stock you want to buy now!" shouted BestAmericanStocks.


Noting its $70,000 payment from Bullseye, the March 7 email warned investors: "The
Newsletter is a one-sided advertisement that only provides positive information... we do buy and sell
during campaigns. We even sell shares of Profiled issuers during the dissimenation of the Newsletter
while the Newsletter recommends that you buy the same shares we intend to sell.


"Individuals should assume that all information contained in the Newsletter is not trustworthy, accurate
or complete ..."


And this from Finest Penny Stocks:


"Here is why this company could go up from $3 to $20."


The email is signed by Keith Richie, Editor. But the fine print says he's a fake!


"Any first, middle, and/or last name referring to our "editor," ... or any other title or name is
purely fictitious."


Kind of rips away that warm and fuzzy feeling, doesn't it?

Second Sight Medical Products: Eye-Opening Risks Ahead


Two eye-opening announcements over the last couple of days jumped shares of Second Sight
Medical Products (EYES) above $6 per share.


The first boost came after the company announced its prosthetic eye will be featured in an
episode of HBO’s “Vice” titled “Beating Blindness.”


Though its implantable visual prosthetic isn’t specifically mentioned in the show airing Feb. 26,
EYES product appears to be visible in a preview.


The second boost came when EYES announced five-year data from its Argus II clinical trial

EYES will of course happily accept all promotional effects.


But those 15 minutes of fame won’t change the very real issues that will drop this stock.


Here are TheStreetSweeper’s top four reasons investors should keep eyes wide open on
EYES:


*Dual Promotions Signal Potentially Dilutive Stock Offering


As the promotional efforts mentioned above attest, EYES has stayed unusually busy lately
churning out press releases.


They’ve produced eight press releases since Nov. 24, with four of those released this month.
The snapshot below highlights the company's latest promos:


(Source: Company website)


While the "Vice" episode may be serendipitous, the vigorous promotions are not. Instead, we
believe there's a method to their madness. The company needs to push out a potentially
dilutive stock offering. Read on to understand all the signals pointing that direction.

Celator Pharmaceuticals: Eight Key Risks Threaten To Chop This Stock


Celator Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CPXX) has finished cherry-picking and left the ladder
against the tree. Now stock promoters have climbed up and begun tossing investors the pits.


The small New Jersey company with negative earnings and no revenue has been focusing on
a drug targeting a rare cancer called acute myeloid leukemia.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, here are the top eight reasons
TheStreetSweeper expects Celator stock will quickly wither and die.


*1. Failed Phase II Trial Endpoint


Celator actually failed to meet a key endpoint in its phase II trial of VYXEOS (formerly CPX-
351). That’s right.


In the May 2014 edition of Blood Journal, researchers wrote that they studied the response
rate (complete remission + incomplete remission), plus survival.


The drug overall produced response rates of 66.7% versus 51.2%, as shown here.


So there wasn’t a lot of difference between what happened to patients who took the Celator
drug compared to those in the control group. But the survival measurement is key.
Researchers wrote …


Differences in survival “were not statistically significant.”


Data analysis of the entire group showed the dreaded crossed lines:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 118/226


(Source: Study published in Blood Journal)


In the charts above, the red line indicates the Celator drug. The blue line indicates the
standard of care, chemo. When those lines cross, results of the two therapies are no different.


As an OncLive author wrote: "The study did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically
significant OS improvement at 1-year posttreatment. However, there was a statistically
significant OS benefit with CPX-351 among the protocol-defined EPI poor-risk subset (HR =
0.55; P = .02). A higher response rate (39.3% vs 27.6%), EFS improvement (HR = 0.63; P =
.08), and lower 60-day mortality rate (16.1% vs 24.1%) were also observed with CPX-351 in
this poor-risk subgroup."


Then something unusual happened. Researchers examined data for a small group within the
original group of 126 patients. This cherry-picking produced a special subgroup of patients
with secondary acute myeloid leukemia. That subgroup produced better looking results.


Those lines did not cross. Of course, the Food and Drug Administration would have likely
preferred a wider distance between the lines, which would indicate the drug was likely
working. But at least the lines did not cross:


Indeed, researchers found response rates compared more favorably: 57.6% versus 31.6%.
They also found slower cytopenia recovery and more infections but thankfully infection-related
deaths didn’t increase.


Even in light of the more favorable data in the smaller group, the response rate isn't the
measurement that matters most. Oncology doctors consider overall survival the ultimate
measurement of cancer drugs. But, as we've said, researchers found Celator failed the overall
survival measurement in phase II.


So the company had what it wanted in the smaller sampling.


What’s so bad about that? Well, read on …


*2. What’s Wrong With Cherry-Picking?


This cherry-picking is contentious enough that both the FDA and EU have weighed in and set
up guidelines. The FDA says subgroup “analyses should be interpreted cautiously.”


Authors reported the fascinating observation that:


“…no drug has so far been approved or not-approved either in the US or in the EU on the
basis of subgroup analysis.”

Globant S.A.: Beautiful Words Won't Halt The Looming, Ugly Decline


Globant S.A. is living proof of the old adage, "Beauty is only skin deep." Just scratch the
surface of this Luxembourg company and you'll find enough Quasimodo-esque characteristics

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 119/226


to send this stock running into an ugly, rapid decline.


Indeed, Globant's SEC filings are unique as it conjures up beautiful - and vague - visions of
the business: "Globant  (NYSE: GLOB)is a digitally native technology services company. We
dream and build digital journeys that matter to millions of users. We are the place where
engineering, design, and innovation meet scale."


Plow through all that dreamy stuff and investors find a company with a bank of computer
programmers and design support people primarily working out of the main office in Argentina.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, diligent investors can see growing risks
are tarnishing Globant's glowing digital dream, including:


*1. Limited Recurring Revenue


Though it has attracted customers such as Coca-Cola and LAN Airlines, Globant must operate
within an atmosphere of transient customers and short-term contracts.


What happens is that Globant wins these one-time projects but once they're done, they're
done. The customer says "Thanks," pays up and takes the project in-house to save on costs.
Globant clearly concedes that risk to revenue on page 21 as it describes "a decision by that
client to move work in-house."


Alternatively, Globant says the customer may decide to move work "to one or several of our
competitors."


Company filings describe the risky short-term nature of most contracts:


"...most of our client contracts are limited to short-term, discrete projects without any
commitment to a specific volume of business or future work, and the volume of work
performed for a specific client is likely to vary from year to year, especially since we are
generally not our clients’ exclusive technology services provider. A major client in one
year may not provide the same level of revenues for us in any subsequent year."


Globant has been handling some Google projects, including the recent hardware related
project trial called Project Ara. This trial has no time table attached and provides a pretty good
example of how companies use Globant on a project basis.


In a recent note to BWS Financial investors, Hamed Khorsand beautifully explained Google's
project-based use of Globant ... and the associated risk:


"The project based approach leads us to believe that the Street is not valuing the business risk
concisely and leaves investors vulnerable to the downside especially when the competitive
landscape is changing.


"It also does not mean GLOB would be able to sustain 20 percent or 30 percent growth in an
industry that grows at less than 10 percent a year," wrote Mr. Khorsand.


So Globant's services, in our opinion, cannot generate the kind of recurring revenue that is so
crucial to a viable future.


*2. Reinventing The Wheel


So the short-term nature of the technology services business is forcing Globant to find new
customer after new customer.


Unfortunately, this constant grinding away each day to reinvent the wheel is beginning to show
on the company.


Globant says so itself.

TransEnterix: Nine Top Reasons TRXC Is An Operational Disaster


Today's TransEnterix Inc. (NYSE: TRXC) came into being through the most reckless of actions
- by casually plunking down $94 million for a tiny company offering virtually no sales, no
prospects, nothing really beyond multi-millions in losses.


In finalizing the reverse merger, the experimental surgical robot company magnified the
absurd acquisition of SafeStitch with this jaw-dropper:


"As previously discussed, the projections for SafeStitch show that a profit is never expected to be
attained."


The company hasn't responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment but investors
may find other viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, here are TheStreetSweeper's top eight reasons investors might want to consider
running away, screaming from this operational disaster:

We're still examining TransEnterix' unbelievable payment of 12,350,000 shares at $7.60 per
share for a company so far removed from the surgical robotic field.


SafeStitch focused on small, disposable devices targeting hernias, obesity and
gastroesophageal issues. And, in the days before the September 2013 reverse merger, it
became clear that SafeStitch's financial health was no more attractive than the surgical stapler
that generated miserly sales:





(Source: Company SEC filings)


SafeStitch recorded $35,000 in sales in 2012 and zero the year before. Total net loss had
risen to $29.5 million. Not surprisingly, the financial statement included the warning below.


"It is uncertain as to the length of time the Company can sustain continued operations without the availability of
additional funds. This uncertainty raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
"


Auditors were dismissed soon afterward. TransEnterix continues to struggle with its own going
concern issue.


And as if the merger price didn't seem crazy enough, the company placed $10,000 under
intangible assets and $93.8 million under goodwill - thereby keeping almost every penny of the
SafeStitch acquisition out of the income statement.


The US Securities and Exchange Commission apparently thought this was, well, odd. Absurd
enough to be included among 41 TransEnterix questions posed by the Commission.


The company responded that it conducted the reverse merger primarily because it was
desperate to raise capital. Another frantic action came months later, in March 2014, when the
company conducted a reverse stock split. That split was necessary to jump the stock price
enough to meet NASDAQ listing requirements.


So, how carefully has TransEnterix handled operations since then? Let's see ...


* 2. Absurd Numbers


TransEnterix' operational functioning continues to be abysmal. The company has not made a
penny since inception and analysts are expecting a 12 cent per share loss in the coming
quarter.


Even though analysts should be getting used to the ongoing miserable negative earnings,
TransEnterix last quarter delivered a negative 34 percent surprise. That's right. Instead of an
earnings loss of just 4 to 12 cents, the company suffered an earnings loss of 16 cents per
share.  As the chart indicates, investors can expect more pain in the future:

hot air today) interesting accounting methods, dropping cash flow, looming payments and
insider selling – and is just about to deflate.


TheStreetSweeper presents the top 11 reasons we expect SLP stock will soon slip its mooring
and head down, down, down.


*1. Goodwill Hunting


First, let’s focus on the accounting surrounding the $7 million acquisition of Cognigen in
September 2014.


SLP's initial payment of $5.2 million consisted of $2.08 million in cash and over 491,000
shares ultimately valued at $3.277 million. (SLP will need to pay the remaining $720,000 cash
and 170,014 issued shares in July.)


This transaction would normally prompt a pretty big hit in the income statement.


But the company did something that’s perfectly legal yet quite surprising.


The company allocated almost $4.8 million of the acquisition cost to "goodwill." So goodwill –
the premium SLP paid over Cognigen’s book value – accounted for over 90 percent of the
initial payment. By allocating it this way, SLP kept the vast majority of the cost off the income
statement.





And goodwill appears as an asset:


(Source: Company SEC filings)


Of the total purchase price, then, a whopping 66 percent was placed in goodwill. Somewhere
around 30 percent is more common.


If we looked at goodwill in relation to assets, we find SLP recorded $8.4 million in Cognigen
assets. Goodwill came in at 57 percent of that … So the ratio of goodwill to assets also comes
in much higher than with many firms.





TheStreetSweeper asked SLP's CFO John Kneisel to do a little goodwill hunting with us.


Our question: Why allocate so much to goodwill?

The VirnetX Holding (VHC) Rocket Ship: Failure To Launch


Shares of VirnetX Holding (VHC) have ridden an unfortunate rocket to the moon based on a
court decision that Apple infringed on VirnetX’s patents. But we believe the share price will
crater as soon as the market understands the massive risks:


1. The Trend: No Settling


Patent trolling firms used to nab larger companies by the tail. But now these companies are
beginning to fight - and win - these lawsuits filed by patent trolls. Case in point is Better Mouse
Company's patent suit against SteelSeries.


Better Mouse apparently attained the title of “patent troll” because the company began buying
up patents and launching patent lawsuits shortly after it was formed, according to Forbes.
Before long, Better Mouse's chewing paid off as companies eager to push aside the pesky
little troll coughed up $1.2 million just to settle matters.


But jurors jerked away Better Mouse's cheese on Jan. 14. They rejected the company's patent
infringement claims against SteelSeries.


So will Apple really meekly hand VirnetX $625 million? That's unimaginable.


In fact ...


2. Many Years Before VirnetX Pockets A Dime – If Ever


Apple immediately filed for a mistrial after last week’s verdict of infringement on four VirnetX
patents in products such as FaceTime and VPN services. And VirnetX’s attorney said he
thinks it could take several more years to resolve the case that began six years ago, not near
VirnetX's Nevada headquarters but in Tyler, Texas, "the patent litigation capital of America."


Meanwhile, VirnetX knows all too well that after spending countless hours and dollars
litigating, cases sometimes go the wrong way. The company filed a $258 million patent lawsuit
against Cisco in 2010 with what may have seemed to VirnetX astonishing results. In a stinging
2013 verdict, jurors determined Cisco had not infringed on VirnetX patents. VirnetX investors
raced to the exits and shares plunged 28 percent.


     3. Microsoft Outcome Disappointing


Even when a lawsuit ends up being settled to VirnetX's favor, the results aren't as beneficial as
we would hope. VirnetX won a March 2010 $200 million settlement against Microsoft. Yet, the
lead counsel whacked away $20 million plus expenses; taxes took $34 million; and partner
Science Application International Corp. $59.24 million, with more obligated.


Ultimately, the Microsoft windfall turned out to be a gentle breeze resulting in VirnetX receiving
only about $63 million... Though the settlement did manage to push the negative earnings into
a positive 91 cents, the company ended up with just 31 percent of the settlement.

Amedica Corporation: More Painful Drama To Come


Amedica Corporation’s (AMDA) reverse stock split is the latest and perhaps the most
desperate measure taken thus far. But more painful drama will follow.


On the verge of getting delisted from the NASDAQ, so it pulled as desperate 1-for-15 reverse
stock split on Jan. 25 with the stock trading at just 11 cents per share.


The split technically propped up the stock into compliance for now, much like another
desperate stock TheStreetSweeper just warned investors about … Authentidate Holding Corp.
(ADAT,$5.04/share on publication date, $2.94 now). But Amedica’s desperation is even more
palatable with its higher cash burn, nearly as severe accumulated losses and more frequent
recent promotions.  


Just last November, professional stock promoters were paid to conduct a two-day promotional
blitz of Amedica stock. Paid stock promotions have always provided one of the surest,
quickest tipoffs that a company is desperate … and likely doomed to take a trip to penny stock
land.


Real companies with real products and real promise simply don’t need the hype….unlike
Amedica.


Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, let's proceed with the jaw-dropping risks
aching to pummel this stock.


*Bought And Paid For Hype


In Amedica’s case, a third party paid cash through a wire transfer to hype the company for a
two-day campaign.

The more desperate the company, the greater the hype and tens of thousands in hype-money
is just the opening act. The greater danger to investors is that stock promoters can buy huge
quantities of potentially worthless stock and pitch it to their subscribers. Those subscribers’
purchases rocket the stock price, triggering the promoters to dump the stock … and the stock
price dives.


Investors can see details of the Amedica hype-fest below:

Excalibur Resources Ltd. (EXCFF, no revenue, $3,620 cash, $-142,700 operating cash flow).


The promoter discloses: “PennyStockLocks.com and its officers, partners, affiliates, employees, etc. are
compensated for covering and profiling these companies in cash and/or stock and as such there will be a
conflict of interest and our profiles and other dealings are not arms length transactions. The party that pays
us usually has a position in the stock they will sell at anytime without notice. Their selling and our selling of
shares could have a negative impact on the price of the stock, resulting in losses to you.”


Even humor can’t deflect the risk: “We will not be held liable for any investment decisions you make
when that is the case. (Hey Folks, these are high risk stocks).”

Turtle Beach: Apparent Default, More Undesirable Ingredients For This Turtle Soup


Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR), the moldy headset company TheStreetSweeper wrote
about less than four months ago, continues to turn into turtle soup. Our update includes the
latest unfortunate ingredient - an apparent loan default - atop a heaping serving of
undesirables:


*Debt hole deepens.


  The company burned through $11 million in just the first nine months of 2015. Cash now
rests at about $7.2 million.


   All totaled, debt is $84.2 million.


   Available cash has dropped by over 50%.





 *Loan default threat.


  *Turtle Beach appears to be in default of its Bank of America loan, due to horrid EBITDA.
Lenders renegotiated the loan terms late last year, as the 8K shows here.


  *Company must raise at least $10 million by Jan. 29, 2016.


  *Company faces strict EBITDA targets, requirements which indicate an additional business
decline …

Authentidate Holding: Delisting, Massive Challenges Wreck This Runaway Rollercoaster





The Authentidate Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: ADAT) rollercoaster has hurled investors along a
teeth-jarring ride made all the more excruciating now that trading is expected to be shifted
from the NASDAQ to the lowly OTCQB ...tomorrow!


The company announced today, Jan. 28,  that ADAT has lost its NASDAQ listing.


Indeed, this crucial event has been in the works for years and was forewarned by numerous
issues, including:


*Primary customer lost.


*62% drop in revenue to $398,000.


*Losses totaling almost $10 million in 2015 alone.


*Two stock promotion blitzes.


*Two reverse stock splits.


*Just one US patent and one patent pending.


And the warnings simply got worse:


*Auditors' substantial doubt that ADAT will continue as a going concern.


*Cash position drops to a fraction of $1 million.


*An SEC cease-and-desist order against ADAT’s biggest shareholder, Lazarus Management,
an investment company desperate enough to actually write about ADAT in a Seeking Alpha
article.


Yet, even despite today's confirmation that ADAT has lost its NASDAQ listing, ADAT wants
investors to sit tight in their coaster seats.


TheStreetSweeper has not gotten a response to a request for comment from the web-based
software applications company but investors may find other viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, let’s look at the grimy undercarriage of this rollercoaster.


*Cease-and-Desist Order Involves ADAT And Four Other Stock Issuers


ADAT is seriously obligated to two pairs of brothers. The SEC sanctioned entity is linked to the
first pair.


Lazarus Management owns a 29 percent stake in ADAT and its related entity holds a recently
extended $500,000 ADAT note with a searing 20 percent interest rate attached. Lazarus is
managed by the brother of company director Todd Borus, who owns ~192,000 shares of stock
and cheap options.


The US Securities and Exchange Commission saw fit in September 2014 to fine Lazarus
Management $60,000 and order it to cease and desist securities violations. A portion of the
litigation document is below. The full document is here.

The order specifically names violations revolving around five issuers, with ADAT listed first.


In 2013, Lazarus Management blatantly promoted ADAT through a management interview
published on Seeking Alpha.


*Stock Promotion Blitz


Six months before the SEC order, a promotional campaign focusing on ADAT launched. This
desperate first effort by professional stock promoters barely moved the stock price above the
$1 per share range.


But a promotional blitz launched Aug. 26, 2015 succeeded in one respect, sending the stock
up a blistering 18 percent:

This promotion came exactly one day after Authentidate announced plans to merge with the
small private testing lab Aeon Clinical Labs. The double-digit stock rise helped push shares …


To 34 cents per share.

LightPath Technologies: Heavy Promotions, Lame Fundamentals, R&D Budget Slash Add Up
To Potential Dilution


LightPath Technologies (NASDAQCM: LPTH) promoters and an infinitesimal glimmer of
income have nearly quadrupled the stock from its 52-week low of 82 cents per share.


Now, the maker and assembler of molded optics, light-focusing components and glass lenses
is overbought and extremely risky.


TheStreetSweeper didn't get a response to our request for comment but investors may find
other viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, let's throw some light on LightPath before this stock can burn investors.


*Heavily pushed by professional stock promoters


Stock promoters orchestrated a blitz promoting LightPath some 34 times, ultimately priming
the stock most recently on June 2, 2015, June 3, 2015 and June 9, 2015. And in June 2013,
another company pushed LightPath, along with CLSN (~$7.50 then, ~$1.40 now) and SONS
(~$16 then, ~$5.90 now).

American Superconductor: Relentless Storms Break Up This Wind Turbine Company's Turn-
Around Effort


The chief executive of American Superconductor Corp. (NASDAQ: AMSC) nailed it when he
told a reporter that China wanted “to kill the company.”


In fact, shares collapsed under China’s pressure, plunging the market valuation by 87 percent
virtually overnight in 2011. And despite misunderstood hype that has breathed a quiver of life
back into AMSC in the past few weeks, the stock appears poised for another hammering.


In a 60 Minutes segment broadcast Sunday night, CEO Daniel McGahn said AMSC lost over
$1 billion in valuation when China looted its wind turbine technology in a high-stakes game of
industrial espionage.


Back in 2007, AMSC agreed to supply the computer brains for wind turbines made by small,
China-based Sinovel. Two years later, AMSC announced a $100 million follow-on contract with
Sinovel. In 2010, the year it hyped a partnership expansion, AMSC broke its string of losses
and knocked down $16 million in net income, thanks to the Chinese company.


*Business Disappears Overnight


But in March 2011, those celebrated contracts fell apart. Sinovel, a 70 percent contributor to
AMSC’s revenue, suddenly refused contracted deliveries of the company’s turbine controls.


Oddly, it seemed Sinovel turbines were spinning when they should have been shut down
during testing. That’s when the company began investigating. It seemed an employee had
secretly copied AMSC's intellectual property, including source code. Six months later,
Superconductor filed suit claiming it had been left in a lurch and its IP stolen.


Lured by promise of a $1.7 million contract and other perks, a Superconductor insider agreed
to steal the technology for Sinovel, according to a criminal indictment.


In June 2013, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Sinovel, two former
executives and a former AMSC employee with theft of trade secrets.

*The Kicker


Incredibly, the FBI discovered stolen technology right under AMSC’s nose.


FBI agents found a Sinovel wind turbine - complete with AMSC’s heisted technology - just 40
miles away from company headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts.


The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority had purchased the turbine from Sinovel for
$4.7 million  - in federal stimulus money.


Undaunted, Sinovel punched back with a $190 million counterclaim in China over issues
including failure to meet contract standards.


So the civil proceedings between AMSC and Sinovel rest in the court in Beijing, another
complicating factor for the American company.


“It’s a very complicating factor, I think evidenced by the fact it’s been four years and we’ve
haven’t seen much movement at all,” Brion Tanous, AMSC investor relations, said in a phone
interview with TheStreetSweeper.


Of course, AMSC's four civil lawsuits remain unresolved - one initial trial date has been set for
December - and the ultimate  expenses remain unknown.


One thing is certain, though. In one fell swoop, AMSC lost its best customer … and control of
its technology.


TheStreetSweeper believes there’s a nagging danger that other companies may be willing to
take a turn at kicking AMSC in the chops, too …

SolarWindow Technologies: After 18 Years, Still No Product, No Revenue, No Rainbow
Ahead


The Wizard of Oz could not have conjured up a company less likely to deliver a financial
rainbow to investors than SolarWindow Technologies (OTC: WNDW).


The Columbia, Maryland company has three full-time employees, $29 million in losses, has
never made a penny in sales, depends upon backing by a promoter formerly sanctioned by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The whole mess is overseen by a chief executive
whose 2014 compensation package is bigger than the company's entire R&D budget.


And, as the wicked Witch of the West warned, this “little party’s just beginning.”


The company has not responded to a request for comment but investors may find other
viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, let’s look at the reasons TheStreetSweeper believes this party will end badly, no
matter how many times the company clicks its ruby slippers together.


*After 18 Years, Still No Product


The public vehicle has been in existence for two decades – since May 1998.


In those 18 years, the company has changed names three times, changed focus a couple of
times but never commercialized a single product.


At inception, the company called “Octillion” rolled up two asset-free companies into
subsidiaries. The first idea was to develop a spray window coating designed to convert
sunlight into electricity. The second idea surrounded pursuit of technology to regenerate optic
nerves.


But without a product, the company had no way to make money. So operations depended on
selling stock and getting loans from its now-past president, Harmel S. Rayat. Investors will
learn more about Mr. Rayat's background below.

Digging Into NovaGold Resources: Big Risks, Massive Costs Ahead


There may be “gold in them there hills” but investors better not count on NovaGold Resources
(NYSE: NG) digging it out.


NovaGold owns 50% of two exploration properties, consisting of the Donlin Gold project in
Alaska and Galore Creek in Canada.


Expected expenses are massive. The prospects are iffy. The risks are enormous. And the
excavation route goes straight through investors’ wallets.


The company hasn’t responded to our request for comment but investors may find various
viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, here are the chief reasons TheStreetSweeper believes this blinding stock rally –
up 11 percent in three months - is merely a flash in the pan:


*Donlin Gold project:


No operations. No revenue. The project awaits government approval for over 100 permits. The
open-pit mining operations aren’t expected to start up until 2020.


          *Proven and potential gold reserves: While NovaGold reports reserves of 7.7 proven
metric tons and probable reserves of 497, no precise data exists showing how much gold may
be there or whether any is recoverable, and company expectations are not statements of fact,
as stated here and here.  Additionally, acid mine drainage, possibly thousands of pounds of
mercury releases, cyanide effects and increased river barge traffic top the project’s
environmental risks.


         *Cost to design & build Donlin Gold: $6.679 billion.       


         *NovaGold’s portion of costs:  $3.34 billion.


*Galore Creek project:


No gold recovered despite numerous attempts since 2003. NovaGold and its partner ran out of
money for the copper-gold-silver project and suspended construction in 2007 when they
discovered construction would cost around $5 billion.


          *Current status: In February 2011, the former president declared, “Galore Creek is one
of the most significant copper-gold projects in the world.” Eight months later, NovaGold began
trying to sell its 50% stake. In 2012, the company said it expected a sale by the end of the
year. Still waiting.


*Unfortunate promotional activity:


No obvious recent professional promotions; but the stock trader prosecuted for stock
manipulation at age 15 -  Jonathan Lebed - successfully hyped NovaGold through his Lebed
Biz in 2010 to $11.62 per share. Red Chip also promoted the company in the same time
frame.

Universal Display: Patent Cliff, Analyst Thumbs Down, And A Baseless Rumor


The essence – the thing that makes Universal Display what investors have come to believe it
is – falls apart in 2017.


Universal Display trades under the symbol “OLED” and depends upon key patents for the
technology that the company sells. This technology pertains to essentially an organic light-
emission dust used in screens for smart phones or television sets.


But here’s the key problem: The company’s fundamental patent is scheduled to expire in
2017.


And other patents appear to face an expiration date of 2018 and later.


Here is the pertinent information from Universal’s 1998 SEC filing: “In December 1997, the first
patent, titled "Transparent Contacts for Organic Light Emitters", was issued to Princeton
University by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office …  In January and February, 1998, two
additional patents relating to Multicolor Organic Light Emitting Devices were issued to
Princeton University. Princeton University and USC have filed approximately 30 additional
patent applications relating to the OLED technology in the United States, and have filed for
intellectual property protection internationally.”


Patents typically expire 20 years after application:


When these patents hit the patent cliff starting in December 2017, the technology falls into the
free-for-all known as the public domain.


Princeton technology licensing experts have not gotten back to TheStreetSweeper with a
comment.


Likewise, the company has not responded to our request for comment but investors may find
other viewpoints here.

for release today to Chinese online gamers just a couple of weeks after the Colorado Springs shootings – and just
eight days after the San Bernardino massacre.


Though the latest massacres didn’t happen in China, the government is known for cracking down on societal ills.


Indeed, the Chinese government can – and has – shut down websites deemed socially destabilizing. In fact, China’s
Ministry of Culture outlawed godfather and mafia games in 2009 because of the potential negative impact on young
people.


So the Ministry may look even more critically at shooter games like Cross Fire2 in the aftermath of the recent
massacres. See a sample of the graphics below.


(Source: crossfire.z8games.com)


Yet the stock has somehow managed to stay aloft.


Shares rose after The9 announced it will operate Smilegate Entertainment’s CrossFire 2 sequel in China for five
years at a stunning cost of about $500 million -$50 million upfront, $450 million in milestone payments plus more in
royalty payments.


Even if investors push aside the unconscionable timing, significant questions still loom.


How will the Shanghai, China-based company - with a nearly $21 million net loss - pay for something so expensive
and uncertain?

Paycom: Nervously Patching Leaks?


Iconic investor Warren Buffett once said, "Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking
boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted
to patching leaks."


Indeed, Paycom Software (PAYC) investors may be getting tired of patching leaks in this
company that provides payroll software-as-a-service for small and medium sized businesses.


One leak will become a veritable torrent in a matter of weeks, when current investors' shares
could face major dilution. That's because of the Dec. 28 release of about 18 million shares that
Paycom insiders have had locked up for months.


That's right. Millions of Paycom shares will become eligible to hit the public auction block,
according to the prospectus supplement.


See more information here and below:


“The date of this prospectus supplement is November 12, 2015.”


“After this offering, our officers, directors and selling stockholders will be subject to lock-up
agreements with the underwriter or us that restrict their ability to sell shares of common stock
until 46 days after the date of this prospectus supplement. After the lock-up agreements
expire, an additional 18,441,518 shares of common stock (or 17,766,518 shares of common
stock if the underwriter exercises its overallotment option in full) will be eligible for sale in the
public market…”


The selling shareholders may be seen here:


Clever insiders can now more easily back out of their investment in Paycom – a company they
probably realize is poised to feel the effects of a fading revenue driver - the Affordable Care

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 132/226


In fact, a major investor, Welch, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, deserves our golden plastic
wheelbarrow prize for dumping stock more rapidly than any we’ve ever before witnessed.


The private equity firm and entities have unloaded some 5 million shares. In one day.


On Nov. 24, the firm sold almost every single share of Paycom stock:

Zagg: Glass Screen Protector Company Shattering Under Pressure


Zagg (ZAGG)shares have rallied near 52-week highs, all the more perfectly poised to shatter amid numerous
lawsuits, market deterioration, an ongoing SEC investigation, an executive resignation, insider selling and a recent
$100 million shelf filing which could bring excessive dilution.


Formerly known as the fumbling Chinese academic regalia manufacturer Amerasia Khan Enterprises, this Salt Lake
City, Utah company makes screen protectors for smartphones. The company has turned in one of its worst net
income reports since 2011:


(Source: SEC filings)


Though Zagg is currently expected to increase earnings about 13 percent to 68 cents next year, TheStreetSweeper
believes it will not hit that figure. In our view, the market share will continue to fracture as customers turn to the vast
number of cheaper alternatives.


Zagg has not responded to our request for comment but investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile,
here’s a look at the red flags indicating Zagg is poised to disappoint:


*Major Dilution Looming With Recent $100 Million Shelf, Insider Selling


Now that Zagg is trading high, insiders can’t wait to get out. The company just filed a $100 million shelf registration
that could bring extreme dilution to current shareholders, available here. At the same time, seven insiders have
been set up to sell their shares, further increasing that dilution potential.


Here are the lucky seven insiders who may now dump their shares:


(Source: SEC filings)


In October, CEO Randall Hales jumped out with the most recent insider selling with the disposition of 43,000-plus
shares, shown here.


Both of these selling activities are fairly good indications that Zagg has approached peak price.

magicJack VocalTec: The Disappearing Business Trick


Any smidgen of magic left in magicJack VocalTec (CALL) is vanishing quicker than street magician David Blaine can
make a new quarter disappear.


Now the former star of annoying, late-night TV commercials only wishes it could make its core business model
reappear.


MagicJack offers a device that is plugged into the computer to allow consumers to make local or international phone
calls for about $40 per year, plus $20 for service. Its second offering is VoIP or voice over Internet protocol for small
or medium enterprises, an area dominated by the AT&Ts and Verizons of the world.


Though magicJack enjoyed an early out advantage in 2007, the benefits have fallen apart like a busted magic trick.


After an earlier reasonably-upbeat article, PC Magazine revisited magicJack in 2011 and rated it “fair,” adding:
“(W)hen magicJack debuted, nothing else like it existed. That isn't the case anymore. In the face of competition,
magicJack's poor interface, pushy attempts to up-sell you, on-screen advertisements for its own product, and
general lack of support make it hard to recommend now.”


MagicJack faces numerous other issues that make the stock impossible to recommend now, including:


*Horrid consumer reviews


*Perilous declines in users, activations and app users

Voltari Corporation Alert: Buyer Beware


Ridiculous: $VLTC enters real estate biz, stock up over 100%. Growth? NO! With only $2.5m cash, need raise.
BUYER BEWARE! We’re short


Here’s what the company states: In addition to our entry into the real estate investment business as described
above, the Company intends to explore additional strategic opportunities from time to time, which may include
opportunities with respect to its intellectual property, investments in various industries or acquisitions.


 August 2015, Voltari Corporation (“we", “us”, “Voltari” or the “Company”) committed to and began implementing a
transformation plan pursuant to which, among other things, we exited our mobile marketing and advertising
business and entered into the business of acquiring, financing and leasing commercial real estate properties. The
Company intends to lease such properties pursuant to so-called “double net” or “triple net” leases.


Investors must watch out with this stock. Voltari needs cash and will likely take advantage of this run-up to issue
stock. Dilution appears imminent. Don’t get stuck holding de-valued shares.

Titan Machinery: Titanic Downside Risk


:


As it struggles to steer around revenue and cash flow icebergs, Titan Machinery (TITN) is beginning to look less like
a league of strong mythical Greek gods … and more like the “unsinkable" Titanic.


North Dakota-based Titan operates a dealership network focusing on agriculture and construction equipment. The
stock has bounced around like a seasick landlubber, with shares rallying from ~$10 per share in early September to
the recent $12.33-$14.40.


That stock rally is despite Titan turning in two quarters of the lowest sales numbers the company has seen in three
years.


Indeed, second quarter revenue of $334 million represented a 25.9% year-over-year plunge - the worst revenue
drop within the entire industry, according to Thomson Reuters.


The mighty decline – which hit all four revenue segments - resulted in earnings of zero. That $0.00 in earnings caps
off eight straight periods of negative earnings.


Here are highlights of the choppy waters Titan is trying to navigate:


*Misstated losses, but no amended 10-Q


*Related-party connections worth $100 million-plus


*Industry’s worst revenue drop; recent low-to-negative earnings


*Industry’s worst inventory buildup


*Struggles to pay off floor plan debt; lay-offs and store closings likely to continue


*Historical habit of revising guidance; then missing numbers significantly


*Low analyst ratings


*Among the industry’s worst performers


The company has not responded to a request for comment but investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile,
let’s look at why this is a good time for Titan investors to start looking for lifeboats.


* Losses Misstated: Titan Calls 50% Understatement “Immaterial”


Among all Titan’s reported losses, two instances stand out above all the rest.


First, in April 2014, Titan managers quietly disclosed that the company had released a quarterly report containing
drastically inflated assets and understated losses.

Astute investors had to dig up that news - not in a standard amended quarterly report – but in a note near the
bottom of a financial report issued five months later in September.


The net loss turned out to be far worse than the stated $4.2 million. The loss was actually $6.5 million.

Badger Meter: Digging Into Major Downside Risk


After three down quarters in a row, Badger Meter (BMI) will have to dig like mad to suppress another big profit
decline next quarter.


The water meter company reported year-over-year earnings dropped off a cliff – a teeth-rattling 18.6 percent. Clearly
dismayed company leaders called financial results “disappointing” four times during the last conference call.


No wonder. The chart below shows Badger’s year-over-year earnings performance.


(Source: Badger SEC filings)


But even more disappointments loom ahead. In fact, normally optimistic analysts expect a 14 percent decline in
2015 earnings versus last year.


The company has not responded to a request for comment, but investors may find other viewpoints here.


Before we focus on several highlights, let's look at some additional downside risks for the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-
based water meter and flow-measuring technology company:


*Shares trade at a ridiculous 14.6 times EBITDA and 33 times Earnings Per Share.


*Stock currently trades near analysts’ top price target.


*Normally optimistic analyst firms downgrade Badger or rank it a “hold.”


*Insiders are dumping company stock.


*A history of earnings misses.


*Badger blames Itron for its recent revenue miss.


*A cash position of only $4 million.


*Risks are exacerbated by razor-thin margins, fierce competition, economic softness, continuing supply and
inventory problems, bad weather and poor flow-measuring technology demand for oil rigs during the oil patch
malaise.


* More Disappointments Poised To Spill Over Into Next Quarter

MagneGas: A Zombie Fest Bursting With Hype, Horrifying Financials, Downside Risk


MagneGas Corp. (MNGA) activities and outlandish hype remind us of those lurching, snarling, misunderstood
zombies populating the horror film “Night of the Living Dead.”


At the center of the Tarpon Springs, Florida company is founder, Ruggero Santilli. The controversial nuclear
physicist has been called everything from brilliant to a fringe scientist.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 135/226


In a manuscript, “HHO gas” was presented as a new form of matter by Mr. Santilli shortly before he started the
company.


A Brown University professor wrote in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy of Mr. Santilli’s “many serious
misinterpretations and, misunderstandings of the “data” presented in this (Mr. Santilli’s) manuscript.” Mr. Santilli
responded to the professor’s criticism here and built a reputation as a scrappy scientist who used the legal system
to attempt to force detractors to take his ideas seriously.


MagneGas is built on Mr. Santilli’s machine designed to gasify pig manure or other liquid waste into fuel.


This “Magnegas” results when the waste is passed through an electric arc and heated. The alternative fuel is
primarily used in welding.


But the technology is unproven on a large-scale industrial basis and might not work well on that basis – according to
regulatory filings - or produce a fuel able to compete against standard acetylene.


MagneGas has only been able to claim revenue of ~$584,000 last quarter after acquiring Florida welding gas
distributor, Equipment Sales and Services, in 2014. Today, the company announced the subsidiary “Lands Largest
Single Customer in Company History.” But it is just so much more hype. The touted $400,000 per year customer
“has indicated they will be purchasing all of their industrial gases and welding products throughout the year from
E.S.S.I and their initial orders have been placed and delivered.”


There are only two months left in this year. Running the math, then, that order for the entire year would amount to
just about $66,000 revenue.


And there’s no guarantee the order will be renewed.


While investors may find other viewpoints here, TheStreetSweeper presents in an ongoing investigation the first of
six reasons MagneGas hands out downside risk like candy.


*Bought and Paid For Hype


MagneGas is so overvalued and its prospects so low, wise investors would normally run as if zombies really were
after them.


So the company buys investors’ love.


In the last few years, MagneGas stock has been hyped by stock promoters an astounding 52 times at a cost to
MagneGas and a third party of over $260,000.


Indeed, our analysis of stockpromoters.com data reveals eye-popping details.


*MagneGas itself paid stock promoters roughly $59,000 and 650,000 shares of its own stock.


Yet those payments are just the beginning.


*MagneGas friend ACS Financial Consulting Group pitched in hundreds of thousands of dollars for these
stock promoting sites to hype MagneGas through newsletters and other means.

MeetMe: Seven Great Reasons To Stay Away From This Meat Market Stock


The meat cleaver is poised to come down on MeetMe (MEET), likely chopping those shares very sharply.


MeetMe is a cringe-worthy dating app that recently agreed to fork over $200,000 to settle litigation with the San
Francisco city attorney’s office. The office alleged the way MeetMe allowed users to meet new people through their
mobile devices violated California law for 13-to-17-year-old users.  


While the city accepted MeetMe’s revisions, we think MeetMe promotes a “meat market” mentality and should be
closed to anyone under 18.


We’ve found many other reasons to avoid this company.


Below are TheStreetSweeper’s top seven reasons we believe this stock is excruciatingly risky.


*FLAT TRAFFIC


MeetMe’s mobile downloads are not growing, according to App Annie data, suggesting the user base is likewise
probably not growing. So it’s ridiculous to pay a high multiple for this stock.

Anavex Life Sciences: Biotech Pump Goes On ... II


The Anavex Life Sciences (OTC: AVXLD) chief executive told TheStreetSweeper that he has no idea who was so
kind as to pay $200,000 to a penny stock newsletter to hype the company stock.


“Absolutely not by us. That’s crazy!” CEO Christopher Missling told TheStreetSweeper in an Oct. 13 telephone
interview. “We only do very ethical work. Let me tell you this. We really don’t want any association with anything like
that. It’s absolutely inappropriate.”


The Stockpalooza email was reproduced in a Hotstocked newsletter here, and sounds like a paid promotion:


Importantly, Stockpalooza removed all doubt about whether the hype was bought and paid for. The newsletter said
in its disclaimer that it expects $200,000 for promoting AVXLD:


“StockPalooza.com.com  expect to be compensated Two Hundred Thousand Dollars Cash via Bank Wire
Transfer by a third party for a 1 Day Marketing Program regarding AVXLD. This compensation/expected
compensation, expired or not, is a major conflict of interest in our ability to be unbiased. Therefore, this
newsletter should be read as a commercial advertisement only. The third party, company, or their affiliates
may wish to liquidate shares, which has the potential to hurt share prices.”

Boingo Wireless: Why This Stock Will Soon Swoon


Boingo Wireless (NasdaqGS: WIFI) is all dressed up for the ball, jitterbugging in white loafers while the
competition coolly waltzes away with the belle of the ball.


Try as it might, the Wi-Fi hot spot provider has been slightly out of step since its founding in 2001.


Indeed, Boingo has racked up ~$63 million in losses and faces these investment risks:


Shelf Registration: Boingo recently cleared the way so it can sell millions of shares, posing looming
dilution of current stockholders’ shares.


Insider Selling: Executives are selling company stock like mad. The chief executive and chief financial
officer alone have unloaded about 150,000 shares in the last four months.


Accelerating Risk: Free mobile Wi-Fi offered by airports, coffee shops, hotels and telecom companies
pose an ever-growing risk to Boingo’s business.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 138/226


Nothing Special: Boingo depends on open-source software and unlicensed spectrum to provide Wi-Fi –
both available to everyone.  


Terrible Finances: Shareholders’ 2014 losses of $0.55 per share are expected to worsen to $0.77 per
share this year.


Institutional Disdain: Top institutional firms ignore Boingo, as even insignificant institutions are selling out
their Boingo positions.


Cushy Compensation: Despite investors’ horrible returns, Boingo executives hit multi-million dollar
jackpots.


Excessive Complaints: Boingo suffers from extensive customer complaints reported on consumer
complaints website


Boingo declined TheStreetSweeper’s request for comment, but investors may find other viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, let’s look at the reasons we’re convinced overvalued Boingo is poised to dance away current
stockholders’ hard-earned money.


*Angry: Customers


Many upset customers have logged complaints about Boingo on consumer complaints website
complaintsboard.com, here. A few highlights:


** “When it comes to Boingo, it's way way worse than "accidental" charging.
 I paid for their one-day pass, out of desperation since I usually don't give out my credit card details online, one year


ago.
 ONE YEAR AGO. Since then, I have clicked "Cancel" and closed down the GoBoingo! pop-up whenever it shows


up. Since there was no setting for disabling the pop-ups (fishy fishy!), and since I had no intention of using the
service ever again save for emergency, I went into my computer settings and made sure Boingo wouldn't
automatically start up.


 So you can imagine my surprise when, going over my account bills for the past three months - this would be about
10 months after originally using the Boingo "service" - I see four separate charges from Boingo Wireless.”


** “I have just discovered that I have been charged $9.95 on my credit card for 3 YEARS.
 ONCE I used Boingo in an airport in Houston, TX. I had to think very hard to even remember this. I have been


charged every month since that time.
 When I called Boingo to discuss, they acted as if this was the first time they'd ever heard of such a ridiculous thing


happening.”


**”Boingo is deceptive and makes fraudulent charges. Boingo deliberately conceals aspects of the "As you Go"
$7.95 24-hr. access charge for web connection at U.S. hotspots.”


** “After signing up to use boingo wireless for one day at an airport, I continued to incur charges of $7.95 on my
credit card bill. They claimed that I continued to use their service, which was false. This appears to be a common
complaint. No one should use boingo wireless. Hopefully boingo.com will be held accountable.”


**” … they did the same thing to me and refused to refund the extra charges. I live in FL, but "Bogus" Boingo
Wireless is based in South Santa Monica, California. I wrote the attorney general there and asked him to investigate
Boingo business practices. I've also filed a complaint with the FL state attorney and the CA Better Business Bureau.
That's not all, I am on a mission. I bought www.ihateboingo.com I am currently working on the website. Boingo
needs to be exposed, they are conducting the same business practices that Blockbuster had attempted and looked
where it took Blockbuster.”


*Killer: Competition


Boingo’s business primarily revolves around “DAS.” DAS or Distributed Antenna System is an antenna
network installed in convention centers, office buildings, etc. to access the wireless network at peak times.
Competing venue-based options include small cells.


AT&T and Verizon are the DAS giants. AT&T annually installs hundreds of its systems in stadiums such as
the Dallas Cowboys stadium, campuses, airports and other venues across the country.


Verizon used its own DAS recently at the Daytona International Speedway, as well as various football
stadiums.                             


T-Mobile and Sprint are other rivals, along with competitors such as Proximity, ExteNet Systems, Accu-
Tech, SeamlessCellular and many more.


Here’s how CEO David Hagan described the way Boingo works in the DAS segment – a lengthy process he
said is usually a 12-month cycle:

Anavex Life Sciences: Biotech Pump Goes On And On And ...


If we didn’t know better, we’d think Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (OTC: AVXL) enthusiasts had ripped off a “Saturday

Picking up three patents and one patent application, Anavex conducted a reverse merger in 2007 and switched from
a digital-to-photo-print business targeting corner stores into a biotech company targeting Alzheimer’s.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 139/226


Today, the company has no commercial product, hasn’t earned a penny since inception and does “not anticipate
earning any revenues” until it can convince some other company to come aboard.


The company has lost $61.8 million  over about 12 years of operations and is living on the ragged edge of survival.


And don’t let the stock price fool you. Though it sports an astonishing $230 million-plus market valuation, this stock
is worth a fraction of today’s price.


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for comment but investors may find other
viewpoints here.  We’re just scratching the surface with this first look at a batch of highly promotional biotech stocks
poised to dive.


*”We’re Here to Pump (clap) You Up!”


The 25 top biotech giants such as Johnson & Johnson and Novartis and Eli Lilly do not rely on hype to push their
stock.


But Anavex has everyone from the CEO to pump sites to message board fans clapping their hands and cheering on
Anavex with, “We’re here to pump you up!”


The chief executive officer, Christopher Missling, had this to say in a recent interview:


“Anavex has now a team of big pharma and biotech experts, doubled the number of Scientific Advisors which is
mostly Medical Doctors, raised a company's record amount of $10M in one funding transaction, advanced after that
quickly into Phase 2a, licensed additional promising compounds into the company. Anavex is significantly more
advanced than in 2007.”


Yet Anavex filings say it operates with just “four (4) full-time employees, and we retain several independent
contractors on an as-needed basis.” (Don’t miss the section below titled “Executive Compensation” to put employee
compensation into perspective.)


Other concerning promotional efforts include:


The CEO sounds highly promotional - talking about reversing the disease and stopping the disease today (despite
having its experimental drug just barely in the human testing stage involving dose toleration of just 32 subjects) - in
this one video of four Anavex videos on Wide World of Stocks. WWOS is a site Timothy Sykes connected with Viral
Genetics and one that also discloses that its employees sometimes receive investments in companies it
features.This series just begged for a dose of the brash objectivity of SNL character Roseanne Roseannadanna.

Torchlight Energy Resources: Six Reasons This Former Pole-Dancing Company Is Running
Out Of Energy


Hang onto your G-string. Torchlight Energy Resources (NasdaqCM: TRCH) – formerly a pole dancing studio –
appears positioned to shimmy down to reality.


The oil and gas company danced onto the public stage as Pole Perfect Studios (OTC Bulletin Board: PPFT), a
business built around “a fireman’s pole often found in gentleman’s clubs” ala the one-time fitness fad reminiscent of
strip clubs. Pole’s founders invested less than a penny per share to start the biz and raised a few thousand dollars in
2008 by selling shares for 7 cents apiece.


But Pole teetered. So in 2010, the pole dancing company pulled off its fake eyelashes, changed its name and ticker
symbol, and emerged as an oil and gas company.


Now operating out of a small office leased from a Plano, Texas travel agency (shown here), Torchlight today claims
five projects in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. Much like its predecessor, Torchlight exists as an un-productive,
money-chewing entity that hands investors a minus 360 percent return on equity.


In fact, financial despair has forced Torchlight to offer an extremely liberal interpretation of its oil reserves in an
apparent attempt to attract investors.


Torchlight was unavailable for comment by deadline, but investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, here
are the top six reasons TheStreetSweeper would never own this stock.


1.*Outlandish Oil Reserve Estimates


Torchlight’s estimates of the value of its oil reserves – oil still in the ground – are completely out of touch with reality.


Why? The company bases estimates on $91.48 oil prices! That’s right.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story

Clearsign Combustion: Ready To Implode On Losses, Hype, Looming Dilution and More


Clearsign Combustion (CLIR) shares have virtually exploded but research suggests the company itself may be on
the brink of implosion.


TheStreetSweeper offers this quick hit report highlighting the top risks poised to burn up the stock value.


The Seattle, Washington-based company is working on technology to improve emission performance and efficiency
of combustion systems. The technologies are called Duplex and Electrodynamic Combustion Control or ECC.


But Clearsign has forgotten investment guru Warren Buffett’s advice: “Rule Number 1: Never lose money. Rule
Number 2: Never forget Rule Number 1.” The company consistently loses money, offers zero-revenue, no significant
sales since inception in 2008, no analyst interest, little real institutional interest, an uncertain future and depends on
penny stock promotions to keep the stock fired up. A stock offering may be needed before long just to fuel company
operations.


While other viewpoints are available here, we present details of the chief investment risks:


*Looming Dilution - Clearsign will likely conduct another stock offering within six to 12 months.


The company has always depended on stock offerings to stay in business. The finance-reviving stock offerings are
shown in filings, here, and include:


A. April and May 2012 – Initial public offering of 3.45 million shares at $4 per share. Cash to Clearsign: $11.6 million.
B. March 2014 – Direct offering of 812,500 shares at $8 per share. Cash to Clearsign: $5.8 million.
C. February 2015 – Public offering of 3 million shares at $5.85 per share. Cash to Clearsign: $16.3 million.
The chart, below, graphically shows how dilutive stock offerings keep Clearsign on its feet. The share count
continues to rise while the cash burns.

Fenix Parts: This Automobile Parts Seller Could Be Headed To The Junkyard


Fenix Parts (Nasdaq: FENX) resembles the Johnny Cash hit describing the Cadillac put together "One Piece at a
Time," from parts he and an auto-worker buddy gradually steal from the assembly line and eventually cobble into a
"Psycho-Billy" heap.


It took the determined workers about 24 years to create a weird Caddy at a cost estimated to exceed the price of a
showroom model. But Fenix took only four months to roll-up a dozen companies into a money-losing jalopy arguably
worth a fraction of its ~$190-million market valuation.


Westchester, Illinois-based Fenix operates like a legal chop shop. The company buys broken-down heaps from
automobile auctions, pulls them apart and then sells the parts and scrap metal. It operates more like a junkyard at
several locations, where the company buys junkers from individuals. Customers range from body shops and car
repair shops to "shade tree mechanics" and hobbyists.


Fenix has not responded to our request for comment, but investors may read various viewpoints here. Meanwhile,
TheStreetSweeper presents the executive summary highlighting Fenix investment risks:


1. Losing Money - Fenix is running in the red. It's almost out of cash.


2. Risky Rollup - The company IPO'd four months ago as a rollup and has already acquired a dozen companies.
These rapid acquisitions result in distracted management and accelerated costs associated with buying, integrating
and running very different businesses.


3. Directors Flee; Management Overwhelmed - The chief executive apparently lacks experience in the auto parts
business and has installed equally inexperienced former co-workers as directors. Those two directors recently
departed under rather odd circumstances.


4. Messy Financials - Fenix is also challenged by messy financials, apparent inability to file financial reports on
time and a Nasdaq deficiency notice. All may well suppress or kill investor interest in the stock.


5. Dilution Looming - Fenix will likely soon sell stock - ultimately diluting current shareholders' stock. In fact, the
Securities and Exchange Commission has already approved the paperwork to sell more stock at any time.


6. Pending Insider Selling - Insiders will be able to sell currently locked up stock beginning Nov. 10.


*Risky Rollup - Running In The Red; Running Out Of Cash


A risky rollup, Fenix acquired its first 11 corporate entities for ~$93 million cash plus about 3 million shares of stock
just days after the company's initial public offering in May 2015. The CEO had prepared for that moment with a
series of private stock offerings that cost insiders 10 cents apiece for some stock and $10,000 to $13,000 apiece for
other stock, which ultimately underwent a 2,000-for-1 stock split.


Fenix had to lower its hoped-for $10 offer price to $8 per share and increase the share count to 12 million shares.
Fenix was forced to borrow millions to pay the full $93 million acquisition expense plus a little left over for operating
costs.


Fenix soon rapped its own fingers with a rusty wrench once again. It seems the acquired companies began
reporting unexpectedly lower revenues - dinged and dented by lower scrap prices.

Flotek Industries: An Oil Patch And Cosmetic Counter Mess Poised To Drop


Flotek Industries (FTK) strives to make money in oddly different areas – the oil field and the cosmetics counter. And
it is failing miserably.


The company just reported an astounding $12.5 million quarterly loss or negative 23 cents per share.


This odd business got an even odder reaction to its earnings report. The stock price rocketed!


That’s right. But we’ve drilled into Flotek filings and other publicly available information only to find a dry hole… and
a broken perfume bottle.


TheStreetSweeper presents a quick hit zeroing in on the top reasons we think FTK stock should plummet. However,
investors may read bullish viewpoints here and financial details on pages 3-7 here.


*What Is Flotek?


First, Houston-based Flotek sells products primarily to oil and gas companies. The flagship “Complex nano-Fluid,” or
CnF, is a chemical added to water in hydraulic fracturing operations used to make it easier to pull oil and gas from
below ground. Energy Chemistry Technologies accounted for $11.9 million income last quarter. Rig counts and oil
prices keep this division on a short, cruel chain.


Second, Flotek buys citrus oil to process and sell to the oil, flavor and fragrances industries. Consumer and
Industrial Chemistry accounted for $2.7 million income.


Third, the company builds downhole drilling equipment. Drilling Technologies accounted for a $21 million loss last
quarter.


Fourth, Flotek assembles equipment such as rod pump components and valves. This Production division dinged
Flotek with a $1.6 million loss last quarter.


 *Why Did The Stock Price Recently Rocket?

Energy Focus: Massive Risks Coming Into Focus


TheStreetSweeper alerts investors that the latest risk associated with Energy Focus Inc. (EFOI) stands to hammer
the stock price.


EFOI stock went ballistic today – jumping by $2 in early morning trading to settle in the $16-$17 range. The rise
coincided with Roth Capital Partners’ snap decision to raise EFOI’s price target 7 bucks to $23 per share.


While bulls may argue EFOI’s business and margin improvement sparked the analyst’s write-up, we believe
something less obvious may be going on here.


Here’s why.


EFOI has in its back pocket $25 million worth of registered stock that it can freely sell to the public at any time.


With its eye on a potential stock offering and seeing the stock price trading around record levels in recent days, we
believe Roth saw an opportunity to help push EFOI higher.


Indeed Roth analysts had provided an update the day after EFOI released positive earnings on Aug. 5. So it seems
odd that Roth would provide a new release two weeks later with unchanged sales and EPS estimates. No real new
information. Just a new head-scratcher price target.


Now that the already over-valued stock has rocketed even higher, Roth figures it’s sitting pretty in the cat-bird seat.

GTT Communications: Seven Reasons To Avoid This Las Vegas-Style Bet


The market has grabbed GTT Communications (NYSE: GTT) under one arm and a fake Elvis under the other and
headed for Las Vegas.


Managers have undoubtedly watched in shock as the market slapped a nearly $800 million value on the
telecommunications services provider. Never mind that GTT is losing money and its forward price to earnings is an
unbelievable 37 to 1. The market still insists on betting on GTT,  humming “Viva Las Vegas” all the way.


But trouble lies ahead. Really, there’s so much trouble all around that a half-dozen happy Elvis impersonators
couldn’t even beat the affects of investing in GTT at its current price of ~$22.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 142/226


Investors may read other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, here are the top seven reasons GTT is due for a haircut and
sideburn trim:


*1. From Shell To Risky Roll-up


Many of GTT’s financial issues can be traced back to its very foundation.


The company, formerly called “Mercator Partner Acquisition Corporation,” was simply a shell in 2005, looking for a
business to run.


After it settled on providing telecommunications and Internet services, GTT began acquiring companies. It created
45 subsidiaries as it rolled up about half-a-dozen companies into its portfolio - including a division of MegaPath just
last February that cost a whopping $144 million plus $7.5 million in GTT stock.


This undoubtedly difficult-to-manage assemblage of small companies has found itself scrambling to compete for a
sliver of cloud-based business against established companies such as AT&T, Xo Holdings, Verizon and Microsoft.


TheStreetSweeper has seen many roll-up companies and despises most of them. We have warned investors about
the fluctuations and risks associated with roll-ups such as Tangoe (TNGO $19.55 then, now ~$7), Swisher Hygiene
(SWSH $8 then, ~$1 now) and Revolution Lighting (RVLT $4 then, now ~$1.).


So now we're inducting GTT into our Rock'n Roll-up Hall of Fame. But, first, let's look at the financial issues that
GTT can thank for their help in making this unfortunate honor possible.


*2.Neck-Deep In Debt


GTT depends on a mountain of debt to keep the doors open – and feed its appetite for acquisitions.


(Source: SEC filing 1; 2, 3)


The company is now shouldering $215.6 million in debt. Cash has dwindled to just $19.4 million. So the company's
debt is over 10 times the cash in its piggy bank.


Now GTT is loaded with debt and losing buckets of cash.


*3. Net Losses Become Substantial


Indeed, GTT hasn't seen six months' worth of operations in the black since ... yikes! ... 2010.


The chart below, based on SEC filings, shows how GTT has consistently disappointed investors:


So GTT’s losses dramatically deepened beginning in 2013.


In fact, SEC filings indicate the company just suffered the second worst 6-month loss since the company’s inception
a decade ago.


*4.Historical Earnings Misses


Last quarter, management credited GTT sales improvement primarily to acquisitions. But investors actually lost 32
cents per share – an enormous miss since Wall Street expected a loss of only 6 cents.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 143/226


Billionaire investor Warren Buffett once said, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.”


We argue that Vonage Holding Corp. (NYSE:VG) is not delivering on the value as beautifully described by the
Oracle of Omaha.


TheStreetSweeper offers this quick hit report on Vonage, provider of a VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) service
that uses a customer’s Internet connection to make and receive phone calls via phones or devices. The company’s
market cap is $1.37 billion and its price-to-earnings ratio is a stunning 62. Other viewpoints are available here.


Why the stock price jumped


Vonage shares jumped Monday, when Canaccord Genuity initiated coverage on Vonage with a “buy” and a $7.50
price target. The report boosted the already highflying shares about 4 percent to ~$6.49.


Suddenly, Vonage found its stock price in this situation:


Vonage shares are currently beating the consensus price target of $6.31 per share, according to marketbeat.com
data!


So Vonage could be in a nearly perfect position to plummet at this very moment.


Why we expect the stock to plunge


*Ridiculous insider selling


They say you can judge a man by the way he wears his hat or the shoes he kicks off at the end of the day. We don’t
know about that, but we do know that you can usually tell a lot about a company by who is dumping its stock.


In Vonage’s case, company officers and directors are selling their company stock like crazy.

Trupanion: We're Sending This Pet Insurance Company To The Dog House


Stock in Trupanion (NYSE: TRUP) has transformed in recent weeks from a bad, bad dog into the Lassie of the pet
insurance world.


But hold onto your leashes. This Seattle, Washington-based company has been quietly growing enormous pit-bull
fangs and looks ready to turn on shareholders.


Our executive summary highlights why TheStreetSweeper is bearish on this stock and believes TRUP will ultimately
bite those loyal shareholders.


* Hello, 2021: Unraveling TRUP’s numbers reveals up to 23 quarters to wait for the possibility of any meaningful
profit.


*TRUP’s insurance product: Negative reviews dog the company.


*Dog-gone bad 16-17 percent margins: Why we shouldn’t be surprised.


*TRUP's “recast” numbers: Can't fix customers' value-to-cost ratio.


*States’ insurance commissioners: Let’s jump TRUP.


*Sell, sell!: Insider unloads company stock.


*Company headquarters: Just embarrassing.


While the company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for comment, investors may read bullish
viewpoints here.


* TRUP’s pet enrollment numbers revelation: Wait ~23 quarters for scale up, any possibility of meaningful
profit.


TRUP went public in June 2014 and has suffered significant net losses since inception 16 years ago. But
shareholders will sometimes hang in there with a company awhile as long as they can imagine light at the end of a
rather short tunnel.


When we ran the numbers, however, we were shocked at how long TRUP investors apparently will have to wait.


Cash flow break-even should happen by mid-2016, CEO Darryl Rawlings said during the May earnings call. But he
indicated anything resembling meaningful profitability will come only when TRUP can scale enough to reach
650,000 to 750,000 enrolled pets:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 144/226


“We manage our business base on cash flow and we are on track to achieve cash flow break even by the middle of
next year. Once we achieve operational scale of 650,000 to 750,000 enrolled pets our intention is to have our fixed
expense scale as a percentage of revenue and our discretionary margin should continue to expand.”


So the obvious questions are: How many more pets will TRUP need to enroll in its insurance program before they
hit the target?


And how long will that take?


TRUP currently reports 241,808 subscription pets enrolled. If the company can stay on track at around 12,500 net
additions per quarter (which, if even possible, will likely mean gobbling up millions more in marketing), it should take
TRUP somewhere around 14 quarters to 23 quarters to hit the target.


Yipes ...That’s about three to six years.


That means TRUP should reach the target sometime between the years 2018 and 2021!


At that rate, TRUP is expecting investors to be phenomenally patient.


Particularly if we factor in the stock performance (down ~30%, depicted by the blue line) versus the Dow (up ~2%),
NASDAQ (up 5%) and S&P 500 (up~14%) over the past year, as shown below.

Tucows: Why Its New Internet Business Will Hand Investors A Cow Patty


You’ve almost gotta love Tucows (NASDAQ: TCX) for its humor, as demonstrated by the company reportedly taking
a real cow to a conference, plus its depiction of two cows in its logo:


But the negatives inherent in Tucows’ business plan utterly outweigh its funny personality.


The stock for this Toronto, Canada-based domain name registrar and wireless service provider has been running
wild and crazy the past two months. Indeed, Tucows jumped over the moon at $32 on July 21 and then began
declining somewhat. The stock is now on the brink of turning around and trampling investors before they can jump
out of its path.


Before Tucows hooks another one, check out our executive summary briefly describing the top reasons we think
Tucows’ stock price is ready to drop.


*Executive Summary


*Troubled Trio – The company reports two operating segments - domain services, consisting of domain name
registration, and network access services, consisting of both retail mobile phones/services and Internet service over
fiber networks. Tucows faces growing challenges in all areas.


*Faltering Fiber – The stock rallied on announcements of Tucows’ entry into the Internet business. But Tucows lacks
the multi-millions to build a fiber network. And our research shows the Ting fiber business won’t produce meaningful
revenue now … and probably not ever.


*Yelling “Sell!” – Insiders have been hitting the sell button on Tucows’ stock.


*Crumbling Core - Tucows’ core Internet domain name business is flat and poised for further decline. The business
has become vastly more competitive and commoditized, so customers buy principally on price.

checks out the scenery behind her. Slowing, slowing, slowing. Stumble…


In the wacky world of mobile game making, Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU) is in a constant mad dash for gamers’
hearts and fingertips.


But Glu’s top three games “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,” “Deer Hunter 2014,” and “Racing Rivals” are now
declining, according to App Annie data.


And that decline is just the first warning flag amid a mile-long parade of red flags viciously snapping at Glu.


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for comment, but investors may find other
viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, here’s a quick executive summary:

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 145/226


*Executive Summary


*Hopped up on hype. Glu Mobile’s stock is up on hoped-for hits and the company’s enthusiastic guidance.


*Declining stars. Glu’s three top games drive the bulk of past and current revenues. But they are in a slow decline.


*Recent games disappoint. Games launched so far this year are turning in disappointing numbers. And games
currently in soft launch are getting surprisingly poor rankings, too.


*Key insider selling. A director who was an original investor also manages a fund that is now dumping the majority
of its shares in Glu.


*Crazy P/E: Glu’s price-to-forward earnings is an outlandish 74, while the P/E is about 20 for two competitors and
the industry as a whole.


*Should guide lower: Overall, we expect Glu leaders will need to lower sales guidance for the third quarter and
potentially the entire year.


Indeed, we believe Glu shares are poised to decline faster than a broken stiletto can drop any dashing diva. Here’s
why:


*Current Stars Decline

La Jolla Pharmaceutical: Lost Opportunity, Insider Questions Should Chop Valuation By
Well Over Half


*Executive Summary


*The stock primarily owes its price to enthusiasm over insider buying. However, that insider’s large block trade
orders sparked a market manipulation investigation that led to his broker being sanctioned, temporarily losing his
license and paying tens of thousands in fines.


*Though La Jolla had to shelve its most promising drug candidate, analysts haven’t revised price targets to reflect
the massive decline in market opportunity.


*With La Jolla’s history of missed, terrible earnings, even bullish analysts anticipate horrible earnings into the
foreseeable future.


*With little real institutional interest, anyway, more shares recently have been sold out than new positions added.


*Our calculations suggest the remaining market opportunity for La Jolla is a fraction of analysts’ projections.

Kornit Digital Update: Top Competitor Acquisition Signals KRNT's Vast Risks, Overvaluation


TheStreetSweeper alerts investors on the very latest negative event subsequent to our Monday report on the
massive risks facing Kornit Digital (KRNT) - an event that justifies a stock price decline to below $5 per share.


A top competitor, Italy-based Reggiani has been acquired by Electronics for Imaging for about $84.2 million, plus
~$56.2 million over 30 months of milestone achievements.  


The deal presents two big negative implications for Israeli inkjet printing company, Kornit. These are particularly
worrisome just as the company tries to make the critical expansion from the T-shirt makers’ market into the roll-to-
roll market. Roll-to-roll printers allow images to be printed on fabrics that are then sewn into garments, wallpaper,
furniture coverings, etc.


First, Reggiani, already a top rival whose sales jumped 61 percent between 2012 and 2013 to ~$76 million, will likely
become a roll-to-roll gorilla.


The acquisition by Electronics for Imaging (EFII) means the rebranded EFI Reggiani will be able to use the money
and advanced distribution channels afforded by EFII. So it will negatively impact Kornit’s future potential – as Kornit
tries to get its commercial roll-to-roll printer launched in about 18 months.


Second, this deal should have a downward effect on Kornit’s valuation today.


The deal means EFII is unwilling to pay an acquisition anything close to Kornit’s current ~6 times revenue and ~50
times EBITDA.


Indeed, EFII has shown that it’s willing to pony up only 1.8 times revenue and 7-12 times EBITDA. That means, it
would pay no more than about $56 million to $127 million for Kornit, which equals $1.88 to $4.26 per share

Kornit Digital: Inkjet Printer Company Attempting To Trade At 3-D Printer Valuation,

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 146/226


Israeli printer company Kornit Digital (KRNT), swung into the inkjet printing jungle as a $16 million acquisition that
went public last April. In the shifting eyes of the market, it grew up almost overnight into a nearly half-a-billion dollar
beast.


But, with fangs bared, a snarling threat lies in wait for Kornit shareholders. The market has been led to
misunderstand Kornit’s true business.


Kornit is a small manufacturer of inkjet printers used to print images and designs directly onto T-shirts and other
garments.


Yet the market has slapped a ~$400 million valuation on this small inkjet printer company that last quarter posted
just $17.6 million revenue and a $200,000 net loss. Why?


“You wouldn’t be able to IPO a $16 million company at huge valuation if you didn’t throw out some nice buzz words,”
an analyst told TheStreetSweeper.


The buzz word is 3-D printers. Some analysts have compared Kornit with 3-D printer companies, prompting
widespread misunderstanding and baseless exuberance about Kornit’s potential.


So, while investors may find other viewpoints here, below is an executive summary of why we think Kornit is one of
the worst creatures in the jungle. Then we’ll move on to our key points.


*Executive Summary


*Misunderstood Hype - Due to analyst hype, the market erroneously believes inkjet printer Kornit is a 3-D printing
company and has assigned a correspondingly ridiculous valuation – a valuation we believe Kornit cannot possibly
grow into.


*Not 3-D - Using a commercially available printer head and boasting just ~7 patents, Kornit printers lack the
“specialness” to possibly justify any comparison to 3-D printers.


*Overvalued - Kornit trades at an outlandish 50 times EBITDA and ~68 times earnings; both are close to 10 times
pricier than comparable companies.


*Killer Competitors - Gorilla rivals such as Aeoon, Brothers, Epson and many others are stomping Kornit in the
direct-to-garment area that serves custom T-shirt companies. Kornit’s signature “Breeze” printer costs twice as much
as a top rival’s and prints on about the same number of T-shirts per hour.


*Late To Market - Kornit wants to pursue roll-to-roll (R2R) printing on fabric, but four years after introducing its
Allegro solution, the commercial launch may still be 18 months out. Worse, a sole supplier issue could threaten both
direct-to-garment and roll-to-roll products. Meanwhile, Dover, Durst and Konica Minolta are dominating this area.


*Dilution Appears Imminent - Kornit will likely lose significant ground even before the September stock lockup
expiration, potentially unleashing millions of shares onto the market. See “Final Bone-Crusher: Stock Overhang”
below to get the overhang details. A controlling shareholder could cash in essentially a pennies-on-the-dollar
transaction at current stock prices.


*$6 Target Price – At ~$13 a share, creating a $387 million market cap for a company with a pathetic $4.6 million in
the bank, it only makes sense for Kornit to fill its money chest with capital raised now. So we wouldn’t be surprised
to see the stock drop off the cliff to $6 a share. And even that is extremely generous.

Uranium Energy Corporation: The Bad News Buried In The Recent Sale

Uranium Energy looks ready to do just that to investors.


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for comment but investors may find other
viewpoints here. Meanwhile, we’ve leaned on some ol’ country songs to help us croon out the risks.

TheStreetSweeper Quick Hit: Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO) Desperation


TheStreetSweeper issues an alert about a desperate situation occurring at Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO). The
biotech’s recently hyped effort – early Phase 1 data for its experimental cancer tumor injectable shows 27 of 39
patients remain alive after up to 18 months after injection - comes at a heavy, perhaps even fatal cost.


NWBO retained the services of Cognate BioServices to conduct clinical trials and associated work. Now, Cognate
has hit up NWBO for $8.2 million and the biotech is coming up short. It still owed Cognate $5.8 million as of March
31.


This is just the latest in a series of stunning negatives, including:


*1. Cash has plummeted to just $3.2 million.


*2. Cash burn hit ~$17 million.


*3. Working capital deficit soared to $86 million.


*4. CEO Linda F. Powers’ company bio doesn’t mention it, but Ms. Powers was Enron’s senior vice president for
global operations, though she wasn’t implicated in the scandal. She controls NWBO’s major funding sources Toucan
Capital and Toucan Partners, holders of ~4% of outstanding shares.


*5. Expensive lawsuits have gone in NWBO’s favor and against it, such as a class-action securities lawsuit alleging
the company issued misleading press releases. NWBO agreed to settle for $1 million. NWBO also received demand
letters from shareholders seeking access to books with the intention of investigating possible mismanagement and
breaches of fiduciary duty.


*6. Market value is $760 million. With just 12 full-time employees, the company last year spent $85.6 million in R&D
and $16.9 million in general and administrative.


*7. Extremely promising competing therapeutics are undergoing testing by Stanford and numerous companies.


*8. Serious doubts exist about NWBO’s survival, according to its SEC filings:


“Because of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit there is
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”


*9. NWBO’s 10-K filing warns: “We will need to raise substantial funds, on an ongoing basis…”


Indeed, it adds: “Any financing will involve issuance of equity and/or debt, and such issuances will be
dilutive to existing shareholders.”


*10. Operating losses exceeded its abysmal revenue – a $194,000 research grant - by a factor of 117:

eMagin: Imagine This Stock Collapsing Below $1


Looking for all the world like a virtual reality gamer, eMagin Corp. (EMAN) has been virtually running in place ever
since the introduction of its first microdisplay 14 long years ago.


And now one of the OLED (organic light emitting diode) display maker’s greatest rivals has reached across and hit
eMagin’s reverse button … stealing a Navy contract right out from under its nose.


This – and additional adversity – will likely squash the almost flat revenue anticipated for 2015. Though EMAN just
turned a slight profit after seven straight quarters of losses, these challenges suggest it may have a tough time
hanging onto that oh-so-tenuous profitability.


Investors may check out other viewpoints here, which include bullish points such as EMAN will gain government
contracts, improve compared to rivals and find growth opportunities. 


Meanwhile, we’ll hit the top reasons EMAN’s virtual shoot-out will likely end badly. We’re looking for the stock price
to drop below $1 because:


*1. Yowza! Trading At 100 Times Earnings?!?


The most bullish analyst estimates EMAN’s earnings will reach 3 cents per share for the year. So that means
investors are paying an astronomical 100 times more than the earnings they expect to receive.  


That’s a lot considering the fact that EMAN is a little OLED microdisplay maker with declining revenue - not one of
the highflying biotechs working on a cure for cancer.


We’ll save the multiple we’re generously projecting for EMAN for the conclusion of this article.

Cracking The Code On DigiMarc (DMRC): Deteriorating Business Will Continue To Decline -
Part 2


Barcode technology company Digimarc faces even more challenges beyond those detailed in TheStreetSweeper’s
part 1, including:


*Digimarc’s Discover remains undiscovered


Digimarc hopes it can advance its Digimarc Discover – designed to combine “invisible” barcode technology and
media experiences - sufficiently to fill in the gaps left by declining revenue from major customers such as Intellectual
Ventures, whose license payments have ended and consulting fees will end this year. But that appears unlikely.


Why? There are three major reasons.


*Negative reviews


*First, most reviewers had problems with the quality of Digimarc Discover.


In fact, most of the 986 Appszoom reviews of the product were negative, giving Discover a measly ranking of 1 ½
stars:





(Source: AppsZoom)


Meanwhile, the majority of reviewers gave the product 1 star out of 5 stars at play.google.com, though it did make a
total of 2.9 stars.  


Photographer, webmaster and gear reviewer Ken Rockwell is not impressed with Digimarc Discover, either. He said
the product degrades images, requires larger compressed JPEG files, is not invisible and offers many
disadvantages.


*Turning the pack


Second, groups such as product manufacturers, scanner makers, package printers and retailers have to be
convinced to switch from their current barcode.


Manufacturers would face additional costs to switch to a different barcode. Retailers who would like to use the
Digimarc barcode would face the costly, time-consuming effort of adding camera capabilities to all scanners, as well
as expensive fees.


This chart breaks down the cost of Digimarc’s $350 setup fee per code and $50 per year maintenance fee with the
UPC barcode costs:





# of items
needing UPC
barcode


Initial fee $ Yearly  fee $ Total $


# of items
needing
DigiMarc
barcode


Initial fee $ Yearly fee $ Total $


1-10 250 50 300 1-10 350 50 400


1-100 750 150 900 1-100 3,500 50 3,550


1-1,000 2,500 500 3,000 1-1000 350,000 50 350,050


Up to 10,000 6,500 1,300 7,800 1-10,000 3,500,000 50 3,500,050


Up to 100,000 10,500 2,100 12,600 Up to 100,000 35,000,000  50 35,000,050


(Sources: Seeking Alpha, GS1 US)


So, understandably, retailers would balk at plunking down as much as 3,000 times more for Digimarc’s barcode than
for the current low-cost, perfectly capable barcode.


*Walmart failure offers sad model


Third, Walmart’s infamous barcode replacement attempt serves as a model of disappointment.

Cracking The Code On DigiMarc (DMRC): Deteriorating Business Will Continue To Decline


Though Digimarc Corp. (DMRC) revenue dropped to a five-year low and some licensing deals have fallen apart,
executives have raked in more than $6 million in compensation and sold shares like crazy.


CEO Bruce Davis even got a raise in November, bringing his base salary to $600,000. 


Include Mr. Davis’s stock awards and 401-K contributions, and it all adds up to $3.39 million.


Not only that but, if and when his job ends, Mr. Davis will receive at least $600,000 yearly for two years after
termination.


Meanwhile, three other top executives just had another $260,000 worth of stock apiece added to their compensation
packages, bringing their total compensation to nearly $800,000 apiece.


And, just for attending up to five board meetings a year, Digimarc’s four directors each received compensation in the
$150,000 range.


Ultimately, compensation for executives and directors in 2014 consumed a jaw-dropping 26 percent of total revenue.


While investors may read exclusively bullish viewpoints here on the Beaverton, Oregon “invisible” barcode maker,
we’ll hit on other concerns expected to ultimately send this highflyer crashing back to reality.

PlasmaTech Biopharmaceuticals: Hyped Up ... Old "News" ... Going Down


PlasmaTech Biopharmaceuticals (PTBI) rocketed on “news” that the FDA granted orphan drug status to its newly
acquired gene therapy products.


But PTBI’s announcement is simply hype churned out to raise the stock price … which is exactly what it did.


Why would we claim this is nothing more than a stock-hyping promotion?


The products had already received orphan drug designations – and been announced.


One full year ago.


Here’s the headline:


“Abeona Therapeutics Receives U.S. Orphan Drug Designations for treatment of Sanfilippo Syndromes A and B”


PTBI announced May 6 that it would acquire Abeona, along with the acquisition’s therapy for Sanfilippo Syndromes
A and B.  Two weeks later, PTBI issued its press release making it sound as if it had just received the US Food and
Drug Administration designation for the therapies, here.


PTBI said FDA granted the designation for PTBI’s “lead product candidates for the treatment of Sanfilippo
Syndromes A and B.” Orphan drug designation makes it easier to gain marketing approval to treat a rare medical
condition or “orphan disease.”


PTBI’s new CEO, Tim Miller, Abeona’s former CEO, is quoted in both the current and the year-old release.  


Indeed, the FDA website shows both experimental drugs, here and here, received “orphan designation” in May
2014. An FDA spokeswoman noted they are not yet FDA approved for sale.


As for the Rare Pediatric Disease designation that PTBI says it has also received, a PTBI corporate presentation
suggests Abeona had already received the designation. Spokeswoman Sandy Walsh said the FDA does not
disclose the names of companies that request or receive this type of designation.


But this is just the beginning of a long list of issues that we believe will soon ground the PTBI rocket.


While investors may find other viewpoints here, we’ll tick off additional reasons we believe this stock is on the verge
of crashing back to earth.


*Promotions:  “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.” Or is there?


PTBI stock has also been hyped recently by promotional firms like Blue Horseshoe Stocks, here, and posted on
associated newsletter sites such as PennyMotion.com here and other sites.       


Seeking Alpha also has published two PTBI articles in the last few weeks, both fairly bullish and written by the same
author.


On May 18, contributor to TheStreet.com touted the Soros investment and the initiation on a “buy” by H.C.
Wainwright.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 150/226


DLS Research, owner of SmithOnStocks, has also promoted PTBI, when the pharmaceutical company was called
Access Pharmaceuticals. Investors may check here, where a Seeking Alpha author took DLS to task.


And HotStocked is yet another business that has trumpeted PTBI.


Investing in companies that must rely on stock promoters to get more eyeballs on their stock is risky business. Other
company investors have taken the advice of promoters, such as Jonathan Lebed. TheStreetSweeper wrote about
the Lebed-promoted Jive in 2012, which ended in disaster for virtually everyone but the Lebed team (JIVE, then
~$24, now ~$5.55).


*Bad News: Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful says, “It’s all about the moneeeey!”


PTBI last year increased cash by cutting expenses such as its lifeblood - research and development – and diluting
shareholders’ stock. Its accounts payable rose and revenue collapsed.


Here are more details:


 Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 % Change


Net Income/Loss $-26.8 m $4.5 m Down 702%


Revenue $    .9 m $2.0 m Down 122%


Accounts payable $  1.9 m $  .9 m Up 120%


Research & Dev. $    .3 m $  .9 m Down 62%


 (Source: SEC filings)


PTBI blames losses on R&D:


“Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities …and from
associated administrative costs.”


Then PTBI turned around and noted a few pages later that R&D dropped more than half-a-million bucks!


Indeed, those “associated administrative costs” really mean stock-based compensation jumped astronomically.


In fact, stock-based compensation nearly tripled.


For their hand in running the company that’s now lost $298 million, PTBI folks received $1.3 million in stock-based
compensation.


 Dec. 31, 2014 Dec. 31, 2013 Percent Change


Stock-based comp $1.3 m $0.4 m Up 197%





Wowser! The deeper the hole, the better the pay.


Full compensation is hard to track in PTBI’s game of executive musical chairs but new CEO Miller will receive
$350,000 yearly, along with a possible bonus and stock options for 400,000 shares worth around $3.5 million.


Another big player who has sat in several chairs and handled at least five of PTBI’s private stock offerings through
his SCO Securities, is Steven Rouhandeh, executive chairman.


PTBI’s filings note this about SCO entities linked to Mr. Rouhandeh: “During 2014 and 2013, SCO and affiliates
charged $300,000 each year in investor relations fees.”


Mr. Rouhandeh’s stock option awards for 2014? Those alone were worth $523,000.


In fact, Mr. Rouhandeh and his SCO entities own over 14 million shares, exceeding a whopping 65 percent
ownership.


*What About Soros?


News on May 5-7 regarding the George Soros disclosure of 1.16 million shares or 5. 17 percent of PTBI evidently
prompted some investors to take a chance on the stock, assisting the rally to $9.


But that stock cost Soros a fraction of what today’s retail investor is paying. The Soros fund’s increased position
works out to a price of ~$3 per share for one block of 250,000 shares and ~$0.93 per share for the second block,
according to the fund’s SEC filing.


And the position in PTBI is extremely small.


The Soros fund lists stock held in ~230 companies in the last quarter, records show. The fund includes many
positions of those other companies of 10 million or more shares accumulated in that timeframe.


Is Soros still holding a position in PTBI now that the stock is about three times or more than the purchase price?

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 151/226


Fund managers have not yet responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for a comment. But how long Soros might
hold onto PTBI shares is a burning question, particularly considering the current price and all the institutional types
selling PTBI.


*Top Investors Dump PTBI Stock


Three out of PTBI’s five biggest institutional investors have begun dumping its stock. These are Oracle, Sabby and
Deerfield.    


A total of seven institutional holders have whittled away at their holdings. PTBI’s biggest institutional investor,
Oracle, has axed its shares to nearly half the original number. Two other institutions, Equitec and Messner & Smith,
have sold out.

InterCloud Systems: Form D, Other Stormy Issues Threaten This Non-Cloud Company


InterCloud Systems (ICLD) stock blew through low-hanging clouds on a recent small contract award and today’s
announcement of an effort to improve clients’ experience.


But InterCloud is in such dire financial straits that top executives and directors just filed notice for the sale of $3
million in stock.


And that is just the most recent of numerous stormy issues promising to dissipate InterCloud’s stock and leave
stockholders drenched without an umbrella in sight.  


Here are some bullish viewpoints for investors to consider. Meanwhile, below are the top cloud-busters that make us
hate this stock:


*Reality Check Number 1: New Form D Filing, Horrible Financials


InterCloud’s CEO, President, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three directors signed off this
week on the newest stock offering of $3 million through Aegis Capital. Disclosed under Form D, the first date of sale
of the stock occurred May 14.


This may be just the beginning of such efforts for InterCloud. The company’s net income plummeted 200 percent
last quarter versus a year ago. So net income dropped from $10.4 million to $-10.3 million.


Indeed, the company’s income, EBITDA and other metrics fall well below competitors and the industry as a whole,
as shown here.


The company’s history of incredibly bad earnings and earnings misses, sometimes over 1000 percent, is shown
here and below:

Chanticleer Holdings (HOTR): Turning Down The Fire


Chanticleer Holdings (HOTR) has recently been scorching hot. Yet its business plan is so cold, it could have frozen
the raunchy wit right off legendary sex symbol Mae West.


But let’s assume she would have fluttered her eyelashes, patted a blond wave and recovered quickly enough to
reveal the secrets of the North Carolina company that owns 46 company-owned and franchise locations, including
13 Hooters, six American Burger Co. restaurants, plus seven Just Fresh and 20 BGR locations.


We’ll let Mae and other voluptuous sirens help unveil some risks slinking up on HOTR.


*HOTR’s Nothing Without You, Seeking Alpha.


“Plastic surgeons are always making mountains out of molehills,” Dolly Parton once said. When it comes to HOTR,
just substitute “Seeking Alpha authors” for “plastic surgeons” and you get the idea.


In an interview with the chief executive published April 16, for example, a Seeking Alpha author prompted CEO Mike
Pruitt to hype HOTR’s far-from-beautiful financials this way:


“When profitability is reached, what is your philosophy on use of cash? Returned via cash dividends or buybacks, or
100% retained for possible future acquisitions? When do you expect the company to be in a position to return cash
to shareholders?”

Clean Diesel Technologies: Burning Cash, Emitting Spotted History and Financials


If a company’s business is so flimsy that optimistic analysts must resort to commenting on the company’s “body
language” for good results, you know you’re in for a ride.


But if you dare look past Clean Diesel Technologies’ (CDTI) body language into the financials, rapidly dying legacy
products, the emissions funding problems, lost tax credits, fleeing CFO, historical allegations of behavior believed
detrimental to shareholders validated by federal regulators’ orders – and SEC charges against a CDTI promoter –
you know it has all the markings of one short, unforgettable, miserable ride.


CDTI manufactures and distributes emission control systems and products for the light-duty vehicle and heavy-duty
diesel market. The bull thesis contends the company will make progress in transforming its business and will make
commercial strides with its DuraFit offering. Roth Capital, which notes it expects to receive or intends to seek
business with CDTI in the next three months, reiterated its “buy” rating in a research report sent to investors
Wednesday morning. With the stock sitting at about $2.17, Roth set a $2.50 price target.  


Investors should check out other viewpoints here while we describe our concerns about CDTI and why we think the
stock price should collapse.


*Terrible Financials


Investors may see in the table below that CDTI’s financial picture worsened in all three important areas:

Gevo: Cash Issues Resemble Another Big Loser, Dilution Pro -- Viggle


TheStreetSweeper issues a Gevo (GEVO) Quick Hit.


Just a month after Gevo’s board approved the desperate 1-to-15 reverse stock split that pushed the stock from
~$0.18 to ~$2, Gevo may be primed for a stock offering.


The stock is rallying today, yet the renewable fuels company is money-starved with only $4.4 million in cash. As it
burns through about $10 million per quarter, it may have problems meeting its financial obligations.


This looks like another Viggle (VGGL) situation. Viggle, too, faces massive debt, low cash and going concern issues.
We tweeted a VGGL update on Monday. See below:


“Troubling $VGGL rally on earnings! Cash dropped to $715,000. Burns ~$6m/Q, now needs $19m over current
cash. We’re short.”


Sure enough, today the company filed a registration statement for $40-million of stock. That stock is down as much
as ~30 percent since Monday.


We’re feeling a sense of déjà vu.


Gevo just reported a net loss of $7.3 million and accumulated losses of $310.6 million, and, while it anticipates $6
million in proceeds from warrants, it’s feeling the pressure of interest payments for $26 million in debt coming up in
2017 and $24.9 million in 2022.

QuinStreet: A Wreck Right Around The Corner


One minute, QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) was merrily redirecting traffic from Google searches and picking up
millions along the way in exchange for generating leads.


The next minute, two trucks flew around the corner, with President Obama at the wheel of one and Google at the
other. Wham!


Once investors understand the true impact of that double-whammy, we think they'll agree that QuinStreet's business
model looks like a beat-up, old jalopy. We'll explain why below but investors should also take a look at opposing
viewpoints here.


*Losing customers: A flick of President Obama's pen and shuttered colleges


QuinStreet gets paid for gathering information when people type in something like "online college degree," or "credit
cards," or "cheap car insurance," and then generating online sales leads for for-profit schools, credit card companies
and auto insurance companies.


But QuinStreet's Education division is clearly taking several huge hits - hits that promise to thwart future revenue in
this area.


For example, President Obama veered into QuinStreet's business with his plan for free community college.

This plan would damage QuinStreet's for-profit education customer base going forward because many of the people
who might appreciate the flexibility of a for-profit college would enroll in community college if it became free.


Just as ominously, federal and state regulators are cracking down on QuinStreet's for-profit higher education
customer. A US Senate committee revealed a disturbing investigation into for-profit education. And attorney
generals across the country have been investigating these colleges' "dubious practices."


Corinthian Colleges (COCO) filed for bankruptcy last week amid federal allegations it deceived students.


The US Department of Education forced Corinthian - already slapped with a $30 million fine - to close the last of its
campuses just a few weeks ago.


With $6 billion in federal student loans and grants, Corinthian was a significant client for QuinStreet. Its loss was not
reflected in QuinStreet's last earnings.


Corinthian proved to be the canary in the for-profit college mine, signaling the intensifying implosion of the industry.
Along with Corinthian, Career Education Corp. and Education Management Corp. fell beneath federal regulators'
crackdown against colleges allegedly taking advantage of low income students and hitting them with debt.
Regulators have left behind massive campuses closings, Education Management's delisting itself from Nasdaq and
a loss of nearly $8 billion in market valuation.

Clean Energy Fuels: The Dirty Truth


That horrifying noise assaulting investors’ ears is the sound of Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE) braking and swerving in
the middle of the highway.


TheStreetSweeper is convinced it’s time to get out of Clean’s path while we still can.


Enamored with clean energy, investors found it easy to buy into Clean on fourth quarter results showing a bump in
revenue.  At first we, too, were almost charmed by the provider of natural gas – compressed (CNG) and liquefied
(LNG) – for long-haul trucks, buses, taxis, etc.


But when we broke out our toolbox, we discovered a wreck that will remain too banged up to make the long haul.
Investors may find other viewpoints here, as we highlight the top risks poised to run down Clean Energy
shareholders.


*1. Look under the hood: financials


First, the bump in revenue to $132 million wasn’t really the outperformance many thought. Check page 16 of its
federal filing and note where $28.4 million of revenue came from: “federal fuel tax credits” which “expired on
December 31, 2014.” Plus, another $12 million came from another one-time gain – the sale of Clean’s interest in a
Dallas biomethane plant.


Second, gross profit per gallon declined to $0.26. That’s 2 cents less than the quarter before and 5 cents less than
the prior year.


Gross profit was expected to be $0.29, according to Piper Jaffray’s Alexander Potter and Winnie Dong – who called
a $3.25 price target on Sunday, March 1, 2015. Clean had just closed at $6.01.  


“We are growing increasingly skeptical that this key metric can/will eventually rise,” analysts wrote of the gross profit.


Third, Clean’s adjusted EBITDA was not positive. It was actually negative at -$3.2 million.


Clean actually had a loss of $0.01, while firms like Raymond James were looking for positive earnings of $0.05.


The bull case accounts for a relatively strong balance sheet and that Clean should be able to reach positive cash
flow.


But we strongly believe Clean’s financials should have sent investors racing …. For the exits.


*2. LNG bet goes up in smoke. Clean Energy has placed a bet that long-haul trucking would easily switch from
diesel to liquefied natural gas. But that has not happened.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 154/226


TheStreetSweeper highlights the cash burn, business shift, lawsuit allegations, and other issues that we believe
make CHOP shares worth a couple of quarters or maybe even, as one analyst said, “zero.”


Meanwhile, investors may find other viewpoints here about the Chinese cold-rolled steel manufacturer. The
company’s thin steel product – sometimes only as wide as a human hair – is sold to the Chinese food packaging,
electrical appliances and construction materials industries.


CHOP has not yet responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for an interview.


*Virtually no cash left


CHOP has been burning through a mountain of cash – about $240 million in three quarters or $80 million per
quarter - the company now reports just $2.3 million of unrestricted cash and $50 million in restricted cash remaining.
At the current unbelievable burn rate, CHOP must find more operating money soon.


*History of massive revenue decline, debt problems and recent cash-poor position


CHOP shares suddenly rocketed from 70 cents apiece to about $4, in opposition to the direction of the company’s
cash and revenue.


The company’s revenue has been spiraling downward for some time, as shown in the company’s Securities and
Exchange Commission filings:


  Filed Jan. 6, 2015:





Third Quarter 2014 Results Revenue decreased 90.0% to $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2014 from
$30.9 million in the third quarter of 2013. Nine Months 2014 Results Revenue was $62.2 million in the
first nine months of 2014 compared with $119.6 million in the first nine months of 2013…As of June 30,
2014, the Company had $3.0 million in unrestricted cash…





The company also posted a loss of $6 million in the third quarter. Noting its one-for-ten reverse stock split, the
company blamed poor results on low steel prices, declining sales, credit problems, downtime of production lines,
bank loan defaults and working capital shortages.  


 Filed Sept. 4, 2014:


Second Quarter Results Revenue decreased 24.1% to $32.7 million in the second quarter of 2014 from $43.1
million in the second quarter of 2013. Gross profit decreased 51.8% to $1.7 million in the second quarter of
2014 from $3.5 million in the same quarter of 2013.


Gross margin was 5.2% … Operating loss was $0.6 million…Net loss was $1.4 million.


 Filed May 20, 2014:





First Quarter Results Revenue decreased 42.0% to $26.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 from $45.6
million in the first quarter of 2013. Gross profit decreased 123.9% to ($1.2 million) in the first quarter of
2014 from $5.2 million in the same quarter of 2013.





The chart from Bloomberg below, presents a vivid image of CHOP’s perilous cash position, plummeting from about
$200 million or more in the second quarter of 2012 through the first quarter last year, down to a few million in the
second and third quarters of 2014:

Inuvo: Top Reasons This Stock Should Dive


Arkansas-based Inuvo (INUV) is working in a business that elicits the same level of enthusiasm as, say, receiving a
dinnertime call from a telemarketer or getting a visit from a solicitor peddling a coat-full of fake Rolex watches.


INUV and its peers have seen some doors slammed on their businesses previously. And this Internet marketing and
technology company could see many more slammed doors in the near future.


Let’s look at INUV’s background and then get right to the top reasons TheStreetSweeper is watching for a decline in
INUV’s stock – likely below the $2 level.


Investors should also take a look at other viewpoints on INUV here.


*Background.


Recent hype that Google and Yahoo have renewed deals with INUV are actually quite routine. Virtually all
companies in this space have a relationship with the two Internet search providers, though these relationships seem
to change rather often.


A big change occurred a few years ago in the toolbar business that was making millions for INUV and others. The
Internet version of the solicitor banging on the door at dinnertime, these toolbars automatically installed when you
downloaded a video. A search in the toolbar would be an INUV search, powered by Yahoo or Google. And the
revenues from ad clicks were shared by the toolbar vendor and the search company.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 155/226


But Google made a small change that drastically dropped toolbar downloads. Bye-bye searches with random Kim
Kardashian rear-end pix popping up. Bye-bye key market opportunity for INUV and peers.


So INUV transitioned out of toolbar downloads. The company now focuses on the digital publishing business and
building ads for other web publishers.


CEO Richard Howe told TheStreetSweeper that INUV works at keeping fresh, interesting content in its properties
focusing on health, finance, careers, travel and local interests.


“On the ad tech side, the key there is really to build new and better ad units,” he said. “These would be ads that you
see on the website when you go visit the website. You may think they’re ads that just sit there and don’t do anything,
but the ones that perform the best have some sort of intelligence behind them.”


A long-time analyst in this space scoffed, “At the end of the day, these are banner ads.”


It’s such a fast-moving space that it even sometimes gets ahead of INUV. In one slightly awkward moment during
the interview, we wondered about the “TastyNewDishes.com” that INUV promoted in its February corporate
presentation, on page 8, here. We couldn’t find it in our Internet search.


“Sometimes publishers leave, right? So we may … need to revise the presentation,” said Mr. Howe, noting someone
else mentioned the same thing this week. “I’ve got to go look into why.”


*Stock offering? CEO says, “It’s certainly something that our board is now talking about.”


Mr. Howe told TheStreetSweeper that a stock offering has not been “something we have contemplated up until now.”


He said the board hadn’t considered a raise before because they didn’t want to cause dilution since it wasn’t
necessary.


“It’s not like we need the money,” he added.


“Now that the stock price is rising, while we haven’t decided to do an equity raise, it’s certainly something that our
board is now talking about,” said Mr. Howe.


He wouldn’t elaborate, of course, on exactly how soon a stock offering might happen.


“Whether that means we’ll do it or not, is a whole other story. And, like I said, we’re certainly not in any hurry to do
it,” added Mr. Howe.


*Striking decline in INUV’s website traffic.


The number of unique visitors, so vital to growth for companies like INUV, has shown a stunning decline of about 50
percent for INUV over a year. See the chart below, measuring the traffic to INUV’s http://health.alot.com/website,
according to the “Nielsen of website traffic,” Compete.com:

UniPixel: This Steamroller Is About To Squash Investors


Many of today’s investors, one sage noted, seem to be picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.


Specifically, UniPixel (UNXL) is gunning its engine and we think that big machine is just about to flatten unfortunate
investors - again.


The Woodlands, Texas company makes touchscreen film for electronic devices and a hard coat protective film for
various uses. The stock just recently emerged from a two-year-long drop from about $40 to the recent ~$6.70.


The initial run-up two years ago escalated on news of a UniPixel-Kodak partnership announcement that April,
targeting year-end 2013 to begin reeling out rolls of film to make touchscreens respond to touch. This seemed to
validate the technology. Never mind that Kodak and Kingsbury Corp. released a very similar announcement two
months later about their partnership that, apparently unlike the UniPixel deal, has landed a sale. And no one knew
then that the UniPixel-Kodak roll-out would hit multiple delays and not happen until … well, everyone’s still waiting
two years later. Regardless, the stock lingered in the $30-$40 range.


Later in 2013, the stock began cratering amid a pile of reports suggesting problems including excessive promotions,
misallocation of capital, repeated delays, heavy competition, disappointing technology, questionable insiders (see a
bull’s interesting response here), along with class-action lawsuits, including one later dismissed and others settled.


And it was all capped off by the Securities and Exchange Commission issuing subpoenas on Nov. 19, 2013 in
connection with some UniPixel sensor agreements, hurtling the stock down to around $12 and gradually trailing
downward.


But recently, the market has forgotten about UniPixel’s problems and its zero revenue in each quarter of 2014 and
its missed earnings. Indeed, investors sent the stock rocketing to about $6 on hopes the company may be able this
quarter to begin commercial production of a hard-coat resin and a sensor product.


TheStreetSweeper has not yet received a response to requests to UniPixil for an interview.


Check out other viewpoints here and we’ll lay out the top reasons we think it’s time to drop the pennies and run like
crazy.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story

Heron Therapeutics: Rise of the Phoenix, or Fall of the Dodo Bird?


Heron Therapeutics (HRTX), a tiny drug company with no approved product and nothing but losses to report, may
be just about ready to drop eye-popping news on investors.


“At some point in time, we’ll probably do a small equity raise to top off the tank,” CEO Barry Quart told
TheStreetSweeper.


How small?


“I would not anticipate the raise being any substantially different than the raises we have done in the last year or
two,” he said in a phone interview out of his San Diego office.  


“Those were … around $60 million or so,” he said, adding the raise might wait until data for a post-operation pain
program is released this summer.


Asked why he has been selling Heron stock - $130,000 worth in the past few weeks - he said that has nothing to do
with his perception of the company’s future.


Though his compensation exceeds $8 million, the chief executive said he simply needed to pay for two upcoming
weddings.


Those stock sales, along with sales by another officer, have occurred amid a stock price pop of some 40 percent
since January. Eager, biotech-fevered investors have been looking for study results for Heron’s top candidate,
Sustol, plus eventual FDA approval to begin marketing, along with more news of its post-operative pain gel.


But Mr. Quart said investors may simply be just starting to pay attention to the company.


“Heron is the rebranding of a company that had a long and checkered past … A.P. Pharma,” he said. “I think the
story had grown old and there wasn’t a lot of interest in our lead product - not a lot of significant, broad interest - in
our lead product, which is for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.”


Will the company continue its Phoenix-like rise? Or will Heron become tomorrow’s biotech dodo bird?


While investors may find various viewpoints here, we’ll lay out some key concerns surrounding this company that
remains unprofitable  – after 32 years of trying.


*Heron’s Food and Drug Administration applications fail, projected launches fail, but dilutive stock offerings are
common.


*Not only is the CEO selling stock, so is a senior vice president.  The two both sold shares in March, significantly …
before release of study results and before resubmission of its new drug application to the FDA.


*Risk to potential sales includes heavy competition, small market and unfortunate timing as the leading drug goes
generic.


*The $420 million market cap reflects full success. Should Heron actually succeed at virtually any level, we believe
there’s little upside remaining.


Here are the details:


*History of multiple FDA applications, projected “launches.” All failed.


Redwood City, Calif.-based Heron has been trying for years to get the US Food and Drug Administration to approve
Sustol (APF530) under a new drug application or NDA that would allow the drug to be sold. It has tried since May
2009.


Heron’s application for its nausea and vomiting drug got its first denial letter or “complete response letter” in March
2010, sending the stock down 54 percent.


The FDA’s “CLR” to Heron (then A.P. Pharma) pointed to major concerns in multiple areas, including the two-syringe
system, manufacturing deficiencies found during inspections, and a need for reanalysis of efficacy data.


In March 2013, the agency once again rejected the APF530 (Sustol) application, citing many of the same issues the
company had been told to address in 2010.


Heron has spent the past two years trying to address the concerns contained in the last FDA rejection letter.


And no one really knows whether Sustol will get yet another FDA rejection.


If it does, we can expect at least the level of investor backlash that the stock endured previously. On March 28,
2013, the stock collapsed to 52 cents, a 12 percent drop in premarket trading when the company disclosed the
Sustol application denial. The chart shows the decline, adjusted for the stock split.

EBIX: Caught with Its Hand in the Cookie Jar

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 157/226


Editor’s Note: To simplify matters, TheStreetSweeper has provided links to many of the documents that it
used to prepare this investigative report – along with the detailed instructions necessary to replicate its
calculations and verify its claims – in a lengthy series of endnotes that appear at the bottom of this story.


Ebix (Nasdaq: EBIX) better learn how to control its appetite. The last time that the hungry rollup company raided the
cookie jar, the firm may have finally pushed its luck a little bit too far.


After relying on a blatant accounting trick to artificially sweeten its fourth-quarter earnings – and then concealing the
hefty gain that allowed it to beat profit estimates that it would have otherwise missed – Ebix left behind some rather
incriminating evidence. In the formal 10-K report that it filed a few days after it pulled that brazen stunt, the company
provided enough fresh clues to reveal (among other juicy secrets reserved for later stories) the following:


·      Ebix added millions of dollars to its net income last year by impatiently reversing most of its reserves for
potential “earn-out” payments to the very acquisition target responsible for the celebrated European contract that the
company just won.


·      Following its acquisition of two companies in the first half of 2014, Ebix swiftly reversed all of the potential earn-
out bonus for the first and most of that for the second by the end of that same year. Ebix recognized at least a
portion of the resulting decline in its earn-out liabilities as net income and may have aggressively booked far more
generous gains before its recent acquisition targets ever got a legitimate chance to actually prove themselves.


·      After reversing most of the reserves that it established for earn-out payments to many of the firms that it has
purchased in recent years – without formally impairing any of the goodwill assigned to those companies – Ebix must
have finally resigned itself to the inevitable. Since its goodwill balance increased by a smaller amount than the
goodwill assigned to the firms that it purchased during the fourth quarter, Ebix clearly recognized some kind of write-
down but apparently decided to bury that disturbing evidence.


Ebix ignored a request by TheStreetSweeper to quantify the reserves that it originally established for each one of
the firms that it acquired over the past several years, along with any adjustments that it made to those contingent
liabilities and any gains that it recorded as a result, in spite of the profound difference that earn-out reversals have
repeatedly made in its financial results.

TubeMogul: It's All About The Numbers (And They Aren't Pretty)


New industry data on TubeMogul (TUBE) provides a brutal reality check for the digital video advertising company
that has recently become a Wall Street darling.


This infatuation has given TubeMogul an optimistic $400 million market valuation. But that valuation is not supported
by key industry factors defined by big-data analysis firm comScore.


The data on unique video views and ad videos viewed show that TubeMogul’s performance is falling behind the rest
of the industry.


TubeMogul’s ad view traffic began its downhill slide in December, falling 9 percent. January ad views year-over-year
dropped almost 21 percent in January and more than 16 percent in February.


In contrast, BrightRoll, a Yahoo division, enjoyed 116 percent growth YOY in December, 44 percent in January and
39 percent in February.


The trend for TubeMogul, then, has clearly been just the opposite of the industry in December, January and
February.


See various viewpoints here, and the chart below. Our chart shows key comScore data. The data mashes month-
by-month figures for Google, BrightRoll, AOL, LiveRail (Facebook acquisition), SpotXchange, Specific Media, Hulu,
Tremor Video, Videology Inc. and TubeMogul going back as far as June 2009.

MicroVision: Why We Don�t See The Vision


MicroVision’s (MVIS) product and future still look stunningly microscopic, despite the big frenzy over an order for its
tiny projector components.


MicroVision emerged about the time gasoline was $1 and the auto-film rewind Sure Shot cameras were the big
thing.


When MicroVision went public three years later in 1996, investors plunked down about $42 a share on the belief that
the company would someday sell technology to project images onto a user’s eyeball.


Decades later, the eyeball idea has morphed into component modules for tiny projectors. And the share price
morphed to ~$2.


It stayed in that range from the summer of 2013 until recently. Then the stock suddenly streaked to ~$4. Why?


MicroVision has landed a $14.5 million component order essentially confirmed to be from Sony.


But TheStreetSweeper contends a $14.5 million order is still not going to morph MicroVision’s $469 million loss into
a profit.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 158/226


Let’s look at the issues we believe are conspiring to pummel this stock back to that familiar $2 territory and below.


*First, the bull case.


The bull thesis applauds further development efforts with Sony that began in April 2013. The technology is validated
through the March non-exclusive licensing agreement.


MicroVision began fulfilling $3.8 million in component orders for Sony near year’s end and will continue into 2015.


Bulls are lauding PicoP integration into some consumer products such as the Korean OEM Celluon, which is now
selling products. Sometime in the second half of the year, they are expecting a smartphone product.


More revenue sources are needed as indicated by 4Q14 revenue/losses of $0.7 million and $0.08 loss/share,
however. Wall Street expected $1.7 million and $0.08 loss.


Oppenheimer is estimating $20 million revenue in 2015 ($-0.04 loss). It estimates revenue dropping to $12 million in
2016 ($-0.20 loss).


Extrapolating from Oppenheimer’s estimates, it appears MicroVision might sell $9.5 million to Sony this year, but
only $8.5 million in 2016 – which doesn’t sound like a growing market.


While Northland Securities has a “buy” on MicroVision (the report was unavailable), Oppenheimer said it prefers to
remain sidelined until more revenue sources are secured.


Investors may find other viewpoints on MicroVision here.


*The entire projector market is tiny. The average sales price is declining.

CorMedix: Finishing Out Of The Money


CorMedix (CRMD) insiders are prancing in the post parade as they prepare to enter the race of a lifetime.


The apparent objective: Sell millions of shares of the New Jersey pharmaceutical company before word spreads
about CorMedix’s wacky financial underpinnings, its primary product that a doctor termed of little more benefit than a
good hand-washing, and auditors’ recently stated “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue operating.


Always out of the money, CorMedix is:


1. Registering 2.45 million shares of stock for insiders who want to sell, diluting average stockholders’ shares.
2. Ridden by an insider who has jockeyed at least six disastrous companies, including some devastated by
unexpected negative U.S. trial results.
3. Racing the same old tired horse – a U.S.-unapproved catheter lock system called Neutrolin, designed to cut
dialysis patients’ infections. Competitors' clinical trials are already underway, some completed.
4. Trading up on the misconceived notion that the company could be bought out.
“All of a sudden CorMedix became this day trader chew toy that they’re buying and moving around,” said a doctor
who also manages a fund. “But it’s just the same … company it was four months ago.”


The company did not respond to our requests for comment. But investors may check out other viewpoints on
CorMedix here.


Bull arguments are: Neutrolin’s potential in dialysis and non-dialysis markets is undervalued. Belief that a
partnership could soon develop to aid CorMedix as it approaches Phase III trials to determine efficacy and safety. A
recent distribution deal in the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia reports roughly 13,000 dialysis patients with
catheters. Also, another estimated 1.6 million intensive care unit patients with catheters.


Now, pull on your racing silks and ride along as we chase down a company that is racing at breakneck speed toward
the glue factory. This treacherous racetrack is piled high with the following red flags:


*Insiders Do A Little Horse-Trading. Guess Who’ll Lose - By More Than A Nose?


CorMedix stock has galloped to a record-setting $8 and change in the past few days and weeks. Riding on
misconceived rumors that it could be bought out, it’s continued to speed along at a decent clip, able to leap over
earnings of a lost $0.09 per share, rather than the $0.12 analysts expected.


This blatant warning of March 12 must have breezed past people’s eyes:


“Our total cash on hand as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $4,340,000, compared to approximately
$2,374,000 at December 31, 2013. Because our business to date does not generate positive operating cash flow,
we will need to raise additional capital before we exhaust our current cash resources in order to continue to
fund our research and development, as well as to fund operations generally.


Sure enough, the next day, CorMedix bent to the wishes of money-hungry insiders.


Noting, “We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares registered under this prospectus,” CorMedix
held the earnings call and filed a registration statement clearing shareholders to sell $19 million worth of
stock.


So, 75 stockholders can soon sell 2.45 million dilutive shares on the public market.


A stunning 47 have thrown up their hands and said “We’re outta here while the getting out is good.” They intend to
sell every single share.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 159/226


Selling shares were converted from warrants or notes related to loans given CorMedix. The company would receive
about $13.5 million if all warrants are exercised.


Most of these sellers paid about $3.44 to convert those into common shares that they can now do some horse
trading with – if they can find buyers.


So who can current shareholders thank for watering down their shares?


Well, check out the entire list here, beginning on page 24. It includes:


1. Biggest seller, 12-percent loan maker Galenica, casting off over 165,000 shares. Stake reduced to 1.4 percent
from 2.1.
2. Former company director Gary Gelbfish and his entities buck off ~96,000 shares, pushing ownership from 6.6
percent down to 6.5.
3. Current director and 4.1 percent owner Steven Lefkowitz left over 992,000 shares remaining, after offering over
19,000 shares.
4. Current director Matthew Duffy holds percentage steady but offers nearly 5,000 shares for sale.
*One CorMedix selling shareholder has jockeyed a string of decimated companies – one promotes
whipworm-egg cocktails.


One of CorMedix’ most notable selling shareholders grabbed a starring role in a recent article by TheStreetSweeper.


Dr. Lindsay Rosenwald, who directly and indirectly loaned ~$604,000 to CorMedix in 2009 apparently is running with
the herd, too. Altogether he’s selling more than 138,000 shares.


TheStreetSweeper first warned shareholders in July 2013 about one of biotech’s best known horse traders, Dr.
Rosenwald. We told about the curly-haired Dr. Rosenwald’s interesting alliances and his bizarre whipworm egg
therapeutic company, Coronado Biosciences (CNDO then ~$8, now ~$3).


Dr. Rosenwald co-founded and financed Interneuron, maker of an anti-obesity drug. The drug was related to the
“fen” in the “fen-phen” drug cocktail eventually beset by safety concerns that led to more than 3,000 lawsuits and
withdrawal from the U.S. market in 1997.


Other biotech companies he founded or heavily supported have also dumped investors head-first.


These include:


Avax Technologies: deregistered in March 2009, now worth under a penny.


Biocryst: once traded at $34, now $10.


Genta: poster child for toxic financial deals, U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejections and horrible clinical trials.
FDA ultimately ruled against Genta’s cancer drugs and the company lost a crucial $480 million deal with
Aventis. Genta filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy.


Neose Technologies: filed a certificate of dissolution in March 2009. Under management’s final plan, liquidating
distribution approved at $0.0121.


Ventrus Biosciences: founded and supported by Rosenwald, traded over $21 in 2011, now trading for ~$1.


Today, perhaps losing interest in CorMedix, Dr. Rosenwald and entities intend to cut back their stake to ~2.8 percent
from ~3 percent as selling shareholders.

Hydrogenics: Margin Drop, Cash-Poor, Insider Sell-Out And Enough Malfunctions to Make
Janet Jackson Swoon


Hydrogenics Corp. (HYGS) suffers an unfortunate link to Janet Jackson - sort of a “wardrobe malfunction.”


The fuel cell company is now dealing with a “parts malfunction” in which it revealed two multi-million-dollar
shipments were delayed because Hydrogenics’ supplier had built defective equipment. This mistake by the fuel cell
technology company electrified listeners almost as much as the singer’s caper.


Oddly, much as that other malfunction ignited fleeting promotion for a fading star, Hydrogenics’ malfunction may
have sparked an unexpected boost for the company, too. We’ll explain that below.


We’ll also look more closely at various big issues threatening Hydrogenics’ business:


*The reputation-damaging parts malfunction.


*Big shareholder sells off stock.


*Gross margin drops heavily.


*Backlog drops – indicating shrinkage of future potential sales - even as some analysts expect 50 percent year-over-
year growth.


*Hydrogenics execs back off from 30 percent growth projection – a figure also unlikely to materialize given backlog
numbers.

*Burning cash. Company’s shelf prospectus allows up to $100 million worth of banknotes, common stock, etc. We
expect an equity raise.


Hydrogenics did not return our requests for an interview for this article.


With a tip of the hat to some old Janet Jackson tunes, we’ll review Hydrogenics’ positives, as well as the negatives
that we believe make this stock scarier than any future outrageous attempts by Ms. Jackson to remain relevant.


*”Whoops Now,” Here’s The Bull Case


Canada-based Hydrogenics provides hydrogen fuel cells for stationary and mobile uses, and hydrogen-generating
products for industrial applications as well as for energy storage.


The bull argument includes a belief Hydrogenics can sell more products as California, Canada, European Union and
Germany develop policies to encourage alternative energy uses.


Additionally, backlogged inventory still appears significant, and bulls add this suggests the pipeline will lead to a
positive adjusted EBITDA for 2015.


The maturing and expanding order pipeline should drive more news flow, which analysts believe would be a strong
positive catalyst, pointing to growth and stability assuming hydrogen fuel cells become a more common power
source.


* “Can’t B Good,” Or Why Did Hydrogenics Have To Blow This Delivery?


The stock has zig-zagged over the past year like a pop musician drunk on fuel cell bubbly.  The stock swooned
again in December when the company updated investors with the news that delayed shipments would squash 2014
targets.


Then came the day for Hydrogenics to sing out those sour notes in the earnings call. In light of the delays, EBITDA
remained negative and the targeted $50 million revenue turned out to be just $45.5 million.


“Let me assure our investors that it was very unusual for these particular parts in question to be defective,” CEO
Daryl Wilson said early in the call on March 4.


Those parts were critical. One shipment was destined as a second energy storage system for E.ON, an important
German energy and gas customer.


Mr. Wilson said the supplier had simply provided inferior parts for this “OnSite Generation” project and another
project that he didn’t name.


E.ON’s Falkenhagen project currently uses Hydrogenics’ 2 megawatt electrolyzer. The system allows the
combination of water with excess energy from wind turbines to create hydrogen that is stored and moved into the
natural gas pipeline.


A big portion of a $5 million sale and Hydrogenics’ reputation hinged on delivering a second electrolyzer to E.ON.
This was to be installed in the Hamburg project that E.ON folks enthusiastically referred to as “the first prototype
operating in the 1MW range.”


But Hydrogenics executives indicated the company will recover from this blunder and get paid this first quarter.


We hope so. But we can’t overemphasize the significance of messing up these OnSite Generation orders.


Consider this customer concentration issue: E.ON and the other unnamed important customer are among just four
big customers that delivered 39 percent of Hydrogenics’ sales last year.  


*”You Want This,” or Darn Right We Want Good Gross Margins. Ahhh, Those Twisty Low Margins


The parts problems went hand-in-hand with another blow-up mentioned gently by analysts in the earnings call.
Gross margins fell both sequentially and the same quarter prior year. In fact, margins are by far the lowest since the
first quarter of 2013, as shown below.

Ebix: The Truth Hurts


Let’s give Ebix (Nasdaq: EBIX) a chance to prove that it has nothing to hide – no accounting fraud, no money
laundering, no intentional tax evasion – by challenging the company to a good, old-fashioned game of “Truth or
Dare.”


We’ll go ahead and present Ebix with its two options right now. When the company hosts its quarterly conference
call tomorrow morning, it can choose to answer the questions raised in this report – and provide the necessary
documentation to verify its claims – or it can dare to remain silent and encourage us to stick with our own jarring
conclusions instead.


Let’s get started. Since Ebix has grown so accustomed to fielding softball questions from the only analyst who
recommends (over even follows) its stock, the company might need a little bit of extra time to prepare.

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 161/226


Resonant Hypes Phantom Customer. Seriously?


This stock’s been jumping around like a youngster hyped up on sugar and now we’re sending Resonant Inc.,
(RESN) to the time-out chair.


And thanks to its latest press release flaunting a mystery customer, the Santa Barbara, Calif. filter company doesn’t
get to go outside for a long, long time.


Investors punished the company late last month for increased losses – and more importantly for its deficient product
not meeting the standards of its Skyworks customer – sending shares to $15.33 then tumbling back down to $9.54
the next day.


Corporal punishment ensued in the form of six law firms investigating possible securities violations and possible
breaches of fiduciary duty regarding the deficient filter design geared to help cut unwanted frequencies in mobile
devices.


Ultimately, the only thing odder than the press release Resonant launched 10 minutes after the market closed
Monday, March 9 was the reaction to it. Amid rumors that bull pieces or a leaked press release instigated buying,
shares began rocketing, approached $12.99 around 11:30 a.m. and jumped more after hours to $14.40.


Resonant’s press release simply stated it “has engaged” with an unnamed second customer for an unnamed
product.  


“The customer has not committed to use the resulting design and terms for a license have not been finalized,”
Resonant stated in the release.


Meanwhile, Resonant’s phantom customer became a topic at the ongoing Roth Conference in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
where the company is scheduled to present today, March 10.


“The way you look at these no-commitment type deals is that’s exactly what it means. No commitment. No risk,” an
analyst attending the conference said Monday.


“If Resonant came up to me and said, ‘Hey, I’m going to do a design for you for free.’ I’m like, ‘Sure, man, why the
heck not? If you want to give away stuff for free, I’m taking it,’” he added. “So I don’t understand why the market got
all excited about it.”

Anthera Pharmaceuticals: Another Cash-Poor, Bubbly Biotech About To Blow Apart


Anthera Pharmaceuticals (ANTH) investors may have forgotten its 2013 drug study scandal that set the scientific
community spinning, as well as the Nasdaq delisting that it barely dodged again last month.


Caught in the shimmering biotech bubble, Anthera continues to get rewarded by the market as surely as the
California biotech continues to destroy shareholder value. But, hey, at least detective work can uncover those deeds
in its SEC filings and elsewhere. That’s what we’re here for.


Here, investors may find other viewpoints on this company working to develop and sell products for serious
diseases associated with inflammation and autoimmune diseases.


So let’s look more closely into some issues this company faces:


(1) Caught up in the biotech bubble, which experts say may be on the verge of bursting.


(2) Burning millions and burn rate is expected to accelerate under further attempts to meet FDA approval; expect a
potentially dilutive equity raise.


(3) Material weakness issues.


(4) One analyst downgrades stock, another analyst calls stock a sell/high risk.


(5)Unusual executive enrichment despite debilitating $309 million deficit.


*Stock Price Wrapped in Glistening Biotech Bubble Ready to Burst


According to a March 6 Bloomberg article “These Investors Think There’s a Biotech Bubble That’s About to Burst,”
containing telling charts, the 269 biotech companies were primarily responsible for the Nasdaq’s gain over the last
four years.


But “the end is coming,” according to one quoted expert.


Bloomberg continued: “Now there are signs that the biotech industry’s fortunes could change. One key measure of
investor pessimism, the short interest ratio, has about doubled for the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index since 2013,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.”


Irrational exuberance infects the biotech arena. It’s really approaching the level TheStreetSweeper warned investors
about in our article in August 2013, “The ExOne Company: Irrational Exuberance Obscures Black Clouds Building
Around 3-D Printing.”

At one time, 3-D printing somehow worked its way into conversations at parties, at the local bar and grill, and around
the dinner table. People couldn’t stop talking about it. Couldn’t resist investing in it. Though it was old technology,
virtually everyone seemed convinced that 3-D was the next big thing. The talk just stopped.


ExOne (XONE) investors got hit heavily when the bubble burst and at TheStreetSweeper publication date the stock
was $69, now $14. 


And take a look at the ExOne and 3-D Systems (DDD) stock chart – and what happened during that miserable burst

Eyes Wide Open: Second Sight Medical Products Becomes Another MDB Capital Special


Second Sight Medical Products (EYES) creates a bionic eye for blind people.


It seems a cool business opportunity, at first glance, to implant electrodes in the eye to ultimately create images that
the blind see as shapes or patterns.


The market, indeed, considers Second Sight worth $559 million. This stunning valuation exists despite the fact that
the Sylmar, Calif. company made only $1.5 million in sales in all of 2013 – and it costs Second Sight close to $3 for
every $1 the company makes.  


So we took a critical look at Second Sight, the market and business plan. And we got quite an eye-full.


Here are some top reasons we believe Second Sight is fantastically overvalued and headed for a crushing reality
check:


*Big investment firms yawn. So debt-riddled company grabs MDB by arm, hits Wall Street.


*Patient acceptance issues and FDA adverse event reports arise over Second Sight’s retinal prosthesis.


*Market tiny. Scale problems enormous. Next target minimum four years out.


*Stock lockup expiring; CEO gets break on stock bought with Second Sight cash.


*Look out ahead: Unless Second Sight plans nothing, more cash needed.


Second Sight’s key retinal prosthesis has three parts: an electronic device implanted and around the eye, a tiny
video camera attached to eyeglasses, and a video processing unit the patient carries or wears.


While investors may find other viewpoints here, let’s look at the eye-popping details surrounding this company now
trading at well over 100 times sales.

Sportsman's Warehouse: Too Many Bullets to Dodge?


Sportsman’s Warehouse (Nasdaq: SPWH) looks an awful lot like a sitting duck right now. Since its largest pure-play
competitor has already shot off its mouth about the “wickedly competitive” nature of the recent holiday season ahead
of the company’s fourth-quarter report, SPWH must feel like it’s treading water with the equivalent of a neon target
on its back.


Unless SPWH somehow managed to dodge a relentless slew of bullets over the holidays, in fact, the company has
probably spent the past couple of months in serious pain. We should know for sure in a matter of weeks.


With rival Cabella’s (NYSE: CAB) slashing its prices in order to steal business away from the competition during the
crucial holiday season, however, SPWH sure looks vulnerable to a devastating miss. Just listen to some of the noisy
warning shots fired by CAB earlier this month, and imagine the fallout that SPWH likely suffered as a direct result.


“We felt like when we talked to you guys in October that it was going to be a promotional environment, and we felt
pretty good about our November and December promotional cadence. (But) as we started getting into November,
it became very clear that it sure felt like there was a lot less consumer disposable income. And retailers,
mostly outside of our space, really started cranking up offers -- to the point that some were almost
ridiculous – weeks ahead of Black Friday. We just felt like, to protect our franchise and to maybe be opportunistic
and take share, we had to jump into the fight. And what that meant was it took more discounts, as the consumer
was very promotionally minded in the quarter.”


“It was definitely a war for the customer’s dollar in November and December, (and) I don’t think we were
unique in feeling the unbelievable pressures … It was a wickedly competitive environment. (So) we used our
leadership position to get in the fight – which a lot of our competitors can’t. And that was kind of the story of
the quarter.”


“While we didn’t feel great about the earnings impact, we definitely took it to people from a share standpoint
… During the quarter, we were able to grow market share in almost all of our major merchandise
categories. We are pleased with our ability to grow share during the quarter and further pleased we have seen this
trend continue into the first quarter of 2015.”


“It’s a whole new world, with affiliate networks and mobile apps and comparison shopping engines and all of that
stuff. And I don’t think the promotional environment in the fourth quarter of THIS year – unless the economy
improves greatly – will be much less intense.”

Ballard Power Struggling In "Extremely Silly" Niche


Fuel cell maker Ballard Power Systems (BLDP) has let its best technology slip away and insists on weaving down a
long, bumpy road to nowhere on three flat tires.  


Shares popped after Ballard announced Volkswagen would pay $50 million for the proton exchange membrane fuel
cell patents that Ballard bought last April.


“That’s where the magic really happens,” a longtime clean-tech analyst told TheStreetSweeper. “And that’s what
Volkswagen bought.”


But the fuel cell manufacturer would have been wiser to ink a deal to sell its customer, VW, all the fuel cells it wants.
However, blinded by the cash infusion, the market excitedly ran up the stock by $1, though the deal was really worth
only 38 cents per share ($50m/132m shares).


Ballard’s agreement does include a $30 million VW service contract extension to 2018. Unfortunately, though, that
money will get coughed out over the years.


Besides tossing away its prime technology, other issues facing Canada-based Ballard include:


*No significant opportunity remaining.


*Expert calls fuel cell cars “extremely dumb.” Volkswagen adds, “decades away.”


*Google and Apple cars: Electric, not fuel cell, for a simple reason.


 *China prospects fold.


Though investors may read different viewpoints here, we’ll hit other issues threatening Ballard stock with a
Hindenburg-esque explosion.


*No significant opportunity left.


Some investors may be clinging to the hope that Ballard could strike a deal similar to the VW arrangement with
other car companies.


We disagree.


That’s because DaimlerChrysler, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, GM, Ford, Hyundai, and BMW already have their own fuel
cell plant in-house.


So Ballard traded its technology – which it bought last year from United Technologies Corp. - for cash. But the
arrangement has left Ballard with little more than the ability to sell fuel cells for buses.


Ballard did recently hype a possible deal for supplying fuel cell technology for 10 buses – but this is more of a very
slow, low-rev process that’s been going on for a long time with little financial impact.


*Experts, even Volkswagen, say fuel cell is decades away.

Miller Energy: Alaska Debates Cutting Vital Tax Credit Handouts


THESTREETSWEEPER QUICK HIT – Terrible, cash-eating news from Alaska threatens to drive another stake into
Miller Energy Resources (MILL).  The bleeding Knoxville, Tenn. company is already struggling beneath a recent
executive chairman’s margin call that led to panic selling, enormous debt, big earnings/revenue misses and low oil
prices.  


The last thing the company needs is a hit to its tax credit receipts.


That’s because tax credits tied to Miller’s exploration in Alaska have meant millions to the oil and gas company each
year. Miller anticipates receiving about $72 million in Alaska tax credit receipts in 2015.

Alaska issues tax credits to oil producers to encourage exploration in the state. The company applies for these
credits each quarter and frequently notes that operations depend heavily on tax credit money.


Every spare dime is coveted, as new CEO Carl Giesler told analysts in December: “From both the financial and
operational perspective the quarter was disappointing to put it mildly.”


But now it’s obvious that Alaska Gov. Bill Walker is having second thoughts about the very tax credits that keep
Miller pumping.

On Deck Capital: Loan-Shark Rates, Bad Loans, Bad Business Plan





On Deck Capital (ONDK) seems to be swimming within those murky waters populated by loan sharks. Indeed, the
online company makes loans to desperate small businesses with bad credit and charges them astronomic interest
rates.


On Deck doesn’t tout the actual annual percentage rate charged. Yet fishing deep into federal filings yields actual
APRs far above the company’s advertised rate of 18 percent to 36 percent.


In fact, filings show the company charges these desperate borrowers an annual rate as high as 99 percent.


On Deck gets away with this because interest rate laws affecting commercial loans vary from state to state.
California, for example, sets the rates at 10 percent or 5 percent above the Federal Reserve Bank rate. The
permissible limit is 9 percent in Illinois. In fact, a new report out today says payday lenders definitely face stricter
regulations, so On Deck and peers may no longer get to fly under the radar.


Successfully positioning itself as a technology play for its initial public offering on Dec. 17, On Deck’s stock spiked to
nearly $29.


So the market has slapped over $1 billion in value on a company with $354,000 net income in its pocket.


All that for a business model eerily similar to those that handed us the subprime lending crisis.

Novatel Wireless: Fundamentally Flawed Business Plan, Lockup Release Lather Up This
Soap Opera


Novatel Wireless (MIFI) rose from a virtual bodice-ripping B-grade soap opera star into a proper Wall Street darling
in three months, with shares bursting to ~$5.50 for more than a 78 percent gain.


But while Novatel has recently shed some drama (read the steamy shareholder letter here), the company remains
fundamentally flawed.


The wireless solutions technology provider primarily sells pocket-sized wireless modems to allow Internet access
anywhere and also machine-to-machine modules.


But we don’t believe this San Diego, Calif.-based company is likely to return the love investors have thrown at it
recently.


For other viewpoints on Novatel, click on this link. Read on to find out why we consider Novatel risky both now and
later.


*Why Novatel’s biggest revenue-generator is unlikely to reach expectations.


Novatel is focusing on the MiFi system - a Wifi hot spot provided through a wallet-sized box that consumers on the
go can use to access the Internet with their mobile gadgets.


“They’ve been doing that for a long time. It’s a brutal business. It’s always been brutal,” said a tech analyst who
requested anonymity. “The margins are terrible.”


In fact, the product produces less than 11 cents to a little over 20 cents for each dollar sold. The margins improved
last quarter – special thanks go to a $2.9 million inventory write-down and selling $2 million in old inventory at near
cost.


Novatel must hate having a bunch of its obsolete China-and-Thailand-made inventory sitting around. Yet it says
“increased competitive pressures” may force more of these write-downs.


With historically bad margins and declining revenue grabbing Novatel by the throat, some leaders wanted to sell the
MiFi division, according to sources.


But, of course, the spinoff didn't happen.


*No buyers for MiFi is spooky enough. But there’s more.


Then, with no other company apparently wanting MiFi, miserable share prices and a poorly settled class action
lawsuit, activist shareholders lobbed a rip-roaring fiery letter alleging Novatel had been mismanaged. The company

Fellow activist shareholder Richard Karp joined him on the board of directors.

responsible for nearly 79 percent of Novatel’s sales.


But the results have been disappointing.


Last quarter, revenue from MiFi dropped a blistering 59 percent. Yes, compared with a year ago, MiFi revenue is a

through some of the more obvious hype surrounding the company’s new “asset-light” strategy and noticed at least a
few of the overlooked realities that make its celebrated plan seem like such an unhealthy idea.


Wait until they discover the bitter ingredients that Jamba has decided to include in its half-baked recipe for success.
Before they reward Jamba with any more applause for the steps that it has taken to transform the company into a
leaner – and ultimately more profitable – smoothie chain, they better make sure that they can stomach the danger
posed by the bitter surprises listed below:


·      For starters, Jamba has effectively diluted the cost reductions that it has rushed to celebrate by quietly
recording a mountain of buried expenses that makes its reported savings look wildly overblown.


·      Jamba has also chosen to later revise those overlooked expenses for no obvious reason, taking liberties that
make the company look as if it has literally engaged in cooking its books.


·      In yet another move that seems to make little sense (unless the company simply hopes to prop up its share
price), Jamba has decided to sell more than 100 of its top-performing stores and then use the proceeds to purchase
its own stock – at a much steeper multiple of earnings – instead.


·      By “refranchising” those valuable stores, Jamba actually stands to raise far less money than wishful bulls like to
think, while sacrificing most of the generous revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) currently generated by those busy locations.


·      Even with the possible (if not likely) benefit of one-time gains from asset sales, Jamba expects its future
EBITDA to fall 30% below outdated Wall Street estimates that analysts continue to maintain in spite of the much
lower forecast presented by the company itself.


·      In a failed effort to boost customer traffic that has already led to a horrific quarterly miss – and threatens to
remain a lingering drag on its future results – Jamba has introduced lower-margin products (such as fresh juices)
that have simply cannibalized smoothie sales and obliterated its profit margins instead.


·      Finally, Jamba has spent years relying on a CFO previously employed by a pair of companies that seemed
almost cursed with bad luck -- one of them already bankrupt and the other severely wounded -- after they left her in
charge of keeping track of their own books.

TubeMogul: Why This Stock Will Go Down The Tubes


Behind the scenes, TubeMogul (TUBE) is in a world of hurt. Digital media giant Google has practically run away with
one of Tube’s biggest customers.


But this bad break – and its unfortunate future implications – has flown under the radar until now. It’s the first of three
negatives threatening to clobber Tube’s share price.


Flash back to last June. Folks in the Emeryville, Calif. headquarters buzzed with anticipation that TubeMogul had
seemingly knocked down a king-maker partnership with Mondelez International.


TubeMogul provides self-serve software that allows advertisers to plan, buy and measure the effectiveness of video
ads. Its recent customer Mondelez manufactures Oreo, Wheat Thins and various chocolates, gum and candy.


“Mondelez International's digital branding strategy has always been ahead of the curve,” Brett Wilson, TubeMogul's
CEO and co-founder said. “The way they harness the power of software to amplify their strategy is groundbreaking
and we're proud to enable that in video.”


The deal helped propel the money-losing Tube to its initial public offering last July.


Tube quickly settled into an overvalued spot on the Nasdaq. Though the IPO price got cut to $7 from the originally
proposed $11-$13, Tube shares blasted off, quickly gaining 240 percent. Shares settled recently around $16,
handing the company a valuation approaching half-a-billion dollars.


But just four months after the TubeMogul announcement, Google and Mondelez held what’s described as
contentious behind-the-scenes negotiations.

 “Google wanted Mondelez to use DoubleClick Bid Manager, Google’s demand-side buying platform, instead of
competitor TubeMogul, to execute the YouTube transactions as part of the deal, and it was using YouTube’s
TrueView pricing system as leverage, according to multiple executives directly involved in the negotiations,” Digiday,

Tekmira Pharmaceuticals: Spinning Its Next �Big Story"


Tekmira Pharmaceuticals (TKMR) may not have found its next big biotech thing, after all.


After a crazy-good run riding the Ebola scare from obscurity to prominence in just a few months, the company found
itself searching for something new to keep investors interested. Tekmira’s betting that hepatitis B will be it.


Shares of Canada-based Tekmira jumped from ~$15 to ~$24 earlier this month on news it teamed up with OnCore
BioPharma to work to develop a hepatitis B therapy.


Now, on Tekmira’s recent tepid announcement of dosing one person in its tiny 20-patient clinical trial, shares jumped
2.7% - far short of the long-gone Ebola gains of 280%-plus.


Indeed, Tekmira reminds us of another Ebola treatment-next-big-biotech-thing wannabe that TheStreetSweeper
warned investors about, iBio (then $1.88, now ~$0.52).


While other viewpoints about Tekmira are available here, let’s look at some issues surrounding Tekmira’s latest,
greatest target.


*TKMR STOCK PROMOTORS GONE WILD.


Tekmira has become a heavy favorite among stock promotors. Between March 1, 2012 and Sept. 3, 2014, sites
ranging from “Penny OTC Stocks” to “Wall Street Resources” issued reports on TKMR a total of 21 times.


On March 1, 2012, for example, with the stock drooping at $2.56 per share, five – yes, five – stock promotors sent
out positive reports about TMKR to potential investors.


It worked. TKMR fetched as much as $2.91 by the end of the day – a striking 8 percent gain.


Two years later, on March 6, 2014, a total of 10 stock promoters reported on Tekmira. Yes, 10 separate promotions
on the same day. Coincidence? We don’t think so.


With news reports on Ebola rampant and Tekmira promoters out in force, Tekmira shares rocketed from about $19
on March 4 to about $28 on March 6.

Ziopharm Oncology: 5 Potential Downsides To Its New Deal


Shares of Boston, Mass.-based Ziopharm Oncology (ZIOP) ripped some 54 percent within hours on a positive news
story this week – a story full of holes and investor risks.


The stock raced from $5.74 up to $9.50 following the announcement that ZIOP and its partner Intrexon Corp. (XON)
signed a licensing agreement with the Texas cancer center, MD Anderson.


Though the share price has fallen, the excitement handed a roughly $900 million valuation to a company with a
$362 million deficit and no product.


The deal trades licensing rights for MD Anderson’s non-approved cancer technology for $100 million worth of shares
from both ZIOP and XON. ZIOP has also committed to paying $15 million to $20 million yearly to the cancer center
for research and development for three years, though the press release is fuzzy. ZIOP must pay the first $3.75
million within two months.


Ominous details surround ZIOP’s dollar-and-dilution deal, as well as ZIOP itself. Here are the top five reasons why
TheStreetSweeper dislikes this deal and sees loads of downside ahead:


1. ZIOP doesn’t have the money to pull off this deal. So we believe ZIOP will have to sell stock, posing imminent
dilution.
ZIOP has just $46 million in cash. Its own quarterly report says that’s “sufficient to fund operations into the fourth
quarter of 2015.”


But that was before the new agreement. ZIOP is burning over $7 million per quarter. And it is now committed to pay
about half that much - $3.75 million to $4 million quarterly - to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston for three years.


2. Shares worth $15 million offered as incentive to speed contract signing.
The day ZIOP was scheduled to present to JP Morgan, Jan. 14, turns out to be the very day ZIOP pulled this
licensing announcement out of its ear. JP Morgan acted as underwriter during ZIOP’s roughly $54 million public
offering in October 2013 at $3.50 per share. But that timing may not have been mere coincidence.


The kicker: This “highly sensitive and confidential” letter to a University of Texas vice president of strategic industry
ventures describes $15 million worth of incentive shares – 1.6 million ZIOP shares and 278,218 XON shares – not

Amira Nature Foods: Hungry for Another Big Helping of Cash


So what if Amira Nature Foods (NYSE: ANFI) found some way to sweeten its guidance? The company needed to
score a few brownie points after its latest financial results proved so difficult to swallow. Now that its stock has
rebounded to more appetizing levels, the company can try to better satisfy a powerful craving of its own.


With the rest of its cash earmarked for a big-ticket processing facility that will cost a whole lot more than it can
presently afford, Amira desperately needs to raise a fresh mountain of dough pretty soon.


Before Amira returns to the capital market for the money to cure its hunger pains, however, the company better get
ready to start eating its words. Amira might want to go ahead and hold its nose. We knocked the sugar coating off
the bitter truth.


Remember the onerous $144 million debt load that Amira went public to reduce a couple of years ago? The
company sure gave up on that idea in a hurry. After using most of the proceeds from its initial public offering to
reduce its leverage, Amira soon dug itself into another deep hole and has since gone on to saddle itself with an
even more staggering $184 million debt load instead.


Or how about the lower interest rate that Amira kept insisting, quarter after quarter, that it would soon manage to
secure? Despite all of the cheap credit available to even seemingly hopeless companies, Amira never managed to
negotiate a better deal of its own, for some disturbing reason. With the interest rate on its bank debt
actually escalating in recent quarters – and the interest rate on its overdue payments to suppliers literally topping
20% -- Amira has found itself paying such a high effective interest rate that the company might as well use a credit
card to finance its day-to-day operations.

Sportsman's Warehouse: Aiming Too High for Its Own Good?


Sportsman’s Warehouse (Nasdaq: SPWH) seems almost determined to shoot itself in the foot again.


Under the gun to hit ambitious growth targets that look increasingly difficult to achieve, SPWH has tried to
overcome a persistent decline in same-store sales by rapidly building new stores on credit after following a similar
plan straight into bankruptcy. This time, SPWH faces even stiffer competition in a market hurt by plunging sales of
guns and ammunition – a business that accounts for roughly half of its revenue – too, as big-name players like
Cabela’s (NYSE: CAB) and Bass Pro Shops race to open new locations of their own. Willing to settle for the leftover
scraps that likely remain untouched for a reason, SPWH has decided to focus more heavily on smaller markets that
rival chains might understandably choose to avoid.


After all, SPWH has started hunting for new business in some rather dinky towns.


SPWH intends to open five of the eight new stores that it has pledged to build during its next fiscal year in towns
with a combined population of barely 70,000 residents.  In fact (as illustrated in the section that follows), three of
those new locations will serve entire counties that look either too small or too poor to support one of the company’s
big-box stores.


With a measly $1.7 million in its bank account and a staggering $219.3 million worth debt on its balance sheet,
SPWH obviously cannot afford to start blowing a bunch of precious cash on new stores that make little business
sense.

Freshpet: An Overvalued, Bad, Bad Dog


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Pet food company Freshpet (FRPT) jumped out with an IPO last month and shares fetched a surprising $20 the first trading
day.


Freshpet loses money as it installs and maintains refrigerators in stores to display its natural, slightly cooked dog food.


The New Jersey company released numbers late Tuesday showing its $0.14 loss exceeded analysts’ $0.12 expectations on
revenue of $22.5 million. Consequently the stock dropped, followed by a jump to about $19.


But we’ve pawed through Freshpet’s numbers and were astonished to determine how many dollars the company makes per
fridge:


About $19.57 per day.


That’s less than a $27.49 tube of Freshpet Vital.


So a company that the market says is worth over $600 million sells the daily equivalent of one meat tube per fridge.

At the core of that issue, TheStreetSweeper has dug up three overriding challenges facing this 10-year-old Secaucus, N.J.
company.


And we believe the overall challenges make this stock worth less than one-third its current price.

Radcom: Radically Misunderstood, Radically Overvalued, Part 2

software company’s negative trends and predictive chart.


Now, Part 2 highlights the top three additional supporting reasons we expect Radcom will follow that chart:


1. Hype and the misunderstood analyst expectation beat.
Shares jumped 44 percent on the report Radcom revenue rose about a million bucks last quarter to $6 million, while
earnings per share beat analysts’ expectations (10 cents actual EPS; 3 cents analyst estimate).


An analyst we spoke with speculated that the low estimate may have been due to either a lack of information about
Radcom or a desire to prep Radcom for a possible upcoming stock offering.


Indeed, it seems the sole true analyst covering the company for H.C. Wainwright put a “buy” and a $7.50 price target
on Radcom last July. But the analyst puts a “buy” rating on most stocks.


Here are examples here - a $50 price target on SILC, now ~$36 - and here - a $5 price target on FNJN, now ~$3.


And the charts below show other stock picks have gone bad, too:

Radcom: Radically Misunderstood, Radically Overvalued, Part 1


Radcom Inc. (RDCM) has turned radical, with its long-ignored stock ripping to the double-digit levels reached in
2006 and earlier.  


The Tel Aviv, Israel company switched from its money-losing hardware business about nine months ago. Investors
went mad when Radcom pulled its finances out of the red as it introduced software designed to address customer
service problems for telecom companies.


In fact, investors inflicted with Rad fever have plunked down three times more for Radcom than other industry
stocks.


But there’s trouble ahead.


Indeed, the company’s stock historically rises on hype, while it drops on insider sales and large private stock sales.
Check out the chart below showing the rise and fall of Radcom’s stock price – a chart that predicts Radcom shares
will likely collapse again in the near future.

Blue Nile: Breaking Hearts � And Share Value


Diamond seller, Blue Nile (NILE), is in the business of turning romance into cold, hard cash.


As if that isn’t tough enough, the Seattle, Wash. diamond and jewelry retailer is selling online. While the company’s
courtship of customers is getting tougher, recent creative hype has blinded investors into buying into the dream and
pushing the market cap to a stunning $400 million.


But this love story is doomed. Here are some highlights on why TheStreetSweeper believes the diamond company
will quickly lose its sparkle once again:


*Diamonds are a girl’s best friend: Cheap won’t cut it.


NILE’s engagement business is at risk partially because a woman may feel a slight wave of disappointment when
Prince Charming shows up with a diamond – and it’s from a Wal-Mart-esque online store.


NILE execs admitted during a summertime William Blair stock conference, in fact, that the biggest problem is getting
men to buy engagement rings online because there’s “a trust component and then there’s a relationship
component.”

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 169/226


CEO Harvey Kanter added, “I think that that -- the reason why growth rates haven't been sustainably high has been
that we still have to get a lot of the market to understand that.”


*NILE’s recent “test:” Weakening business model.


Mr. Kanter said NILE is now “testing” a brick-and-mortar store in Rhode Island and in Seattle. This appears to be a
test of the idea that customers may consider buying engagement diamonds online less satisfying and riskier than
seeing and touching them in a store first.


Keep in mind that the reason NILE can sell jewelry cheaper is because, as an online company, it has been able to
avoid the costs of physical buildings, utilities and sales people of traditional jewelry stores. And now it’s trying to
compete in brick-and-mortar with thousands of established jewelry stores.

Receptos: A Bloated Highflier Dumped by Insiders Nervous about the Truth?


Receptos (Nasdaq: RCPT) looks even luckier than usual right now. The bleeding biotechnology firm has racked up
such mind-blowing gains over the past few weeks, in fact, that even its own executives – who just dumped more
than $35 million worth of the company’s highflying stock – must wonder how long its good fortune can actually last.


With its stock price recently exploding into the triple digits, making the company worth a staggering $2.9 billion years
before it even hopes to seek approval of its very first drug, Receptos arguably looks priced beyond perfection at this
point.


For starters, Receptos now owes more than a third of its lofty valuation to a Phase II study that barely even
managed to achieve its primary goal. When Receptos issued a positive update about that ongoing trial a few weeks
ago – sparking a wild celebration that expanded its market value by almost $1 billion in a single day – the firm
actually provided enough underlying data to reveal that a tiny handful of patients happened to narrowly swing the
results in its own favor.


Just pull out that announcement and grab your calculator. Once you complete a few simple equations, you’re bound
to arrive at that striking conclusion yourself.


Start with the 199 patients that Receptos enrolled in its “Touchstone” trial, a Phase II study designed to test its
leading drug candidate RPC1063 as a possible treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC), and then divide those subjects
into three different groups: one for patients who received a “high” 1 milligram dose of the drug; one for patients who
received a “low” 0.5 milligram dose of the same medication; and one for those who received an inactive placebo.
Assume that Receptos made sure that its researchers distributed those subjects as evenly as possible, with 66.3
patients assigned to each arm of the trial. Now, you can estimate just how many patients actually recovered after
taking the company’s experimental drug.


Of the patients treated with RPC1063 during the eight-week induction period of that clinical trial, only 16.4% of those
who received the high dose and 13.8% of those who received the low dose – or the equivalent of 10.9 and 9.2
patients, respectively – achieved clinical remission to meet the primary endpoint of that ongoing study. Even so, the
high-dose group somehow fared well enough to hit the primary endpoint of the study by achieving “statistically
significant” positive results. In the second group, however, the recovery rate – lowered by just one or two patients –
fell short of reaching that crucial goal.


Talk about a very near miss!


Who knows if RPC1063 really sent those patients into remission, either? After all, at least some of the patients who
received nothing but a placebo actually wound up recovering on their own.


Company insiders have already struck it rich regardless. Unwilling to wait for Receptos to determine whether its
experimental UC treatment actually works or not, a crowd of senior executives recently jumped at the chance to hit a
surefire jackpot instead.


Earlier this week, nearly half-a-dozen members of the senior management team – including the CEO, the chief
medical officer, the chief scientific officer, the chief technology officer and the senior vice president of corporate
development – took part in a lucrative insider-selling spree that turned all of them into overnight multimillionaires.
The biggest winner by far, Receptos CEO Faheed Hasnain walked away with a gigantic $21.9 million windfall that
easily exceeded all of the multimillion-dollar fortunes collected by the remaining four executives combined.

Uranium Resources: No Production, Little Cash, No Good Options Left


Shares of Uranium Resources (URRE) exploded this week as Japan hit the switch on its first nuclear reactor since
the earthquake-and-tsunami fueled nuclear disaster of 2011.


The Centennial, Colo. uranium mining company idled its operations years before Japan shut down all nuke plants in
the wake of the Fukushima disaster.


Yet investors have begun grabbing URRE stock on the hope that Japan’s nuclear plans might make it worthwhile for
URRE to restart mining. Though the price is settling down, this speculation shot URRE shares up by a whopping 61
percent in a few days to close Wednesday at $2.49.


But all is not quite as optimistic as it seems.


“Uranium Resources will probably be bankrupt before that one plant starts up,” said an analyst who requested
anonymity. “It’s a really tough situation.”

Here are highlights of the gut-wrenching situation:


*Production has ceased. URRE hasn’t produced one ounce of uranium in five years.


Here’s what a URRE filing says:


“As a result of low uranium prices, we ceased production of uranium in 2009.”


“None of URI's properties are currently in production.”


*URRE would restart mining only if uranium reaches and sustains prices above the cost of restarting and
production, at least in the mid-$40 range.

PhotoMedex: Letter Alleges Faulty Equipment, Possible Cover-Up


PhotoMedex (PHMD) is poised for another shocker on top of the one sparked by its $85 million loan covenant
default just described by TheStreetSweeper.


Now the TheStreetSweeper has discovered a jolting new risk wrapped up in a “Laser-gate” letter that suggests
management knew about dangerous equipment problems and tried to quietly fix them, allegedly without notifying
federal regulators.


Best known for TV ads touting its roughly $300 no!no! hair removers that work no better than common $3 razors, the
Horsham, Pa. company’s segment under fire now is its laser business. 


TheStreetSweeper obtained a copy of a letter just sent to the FDA on Oct. 7, requesting an investigation into
PHMD’s XTRAC laser machines and what the whistleblower implies may have been a company cover-up of some
laser machines’ dangerous random firing action.

PhotoMedex: Deadline Ahead; All Options Look Ugly


PhotoMedex (PHMD), maker of no!no! hair scorchers seen on TV, quickly defaulted on covenants of an $85 million
loan. Now Wall Street has slashed the company’s value to less than the loan value as PHMD spirals toward an
ominous deadline.


On Oct. 31, the company is expected to face one of three difficult options:


1. Deal with a rewritten note.
2. Continue struggling under a new forbearance.
3. Go into foreclosure.
All options pose significant risk to investors.


“As a stock, I would not even touch it,” said analyst Hamed Khorsand of BWS Financial.


Depending on the solution lenders settle on, PHMD’s next steps would be to: Somehow drastically increase sales,
try to sell stock to wary investors, or sell assets.


“I’ve seen stories like this before where companies can’t get out of it,” Mr. Khorsand said.


“And eventually it becomes a zero.”


Already Wall Street considers the company worth about $80 million – far less than the $106 million PHMD
paid for LCA-Visionlaser vision correction clinics.


The scenario does not look good to Mr. Khorsand, who folded his long position last spring after two years of
coverage, primarily because he surmised that PHMD didn’t answer him honestly and “I don’t like management that
lies to me.”


“LCA isn’t making money and no! no! is not making money and they’re out of Japan,” where no!no! was once
distributed, said Mr. Khorsand. “So it’s too many issues.”


TheStreetSweeper warned investors that PHMD would lose distribution in Japan.


And we described other daunting risks, some directly related to product quality, including a bizarre adverse event
reported to the FDA involving one of PHMD’s laser instruments. During a surgery last year, the laser reportedly
started a fire inside the patient’s throat.  


Read about those warnings, expensive lawsuits, an insider labeled a thug and many other issues in
TheStreetSweeper’s two previous stories here and here. Investors may find other viewpoints here.


And PHMD faces even more pressure, thanks to more issues TheStreetSweeper will describe very soon in our next
article on PHMD.


PHMD did not return TheStreetSweeper’s numerous requests for comment.

Vimicro: James Bond Might Say, "A Storm's Coming" For This Spy Company


Vimicro International (VIMC), a Chinese company that makes video cameras for spying, has fallen under our
surveillance. And investors won’t like what we’ve uncovered.


Founded in 1999 in the People’s Republic of China, the company’s video processing business quickly declined and
the focus has sharpened on security video systems sold in China.


 “It’s a fairly boring hardware business,” yawned an analyst. “There are companies hundreds of times better that are
in a better position … And over time, Vimicro’s margins are going to shrink further and further.”


VIMC’s stock gyrations have been anything but boring recently.


In a year of mediocrity, the stock price screamed from a few bucks to the $10 level in a spillover from investor
interest in GoPro (GPRO) action camera and the Ferguson incident, as well as some VIMC hype. The stock is now
above the sole analyst’s price target of $10, yet analysts we’ve spoken with think the stock is worth half that.


For this company, “A storm’s coming,” as secret agent 007 James Bond said. Here’s why we’re blowing the cover on
this company that reported a $56 million net loss over the last three years:


A. Insiders racing to sell; millions more shares may be ready to zing investors.
Options for 2.3 million shares at $0.195 expired just last week. That amounts to about 20 percent of outstanding
shares.

IBIO: A Wannabe Ebola Player Infecting Buyers with False Hope


Shame on iBio (Nasdaq: IBIO) for pulling a dangerous stunt that could soon cost its shareholders a staggering
fortune. No matter how tempted IBIO might have felt to further capitalize on the Ebola scare – or how thrilled it must
be with the immediate results – the company should have known better than to hype a vague possibility so remote
that it looks downright farfetched.


Get ready for the truth to unfold and reality to exact its inevitable toll.


Let’s cut to the chase and get straight to the point. In short, IBIO has suggested that its technology might play a
serious role in the mass-production of a promising new Ebola drug that already utilizes a rival delivery system to
handle that process instead. Since IBIO has so far tested its own delivery system on just a handful of vaccines in
early-stage safety trials – and the company never even bothered to mention the word “Ebola” in its recent 92-
page 10K report – the government might feel understandably reluctant to let some manufacturer casually substitute
the firm’s experimental technology for the very platform used to engineer that vital treatment and simply hope that it
produces the same kind of results.


Last week, in fact, the head of the government-funded lab where IBIO would like to offer its services virtually ruled
out the likelihood of any changes to the existing process at all. Look at the revealing comments shared by Dr. Brett
Girior, chief executive of the health science center at Texas A&M, in the following excerpt from a recent media
report:


“’We believe there are substantial opportunities to increase the yield of ZMapp’ (the new Ebola treatment) in plants
while keeping the product the same,’ Giroir said in an interview. The compound needs to be identical to what Mapp
(the maker of the drug) has already vetted in animals, ‘or you would have to go back to the beginning for safety
testing,’ he said.”


Based upon the information that we’ve uncovered while conducting our extensive research, we feel so confident that
IBIO will play no role in the urgent mass-production of ZMapp that we dare the company to present any concrete
evidence that clearly suggests otherwise. We also strongly encourage bullish investors to present the same type of
request to IBIO or, better yet, Caliber Biotherapeutics -- the firm that IBIO likes to treat as its potential ticket to the
ZMapp production line – since they have put so much money on the line. We highly doubt that they’ll feel quite so
confident in their investment once they finish that exercise, but we invite them to share any feedback that might
prove us wrong as well.

Solazyme: It Isn't Easy (Or Profitable) Being Green


Trouble is blowing the lids off the petri dishes at Solazyme (SZYM), where the company has fruitlessly toiled for 11
years at turning sugar and algae into profit.


The San Francisco, Calif. oil-maker’s income statement and analyst estimates are already steeped in red.


It battles increasing net losses (note that, besides Sephora and other stores, SZYM also  unfortunately hitched its
wagon to badly aging JC Penney (JCP)which traded ~$30 then, ~$7 now) as SZYM produces “green” wrinkle cream
from algae.


SZYM also faces a massive string of red flags poised to smother its effort to create renewable oils and chemicals for
various markets from its sugar-fed algae.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 172/226


SZYM first pushed out some commercial oil and drilling lubricant in May from a small area at Brazil’s Moema Plant
that the townspeople call “the annex.” CEO Jonathan Wolfson understandably trumpeted the event resulting from a
joint venture with Bunge, yet warned, “We have work ahead … establishing consistent production and reliable
supply and from there we’ll turn to the ramp up process.”


But production and supply problems already appear to be damaging that ramp-up. Layoffs occurred when the annex
lurched to a temporary standstill while a cranky boiler was repaired, according to our source located near the plant
in the sugar cane heartland in Sao Palo, Brazil.


SZYM on Oct. 9 offered the sketchiest plant update, describing production of only “modest quantities” of oils,
warning:


“… downstream processes at Moema require further optimization and are not yet operating on a fully integrated
basis. This is an area of significant focus and ongoing improvement."


So this suggests the plant is not scaling up according to expectations. 


Indeed, some analysts seem nervous about SZYM’s future, with PiperJaffray leading the pack with its issued
“Underweight” rating, writing:


“… a lack of visibility into the scale-up at Moema in terms of committed contracts, timelines, and general plant
operations underscore our Underweight thesis."


The analyst also complained about “very limited visibility/obfuscation into tangible productions metrics” and added:


“High variable costs and fixed cost absorption should start to ramp quickly at Moema, against limited volumes during
the plant start-up. We believe that, ultimately, low sales volumes and high fixed costs will beget poorer than
expected economics in an effort to secure volumes."


Credit Suisse wrote more gently last week about giving SZYM a “neutral” rating and estimating a $1.66 loss per
share this year, while PiperJaffray raised the expected net loss to $1.93.


Other viewpoints on SZYM may be found here.

Accelerate Diagnostics: Mistakenly Rewarded and Now Destined to Collapse?


Accelerate Diagnostics (Nasdaq: AXDX) might need to credit a “false positive” for making its stock price look so
much healthier these days. Mistaken by some as a promising Ebola play, AXDX has skyrocketed in value over the
course of the past few weeks – its share price, up almost 70%, escalating right along with fears of that horrific virus
– even though its experimental device specifically focuses on the detection and treatment of
stubborn bacterial infections instead.


“Everyone is looking … for the Ebola plays,” one bullish investor noted on StockTwits last week. “Rumor has it
AXDX has the inside track on detection. Chart(s) don’t lie.”


They sure are subject to correction, though. You be the judge. Take a close look at the curious nature of the
incredible rally that has AXDX just staged, and see if you still believe that its highflying stock can hang onto those
inexplicable gains.





Accidental Explosion?


With no major developments on the horizon, AXDX actually spent most of September drifting steadily lower until
Ebola began to dominate the national headlines and sent traders on a breathless chase for related investment
opportunities. Down to $16.50 a share a few short weeks ago, AXDX suddenly reversed course and then proceeded
to rocket all the way past $30 a share just a few days after Ebola officially surfaced inside the United States to pose
a serious threat right here at home.


As a bleeding highflier that’s currently valued at more than $1.2 billion – the equivalent of 23,300 times its prior-year
revenue – AXDX now looks rather dangerous itself.


Indeed, based upon any reasonable measure of its performance, AXDX actually looked wildly expensive even
before it racked up those inexplicable gains. Little more than a development-stage company in spite of its lengthy
32-year history (tarnished by regulatory sanctions discussed in more detail below), AXDX has yet to even seek – let
alone secure – government approval for the “BACcel” diagnostic testing system that became its primary focus at
least a full decade ago. With little revenue and no expectations of actual profits anytime soon, AXDX has
nevertheless managed to achieve a market capitalization so generous that it literally exceeds the estimated value
that the firm once assigned to the entire market that it has long aimed to serve.


So don’t be surprised if AXDX suddenly takes a dramatic turn for the worse. With its highflying shares arguably
priced beyond perfection at current levels, the stock could easily sink for all sorts of reasons. Just think of the brutal
correction that AXDX might endure if the market simply discounted its stock to reflect the following:

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 173/226


Kim Kardashian and crew’s fading “reign of terror,” first grabbed the imagination of mainstream media less than a
year ago. It seems Ms. Kardashian’s post-baby bikini shot plastered on US Weekly’s cover sold 100,000 fewer
magazines than usual and sounded the warning that the star’s popularity is beginning to drain away quicker than
you can say, “Snap a salacious selfie!”


That’s downright depressing news … for Glu Mobile (GLUU).


The 13-year-old San Francisco, Calif. mobile game maker’s free game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood initially rocketed
the share price to the stars from $3.78   to $7.47, higher than any time since 2007. 


But most investors didn’t realize that when the company launched the game app on June 25, GLUU arrived late to
the Kardashian party. 


Ms. Kardashian’s fading stardom is just the beginning of an A-list of slipups that we believe make GLUU stock an
ugly bet:


*SLIP-UP NUMBER 1 - Kim Kardashian has taken a dramatic free-fall since the game’s debut. 


Downloads of the Kim apps have fallen, reflecting the namesake’s fading popularity. The download rank is trending
downward. Kim captured number 69 overall in iPhone download ranking in early September, as the chart below
shows. But the ranking has tumbled precipitously to number 163.

Confession Time: Miller Reveals That Its Stock Is Practically Worthless


Miller Energy Resources (NYSE: MILL) better watch its mouth. Earlier this week, the bleeding energy
firm accidentally told the truth.


Believe it or not, Miller practically admitted that it’s wildly overvalued by releasing figures that basically indicate that
its $5 stock should actually fetch less than 10% of that generous price.


Just wait until the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finds out about this news. After fielding so
many questions from the SEC about the reported value of its assets, Miller might as well go ahead assume that
regulators will probably notice some new disclosures that make the $230 million company – strapped for cash,
with less than $4 million in the bank – look virtually worthless right now.


Don’t take our word for that jarring conclusion. Feel free to double-check our math. We relied on a simple formula –
using numbers provided by Miller itself – to determine that the company is likely worth no more than a measly 45
cents a share.

Digital Ally: This Movie Has A Bad Ending


Digital Ally (DGLY) stock has soared over 386 percent amid calls for cops to wear body cameras following the
Ferguson, Mo. police officer shooting of an unarmed teenager. DGLY took advantage of an unbelievable run in the
stock for a small raise, a heady but ridiculous action in light of how short DGLY falls below the industry leaders.


We’ve seen this movie before and we know there is absolutely no justification for the stock’s crazy run from about
$3.80 in one astonishing month to today’s nearly $20.


Here are TheStreetSweeper’s top reasons we believe this DGLY movie will end badly:


1. National interest is in police body cameras, not DGLY’s old technology.
 


The old dash cameras – DGLY’s key product – are not even part of the national conversation.


"The recent emergence of body-worn cameras has already had an impact on policing, and this impact will only
increase as more agencies adopt this technology,'' said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive
Research Forum, author of a recent report on the use of police body cameras.


Yet, the in-car video recording system constitutes 90 percent of DGLY’s already falling revenue and rising operating
losses of about $1 million.  





2. Old technology = falling revenue.
DGLY’s in-car video revenue will likely continue to erode due to superior, cheaper body cameras offered by well-
known vendors such as stun-gun maker Taser International (TASR), a profitable company up 43 percent since
Ferguson to $17 plus change.


CNBC’s Jim Cramer said police wearable video will likely become the new normal and that market is owned by
Taser.  


Wearable cameras provide superior video footage that provides up-close and point-of-view, non-tamper recording
compared with in-car video.


At $399 Taser’s Axon is 10 times cheaper than DGLY’s $4,000 dash camera.

Indeed, DGLY’s old technology is clearly already feeling the pressure. Describing the company’s decline in gross
profit, its last quarterly filing said:


“However, we are experiencing increased price competition and pressure from certain of our competitors that has
led to pricing discounts on larger contract opportunities. We expect that this pricing pressure will continue as our
competitors attempt to regain market share and revive sales and that it will have some negative impact on our
efforts to improve gross margins during 2014.”

Mandalay Digital Group: An Overhyped Master of Positive Spin?





Give Mandalay Digital Group (Nasdaq: MNDL) credit for this much, at least. While the bleeding technology firm still
needs to prove itself, the company has definitely mastered the art of positive spin.


A recent penny stock that spent years constantly reinventing itself in a desperate attempt to merely survive,
Mandalay may have just pulled off its most impressive transformation yet. Suddenly worth more than $200 million –
 before clearing its first dime – Mandalay has practically doubled in value over the course of two short weeks with
the help of some tantalizing, if temporary, hype.


Just don’t expect those breathtaking gains to actually last. Consider the following:


Institutions continue to steer well clear of the wildly speculative stock, with gullible retail investors
loading up on the pricey shares instead.
A major investor, well aware of the bullish hype reflected in the expensive shares, has chosen to dump
a mountain of the stock in recent weeks.
Mandalay has yet to provide any major details about the celebrated deal that sparked its powerful
rally, allowing the hype to build -- and further bolster its handsome gains – ahead of a looming update.
With its stock rocketing to a multi-year high, Mandalay seems very tempted to carry out another
dilutive secondary offering after practically doubling its share count over the course of the past year.
Given all of the cash that Mandalay spends to finance its bleeding operations, the company sure
could use some extra money to cover its future expenses, too.


Worth barely $3 a share ahead of its latest quarterly miss, Mandalay has since rocketed to a multi-year high of $6 a
share after announcing a celebrated deal with Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and delaying the release of crucial details while
the ensuing hype sent its stock on a powerful tear. With Mandalay encouraging investors to hope for the best, they
have responded by allowing their imaginations to literally run wild. Clearly sold on the stock and expecting it to gain
even further ground, one bullish hedge fund manager recently stepped forward to ridicule the so-called “moron” who
chose to slash his massive position in the company despite exciting news of the celebrated Verizon deal.


“Who the hell is selling at these prices in light of this news?” the hedge fund manager recently demanded before
declaring, “Why should we care?


“Worrying about who is selling or how much more is coming for sale is extremely short-sighted when we know we
have a deal in hand that completely changes everything. (So) waiting for the ‘cleanup’ trade is rather pointless,
given where it should be trading when the world wakes up to what is occurring …


“The size and the scope of the VZ announcement is almost too big to fathom. But make no mistake: It is huge.”


Really? How do you know? So far, even Mandalay itself has yet to determine – or at least divulge -- the true value of
that mysterious deal.


You’re probably right about one thing, however. The identity of the recent seller doesn’t really matter. Ask yourself a
far more relevant question: Why did that big Mandalay shareholder chose to dump all of that stock instead of holding
out for even sweeter gains or – better yet – buying some more of the highflying shares?


Let’s go back to the conference call that sparked this incredible rally in the first place and search for some possible
hints. An expert at translating overblown hype, TheStreetSweeper has carefully read between the lines to uncover
plenty of revealing clues.

FuelCell Energy: Will The Plug Be Pulled On This Overvalued Company?


If only we lived in that magical world where we could scrape up leftovers from Sunday dinner, plop them into a
device, add a dollop of fat and presto – the air conditioner churns on uninterrupted. And no messy rendering
required between steps.


In that world, FuelCell Energy (FCEL) might also become profitable. Or at least its stock price would rise and fall
based on FCEL itself, rather than the misconceived mirroring of Plug Power. Most of all, FCEL would not be poised
to lose its biggest customer.


But this is the real world. And it’s inconceivable to TheStreetSweeper how a company with multiple issues plus an
accumulated deficit exceeding $797 million could be worth anything approaching $1 billion.


“Anytime you’re a single-dollar or two-dollar stock, there’s a reason you’re a single-dollar or two-dollar stock,” said
Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management. “They announced they’re cutting costs. Well cutting costs is
not what you always want to hear – especially when it’s a new concept company that doesn’t have mass scale at
this point.”

The stock has a lot of people spooked. During “Lighting Round” Tuesday on CNBC, analyst Jim Cramer said this
about FCEL:


“Ahhh, Fuelcell! I mean, you know, these are just total rank speculation stories. I can’t go there,” Cramer said.


“I’ve got a lot of solid companies that have really good fundamentals that are inexpensive,” he added. “I’m not going
FuelCell.”


Indeed, this is a company that is:


1. Poised to lose its biggest customer.
2. Riding high on a misconceived notion.
3. Selling stock. And we wouldn’t be surprised to see more.
4. Can’t seem to scale.
5. Losing money faster than you can say, “Fool cells.”
6. Sporting a completely unjustified market cap.
We see stubborn challenges for the Danbury, Conn.-based company that makes and sells fuel cells that generate
electricity.

Synthesis Energy Systems: Running Out Of Gas


Synthesis Energy Systems (SYMX) is trying to hit the gas but the coal gasification company’s problems keep
slamming on the brakes. TheStreetSweeper believes its many issues will continue to build into a swerving, stop-
and-go ride sure to leave investors screaming to get off.


Key aspects of the Houston company and the coal gasification business have convinced us that the worst is not yet
behind SYMX or those brave souls still holding onto the stock.


It’s been just eight months since SYMX restarted its plant in China after a long, painful 2-year shutdown that left
SYMX’s market cap practically sitting on empty. Finally able to sell the product, the company’s stock price revved
back up to reasonable levels before taking a recent, brief U-turn on some big trades and rumors that the co-founder
and chief commercial officer has grabbed his truck-load of shares and taken the nearest exit. The stock price,
however, is now recovering.


But the stock value likely will once again hit the skids because we believe SYMX will soon have to shut down its ZZ
plant again.


The company offered a rebuttal by email through spokeswoman Susan Roush.


“As for your query about current methanol prices, when commodity prices are lower such as they are now, the plants
are able to operate in different modes and continue to generate revenues,” she said.


While TheStreetSweeper believes it could operate in different modes, we do not believe it could generate any
significant revenues by doing so - especially considering its track record.  A company filing says this:


“The Supplementary Agreement also provides that, to the extent Hai Hua has an unscheduled shutdown, and the
plant continues to operate on standby during such period, Hai Hua is still required to pay the energy fee to the ZZ
Joint Venture.”


So the plant would be operating and, under that scenario, the revenue could be expected to be the undoubtedly
insignificant fee.


The “clean coal” company sells its coal-based syngas technology and equipment to its partner in China. Zao
Zhuang, or ZZ, uses the syngas with coke oven gas to produce methanol, which is used to produce more complex
chemicals or blended with gasoline for motor fuel. Naturally, ZZ wants as high a price as possible from its methanol.
And a high price is necessary because operating expenses are so high.


Now, methanol prices are hovering around a 2-year low, threatening to once again shutter the plant. SYMX stands
to face not quite the revenue drop to zero that it suffered last shutdown, but a significant sales decline all the same.

Sphere 3D: A Ticking Time Bomb Set to Self-Destruct?


* Editor's Note: The following article is the latest of four investigative reports that TheStreetSweeper has
published on Sphere 3D, as it continues to move forward with its ongoing investigation of the company.
TheStreetSweeper plans to share any major, new discoveries that it uncovers during the course of the
research process.


Sphere 3D (Nasdaq: ANY; TSXV: ANY.V) can thank a former regulatory target with a lousy trading record for much
of the buying pressure that has allowed its highflying stock to resist the pesky forces of gravity.


With Sphere 3D ranking as a standout performer in the miserable portfolio that determines the size of his annual
bonus, Pinetree Capital CEO Sheldon Inwentash has repeatedly stepped forward to bolster the value of that risky
investment by purchasing much of the stock that others have understandably chosen to sell. Just go back a few
weeks ago for a particularly striking example. When TheStreetSweeper published the latest in a string of disturbing
reports on Sphere 3D earlier this month, Inwentash responded by purchasing so much stock that he literally wound

up buying more than half of all the shares that changed hands on the open market that day. (The next section of this
report presents a full account of those trades in graphic detail.)


A former penny stock that barely topped the 50-cent mark as recently as last summer, Sphere 3D rocketed all the
way to a record-breaking high above $11 a share with the help of that powerful buying spree.


Sphere 3D better hope that it fares a whole lot better than most of the other stocks that Inwentash has purchased
after Pinetree blew millions on their ill-fated shares, however. Just look at the dismal performance of the investments
that cost Pinetree the most. Even with Inwentash splurging on all of those stocks himself – often at prices well above
those fetched on the open market today – most of them still trade in the low end of their 52-week range.

Advanced Emissions Solutions (ADES): Clean-up Solutions Company Faces Its Biggest Mess
Ever - Itself


Investing in Advanced Emissions Solutions (ADES) is a little like buying land in Florida, sight unseen.


It looks incredibly gorgeous, “green” and tempting at first. Yet after digging deeper, you discover you’ve bought
swampland infested with alligators flashing toothy grins. That’s what TheStreetSweeper found in this Highlands
Ranch, Colo. holding company specializing in clean solutions for coal-fired power plants.


A superficial look shows its stock price flying near $23, not very far below its $29 record, as the company peels out
optimistic press releases on a plant lease deal and a new finance committee.


But with deeper inspection, ADES’ alligators look awfully ugly and hungry. The company stands knee-deep in class
action lawsuits alleging securities law violations and “false and/or misleading” statements tied to financial reports
that must be restated – and a NASDAQ delisting threat that ADES can’t seem to shake.


Unfortunately, ADES very efforts to try to clean up three quarters – and likely more - of unreliable, consequently
misleading financial statements are already snake-bitten.





ADES has hand-picked a rogues’ gallery of handsome men to fix its financial mess and restore investors’
confidence. We’re calling it a rogues’ gallery because this line-up, includes:





*Directors of companies wallowing in the risky penny stock world.


*Co-founders and former top executives of an emotion-charged company tottering just this side of crash and burn.


*Leaders who suddenly ran out on a company where delinquent financials almost killed its NASDAQ listing.


*Audit team members who oversaw ADES’ messy financials to begin with.


Yet these are some of the very people ADES selected to fix its financial reports. We’ll explain the details later in this
report.


An ADES representative, who is traveling, plans to interview with TheStreetSweeper so we can write a follow-up.


Investors may find various viewpoints on ADES here.


Let’s take a closer look at issues that make the ADES denizen-infested swampland look so treacherous to today’s
investors:

Sphere 3D: Rewarded for a Shotgun Wedding That's Doomed to Backfire?


Maybe Sphere 3D (TSXV: ANY.V) finds some way to look busy if it actually expects company. The bleeding
technology firm seemed almost lifeless when TheStreetSweeper paid a surprise visit to its Canadian
headquarters on a recent weekday, however, arriving fairly late in the morning to find the executive suite empty and
just a tiny handful of underlings inside the entire facility.


To be sure, Sphere 3D looked nothing like a $250 million corporation that had just offered a fortune to merge with a
far more established – but increasingly desperate – company by using its highflying stock as valuable currency.


With little (if any) sign of activity two hours into a regular workday, Sphere 3D barely even seemed open for business
at all. The poor receptionist who actually bothered to report for duty on time must have felt understandably bored.  


No telephone calls to answer from patient customers eagerly awaiting the overdue Glassware 2.0 “virtualization”
platform that Sphere 3D has trumpeted as a revolutionary breakthrough – set to take the challenging market by
storm -- for years. No meetings to orchestrate with important clients seeking to order the V3 storage solution that
Sphere 3D inherited from a dinky firm accused of blatantly stealing its assets before it officially changed hands. No
appointments to keep with hopeful investors willing to place risky bets on Sphere 3D, either, especially now that the
bleeding rollup company trades at a staggering 250 times its prior-year pro forma sales.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 177/226


Nothing but a nosy reporter from TheStreetSweeper marveling at the outdated technology that Sphere 3D had
chosen to prominently display in its front office – a collection of old-fashioned calculators, a leftover Sony Walkman,
an early version of the Blackberry that looked downright “modern” in comparison to the rest – since the
company has yet to make a name for itself by launching a proven commercial product of its own.

TechTarget: Google's Panda Crushes Visibility





TechTarget (TTGT) has peered into the gaping jaws of death.


And those jaws belong to … a Panda.


Not China’s bamboo-chomping bear. Rather, it was Google’s Panda update designed to snuff out low quality content
from Google’s top search results pages.


Many companies have suffered crushing declines in Google impressions caused by last month’s Panda update –
and corresponding losses in stock value.


Now, TheStreetSweeper has found an overlooked Panda victim - TTGT.


Shares of the Newton, Mass. company – which is focused on drawing traffic to generate IT leads - hit this year’s
high of $8.46 on June 10.


However, the market was unaware that weeks earlier the company lost more than 33 percent in search visibility,
according to a list of losers and winners.


With TTGT’s significant decline in SEO visibility – which happened around the same time of a 5-million-share
secondary offering - we think the market has missed a crucial factor.


We believe the stock faces much more significant consequences than the 28 percent stock value slashing endured
by a peer company caught by Panda.


In a statement released to TheStreetSweeper, TTGT said organic traffic remains ahead of last year.


“Our experience with the recent Google algorithm changes is consistent with what we’ve seen on previous
algorithm changes over the almost 15 years that we have been in business. We operate over 100 websites,
and in the immediate aftermath of a algorithm change we see some sites traffic increase and others
decline.”


“On a broader point – our experience is that there is an enormous amount of fluctuation after a major
Google algorithm change.”


TTGT went on to say that the company has adapted to the changes and established a successful track
record in terms of how the changes play out.


If so, we’re not sure why insiders have been selling. Regardless, investors may find various viewpoints on
TTGT here.


WHAT HAPPENED TO IMPRESSIONS?


Jealously guarding its top search market share, Google began using code-named Panda in 2011 to filter out poor
content so that higher quality content would rise in search rankings.    


Google’s leader of the Webspam team, Matt Cutts, tweeted the launch of the Panda update on May 20. Within days,
many websites watched as the dreaded drop in organic rankings turned into reality.


Digital coupon marketer RetailMeNot (SALE) fell victim to Panda’s 4.0 wallop, according to Searchmetrics. SALE
suffered a huge loss in its Google impressions and, within days, a record decline in stock.


SALE plummeted more than $8 – 28 percent – in just a few days. About three weeks later, SALE still has not been
able to climb back to its old highflying $30 level.

Bio-Reference: A Scary Review of Its Own Genetic Test





No wonder Bio-Reference Laboratories (Nasdaq: BRLI) has found itself waiting months for health insurers to
review – and, in many cases, ultimately reject – big-ticket claims for its lucrative specialty tests.


Take a look at InheriGen, the flagship panel sold by the company’s booming genetics division, for a rather obvious
clue. A $3,600 screening tool packed with tests for all sorts of wildly obscure inherited disorders – far exceeding the
handful recommended for the sound practice of medicine – InheriGen literally costs so much that it can easily
double, if not triple, the normal cost for comprehensive prenatal care. Even GenPap, the notoriously elaborate -- and
expensive -- panel aggressively marketed by the company’s gigantic women’s health division – looks somewhat
modest in comparison, despite all of the controversy surrounding that glorified Pap smear.


“The reason why Bio-Reference can get away with this,” explained one of several former sales representative who
volunteered similar stories, “is because the company trains you to routinely say, ‘There is no risk to the doctor or the

patient. If the insurance company doesn’t pay, we’ll reduce the bill.’


“Some reps would receive up to 15 calls a day from patients upset about getting stuck with a $2,000 bill for GenPap,
when they just wanted a regular Pap smear. We dealt with complaints like that every day. It was our job to take
those calls and reduce the bill to $195 (a price resembling those charged for more traditional Pap smears.) If a
patient sounded really angry – and we felt worried that they might report us – we could zero out the entire balance
…


“Then Bio-Reference would just write it off. They wrote off a lot of business when I was there.”  


That sort of business strikes many doctors -- including a prominent member of the National Physicians Alliance -- as
a pointless, if not dangerous, waste of precious resources in the first place. Even before former NPA president Dr.
Cheryl Bettigole learned that Bio-Reference commands thousands of dollars for its popular Inherigen and GenPap
tests, she felt compelled to sound a loud alarm in The New England Journal of Medicine about expensive
screening tools that look almost cheap in comparison. So Dr. Bettigole likely meant business when she responded
to that jarring discovery with plans to approach NPA policymakers about taking a public stand against the even
pricier screening panels that Bio-Reference has successfully pitched to so many oblivious physicians as
phenomenal deals.


“It’s demonically brilliant,” Dr. Bettigole bluntly declared upon hearing the crafty sales pitch relayed
to TheStreetSweeper by former Bio-Reference insiders once forced to use that deceptive marketing strategy
themselves. “I would like to send information about these tests to our policy committee. This is exactly the kind of
issue that the NPA looks at …


“We have an OB/GYN (obstetrician/gynecologist) on our committee,” Dr. Bettigole further volunteered. “ACOG, the
American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology, is wonderfully productive,” too.


Talk about a possible disaster.


As a lab that depends heavily (if not entirely) on brisk sales of big-ticket screening panels to fuel its outsized growth,
Bio-Reference can hardly afford for an influential medical society to publicly denounce the flagship panels marketed
by the very specialty divisions responsible for so much of its remarkable success. With health insurers already
intensifying their scrutiny of its lucrative specialty tests, a trend vividly illustrated by the recent surge in its days sales
outstanding (DSOs) and its bad-debt expense, Bio-Reference better hope that it can avoid pesky interference from
powerful – and increasingly cost-conscious – medical societies that often play a vital role in shaping coverage
decisions.

Sphere 3D Merger Threatens to Eat Companies Alive


Overland Storage knows a zombie when it sees one. The irony is that the one it sees at the moment is Sphere 3D
(ANY.V), the very company that is buying Overland (OVRL).


The two unprofitable companies last week announced an all-stock deal worth over $80 million that within the next
four months would hand Overland assets to its current partner, Sphere 3D. Canada-based technology company
Sphere 3D trades on the Canadian exchange as “ANY.V” and over-the-counter as “SPIHF.”


Overland considers Sphere 3D in such horrible shape and of so little promise, it acknowledged in its Securities and
Exchange Commission filings that ANY.V is entirely capable of pulling down wounded Overland.


Here are a couple highlights straight out of California-based Overland’s 10-Q, filed the same day ANY.V made an
astounding offer - a 53 percent premium (~$4.40 offered for shares that closed at $2.90) to buy out Overland:


* “Sphere 3D may not be able to achieve or maintain revenues or profitability”


* “Limited trading of Sphere 3D’s stock on the TSX Venture Exchange”


Overland crammed its filings with shockers guaranteed to worry any investors who might assume ANY.V has found
a wealthy sugar daddy to revive the company (though the merger depends partially on ANY.V setting up “bought
deal” financing in order to loan Overland $5 million.) These shockers include:


*Overland has $2.4 million cash and about $4.9 million in short term investment – and got $1.7 million cash from its
acquisition of Tandberg four months ago.


*Though revenue reached $20.2 million, recurring losses and negative cash flows “raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern.”


*Net loss to Overland shareholders is 44 cents. (Net loss of ANY.V shareholders is 4 cents.)


Under the terms of the merger, ANY.V will issue 9.4 million shares on closing, expected sometime between July 1
and September 30.


At recent prices, the terms would spike ANY.V’s market cap from about $190 million to an even more outlandish
$270 million.


So that’s $270 million for a Canadian overhyped, over-the-counter zombie company propped up by a suffering San
Diego misfit.

Sphere 3D: Cloud Company Can�t Rise Above Hype, Mistakes And Poor Management





From its rocky beginnings as a fake mining company to its absurd overpayment for a little two-man shop, Sphere 3D
Corp. (ANY.V) has signaled the true meaning of the “D” in its name: “Deep six” this stock before it’s too late.


The Canadian technology company has gone screaming into the stratosphere. The stock smashed new 52-week
highs five times in three months and is trading on the TSXV Canadian exchange as “ANY.V.” Now at around $9, the
stock is also listed on the alternative trading system OTCQB as “SPIHF.”


But research by TheStreetSweeper indicates all the screaming will soon be done by ANY.V investors pushing and
shoving and galloping for the exits.


What’s behind all the recent excitement surrounding the stock of a company that reported zero revenue last year? 
Blatant, baseless promotions by a company desperate to get listed on the NASDAQ’s subsidiary OMX. Additionally,
retail investors anticipate that ANY.V’s earnings report later this month might finally show some commercial revenue
for its emulation and virtualization product. The patent-pending technology is designed to make applications run on
a cell phone, iPad or other device as easily as they run on a person’s computer at home or work.


But disaster lurks. And here’s how TheStreetSweeper sees it breaking out:


Hype at its best. Bought-and-paid-for promotions artificially kick the stock price over the moon.
Currently no real commercial product.
No organic sales. ANY.V pays dearly to claim an acquisition’s puny sales as its own.
Looming options and warrants poised to hit the market.
Large salaries for inexperienced execs, little money, big cash burn with a need to burn multi-millions more. We
believe it’s all too clear - dilution is imminent.
ANY.V has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment.


SUPREME HYPE


ANY.V proudly links to not one - not two - not six - but nine articles in How to Find Big Stocks. These promos of
ANY.V seem just a little like the kind of material sent out by Jonathon Lebed, a stock promoter and newsletter writer
noted for his youthful brush with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and his disclosure urging people
never to trade on his advice unless they’re prepared to lose the entire investment.


In fact, ANY.V is so desperate for attention, the company has taken on its own promoter. That hired gun is USA
Investor Link, pulling in $10,000 monthly plus about $2.8 million in stock options.


CEO Peter Tassiopoulos issued a statement in March 2013 about hiring USA Investor Link to address the
“increased interest we are receiving from the investment and business community.”


Let’s just take a look at USA Investor’s previous clients… Whoa – maybe ANY.V should have done some due
diligence before peeling off investors’ hard-earned dollars to pay the two-man USA Investor Link.


Almost exactly a year before ANY.V’s announcement about its USA Investor deal, Canada-based NWM Mining
Corp. (NWMMF) issued its own statement about hiring USA Investor “due to a significant increase in the level of
interest from the U.S. Investment community …” If anyone’s interested now, a share of NWM Mining costs just a
fraction of a penny.

Amyris: Onerous Deals, SEC Filings And Extreme Insider Selling Rough Up This Biotech


Amyris Inc. (NasdaqGS: AMRS) has fallen victim to loan sharks wearing black hoodies, steel-toed boots and
perfectly wicked sneers, its SEC filings suggest.


Now the California biotech’s new filings show it’s gotten stuck with a $25 million debt financing deal spiked with –
don’t you love the word - “covenants” so draconian they’ll set your hair on fire.


Don’t take TheStreetSweeper’s word for it. Take the words from the company’s recent filing with the US Securities
and Exchange Commission.  With that costly loan deal and others in its frayed coat pocket, poor AMRS is in such a
fix it may:


“…need to issue …  discounted equity, agree to onerous covenants …”


Now, AMRS may be in an even worse fix as the company approaches its quarterly earnings call scheduled for
Thursday, May 8. The company has reported worse earnings numbers over each of the past five quarters than those
anticipated by analysts – and those experts expected earnings losses as bad as 29-to-45 cents. Analysts this
quarter expect a loss of about 28 cents per share.


Insiders and others may feel their trigger finger quivering right now. AMRS is trading at about $3.35 per share yet
there are options as cheap as $2.15. With 76.4 million shares outstanding, an astonishing 54.7 million shares could
potentially hit the market.


“The upside of any equity investor would be severely limited by these options,” said an analyst who requested
anonymity.


Despite all this – plus the fact that the CEO himself has eagerly sold off some $8.9 million worth of AMRS shares
and evidently has remained equally busy counting proceeds from his days as prior director of a dying biofuels
company – AMRS chief executive John Melo recently asserted that the company has quite the 2014 business plan.

Shock therapy: Cyberonics link to deaths and injuries





Judy Bowling could easily complete the night shift at a New York medical clinic, drive the 20-mile commute back
home, yank off her favorite green scrubs and grab a few hours of sleep. After school, the single mom and her young
daughter would often jump in the car so the child could spend the night with Ms. Bowling’s parents, giving the two
some cherished “girl time” during the drive.  


But life changed radically after Ms. Bowling had a “VNS” device by Cyberonics (Nasdaq: CYBX) implanted inches
above her heart to try to control her epileptic seizures with tiny electric shocks transmitted to the brain.


She is one of thousands of patients who have been implanted with the device that Dr. Peter Barglow terms,
“completely worthless.”


“I’d never dream of subjecting anyone to that sort of nonsense,” said Dr. Barglow, an MD with more than five
decades in the psychiatry field, now handling a busy practice in Berkeley, Calif. After extensive examination of the
issue and VNS studies, he said he considers any association with VNS irrational.


In Ms. Bowling’s case, the seizures became worse, and she quickly spiraled downward both physically and mentally.


Ms. Bowling’s experience is one of more than 9,000 Cyberonics-linked injury reports submitted to the US Food and
Drug Administration from 1998 to this month.


In fact, more than 1,980 Cyberonics-linked death reports were uncovered in our investigation.


These “adverse events” resulted from the device made and touted by a company staggering beneath two extensive
FDA warning letters and targeted by a US Senate investigation into effectiveness and safety concerns. And the
heat’s still on as this company faces a false claims lawsuit that we believe has ample potential to move forward.

Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT): Wave Goodbye To This Wave Power Company


Ocean Power Technologies (Nasdaq: OPTT) might blow its rivals out of the water – if only it could deliver projects
like it delivers regurgitated news.


OPTT stock was swimming with the bottom feeders when the company announced a multimillion-dollar Australian
deal in January with the following deceptive headline:


“Ocean Power Technologies Announces Funding Agreement With Australian Government For A$66.5 Million Grant”


Bam! Shares jumped with the announcement by 52.9 percent in premarket trading to $3.38.


But here’s the deal: OPTT had already announced the grant - five years ago. Here is that headline:


“Ocean Power Technologies Wins Funding From The Australian Federal Government”


The January press release actually announced Aussie funding from the original grant would be available for phase
one and two, plus OPTT would now have to meet more milestones. So this carefully crafted news release isn’t really
surprising, positive news at all. The market - eager for a hint of good news - took off and ran with it.


“Fool the investors” works this week, too


Buoyed by previous misleading regurgitated announcements, OPTT tried it again Tuesday.


This time, the regurgitated gem reads:


Ocean Power Technologies Announces Victorian Wave Partners Has Received A$5 Million Initial Grant Funding
From Australian Renewable Energy Agency


Many people mistook the announcement to mean that OPTT was getting a fresh batch of funding. The sound of the
Australia project apparently finally running toward its power-wave goal - combined with the sound of investors
pushing the “buy” function - was truly deafening. 


The stock price exploded almost 9 percent to $4.06.


What was wrong with this announcement? First, the $4.6 million (US dollars) grant was already assumed because
execs in March said, Australia, with conditions attached, would fund part of the first phase.


This is not new. And it is not new funding. In fact, the release states that grant revenue will be accounted for later,
indicating OPTT doesn’t dare count it now because the company is unlikely to come up with the required matching
money.

Second, the misleading headline ignores the real news that OPTT is legally required to disclose in its 8-K, US
Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That real news is that the Oregon project is officially Dead Sea debris.





The US Department of Energy has terminated the remaining teeny, single-buoy contract with OPTT because the
company couldn’t come up with enough money.





Key wording in the new SEC filing is: “The Company and the DOE are discussing the steps necessary to close out
the project.”





OPTT’s bad habit of regurgitating “news” is just another surface wave in a growing tsunami of issues surrounding
the company that has been trying since 1994 to turn electricity-generating ocean wave power into a real business.

MiMedx (MDXG): Not What The Doctor Ordered


Human placenta products peddler MiMedx (Nasdaq: MDXG) is handing out company stock like candy to doctors
who “evaluate technologies” or act as consultants, TheStreetSweeper has learned.


One doctor got tens of thousands of shares of common stock without paying one single dime. Another prominent
doctor on the company’s medical advisory board received options on 200,000 shares.


The company has doled out roughly 1.2 million shares of stock and options to its influential doctor friends – shares
now worth more than $7 million – as its chief executive, Parker Petit, prepares to go on trial perhaps as early as next
month for an alleged insider trading scheme.


Despite that, the company stock price is screaming, shoving the market cap into the stratosphere. The company is
now valued at about $740 million, much higher than the entire “skin substitution” market estimated at $500 million.


Paid to do what?


MiMedx uses doctors in speaking bureaus, consulting and research. But filings also say doctors educate others
about “the efficacy and uses of our products.” MiMedx’s business turns mothers’ placental membranes into “EpiFix”
material used to cover injuries such as burns and diabetic foot sores, as well as “AmnioFix” for internal coverage
uses such as spinal surgery and tennis elbow.


The company’s filings – pages 14 and 15 – describe some doctors’ duties this way:


“… speaking to payers about our products in support of our reimbursement efforts.”


The company also works with doctors “who may order our products or make decisions to use them,” according to
this filing.


TheStreetSweeper asked the company for more details about the medical advisory board, including whether
MiMedx encourages doctors to use their products. We got some answers back by email.


“Our selection of advisory board members is unrelated to their use of our products,” said the company’s lawyer,
Roberta McCaw.


MiMedx uses doctors to help deliver exciting business deals while it tiptoes past kickback and false claims laws,
suggests page 28 of this filing. But news reports show even big pharma sometimes fall down the slippery slope into
an embarrassing, expensive legal hole that MiMedx could ill afford.


Just last November, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a $2.2 billion deal to settle government charges on false
marketing claims and paying kickbacks to doctors.


Doctors get cheap stock


For investors, there’s also a personal piece to the problems inherent in MiMedx’s fraud lawsuit-saddled chief
executive’s use of the medical advisory board.


Unlike the average investor, some lucky doctors have had the option to buy their stock for mere pennies-on-the-
dollar. These doctors also get paid on a services rendered basis, though the company lawyer wouldn’t give details.

Will MiMedx and Its Hotshot CEO Both Go Down in Flames?


MiMedx (Nasdaq: MDXG) better hope that its precious leader can work the same kind of magic on the federal judge
who will soon decide his fate as he has on the dazzled shareholders who have placed so much faith in his word.


With its treasured CEO Parker “Pete” Petit set to face trial on insider-trading charges as early as next month – and
its shareholders largely oblivious to both the proximity of that courtroom battle and the gravity of its final outcome –
MiMedx desperately needs that looming verdict to favor its popular chief and spare its highflying stock from the

trauma of his stunning exile. After all, as graphically illustrated by the horrific 70% loss that it suffered back in
September, MiMedx paid a staggering price the last time that the market felt blindsided by a major regulatory scare.
Now that MiMedx has fully recovered from that nasty wound to reach even loftier highs – achieving a generous $740
million market value that literally eclipses the $500 million value recently assigned to the entire “skin substitute”
market that the bleeding firm serves – the company sure would hate to plunge yet again on an overlooked danger
capable of erupting into bombshell headlines like these: 


“SEC COMES OUT SWINGING IN HIGH-STAKES TRIAL AGAINST MIMEDX CHIEF”


“HIS CAREER ON THE LINE, CEO STRUGGLES TO EXPLAIN SUSPICIOUS TRADES”


“REGULATORS PREVAIL AFTER PURSUING VETERAN EXECUTIVE FOR YEARS”


“HIT WITH OFFICER/DIRECTOR BAN, TURNAROUND CEO FORCED TO RETIRE”


“MIMEDX FALLS FROM LOFTY HIGHS AFTER POPULAR CHIEF FALLS FROM GRACE”


To be sure, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission seems bent on a victory that would make those jarring
headlines come true. Convinced that Petit tipped off a friend about the imminent buyout of the last public company
that he ran, the SEC filed charges against the veteran corporate executive back in early 2012 and – after
soundly defeating his motion to dismiss the charges that he actually bothered to challenge – looks fully prepared to
move forward with a high-stakes trial that could literally end his entire career.


In a vivid display of its stubborn determination, the SEC has invested years in a case against Petit based upon
suspicions raised by a pair of trades that date all the way back to 2007 and involve a relatively modest windfall that
never personally benefited the seasoned executive at all. Still, the SEC highly doubts that his longtime friend simply
lucked out by gambling half of his net worth on Matria Healthcare (the company that Petit led at the time) ahead of a
generous buyout offer to score an easy $94,000 jackpot as a total novice playing the market for the very first time.
Seeking to nail the veteran officer for that suspected leak and prevent him from committing any future offenses, the
SEC has proposed a severe punishment that – by stripping Petit of the right to serve as an officer or director of any
publicly traded company – threatens to drive the popular MiMedx leader right out of the executive suite.


MiMedx did not respond to requests from TheStreetSweeper seeking input from the company ahead of this story.
The stock sure took a curious hit, suddenly falling on a notable surge in trading volume,
after TheStreetSweeper alerted the company about the article, though.

Amyris (AMRS): Why These Sweet Dreams Should Keep Investors Up At Night





Tucked within the wide, green hills in eastern Brazil, a little factory churns out a fragrant oil that nourishes the hopes
and dreams of Amyris Corp. (AMRS) investors.


One day, the dream goes, people might splash their wrists with perfume made from it. They might slather their faces
with it, drive to work on tires made of it and even take off in a jet fueled by this stuff made by engineered bugs – or
microbs.


And 6,000 miles to the north, at the Amyris headquarters in Emeryville, Calif., executives churn out reasons for
investors to cling to that dream.


So, they pour out creative phrases like “collaboration revenue” and “collaboration inflows” and generally stretch the
boundaries of believability as the company tries to maintain its stock price.


TheStreetSweeper is here to cut through the gibberish and explain why we don’t like Amyris.


This company is light on cash, heavy on loans – practically giving itself away to its partners in order to stay afloat.
The chief financial officer and three other officers recently fled – a classically bad sign - while the remaining
executives are left to try to breathe life into a business plan currently thrashing in its deathbed.


Which brings us to Amyris’ funny numbers and funny wording.

Unilife Corporation: Why this hypodermic needle company keeps jabbing investors


Pre-filled syringe company Unilife (UNIS) is losing millions and management is handing investors a minus 190
percent return on their money.


But its executives are living like kings.


They can thank the CEO’s brand of showmanship that puts P.T. Barnum to shame and likely contributes to the
unwarranted share price that’s hovering around $4.60.


And they can also thank their compensation committee with its laugh-out-loud justification for overpaying the folks
running a company that can’t seem to turn a dime in profit.


The lowest paid of the bunch is CEO Alan Shortall - the billiard ball-bald Aussie who practiced pitching Unilife to his
ex-girlfriend over a decade ago by promising, according to court records, “You will be a rich woman …” after
investing in the company.

Last year, Mr. Shortall received more than $690,000, including the $420,000 base salary and almost $45,000 to buy
and maintain a vehicle (compared with $6 million including unrealized stock awards the prior year).


Including hefty bonuses and stock, the other four officers last year received about $1 million apiece.


Even more stunning is what UNIS pays its directors.


Altogether, the directors earned a total of just over $2 million in the last two years. For attending a few meetings.


In that period, the unprofitable company generated just over $8 million in revenue.


So the non-employee directors handed themselves about 25 percent of the company’s revenues.


And new retainer fees and other compensation kicked in last December. Each director’s annual retainer fee alone
jumped $10,000 to $35,000. All courtesy of the shareholder-approved pay scale created by the three directors on
the compensation committee.


The perks for all directors include an extra 1,000 bucks whenever someone has to travel more than two hours to a
meeting.


Additionally, each director will receive 35,000 UNIS shares every year for the next three years. In today’s market,
that equates to just about $160,000 extra yearly compensation to directors.


Just for attending a few meetings a year.


*How does UNIS explain this level of self-enrichment?


An entertaining piece of prose gently tucked into the SEC filings tells the tale.

TherapeuticsMD (TXMD): Is it really a $1 billion company?


Everybody wanted a piece of TherapeuticsMD (NASDAQ:TXMD).


The little pharmaceutical company attracted investors ranging from a “consultant” whose patience paid off in
multiples to an ex-football player with both an MBA and a head lice-treatment company.  


Now, three years later, the company stock is booming even though it’s way too early to know whether the vitamin
company can ever pull off plans to launch hormone-based drugs for women.


Can it overcome ties to people with a history of securities problems and fallen companies?


Can it overcome huge losses, daunting litigation, and indistinguishable products?


Can it rise above a series of head-scratching business deals?


And can a reverse merger company selling only $2 million in vitamins really be worth almost $1 billion?


INSIDERS SHOULD BE CLAMMERING TO SELL MILLIONS


Here’s the key to a daunting near-term risk. Common sense dictates that as soon as the quiet period ends the first
week of March, smart insiders will begin selling some of their stock – about 34 million shares – like crazy.


The stock price is howling near record TXMD highs and they’ve got shares to sell, including a truckload of options
and warrants that they can exercise for as little as a quarter apiece.


That stash includes roughly 22 million shares in options and warrants just waiting in line to be cashed in.

Miller Energy: Digging Itself into Another Deep Hole?





Miller Energy Resources (Nasdaq: MILL) sure has proven one thing to the world, and it’s not the tremendous value of the
discarded oil reserves that the company picked up for next to nothing after more sophisticated players said, “No, thank you,”
either. Rather, as a bleeding energy firm buried underneath a mountain of expensive debt – with that weighty burden set to
grow even heavier in a matter of weeks – Miller has by now established that, if nothing else, it certainly knows how to dig itself
into a dangerous hole.


Take the daunting challenge that Miller will face next month, just for starters. Desperate for cash earlier this year and now on
the hook for the promises that it made in order to secure those essential funds, Miller must somehow find a way to come up
with $75 million by the end of January in order to avoid loan-shark interest rates (approaching the 20% mark) on every bit of
the bank debt that the firm currently owes. For a company with barely $20 million to its name right now – and commitments to
cover not only the double-digit interest payments that it already owes to both its lenders and its preferred stockholders but
also the $60 million that it just pledged for a major acquisition to boot – Miller can hardly afford for its hairy predicament to
grow even worse at this point.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 184/226


To Chapman Capital Founder Robert Chapman, the former boss of Miller President/Acting CFO David Voyticky and an
obvious skeptic of both the company and its senior management team, Miller barely even resembles a normal energy firm
since it focuses so much of its attention on raising capital that it seems to market its stock as its primary product while selling
a little bit of oil on the side.


“The gross production numbers are not big – they’re tiny – and the company is still cash-flow negative (from operations
combined with necessary capitalized investments), so it has to keep selling this story about its monstrous reserves,” Chapman
recently noted during a revealing interview with TheStreetSweeper about the five-month period when he employed Voyticky
as a partner at his firm and found the future Miller executive too incompetent (or unwilling) to fulfill the transactional activist,
non-investor relations duties required of that post.


“In the meantime, just look at the company!” Chapman declared. “It’s a preferred stock-issuance machine that seems to be
more in the business of raising money than making money. And to me, it looks like a stock that's driven by a myth.”


Like other dubious investors, Chapman refuses to buy that story. Indeed, Miller strikes the fund manager as a dangerous
company that has placed its trust in an executive that (based upon his own firsthand experience) lacks any substantial skills
outside of his ability to raise capital by "smooth-talking investors and lenders into parting with their funds." 


“With Voyticky involved,” Chapman bluntly proclaimed, “I can’t think of many better targets for a short.”


Don't mistake Bristol Capital Advisors as a noble savior just because that "activist" firm suddenly feels driven to overthrow the
current leadership due to its alleged incompetence and obvious greed, either. After all, Bristol secured its sizable stake in
Miller courtesy of lucrative consulting deals originally awarded – but recently cancelled – by the same boardroom directors
that the “outraged” firm now aims to replace with a brand-new slate of its own.


If history serves as any guide, Miller could pay a rather steep price for that intervention should Bristol ultimately succeed.

Opko Health (OPK): TheStreetSweeper stands bullish following Q&A with Dr. Phillip Frost


.


It’s been a volatile few days for Opko Health (NYSE: OPK)  as bear and bull articles duke it out over the growing
company run by billionaire entrepreneur Dr. Phillip Frost. TheStreetSweeper’s gotten a little bruised in the melee
(thanks, Anthony Bozza and Lakewood Capital Management!) but we’re back to say we stand by our original report
supporting our rare long thesis. We feel the company is poised for further growth under the leadership of Dr. Frost.





TheStreetSweeper respects Mr. Bozza and more often than not has agreed with Lakewood Capital. We’re sure we’ll
continue to view most companies in the same light in the future as we examine and expose poor management,
accounting games and outright scoundrels infesting public companies. But this time, we simply disagree with
Lakewood and the other shorts.





So, we went right to Dr. Frost and executive vice president-administration Steven Rubin to get answers to questions
raised by Mr. Bozza. Here is the edited Q&A:





1. Please tell us about your top two or three products that represent key catalysts, including timeframes and market
expectations.  
 


Dr. Phillip Frost: First is Rolapitant that we licensed out to Tesaro. They announced they expect to have results of
the phase 3 trial to report sometime this month possibly. We have no reason to believe it’ll be anything but
successful.  





This is an important drug to treat nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. The advantage it has
compared to its competitors is a single tablet will suffice to cover the patient for four or five or even six days,
whereas the competitors’ have to be taken on several days. Also, it is a highly effective anti-nausea and vomiting
drug. And we’re hopeful it will show superiority, particularly with respect to the nausea part of the equation.





That should be coming along. And the company is expecting peak sales of over $1 billion, and our royalties are in
the teens. We also get milestone payments of as much as $110 million as things move along. We’re very optimistic
about that product.





Second, within the next few months, we’ll be introducing our 4Kscore for prostate cancer. We bought a special
laboratory in Nashville, Tenn. to perform the tests. They have been gearing up and … we’re doing the final tests to
permit us to use our laboratory to perform the tests for blood samples that will be sent in from far and wide.

The advantage, which will initially be a confirmatory test for a positive PSA (prostate-specific antigen) to try to avoid
needless biopsies … The biopsies are expensive. They’re painful. They have side effects of bleeding and infections.
So to avoid 60 percent of the biopsies that are now performed would be very important. Ultimately as things go on,
because it’s a more precise test, we hope we’ll have the opportunity to perhaps even replace PSA as a screening
test, in addition to the confirmatory use for it.





Third … other product is in late phase 3 trials. It’s Rayaldy, the Vitamin D compound for phase 3 and 4 chronic
kidney disease. The Vitamin D levels in these patients are difficult to keep at a normal level. Because the Vitamin D
levels are low, they tend to make more parathyroid hormone ... which causes demineralization of the bone and
hyper-calcemia, which is a problem in that calcium deposits in the kidneys and the vascular system. And that’s often
the cause of death in these patients rather than the kidney disease itself.





The problem with currently available, over-the-counter products is they’re not very useful in raising serum Vitamin D
levels, particularly in kidney disease patients. And the prescription product have a possibility of causing
hypercalcemia.





In order to avoid the hypercalcemia, physicians tend to give lower doses than really required. With our product I
think we have the advantage of greater safety with respect to hypercalcemia. Very high efficacy.





 Because the present products sell for as high as $5,000 per year and as low as $3000, with 8 million patients in the
US with stage 3 and 4 kidney disease that suffer from low Vitamin D levels as well, the potential market even in the
United States alone is quite large - in the billions of dollars. We don’t expect to capture that amount of sales initially.
It will take a while, like with any product, to … have it reach its peak levels.





Those are three products that are within sight of coming to market. And we’re quite enthusiastic.





(TheStreetSweeper questions Lakewood Capital Management, which insisted it spoke with “numerous
nephrologists” who were skeptical, and then chose to focus on Dr. Jeffrey Giullian, a “veteran nephrologist” to try
to dispute Rayaldy's value. He’s such a veteran he began his clinical practice in 2008 or 2009 and has
apparently published only three peer-reviewed papers in his whole life. Take a look at his web site, here.  With all
due respect to the doctor, one of our physician sources said Dr. Giullian was incorrect in stating (per quotes on
pages 4 & 28 of Lakewood’s report) that over-the-counter Vitamin D causes side effects and that Rayaldy is just a
bit better than existing OTC treatments.





Also, page 27 of the report states, “The side effect of vitamin D is that it can raise calcium and phosphorous too
much, which can become a problem in later stages of CKD (when the kidneys are really struggling). So in more
advanced stages of treatment, physicians switch patients to other vitamin D analogs such as Zemplar and Hectorol.
These treatments have the beneficial effect of bringing down PTH without bringing up calcium levels.” Our doctor
source said it is patently absurd to state that vitamin D analogs are less calcemic than OTC vitamin D.)





2. Adding those products you discussed, Dr. Frost, what is the potential?
 


Dr. Phillip Frost: It is in the billions of dollars, without being specific. We don’t have to have $20 billion in sales for all
three or even $10 billion, for that matter, for the present stock value to be extremely low … with the possibility of
appreciation being very high. That’s the reason I continue to buy shares at most every opportunity I have.





3. The author of the Lakewood Capital report suggests you are buying a lot of Opko stock in perhaps an attempt to
entice investors into also buying. Anything to that?
 


Dr. Phillip Frost: I can’t keep people from being influenced one way or another. All I know is I invest because I don’t
know of another investment I could make that I would be more comfortable with. It’s not part of a marketing strategy.
Because if I didn’t believe in it I would be throwing away an awful lot of money. I’m not the type of person who
throws away money.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 186/226


1. Novartis deal does not guarantee an ongoing revenue stream. The UNIS syringes will be used in a clinical trial,
requiring few syringes. If Novartis enrolled 500 patients in the trial and injected each monthly using UNIS syringes,
UNIS could look forward to only about $5,400 in revenue over a year. No wonder the UNIS press release doesn’t
give financial details. It could easily take Novartis 3 to 5 years or more to complete clinical trials and get Food and
Drug Administration approval before it would need to order any substantial number of syringes.





2. Even if the Novartis clinical trials pass with flying colors and get FDA approval, the company could easily decide
to order syringes instead from safety syringe gorilla Becton Dickinson, controlling an estimated 70 percent of the
syringe market. Besides, a whistle-blower lawsuit suggests UNIS lacks the protocol and safety procedures to pull off
production of what sounds to be a more complicated syringe for Novartis.





3. Big announcements, bigger disappointments. Investors shouldn’t read into UNIS press releases that upcoming
large revenue streams will necessarily occur. The press releases tend to list minimum volume purchases of UNIS
syringes. These minimums are only to preserve exclusivity. No one is obligated to buy a certain volume.





4. UNIS CEO Alan Shortall has a goal of about a dozen contracts by year’s end. So far, five have been announced,
including the Novartis deal and a Sanofi deal that are re-warmed old contracts. Is the company likely to average
almost two contracts a week for the rest of the year? Highly unlikely.





5. Of the announced deals, three involve significant pharmaceutical companies – yet the press releases frequently
mention contracts worth $5 million upfront initially plus milestone payments and “expected” revenue and other
wishy-washy terms. Before investors hit the “buy” function, they should know what the company’s milestone
payments are based on, what the volume production would be and when, plus the length of the ramp-up period.
Investors need substance, not hype.

Opko Health (OPK) Street brawl: Doc and multi-billion dollar medical candidates positioned
for win


Opko Health (OPK) Street brawl: Doc and multi-billion dollar medical candidates positioned for win


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Opko Health (NYSE: OPK) may be sporting a shiner for now. But in this Street brawl, the big boy in the middle is a
billionaire who wears that black eye like a badge of courage, knowing full well that adversity will make his company
stronger. Besides, revenge will be so sweet.


Dr. Phillip Frost, the chief executive and chairman of OPK, is seeing a significant short position in his company. That
doesn’t ordinarily bother him much, though the short interest is nearly 21 percent of the shares outstanding.


Anthony Bozza of Lakewood Capital (which is reported to suffer a 0.5 percent net loss partially attributed to its short
portfolio) bloodied OPK’s nose a bit last week. He compounded the Wall Street drama when he presented his short
thesis on the pharmaceutical company Friday during the Robin Hood Conference.


“We’ve always enjoyed a nice big short position,” Dr. Frost told TheStreetSweeper. “I know shorts who lost a lot of
money … and later became my friends.”


Dr. Frost counts celebrity stock picker Jim Cramer, star of the “Mad Money” television show, among his many fans. A
true believer in both the accomplished doctor and his company, Cramer enthusiastically recommended OPK back
when it traded around the $5 range and remained bullish on the name even as the stock rocketed into double-digit
territory. While Cramer understands the temptation to start booking those gains, and openly encouraged big winners
to take some profits off the table a few days ago, he reiterated his ongoing support of OPK when TheStreetSweeper
contacted him about the company over the weekend.


“I like it very much,” Cramer said in an email Sunday evening. “Many ways to win!” 


Dr. Frost knows how to navigate the Food and Drug Administration, and is up on the latest technologies and
discoveries in a complicated industry, Jake Dollarhide of Longbow Asset Management said this morning.


“You’ve got to give Dr. Frost a lot of credit for building a healthcare juggernaut,” he said.


“The next few years could certainly be a big opportunity for Opko,” Mr. Dollarhide said. “If those drug trials meet
approval and those drugs are a success … we could certainly see the share price of Opko go significantly higher.”


Wall Street is stained by shaky companies overseen by shysters who happily mislead investors and then skulk away
dragging bags of dirty money. TheStreetSweeper has exposed many of these fraudulent miscreants, shorted them
and, in the process, tried to protect investors from painful losses.


But OPK is the rarest of rare finds for us. We like Dr. Frost. We like Opko Health.  We like Dr. Frost’s assessment of
his growing portfolio of sterling products:


“I’ve never been connected to any company with the potential of this one,” said Dr. Frost.

PhotoMedex (PHMD): No!no! doesn't cut it


Would’ve. Could’ve. Definitely should’ve. Those words ring in investors’ ears just after PhotoMedex’s (Nasdaq:
PHMD) bungled earnings report. But there’s a lot more to this story as the company faces ongoing challenges.


Here are highlights from issues TheStreetSweeper has exposed about the company whose main product is the
no!no! device that removes body hair with a hot wire device:


*Japan’s no!no! revenue no more. Ax falls on potentially $43 million-plus worth of product.


*Flawed stock buyback program. Insiders benefit.


*Food and Drug Administration reportable events, plus a quiet recall. Events include a fire that apparently
ignited inside a patient’s throat.


*Lawsuits. With a federal lawsuit loss behind it, additional litigation possibilities loom.


*Reason to sell. Key company product is fading.

PhotoMedex: Just say No!No!





PhotoMedex (NASDAQ:PHMD) is stirring up a cauldron of characters and events that makes this
“no!no!” hair-removal device company a hair-raising proposition for investors. 
 
Characters include Kim Kardashian, the competition’s formerly raven-haired spokeswoman who was
sued by PHMD.
 
And there’s Lewis Pell, board chairman and angel investor whose battered wings reportedly
contributed to an initial public offering falling apart. Before he and Shlomo Ben-Haim both wound up
at PHMD, he sued Mr. Ben-Haim, his frequent business partner and friend, alleging unfair distribution
of assets.
 
Finally, insider Mr. Ben-Haim is an oft-sued Israeli biotech gentleman billionaire whose enemies once
labeled a thug. His rival in one of those various lawsuits is none less than the State of Israel, which
alleged he and a partner stole Israel’s technology for freezing cells and entire organs. 
 
Here are six key PHMD issues that we believe pose risks for investors:
 
*Certain insiders dogged by volatile and litigious history, misappropriation guilty plea.
 
*Key product, already down in the U.S. versus last year, rests on flimsy, weak studies. 
 
*Study shows key product, no!no! Hair Removal System, works no better than shaving. Further
verified by significant consumer rancor.
 
*Possible class action litigation may be looming.
 
*We anticipate disappointing earnings ahead.
 
*Massive insider selling precedes planned $30 million stock buyback.
 
Now, through the light of a full moon - and TheStreetSweeper’s digging - investors can get a good
look at ominous scars that may well damage the company’s future stock price.

SGMO: A fiery biotech with a product poised to go down in flames?





Sangamo Biosciences (NASDAQ:SGMO) is on fire.
 
One day it’s supposedly curing AIDS. A couple days later, it’s selling stock.
 
The Richmond, Calif. company just announced another public offering. That comes just two months after
execs bragged about the company being loaded with cash - $66 million - not from selling a product since it
has nothing to market, but mostly from research funding.
 
The offering of 6.1 million shares at $10.58 per share should produce about $65 million for “working capital
and other general corporate purposes.” Underwriters may also pick up as many as 915,000 additional
shares to cover over-allotment. Now many investors who've watched their $15 IPO shares tumble since
2000 face the prospects of more dilution. 
 
Meanwhile, a cure for AIDS certainly should be shouted to the moon.

Judging by its recent presentation of clinical data at a conference in Denver, SGMO ought to be shouting.
After all, when it made a measly $1 million acquisition of a riches-to-rags company, SGMO blared out the
news in a one hour conference.
 
But it implies it’s pretty much got the cure for AIDS and that is not important enough for a conference? Just
a little, carefully worded press release. Sort of like, “Umm, we can cure AIDS.”
 
Why?
 
Maybe SGMO folks are a little worried that an outright AIDS-cure announcement would expose their
company to more critical questions and analysis. Well, read on.
 
Though SGMO happily buoys investors’ hopes by exclaiming about its  “spectacular” and “unbelievably
powerful” data, the signs say investors should get the red “Failure” stamp ready to go. Our investigation,
reinforced by comments from renowned HIV doctor Joseph Sonnabend, suggests it’s time for a splash of
cold reality on this company that’s seen its stock roughly double this year to its recent record $11.48. 
 
Failure: SGMO’s key product, an HIV “functional cure?” 
 
SGMO has raised money repeatedly over many years by promoting its zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) gene
modification technology, described as “molecular scissors” that cut and replace gene pieces. About 300
biotech companies are working in genetic tinkering. SGMO’s key target is HIV, the virus that causes AIDs.
 
This is the technology that SGMO has used to entice investors since the mid-1990s. That’s right. For nearly
two decades since its inception, the company has done a heap of talking. But it hasn’t moved a single
product.
 
Here’s what SGMO has accomplished:
*It’s held six public offerings now since its IPO. These offerings total about $140 million.
*One of 300 biotech companies working on ways to control genes. Forbes recently highlighted one.
*18 years of promoting an unapproved technology.
*18 years of raking in investors’ money.
*18 years of operating losses, since inception in 1995.
*Still not one marketable product. Nothing’s made it even to phase III clinical trials ... in 18 years.
*Previous attempted product using its technology for a diabetic nerve disorder failed in phase II testing.
*Consistent insider selling, including 47,000 shares sold for over $10, just a couple of buys. The last was in
2010 at about $3.
 
The evidence, we believe, indicates that SGMO keeps dragging out the same faulty study conclusions as a
way to keep the money flowing. TheStreetSweeper would be astounded if SGMO produces a marketable
anti-HIV product - ever. 
 
We submitted trial results and graphs via email to Dr. Sonnabend, renowned HIV researcher and retired HIV
clinician. He pioneered community-based research of HIV, co-founded three AIDS organizations and
received the Nellie Westerman Prize for Research in Ethics. 
 
The esteemed doctor was not impressed. He indicated that in all the information sent to him, there’s
absolutely nothing to suggest SGMO’s treatment works.
 
“... I’d say that no meaningful evidence was presented to indicate that their treatment has antiviral activity,”
said Dr. Sonnabend.

Zenyatta: Selling a Story with More Holes Than Its Celebrated Mine


CORRECTION: TheStreetSweeper has elected to remove the second story in this series after discovering on
Friday morning that the CEO of Zenyatta actually worked with a different Don Sheldon than the promoter
identified in the article. While TheStreetSweeper continues to stand by the other revelations included in that
report, including the doubts expressed by notable industry experts about the validity of the story that the
company itself has told, we have nevertheless chosen to withdraw the entire article to address the situation
and compensate for this accidental oversight. We regret this error and apologize for any confusion that it
might have caused.


Give Zenyatta Ventures (TSXV:ZEN.V; OTC: ZENYF) credit for this much. While that highflying junior miner has yet to deliver
the most preliminary report that investors need to even begin judging the value of its celebrated graphite deposit, let alone
produce any concrete evidence that its graphite rivals the best in the world, the company has managed to establish one thing
for sure. As a standout performer in a crowd of junior miners that have tanked along with the underlying price of graphite –
and now sports a hefty $175 million market capitalization that eclipses the market values assigned to a number of its more
advanced rivals combined – Zenyatta has clearly proven that, if nothing else, the company knows how to sell a tantalizing
story.


Granted, by the time that Zenyatta CEO Aubrey Eveleigh launched the company as a junior miner originally scouting for
overlooked copper and nickel deposits, he had already mastered a similar pitch while steering the exploration program for
another Canadian junior that obediently responded with some rather amazing – if fleeting – gains of its own. Like Zenyatta
itself, MetalCorp (TSXV: MTC.V; OTC:MTLCF) looked hopelessly stuck in penny-stock land until the obscure resource player
suddenly exploded to record highs after the company reported that it had basically stumbled upon a valuable discovery by
complete accident. Indeed, with Eveleigh routinely surfacing as the official voice of that doomed company, MetalCorp literally
spent years trumpeting a series of “lucky breaks” that kept hope alive (and the bleeding miner afloat) long enough to
deplete most of its funds and finally prompt the board to kick the future chief of Zenyatta out of its own executive suite.


Four years after MetalCorp severed its ties with Eveleigh -- later credited for raising the mountain of cash that the battered
miner spent -- the company now sports a total market of value of less than $1 million and trades for a mere penny a share. 


While initially forced to settle for a similar post at an obscure miner that looked similarly worthless, Eveleigh soon negotiated a
handy deal that would allow him to overcome the fresh stain on his record (since erased with the helpful passage of time) and
provide him with the material to produce his recent encore. After securing minority rights to some remote mining

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 189/226


claims through a consulting firm that he owns – terminated by wrecked MetalCorp, along with the executive himself, earlier
that same year – Eveleigh orchestrated a lucrative related-party deal that supplied that discarded asset to a “numbered”
company that could then go public with that swampy land as its flagship property and the disgraced executive in charge of the
entire show.


When Zenyatta filed the official paperwork for its stock offereing the following year, of course, the company dutifully portrayed
Eveleigh as a successful corporate executive with an impressive background in geology and a proven track record in the
mining field. Notably, however, Zenyatta also referred to Eveleigh as an outright “promoter” throughout its prospectus and
further underscored that disturbing role in a so-called “certificate of the promoter – signed by the CEO himself – at the end of
that crucial document.


To be sure, with Eveleigh overseeing its business and handling its publicity, Zenyatta has followed a rather familiar path on its
amazing journey to record-breaking highs. After debuting as just another obscure miner and languishing in penny-stock
territory for a couple of years -- providing early investors with little incentive to exercise pricier warrants that would inject
millions into its bank account -- Zenyatta suddenly rushed to capitalize on its own accidental discovery of a particularly hot
resource that had spiked in price to generate plenty of helpful buzz. With the company trumpeting its graphite deposit as both
extraordinarily rare and extremely valuable, while forecasting massive production rates of top-quality graphite that commands
a steep premium, Zenyatta finally began to gather steam about a year ago and soon blew right past the former hotshots in its
peer group to emerge with the most breathtaking gains in that fading sector by far.  


A stock that fetched as little as 15 cents a share last summer, threatening to render a mountain of $1 warrants effectively
worthless by the end of the year, Zenyatta has since rocketed all the way to a record high of $5 a share and continues to trade
near the top of that gigantic range. Indeed, even after shedding 25% of its peak value since late July, Zenyatta still commands
more than an entire group of noteworthy competitors – with both its stock and its overall market cap exceeding those of
Northern Graphite (TSVX: NGC.V; OTC: NGPHF), Focus Graphite (TSVX: FMS.V; (OTC:FSCMF), Big North Graphite
(TSVX: NRT.V; OTC: BNCIF) and Alabama Graphite (CN: ALP.CN; OTC: ABGPF) combined – despite the head-starts that
position those miners to enter the market long before their pricier rival ever gets its own chance.


Since Zenyatta has never presented any documented evidence to validate its claims about either the abundance or the quality
of its graphite deposits – and still needs to provide the first in a series of formal reviews that will likely take years to complete –
the company strikes some of the most prominent veterans in the industry as a worthless promotion at worst and the riskiest
name in the group at the absolute best.


“Zenyatta hasn’t done one thing to prove that they have material that can be used in the applications that they claim,”
declared Asbury Carbons CEO Stephen Riddle, the fourth-generation leader of a company that has operated in the graphite
space for more than a century. “Whenever it comes out that whatever they promoted isn’t going to work, the stock will
collapse … Personally, I think that they’re going to put a big black eye on the entire industry.”

The ExOne Company: Irrational exuberance obscures black clouds building around 3-D
printing


The ExOne Company’s (NASDAQ: XONE) surprise stock offering last week irritated investors. 


The 3-D printer maker is diluting investors‘ shares to raise millions just six months after its public offering. 
 
But the company has buried reasons for even more irritation deep within the S1registration papers it filed
after the bell Aug. 21.  
 
The chief executive and his interests get far more money under this deal than the company itself.
 
It’s roughly $100 million for him versus $72 million for the company. That’s 1.55 million shares and 1.1
million shares respectively at the $65 per share listed in the filing. The registration papers specify the shares
will be offered by the company and by “selling stockholders.” A dig through the gibberish reveals those
“selling stockholders” are actually CEO Kent Rockwell - through his two entities and trust.
 
Funny timing on that trust. Exactly one day before the registration announcement, Mr. Rockwell, through an
entity, boldly gave his trust 450,000 shares worth about $30 million.  
 
The stock reached $70 on the day he gave away the shares. As is common, share prices dropped right
after the company announced the offering, falling for a time below $65.
 
And there’s more to this deal. Mr. Rockwell himself ultimately stands to benefit yearly from his charitable
deed.
 
The “remainder trust” benefits Lafayette College, Rockwell’s alma mater. It requires Lafayette to pay
Rockwell’s entity 5 percent of the trust’s assets each year for 10 years (likely over $1 million the first year).
Whatever’s left over after a decade goes to Lafayette.
 
Once approved, the stock offering could also include up to 398,400 additional shares held by Rockwell’s
entities, President David Burns (whose total 2012 compensation exceeded $3.5 million), Chief Financial
Officer John Irvin (whose compensation exceeded $1.8 million) and two other execs. These are over-
allotment shares exercisable within 30 days of the offering if the public demand is high enough. 
 
The other millions of shares are locked up for 90 days or the end of November. 
 
Yet another lockup release date hits just around the corner in early September. One minute before midnight
on Friday, Aug. 30 is when the 180-day post initial public offering lockup expires, potentially unleashing
more than 7 million shares onto the market. The lockup release initially set for Aug. 5 was delayed until after
the company reported its 2Q earnings in mid-August.
 
At nosebleed valuations, the company and Mr. Rockwell are likely to sell far more stock than if the valuation
had been depressed.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 190/226


 
 
Personal piggy bank
 
XONE reported proceeds of about $92 million from the initial public offering in February. But about $16.6
million of this went into Mr. Rockwell’s pockets through his entities for things such as land payments, and
repayment of loans and one entity’s entire debt. He also sold more than $10.2 million of stock in the IPO. 
 
After subtracting costs such as offering expenses, our figures show XONE realized IPO proceeds of about
$63.3 million. 
 
The initial public offering made Mr. Rockwell about $26.8 million richer.
 
Indeed, Mr. Rockwell seems to be having a lot of success in making XONE his own personal piggy bank.
The two offerings potentially could make him $97 million to $127 million wealthier.
 
Mr. Rockwell’s ownership has gone from 71.1 percent pre-IPO to about 22-23 percent or over 3 million
shares, according to the filing. They’re worth somewhere around $198 million. Yet he’s apparently not afraid
to pinch pennies - he charges XONE hundreds of thousands of dollars for the use of his entity’s airplane
and services.

TearLab: Blind Faith in a Risky Highflier with Forgotten Tear Stains





TearLab (Nasdaq: TEAR) might feel like crying if it contacted some of the doctors listed on its own website as
providers of its diagnostic test for dry eye disease and listened to the
feedback from those who no longer use its glorified machine.


Take Dr. Seaborn Hunt, for example. A Florida ophthalmologist, Dr. Hunt practices medicine in a popular retirement
town crowded with seniors who qualify for coverage of the $50 TearLab test under the government-funded Medicare
program. While TearLab specifically identifies his clinic as one of three local practices that utilize its device –
 generally provided by the company, free of charge, in exchange for a commitment to purchase a steady supply of
the disposable cards that its system requires – Dr. Hunt has already returned his own machine and gladly resumed
his use of an old-fashioned diagnostic test for DED instead.


“It was just a pain,” one of his employees bluntly explained. “We sent it back because we found it to be inaccurate.


“I know that a lot of people are advertising it. But if you have (DED), you have it. You don’t need a machine to tell
you that.”


In neighboring Alabama, yet another ophthalmologist on that list must have reached a similar conclusion. Identified
by TearLab as one of only four eye doctors who offer its test in the city of Birmingham, the largest metropolitan area
in the entire state, Dr. Michael A. Callahan recently pulled the plug on that medical device – portrayed as an outright
“lemon” by a member of his staff – and shipped the machine back to the company, too.


“I saw them boxing up this machine yesterday,” the receptionist volunteered when contacted
by TheStreetSweeper a couple of weeks ago. “And sure enough, that was it! They sent it back; they found that it
was not all that it was supposed to be.”


For its part, TearLab promotes its namesake device as a tremendous breakthrough so revolutionary that eye doctors
will likely adopt the test as a new “standard of care” by screening their patients for DED as a matter of routine. While
TearLab acknowledged that it has fielded a “small number of device returns” from doctors who effectively bailed on
their multi-year contracts, when specifically questioned by TheStreetSweeper ahead of this story, the company
pointed to low reimbursement from private insurers in certain areas – never hinting at any dissatisfaction with the
machine itself – as the primary reason.


Regardless, TearLab has definitely sold Wall Street on its sexy story. After all, based on virtually any normal
measurement tool, TearLab arguably should remain stuck (where it languished for years) deep in single-digit
territory. All told, TearLab mustered less than $4 million in revenue last year -- easily dwarfed by the $12 million
operating loss that it endured while pursuing that business – and recently closed the books on a “blockbuster”
quarter by generating a modest $3.5 million in sales (likely eclipsed by yet another sizable loss) even after
a powerful growth spurt.


A neglected $3 stock just one year ago, TearLab has nevertheless rocketed all the way past $14 a share since that
time to achieve a lofty market valuation of $410 million – a staggering 70 times its prior-year sales – with the help
of bullish calls from conflicted analysts who keep on urging investors to buy the pricey stock in spite of its nosebleed
multiples.

Coronado Biosciences (NASDAQ: CNDO): A master puppeteer�s folly?





Coronado Biosciences (NASDAQ: CNDO) is tangled amid a bizarre whipworm therapeutic candidate, jail birds,
cozy relationships, crazy financing, decimated companies controlled by a master puppeteer - and just now a
brand new $200 million shelf registration.  
 
And it’s all precisely timed. The company is rolling out public stock offerings - and filed the new S-3 that will
further dilute the stock with millions upon millions of additional shares - just before clinical trial results are
released.

Is this because CNDO suspects its key candidate - live pig whipworm eggs - won’t work? Does the company
suspect that it will never even reach phase III?
 
Despite several negative study results, CNDO is testing its pig whipworm eggs to treat auto-immune diseases,
a medical area populated by fierce pharma companies with deep pockets. 
 
Independent investigators recently conducted trials based on batches of 2,500 parasitic eggs, culled from pig
manure, that hatched out in patients’ guts. The parasitic egg cocktails caused three to 19 times more
incidences of pain and other severe side effects - typically lasting for weeks - than in patients on a placebo. 
 
In fact, the results were so bad that over a dozen patients stopped gulping down their worm egg drinks
before the study ended.
 
Similar risks turned up in three separate studies - all apparently ignored by Burlington, Mass-based CNDO.
And even though independent study authors urged fewer eggs per dose in future testing, some patients will
slurp down three times more - 7,500 worm eggs - in each dose every two weeks, under a new study that
CNDO is resolutely conducting. 
 
Set up for dilution
 
Despite the negatives, the stock more than tripled over the last year to reach an all-time high of $12.70 on
April 23. 
 
Days later, CNDO filed an ongoing at-the-market offering on April 29 to sell $45 million worth of stock at the
company’s whim. 
 
Was that enough? No. According to the newest S-3, the company amended the ATM offering so it could sell up
to $70 million worth of stock.
 
And was that enough? No, still not enough. This bleeding company with a highly debatable product in fact
quietly filed this new shelf registration after market close July 12. Once effective, CNDO will be able to
distribute $200 million worth of stock or warrants from time to time over three years, as determined by
market conditions. This represents tremendous dilution and overhang for a company with a market cap of
about $234 million.

Revolution Lighting Technologies (NASDAQ:RVLT): A wild ride destined to leave investors in
a heap?





A wild, sudden interest in its boring business has Revolution Lighting Technologies (NASDAQ:RVLT) soaring. Shares have more
than doubled over the past three months, pushing the stock into the Russell 3000. 
 
Rather impressive for a company that was pretty much left for dead late last year. Then Robert LaPenta, a high-roller known for both
his horse sense and business sense,  rode in with multi-millions of dollars to toss RVLT’s way in exchange for multi-millions of shares of
stock in the light bulb company. After his financial entities’ first $6 million infusion last September, LaPenta propped up the struggling
company again and again over the following months until the influx totaled $21 million.
 
But TheStreetSweeper believes Mr. LaPenta is beating a dead horse. RVLT just closed at nearly $4, but compared to its peers the stock
should trade for about 7 cents to 20 cents per share. Even Mr. LaPenta’s entities paid what seems like a fair price of 13 cents to $1.17.  
 
The reasons behind our position include:
 
*Big cash burn: dilution looks imminent.
*Based on the market cap of $305.7 million as of Friday’s close, sales are ridiculously puny.
*Most revenue depends on a recent over-priced acquisition that struggled with declining sales and no profits.
*Questionable ability to generate recurring revenues.
*Insider buying may be just a cheap way to promote the stock. 
 
The company is still traveling through rough terrain, according to investment advisor Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset
Management.

KEYW: Infecting Investors with a False Sense of Security?


* Editor's Note: The following story is the second installment in a detailed investigative report on KEYW.
Simply click here for immediate access to the earlier article.


 
The more cash that KEYW (Nasdaq: KEYW) blows on acquisitions to pursue its capital-intensive growth strategy –
 without unlocking the fabulous potential that management sure liked to trumpet whenever it tried to justify those
expensive deals – the more the bleeding rollup company seems to conveniently relax its standards for success.


Go back and look at the compelling story that KEYW presented to the press a couple of years ago, when it first
arrived on the scene as a young public company bursting with fresh promise, and compare the glorious visions that
management shared back then with the stark results that the swaggering upstart actually went on to deliver instead.
In a bold (if misplaced) show of confidence ahead of an embarrassing setback, KEYW predicted that it would
capitalize on its relentless shopping spree by not only enhancing its role as a prime contractor on big-budget
government projects but also by maximizing the future performance of all the obscure firms that it kept on
swallowing – casually boasting that “30 percent organic growth is achievable” right off the bat – once it fully digested
those acquisitions into its own system and transformed them into a fresh layer of muscle.


Eager to showcase its early progress a few months after debuting on the Nasdaq exchange, KEYW bragged that it
already generated two-thirds of its revenue from coveted prime contracts and practically assumed that its share of
that high-margin business would further expand along with its escalating size. Unable to land a prominent $700

million government contract or even maintain some of the lucrative projects that it already supervised, however,
KEYW wound up playing a secondary role on so many of the accounts that it inherited – with prime contracts
accounting for barely one-quarter of its revenue by 2012 – that the company emerged from its costly shopping binge
looking more like a lowly subcontractor than ever.


Since KEYW has largely manufactured its top-line growth by simply purchasing other firms and then booking their
revenue as its own, the ravenous defense contractor still looks like a typical rollup company, too. To be sure, KEYW
has yet to approach the impressive levels of organic growth that management supposedly regarded as
“achievable” back when its young stock staged its first remarkable (if temporary) rally. Even based on the generous
formula that KEYW prefers to calculate its organic growth – selectively including any new business that it has added
while conveniently excluding any prior business that it has lost – the company has fallen well short of the incredible
productivity gains that it originally promised and, two years later, now seem hopelessly beyond its reach.

KEYW: Drunk on Hype and Doomed to Sing the Blues?





 
As a fanatical “ParrotHead” with an encyclopedic knowledge of Jimmy Buffett songs, KEYW (Nasdaq: KEYW) Chief
Executive Officer Leonard Moodispaw often seems more inclined to share catchy lyrics penned by his idol than
useful details about the actual business conducted by his glorified rollup company. While Moodispaw likes to
present snippets from those upbeat tunes as metaphors for noteworthy developments at his tightlipped cyber-
security firm, however, he has somehow managed to overlook the very title that perhaps delivers the most fitting
message of all: “Math Suks.”


No matter how well Moodispaw might spin its record or how much he tries to promote its next big hit, KEYW remains
a bleeding defense contractor that has spent a fortune on acquisitions and – now down to its last $3 million and
already burdened by plenty of debt (with limited available credit left) – still needs to prove itself.


Practically broke after raising almost $100 million through a dilutive secondary offering last fall, the war chest
supplied by its initial public offering two years earlier basically gone, KEYW traveled all the way to Europe last week
in an effort to strike up fresh interest in the company by hosting an apparent road show for investors halfway around
the globe. A somewhat rare courtesy that largely escaped the attention of investors back home, left puzzled (but
understandably pleased) by the energetic gains that KEYW recorded once that distant road show began, the move
nevertheless struck some of the more cynical followers of the company as an obvious – if desperate – reach by the
bleeding firm for additional funds.   


While KEYW never bothered to openly publicize that important event on its official schedule, let alone divulge the
actual intentions behind it, a corporate cheerleader helpfully volunteered that enlightening update from Europe
himself. A former analyst who spent the end of his Wall Street career stubbornly clinging to his relentless faith in
Force Protection, one of the more notorious flameouts that stained his record, KEYW Vice President of Corporate
Development Chris Donaghey originally originally fell in love with the first rollup company that Moodispaw
built before joining him in the executive suite at the next.


Focused since then on promoting KEYW alone, Donaghey surprised even TheStreetSweeper with news of the
foreign road show when it contacted him on Tuesday seeking input from the company ahead of this story. Tied up
with potential investors at the time, Donaghey promised to address probing questions from TheStreetSweeper –
seeking detailed information to supplement the vague and/or opaque material that the stingy company normally
chooses to share – by early this week for inclusion in follow-up stories. (Since KEYW emailed its somewhat vague
responses to the questions that it chose to answer right as the market opened today, beyond the deadline that would
have allowed reasonable time for their full incorporation into this story, TheStreetSweeper will simply provide a link
to the the information supplied by the company at the present time.) 


The first in a series of articles on the incredibly secretive cyber-security firm (with the second currently scheduled to
follow in a matter of days), this broad introduction challenges the rosy image that KEYW has long enjoyed by
presenting thorny evidence that pokes holes in the compelling story often sold to trusting investors as the absolute
gospel. By combing through voluminous piles of regulatory filings and comprehensive databases full of revealing
media coverage, TheStreetSweeper has gathered enough disturbing material to shatter some of the most powerful
illusions that surround the company and in turn undermine some of the most critical arguments that favor its stock.
As the opening installment in that series, this story serves as a general overview that summarizes overlooked
contradictions to popular myths about the company, with the most relevant of those – related to its business
strategy, its leadership team and its track record – detailed more extensively in the remaining sections of the report.

Lot78 (LOTE): A Glorified Fad Headed for the Discount Bin?





As an overhyped microcap name touted by dubious stock promoters, Lot78 (OTC: LOTE) sure looks like a fashion
stock that will soon go out of style. After rocketing all the way from $1 to $9 a share in recent weeks – an
inexplicable spike that has left the bleeding retailer with a bloated $500 million market value that now exceeds 1,000
times its prior-year sales – LOTE bears an awfully close resemblance to another hot fashion pick that wound up with
the shelf life of a momentary fad.


Forget about all of the warnings that LOTE has included in its official regulatory filings for a moment: the modest
sales, totaling less than $500,000 annually, that actually declined last year; the relentless losses and lack

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 193/226


of cash that drove the company to borrow $40,000 from its founder just to stay afloat; the onerous debt, owed to its
major shareholder, that literally exceeds the dwindling sales mustered by the company over the course of the past
year; the doubt expressed by its independent auditor over its very chances of survival; even the insolvent status of
the company reflected by the imbalance between the meager assets and the far larger liabilities recorded on its
books.


In fact, go ahead and forget about the reverse merger that magically transformed the company from a defunct
energy firm into a highflying retailer – using a vehicle long associated with “pump-and-dump” schemes – that has
somehow exploded to reach double-digit prices rarely achieved (let alone maintained) on the lowly penny-stock
exchange. Granted, under the terms of that reverse merger, the original owners of the empty shell wound up holding
almost half of the stock that now trades under the LOTE symbol and now stand to make a tremendous fortune by
unloading those expensive shares with the stock in overdrive. Of course, now that LOTE has mysteriously surfaced
on a foreign stock exchange that’s particularly vulnerable to manipulation, those lucky investors could further boost
their outsized gains by actually selling some of that overvalued stock short – effectively betting on its decline -- and
hitting a nice jackpot on any future collapse.


Overlook the fact that the founder’s citizenship makes it virtually impossible for poor, disgruntled shareholders to
seek justice, should the need arise. Indeed, filings state:


"Our sole officer and director, Mr. Oliver Amhurst, is a resident of Great Britain. As a result, it may be difficult or
impossible for our investors to effect service of process within the United States upon him, to bring suit against him
in the United States or to enforce in the United States courts any judgment obtained there against him predicated
upon any civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws."


Forget that, anyway. Simply focus on the glossy newsletter mailed to thousands of potential investors – courtesy of a
massive publicity campaign with a $2.5 million budget that actually exceeds the total sales achieved by LOTE to
date – instead.

Lululemon: Sheer lunacy





Lululemon Athletica’s pants fiasco is just getting worse, forcing the yoga gear company into a futile battle that we
believe will persist and lead to missed earnings.





Lululemon (NYSE:LULU) CEO Christine Day stated that the company’s recent recall of too-sheer pants was limited:
“So it’s just the black pant in particular.”





The pants debacle cost LULU an estimated $75 million -$86 million expected to cut earnings per share by 11 cents
to 12 cents. But now, the company has pulled more garments and even more recalls could be ahead.


Last Friday, the company pulled clothing made of its candy-striped Luon fabric but did so quietly, notifying only a
minority of customers who happened to catch the recall mention on LULU’s Facebook page. This comes almost a
month after the initial recall of the core black Luon women’s pants. TheStreetSweeper wanted to ask LULU why the
candy-striped bottoms were no longer listed on its website this week but LULU declined an interview.





Even more clothes may need to be recalled because the sheerness problem would be as bad or worse than the
black Luon garments because of the characteristics of the fabric, according to a source with 29 years of experience,
including many years with a key competitor. 


Photographs show some colored pants offer little more coverage than panty hose.


The company, meanwhile, is striding forward in its tried-and-true fashion of not discounting, Day also assured
analysts during the March 21 conference call. 


Here’s what she said:


“We achieved these results in a very brand-appropriate way, and did not buy our comps through discounting, which
ultimately would have harmed the brand. We maintained a full price strategy up to the holidays, then used our
traditional warehouse sales as an effective and low-risk way to clear our inventory.” (italics added)


Just one week after she made that statement, the company quietly held a massive weekend sale.


LULU customers in New York, Dallas, Los Angeles and other cities sorted through racks loaded - and often reloaded
- with numerous garments over three days. These were not just last season’s styles and colors but also new styles,
according to our checks of more than 20 stores. In one case, the sale was so secretive that an irate customer said
that, the day before the sale began in a New York City store, an assistant manager left a message on her phone
saying there would be no sale. 


 The sales - which clerks or educators typically referred to as “markdowns,” (one former clerk says the word “sale”
was strictly forbidden) - are common and continuing. Indeed, significant markdowns were offered in many stores we
checked on again last weekend. 


Educators in Las Vegas and Seattle stores said that customers can always find a rack or two of new and older styles
marked down. In fact, the sales are directed by corporate headquarters, as a Vegas educator said that, while the
store can exercise autonomy, it also gets weekly calls from corporate to learn which items to mark down.

Photos showing recent sales racks in stores across the country, along with discounted inventory and price tags
are here,  set2, set3, set4, set5, set6, set7,  set8, set9., set10, or set11. 


LULU’s strategy of scarcity is the coveted key to keeping customers running to its stores to buy yoga gear on the
spot at full price. This is not just something she alluded to in the March 21 conference call. Day has made it obvious
time and again that brand-harming discounting is not the LULU way.


“Our guest knows that there’s a limited supply, and it creates these fanatical shoppers,” Day told The Wall Street
Journal last year.


And in an interview on CNBC in January, Day reiterated LULU’s disdain of  promotions: “You’re either going to play
in that game of discount or you’re not. And we’re in the ‘not’ category,” Day said.

Bio-Reference: The Chilling Results of a Lie-Detector Test





Talk about a company that knows how to test the limits of credibility. By now, Bio-Reference Laboratories
(Nasdaq: BRLI) has contradicted itself so many times that its own statements establish the company as blatantly
deceitful at worst and dangerously unreliable at the absolute best. As illustrated by the string of conflicting
viewpoints and glaring reversals that follow, most of them directly attributable to the company itself, Bio-Reference
might face more than a few challenges if it dared an attempt at passing a lie-detector test.





* Bio-Reference claim: “The company has no knowledge of any government subpoenas about its billing practices.”
(Source: email from Bio-Reference to TheStreetSweeper on Feb. 25, 2013)


* Contradictory evidence: “The company has, from time to time, received subpoenas from state agencies and from
the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services seeking documents
relating to the company’s billing-related activities.” (Source: brand-new disclosure in Bio-Reference 10-K report for
the 2012 fiscal year filed by the company – and certified by its CEO and CFO as reliable – on Jan. 14, 2013)





* Bio-Reference claim: “Let me just go emphasize. In women’s health, we make these tests available. The doctors
order these tests. They order the Pap smears. They will order whatever molecular test that they want. We don’t do
that … We may monitor what they do and make sure, if we can, they don’t over-test … But these doctors choose it.”
(Source: Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman downplaying the potential for excessive use of high-end specialty tests
sold by its GenPath subsidiary during a quarterly conference call on May 26, 2011)


* Contradictory evidence: “$300 visit + $845 lab bill for an annual checkup. Lab is called GenPath, and they
conducted fraud on my insurance and me by charging for some kind of tests that were never ordered. Seaside staff
member said: ‘I think the lab is regularly overcharging patients like this and, when they charge the insurance, they
don’t return anything.’ ??? After several aggravated calls to Seaside, they finally persuaded the lab to waive the out-
of-pocket fees, but are still keeping what they’ve stolen from my insurance. This is wrong on many levels and could
happen to you.” (Source: an online review posted in December of 2012 by Diana Konrad, a San Diego
photographer who underwent a routine Pap smear only to later discover that GenPath had billed her Blue
Cross/Blue Shield plan for a far more elaborate test – without prior authorization from her physician – and allegedly
pulled the same trick with others on a regular basis)





* Bio-Reference claim: “The change in the BlueCard … is a complex issue which, for the most part, only became
effective as of January 1, 2013. At this time, the company believes it is too early to ascertain potential impacts on its
business.” (Source: email from Bio-Reference to TheStreetSweeper on Feb. 25, 2013)


* Bio-Reference claim: “Based on our current experience with billing, we believe the change in the BlueCard
program will not have a material effect on our business this year … I think it’s creating a lot of confusion, (but) we’re
comfortable in being able to say that, overall, the impact is not going to be significant for us.” (Source: conference
call hosted by the company to review its first-quarter results and full-year outlook on Feb. 28, 2013)


* Contradictory evidence: “Something else is occurring now that could be very difficult for some of us in independent
laboratories. (Soon), the easier access that BlueCard afforded the patient will be gone … If we’re shut out of the
game before that change evolves, then we won’t be able to compete … Think of it this way: The Blues will be able to
do what the FDA could not do to stop innovation and new testing, because you simply will have no ability – no way,
no mechanism – to bill, except to have the patient pay for it out of his or her own pocket.” (Source: speech given by
Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman to fellow lab executives in May of 2012 ahead of the nationwide BlueCard
change)


* Contradictory evidence: “Some labs are seeing as much as an 85% drop in Blue Cross payments. This is going to
cause regional laboratories a big financial hardship … It’s something that we’re struggling with tremendously.”
(Source: fallout from the BlueCard change witnessed by Alice Carroll, president of Revenue Cycle Consultant, a firm
specifically hired by labs to help enhance their billing systems and bolster their collection rates)

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 195/226


Don’t be surprised if Bio-Reference Laboratories (Nasdaq: BRLI) finds itself stuck with so many rejected claims that, after
years of relentlessly pushing expensive specialty tests, the company finally starts to look like a victim of its own success.


Take the flood of denials that Bio-Reference can expect from the most dominant health insurer in the entire country.
While far from the only setback that Bio-Reference has encountered -- with a whistleblower reporting government
scrutiny of its past billing practices, for example, and multiple insurers disputing its claims for tests on suspected con
artists – this one potentially represents the most immediate threat.





 
Last fall, two weeks before Bio-Reference opened its books on the quarter that it will review tomorrow, the Blue
Cross and Blue Shield Association closed a major loophole in its flexible BlueCard program that stripped regional
labs of their former access to BCBS plans outside their own borders. Ever since BCBS enacted that nationwide
policy, records indicate, Bio-Reference has effectively operated as an out-of-network provider – subject to
copayments, deductibles and routine denials – in every state except for the handful where the company actually
holds contracts with local BCBS plans. As a regional laboratory that generates 60% of its revenue from lucrative
“esoteric” tests that it markets all over the country, where one-third of the population relies on BCBS for health
benefits, Bio-Reference could theoretically lose 20% of its business due to this overlooked measure alone.


“Some labs are seeing as much as an 85% drop in Blue Cross payments,” said Alice Carroll, president of Revenue
Cycle Consultant, a firm specifically hired by labs to help enhance their billing systems and bolster their collection
rates. “This is going to cause regional laboratories a big financial hardship … It’s something that we’re struggling
with tremendously.”


Just ask the labs themselves. Fearing outright ruin, several regional laboratories have already raced to sue BCBS in
a desperate attempt to reverse the BlueCard policy and escape the massive fallout that they otherwise expect. Their
own panic devastatingly obvious, the plaintiffs warn of widespread casualties throughout the industry -- with “even
the most distinguished reference labs” weathering painful blows, “hundreds of molecular and specialty labs” failing
altogether and “the entire molecular industry” soon vanishing for good.


No wonder Bio-Reference started acting like some frantic last-minute shopper over the recent holiday season. Just
weeks after Bio-Reference boldly predicted yet another blockbuster year, forecasting a 15% surge in revenue
despite a potential dive in BCBS payments that could erase those projected gains, the company suddenly took
a radical detour from its regular strategy by splurging on a couple of obscure labs far away from its Northeastern
base. During a rare shopping trip that caught little (if any) attention from analysts distracted by the festive
holidays, Bio-Reference blew almost $9 million – roughly one-third of the cash in its bank account – on a pair of labs
down in Florida and specifically cited their local BCBS contracts as a primary reason.


Since Bio-Reference never even bothered to mention the pesky BlueCard change to its investors, long accustomed
to blowout financial results, the company better hope that it can somehow land enough extra business in Florida to
offset the potential losses that it faces in elsewhere throughout the country.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 196/226


CLSR OTCBB 09/24/12 $6.06 $2.56 -58%


ZERO OTCBB 09/25/12 $1.89 $0.48 -75%


PRTN OTCBB 09/26/12 $0.47 $0.01 -98%

OSGIQ Pink Sheet 11/26/12 $0.91 $0.63 -31%





Each and every one of our reports has contributed to a profit with an average decline of 71% from the time of
publication. Today, we present our highest conviction exposé yet highlighting folly in the form of a significant
valuation bubble.  More importantly, we present -- with the help of a whistleblower -- very serious allegations of
unscrupulous and potentially fraudulent activity on the part of NASDAQ-listed Cyberonics, Inc.  (NASDAQ:
CYBX). These detailed allegations have been documented in an amended complaint filed by the whistleblower
in Massachusetts Federal Court  just a week ago on January 16, 2013.  


This is the first time these allegations and this lawsuit are being disclosed to the investing public, as the
company failed to do so even as the original complaint was filed on August 8, 2012 -- well within the disclosure
period of the last 10Q. 


CYBX: Our Highest Conviction and Most Asymmetric Expose Yet


In this report, we present the culmination of nearly two months of research into Cyberonics, Inc. which resulted in
our belief that the Company will never grow into its current $1.5 billion valuation in the bull case and may decline by
80% in the bear case should any of the allegations in the whistleblower suit be proven in federal court.


We will start by objectively reviewing the science behind the CYBX device in an effort to understand whether the
device actually works or is simply being marketed by the Company as the end-all treatment for various medical
conditions. 


Next, we will provide an analysis on the effectiveness of the treatment for depression (a new frontier the company
has been touting for years). This analysis is important, as the analyst community is currently relying on growth in the
depression market to rationalize a mathematically irreconcilable share valuation. 


Finally, we will unveil the very serious whistleblower allegations which we believe reveal the missing piece in the
puzzle of the CYBX business model: Cyberonics management team incentivizes its sales organization to engage in
unscrupulous and potentially deadly behavior all in an effort to juice its top-line revenue, while insiders sell
unprecedented amounts of stock into the market.  


We will end the report with three valuation assumptions for CYBX -- bull, base and bear -- that incorporate all the
qualitative and quantitative data in this report.

PSS World Medical: Prognosis Undetermined


PSS World Medical (NASDAQ: PSSI) is a shopaholic with more than 100 acquired companies under its belt and a
recurring need to reinvent itself to try to keep up with the competition.


The distributor of bed pans, medicine and similar items is lugging around heavy debt - and the torment of posting its
lowest net income in 25 straight quarters. 


A forensic accountant who reviewed some of the Jacksonville, Fla.-based company's documents also pointed out
some scars in its finances.


"It wouldn't surprise me if the company was trying to hide something," said Keith Mautner, a San Diego, Calif.-based
forensic accountant.


"They're doing things companies that engage in fraud also do, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are engaging
in fraud themselves," Mautner added.


PSSI, market cap $1.1 billion, distributes medical products primarily to doctors' offices, but also long-term care and
assisted living facilities, and home health-care and hospice providers. 


PSSI management did not return telephone calls requesting an interview with TheStreetSweeper.


Some PSSI issues that deserve closer examination:


* Falling profits; history of missed estimates 


* Failed buy-out shears shareholders, fires up concerns


* Heavy debt


* Restructuring bothers analysts

* Some analysts downgrade


* Losing out to big competitors


* Inadequate hospital distribution 


* Insiders selling





Falling Net Income and Long History of Missed Estimates 


It's been a long, long time - 25 quarters - since PSSI has reported such dismal net income. The company's income
fell to $10.7 million this past quarter. That profit - damaged by increased general and selling expenses, plus new
acquisitions - compares with about $20 million in each of the previous three quarters.


Investors have to look way back to June 2008 to find income that dipped as low. The income dropped to $9.4 million
then.


And PSSI continues to fall short of Wall Street expectations again and again. The company has missed revenue
estimates for the last five quarters in a row and missed on earnings per share for the past three quarters, recently
posting 18 cents actual versus 21 cents expected. 


In an email to TheStreetSweeper from Goldman Sachs, it's clear that one of the world's largest investment banks
does not like the direction PSS is headed, either. Goldman maintained its "sell" rating recently and lowered its
estimates of the company's future performance. 


"After reporting both a top-and bottom-line miss, it is difficult to gain increased conviction in the company's ability to
meet both its near and long-term goals in a clearly still difficult environment," analyst Robert Jones wrote in the
research report emailed to TheStreetSweeper. 


"Although management made no changes to the long-term outlook for the company, we believe investors will be
looking for several quarters of positive performance before better understanding the growth trajectory."


Goldman lowered 2013 earnings estimates from $1.14 down to $1.05. The 2014 estimate dropped to $1.30 from
$1.55, and the 2015 expectation dropped to $1.37 from $1.65.


"We make no change to our Sell rating, as the quarter does little to change our fundamental view of the company
and industry at this point," Jones continued.


Other analysts are also debating whether PSSI can really pull off the $1.11 to $1.15 earnings per share that
management has guided them to expect for its fiscal year 2013.


"The continuing operations earnings number was 18 cents ..." Larry Marsh, Barclays Capital analyst said during a
recent conference call. "Obviously, if you back out the first quarter (looking at $1.11 to $1.15 earnings) … that would
imply you got to do $0.30 to $0.35 a quarter for the next three quarters. You are confirming that that's very much
doable based on results today?"


"Yes," PSSI chief financial officer David Bronson said. 


He also conceded that there will likely be some "choppiness" in results over the next few quarters as the company
completes divestitures, reorganizes, adds to sales efforts and restructures its shared service support.


A New York City doctor who views PSS from the customer's standpoint sums up his take on the situation more
bluntly.


"This is a desperate company," said the urologist, who wants to remain anonymous and is short PSSI.

Tangoe: Dancing on an Old Grave, Digging a New Hole?


* Editor's Note: The following story is the first installment in a two-part investigative report on Tangoe
(Nasdaq: TNGO), with the second article scheduled to soon follow.


Talk about tricky moves. As a young public company with a tainted leadership team and
an expensive shopping habit, Tangoe (Nasdaq: TNGO) could have easily tripped over tough questions alone by
now. So far, however, Tangoe has spent more than a full year successfully dancing around a maze of potential
landmines.


While the previous company led by its CEO and CFO literally exploded – with the pair directly blamed for that
notorious collapse – and its growth depends more heavily on acquisitions than management likes to
admit, records indicate, Tangoe has yet to stumble even once since it burst onto the stage. A $20 highflier, in fact,
Tangoe trades at a rich premium when compared to both the general sector overall and the specific multiples that it
has paid for the companies it keeps buying to fuel its amazing growth.


Hatched a dozen years ago just as the first public company long steered by its top executives approached death,
Tangoe specializes in the niche arena known as telecommunications expense management (TEM). In a nutshell,
Tangoe basically promises notable reductions in a major ongoing business expense by using a technology-driven
system designed to shrink the bloated bills that companies often receive for everything from Internet to landline and
cell phone services.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 198/226


Currently in the midst of a muscular growth spurt, Tangoe has spent the past two years gobbling up smaller
players that resemble itself in order to further bulk up its own share of that tasty market. That feast has cost a
fortune, however, with growth-hungry investors footing much of the tab along the way.


Tapping the capital markets twice in the span of just 10 months, records show, Tangoe has raised a combined $100
million (after fees) and effectively spent most of that to fuel the very growth that makes its stock look so appetizing in
the first place. In a shopping frenzy that began around the festive season and never really stopped, records show,
Tangoe has managed to run up a bill totaling more than $75 million on acquisitions so far (not counting the $4 million
owed on previous deals) and still remains on the hunt for even more.


Because of that expensive (and often risky) growth strategy, Tangoe looks an awful lot like the so-called “rollup”
companies that have by now given investors plenty of reason for alarm. 


As the last acquisition-driven company examined by TheStreetSweeper has already proven, those highfliers can
sometimes crash in spectacular fashion. Just look at Swisher Hygiene (Nasdaq: SWSH) for some timely evidence.
The stock chart for that rollup company tells a horror story (briefly summarized later) all by itself.

Medivation: Intoxicating Rally ... Imminent Hangover?


Until Medivation (Nasdaq: MDVN) can actually produce a commercial drug that lives up to the hype – now at levels
that suggest a looming blockbuster even bigger than the market that it aims to serve – it will remain the
same overvalued company it has always been since its 2004 debut on the penny-stock exchange. A highflier trading
on the mere promise of a breakthrough treatment ever since it originally went public, utilizing a reverse-merger
process long associated with pump-and-dump scams, Medivation has still yet to introduce a single product to the
marketplace.


Despite the miserable failure of its original drug candidate, a Russian antihistamine fruitlessly tested for years as a
treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, Medivation has staged a phenomenal comeback. Thanks to promising late-stage
trials of its remaining prospect, a prostate cancer drug that allows dying patients to live a few weeks longer than rival
breakthroughs on the market, Medivation already looks like a remarkable success. With its stock exploding from $15
to a recent all-time high of almost $90 a share, Medivation has managed to achieve a $3 billion market value well
ahead of the long-awaited launch of its very first drug.


To Wall Street, the new Medivation treatment obviously seems like a valuable breakthrough. To urologists who
spoke with TheStreetSweeper, however, that medication looks like just another temporary fix with an outsized
sticker price.


“Most of these drugs tend to cost around $100,000,” one doctor emphasized. “That’s a lot of money for a few
months of life.”


A former member of the Medivation board actually shares that point of view. While Medivation has yet to publicly
announce the price of its new prostate cancer drug, Enzalutamide (previously MDV3100), the former director pegs
the cost around $120,000 – higher even than an expensive rival and more than double the reported cost of a similar
drug – while portraying the benefits as limited at best. He suspects that health insurers could easily reach a similar
conclusion, restricting coverage of a six-figure drug that results in even steeper medical bills for terminal cancer
patients, with that push-back ultimately curtailing sales.


By now, Dendreon (Nasdaq: DNDN) has already tested the same market – with miserable results – by charging
anenormous price for a breakthrough prostate cancer treatment of its own. When Dendreon first secured approval of
its $93,000 Provenge cancer vaccine two years ago, Reuters noted, bullish analysts automatically expected the
drug to achieve blockbuster status. With doctors reluctant to even order the vaccine because of its gigantic sticker
price, however, Dendreon soon lost its popularity on Wall Street and ultimately emerged as an outcast. 


A former $55 highflier that peaked shortly after regulators cleared its first (and only) drug, Dendreon now languishes
insingle-digit territory at just $7 a share.


Medivation currently trades at even loftier levels on the promise of a rival drug that may cost even more, but its
former director wonders just how long that gigantic premium can last. While he fully expects the company to secure
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market its new therapy, he still views Medivation as a $20
stock and nothing more.


“Look, I think it’s the most overpriced pharma stock out there,” he bluntly told TheStreetSweeper after selling his
own shares. “I don’t know what’s holding that stock up.”

Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' with Borrowed Wings?


Editor's Note: The second article in this two-part report on Jive Software, which provides more detailed
coverage of the risks posed by the looming release of its restricted stock and deeper analysis of its financial
results, appears directly below this story.
 
Jive Software (Nasdaq: JIVE) may look incredibly hip right now, as a standout performer in the popular social media
space, but the company largely owes a short-term “sympathy rally” – trumpeted by a suspicious firm that placed a
bet on its stock – for its superstar status.


After debuting as a hot new Internet play last December, when it jumped 25% at the opening bell, Jive soon lost its
early sizzle and spent more than a month simply trying to hold onto its original gains. That pattern continued until
early February, when Facebook registered for its initial public offering and set off an explosion that ignited
even long-shot players in the field. Jive itself finally caught on fire at that point, a notorious stock

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 199/226


promoter loudly broadcasting its outsized gains, and spent two full months on a flight due north that took its stock all
the way from $15 to $28 a share.


Jive executives now look incredibly rich as a result. They control almost a third of those highflying shares, records
indicate, with the two young cofounders – who established Jive while in their early 20s (before Facebook
revolutionized the entire industry) – boasting a combined net worth of more than $300 million all by themselves.


Since introducing its “Jive Engage” social networking platform to the business world five years ago, however, the
company itself has yet to earn a dime.


“Apparently, there is inherent value in any software company that has the word ‘social’ included in their business
summary,” a Motley Fool contributor marveled back when Jive first escaped from the powerful forces of gravity.
“But what has changed? (And) what will happen once the FB hysteria settles down?”

Jive Software: Current Star, Future Wallflower?


Editor's Note: The first article in this two-part report on Jive Software, which examines the hype-powered
rally that set the stock on fire as a Facebook "sympathy play," appears directly above this story.
 
Talk about fancy moves. Before Jive Software (Nasdaq: JIVE) finally stumbled a few weeks ago, hammered by a
wave of selling pressure that could dramatically escalate from here, the bleeding social media company danced all
the wayfrom $14 to $28 a share – virtually doubling in a brief 70-day span – without any major breakthroughs on its
part. Jive instead relied on a powerful “sympathy rally” for most of those huge gains, records indicate, suddenly
exploding to life after Facebook announced plans for an initial public offering that temporarily shifted attention away
from its own plight. (See the main story above for a detailed review of that hyped-up rally.)


Since Jive itself went public barely five short months ago, the company faces a looming overhang that could soon
pound its richly valued shares. When Jive carried out its IPO late last year, past news coverage reveals, the
company originally released less than one-quarter of its shares onto the public market and subjected the vast
majority of its stock to trading restrictions that will expire very soon. 


Come June, records indicate, Jive could see roughly 38 million additional shares of company stock – much of it
originally priced around $5 a share or less – start pouring into the marketplace. With Jive currently fetching almost
$24 a share on the open market, where daily trading volume averages around 500,000 shares (the equivalent of just
1.3% ofthe restricted shares set for release), the stock looks rather vulnerable to say the least.


Jive actually took an early hit before its lockup period officially expired, a familiar pattern among young Internet
stocks– such as Zynga (Nasdaq: ZNGA), Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) and even current standout LinkedIn
(Nasdaq: LNKD) – that enjoyed temporary honeymoons after their celebrated public offerings last year. While Jive
maintained its stamina longer than some other newcomers to the sector, records show, the stock finally reversed
course about a month ago. Jivelost 20% of its value in the weeks that followed, shedding much of that during
a heavy two-day selling spree, with the share count in its freely trading “float” somehow expanding (despite
continued lockup restrictions) along the way.


Two venture capital firms control most of that restricted stock, records indicate, with both of them already recording
massive returns on their investments at this point. Corporate insiders sit on a mountain of cheap restricted stock as
well,records show, including a CFO who previously kept the books for a pair of young highfliers that soon
collapsed and vanished from the stock market as the result of fire sales.


Last month, as Jive itself finally weakened under the pressure of an early selling spree, cautious investors
started bracing for a serious meltdown.


“JIVE is one of the few IPOs holding up,” one investor noted last month, shortly after cutting his own stake in the
company. “Gotta feeling its days are numbered.”

Sunpeaks (SNPK): Will This Hot Stock Go up in Flames?
Editor’s Note: TheStreetSweeper has prepared a more comprehensive report on Sunpeaks Ventures (SNPK)
and the promotion of its stock, which can be accessed by clicking here.


Sunpeaks Ventures (OTC: SNPK.OB) may sport a humongous $725 million market value right now, but it’s still the
same dinky vitamin distributor that captured little business – or attention – before AwesomePennyStocks decided
to aggressively pump up its shares. A bleeding company with just $3,562 in revenue at the time of its latest financial
report, Sunpeaks operates from an “executive office” that resembles a garage and peddles a vitamin supplement
that costs three times as much as a similar product found on the shelves of CVS drugstores today.


As is often the case in the microcap arena, of course, the SNPK story is more about the extraordinary promotion of
the stock than it is about the company itself. Until recently, SNPK remained an empty Nevada shell with plenty of
stock – some 370 million shares – but no real business yet at all. 


SNPK morphed into a vitamin seller a couple of months ago, however, with its stock bursting onto the market a few
weeks later in a flurry of trading activity. Although SNPK initially rose just 1 cent to 43 cents a share on March 8, its
opening day of trade, it enjoyed massive volume from the start, with 160 million shares of the stock instantly
changing hands. 


At that point, AwesomePennyStocks – the most powerful promoter in the business – had just begun touting SNPK to
a vast network of subscribers who soon rushed to scoop up the brand-new shares. Barely one month later, with 50
promoters in charge of 351 different newsletters pumping the stock, SNPK has literally quadrupled in price and now
commands $1.70 a share.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 200/226


Like a select group of early investors, Whetu Inc. – a mysterious Panamanian firm that inherited a big chunk of
SNPKas it emerged from its empty shell -- now sits on an outright fortune as a result. After issuing a modest
$110,000 promissory note to SNPK last summer, records show, Whetu wound up with 50 million of its highflying
shares. That stock, if sold at current prices, would command a whopping $85 million today.

Questcor: The Secret behind Its 'Miracle' Drug
* Editor’s Note: The following article is the second installment in a two-part investigative series on Questcor
Pharmaceuticals that began earlier this week. The original story can be found just below this one on the
homepage.





Thanks to patients like Garry Sefcovic, who suffer from a common form of multiple sclerosis punctuated
by debilitating “flares,” Questcor (Nasdaq: QCOR) has seen orders for its only major product – an old drug viewed
as worthless by its previous owners -- literally explode in recent years.


Yet Sefcovic, for one, wishes that he had never even tried that high-priced drug. Last winter, when he sought
treatment for a painful MS flare, Sefcovic assumed that he would receive the same cheap IV steroids that had
effectively relieved his condition in the past. He wound up seeing a different neurologist, however, who automatically
prescribed Acthar Gel – sold by Questcor for a whopping $27,000 per dose – to address his MS flare instead.


“I have good insurance and a chronic disease fund that will pay my deductible,” Sefcovic noted when speaking
withTheStreetSweeper late last year. “They made a lot of money off of me.


“Then they had to give me steroid pills after the Acthar,” he added. “I should have just been put on the IV steroids
right away.”


Several giant health insurance companies – such as Aetna (NYSE: AET), Cigna (NYSE: CI) and Blue Cross/Blue
Shield (BCBS) – would clearly share that reasoned point of view. In fact, as a matter of policy, they officially
mandate IV steroids as a first-line treatment for MS flares and normally refuse to cover Acthar for patients who can
rely on that cheaper therapy instead.


Notably, Sefcovic receives health insurance coverage from a company -- Medical Mutual -- that subjects Acthar to a
careful pre-authorization process as well. Rather than automatically covering Acthar for the treatment of MS
flares,records show, Medical Mutual specifically asks whether the patient “had a FAILURE or INTOLERANCE to
treatment with corticosteroids” in the past and whether the patient is “a candidate to receive treatment with
corticosteroids” at the present time. At that point, records indicate, the insurer then authorizes coverage of Acthar
only for those patients who cannot use traditional steroid therapy to provide them with relief.


In contrast, Questcor has taken a far more liberal stand on those who should qualify for its pricy drug. Reaching
beyond the narrow population of outright steroid failures, records indicate, Questcor also markets Acthar for other
MS patients who simply fail to achieve the same “baseline function” that they enjoyed before their flare-ups
occurred. Since many MS victims fall short of this success (as illustrated by the progressive nature of their disease),
critics feel, Questcor has effectively repositioned Acthar as a first-line treatment for many patients who should
receive cheaper steroid therapy instead.


Despite the clear restrictions placed on Acthar for the treatment of MS flares – the primary condition addressed by
that medication today -- Questcor has achieved remarkably high reimbursement rates for its obscure drug. Even
though Questcor has seen its coverage rate for Acthar slip over the past couple of years (declining from between
90% and 95% to “generally above 85%” in the latest quarter), records indicate, health insurers continue to pay the
vast majority of those expensive medication claims.


That said, however, Sefcovic clearly feels that his own insurance company wasted a pile of money on an overpriced
– and ultimately ineffective -- drug that he should have never even received.


“I actually would have preferred steroid treatments first, as I’ve always done in the past,” he said in a follow-up email
toTheStreetSweeper earlier this week. “I lose a lot of faith in doctors this way.”

Questcor: A Bold Strategy Threatened by the Fine Print?
* Editor’s Note: The following article is the first story in a two-part investigative report on Questcor
Pharmaceuticals, with the second installment currently scheduled for release by the end of this week. To
receive immediate notification when the second article appears, click on this link to sign up for a free email
alert.


As a longtime nephrologist, Dr. Gerald Stephanz felt somewhat surprised when a sales representative suggested
that H.P. Acthar Gel – a 60-year-old drug marketed by Questcor Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: QCOR) – might help
some of the patients he treats for kidney-related disorders. 


Stephanz had last used Acthar decades earlier, when caring for a patient suffering from multiple sclerosis during his
residency, and had practically forgotten about the ancient medication since that time. He did remember that Acthar
had once sold at a relatively cheap price, however, and that it had largely fallen out of favor after powerful IV
steroids –embraced as a superior alternative – arrived on the scene. So the new price tag for Acthar (more than
$25,000 a dose) and the new focus on nephrology (without solid clinical data) struck him as rather odd, to say the
least.


Stephanz, for one, saw no compelling reason to try the expensive drug. He also felt offended by the “aggressive
tactics” that led to a follow-up sales pitch at his office.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 201/226


“The second time, they kind of ambushed me,” recalled Stephanz, who holds a board-level position with the Renal
Physicians Association. “That’s when they tried to explain why the drug costs so much. 


“They have this package they give you,” he explained. “But the label doesn’t have any specific indication for any
treatable kidney disease that I can see … How are they going to market this?”


By capitalizing on its high price (raised 1,300% literally overnight) and its broad label (approved in 1952 based on its
perceived safety alone), Questcor hopes to transform Acthar into a true blockbuster drug. Questcor views Acthar as
afull-blown pipeline, in fact, relying on that single medication for virtually all of its current revenue and its forecasted
growth as well. 


Although Questcor reportedly paid just $100,000 for worldwide rights to Acthar – a product abandoned by its
previous owners as a hopeless money-loser – the company now charges up to $250,000 for a single course of
treatment utilizing that once-neglected drug. All told, Wall Street estimates, Questcor sold more than $210 million
worth of Acthar in 2011 and – if recent growth trends prove sustainable – will likely see that total soar past $330
million over the course of the current year.


Questcor originally re-priced Acthar as an orphan drug used for an ultra-rare disease, records show, but the
company now derives most of its revenue from soaring prescriptions for more widespread medical problems
instead. In recent years, Questcor has dramatically expanded the market for Acthar by promoting it as a second-line
treatment for patients who suffer from a common type of multiple sclerosis punctuated by debilitating flares.
(TheStreetSweeper focuses primarily on that core market in the second part of this investigative report.) Inspired by
that growth – driven in large part, former insiders say, by heavy prescribers who can pocket unlimited “speaker fees”
for promoting the drug to others in the field -- Questcor has set out to replicate that success by pitching Acthar
for another medical condition as well.


Last week, however, Questcor dropped a potential bombshell about this promising frontier. 


Questcor has routinely stated that it can market Acthar as an “on-label” treatment for nephrotic syndrome – including
a specific kidney disease related to NS known as idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) – and even announced
plans, earlier this month, to double the number of sales reps focused on this profitable arena. That sales team has
already generated plenty of new business for the company in the meantime, records show, with Acthar prescriptions
for NS rocketing 145% (on a sequential basis) in the fourth quarter of 2011 alone. Less than a year after
aggressively breaking into this brand-new market -- where each patient represents a handsome six-figure
opportunity -- Questcor now counts NS as its biggest, and its most lucrative, growth driver by far.


While Questcor has long indicated that it can freely market Acthar for this condition (and has funded a minor
study,focused on iMN, that serves as a critical sales aid), however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
expressed a far more conservative view on this important matter. 


“The approval of this product for this particular use predates the modern FDA ‘efficacy’ requirement,” the agency
noted in an email to TheStreetSweeper earlier this month. “For that reason, we feel that it is best to stick to the
exact wording used in the label (i.e., induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria) and not say that they treat the
disease.”

Universal Display: A Real Work of (Prior) Art?


* Editor's Note: TheStreetSweeper published its original investigative report on Universal Display (PANL) in
October, when it took a close look at key changes in the company's long-term relationship with Samsung --
its largest source of commercial revenue by far -- and the flurry of insider sales that surrounded that
important top-secret deal. Click here to access that earlier article.
 
When Universal Display Corporation (Nasdaq: PANL) originally patented the core technology that now ranks as its
primary asset, historical records clearly suggest, the company simply combined two existing inventions and then
celebrated the resulting “breakthrough” as its own.
For its part, UDC has long proclaimed that its research partners at Princeton University first discovered modern
organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology in the late 1990s and then went on to develop the actual OLED
materials that now illuminate the display screens of some popular handheld devices found on the market today. In
fact, however, outside researchers actually reported similar achievements years before UDC ever arrived on the
scene. Armed with evidence of that “prior art,” UDC rivals now hope to severely weaken – if not completely
destroy – the broad OLED patents secured by the company. 


From the start, UDC has basically relied on two early patents to serve as the foundation for its entire portfolio. The
first established the design of its fundamental technology, known as the “OLED stack,” while the second covered the
special “emitter” compounds – since limited to iridium by patent authorities overseas – that generate the light in
OLED-powered screens. By the time that UDC received (or even requested) those far-reaching patents, however,
others had already documented similar breakthroughs in the field.


UDC did not respond to questions for this story.


Phillips Electronics actually patented a multilevel OLED stack back in the mid-1990s, records show, some two years
before UDC followed up by presenting that same type of design. Moreover, when Phillips described the core
elements of its invention in 1995, the company used the same kind of language – at times almost identical in nature
– that UDC would later include in a related patent issued to the company six years down the road. 


Phillips is now challenging a European version of that UDC patent overseas, records show, using its own patent
(along with the early research of others) to portray its smaller rival as a glorified copycat. In a nutshell, Phillips
argues, UDC secured an unfair patent – based upon technology that “is not new” and “does not involve an inventive
step” – that the company arguably should have never received at all.


Similarly, records indicate, UDC followed in the footsteps of others when formulating the “unique” OLED emitter
materials – specifically those derived from iridium --covered in its second major patent as well. Long before UDC
showcased this development, records show, outsiders had already traveled down that same path by establishing the

first highlighted this breakthrough two full decades ago, in fact, with a separate group of scientists further advancing
that discovery – using iridium to create light at room temperature this time – that same year.

RAYS of Sunshine ... or Clouds of Doom?
Raystream (OTC: RAYS.OB) recently began lighting up the skies of Pennyland by proclaiming that it had developed
a new video-compression technology that outshines anything on the market today. In reality, however, Raystream
appears to be selling open-source software – available at no charge – to anyone who wishes to use it. That
software, known as “x264,” can be downloaded here for free.


Raystream burst into the spotlight with the help of an aggressive promotional campaign financed by an outfit known
as Unlimited Trade, which also furnished startup money for the company. In a striking coincidence, covered in more
detail below, Raystream and Unlimited Trade share a common link with a once-famous – but now-fallen – German
Wunderkind named Tan Siekmann.  


When Raystream began trading under its current symbol this fall, the company issued a press release introducing
the public to its video compression software. At the time, Raystream CEO Brian Peterson proudly declared that the
company’s “disruptive technology could forever alter the way business is done online.” The announcement further
explained that this “proprietary” technology “could reduce the bandwidth required to stream HD video online by up to
70%.”


The next day, Raystream revised that figure to “up to 90%” and revealed that – thanks to a generous infusion from
Unlimited Trade – the company now had almost $2 million in cash on hand. Raystream and its promoters spent the
weeks that followed celebrating the importance of this technology, boldly predicting that it was likely to unleash a
torrent of demand.


So who, exactly, is the genius responsible for this magical breakthrough? The CEO runs a Dallas-based digital
signage company known as Peterson-Hines and, upon joining Raystream, brought most of his staff from that
firm (who worked as salespeople) along with him. Only Raystream Chief Information Officer Roman Rumpf and his
sidekick Thomas Friedl, who heads the company’s German subsidiary, appear to have any real technology
experience. 


More importantly, just how “proprietary” is Raystream’s video-compression technology? Not at all, it appears. On its
website, Raystream invites the public to view a slick video that illustrates the technology’s capabilities. While no
technology publication has reviewed -- or even discussed -- the Raystream software, a few techies took an interest
in itand then took a close look at that video as well.


With little effort, they made a remarkable discovery. They found that the Raystream source code begins like this:
x264 - core 112 - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - Copyleft 2003-2010.


In a nutshell, that code reveals that Raystream “created” its technology using x264 – an open-source video-
compression encoder based on the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec – that serves as the industry standard. Comically
enough, Raystream never even bothered to change any of the default parameters included in that sequence.


Jason Garret-Glaser, one of the developers behind x264, told TheStreetSweeper that Raystream could have better
concealed its secret by simply removing the header that included the telling “x264” within it. Thanks to that
oversight, however, that four-digit introductory code jumps out as the first thing that anyone who examines the code
will see.

Bio-Reference (BRLI): Loads of Dirty Laundry
* Editor’s Note: The following article is the second story in a two-part series on Bio-Reference Laboratories.
Click hereto access the first article.


Back when Bio-Reference Laboratories (Nasdaq: BRLI) first began to capitalize on the growing market for lucrative
specialty tests, the company installed a new executive – later accused of demanding “envelopes full of cash” from
his underlings – to help oversee its big expansion plans.


Bio-Reference employed former Vice President of Sales John Littleton for the better part of a decade – delivering
record numbers to Wall Street along the way -- before finally terminating him in early 2009 over suspected violations
that had, by then, apparently dragged on for years. At that point, Bio-Reference itself calculated, Littleton had
improperly collected a staggering $1.6 million by abusing his expense account and collecting secret bounties for
recruiting new employees to the company. Although Bio-Reference ordered Littleton to forfeit that mountain of cash
(pocketing funds allegedly owed to its extorted sales representatives instead), records show, the lab curiously
stopped short of filing actual charges against him.


“BRL brought no criminal prosecution of Littleton, though his actions were self-evidently criminal,” court filings state.
Moreover, “it did not inform its shareholders of the details of his actions …


“BRL simply accepted the $1.6 million – the proceeds of extortion – without returning any of it to the victims of the
scheme,” the documents add. “In fact, Senior Vice President of Sales Charles Todd laughingly announced at a
meeting of sales managers that BRL had just lowered its overhead by $1.6 million” as a result of that big payment.


A regular magnet for con men back in its early days, Barron’s observed this year, Bio-Reference has long blamed
its checkered past on honest mistakes made by a young and naïve company. Even as a well-established laboratory,
however, Bio-Reference has apparently failed to break free of that familiar pattern.


Bio-Reference still employed Littleton less than three years ago, for example, while the company continues to
embrace Todd – accused of ignoring (and possibly joining) his former aide’s extortion scheme – as one of its most

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story

important leaders to this day. The company has installed an outright felon in its executive suite as
well, records show, granting him the second-largest compensation package awarded to any member of its senior
management team. Bio-Reference even faces some lingering ties to organized crime, court records indicate, with
a suspected Gambino associate recently filing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the lab for allegedly breaking its
promise to resume paying him once he got out of jail.

Is Bio-Reference Laboratories as Healthy as It Seems?


* Editor's Note: The following story is the first article in a two-part investigative report on Bio-Reference
Laboratories (BRLI), with the second installment scheduled for publication next week. Readers who have
signed up for our free email alerts, open to newcomers who fill out this form, will be immediately notified
when the next article appears.
 
Three years ago, Bio-Reference Laboratories (Nasdaq: BRLI) introduced an elaborate – and expensive – version of
the standard pap smear that has since become a celebrated, if controversial, driver of growth for the company.
With that test, known as GenPap, Bio-Reference greatly expanded the scope of a routine screening tool used on
more than 50 million American women each year. By the time that GenPap hit the market, however, gynecologists
had already spent decades effectively utilizing traditional pap smears and (if warranted) cheap supplemental tests to
diagnose the most prevalent disorders suffered by the patients they treat.


While those mainstream laboratory tests narrowly focus on a handful of widespread conditions, singled out as
relevantby government authorities, GenPap screens for about 20 different organisms (some of them viewed as
harmless) linked to both common and rare disorders alike. In fact, as detailed more extensively below, at least one
of those 14 ailments -- virtually absent except for occasional cases in a limited number of states -- barely registers
as a disease in this country at all. 


Nevertheless, Bio-Reference promotes GenPap as a valuable test for “essentially all women” and employs an
aggressivenationwide sales force to court the doctors who take care of them. Although Bio-Reference has
reported explosive growth in its young women’s health division since launching GenPap, however, even some fans
of the test question its suitability for such a broad swath of the female population.


“I use it selectively,” says Dr. John Siegle, a veteran obstetrician/gynecologist who trains third-year residents in the
field. “It’s very, very pricey and not really cost-effective for society.


“If used selectively and appropriately, there is a place for it,” he adds. But “they’re pushing us to do this on
everybody. (And) that can’t – that shouldn’t – be done.”

Universal Display (PANL): Sharp Rise, Fuzzy Picture
For a company that likes to brag about the sharp images created by its superior technology, Universal Display
Corporation (Nasdaq: PANL) sure has painted a fuzzy picture for investors who helped recharge its fading stock. 


Less than two months ago, PANL had fallen below $25 a share – down sharply from the $63 peak it achieved this
spring – on fears about a crucial contract used by Wall Street to assess the potential value of the company. PANL
had by then spent more than a year simply extending its original contract with Samsung, its largest commercial
customer by far, collecting royalty payments for use of patented technology that ranks as the smaller company’s
primary asset. WhileGoldman Sachs and other bullish followers of the stock widely expected a jump in that royalty
rate under a renegotiated deal, however, PANL ultimately revealed that the company would no longer receive royalty
payments from the giant cell phone maker at all.


PANL nevertheless soared 85% the week the company announced that new long-term agreement, adding $1 billion
to its market value in the span of five short days, with analysts mistakenly assuming that PANL would continue to
receive royalty payments – but at an even higher rate – until the company itself ultimately proved them wrong.
According to aheavily redacted version of that important contract, stripped free of any financials terms that would
expose the true value of the deal, PANL will receive a mere “license fee” from Samsung – rather than royalties
based on actual sales of products using its patented technology – and (unspecified) revenue from chemical sales to
the giant electronics company going forward.


In other words, that contract indicates, PANL may never capitalize on the popularity of Samsung smart
phones featuring the Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) technology that has long been viewed as the key to its
own future success. 


“While terms were omitted, it is clear that the Samsung deal is a license agreement” and not a royalty-based
agreement,Canaccord Genuity analyst Jonathan Dorsheimer conceded after PANL finally released an actual
contract that reversed his earlier view. “Details are limited and are being kept to few senior executives at both SMD
(Samsung Mobile Display) and UDC (Universal Display Corporation). Both parties believe they prevailed in the
terms of the agreement, none of which where disclosed in the 8K” that included the heavily redacted contract.


PANL failed to answer questions for this story.


Notably, records indicate, PANL suffered a major legal setback that could have seriously weakened its own
negotiating power – while bolstering that held by Samsung – when the two parties hammered out the terms of
that long-delayedagreement. Back in late March, records show, the Japanese Patent Office invalidated all of the
claims covered under two important PANL patents that had previously protected the company’s OLED technology
and required Samsung to pay royalties based on sales of its OLED-enabled devices. While PANL escaped an
immediate hit on that overlooked court ruling, with the stock actually soaring to a record high above $63 a share the
very next week, it began to spiral lowerafter The Korea Times – an English-language newspaper in the country
where Samsung is based – stepped forward topublicize the development.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 204/226


Barely a month after that foreign newspaper article appeared, gradually catching the attention of PANL bears in the
weeks that followed, the stock had fallen to just half the record price that it had boasted in the spring. PANL
continued to lose ground throughout most of the summer, sinking below $25 in early August, but the stock suddenly
began toreverse course as the company finally neared the end of its drawn-out negotiations with Samsung.


PANL soared 24% to almost $35 a share the day before the company even announced that new agreement, a
strikingjump on massive volume that would soon raise eyebrows at CNBC, and then rocketed straight past $40 on
official news of the long-awaited deal. Although Wall Street rushed to celebrate that vague announcement as a big
victory for PANL, however, The Korea Times took the opposite stand by portraying Samsung as the likely winner –
poised to save “millions of dollars” in royalty fees – under that new contract instead. 


“The developments could allow firms based in Asia, such as Samsung and LG, to manufacture OLEDs,” one fund
manager stated in the article, “without having to pay royalties to UDC for materials used.”

GORO Stock: Finally Time for Sticker Shock?
Years ago, around the same time that it debuted on the OTC Bulletin Board, Gold Resource Corporation
(AMEX:GORO) hired a young promoter who would later present a detailed valuation formula that – if updated with
even the high end of current production estimates – now suggests that the company’s shares are ridiculously
overpriced.


A recent college graduate when he landed GORO as his first client, records show, Ian Cassel dutifully set out to
publicize the hot new penny stock and (with the company compensating him for his services) quickly became
asignificant shareholder himself. He loudly celebrated the stock for years, touting GORO alongside some risky
small-cap names that included at least one reputed fraud, and -- by his own admission last September – pocketed
big gains as those shares soared ever higher.


At the time that he mentioned his profit-taking, records indicate, Cassel had just published his last big report on
GORO during his final days as a vocal cheerleader for the company. Back then, with GORO fast approaching $20 a
share, Cassel actually suggested that the stock looked somewhat pricey for new investors who had missed out on
the rally that helped fatten his own bank account.


“My cost basis in GORO is $1.35, and I’ve sold a nice chunk along the way, so take that into consideration,” he
allowed a year ago. “I wouldn’t blame anyone for being skeptical about buying at these levels after this run-up.”


(TheStreetSweeper hoped to interview Cassel before publishing this story. It could not locate him, however, because
hedisabled his website earlier this year.)


Cassel sounded a whole lot more confident when he could base his analysis of the stock, which he valued at $22 a
sharealmost two full years ago, on rosy production estimates rather than the actual results that the company would
deliver on down the road. GORO nevertheless flew straight past his target price, eventually peaking above $31 a
share earlier this year, even though the company has yet to approach (let alone achieve) the projected earnings that
served as the basis for that lofty target.


His original formula, when applied to the latest production estimates for 2011 (the company’s first full year of actual
gold production), indicates that GORO should trade for less than half the price that the stock currently enjoys.

GORO: A Rich Gold Miner That Acts Dirt Poor?
Gold Resource Corporation (AMEX: GORO) sure has raised some eyebrows with its curious spending habits. 


Over the years, GORO has splurged on plenty of things – glorified promoters for its stock, hefty compensation for its
insiders, expensive dividends for its shareholders – but the company has regularly cut corners, adopting a downright
thrifty stand, in one critical area. Despite its evolution from a penny-stock company into a $1 billion
corporation trading on a respectable exchange, GORO has long refrained from hiring accomplished experts to
double-check the numbers that power its stock price.


For starters, as highlighted by TheStreetSweeper in a big investigative report already, GORO has yet to invest in a
standard feasibility study that would replace its own bullish production estimates with formally established gold and
silver reserves. The company has taken a frugal approach on other key services as well, records indicate, saving
additional money (while further limiting outside scrutiny) by relying on a cheap auditor and a part-time CFO to
oversee its books. In fact, records show, GORO spent more on the boardroom director who chairs its audit and
compensation committees – identified as a “promoter” in outside corporate filings -- than it did on its auditor or its
CFO last year.


Still, GORO has long rewarded the relatives who serve as its top executives with the biggest compensation
packages of all. The company doubled the six-figure salaries for all three of those relatives last year, records show,
and then further sweetened the deal by issuing them “discretionary” bonuses equal to their newly expanded
salaries. GORO spent more than $2.3 million in cash last year on those three executives, records show, who scored
another $12.5 million by dumping stock (most of it at much higher prices than those seen today) during a
massive insider-selling spree that began just a few months after they snagged their handsome raises.

Will GORO Ever Find That Magic Pot of Gold?
After years of practice, Gold Resource Corporation (AMEX: GORO) has clearly perfected the art of delivering well-
spun news that works magic on the company’s generous share price.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 205/226


Despite a sea of potential red flags -- ranging from undocumented gold reserves to closely related
executives to relentless insider sales -- GORO has managed to become one of the hottest gold stocks on the
market, even though the company has produced very little of that glittering treasure at all. Rather, since going
public in the fall of 2006, GORO has spent most of its time making big promises (sweetened by a handy surge in
gold prices) that it consistently fails to keep. The company has nevertheless seen its stock skyrocket from its original
price of $1.15 to an all-time high of $31.38 earlier this year, settling near $25 currently, with insiders cashing in
millions of dollars worth of profits along the way.


GORO has soared 80% over the course of the past 12 months alone, handily outperforming far more established
and successful gold miners – including industry heavyweights Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG)
and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) – that have racked up much smaller gains, ranging from 3.6% to 23%, on the
steady explosion in gold prices. With a market value of $1.29 billion, GORO is currently trading at a stunning 28
times its prior-year sales. In contrast, GORO’s three giant peers – which measure their profits in the billions – all
sport traditional single-digit price-to-sales ratios instead. 


Moreover, despite the eye-catching gold label included in its name, GORO actually counts silver – a less illustrious
metal that sells at a tiny fraction of gold’s price – as its biggest product by far. Last quarter, for example, GORO sold
just 2,384 ounces of gold – less than Barrick produces (on average) every 15 seconds -- while relying on cheaper
silver for 99% of its overall production during that three-month period. In a rather curious feat, however, GORO
somehow managed to report incredibly high prices for the small pile of gold that the company did happen to sell. 


Specifically, GORO pegged its average gold price at $1,576 an ounce – a peak seen only one day throughout the
entire second quarter -- even though the company has traditionally sold all of its gold to a single customer that, with
any business savvy at all, could have requested volume discounts or simply purchased that gold at cheaper prices
on the regular spot market. In contrast, despite their marketing muscle, the industry’s three largest miners all
reported lower average gold prices (ranging from $1,501 to $1,516 an ounce) for the mountains of gold they sold
during that same period.

Miller: Meltdown Continues for This Once-Hot Oil Stock
Late Friday, with its stock hammered on questions raised by TheStreetSweeper in a big investigative report, Miller
Energy Resources (NYSE: MILL) rushed to soothe nervous investors with a clean – but premature – audit
opinion on a tardy annual report that otherwise looked like an ugly mess.


That formal 10K filing included a crucial blessing from KPMG that lent credibility to financial statements previously
approved only by a tainted small-time auditor, notorious for validating the books of dubious Chinese-reverse merger
companies, instead. Three days later, however, Miller quietly published an 8K on its company website – absent for
up to an hour (or more) from the official website operated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission –
revealing that KPMG had yet to even complete its audit of the financial statements that it had reportedly approved. 
Miller further disclosed that its own audit committee had determined over the weekend, a period marked by hopeful
celebrations among relieved investors, that the company’s brand-new financial statements – as well as the audit
attributed to KPMG and the consent to use that audit report -- “should not be relied upon” because of looming
revisions down the road.


Miller’s stock, which recorded double-digit gains on reports of the audited financials early Monday morning,
soon began to tank on news of the 8k filing before that document even surfaced – where investors could easily find
it – on the SEC website. The shares plummeted from a high of almost $5 to a low beneath the $3 mark, sinking a
total of 42.8% in less than two hours, after the company dropped its alarming bombshell. Although the stock has
since clawed its way back toward $3.50 a share, it still fetches half the price that it
commanded before TheStreetSweeper first exposed Milleras a risky company less than a week ago.


Peter J. Henning, a law professor who formerly served as a senior attorney for the enforcement division of the SEC,
suggested that the company could face even more pain – including possible backlash from securities regulators and
its new auditing firm alike – as a result of its recent actions.


“The SEC is going to notice this,” said Henning, who worked as both a regulator and a prosecutor before assuming
his current post as a law professor focused on white-collar crime at Wayne State University. “You can’t file a 10K
without audited financials; that’s a precondition … I suspect that KPMG will want to know how this happened and, if
they don’t get straight answers, they will be gone.


“It looks like somebody, somewhere, had to have lied,” concluded Henning, who writes a popular column for the
“White-Collar Watch” section of The New York Times. “It’s hard not to draw any conclusion other than that this was
basically fraud.”

Miller Energy: Is This Hot 'Alaska' Stock about to Melt?
Before Miller Energy Resources (NYSE: MILL) purchased some abandoned assets in Alaska for $4.5 million – or
barely half the price that its CEO paid for his sprawling Tennessee mansion – and then pegged the value of those
assets at more than $350 million on its books, the company spent years fruitlessly trying to escape from the penny-
stock arena through smaller deals that often wound up backfiring instead.


Those previous deals triggered serious legal disputes, with one of them crippling Miller for years and another –
while touted as a “huge victory” for the company at the time – since quietly reversed this May on appeal. Miller could
face potentially significant liabilities, far exceeding its modest cash resources, if the company fails to overcome that
recent courtroom setback. Meanwhile, Miller has been slapped with a brand-new lawsuit – this one related to the
Alaska deal itself – seeking piles of warrants for dirt-cheap stock from the company as well.  


Despite that alarming track record, however, Miller has managed to convince investors that the company finally hit
the jackpot – by snagging valuable assets that its previous owners (now bankrupt) initially could not sell – this time
around. Miller’s stock, which fetched mere pennies on the lowly Pink Sheets just a few short years ago, now
commands $7 a share after snagging a coveted spot on the premiere New York Stock Exchange. The company

public through a reverse merger almost 15 years ago.


But experts contacted by TheStreetSweeper, including skeptics in both the energy and financial sectors, have
expressed clear doubt about those numbers. For example, an executive at Nabors Industries (NYSE: NBR) -- a $7.6
billion energy giant that decided against buying those assets for itself -- estimated that Miller actually wound up with
just $25 million to $30 worth of assets, offset by $40 million worth of liabilities, through that transaction instead.


“That deal had been on the Street for over a year; everybody and their brother had looked at it,” said Jordan
“Digger” Smith, who manages energy projects for Nabors – which actually operated Miller’s new properties – all
across the country. “I’m a geologist, with 54 years of experience, and I can’t see how anybody can write that up on
their books for $350 million … There are not $350 million worth of assets there.”

Portage Resources: Selling Fool's Gold with a Smile?
With the help of a powerful stock-promotion campaign, Portage Resources (OTCQB: POTG.PK) – a cash-poor
company ignored by investors for years – has magically transformed itself into a valuable Peruvian miner, sporting
an incredible market capitalization of almost $600 million, in a metaphorical blink of the eye. 


On June 14, records show, POTG closed at a modest 11 cents a share on a quiet (if somewhat typical) trading
session in which no company stock changed hands at all. When POTG reported that the company itself
had changed hands the following day, however, the stock suddenly exploded – almost tripling in price on massive
volume of 34 million shares – and kept soaring all the way past the $1 mark, peaking near $1.15 earlier this week,
even though the dirt-poor company has no more gold or silver than it did when that breathless rally first began.


Under the leadership of its new majority owner, Paul Luna Belfiore (identified in a corporate filing as “Mr.
Belfiore” and elsewhere as simply “Paul Luna” instead), POTG kicked things off with a couple of press releases –
hardly earth-shaking in nature -- that seemed to miraculously revive its near-comatose stock. The first
announcement simply revealed that Luna, portrayed as a mining engineer with decades of experience in Peru, had
taken over as CEO and president of the company. The second, issued the same day, followed up by trumpeting the
company’s plans to focus its mining activities on potentially lucrative opportunities in the South American country of
Peru.


Armed with a $250,000 publicity budget, Capital Financial Media – the backer of massive promotion campaigns for
such ill-fated penny stocks as Clicker (OTC: CLKZ.PK) and Horiyoshi Worldwide (OTC: HHWW.OB) – began to
work its notorious market-moving powers. For the token sum of $1,000, or about double the cash in POTG’s barren
bank account, CFM hired newcomer “Penny Stock Pillager” to quickly issue a bullish report predicting that POTG
could rapidly surge to $3.32 a share and deliver early investors short-term gains of more than 1,100 percent in the
process.


“My advice?” the Penny Stock Pillager remarked. “Stop reading this now, and consider calling your broker or logging
on to your online trading account and grabbing as many shares as you’re comfortable with. You don’t want to find
yourself on the outside looking in on this one.”

CIGX Leader: Blowing Smoke While Investors Choke?
* Editor’s: The following article is the second story in a two-part series. Click here to access the original article.





Give Jonnie Williams, the CEO of recent highflier Star Scientific (Nasdaq: CIGX), some credit. By now, records
indicate, Williams has proven that he can literally sell anything – cars, houses, contact lenses and, above all, risky
medical stocks – even if his customers, particularly investors, often wind up on the losing end of those business
deals.


Over the years, Williams has clearly polished his act. Early on, records show, he found himself sanctioned by
securities regulators for allegedly paying a stock promoter to issue bullish reports on a doomed biotech company
while he was secretly dumping a big chunk of his own shares. Since then, however, he has learned to distance
himself fromaggressive stock promotions that seem to magically erupt (along with his current company’s shares)
without any obvious involvement on his part. 


Take Star, for example, a combination tobacco-biotech play that boasts a market value of $600 million – more than
700 times its prior-year sales – even though the company has spent almost a decade operating in the red. Star
has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, rocketing from $2 to $5 this spring alone and overcoming a
recent slide (which took it back below $3) to climb back toward the $5 mark once again. 


The stock peaked at $5.35 on May 31, when it closed above $5 for the first time in years and paved the way for
Williams to exercise millions of newly issued options – priced below $3 a share – in the process. Williams and his
family already owned more than 20 million shares in the company (including stock options and warrants) even
before that, records show, a massive stake worth almost $100 million based on current market prices. He recently
signaled plans to sell about 1 million of those shares in official corporate filings that registered more than 12 million
shares sold earlier this year, for $2 or less, through the latest in a series of dilutive private placement deals.


Meanwhile, as the top executive of Star – a former cigarette company now pursuing miraculous breakthroughs in
the healthcare arena -- Williams has spent more than a decade refining and perfecting one of his most powerful
sales pitches of all. In the original script, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported long ago, Williams somehow
outsmarts Big Tobacco – with its gigantic research budgets and its fancy Ph.D. scientists – by developing a safer
tobacco-curing process after experimenting with his microwave oven. He then sues industry powerhouse R.J.
Reynolds (NYSE: RAI) for utilizing a similar system, the Associated Press has since explained, seeking massive
damages from the tobacco giant for allegedly infringing on the patents for his remarkable invention.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 207/226


For almost a decade, the Times-Dispatch later noted, that story has served as the primary driver behind Star
shares – alternately sending them above $5 and below $1 – as the dramatic, yet inherently unpredictable, courtroom
fight continues to unfold.


A few years ago, faced with a string of nasty legal setbacks that threatened its very survival, Star essentially
swapped that worn-out script for a more compelling story. In this version, loudly trumpeted by speculative bulls,
Williams has managed to outsmart Big Pharma – once again besting a deep-pocketed industry with massive
research budgets and stables of well-trained scientists – by uncovering a tobacco-based substance that promises
an effective new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.

CIGX: A Hot Tobacco Stock Ignited by Wild Pipe Dreams?
* Editor’s Note: This story is the first in a two-part investigative series, with the second article scheduled to
run after the Fourth of July holiday.





Over the years, regulatory filings show, Star Scientific (Nasdaq: CIGX) has often changed its pretty story -- with the
former cigarette maker now spinning tobacco as the key to breakthrough medical cures – but the company has
rarely changed its ugly numbers. 


Star posted its highest revenue as a discount cigarette maker more than a decade ago, records show, and has
generated dismal sales (and absolutely no profits) ever since shedding that traditional tobacco business. Last year,
for example, Star posted total revenue of just $848,000 – or less than 1% of the $223 million in record 2000 sales it
achieved as a profitable cigarette company – while recording an annual loss (a number that keeps growing) for the
eighth straight year in a row. 


Star nevertheless boasts a market value of almost $600 million, some 35% higher than its peak market value during
the year the company achieved its strongest financial results on record, and currently trades at an astounding 720
times its prior-year sales. If investors assigned Star the same multiple now as they did back then, the company
would sport a market value of just $1.68 million – with its $4.50 stock fetching barely a penny a share – instead.


For years, corporate filings reveal, Star has enjoyed far more success selling its story (and the stock it keeps
issuing in order to stay afloat) than it has at actually selling its unpopular products. Star executed the latest in a
series of private placements during the first quarter of this year, with enough warrants and stock options now
outstanding – at average exercise prices of around $2 a share – to increase the company’s swelling share count,
which totaled less than 60 millionback in 2000, by another 33% to almost 180 million shares. The restrictions on the
last of that cheap stock should expire this September, records indicate, with the shares facing a potential slide
toward $3 unless the company’s handsome market value further expands to absorb that looming dilution hit.


Of course, that price assumes that investors continue to value Star based on its ambitious plans and keep ignoring
the company’s miserable results. Without the speculative hype provided by its long-shot dreams, which alternate
betweenbeating Big Tobacco for massive damage awards and beating Big Pharma for blockbuster miracle cures,
Star would arguably lose all of the appeal that makes it one of the most active (and volatile) small-cap stocks on the
Nasdaq exchange.

JAMN Cools off While Escaping SEC Heat
When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently suspended trading in 17 dubious microcap
companies, the agency spared one notorious player – Jammin Java (OTC: JAMN.OB) – that easily ranks among the
most overhyped penny stocks of the entire year.


Fueled by an aggressive promotional campaign, far more powerful than those lifting the stocks actually included on
the SEC hit list, JAMN exploded from 17 cents to $6.35 a share before losing more than half of its value
afterTheStreetSweeper began raising serious questions about the company. Within days, JAMN quickly shed $250
million worth of its market value, as cold reality sobered up giddy investors previously drunk on overblown hype.


“They may be called ‘penny stocks,’” the SEC observed when announcing its recent crackdown, “but victims of
microcap fraud can suffer devastating losses.”


While the SEC excluded JAMN from its net, focusing on older favorites of penny-stock promoters instead, the
agency cited many concerns that look quite relevant to JAMN itself. Like most of the stocks caught in that SEC halt,
JAMN clearly surged on paid promotions – recording huge gains in both its trading volume and its share price –
since the company’s dismal operational results, including barely $1,000 in annual sales, could hardly inspire even a
meager rally in the shares. Moreover, like the promotions that boosted those other penny stocks, the JAMN
campaign has relied on shadowy figures hiding behind mysterious websites and financed by obscure “third-party”
outfits to set the company’s stock on fire. As covered in more detail below, the JAMN campaign also bears striking
similarities to another aggressivepromotion – touting shares of Big Bear Mining (OTC: BGBR.OB) – that has
already ended horribly for gullible investors.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 208/226


Late Tuesday afternoon, after missing earlier deadlines, Jammin Java (OTC: JAMN.OB) filed a long-awaited annual
report packed with enough eye-opening news to keep investors up all night. That mandatory filing, unaccompanied
with a cheerful press release heralding its arrival, served as a painful wake-up call to shareholders already burned
by a rapid plunge in the company’s stock price.
To be sure, the 10-K offered investors little reason to sing. For starters, the filing reveals, this once-hot “coffee
company” sells no coffee of its own at all. JAMN relies on a supplier based in frigid Canada – far away from the
tropical Jamaican home of its co-founder Rohan Marley – to provide the company with an actual product to sell to its
customers instead.


Back in April of 2010, JAMN inked a “supply and toll agreement” with Canterbury Coffee of British Columbia that
gave it access to some brew. According to that agreement, JAMN relies on Canterbury to fulfill every role – save a
minor one – normally satisfied by a firm that classifies itself as a coffee company. Canterbury purchases the coffee
beans. It roasts them. And it then packages them in bags supplied by JAMN – the company’s only real product – for
sale to the public.


JAMN signed this deal more than a year ago, right before Shane Whittle – a notorious Vancouver stock promoter –
officially resigned as CEO of the company. But the company never mentioned that agreement, seemingly material
enough to warrant at least a quiet 8-K report, in a single regulatory filing until now.

promotedcoffee company, and – for very different reasons – TheStreetSweeper would like investors to do.


Since the beginning of the year, JAMN has miraculously risen from the ashes of the “Grey Market” graveyard to
become one of the liveliest – and richest – stocks in the entire microcap arena. JAMN has seen its stock shoot
straight toward heaven, soaring from 55 cents to peak above $6 a share on massive daily volume, with its market
value nowtopping $355 million despite the company’s limited resources and operating history. (As covered in more
detail below, two of the Internet tout sheets pushing JAMN the hardest effectively vanished -- disabled by their
Internet servers -- on the day the stock’s trading volume exploded past 20 million shares.) 


JAMN stands out for its powerful connections, the first loudly celebrated by the company and the second – involving
anotorious stock promoter – carefully hidden from view.


For starters, as the company well knows, JAMN comes complete with a very seductive story. JAMN counts Rohan
Marley – one of seven children fathered by iconic Jamaican musician Bob Marley – as both current chairman and
original cofounder of the company. Thanks to Marley’s son, JAMN has found itself with an attention-grabbing asset.


Through a private firm known as Marley Coffee LLC, corporate filings show, Rohan Marley has granted JAMN an
“exclusive, transferrable, worldwide license” to use the “Marley Coffee” name to market the expensive coffee it
apparently began selling just a few months ago. JAMN imports its coffee beans from Africa and Central and South
America (rather than Jamaica itself), the company said, and then roasts them right here in North America before
ultimately marketing the finished product – retailing for up to $72 (for a variety pack) before discounts -- with help
from the beloved Marley name.


Since JAMN was still classified as a “shell” corporation when it filed its latest financial statements in December,
reporting no revenue or cash in the bank at all, investors have been bidding up the stock based on mere faith – as
opposed to actual evidence – that the company can drum up huge demand for its high-priced coffee. If
the multiplesassigned to industry powerhouse Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) serve as any guide, investors are
basically treating JAMN like a company that sells almost $150 million worth of coffee a year already and boasts
healthy profit margins (approaching 10%) on those sales to boot.

NOG: Putting a Pretty Face on an Ugly Deal?
Now that Northern Oil and Gas (AMEX: NOG) has finally hired a respected “Big Four” auditor to review its books –
blessed internally by an audit chair who reportedly overlooked Enron’s massive fraud – the company could find itself
with a lot of explaining to do. The possible questions range from obvious ones, like those covering the decline
rates and depletion expenses for NOG’s gushing Bakken wells, to bizarre ones like this: If NOG has accumulated
such a valuable portfolio of acreage out in North Dakota, the most attractive region in the oil-soaked Bakken shale,
then why has the company sold rights to wells on more than 15% of its North Dakota leases to a mysterious
firm established by a young cosmetologist – but officially led by one of its largest original shareholders -- while
booking nominal proceeds, at best, from those potential related-party deals?


NOG has spent years loudly promoting its frenetic acquisitions in the oil-rich Bakken region, pushing its market
capitalization above $2 billion at its peak, but the company has never even mentioned the pile of assets it sold along
the way. All told, state records show, NOG has purchased approximately 400 leases in North Dakota during its
breathless shopping spree. Meanwhile, that database reveals, NOG has sold roughly 80 North Dakota assets –
the vast majority to an obscure firm that’s struck only a handful of deals with other sellers in the state – and, in some
cases, has recorded no apparent proceeds from those transactions at all.


NOG transferred its interest in at least 70 North Dakota oil wells to an outfit known as Ashwood Resources, records
indicate, a firm that operates out of a post office box in the same tiny Minnesota suburb that the company itself calls
home. Notably, records show, Ashwood currently lists Brittany Reger – the wife of NOG Chief Michael Reger – as
the official contact person for the firm.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 209/226


With oil prices on the rise worldwide, and nuclear reactors leaking in Japan, alternative energy stocks continue to
soar, especially in Pennyland. Green may be good, but many of the “green” companies trading in the microcap
arena – particularly highflying Lithium Exploration Group (OTC: LEXG.OB) – could burn investors if they run out of
fuel and crash.
 


They can still be promoted and played, of course, as veterans of the shady penny-stock world well know. And
companies promising to search for lithium, which powers the batteries used in new and increasingly popular electric
cars, rank among the clear favorites in this risky space.


Today, LEXG stands out as the biggest star by far. The company generates no revenue, corporate filings show, and
will likely need years to do so if it manages to survive that long. It had no cash on hand at the end of 2010, either,
and it managed to raise a mere $250,000 through a private placement deal earlier this year. But thanks to a $3.3
millionpublicity campaign – possibly record-breaking in price – LEXG has skyrocketed from 12 cents to almost $4 a
share in barely a month and now boasts a market value that’s approaching $200 million. 


If history serves as any guide, however, LEXG will fail to hold onto even a fraction of those remarkable gains. A year
ago, TheStreetSweeper scrutinized three similar companies in a detailed report entitled “Can the Batteries Last on
Overcharged Lithium Stocks?” That question has long since been answered, alas, with all three stocks sinking from
impressive highs to increasingly miserable lows.

NOG: Lasting Fairy Tale or Looming Horror Story?
* Editor’s Note: The following is the first story in a two-part series on Northern Oil & Gas.


To some, Northern Oil & Gas (AMEX: NOG) looks like a Cinderella stock without the fairy-tale ending.


An obscure microcap company just a few short years ago, NOG has magically transformed itself into one of
the hottest names in the energy sector by capitalizing on easy oil discoveries in the Bakken shale to generate a
huge – if unsustainable – explosion in growth. With its revenues tripling and its profits more than doubling over the
course of the past year, records show, NOG has understandably won over a growing crowd of fans. 


NOG’s highflying stock recently hit a record of almost $34 a share, up 1,500% from its 2009 lows, before
finally giving up some of its breathless gains earlier this month. Even at its current price of $28.25, however, NOG
still boasts a $1.72 billion market value that reminds skeptics of Cinderella on that wondrous night just before
midnight struck.


To be sure, as recent headlines clearly indicate, NOG comes with a powerful bull story. In a nutshell, the bull case –
which magically addresses the key issues raised by company bears in the past – goes something like this. NOG
employs a well-connected CEO who has used his family’s deep roots in Montana and nearby North Dakota to
negotiate valuable leases in the oil-rich Bakken shale. Moreover, NOG has secured that land at cheap prices –
spending a fraction of the amount paid by larger Bakken players – by focusing on small “non-operated” properties
that have yet to be explored. The company has then kept its overhead to a minimum, employing fewer than a
dozen full-time workers, by partnering with established operators that actually drill the wells in exchange for a
majority share of the gains that flow from those projects.


As a result, NOG has managed to minimize risks and maximize returns – without a single report of a dry hole –
while generating massive gains for the company and those who have purchased its popular stock.


NOG has posted an impressive string of record-breaking numbers throughout that breathless rally. This month,
however, NOG quietly disclosed a special “adjustment” that jumped out at skeptics of the company. Specifically,
critics note, NOG recorded a $3.5 million depletion charge – signaling a potentially material slowdown among its
fast-gushing wells – that caused a big spike in its fourth-quarter depletion expense. With Bakken wells notorious for
their rapid depletion rate, critics say, NOG has long faced that inevitable hit.


“Their depletion numbers have appeared low,” says John Hempton, chief investment officer of Bronte Capital
Management in Australia. “I think they will be taking more depletion charges – which may be very large – in the
future … When you’ve extracted the oil, but you haven’t depreciated the land and the wells necessary to obtain it,
that’s basically the end game.”

CCME: Few Signs of Life at 'Healthy' Chinese Firm


* Editor's Note: This story has been republished with permission from The Financial Investigator. To access
the original article, complete with links to back-up documents, click here.
 
In the maze of thronged and narrow streets that makes up Fujian province’s capital city of Fuzhou, a deft driver, if
he’s willing–as all Chinese drivers apparently are–to nearly kill or injure vast numbers of his countrymen can take
you to the foot of Dongjie street. There was little reason to be there save for its having the headquarters of a
company called China MediaExpress Holdings (Nasdaq: CCME), an enterprise that seems to be able to weather
allegations about its business that would have forced the share price collapse of a company five times its size. The
attention of bulls and bears is not misplaced: In a mere four years as a public company, it has apparently come to
dominate the ad placement market for leading multinational consumer products companies on a network of what it
claims is more than 27,000 buses on Chinese airport and intercity routes.
 


Also, and this cannot be understated, hanging out on a sidewalk in Fujian–the sidewalks double as parking spots
when the streets, which appeared to have been designed in the Han Dynasty, fill up–was not a viable option. There
was also the matter of the world-class headache the Financial Investigator was developing from Fuzhou’s diabolical
smell, an epic conflation of poor sewage treatment, air pollution and the smell of cabbage that made getting the hell
off Dongjie street a matter of vital importance.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 210/226


The Financial Investigator and his traveling companion for the trip, an American investor with extensive experience
in China, decided to head upstairs despite our interview with the CFO having been cancelled at the last minute (with
no explanation given.) We thought a quick tour of the offices and meeting a few other executives might open our
eyes to a few things.


It did.


Though the language barrier was a little steep with the young receptionist–when we asked for writing paper, she
provided Kleenex–we were in short order shown to their conference room and told to wait. It did not escape notice
that pride of place in the conference room belonged to a framed certificate of participation from the Fall 2010
Rodman & Renshaw conference, the World Cup for reverse merger companies and the pumpers and touts who
peddle them.


Eventually chief operating officer James Yu came down and after spending 30 minutes trying to understand who we
were, concluded that giving us a tour wouldn’t hurt. Soon enough, his colleague, Vinne Ye–the chairman’s assistant–
came out and took us around.


It was most eye-opening.

IBIO: Time for a Painful Shot of Reality


For investors betting on iBio (AMEX: IBIO), a bleeding vaccine developer formerly owned by a penny-stock
company with a history of self-dealing, the future could soon deliver a powerful dose of pain.


Originally spawned by Integrated Biopharma (OTC: INBP.OB), an obscure vitamin seller that currently trades for less
than 20 cents a share, IBIO has seen its own stock rocket from 55 cents to a high of $6 during its past 12 months as
a stand-alone company. To critics who have followed both companies for years, however, IBIO looks a lot less
healthy than its current share price.


First and perhaps foremost, they say, IBIO faces a looming secondary offering that will allow holders of low-priced
stock – including a tainted brokerage house with a buy rating on the name – to cash in huge gains on millions of
cheap shares. By increasing IBIO’s share count by 45%, they note, that offering alone could slash the company’s
stock price by almost half. But even without the threat of massive dilution, they say, IBIO looks like a grossly
overvalued company that resembles its former parent far more than it does a promising biotech play.


To be sure, corporate filings show, IBIO and INBP share plenty of common traits. For starters, both companies
employ CEOs from the same family. Robert B. Kay runs IBIO, while his brother E. Gerald Kay runs INBP and
founded the original corporation (Chem International) that launched those intertwined firms. IBIO also counts Gerald
Kay and his two daughters, INBP Executive Vice Presidents Christina Kay and Riva Sheppard, among the
company’s largest shareholders. In fact, regulatory filings show, those INBP insiders boast larger stakes in IBIO than
the company’s own CEO does. 


All told, IBIO’s latest proxy statement shows, INBP insiders presently control more than half of IBIO’s outstanding
shares.

Cougar Oil & Gas: Ready for a Bloodbath?
Despite the bullish claims -- and the wild price targets – showcased in paid promotions for Cougar Oil & Gas
Canada (OTC: COUGF.OB), the company cannot overcome the powerful forces of reality. In short, the hype looks a
whole lot prettier than the following ugly facts.


COUGF has recorded no significant changes in its oil production over the course of the past year, while the
company’s stock has inexplicably tripled in price during that same period. Nevertheless, COUGF promoters – hired
as part of a massive six-figure publicity campaign -- have issued price targets that call for the stock to rocket even
higher, soaring as much as 1,000% or more, despite the speculative gains it has already enjoyed. 


Without those promotions, COUGF looks like an odd candidate for such a breathless rally. For starters, COUGF is
actually owned by another company that has been operating at a deficit for years and needs emergency financing in
order to survive. Moreover, COUGF itself is a cash-starved company that plans to use dilutive equity-based
financing to cover its own business expenses going forward.


Given that troubling set of facts, TheStreetSweeper offers these words of caution: If you have purchased COUGF
shares (or considered doing so), you should first determine just how much that investment is really worth. It just may
be a little less than the $7.25 -- or the even higher $62 -- price target you saw on the promotional tout sheet that
landed in your mailbox.

L&L Energy: Could This Hot Stock Go up in Smoke?
L&L Energy (Nasdaq: LLEN), a relatively new Chinese coal miner accused of misleading investors in the past, has
managed to become a stock-market winner by posting some of the most incredible numbers recorded in the entire
industry.


Just a few years after reinventing itself as a Chinese coal-mining company, L&L currently boasts higher
margins than virtually any player – including Chinese giant Yanzhou Coal Mining (NYSE: YZC) and U.S.
veteran Peabody Energy(NYSE: BTU) – in the red-hot sector. L&L also touts a remarkable growth rate, filings show,

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 211/226


with revenue soaring from $23.4 million to $109 million -- and profits skyrocketing from less than $1 million to $32.9
million -- over the course of two short years.


In other words, those numbers suggest, L&L has managed to pull off an outright miracle. 


Under the leadership of founder and current CEO Dickson Lee, an accountant and tainted ex-broker with no obvious
coal-mining experience, L&L has spent the past few years buying cheap Chinese coal mines and then somehow
transforming them into lucrative money-making machines. L&L paid just $4 million last year for the newest of its
three coal mines, for example, and then released pro forma numbers suggesting that the mine – which posted a
meager $362,545 profit the year before its sale – would have delivered more than $8 million in 2010 profits if the
company had overseen its operations for all (rather than just half) of that fiscal year. If so, L&L struck quite a bargain
by paying less than 0.5 times future earnings – in a sizzling industry with generous price-to-earnings ratios – for that
valuable coal mine.


The company, based in Seattle despite its Chinese focus, worked similar wonders with its first two coal mines as
well. In public statements, however, the company has offered a rather simple – and incredibly vague -- reason for
that success.

HHWW: Another Hyped-Up Stock That's Dressed to Kill?
The corporate headquarters for Horiyoshi Worldwide (OTC: HHWW.OB), located within blocks of several Los
Angeles homeless shelters servicing Skid Row, looks rather modest for a high-end fashion company that recently
sported a market value approaching $200 million.


Earlier this month, TheStreetSweeper sent some locals to HHWW’s home office after watching the company’s stock
rocket from $1 to $3 a share on a blizzard of paid promotions. They found a tiny operation, manned by a single
staffer (focused on investor relations), that housed little more than two clothing racks containing about 20 T-shirts
apiece.


Based on prices supplied in HHWW’s regulatory filings, those T-shirts represent an estimated $6,000 worth of
inventory for the company. While meager, that figure nevertheless eclipses the $912 in total sales reported by
HHWWfor the second quarter of this year.


To be fair, HHWW has yet to release third-quarter results that might reflect an uptick in sales following the
company’s adoption of an aggressive growth strategy. Still, corporate filings show, HHWW actually saw its quarterly
revenue plummet – sinking from $152,175 to less than $1,000 – in the months leading up to that grand plan. 


Even so, stock promoters – paid huge sums to tout HHWW – have painted an incredibly rosy picture of the
company. Last month, for example, Eric Dickson of Breakaway Stocks predicted that HHWW could soar more than
4,500% by the end of this year. The stock, currently trading at $1.63, must somehow find a way to reach $45.38 a
share over the next few days for that wild forecast to come true.

Regulators Turn up the Heat on Alternate Energy
Two months after TheStreetSweeper began sounding alarms about Alternate Energy (OTC: AEHI.PK), federal
regulators have officially filed charges against the company and two of its officers for allegedly fleecing investors
through a long-running pump-and-dump scheme.


In a formal complaint this week, issued just days after halting AEHI’s stock, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission flatly accused the company and two senior executives – CEO Donald Gillispie and his girlfriend Vice
President Jennifer Ransom – of scamming investors while secretly enriching themselves. Since it went public four
years ago, the SEC says, AEHI has raised millions of dollars by promising to build a nuclear power plant even
though the company has “no realistic possibility” of ever achieving that goal. Meanwhile, the SEC says, AEHI
insiders have quietly dumped big chunks of stock while publicly expressing strong confidence in the company.


“The company has made multiple misrepresentations, including claims that its executives had such confidence in
AEHI that they had not sold a single share of company stock,” the SEC stated on Thursday. However, “records
obtained by the SEC show that Gillispie and Ransom have instead secretly unloaded extensive stock holdings and
funneled the money back to Gillispie.”


According to the SEC, both Gillispie and Ransom have sold at least 1 million shares of AEHI stock through secret
accounts and then used the money for “lavish personal expenses.” With Gillispie paying stock promoters to
manipulate AEHI, the SEC claims, the defendants managed to cash in their shares at artificially high prices.

Regulators Pull the Plug on Alternate Energy
Four years after Alternate Energy (OTC: AEHI.PK) went public, courting investors with grand plans to build a
multibillion-dollar nuclear power plant, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has finally suspended
trading in the controversial penny stock.


This week, the SEC halted AEHI due to questions about “the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated
information” about the company. When cracking down on AEHI, the SEC cited concerns about several issues –
including company finances, executive compensation and insider sales – examined by TheStreetSweeper in its
recent coverage of the company. (Click on these three links to access those stories and the backup documents used

http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 212/226


AEHI critics, who have been sounding alarms about the company for years, expressed clear relief at the long-
awaited news.


“It was a scam from the beginning,” declared Joe Weatherby, a former planning and zoning commissioner in AEHI’s
home base of Idaho. “This has been a long time in coming.


“I didn’t think it was ever going to happen,” he added. “So it was a great Christmas present.”

Can CyberDefender Protect Itself from a Crash?
CyberDefender (Nasdaq: CYDE), the company behind such controversial computer-security programs
as DoubleMySpeed.com and MyCleanPC.com, has created quite a mess.


Last month, CyberDefender disclosed plans to reverse a suspect accounting practice that – for a brief, but crucial,
period – allowed the company to look like a profitable operation. Thanks to that accounting change, which
improperly slashed CyberDefender’s advertising expenses, the company managed to report its first-ever pretax
profit just months before securing a coveted listing on the Nasdaq exchange.


The stock remained strong, always commanding at least the $4 minimum bid required by Nasdaq, ahead of its mid-
2010 move from the OTC Bulletin Board to the larger exchange. It fell below that $4 threshold less than three weeks
later, however, and has largely traded below that price ever since. Down 2 cents on Wednesday, following a delisting
threat from Nasdaq, the thinly traded stock currently fetches $3.29 a share. 


The only analyst who covers CyberDefender, James Ragan of Crowell Weedon, still has a buy rating and an $8
price target on the company’s stock. His forecasts have so far proven wildly optimistic, however, and continue to
bank on future profits – subject to massive dilution and dependant upon drastic improvements in the
company’s shrinking margins and dismal renewal rates – that now seem hopelessly elusive to some. Far from
objective, he also stands to benefit from his bullish call since he owns stock in the company himself.


In contrast, skeptics view CyberDefender as a dubious company that should have never escaped from the penny-
stock arena at all. They portray CyberDefender’s computer-protection service as an outright scam, unable to
compete with popular software sold by giant rivals McAfee (NYSE: MFE) and Symantec (Nasdaq: SYMC), and
attribute the company’s eye-popping growth to sensational advertising – costing more than the revenue that it
ultimately generates – rather than legitimate demand for its products.

Suntech Power Burns Investors Once Again
Last week, Suntech Power (NYSE: STP) burned investors with disappointing quarterly results that – while bad
enough – look even worse under the glare of a powerful spotlight.


The giant solar company needed major help from a notorious related-party deal, first scrutinized in
detail byTheStreetSweeper six months ago, just to post third-quarter profits that even approached Wall Street
expectations. Technically, the company reported a profit of 18 cents a share that fell a full nickel short of the
consensus estimate. However, critics note, without the generous new value assigned to solar projects recently
completed by the Global Solar Fund (GSR) – a firm 97% owned by Suntech and its CEO – the company would have
generated a much tinier profit of just 6 cents a share instead.


Axiom Capital analyst Gordon Johnson, a longtime Suntech bear, refused to include that handy benefit in the
company’s results when reiterating his latest call for investors to sell the volatile stock. Johnson presented a
compelling argument, as summarized below, while stating his case against the company.

Alternate Energy: Another Radioactive Stock Pick?
Alternate Energy (OTC: AEHI.PK) investors might want to take a closer look at some of the outfits that have
embraced the company’s stock.


Just last month, two different firms – both known for risky microcap picks -- rushed to defend AEHI
with bullish recommendations after TheStreetSweeper raised legitimate concerns about the company. The first
one, Pinnacle Digest, owns AEHI’s stock and admitted in a disclaimer that it plans to “sell every share” for its own
profit without advance notice to its followers. The second one, WallStreetCorner.com, regularly collects cash and/or
stock from the companies it endorses and has directed investors into some notorious losers along the way.


Years ago, for example, WallStreetCorner’s Larry Oakley touted a company known as Accident Prevention Plus that
served as the vehicle for an illegal pump-and-dump scheme. The so-called “mastermind” behind that scam wound
up sentenced to 10 years in prison last month – just three days before Oakley issued his ringing endorsement of
AEHI – as punishment for his crimes.


Oakley has embraced other ill-fated stocks, such as eMax Holdings (OTC: EMXC.PK) and Hathaway Corporation,
as well. In certain ways, AEHI now resembles both of those doomed companies.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 213/226


Alternate Energy (OTC: AEHI.PK) has spent the past four years selling investors an incredible – if incomplete –
story.


The basic plotline goes something like this: AEHI will somehow secure the funding and approval necessary to build
a multibillion-dollar nuclear power plant in Idaho that’s virtually guaranteed to deliver eye-popping profits for
investors. That version of the story contains some gaping holes, however, filled with pesky secrets that threaten to
ruin this fairy-tale ending.


Take the first chapter in this ongoing saga, just for starters. Initially, AEHI CEO Donald Gillispie said the company
would build its nuclear power plant in Owyhee County – touting a deal inked with “prominent Idaho landowner and
businessman” James Hilliard -- and spent the next year portraying that site as a suitable location for such a project.
In the spring of 2008, however, AEHI suddenly announced that it had abandoned that site due to troubling fault lines
and shifted the project to nearby Elmore County instead.


In a sworn deposition that surfaced last month, however, Gillispie offered far different reasons for that abrupt change
of plans.


“There were two things going on,” he states in that document. “First of all, we had not received funding because we
lost our silent partner there … The other thing going on was that Hilliard would not – he had been extending the
contract whenever it came up, like a six-month contract – and in early ’08, he didn’t extend it.”

Local.com CFO Pulls a Vanishing Act
Last week, Local.com (Nasdaq: LOCM) CFO Brenda Agius suddenly vacated her post just after the company pre-
announced another blockbuster quarter that would soon require her to certify the accuracy of those financial results.


The news came as a surprise to many, since Local seemed to magically flourish with Agius in charge of its numbers.
The company reported a string of record quarters, pushing its stock from $1.60 to almost $9 a share, during her first
14 months on the job. The stock began to lose steam after that time, however, and ultimately suffered a massive
hit whenTheStreetSweeper raised questions about Local in general – and Agius in particular – a couple of months
ago.


For its part, Local has chosen to downplay the abrupt departure of its top finance executive. In a press
release issued after the market closed last Tuesday, the California-based Internet company stated that Agius had
left for “personal reasons” so that she could be near her new husband on the East Coast. Moreover, Local stated in
its official corporate filings that her “separation from the company is not as a result of any disagreement with the
company, its management or its auditors.”


But Local actually terminated Agius – while at least suggesting that she left willingly – just six months after renewing
her annual contract, those records show, and promised her a generous severance package if she signed a
confidentiality agreement that would prevent her from sharing information about the company.

Rare Element Resources: Formula for Disaster?


* Editor's Note: This column has been republished with permission from the "Shareholder Watchdog." To
access the original article, complete with graphics and links to backup documents, click here.
 
We have witnessed a fair share of bubbles over the past 15 years: Internet stocks, housing, crude oil, and Chinese
stocks. We have had some success in identifying "bubbles" in individual stocks and warning the investment
community about specific issues (including HUSA at $20.35 and PCBC at $5.11). Possibly the most voracious
bubble in recent memory is occurring with Rare Earth element ("RE" or "RE element") stocks. We have done some
work framing the opportunities and risks within the RE element space. After sifting through the hype, we believe
there is tremendous risk in RE stocks and highlight Rare Element Resources (AMEX: REE) as a potential short
opportunity, or at least as a stock investors should avoid.
 


Rare Element is a Canada-based company that owns the Bear Lodge mine located in the northeastern corner of
Wyoming. The stock price is up more than 500% since early July and more than 65% in the past three days. With
the euphoria of the strong move in RE element stocks, speculators have bought first and asked questions later. We
believe Rare Element investors will wish they had conducted more diligence before piling into a company with a
potentially worthless plot of land. We believe Rare Element is a heavily promoted stock with questionable
management and massive risks to a business plan that, under the rosiest scenario, will not be at full production until
2015 or 2016. By that time, we expect the world could suffer from a glut of RE supplies. As a result, we believe
current investors face at least 70% downside from current levels.

SMED: The Band-Aid That Looked Like a Miracle Cure
Sharps Compliance (Nasdaq: SMED) investors have paid a high price for the stock they purchased from company
insiders – who scored millions from their well-timed transactions – less than a year ago.


Until early 2009, when the company secured an incredibly generous contract from the federal government, Sharps
toiled in relative obscurity as a tiny outfit specializing in the disposal of used syringes and other medical waste. The
company, long overshadowed by much larger players such as Waste Management (NYSE: WM) and Stericycle
(Nasdaq: SRCL), was reporting meager profits – after years of posting steady losses – and trading on the lowly OTC
Bulletin Board before scoring its lucrative government deal. Once it landed that $40 million contract, however,
Sharps soon became ahighly profitable company with massive operating margins that dwarfed those generated by
its giant rivals in the fiercely competitive industry.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 214/226


Sharps inked that mysterious deal, awarded outside the traditional competitive bidding process, with apparent help
from some well-placed government veterans. Steven Bice spent years as a high-ranking official at the Centers for
Disease Control, the source of that high-margin contract, before joining Sharps (where another powerful CDC alum
already served as a consultant) as the company’s vice president of government relations.


“We were working on that contract for a long time,” Sharps spokesperson Deborah Pawlowski
told TheStreetSweeperthis week. But “we didn’t have it signed when (Bice) started with us … He was with us a year
or so before that.”


Sharps never revealed that Bice had joined its executive team, even though he boasts the sort of impressive
credentials – including a national Homeland Security Award – that most small companies love to tout. Bice carries a
permanent stain on his record, however, due to a felony conviction that resulted from his involvement in a high-
profile government corruption case almost two decades ago.

Alternate Energy: Power Stock or Toxic Waste?
Four years ago, Alternate Energy (OTC: AEHI.PK) CEO Donald Gillispie arrived in one of the poorest counties in
Idaho and began selling company stock to local investors impressed by his grand plans.


Although AEHI had spent just $1,000 on research and development during the previous two years, regulatory filings
show, the company boasted all sorts of remarkable inventions. AEHI claimed that it had developed a breakthrough
fuel additive that could slash the costs of natural gas-powered electricity, for example, and that it was also creating
mini reactors that would “revolutionize nuclear power in an urban setting.” Even better, the company said that it was
poised to become “the first company to harness the natural energy delivered in a bolt of lightning” – a goal
later portrayed as “hopeless” by a national lightning expert interviewed by The New York Times.


While ambitious, however, those projects ranked as mere side shows for the young public company. If possible,
AEHI had even bigger plans. Despite its minimal resources, skeptics say, AEHI promised to build a multibillion-dollar
nuclear power plant – the first project of its kind for decades -- in a rural Idaho desert that lacked the vast water
supply and available transmission lines normally required to make such projects work.


“They have no money; they have no plans,” a county commissioner told the local Owyhee Avalanche newspaper at
the time. “Most (locals) think that it’s … a daydream or a fairy tale.” 


Since then, records show, AEHI has announced funding deals with at least three obscure financial firms – including
one whose leader would later be charged with alleged securities fraud – but still lacks the money required for even
the equivalent of a down payment on a nuclear power plant. AEHI also keeps changing the planned location for its
proposed plant, local news coverage reveals, currently settling on an Idaho county already ruled out by Warren
Buffett’s MidAmerican Nuclear Energy because it made no economic sense.

RMCP: The Tiny Syringe Maker Stings Investors Again
* Editor’s Note: TheStreetSweeper first began uncovering risks at RMCP when the stock hit its peak last
week. Because RMCP crashed before TheStreetSweeper could write and fact-check this investigative report
– with the stock plunging another 25% after the company was emailed questions for this story –
TheStreetSweeper will begin sending out early alerts about risky penny stocks that it plans to cover in the
future. 


Less than four years after changing its name in an effort to put its checkered past behind it, Revolutions Medical
(OTC:RMCP.OB) is suspected of engaging in the same sort of stock-boosting activities that led regulators to crack
down on the company in the first place.


Ever since RMCP filed the paperwork last month to clear the way for massive sales of its stock, the company has
been issuing a flurry of press releases containing increasingly upbeat news. RMCP kicked things off with a couple of
announcements about its MRI technology in mid-August, which proved effective enough to push the company’s
stockfrom 28 cents to 40 cents a share. When RMCP shifted its attention to the company’s new “safety syringes,”
however, the stock really started to fly. By Sept. 13 – less than a month after RMCP began churning out its steady
stream of good news – the briskly trading stock had soared to an all-time high of $1.74 a share.


Three announcements, issued over a one-week span this month, fueled most of that surge.


The first two celebrated a manufacturing deal, calling for the production of 5 million safety syringes, inked with an
obscure firm led by an apparent insider of the company itself. (As noted in more detail below, that firm does not
seem to exist.) The third, even more powerful, announcement hinted at a looming syringe order from none other
than the federal government.


With RMCP plummeting back below $1 last week, however, some investors clearly wonder – perhaps with good
reason -- if those deals will turn out to be real. After all, Internet records show, RMCP announced a similar
manufacturing deal for its syringes years ago but has never generated 1 cent of revenue since that time. Moreover,
despite its recent announcement, RMCP has apparently yet to land a formal order from the federal government.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 215/226


In the world of finance theory, a company’s credible suggestion that it is being forced to raise cash at exorbitant
rates – or that it is valuing its assets sharply below where the market has valued them – traditionally means a death
sentence for the company’s stock price. The reasons for this are straightforward enough: Investors hate
desperation, but not as much as they hate making an asset play and being wrong on the value of the assets.


Then there is InterOil (NYSE: IOC).


An international oil and gas producer that has been touting a potentially epic find in the wilds of Papua New Guinea
for more than a decade, InterOil recently raised cash at exorbitant rates and appears to be internally valuing its
assets well below what the market appears to think they are worth. Yet all is well in the share-price department.

Internet Brands: Deal-Maker or Deal-Breaker?
These days, Internet Brands (Nasdaq: INET) may have reason to worry about its own brand name.


In recent years, company filings show, INET has spent huge sums of money acquiring websites in an effort to
bolster its growth. But the former owners of two of those websites – including one that accounts for a major chunk of
INET’s traffic – have accused the company of refusing to fully pay off those strategic deals. Meanwhile, longtime
fans of other INET-purchased websites have threatened to leave over rate hikes and reported failures in customer
service.


With INET under fire from both its past acquisition targets and its inherited customers, the company could face
challenges pursuing its ambitious growth strategy going forward. Moreover, regulatory filings indicate, INET has so
far failed to capitalize on the websites it has already bought.

China Sky One Medical Caught in the Eye of a Storm
Hurt by mounting government scrutiny, China Sky One Medical (Nasdaq: CSKI) – once a Wall Street darling – has
found itself in a world of incredible pain.


In a press release issued late Friday, when many investors had already left work for the long holiday weekend, CSKI
dropped a devastating bombshell. The Chinese pharmaceutical supplier, already a prime target of bears suspicious
of its regulatory filings, suddenly slashed its full-year guidance as its own distributors attempt to distance themselves
from the controversial company. Specifically, CSKI revealed that it will fall well short of revenue and profit targets for
2010 because “several major distributors” had severed ties with the company – the subject of a formal
investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – due to unwanted government scrutiny of their own
business practices.

Clicker 'Body-Slammed' after Tout by Pro Wrestler
Shawn Ambrosino may have retired from professional wrestling, but as a penny stock promoter – touting the likes of
Clicker (OTC: CLKZ.OB), Clenergen (OTC: CRGE.OB) and Enhance Skin Products (OTC: EHSK.OB) – he can still
inflict an awful lot of pain.


This month, Ambrosino delivered his latest knockout blow with a powerful recommendation of CLKZ that has since
left investors reeling. With CLKZ sitting at $1 a share, Ambrosino urged investors to buy the stock before it surged
past $20 as the company – a cash-poor outfit with just a handful of employees – conquered Craigslist to become the
new heavyweight leader of the online classified advertising world. CLKZ did march higher on that paid tout,
ultimately reaching $1.37 a share on Wednesday, but never approached even Ambrosino’s $5 short-term target
before staging a remarkable collapse.


The stock, hammered by a sudden selling spree that began the same day it peaked, now fetches just 53 cents a
share. Even at that lower price, however, CLKZ still boasts a market value of $31.2 million that looks rather lofty for
a company that – just six weeks ago – cautioned that it lacked the funds necessary to finance its operations for
more than 30 days.

Tradeshow, Skymark Kicked off the Stage
Canadian regulators aren’t buying the story that Tradeshow Marketing (OTC: TSHO.PK) and Skymark Research – a
paid promoter led by the son of TSHO’s founder – tried so hard to sell.


The Alberta Securities Commission has issued a cease-trading order for TSHO’s stock, while banning Skymark from
trading or recommending any securities, after uncovering tell-tale signs of a classic pump-and-dump scheme.
When explaining its move on Monday, the ASC cited concerns originally raised by TheStreetSweeper in a detailed
investigative report almost six months ago. (Click here for the original story, complete with links to backup
documents.)


Specifically, the ASC claimed that TSHO had soared on bullish Skymark forecasts secretly generated by relatives
connected to the company. The ASC also noted that John Kirk, the sole director of Skymark and the son of TSHO’s
founder, “held a significant number of shares” in the company – as did TSHO founder Bruce Kirk himself – at the
time of the stock-boosting promotions. It pointed out that Ben Kirk, another son of the founder, worked for Skymark
during the publicity campaign as well.

Liqiudmetal: Keeping Mum about Apple and Far More
This year, Liquidmetal Technologies (OTC: LQMT.PK) has kept some telling – and arguably material – secrets from
its investors.


Take LQMT’s recent deal with Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) as an obvious example. In a cryptic 8-K filing on Aug. 9, LQMT
suddenly announced a contract with Apple that – on the surface – seemed to warrant a full-blown press release.
Specifically, LQMT revealed that it had signed a “master transaction agreement” that would allow Apple to
commercialize its technology for future use in its consumer electronics products.


LQMT never disclosed the terms of that licensing contract, however, allowing hopeful speculation to fuel the
company’s shares instead. LQMT’s stock, which fetched just 13 cents a share a month ago, rocketed to a multiyear
highof $1.76 last week before swiftly crashing on the lack of details associated with that high-profile deal. The stock,
down another 10.6% on Wednesday, has now lost most of its Apple-related gains and currently trades for just 76
cents a share.


This spring, in the months leading up to that dramatic deal, LQMT kept quiet about another important development
as well. In an even shorter 8-K filing on March 8, LQMT quietly disclosed that longtime Chairman John Kang had left
the company without giving any reason for his departure. One week earlier, Kang was convicted at trial on fraud
charges – carrying a potential five-year prison sentence – for inflating the financial results of another company he
had previously led.

Local.com Rolls the Dice on Another Troubling Deal
Local.com (Nasdaq: LOCM) better hope that investors don’t start using Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), its far more
powerful rival, to search for information about the last company it acquired.


Last month, Local agreed to pay $5 million -- plus another $5.9 million in potential earn-out bonuses -- for a startup
technology company that provides “domain-based local advertising solutions” to small business customers.
When announcing that transaction, which looks rather extravagant for a company that’s recorded net losses for the
past five years, Local identified its buyout target as Octane360 and the firm’s leader as Adam Rioux. Local only later
revealed in an official 8-K filing that it had actually purchased Simply Static, doing business as Octane360, a
company co-founded by Rioux and a second man by the name of Mark Roah.


Local may have buried this information for a reason. In 2003, Roah agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges for
artificially inflating the revenue at L90 – an Internet firm where he served as senior vice president of business
development – and another web-based company called Homestore.com. According to Internet records, Roah
received a one-year prison sentence, followed by three years of supervised release, as punishment for those
crimes. A man with the same name and age as Roah served time in federal prison, an official database shows,
regaining his freedom less than three years ago.

Has Local.com Moved into a Bad Neighborhood?
Local.com. (Nasdaq: LOCM) investors might want to take a closer look at corporate insiders and the recent deals
they’ve inked in order to boost the company’s growth.


CEO Heath Clarke has issued bullish projections, lifted by aggressive acquisitions of website customers, and
thendumped almost half of his stock in the company. CFO Brenda Agius has been placed in charge of finances even
though her past experience at that post, racked up at former Internet highflier FindWhat.com, ended in disaster for
investors. Moreover, one of the company’s directors has worked as an investment banker at several firms –
 including two with connections to a shady penny-stock outfit known as SpongeTech (SPNG.PK) – that have left
stains on his record as well.


Meanwhile, in an effort to expand beyond its core Internet search-engine business, Local has been acquiring
customers from companies with some black marks of their own. Local purchased most of those subscribers from
LaRoss Partners, a firm that appears to be led by a past target of securities regulators with links to two Internet
businesses accused of billing customers for website hosting services they never ordered. It has acquired the rest of
its subscribers from LiveDeal (Nasdaq: LIVE), a company with an “F” rating by the Better Business Bureau due to
massive customer complaints.

TheStreetSweeper Helps Investors Escape Massive Losses


As a former investigative reporter for TheStreet.com, a popular financial news site founded by Jim Cramer of “Mad
Money” fame, I am keenly aware of the risks involved with keeping score when it comes to stock-related calls.
Cramer raked in millions during his past life as a hedge fund manager, but he has still made mistakes – and suffered
withering criticism – as a celebrity stock picker willing to make his calls in public. He cannot avoid offering at least
some bad tips, given the unpredictable nature of the stock market, and he cannot avoid taking some real heat when
that inevitably happens.


With this in mind, I was initially hesitant to track the performance of stocks we cover here at TheStreetSweeper. We
focus on exposing risky stocks that look poised for massive losses, after all, in a broader market that typically
delivers consistent gains instead. To me, it seemed, we would be working without gravity – or even luck – on our
side.

AIG and Goldman Sachs: The Deceptive Blame Game


* Editor's Note: This story has been republished with permission from TheFinancialInvestigator.com. To
access the original article, complete with links to backup documents, click here. 
 
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission’s document release last week offered no answer to a question that has
received little play since AIG’s (NYSE: AIG) collapse almost two years ago. 
The question is this: “How did AIG really collapse?” It is not: “How did the company get in trouble?” Nor is it this:
“Who is to blame?”


Rather, the curious still want to know: What led a firm with a AA rating, around $160 billion in market value and $14
billion in profits – with real cash-generation capacity to boot – in fiscal 2006 to effectively go out of business two
years later? The answer is not Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS).

Ecosphere: A Clean Energy Company with a Dirty CEO?
Either Ecosphere Technology (OTC: ESPH.OB) CEO Dennis E. McGuire simply shares a lot in common with
a twice-convicted drug felon – a coincidence of remarkable proportions – or he is the former jailbird himself.


Based on public records and news stories gathered by TheStreetSweeper, supplemented with a 63-page personal
background report, the CEO and the ex-con look very much the same.  The names and birth dates match. The
names of multiple relatives come up as matches, too. Other key identifying traits – including addresses, business
ties and even partial social security numbers – correspond as well.


McGuire’s original corporate bio, published in regulatory filings, hints at further parallels. That bio begins when
McGuire graduated from community college in 1974 and, following a long and unexplained hole, picks up in detail
when he invented his first cleaning technology (armed with a mere associate’s degree) more than 15 years later.
The mysterious gap in between corresponds with the very period when the convicted McGuire operated a drug
business, news reports show, and twice served time in jail.

DLR: Reading between the Lines for Signs of Risk


* Editor's Note: This article has been republished with permission from thefinancialinvestigator.com. To
access the original story, complete with links to numerous backup documents, click here.
 
After the high tides of the dot-com era receded, revealing that many companies – from a corporate governance
standpoint – had been “swimming naked,” the mantra among corporate general counsels has been “full disclosure.” 
As corporate bromides go, this is a palatable one. Among other things, it provides that investors be given all
available information on the relationships between a corporation’s officers and directors and the companies they do
business with. But that is not to say it’s perfect.


For example, an investor reading Fannie Mae’s 2003 proxy statement would, around page 30, discover this: Ken
Duberstein, a board member and Republican political arm twister, had spent the previous 11 years providing
“consulting services” to the company, with his most recent fees totaling $375,000. Yet, when the deluge came in
2004, investors seemed totally caught off guard.


This brings to mind Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR), a San Francisco company that has been a darling of Wall
Street for some time now.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on PennyStockChaser this week, filing
charges against the website, its two owners – Carol McKeown and Dan Ryan – and two investment firms under their
control. In its formal complaint, the SEC accused the defendants of “clandestinely selling millions of shares” in the
same stocks that it was urging investors to buy. All told, the SEC estimates, the defendants pocketed at least $2.4
million from their so-called stock-scalping scheme.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story

Both of the oil companies that John F. Terwilliger ran before he became founder, chairman and chief executive of
Houston American Energy Corp. (Nasdaq: HUSA) wound up in bankruptcy.
An oilfield services company headed by one of Houston American's directors, John P. Boylan, also went under, in
part because he took hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans from the business without the knowledge or consent
of his partners.


A third member of Houston American's five-person board, Edwin C. Broun III, was described in court documents last
year as suffering from alcohol-related brain damage that could affect his ability to "process information and make
sound decisions." The filing, submitted in his defense, characterized him as a recluse who slept all day, drank all
night and hadn't opened his mail in two years.

Why Can't Ecosphere Score a Deal with BP?
Maybe Ecosphere Technologies (OTC: ESPH.OB) should have added Kevin Costner, the celebrity backer of a
competing water-treatment device, to its star-studded team.


Despite ringing endorsements from its own superstars – including a big-name environmentalist and two retired
professional athletes – ESPH has so far failed to secure an order from BP (NYSE: BP) for machines that, it says,
can effectively address the company’s massive oil spill. Costner’s company, Ocean Therapy Solutions, fielded an
order from BP for 32 of its machines almost two full weeks ago. ESPH is still waiting on an order, however, even
though the company claims that it offers a superior device.

In ancient tales, a royal court’s scientific elite could conjure “The Elixir of Life,” a potion made from white gold, a few
drops of which could restore youth eternally. You could be forgiven for thinking that society’s command of inorganic
chemistry has progressed somewhat, consigning such stories to the dusty realms of explanatory myth.
 
Not so fast.
 
The continued prominence of a pair of Chinese reverse-merger companies, China Green Agriculture (NYSE: CGA)
and China Sky One Medical (Nasdaq: CSKI), is evidence that investment returns can be had from thin air.

When he was CEO of Lehman Brothers, Dick Fuld oversaw a host of capital markets staff that underwrote stock and
bond sales for the likes of Wal-Mart and General Electric. Bankers advised municipalities on interest-rate exposure,
corporations on mergers and foreign governments on divestment. Entire divisions serviced the business and capital-
raising needs of hedge-fund and private-equity clients. Legions of sales and trading staff talked hourly to every
major investor in the world from the firm’s cavernous trading floors at 745 Seventh Ave.
There were benefits to this beyond the likely $500 million in compensation Fuld booked between 2000-2007
(although that did help in acquiring some trophies). All agree that he wore his reputation like a glove.

Suntech Power Still Seeking Shelter from the Storm
Last week, Suntech Power (NYSE: STP) tried – but failed – to please the market by presenting its latest results in
the best possible light.


Yes, Suntech beat revenue expectations for the first quarter and even raised its production outlook for the rest of the
year. But the company also encountered multiple headwinds that left investors in a rather dark mood.


As expected, Suntech suffered a big hit from the falling Euro that triggered a rare earnings miss. Even worse, the
company reported glitches with the breakthrough technology that’s supposed to fuel its future sales. Meanwhile, the
company still hasn’t collected the cash for deals inked by the Global Solar Fund (GSF) – a mysterious firm that it
largely controls – more than a year ago.

5/22/2018 The Street Sweeper - NOG: The Dirt-Filled Cracks in the Rags-to-Riches Story


http://www.thestreetsweeper.org/article.html?c=3&i=1671 219/226


As a reporter who investigated the archipelago of lies, deceptions and frauds that was the world of a preposterous
little venture called SpongeTech Delivery Systems, I felt it reasonable to conclude that after May 5, when the
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed criminal and civil charges against the
company’s management, there wouldn’t be much more to report on what was by all lights a classic penny-stock
fraud.
That conclusion really needs to be revisited.


SpongeTech was no ordinary pump-and-dump penny-stock scheme; it was, to play off Churchill’s famous definition
of Russia, a fraud wrapped in a stock-market rig inside a money-laundering conspiracy.

Junior Mining Companies and the 'Temple of Doom'
Ever since AmeriLithium (OTC: AMEL.OB) purchased some mining assets from GeoXplor -- a Vancouver outfit led
by the so-called “Indiana Jones” of the lithium trade -- the company has taken investors on a wild and, at times,
thrilling ride. If history repeats itself, however, AMEL investors better not count on a happy ending to their journey.


After all, GeoXplor has sold mineral claims to several other microcap companies that met with rather ugly fates.
Even worse, government records show, GeoXplor founder Clive Ashworth has been previously banned from the
securities industry for an alleged scam – which resulted in criminal convictions for two stock promoters – involving
yet another resource company.


Nevertheless, Ashworth continues to win over junior mining companies and those who promote their risky stocks
alike.

Suntech Deals Cast Dark Cloud over Company
For a giant solar company, Suntech (NYSE: STP) sure seems to be keeping its own investors in the dark about
some shady-looking deals.


Take Suntech’s massive sales to its majority-owned Global Solar Fund (GSF), for example, which have hung over
the company like a dark cloud for almost a year. Thanks to those transactions, which accounted for almost one-third
of Suntech’s quarterly revenue at the time, the Chinese company managed to satisfy Wall Street growth
expectations and follow up with a secondary stock offering that prevented a potential liquidity crisis. Based on
extensive research byTheStreetSweeper, however, Suntech apparently sold those solar products to itself and is still
awaiting payment on 95% of the resulting revenue that it booked to this day.

Untangling the Intricate Web Woven by InterOil's CEO
* Editor’s Note: This article has been republished with the permission of iBusiness Reporting. Click here for
access to the original story, complete with graphics of back-up documents, and similar investigative reports.


Since Interoil Corp.’s (NYSE: IOC) inception in 1997, CEO Phil Mulacek has made a habit out of doing business with
family members and leaving many of the relationships undisclosed.


For instance, during a three-year period ending in 2005, InterOil paid Direct Employment Services Corp. (DESC)
nearly $1.8 million for unspecified "services" provided by "executive officers and senior management." InterOil
disclosed that 50% of DESC was owned by Christian Vinson, who was serving at the time as InterOil’s COO and a
director of the company. 


But InterOil didn't reveal other related-party facts. For starters, Vinson is Mulacek's brother-in-law. Vinson, who has
been with InterOil from the beginning, now serves as InterOil’s executive vice president of corporate development
and government affairs, a role that places him in charge of dealing with Papua New Guinea's corrupt government.

Putting Together the Puzzle at Big Bear Mining
If Big Bear Mining (OTC: BGBR.OB) would risk hiring a bankrupt CEO with a checkered past to serve as the “public
face” of the company – and essentially give him $30 million worth of stock for the favor – then investors might want
to search for even darker secrets that the junior gold miner is still trying to keep.


They could start by examining BGBR’s original address. That address, listed in past BGBR regulatory filings as 1728
Yew St. in Vancouver, shows up in filings for several other penny stock outfits as well. Those companies share at
least one glaring trait: They count Shane Whittle, a busy Vancouver stock promoter, among their top executives.

“Based on new information I received in the last 24 hours that I was not presented with when I initially reviewed and

sell them,” DiGeorgia stated in an official press release on Tuesday. “It doesn’t matter if you’ve made money or lost

Could Big Bear Mining Investors Get Caught in a Trap?
Four years ago, regulatory filings show, Aaron Hall – the founder and largest stockholder of Big Bear Mining
(OTC:BGBR.OB) – worked as a security guard at a Vancouver nightclub while dabbling in mineral claims on the
side. When BGBR’s stock soared this month on paid promotions, however, the young Canadian suddenly found
himself worth $175 million before the company found a single ounce of gold.


If Hall sold his 72-percent stake in BGBR, still valued at $121 million despite a hit to the stock last week, the 33-
year-old Canadian could afford to retire right now as a very rich man whether the company ever strikes gold or not.
According to BGBR, however, Hall has agreed to walk away from that fortune instead. (BGBR refused to provide
Hall’s phone number, so The Street Sweeper could not call him about his decision.)

Are Medifast and Pre-Paid Legal up to the Same Tricks?


Editor's Note: This report was originally published by the Fraud Discovery Institute, which can be accessed
at www.frauddiscovery.net. 
 
With Pre-Paid Legal Services (NYSE: PPD) receiving yet another subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission last week, the Fraud Discovery Institute (FDI) reveals the points of similarity existing in the
compensation plans of both Pre-Paid Legal and Medifast (NYSE: MED). 
 
How long until Medifast receives similar law enforcement scrutiny for a business model built upon a pyramid
scheme? 
 
"Sixty-one percent of Medifast’s total revenue is derived from Take Shape for Life, the company’s multi-level
marketing division,” says Barry Minkow, co-founder of FDI. “Since both Pre-Paid Legal and Medifast must rely
heavily on their multilevel marketing pie-in-the-sky compensation structure in order to lure in new recruits, it is critical
for Wall Street investors and analysts to factor in what legal issues Medifast might be facing. And these similarities
are striking."

Mesa Energy Inc. was already a publicly traded company when it did a reverse merger with a second one, a shell
that began life as Mesquite Mining Inc. 
 
The unusual deal last August moved Dallas-based Mesa from the Pink Sheets to the Over-the-Counter market and
brought it the financing it needed to buy a promising natural gas prospect in western New York, CEO Randy M.
Griffin said. 
 
It also put 14 million cheap -- and free trading -- shares of the combined company, Mesa Energy Holdings Inc.
(OTCBB: MSEH.OB), into the hands of four stockholders from the Mesquite Mining side of the transaction.
ASharesleuth investigation found that one of them was a limited partnership linked to a convicted felon -- an ex-
stockbroker barred from the securities industry for his role in a fraud and manipulation scheme that cost investors
more than $100 million.

Does the NanoLogix Rally Make Any Sense?
The NanoLogix (OTC: NNLX.PK) stock chart featured on a YouTube video – set to the catchy “Money Song” tune
from Monty Python – looks rather outdated following this spring’s incredible, if inexplicable, spike in the company’s
share price.


When that video first surfaced in the fall of 2007, NNLX was still focused on increasing hydrogen production with the
help of grape juice while allowing Nutra Pharma (OTC: NPHC.OB) – the company’s former partner – to
pursuebreakthroughs in its current business of diagnostic technology. (NPHC’s own volatile rally, staged late last
year, has already come to an end.) Back then, NNLX’s stock had almost doubled in a month but still fetched only 15
cents a share. Since moving into the medical arena and converting a barn-like structure into a “clean room” for
producing diagnostic testing kits (with the construction project captured in yet another YouTube video), however,
NNLX has seen its stock rocket more than 200% in recent weeks to pass $1 a share.


Even Bret Barnhizer – NanoLogix’s own CEO – cannot explain that move.

With China Tel, Has Tobin Smith Been 'Outfoxed' Again?
Tobin Smith, co-star of Fox News Channel’s popular “Bulls & Bears” investment show, recently declared a
challenging new “mission in life.” In an upbeat message to his 2,700-plus followers on Twitter last week, Smith
promised to helpChina Tel Group (OTC: CHTL.OB) – a penny stock company he has been touting for months –

To be sure, CHTL could use some assistance. More than a year ago, CHTL agreed to pay $195 million for a 49%
stake in Chinacomm – an Asian broadband wireless company that ranks as its primary asset – but it still lacks the
money required to actually pay for that deal. Although CHTL has inked plenty of financing agreements in the
meantime, most recently with two mysterious firms known as Excel Era and the Isaac Organization, the company
never seems to collect promised cash from those backers in the end.

InterOil Case Packed with Explosive Bombshells

CONROE, TEXAS -- In the Montgomery County courthouse here, the five-year-old civil fraud case against InterOil
Corp. (NYSE: IOC) CEO Phil Mulacek and the companies he controls has generated thousands of pages of legal
documents that have been stuffed into three large cardboard boxes.
 


And sifting through the papers in the Todd Peters et al. v. Phil Mulacek et al. lawsuit, one gets a better sense of why
Mulacek attempted a legal Hail Mary three months ago and had one of the companies he controls file for bankruptcy
protection, a move Mulacek's attorneys said was calculated to get the Peters' litigation swept into federal bankruptcy
court and derail a potentially massive judgment. (See iBusiness Reporting’s original story here.)

Atlantic Wind and Solar (OTC: AWSL.PK) is suspected of blowing a lot of hot air in an effort to inflate the company’s

publicizing a string of stock-boosting projects secured by Hybridyne, however, AWSL suddenly announced this
month that it had canceled its acquisition of the company due to an “unfortunate default by the vendor” that rendered
the transaction “null and void.”

A company controlled by Phil Mulacek, chief executive officer of InterOil Corp. (NYSE: IOC), filed a "bad-faith"
federal bankruptcy in December in an attempt to derail a potentially massive civil judgment in a fraud case against
him and companies he controls, according to court documents filed in Houston. 
 
Less than a month after the filing, federal Judge Marvin Isgur in Houston ruled that Nikiski Partners -- a corporation
whose $2 million investment in a used oil refinery gave birth to InterOil -- had filed the bankruptcy in "bad faith."

Can the Batteries Last on Overcharged Lithium Stocks?


Lithium Corporation (OTC: LTUM.OB) sure looks a whole lot prettier in paid tout sheets than it does in its regulatory
filings.


In recent months, stock promoters have treated LTUM – a company with no revenue and just $855 in the bank – like
a surefire winner that’s poised to supply giant automakers with the lithium they will need to power tomorrow’s
battery-operated cars. The promoters offer similar reasons for their incredible confidence, led by soaring demand for

Look Again: CSKI Appears to Be Deteriorating Fast
Following a swift decline in sales, China Sky One Medical (Nasdaq: CSKI) is no longer the picture of health that it
once seemed to be. 


If CSKI's fourth-quarter results looked weak based on traditional year-over-year comparisons, those numbers look
downright painful when examined on a sequential basis. During the last three months of 2009 -- a period when
Chinese officials reportedly identified eight CSKI treatments as "counterfeit" drugs and began prohibiting their sale --
the company saw revenue decline, often precipitously, in every one of its product categories.

With a Rare Earnings Miss, CSKI Is Looking Rather Sick
China Sky One Medical (Nasdaq: CSKI) looks like it could use a miracle cure. 


The Chinese pharmaceutical company -- long known for its blowout quarters -- fell well short of Wall Street

represents the latest in a series of a recent challenges for the company, which has been accused of selling
"counterfeit" drugs in China and filing inaccurate financial statements here in the U.S.

Toreador: The Story behind the Stock's Wild Bull Run
* Click here to start/join a discussion of this article or send tips for future news stories.


  
Shortly before New York Times reporter Zachery Kouwe resigned for plagiarizing the work of others, he wrote a
speculative column about Toreador Resources (Nasdaq: TRGL) that – in an ironic twist -- spawned copycat reports
by competing journalists. Those stories, suggesting an imminent buyout of Toreador that failed to materialize, raised
some eyebrows even before Kouwe’s public fall from grace.


  
At the time that Kouwe penned his Jan. 20 “DealBook” column, Toreador desperately needed to raise money for
looming debt obligations that could trigger massive payments later on this year. As a small resource company with
ambitious plans, Toreador also needed cash to finance an expensive drilling program in Paris – home to its
controversial new vice chairman – in order to reinvent itself as a major energy player on the international stage.

With Yuhe Losing its Auditor, Could CSKI Be Next?
* Editor's Note: This report has been republished with the permission of its author, Manuel Asensio, an
accomplished investor with a track record for spotting possible fraud long before the market itself. Click
here to read more of Asensio's research on CSKI and other companies.





Last week, Yuhe International (NASDAQ: YUII) announced in a special 8-K filing that Grant Thornton was "resigning
as the company's independent registered public accounting firm effective immediately." Yuhe's stock suffered a one-
day plunge of 18% on the news. 
 
Yuhe is the product of a reverse merger between a private Chinese company and a U.S. shell company completed
in March 2008. Yuhe has been listed on the Nasdaq since October, regulatory filings show, with company leaders
tapped to ring Nasdaq's opening bell late last year. 
 
Research published by asensio.com has focused on two other Chinese reverse mergers: China Sky One
Medical(Nasdaq: CSKI) and American Oriental Bioengineering (NYSE: AOB). Moreover, asensio.com has also
published reports on regulatory deficiencies surrounding U.S. listings of questionable Chinese companies --
particularly those that trade on the Nasdaq exchange.

A private investor has filed a lawsuit against the auditor of China Sky One Medical (NASDAQ: CSKI), alleging
"fraudulent misconduct" and violation of securities laws for failing to correct CSKI's "materially false" financial

The complaint states: "MSPC became aware of the fact that the CSKI financial statements were materially false and

On Feb. 11, exactly one month after IMGG announced the latest in a series of regulatory setbacks, Janes reportedly

Following its heavily hyped reverse merger, AENY now counts CEO Christopher Headrick – a longtime dealmaker
with a history of failure – as its sole officer, director and member of its staff. Although AENY has announced plans to
expand its senior management team, the company aims to do so by hiring leaders who have benefited handsomely
from a series of generous related-party deals. One of those potential executives, already identified as a company
vice president in the past, has agreed to plead guilty to felony tax evasion charges and could face up to five years in
prison for his crime. more...

connected players in the murky world of penny stocks and offshore financing.


  
Last week, AENY suddenly announced that it had completed a merger that would transform the company into a
legitimate coal-mining operation. The move came as a surprise to many, since AENY had delayed the merger –
pending an additional $8 million in financing – just a few weeks earlier. With skeptics portraying AENY as an
overvalued corporate shell, however, the company abruptly finalized the deal after raising less than half of the $8

Last fall, around the same time that British Columbian regulators issued a cease-trading order for Americas Energy
Company (AENY.OB) stock, U.S. investors began fielding bullish emails urging them to buy the company’s shares.


  
The Intelligent Investor Report, a promotional newsletter published by Jarret Wollstein, highlighted AENY (then
trading under the ticker symbol TRET) as his top coal pick of 2009 and predicted that the company would be
producing more than $100 million worth of coal annually by the end of next year. He portrayed AENY – a shell
company with limited operations -- as a likely “10-bagger” for fast-acting investors willing to buy the shares early and

IMGG dropped a bombshell on investors this week, when it revealed a major setback in its lengthy battle to secure
regulatory approval of its Dominion 3-D scanning device. For months, IMGG has indicated that the company simply
needed to resolve one minor issue – involving the Dominion’s label – in order to satisfy reviewers at the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. During a conference call with shareholders on Tuesday, however, IMGG reported that it
has now fielded more than a dozen questions from FDA staffers who are evaluating the company’s device. more...

By now, IMGG investors have waited years for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to clear the company’s
Dominion scanner for sale under a 510(k) process that normally takes just a few short months to complete. More

After going public through reverse mergers with shell companies earlier this year, both NXTH and CLRH promptly

problem during an upcoming inspection by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
Instead, Rosen sounded an alarm during JCAHO’s annual visit and promptly resigned in protest when the agency –
which counted one of the hospital’s directors among its own board members – ignored his concerns. more...
