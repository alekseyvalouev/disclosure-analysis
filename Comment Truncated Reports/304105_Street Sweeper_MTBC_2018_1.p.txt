That’s right.


MTBC’s big, impressive partner is headquartered in a FedEx mailbox.


And what do you want to bet #156 in the address refers not to the number of a fancy suite but

The blockchain network hasn’t even been built yet.


Indeed, the “Hyperledger” technology promoted in the June 27th press release is really just an o
