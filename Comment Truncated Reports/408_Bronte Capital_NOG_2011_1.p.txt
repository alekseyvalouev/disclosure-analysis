Northern Oil and Gas: It's only a Northern Song
I have been sitting on this post for while pending the publication of an article by Mellisa Davis (of The
Street Sweeper).  She has now gone public quoting me - so here is something I have been working
on.
 
High growth subprime companies - a brief stylized history
 
Until the crisis one of the staples of my life was financial institutions which under provided for
inevitable losses and grew really fast.  Examples include Metris and Americredit - both of which
collapsed, partially recovered and were eventually taken over.
 
Before the collapse they had less-than-prime lending businesses in credit cards and auto loans
respectively.  Metris was the more pure example.  Another example was the credit card business of
Circuit City.
 
These companies understated losses.  That made them seem profitable.  That profitability is only
temporary because eventually it becomes obvious to even the most stubborn and blinkered
management that the loans are not going to pay.  When that happens a charge is inevitable - and
future profitability winds up at a lower level (more akin to economic reality).
 
However the companies in question deferred the day of reckoning.  They did this a couple of ways.
 First when someone could not pay their loan they tended to extend them more credit.  Metris’s
average balance outstanding went above $4000 (or more than double average balances at similar
companies).  That meant that when the losses (inevitably) came they were bigger.
 
The second way that they deferred the day of reckoning was just to grow really really fast.  After all, if
you don’t recognize any losses on new loans, then filling your portfolio with new loans meant your
aggregate credit looked OK, even if the old loans were toxic.  The denial solution de jour was
hypergrowth.  The hypergrowth hid problems and also (incidentally) drove stocks to the moon giving
management ample opportunity to cash out.  In other words the path that made management rich
was to make the problem bigger and bigger.
 
Sometimes before they blew up (and they inevitably blew up) you would get a signal: a quarter with
an unexpected “reserve adjustment”.  Reserve adjustment being a (belated) admission that the
reserves were not adequate.  Sometimes there was no signal except insider selling.  Mostly even the
insider selling was not a good signal because the insiders were always selling.
 
Lesson from this
 
There is a lesson I drew from this.  Be very wary of fast-growing hyper profitable companies
(especially companies in competitive industries) where the earnings are critically dependent on a
reserve or variable that has to be estimated and on which the estimate is really a guess.  This could
be lending or insurance or large contract construction with contract warranties or in this case an oil
company.  The company in question is Northern Oil and Gas (Northern): a member of the S&P mid-
cap index.
 
The Bakken shale oil plays
 
Northern Oil and Gas (and its little sister company Voyager Oil) own acreage and part shares in oil
wells in the Bakken Shale.  The Bakken Shale is one of the hotter properties in North America and is
the subject of much promotion including several (sometimes anonymous) stock promotion blogs
dedicated entirely to investing in the Bakken (see here, and here).  Some have go-go names like
“Million Dollar Way” appealing to relatively unsophisticated investors.
 
That said - the Bakken is a real oil field and it has real players and is producing a lot of oil.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Northern Oil and Gas: It's only a Northern Song


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/03/northern-oil-and-gas-its-only-northern.html 2/13


The Bakken is a large (200 thousand square miles) mid depth (typically about 10 thousand feet) and
not very wide (typically about 40 feet wide) oil bearing shale deposit.  The area overlaps two
American States (North Dakota and Montana) and one Canadian Province (Saskatchewan).
 
The field has been known about for many years because traditional oil fields underlie the Bakken and
as the wells have been drilled, small quantities of light sweet crude have been logged.  However the
technology to extract oil in quantity from the Bakken is relatively recent and involves drilling down 10
thousand feet, kicking a horizontal well down 5-8 thousand feet, putting explosives down the well to
crack the rock and then chemicals and water at very high pressure to extensively fracture the rock.
 And then the oil flows.
 
This has driven North Dakota oil production extremely well:
 


 
 
If you extrapolate graphs of production (something I don’t think you should do) then North Dakota
overtakes Alaska in 2017 to be the major US oil producing state.
 
The problem with Bakken shale oil
 
The problem with Bakken shale oil is that the pores in the rock are tight and the rock needs to be
fractured to extract it.  It is a stylized fact of oil production that the tighter the rock the faster the oil well
declines to a trickle - especially after the reservoir has been forcedly fractured.
 
This makes sense.  If the rock is homogenous, quite porous and extends over a large area you would
expect an oil well to flow for a very long time (multiple decades).  However if the rock flows only a
small amount of oil without fracturing (the small amount being the amount near the well bore) then
when you fracture it it will flow many small amounts (the small amounts being amounts near the
fracture system).  And when you have exhausted the oil that happens to be near the fracture system
then the flow should flow to a trickle as the rock is not very conducive to flow.
 
The risk with the Bakken is that the wells decline much faster than anticipated when the well is drilled
and faster than anticipated in the accounts.
 
If this happens the company will have to take a “depletion adjustment” - the analog of my subprime
company taking a “reserve adjustment”.
 
Now, also as an analog of the subprime company if the company, is drilling a whole lot of wells that
are declining faster than anticipated, it can hide this through growth.  After all, new wells don’t just
stop flowing: they need to be old wells before that happens.  And you can hide an aggregate decline
problem by drilling like crazy.  It just winds up being a bigger decline problem when you stop drilling.
 
And now you see my subprime oil company: it is Northern Oil and Gas and it is a doozy.  Market cap
is over $1.7 billion and the stock is up from 3 and a bit dollars to almost $30 since the beginning of
2009.  It is - through partners - drilling like crazy.
 
It is a strange company, despite the large market cap it only has 11 staff.  It takes minority shares in
other companies oil wells.  It does not drill anything itself.  Every well seems to strike oil (that is what it
is like in the Bakken) but because they do not operate the wells they only have limited insight into the
decline rates.  Shareholders have even less insight into the decline rates.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Northern Oil and Gas: It's only a Northern Song


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/03/northern-oil-and-gas-its-only-northern.html 3/13


Searching for a benchmark for Bakken decline rates
 
I spent a lot of time trying to find a benchmark for oil-well decline rates in the Bakken.  It's hard
because people tend to keep this information confidential especially if they are bidding for local
acreage.  Also the technology to fracture Bakken wells is relatively new and so to some extent decline
rates (especially over the out years) are just unknown.  Still, I have heard good stories about
individual wells that are flowing well after three years.  I have heard horror stories about wells that are
flowing at less than a barrel per day after one year.  The average almost certainly lies in this range.
 
I was getting hung up on a benchmark when one of my favorite bloggers Peter Sacha stepped in
with a really useful post.  In it he picked apart the accounts of Petrobakken.  Petrobakken is the major
player in the Saskatchewan Bakken.  What is more he had a decline curve.
 


 
 
Its only a decline curve for the first year - of production - and it is for a particularly big well (a seven
stage frac).  However, the initial flow rate was almost 250 barrels of oil per day and after 12 months
this had declined to 75 barrels per day.    It is a steep decline.
 
And it shows in Petrobakken’s accounts.  Peter Sacha deadpans that the company likes to report
“cash flow” which does not include the depletion allowance for wells.  He then notes the company
spent $812 million in capex most of which was to replace depleting wells.  The cash flows are
enormous - but the capital expenditure needed to maintain those cash flows are enormous - and that
is because the depletion is rapid.
 
The key analytical assumption of this blog post is that we can compare decline rates for Petrobakken
and Northern Oil.  Both Petrobakken and Northern Oil are Bakken shale producers.  Petrobakken is
just much bigger and a little older and a little more experienced with decline rates.  But both
companies have a large spread of wells in similar areas so the average decline rate (relative to
current production) should be similar.
 
Here are the accounts for the first nine months.  (I don’t give the annual accounts because Northern
Oil had an irregular depletion charge in the last quarter.)
 
For Petrobakken (and sorry you will need to click)

Note that over 9 months Petrobakken had 750 million in oil and gas sales before royalties and 654
million in net revenue.  The depletion charge was 391 million.  Depletion is 52 percent of gross
revenue and almost 60 percent of net revenue.  These wells deplete badly and the depletion charges
are large.
 
Here is Northern Oil for the first nine months (and sorry again you will need to click).

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Northern Oil and Gas: It's only a Northern Song


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/03/northern-oil-and-gas-its-only-northern.html 5/13


 
 
Note that for Northern the gross revenue for the first nine months is 35.6 million (a very small fraction
of Petrobakken).  The depletion charge plus amortisation is 8.36 million.
 
Depletion and depreciation is only 23.5 percent of gross revenue.
 
Same field.  Same geology.  Less than half the depletion rate. 
 
Same geology, same field suggests that the right approach to compare these companies is to assume
the same depletion rate for both companies.  Of course which depletion rate - Northern or
Petrobakken?
 
We could assume that Northern is right and these fields could actually last a lot longer than
Petrobakken thinks.  In which case however you should buy Petrobakken as it will generate cash flow
for years and will have already expensed the associated costs.  If Northern is right don’t buy Northern
- buy the company which is really earning far more than it says.
 
Altenatively Petrobakken is right and the right depletion rate is 52 percent of gross revenue.  In that
case for nine months the depletion plus depreciation at Northern should not equal 8.36 million it
should equal that times 52/23.5 or 18.5 million.  Instead of having income from operations of 14.4
million for the nine months as per stated you have income from operations of only 4.3 million.  Income
after tax is just over 3 million.  That is for nine months - but hey - annualize it!
 
Oh, the market cap is over $1.7 billion.
 
If I do the depreciation as per Petrobakken (and I see no reason why I should not) then this stock is
around 400 times earnings.
 
Obviously enough we are short.
 
It all swings on accounting for depletion - so who certifies the accounts?
 
All of this swings on accounting for depletion.  If you use Northern’s accounting then this is a high
growth high PE stock.
 
If you use Petrobakken’s accounting this is a lower growth stock with much higher PE and less
prospects.
 
At that point I ask who is certifying the accounts?

Well the auditor is Mantyla McReynolds.  Have you never heard of them?  Nor had I and I am a
connoisseur of obscure audit firms.
 
First I checked whether they were a local firm.  No such luck.  They are based in Salt Lake City and
Northern Oil is based in Wayzata Minnesota.  That is 1254 miles away according to Google maps.
 They went out of their way to find this auditor.
 
So who does Mantyla McReynolds audit?  I went through the SEC database to see who else is
audited by them and this is what I found:
 
 


Northern Oil and its sister company Voyager Oil.  (Voyager is run by family members of the
executive of Northern and there are some related party transactions.)


Pacific Gold Corp - stock price 3c.


GeNOsys Inc - stock price 4c.


Guide Holdings Inc - which has finally gone to meet its maker (price rounds to zero).


Northsight Capital Inc - 45c.


Studio One Media Inc - $1.28.


TC X Calibur Inc - 51c.


Other penny stocks...


 
You get the idea.  We are critically dependent on an estimated accounting expense (depletion) that is
low compared to the competition (the far more established Petrobakken) .  Further, these estimates
are certified by an auditor most associated with penny stocks.  Moreover, that auditor was chosen
despite being over a thousand miles away and having no obvious expertise in oil and gas.
 
And despite all this advantage the company took a small reserve adjustment in the fourth quarter.
 (Isn't a depletion charge the first warning?  My guess - some well actually ran dry!)
 
You can imagine that all this made me uncomfortable with the stock.
 
Alas Melissa Davis (at the Street Sweeper) has found far more about the stock than me.  And none of
it raises my comfort level.
 
What the Street Sweeper found
 
Remember my issue here is the accounting for depletion.  The whole valuation, indeed the whole
story swings on the depletion numbers, and Petrobakken gives you a good reason to doubt the
depletion numbers.
 
I recommend you read the Street Sweeper piece.  However, given that I am obsessed by the
accounting, I thought you should focus on the CFO.  Here is what the Street Sweeper says:


 
NOG appointed a new CFO early last year, records show, promoting former Vice
President of Operations Chad Winter to that important post despite his apparent lack of
credentials for the job. Winter has never registered as a certified public accountant in
NOG’s home state of Minnesota, records indicate, and (unlike the company’s other
leaders) has in fact never even reported that he holds a college degree. Even so, filings
show, Winter fills three key positions at NOG – CFO, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer – that are regularly assumed by CPAs, with established
records of experience and training, at other companies.


 
This guy looks like the least experienced guy ever to be appointed to all the finance positions at a
nearly $2 billion oil and gas company.
 
I think I can stay worried about the depletion numbers.  Short seems a reasonable bet to me.
 
 
 
John
 
PS.  The Street Sweeper suggests there is a Part II.  I look forward with anticipation as they found
plenty of stuff I did not know about this stock.
