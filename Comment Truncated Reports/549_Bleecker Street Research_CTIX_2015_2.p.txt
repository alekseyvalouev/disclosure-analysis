Cellceutix: Why An Uplisting Is Not Possible Right Now

Summary


Cellceutix has been saying it will uplist to a major exchange for almost two years.


The company does not meet the Corporate Governance requirements to uplist.


CTIX admits in its 10-K that it will be "extremely difficult" for it to do the things
required for an uplisting.


Cellceutix (CTIX) has been talking about an uplisting for a long time.


In March 2013, CEO Leo Ehrlich said in an interview with SA Contributor KarinCA that he
had met with the NYSE earlier that month (March 2013).


Q: Now that CTIX trades actively and is close to, or meeting requirements to move
to a higher exchange, are there any intentions to uplist to the Nasdaq or NYSE
MKT?


A: We are very focused on what we are working to accomplish in the near term with
the development of Kevetrin and Prurisol, but moving to a senior exchange is
definitely part of our overall plan to maximize exposure and shareholder value.
Making some preliminary plans, I had a meeting with the NYSE earlier this month to
discuss the process and was pleasantly surprised that they knew who we were
already. As I'm sure you can tell, we don't let the moss grow under our feet at
Cellceutix. We are always planning for the future, but we still recognize that there is
work to be done in the here and now. As we meet our milestones, we will move
forward. I am confident of that.


In September 2013, Cellceutix announced that it had acquired the assets from a bankrupt
PolyMedix. Mr. Ehrlich also said that Cellceutix would uplist to a major exchange "in the
near future."

As such, we have shifted our development strategy with our anti-psoriasis drug,
Prurisol, to forego the planned Proof-of-Concept trial overseas and have already
begun preparing the regulatory paperwork for the Food and Drug Administration to
initiate a larger-scale, Phase 2/3 multi-center trial. The adjustment will save us
hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of time that will now be better served
to position us to potentially have up to five clinical trials ongoing in 2014. This
acquisition dovetails very nicely in our goals to continue to build shareholder
value and uplist to a senior exchange in the near future."


In September 2014, Cellceutix announced that it was appointing Dr. Barry Schechter to
the Board of Directors and that the company was focused on an uplisting.


Cellceutix is focused on meeting the remaining requirements necessary to uplist to a
senior exchange. The Company believes that being listed on the New York Stock
Exchange or NASDAQ will serve many valuable functions, including allowing large
funds and institutions to invest who are otherwise not allowed to invest in OTC-listed
companies, increased stock liquidity, and validating market potential for Cellceutix's
extensive pipeline. Cellceutix plans to call for a shareholder meeting to elect
additional independent directors for serving on its board and audit committee in the
coming weeks. - See more


And then again, in January 2015 Cellceutix announced that it was in plans to start a
clinical trial in patients with Ulcerative Proctitis. Mr. Ehrlich also said that it was meeting
with its legal counsel that day to discuss the company's application to the NASDAQ.


Cellceutix is also pleased to inform shareholders that due to recently reported
positive events, the Company is actively moving forward with its intentions to uplist
to the NASDAQ exchange and is meeting today with its legal counsel, K&L Gates, to
review the Company's application for a move to the senior exchange.


Two days after this press release, SA Contributor KarinCA published a rebuttal to my
negative article. I encourage everyone interested in Cellceutix to read that article. In the
comments of that article, as well as on Cellceutix message boards, investors have taken
the mention of uplisting as fact. Despite Cellceutix talking about uplisting for almost two
years now, longs seem to be sure that this is the time. Is it?

The facts are that Cellceutix would not be allowed to uplist on any of the NASDAQ
exchanges as it currently stands. You can view the requirements for NASDAQ uplisting
here. CTIX meets the financial and liquidity for uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market,
which is the least stringent of the NASDAQ tiers. Here are the Financial and Liquidity
requirements


So Cellceutix can uplist on the Equity Standard to the NASDAQ Capital Market based on
the Financial and Liquidity requirements. Where Cellceutix falls short, however, is in the
Corporate Governance requirements.

Does Cellceutix have a Board made up of a majority of independent directors? It does
not? You can see the definition of what an independent director is here. The definition is:


"'Independent director' means a person other than an executive officer or employee
of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of
the issuer's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director."


Below are the NASDAQ rules for who isn't considered an independent director.

Cellceutix only has three people on its board. Leo Ehrlich, Dr. Krishna Menon, and as of
October 1, 2014, Dr. Barry Schechter. There is no majority of independent directors on the
board.


Mr. Ehrlich is not independent because he is an executive officer.
Dr. Menon is not independent because he is also an executive officer.
It does appear that Dr. Barry Schechter would qualify as an independent director.


However, according to Cellceutix's last 10-K, the company does not have any independent
directors.


Since we are not currently subject to corporate governance standards relating to the
independence of our directors, we choose to define an "independent" director in
accordance with the NASDAQ Global Market's requirements for independent
directors (NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200). We do not currently have an
independent director under the above definition. We do not list that definition on our
Internet website.


Cellceutix does not have an Audit Committee, which is a requirement for listing on the
NASDAQ. The NASDAQ rules for an audit committee are below.


The Audit Committee shall consist of three or more Directors, each of whom
shall be an independent director within the meaning of the rules of the NASDAQ
Stock Market and Section 10A of the Act. The number of Non-Industry Directors on
the Audit Committee shall equal or exceed the number of Industry Directors on the
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee shall include two Public Directors. A Public
Director shall serve as Chair of the Committee. An Audit Committee member shall
hold office for a term of one year.
