Yuhe International Addresses Allegations: Attempts at Persuasion
Unsuccessful

On June 14, 2011, Yuhe International's (NASDAQ:YUII) management conducted an
investors conference call to address the allegations and issues raised in our report
published on June 13, 2011. We participated in YUII’s conference call and were not
persuaded by management’s explanations or the documents it provided as support for its
claims to have acquired farms from Dajiang Enterprise Group Co., Ltd.


Given our misgivings about the representations made by YUII’s management during their
conference call, we once again decided to reach out to Dajiang’s Chairman, Mr.
Xuejiang Zheng to make sure there were no "misunderstandings" and to see if he could
shed more light on the situation. Our investigator had two follow up telephone
conversations with Mr. Zheng, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the day
(Beijing time) on June 15, 2011 (transcripts attached).

Key statements made by Mr. Zheng during the third and fourth calls follow:


When YUII first contacted Mr. Zheng in 2009, they proposed renting Dajiang’s breeder
farms. Mr. Zheng proposed conditions that were unacceptable to YUII so no
agreement was reached. He does not understand why YUII is claiming to have
acquired his farms but assumes the motivation was/is to mislead regulators and
investors in the US so the company could obtain/maintain a listing in the US that it is
not qualified for in China.
When Mr. Zheng was told that disclosures in YUII’s SEC filings state a down payment
of approximately $12.1 million was made he considered such claims a joke. He
categorically denies ever receiving any payment whatsoever, not even $1, from YUII.
Mr. Zheng said that, Mr. Zhentao Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Yuhe
International, visited his offices on Tuesday (June 14, 2011, Beijing time) to discuss
issues raised in Geo’s report regarding YUII’s claimed acquisition of Dajiang’s farms.
According to Mr. Zheng, Mr. Gao apologized for any inconveniences caused by this
matter but assured him that the disclosures regarding the transaction would not
harm Dajiang since they were only in English and only made in the US. Nobody
