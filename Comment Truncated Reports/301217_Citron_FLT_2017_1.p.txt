Citron gives FleetCor the Sunlight it Deserves:  
For Investors, sure …  


but most importantly, for Customers. 
 








FleetCor (NYSE:FLT) presents itself as a fuel-card company that targets 
small mom and pop businesses as well as government contracts. It has 
acquired numerous brands in the space, including ComData, Fuelman, 
FleetCards USA, Universal Fleet MasterCard, and various brands overseas.  
Seems innocuous enough.  But ... 
 


Based on Citron’s extensive research (from numerous customer, 
competitor and former employee interviews, online review of customer 
and former employee complaints, gathering of customer invoices, lawsuits, 
FOIA requests, and financial modeling), we believe FleetCor is actually a 
predatory company by design, whose core strategy is to methodically rip 
off its customers, using business practices and fees that are designed to 
deceive.

NOTE:  Before you read further.  Citron Research once again gives full credit 
to The Capitol Forum for its fine investigative work, in exposing FleetCor’s 
misdeeds.  Their political angle on the stock market is a must read for all 
investors. 
 


In a disturbing pattern we see with companies that have found ways to 
exploit customers, FleetCor has completed 72 acquisitions since 2002, 
claiming to be a “platform” company, when in reality it is just expanding a 
portfolio of abusive business practices over a wider and wider swath of its 
market niche. 
 


This report introduces readers to an assortment of fees that will appear on 
your bill if you are a customer of FleetCor.  This pattern has become so 
blatant that many of its own employees sarcastically call their employer:  
 


“Feecor”

To simplify and clarify for readers new to the FleetCor story, we have kept 
all our reference information current and concise.   If FleetCor believes we 
are at all misrepresenting what is really happening under the hood, we 
have no problem defending our statements in a court of law. 
 
FleetCor has a direct competitor named Wex---think Visa vs Mastercard.  
But what looks different here? 
 
While Wex has a broader distribution of gas station networks, its customer 
fees are only 12% of revenue, compared to FleetCor at a staggering 56% of 
revenue. 
 
Just look at the SunTrust initiation, and consider the discrepancies between 
the two companies.

To show just how outsized FleetCor’s fees are, compared to any other 
credit card, consider this chart.  Note that Synchrony Financial serves a 
lower credit quality customer buying discretionary items; it should rightfully 
be charging the highest fees in the industry.
Citron Explains FleetCor April 4, 2017 Page 4 of 14 
 


Last week the Capitol Forum published a piece that presents 
results of a FOIA request to the FTC. FTC documents show that 
over the past 6 years Wex has received only 16 billing complaints 
… compared to 438 billing complaints for FleetCor.  
 


FleetCor Abusive Business Practices are 
Starting To Catch Up with Them!  
 


These billing practices have become so aggressive and egregious that we 
believe they were a key factor in gas giant Chevron dropping FleetCor in 
favor of Wex late last year.  Despite the high cost of switching, Chevron 
could not afford to associate its corporate name with such a pernicious 
institutional “rip off” of their long-time customers.

OK, Citron -- are you feeding us old news?  NO!   The story is current and 
worse than ever!  Below is a link to recent statements, which have been 
submitted, in just the past two weeks. 
 











“This company is a scam! They kept on charging us with $3000+ 
worth of interest and all that crap for interests and other bs, stopped 
our cards and won't show me written statements on how the heck 
we reached that amount. And when I call to get this straightened out, 
they tried to brush me off the phone by just saying "Yea, we'll take 
care of that for you." and then come to find out that they didn't even 
take notes of the last conversation. I would like to dispute that 
$3000+ charge we supposedly owe this crappy company. There is no 
way that we would pay this without proof.”  (2/27/2017, BBB 
comment) 
 


“Customer service is basically nonexistent. Wait times to speak with 
an agent always exceed 90 minutes at a minimum. Emails to customer 
service take 1+ weeks to be replied to.”  (3/21/2017, BBB comment)

Let’s not forget that, for every complaint the author has gone to the trouble 
to write and publish, there are hundreds of customers receiving fleet fuel 
bills that may run dozens or hundreds of pages, who do not notice a few 
“Extra fees” tacked on … until they do. 
 


After reading hundreds of complaints from customers and former 
employees, there is one other common recurring theme among FleetCor 
customers:  the obstacles the company places in the way of paying a bill on 
time to avoid late fees.  Instead of Citron editorializing, here is a complaint 
common among FleetCor customers. 


 
http://www.automotive-fleet.com/channel/fuel-management/article/story/2011/05/pros-and-cons-


of-using-a-fuel-card-vs-a-corporate-card-for-fleet-fuel-expenses.aspx 
 


“Beginning with our bill dated 1/9/17, each of our fuel transactions 
charged were higher than that of the receipt we received at the 
pump….Unbelievably horrible way to run a business!” 
 
 


“Upon receiving my monthly statement I noticed a "High Risk Credit 
Fee" of $20, I called customer service number to ask why. The first 
call was little help but she stated that my credit dropped so they hit 
me with the fee. I proceeded to pull a credit report the very next day 
and saw 795 Fico to 809 Equifax.” 
 


“ My 2/16/2017-2/28/2017 statement has us spending only $347.64 
in fuel with admin fees of $176.76, Interest of $67.80, and late fees of 
$1328.05. After calling numerous times, every time when I hung up I 
am thinking these issues were addressed. Only to get he statement to 
find out NOTHING had been adjusted for and the cards cut off.”

And lastly in the most concise review that tells it all:

fleet-cor-universal-premium-fleet-cardFleetCorFleetCorfuelma-1351147 





And no…the Government is not immune to these aggressive billing 
practices.  Here is Fuelman marketing brochure targeting government 
contracts.  Note the clearly worded claim: 
 
“Pay no fees — no set-up fees, transaction fees, card fees or annual fees” 


http://www.fuelman.com/government-agencies.aspx 


“This company is not a fuel charge card, but rather, a FEES charge 


card.  They will eat you ALIVE in fees.  My experience has been that it 


is impossible to pay the bill to them (on time) without getting a 


$75.00 late fee.  After doing some research I have found many, many, 


many, many people with the exact same complaint(s): late billing, no-


billing, bi-weekly billing, overcharging, hidden fees, no customer 


support, non-working billing / payment portal, check-holding to 


create late fees!!!!   This is border-line criminal.” 





“We have been using the Universal Fleet Card from Fleet Core for 
almost a year and we are billed bi-weekly. Their website is dated a 
day ahead so if you try to pay the bill on the last day you are already 
"late" on your payment. On top of that, we cannot get a clear answer 
from them as far as how long it takes before they process payment. 
Someone says 2 days another says 5 days. So if I pay them "on time", 
2 days before payment is due, it'll be considered late because they 
haven't processed my payment yet. (So when is the actual due date?) 
On top of that, at some point we were placed on some list based off 
of our credit and are now being charged $3.00 for every time we 
even get gas. We were never informed and would never have signed 
up for the cards if we knew we'd be charged $3.00 just to swipe the 
card. We have been charged more money in late fees then we even 
spend on gas. It's outrageous.”

So we obviously executed a FOIA for government fuel bills, and of course 
we found hidden fees.  How much are the fees to all government agencies?  
No easy way to know, but if they are proportionate to government agencies 
as a percentage of FleetCor’s customer base, then the number easily 
stretches into the hundreds of millions. 
 


Here is an example that ended in a lawsuit where FleetCor charged 
Appalachian Labor School Foundation $1,000 a month in fees on a $7,000 
bill. 


http://www.judgmentrelease.com/news.htm 
 


While the customers are becoming aware of what FleetCor is about, the 
former employees are all well aware. 


Who cares about former employees?  Just ask Pilot Flying J.  The last 
major fleet fuel scandal that just recently got resolved with indictments 
and a hefty fine was all initiated by former employees and 
whistleblowers.

FleetCor has some of the worst Glassdoor reviews we have ever seen -- a 
company where most former employees know the scam:

Some things are just too 
close for comfort -- the good 
ole computer glitch. 
 


In the Pilot Flying J lawsuit, the FBI recorded Pilot’s actions to conceal its 
illegal activities from customers.  If a customer caught a discrepancy, the 
company would blame it on a “computer glitch”. 
 











https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/724449/randrlawsuit.pdf 
 


Pilot Flying J was busted in court for this phony excuse.  Yet, here's a 
typical current (last week, in fact) complaint about FleetCor, apparently 
using the same "hide the ball" tactic... 


Defendants falsely attributed the diesel fuel rebate scheme to “computer 
glitches” with the intention of concealing the true nature of their wrongful 
conduct. 


The conversations recorded by the FBI also reveal that Pilot took active 
steps to conceal their activities from customers and law enforcement 
officials. For example, Pilot Flying J employees withheld relevant pricing 
information from customers who inquired about their rebate amounts. If 
a customer caught a discrepancy, Pilot would blame the discrepancy on a 
“computer glitch.” 


According to Giesick, Mosher taught that if a customer caught that she 
was deceptively cutting rebate, Giesick should blame the error on a 
computer glitch.

complaints 
 


Citron has read enough complaints about FleetCor to recognize the 
pattern: they frequently tell customers they have the same type of 
“computer problems”.  Here is a response from FleetCor from just last 
month to a cheated customer:

Has FleetCor had these “system issues” for the last 8 years?  


Dear*******,    
We apologize for the inconvenience. We have experienced unforeseen 
systems issues with your account that impacted many of customers. To 
offset call wait times, we have attempted to communicate by email with

What Does Wall Street Have To Say About This????  





THEY LOVE IT, OF COURSE! 


As William Blair boasted:  





Citibank actually calls out “aggressive pricing actions” as an identified 
advantage – the rationale why an investor should buy FLT over WEX. 


 
More importantly, there are a certain group of investors who find this 
business model formulaically.  With an overly aggressive CEO and the ability 
to manipulate pricing/fees through questionable business practices, the 
company seems like it will never miss a quarter.  If you think there is a 
pattern here … there is.   Valeant, Transdigm, FleetCor. They all have larger 
than life management who compensate themselves in grand style for their 
exaggeratedly aggressive management strategies. 
 


Amazing that Ron Clark has become one of the highest paid CEO’s in the 
United States by devising a business model that rips off small businesses, 
charities, and government agencies as a core business strategy.  Pressing on 
ever more and higher fees has become the go-to strategy for filling in every 
potential quarter's shortfalls. 
 


https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/06/10/3-high-paid-ceos-youve-never-heard-of.aspx 
 


The point is that with fees generating 56% of total revenues, the company 
has become so dependent on abusive fee revenue that the stock will 
collapse when it proves unsustainable.  


“Fleet Operator Business Solutions. FleetCor has been capable of servicing 
fleets of all sizes, but until the acquisition of Comdata in November 2014, 
its strength and major focus, in our view, was in the small fleet market, 
where it could more readily charge higher-than-industry-average fees.

John Huber at Saber Capital said it best in his most recent investor letter:  
 


 
 
 
We witness the truth of that quote come to life in the past six months.  
FleetCor has lost Chevron, and they are engaged in a lawsuit over unfair 
practices with Travel America, another major customer. 
 


https://www.law360.com/articles/867875/truck-stop-co-says-fuel-card-firm-is-holding-them-up 





FleetCor “Technologies”????  Really???   
Where are the “Technologies”?? 
 


By having the word “technologies” in its name, many investors are misled,  
believing that FleetCor is an advanced payment system.  FLT stock is also 
swept up in many stock “technology” indexes (MS and GS), yet … 
 


According to its most recent 10-K, the company has spent exactly zero on 
Research and Development … Not much technology there.  Maybe they 
should fix their billing computers first. 
 


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1175454/000117545417000005/flt_10-kx12312016.htm 





“A business with good economics that is 
coupled with a business model that extracts 
value from its customers (rather than adds 
value to its customers) is not a good business. 
The financial metrics might appear attractive, 
but a parasitic relationship with customers 
usually ends up destroying shareholder value 
at some point."

  So What is FleetCor Really Worth????? 
 
If FleetCor’s fees revenues are just reduced by just 1/3 (realistically, they 
should get reduced by half), and it keeps the same multiple (which would 
go lower), the stock would trade at a 45% discount to current price.  Here is 
the quick model: 
 





Note we are not “betting on zero”. Citron understands the need for fleet 
fuel cards.  Yet, this is a highly competitive industry that is dealing with one 
very bad actor, which is clearly an outlier.
Citron Explains FleetCor April 4, 2017 Page 13 of 14 
 


 A Note to Analysts about “Only”  
Only is a dangerous word … if you’re an analyst. Citron recalls well how The 
Street reassured investors that Philidor was “only” 7% of Valeant’s 
revenue… 
 


In FleetCor’s case we hear today that “Late Fees” are “only” 6% of 
FleetCor’s revenues. 
 
So what about all these fee types we’ve found in FleetCor’s billings: 


 Account Administration Fee 


 Clean Advantage Program Fee 


 Convenience Network Surcharge 


 Credit Risk Assessment Fee 


 Default Interest Charge 


 Emergency Credit Services 


 Finance Charge 


 Fleetdash subscription 


 Handling fee 


 High Risk Transaction Fees 


 High Risk Credit Fee 


 Late Fee on Previous Invoice 


 Member Fee 


 Memo Transaction Fee 


 Minimum Usage Fee 


 Minimum Program Admin Fee 


 Report Delivery Fee 


 Service Fee 


 Transaction Fees 


 Weekend Account Admin Fee 
 


Citron’s comment:  Dear Wall Street:  You can’t have it both ways.  You 
can’t tout FleetCor as a buy because it’s so aggressive about imposing fees, 
and then defend because “late fees” are only 6% of revenues.  You owe it 
to your investors to demand from the company a full breakdown of all 
fees, so that the “hide the ball” game about how 56% of Fleetcor’s gross 
revenues comes from fees is understood, and transparency is restored to 
this game of deception.
Citron Explains FleetCor April 4, 2017 Page 14 of 14 
 





   The Reflexivity of FleetCor has just started.   


As long as Citron has fingertips and computers, we will stay on this 
company until it treat it’s customers fairly.   We have great respect for the 
Capitol Form and look forward to any political attention and pressure they 
can generate on FleetCor. 


The bulls might feel comfortable that fuel cards do not fall under the CFPB 
or the FTC, but this is much bigger.  


It is the opinion of Citron that FleetCor has business policies and systems in 
place that are designed to cheat their customers.  Please sue us, so we can 
take discovery on your management and prove our thesis.  


This is an issue that WILL go to States’ Attorney General offices and the FBI, 
if it isn’t there already.  


This Story Has Just Started … and we have a feeling we know how it will 
end. 


Cautious Investing to All
