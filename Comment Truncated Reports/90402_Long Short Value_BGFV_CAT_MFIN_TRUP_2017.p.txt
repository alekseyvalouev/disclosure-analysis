Summary


Quick Picks & Lists


My 2016, 2015, & 2014 High Conviction Shorts had an average return of -10%,
-32%, and -23% respectively.


2017 High Conviction Shorts: Medallion Financial, Home Capital Group, Caterpillar,
Trupanion, and Big 5 Sporting Group.


Success rates vs. the S&P 500 for my High Conviction Shorts have been: 75% in
2014, 100% in 2015, and 80% in 2016.


This article is a follow-up to my previous articles of a similar title for 2014, 2015, and
2016. In this article, I will lay out my top Shorts for 2017 as well as review my picks from
2016. Most of my shorts are in the small and mid-cap space, but on the short side, I
focus on all market capitalization stocks, as the most radical overvaluation can be found
at extremes in the very high capitalization stocks.


Below is a summary table of how my picks did from 2016.

All of my short picks for 2016 generated positive alpha outside of Ferrari (RACE). Shake
Shack (SHAK), Mobileye (MBLY), and Wayfair (W) were all stellar short positions all
year, allowing good traders a few different opportunities to short throughout the year. All
three of these worked almost immediately in January as the market headed down, with
all of them struggling to fully recover the rest of the year. In contrast, Amplify was up for
most of the year, peaking at around $16.25 per share. Amplify finally came crashing
down after it reported Q3 results. It ended the year at its 52-week low. Amplify took
almost all year, but it eventually paid off for shorts, as the gross margins eventually gave
out and the market realized it was a one-trick pony. I have now racked up 3 years in a
row of recommending shorts that generated both positive alpha and positive absolute
returns.


Here are my top picks for 2017.


Medallion Financial (MFIN)


Medallion Financial is a specialty finance company that specializes in taxi medallion
lending and other high risk-return loan categories. The company structure is very
complicated and includes subsidiaries that consist of LLCs, Small Business Investment
Companies (SBICs), Regulated Investment Companies (RICs), a Utah-based FDIC
regulated bank, an LLC that owns a majority stake in a professional Lacrosse Team, an
LCC that engages in art dealing, and an LLC that owns a minority stake in a racing
team. Overall, it's the type of business that no one should ever want to own. The
company is structured in a way that makes accounting difficult and creates opportunities
to manipulate the parent company's financials. Great Quarter (@GreatQuarter on
Twitter) recently posted this summary of the inter-relationships between the entities that
highlights my point.

The crux of Medallion's problem is that the entrance of Uber (UBER) into the market has
all but destroyed the value of taxi medallions. Medallion Financial has an enormous
level of exposure to taxi medallions, both through medallion loans and ownership of
medallions. The company has massively under-provisioned for losses and holds these
taxi medallions on its books at massive premiums to the underlying value measured by
the recent transactions in the marketplace. Several recent articles highlight the many
problems that Medallion faces, I highly recommend that you read both by Permabear
Part1 and Part2. Here is a quick list of the issues/reasons that make Medallion a good
short and a future bankruptcy.


At least one of Medallion subsidiaries is being sued (in this case by Metropolitan
Bank) for defaulting on its loan. It is possible that two other banks (New York
Commercial Bank and Valley National Bank) are also suing Medallion for loans
associated with Chicago Medallions. All of this debt in question is guaranteed by the
parent corporation Medallion Financial.


1.


It is running dangerously low on cash, estimated by Great Quarter to be $4.8m at a
corporate level as of the end of Q3 (see above graphic). I believe the actual current
cash balance available may be much lower, as highlighted by the August 8-K, in
which it revised its loan agreement with Sterling Bank to offer to sell Artwork and pay

them cash. I can't think of another reason why you would sell artwork in likely a
distressed sale to raise cash unless you are very low on cash.


Recent revolver with DZ was extended but closed to future withdrawals. Suggesting
DZ was willing to give it more time to try and turn things around but not lend it any
more money.

On December 16th, the CFO recently sold ~1/3 of his MFIN Stock.4.


Its Chicago and New York Taxi Medallions are held at massive premiums to
transactions in the marketplace and its competitors like ConnectOne (CNOB).


5.


Medallion's Loan 90-day delinquency rate jumped to 19.4% in Q3 compared to
13.5% in Q2.


6.


I see no way that the company is not bankrupt and the equity worthless a year from
now.

Home Capital Group (HCG.CA) (OTCPK:HMCBF)


Home Capital Group (HCG) is a Canadian Holding company that owns Home Trust
Corp. Home Trust Corp operates as a federally regulated trust company offering
residential and non‚Äêresidential mortgage lending, securitization of insured residential
first mortgage products, consumer lending and credit card services which is a mortgage.


I came upon the company after reading the Spring 2016 Graham and Doddville
interview with Marc Cohodes. Marc, who I highly respect as a short seller, laid out a very
convincing case for shorting HCG. HCG has a history of poor internal controls,
fraudulent lending practices, a management that has been dishonest in the past, and
history of under-provisioning for loan losses. HCG has been able to continue on largely
due to a very healthy Canadian Housing market that might just be at its peak.

In my opinion, HCG will likely be the first Canadian Mortgage Lender to go bust when
the Canadian Housing Market cools off. HCG has a massive amount of unsecured
mortgages relative to its equity position and would easily be wiped out by any material
increase in home loan defaults in Canadian markets. HCG is akin to the subprime
lenders in the US before the 2008 housing crisis that for the most part all went bust.
HCG has the most exposure to Toronto Ontario, with $15b CDN of its $17.9b CDN loans
originating in Ontario.


2017 may be the year that the Canadian Housing market finally cools. Several signs
have already arisen that a few Canadian markets are already contracting, specifically in
Toronto and Vancouver. Home prices in Canada are up 14.5% year over year. In Toronto
and Vancouver, home prices are up 20% and 19% respectively. Chinese investors were
previously flowing millions into Canada to buy property mainly in Toronto and Vancouver
markets, which have driven up prices across the country. Here is a great quote from a
recent article in the Huffington Post Canada that highlights just how out of hand the
Chinese Investment in these two markets is.


Last year, Vancouver planner Andy Yan conducted a study showing that 66% of homes
on Vancouver's affluent west side were owned by people with non-anglicized Chinese
names.


The BC government in Vancouver recently introduced a foreign investment tax of 15% in
an effort to bring down money flowing into their real estate market from China. It seems
to have worked, as home prices have started to decline in Vancouver.

Toronto may follow Vancouver and institute a similar foreign investment tax. Even if
Toronto doesn't add a similar tax and the bubble continues to grow, eventually it will pop.
I think 2017 will likely finally be the year it does, and it will take HCG down with it.

Caterpillar (CAT)

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
Much has been made of the Caterpillar long and short thesis over the last year. On the
short side, many famous short sellers including Jim Chanos and David Einhorn have
laid out the argument why Caterpillar is a great short. On the long side, many have
argued that a Trump presidency will give Caterpillar a massive shot in the arm through
new US infrastructure spending. You can go back and forth on what will or will not
happen and how it impacts Caterpillar. I will keep my short thesis focused on the only
thing that matters for Caterpillar, China.


Chinese construction investment to build out their country's infrastructure from the early
2000s to about 2015 (with the transition to the current 5-year plan) was a once in a
lifetime effort that is now winding down. The amount of demand for materials needed for
this effort created the commodities super cycle that has just recently ended. This in turn
created a massive demand for construction and mining equipment for which Caterpillar
was a large beneficiary. It also created a massive amount of capacity for this type of
machinery that is currently being underutilized. Chinese construction investment grew
by 4x over the last 10 years.


With the transition to the next 5 year plan that started in 2016, that level of construction
investment will plateau and potentially decline in China over the next 5-10 years. It is
simply just not long term sustainable to spend on construction like this.

No amount of incremental US infrastructure spending (i.e. Trump Plan) will supplement
the losses in revenues from this structural change in global construction and mining
spending. Caterpillar's 2017 and 2018 EPS forecast is currently for $3.03/share adjusted
excluding restructuring charges. I think based on its leverage, ongoing restructuring
charges, and very poor long-term outlook, Caterpillar shares are probably worth around
$50.

Trupanion (TRUP)


Trupanion sells insurance for cats and dogs (not directly to them but to their owners).



http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/index.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRUP?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
Trupanion was IPOed in July 2014 at a price of $10 a share. Trupanion was originally
venture backed by Maveron, a Howard Schultz Venture Capital company. Trupanion has
put a luster and shine on one of the oldest businesses in the world, insurance. Pet
insurance is a new and fast growing segment of insurance, as millennials are spending
more on pet healthcare and feeling more attached to their pets. This trend is real and I
don't doubt that Pet insurance will continue to grow. What I do doubt are the margins,
valuation, and business moat of Trupanion.


Trupanion trades at 2.6 times TTM sales and 10.6 times book value. Sales in this case
are premiums paid on its insurance policies. It's a fast growing business with insurance
like margins, except it doesn't have any significant float to invest like every other
insurance company in the world. The company has $28.7m of short-term investments,
or 6.1% of current market capitalization. Assuming it can earn 6% on that, we are talking
about $1.7m of investment income next year. On top of the razor thin insurance margins
(currently negative), we are looking at break-even earnings at best for 2017 and 2018.


On top of that, there have been questions raised about its long-term moat and ability to
keep up top line growth at +20%. In regards to insurance, there is no real moat outside
of brand name. There are two outcomes for Trupanion from here. 1) Its Pet Insurance
Business is on average a low margin business basically like most other types of
insurance, the stock falls as the hype and valuation are way out of line. 2) Its Pet
insurance has very high margins (I can't explain why but come along with me). Margins
are high and business is great, until all of the insurance companies not in Pet insurance
see the margins. Boom goes to bust as the market floods with competitors due to the
high margins and very small moat. As you can see in either scenario, Trupanion's
business and stock are destined to struggle.


So how is the Pet insurance landscape shaping up for 2017? It is very crowded. There
are a ton of Pet insurance companies now operating in the US; likely over 20. Here are
the major players:
Source: www.caninejournal.com/pet-insurance-comp.../


Nationwide and Geico (through a partnership with Embrace) have both entered the pet
insurance market as well. The landscape is getting crowded, and as you can see from
the above comparison, Trupanion is likely in the middle of the pack in terms of overall
quality and value.


Trupanion has other negatives outside of a questionable business model including:
massive insider selling since the IPO and violations with individual state laws &
subsequent fines. Trupanion was a very hot short earlier in the year, I think it will likely
become one as it continues to post disappointing earnings all of 2017 and revenue
growth continues to slow.

Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV)


Big 5 Sporting Goods operates 432 sporting goods and apparel stores on the west
coast. It operates as one of the last few sporting goods operators in what is a dying
retail category. The stock was up 81% last year as it had a really strong Q3, in part
because most of its competitors closed down. Detroit Bear provided solid short thesis in
his recent article here. I have little to his short thesis other than I do believe that sporting
goods stores have been for the large part completely disrupted by Amazon (AMZN),
other online retailers, and even department stores like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart
(WMT). In the short to medium term, that disruption will affect sales levels at Big 5
Sporting Goods.
