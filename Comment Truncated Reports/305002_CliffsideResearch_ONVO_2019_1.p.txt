➢ ONVO essentially admitted on their recent earnings call that their current business will never be 


profitable and is purely a “funding mechanism” for advancing their therapeutic tissue program 


(NovoTissue) to clinical trials. 





➢ We do not believe NovoTissue will ever receive FDA approval, but in a best-case scenario it 


appears approval is not likely until 2024 at the very earliest. 





➢ Recent preclinical studies reveal NovoTissue is only effective to a depth of 1mm on mice livers 


and biomarker data appears too small to be meaningful even for a mouse.  





➢ Due to the vast discrepancy between the size of mouse livers and human livers, which at 3lbs 


are the largest internal organ in humans, we conclude NovoTissue will be ineffective in treating 


human liver diseases. 





➢ Research reveals that 10 – 30% of liver hepatocytes would need to be replaced by NovoTissue to 


produce therapeutic benefit to patients. 





➢ ONVO intends to produce “dollar-sized” sheets of NovoTissue for implant although the current 


Director of Therapeutics admitted as recently as March that printing tissue that large is a 


challenge that still lies ahead. 





➢ ONVO is unable to print thick tissue because they can only vascularize NovoTissue to a depth of 


1mm at most. 





➢ Like human livers for transplant, human liver tissue used in NovoTissue is in short supply, is 


difficult to proliferate in vitro, and has limited viability. 





➢ ONVO claims the market for NovoTissue is $4bil but our estimate is that they would be lucky if 


their initial indication in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is worth even $40mil.  





➢ ONVO’s recent foray into “disease modeling” is a tiny market worth only $80mil cumulatively 


over five years and requires costly customization for each project. 





➢ ONVO hopes to collaborate with partners but has already had what we consider to be four 


major collaboration failures including Pfizer, United Therapeutics, Merck & L'Oréal. 





➢ ONVO has diluted shareholders by 72% since 2013 and said they will continue to dilute.

Hope Springs Eternal: 


Founded in 2007, Organovo Holdings, Inc. (ONVO) came public via reverse merger in February 2012 into 


an OTC listed company called Real Estate Restoration and Rental.  Spencer Trask Ventures was the 


placement agent.  In the process they raised $6.5mil in private placement funding.  In 2013 ONVO 


uplisted to the NYSE and moved to NASDAQ in 2016.  They are serial issuers of equity, having raised cash 


via equity every year since coming public and substantially diluting shareholders in the process.  2018 


was a light year for equity issuance although they continued to access capital via an at-the-market 


(ATM) facility (which they plan on continually accessing as needed). Since they burn well over $20mil per 


year in cash, they have about two years of cash left and are likely setting up for a sizeable raise over the 


next year or so.  Since 2013 ONVO has grown the share count by about 72%.

Organovo has a long history of over promising and under delivering.  It appears those new to the story 


believe there is hope for a miraculous turnaround based on exciting results from the company’s 


preclinical 3D therapeutic tissue (NovoTissue) studies and renewed interest in their 3D bioprinted tissue 


(exVive3D) for disease modeling.  We believe nothing could be further from the truth.

When ONVO reported FQ4 on May 31st initially it looked like another ho-hum quarter.  Revenue came in

stock was down nearly 30%.  The conference call revealed a highly disappointing perspective of the 


current business and what looked benign on the surface was incredibly shocking to those who were 


paying attention to detail.  To explain why, first we’ll provide some background for context. 





The Pivot 
 


For the past several years ONVO has tried to expand usage of their 3d bioprinted liver tissue, exVive3D, 


in toxicology testing.  Toxicology testing is a highly competitive low margin business and ONVO couldn’t 


get any traction primarily based on the high price of exVive3D vs. competitive offerings.  In FQ2 new 


CEO Taylor Crouch decided to take the company in a different direction.  Instead of focusing on 


expanding use of exVive3D in toxicology testing, he shifted to disease modeling.   





Disease modeling is a much smaller market, but it appears to have better (gross) margins and few 


competitors.  For the last couple of quarters ONVO has focused on expanding exVive3D in disease 


modeling while selling commodity human liver and kidney cells via their Samsara Sciences subsidiary.  


These are the company’s primary sources of revenue.  The long-term goal remains FDA approval for 


NovoTissue.   





Samsara is growing but it’s a commodity business controlled by the available supply of human tissue.  


According to ONVO, in fiscal 2018 (F18) Samsara revenue was “over $1mil.”  When we spoke with the 


company they said Samsara wasn’t created as a profit center, but as a source for cheaper liver & kidney 


cells to fund internal studies.  They sell what they don’t use to third parties.  Therefore, we have no 


reason to think Samsara will do anything other than continue to suck cash out of the business.    





Revelations 
 


So far, ONVO has had difficulty getting traction in disease modeling.  Following the pivot to disease 


modeling, ONVO lowered revenue guidance twice in F18 and still came in at the low end.  None of this is 


particularly surprising for a company that regularly misses revenue targets and is years from 


profitability, so why was the stock down 30% after reporting FQ4?  What was revealed in the FQ4 call 


was that the CEO views disease modeling purely as a “funding mechanism” for NovoTissue.  This is 


highly significant since NovoTissue (therapeutic tissue) is several years from possible approval and 


Samsara with just over $1mil in revenue last year is the only other “meaningful” source of revenue.  


Below is a quote in response to an analyst question about disease modeling revenue.   





“first and foremost, we now view these as funding mechanisms for our main mission, 


validation and exploration of key functionality of our tissues and finally, actually, as a 


way to generate new pipeline and new pipeline ideas. So we're just fundamentally 


moving away from a tools or P&L orientation to that side of the business and focusing 


much more heavily on our midterm goals to bring therapeutic products to the 


marketplace.”

According to the CEO, disease modeling is a “funding mechanism” for therapeutic products 


(NovoTissue).  They are “moving away” from a “P&L orientation.”  We surmise that these are comments 


made when you have no intention of ever turning a profit on the existing business!  In other words, 


THEY HAVE GIVEN UP ON EVEN TRYING TO TURN A PROFIT IN DISEASE MODELING!!!   





Again, disease modeling and selling commodity liver cells via Samsara are the primary source of ONVO 


revenue for the foreseeable future.  In addition to the disease modeling bombshell, they also chose not 


to provide revenue guidance for fiscal 2019 (F19) and the reason for doing so wasn’t exactly confidence 


inspiring.   





“As you’ve looked back over the last year-and-a-half and evaluated our approach to 


giving revenue guidance, one thing we concluded is that we are providing a disservice 


to shareholders to try and predict our immediate revenue inflection points.” 





~CEO Taylor Crouch, FQ4 transcript 





Not to worry, even if they did provide guidance, it appears they have no intention of turning a profit on 


it!  This leaves ONVO investors with nothing more than a cash sucking science project funded by 


shareholders to advance efforts in NovoTissue, a product several years from any possible FDA 


approval.  ONVO guided to cash burn of $22mil to $24mil for F19 and there is no reason to believe they 


won’t burn at least that much every year going forward.  In our opinion, this simply shouldn’t be a public 


company.   





We believe ONVO investors should be asking themselves one question:  


Is this company toast?

We believe the answer to that question is an emphatic “yes!” 
It appears the only conceivable way ONVO could ever reach profitability is upon FDA approval and 


market wide acceptance of NovoTissue, but as we’re about to explain, we don’t believe that will ever 


happen.  





Why We Believe NovoTissue Will Fail 
 


What is NovoTissue?  


ONVO’s long-term goal is to seek FDA approval to treat genetic liver diseases broadly known as Inborn 


Errors of Metabolism (IEM) with 3d bioprinted therapeutic tissues they call NovoTissues.  IEM leads to 


deteriorating liver function and eventually requires a liver transplant.  ONVO’s goal is to produce thin 


dollar-sized patches of NovoTissue that are engrafted to a human liver.  Liver based NovoTissue is made 


of human hepatocytes (liver cells) and key non-parenchymal cells found in the liver including hepatic 


stellate and endothelial cells.  ONVO hopes NovoTissue will provide patients a bridge to transplant, or 


possibly as a substitute to liver transplant.  Implanting the tissue requires surgery and to date in 


preclinical studies the tissue is only viable up to 125 days, or a little over 4 months. 


ONVO is initially seeking FDA approval for NovoTissue to treat a type of IEM called alpha-1 antitrypsin 


(AAT) deficiency.   AAT deficiency is a genetic disease cause by mutation of the AAT gene.  AAT 


deficiency leads to lung and liver damage.  Liver damage caused by AAT deficiency can lead to cirrhosis 


requiring liver transplant.  Like disease modeling and toxicology testing before it, seeking approval for 


therapeutic tissue (NovoTissue) is nothing new and has been a goal of the company from the very 


beginning.  We believe most of the recent excitement in the stock has been based on positive results in 


recent preclinical NovoTissue studies on mice.  We have found several major hurdles that we believe 


make any approval in NovoTissue impossible.  





Reason 1: A Matter of Scale 
 


On October 20th, 2017 ONVO published a press release that provided the most current preclinical data 


to date for NovoTissue’s therapeutic impact on AAT deficient mice.  The importance of these results 


cannot be overstated.  Now that the company has abandoned advancement in toxicology testing, and 


disease modeling looks like nothing more than a shareholder funded science project, NovoTissue 


approval is currently the only light left at the end of the tunnel for investors.  AAT deficiency is the first 


indication ONVO plans to submit to the FDA for NovoTissue approval. 





The press release stated that the “pathologic evaluation of diseased animals receiving implanted 


bioprinted liver tissues [NovoTissue] suggests an approximately 75% reduction in pathologic hallmarks 


of the disease in treated animals versus non-treated control animals in the region of implant.”  Wow!  


That sounds spectacular! But let’s take a closer look at what they said.

Note the point at the end where they say, “in the region of implant.”  It’s a bit cryptic.  The “region” of 


implant could mean anything but they chose not to define it in the press release.  It’s common in press 


releases for companies to brush over the details without getting too granular.  Often the minutiae of 


clinical data are too complex for the casual observer to understand and it’s easier to wrap results in a 


nice tiny package and put a bow on it.  And let’s face it, most investors probably don’t look beyond what 


is said in the press release anyway, but we like minutiae so we decided to investigate.  We found our 


answer in the company’s poster presented in October of last year at the American Association For the 


Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and it turns out the “region” wasn’t difficult to understand at all. 





“Reduction in globule number of ~75% was seen in treated vs. 


sham-operated animals at 125 days post implantation, in the region 


surrounding the [NovoTissue], to a depth of approximately 1mm.”  
 


The “region” of improvement only extended to a depth of 1 millimeter.  Let that sink in for a minute.  


This happens to coincide with the approximate thickness of NovoTissue.  In case you’ve forgotten your 


metric system measurements, we’ve provided a miniature ruler below.

(for approximation only) 





Now consider the size of a mouse liver vs a human liver.  A depth of 1 millimeter might mean a lot for a 


tiny mouse liver, but how much is that going to help a human liver?  The human liver is the largest 


internal organ in the body, weighing in at 3 to 3.5lbs on average.  In places it’s up to 6 inches (152.4mm) 


thick.  Initially, ONVO is focusing on pediatric treatment.  Perhaps NovoTissue could work on smaller 


livers?  We doubt it.  An entire mouse weighs about 20 - 25 grams, or about 0.05lbs.  A mouse liver 


weighs around 1 -2 grams.  2 grams is 0.0044lbs.  Newborn infant livers weigh approximately 150 


grams, or about 100x a mouse liver.  A one-year old’s liver is approximately 400 grams, or 266x a 


mouse liver.

If even the smallest human liver is far too big for therapeutic effect, how can anyone think NovoTissue 


will be able to treat the human population at large?  It is estimated that to induce normal liver function, 


at least 10% and up to 30% of the diseased liver needs to be replaced by healthy, functioning liver cells 


(hepatocytes).   





When you consider the vast difference in size between mouse 


and human livers and the amount of NovoTissue required for 


therapeutic impact, it is very hard to imagine NovoTissue 


producing clinically meaningful results on humans if the impact 


only extends to a depth of 1mm!!!

Reason 2: Wonky Data 
 


This same AASLD poster on AAT deficient mice provided other reasons for concern.  The study found 


that mice implanted with NovoTissue saw improved liver function for up to 125 days with increases in 


key biomarkers including human albumin (hAlbumin) and human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT).  We found 


the poster presented the data in the best light and was arguably deceptive.   





One of the key charts in the poster displayed human albumin (hAlbumin) concentration in the blood of 


PiZ mice implanted with NovoTissue.  Albumin is a protein found in blood that is produced by the liver.  


Finding hAlbumin indicated successful engraftment of NovoTissue.  In our opinion, the chart on 


hAlbumin concentrations implied Albumin levels were steadier than they really were over the 90-day 


observation period.  In the chart below from the poster presentation, you can clearly see the scale was 


adjusted for the most extreme observations between days 14 to 35.  The casual observer may assume 


the hAlbumin concentration levels were more consistent over the entire period, when in reality there 


was a massive, short-term spike.

Not only do study results indicate NovoTissue did not result in a long-term sustained increase of 


hAlbumin in mice, it appears the amount found was miniscule, even for a mouse.  As you can see in the 


chart above, hAlbumin peaked at day 21 in mice at about 250 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml).  A 


nanogram is 1 billionth of a gram.  A study conducted to determine serum protein levels in common 


laboratory rodents found that the blood of a typical adult lab mouse contains roughly 2-3 grams per 


deciliter (g/dl) of albumin.  Converting g/dl to ng/ml and assuming the midpoint of the range equates to 


25,000,000 ng/ml of albumin in a common lab mouse.  This implies that the 250 ng/ml of hAlbumin 


found in ONVO’s mice study was about .00001% of the typical amount of albumin found in lab mice.  


HAlbumin concentrations in human blood is roughly double that of mice (3.5-5.0 g/dl).   





It’s important to note that the study utilized hAlbumin as a biomarker to demonstrate engraftment and 


the amounts of hAlbumin are not equivalent to hAAT, but if the miniscule increases in hAlbumin are any 


indication of the increases in hAAT, we do not believe NovoTissue will be efficacious.  ONVO also 


provided a chart of hAAT concentration, but instead of showing the absolute concentration in ng/ml

they provided it as a percentage relative to sham.  We noted that several observations appear to be 


below some sham mice.  The results appear weak with a short-term increase led by a return to levels 


near sham.  Again, we doubt the efficacy of NovoTissue to treat AAT deficiency based on these results.

Reason 3: It Requires Too Much Healthy Tissue 
 


The liver is the only internal organ capable of natural regeneration.  Still, even with this unique capability 


there needs to be a minimum amount of healthy tissue to induce regeneration.  Unfortunately, there 


are two major obstacles hampering liver cell tissue therapies like NovoTissue. 





A. Supply - Although hepatocytes have shown amazing regeneration capability in vivo (in the 


body), they are notoriously difficult to proliferate in vitro (outside the body).  This issue appears 


to apply to NovoTissue.  NovoTissue is not grown, it is “printed” from liver cells sourced from 


human bodies.  This means NovoTissue is made of human liver tissue, and like livers available 


for transplant, liver tissue is in low supply.  Study after study highlights that the primary 


limitation for cell transplantation therapies is a severe lack of adequate supply of primary 


human hepatocytes due to donor shortage.

Cliffsideresearch.com 
 


12 
 





B. Demand - As we stated earlier, an adult human liver weighs up to 3.5lbs.  Hepatocytes are the 


primary functioning cell (parenchymal cell) in the liver constituting about 80% of its mass.  An 


adult liver contains about 200 billion hepatocytes.  Earlier we established that to produce 


therapeutic impact requires replacement of at least 10% and up to 30% of the livers 


hepatocytes.  Therefore, we estimate that a cell replacement therapy like NovoTissue would 


need to contain a minimum of 20 billion healthy, functioning hepatocytes to replace 10% of the 


liver.  Realistically, to be effective we speculate this figure is probably closer to 20% of liver 


mass, equal to 40 billion hepatocytes. 





Reason 4: Production Limitations 
 


In addition to short supply, ONVO faces other production limitations that they will need to overcome to 


make NovoTissue therapeutic implants a reality.  Currently the company provides exVive3D liver tissue 


in 24-well assays that contain a very small amount of tissue as seen in the photo below.  This tissue in 


each well is approximately 3 to 4 millimeters wide and .5 millimeters thick.     





 
Source: Organovo  





ONVO intends to produce dollar-sized sheets of NovoTissue for implant in humans.  To date we found 


no proof that the company is capable of printing dollar-sized sheet of NovoTissue.  According to a 


Financial Times article from March 4th of this year, Ben Shepherd, Director of Therapeutics at 


Organovo believes “the challenges ahead are about increasing the size of the tissue that can be 


grown.”  We feel it is entirely possible that they will not be able to scale production to this size.  The 


tissue may lack uniformity, or parts of the tissue may begin to die before printing is complete.  Since the 


tissue is so thin, even if they can scale production to a dollar-sized patch, the tissue may lack structural 


integrity making it too delicate to handle.  This brings up an obvious question.  Why not print thicker 


tissue?

13 
 





Reason 5: Vascularization 
 


The reason ONVO doesn’t print thicker tissue is because they can’t.  When we spoke with the company 


they said the thickest tissue they’ve been able to produce is about 1 millimeter thick.  The reason for 


this is due to lack of vasculature.  Living tissue requires nutrients and oxygen typically supplied via blood 


through vasculature.  Lack of vascularization is the primary limiting factor to producing thicker tissue.  


Beyond a depth of about 1mm the tissue will not survive.  As a result, they are only able to print a very 


thin amount of living tissue.  This is not an obstacle that will be easy to overcome.  The company has 


been faced with this issue from the beginning and has appeared to make almost zero progress toward 


creating thicker tissues.  An interview with Xconomy in 2011 with former founder and CEO Keith Murphy 


reveals the obstacles in place then are the same obstacles in place today. 





“The next challenge is getting to greater and greater vascularization of the construct.  


The emerging story is going to be, who can make thicker tissues with more blood 


vessels inside?” 





       ~Former CEO Keith Murphy 





Reason 6: Other Bioprinting Challenges 
 


3d bioprinting presents several other challenges that ONVO will have to overcome to make NovoTissue 


a reality.  For example, bioink viscosity is also very important to creating thicker tissue.  When liver cells 


are printed, they are extruded through a nozzle.  If the bioink is of high viscosity (thick), then there is 


added pressure on the cells that can damage their viability.  Bioprinting generally requires low viscosity 


(thin) bioink to maintain cell viability.  When the cells are printed with low viscosity ink, the material 


spreads after ejection from the nozzle.  The spreading of the bioprinted material makes it difficult to 


print thick tissue.  Ultimately, we believe the money will run out long before they are able to 


overcome these challenges.

NovoTissue is Several Years from Possible Approval:
