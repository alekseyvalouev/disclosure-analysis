CARBO Ceramics: Will You Take The Bait?

Summary


Our updated analysis of the FracFocus database incontrovertibly demonstrates that
CRR’s largest remaining customers are moving away from ceramics to sand
completions.


CRR quietly busted a leverage covenant at the end of January and today is in near-
term danger of another covenant violation.


We believe that a near‐term dilutive equity raise can only buy a few more quarters of
further balance sheet runway and will only serve to delay the inevitable.


1-year target price for CRR is $6.00 per share, which reflects a 40% probability that
CRR fails this year and a 60% probability of a $10.00 per share equity raise.
