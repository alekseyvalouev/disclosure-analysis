Sino Clean Energy
(SCEI)
Investigatory
Report -
Overstated
Revenues?
Apr. 26, 2011 2:16 PM ET13 comments


We recently completed on-the-ground due diligence on Sino Clean Energy
(NASDAQ: SCEI) regarding its Tongchuan facility and uncovered what we
consider to be substantial misrepresentations by the company about its
operations. As originally indicated in an earlier alert, we currently have a short
position in SCEI.


GeoTeam's Findings


What follows are some highlights of our findings:


1. Facility and Production Lines: Why Aren't They Operating?


Our investigators visited SCEI's Tongchuan facility at Wangjiabian Village,
Dongjiahe Town, Yaozhou District, Tongchuan Shaanxi Province. SCEI claims to
have three production lines in this facility that provide a total capacity of
550,000 tons.See page 19 of the 2010 10-K


However, our investigators relayed that there is likely only one production line
in operation.
