Bulls Should Open Their Eyes And See The Real GlassesOff

Summary


GlassesOff is an intriguing concept, but expectations are currently too high.


With revenue of only $29k against a $70 million market cap, GlassesOff is an
attractive short.


GlassesOff will have trouble growing revenue, since its product is going up in price
and there are cheaper options.


GlassesOff, Inc (GLSO) is a developmental-stage company that seeks to improve your
eyesight through use of its iPhone app. The stock has been hyped by several overly
aggressive analyst reports, and I believe that investors will ultimately be disappointed by
the results of an investment in GlassesOff.


Background


GlassesOff is the result of a reverse merger with Autovative Products, Inc. Originally
named Ucansi, it changed its name to GlassesOff after the reverse merger, and began
trading on the OTC Market.


GlassesOff would like to have you think that it has an app that improves eyesight, and so
effectively that people will pay a substantial premium for it. The reality is much fuzzier, and
bulls should be asking themselves some questions.

As you can see, GlassesOff suggests that with the help of its app, you will improve your
vision and no longer need to use glasses. From the 10-K, GlassesOff claims:


Our proprietary technology enables us to develop software product solutions
that enhance the image processing abilities of the brain and therefore improve
a person's near vision sharpness and reading capabilities. Our unique software
approach provides an alternative to existing solutions, which generally rely on
magnifying devices, typically reading glasses. The Company's technology platform is
based on advanced scientific research of image processing functionality, and our
solution utilizes the remarkable ability of the brain's plasticity (the brain's ability to
change), which constitutes the neuronal basis for "perceptual learning", that is,
repeated practice on a demanding visual task. Our founder's academic research into
the area of image processing functions during the last 20 years has yielded a
breakthrough in perceptual learning methodologies, which enhance visual skills by
improving image processing speed and efficiency in the visual cortex of the brain
without altering optical functions. The use of perceptual learning methodologies
improves both the processing speed and the sensitivity through repetitive exercise of
the brain's image processing function, resulting in improved near vision sharpness
and improved reading capabilities.


So GlassesOff claims to have an app that improves the image processing abilities of the
brains, and therefore (this part is important) it actually improves your near-vision
sharpness and ability to read. The academic paper that GlassesOff cites in several press

releases and on its website makes a somewhat different claim. This academic paper
suggests that in fact, perceptual learning can help improve vision in people with
presbyopia.


Our results, consistent with previous studies, show that perceptual learning can
improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in persons with presbyopia, and in
some cases, result in performance levels similar to the young control group.
Moreover, here we show that training also improves suprathreshold contrast
discrimination and reading speed for small letters. Our study is the first to show
conclusively that these improvements are not due to improved optical
performance of the eye (accommodation, pupil size or depth of focus).


More importantly, however, it also was the first study to conclusively prove that the
improvements are not actually due to your eyes being any better. If you take those tests
long enough, your eyes will likely train themselves to see what you need to pass the test,
but your vision in real life will likely not have improved at all. A well-respected
ophthalmologist agrees with my assessment, as Michelle Rhee expressed similar
concerns in quotes in an article on cbsnews.com. She said:


"Human vision quality is determined by the physical eye and the way the brain reads
the information that the eye captures. To think that we can reverse presbyopia or
reverse having to wear glasses for myopia and any of those different
prescriptions solely on neuroplasticity is just not accurate."


Where Is The App?


When you go to GlassesOff.com, there is a button on the top of the website which should
take you to the app on the app store. I was curious to see what the app looked like and
what the reviews were like, unfortunately, I was able to see neither. When I clicked on the
app store link, this came up.

If you can't see that, it says that the app is not currently available on the app store. The
same thing happens when you search for the app on the iPhone App Store. It would
appear that the company is having trouble with keeping the app on the app store. I
contacted the company with my concerns, and they responded very quickly, saying that
the app was still available but that it was just not showing up in the Apple App store at the
moment. This is relatively unfortunate timing, as it was reported that GlassesOff was in the
middle of a marketing campaign to increase awareness for the app. This doesn't appear to
be the first time that GlassesOff has had issues keeping the app on the app store; in
January, a comment was written on an article here on Seeking Alpha about GLSO. This
comment suggests that it was not on the app store in January.

I spoke again to someone at GlassesOff, and they said that the problem was due to them
changing developers, and that the problem would be resolved shortly. They offered kindly
to give me access to the app, which I declined, as I have near-perfect vision and the
quality of the app is not material to my opinion on the stock. As of July 2nd, the app is
back on the app store, available for download. Given that this is the second time that
GlassesOff has had issues keeping the app on the app store, it is something that one
should keep an eye on.


Bulls Misunderstand The Stock


A quick glance through Seeking Alpha shows that there are many bulls on the stock.

I believe that bulls fundamentally misunderstand the situation. They suggest that
GlassesOff will be able to capture a significant part of the eyeglass market. Zacks analyst
Jason Napodano writes,


As shown in Table 2, our revenue base case assumes peak market capture of 3.0%
(1.26 million) of these potential customers in the fourth year of sales, and mean
revenue of $120 per customer ($60 for the basic improvement program and 7.5
months of follow-on care at $8 per month). After accounting for a 30% distributor fee
and small annual price increases, this corresponds to $97million in 2016 net sales.


I believe that this is an extremely high penetration rate to assume, given some statistics.
First of all, the app is extremely expensive. At $60 for the initial download, that will be a
steep asking price for someone used to downloading free or $.99 apps. Bulls will suggest
that it is cheap compared to LASIC, but LASIC is a medical procedure which has been
tested by the FDA and is performed by doctors. Asking people to pay $60 for an app, no
matter how good it is, is like asking people at the Dollar Store to pay $60 for an item. Even
if it is worth $60, that item will not sell well. Studies have suggested that 3% of users make

up for 20% of all app spending. Likely much of that is spent on games and by younger
people. How many people over the age of 40 are willing to spend $60 on an app? I think
the answer will disappoint bulls.


This app is competing with cheap reading glasses that cost between $1-$10 at places like
CVS and Family Dollar. While the app might actually help improve vision, it will never get
any reach if the cost remains that high.


Consider this, GlassesOff only did $28k in revenues in the first quarter, even though the
app was used by over 50,000 people, according to Mr. Napodano.


The company had set a goal of 10,000 registered users; this number was selected
because it would represent a significant number of users to get feedback from, but
would most likely not overload the servers and interfere with the customer
experience. Based on larger-than-expected media coverage, the company far
surpassed the 10,000 registered-user mark, and in fact, ended up with
approximately 67,000 total registered users.


Given that he is essentially the only analyst covering the stock, he is largely driving the
expectations of investors. In his most recent article, he suggested that the app had done
exceptionally well for a "soft launch." But this was no soft launch. Just look at these press
releases:
