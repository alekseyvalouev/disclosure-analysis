Odyssey Preps Excuses For Oceanica Failure, Looks To Recycle Old
Projects, Dilute

Summary


Nov 4: OMEX placed a paid insert into a Mexican newspaper formatted deceptively
to resemble an actual article: called local Fishing Coops and journalists criminals for
opposing mining project.


Nov 5 Oceanica public consultation had over 350 protesters despite sneaky last
minute date shift; another less complex Baja mine proposal just withdrew after failing
to receive environmental approval.


Rumors circulating that OMEX about to announce “new” HMS Gloucester project
which sank slowly in only 35 feet of water, recorded eye witness accounts treasure
was removed prior to sinking.


Neptune Minerals appears to be shuttered, phones no longer active. SSCA still stuck
in court with no cash received yet. Admiral Balchen descendants state “No
evidence” of treasure aboard Victory.


Expect a bankruptcy filing or another dilutive capital raise from OMEX, shortly.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) appears to have now shifted gears into
damage control mode with its unprecedented offshore phosphate mine project, Don Diego
/ Oceanica in Mexico. In a remarkable show of desperation and disrespect for the
environmental approval process, on Nov 4th, the day before the Nov 5th public
environmental consultation, the company took out a PAID INSERT (advertisement) in the
regional Mexican newspaper Sudcaliforniano.

Photos from Nov 5th public consultation: source


We will not rehash the past opposition we have highlighted in the past by Senators, the
Mayor, and economically important fishing cooperatives. The public consultation held on
Nov 5th was a chance for the company - specially Daniel de Narváez, a founding member
of DNA, OMEX's partner in Oceanica - to present their case to the public and hear the
public's feedback. This is an important step to gather public feedback along the approval
process for SEMARNAT, the Mexican environmental regulator. Oceanica was quite sneaky
in that they originally scheduled the event for October 30th but was shifted by a week at
the last minute to coincide with a heavily popular environmental conference, Green
Solutions on Nov 5-6.

According to a local news article (translated via Google):


The meeting lasted 10 hours with over 350 people estimated present. Attendees
included leaders of the fishing coops, the Advisory Council for Sustainable
Development, local MPs, and Mayor or Comondu Venustiano Perez Sanchez. There
were 30 papers presented indicating environmental damage that would be caused
by the project. These will be considered by SEMARNAT which has 60 working days
to make a conclusion on whether to grant a permit or not.


We will neglect to go into depth here about the scientific objections raised by the
protesters but they include items such as:


· Toxic heavy metals in the sediment generated by the extraction process, including
radioactive uranium - including the plume that does not settle and would last for 50 years
in the water


· The removal of nutrients that are key to the phytoplankton base of the marine food chain


· Acoustic damage on marine mammals, including whales, from the extremely loud
dredging equipment - highlighting that the EIA did not investigate spectral content,
exposure time and temporal structure of the noise


We will continue to update shareholders as more information becomes available but we
have yet to learn of any positive support for the project from locals (excluding paid
advertisements by OMEX attempting to resemble this). At a minimum it appears much
more in depth scientific study with the corresponding expense will be needed.


Other, more conventional Baja mine throws in the towel after local opposition

For some context on how difficult the approval process is, another local mine in Baja
recently withdrew its approval process after being repeatedly blocked. The Los Cardones
gold mine would have used proven existing mining techniques in contrast to Don Diego's
unprecedented undersea phosphate mining which has never been done anywhere in the
world before commercially. In spite of this, the project was killed by local opposition. The
key reason was simply because the main economy in the area is tourism.


Where Does OMEX Go From Here? Recycle Old Projects as New?


As Odyssey stumbles towards another dilutive capital raise, rumors have been resurfacing
among investors that Odyssey may announce a new HMS Gloucester project which could
have treasure aboard. Extensive archaeological research indicates Gloucester has no

treasure on it and sank in just 35 feet of water (anyone can dive this deep with a 2 day
SCUBA course) in a well-known location with hundreds of people watching. Multiple eye
witness accounts also show the Duke took all his (and probably his entourages) valuables
with him in a giant strong box off the boat before it sank. I believe long time OMEX
investors are aware of the unviable Gloucester and if OMEX announced it, would be
poorly received sign of obvious financial desperation.


(Gloucester picture from BBC)


Lastly, in addition to independent Wessex Archaeology's report, the true family of Balchen
indicate "no evidence" of HMS Victory treasure. This is particularly telling given Balchen
family could lay legal claim to 2% of anything valuable found.


Simultaneously, it appears another Odyssey business may have also gone bankrupt. The
management page of Odyssey's "Neptune" project seems to have mysteriously vanished
recently. Phone calls to Neptune's direct number receive no answers and instead go to an
automated, generic voicemail message with no mention of Neptune or anyone at all. At
one point Odyssey management hyped this business "could" be worth over $1b.


HMS Gloucester: Odyssey's "Secret" Years of Involvement, Yet Zero
Announcements….


For anyone following Odyssey over the years, connections between Odyssey and the
alleged HMS Gloucester will not be a surprise. There have been discussion publicly from
people upset about the proposed transfer of Gloucester to Odyssey's questionable
commercial salvage partner, the "Maritime Heritage Foundation" who OMEX also appears
to be running the public relations for. It seems the obvious financially unviable nature of a
Gloucester excavation is clearly why OMEX never announced it as a project despite direct

involvement for over 4 years. It also seem this is also the reason long time OMEX
investors don't even discuss this project anymore: because it is obviously financially
worthless.


From a past UK FOIA we know


"a second group also associated with Odyssey, the still anonymous finders of
the wreck of another sovereign warship, HMS Gloucester."


This same UK FOIA based analysis goes on further to explain Sean Kingsley and his
consultancy Wreck Watch was apparently involved along with the Maritime Heritage
Foundation:


"The only common link is between the two sites is Odyssey/Wreck Watch
International and the presence at the meeting of both the MHF and the Gloucester
group plus Odyssey/Wreck Watch,"


"THE YELLOW BUOY DEBACLE"


Even worse, similar to HMS Victory, it appears OMEX's (or Augership 320's) involvement
seems to have been a direct and primary factor potentially endangering the site itself!

"The report, as might be expected, makes much of the perceived threats to the site
which encompass unstable sediment, fishing and trawling activity, and possible
unauthorized salvage attempts [from individuals alerted by OME [REDACTED]
own activities, and indeed by the bright yellow 5.5 ton marker buoy that
[REDACTED] have placed on the site.]"


Similarly, with the HMS Victory, OMEX publicizing the site by Press Conference, TV
programs and press coverage, apparently resulted in unauthorized excavation by other
commercial divers who pillaged the Victory site. What kind of legitimate archaeology or
salvage group marks any historic site with a bright yellow 5.5 ton buoy!!? This seems to
me like an example of stunning and dangerous incompetence.


The September 13 2011 e-mail continues


"OME are proposing to make further site investigations to photograph and record the
site and to produce a photomosaic. They also wish to recover "fragile surface
artifacts" (such as jugs, bottles and a pewter porringer) and commence conservation
on these. Intriguingly they also wish to carry out trial excavations and recover
(unspecified) material. Those ill-disposed to OME would undoubtedly conclude from
this report that its purpose is to steer the reader to sanctioning a recovery program-
and indeed that the proposal to excavate and recover artifacts is nothing more than
a treasure hunt. [Redacted] think it will be helpful to have DCMS/EH (English
Heritage) cast a professional eye over the report, particularly with regard to the
assessment of value and threat. Personally I am not convinced that this site is under
any more threat than others and probably less than some….


We can deduce OMEX has been aware and involved with this site for years. Tellingly, after
extensive work OMEX has never decided the project was worth publicly discussing
despite public documents demonstrating OMEX, Sean Kingsley and MHF's direct
connections with Gloucester.


HMS Gloucester: All Evidence Indicates Obviously Financially Worthless

As we have heard from OMEX's silence on the topic, HMS Gloucester is obviously
financially worthless. However, for investors that insist on spouting baseless speculations
there could be "secret treasure!" onboard Gloucester, let me explain the top 6 most
obvious reasons there is no treasure aboard Gloucester. If I need to go into more detail
later I can but this project is so obviously worthless I will start with this for now.


Some background on the wreck will help give you context. HMS Gloucester was launched
in 1654 and sank with 60 guns on her the morning of 5/6/1682 while traveling back to Lief,
UK with exiled King James 2 (ie: Duke of York), and some of his entourage, from exile in
Scotland. Gloucester was a third rate speaker class frigate and so was just 35 feet wide,
117 feet long and ~14 feet deep, yet had 330 passengers and 60 large cannons aboard
when she sank. Gloucester ran aground in good weather due to pilot negligence on the
well-known "notorious Lemon and Oar" shoal off Great Yarmouth, not far from the Port of
Lowestof.


(picture credit wrecksite.eu)


Moving on to why HMS Gloucester project is financially worthless and OMEX chose
to never announce it:


1. First, multiple accounts from eye witnesses quote only 5k of total value sank with
HMS Gloucester. This makes sense also because the royalty were likely first to be saved
and the Duke took his enormous strong box off the boat with him and his close entourage

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2665175-odyssey-preps-excuses-for-oceanica-failure-looks-to-recycle-old-projects-dilute 9/45


(from "The Plot Against Pepys")


(from "Christopher Gunman and the Wreck of the Gloucester")


If we optimistically assume that 70% of this 5k value was in pure, recoverable gold or
silver and if we are again wildly optimistic and assume OMEX can find 80% of what went
down with the boat, then give 20% to the UK government, another 20% to whoever the
dealer or retailer is, I estimate this "best case scenario" only leaves ~$6.5m of total
revenue to any commercial treasure hunting company the UK government may choose to
give this to. This is obliviously a tiny fraction of the cost to execute any project, let alone
one with endless tons of sand that would have to be removed over a huge area. Even
using wildly optimistic estimates, there is zero chance this recovery could ever be even
vaguely close to profitable.


2. Second, multiple eye witness accounts saw Duke force his entourage to lower his
giant strong box into his boat when he left the Gloucester. This strong box weight
perhaps as much as 80 men and there are extensive accounts of the timeline and actions
of King James which describe exactly what happened, they all show any treasure the
Duke of York and his entourage may have had with him clearly left the boat when it sank.


Eye witness accounts as 150 passengers died in the water:


"Still the Duke dithered. He fussed over the safety of his strongbox, his priests and his
pugs (Dogs)."


and (from different source):


"The longboat went off with very few in her, though she might have carried off above
eighty more than she did" "it is very certain he was much too anxious to preserve his
strongbox" "upon which the Duke ordered a strong box lifted into the boat, which
beside being very weighty, took up much room and time. My father asked with
some warmth, if there was anything worth a man's life. The duke answered that
there were things of great consequence, both to the king and himself, that he would
hazard his own rather than it should be lost."

And so the safety boat left almost empty of people, which could have carried 80+ more
men, while the Duke ordered people on the board to fend everyone off with swords. While
the rescue boat was clearly lowered past the Duke's cabin so he could get his entourage
and their heavy valuables and strongboxes onto the life boat.


So, from multiple different sources, we know the Duke had his enormous strong box,
weight approximately the same as 80 men, lowered into the boat, while his entourage
joined him. Obviously this was whatever wealth he had on him, as well as that of his
entourage, and we know that it left the boat before it sank. There is no treasure aboard
Gloucester.


3. Third, Gloucester sank in just 35 feet of water in a "notorious" area that was well
known then and now. Gloucester was not a boat that sank in the middle of the ocean at
night in deep water. She sank in broad daylight, in good weather, as part of a flotilla of
many ships among hundreds of people. Everyone knew exactly where she sank, but don't
take my word for it though, read the accounts of people who were actually there:


"an hour after sketchy news of the wreck arrived in Whitehall on Wednesday 10 may, all
London knew the story"


Or just look at the pictures from eye witness accounts below. Note the number of ships
around Gloucester as she sank and the hundreds of people watching. Note the extremely
shallow waters and relative ease of access to the wreck site any modern company would
have.

Remember Gloucester sank with 60 cannons aboard. Any salvage company with interest
could have chartered a boat with basic imaging equipment and found her years ago if
there was any reason to do so. The 35-60 feet she sank in is a depth many people could

do with a snorkel mask from Walmart. While any claims of recreational diving off the coast
in the North Sea sand bars is obviously absurd, anyone with a 2 day PADI SCUBA class
could easily dive to these depths any weekend. To think a "gazillion" dollars of treasure
lays in shallow water in a well known location that anyone with a 2 day PADI SCUBA class
could go and get is so absurd I can't believe anyone would suggest it with a straight face.
Remember the hundreds of companies in the North Sea area working on deep see oil and
gas, each with vastly superior skills for deep water recovery than OMEX will ever hope to
have. To think any one of them never cared to go and dig up some vast fortune laying in
shallow water in their own backyard is ridiculous.


If there was treasure aboard this ship, someone else would have gone and recovered it
decades ago given the ease of the access and obvious location.


4. Fourth, there are no credible historic accounts stating there was treasure aboard
Gloucester. You have to remember how historic the Gloucester was to understand why
this is critical to any claims of treasure. The initial sinking of the Gloucester was
surrounded by conspiracy theories of attempted assasination of the Duke of York and
people were court martialed, jailed, prosecuted. Hundreds of people watched her sink and
this scandal was discussed by the world for many years. There are an unusually detailed
level of records surrounding this boat from court documents and countless letters and
journal entries of the people involved. Not only are there no records of a massive treasure
which sank in the boat, but Duke of York jumped to the support of Christopher Gunman
when he was court martialed, and later the one year of pay he was docked was remited in
entirety. This is not the action of someone who just lost their family's fortune on a shallow
sand bar in good weather.


There is no credible evidence indicating any treasure was aboard Gloucester.


5. Fifth, anyone counting on passenger valuables should know there were other
larger boats with royal members aboard and not on Gloucester. Gloucester's flotilla
had many boats (chapter 23) in their flotilla from the "Mary" including six frigates:
Gloucester, Happy Return, The Lark, the Ruby, the Dartmough, and the Pearl. Then three
more yachts including Katherine, the Charlotte and the Kitchen. When they departed, the
Duke and his close entourage boarded the Gloucester but the rest of his party and all their
luggage on the other frigates from Pepys to many others. It is absurd to assume that, even
if there was some treasure in the flotilla, that it was on the crowded Gloucester. Or if you
are speculating on passenger gold know that royalty would have been saved with priority
and many of them weren't on Gloucester to begin with. Of the Gloucester's 330
passengers, 250 of them were normal seamen and passengers, with only 80 of the

remaining nobles and servants of them. That means there were only perhaps 30
nobleman on Gloucester and nearly all of them left the ship with the Duke. There is no
vast trove of royal passenger treasure.


Furthermore, if there were some astonishing amounts of gold sinking with Gloucester I
think it is obvious some sailors may have chosen to get closer to her and recover some of
this "amazing" treasure some claim was on there. It is telling that instead most of the
boats stayed at quite some distance with the closest, The Mary, staying a full ¼ to 1/3 mile
away as Gloucester sank. Eye witnesses claim that when she finally sank, Gloucester
"opened up like a basket" and yet none of the people surrouning her saw any evidence at
all of the vast fortunes inside? What of the 150+ people who were rescued, none of them
had anything to say about the supposed vast sums of silver and gold left on the boat?


6. Sixth, any scraps of passenger belongings on the boat have been swept around
for hundreds of years by thousands of violent storms and mixed with millions of
tons of sand this region is known for. This shole region was so famous for the shifting
sand banks there was a ship ahead of Gloucester helping her navigate the area at the
time she ran aground. Giant shifting sand bars are what this area is famous for and any
valuables that sank on this boat have been mixed into millions of tons of sand over the
past 332 years and are now unrecoverable in any financially viable way.


HMS Gloucester: Potentially A Desperate "Emergency" Project?


Given obviously worthless, not to mention potentially dangerous to archaeological value of
the site, I speculate OMEX has kept this project quiet and would only ever consider

(picture by me, note there is nothing inside….)


Every long term OMEX follower knows of this Gloucester project and they all ascribe zero
value to it. Those who don't know, have obviously not completed even the most basic due
diligence as public evidence of these connections is easily found in 5 minutes of Google
searching.


This email, made public through FOIA request, is the initial reference about this
connection:


"Not only that, a second group also associated with Odyssey, the still
anonymous finders of the wreck of another sovereign warship, HMS Gloucester, lost
of Great Yarmouth in 1682."

I could expand on this curious connections and various questionable dealings behind the
scenes with HMS Gloucester, financings, the UK government and Sean Kingsley. Instead I
want to offer Marc Gordon and Odyssey this opportunity to explain what is going on
behind the scenes themselves as shareholders deserve the full truth from the source.


Has Odyssey's "Neptune Minerals" Finally Ceased Operations and Gone Bankrupt?


Odyssey previously claimed Neptune minerals was worth over a billion dollars at a Noble
Investor Conference. Now however, Neptune "leadership" page has curiously vanished
with no listed management following their last failed capital raise. Even more alarming,
when I call the listed phone number on the website (727) 897-5541 I find that nobody
answers and after many rings it eventually goes to generic "leave a message at the tone.
Beep." automated voicemail with zero mention of Neptune, no employee name, or any
name at all. Does this sound to you like a company currently in operation, theoretically
worth a billion dollars? The names used to be there a few months ago.


(from Neptune Website 11/8/2014)


Has this business finally gone down in flames permanently? Has their insolvency finally
caused them to cease operations entirely and fire all employees? When will OMEX
management give shareholders an update on this project? If Neptune is finally bankrupt,
why hasn't OMEX shared this development with their shareholders? Now with essentially
every single deep sea mining company and project a financial disaster, how much longer
will OMEX waste precious shareholder capital on this pipe dream?

HMS Victory Debacle: Further Evidence Supports "no treasure" Onboard


As the farcical HMS Victory debacle continues unraveling, multiple research sources
indicate no secret treasure aboard the ship. In addition to Wessex Archaeology analysis,
the meticulous research from the actual family members of HMS Victory Captain (who
could lay legal claim to 2% of any find) also finds "no evidence" of treasure on board HMS
Victory:


"However our researches into the meticulous Royal Navy records of the period, have
shown no such evidence. Nor do our extensive family records, which date far
beyond 1744, make any such assertion. Given that the sums speculated at were
vast and in which Admiral Balchen, would have been entitled to a 2% commission,
for landing the bullion safely, we think there would be some family or Royal Navy
record of this."


Even if there is treasure aboard HMS Victory, it seems OMEX may hit political and legal
road blocks which prevent them from moving forward. The Victory seems to be rapidly
building into an embarrassing international scandal being discussed around the world as
the UK government is trying to sell the rights to a national war grave so foreign
commercial salvors can go rummaging through graves for trinkets to sell. The amount of
mounting unanswered questions could fill another article (and may) but to start I think this
article and this ask critical questions that, confusingly, remain unanswered.


Furthermore, there are sure to be lots of human remains from the many soldiers dead on
this site that OMEX will theoretically rummage through. The ship sank quickly so
presumably lots of men died below the deck and were crushed to death by the cannons.
As a result any recovery of the cannons seems sure to result in rummaging through the
dead body parts of UK soldiers. Odyssey already publicly uncovered remains of dead UK
soldiers on their TV show "treasure quest" and it seems the UK government is not going to
require any independent observer from English Heritage or non-profit archaeological
society to ensure the archaeology side is done in compliance. If Odyssey is a credible
archaeology firm looking to preserve a countries artifacts, where are the detailed reports
and painstaking site analysis from the Spanish Mercedes ship?


Lastly, the entire case behind excavating the HMS Victory seems absurd to me. To claim
an English Warship was carrying some multibillion dollar treasure that is not discussed in
any formal, reputable historic records seems like quite a stretch. But claiming Victory was
carrying money for Dutch merchants based in Lisbon, when the Victory was heading to
the UK is crazy. Any Dutch merchant money claimed to be on Victory would have been

destined for Amsterdam and archaeology experts have told me there were other Dutch
flagged vessels sailing in the same convoy with their ultimate destination of Amsterdam. If
this is true, why on earth would anyone store some massive sum of money on HMS
Victory? The risks, logistics and cost of it make this obviously ridiculous and so the entire
case behind speculative claims of HMS Victory treasure make no sense to me.


These obvious discrepancies and issues are likely why the global pre-eminent expert on
this topic, Nicholas Rodger from Exeter stated it is essentially beyond unlikely there is
some enormous treasure on HMS Victory.


Conclusion: OMEX Stumbling Onward Towards Dilutive Capital Raise


As OMEX slogs onward, ever closer towards another capital raise, I believe it would be
wise for investors considering "possible" Gloucester treasure, or some other ship ("firefly",
SS Republic recycling, etc), to keep the following chart (from my first report) of Odyssey's
past projects in mind.


Go through Odyssey's past 17 consecutive years of failure and you will find nearly -$200m
of shareholder losses, as literally 100% of OMEX's projects have been investor
disappointments with a startling 89.2% of their projects total wipeouts generating $0.000
of revenue (let alone profit[a5] ).

Over 16+ years now, I believe Odyssey has demonstrated a consistent pattern, resulting
in nearly -$200m of losses and constant failure: First a project is announced and then
(curiously) theoretically unrelated media sources spout off absurdly promotional and

unsubstantiated estimates of treasure value. These "estimates" are based on tenuous
connections of "hidden" treasure not well recorded in historic documents due to some
absurd reason. OMEX then sells equity to pay for the project (and management's high-
roller lifestyle). If the project is ever excavated at all, it turns out that these initial estimates
were wildly incorrect and total recovered items are worth a tiny fraction of what was
previously proposed, resulting in losses and cash burn. Wash, Rinse, and Repeat as long
as investors are willing to continuously lose their money and be diluted.


There is a reason why there have been seven other publicly traded underwater salvage
companies like Odyssey, all have gone to $0.


Underwater treasure hunting and exploration is literally "world's worst investment" where
even the "successful" projects lose millions of dollars and wipe investors out completely.
This is why Marc Gordon has publicly announced OMEX will depart from Greg Stemm's
past "impossible long shot" projects, as Greg Stemm's business model has subjected
shareholders to financial apocalypse.


Until OMEX proves they can operate a business model capable of generating consistent
cash flow, I urge investors to beware of an imminent attempted capital raise via PIPE or
convertible note. They appear ready to waste more shareholder money going back to the
SS Central America to take even more images - are there truly no new projects for the
company? Shareholder have been hearing about a "deep pipeline" of approved projects
for years and yet it seems to be the same re-hashed over and over.


Questions for Today's Conference Call:


1. How much will be paid to Greg Stemm as part of his "retirement" bonus?


2. How much equity will you be forced to issue over the next 12 months?


3. What is the current status of your much touted, "commodity shipwreck program" which
we triangulated as likely Nazi German WWII cargo which would be highly difficult to
contract upon?

4. if Gloucester is such an attractive project why have you never announced your
involvement with it over the past 4 years? Why would you even spend any shareholder
time and money working on this obviously financially worthless project?


5. Why have you been unable to bring in a strategic partner with Oceanica over the past
18 months?


6. When will Odyssey provide the Amsterdamische Courant newspaper report original,
and the translation that they have been using for their reports?


7. Does Odyssey interpret the recent approval for the Victory as to allow for the sale of the
artifacts?


8. For the Central America, what is the progress on the Admiralty Arrest appeals. When
do you expect to be able to receive any cash from this project that isn't debt?


9. Have Odyssey define the way they will be paid for the Central America recovery. ie
when the recovery is monetized, will they recoup at 80/20 costs and 45% directly, before
other costs, claims and percentages. or will they receive the 80/20 costs, and the 45% will
paid out of the pool of all of the other costs, claims, and percentages?


10. When does the 60-90 day response time for SEMARNAT begin? Was it SEP 3, when
resubmitted on the SEP 18, or when sent for evaluacion on OCT 30 - or is it Nov 5th when
the public consultation was held?


11. The Technical Report: Revised Assessment referenced in the Oceanica press release
"concludes the measured and indicated phosphorite resources at the Oceanica deposit
now total 327.2 million ore tonnes at 18.5% P O , an increase of 20% over the last
preliminary assessment total of 273.5 million ore tonnes." How many tonnes of material is
estimated needed to be dredged to create the 327M tonnes of concentrate?


12. Of the "327.2 million ore tonnes at 18.5% P O , " referenced, what are the
steps/processes required to make the "phosphate rock concentrate at 28% to 30% P O
with a favorable CaO/P O  ratio of 1.5 to 1.55 and a Minor Element Ratio (MER) of 0.07 to
0.08. " referenced?


13. The same question for the "chemical analysis suggests that the concentrate would be
suitable for the production of phosphoric acid using the wet process methods." referenced.

In an obvious attempt to deceive the public, this paid advertisement was constructed
attempting to make it look like an actual journalist's article interviewing an attorney who is
working for Oceanica. To be absolutely clear this is in fact a paid insert: the "article"
cannot be found on the newspaper's website, there is no journalist listed as the interviewer
or author, the fonts are clearly different than the regular articles, and another local news
source also says it was a paid insert. We called the newspaper who confirmed it was
indeed a paid insert and that it would cost 16k pesos to put one like it in the paper (or 8k
for black and white only).


In OMEX's deceptive advertisement, their attorney was compensated to state that there
was a criminal conspiracy involving the Puerto Chale fishing co-op, which is a major
contributor to the economy in the Baja area, as well as journalists who have covered
Puerto Chale's opposition materials and congregations. The purpose of the insert appears
to be to undermine the environmental permitting process and discredit the key opposition
the day before the public consultation while simultaneously laying the groundwork for
