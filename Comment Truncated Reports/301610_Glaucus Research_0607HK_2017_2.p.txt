“Any man can make a mistake, but only an idiot persists in his error” -  Cicero 





1 
 




















On April 25, 2017, Glaucus published our investment opinion (the “Report”) on Fullshare Holdings Ltd. (HK: 0607) 


(“Fullshare” or the “Company”), a 2013 reverse merger, which we believe is one of the largest stock manipulation 


schemes trading on any exchange anywhere in the world.  On May 2, Fullshare issued a Clarification Announcement 


(the “Response”). 





Fullshare’s Response is totally inadequate and fails to present any meaningful rebuttal to the black and white intraday 


trading data indicating that its stock is manipulated in the final hour of trading.  Such manipulation is a blight on the 


Hong Kong stock exchange and undermines the integrity of the financial markets.  It is also self-defeating, as anything 


which rises due to manipulation must inevitably crash.   





We continue to believe that the Fullshare’s stock is manipulated and that its chairman and his family have engaged in 


a number of undisclosed related party transactions with the Company.  As a result, we continue to value Fullshare, 


after a 20% corruption discount, at HKD 0.55 per share (on an adjusted multiple of price to recurring earnings) or 


HKD 0.77 (on an adjusted P/B multiple).  We also believe that it is reasonable to expect even further downside pressure 


on the Company’s shares. 





1) Intraday Trading Patterns Indicate Stock Manipulation 
 


In our Report, we presented independent intraday trading data which suggests that the inexplicable appreciation of 


Fullshare’s stock price is due to unusual gains posted in the final hour of trading.  If an investor bought and held 


Fullshare’s stock from November 14, 2016, through April 21, 2017, it would have generated a loss of -34%.  But if 


an investor bought Fullshare’s stock at the beginning of the last trading hour and sold at the close of the trading day 


(and reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Fullshare’s stock would have returned an 


inexplicable 76% over that same period!  The difference between the returns in trading Fullshare’s stock with a 


last-hour trading strategy and a buy-and-hold strategy was 110% over this period.  This staggering difference is highly 


unusual when compared to other Hong Kong stocks, and in our opinion, strong evidence of manipulation. 





Fullshare’s only response to this damning evidence was to argue that we cherry-picked the period for our analysis by 


including trading data from the days around the issuance of a large amount of Fullshare’s stock in connection with the 


Company’s November 30, 2016, acquisition of China High Speed Transmission Equipment Group Co. Ltd. (HK: 


0658) (“CHS”).  Fullshare complained in its Response that because it issued shares at a discount to the market price, 


the trading data around the time of the issuance distorted our analysis. 





But this is nonsense.  Even if we exclude the period around Fullshare’s issuance of stock to purchase CHS, the intraday 


trading data still shows strong evidence of manipulation.   





Bloomberg maintains intraday trading data for Hong Kong securities for the past 140 trading days.  Evidence of 


manipulation can be found in intraday trading patterns, particularly the appreciation of a company’s stock in the last 


hour of trading.  Gains throughout the trading day, over time, should be uniform.  Yet market commentators such as 


the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have pointed out that other Hong Kong stocks which were likely stock

manipulations, such as Hanergy and Tech Pro (which Glaucus exposed in a report published July 2016), posted 


unusual gains in the last hour or minutes of the trading day.  





In order to exclude the effects of the CHS transaction, we compared the returns generated from two different trading 


strategies over the period from December 5, 2016, through April 24, 2017.1  First, we calculated the returns if an 


investor simply purchased the shares on day 1 of the period and sold them at the end of the period.  We refer to this 


as the buy-and-hold strategy.   





We compared this to the returns of a last-hour trading strategy.  With the last-hour trading strategy, we modeled 


the compounded returns if, each day, an investor bought the subject stock at 3:00 pm (Hong Kong time), sold the 


stock an hour later at the close of the market, and then reinvested the proceeds in the same manner the following day.    





As is evident in the table below, for Hong Kong’s top 15 traded stocks (measured by highest average dollars traded 


over the last six months), there is little difference in an investor’s returns between a buy-and-hold strategy versus a 


last-hour trading strategy in this same period.  From December 5, 2016 through April 24, 2017, the median return 


for an investor who bought and held Hong Kong’s most actively traded stocks was 5.4%.  A last-hour trading strategy 


for those same stocks would have generated a median return of 5.0%.

Note: Trading Data for the Period from Dec. 5, 2016, through April 24, 2017. 





For the top 15 stocks trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by dollar volume, there was little difference in the 


median returns over this period between a buy-and-hold strategy and a last-hour trading strategy.  This is what we 


would expect for non-manipulated stocks.   





But the results were much different for Fullshare.  Over the same period, a buy-and-hold strategy of Fullshare’s stock 


would have resulted in a loss of -20%!  By comparison, a compounded last-hour trading strategy for Fullshare 


generated returns of 59%! The difference between the returns for a last-hour trading strategy and a buy-and-hold 


strategy was a staggering 79%.  In our opinion, this is black and white evidence of manipulation.   








                                                         
1 According to Fullshare’s FY 2016 annual results announcement, the share exchange with CHS was completed on November 30, 


2016.  Fullshare’s stock experienced increased trading volume (900+ million shares traded) in the three days following that 
issuance.  We use December 5, 2016, as the date to start our revised analysis because trading volumes returned to more normalized 


levels on that day.

Intraday trading data for the top 30 traded HSCIPC stocks3 show that in the majority of cases, the returns from a last-


hour trading strategy do not significantly exceed the returns from a buy-and-hold strategy during the revised period.  


Indeed, the median difference was -7.1%, indicating that in the majority of examples, investors were worse off if they 


traded only the last hour of each trading day.  Yet for Fullshare, a last-hour trading strategy generated 79% 


greater returns compared to simply buying and holding over the same period.   





The data is crystal clear.  Even if we omit the trading days around Fullshare’s issuance of new shares to acquire CHS, 


Fullshare’s share price appreciation in the last hour of trading suggests Fullshare’s stock is being manipulated.  





a. Manipulation of Zall’s Stock Artificially Inflates Fullshare’s Reported Income 
 


In our Report, we presented independent intraday trading data which suggested that the inexplicable appreciation of 


Zall’s stock price was also due to unusual gains posted in the final hour of trading.   





Fullshare meekly claims in its Response that it was not responsible for manipulating Zall’s shares.  But this is 


irrelevant, because the benefits to Fullshare were enormous.   





An analysis of the intraday trading pattern of Zall’s stock shows strong evidence of manipulation.  If an investor 


bought and held Zall’s stock from December 5, 2016 through April 24, 2017, it would have generated a loss of -4%.  


But if the same investor bought Zall’s shares at the start of the last hour and sold at the close of the trading day (and 


reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Zall’s stock would have returned a staggering 42% over 


that same period.

Such an unusual pattern of stock price appreciation in the final hour of trading not only suggests that Zall’s stock is 


being manipulated, but that the appreciation of Zall’s stock artificially inflates Fullshare’s reported income.  Fullshare 


is a primary beneficiary of Zall’s manipulated stock. The significant cross-holdings between Fullshare and Zall allow 


each company to generate massive non-cash gains, and since such gains are a significant portion of each company’s

that each company’s respective profits and stock prices would plummet.

that both stocks are being manipulated in the final hour of trading.   





In our opinion, such manipulation is a blight on the stock exchange and undermines the integrity of the financial 


markets.  It is also self-defeating, as anything which rises due to manipulation must inevitably crash.

2) Valuation 
 


Fullshare also attempts to engage in misleading sleight of hand with respect to its absurd valuation.  In our Report, we 


pointed out that although Fullshare is supposedly a commercial and residential property developer, this business is 


tiny compared to its market capitalization.  In FY 2016, Fullshare generated a paltry RMB 132 million in EBIT from 


continuing operations, meaning it currently trades at 431x recurring operating profits.5  This is obviously a ludicrous 


valuation and supports our argument that Fullshare’s stock has nowhere to go but down.  Even if we ignore all evidence 


of corruption or embezzlement, Fullshare’s operating business is so insignificant that if we value Fullshare at the 


median multiple for HSCIPC companies (either on an adjusted P/E or adjusted P/B ratio), we would expect Fullshare’s 


stock price to decrease by 70-80%.   





Fullshare offers a number of arguments to justify its valuation, but these only demonstrate Fullshare’s desperation to 


prop up its stock price and its amateurish understanding of financial analysis.   





a. P/E Ratio 
 


First, Fullshare attempts to claim that its price-to-earnings ratio is only 13x, and thus the Company is not overvalued.  


Obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but only a financial illiterate would think this is a good argument. 


Professional investors and financial analysts do not typically give credit for non-recurring, non-cash, one-time gains, 


especially if they occur outside of the core business.  If we adjust Fullshare’s income statement to remove such gains, 


the Company’s earnings from its continuing operations was only RMB 303 million in FY 2016, not RMB 3.1 billion 


as Fullshare claims in its Response.  Meaning that Fullshare currently trades at a ludicrous 160.4x trailing TTM 


earnings from continuing operations!  





                                                         
5 All ratios and percentages in this section are calculated using the closing price of Fullshare’s stock on Friday April 21, 2017.

Source: Company Filings, Bloomberg, Glaucus Calculation 


Note: 1. Fullshare issued more than 3.5 billion shares in the last quarter of 2016. These dilutive issuances 


are included in our EPS calculation.   


2. 2016 Average Exchange Rate: RMB 1 = HK$ 1.17 





The vast majority of such non-cash, one-time gains are from the appreciation of Zall’s stock price.  In FY 2016, gains 


from the appreciation of Zall’s stock accounted for a staggering 108% of Fullshare’s net income.  Not only should 


such gains typically be eliminated when valuing a publicly listed company, but in this case, given the evidence that 


they are derived from manipulation, such one-time, non-recurring, non-cash gains should certainly be ignored.   


Perhaps if Fullshare had any sell-side analyst coverage, they would realize how to properly calculate their price-to-


earnings ratio.   


b. Ignoring the Takeover of CHS 
 


Fullshare also accuses us of ignoring its investment in CHS, but this is completely false.  Fullshare acquired 74% of 


Hong Kong listed CHS in December 2016, meaning that going forward, CHS and its subsidiaries will be fully 


consolidated into Fullshare’s financial statements.   





In our valuation, we gave full credit to Fullshare’s 74% investment in CHS.  The problem for Fullshare is that CHS’s 


current market capitalization only adds HKD 0.47 per share to Fullshare’s value.  Accordingly, even including the 


value of CHS, if Fullshare traded at the median multiple of earnings for other HSCIPC companies, Fullshare’s stock 


would be worth only HKD 0.68 per share, implying an 76% downside in the Company’s stock.6  





  
Source: Company Filings, Bloomberg, Glaucus Calculation 


*2016 Average Exchange Rate: RMB 1 = HK$ 1.17 





It is a major red flag that Fullshare, with a market capitalization of HKD 56.4 billion, is trying to justify its valuation 


by pointing to its 74% stake in a much smaller business like CHS (which has a market capitalization of only HKD 


12.6 billion).  Fullshare’s investment in CHS is only worth HKD 0.47 per share and does not even come close to 


justifying Fullshare’s ludicrous share price.   


Any reasonable investor looking to invest in CHS will purchase CHS’s shares, and not some wildly overvalued 


conglomerate like Fullshare which fails to generate meaningful cash flows from any operating business. 


                                                         
6 Glaucus calculations are based on the price of Fullshare’s stock at the close of trading on Friday April 21, 2017, of HKD 2.88 


per share.

Fullshare Holdings Ltd. │ HK: 0607                         www.glaucusresearch.com 


c. Diversification: What Diversification? 
 


Fullshare’s final argument to justify its valuation is also amateurish.  Fullshare claims that it is a “generally accepted 


market principle that a fast-growth company enjoys a high P/E ratio… The fact is that the Company has achieved 


rapid and impressive growth with diversified businesses after the reverse takeover completed in December 2013.”7  


Fullshare then tries to show its growth by pointing to the increase in its market capitalization!  





But this is exactly our point.  Fullshare pretends to be a high growth business, but the only thing which has 


meaningfully grown since the reverse merger is its market capitalization, and this, in our opinion, is due to market 


manipulation.  Fullshare has also acquired assets (usually by issuing its inflated stock), but such assets have failed 


thus far to generate meaningful cash flows.   





Since the reverse merger, Fullshare’s market capitalization has grown at a 541% CAGR from HKD 287 million to a 


high of HKD 76 billion in 3 years!  Despite a 264x increase in market capitalization since the reverse merger, 


Fullshare’s cash flows from its recurring operations (before working capital adjustments) has increased only 


28%!8  Fullshare’s financials show exactly the opposite of what the Company claims – that in reality, its underlying 


business has not really grown at all.   





Fullshare claims expertise in other business areas, but if so, what are they? We calculate that 108% of Fullshare’s net 


income came from its investment in Zall, meaning that its other businesses are immaterial to the Company’s bottom 


line.  Fullshare’s annual report is littered with throwaway lines about its healthcare and its tourism business but if 


Fullshare was good at any other businesses, its cash flow statement would show it.  But it doesn’t, because they are 


not.   





Accordingly, including the full value of CHS, if Fullshare traded at the median multiple of earnings for other HSCIPC 


companies, Fullshare’s stock would be worth only HKD 0.68 per share, implying an 76% downside in the Company’s 


stock. Measured on a price to book ratio, Fullshare’s shares appear similarly overvalued.  We calculate that on an 


adjusted P/B basis (again giving full credit for its investment in CHS), if Fullshare simply traded at the HSCIPC P/B 


median, it would be valued at HKD 0.97 per share, a 66% downside from its current price.9   





But of course, we think that Fullshare should trade far below an index median, given the evidence presented in our 


Report of ubiquitous undisclosed related party dealings and the unusual intraday trading pattern of its stock.  Applying 


a 20% corruption discount yields a Glaucus valuation of HKD 0.55 per share (on an adjusted P/E multiple) or HKD 


0.77 (on an adjusted P/B multiple).

Note: Both valuation methodologies give full credit to Fullshare’s interest in CHS.

3) Secret Dispositions of Valuable Assets to Undisclosed Related Parties 
 


In our Report, we presented five instances in which evidence indicates that Fullshare has sold assets or subsidiaries to 


entities which we believe are secretly owned by or connected to the chairman or his family.  Fullshare’s Response 


contains blanket denials of any undisclosed related party transactions, but fails to provide any meaningful details or 


explanations to explain the voluminous undisclosed connections between Fullshare and its counterparties.   





a. Highest Profit-Margin Subsidiary Secretly Sold to Chairman’s Brothers 
 


In June 2016, Fullshare sold Fullshare Green Building and its subsidiaries (together, the “Green Energy Group”) to a 


supposedly independent third party, Jiasheng Construction Group Co Ltd (“JCC”), for a total consideration of RMB 


240 million.  Fullshare said that JCC was an independent third party.  In our Report, we highlighted SAIC filings 


which reveal that Fullshare’s chairman’s brothers owned 29% of JCC at the time and evidence that Fullshare sold the 


Green Energy Group at a massively discounted price.  Rather than being an independent third party, we believe that 


JCC is actually an undisclosed related party.   


In its Response, Fullshare claims that JCC was not a connected party because the chairman’s brothers owned less than 


30% of JCC at the time of the transaction.  But this ignores the many other overlapping connections between Fullshare 


and JCC that we highlighted in our Report. JCC has deep historical ties to Fullshare’s chairman and his family.  


Fullshare’s chairman and his two brothers, Ji Changbin and Ji Changrong, were employees of JCC as far back as 1999.  


The chairman was a shareholder of JCC as far back as 2003.10  As of June 30, 2016, Fullshare Private even guaranteed 


RMB 450 million of JCC’s loan from two Chinese banks.  Yet Fullshare never disclosed any such connections to 


shareholders.  


Fullshare’s response is all form over substance.  The Company claims that simply because the chairman’s brothers 


owned less than 30% of JCC at the time of sale (SAIC records indicate they owned 29.2%), that the market should 


not be suspicious of the transaction.  Of course, this may be different if the Company had disclosed that the chairman’s 


brothers were shareholders of JCC, or disclosed any of the voluminous connections between JCC and the Company.  


But Fullshare only admitted to these details after Glaucus exposed them, and is now trying to hide behind 


technicalities in the hopes that shareholders will ignore the obvious evidence indicating that this was an undisclosed 


related party disposition.   


Second, Fullshare claims that Fullshare Green Building was not the only material subsidiary in its highest-margin 


segment.  But this contradicts the Company’s previous disclosures.  In the Company’s FY 2015 annual report, 


Fullshare disclosed that Fullshare Green Building, also known as Fullshare Lujian, was the only material subsidiary 


involved in its Green Building Service segment.  Although Fullshare admitted that seven other subsidiaries were 


involved in this segment, it stated in black and white that the other subsidiaries were immaterial.  Fullshare is only 


trying to change its story now because it realizes it has been caught.   





                                                         
10 He later disposed of his shares of JCC.

As any investor can see from the excerpts above, Fullshare stated in no uncertain terms in its FY 2015 annual report 


that Fullshare Green Building (also known as Fullshare Lujian) was the only material subsidiary in the Green Building 


Services segment, its highest-profit margin segment that year.  Now, it is frantically trying to distance itself from this 


statement after we pointed out that Fullshare Green Building appears to have been sold to an undisclosed related party.   


Finally, Fullshare never addressed any of the evidence presented in our Report which showed that the Green 


Energy Group was sold to JCC at a substantial discount to its market value.   


In 2014, prior to its acquisition by Fullshare for RMB 228 million, the Green Energy Group lost RMB 11 million.  A 


year later, the Green Energy Group generated RMB 40.8 million in profits but was sold by Fullshare for only RMB 


240 million.

Fullshare essentially sold the Green Energy Group for the same consideration for which Fullshare acquired it, despite 


the fact that the Green Energy Group had transformed from a money-losing operation to a significantly profitable 


segment.  


In our Report, we also highlighted the publicly available SAIC filings for Fullshare Green Building (the primary 


subsidiary in the Green Energy Group), which confirmed that it was worth substantially more when it was sold to 


Fullshare’s chairman’s brothers than when it was acquired by the Company.  SAIC filings showed that compared to 


the year before, in 2015, Fullshare Green Building’s revenues increased 9.4x! Profits increased a staggering 89.1x 


in the year before it was sold, suggesting Fullshare Green Building was worth substantially more at the time it was 


sold to the chairman’s brothers than it was when the Company acquired it.  





In its Response, Fullshare simply stated that the consideration at the disposal of Fullshare was determined by the net 


asset value of Fullshare Green Building and its declared dividend.  Fullshare’s Response is simply nonsense.  The 


Company wants investors to believe that if an entity’s profits increase by 89.1x, its value does not increase.  Anyone 


foolish enough to believe that is welcome to invest in Fullshare.   


b. Property Development Subsidiaries Likewise Sold to Undisclosed Related Parties 
 


On November 27, 2015, Fullshare sold 100% of the equity of two property development subsidiaries, Jurong 


Dingsheng Property Development Company Limited (“Jurong Dingsheng”) and Jurong Dasheng Property 


Development Company Limited (“Jurong Dasheng”) (collectively, the “Jurong Twins”), to Nanjing Dongzhou 


Property Development Limited (“Nanjing Dongzhou”) for RMB 524 million.  Fullshare claimed that the buyer was 


an independent third party.  


In our Report, we highlighted that prior to the transaction, the parent companies of this supposedly independent third 


party buyer received a number of substantial loans from entities connected to Fullshare’s chairman.   


First, SAIC filings reveal that in August 2015, a few months before the transaction, Nanjing Dongzhou’s sole 


shareholder at the time, Nanjng Yuanqing, pledged 100% of Nanjing Dongzhou’s equity to Nanjing Jiasheng Property 


Development (“JPD”), an entity owned in part by Fullshare’s chairman, for a loan of RMB 152.6 million.   


In its Response, Fullshare claims that its chairman was only a 7.97% shareholder of JPD and was not a director or 


senior manager of JPD and that therefore, he did not control JPD.  Fullshare also claims that the loan was unrelated 


and irrelevant to the subject transaction.   


Fullshare is basically insisting that it is simply a coincidence that JPD, of which its chairman was a shareholder, loaned 


RMB 152.6 million to Nanjing Dongzhou’s parent company mere months before Nanjing Dongzhou purchased the 


Jurong Twins from the Company.  But in our opinion, the timing of the loan is too close to be a coincidence.   


Second, On November 23, 2015, just four days before the completion of the transaction, an entity called Nanjing 


Chuang Su Investment (“Nanjing Sue”) acquired Nanjing Yuanqing, the parent company of the buyer, Nanjing 


Dongzhou.

Fullshare Holdings Ltd. │ HK: 0607                         www.glaucusresearch.com 


In our Report, we opined that Nanjing Sue is an undisclosed related party, connected to and likely controlled by 


Fullshare’s chairman.  First, SAIC filings reveal that as of June 2013, Nanjing Sue rented office space from the 


chairman’s Fullshare Private for RMB 50,000 per year.  The lease was for five years, meaning that Nanjing Sue was 


still operating out of the chairman’s property when it secretly acquired a controlling interest in the Jurong Twins.   


SAIC filings also show that Nanjing Sue’s board supervisor is an individual named Xing Jiuhong, who is the board 


supervisor of Nanjing Xinmeng Asset Management, an investment holding company which is 99.9% owned by 


Fullshare’s chairman.  


Finally, according to a bond prospectus filed by chairman’s private conglomerate, Nanjing Sue borrowed around RMB 


937 million from Fullshare Private in 2014, and borrowed RMB 588 million from it in 2015.   


Given that Nanjing Sue leases offices from Fullshare Private, borrows hundreds of millions of Chinese yuan from 


Fullshare’s chairman, and shares a board supervisor with another of his entities, we believe that Nanjing Sue is related 


to, and most likely controlled by, Fullshare’s chairman.  Accordingly, we infer that the chairman was the undisclosed 


beneficiary of the sale of the Jurong Twins.   


Fullshare denies that Nanjing Sue was or is a connected party.  It stated that Nanjing Sue’s lease from Fullshare Private 


was a normal commercial agreement, that overlapping supervisors did not make the companies related under Hong 


Kong rules, and that Nanjing Sue’s borrowings from Fullshare Private were irrelevant.11 


Essentially, Fullshare admits that our evidence is accurate but disputes our conclusion.  Yet Fullshare ignores the 


collective weight of the overlapping connections between Nanjing Sue and the Company.  Perhaps one or two such 


connections could be ignored.  But the number of connections are far too many, and the timing of the loans is far too 


suspicious, to convince us that this was anything but an undisclosed related party disposition.   


Disposal of Jurong Twins to Undisclosed Related Party

c. Chairman’s Brother Secretly Financed Another Disposition 
 


On June 25, 2015, Fullshare sold Jiangsu Fullshare Property Limited (“Jiangsu Fullshare”) to Nanjing Shanbao 


Investment Management Limited (“Nanjing Shanbao”) for RMB 467 million.  Fullshare recorded a RMB 79 million 


non-cash gain on the disposal.  Fullshare claimed that the buyer, Nanjing Shanbao, was an independent third party. 


However, on February 6, 2015, five months before the acquisition, SAIC filings reveal that Nanjing Shanbao borrowed 


RMB 378 million from Nanjing Jiangong Group Co., Ltd (“Nanjing Jiangong”), which is more than 50% owned by 


Fullshare’s chairman’s brother.  SAIC filings make it clear that the chairman’s brother secretly loaned 81% of the 


money that the buyer needed to acquire Jiangsu Fullshare from the Company.  


In its Response, Fullshare claims that the “loan to Nanjing Shanbao advanced by Nanjing Jiangong of RMB 378 


million… is for other business transaction(s) between Nanjing Shanbao and Nanjing Jiangong which is 


completely unrelated to the disposal of Jiangu Fullshare.”12 


Fullshare denies that the loan was related to the acquisition, insisting that the timing is just a coincidence.  But 


Fullshare gives no details as to why Nanjing Jiangong was loaning such funds to Nanjing Shanbao, other than to claim 


it was for “other business.”  What other business? In our opinion, the absence of any details or justification for the 


loan in Fullshare’s Response suggests that the Company cannot find any reasonable explanation for why its chairman’s 


brother would be loaning money to a buyer mere months before the recipient purchased Jiangsu Fullshare from the 


Company.  Why should investors have any faith that the loan was merely a coincidence when Fullshare cannot provide 


any other justification or explanation for the loan?  


It is also worth noting that Fullshare never disclosed any transactions between the buyer and the chairman’s brother 


until Glaucus exposed them to the public.  If such connections were so innocent, why wouldn’t Fullshare disclose 


them at the time of the disposition?  Given that the Company failed to disclose this secret related party involvement, 


and that the chairman’s brother appears to have put up the money for the purchase, we continue to infer that the 


chairman and his family were the ultimate beneficiaries of the transaction.   


d. Singapore Sling 
 


In December 2016, Fullshare sold its 51% equity interest in a Singapore joint venture, Fudaksu Pte. Ltd. and its 


subsidiaries (the “Fudaksu JV”), to Chinafair Investment Limited (“Chinafair”), for cash consideration of RMB 120 


million.  As usual, Fullshare claimed that the buyer was an independent third party.   


In our Report, we pointed out substantial evidence suggesting otherwise.  Publicly available SAIC filings reveal that 


Yang Wen-Ta, a director of Chinafair, is also the shareholder, director, and general manager of Fullshare Nanjing 


Leisure Agricultural Development Company Limited (“Fullshare Leisure Agricultural”).  In addition, another 


Chinafair director Mao Zhengping is currently Fullshare Leisure Agricultural’s legal representative and chairman.  


On an employment search website, Zhaopin.com, Fullshare Leisure Agricultural advertises for available positions and 


states that it is a subsidiary of Fullshare Private. 


In its Response, Fullshare does not address this evidence in any meaningful way.  Instead, it simply asserts that 


Chinafair is not a connected party under the listing rules.   


But surely, Fullshare Leisure Agricultural is a connected party.  It shares the Fullshare’s name, and claims on an 


employment website that it is a subsidiary of Fullshare Private.  Given that two of Chinafair’s three directors occupy 


the positions of director, shareholder, general manager, legal representative and chairman of Fullshare Leisure 


Agricultural, we think such significant overlap indicates that Chinafair is a connected party to the chairman and the 


Company.

There is also overlap between Chinafair and Nanjing Saiteng.  Chinafair’s two directors serve as the board supervisor, 


executive director and general manager of Nanjing Saiteng.  According to the website of Fullshare Trade, which is 


the procurement and trade department of Fullshare Private, Nanjing Saiteng is its subsidiary.  


Fullshare denies that Nanjing Saiteng is a subsidiary of Fullshare Trade, saying that the information on the website is 


“outdated.”  But again, other than a blanket denial, no context or evidence is given to explain why Fullshare Trade 


would claim on its website that Nanjing Saiteng is its subsidiary.  


Every investor must make up their own mind, but in our opinion, the connections are too voluminous and significant 


to suggest any conclusion other than that Chinafair is a connected party and that this was yet another undisclosed 


related party transaction.

4) Undisclosed Related Party Acquisitions 
 


In our Report, we also presented evidence of instances in which Fullshare acquired businesses or assets from parties 


secretly connected to or controlled by its chairman or his family.  Like undisclosed related party dispositions, we 


believe that these undisclosed related party acquisitions signify a complete disregard for shareholders and call into 


question the value of the acquired assets.  


a. Tianyun Hustle 
 


On October 15, 2014, Fullshare bought 80% of the equity of Nanjing Tianyun Real Estate Development Company 


Limited (“Nanjing Tianyun”) from Nanjing Tonglu Asset Management Limited (“Tonglu”) for RMB 500 million.  In 


the acquisition announcement, Fullshare stated that the sellers were independent third parties.    


In our Report, we highlighted evidence from SAIC filings indicating that Tonglu was a newly-formed shell entity 


secretly connected to the chairman’s family.  According to SAIC filings, Tonglu was incorporated on July 15, 2014, 


just three months before it sold Nanjing Tianyun to Fullshare.  On July 28, 2014, just days after incorporation, SAIC 


filings show that Tonglu acquired 95% of Nanjing Tianyun from Nanjing Jiangong, which is more than 50% owned 


by Fullshare chairman’s brother, Ji Changbin. 


In its Response, the Company claims that Nanjing Tianyun was transferred to chairman Ji’s brother’s Nanjing 


Jiangong to secure an unrelated loan, and when the loan was repaid, it was transferred back.  The Company denies 


that the sellers were connected in any way to the Company.  But this is far from a viable explanation for the suspicious 


pre-transaction timeline.  


Usually parties must pledge collateral for a loan, not transfer subsidiaries.  So the notion that Nanjing Jiangong owned 


Nanjing Tianyun because it lent money to its original purchasers is not credible.  As usual, Fullshare denies 


wrongdoing but provides almost no further details to support their explanations.   


The facts are plain.  The chairman’s brother owned Nanjing Tianyun before transferring it to Tonglu a short time 


before Tonglu (a newly formed entity) sold the asset to Fullshare.  Investors must decide for themselves, but in our 


opinion, it is obvious that Nanjing Tianyun was transferred to the Company via a shell entity so as to conceal the 


family’s prior ownership.  Accordingly, we believe that this was another undisclosed related party transaction and as 


a result, we doubt the legitimacy of the large “gain on purchase” that the Company recognized on the acquisition.   


b. Zhonghe Hustle 
 


On September 27, 2016, Fullshare bought 35% of Nanjing Jiansheng Real Estate Development Co Ltd (“Nanjing 


Jiansheng”) from Nanjing Zhonghe Shiye Investment Development Company Limited (“Nanjing Zhonghe”) for RMB 


17.5 million.  As per usual, Fullshare claimed that the seller, Nanjing Zhonghe, was an independent third party. 


However, publicly available SAIC filing reveals that Ji Changrong, brother of Fullshare’s chairman, was the 


shareholder and sole legal representative of Nanjing Zhonghe until July 2015, when he transferred his shares to the 


entity Nanjing Sue, which was the parent entity of the seller at the time of the transaction with Fullshare.     


Fullshare denies that Nanjing Sue is a related party, but we suspect otherwise.  As discussed above, Nanjing Sue leases 


office space and borrows hundreds of millions of Chinese yuan from the chairman’s Fullshare Private.  Nanjing Sue 


also shares a board supervisor with another entity owned by the chairman.  In our opinion, such connections indicate 


that Nanjing Sue is an undisclosed connected party.   


Ultimately, in our Report, we presented evidence that Fullshare’s stock is manipulated and that its chairman and his 


family have engaged in a number of undisclosed related party transactions with the Company.  Such behavior by the 


Company’s inner circle is so reprehensible and untrustworthy that we believe that Fullshare is simply uninvestible.
