Provectus: Strong Sell On Unviable Phase III Trial, Insufficient Cash,
And Fraud Allegations
Jun. 24, 2014 1:26 PM ET32 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Additional research indicates PVCT's Phase 3 Trial is designed in such a way that it
seems completely unviable and effectively impossible to enroll or execute.


Both industry data and PVCT's own internally generated documents show the
current Phase 3 proposal seems too small, too short of duration, and far more
expensive than guided.


PVCT seems impossibly low on cash to run a Phase 3 trial with more equity
issuance imminent. Plus PVCT faces multiple fraud allegations from shareholders
and lawsuits.


Recently settled shareholder lawsuit sheds interesting insight on how PVCT
management views shareholders and potentially why the Phase 3 trial was designed
as such.


New evidence connects PVCT to paid stock promoter "Hunter Marketing Group,"
contradicting PVCT management’s communication with investors.


In prior reports, I outlined my view on why I value shares of Provectus (OTC:PVCT) at $0.
PVCT remains wildly overvalued with an estimated fully diluted market cap of ~$200m,
which I believe creates at least -90% near-term downside risk before PVCT eventually
goes bankrupt.


I think the case for PVCT hinges on the market's view of management's credibility and the
outcome of the Phase 3 trial. Unfortunately, new research shows PVCT's Phase 3 trial
seems clearly unviable (raising questions about management motives), PVCT's own
documents indicate this Phase 3 trial is unviable  and PVCT's cash seems woefully
insufficient to complete the trial while management appears elusive on this topic as
recently as last week's conference call. Most importantly, the study seems designed in
such a way that it seems effectively incapable of enrollment and completion in my view.
Keep in mind this is the same management team that has not started Phase 3 trials for 4
years (so far) while collecting an estimated ~$30m in compensation over that timeframe.

Perhaps most concerning, new research proves PVCT's has connections to paid stock
promotion firm "Hunter Marketing", the firm which paid Small Cap Street $10k for
promoting PVCT. I believe these connections appear irrefutable and seem contradictory to
PVCT management's statements to investors. Could investors who PVCT raised money
from while PVCT stock may have been artificially inflated due to paid stock promotion sue
PVCT and demand their money back? Could this accelerate a potential PVCT
bankruptcy?


Why would PVCT management ever pursue a Phase 3 trial that seems to me to be
incapable of completion and could take many years longer than expected? The third
section of the report covers PVCT management's history of compensation so excessive
they were sued and forced to give some of the money back to shareholders. I include the
related shareholder lawsuit (with full documents linked) PVCT had to settle, along with
new fraud allegations PVCT is facing in court (with full documents linked).


With more dilution on the horizon, little cash, NYSE de-listing risk and a trial that seems
effectively impossible to enroll to me, I see only negative catalysts in the near term and
reiterate my price target of $0.00. I believe investors will not be willing to continue funding
incredible management compensation or the accelerating cash burn. I expect PVCT will
run out of money at that point and go bankrupt, leaving the equity worthless like the many
companies connected to the individuals involved here.


PVCT's Highly "Questionable" Phase 3 Trial Seems Totally Unviable


Based on "apples-to-apples" comparisons with other recent or ongoing trials, PVCT's own
data, and an industry standard clinical-trial mathematical analysis, I believe:


1. PVCT's proposed Phase 3 trial does not have enough patients to be credible.
2. Trial Duration is far too short to produce useful data or have a credible shot at FDA


approval.
3. Most shockingly, the trial appears to be designed in such a way that it seems


effectively incapable of successful enrollment or completion.
4. PVCT is not even close to having enough cash on hand to finish the trial,


management's answers seem evasive on this topic.
5. PVCT management actions imply imminent shareholder dilution and more equity


issuance.
6. It's very unlikely a partnership agreement with a large pharma company will be


reached soon (I personally doubt this will ever happen) as management has already
been touting this for years.

PVCT Phase 3 Trial Design Appears Obviously Unviable


On the June 3 conference call, PVCT management offered an extremely rough outline of
its proposed Phase 3 trial for PV-10 (Rose Bengal) in locally advanced refractory
cutaneous melanoma. Management said the randomized, multi-center trial would likely
include 210 patients randomized 2:1 (drug vs. standard of care). PVCT expects to start
enrolling patients later this year and for that process to take 18 months. The trial would
follow patients for just 12 months and interim data will be available after 50% of the
expected events occur, which management put at 15 months after patient accrual begins.


I believe investors who are not experts on clinical trial design for melanoma may be misled
on the implications and details of this trial.


Let me explain the four primary reasons this Phase 3 appears to me to be totally unviable:


1. Phase 3 trials for melanoma typically require a much larger sample size than just
210 patients. For example, Amgen enrolled over 400 patients for its Phase 3 for its
intralesional drug (talimogene laherparepvec or "T-VEC") in advanced melanoma. Merck's
Phase 2 trial for Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in advanced melanoma has enrolled 510
patients. Even Vical's failed Allovectin cancer trial (which PVCT's doctor Agarwalla was
involved in) enrolled 390 subjects, nearly double PVCT's proposed patient population.


a. If Agarwalla's failed trial had 390 patients, why does he expect a successful response
from the FDA for a much smaller trial of only 210 patients? How could the FDA possibly
establish a significant improvement in overall survival and increase in lifespan of cancer
patients in such a short period of time with that tiny patient population?

leave a mark)

b. In fact, PVCT's OWN DOCUMENTS indicate they previously thought 210 patients
would be insufficient, as they targeted 300 patients!


(from PVCT's own 2010 ASCO poster)


2. The Phase 3 trial is far too short to generate the necessary data in my view. It
seems clear to me, and PVCT, that the FDA is focused on overall survival (OS) and it
takes a long time to prove a benefit there. Furthermore, the idea that PVCT will be able to
stop such a trial midway through and potentially attract a partner based on interim data
also seems not credible.


Merck's trial for Pembrolizumab for example, started in November 2012 and requires 24
months of follow-up data. Clinicaltrials.gov shows the estimated completion date for data
collection in the Pembrolizumab study as March 2015, or a full 28 months after the start
date. Final study completion is not expected until January 2016, or 38 months after start.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2284173-provectus-strong-sell-on-unviable-phase-iii-trial-insufficient-cash-and-fraud-allegations 5/27


a. Don't take my word for it though, just think about it logically to yourself: Does it really
make sense to you that the FDA would approve widespread use of something as serious
as intra-lesional injections of Rose Bengal in late stage cancer patients based on just 12-
15 months of data based on a small number of patients? Do you truly believe the level of
statistically significance the FDA requires about improvement in survivability can be
proven in late stage cancer patients with less than 18 months of data?


b. PVCT itself previously estimated Phase 3 study duration of 30 months…


(PVCT's own 2010 presentation in Sydney at SMR)


c. In 2012, PVCT's own doctor Sanjiv said:


phase 3 trial of PV-10 is expected to include up to 300 subjects with stage IIIB-IIIC
melanoma… Enrollment in the 30-month trial is scheduled to begin in the
second half of 2012.


3. PVCT's targeted patient population seems impossible to enroll in a timely manner
to me.


a. All the above objections above may be irrelevant though as, upon deep dive of the trial
details, the Phase 3 trial enrollment criteria appears designed in such a way that
completing trial enrollment in any reasonable time frame seems virtually impossible to me.

b. What follows is an unusually detailed "nuts and bolts" discussion of patient enrollment,
if you are a shareholder this is extremely important for you and I recommend you read
this a few times if necessary until you understand it perfectly.


c. PVCT apparently proposes patients with cutaneous melanoma that are B-raf negative
and have progressed following immunotherapy. I believe this is a very, very small potential
population to try and draw patients from. It seems that ~60% of patients harbor b-raf
mutations and would have to be automatically excluded.


d. Of the remaining patients, they would then progress to immunotherapy, which typically
has very high response (~55%) and disease control (nearing 95%). By the time patients
get through these requirements, the patients who are left and eligible for PVCT's trial are
going to be extremely few.


e. Then, of the patients who have progressed following immunotherapy, they probably
won't live very much longer (tragically) and, due to cancer spreading, likely will not be
"M1a" at the time they progress so they also would also seem to be ineligible for PVCT's
trial.


1. M1a: Metastasis to skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph nodes in distant parts of the
body, with normal LDH levels.


2. Enrolling 210 patients who fit all this strict criteria and are willing to sign up for this
controversial study is going to be nearly impossible in my view. If it is even possible, it
could take many, many years to fully enroll this study, which I believe is already too
small.


1. Is this why PVCT has backed down from their own initial estimates of 300 patients
for the Phase 3 trial? (which is also too small by my estimates)


f. Now follow this very carefully because it is critical: for powering the study, we can
assume patients live 24 months, based on the AMGN T-vec data. Note the T-vec patients
were sicker so the median overall survival could be longer for PVCT, potentially
necessitating a larger trial to show it. So I assume a 90% power at p=0.05 to detect a 3
month difference on a 24 month baseline. Furthermore, assume 12 months to enroll and
follow for 36 months after completing enrollment, with 1:1 randomization…


1. Using these estimates: N=2,231! (as in over 2 THOUSAND patients) to fulfill this study
based on these estimates.


2. As a result, I believe PVCT's Phase 3 trial, as currently proposed, is effectively
incapable of being enrolled.

Plunge-igo Montoya Weighs in on the PVCT Phase 3 Clinical Trials: "Clinical trials?
You keep using those words. I do not think that means what you think it means."


(picture source: created by me with credit to "Princess Bride" for awesome original)


Considering PVCT has already been told by the FDA there is a "paucity of data" for a
compound where "the preclinical data do not demonstrate substantial improvement over
existing therapies" pursuing this half-cocked trial seems suicidal for shareholders to me.


4. PVCT's Cash Balance Seems Woefully Insufficient to Complete Phase 3 Trial,
Management Actions Imply More Dilution Coming Soon.


a. Even if you disagree with the above, PVCT's cash balance doesn't even seem to me to
be enough to complete the inadequate Phase 3 trial they have proposed, let alone
something more credible. Even more upsetting, PVCT management seems elusive when
asked this very simple question about having sufficient cash for Phase 3 trial completion.


b. PVCT ended the March quarter with $16.6mm in cash and further diluted shareholders
by raising an additional $4.3mm through a private placement in April with Network One
Financial, a questionable underwriter who has faced fraud allegations discussed in my first
report. This ~$20.9mm in cash minus a -$2.8mm burn in Q2 should leave PVCT with
~$18.1mm in cash. I don't see how this is remotely sufficient to fund even their apparently
inadequate Phase 3 trial.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2284173-provectus-strong-sell-on-unviable-phase-iii-trial-insufficient-cash-and-fraud-allegations 8/27


c. PVCT is currently burning ~$11m per year just for normal operations and I estimate
PVCT's currently proposed Phase 3 trial will take ~2 years before sufficient data is
gathered and compiled in a way where PVCT can move forward.


d. PVCT should need to keep $3-4m in cash just to avoid the "going concern" statement
from their auditor and avoid delisting issues so I estimate that is effectively cash they have
to keep on hand and is not available to be spent.


e. Furthermore, CROs that manage these trials typically put the cost at ~$75,000 per
patient for a Phase 3 oncology trial. Even if we assume PVCT's short timeline is sufficient
and 210 patients is enough, the trial will cost ~$15.75mm. If PVCT were to attempt a more
credible study of 400 patients, Phase 3 trial cost would jump to $30m.


f. Assuming at least two years of cash burn at the same rate, $22m, and a $15m trial cost,
plus $3m of cash necessary to avoid a "going concern" statement, I estimate PVCT needs
~$40m of cash just to complete their proposed Phase 3 Trial of PV-10. With a more
credible trial and 400 patients, total cash needs over the next 2 years jump to $50m+. The
current ~$18m PVCT has is not even close to enough cash to complete a trial as far
as I can tell


g. None of this includes any potential cash burn from the lawsuits PVCT faces, the cost of
any potential regulatory costs or the potential for shareholders who feel misled to demand
cash returned through legal action.


h. No matter how I look at it, there is a giant looming cash shortfall that PVCT simply
doesn't have. Of course, should a larger or longer trial with more follow up be necessary
or if the FDA requires additional data, follow on studies or has any special requests,
PVCT's cash shortfall will only increase.


i. The cash question is crucial because: what if PVCT can't get cash or goes bankrupt then
what good was it to even attempt the trial? Or what if shareholders are brutally diluted
(more) and their ownership is reduced to an immaterial fraction of what they started with?


j. Worryingly to me, management does not seem to provide particularly clear answers on
this topic. Skip to 26:30 of the latest call to hear management apparently fumble the
seemingly simple question from Sandy of how much the study will cost:

we have adequate capital to do the work that Eric has outlined, certainly to get to
the interim analysis, but we have adequate capital, the phase 3 study I believe it is
fair to say is going to be well managed in terms of the cost… the overall cost of the
study should be, based on our history, well within our adequate capital. For the
entire study. But certainly we've been saying we'll get to the interim analysis, the
interim read out on the existing capital.


Uhh… what? Where in that response is your estimate of the cost of the trial? The investor
just asked you how much the study would cost and if you have enough cash to complete it
but you are responding about "interim analysis" and "interim readout." This does not
appear to be a straight forward answer to me and this, along with simple math, does not
indicate they can complete their trial with the cash on hand.


What will PVCT do if investors simply will not continue to provide them with more cash in
exchange for more and more stock shares?


5. Management's Actions Imply More Near Term Dilution for PVCT Shareholders


a. Unsurprisingly, PVCT's lack of cash seems further reinforced when one looks at PVCT
management's actions. In PVCT's recent proxy statement the company asked
shareholders to vote to increase the total authorized share count:


approve and adopt an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the
number of shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, that we are
authorized to issue from 250,000,000 to 300,000,000 shares


b. The only reason a company would try to make this type of amendment is anticipation of
future share issuance. If PVCT thinks they have enough cash or thinks a partner is coming
soon why are they signaling they plan to issue even more shares? How long can this go
on?


c. As a reminder to readers, PVCT shareholders have endured crushing dilution of
2,060% so far. I expect continued material dilution: if PVCT increases its total share count
to 300m that is an additional 50,000,000 shares to be issued.


Note, PVCT's management team has waited 4 years to begin Phase 3 trials. A 2010
article was expecting PVCT Phase 3 trials in 2011, then this article in 2012 stated PVCT
phase trials would begin in late 2012 or early 2013.

What possible motivation could PVCT management have to engage in an unviable study?
Why would PVCT management ever wish to delay or pursue a trial that could take many
years to be completed?


I estimate management made a whopping $30.3 million of stated compensation during the
"gap" period in PV-10's history between the Phase 2 trial and 2013 alone!

PVCT Management: Forced to Pay Back Excessive Compensation, Now Facing
Fraud Allegations and More Lawsuits


Investing in speculative and early stage ventures hinges on both management quality and
also your trust in them to look after shareholder value in a selfless manner.


PVCT management allegedly granted themselves such egregious compensation they
were sued by shareholders and then, in an incredibly rare outcome, have been forced to
repay some of this compensation. For insight into how PVCT management apparently
thinks about PVCT shareholders I would like to post the various documents involved in full
here for the public good as I do not believe PVCT shareholders understand the
implications of giving their money to this management team.


The Kleba Lawsuit (in full here) alleges management essentially paid themselves 1.05m
options in both 2010 and 2011 when PVCT's compensation plan clearly limits that to 100k
options per person (section 7.2(d)). As a result of alleged "breach of fiduciary duties and
waste of corporate assets" for just the years in question, PVCT's only 4 executives
received $11.2m in bonuses. The $4.8m in 2010 bonus for example, constituted 57% of
the company's R&D costs (R&D was just $8.4m). While Kleba only owned PVCT shares
since 2008 and so could not sue for insiders' actions prior to this date, the footnote in the
lawsuit indicate PVCT's management team was violating the shareholder approved stock
plan for years back in 2004, 2005 and 2006 also. The "settlement" proposed is shocking
as are the details.

Furthermore, due to recent issues PVCT management now faces a barrage of fraud
allegations and lawsuits from shareholders. Examples include lawsuits cv-01263, cv-
01245, cv-01243, and cv-01231.The allegations in these lawsuits are serious, ranging
from "making false statements" to "failing to disclose adverse facts known to them about
Provectus." Even worse "defendant's fraudulent scheme and course of business that
operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of Provectus securities…" I strongly
recommend you read these lawsuits I have posted for you in the footnotes.


I would be careful investing in management teams facing fraud allegations, more lawsuits
and have a history of violating shareholder approved compensation plans, resulting in
forced legal action regarding paying themselves egregious amounts of money.


PVCT Demonstrable Connection to "Hunter Marketing" Appear to Contradict
Management's Public Statements.


Small Cap Street LLC has promoted PVCT stock, including issuing a "research" report in
January with a $62 price target, which would value the company at an absurd $15.5
billion. Small Cap Street says that an entity called Hunter Marketing paid $10,000 for this
promotion. PVCT management has denied any connection to Small Cap Street or Hunter
Marketing for the purpose of publishing promotional research on the company. Specifically
in the following public statement:


The article indicates that Provectus is 'connected to questionable stock pumpers
promoting PVCT including Small-Cap Street LLC.' To the contrary, Provectus is not
connected in any way to Small-Cap Street LLC or any other similar promoter.


However, my research shows PVCT is indeed connected to stock promotion firm Hunter
Marketing, Darren Lopez, and Kip Eardley. My research appears to me to contradict this
public statement by PVCT management and, along with the BTD disclosure fiasco, I find
the discrepancy concerning both from a management credibility standpoint and also that I
personally do not believe credible companies should be associated with paid stock
promotions.

Explaining the Curious "Hunter Marketing" and Darren J. Lopez Connection to
PVCT:


The website Huntermarketing.co says it's a service of Hunter Marketing LLC. The
company offers a variety of public relations services to public companies. The disclaimer
notes it is paid by the companies it promotes, which raises the question of whether PVCT
hired Hunter directly? From the disclaimer page:


1. Huntermarketing.co is a service of Hunter Marketing, LLC, a financial marketing and
investor relations firm that has been compensated by the companies profiled. All
direct and third party compensation received has been disclosed within each individual
profile in accordance with section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933…


2. Hunter Marketing, LLC, and/or its affiliated will hold, buy, and sell securities in the
companies profiled…


This sounds pretty "similar" to a stock promotion firm to me...

The Whois.com lookup shows HunterMarketing.co registered to a proxy domain site.
However, InvestmentAce.com is apparently another site registered to Hunter Marketing
LLC, to a "Carrie Lopez" in Utah. The phone number also appears to be Darren J Lopez's
phone number used for Hunter Ventures LLC as well and not only does the address
shown appear to be Darren's but it also seems connected to an apparent "shell company
farm" called "Corp 95." Looking up Utah's corporate registration site for Hunter Ventures
LLC shows:


HUNTER VENTURES, LLC


Entity Number: 5928032-0160 
Company Type: LLC - Domestic 
Registered Agent: DARREN LOPEZ


I believe this means Hunter Marketing appears to be run by and connected to Darren J.
Lopez and his apparent wife Carrie Lopez . Unfortunately for shareholders, Darren Lopez
also seems to have connections running back 10 years to a Utah stock promoter and shell
company creator named Kip Donan Eardley, a 56% owner of SPM Group Inc., the shell
company that BECAME "Provectus Pharmaceutical, Inc." via a reverse merger.


Lopez showed up as a 5.2% holder (3.75mm shares) of Source Direct Holdings, Inc.
(OTC:SODH), an unprofitable Nevada incorporated marketer of cleaning products, in an
SC 13G filing dated 4/28/04. His listed address is the same one listed for Hunter Ventures
and appears to be Darren Lopez's house?


Lopez is listed in SODH's 10-K (9/10/04) as a Consultant affiliated with Ageless
Enterprises, LLC, identified as a "Utah limited liability company controlled by Darren J.
Lopez."

(chart from CapIQ)


Eardley appears to me to be a Utah stock promoter who served as the Investor Relations
contact for Source Direct. He's first listed on a press release in October 15, 2003,
announcing the reverse merger between public shell Global-Tech Capital Corporation
(GLTC) and Source Direct, indicating he came on board immediately after Lopez became
a significant stockholder.


The apparent owner of Hunter Marketing is directly connected as an associate and
business partner to the majority owner of the public shell company that PVCT merged into
during 2002. So who is this Kip Eardley who is connected to PVCT and Darren Lopez?


Kip Eardley Background: Creating PVCT


Provectus became a publicly traded company in 2002 through a reverse merger with the
shell company SPM Group Inc. SPM was 56% controlled by Eardley and John Chymboryk
through Capital Holdings LLC as of March 10, 2010, according to the 10KSB filed for SPM
on 3/31/00.


His FINRA Broker Check seems to include a regulatory issue in 1986 dating back to the
manipulation of shares of Freedom Coin by members of Equity One Corp. allegedly in a
"implemented and directed a scheme to manipulate the price of a stock."


Kip Eardley has apparently been involved in all sorts of questionable microcap OTC
stocks that wiped out investors, which you can google if you are curious.


Eardley is president of PACV ($261k market cap) and Google Finance shows no
financials since 1997

(chart from CapIQ)


Both Lopez and Eardley were involved in BFHJ: stock has declined -99.5%


(chart from CapIQ)


There are more "questionable" stocks and bad charts here but in the interest of time I will
move on.


So what does this all mean?


1. Hunter Marketing is apparently registered directly to Carrie while Hunter Ventures is
registered to Darren Lopez


2. Darren Lopez and Kip Donan Eardley are connected through various investments. Kip
Eardley was the majority owner of SPM Group, the reverse merger shell that ultimately
became Provectus . Many companies Kip Eardley has been involved in have imploded
while Kip Eardley has faced allegations of stock price manipulation.


3. Hunter Marketing has disclosures indicating it is "compensated by the companies
profiled"


4. We know based on disclosures that Small Cap Street was paid $10,000 by Hunter
Marketing for the Provectus report, and that Small Cap Street then in turn paid Osman
Ghani, the author of the PVCT stock promotion report.


5. THIS MEANS TO ME THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN PROVECTUS AND
HUNTER MARKETING, THE FIRM THAT PAID SMALL CAP STREET TO PUBLISH
ITS REPORT ON PVCT

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2284173-provectus-strong-sell-on-unviable-phase-iii-trial-insufficient-cash-and-fraud-allegations 16/27


So who paid Hunter Marketing? Did Hunter Marketing pay $10,000 to Small Cap Street
out of the goodness of Darren Lopez' heart? This is hard to believe.


I would not be surprised to see law firms dig deeper into these connections on behalf of
shareholders that got crushed on the price collapse. Could investors feel misled by any
potential paid stock price promotion sue PVCT for their money back? Would this further
put pressure on PVCT's already insufficient cash balance?


Regardless of the specific, given the connections outlined here it seems simply false to
me to state:


Provectus is not connected in any way to Small-Cap Street LLC or any other
similar promoter.


Management Response:


I called IR, the company, their media person and their main line multiple times and was
unable to get through to anyone. I look forward to management clarifying these issues in a
transparent and public way because I believe investors deserve better than what they are
getting.


Conclusion


I recommend investors avoid PVCT stock because I believe PVCT stock is worthless. In
my view, legitimate companies do not pay their executives excessively at the expense of
shareholders, nor do they have ties to paid penny stock promoters. Given PVCT's
continued management questions, apparently unviable Phase 3 clinical trial design, lack
of sufficient cash, failed BTD, and the years between completed Phase 2 trials and today, I
think it's safe to say if there were something here, it would have happened already.


Furthermore, PVCT now faces fraud allegations , a barrage of shareholder lawsuits and
has a very serious risk of being delisted from the NYSE. With the BTD failure, increased
share count, accelerating cash burn and multiple negative catalysts that have already
occurred and the more I expect to occur, I see no reason for PVCT to trade above the 52-
week low of $0.30 per share and reiterate my price target of $0.00 as PVCT cash burn
continues with excessive insider compensation until shareholders say "enough is enough"
and PVCT goes bankrupt, like many other companies connected to the people tied to
PVCT.
