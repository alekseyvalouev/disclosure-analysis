Citron Reports Further Results from  
Laboratory Testing: 


Questcor is Deceiving the FDA and Investors 
 


H.P. Acthar Gel’s Specified Active Ingredient Less Than 
20% of the Label Specification 





Bioactivity of Deamidated Hormone Fragment Far 
Lower than Pure ACTH 





The FDA has been Notified 
 
Citron admits that we were nothing short of amazed when we read Questcor’s (NASDAQ:QCOR)  
response to our report on the laboratory assay of HP Acthar Gel, which documented its actual 
contents.  Furthermore, the Street's silence in response to our findings was deafening. No 
accusations about mishandled  samples, no challenges to the credibility of our highly 
credentialed laboratory, nor any shred of a substantive reply to the harsh reality that Questcor 
is shipping a mislabeled, mis-dosed unproven drug, marketing it direct to vulnerable, 
chronically ill patients.  
 


Who in the medical community would have ever guessed that HP Acthar Gel was actually 
deamidated corticotropin?  In its entire decade long history, Questcor has never once uttered 
the word “deamidated” -- in presentation or in print, neither to the scientific, medical, nor 
investment communities. Yet, in some perverse alternative reality within a pharma universe 
that only they inhabit, “H.P.”, which everyone else thinks means “Highly Purified”, is 
presumably   an abbreviation for deamidated.  
 


In our first part of this expose’, we committed to follow up with further findings about the 
mysterious components of HP Acthar Gel. In this report, we will again present excerpts directly 
from a new letter that has been received by the FDA containing these new findings.  
 
After reporting these findings, we will address Questcor’s answer to our first report. Their reply 
was a broadside affront to the scientific community and government agencies that ensure 
safety of pharmaceuticals.

AS with the first report, the identity of the laboratory, the researchers and the attorney have 
been redacted, to insure that additional testing can be conducted, and findings submitted to 
regulators, without obstruction. We encourage all interested parties to file a FOIA request with 
FDA, to verify this and our prior report. And as before, the information in this report is available 
to all Federal regulatory agencies upon request. 
 


New Lab Findings Submitted to FDA 
 


The laboratory findings as submitted to FDA are summarized into three pivotal points:  These 
points prove to the FDA that in fact Questcor has either mislabeled H.P Acthar Gel, or does not 
even know themselves what is in their $30,000 vials. 
 


1) The Amino Acid Sequence Described in the Package Is NOT Porcine 
Deamidated Corticotropin.  
 


2) The Amino Acid Sequence Described in the Official Package Insert for 
Acthar Gel Is Not what the Laboratory Found in the Tested Vials of Acthar 
Gel.  
 


3) Acthar Gel Does Not Contain 80 IU/mL of Corticotropin – Deamidated or 
Otherwise 


With regard to each of these three points, we quote the actual text of the letter submitted, 
which refers to the specific laboratory findings, also submitted. The letter was authored by a 
former FDA staff counsel. Everything below in the beige shaded boxes is a verbatim excerpt 
from letter/findings received by the FDA.  Citron presents these excerpts without edit.

1)   The Amino Acid Sequence Described in the Package Insert for Acthar Gel, is NOT 
Porcine Deamidated Corticotropin. 


In contrast to Questcor’s statement in its SEC filing, the amino acid sequence detailed in the 
package insert for Acthar Gel does not accurately reflect the sequence for porcine 
corticotropin or porcine deamidated corticotropin.  Rather, the package insert includes a 
sequence known to be an outdated characterization of non-deamidated porcine 
corticotropin.  
 
More than forty years ago, the sequence identified in the package insert was believed to be 
porcine corticotropin.  However, B. Riniker et al. demonstrated in a 1972 article “Revised 
Amino-acid Sequences for Porcine and Human Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone” published 
in Nature: New Biology, that the amino acids at two positions in the previously published 
non-deamidated porcine corticotropin sequence had been incorrectly characterized. Prior 
to Riniker’s work, it was thought that there was an aspartic acid (Asp/D) at position 25, and 
a glutamine (Gln/Q) at position 30.  The amino acid sequence that appears in the Acthar 
Gel package insert follows this outdated characterization. 
 
Prior to the Riniker publication, it was known that porcine corticotropin underwent 
deamidation, and that reaction had been ascribed to glutamine (Gln/Q) at position 30, 
which upon deamidation became glutamic acid (Glu/B).  Riniker showed, however, that 
deamidation actually occurred at an aspargine (Asn/N) at position 25, due to the presence 
of the unstable Asn-Gly amino acid sequence at positions 25-26, converting the asparagine 
(Asn/N) to aspartic acid (Asp.D).  
 
Accordingly, Questcor’s contention that the amino acid sequence in its package insert 
represents deamidated porcine corticotropin is incorrect.

(*)  Amino acid #23 is presumably Tyrosine. There is no debate in the literature about the amino acid in position #23. However, 
the Acthar Gel insert lists this component as “Try”; we give Questcor the benefit of a doubt that this is presumably a typo. 
Other close abbreviations are “Thr” (Threonine) and “Trp” (Tryptophan), both would be incorrect.  


2)  The Amino Acid Sequence Described in the Package Insert for Acthar Gel Is 
Not what [the Laboratory] Found in the Tested Vials of Acthar Gel. 
   


More importantly, [the laboratory]’s findings indicate that the active ingredient 
in Acthar Gel is not even the representative of the amino acid sequence 
Questcor describes in the package insert.  The table below compares three 
amino acid sequences:  
  


 (1) the amino acid sequence described in the package insert for Acthar Gel that 
represents non-deamidated porcine corticotropin as it was understood prior to 
Riniker’s publication in 1972 (Row A) 
  


(2) the corrected amino acid sequence for non-deamidated porcine 
corticotropin based on Riniker’s research (Row B)   
 


(3)  the sequence for the deamidated form of porcine corticotropin that [the 
laboratory] found in the tested vials of Acthar Gel that we described, inter alia, 
in the December letter (Row C). 


 (Page 3)

This is clear scientific evidence that Questcor has misled patients, investors, and most 
importantly the FDA, about HP Acthar Gel. There is nothing more in the above submissions that 
needs to be editorialized. 
 


Questcor's Rebuttal 
 


Now that the FDA has all of the information on its desk, Citron will address the appalling 8-K 
submitted by Questcor after our last report. We will do this by quoting specific lines and adding 
our commentary. 





http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891288/000119312514079081/d685647d8k.htm 
 


What track record? A track record is a pattern quantifiable through actions and results. The 
only two numbers from Questcor relevant to this matter that can be “tracked” are: 
 


Total insider sales since Jan 2010:  $249,632,222.00 
 


Total clinical trials completed since the acquisition of HP Acthar Gel:  0 
 


That is a track record. 


“Questcor has a strong track record of providing therapies to patients with 
unmet medical needs.” 


-- CEO Questcor 8-K March 3, 2014 


3)  Acthar Gel does not contain 80 IU/mL Units of Corticotropin – 
Deamidated or Otherwise. 


Even if FDA determines that deamidated corticotropin is the proper active ingredient 
in Acthar Gel, as Questcor now claims, [the laboratory] found only a fraction of the 
amount indicated on the label.  [The laboratory] found that the average deamidated 
corticotropin concentration for the samples tested was approximately 0.21 mg/mL or 
16.8 IU/mL, which is only 20% of the 80 iU/mL concentration required by the FDA-
approved package insert.  Accordingly, the concerns about the drug’s efficacy we 
raised in the December letter are not resolved by Questcor’s recent admission that 
Acthar Gel contains only deamidated corticotropin as its purported active ingredient.  
 
As before if you have any questions about the laboratory’s findings or the test 
methods it used, we would be more than happy to answer them.  Please do not 
hesitate to contact me with any such questions and we will endeavor to get you 
answers immediately.

What is this, a restaurant recommendation?  What you “hear” from doctors?   What doctors?  
The ones you pay to speak at the many Olive Garden and Red Lobster speakers’ bureau 
engagements?  What’s next ... Are they are going to say that HP Acthar Gel has good Yelp 
Reviews? 
 


Proving safety and efficacy as required by the FD&C Act is more than “what we hear from 
doctors”. It requires rigorous scientific proof – and for numerous good reasons. Further, it 
requires explicit specification of, and rigorous adherence to, complete and accurate disclosure 
of active ingredients, so precise dosages can be rendered.  
 


Further note to Questcor:  Yes, Citron receives unsolicited letters from patients who have not 
been helped, or worse, state they have been personally harmed by H.P. Acthar Gel. We have 
the good judgment not to draw conclusions from these letters, because we know such 
communications do not stand the test of scientific rigor. Citron questions why such letters have 
never been submitted by Questcor to the FDA’s Adverse Events database.  
 


More importantly, contrary to the doctors that Questcor “hears” from are the many scientific 
and medical brain trusts who comment that they recognize no specific benefit of HP Acthar Gel 
over synthetic ACTH or steroid therapies. (all documented in previous Citron articles) 
 
  


“The key point often overlooked in all of this background noise, however, is 
something that Questcor employees hear regularly from doctors - that Acthar often 
helps patients with serious medical conditions who are in need of an alternative 
treatment option. After decades of neglect, the drug has found a small but 
important niche for doctors to employ in managing some of their most difficult-to-
treat patients, and it is quite often helping people who are very sick and have no 
other treatment options. From the regular reports that we hear from doctors, we 
know that many patients are being helped by the continued availability of Acthar.”

The lab’s assay was definitive:  The material in the vials is most definitely not the same amino 
acid sequence that is on the HP Acthar Gel label.  
 
Questcor goes on to quote the FDA website, with regard to their attempt to establish a claim of 
a “biological product” :  
 





http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/%20HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApp
lications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/ucm113522.htm 


“ Therefore, what the short sellers’ research firm claims to have found appears to be 
consistent with what is specified on the FDA-approved Acthar package insert. 
 
Acthar is a naturally-derived, complex peptide formulation that is not yet fully 
understood. This is not unusual for naturally-derived products. As the FDA notes on 
its website, “In contrast to chemically synthesized small molecular weight drugs, 
which have a well-defined structure and can be thoroughly characterized, biological 
products are generally derived from living material - human, animal, or 
microorganism - are complex in structure, and thus are usually not fully 
characterized.”

Wait a minute…what does that label actually say ????   
 


We thought so. Not just “Purified”, but “Highly 
Purified”. Oh wait. Depends where you’re reading! 





If you look on the label, yes, but if you read 
the 10-K…hmmm…. it used to say it was 
"highly Purified".  
 


But most recently management has stricken 
that threatening word “highly” from its 10-K:

513000004/questcor-10k2012.htm 
 
 
It’s up to investors to speculate as to why that word “highly” is suddenly too controversial 
to describe Acthar any longer….even though it’s still on the label as you can see above. 
Look, that’s what H.P stands for:  HIGHLY PURIFIED. But PURIFIED WHAT?

pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, used in 
Acthar, is processed in several stages to

  Spontaneous Remission and H.P. Acthar Gel 
 


Spontaneous remission is a medically recognized factor in both nephrotic syndrome and 
exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, the two highest revenue generating sources for Questcor 
from its marketing campaigns for H.P Acthar Gel. 
 





http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844306/ 


 
See also: http://www.irtces.com/multiple-sclerosis.htm 





Note that while Questcor has chosen to expand their aggressive marketing efforts for 
indications well known for spontaneous remission, they have the audacity brag that “doctors 
often claim their patients get better”.  
 


First, are these the doctors who are paid on the Speakers’ Bureau circuit, or receiving 
subsidized vials to inject patients at their offices?  It certainly wasn’t the conclusion of Aetna 
and Tricare, who have significantly reduced or completely eliminated this drug for 
reimbursement in their new policy statements.  
 


There are serious medical as well as financial consequences here. These matters call out for 
rigorous scientific inquiry, in the form of double-blind studies comparing H.P. Acthar Gel with 
steroid therapy, synthetic ACTH and placebo treatment arms. In the absence of such scientific 
evidence, the intense and increasing scrutiny of insurers and government agencies is 
unavoidable. 
 


Questcor’s business model, however, is dependent on these studies never being undertaken.  
 


Citron observes that it is commonly said that if you treat a cold, it will disappear in a week, but 
if you leave it alone it will last for seven days 


“Spontaneous remission is a well known characteristic of idiopathic 
membranous nephropathy, but contemporary studies describing 
predictors of remission and long-term outcomes are lacking.” 
 
In conclusion, spontaneous remission is common among patients with 
nephrotic syndrome resulting from membranous nephropathy and carries 
a favorable long-term outcome with a low incidence of relapse. A decrease 
in proteinuria >50% from baseline during the first year predicts 
spontaneous remission.

  Conclusion 
 


More deception from Questcor’s “Department of Defense”:  
 





Questcor spends about $6,000 per vial marketing the product. But it also supports a culture of 
massive insider sales generated from massive below-market option grants to the CEO and other 
insiders, which are typically cashed in as rapidly as they are vested. To put this in perspective:  
The salary of the head of the FDA for every year since its inception a century ago could be paid 
with just the money generated by CEO Don Bailey’s insider sales last year.  
 


Questcor engages in no meaningful R&D to identify the “real ingredients” in H.P. Acthar Gel. It 
has been 13 years since Questcor has been the custodian of this “panacea”, and yet there is still 
no completed credible objective clinical testing on it.  
 


Meanwhile, Questcor continues to be exposed to severe risks in its dependence on HP Acthar 
Gel as its only source of revenue. It is Citron’s opinion that the product is exposed to severe risk 
of being pulled off the market and subjected to a new and rigorous round of clinical trials, with 
trial design requiring pre-approval by FDA, before its aggressive marketing and sales effort in 
the U.S. can be continued.   
 


Meanwhile the following investigations remain open and unexplained: 


 Department of Justice, Southern District of New York Office 


 The Securities and Exchange Commission  


 … and possibly the Federal Trade Commission. 
 


Cautious Investing to All 
 


*** As for invoking the word “short attack” in its 8-K, Citron did not address the issue 
because this is no longer a “long vs short debate”. This is a search for the truth in what is 
inside a vial of a mystery drug product that has been aggressively marketed to the chronically 
ill with a price tag that “attacks” the US healthcare system. 


“Questor’s research and development program will continue to require significant 
investment of time and resources, including financial resources.”
