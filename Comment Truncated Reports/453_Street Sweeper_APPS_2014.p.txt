Mandalay Digital Group: An Overhyped Master Of Positive Spin
Aug. 27, 2014 7:00 AM ET70 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Mandalay has yet to provide any major details about a celebrated deal that sparked
its powerful rally, allowing the hype to build - and its shares to soar - instead.


Big sellers have gladly unloaded millions of shares of Mandalay stock since the
company announced that mysterious deal.


With its stock rocketing to a multi-year high, Mandalay seems very tempted to carry
out another dilutive secondary offering, after raising a fresh pile of cash earlier this
year.


Give Mandalay Digital Group (MNDL) credit for this much, at least. While the bleeding
technology firm still needs to prove itself, the company has definitely mastered the art of
positive spin.


A recent penny stock that spent years constantly reinventing itself in a desperate attempt
to merely survive, Mandalay may have just pulled off its most impressive transformation
yet. Suddenly worth more than $200 million - before clearing its first dime - Mandalay has
practically doubled in value over the course of two short weeks, with the help of some
tantalizing, if temporary, hype.


Just don't expect those breathtaking gains to actually last.


Worth barely $3 a share ahead of its latest quarterly miss, Mandalay has since rocketed to
a multi-year high of $6 a share after announcing a celebrated deal with Verizon
(NYSE:VZ) and delaying the release of crucial details while the ensuing hype sent its
stock on a powerful tear. With Mandalay encouraging investors to hope for the best, they
have responded by allowing their imaginations to literally run wild. Clearly sold on the
stock and expecting it to gain even further ground, one bullish hedge fund manager
recently stepped forward to ridicule the so-called "moron" who chose to slash his massive
position in the company despite exciting news of the celebrated Verizon deal.


"Who the hell is selling at these prices in light of this news?" the hedge fund manager
recently demanded, before declaring, "Why should we care?"

"Worrying about who is selling or how much more is coming for sale is extremely short-
sighted when we know we have a deal in hand that completely changes everything. (So)
waiting for the 'cleanup' trade is rather pointless, given where it should be trading when
the world wakes up to what is occurring…"


"The size and the scope of the VZ announcement is almost too big to fathom. But make
no mistake: It is huge."


Really? How do you know? So far, even Mandalay itself has yet to determine - or at least
divulge - the true value of that mysterious deal.


You're probably right about one thing, however. The identity of the recent seller doesn't
really matter. Ask yourself a far more relevant question: Why did that big Mandalay
shareholder chose to dump all of that stock, instead of holding out for even sweeter gains
or - better yet - buying some more of the high-flying shares?


Let's go back to the conference call that sparked this incredible rally in the first place and
search for some possible hints. An expert at translating overblown hype,
TheStreetSweeper has carefully read between the lines to uncover plenty of revealing
clues.


Hidden Messages


Management Hype: "We have signed a multi-year agreement with Verizon on their
intentions to deploy Ignite across their entire Android device line-up, which historically has
averaged approximately 20 million devices per year. (Nevertheless), we're not here to
update or change the guidance. I agree it's hard to see announcing Verizon is a negative,
that's for sure… In the big picture, this is a major milestone for our business and validation
of our broader strategy."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Trust us. This is fantastic news. Without that last-minute
deal, we would have simply reported another quarterly shortfall instead. So what if we see
no reason to boost the full-year guidance that we set before we ever landed that surprising
deal? Be patient. The pesky details can wait. Right now, it's time to celebrate!


Management Hype: "We're in the process of evaluating the near- and longer-term positive
impact of the Verizon expansion and look forward to providing you with an update as to
what this means to our fiscal 2015 guidance, as well as some insight and perspective into
fiscal 2016. We will work to come back to you within the next 30 days with more
specifics… One of the things we want to do is we want to improve how we continue to
manage the Street, manage expectations, and we continue to really want to work at that

… We want to really do this in a holistic way. So when we come back and give guidance,
we also want to have you guys think about fiscal '16 as well. We haven't really talked
about that, (but) now we have got some better visibility as to what that means for the
business."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Listen. If we really expected the Verizon deal to bolster our
results anytime soon, we would probably go ahead and increase our existing forecast right
now. We obviously chose to keep our mouths shut - and allow investors to keep their
wildest hopes alive - for a little while longer instead. Now sit back and wait for the
speculative hype to build. We stand to gain so much ground by the time that we release
any concrete details about this celebrated deal that even if we follow up with a
disappointing update, we could still come out well ahead in the end. Heck, we might
double on the anticipation alone.


Management Hype: "We believe that our current cost structure is sufficient to ramp and
scale our existing business and, while we do not expect material increases in operating
costs, as previously noted, we will be back to you with a more refined view once we fully
incorporate the expanded Verizon deal."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: We hate to even mention the potential risk of additional
dilution at this point, since our share count has practically doubled over the course of the
past year. We had no idea that we might need the sort of funds required to execute this
big Verizon deal when we last tapped the capital market six months ago, though. So don't
rule out the possibility of an imminent stock offering. Given all of the cash that we burn just
to finance our normal operations, we can't expect the $19 million left in our bank account
to last forever, you know.


Management Hype: "We raised capital in March with the exclusive purpose of helping us
continue to scale our business. We have been disciplined in our approach, having passed
on a few opportunities where we could not come to valuation terms that are in the best
interest of our business or shareholders. There are a couple of potential acquisitions that
we're excited about, but nothing to report on today. We know that we're in active
conversations and hope to have some news to report soon on the M&A (merger and
acquisition) front."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Forget it. We can't afford to sacrifice this tantalizing
opportunity. Just think of all the money that we could raise by selling a mountain of our
stock if it surges on news of this Verizon deal! We're not exactly flush with cash at the

moment, anyway. We'll find some way to spend that money - probably sooner rather than
later. Why on earth should we wait around until we're actually desperate? We need to
make the most of this situation while we still can.


Management Hype: "We do not view the past quarter as the new normal, as far as the
historical business, but rather just as a small and rapidly growing business making short-
term tradeoffs… We were disappointed but not surprised by the results, as they were not
materially off our internal budget. This quarter's results do not impact our view of the fiscal
year, as we have been consistent that the ramp for our new products was to begin this
summer, and the first quarter did not include any revenue from those launches. We
continue to reiterate our guidance for 12 million Ignite installs and 1 million IQ installs"
during the current year.


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Don't bother dwelling on our latest quarterly results. We
found the year-over-year deterioration in several of our key financial metrics rather
depressing ourselves. Who cares if we fell short of Wall Street expectations again? What's
another miss at this point? Now that we landed this fantastic deal with Verizon, we remain
on track to achieve our targets for the full year. We just averted a possible disaster!


Management Hype: "Verizon has been very pleased with the performance of Ignite on the
LG G3 smart phone, which launched on July 17… We expect launching Ignite on two
additional smart phones and one tablet with Verizon over the next 45 days. (We're) not
going to communicate any information that's proprietary to Verizon on device sell-through
for a specific device. We're not going to go there. What I will say, though, is that a lot of
device sales, whether it's from LG, Samsung, HTC or anybody (is) very seasonally driven.
The number-two month for device sales tends to be August, after December, in terms of
back-to-school and people doing upgrades and so on. It's not traditionally July, as a lot of
people are on vacation and doing other things. With that being said, Verizon gave us a
forecast on the device based on their experience with the G2. So I think we have got
pretty good visibility in terms of what we think that is."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: We can't expect this Verizon deal to suddenly transform
our company into an overnight sensation. After supplying Ignite for a single Verizon
cellphone with a low adoption rate for applications in general, we're just glad that the
company has decided to use our product on a few more of its devices at this point. Why
did that annoying analyst have to mention the weak adoption rate for that cellphone,
anyway? We wound up sort of contradicting ourselves by blaming seasonality and hinting
at a likely burst in activity this quarter, since we specifically warn of a slowdown during that
quarter in our official corporate filings instead. We probably shouldn't have mentioned that

stuff about Verizon providing us with "pretty good visibility" into the performance of that
particular device, either. What if investors leap to the understandable conclusion that
Verizon has provided us with some decent insight into the new business that we just
landed, too? Oh well. Maybe nobody will bother to connect the dots. We can probably
count on investors to take us at our word. It's not like they're demanding answers right
now, anyway.


Management Hype: "There are numerous new potential customers that we expect to close
and announce over the next 90 days and a few existing customers wanting to deploy
additional services as well. While we're not going to preannounce any of these deals, like
we have in the past, the bottom line is there is strong momentum in the marketplace for
our products and services, and we're taking advantage of that."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: We realize that this celebration won't last forever. We just
hope that we can follow up with another deal that's at least worth mentioning soon. After
spoiling the market with this big Verizon contract, we've set the bar for the future a whole
lot higher, though. Who knows when we will ever spark this much excitement again? So
let's just celebrate today and worry about possible headaches tomorrow. We fully intend to
savor this intoxicating buzz as long as we can, even if we risk paying it for it with a
massive hangover.
