Company 
Promotion


An effective roll-up acquirer serving the 
environmental, energy, fluid handling and 


filtration industrial segments. Its largest PMFG 
acquisition would be a success and allow for 


rapid delivering of its balance sheet, and 
renewed organic growth opportunities


Best of breed recycled auto part distributor 
capable of effecting a roll-up strategy and 
producing consistent double digit revenue 


and EPS growth


Best of breed roll-up in the test and

Leading logistics and transportation 
company that operates as a highly

Our Criticism A poorly constructed roll-up, we argued CECO

cash flow would fall significantly in 2017, and 
it could come under covenant pressure. CECO 
was misportraying its true leverage, while its

We estimated downside risk of 30%-60%


An ineffective roll-up by a management 
team with a history of financial failure

We argued AMETEK was not creating any 
value by delivering zero organic growth 


and that its financial statements showed 
signs of strain with aggressive 


accounting. We believed its premium

XPO’s financials should be viewed 
cautiously as a result of aggressive 


accounting assumptions, from a CEO 
known for aggressive roll-up strategies. 
The Board is not best suited to oversee 
the strategy, and the stock is a Wall St. 


darling poised to disappoint as its fragile

Successful 
Outcome


CECO took a goodwill charge in Q4’16 as 
predicted, and changed its presentation of its 
financial leverage in its investors presentation
- implicitly acknowledging our criticism. Q2’17

it admitted continuing challenges in its end 
markets, and its YTD operating cash flow has 


evaporated. CECO’s shares were downgraded, 
and shares fell >40%  


Gross margins have declined from over 
47% to 39%. The Company’s successive 
acquisition in Europe and domestically 


have failed to boost its share price. LKQ’s 
multiples have contracted significantly. Its 
CFO was replaced (Feb 2015) and its CEO 


recently stepped down (March 2017)


By early 2016, AMETEK began guiding 
down sales and earnings expectations 
for multiple quarters. Its CEO and CFO


abruptly retired. Its share price fell 
nearly 20% from our initial report date


XPO cut its guidance and missed financial 
targets. Its COO was terminated after 


XPO lost a substantial customer, believed

Short HRC: Spruce Point Sees 25%-55% 
Downside To $45-$75 per Share


• A History Of Value-Destructive M&A : In an attempt to make up for slow top-line growth driven by low demand for low-tech hospital furniture, 
management has spent ~$3.5B on M&A since FY09 on businesses across numerous sub-sectors and geographies. However, it has subsequently exited or 
divested of many of these businesses, usually at a loss after experiencing material top-line contraction. The sell side has cheered both Hill-Rom’s 
acquisitions and its divestitures, interpreting the former as an avenue to sources of more recurring sales and the latter as part of an initiative to exit low-
growth and low-margin business lines. Spruce Point, however, sees them for what they are: evidence of management treading water as it burns cash to 
acquire businesses which it subsequently drives into the ground under a corporate culture which, per formers, prioritizes hitting numbers above all else.


• Failure To Fully Write Down Assets: HRC has taken impairments of varying sizes in conjunction with a number of its divestitures of failing business lines. 
However, we identify two such exits for which management appears to have taken either no impairment or only an insufficient one. We believe that just 
over $500M of goodwill and other intangibles must be written off of Hill-Rom’s balance sheet, representing approximately 11% of Hill-Rom’s total assets.


• Non-Stop M&A And Confusing Math Masks A Slow-Growing Business: As management exits failing acquisitions, it instructs analysts to evaluate growth 
using its proprietary “core growth” metric, which adjusts growth for the negative impact of planned divestitures even before they occur. Management 
conveniently “re-bases” core growth every few quarters by adding new slow-growth business lines to non-core revenue, supporting consistent mid-single-
digit core growth even as these ring-fenced verticals drag on total sales. Why should investors give Hill-Rom credit for achieving higher growth when this 
growth is achieved by exiting businesses (typically at a loss) which it acquired and killed over the course of just several years? Why does management 
exclude divestitures from “core growth,” but include the inorganic sales contributions of new acquisitions? Management has been able to present top-line 
growth of almost 300 bps greater than total growth in some quarters by selectively adjusting the many puts and takes which make up “core growth.”


• Free Cash Flow Inflated From Chronic Mis-Forecasting of Capex And Low R&D: HRC has consistently misguided investors about capex requirements almost 
every year since FY10, and has underspent on capex against pre-year guidance by 20-30% since FY16. With most of its fixed asset base having a 10 year 
stated life, we expect years of capital neglect to weigh on future cash flow growth. HRC suggests that new product releases are a key driver of growth, but 
how will it continue to generate new product sales as it shrinks its capex and R&D spend even as core sales increase? Spruce Point has found that 
companies which mismanage capex often subsequently disappoint investors with material margin contraction (e.g. Caesarstone, A.O. Smith, and Gentex).


Hill-Rom (“HRC” or “the Company”) is a low-quality medical equipment roll-up which is rapidly approaching the end of its current growth cycle. 
HRC is a jumble of hospital furniture and medical device businesses assembled in part through $3.5B-worth of hasty acquisitions executed 


throughout the 2010s. Its atrocious record of M&A has left management to divest of a graveyard-full of failed acquisitions – many of them now a 
fraction of their initial sizes, and some exited at nearly complete losses. Analysts nonetheless give management credit for diversifying outside of 


capital goods, growing “core sales,” and expanding margins, largely through M&A (despite its failures) and recent product releases. However, 
Spruce Point finds that sequential new product growth has plateaued for three straight quarters, and is set to translate into depressed annual 


growth as the plateau rolls into Q4. Excluding the incremental contribution of these product releases, HRC’s organic “core growth” has been flat at 
best – a fact which has until now been hidden by new products and management’s discretionary and suspiciously fluid definition of “core growth.” 


Spruce Point also finds that nearly all margin expansion can be attributed to recent divestitures of low-margin businesses and acquisitions of 
higher-margin targets, leaving HRC with seemingly no route to higher profitability without continued M&A – an avenue which will be limited to it as 
it nears self-imposed leverage limits. Meanwhile, key executives have dumped stock and fled the Company at a break-neck pace through the past 
two years, perhaps in anticipation of its growth reverting to stagnant levels just as management prepares to release renewed long-term guidance.

Short HRC: Spruce Point Sees 25%-55% 
Downside To $45-$75 per Share


• Slowing Revenue Growth From New Products Sets Hill-Rom Up To Disappoint: New product releases such as its Centrella “smart” bed have prevented Hill-
Rom from showing dramatic core sales contraction over the last two years: these new products have grown from generating zero revenue prior to 2017 to 
over $400M in FY19 (expected). Management claims that it has accelerated the hospital bed repurchasing cycle by transforming the bed from a mere 
piece of furniture into a vital piece of hospital room technology. However, former employees and industry experts suggest that new product revenue will 
quickly normalize after a brief initial period of sales uptake. After adjusting for M&A and incremental sales contributed by new products, Spruce Point 
believes that Hill-Rom’s underlying sales growth has been effectively flat at best, versus management’s reported “core growth” of 2%-6% through the past 
two years. As the recent plateau in sequential growth from new products is set to become visible in annual growth starting this quarter, we believe that 
Hill-Rom may be set up to post disappointing growth in Q4 and in subsequent years as Company growth reverts closer to its ex-new product sales growth 
rate of ~0%. Heightened Company leverage close to its stated maximum of 4.5x will limit the extent to which management can keep core growth afloat 
through ongoing M&A, and could represent significant tail risk should the hospital purchasing environment weigh more heavily on growth.


• Few Avenues To Margin Expansion: Almost all EBITDA margin expansion since FY16 can be attributed to divestitures of lower-margin business and 
acquisitions of higher-margin businesses. Price increases, endless restructuring, and supposed post-acquisition synergies appear to have had almost no 
positive impact on profitability. The sell side continues to see room for close to 250 bps of margin expansion through FY21, but, with divestitures set to 
cease next year and with limited capacity for further M&A, Hill-Rom will likely achieve less than half the sell-side’s expected level of margin expansion.


• Aggressive Accounting Practices Under CFOs Tied To Roll-Up Train Wrecks Flatter Earnings: Management appears to have under-allocated for numerous 
reserve accounts consistently through the past four years. Spruce Point believes that management’s practice of under-reserving could have contributed a 
cumulative ~$55M to Hill-Rom earnings over this period. Hill-Rom would have to take a one-year hit of ~16% to earnings to bring its reserves back to prior 
levels. Management is also liberal in defining earnings adjustments, which together account for ~50% of non-GAAP income. Included in these adjustments 
are acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges, despite the fact that Hill-Rom conducts frequent M&A, and that it has engaged in restructuring 
every year since it split from Hillenbrand in 2008. Growth via sloppy acquisition rather than internal reinvestment has shifted spending out of capex and 
into M&A, which, alongside frequent downward capex guidance revisions, has allowed management to hit implied FCF targets. Worryingly, these practices 
have taken place under recently-departed CFO Steven Strobel – Audit Chair of Newell Brands, a levered roll-up whose stock collapsed amidst allegations of 
mismanaged inventory channel build-up – and his replacement, Barbara Bodem, a recent alum of scandal-tainted pharma roll-up Mallinckrodt.


• Accelerated Executive Exits Harbinger Of Disappointing Long-Term Guidance?: Over the past two years, HRC has lost its CEO, CFO, CIO, and two of its three 
division heads. It is currently on its fifth CFO since 2010. Executives frequently leave after having spent just one or two years (or fewer) at the Company. 
Employees report that management is increasingly focused on hitting financial targets to satisfy Wall Street, which has taken a toll on morale. We believe 
that HRC may be preparing to re-set expectations for the worse when it releases its new Long-Range Plan in Q4: rather than set unrealistic and unhittable 
long-term targets, it may be in the new management team’s interest to lower sales growth targets and impair zombie goodwill sooner rather than later.


• Slowing Growth And Earnings Adjustments Leave HRC Shares Overvalued: Spruce Point believes that the Street overestimates Hill-Rom’s forward sales 
growth due to its focus on the “core growth” metric and its lack of appreciation for slowing new product sales. We believe that investors will be 
disappointed by slower-than-expected sales growth and stagnating margins as the recent round of divestments is set to end. We also believe that 
investors should not give management credit for earnings growth achieved through dubious adjustments and reserve reductions, which have boosted 
earnings materially through the past four years. Spruce Point sees 25-55% downside in HRC shares when each of these factors is taken into account.

Resetting Expectations: Hill-Rom Will Soon Not 
Be The Grower That It Once Appeared


Since FY17, Hill-Rom management has depicted the Company as a mid-single-digit grower experiencing meaningful margin expansion, yet with 
room still to grow. Accounting machinations and temporary rounds of business segment pruning were responsible for much of this “core 


growth.” Successful product releases, while fleeting, also contributed to Hill-Rom’s apparent momentum. However, Spruce Point believes that 
each of these factors – whether fundamental, accounting-driven, or otherwise – are nearing the end of their respective runways. Facing slowing 
growth from new products, deficient investment in future product releases, limits to M&A, and the end of its recent divestment campaign, Hill-


Rom will soon no longer be able to masquerade as a consistent mid-single-digit grower with expanding margins.


Recent Appearance / Management Claim Spruce Point Observations / Near-Term Reality


• Revenue generated new products released since 2015 has grown 
to over $400M in FY19 (expected).


• Management Claim: New product revenue driven by diverse 
product base supportive of recurring revenue streams.


• Management Claim: Significant investments in capex and R&D will 
support growth from new products going forward


• Sequential growth in new product revenue has been flat or 
negative since Q1 FY19. Sequential growth plateau is set to 
translate into annual growth plateau in Q4.


• New product revenue “beat” in Q4 FY18 likely driven by lumpy and 
unsustainable capital goods orders. Tough Q4 comp could result 
in new product revenue contraction.


• Years-long underinvestment in capex / R&D, and international 
challenges, will likely limit growth from future new product 
launches and foreign markets


• EBITDA margin expansion of 200 bps since year-end FY16


• Management Claim: Investments in higher-margin products and 
acquisitions of higher-margins businesses have successfully 
increased Company profitability.


• Management Claim: Continued expansion into higher-margin 
verticals through M&A will continue to support profitability.


• More than half of EBITDA margin expansion has been driven by 
divestitures of failed acquisitions.


• With divestitures set to be completed by year-end ‘20, HRC’S main 
margin expansion engine will be exhausted in less than a year.


• Skepticism over continued M&A into higher-margin businesses 
due to self-imposed leverage limits and junk-level debt ratings 
from credit ratings agencies


• Consistent mid-single-digit “core revenue growth” since FY17


• Management Claim: By removing the impact of divested 
businesses, core revenue growth represents Hill-Rom’s true 
underlying run-rate sales growth


• Management has high level of discretion in engineering “core 
revenue growth.” Slow-growing businesses are removed from 
“core revenue” even if not yet divested or exited.


• Management no longer adjusts “core growth” for the positive 
impact of inorganic revenue from acquisitions.


• Goodwill and intangibles associated divested businesses 
seemingly due for impairment (up to 11% of HRC assets).

Core Growth, Total (Reported)


Organic Core Growth, Ex-New Products (50% Cannibalization / 50% Incremental)


Organic Core Growth, Ex-New Products (15% Cannibalization / 85% Incremental)


Anemic Core Growth Outside of New Products


Backing out the incremental contribution of new product sales to Company-wide core revenue growth reveals that growth has been anemic 
outside of new products. If just 15% of new products cannibalize legacy products, and 85% of new product growth is incremental – as 


management suggested in Q4 FY17 – YoY core growth among legacy parts of the business would have averaged -1.5% per quarter through the 
past two years, and would have only barely broken 0% only twice. Even if just 50% of new product growth is incremental, the average YoY core 


growth among legacy parts of the business would rise to only 0.7% over the same period. Either way, a plateau in new product sales growth 
would result in Company-wide organic core growth reverting to the -2% to 1% currently shown by the rest of the business.


Organic Core Growth Ex-New Products are Spruce Point estimates. “Organic” Core Growth excludes the contribution of acquisitions to core growth for the periods 
in which M&A was included in core growth (Q3 FY19).

Hill-Rom Set Up For A Q4 Miss Due to Sell-Side’s 
Misunderstanding of Underlying Growth?


Spruce Point estimates that, for Hill-Rom to hit consensus revenue estimates for Q4 FY19 against the recent plateau in new product sales growth, 
the Company would have to produce organic core revenue growth of between 3.4% and 4.1% excluding incremental new product sales, 


depending on the extent to which new product sales growth is incremental (versus cannibalization). This would require Hill-Rom to grow core 
revenue ex-new products at a rate ~200-400 bps above its Q3 rate, and ~300-550 bps above its average core growth rate (ex-new products) 


through the past eight quarters.


Non-Core Sales Contribution and Acquisition Contribution represent consensus estimates


Spruce Point believes that it is highly unlikely that organic core growth excluding new products will grow a whopping 300-650 bps above its 
trailing eight-quarter average in Q4 FY19. We believe that this may put Hill-Rom in a position to miss sell-side estimates for core growth.

growth ex-new products

Chronic Mis-Forecasting of Capex Has 
Temporarily Inflated Financial Results


Spruce Point observes that Hill-Rom has underspent on capex against its full-year capital spending forecast in seven of the past nine years, and 
is primed to underspend on its FY19 capex projection by an expected $27M, per consensus estimates. Hill-Rom’s chronic underinvestment in its 
own business has accelerated rapidly since the Welch Allyn acquisition: management has spent anywhere from 20-30% less on capex than it first 


projected in each year since FY16. With the Company appearing to have underspent on capex by a cumulative $80M between FY16-18 alone –
expected to rise to close to $110M by year-end FY19 – we are highly skeptical that it can continue to support its recent pace of growth through 


additional product releases or any other means. Rather, we believe that it may have to ramp up capex simply to support its base production 
capacity, in which management appears to have underinvested for upwards of ten years – the stated maximum useful life of its equipment.

Hill-Rom: FY18 10-K


With the largest component of Hill-Rom’s PP&E 
facing a maximum ten-year useful life – the same 
period over which management appears to have 
delayed capital spending – we believe that the 


Company may be forced to ramp up capital 
spending substantially in the coming years simply 
to support maintenance capex, to say nothing of 


growth capex.

Spruce Point has made numerous successful short calls on companies in which we have identified poor capex guidance and capital spending 
patterns – notably Gentex (GNTX), Caesarstone (CSTE), and A.O. Smith (AOS). In each of these instances, chronic capex mis-forecasting was a 
leading indicator of future margin, earnings, and free cash flow contraction. We are concerned that Hill-Rom may similarly demonstrate margin 


contraction and slowed FCF growth in coming quarters as management is forced to make up for seemingly-delayed spending on capex and R&D.

New Long-Range Plan Will Disappoint Under More 
Realistic New Product Growth Projections


With management set to announce its new three-year targets on its next earnings call, we believe that the Company may be preparing to re-set 
investor expectations for the business as new product growth begins to plateau. Even assuming that future product releases at the margin can 


support steady new product growth through the coming three years, we believe that analyst targets will be out of Hill-Rom’s reach absent 
extensive M&A or international growth, the latter of which has eluded the Company for over a decade. Notably, management is announcing its 


renewed long-range plan one year early, without having reached the conclusion of its previous three-year plan. We believe that they may be doing 
so in anticipation of missing its targets, and that it may be reissuing long-term guidance now to re-set expectations before disappointing 


investors against its prior long-range guidance.

Notably, with much of Hill-Rom’s c-suite fairly new to the business, we believe that – with much of its long-term equity incentives locked up for 
several years at least – management has incentive to re-set expectations to manageable targets now, rather than leave investors expecting Hill-


Rom to hit unattainable goals.

Acquisition-Fueled Growth Limited By Existing 
Leverage


Management said on its Q3 FY19 earnings call that it considers itself to have leverage capacity up to 4.5x Net Debt / Adj. EBITDA, suggesting that 
Hill-Rom has room to take on at most ~$900M in additional debt. With the Company’s two most recent acquisitions coming in at a ~9x EV / Sales 


multiple on average, Hill-Rom would appear to have capacity to acquire just ~$100M in annual sales, worth only 180bps in growth per year if 
spread over two years. As we expect Hill-Rom to underperform sales growth estimates by ~250bps and ~350bps in FY20 and FY21, respectively, 


we believe that the Company does not have sufficient capacity to make up for slowing organic growth through accelerated M&A.

Little Force Behind Margin Expansion 
Excluding M&A


Sell-side analysts are also bullish on Hill-Rom’s future opportunities for ongoing margin expansion. Since the Welch Allyn acquisition, Hill-Rom’s 
EBITDA margins have expanded by 200 bps, and management voices confidence that it can continue to improve Company profitability. However, 


Spruce Point finds that, excluding the impact of management’s divestitures of lower-margin businesses and acquisitions of higher-margin 
businesses, Company EBITDA margins have expanded by just 20 bps since FY16. With new product introductions and restructuring efforts 


apparently doing little to improve Company profitability, we question the extent to which margins will continue to expand into the future, 
particularly as management is set to wind down its divestitures within the coming quarters.

Accelerated Executive Turnover A Signal That 
Management Is Preparing To Re-Set Expectations?


Hill-Rom’s c-suite has turned over at a break-neck pace through the past two years. Since the middle of 2017 – the year during which 
management began exiting and divesting of failed acquisitions – the Company has lost its CEO, CFO, CIO, and the presidents of two of its three 
business segments. We expect that bulls will argue that this simply reflects a natural “changing of the guard” with the departure of CEO Greisch 
and recent shifts in Company strategy. However, the timing and nature of these exits suggest that this may not be the case. We find it concerning 
that those most knowledgeable about the business and its future plans are choosing to leave the Company (or dump their shares) rather than see 


the shift in strategy to completion. Heavy turnover among management will also not be conducive to the success of this shift in strategy.

Should investors interpret accelerated executive turnover and heavy insider selling as a signal that management is preparing to re-set investor 
expectations for the worse? With much of the executive team having joined only recently – and with much of their equity not set to vest for 


another several years – it may make sense for management to re-set future growth expectations to more reasonable levels, and to take 
seemingly-overdue goodwill impairments sooner rather than later.
17


CFOs With Ties To Struggling Roll-Ups


Both Hill-Rom’s current and former CFO have close ties to other heavily-levered roll-ups which have come under pressure themselves through 
the past several years. Recently-departed Hill-Rom CFO Steve Strobel (who remains with the Company as an advisor) has been a Director of 


Newell Brands (NWL) since 2006, and the Chair of its Audit Committee since 2014. Like Hill-Rom, Newell has aggressively pursued M&A since the 
early 2010s, burdening the company with businesses which failed to perform as anticipated. This has forced management to write down billions 
of dollars of assets ($8.3B in 2018 alone) and to divest of many of the businesses which it had acquired just years earlier – again, much like Hill-


Rom. New CFO Barbara Bodem, meanwhile, was most recently SVP of Finance at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (MNK), the center of a years-long 
controversy regarding its M&A practices and aggressive drug pricing. We do not find these ties reassuring.

Masking Poor Organic Growth With 
Destructive M&A?
19


Abysmal Record Of Value-Destroying M&A


Since the late 2000s, Hill-Rom has conducted frequent M&A, spending ~$3.5B on acquisitions since FY09 while simultaneously exiting and 
divesting numerous “non-core” business lines. The sell-side sees both as positive, the former reflecting management’s push to diversify into 


more recurring sources of revenue and the latter reflecting its efforts to exit slower-growth, lower-margin businesses. What analysts ignore is that 
most of Hill-Rom’s exits and divestitures have been of businesses which it acquired only several years prior. In almost every instance, the assets 


are impaired or sold at a loss after experiencing material declines in annual revenue. While the sell-side interprets both the acquisitions and 
divestitures as “progress,” Spruce Point believes that management is treading water at best, reaching for much-needed sales growth but 


ultimately burning cash while failing to add anything of lasting value to the Company.

“There have been some OK acquisitions, but very little consistency 
from management, and the execution has been poor. But there has 
been pressure to continue to pursue M&A to grow the 
company for shareholders, and to increase comp.”

Once Flourishing Businesses Reduced To 
Almost Nothing


In Mar 2018, Hill-Rom announced the divestiture of its third-party rental and services businesses, which provided movable medical equipment and 
services to U.S. hospitals. According to management, the business was generating $35M in annual sales at the time of the divestiture. This stands 


in stark contrast to the $166M generated by the business (then known as Mediq) in 2002, the year immediately preceding its $300M purchase by 
Hill-Rom (then part of Hillenbrand Industries). Judging from Hill-Rom’s cash flow statement, it appears that management sold the business for an 


immaterial sum. The Company was also forced to record a $24.5M loss on the assets as part of the divestiture.


While the decline of Hill-Rom’s third-party rental business may have been gradual, we find the dramatic decline in segment revenue striking, as 
we do the fact that management received almost nothing in return for the assets.

Killing Quality Brands With Failed Post-M&A 
Integration


In FY12, Hill-Rom acquired German hospital bed manufacturer Volker – a premier local brand at the time, per industry experts – for $85M, or 0.9x 
its annual sales of ~$100M. Just five years later, in FY17, management sold the business for effectively nothing after taking a $30M impairment 
charge on the segment. During this brief five-year period, Volker sales reportedly declined from ~$100M to ~$40M per year. Former employees 


noted that they would have been surprised if Volker was in fact generating $40M in annual revenue at the time of the divestiture. Remarkably, Hill-
Rom’s failure with Volker was almost a carbon copy of its failed acquisition of another German hospital bed manufacturer 20 years earlier: after 


acquiring premier brand L. & C. Arnold in FY94, management drove the business into the ground as it failed to expand the brand abroad and 
mismanaged its home German market. Over ~25 years, Hill-Rom managed to destroy Germany’s top two premier hospital bed brands, failing to 


learn from previous missteps.


Five Years Later: L. & G. Arnold assets impaired. Brand no longer 
appears on subsidiary list. Manufacturing sites removed from properties.

Sweeping Failed Aspen Surgical Acquisition 
Under The Rug?


On Jul 10, 2019, management announced its divestiture of “certain surgical consumable products and related assets” responsible for pro-forma 
annual sales of $100M. This divestiture has much better surface-level optics than Hill-Rom’s other recent exits: the Company received $170M for 


the assets, giving the deal a seemingly reasonable 1.7x sales multiple. What management didn’t tell investors is that these assets appear to 
represent the vast majority of Aspen Surgical, which Hill-Rom acquired in July 2012 for $400M – 3.3x sales, given its then-annual revenue of 


$120M (per management). The acquisition was lauded for reducing Hill-Rom’s dependence on capital goods, which are naturally more sporadic 
and less recurring than consumables. Analysts continue to cheer management’s efforts to move into the more recurring consumables space, but, 
at the same time, celebrate its exits from slower-growth, non-core businesses. Do either the consumables acquisitions or subsequent exits really 


represent “progress” if the acquisitions are destroyed, and if the exits simply bring Hill-Rom back to square one (at a loss)?

Trumpf Medical: Killing The Culture And 
Pruning The Business


Hill-Rom acquired German surgical equipment manufacturer Trumpf Medical from TRUMPF Group in Aug 2014 for $227M, net of cash acquired. At 
the time, Trumpf was generating ~$250M in annual sales, growing at ~5.5% per year. However, former employees report that many of the same 
cultural ills which plagued Hill-Rom’s other acquisitions came to afflict Trumpf: managerial instability, little understanding of the relevant sub-
sector, and an overbearing focus on hitting financial targets. Further, in Q1 FY17 – less than three years after the Trumpf acquisition – Hill-Rom 


divested of Trumpf’s Architectural Products division, responsible for ~10% or more of annual Trumpf sales, for just $4.5M. We question the health 
of the Trumpf business in light of these revelations.

“On the way down!”


Pros
Salaries are competitive. Colleagues are team players 
and friendly.


Cons
Since buying through Hill-Rom in 2014, catastrophic 
American conditions are prevailing. It's all about 
sales and profits, the employees have become 
unimportant.


Advice to Management
You have no confidence in the staff. Openness and 
honesty seem alien to you. And you lack the respect 
for the long-standing employees who know the 
company better than you!

Can Welch Allyn Be A Sustainable Growth 
Engine With Employee Morale Evaporating?


Hill-Rom’s most significant acquisition came in 2015, when it purchased Welch Allyn for $2.05B as part of its effort to diversify outside of capital 
goods. Given the business’ relatively broad suite of medical devices, management likely plans to depend on Welch Allyn as a major facilitator of 
new product-driven growth, as new product releasees in its Patient Support Systems segment (e.g. beds), while significant, are generally fewer 


and farther between. However, commentary from recent Welch Allyn employees suggests that company culture has been gutted since the 
acquisition, damaging employee morale and precipitating faster turnover. We wonder whether Welch Allyn will be the growth driver that 


management expects if its own overbearing and financial target-driven culture continues to drive away capable, long-tenured employees – a 
particularly grave risk to Hill-Rom given its recent dependence on new products for top-line growth.

Mortara: M&A-Driven Culture Kills Innovation 
And Employee Morale


In Feb 2017, Hill-Rom acquired Mortara Instrument, a provider of diagnostic cardiology and patient monitoring technology, for $290M (net of tax 
benefits). During its Q2 FY17 earnings call, management indicated that Mortara was generating approximately $115M in revenue per year at the 


time (growing by 4% per year), but former employees suggest that number might have been as high as $120M, and growing at a brisk 7-8% 
annually. This was among the first of Hill-Rom’s attempts to acquire technology to be included in a high-tech hospital bed, which management 
hoped to turn into a central piece of hospital room technology. However, former employees report that management struggled to integrate the 


innovative and entrepreneurial Mortara into its more overbearing corporate culture, and that key team members fled the Company not long after 
the acquisition. They estimate that Mortara sales could be down $25-30M under Hill-Rom’s control.

Seemingly Consistent Underperformance Among 
Acquisitions: Poor Integration, Or Sandbagging?


From Company disclosures regarding the sales histories and pro-forma revenue contributions of recently-acquired businesses, our analysis 
suggests that Hill-Rom’s acquisitions consistently show top-line contraction immediately following their acquisition by Hill-Rom. At best, this 


may be yet another sign that management struggles to integrate its acquisitions into the broader business. At worst, we fear that this may 
represent evidence of potential sandbagging: depressed revenue among acquired businesses during their first years under Hill-Rom, followed by 
a rapid correction to their historical growth trajectories, would artificially inflate Hill-Rom’s core revenue growth in the first year during which its 


acquisitions are included in organic sales.

Core Growth Inflated By The Underperformance Of 
Acquisitions In Year One?


As discussed, Spruce Point finds that Hill-Rom acquisitions consistently underperform against historical sales figures during their first years as a 
part of the Company. This may simply reflect management’s consistent failure to integrate acquisitions effectively and the resulting destruction of 
value in the acquired businesses. However, if these represent one-time declines in sales growth, we note that the resulting rebound would inflate 


core sales growth in the year following the acquisition. Meanwhile, core growth would not suffer during the first year as a consequence of the 
temporary decline, since, until recently, management removed the contribution of acquired businesses to core revenue growth. Therefore, if 


growth at the acquired business corrected back to its prior trajectory following the year one dip, Hill-Rom would report a temporarily elevated 
core revenue growth rate which would improperly be presented to investors and analysts as reflective of a sustainable, long-term rate of growth.

If the first-year sales declines in Volker and Aspen were indeed just a temporary product of integration, and if they immediately returned to 
their (approximate) previous growth trajectories – perhaps supported by temporarily pent-up demand among customers – Hill-Rom could have 


benefited heavily from one-off accelerations in both businesses. Could management have been spring-loading revenue?

Acquisitions Generating Lower Sales Than 
Advertised


Spruce Point also observes that a number of Hill-Rom’s acquisitions appear to have generated less revenue during their first years under the 
Company than they were said to have generated independently. Again, this could simply reflect management’s apparent struggles to integrate 


and grow acquired businesses. However, we are again concerned that this could reflect spring-loading of year one revenue to improve organic / 
core growth once the acquisition is anniversaried: shifting revenue beyond the anniversary date would superficially increase core revenue growth 


once the acquisition is included in organic sales.


If sales growth rates at these acquired businesses rebounded to their prior trajectories in subsequent years, Hill-Rom would have enjoyed 
artificially higher organic revenue growth during the subsequent years, as it would have been calculated off an artificially lower revenue base.

Management Pretending That It Can Exit 
Business Lines At No Cost


Bulls will defend management’s frequent re-basing as sensible given its ongoing pruning of slower-growth business units: Hill-Rom’s “core 
growth” figure, from this perspective, could more accurately reflect the Company’s underlying growth rate. However, aside from lacking 


transparency, permitting undue management discretion, and allowing for a convenient growth rate re-basing every four quarters, management’s 
practice of preemptively excluding “non-core revenue” from its growth rate calculation suggests that its exits and divestitures come at zero cost. 
This is demonstrably false: Hill-Rom’s divestments and exits are frequently accompanied by asset write-downs, heavy severance costs, and other 
significant restructuring charges. The reality is that Hill-Rom’s true revenue growth cannot mirror management’s “core growth” figure without the 


Company first incurring these sizable exit costs. Management should not advertise its “core growth” figure as representative of Hill-Rom’s true 
underlying growth rate unless it also intends to be up-front about the exit costs which would be required to achieve this growth.


Exiting slow-growth / no-growth businesses is not a costless strategy. Divestments do not occur in a vacuum.


Management should not get credit for a higher “core” growth rate simply because it plans to exit slower-growth businesses.

Purging Underperforming Businesses From 
Reported Sales Growth


Management points analysts and investors to its proprietary “core growth” metric as Hill-Rom’s key measure of top-line growth. Crucially, this 
metric is constructed to exclude business lines of which management plans to divest, but which remain part of the Company. In some instances, 
it has taken more than one year for management to sell or exit contracting businesses which it has earmarked for divestment and removed from 
core growth. In others, Hill-Rom has sold these businesses for effectively nothing, or has exited them at a loss. Why should management have 


unconditional discretion to redefine its revenue base by shifting businesses out of “core growth” at will, even if its ability to exit these businesses 
in a reasonable timeframe is uncertain? Importantly, management has gotten into the practice of shifting new business lines into its “non-core” 
category every four quarters (at least), thereby resetting its sales growth base just as the previous adjustment is anniversaried. We believe that 


this convenient approach to “core” revenue management allows Hill-Rom to present an overly-flattering view of revenue growth.

to remove no-growth and negative-growth acquisitions from its revenue growth calculation before finding a way to monetize them.

Management Frequently Resets Revenue Base 
To Take Credit For Higher Core Sales Growth


Spruce Point believes that management should not get credit for higher sales growth by preemptively removing the to-be-divested business from 
core revenue. For the purposes of calculating an “organic growth” figure, prior-year sales associated with the business unit can be deducted 
from total revenue in the base year once the unit is in fact divested. Until then, however, the business should continue to be reflected in Hill-


Rom’s headline revenue number, despite its potentially negative effect on sales growth.

Frequent Re-Basing Allows Management To 
Report Higher Key Growth Metric


By excluding slower-growth businesses from core revenue, management gives itself the ability to report higher core growth than it otherwise 
would – up to 300 bps higher in some quarters. While management does anticipate exiting or divesting of businesses excluded from non-core 


revenue, Spruce Point believes that investors should not give Hill-Rom full credit for its superficially-inflated core growth metric until the 
divestiture is fully executed and the details are known, particularly since management is consistently forced to exit “non-core” business lines at a 


significant loss.

Management Adjusts Core Growth For M&A 
Only When Convenient


Though we disagree with the philosophy behind and construction of management’s “core growth” figure, we appreciate that management has, 
until now, been honest enough to deduct revenue growth attributable to acquisitions out from core revenue. However, during its recent Q2 FY19 


earnings call, management announced that it will no longer be adjusting core revenue for acquisition-driven sales growth: starting with Hill-
Rom’s recent acquisition of Voalte, sales from acquisitions will be included in core revenue. If the purpose of management’s “core growth” figure 


is to distill Hill-Rom’s underlying growth rate from the effect of recent divestitures – which would otherwise depress sales growth – shouldn’t 
management also deduct the impact of recent acquisitions from core growth? What good is “core revenue growth” – supposedly a measure of 


Hill-Rom’s run-rate sales growth – if management doesn’t back out the impact of inorganic sales? We find it highly suspicious that management 
now adjusts core growth for M&A only when doing so inflates core revenue growth.


Hill-Rom: Q2 FY17 Earnings Call Hill-Rom: Q2 FY19 Earnings Call


“As a reminder, core revenue excludes the impact of businesses 
that we divested or made divest in both the current and prior 
year. It also excludes revenue from Mortara.”


- Steven Strobel – CFO, Hill-Rom


“Good morning. First question. I was just curious, philosophically this idea of core growth clearly, you -- as 
you mentioned you are excluding divestitures non-strategic assets and FX. But presumably, I'm just kind 
of curious the thought process as far as including Voalte. And obviously, it's helpful that you gave the color 
for the updated guidance excluding Voalte. But again, just curious on that core growth first question is, why did 
you exclude -- or why did you include rather Voalte in those numbers?”


- John Hsu – Raymond James


“Thanks for the question. We give a lot of encouragement to keep things as simple as possible with core, non-
core. We felt like for the Voalte contribution, which is pretty small for this year. I mean, we've talked about how 
it's modestly dilutive and from a top line standpoint, it'll deliver a -- some additional growth on the top line this 
year. But we're estimating by 50 basis points, not much more than that. We thought like it was simpler to keep 
it in, given the small contribution, rather than introduce a new set of metrics that would be core, non-
core, organic to core, organic, non-core however you would want to go for it. So we try to keep the 
message as simple as possible. And the -- like we said, the Voalte contribution is small enough that by giving 
you insight into the core revenue growth differences, we thought that was a good compromise.”


- Barbara Bodem – CFO, Hill-Rom


“And John, it's Mary Kay. Non-core also is defined as things that we divested wound down on non-
strategic and Voalte obviously is a strategic acquisition for us, so we didn't feel with that fit into a non-
core definition.”


- Mary Kay Ladone – CVP of Corporate Development, Strategy, and IR, Hill-Rom


How does an inconsistent treatment of M&A “simplify” core revenue? How can management justify this new approach to calculating core 
revenue growth when it adjusted core growth for acquisitions until just recently?


Note that the contribution of 
acquisitions to core growth will now be 


greater than this due to the recent 
addition of Breathe Technologies (and 


any further acquisitions to be 
completed in the near future)

Including M&A In Core Revenue Flatters Key 
Top-Line Growth Metric


By failing to adjust core revenue growth for the impact of acquisitions, we calculate that management was able to add just over 100bps to core 
revenue growth in Q3 FY19. While management did admit that acquisitions contributed approximately 100bps of revenue growth during the 


quarter, we feel that, by failing to adjust core revenue growth for the impact of acquisitions, Hill-Rom is inappropriately attempting to inflate a key 
metric which management knows to be a major focus of the analyst community. There is no good reason not to adjust core growth for M&A.

Management Approach to Rounding Flatters 
Reported Core Growth


Interestingly, by failing to adjust core revenue growth for the impact of acquisitions, management might have improperly inflated core revenue 
growth by two percentage points, despite its claim that its recent Voalte acquisition added just 100bps of growth in Q3. Management reports core 


revenue growth rounded to the nearest percentage point. Therefore, by claiming that Voalte contributed 100bps of growth, management is 
leading investors to believe that, excluding the impact of acquisitions, core growth would have been 5% in Q3. However, Spruce Point calculates 


that core revenue growth was in fact 5.5% in Q3 – rounding up to 6% – and that, without the impact of Voalte, it would have been 4.4% – which 
would, of course, round down to 4% if reported as such. Therefore, by failing to adjust for the impact of Voalte, management was able to report 
core growth of 6% rather than 4% – a significant swing for a key metric which management has trained analysts to use to evaluate the health of 


the business.

Can New Product Sales Sustainably Drive 
Company-Wide Revenue Growth?


Management touts that, taken together, its new products launched since 2015 have been wildly successful and a powerful driver of core revenue 
growth: after contributing $50M in sales in FY16, they rapidly grew to contribute over $300M in FY18, and are reportedly on pace to generate over 
$400M in FY19. It is quick to mention that the Company is set to surpass its original FY20 target of $350M in annual new product revenue – first 
issued in Q4 FY17 – by year-end FY19. To most analysts, this has served as validation that Hill-Rom’s “smart bed” has accelerated the hospital 


bed purchasing cycle, and that its shift away from capital goods has expanded its base of recurring non-capital revenue. To Spruce Point, 
however, it raises two key questions: 1) What does this imply about the performance of the core of the business outside of new product 


launches? and 2) As the immediate growth from new product adoption plateaus, where should we expect Hill-Rom’s run-rate growth to settle?


With Hill-Rom’s planned product launches nearly complete, and with any future rounds of new product launches inevitably lacking key growth 
drivers such as the Centrella smart bed, how will the Company perform once new product sales growth plateaus?

Promotional Stance Regarding Accelerated 
Bed Repurchase Cycle Likely Unrealistic


Among the most significant drivers of new product sales growth has been the Q4 FY17 launch of Hill-Rom’s Centrella “smart bed.” Management 
boasts that Centrella’s embedded patient-monitoring technologies increase patient safety and, accordingly, elevate the hospital bed from a mere 
piece of furniture to a mission-critical piece of hospital room technology. With this, management claims, Centrella has accelerated the hospital 
bed purchasing cycle, as hospitals increasingly treat the hospital bed as a piece of value-added technology which improves patient outcomes. 


Our conversations with industry experts and former employees, however, suggest that hospitals continue to treat beds as a major capital 
expenditure which should generally be replaced as infrequently as possible. They indicate that growth in Hill-Rom’s bed sales following the 


Centrella launch is more likely price-driven or a reflection of one-off purchases among hospitals long overdue for bed replacement.


“Hospitals are generally willing to put off bed purchases if needed. Hill-
Rom is pointing to the Centrella as a big growth driver because they say it 
accelerates the replacement cycle…. This might just be a result of hospitals 
with very old beds – 12, 15 years old – finally being convinced to replace 
them because they want to modernize some of those. But the technology is 
not hugely differentiating. It’s not going to accelerate the purchasing cycle 
over the long-term – this is probably more of a one-time blip.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


Hill-Rom: Q3 FY17 Earnings Call (Aug 4, 2016)


“We are very excited about the potential Centrella has to accelerate the 
med surg bed replacement cycle, particularly during a favorable capital 
spending environment. While still in the early days of the launch, feedback 
from clinicians has been positive, and our backlog is building, including some 
early competitive gains.”


- John Groetelaars – President & CEO, Hill-Rom


Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference (Jun 12, 2018)


“The -- our Med-Surg business is kind of a flattish business. It's a 
replacement business. We've been able to grow a little bit over the last 
couple of years, but we would anticipate accelerated growth via Centrella 
as we shorten the replacement cycle and also take some competitive 
wins over time. So we're anticipating growth in Med-Surg -- in the Med-Surg 
business over the next -- certainly over the back half of this year and into the 
next couple of years.”


- John Groetelaars – President & CEO, Hill-Rom


Independent Opinions on Hospital Bed Purchase Cycle


“It’s not necessarily cost-saving to purchase a high-tech bed with 
patient monitoring capabilities rather than purchase all of the 
components individually. The hospital might want to replace all of those 
components individually rather than have them all installed into the bed.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


“Hospital bed purchases are becoming more price-driven, not tech-
driven. If hospitals are spending more money these days, it’s on pediatric 
care. Most other areas are seeing price pressure. And Stryker is more 
aggressive here – they can furnish a full room with their product set.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


Hill-Rom: Q3 FY18 Earnings Call (Jul 27, 2018)


“Is [Centrella] accelerating the replacement cycle? We actually believe it

normal order sizes by 2x.”

Competitor Commentary: Recent Hospital Bed Sales 
Growth Agnostic To New Product Launches


Industry-wide trends suggest that growth in Hill-Rom’s hospital bed sales may not be attributable to demand for its high-tech beds. Stryker, Hill-
Rom’s largest competitor in the hospital bed space, has, like Hill-Rom, reported strong growth in its capital goods segment of late (and in hospital 


beds in particular). Management points out that this growth has come in spite of the Company not having released new products in the vertical, 
suggesting that it may be a product of a strong cycle or other industry-wide factors. Even then, management did not convey strong confidence in 
the sustainability of cyclical strength to the extent that this growth was largely attributable to industry forces. Importantly, Stryker also reportedly 
intends to release a new hospital bed in the coming quarters, which, to the extent that new products drive growth, could eat into Centrella sales.


“…you obviously mentioned in your beds and stretchers business nice 
performance in the quarter and you made the comment that that was really 
without any new product introductions. So I guess the question is, what do you 
have coming there in 2019? And do you think that we might be at the beginning 
point of a replacement cycle? As I understand, I think the last replacement cycle 
certainly MedSurg was in the 2004, 2005 timeframe.”


- Larry Keusch – Raymond James


Stryker: Q4 FY18 Earnings Call


“Our capital order book is very good. Look at something like beds and stretchers with 
double-digit growth and really without any significant new products. There're a couple of 
minor products, but nothing major. That's really our great execution and I would say fairly 
healthy markets.”


- Kevin Lobo – CEO, Stryker


“Look, the replacement cycle is continuous, so there isn't sort of one 
massive replacement cycle. You have hospitals buying other hospitals that are 
wanting to standardize on their equipment.”


- Kevin Lobo – CEO, Stryker


Stryker: Q4 FY18 Earnings Call


“Congrats on a really nice print here. Kevin, maybe a big-picture question on pipeline. 
Given the strength we're seeing, what would you highlight for us when we look at the 
next year? I know the camera launch and some of the products you spoke about. Is 
there anything on Sage? I think I heard you guys talked about Sage. There was 
some talk about a new bed. Just help us out put these new product cycles in 
the context of a really strong CapEx environment.”


- Vijay Kumar – Evercore ISI


“I would tell you, across the board, whether it's 2019 or looking ahead to 2020, we 
have a number of product launches similar to prior years that are slated. And 
that includes Medical as well as other divisions. So I think that really is what 
underscores our conviction in being able to grow sales at the high end of med tech. 
Don't want to get into specifics around the launches for obvious reasons, but I would 
tell you we have a really good cadence and pipelines across all 3 of the primary 
businesses.”

Hedging Language Regarding Dependence of 
Incremental Growth on New Products?


Since management first promoted this round of new products in Q4 FY17, it has quietly walked back its language regarding the extent to which 
incremental growth relied on new products. When it first issued its long-range plan in Q4 FY17, management claimed that only Centrella-related 
revenue (15-20% of new product sales, per management1) would cannibalize existing sales, implying that the remainder of new product revenue 
would be entirely incremental, and all other revenue attributable to legacy products. Management has since begun to claim that only 50% of new 


product revenue is purely incremental, the rest representing cannibalization. By overstating the prospective incremental sales contribution of 
new products in Q4 FY17, management would have exaggerated the potential upside of new product releases to total sales growth. Alternatively, 
by walking back this figure, management minimizes the extent to which new product sales growth implies contraction in its legacy business, and, 


accordingly, the extent to which plateauing new product growth threatens total revenue growth.

New Product Revenue Contribution: FY16-FY19


Revenue Ex-New Products New Product Revenue


“Just wanted to ask about the new product revenue numbers that you gave…. Within those 
numbers, do you have a sense of how much of that is sort of incremental revenue versus 
how much of that is just cannibalizing or replacing existing product sales?”


- Michael Matson – Needham & Company


“The biggest piece that probably falls into the gray area is Centrella. Back to my earlier 
comment, how much of that is replacement, how much of that is going to drive acceleration 
of CapEx spending in MedSurg, I think, is the question that we want to see a few more 
cards play out before we weigh in on that one. If I look at the rest of the product growth 
from where we are today going forward, most of it is nonreplacement new product 
growth. So of the ones on that slide that was in the LRP deck, Centrella is probably 
the only one that materially falls into the cannibalization bucket, if that helps.”


- John Greisch – President & CEO, Hill-Rom


Hill-Rom: Q4 FY17 Earnings Call
Claim: 80-85% of new product sales are incremental


Hill-Rom: Q4 FY18 Earnings Call
Claim: 50% of new product sales are incremental


“And I think John also mentioned in his opening comments, the new product momentum 
has been -- we're very pleased with that. $300 million this year. We exceeded our goal. If 
you recall, our original goal was about $200 million. So great performance in 2018, and 
now we're expecting $400 million in 2019. So not all of that is incremental. As you 
know, we're cannibalizing some of our products, but about half of it will be 
incremental. And so that's contributing to the acceleration in core revenue growth.”


- Mary Kay Ladone – VP of Investor Relations, Hill-Rom


By now claiming that only 50% of new product growth is 
incremental – and, therefore, that legacy business growth is 


effectively embedded in 50% of new product growth –
management is implicitly claiming that the apparent slowdown 


in the legacy business is not as drastic as it seems.

Core Growth, Total (Reported)


Organic Core Growth, Ex-New Products (50% Cannibalization / 50% Incremental)


Organic Core Growth, Ex-New Products (15% Cannibalization / 85% Incremental)


Anemic Core Growth Outside of New Products


Backing out the incremental contribution of new product sales to Company-wide core revenue growth reveals that growth has been anemic 
outside of new products. If just 15% of new products cannibalize legacy products, and 85% of new product growth is incremental – as 


management suggested in Q4 FY17 – YoY core growth among legacy parts of the business would have averaged -1.5% per quarter through the 
past two years, and would have only barely broken 0% only twice. Even if just 50% of new product growth is incremental, the average YoY core 


growth among legacy parts of the business would rise to only 0.7% over the same period. Either way, a plateau in new product sales growth 
would result in Company-wide organic core growth reverting to the -2% to 1% currently shown by the rest of the business.


Organic Core Growth Ex-New Products are Spruce Point estimates. “Organic” Core Growth excludes the contribution of acquisitions to core growth for the periods 
in which M&A was included in core growth (Q3 FY19).

New Product Revenue Contribution, Est.


New Product Sales Growth Already Plateauing 
Ahead of Difficult Q4 Comp


The implied cadence of new product sales reveals that sequential growth has already plateaued. From management’s statements regarding the 
year-to-date contribution of new products to total revenue, we observe that growth in sales from new products has been roughly flat for two 


straight quarters, and is down from an unexpectedly strong Q4 FY18 which drove it to top $300M for the year after management first guided to 
only “more than $200M.” Management was evasive when asked whether strong new product growth in Q4 FY18 was attributable to lumpy capital 


goods (Centrella) sales, suggesting to us that it in fact was, which will challenge new product sales growth in Q4 FY19. Even after this tough 
comp passes, the slower growth which has been visible on a sequential basis will begin to weigh on annual growth as well, pressuring Company-


wide growth.


Quarterly new product revenue contribution estimates derived from management statements regarding year-to-date new product revenue contribution.


With Hill-Rom already having posted new product revenue of “more than $300M” through Q3, management guidance of “more than $400M” of 
new product revenue for FY19 implies a Q4 new product revenue guide of just ~$90-125M, which would render YoY new product growth flat at 


best for the quarter.

Hill-Rom Set Up For a Q4 Miss Due to Sell-Side’s 
Misunderstanding of Underlying Growth?


Spruce Point estimates that, for Hill-Rom to hit consensus revenue estimates for Q4 FY19 against the recent plateau in new product sales growth, 
the Company would have to produce organic core revenue growth of between 3.4% and 4.1% excluding incremental new product sales, 


depending on the extent to which new product sales growth is incremental (versus cannibalization). This would require Hill-Rom to grow core 
revenue ex-new products at a rate ~200-400 bps above its Q3 rate, and ~300-550 bps above its average core growth rate (ex-new products) 


through the past eight quarters.


Non-Core Sales Contribution and Acquisition Contribution represent consensus estimates


Spruce Point believes that it is highly unlikely that organic core growth excluding new products will grow a whopping 300-650 bps above its 
trailing eight-quarter average in Q4 FY19. We believe that this may put Hill-Rom in a position to miss sell-side estimates for core growth.

Naïve Forecasts Of Steady Growth Set Hill-
Rom Up To Miss Consensus Estimates


Sell-side analysts believe that Hill-Rom will continue to grow core revenue between 4.5% and 6% in Q4 with steady contributions from new 
products, even as the Company comes up against difficult new product comps, and as new product growth plateaus more generally. After 


segregating and analyzing the components of top-line growth in isolation, Spruce Point concludes that these forecasts are far too aggressive: the 
demonstrable deceleration in new product growth will first become visible on an annual basis starting this quarter, when the slowdown will be 


particularly severe due to the difficult Q4 comp. We believe that, even on reasonable base-case assumptions for growth in new products and the 
legacy business, respectively, Hill-Rom should miss consensus core revenue estimates by 2% – a top-line miss the likes of which the Company 


has not seen since Q2 FY16. More aggressive bear-case assumptions imply that the Q4 miss could be as large as 4%.

Where’s The Reinvestment In Future Growth?


Management frequently alludes to plans to reinvest in the business to support new product development and other growth avenues. However, 
both R&D and capex have been flat at best through the past four years, even as core sales have grown at a mid-single-digit rate. Spruce Point 


questions the momentum behind continued growth from new products going forward in light of management’s limited reinvestment in the 
business, particularly with Hill-Rom already two years separated from its key Centrella rollout. We also anticipate that FCF growth may slow as 


the Company is forced to make up for depressed capital spending through the past several years.

Chronic Mis-Forecasting of Capex Has 
Temporarily Inflated Financial Results


Spruce Point observes that Hill-Rom has underspent on capex against its full-year capital spending forecast in seven of the past nine years, and 
is primed to underspend on its FY19 capex projection by an expected $27M, per consensus estimates. Hill-Rom’s chronic underinvestment in its 
own business has accelerated rapidly since the Welch Allyn acquisition: management has spent anywhere from 20-30% less on capex than it first 


projected in each year since FY16. With the Company appearing to have underspent on capex by a cumulative $80M between FY16-18 alone –
expected to rise to close to $110M by year-end FY19 – we are highly skeptical that it can continue to support its recent pace of growth through 


additional product releases or any other means. Rather, we believe that it may have to ramp up capex simply to support its base production 
capacity, in which management appears to have underinvested for upwards of ten years – the stated maximum useful life of its equipment.

Hill-Rom: Planned Full-Year Capex Forecast vs. Realized Year-End Capex


Hill-Rom: FY18 10-K


With the largest component of Hill-Rom’s PP&E 
facing a maximum ten-year useful life – the same 
period over which management appears to have 
delayed capital spending – we believe that the 


Company may be forced to ramp up capital 
spending substantially in the coming years simply 
to support maintenance capex, to say nothing of 


growth capex.

International Not A Promising Route To Long-
Term Growth


Management also claims that near-term efforts to expand into foreign markets will support sales growth going forward. However, with Hill-Rom 
already having made a number of failed attempts to grow its international business, we have little confidence that foreign markets can serve as a 


meaningful growth engine for the Company. European markets have proven to be loyal to local players, and Hill-Rom’s efforts to enter these 
geographies through M&A have historically ended in failure. Former employees and industry experts also express skepticism over Hill-Rom’s 
ability to gain traction in China and other emerging markets, where barriers to entry by foreign players can be high, and where cost pressures 


may limit demand for high-tech, higher-margin beds and medical devices.


“Trumpf was not profitable and was losing market share…. The German 
business is still protective of its own. There was a level of resentment 
[towards Hill-Rom].”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


“The German and European markets were less interested in advanced tech in 
its furniture than it was in being able to furnish the entire hospital room through 
a single supplier. The European business was inherently less profitable.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


“The European businesses [acquired by Hill-Rom] were generally better 
off on their own. They gained access to more geographies through Hill-Rom, 
but they also lost local knowledge with Hill-Rom in control.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


“Do they even have a long-term vision? I joined because it felt like a great team 
atmosphere, but now it feels like it’s every man for himself.”


- Former Employee [Europe-based], Hill-Rom


“It is complicated to shift international supply chains to grow foreign 
sales. Volker lost market share due to the difficulty of shipping from that part of 
the world. Hill-Rom tried to expand it into new markets, but failed, and neglected 
the home market. And countries in Europe favor local brands and 
manufacturing.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


“Hill-Rom wanted to deemphasize pure furniture and push higher-tech products. 
But it’s hard to do that in Europe. Beds in Europe have less IP. They were not 
high-dollar products.”


- Former Employee, Hill-Rom


“OUS is a different sales pitch… Unlike the US, the number of beds in 
emerging markets is increasing. But they are lower-ticket items in these 
areas.”

Organic Core Growth Ex-New Products


Actual Implied Consensus Estimate


Forward-Year Consensus Estimates Far Too 
Aggressive Given New Product Deceleration


Despite the ongoing deceleration in new product sales growth against a backdrop of chronic underspending on capex and R&D, analysts expect 
Hill-Rom to generate organic core revenue growth of 5.6% in FY20 – exactly the same core growth rate which they expect Hill-Rom to generate on 


FY19 by fiscal-year end. Spruce Point believes that, starved for reinvestment and without any new product announcements on the scale of 
Centrella in the pipeline, Hill-Rom is extremely unlikely to maintain its current core growth rate beyond FY19 regardless of any further new 


product announcements at the margin. To achieve Street expectations, Spruce Point estimates that Hill-Rom’s legacy business (e.g. excluding 
new products announced since 2015) would have to grow at ~3% in FY20 – far above its recent average of -1.5% to 1.0%.


Assumes 50% of new product sales growth is incremental, 50% is cannibalization.
New Product Contribution is Spruce Point estimate.


Spruce Point believes that it is highly unlikely that organic core growth excluding new products will grow a whopping 300-650 bps above its 
trailing eight-quarter average in Q4 FY19. We believe that this may put Hill-Rom in a position to miss sell-side estimates for core growth.

New Long-Range Plan Will Disappoint Under More 
Realistic New Product Growth Projections


With management set to announce its new three-year targets on its next earnings call, we believe that the Company may be preparing to re-set 
investor expectations for the business as new product growth begins to plateau. Even assuming that future product releases at the margin can 


support steady new product growth through the coming three years, we believe that analyst targets will be out of Hill-Rom’s reach absent 
extensive M&A or international growth, the latter of which has eluded the Company for over a decade. Notably, management is announcing its 


renewed long-range plan one year early, without having reached the conclusion of its previous three-year plan. We believe that they may be doing 
so in anticipation of missing its targets, and that it may be reissuing long-term guidance now to re-set expectations before disappointing 


investors against its prior long-range guidance.


1. Organic Core Revenue excludes inorganic contributions from acquisitions through the past twelve months
2. Assumes 32.5% of new product revenue cannibalizes / overlaps with existing business, and 67.5% is incremental


Notably, with much of Hill-Rom’s c-suite fairly new to the business, we believe that – with much of its long-term equity incentives locked up for 
several years at least – management has incentive to re-set expectations to manageable targets now, rather than leave investors expecting Hill-


Rom to hit unattainable goals.

Leverage Threatens Future Growth Runway


With sales growth from new products likely to slow through the coming years, Hill-Rom may once again be forced to rely on M&A as its main 
source of revenue growth. However, with the Company currently at 3.9x Net Debt / LTM EBITDA by our EBITDA estimates (materially worse than 


its advertised 3.1x leverage multiple on Company-adjusted EBITDA) just as sales growth from new products is set to decelerate, we question 
management’s ability to continue to support top-line growth through acquisitions – particularly given its non-investment-grade credit rating. This 


holds particularly true as the Company begins to target tech-oriented acquisitions which will naturally command higher purchase multiples: 
Voalte, for example, came in at an expensive 4.5x EV / Sales multiple, and Breathe at an even richer 13.0x.

Acquisition-Fueled Growth Limited By Existing 
Leverage


Management said on its Q3 FY19 earnings call that it considers itself to have leverage capacity up to 4.5x Net Debt / Adj. EBITDA, suggesting that 
Hill-Rom has room to take on at most ~$900M in additional debt. With the Company’s two most recent acquisitions coming in at a ~9x EV / Sales 


multiple on average, Hill-Rom would appear to have capacity to acquire just ~$100M in annual sales, worth only 180bps in growth per year if 
spread over two years. As we expect Hill-Rom to underperform sales growth estimates by ~250bps and ~350bps in FY20 and FY21, respectively, 


we believe that the Company does not have sufficient capacity to make up for slowing organic growth through accelerated M&A.


M&A Capacity Analysis


Spruce Point estimates that, even if management 
were to exhaust its stated M&A capacity, Hill-


Rom would still materially underperform 
consensus top-line growth estimates

Little Force Behind Margin Expansion 
Excluding M&A


Sell-side analysts are also bullish on Hill-Rom’s future opportunities for ongoing margin expansion. Since the Welch Allyn acquisition, Hill-Rom’s 
EBITDA margins have expanded by 200 bps, and management voices confidence that it can continue to improve Company profitability. However, 


Spruce Point finds that, excluding the impact of management’s divestitures of lower-margin businesses and acquisitions of higher-margin 
businesses, Company EBITDA margins have expanded by just 20 bps since FY16. With new product introductions and restructuring efforts 


apparently doing little to improve Company profitability, we question the extent to which margins will continue to expand into the future, 
particularly as management is set to wind down its divestitures within the coming quarters.

estimated from management commentary on margins / EBITDA contribution of recently-exited and recently-acquired businesses.


2. Annual EBITDA impact of acquisitions estimated as of acquisition date. Therefore, gradual margin improvements achieved via synergies, cost-outs, etc. 
would be included in “organic” margin expansion.


Hill-Rom has achieved effectively 
zero margin expansion via 


“organic” means (restructuring, 
cost reduction, price increases,

Consensus Estimates Reflect Unlikely EBITDA 
Margins


Spruce Point estimates that, excluding the impact of remaining expected divestitures, consensus projections reflect 230 bps of “organic” EBITDA 
margin expansion through FY21. Even if management were to acquire another ~$100M of annual revenue via M&A, this would expand EBITDA 


margins by only ~15bps, leaving Hill-Rom to somehow expand EBITDA margins by almost another 200 bps organically by FY21 to meet 
consensus estimates (generously assuming that analysts would not increase margin projections even further following future acquisitions). We 


believe that such margin expansion is unlikely given that Hill-Rom has seen “organic” margin expansion of only ~20 bps since FY16.

Signs Of Aggressive Accounting And 
Financial Practices

Classic Warning Signs Of Underlying Strain


Spruce Point observes that Hill-Rom’s Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) are both as high as they have ever 
been following the Welch Allyn acquisition in late FY15 / early FY16. In the context of sputtering underlying sales growth, we believe that this is 


yet another sign of slowing growth and underlying strain at Hill-Rom, and that it could be an indication that market growth expectations will have 
to correct in the near future as the Company stretches thin its capacity to push forward growth.

Warning: CFO Associated With Companies Demonstrating

Recently-departed CFO Steve Strobel is also Chairman of the Audit 
Committee of Newell Brands (NWL), and has been on its Board since 


2006.


Similar inventory channel accumulation at Newell through the mid-2010s 
would lead to significant difficulties which culminated in an 80% drop in 


NWL shares.
56


Inconsistent Capex Forecasting Always 
Overestimates Final Capex


Spruce Point finds it curious that, as discussed, Hill-Rom’s year-end capex forecast consistently overestimates actual full-year capex. Capex 
guidance is gradually rolled back over the course of the year, but, even then, actual capex always comes in under guidance as of Q3. Why doesn’t 
management give a more transparent view into year-end capex? We find it interesting that, in FY17 in particular, Hill-Rom’s lower-than-expected 
capex allowed the Company to come in-line with its (implied) year-end FCF guidance, even though it missed its OCF guidance by nearly $25M.

Poor Capex Guidance A Leading Indicator 
Of Margin Contraction


Source Reports: AOS, GNTX, CSTE


Spruce Point has made numerous successful short calls on companies in which we have identified poor capex guidance and capital spending 
patterns – notably Gentex (GNTX), Caesarstone (CSTE), and A.O. Smith (AOS). In each of these instances, chronic capex mis-forecasting was a 
leading indicator of future margin, earnings, and free cash flow contraction. We are concerned that Hill-Rom may similarly demonstrate margin 


contraction and slowed FCF growth in coming quarters as management is forced to make up for seemingly-delayed spending on capex and R&D.

Failing To Write-Down Goodwill?


We find it curious that, when management disposed of its third-party rental business for an immaterial return, it made no reference to the 2003 
Mediq deal through which it initially acquired the business – much like it made no reference to Aspen Surgical when it divested of its surgical 


consumables business. While management did take a $20.9M charge on the segment’s non-cash loss reserve and a $3.6M “settlement 
agreement” charge upon selling its assets, it took no further charges as part of the divestiture. However, when Hill-Rom (then Hillenbrand 


Industries) originally acquired Mediq in 2003, it recorded $197M of goodwill as part of the deal, in addition to $69M of intangibles “assigned 
primarily to customer relationship assets” amortized over an undisclosed time period. With the business generating just a fraction of its original 


$166M sales figure at the time of the divestiture, and with Hill-Rom receiving no material return for its assets, why didn’t management take an 
impairment charge on these items?


Hillenbrand Industries: FY04 10-K


“Those -- the businesses that we have been winding down --
we're out of the third-party rental business, we'll be out of third-party 
services business by the end of this year. So the $40 million or so of 
revenue that we had in this year's results for those businesses that 
we're getting out of will basically be nothing next year.”


- Steven Strobel – CFO, Hill-Rom

Time To Write Down The Zombie Brand


We note that Hill-Rom continued to list Mediq on its list of subsidiaries throughout the 2010s, even after the Company appeared to have 
rebranded the business line – and even after its sales contracted to just a fraction of its original levels. In fact, Hill-Rom still lists this entity on its 


subsidiary list as of FY18, even after management exited its third-party rental business and divested of its assets. What justification does 
management have for not killing the Mediq trade name and impairing the remaining intangibles? We believe that a write-down is overdue.


Hill-Rom: FY18 10-K


Management continues to list Mediq on 
its list of subsidiaries as of year-end 
FY18, even after it wound down the 


third-party rental business…


…yet “Mediq” appears almost nowhere 
on Hill-Rom’s website


Hill-Rom Search Result for “Mediq”


10 results reported, but none were actually for Mediq. Term interpreted as misspelling of “medium.”

60


More Overdue Write-Downs?


When Hill-Rom acquired Aspen Surgical for $400M in 2012, it allocated $215M of the purchase price to goodwill and $126M to customer 
relationships with a weighted-average useful life of 13 years. Yet Hill-Rom’s recent divestiture of its surgical consumable products assets netted 
just $170M – less than the Aspen-related goodwill allocation alone. Perhaps this shouldn’t come as a surprise given that related sales appear to 


have contracted from $120M to $100M over the last seven years, despite Hill-Rom having paid a relatively rich 3.3x sales for the business (versus 
its recent surgical products divestiture at 1.7x sales). But why haven’t the remaining intangible assets been written down? The $170M that Hill-
Rom received for its surgical consumable assets is close to the value of the non-goodwill Aspen assets reported at the time of the acquisition 


($186.9M). Spruce Point believes that the Aspen-related goodwill should be written down to reflect the value destroyed by management over the 
last seven years.


HRC: 2012 10-K


As discussed, we find it interesting that management once again avoided citing the name of its divestiture. Spruce Point believes that, once 
investors see more directly that management has exited a business (at a loss) which it acquired just seven years ago, they will better appreciate 


the value which management has destroyed through the Aspen acquisition, and will agree that Hill-Rom must write down related goodwill.

Necessary Write-Downs Posing Risk To 
Shareholders?


Spruce Point is concerned by the fact that Hill-Rom may be carrying goodwill and other intangible assets which are effectively worthless. As 
discussed, we have identified a number of divestitures and business exits for which management appears not to have taken sufficient 


impairments on related intangible assets. We believe that Hill-Rom is currently carrying $507.4M of intangible asset value which, based on the 
Company’s recent divestitures, the return which it received on those asset sales, and the state of the exited business units at the time of 


divestiture, should be written down to zero. Accordingly, we believe that intangible assets totaling 11% of Hill-Rom’s total assets are at risk for 
future impairments and, indeed, should be impaired by management.

Spruce Point would not be surprised if management-defined KPIs such as “core growth” are used by auditors to test goodwill. We are concerned 
that superficially strong core growth, supported by advantageous accounting machinations, may be giving management an excuse to delay 


seemingly-overdue goodwill impairments.


Could Q4 be the time for management to take these write-downs as it potentially prepares to re-set growth expectations with its new Long-Range 
Plan?

Recent Pattern Of Under-Reserving Flatters 
Company Earnings


Spruce Point observes that, despite reported top-line growth, Hill-Rom’s allowances and reserves have decreased almost across the board 
through the past several years. Under-allocating for these reserves, over which management has complete discretionary control, would provide 


an inappropriate boost to Company earnings.

Under-Allocating For Allowance And Reserves 
Providing Material Boost To EPS


Spruce Point finds that, taken together, management’s consistent under-reserving has created $55M in paper earnings since FY15, accounting for 
6% of cumulative EPS over the same timespan. Reversing each of these items to their FY15 levels would result in management wiping out over 


16% of consensus FY19 EPS.

M&A-Related Costs Hidden From Investors


Unfortunately (yet unsurprisingly), management not only fails to be proactive about communicating the costs of its M&A-oriented strategy to 
investors, but goes out of its way to sweep them under the rug. Management’s non-GAAP “adjusted net income” adjusts Company earnings for 
the impact of acquisition-related costs, impairments, severance, restructuring, and the like. Over the last four years, Company adjustments have 
represented over 50% of adjusted income. Yet, because M&A is such a key component of Company strategy, these restructuring and acquisition-


related charges are effectively recurring in nature. Spruce Point strongly believes that companies engaged in consistent M&A should not treat 
these charges as one-off items, and, accordingly, should not adjust them out of non-GAAP earnings.


With Hill-Rom expected to continue to engage in M&A through the foreseeable future, why should investors permit management to continue to 
ignore these costs as irrelevant items?


And why should management be given credit for its inflated “core growth” figure without being transparent about the divestment-related costs 
that it will incur to achieve this level of growth?

Adjusted Earnings Bolstered By Inappropriate 
Add-Backs


Spruce Point observes that acquisition-related charges, acquisition-related amortization, and special charges collectively contribute almost 
exactly as much to adjusted EBT as does GAAP EBT. Further, special charges consist primarily of severance charges (largely tied to divestiture-


related restructuring) and asset impairment charges (also tied to divested assets). With these costs so sizable and consistent – an inevitable 
result of management’s M&A-driven strategy – we believe that investors should not ignore them when evaluating Hill-Rom earnings.

Former Employees Report Numbers-Oriented 
Management, But Lacking Direction


Employees describe Hill-Rom as a micro-managed company with a management team hyper-focused on hitting short-term Wall Street 
expectations. They report that frequent M&A and restructuring, rapid managerial turnover, and a narrow focus on Hill-Rom’s stock price have 


taken a toll on employee morale and the long-term health of the business. In fact, Spruce Point has found a number of employee forums and chat 
rooms dedicated almost exclusively to complaints about management and Company strategy. While it appears that employees have harbored 


similar concerns dating back to the early 2010s, it appears that their complaints have grown even more acute under the recently-appointed 
executive team.

“There have been some OK acquisitions, but very little 
consistency from management, and the execution has 
been poor. But there has been pressure to continue 
to pursue M&A to grow the company for 
shareholders, and to increase comp. There was 
also major pressure to hit quarterly numbers – and 
I felt it. We originally had longer-term financial 
planning – around three to five years. That was 
eventually reduced to fiscal year targets, then to 
quarterly targets, and now to monthly targets

Compensation Targets Are Not Transparent 
And Fail To Disincentivize Poor M&A


Management’s short-term performance bonuses are determined by a mix of revenue (50%), Adjusted EPS (25%), and free cash flow (25%). While 
the Company claims that the revenue, EPS, and FCF figures used to determine executive compensation are adjusted for acquisitions and 
divestitures, its proxy filings provide no reconciliation between the figures reported to investors and those used to measure management 


performance, effectively making it impossible for investors to audit the metrics used to determine executive performance bonuses. Furthermore, 
though these figures are adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and costs associated with “special items” (e.g. asset write-downs) are also added 


back to adjusted EPS and FCF, removing any disincentive that management would otherwise bear for pursuing acquisitions which it is later 
forced to exit.

Accelerated Executive Turnover A Signal That 
Management Is Preparing To Re-Set Expectations?


Hill-Rom’s c-suite has turned over at a break-neck pace through the past two years. Since the middle of 2017 – the year during which 
management began exiting and divesting of failed acquisitions – the Company has lost its CEO, CFO, CIO, and the presidents of two of its three 
business segments. We expect that bulls will argue that this simply reflects a natural “changing of the guard” with the departure of CEO Greisch 
and recent shifts in Company strategy. However, the timing and nature of these exits suggest that this may not be the case. We find it concerning 
that those most knowledgeable about the business and its future plans are choosing to leave the Company (or dump their shares) rather than see 


the shift in strategy to completion. Heavy turnover among management will also not be conducive to the success of this shift in strategy.

Should investors interpret accelerated executive turnover and heavy insider selling as a signal that management is preparing to re-set investor 
expectations for the worse? With much of the executive team having joined only recently – and with much of their equity not set to vest for 


another several years – it may make sense for management to re-set future growth expectations to more reasonable levels, and to take 
seemingly-overdue goodwill impairments sooner rather than later.

Unexpected And Inexplicable Executive Exits


It’s important to note that some of these executive departures were not announced in advance, or otherwise came as a surprise to their Hill-Rom 
colleagues. CFO Steve Strobel (age 60) announced his early retirement from his position on Nov 26, 2018 and had stepped down by Dec 3. Most 
former Hill-Rom employees with whom we spoke were surprised to see him elect for such an early retirement after just four years with Hill-Rom. 
They were also surprised to see Alton Shader – a long-tenured Hill-Rom employee who had served as president of the billion-dollar Front Line 
Care business formed from the Welch Allyn acquisition – depart to become CEO of Vein Clinics of America, a network of vein treatment clinics 


which did just $75M in sales as of 2011. We find the recent departures of relatively longer-tenured executives concerning: perhaps it’s simply part 
of the recent changing of the guard, but the Hill-Rom executive team is now seriously lacking in continuity just as it needs it most.

Long-Tenured Senior Executives Of Acquired 
Businesses Are Quick To Jump Ship


Spruce Point is alarmed by the fact that long-tenured senior executives of acquired businesses consistently leave Hill-Rom soon after being 
acquired. We would interpret low post-acquisition turnover as a sign that the acquired business would continue to be overseen by those who 


know it best, and as a vote of confidence by these experienced executives in Hill-Rom’s ability to manage the business going forward. 
Conversely, we see these quick managerial exits as a sign that these executives are turned off by Hill-Rom’s plans for their respective 


businesses, or as a sign that these executives are skeptical of their business’ ability to succeed under Hill-Rom management. We are not 
surprised to observe these rapid executive departures given Hill-Rom’s poor record of integrating and growing acquired businesses.

Limited Executive Continuity Threatens 
Business Model?


Even with the recent uptick in executive exits, rapid managerial turnover is nothing new at Hill-Rom. Dating back to the tenure of recently-
departed CEO John Greisch, Hill-Rom has seen numerous key executives come and go in as little as under a year. We believe that the lack of 
stability among Hill-Rom leadership reflects the lack of stability in the business: there are few anchors to Company strategy besides the self-


bestowed mandate to pursue perpetual M&A. We expect that bulls will argue that “this time is different”: with a new CEO in place and a  
revamped M&A strategy focused on tech over consumables, Hill-Rom is primed for faster growth and meaningful margin expansion. Spruce 


Point believes that this is just more of the same: more acquisitions targeting loosely-adjacent verticals overseen by a transient executive team 
which treats Hill-Rom more as an M&A platform than a cohesive business.

CFOs With Ties To Struggling Roll-Ups


Both Hill-Rom’s current and former CFO have close ties to other heavily-levered roll-ups which have come under pressure themselves through 
the past several years. Recently-departed Hill-Rom CFO Steve Strobel (who remains with the Company as an advisor) has been a Director of 


Newell Brands (NWL) since 2006, and the Chair of its Audit Committee since 2014. Like Hill-Rom, Newell has aggressively pursued M&A since the 
early 2010s, burdening the company with businesses which failed to perform as anticipated. This has forced management to write down billions 
of dollars of assets ($8.3B in 2018 alone) and to divest of many of the businesses which it had acquired just years earlier – again, much like Hill-


Rom. New CFO Barbara Bodem, meanwhile, was most recently SVP of Finance at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (MNK), the center of a years-long 
controversy regarding its M&A practices and aggressive drug pricing. We do not find these ties reassuring.

CFO Bringing Dubious Reporting Practices To 
Hill-Rom From Another Struggling Roll-Up?


Very few companies report a self-defined “core growth” metric designed to remove the negative impact of divested businesses. Even when they 
do, most limit the excluded segments to business which have already been divested. As noted, we are suspicious of Hill-Rom’s choice to 


excluded not only businesses which it has already divested or exited, but also slow-growing business lines which it intends to exit in the future, 
despite giving investors no clear indication of how it intends to exit these businesses, nor whether it can get anything in return for them 


whatsoever. Concerningly, not only is Newell one of the few public companies to report a “core growth” KPI, but it is the only company other than 
Hill-Rom which we have found to exclude both completed AND planned divestitures from “core growth.” Did recently-departed CFO Steve Strobel 


bring this practice from the struggling Newell to Hill-Rom as a way to present stronger growth in the face of top-line headwinds?


NWL: Q2 FY19 Earnings Press Release


HRC: Q3 FY19 Earnings Presentation Slides


We are concerned that this liberal definition of “core revenue” gives the management teams of struggling companies – particularly multifaceted 
roll-ups like Newell and Hill-Rom – broad discretion to report sales in such a way as to give the appearance of healthy growth despite serious top-


line headwinds


As Newell, unlike Hill-
Rom, adjusts core 


sales for the impact of 
acquisitions, Hill-Rom 


is in fact more
aggressive than Newell 


in its definition and 
calculation of core 


growth

Insiders Aggressively Selling Out Just As 
Management Promotes A Shift In Business Strategy


Just as management announced its intentions to exit underperforming business lines and reorient its M&A strategy in 2017, Hill-Rom insiders 
began to sell shares in droves. We are concerned both by the aggressiveness with which insiders sold shares and with the overwhelming 


asymmetry of insider sells to insider purchases over this period. Why should management expect investors to be confident in its current strategy 
when insiders are seemingly unwilling to stand behind it themselves?

Incorrect View Of Earnings And Value Of 
Intangibles Skews Street Multiple


HRC shares currently trade at a 14.6x LTM EV/EBITDA multiple and a 20.2x LTM P/E multiple on measures of earnings which exclude significant 
acquisition-related costs and other special charges. However, we believe that unadjusted EBITDA and unadjusted earnings are far more accurate 
measures of Hill-Rom’s profitability, as these restructuring and acquisition-related charges are effectively recurring and/or capitalized costs for 
an M&A-driven business such as Hill-Rom. We observe that HRC shares are trading at a 16.9x EV/EBITDA multiple and a 31.9x P/E multiple on 


unadjusted measures of EBITDA and earnings, respectively.

Refusal To Adopt Industry-Standard Performance 
Metrics Complicates Investor Analysis


Analysts and investors currently believe that Hill-Rom shares trade at a 35-40% discount to other med-tech stocks, justified by the Company’s 
relatively slow growth rate versus more tech-oriented peers. However, taking the preceding adjustments into account, we observe that Hill-Rom 


shares trade closer to 10-20% below the peer group average – a justifiable discount given the Company’s relatively slower growth profile.

Sell-Side Estimates And Price Targets Should 
Better Reflect Lukewarm Qualitative Outlook


Sell-side analysts are not exceedingly bullish on the stock: several analysts do, in fact, voice concerns regarding the sustainability of Hill-Rom’s 
sales growth, in addition to frustration with management’s frequent re-basing of core sales growth (“core fatigue,” as it’s amusingly called on 


earnings calls). They nonetheless see ~13% upside in HRC shares as they naively project continued sales growth and margin expansion through 
the coming years at rates similar to what the Company has shown through the recent past. We believe that, as demonstrated throughout this 


report, a closer look at the trajectory of Hill-Rom’s sales growth and margin expansion suggests that both are likely to decelerate in the coming 
quarters and years.
