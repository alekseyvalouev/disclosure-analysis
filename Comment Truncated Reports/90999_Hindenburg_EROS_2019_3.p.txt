Yesterday, Eros’s key Indian operating subsidiary had its credit rating lowered 10 notches


to “default” by CARE ratings, the second largest Indian ratings agency. The issue,


according to CARE was “a slowdown in collection from debtors”.


The default occurred just as we were completing an investigation that sought to explain


precisely why Eros has been persistently unable to collect receivables from its debtors.


After extensive on-the-ground research in India, interviews with multiple former


employees, and a detailed review of Indian private company �lings, we believe the


underlying problem is that a signi�cant portion of Eros’s receivables don’t actually exist.


We have uncovered details of highly irregular related-party transactions. For example,


Eros has directed $153 million to a supposed production company based in tiny o�ce


located in what looks to be a rehabilitated Mumbai slum. The entity is operated by the


brother-in-law of Eros’s Chairman and CEO.


We have also documented what we believe to be multiple undisclosed related-party


transactions that appear designed to hide receivables.


It is hard to imagine Eros’s equity makes it out of this scenario intact. We expect the price


of both the BSE and NYSE stock to end up worthless, barring some sort of bailout from a


friend of Eros’s leadership.

Eros International: On-The-Ground
Research, Employee Interviews, and Private
Company Documents Expose Egregious
Accounting Irregularities


Published on June 7, 2019



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In our opinion, this situation has arisen due to a complete failure of Eros’s auditor, Grant


Thornton, to apply even basic scrutiny to Eros’s �nancials.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of EROS. We


stand to bene�t �nancially if the stock price declines. This report represents our opinion, and we


encourage every reader to do their own due-diligence. Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of


the report.


Introduction: The Market Was Caught O�-Guard by the
Sudden Credit Default of Eros’s Key Operating Subsidiary


The last couple of days has seen a dramatic series of events for Eros, a company that has been


dogged by allegations of accounting irregularities for years (including in several articles written


by us: 1 (https://hindenburgresearch.com/eros-earnings-review-an-abundance-of-red-�ags/), 2


(https://hindenburgresearch.com/eros-international-new-receivables-accounting-red-�ags/)).


India’s second largest credit ratings agency, CARE ratings


(http://www.careratings.com/�ndratings.aspx?cid=bniHSqlzInX2Sp%2f0M2lulQ%3d%3d),


suddenly lowered the rating on Eros’s key Indian operating subsidiary by 10 notches


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-06/bonds-rally-in-india-after-central-bank-


signals-more-rate-cuts) to “Default”, catalyzing a wave of intense selling pressure across Eros’s


entire capital structure.


Eros’s Bombay Stock Exchange-listed subsidiary subsequently cratered


(https://www.bseindia.com/stock-share-price/eros-international-media-ltd/erosmedia/533261/)


limit-down, along with Eros’s unsecured bonds


(https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/retail-bonds/company-


summary/XS1112834608ZZGBPUKCP.html) trading -43%, followed by its NYSE-listed stock


which �nished the day down about 50%.


Eros initially responded to the default news with a morning press release


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190606005449/en/Eros-International-PLC-


Issues-Statement-Announces-Fiscal) stating:


Eros International PLC and all of its subsidiaries have met and continue to meet all


debt service commitments.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The story already shifted by mid-day however when a follow-up press release


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190606005781/en/Eros-International-PLC-


Issues-Clarifying-Statement) acknowledged that its subsidiary was actually late on two loan


payments:


(the subsidiary) was late on two loan interest payments for April and May 2019. These


interest payments total less than $2 million and are currently in process of


remittance.


The release then reiterated the company’s strong cash and liquidity position, although this


seemed to do little to allay investor concerns (the stock remained roughly �at from the time of


announcement until end of day).


The implosion of Eros’s capital structure seems to have caught many market participants o�-


guard. Macquarie analysts covering the stock put out a research note entitled “Hard to Explain


(http://view.remail.macquarie.com/?


qs=eb2e24c33c�0a43b851ad1f2aab03d9987e487fcaf916adb9a093313104bef86278adc418df1

2a55)“, with their best guess being that Eros defaulted due to a “clerical error”.


Introduction: It’s Not Hard to Explain


For us, this unraveling couldn’t have been more expected. We have been tracking Eros’s rapidly


deteriorating �nancial condition closely and were in the process of �nalizing this investigation


which sought to understand these very issues in more depth.


With Eros’s high short-term debt balance, its recent failure to raise an onshore bond


(http://view.remail.macquarie.com/?


qs=eb2e24c33c�0a43b851ad1f2aab03d9987e487fcaf916adb9a093313104bef86278adc418df1

2a55), and its failure to collect on its suspiciously high receivables balance, a liquidity event


seemed to border on inevitable.


The Reason Cited for Default: “A Slowdown in Collection
from Debtors”. Our Explanation: We Think a Signi�cant
Portion of Eros’s Receivables Don’t Actually Exist

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The reasoning cited by CARE for the default rating was a “slowdown in collection from debtors”


which led to cash �ow issues at the company. Per the report synopsis


(http://www.careratings.com/upload/CompanyFiles/PR/Eros%20International%20Media%20Lim


ited-06-05-2019.pdf):


The “slowdown in collection” echoes the criticism of multiple short-sellers over the past several


years (including us) who had identi�ed patterns of suspicious related-party entities and large


amounts of revenue that the company has had persistent di�culty in collecting.


Quite frankly, our belief is that Eros is having a hard time collecting on its receivables and


advances because we think a signi�cant portion of them do not actually exist.


When faced with past questions about revenue and receivables from skeptics Eros chose to


sue them all (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171003005903/en/Eros-


International-Plc-Commences-Legal-Action-Market), including us, alleging a massive “short and


distort” conspiracy. The lawsuit was recently dismissed


(https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?


documentId=e6dTaZ/5upgM8E3xnAbL/Q==&system=prod) against all moving defendants.


About Our Investigation: On the Ground in India, And
Multiple Interviews with Former Employees


Instead of cowering to Eros’s bullying tactics, we instead decided to take our research to the


next level.


In this report, we will share �ndings from our on-the-ground investigation to Mumbai, and from


interviews conducted with multiple former employees globally.

Our primary goal was to learn more about Eros’s mysterious and growing uncollected


receivables balance, which appears to be at the core of its current liquidity situation.


As we will show, we think Eros’s collapse is an egregious failure of its auditors, Grant Thornton,


to apply even basic scrutiny to the company’s �nancial condition. This comes as no surprise: In


the wake of another ‘mysterious’ �nancial collapse at one of its other clients last year, the CEO


of Grant Thornton said (https://www.ft.com/content/f8828dc8-24b0-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632)


(quite infamously):


We are not doing what the market thinks. We are not looking for fraud and we are not


looking at the future and we are not giving a statement that the accounts are


correct…we are not set up to look for fraud.


You can say that again Grant Thornton.


Liquidity Basics: Consistently Negative Free Cash Flow, Low
�88m Cash and Equivalents Balance And �211m of Short-
Term Debt


We will dive into what we believe are accounting irregularities in the reported �nancials, but a


quick analysis of Eros’s reported numbers showed a poor liquidity position as-is:  


Cash and equivalents of $88 million as of last quarter [Pg. 3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152019000127/eps8422.htm)]


Short term debt of $211m (total debt of $294m). [Pg. 3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152019000127/eps8422.htm)]


Weighted average debt yield of ~10.9% (despite about half of the debt being secured.) [Pg.


20


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152019000127/eps8422.htm)]


Historical free cash �ow has generally been negative, owing largely to expenditures on


content outpacing reported net pro�t.

At a glance, a company with high short-term debt, historically negative free cash �ow, and low


available liquidity represents an obvious credit risk. It is for these reasons that a large number


of companies decide to get supply chain �nancial risk mitigation


(https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/). Ultimately, mitigating �nancial risk is all about lowering


the level of risk by eliminating or reducing risk factors that could leave a business in �nancial


ruin.


The Reported Financials Don’t Tell the Full Story. Eros Has
A Long History of Accounting Red Flags


Going one level deeper, Eros has been the subject of multiple historical articles identifying


accounting irregularities (1 (https://seekingalpha.com/article/3621886-unlike-name-investors-


love-eros),2 (https://seekingalpha.com/article/3745326-just-eros),3

upcoming-annual-report/),8 (https://geoinvesting.com/eros-whistle-blower-eros-potential-

receivables balance and consistent lack of positive free cash �ow.

Eros’s days sales outstanding (DSO) indicate that almost a year’s worth of revenue has been


booked but never collected. It is this lack of collection that seems to be contributing to Eros’s


current liquidity meltdown.


(Note that large, growing receivables balances and a consistent lack of positive free cash �ow


generation are two common red �ags often associated with revenue falsi�cation):


(Source: CapIQ)


We will next explore Eros’s relationship with a variety of questionable entities that we believe


are contributing to its current situation.


Exhibit A: Next Gen-Eros Has Made �153 Million Worth of
Net Payments & Advances to This Small Related Party
Entity


Next Gen is one example of a related-party entity that we think Eros may have trouble


“collecting” from.


Next Gen is a �lm production company owned by the brother-in-law of Sunil and Kishore Lulla,


Eros’s Chairman & CEO respectively. [Pg. 98

�lms since 2012 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Gen_Films), all of which were co-produced

dollars only to then co-produce/distribute all of their �lms?

Next Gen: The TOTAL Budget for Films Next Gen Has
Produced in That Same Time Period Was Only �19.3
Million. Where’d the Rest of the Money Go?


Oddly enough, the total budget of the 5 �lms produced in that timeframe amounted to only


about $19.3 million, according to Box O�ce India. (1 (https://boxo�ceindia.com/movie.php?


movieid=1207),2 (https://boxo�ceindia.com/movie.php?movieid=950),3

(https://boxo�ceindia.com/movie.php?movieid=3290),5


(https://boxo�ceindia.com/movie.php?movieid=3563))


Again, these �lms were largely co-produced by Eros which means that Next Gen likely hadn’t


even shouldered all of these production costs itself:

Total 19,350,000


If production costs totaled only $19.3 million, where did the other $133+ million go?


Next Gen also claims to buy and sell catalogue �lm rights, yet its website


(http://nextgen�lms.in/catalog-�lms/) shows no �lms purchased or distributed. This doesn’t


seem to explain the massive amount of money sent into the entity either. It also raises the


same question-why would Eros send money to Next Gen only to buy catalogue �lms from it?

Next Gen’s website (http://nextgen�lms.in/about-ngf/) doesn’t list an address, so we had to dig


through the entity’s Indian private company �lings


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/dAorZDokH4g0Nc) to �nd its headquarters. The address is


listed as ‘6-A/10, Junu Sangeeta Apartment, Santacruz (West), Mumbai.’


The o�ces are located in the Juhu Beach area and, more precisely, in a small enclosed area


called “Sangeeta Apartments”. As the name suggests, and unsurprisingly for the location of a


suspected shell company, the area is largely residential. Here we are at the Sangeeta


Apartment complex on May 4  of this year:

The company is located on the ground �oor of what has been identi�ed by one of our Indian


advisors as an SRA building. SRA stands for “slum rehabilitation authority”, a government


institution in charge of taking slum constructions and, with minimal modi�cations, turning


them into buildings safe for living. This is clear from the photograph, which shows metal bars at


the exterior of the building — typical signs of SRA intervention. 


Our Indian consultant explained that many “dodgy” businesses tend to be located in slums or


former slum locations because the authorities are less likely to check the premises and


interfere with their activities.


We were able to brie�y enter the Next Gen o�ces and accessed what seemed to be the main


area. It was a small room with a desk and a couple of posters. We saw little to no commercial


activity going on at the premises.


Immediately upon entrance, a middle-aged man with a mustache approached us with a


worried and suspicious disposition. This person, as far as we could tell, was the only employee


present during our three visits to the premises, and was unable to communicate in English. Privacy  - Terms

The impression we got from this visit is that of a sham o�ce where little to no real activity is


going on at a location totally unsuitable for movie production; an industry most would


associate with a nice building, well-stocked o�ces, and plenty of high-level employees.


Next Gen: Former Employee Claimed That Next Gen
Channels Money to Lulla Family Members Through
Dummy Production Deals


A 2016 class action lawsuit against Eros included witness testimony alleging that Eros uses Next


Gen as a means of funneling money to the company’s insiders. Per the amended complaint [Pg.


22 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/F4RQhhPoly8Opg)]:


Con�dential Witness (“CW”) 2 is an Indian �lm producer with personal knowledge of


the Company’s business practices in the period immediately leading up to the Class


Period, as a result of his work co-producing �lms with Eros, including at least one �lm


released in 2011. According to CW2, Eros channels money to family members


through dummy production deals.


According to CW2, 30-40% of Eros’s acquisition and production occurs through Next


Gen, owned by Kishore Lulla’s brother-in-law Puja Rajami. Further, according to CW2,


NextGen signs the co-production agreements with EIM, and Eros makes payments to


EIM, which, in turn, makes payments to NextGen to produce the �lms.


Thus, NextGen collects money on �lms but provides no added value, according


to CW2. CW2 also avers that NextGen employees use Eros’s o�ces and do little


other than make a margin on the �lm. CW2 also avers that Lulla’s wife also receives


advances as a producer.


The lawsuit was dismissed, likely due to a lack of additional evidence. In light of our latest


�ndings on Next Gen, however, we view the witness testimony as highly prescient.

Aside from Next Gen, and guided by our interviews with former employees, we explored other


entities related to Eros’s Lulla family for clues to what is happening with Eros’s receivables


balance. As alluded to earlier, we think the reason Eros has been unable to collect on its


receivables is because it may be circulating them through its myriad related-party entities.


Example #1: InfraDigital Technologies-An Undisclosed
Eros Related-Party Entity That Operates Out of the Same
Address as Next Gen


Our research led us to an entity called InfraDigital Technologies that operates out of a di�erent


suite at the same address as Next Gen.


The entity is clearly a related party of Eros. Its two directors are (1) Anand Shankar, Eros’s


�nance controller (http://erosplc.com/?page_id=1350) and (2) Sagar Surender Sadhwani.


(Surender Sadhwani is Eros’s director of Middle East operations and the cousin


(https://erosplc.gcs-web.com/management/surender-sadhwani) of Eros’s Chairman and CEO,


Kishore Lulla and Sunil Lulla.)


Per the latest director’s report (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bm2i84ckEgC2rC) we can see


both the directors and the address:

InfraDigital Technologies: Suspicious Financials- Barely
Any Operating Revenue but Large Borrowings and
Receivables To/From Related Parties


From the latest �nancials (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/AgTPl1LTesf2Q7) for the entity we


see that it generated only about $90,000 USD in operating revenue yet had “Long term


borrowings” and “Long term advances” of about 5x that amount, $427,000 and $482,000


respectively.


The borrowings come from related-parties Next Gen and Eros Labs:


And the advances go right out to related-party Eros Television:

If this is all starting to look very circular it’s likely because it is all very circular.


From the same audit we see that 99.99% of the shares of Infradigital are held by a Singaporean


entity called Eroslabs Pte, revealing that the entity is not part of Eros’s corporate structure:


Singaporean records show that Eroslabs PTE


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Bu2yYN9ZhEbB7a) is directed by the husband of Rishika


Lulla (https://www.news18.com/photogallery/movies/bollywood-stars-at-eros-ceo-kishore-


lullas-daughters-sangeet-ceremony-855536-13.html), who registered his address as a PO Box


based in Dubai.


We wonder, why do Eros’s principles have multiple entities engaging in numerous related party


transactions based out of a small apartment in what appears to be a rehabilitated Mumbai


slum? What legitimate business could be taking place here?


InfraDigital looks to be just one of multiple entities that exhibit similar characteristics.

Example #2: Eros Television-An Entity Based Out of The
Same Registered O�ce as Eros’s Indian Subsidiary, Yet NOT
a Part of Eros’s Corporate Structure.


Eros Television is an entity based out of the same address as Eros’s Indian registered o�ce, yet


which falls outside of Eros’s corporate structure. From the entity’s recent directors report


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CYRhk3fUfIZolr) we see its address:


And from the Eros website (http://erosplc.com/?page_id=365) we see the registered o�ce


matches:


Per the same director’s report (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CYRhk3fUfIZolr) we see that


99% of Eros Television is owned by Emerging Power Singapore


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CNcFIQ1XF�Gwd), another entity directed by the husband


of Rishika Lulla (https://www.news18.com/photogallery/movies/bollywood-stars-at-eros-ceo-


kishore-lullas-daughters-sangeet-ceremony-855536-13.html). The other 1% is owned by Sunil


Lulla.


In other words, this entity falls outside of the Eros corporate structure but is clearly a related


party that exists at Eros’s own address.

Eros Television: Suspicious Financials-Zero Operating
Revenue, Zero Inventory, No Fixed Assets, No Investments,
Yet a Balance Sheet Laden with Large “Advances” and
“Payables” to Related Parties


As we see from its latest audit (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bb6AgK0qBKmru0), Eros


Television has generated zero operating revenue for the prior 2 years, had zero inventory, no


�xed assets, and no investments, yet its balance sheet is laden with large, suspicious advances


and payables:

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bb6AgK0qBKmru0

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We see that the advances largely consist of “advances given for �lm”, suggesting that the entity


lends out a massive amount of capital to procure �lms.


Eros Television: Did Eros Fail to Disclose Related Party
Transactions with This Entity… Again?


As we had noted earlier, Eros sued us in 2017 after we had identi�ed


(https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?


documentId=6n5DXfvi3_PLUS_p71JT9ogi44Q==&system=prod) that the company appeared to


be engaging in undisclosed related-party transactions. We had initially emailed Eros to ask


about such transactions, but rather than respond to our questions they instead �led a lawsuit


against us and dozens of others in an e�ort to silence criticism.


Despite the lawsuit, Eros eventually admitted in its 2017 �nancials that it had taken a $6.4


million loan from Eros Television, one of the very entities we had identi�ed as suspicious. [Pg.


98 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152017000332/eps7429.htm)]


While we were pleased to see that Eros eventually disclosed its dealings with Eros Television in


its 2017 �nancials, we see that no related party transactions with Eros Television were


disclosed in 2018


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1532981/000117152018000361/eps8065.htm):

similarly disclosed no other transactions aside from the 2017 transaction.)


We found this incredibly surprising. We see that Eros Television in fact engaged in plenty of


related party transactions in 2018 according to the entity’s own audit


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bb6AgK0qBKmru0):

As you can see from the above, the large transfers have gone through this entity both to and


from Eros’s subsidiaries and its key individuals.  Aside from this apparent system of advances


and payables we were unable to identify any other operations or purpose for this entity.


We view this as another major failure of Eros’s auditor, Grant Thornton, to monitor an entity


with a documented history of engaging in undisclosed related-party transactions. There is


simply no excuse for this repeated failure.

Eros Television: Our Visit to The Entity’s Auditor, Based
Out of a Tiny O�ce in A Dilapidated Building


Given that Grant Thornton seems to have exercised virtually zero oversight over Eros’s �nancial


controls we sought to see if anyone else was monitoring the situation.


We see from Eros Television’s latest audit


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bb6AgK0qBKmru0) that the entity is audited by a �rm called


R.R. Gawande & Co. The proprietor can be reached by email at either his Hotmail account or his


Yahoo account:


We visited Gawande’s o�ces in May 2019. The o�ce is located in a humble neighborhood in


Mumbai called Goregaon and within a commercial building called “Express Zone”. To enter we


�rst walked past a few cows lounging under a tent at the gate:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
On the inside, the facility was poorly-lit and run-down. Most of the commercial space looked


vacant. 


Gawande’s o�ce was clearly marked with a sign on the second �oor. The o�ce was tiny, barely


enough for a single desk and a table with a mug of co�ee. 


Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
When we entered, Mr. Gawande was sitting with a younger co-worker. Although we entered the


o�ce on the pretense of being a potential client, the sta� was clearly suspicious (they probably


do not get many walk-ins).


Needless to say, the sta�’s disposition and the lack of o�ce infrastructure is not what we would


have expected for an establishment that audits entities associated with Eros and the Lulla


family.


Shortly after our meeting, Mr. Gawande, possibly advised by Eros to behave cautiously with


curious strangers, discontinued all communications with us despite our repeated attempts to


contact him again.


All told, we do not think Gawande is a credible auditor, though he strikes us as a perfect


auditor for an entity with virtually no operations aside from suspect receivables and payables.


The Signs Were There All Along

As early as 2009, Eros’s principles had been credibly accused


(https://gulfnews.com/business/bollywood-embroiled-in-probe-into-movie-money-1.1024731)


of engaging in related-party transactions to help a company in�ate revenue and earnings


following an investigation by audit �rm BDO.


From the article:


A probe has discovered Eros has been used in an apparent e�ort by a Soho-based


special e�ects group to embellish its �nancial results.


Senior company insiders say a con�dential report two years ago by BDO, the


accountant, found a pair of questionable transactions between Eros and Prime Focus,


which is run by Namit Malhotra and best known for its special e�ects work on Avatar.


Prime Focus’ independent auditor disputes BDO’s �ndings.


Insiders at Prime Focus claim the deals arti�cially in�ated the turnover of its London


subsidiary, helping the loss-making operation return to pro�t.


There should be no surprises about what is happening now.

Speaking of ‘now’, the equity bull case for Eros has generally relied on a belief that ErosNow


would be a massive success. In a liquidation scenario, creditors would also want to know what


the value of the platform could be.


In its last earnings release (https://erosplc.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-


details/eros-international-plc-reports-third-quarter-fy-2019-results), Eros touted that ErosNow


reached 15.9 million paying subscribers, an impressive milestone.


Despite the rosy headline, Eros’s accounting around ErosNow revenue looks muddled. Rather


than simply reporting revenue from the platform, last quarter’s release (for example) just


vaguely declared that revenue growth was “fueled primarily by Eros Now” without stating


clearly how much was generated from the platform.


Understanding true usage and adoption is also a challenge based on Eros’s reported numbers.


The “paying subscribers” metric, for example, seems to consist largely of users that have simply


bought new phones that come with pre-paid content bundles. Such numbers say nothing


about usage or user engagement.


The platform’s active users are minimal, according to independent metrics provided by


KalaGato, a service regularly cited by Indian media that tracks over-the-top (OTT) content app


usage and downloads.


According to KalaGato, ErosNow barely registers as a player in the space, ranking 15  with a


market share of about 0.16% as of December 2018.

Google Trends similarly shows that the ErosNow topic


(https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-

that corresponds to their initial marketing campaign


(https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/indias-erosnow-originals-net�ix-launch-809400) to


roll out the platform:


Source: Google Trends


By all measures ErosNow’s usage seems minimal, despite years of company suggestions that


the platform represents the future of Eros.


Conclusion: Eros’s Unraveling Is Like the Obvious Ending
to a Cliché Movie


For those who have followed the Eros saga closely, the latest news looks to be the culmination


of the inevitable:


1. The auditors clearly looked the other way despite years of warning signs.


2. The bankers seemed more interested in generating fees through debt & equity o�erings


than in performing credible underwriting.


3. The complex international structure made it too challenging for regulators to enforce.


Our prediction is that the company will repeatedly attempt to re-assure bond and equity


holders that ‘everything will be �ne and we are well-capitalized’ all the way down.


Good luck and safe investing to all. Privacy  - Terms

LOL!


– The editorial lists the unethical & outright criminal behavior of Eros as a corporate entity. It is


not concerned with Eros’ library of content.


– It is a “genuine working company.” How do you think it got listed on commercial Stock


Exchanges?


But a “genuine working company” does not give you an indication if it functions within legal


framework of corporate law and ethics or NOT.


– How valuable its library is? Who cares? If the company is rotten to the core no one will bother


touching it with a barge pole.


– Why this company cant be a potential take-over target? Because it stinks. And only an


ignorant fool of epic proportions will even bother to look at the catalogue, which being


Bollywood is pretty much borderline Bullshit anyways.

Hi,


Really great research.


But just want to understand more about your thoughts on Eros Now.


Is there any data point to support that most of its paying subscribers consist largely of users


that have simply bought new phones that come with pre-paid content bundles ?


I go through there FY2019 annual report and they de�ne paying subscribers as:
Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
“any subscriber who has made a valid payment to subscribe to a service that includes Eros Now


services as part of a bundle or on a standalone basis, either directly or indirectly through an


OEM or mobile telecom provider in any given month, be it


through a daily, weekly or monthly billing pack, as long as the validity of the pack is for at least


one month.”


And it also mentioned its partnership with OEM as:


“Our OEM partners also include major mobile device manufacturers such as the LG


Corporation and Micromax. Typically, a limited amount of Eros Now’s content library is


available for free, with users able to watch additional content by


paying a subscription fee either directly to us or through the OEM or mobile telecom provider


or by paying a per-use fee for individual movies and programs.”


So my understanding is that people still need to pay to be paying subscriber instead of coming


with new phones?


And I checked Eros Now Youtube channel….there’s ~20mn followers.

I agree the company has lots of issues. But maybe there’s still potential in Eros Now?
