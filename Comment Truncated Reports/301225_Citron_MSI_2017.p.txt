Investors who choose to believe in the false statements
from Motorola Solutions can be as blinded as those who
choose to stare at a solar eclipse.

Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) is on the wrong side of a
mega-trend (LMR to LTE)
The effects of FirstNet will weaken Motorola pricing power


70%+ of the company’s EBITDA is monopoly priced handsets;
increased discounting emerges


The verdict on FirstNet’s acceptance is being rendered daily. Not one state has
opted out, and every day new ones are opting in (15 so far).  The massive cost
savings and disruptive technology advancements are no longer up for discussion. 
Furthermore, the $40 billion commitment from AT&T, funding the national buildout
of mission-critical quality LTE infrastructure, is not open for debate.


This past weekend Barron’s Magazine published a story titled “Static Ahead for
Motorola Solutions“.


This story comes 6 months after Citron criticized Motorola Solutions for abusive
selling practices to the US Government, and using their monopoly position in LMR


MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS
– TOTAL ECLIPSE OF
THE TRUTH

Radio to stifle innovation. Citron’s main point was that Motorola’s companywide
margins and EBITDA are all propped up by inflated US handset pricing (estimated to
have 83% margins, and contribute over 70% of EBITDA).  These radios run on their
proprietary network for Push-to-Talk Land Mobile Radio (LMR), a legacy platform
which benefits Motorola exclusively.


In our first report we suggested that the government might one day put an end to
the price gouging.  That is now irrelevant. Companies can fight off regulation, but it
is impossible to fight off innovation – just ask the old Motorola.


While the writer at Barron’s followed up the story, they missed the pivotal issues
that have emerged from the shadows, illuminating how the case against Motorola is
gaining momentum on a daily basis. Citron explains why Motorola cannot avoid a
margin compression collapse, on its way to $45 near term, and probably lower.


FirstNet is a Megatrend — the most significant change to
first responder communication in over 50 years. It is not
“competition”; it is the foundation of a new platform
which will transform law enforcement and emergency
response.
Investors have failed to take notice that Motorola is on the wrong side of a
Megatrend, which seems to be a corporate tradition identified with the name
Motorola.  First the pager, then the flip phone, and now Land Mobile Radios. While
the trend takes longer than a year to play out, we are already seeing the beginning
of the end.


While Motorola has continued its campaign of misinformation to Wall Street and to
the financial media, FirstNet has gained serious traction in the last six months.
Citron presents proof that Motorola’s dominant position in LMR is fast waning,
eclipsed by FirstNet’s bright and sunny future.


Claim: FirstNet is additive to Motorola’s market position;
it frames income from FirstNet as “purely incremental”.
Sell-side and management claim FirstNet will be “additive” to Motorola Solutions
communications business and that FirstNet will purely be “complementary” to its
monopoly LMR voice network.


Truth: FirstNet is a looming disaster for Motorola
Solutions.
To best illustrate the ongoing eclipse of the truth, it is easiest to look at the
statements of Greg Brown on May 7th, just days before FirstNet and AT&T
published their presentation. On the Q1 conference call, Brown’s spins that FirstNet
is about “data and video”, posturing that First Responders will be carrying two
devices — a Motorola radio for voice, and a smartphone for data. (Guess which one
costs 10x to 20x to deploy….)


”I think I view FirstNet as additive, period, for quite a long time. Its data and
video network for interoperable broadband that will interface with our
narrowband mission-critical communications voice network.”


Yet clearly voice is a day-one feature of FirstNet. No, it is not Mission Critical Push-
to-Talk needed by the highest level of emergency responders, but that is coming
soon as well. Feel misled?  Mr. Brown has a huge incentive to mislead. Read on.

Presentation on FirstNet  [Page 27 of
linked presentation]


The idea of FirstNet as complementary is as foolish as if 10 years ago Motorola
stated, “We think the iPhone will be a great complementary product to our flip
phones, as one is for voice and one is for data”.


First responder technology hasn’t been overhauled in 50 years. FirstNet is
profoundly disruptive to Motorola’s monopoly position with first responders, and is
going to end Motorola’s monopoly pricing stranglehold. Explicit in FirstNet’s mission
statement, from its home page:


We will have the scale and leverage to drive development and procurement
of devices at the best possible prices. Scale can also spur interest from a
number of new vendors, which can enhance vendor/design diversity,
increase competition and help lower prices for public safety devices.


This genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Motorola Solutions spent years and
millions of dollars in lobbying (as disclosed in our first report) to attempt to
minimize the effect of FirstNet. Their efforts became so counterproductive that it
forced Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller to publicly rebuke them for undermining
FirstNet (see source and source).


Motorola:  Please do not insult or lie to Wall Street, pretending FirstNet is a positive
to your business. Not after having spent millions in lobbying over a span of many
years to stifle FirstNet.


In fact, you disclose as an explicit risk factor FirstNet’s intent to reduce handset
prices. See MSI 10-K for 2015 (new language as of Feb 2016)

“Longer term, MSI’s opportunities to sell LTE equipment and related services
in this space will be substantially impacted by: (1) the deployment model
being developed by FirstNet, which has been heading in a direction more
favorable to commercial carriers; (2) the type of procurement process
established by FirstNet; (3) the timing and number of states (if any) that
choose to opt out of FirstNet, and whether the FCC approves their request, as
detailed in the Legislation; (4) FirstNet’s stated intent to reduce handset
prices;…”


Claim: Motorola is a Strong Partner to FirstNet
Truth: No it is not. In its rollout presentation to states,
one name is notably missing from the document:
 Motorola.
Worse, when they present to states literally dozens of candidate handsets, there is
one company that is visibly absent:  Motorola. We see Samsung, iPhone, Kyocera,
LG and others…..but not Motorola.

Read the presentation for yourself.


While Motorola might be producing some software apps for FirstNet, its role
is insignificant and is not expected to add materially to revenues.


Think about this — the most significant change to first responder communications
in the past 50 years and the word “Motorola” is missing from the business plan!

Claim: Demand for LMR is as strong as ever.
Motorola continues to win contracts. FirstNet and new technologies are
not impacting LMR’s market dominance.


Truth: Unprecedented price discounting.
While nothing happens overnight,  we are seeing material trends in purchasing
commitments that show the company is currently pricing for a dramatically
different competitive landscape than it was just one year ago.


In its most recent quarter PR, Motorola highlighted 2 deals:


“Strategic wins and awards:
$43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S. city;


$40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida


Citron has obtained both contracts referenced above (yes, we were able to identify
the $43 million customer) and we see a trend of black clouds looming in investors’
blue skies. Below are the pricing terms from Broward County. In both contracts, we
note a 40% discount offered — which in our review of over 25 Motorola contracts
spanning years, is unprecedented.  When a monopoly lowers prices, it is the
beginning of the end.


Also note that the big discount is pegged to time, rather than volume.  The 40%
discount applies if the equipment is bought within the next 2 years.  This is the first
we have seen a discount this large, and one that is time and not volume incented.


Citron was also able to identify the
$43 million contact as the New York

City Fire Department. Reviewing this
contract also shows us a 40%
discount, which is much greater than
the standard 27% top discount we
have observed historically.


This contract appears to have been
transacted at a 40% discount because
these units were bought in a block.


Of course Citron is not asserting that
FirstNet is going to replace LMR
immediately. Some municipalities will
continue to order LMR products for
years. The question is at what prices
and for how many years. The
overwhelming acceptance of FirstNet by
all the states opting-in answers that
question.


Claim:  FirstNet will never be able to replace LMR for
Mission Critical Push-To-Talk.
This argument seems to be the cornerstone of the competitive moat claimed by
Motorola Solutions regarding its handset business. This IS the entire bull case in
one sentence, that Mission Critical Push-to-Talk (MCPTT) cannot be achieved on an
LTE (FirstNet) network.


Truth: MCPTT on LTE is imminent
Look right past this self-serving rhetoric, and go to the homepage of Kodiak, a

https://kodiakptt.com/ptt-solutions/mcptt-mission-critical-push-to-talk.html
company recently purchased by Motorola Solutions.


AT&T also makes it abundantly clear that it will offer voice push-to-talk functionality
in its early-rollout of FirstNet. This punctures claims from Motorola’s CEO that
FirstNet will not have mission critical voice capabilities for many years to come.
Urgentcomm’s March 2019 availability roadmap of MCPTT is not good news for a
company with a PE of over 23, that depends on a monopoly position in Mission-
Critical-Push-to-Talk.


Claim:  FirstNet is not ready for Prime Time.
This was most recently expressed in the Barron’s article when the MSI
spokesperson tells the writer:


“Because FirstNet is based on the broadband cellular technology in use
today, she contends that it might become overloaded, compromised, or
damaged during major emergencies. Motorola’s systems are highly resilient,
she adds, and have features like instant “push to talk” and the ability to radio
directly to other handsets when tower connections fail”


Truth:  It was the utter interoperability failure of the
Motorola “solution”, the tragic consequences of which
conclusively demonstrated the need for FirstNet.
Motorola’s claim is truly abhorrent, coming from a company that was the backbone
of our nation’s most catastrophic communication breakdown in history, on the
darkest day of the past 50 years, September 11, 2001.


That being said, this year FirstNet’s interoperability was tested, at of all places, The
Super Bowl. And less publicized but no less remarkable than the comeback of the
Patriots, was the breakthrough performance of FirstNet in the nation’s most secure
and visible public gathering.


Here were some of the conclusions of Harris
County and the City of Houston:

https://hclte.harriscountytx.gov/Documents/SBLI%20FirstNet%20AAR%20Final.pdf
The deployment was incredibly successful. In addition to
numerous success stories of arrests, re‐unified children,
medical responses and property seizures, the use of the HCLTE
system and mobile apps provided a variety of operational
benefits – some planned and others unanticipated:


1. Significantly reduced radio traffic


2. Reduced dispatch time through real‐time location services


3. Provided a secured mechanism for sharing sensitive information not
broadcast on the radio


4. Provided improved information sharing across agencies and different
units within those agencies


5. Group messaging allowed for the immediate redistribution of
information


6. Redistribution of original content and sharing of pictures and videos
reduced the amount of  misinformation that happens automatically as
information is passed to numerous individuals


7. Incident Commander (IC) could monitor events in real‐time from any
location


8. Reduced the noise and chaos in the Forward Command Post


Mythbusting the Relentless Misinformation
Campaign from Motorola
FirstNet is the most important advance in first responder communication
over the past 50 years.  Not only does Motorola lack a seat at the table, they
do not seem to know where the table is. It is extraordinary that
urgentcomm.com, the industry source for First Responders issues, feels the



http://www.urgentcomm.com/
need to clear the air with a “Mythbusters”-themed piece to counter
Motorola’s torrent of false objections to FirstNet.


This article is a great reference map to what MSI claims about FirstNet. It is a
classic example of deliberate FUD and innuendo. They never really come out
and say they hate FirstNet; they have recruited others to say it for them.


http://urgentcomm.com/blog/mythbusters-FirstNet-edition


Claim:  The initial Citron report stating that Motorola has
enjoyed a world of sole source bids and egregious
pricing is just plain wrong.
This was the company’s response after the initial Citron report.


Truth:  Instead of defending our own facts and
conclusions, we defer to a recent article about Orange
County:
The Voice of Orange County


“Despite Spending $100 Million, County Hasn’t
Audited Motorola Radio Costs in 15 Years”.
“There has been a lot of frustration I think by this board, from time to time,
about the exclusivity and the sole source with Motorola, and you’re [paying],
you know, $5,000 for a [portable] radio,” Supervisor Todd Spitzer told a
Sheriff’s Department official who oversees the system.


The price of each portable radio, Spitzer said, is “big. It’s dramatic…And you
say, ‘wow, is that the market [price]? Or is that just something you have to do,
because we’re sole-source and we’re completely all-in with Motorola.”


There are numerous examples of outrage expressed by officials in municipalities
over the costs imposed by Motorola’s monopoly. This is just the most recent. So if
your customers think you are raping them with costs, your communication problem
goes way beyond Wall Street.


The numbers do not lie.
Recently we read that the number of LMR licenses has reached an all time low.


The reason for this is simple. Motorola has been selling radios to dog catchers, park

rangers, utility workers, etc. for over 50 years. The smartphone has only been
around for 10. The non-mission critical market is terminal as a business, just as
when Motorola sold pagers to doctors and medical professionals. As we read in the
article linked above:


“… there is a movement to cellular technologies and/or that entities are “just
letting whatever they have now run, and they’re not doing anything to
upgrade or install new systems.”


Claim: MSI management will find a way to make its
numbers.
Truth: Don’t believe everything you read.  Cost cutting is
a notorious tool for simulating organic growth.
While we are not suggesting that MSI is “cooking the books”, it must be noted that
this skill set falls squarely within Greg Brown’s expertise.  His approach to
accounting is extremely aggressive, as he demonstrated at his previous company
Micromuse.


Before his tenure at Motorola, Brown ran Micromuse, from 1999 to 2002. In 2003
Micromuse had to restate their earning for 2000, 2001 and 2002. As stated in the
shareholder lawsuit,  before each quarterly earnings call, and for each of the
quarters that they were at the Company, Defendants Brown, Carney, Allott, Wise,
Luetkemeyer and Kelly, as applicable, would direct Damstetter to look for ways to
inflate or “plug,” Company expenses, to understate earnings and create a “rainy day
fund” to dip into later.


http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1029/MUSEE-
01/200516_r01m_04CV00136.pdf


Considering Brown’s compensation package is closely tethered to MSI’s stock price,
we expect management to pull as many levers as possible to masquerade the
deterioration of their LMR franchise.


CONCLUSION



http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1029/MUSEE-01/200516_r01m_04CV00136.pdf
Wall Street is starting to take notice. Citron readers know that we are always
quick to criticize analysts who refuse to acknowledge the other side of the
story. So we must commend those who do. Andrew Spinola of Wells Fargo, in
his lengthy reports, states one line that eclipses all of the nonsense we read
from others who cover the stock. He states:


“We continue to believe that LTE/FirstNet is likely to be a meaningful
net negative for Motorola’s business as voice transitions to LTE over
time, Networks & Services revenue moves to LTE equipment and
carriers, new competition from the LTE ecosystem enters in Devices”


Wells Fargo has a $63 target on MSI.
We continue to believe MSI will play a materially smaller role in the evolving
public safety market in the medium-term versus its dominant position today
as LTE replaces LMR. It also faces having to start funding pension plan costs
after a pension-contribution afforded it a several year hiatus, and a huge
contract with Great Britain for management of the TETRA network rolls off.
Both of these events hit in 2019.


For all these reasons, it is only a matter of time before the market withdraws
MSI’s high-growth tech stock multiple, and it is repriced for what is left of its
business. Losing handset sales will be the initial blow to MSI and service
revenue will soon follow.
