Cadiz: Strong Sell On Project Failure, Insider Enrichment, And
Bankruptcy, Price Target $0
Apr. 21, 2015 11:46 AM ET
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Public BLM FOIA documents show Cadiz project already effectively failed with
imminent NEPA federal review. Due to hidden appropriations dynamic and balance
sheet, this means the project is impossible.


Even more concerning, serious CDZI investor disclosure questions arise with recent
Water Asset Management capital raise, if lawsuits ensue, instant bankruptcy is a real
possibility.


Governing authority MWD has definitively said they’ve “already made the
determination” and “don’t see how it can be built” while also indicating subsidy
impossibility.


Even ignoring impossible hurdles above, CDZI stock is over valued and project
economics overstated. With cash burn, minimal revenue, project unviability and
$106m of debt maturing soon, bankruptcy is inevitable.


Insiders have collected >$47m in compensation while losing -$359m and diluting
shareholders by 1,600%. Strange related party transactions abound with cash and
stock being granted to insider companies.


"The Truth Will Set You Free"


I believe Cadiz (NASDAQ:CDZI) is worthless while facing imminent project failure,
collapse and bankruptcy.


Due to confused investor euphoria mistaking CDZI as an investment "play on drought and
water!" CDZI market cap is temporarily near a multi-year high, while Cadiz has been
selling stock.


Apparently unknown to CDZI investors though, public BLM FOIA documents forwarded
show me CDZI's project has effectively already failed as their pipeline will not dodge
proper federal environmental review, rendering the project worthless. Feinstein's hidden
appropriations "landmine" apparently prevents BLM from spending time/money on such a
review so CDZI project is stuck in regulatory purgatory where approval is impossible. Even

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3086056-cadiz-strong-sell-on-project-failure-insider-enrichment-and-bankruptcy-price-target-0 2/55


if CDZI dodges appropriations, the multi-year, $20m+ cost, renewed legal opposition and
independent environmental review NEPA process is financially impossible for CDZI to
survive. I believe these BLM documents create questions about CDZI management
investor transparency and disclosure which could result in lawsuits and potentially
immediate bankruptcy if return of recent capital raise is demanded.


Even if CDZI somehow survives the above, governing body and operator of CRA
aqueduct "MWD" has said they, "cannot see how the project gets built" and "they've
already made their determination" while Cadiz's requested subsidies appear off the table
as well. CDZI sued MWD previously costing MWD over $2m and the relationship now
appears contentious while MWD has indicated Cadiz's project will not work with MWD
infrastructure. Brand new CA regulation regarding carcinogenic Chromium found in Cadiz
water, which MWD has definitively said requires expensive treatment, only makes the
relationship and financial stress worse.


Investors also misinterpret a recent OC court decision and Gail Andler's specifically
favorable language for appeals, stating CDZI's lead agency (SMWD) for environmental
permitting was NOT the proper lead agency. If the appeals court further supports this, it
would render CDZI stock worthless overnight.


Furthermore, CDZI stock valuation is completely detached from reality having been driven
to irrational levels from drought-hype. The economics of CDZI's project are impossible and
the project is un- financeable.


Even if none of the issues above concern you, there are serious questions about the
accuracy of CDZI aquifer science, which no independent party seems to agree with, while
CDZI's own well data seemingly indicates current overdraft. If CDZI aquifer recharge and
volume estimates are overstated, the entire project will face immediate shutdown. This
development would financially wipeout investors while embroiling municipalities and water
districts in decades of lawsuits and municipal bankruptcy.

CDZI stock has been a shareholder disaster over time and founded by questionable
British businessman, Keith Brackpool, who was involved in a "spectacular accounting
scandal resembling the Enron Corp affair". CDZI insiders have burned -$350m of
shareholder capital, diluting shareholders by 1,600% (so far), with their "project"
seemingly already twice failed, but have still collected $47m+ in compensation. Even more
concerning, there appears to be multiple related party "side deals" with insider related
companies.


I have never before seen such a leveraged stock with so many separate, uncorrelated,
demonstrable reasons why it is currently worthless. The fact CDZI has no material
revenue, insufficient cash and $106m of near-term debt makes the company even more
hopeless. Similar to CDZI's previous project implosion in 2002, as news of project failure
with inevitable federal review is confirmed, I expect CDZI stock will continue to collapse
right as $34m of senior debt matures in <1 year and cash burn accelerates. I do not
believe CDZI can financially survive this and will go bankrupt

Don't take my opinion though, read the research, ask CA water lawyers with zero
connection to Cadiz what they honestly think and form your own analysis. If you honestly
think this entire report is wrong and you can credibly refute every point while valuing Cadiz
considerably higher than $281m then PLEASE EMAIL ME. I have tried six ways from
Sunday to be generous to Cadiz and I honestly can't find any scenario where this stock
doesn't end up worthless while insiders get (MORE) wealthy.


Quick Background on Cadiz:


Cadiz was founded in 1983 by Keith Brackpool and Mark Liggett. Cadiz, Inc. owns 45k
acres of land in three areas of east San Bernardino County, California. Aside from their
tiny raisin and lemon farm, which appears to lose money with $330k of annual revenue,
Cadiz has been proposing an elaborate water mining project for decades, which seems to
have already been shot down twice.

BLM Decision: Cadiz will require federal NEPA approval = Project Failure and CDZI
Bankruptcy


This is absolutely critical for you to understand as I believe this clearly renders CDZI a
current failure facing imminent bankruptcy, which few investors seem to understand.
Alarmingly, documents obtained by BLM FOIA show CDZI management has already
received clear and blatant language from the BLM indicating their project has
effectively failed as far back as 2012. The documents referenced are all publicly
available easily at low cost and received through a FOIA public records act request
forwarded to me, which are confirmed as available to any interested member of the public.
I also believe what has been uncovered raises serious questions about CDZI
management regarding disclosure issues about whether CDZI management provided
proper transparency and communication to investors.


This section will require an unusual amount of your patience and careful reading, so
please stick with me.


The only viable pipeline option Cadiz has to export water appears to me, an attempted
"end run" to marginalize the BLM & DOI's authority in order to dodge proper NEPA federal
review. The plan is to run the project's enormous water pipeline and infrastructure along
an unrelated 46 mile railroad right of way (ROW) owned by ARZC rail. This proposed
pipeline is necessary to deliver the water to the MWD operated Colorado River Aqueduct
(CRA) for customer delivery and without it the Cadiz project is worthless.

There are two issues I believe are absolutely critical to understand. First, if at any point
CDZI is forced into a "NEPA" federal review, there is a deliberately written "landmine"
hidden in past House Appropriations bills apparently prohibiting the BLM from dedicating
money or time towards reviewing the CDZI issue. This effectively kills the Cadiz project
upon NEPA federal review because the project instantly gets pushed into "regulatory
purgatory" requiring a permit that the government is not allowed to work on.


This "landmine" was initiated in 2011:

It also seems the BLM has been very clear what this means:


(2012-6/27 FOIA obtained BLM Cadiz briefing paper)


Even if somehow CDZI can navigate around this appropriations wall (no way) then CDZI is
still dead anyway. CDZI has just $16m in cash with -$10m estimated annual losses and
$35m in debt maturing next year. There is obviously no way CDZI will survive the
expensive and drawn out nature of federal reviews which typically take many years and
cost tens of millions of dollars while "resetting the clock" for environmental and Tetra Tech
legal opposition, which will drag out into eternity.


The second dynamic to understand is how I believe CDZI was trying to dodge this "game
over" federal review.


CDZI Failure Context and Background


Railroads historically had considerable leeway regarding what they could do on Right of
Ways (ROWs) and even though they operate on public land belonging to the federal
government, railroads had virtually zero permitting, environmental review or accountability.
This created problems as railways increasingly pushed the limits of the law by putting
clearly unrelated assets and businesses along these ROWs while environmental
standards have increased exponentially.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3086056-cadiz-strong-sell-on-project-failure-insider-enrichment-and-bankruptcy-price-target-0 7/55


This changed with a transformational "M-decision" of 2011, tellingly driven as a direct
response to Cadiz.


(Credit BLM documents)


What this "M decision" did was give the BLM unrestricted decision making ability, on a
case-by-case basis, to decide what is reasonable to allow on federal ROW without federal
review. Even more critical, if there are any doubts about a ROW then the decision must
be resolved in favor of the federal government (ie: requires review).


Since this law was changed in direct response to Cadiz's attempted ROW water pipeline,
what do you think that means regarding how the Cadiz decision was going to go?


With this in mind, the publicly available FOIA'd BLM communications show some
interesting commentary which seems to obviously demonstrate CDZI failed to show,
without doubts, the CDZI project WILL require federal review which pushes the project into
the regulatory purgatory explained above while CDZI lacks financial ability to survive this
process anyway.


(2012-7/24 FOIA obtained BLM Cadiz briefing paper)


And then goes on to further explain any statement claiming any statement claiming BLM
approval is not required is not accurate (obviously meaning BLM approval is required):

In case you think I am biased and this is some one-off document, or perhaps Cadiz CEO
Scott Slater was unaware, let me show you more BLM public documents obtained through
FOIA request.


In 2013-3/26 it appears CDZI requested a few of their supporters to try and go around the
BLM and appeal to the federal DOI on this dispute:


(Publicly available BLM documents)


Further supporting my point CDZI knew they had not proven their case to the BLM, we
have this 2013-07/12 letter from CDZI CEO Scott Slater protesting to the BLM on this
topic where he apparently acknowledges the insurmountable disaster.


(Publicly available BLM document)


Even more telling, in this letter CDZI CEO Scott Slater even seems to confirm the primary
"driving" purpose of the CDZI pipeline is to convey water to the CRA (ie: the pipeline does
not originate from any ARZC need for water! and not there to convey water to ARZC)

It seems irrefutable to me CDZI failed in their case to prove to the BLM and the public that
they should not be required to face a proper federal review. and that the CDZI team with
CEO Scott Slater has known the true nature of this since at least 2012.


Has Cadiz properly communicated this interaction to investors?


Why Did CDZI Even Waste Shareholder Money on This Obvious Failure?


To further expand on how obvious this disaster is though, let's dig deeper:


This all began in 2008 when Cadiz inked their lease with Arizona & California Railroad
(ARZC) to use the ROW for the pipeline. Notably, there was only a single mention of water
use in the entire 30+ page lease document, represented by this clause below (note use of
singular context).


(Cadiz Inc. 2008 ARCZ Lease publicly available by FOIA)


All seems quiet until the BLM overturns the old ROW law with the solicitors "M opinion"
discussed above on 2011-11/4, giving BLM authority on case-by-case basis to determine
what requires federal approval. Then…..what do you know! "Coincidentally" on 2011-12
CDZI & ARZC rail ink an "amendment" about the rail's sudden urgent theoretical need for
fire suppression water needs in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Comically, this has
literally never (EVER) happened!


(from publicly available BLM CDZI communication documents)


Furthermore, ARZC has been replacing(1) old wooden trestles with steel and concrete
which don't burn anyway. ARZC seems to have been doing this across all tracks and, as
evidence this prevents fire risk, ARZC doesn't even seem to be proposing water hydrants
at the concrete trestles. Clearly comparing CDZI project to the cost of ARZC constructing
their own water system is ridiculous because ARZC has not chosen that as their fire
prevention option.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3086056-cadiz-strong-sell-on-project-failure-insider-enrichment-and-bankruptcy-price-target-0 10/55


Furthermore, what CDZI is proposing is clearly not industry standard. The Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) has confirmed the "…FRA is unaware of any cases where
fire hydrants have been placed along tracks for use in fire fights." 2 While "no known
railroad has strings of hydrants along its en-route lines." Lastly, San Bernadino fire
department says current access roads are sufficient for their rapid response. Oil and
petroleum products are often not effectively extinguished with water anyway, as dry
chemical fire suppression is commonly used while chemical foams have been used for
decades with oil and gas fires.


Even more absurd, CDZI will not even be operating year round and so immediate, reliable
fire protection will not even be available!


Surrreeee this pipeline originates from ARZC's fire suppression needs…


We can also see ARZC has already replaced nearly all wood trestles on the south end of
their railway. If this water pipeline were truly for trestle fire suppression they would
obviously stop the water pipeline at the last wooden trestle 2/3 of the way down, or
perhaps sooner given they've never had a trestle fire and odds of that lone southern
trestle catching fire are ~0%.

Apparently, in an embarrassing "last ditch hail Mary" to justify water use in rail operations,
Scott Slater proposed the ridiculous and transparent notion of building a small steam train
in the desert, which a former manager of rail lines in five states quickly pointed out, makes
no sense.

(I think you're embarrassing yourself, Scott.)


One letter to the BLM explained the steam train as such:


As CDZI goes through federal review now it will be interesting from an honesty stand point
to see if CDZI still builds and operate this absurd steam train.


If we actually look at federal clarification on legal language surrounding M opinion it
becomes even more obvious how dead CDZI truly is:

(From public BLM documents)


One thing to note is any issue with doubt is to be resolved in favor of the federal
government (i.e., requires full review). I also note it is the burden of the applicant to dispel
doubts, and most importantly note the use of the words "extent", "originates from",
"promotes" and commentary about railroad purpose "driving" the design of activity.


Since we know "extent" and rail needs "driving" design are key issues, let's discuss what
that means. CDZI has said they are trying to pump a maximum of 75k acre feet per year,
this is 16.2 BILLION gallons per year. We also know ARZC "may" need "up to" 10k
gallons, for potential rail needs of 0.0225% of the project. It's estimated independent fire
suppression on ARZC's rail would cost ~$10m but CDZI has said their project will cost
$277m just for phase 1 with $211m of that just for the pipeline. If we include phase 1 and
phase 2 then total project cost is $535m. This means ARZC's fire suppression component
of the Cadiz project makes up between 1.87% and 4.52% of project cost. We also know
despite ARZC "urgent" claims, they are only trying to put in this water system for 43 miles
of their track, which is barely 16% of their total track. Tellingly, CDZI's own water project
presentations mention almost nothing about the railway or its needs.


I think it is beyond argument there is zero way the "extent" of water pipeline benefit to
ARZC is material or that it "originates" from the rail line or it "promotes" rail way operations
or the pipeline construction is "driven" by ARZC rail needs. It seems common sense any
argument that a 7' diameter, $211m pipeline design is driven by fire hydrant needs is
absurd:

(public NPC letter)


Just stepping back to think about this with common sense while looking at the obvious
intent of the law, this whole CDZI pipeline fiasco is ridiculous. When congress granted rail
ROWs back in the 1800s they granted them to foster the growth of critical rail industry
across America. They did not grant ROWs so private companies could run amok with non-
rail business on public land. Only through the generosity of America does ARZC even
have access to this public ROW land at all and to think they believe they should be able to
do whatever they want, without accountability, is ludicrous.


If we go back even before the M decision it is blatantly clear the intent of the ROWs was
for rail operations as the law was only written to provide for rail assets, not for private
companies to stretch the law of America to do their bidding without accountability. Note
language about buildings that a rail company might have put up:


Obviously no railroad company would build a $211m water pipeline on their own.


Furthermore, thinly veiled legal threats of lawsuit to BLM will only cement the future and
comparing ARZC's tiny trestles to the enormous wooden bridges of east coast rails is
clearly not relevant. The only thing less relevant is comparing fiber optic projects laid prior
to the M decision which are not even vaguely similar to an enormous 7 FOOT diameter
pipeline and access road right next to one of the largest national parks in America. If we
ever see CDZI actually go out and literally sue the BLM we can be sure the CDZI project
is finally dead and only a matter of time before their stock goes to $0.

This Cadiz project should be held to only the highest standards as this enormous, earth
changing project will set critical precedent for potentially hundreds of years to come. If any
company can put a $250-500m+ project along any federal ROW without federal approval,
what's stopping every fracking and oil company in the US from building enormous 7 foot
diameter pipelines crisscrossing the public's federal land? If the train uses 0.001% of the
oil then it must be fine right!? Maybe even the oil company could pay the train company
enormous cash rent to "motivate cooperation" and the American public interest can just be
completely corrupted and ruined. Obviously this makes zero sense and millions of citizens
nationwide are watching closely.


On a side note I find it very interesting the rent numbers CDZI has paid ARZC are
redacted from the lease agreements from the BLM. If Cadiz redacted those, why would
water pipeline rent built for rail water use need to be kept secret unless CDZI was paying
a surprisingly enormous amount of cash for ARZC's cooperation that is not in line with
industry standards?


The only other pipeline option CDZI has is so clearly unviable as to be not worth
mentioning and CDZI is not actively pursuing it anyway, likely because the BLM has
already told CDZI it is worthless due to necessary federal review. This pipeline is a re-
purposed Kinder Morgan pipeline previously used for oil which is estimated to be capable
of transporting 20k acre feet (AF) of water per year and runs 96 miles to nearby city of
Barstow. Any re-purposing of this pipeline would require extensive NEPA federal review
and I seriously doubt MWD would be comfortable with the PR nightmare of pumping water
through a 15+ year old oil pipeline into the public's drinking water.

There are numerous reasons this pipeline is not viable including: the pipeline could carry
less than half of Cadiz proposed 50-75k af per year production, this pipeline is twice the
distance of the other pipeline (driving enormous cost increase), and the pipeline is
traversing some much more populated and residential, sensitive areas effectively making
federal review impossibly long and expensive. All of this is irrelevant though because the
BLM has told CDZI they are prohibited from even working on it anyway, rendering it
worthless:

ROW case and CDZI management have been aware of this dispute for years. Thus the
project is stuck between a.) Appropriations limits forcing the project into regulatory
purgatory where required government review is prohibited, and b.) an impossibly
expensive and drawn out federal review which CDZI cannot afford.


In other words, Cadiz stock is worthless.


Where I think the story gets really interesting though is around the latest capital raise
CDZI somehow pulled off with Water Asset Management LLC. I believe the clear and
concise BLM language about project failure raises serious questions about CDZI
management credibility and proper disclosure.


Didn't Water Fund Just Gave Cadiz $12.2m Worth of Cash?! Serious Questions
Begin…


Cadiz only has two institutional investors of note and Cadiz just sold $16m worth of stock
in a deal lead by their now largest shareholder "Water Asset Management LLC".


Given what we have seen above with Cadiz obviously having effectively failed to support
their ROW case with the BLM and avoid NEPA review, I see only three explanations for
Water Asset Management's involvement in this latest CDZI capital raise.


1. Water Asset Management did NOT know what is going on here, did not communicate
with CDZI management and made an obviously bad, avoidable investment decision.


2. Water Asset Management knew what was going on, ignored this fatal risk and possibly
breached their fiduciary duty.


3. Water Asset Management relied on Cadiz management commentary and are possibly
feeling misled right about now.


If proper disclosure was given to Water Asset, why on earth would they provide $12m to a
company with nearly zero revenue and a bunch of debt facing an impossible legal wall?
While I do not know exactly what happened, I think actions here speak loudly as to how
this went down and I would not be surprised to see legal action result.


If Water Asset relied on Cadiz management, what are the risks to current CDZI
shareholders? Could Water Asset Management sue and demand their $12.2m back
before CDZI burns through it and goes bankrupt? Did CDZI openly provide to Water Asset
Management all of the easily available BLM letters I've referenced above? If they did not,
why is that?

Was Disque Deane, Jr. (Founder of Water Asset Management) Given Proper
Disclosure?


(Picture credit WAM, LLC website)


This is certainly not a risk or a situation I would want to be invested in. Given the issues
above (and even worse problems you'll learn about below), along with the extremely
specialized nature of the situation, I find it hard to imagine Water Asset Management hired
truly independent expert CA water lawyers with zero connection to Cadiz or CEO Scott
Slater. If they had hired truly independent CA water lawyers, then why did Water Asset
Management not have these BLM documents?


Given I think Water Asset are in over their heads, now owning $23m of obviously
worthless CDZI stock which is without credible management , I recommend Water Asset
Management immediately hire at least two separate, independent CA water focused law
firms with zero connection to Cadiz (or any of the people involved) and ask them behind
closed doors what the probability of Cadiz ever generating economic revenue is. I believe
what they'll find is Cadiz is the laughing stock of CA water law where everyone knows this
thing is a worthless mess and I'd be surprised if some of those CA water lawyers aren't
short CDZI stock in their own accounts.


When investing in capital-desperate, speculative microcaps, it is imperative you do not
trust management but truly verify what they say with 100% independent experts. That's
especially true of management teams burning through hundreds of millions of dollars of
shareholder money and with questionable history.


Even more concerning, when I read the BLM communication in time sequence it seems
obvious to me CDZI repeatedly tried to change or adapt their project as they received
BLM responses, which seems to me to have caused delays. My understanding is this is

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3086056-cadiz-strong-sell-on-project-failure-insider-enrichment-and-bankruptcy-price-target-0 19/55


not how that process is designed as this is not supposed to be an iterative process with
the BLM. How could CDZI possibly still be making changes to the project design 2014-
10/17, literally 6 years after the original lease was signed in 2008 and amended in 2011?!


(publicly available BLM and CDZI communication documents)


I also was surprised by the amount of apparent delays on CDZI's side in regards to
seemingly urgent communication from the BLM. From what I can tell, very rarely did CDZI
respond swiftly even to seemingly simple questions and given many of these delays
occurred in late 2014 (and CDZI was still apparently trying to change their project design
as recently as 2014-10/17) I find it "interesting" that CDZI raised $16m in cash from
investors over this same time frame things were "delayed" on 2014-11/10. What would
have happened to Cadiz's capital raise had a swift BLM decision occurred in 2014?


I find Odey Asset Management's involvement in Cadiz curious too. Cadiz has been a
revolving door of random UK funds in the past and Odey manages $10B+ in aum, so I
speculate they probably have some connection to Brackpool and have made a tiny bet
(0.23% of capital) on a "water play" without doing the real work necessary to truly
understand the critical, ground level dynamics deciding CDZI's future. In my opinion, it is
highly likely none of Cadiz's anchor investors have any idea what is really happening with
this company / stock.


MET Already Made Their Determination, Don't See How It Can Be built = Cadiz
Project Worthless


Even if everything else was perfect for CDZI, the problems with the MET alone renders
Cadiz project and stock totally worthless.


Metropolitan Water District's (often called MWD or the "MET") approval and cooperation is
absolutely required for Cadiz's project to ever be remotely viable. The MET operates the
Colorado River Aqueduct (CRA) which Cadiz must connect to in order to sell a drop of

water. It is important to note the MET already voted against the Cadiz project, nearly killing
it permanently, back in 2002.


What is important to note is after CDZI originally failed, and nearly went bankrupt, Cadiz
desperately sued the MET for not moving forward with the failed project. Eventually
Cadiz's lawsuit was dismissed with no possibility of appeal but not before it cost MET and
California ratepayers an estimated $2m+ in legal bills. Suing the overarching regulatory
body responsible for authorizing your only project seems like an obviously stupid idea.
This was an extremely contentious lawsuit that offended many and created a negative
relationship between Cadiz and MET.


As we can see from their blatant and crystal clear words (and actions), MET appears to
me to clearly have zero interest in participating, approving, or cooperating with the Cadiz
project. As you read what follows, keep in mind how conservative and soft-spoken
government organizations like the MET typically are when speaking publicly.

In case direct and recent quotes above aren't convincing enough, there are countless
other recent comments from the MET which should dispel your confusion. While here we
can see MET telling the public the project is not possible financially or politically:


"I don't see how politically it gets done. And financially I don't see how this water pencils
out."


MWD Also Shoots Down Cadiz Subsidies with Cadiz Project Design "Not Feasible"


Even more worrisome, John Foley, ex-Chairman of the MWD (was likely the most tenured
individual in all of CA water) seems to think agency subsidies Cadiz relies on are not
reasonable. While "skepticism on the MWD board runs high" for years, John Foley has
questioned Cadiz river credit subsidy requests stating:


"It's a little stretch of the imagination. It was never intended to work that way."


While explaining local water source development and recycling project subsidies Cadiz
has referenced:


"the Cadiz project is 200 miles east of the MWD's coastal service area. "It's not really a
local project," Foley said. "I would think that would have a difficult time getting through
the board.""


Even if ever allowed to hook up to MWD's aqueduct, the Cadiz project relies on consistent
and reliable aqueduct access. The problem however is the MWD has repeatedly said they
do not think this is possible:


"Metropolitan has also informed Cadiz that the aqueduct space the company is counting
on may not always be available, especially during dry years when demand for the Cadiz
water would likely be the greatest."


And with clear frustration GM of MWD Kightlinger explains:


"That's just something they need to understand."

Scott Slater seems to ignore these comments but the MWD has made their stance
abundantly clear, in comments to Cadiz's DEIR they state unequivocally


(Cadiz DEIR comment letter)


And there may even be full yearS (multiple) where the aqueduct (NASDAQ:CRA) is totally
unavailable for Cadiz water:


(Credit MWD response in Cadiz EIR)


For a 50 year project where nobody can predict the future, this seems like a potential
disaster. Furthermore, considering the economics of the Cadiz project are already
unviable, introducing great long-term revenue uncertainty and volatility will only serve to
drive up financing costs (if possible at all) and decrease reliability to customers, not to
mention render CDZI's capital structure completely untenable.


Amazingly, it gets worse for Cadiz as we can see the MWD's recent formal actions
towards Cadiz speak even louder than their words. Go look up the full 1,668 page Cadiz
Final Environmental Impact Report with response comments (I'll wait…. and if you don't
have this handy then clearly you should not be invested in CDZI). Go to page 102 where
the MWD's formal response to the Cadiz project starts. You will find literally 58 pages of
highlighted issues, concerns and revisions in their response with literally hundreds of
critical comments and disagreements from the MWD. I don't see how any reasonable
fiduciary could read that and believe MWD is interested in cooperating with CDZI.

For brevity's sake I will let you look these up but, in addition to hundreds of other issues
raised by MWD in response to CDZI's DEIR, it seems the fundamental construction of
Cadiz's project is unacceptable to the MWD and cannot be integrated into the aqueduct.
See the following comments Cadiz investors seem to be unaware of:


(Credit MWD response in Cadiz EIR)


Aside from the BLM, the MWD is the most important regulatory organization necessary for
Cadiz while the MWD have called Cadiz a "nightmare scenario" where they "financially
don't see how this water pencils out" and "don't see how it can be built" while stating
clearly Cadiz requested subsidies are not reasonable.


Cadiz has created an adversarial relationship with the MWD through a history of Cadiz
initiated legal action costing the MWD and CA ratepayers millions of dollars.
Unsurprisingly the MWD seems to have generated as much criticism and opposition as
possible highlighting fundamental issues making Cadiz connection to CRA impossible.
Everybody outside Wall Street knows this and OC themselves have said the relationship is
"tolerant at best". Without open and reliable access to the MWD's aqueduct, the Cadiz
project is totally worthless and if CDZI thinks they can boss around the MWD again with
lawsuits, I think they are in for even more disaster.


Given just the above, I don't see how any reasonable fiduciary could possibly think the
MWD will do anything but deny and fight this project until it is bankrupt and gone forever.
No matter what anyone tells you, there is zero legal reason the MWD has to accept or
integrate Cadiz's project. Furthermore, there is no reason MWD can't just keep asking for
more and more until CDZI goes bankrupt or the requests make the project impossible.

Not to beat a dead horse, but if you just read the full MWD letter of denial regarding the
CDZI project back in 2002 (go read the full document now), it seems obvious to me all
issues raised have gotten worse:


(Quote above credit to MWD original Cadiz decision)


Far as I can tell uncertainty is higher now, groundwater monitoring and management plan
is less stringent and less effective, compliance costs in CRA have increased, project cost
has increased dramatically, MWD will not give Cadiz guaranteed CRA availability and
Cadiz has even more bankruptcy risk. I think it is beyond obvious the MWD will never.
Ever. Ever. approve this absurd project.


If all the other issues between Cadiz and the MWD weren't enough, the MWD has also
clearly expressed (repeatedly) the Chromium levels in Cadiz water are unacceptable.
MWD GM Mr. Knightlinger has been quoted as saying back in 2012 "having some

chromium 6 in our water could be detriment to some of our folks" stating they need to "see
what the final standard is". Well, the CA final standard was just announced and Cadiz
water chromium levels are 40% to 800% above what is acceptable.


Cadiz Water Chromium Levels Far Exceed New California State Regulation
Maximum


It is well known Cadiz water contain high levels of chemicals including Chromium, a
cancerous carcinogen made famous in the San Bernadino movie, Erin Brockovich, while
others have raised concerns about arsenic in Cadiz water.


This had previously been a side issue for Cadiz, but has now evolved into an impossible
hurdle, as just a few months ago, California passed sweeping state-wide legislation
putting legal limits on allowable Chromium in drinking water at 0.10 ppm, making Cadiz's
chromium levels of 0.14-0.16 a full 40-60% above the legal limits and 800% above CA
suggested public health goal of 0.02 ppm.


(Picture credit Erin Brockovich movie)


Cadiz tells investors the MWD should allow them to dilute their excess Chromium levels
into cleaner CRA water to get blended Chromium levels within an acceptable range. CDZI
CEO Scott Slater said treatment alone could cost $400 af annually, with a curious recent
"flip flop" in investor presentations now claiming treatment could be done for $60 af. I don't
see how this is based in reality given no large scale chromium treatment plant in the world
I could find operates anywhere close to that cost.

The MWD has clearly said publicly, repeatedly, that diluting the Chromium into their water
is an absurd proposition they are not interested in, calling it a "nightmare scenario" stating
"they're going to have to treat it". We can see, without question, the MWD is going to
require treatment from their response to the Cadiz DEIR:


(Picture credit MWD comment letter to CDZI DEIR)


If the Cadiz water were ever to be allowed in the CRA (won't happen) it would clearly
require pre-treatment. There will be two components of Cadiz water treatment:
construction cost to build the treatment plant and annual operating expense to run the
plant and clean the water.


An important question is how much treatment will be required and I believe it is obvious
the MWD will require any chromium or arsenic in Cadiz water be reduced to at least within
CA state regulated levels before allowing it to be mixed into public drinking water. The
problem for CDZI shareholders is water treatment plants are incredibly expensive and
energy intensive. This water treatment plant in San Jose cost $72m to build and is
capable of purifying just <10k acre feet per year, for a capital cost of $8k per 1 acre foot of
annual purification capacity. This chromium and carcinogen purification plant in Los
Angeles is estimated to cost $700m to build, or $164k per 1 acre foot of capacity. In order
to be conservative we'll use an estimate a full -65% lower than the cheaper San Jose plant
and assume Cadiz doesn't require intensive purification. That means with 50-75k af per
year of treatment the plant alone would still cost $140-211m in capex. This point alone
clearly renders the entire project worthless and financially unviable.


I would also note water purification is extremely energy intensive and Cadiz's initial $277m
project cost estimate includes required electricity needs, but excludes electricity cost
estimates needed for water treatment that is required. I don't see how increased power
needs for purification don't create the need for a larger and more expensive electricity
generation on site, further increasing CDZI costs.

The operating costs for water purification plants are also extreme. While Cadiz has a long
history of under estimating costs and proposed timelines (detailed throughout this report),
Cadiz CEO Scott Slater has said publicly he believed Chromium treatment will increase
the cost of Cadiz water by as much as $400 per acre foot (>$20m per year). Other
independent analysts conservatively predict treatment cost could be $7.5-$20m as PAC
institute estimates Cadiz chromium treatment alone would cost $500-600 per acre foot, or
$27m+ per year for Cadiz. While it is not clear how much of CEO Scott Slater's estimate
includes depreciation, even if you cut this $400/af annual operating number in half it
renders the Cadiz project unviable. Hilariously, in a curious "pivot" CEO Slater now seems
to indicate he can treat the water for $60/af, but I literally can't find a single large scale
chromium treatment plant anywhere on earth that operates even vaguely close to this cost
level. As you will see later, even ignoring upfront costs, even using the most conservative
operating cost estimates possible, the incremental treatment cost renders an already
unviable project even more uneconomic and un-financeable, further supporting the point
the Cadiz project and stock are both worth $0.


Real Financial Risk of CDZI Aquifer Depletion and Overdraft = Un-financeable


If Cadiz's proposed aquifer recharge rates (what can be pumped) or estimated aquifer size
turn out to be wrong, then (if ever allowed by regulators) the Cadiz project will rapidly draw
down the aquifer and be halted swiftly. The ensuing lawsuits and economic implosion
would clearly wipe out everyone involved with lawsuits and municipal bankruptcy.


I am not here to debate environmental points, I am here to debate issues of financial
consequence for investors. Multiple data points, including Cadiz's own well data, with
aquifer valley data pulled from an unrelated lawsuit, and Cadiz's own actions, all indicate
Cadiz Valley aquifer may already be in overdraft (seemingly for many years) which I
believe renders the project un-investable and un-financeable. I'm not saying it IS in
overdraft, but if it might be then that alone makes this project impossible financially.


Example one is Cadiz's own well data indicating the aquifer could already be in overdraft
just from Cadiz agricultural use of 4,600 af per year (vs. 50-75k af per year withdrawals
Cadiz proposes). Here is a chart of Cadiz groundwater pumping from their token raisin
and lemon operation:

We can see Cadiz has been pumping since 1986 an average annual withdrawal of ~4,600
acre feet per year. As you read on, you will also see why I am suspicious of the sudden
effort at reducing water use in 2006 right when Cadiz was preparing for their second
aquifer analysis...


As you see below, Cadiz own well data seem to show aquifer levels already falling. Even
more telling, their own data seems to conform best to the 5k feet per year aquifer natural
recharge model! While they also seem to have suspiciously distorted these charts by
exaggerating the vertical "Y" axis, consequently making any trend almost impossible to
decipher. However, if you look closely there appears to me to already be an unmistakable
downward trend in the water levels.

What kind of credible scientist purposefully formats a chart like this rendering it useless
anyway? No program I know ofautomatically chooses axis scaling like this so I question
how these charts ended up so badly built and why the Y axis was not scaled properly so
people could see what the charts show.


Given the above, this statement about Cadiz reports excluding data from their previous
wells in the DEIR is also very concerning.


(Picture credit Cadiz project comment letter)


Example two is some interesting commentary from when Cadiz faced a legal battle over
an adjacent proposed landfill over a decade ago. Interestingly, the 1996 Boyle study
referenced also seems to indicate the aquifer was in overdraft just from Cadiz's tiny
agriculture pumping, which CPC and the Board both agreed with at the time.

Cadiz's 32k foot per year aquifer recharge rates are people Cadiz has… paid. Every
alternate or third party involved I could find has estimated aquifer recharge rates far lower.

year at 32k af when the entire Coastal Plain Basin of Orange County recharges at just 29k
af per year….


It's not just the aquifer's recharge rates either, as there are questions about aquifer volume
too. The previous CDZI EIR from 2000-2001 seems to have an estimated aquifer size of
3.65-6.69 MAF, while the new DEIR seems to estimate 17-34 maf of groundwater exists,
while another independent government report estimates the total Cadiz Valley aquifer
volume at only 4.3m with natural recharge rate of just 800 af per year. To think anyone will
loan Cadiz $300m+ based on conflicted work done by biased parties is absurd. Obviously
any big PE infra fund would require and enlist their own independent geologists and if truly
independent analysis disagrees with Cadiz's "science" then the whole project will implode.


To me, CDZI's own actions indicates the science may be "shaky" as well. If the 32k
recharge rate were true, why not design the project with a stated indefinite life pumping
just 32k af per year? An infinite life, truly sustainable project would clearly have a higher

value. If the science is so sound, why does the Groundwater Management Plan for the
project seem convoluted and weaker than the old 2001 project? Also, why not let an
independent federal review come in and confirm the science? If a true federal review done
by USGS confirmed a natural 32k af aquifer recharge then the project would be largely de-
risked and financing costs would drop tremendously. The fact CDZI instead is fighting
independent federal USGS review by trying to dodge proper NEPA federal review seems
telling to me. My trust level of CDZI management couldn't be lower, so until the USGS
verifies CDZI estimates, I am going to invest conservatively, and assume they are wrong.


I believe no ratings agency will touch Cadiz debt given impossible to model cash flow
issues with MWD aqueduct access and aquifer depletion risks. Clearly this project is
nothing like the stability of a municipal water district with tens of thousands of clients and
rate authority. More relevant oil and gas debt is commonly issued at 10-12%+ coupons
often with equity warrants. If you simply take $300m expected project capital costs and
use a 10% cost of capital, that makes the CDZI project deeply cash flow negative even
with optimistic opex, cogs and treatment estimates.


Latest Cadiz Lawsuit Creates Misplaced Optimism: Confirms SMWD Is Not Proper
Lead Agency.


Recently, Cadiz did not lose a lawsuit attempting to overturn Cadiz's state level CEQA
environmental approval and that case is now in appeals. Had Cadiz lost, it would have
been devastating, likely revoking SMWD status as lead agency, forcing CDZI to re-do
CEQA environmental permitting process (amazingly expensive and time consuming) and
(most importantly) would put the project back to the proper lead agency of San Bernadino,
rendering the project dead since it seems CDZI applied for their project in San
Bernadino recently in 2006-2007 but apparently failed and has provided minimal
disclosure.


As a result of Cadiz not losing this lawsuit, CDZI stock rose dramatically but I believe
CDZI investor optimism is confused. If you carefully read judge decision transcripts there
is deliberate judge language regarding correct lead agency which makes success in
appeals for Cadiz opposition higher than commonly assumed. As I will explain, if Cadiz
loses this appeals lawsuit, the project is immediately unviable and worth $0.

In order to understand the dynamics at play, background and historical context is
necessary. The Cadiz project (and any project) requires what is called a "lead agency" or
a municipal group that is in charge of approval and various permitting/procedural issues. If
the Lead Agency for a project is cooperative and supportive, this process can be easy but
if the Lead Agency is not supportive then it can also be the death knell. The Cadiz project
is located in San Bernadino County while every aspect of this project involves San
Bernadino County residents, so I believe it is obvious San Bernadino County should be
the lead agency. Instead Cadiz has jumped through legal loopholes to get "Santa
Margarita Water District" (SMWD) to be lead agency. SMWD is hundreds of miles away,
receiving a small fraction of the benefits with none of the impacts and is also a large water
customer creating flagrant conflicts of interest. I believe Cadiz went through this
convoluted and questionable path because, if forced through this process with proper lead
agency San Bernadino, the entire Cadiz project is dead and worthless.


I believe this because Cadiz actually already applied for their water project in San
Bernadino County in 2007 and seems to me to have clearly failed. While I did not find
this mentioned in detail in CDZI investor presentations, I know about this curiously
secretive application because you can get these documents through FOIA request and
they are mentioned in the small foot notes of legal documents. In what seems like implicit
acknowledgement from Cadiz that San Bernadino is the proper lead agency we see the
following language from their previous project permit application.

And from court transcripts we see evidence indicating Cadiz apparently withdrew upon
being told Desert Groundwater management compliance would be required, which I
believe would clearly make Cadiz project unviable.


(Court transcripts from CDZI lawsuit)


The lack of detailed disclosure over this apparently failed application I believe shows why
Cadiz has gone through so much legal wrestling in order to make Santa Margarita Water
District lead agency: because if Cadiz project were forced to proceed with proper San
Bernadino as lead agency it would be doomed to failure (again). This also seems
somewhat obvious as otherwise why would Tetra Tech and environmental groups fight so
hard to get proper lead agency San Bernadino re-instated?


Now with lead agency context you will understand how critical the following deliberate and
careful judge wording is for Cadiz.


(2013 OC judge decision on Cadiz lawsuit)


We clearly see the judge state SMWD (Santa Margarita Water District) should not have
been the lead agency. I believe this undeniable legal statement will be hard to fight in
appeals court and there is decent chance SMWD gets removed as lead agency, the
project goes back to the proper and original lead agency of San Bernadino (also requiring
new CEQA process) rendering CDZI worthless.


The political headwind here seems impossible anyway, apparently SMWD water rates are
lower than San Bernadino and if SMWD is so interested in ground water how come they
are one of the only districts in the area who don't seem to drill for ground water in their
own jurisdiction? Furthermore, when Cadiz went to get permits to withdraw water from

CDZI aquifer for agriculture, they applied in San Bernadino. The whole concept of SMWD
involvement is clearly absurd and should be over turned as it sets a very dangerous legal
precedent which cannot be allowed to continue, and apparently the OC judge agrees. It
seems obvious to me any CEQA process done under an improper lead agency, confirmed
by a judge, is an improper and corrupted CEQA with strong odd of being overturned in
appeals.


While I honestly cannot handicap which way this lawsuit goes, I remind you the
environmental groups battling this are very picky when choosing battles. They would only
be taking this appeals lawsuit if they thought they would win and I think the clear judge
language should help reinstate San Bernardino as lead agency. While I don't know how
this will play out, if it goes badly for Cadiz, I believe CDZI stock will effectively be worth $0
overnight.


Cadiz Project Economics Are Impossible = Project Financially Unviable


Even if you ignore all the issues above, CDZI project is still completely financially unviable,
which is likely why the MET has said it "doesn't pencil out" and "question about Cadiz
always was the economics". If you own CDZI you are effectively claiming you can better
model out project economics than the regulatory body who has governed tens of billions of
dollars of water projects in CA since 1928 and is responsible for deciding if any subsidies
are applied.


I think few investors have actually dug through all the customer contracts, financing terms
and put a sharp pencil to paper, so I will try to help.


First off, Cadiz typically loses $16-20m+ of shareholder capital per year.

Some of this is legal and other professional expenses which, if you believe the project
ever goes into operation, should theoretically fall off. I think it's more likely that if the
project ever goes into production Cadiz will get sued from all sides into eternity but let's be
generous to Cadiz and assume total future corporate expense falls to just -$10m per year.


Phase I (conservation and recovery) will cost CDZI at least $277.5m (Link pages 2-8)


Cadiz's proposed project has two phases, the first is Cadiz removing an average of 50k
acre feet per year from the aquifer, sending it 42 miles by pipeline across ARZC ROW to
the MWD owned Aqueduct where it would theoretically be transported to customers via
MWD infrastructure.


As we saw above, Cadiz water will require treatment before being allowed into the MWD's
aqueduct and even being extremely generous to Cadiz it seems this will cost $100m+ to
build and require $200-$400/af per year. However, we are going to pretend we are the
most wildly bullish investors on CDZI ever and completely ignore this impossibly
expensive reality Cadiz faces.


Cadiz has publicly stated phase 1 of this project will cost at least $277.5m. Cadiz has a
multi-decade track record of "over promise, under deliver" and I don't know the last time
you had a construction project come in cheaper than expected, but we'll be extremely
generous again and assume Cadiz's forecasting skills are 100% perfect and go with
$277.75m construction cost.

Luckily we can go through all preliminary option agreements CDZI has so we know
revenues with some precision. CDZI 10k states they've already signed preliminary option
agreements on ~80% of their future projected capacity.

"….80% of the water to be conserved annually by the Project is now either under a Water
Purchase and Sale Agreement or under option. We are currently working with the other
participating agencies to convert their option agreements to definitive economic
agreements"


(10-K for the Period Ending December 31, 2013 (page 6))


To see the corresponding rates we can go through the contracts posted and see the rates
for CZI water <$1k per af per year:


Link 1 (Dec 19, 2014): San Luis Water District ("San Luis"), a predominantly retail
agricultural water agency in California's Central Valley, executed a definitive Purchase and
Sale Agreement ("PSA") securing an annual supply of 10,000 acre-feet of water from the
Cadiz Valley Water Conservation. Under the terms of the PSA, San Luis will pay an initial
price of nine hundred and sixty dollars ($960) per acre-foot ("AF") of water made available
to it by the Project. The payment will be adjusted annually in accordance with the Bureau
of Labor Statistics Water and Sewer Maintenance Index up to a maximum of five percent
(5%) per year.


Link 2 (Aug 28, 2014):Letter of Intent with Lake Arrowhead Community Services District
(LACSD), a California water retailer, for the reservation of 3,000 acre-feet per year from
the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery & Storage Project ("Project"). Under the
LOI, LACSD can reserve up to 3,000 acre-feet of water from the Project at $960/acre-foot
delivered to the Colorado River Aqueduct.


To keep the model simple, let's assume Cadiz has access to the MWD's aqueduct 24/7
and 365 for free, we'll also ignore any "free water" deal SMWD gets in exchange for being
lead agency, we'll assume 100% utilization for 50 straight years by ignoring any annual
fluctuations in Cadiz pumping and we'll also ignore some of the smaller and less important
side deals Cadiz has. We'll also pretend CDZI's paid consultants are the only people in the
world possible of conducting accurate science, and completely ignore the risk of aquifer
damage and accelerated overdraft.


We'll stick with Cadiz's stated average production of 50k af per year, starting at $965/af
revenue and optimistically give Cadiz the highest possible future revenue increases of
+5% per year, impossibly cheap 4.5% municipal project level debt cost, zero equity
required and we'll also assume Cadiz can refinance their current corporate level debt at
just 6%. In even the most optimistic case possible, by the time the project starts, Cadiz will
have burned a total of -$400m which we will assume Cadiz can immediately use all of as

NOLs. While many of Cadiz NOLs are old and will expire before Cadiz can use them and
it is rarely possible to use NOLs to achieve a perfect 0% cash tax rate we will ignore this
and assume CDZI pays 0% tax until it's used up a full $400m in NOLs out in 2031.


We will also be extremely favorable to CDZI and use a 10% discount rate for the stock
even though lower risk Poseidon desalination plant private equity sponsors are predicting
a best case 11-13% equity cost (which is far too low to be interesting in my opinion).
Clearly any discount rate lower than 11% is obviously not accurate given Poseidon is
much less operationally risky than Cadiz. I'll also assume Cadiz somehow has enough
cash to survive their cash burn until their production in 2017 which is clearly optimistic and
unlikely. This whole scenario seems so wildly optimistic as to be absurd, but we'll stick
with it for illustrative purposes.


(Chart built by me with public information)


As we see, even using the most outrageously optimistic estimates possible, ignoring all
risks and using only an expected future return on Cadiz stock of 10%, CDZI stock is
literally worthless. The problem is the economics of this project simply don't work and
CDZI has too much debt which leaves the equity impaired. Furthermore, the entire project
is extremely sensitive to cost control, effective operations and WACC, if any one of those
move even slightly the wrong way the whole project implodes.


I think we all agree, the assumptions above are unrealistically optimistic. The MWD has
directly said in formal, legal comment letters and on national TV Cadiz water will require
treatment and the aqueduct will never be 100% available for Cadiz. Cadiz also seems to
me to have a tendency to end up with insider compensation very similar to whatever the
company's liquidity profile will support which I did not adjust for here.

Using still very favorable, but more realistic estimates, we can see the Cadiz project is
permanently burning cash with negative profitability, leaving CDZI stock so impaired and
worthless that Cadiz is not even vaguely close and the debt is impaired while only getting
worse the longer debt holders wait.


(Chart built by me with public information)


As far as I can tell, Cadiz even says their project isn't viable in their own slide deck! Below
we see Cadiz state the phase 1 project will have "after operating costs and capex"
(commonly known as "Earnings Before Interest or Taxes" EBIT) of $500-600/af. At 50k af
per year, that is EBIT of $27.5m but we can see even using unrealistically favorable
estimates that project level interest payments are $12.5m per year, Cadiz corporate level
debt interest is $6.36m per year and Cadiz corporate expense is a minimum of $10-12m
per year, leaving -$1.36m of loses per year for CDZI shareholders! And this is using
Cadiz's own estimates!

I think from everything we have seen, it is beyond clear this project is never, ever going to
happen. For those of you still latched onto this stock market oddity though, we can quickly
go through the even less viable project "Phase 2".


Phase II. Imported Water Storage (Link pages 9-13) to cost $258m.


In Phase II of the project, imported water from the Colorado River would be sent down the
Colorado River Aqueduct (see map) to its junction with the Arizona-California Railroad
near Rice. There, the water would be pumped up through a 44 mile pipeline parallel to the
pipeline built in Phase I, terminating in recharge basins in the Fenner Valley above Cadiz.
The water would then be allowed to percolate into the ground and be stored in the
underground aquifer until it is needed as a dry-year supply. The total capacity of the
storage system is anticipated to be one million acre feet of ground water storage.


As we can see below in an official government document from 2011, Cadiz shows
proposed Phase 2 would cost $258.5m, which does not seem to include the $20m+ of
cost it would take to put this additional project phase through NEPA environmental review.

Now we know Cadiz has spent at least $75m on preparation so far for their project with
Phase I estimate at least $15-20m+ of, was legal, environmental and professional
expenses. Cadiz states Phase 2 will require a new environmental approval process from
scratch. Ignoring that, this version of Cadiz project seems to have failed twice already (by
MWD in 2002 and San Bernadino in 2007) we will just assume with 100% confidence it
succeeds in becoming approved. The numbers above don't include the permitting and
other costs that must occur first, so we'll assume Cadiz can reuse some of the work
they've done and in total this costs $15m and takes a few years. Cadiz is obviously
worthless, but for the sake of discussion, regarding phase 2 we'll assume it's operational
in 2020, CDZI uses 100% sub debt at 7% rate, is paid $1,500 on 250k AF in 2020 and
$1,500 on 250k af in 2021, $20/af management fee increasing 5% per year, $2.5m opex
increasing 3% with 10% discount rate and 20% cash tax rate. This still results in negative
value to CDZI equity, as this is simply not an economic project even using the "Best case"
estimated scenario.

I think there is evidence Cadiz knows the math above is likely true as otherwise, why
would they even waste time with the obviously unviable farming operation? Why sell
farming acreage which requires water to Limoneira at such a low price? Cadiz currently
uses 4-6k acre feet per year on agriculture, if Cadiz honestly thought they'd soon be
pumping the water out at $1,000 per af that same water could be worth $4m in the future
versus the $350k in revenue they currently generate.


Just stop already

Owning CDZI Stock = A Bet Against Long-Term Water Trends


CDZI investors don't seem to understand owning CDZI stock is actually akin to betting
against the long-term trends in water. We are currently seeing a global revolution in
water purification, recycling, conservation and desalination technology. The cost of these
options is making enormous step changes downward at the same time efficiency and
quality is improving. Things that were literally impossible in years past are now
commonplace.


Since 1990 water desalination membrane costs have fallen by more than -90% while
industrial water recycling and global desalination plant capacity has gone parabolic.

Literally all macro water trends are working against Cadiz. Every year California becomes
more environmentally sensitive, water drinking standards increase as analysis equipment
improves (chromium) while competing recycling, conservation and desalination technology
costs decrease relentlessly year-after-year. Even if everything else was going Cadiz's way,
the relentless impact of technology and regulation alone will render Cadiz obsolete. Like
investing in coal, owning CDZI is a bet against the trends which make water a compelling
long-term opportunity. I am convinced anyone investing in the space can find better
opportunities than this heavily leveraged failure without revenue facing structural
headwinds.


Cadiz Delivered Water Costs: Nowhere Near Cost Competitive


Even using the most optimistic assumptions possible Cadiz water is more expensive and
less reliable than multiple other options municipalities and water districts are working on.


Cadiz seems to pretend the only water options for Southern California are enormously
expensive, but the truth is there are countless, larger, cheaper and more reliable water
options than their crazy desert boondoggle. This So Cal study shows plentiful cheaper and
less risky options.

amounts of stock onto a revolving door of investors in order to also fund decades of
egregious compensation and payments to their own companies. Note the chart above only
goes to 1999 while CDZI has been in existence since 1983, so the presented -$47m of
compensation estimates is too low.


Given $47m+ of insider compenation, do YOU hink CDZI management are in a hurry to
get Cadiz project to a (failure) finish?

Cadiz CEO Scott Slater (picture credit PBS)


Management seem to have milked this company for decades and I believe investors
should be furious with management's excessive compensation relative to its constant
failure. Just the Chairman, CEO and CFO earned approximately ~$1.5M in 2013, or ~5x
more than the revenues they generated.

How could CDZI insiders possibly have funded this ?

CDZI has diluted shareholders by a staggering 1,600% since inception. So (predictably)
CDZI stock has been an absolute disastrous investment over time falling from ~$600 per
share stock (split adjusted) to $10 today.

Strange Related Party Transactions at CDZI?


Amazingly, CDZI shareholder money also goes to further enrich CEO and general counsel
Scott Slater through CDZI payments to his old law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck
(BHFS), where Slater is listed as a shareholder of BHFS.


But in the previous 10K, it states CDZI paid BHFS for advisory services, should this have
been highlighted in a stated "related party transaction" section?

"The higher 2013 expense was primarily due to higher stock non-cash compensation
costs related to shares awarded to the Brownstein law firm for certain legal and
advisory services to the Company (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
"Common Stock")"


Former Director wanted a piece of the Cake Too!?


It doesn't seem to stop with CEO Slater though, as Mr. Timothy J Shaheen has been CDZI
CFO since 2008 and director since 1999. However, since January 2008, he also is the
sole member and manager at "AG Derivatives LLC." Where I note CDZI paid him even
more money for a curious consulting agreement between CDZI and AG Derivatives,
L.L.C.:


"THIS CONSULTING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of January 1,
2008, by and between Ag Derivatives, L.L.C., a California limited liability company
("Consultant") and Cadiz Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cadiz"). In consideration of the
services to be provided by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement, Cadiz shall pay to
Consultant a fee of $12,500 per month. Such fee shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any compensation payable directly to Shaheen by Cadiz for Shaheen's service, in his
individual capacity, on the Board of Directors of Cadiz."


The questionable history of CDZI founder, past CEO and current chairman Keith
Brackpool could fill an entire report of its own. Cadiz, seems to have originally been
connected to a failed JoJoba plant project in AZ, but Brackpool bought agricultural land in
CA. With BrackPool making political contributions and becoming involved in CA water
issues, CDZI was built. However, he appears to have been fined for violating UK securities
law, was involved in "the British equivalent of Enron" and some investors in the AZ JoJoba
venture also appear to have felt he may have overestimated its profit potential and
availability of water (sound familiar?).


As one investment advisor explains:


"Keith tells a great story," said one investment advisor. "The holders listened to him and
got caught with their pants down."

As shown in the table above, Brackpool alone seems to have collected $23m out of Cadiz
including paying Brackpool's $700k+ the same year the Cadiz project failed in 2002. How
is that possibly fair to CDZI shareholders? Do you honestly believe these people are
looking out for your interests?


Somehow the Cadiz team have managed to lose an amazing -$359m since inception and
kept this whole thing going for 25 years despite the stock losing -98% of its value and
diluting shareholders into oblivion.


Valuing Cadiz Inc.: -$10m Cash Burn, unviable project, maturing $106.2m debt
=$0.00 price target


I love investing in water driven companies, and first came across Cadiz as a potential
opportunity, but unfortunately Cadiz stock is worthless. Cadiz' only value lies in their ~45k
acres of land in the middle of the Mojave Desert area of San Bernardino County, of which
7,400 have been donated (~$0 shareholder value) and ~1,800 developed for agriculture.


Cadiz is essentially the only one buying raw land out there in decades so comps are tough
to come by, but we do know another land buyer in the area is called Mojave Desert Land
Trust. This organization has paid $18m to buy 37k acres all around the Cadiz region for a
per acre price of $486. If you think this is unreasonable, here are San Bernadino property
records where you can find Cadiz's lots broken out, and you're welcome to value each lot
with your own appropriate comps if you like.


We also know Limoneira (where Cadiz CEO Scott Slater is on the board) just paid CDZI
$1.2m for 200 acres of Cadiz productive agriculture for a per acre price of $6k, which is a
direct comp for CDZI ag acreage. If we estimate Cadiz cash burn and add up land values,
we see Cadiz has total value of $29.1m. However, Cadiz also has $106m in debt maturing
over the next 3 years which is senior to stockholders/equity. If you add up all the value
Cadiz owns and subtract the senior debt claims I think not only is CDZI stock worth $0 but
the debt is also impaired by at least -60%.

The land value doesn't even come close to covering Cadiz's staggering $106.2m of
maturing debt, or even just the March 2016 Sr. Debt, which unfortunately leaves CDZI
equity without value.

Cadiz Near-Term Debt (from 10k filing)


CDZI Management Response:


I literally have been trying to get in touch with CDZI for over a month with mutliple calls
and messages as I have serious questions raised here I want answered. Despite
tremendous effort, I never was able to get anyone to talk to me on the phone and received
zero response.


I believe when companies do not prioritize investment communication that's a big red flag
and I look forward to CDZI publicly and comprehensively addressing all the issues raised
here. With $106m of debt coming due, the market will not be fooled by mediocre press
release from the company attempting to brush off serious issues raised. Given poor
management quality, I encourage all CDZI investors to remain skeptical until they receive
proof from truly independent CA water experts that CDZI is economic, something I believe
will never happen.


Conclusion: CDZI's Near Term Pathway To $0.00


The last time Cadiz's project failed the stock immediately fell -96.91%, barely avoided
bankruptcy, and still hasn't recovered over a decade later. Even ignoring obvious NEPA-
driven failure and clear-cut MWD disproval, this time Cadiz has much more debt with less
agency/government support and is in an environment where their cost is even less
competitive than before.


For those of you looking to invest in water, I'm sure you can find something better than this
crazy boondoggle facing impossible problems which is without management credibility.
There are 10,000 stocks in the US alone, thousands with water exposure, and I'm sure
you can find something easier to understand without bankruptcy risk and total -100%
wipeout. Perhaps you should invest in a "real" business like Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK)
who is growing profitably and cheap, or American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) with long
term tailwinds of expanding ROE, because I'm certain both of those companies will exist
next year, whereas the opposite is likely true for Cadiz.


Let's be honest too: if CDZI stock doesn't at least fall into the "too hard" category to own,
then what does?


Soon I believe the NEPA decision on Cadiz's critical ROW issue will have been formalized
openly and Cadiz stock will implode. This time, however, Cadiz will simultaneously have
burned through -$10m of their cash and be left facing another -$20m cash burn year
(NEPA permit approval and legal costs) with just $6m cash on hand and an imminent
