Spruce Point Is Short Echo Global Logistics 
(“Echo”) For The Following Reasons:


1 Checkered History of Echo’s Founders: Echo was founded in 2005 to roll-up the transportation logistics / brokerage 
sector. Founded by the same people behind Groupon, Echo has yet to be fully exposed until now.  Led by Eric 
Lefkofsky and his partner Brad Keywell, these inter-related, yet distinct publicly traded businesses share the same 
founders, business address, auditors, and same modus operandi of hyping “proprietary” and “disruptive” 
technologies capable of earning “massive” profits in large, fragmented markets. In our opinion, time and results have 
shown these predictions have failed to live up to initial expectations, and have lead to large shareholder losses to 
post IPO investors, but enriched its founders and early backers who quickly dumped stock


2


3
Dubious Technology Claims and Fundamental Struggles: It is a wild stretch to believe Echo is anything more than a 
transportation broker with limited technology advantages. Much like Groupon, which hyped its technology, Echo 
often claims its proprietary technology advantage. When it came public, Echo hyped its “ETM” technology, but has 
since stopped discussing it, as well as its enterprise client base and shipping volumes, which Echo initially touted 
offered it revenue stability from contractual arrangements. Echo has shuffled through five Chief Technology Officers, 
and employee reviews reflect its technology dept is in disarray. Its last technology iteration – “Optimizer” is not even 
optimized for Google Chrome, the world’s most popular browser! Even worse, Echo is now being challenged by a 
wave of new start-ups trying to “Uberize” the trucking industry with real-time, location-based technologies. Echo’s 
previous foray into mobile app development appears to have failed miserably. The ubertization movement of the 
industry has the potential to seize market share, and force margin compression among traditional players such as 
Echo. Adding insult to injury, New Enterprise Associates, Echo’s early venture backer, is now directly investing in 
Transfix, a disruptive competitor


Diverging Alignment of Insiders With Investors: Echo’s pre-IPO backers and founders have largely cashed out. The 
current CEO/CFO owns a paltry 2% of the stock. However, more worrisome, management keeps gearing its 
compensation more towards cash (less toward stock) every single year. Option grants, a highly levered bet on the 
upside of Echo’s stock, are non-existent in recent years. Options are critically important motivators for attracting 
technology talent, which appears absent at Echo. Echo’s compensation peer set was recently re-constituted to, not-
surprisingly, position itself among larger technology companies to justify greater cash pay to management.

6 Echo Hyping Command Deal “Synergies” Likely To Massively Disappoint: Since last August, Echo has touted wildly 
optimistic Command revenue synergies of $200-$300m in 2017-2018 that defy logic. These targets are approx. 50%  –
75% of Command’s entire $407M, enterprise value and massively higher than synergy targets for any transportation 
logistics deal we could identify recently!  Echo has said “technology integration” and “cross-selling” will result in 
enormous synergies. However, given evidence of Command employee defections, and our belief that Command’s 
technology is not likely to be unique, we believe these synergy targets will sorely disappoint.  In our opinion, Echo is 
coming under further pressure, and in Q2’16 (a whole year after completing the acquisition) Echo announced 
unspecified  $3m of new “cost” synergies without providing any specifics….


Strain in Echo’s Financials Evident From its Largest Acquisition of Command Transportation: Brokers such as Echo 
tend to add the most value in periods of tight shipping capacity and high fuel environments, yet currently the market is 
oversupplied with lower fuel costs than 2yrs ago. In 2015, Echo levered up and diluted shareholders to diversify more 
into the Truckload brokerage business by acquiring Command Transportation. This richly priced deal cost 11.2x EBITDA 
and exposes Echo to greater spot market (non-contracted) business, and lower margin Truckload brokerage, a 
dangerous place to be for an asset-light business levered 2.5x Net Debt / EBITDA. Our research suggests that Echo’s 
acquisition has been a disaster, with meaningful employee departures; Command’s founder even returned $750,000 to 
Echo! Furthermore, Echo made significant changes to its Non-GAAP financial presentation, which has caused its GAAP / 
Non-GAAP results to rapidly diverge. Not surprisingly, when adjusting Echo’s recent quarterly results to remove the 
effect of Command, we find that its true organic revenue growth has been decaying each quarter and is now negative!


Questionable Benefits From Echo’s Acquisition Strategy: As a subscale player in the transportation logistics sector, 
which has limited barriers to entry, Echo has grown primarily through acquisitions and completed 21 deals since 2007.  
As noted by peers and industry experts, sector M&A is particularly challenging given various cultural and technological 
system integrations necessary. Spruce Point has a strong history of evaluating flawed acquisition strategies (notably 
Ametek), and believes that Echo’s strategy has created limited/no operating leverage. Key to evaluating its strategy, we 
observe that in over a decade Echo has not demonstrated it can generate any excess cash flow. Since 2006, its cash 
from operations adjusted for capex, acquisitions and deferred acquisition payments is -$409m.

Spruce Point Is Short Echo Global Logistics 
(“Echo”) For The Following Reasons:


Valuation Downside of 50% to 60% When This Stock Unravels: Wall St. analysts assume Echo will capture all of its 
synergies, its end markets will improve in the face of rapid technology changes, and have failed to normalize its 
financial for the numerous accounting distortions we’ve identified. As a result, analysts’ have a unanimous “buy” 
recommendation and see ~11% upside in the shares – a terrible risk/reward in our view. Echo trades at a premium to 
peers on its inflated numbers, but in our view, should trade at a discount given our numerous concerns. By applying a 
8x– 9x EBITDA multiple to our adjusted results, we see a price target of $11.00 - $13.00 (50% -60% downside)


9


Rampant Accounting and Financial Control Concerns Evident: Per SEC questioning pre-IPO, Groupon was forced to 
restate revenues from Gross to Net presentation. Echo quietly changed its revenue presentation from “gross profit” to 
“net revenue” and stopped breaking out “fee for service” revenue recorded on a Net basis. After reviewing recent FASB 
clarification on Net vs. Gross accounting, in our layman’s opinion, Echo’s revenue recognition is problematic given its 
Terms of Service contract pushes all the responsibilities and risks and liabilities for fulfilling the transportation services 
onto its carriers. Echo’s GAAP vs. Non-GAAP results are rapidly divergence (particularly after it made substantial 
changes to its financial presentation after acquiring Command in mid 2015). As an example, Echo has repeatedly 
stretched its intangible amortization period every single year, and has the most aggressive assumptions among peers. 
To make matters worse, In 2012, Echo acquired Shipper Direct and later disclosed to investors it had been defrauded by 
the sellers, which revealed a material weakness and lapses of internal financial controls. Shortly thereafter, Echo’s 
founder Lefkofsky abruptly resigned from the Board. Nonetheless, Echo’s audit fees have frown 40% p.a. since 2013 
and are both unusually large and growing substantially faster than peers


Echo Growing More Dependent on Short-Term Financing, While Appearing To Be In Violation of a Debt Covenant 
These newly identified cost synergies make little sense to us given that Echo recently announced an enormous 
headquarter lease expansion adding over $41m of total operating lease expense at a time when headcount is 
shrinking YoY! What’s worse, in our opinion this new lease indebtedness has put Echo out of compliance with its 
revolving Asset Base Lending (ABL) credit agreement. Curiously, Echo dropped the language in its recent 10-Q stating 
that it was in compliance, potentially leaving it without $200m of liquidity and hampering its ability to execute its 
acquisition growth strategy! Given Echo’s increasing dependency on short-term financing, and its terrible cash 
management (it earns zero interest income) it cannot afford to lose access to this critical liquidity

Warning to Echo Investors: 
Analyze Background of its Founders


Echo was co-founded by Eric Lefkofsky and partner Brad Keywell.  Their track record should be carefully vetted by Echo investors:


• The duo bought children’s apparel company Brandon Apparel Group. It later faltered, Lefkofsky explained in his blog entitled “When You 
Don’t Know What to Say” (Sept 2012):  “Along with our sales growth came lots of debt which eventually crippled the company when 
fashion trends changed in the late 90’s” (note: Echo recently took on $230m of debt and we believe its industry is changing)


• The pair later founded Starbelly.com an online promotional-merchandise seller in 1999. In early 2000, Starbelly sold itself to publicly 
traded Ha-Lo Industries for $240 million, much of which went Lefkofsky.  Commenting on the deal, Keywell said, "This move positions us 
just where we want to be long term, which is to dominate this entire industry."


• Shortly thereafter, Ha-Lo declared bankruptcy. Shareholders and others blamed the Starbelly deal, and a series of lawsuits ensued 
According to legal filings, Lefkofsky made the following statement to Ha-Lo colleagues even as the business was deteriorating: "Lets get 
funky. Lets announce everything. Lets be WILDLY positive in our forecasts, if we get wacked on the ride down -- who gives a sh*t. Is it going 
to worse than today? is our market cap going to fall to 200N, 100M who the f**k cares.“


Lefkosky and Keywell later emerged as founders of three new “technology” companies, the most notable and promoted was 
Groupon.  Groupon’s struggles have been well publicized; its stock is down 80% since IPO’ing at $20/sh in 2011


 According to Lefkofsky, “Groupon is going to be wildly profitable.” – Need we say anymore? To his credit, Lefkofsky has held 
most of his equity in the company (along with Keywell), and even assumed an interim role as CEO, before being replaced


Lefkofsky and Keywell founded Echo in 2005, with the strategy of using “proprietary” technology to gain share in the large and 
fragmented transportation logistics industry, with $1.3 trillion of annual spend according to data cited in its prospectus


 According to the S-1, Lefkofsky and Keywell owned 18.9% and 12.4%, of Echo respectfully. As of its last proxy statement, and 
SC 13G/A Lefkfofsky owns just 3.3%, while Keywell owns a token 2%


 Lefkofsky quietly resigned from the Board in Dec 12 as stated in an 8-K filing, shortly thereafter Echo noted a material weakness


Another insight into Lefkosfky can be seen from his blog “The Valley or the Peak” (Aug 2012):  “We have for many years promoted 
the concept of fast failure as a means to building innovative business models. The concept is simple. Often you have to iterate your 
way into a business model that actually works to the extent it’s disruptive, so every early iteration is in fact destined to be a failure. 
As a result, you might as well fail fast.”

Echo’s IPO Filled With High Hopes


Source: Echo’s S-1 IPO Prospectus


In order to sell its IPO and blue-sky growth potential to investors, Echo highlighted the following 


competitive advantages of its industry, business model, and strategy.  To understand and appreciate 


the short thesis in Echo, investors must critically analyze the company’s claims.


Large Total Addressable Market (TAM): Total transportation and logistics spend 
for the US in 2008 ~$1.3 trillion. Gross revenue for 3rd party logistics in the US in 
2008 ~$127 billion


Significant growth and traction with “Enterprise” clients, providing long-
term contracts (implying cash flow stability)


Scalable and proprietary technology solution that has a significant value 
proposition to clients


Fragmented market with opportunities to consolidate and “roll-up” smaller 
players and achieve “operating leverage”


Access to carrier network/capacity and experienced management team

Echo touts the benefits of its “asset-light” third party logistics business strategy insofar it does not own 


any underlying transportation assets. This type of business model does not inherently lend itself well to 


leverage given that the company owns no hard assets, and is largely dependent on its employees and 


customer relationships. Echo’s recent acquisition of Command added significant leverage the business.

Spot Transactions Managed/Enterprise


Warning: Leverage and Dilution Rising, 
With Substantially Greater Business Risk


Source: Echo SEC filings


Greater % of Business Now Riskier “Spot” Deals Greater % of Lower Margin Truckload Business


Echo’s business has evolved over the years, and its largest deal in 2015 to acquire Command 


Transportation is particularly noteworthy from the perspective of the leverage added to the business. Echo 


significantly increased its exposure to the “spot” market, which are transactional business arrangements 


not subject to long-term contracts that provide cash flow stability. Furthermore, Command’s business 


added further business exposure to the truckload brokerage market, which is traditionally a lower margin 


business.

Excess Transportation Capacity To 
Pressure Echo’s Margins


There are multiple reasons why Echo’s margins are unlikely to expand, and remain under pressure. Given its 


increase leverage to the thiner margin Truckload business, the risk of financial distress has increased recently


Excess Capacity in Trucking and Transportation and Rate Cuts


 Freight and logistics brokers such as Echo operate best in periods of tight shipping capacity where they can add the most value for clients 
and receive the best margins. Generally speaking, when capacity is plentiful and rates are soft, Echo’s value proposition declines


 Currently, there’s a period of excess capacity in the North American transportation market. To illustrate, Werner Enterprises (Nasdaq: 
WERN) recently warned on June 20th of earnings pressure as a result of (1) sluggish freight market conditions; decelerating rate per total 
mile trends from difficult 2016 customer rate negotiations and weak spot market rates, lower miles per truck and increased empty miles, 
and (2) the cost of driver pay increases implemented first Q1’16 and contractor per mile increases in Q4’15


 JOC measures Truckload capacity and its index is at a multiyear high as indicated in the chart to the right. According to JOC, efforts by US 
truckload carriers to trim excess capacity are running into roadblocks. The pressure on surface transportation rates is evident by the Cass 
Indices (left chart), measures of freight volume, shipper spending and pricing drawn from data from more than $25bn in yearly freight bills

Rising Fuel Costs Could Pressure Echo’s 
Margins Going Forward


Limited Further Benefits From Lower Fuel Prices


 Echo’s net margins benefited meaningfully in the past two years as a result of the precipitous decline in fuel costs. Commenting on 
the improvement in Truckload margins in 2015, COO Menzel said: 


“Well, I think that as we mentioned – the fuel is a big driver there because obviously, as the fuel prices come down, the 
numerator is shrinking and the margins tend to expand. And so it's hard to predict where fuel's going to go. We've seen, 
roughly, I think it's four or five consecutive quarters of margin expansion on the truckload side


 With fuel prices likely to have bottom, rising fuel or volatile but range bound fuel costs pose a significant risk to future earnings. In the 
event fuel prices rise, carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses, and Echo’s margins would 
decrease if it were unable to continue to pass through to its clients the full amount of these increased costs

Escalating Commission Costs 
Pressuring Margins


Rising Sales Commission Costs


Source: Echo SEC filings


Echo Touts Confusing Salesforce Productivity Gains


Source: Echo Investor Presentation, May 2016


Higher Commission Costs Cutting Into Margins


 Echo’s business is highly dependent on recruiting and retaining sales agents. Based on our research, it is very much an up or out sales 
culture. In the bottom right chart, Echo touts it is driving “productivity gains” from longer tenured insider sales, and rising “Annualized 
Gross Profit” per average inside sales client representative by months of tenure


 Something Doesn’t Add Up:  Spruce Point doesn’t understand how Echo is calculating its gross profit per average employee (is gross 
profit = net revenue?). Consider that Echo says its insider sales tenure average 27.5 months (right chart) and that the average gross 
profit per employee is approximately $400k. Echo reported 1,654 sales agents in Q2’16, which would equate to $661m of gross profit 
($400k*1,651), astronomically higher than the $333m of LTM net revenue it reports 


 Commission Costs Rising Fast: In the left hand chart, we’ve plotted the rapid escalation of Echo’s commission structure. Because Echo’s 
business is human capital intensive, the war for talented sales people in a competitive business can force commission costs to rise. Also, 
Echo’s greater focus on the truckload business, where commission are higher, is driving up its cost structure

In Our Opinion, Echo’s Business Strategy Has 
Produced Little/No Operating Leverage


Spruce Point has a history of accurately identifying over-hyped roll-up stories promoted to deliver 


significant operating leverage, most notably Ametek. 


 Because freight logistics businesses are asset light, ECHO is primarily acquiring people and relationships 


 As an alternative to acquiring companies, ECHO could open new offices in other geographic regions, and hire 
or recruit new or experienced employees to cultivate or build its client relationships 


 If Echo were to build itself organically many of these employment hiring, training and recruiting costs would 
run through the income statement and depress earnings and cash flow. Instead, Echo runs these costs through 
the cash flow statement as an investment (or financing in the case of contingent payments)


 As a result, the best way to evaluate Echo’s operating leverage and performance is by looking at cash flow 
after acquisition costs and capital expenditures 


Dave Menzel, Chief Financial Officer of Echo – quote July 25, 2013


“Increased operating leverage and improved sales force productivity reflect the traction our sales organization is 
gaining in the marketplace as we continue to execute on our strategy to become the premier multimodal 
transportation service provider to the small and middle market shipper. We expect that our investments in our 
business will continue to drive gains in both revenue and operating leverage.”

Evidence Questioning Echo’s True 
Operating Leverage


Source: Echo financial statements
(1) Excludes 2015 results due to the large acquisition of Command Transportation which skews results. 2006-Q2’16 cumulative adjusted free cash flow is -$409m


In our opinion, there is no evidence to suggest that Echo’s strategy as a roll-up acquirer of 


transportation logistics companies is adding economic value after nearly a decade in existence. When 


evaluating its free cash flow adjusted for recurring acquisitions, deferred cash payments and capital 


expenditures we find that it has burned $50.5 million (2006-2014). (1)

M&A Challenges in Third Party Logistics


(1) Expeditors 2015 Annual Report, p. 3
(2) “Consolidation in the 3PL industry: Why is it happening, and what does it mean?” Q3 2015 issue of Supply Chain Quarterly by D. Robert C. Lieb Professor of Supply Chain Management


“Unlike many of its competitors, who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition, the Company operates the 


same transportation and accounting computer software, running on a common hardware platform, in all of its full-


service locations. Small and middle-tier competitors, in general, do not have the resources available to develop 


these customized systems. Historically, growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for 


many of the Company’s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant “goodwill.” As a result, the 


Company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions.” (1)


According to new survey research of CEOs in the 3PL sector, many industry leaders believe post-acquisition integration of 
companies is difficult, and research has shown that less than half of M&A generates the anticipated benefits (2)


Several themes emerged highlighting post-acquisition integration problems previously experienced:


 Leadership changes: “If the exodus of management talent is too extensive, there is a real risk that the loss of intellectual capital
will hinder the future operations of the company”


 Employee Morale:  “Given the chronic shortage of management talent in the 3PL industry, this issue also demands considerable 
attention from upper-level management post-acquisition”


 Systems Integration: “it is not uncommon for different business units of the same company to have different information systems 
that are not linked. Many of the acquisition targets of those companies are in the same situation. Consequently, the acquiring 
company often faces a daunting challenge in attempting to integrate not only its own systems but also those of the acquired 
company”


 Realization of Multimodal Synergies: “It is quite challenging to realize the potential synergies among those modes and harness 
them in a way that delivers a more attractive value proposition in the marketplace”


 Cultural Integration:  “Failure to identify and consider major differences between the cultures of the two companies pre-
acquisition, and to plan accordingly, can lead to costly conflicts”


 Brand Identity: “In an industry that lives in constant fear of commoditization, most large 3PLs devote considerable thought and 
resources to establishing a corporate brand identity that differentiates the company from its competitor”


Commenting on M&A in the 3PL sector, industry leader and bellwether Expeditors International says the following:

Questionable Origins of Echo’s Recent 
Command Transportation Deal


American Backhaulers


• Acquired by CH Robinson (CHRW) in Nov 1999 for $100m cash and $36m of stock, American Backhaulers was an asset-light 3rd party 
transportation provider with net revenues of ~$38.3m and adjusted operating income of ~$9.5m


• Founded by Paul Loeb in 1981 and joined by Jeff Silver EVP
• According to Loeb, “We're excited about sharing our tools and technology with the entire Robinson network.“ 


Loeb Later Founded Command Transportation. CHRW Sues Loeb and Command Transport for Fraud: 


• Allegations include that Loeb and co-defendant Harrison (CHRW Director of Technology) misappropriated key source code, proprietary 
technology and know-how behind CHRW’s Express software, violated a non-compete and solicited CHRW employees


• Echo announced is intention to acquire Command in April 2015 for $420m. In 2014, Command had $102m and $37m in Net Revenue and 
Adjusted EBITDA


• Commenting on the transaction ECHO CEO Waggoner "Together with Command, we will significantly enhance our national scale and 
density in the highly fragmented TL market. We will also leverage the unique technology of both companies to continue offering best-in-
class services and comprehensive solutions that make our companies the provider of choice for our respective clients”      


Loeb’s Former Partner Jeff Silver Founds Coyote Logistics and Sells it to UPS


• After leaving CHRW, Mr. Silver left to study supply chain and logistics at MIT and received his MBA. Mr. Silver later founded Coyote 
Logistics in 2006 with the backing of Warburg Pincus


• According to Mr Silver, he hired several former MIT classmates at Coyote. Mr. Silver says the math and technology they employ has 
helped win some key accounts, including Heineken


• In July 2015, UPS announced it would acquire Coyote for $1.8 billion, allowing it to acquire the largest asset-light truckload brokerage 
company. Coyote had revenues of $2.1 billion


ECHO’s recently promoted acquisition of Command deserves scrutiny. The history of Command’s founder 


and former partner call into question the proprietary nature of its technology. ECHO now competes 


against industry behemoth UPS, which acquired Coyote Logistics, run by Loeb’s former partner

(1) Synergy guidance of DKK $1.5bn converted at $0.1497/DKK


Echo CFO Kyle Sauers (8/16/15): “I'm excited to update you on our long-term targets. You will recall that the 2017 targets that we 
issued last summer included plans for $2 billion in revenue and $100 million of non-GAAP EBITDA. We are already well ahead of plan 
toward these targets, and as such, we're issuing new 2018 targets of $3 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA of $150 million. 
Embedded in these targets are annual organic revenue growth rates of 10% to 12%, annual revenue synergies from the Command 
integration of $200 million to $300 million by 2018, and an additional $200 million to $300 million of new acquisition revenue”


Echo’s goals for its Command acquisition are almost certain to miss expectations. Echo has guided to $200 -


$300m of revenue synergies, a target so astronomically high, they are hardly believable in relation to Command’s 


$561m of 2014 sales. We analyzed synergy targets from recent logistics deals to put these figures in perspective.

Unusual New Disclosure Further Suggests 
Command Employees Jumping Ship


Why would Command’s owner pay Echo back $750,000 a year after the deal closed if everything is 


going great with the acquisition!


• On the previous slide, Linkedin data indicated that Command employees are on the decline. There is further evidence to 
suggest that the Command acquisition has led to meaningful erosion of key employees


• Recall that Echo closed the acquisition on Jun 1, 2015. Three quarter later in its Q1’16 10-Q, Echo noted the following 
unusual accounting transaction:


During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adjusted the purchase price to recognize a $1.2 million contingent asset that may be 
due from the seller related to the retention of former Command employees. The fair value of the contingent asset at the 
acquisition date was determined based on the probability of the Company meeting certain employee retention criteria set forth in
the purchase agreement.…The maximum amount the company can receive under this agreement is $1.5 million


• In Q2’16 10-Q, Echo further noted:


During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received $750,000 from the seller of Command after the Company met certain 
employee retention criteria set forth in the purchase agreement. The Company also recorded expense of $32,006 to selling, 
general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the contingent asset's updated fair
value of $0.4 million as of June 30, 2016


• Echo filed the Command purchase agreement on April 17, 2015; Spruce Point cannot identify the employee retention 
criteria reference by Echo


• In practice, it would be unusual for a seller to return money to a buyer unless something material changed after the 
closing of the acquisition.  We are justified to suspect that Echo has experienced a meaningful departure of key employees 
that necessitate repayment of deal funds

Highly Questionable Cost Synergies


Although Command was acquired >1yr ago, Echo announced on its Q2’16 earnings conference call that it had 


identified $3m of cost synergies for its forward guidance. Echo did not elaborate. In our opinion, this mysterious 


and unexpected cost synergy forecast should be viewed skeptically in light of its decision to massively expand 


its fixed overhead lease expenses.


• To illustrate our concern, we observe that on March 30, 2016 Echo announced it signed an expansion lease of 132,000 sqft to 
add a total of approx. 225,000 sqft at its headquarters at a time when business is weak and YoY headcount is declining 


• According to local news, Echo has 800 employees in Chicago, and Command is expected to add 500. This massive expansion 
now yields 172 sqft per Echo employee, a dramatic pro forma increase


• What’s more worrisome, by comparing pre / post lease obligation footnotes in Echo’s financials, we find that its lease costs 
have ballooned by $2.7m - $3.0m per yr and a whopping $35m thereafter! Per Echo’s related party disclosure (Note 20) 
Command’s Skokie headquarters are leased at just $655,656/yr making it a massive cost dis-synergy!

Is Echo in Default of Its ABL Facility?


According to our read of Echo’s Asset Based Lending (ABL) agreement, it is not in compliance given the 


substantial operating lease arrangement exceeded $12.5m. Our suspicion coincides with Echo having dropped 


key language in its recent 10-Q that it was in compliance! 


• Echo entered into an ABL facility agreement on June 1, 2015 and can access $200m. YTD 2016, the ABL has been an important 
source of liquidity for Echo as it has borrowed and repaid $11m 


• The ABL facility defines “Indebtedness” as follows:


(h) all monetary obligations under any receivables factoring, receivable sales or similar transactions and the present value of all 
monetary obligations under any synthetic lease, tax ownership/operating lease, off-balance sheet financing or similar financing


• Under Article VII Negative Covenants


• 7.8 Indebtedness. Create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Indebtedness except in respect of: (s) additional unsecured 
Indebtedness not otherwise permitted hereunder not exceeding an aggregate principal amount of $12,500,000 at any one 
time outstanding


• To support our view that Echo is not in compliance with its ABL, we observe that language from its Q1 2016 10-Q (p.15) says that 
Echo was in compliance:


The terms of the ABL Facility include various covenants, including a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a consolidated 
fixed charge coverage ratio at any time (a) a specified default occurs or (b) if excess availability falls below certain specified levels. 
As of March 31, 2016, neither of the events that would require the Company to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio occurred,
and the Company is in compliance with all covenants related to the ABL.


 Now as of Echo’s recently filed Q2 2016 10-Q, it clearly omits the same paragraph and language stating that it is in compliance!

Echo Culture In the Words of its Employees


“Good People, Unsure Future” April 18, 2016
“Cons are management in the upper levels. For such a large 
company there are many processes in place that make no 
sense and make our jobs more difficult. The technology is 
quickly becoming dated, and the industry is changing but 


the company seems to not be:   Source


“The Truth” April 16, 2016


“The work is monotonous, the hours are long, and the base 
pay is weak. Hitting commission and making money are 


almost two different things entirely. There doesn't seem to 
be any development of talent in any department or at any 
level. To be successful at Echo seems less dependent on 


ability or work ethic and more so on your ability to outlast 
your peers. It is an unofficial company tradition to give a 


congratulatory round of applause when people quit... That 
kind of says it all.”  Source


“Toxic Management” April 7, 2016


“Executive leadership should listen up. You have a toxic culture 
brewing in the worst of places. You wonder why nepotism is 


repeatedly mentioned in our Glassdoor reviews? It's not helped 
when the team who should be driving our culture is the worst 
offender. You're being fooled. I've seen talented leaders leave 
our company because of favoritism and a lack of support from 


leadership. If we can't get it right on our own team, how can you 
possibly believe it's going to be successful throughout Echo? 
Start at the top and you'll find your biggest offender.”  Source


“Understand What It Is”- March 24, 2016


“Echo has had extreme difficulties with turnover. They are 
currently conducting lunch and learns where they provide 


employees who have been around more than a 1-2 years to ask 
why they have stayed. The number of employees with stay after 
year 1 is 40%. 40%! THIS IS A HORRIBLE RETENTION NUMBER…. 
On average most sales reps do not break through commission 
for a year and a half 2 years of time. You also are not paid until 


your customers pay, and companies who work with logistics 
companies are notorious for paying late. They do not tell you 


this, they dance around it because they know this is not 
competitive with there competitors.”  Source

SEC Comment No. 15


Investors may have difficulty understanding certain terms, such as “disrupt”, “disruptive”, and “disintermediate”, in the context in which they 
are used in this registration statement. Please revise to communicate these concepts using more commonly understood terminology.


Echo Response:


The Company has revised the prospectus to clarify the concepts of “disrupt,” “disruptive,” and “disintermediate” in the context in which they 
are used by using more commonly understood terminology.


Proprietary technology platform, page 3


SEC Comment No. 16


We note the last sentence on page 3. While it appears that your database expands if new clients and suppliers are added, it is unclear how 
increased volume (without new clients or suppliers) might also expand your database. Please revise to explain.


Echo Response:


The Company has revised the disclosure on pages 3 and 49 to reflect that its ETM database grows and becomes more difficult to replicate as 
the number of shipments increases and the amount of pricing, service and available capacity data increases.

Echo’s CEOs Touts Fancy Buzz Words


“I'm sure you're all familiar with that, so we'll move on and get to the company. So Echo is a relatively young 
company. We were founded in 2005. We had our IPO in 2009. We focus on third-party logistics, offering 
transportation management solutions in several channels. First is your traditional brokerage. We also have 
outsourcing capabilities. Where we're a contractual outsource partner for our customers, and then we have 
technology-as-a-service. We are aimed at being multimodal, so unlike many brokers that are fixed on a particular 
mode of transportation, we target small and mid-sized companies, and we think it's important to be a one-stop 
solution for them, so we strive to be a multimodal company.…..”


“On the technology front, our systems are all proprietary. And by the nature of what we do, they're fairly 
complex. We have the ability to do brokerage in multiple modes. We manage thousands of tariffs. We manage 
the pricing in the truckload market, which changes by the day, by the -- sometimes, by the hour, across tens of 
thousands of lanes. We have the execution capabilities to book shipments, to track them, to trace them, invoice 
them, pay our carriers. So essentially, our entire business is run using technology, and it's all proprietary. We use 
it on a Software-as-a-Service platform. So customers and carriers that use our system do not have to install any 
software, they simply use it through the Internet, through portals, and for many of our contractual customers, 
probably 95% of them will do direct ERP integration so that, as they're processing orders in their order 
management system, those shipments are coming over and queuing up in our system where they can be either 
auto-executed through algorithms or they can be put into a queue and manually worked by the account team.”

Stress Testing Echo’s 
Technology Advantage Claims


 Central to Echo’s Business Description and Positioning to Clients and Investors is its Technology Centric Focus:


Echo Global Logistics, Inc. ("the Company") is a leading provider of technology-enabled transportation and supply chain management 
services. These services are delivered on a proprietary technology platform that serves the transportation and logistics needs of the 
Company's clients


 Echo’s IPO story prominently featured its Enhanced Transportation Management (ETM) System, Now It’s Defunct/Re-Branded:


 According to our research, Echo quietly eliminated all discussion of ETM in its financial filings in early 2014. 
 Echo began touting “Optimizer” in early 2015 and says in its 10-K p.4, “Our proprietary technology platform ("Optimizer") is 


fundamental to our operating system and solutions offering. We run our business on a technology platform engineered and built from 
the ground up and believe its proprietary nature differentiates us from our competition in a number of critical ways.” 


 Echo’s Technology Unlikely To Be Unique or Easily Protected:


 Echo’s technology, while “proprietary,” is not patented. Almost all of Echo’s competitors claim they have “proprietary” technologies 
 Given the movement of people across companies in the industry, it is very likely that the technology is not unique. The lawsuit from 


CH Robinson (who acquired American Backhaulers) against founders of Command Transportation (founded by same individual) 
claiming they misappropriated key code and technology underscores the risk of losing key technological edge


 Insider Views and Turnover at the Chief Technology Officer Position is Quite Telling…


 Echo has churned through five (5) Chief Technology Officers since 2005, and now has changed the role to Chief “Information” Officer
 Recent Glassdoor.com reviews of the technology function stress the problems and challenges associated with it
 As discussed earlier, Echo has not made any recent stock option grants, a traditional tool for luring top technology talent
 Compounding Echo’s problems are the recent movement toward “Ubertization” of trucking which is luring younger tech talent


In our view, Echo’s technology claims are more likely centered on driving a higher share valuation, and are 


less likely to form any competitive or sustainable advantage in its industry

Questionable New “Optimizer” Technology


When opened in Google Chrome, Echo’s new “Optimizer” has a webpage with a warning that says “Certain 


Optimizer features may not display or function properly in the current browser.”


According to W3Counter, Google Chrome is by far the most dominant web browser and gaining market share, which 


begs the question why Echo has not optimized its technology for the world’s top web browser!

CIO revamping transportation system as ‘killer app’


Kutz is directing the company’s 110 IT staff to build the “killer app.” That means refactoring the company’s proprietary transportation 
system so that it can adapt to new business models or respond to dynamic market changes. “The ability to change at will is my strategic 
imperative,” he says. To do that, Echo Global needs to trim software development lifecycle time for new features and functionality from 
three months to four to six weeks. For example, if a shipper requires better visibility into how their shipments are being tracked, Echo 
Global must deliver that change more quickly. That requires new IT processes and aggressive project management, largely in the 
company’s engineering practices.  Source: CIO Sept 24, 2015


Echo’s Chief Technology Officer role is a revolving door. The latest appointment is now called Chief 


“Information” Officer. Mr. Kutz recent interview claiming to build a “killer app” appears to be the latest 


iteration of the Echo technology hype machine….

Echo’s Technology Edge Likely Gone


American Backhaulers


• Acquired by CH Robinson (CHRW) in Nov 1999 for $100m cash and $36m of stock, American Backhaulers was an asset-light 3rd party 
transportation provider with net revenues of ~$38.3m and adjusted operating income of ~$9.5m


• Founded by Paul Loeb in 1981 and joined by Jeff Silver EVP
• According to Loeb, “We're excited about sharing our tools and technology with the entire Robinson network.“ 


Loeb Later Founded Command Transportation. CHRW Sues Loeb and Command Transport for Fraud: 


• Allegations include that Loeb and co-defendant Harrison (CHRW Director of Technology) misappropriated key source code, proprietary 
technology and know-how behind CHRW’s Express software, violated a non-compete and solicited CHRW employees


• Echo announced is intention to acquire Command in April 2015 for $420m. In 2014, Command had $102m and $37m in Net Revenue and 
Adjusted EBITDA


• Commenting on the transaction ECHO CEO Waggoner "Together with Command, we will significantly enhance our national scale and 
density in the highly fragmented TL market. We will also leverage the unique technology of both companies to continue offering best-in-
class services and comprehensive solutions that make our companies the provider of choice for our respective clients”      


Loeb’s Former Partner Jeff Silver Founds Coyote Logistics and Sells it to UPS


• After leaving CHRW, Mr. Silver left to study supply chain and logistics at MIT and received his MBA. Mr. Silver later founded Coyote 
Logistics in 2006 with the backing of Warburg Pincus


• According to Mr Silver, he hired several former MIT classmates at Coyote. Mr. Silver says the math and technology they employ has 
helped win some key accounts, including Heineken


• In July 2015, UPS announced it would acquire Coyote for $1.8 billion, allowing it to acquire the largest asset-light truckload brokerage 
company. Coyote had revenues of $2.1 billion


Echo acquired Command Transportation in June 2015. Command’s founder Loeb also founded American 


Backhaulers with Jeff Silver, which was acquired by CH Robinson. Silver later founded Coyote Logistics, and sold 


it to UPS in July 2015. It’s very unlikely that Echo’s technology is still proprietary and capable of competing 


against the likes of UPS and C.H. Robinson!

Insider Views on Echo’s Technology


“Completely Outdated Technology Platform Found Matching Outdated New CIO”


• IT Management team is out of touch with reality.
• Clueless senior IT leadership team and outdated CIO must catch up with modern IT world. Leadership is not about being in 


charge. Leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.
• Lack of direction and keep changing priorities.
• CIO mindset is consultants are going to fix all problems.
• His actions and words don’t match.


Source: Glassdoor: July 19, 2015


“Avoid at All Costs”


“More general issues, they try to call themselves a technology company but they are severely lacking. software is not strong, releases 
seem to be to fix problems and never actually create anything. Terrible base pay, long road to commissions, a laughable 401k plan.”


Source: Glassdoor: April 19, 2015


“IT Department Downhill Spiral”


“IT Management consists of people that are baked in and comfortable at their job. They don't care about the engineers or about their 
careers. There is no formal training given or encouraged - you have to be proactive to learn on your own. With the new CIO, the 
mentality is that you are replaceable by consultants unless you are in management or enterprise architect. Consultants are brought in 
for quick wins instead of helping to staff a team. Some teams consist of one or two engineers doing the work for four people while 
other teams have six people doing the work of two. Favoritism is rampant like consultant being brought on full time and promoted to 
director or senior engineer promoted to enterprise architect. Decision on what technology to use keeps changing. Management 
cannot support or stick to one decision which in turn wastes company money and time.”

Uberization of Trucking Technology Set 
To Disrupt Echo and Others


Uber and its location based app technology has disrupted traditional transportation businesses such as car 


rental and taxi/limo companies by empowering drivers to supply car capacity, and offer users more options 


often at lower prices.  The concept of “Uber for Trucking” is analogous and may be giving rise to deflationary 


pricing as start-ups seek to undercut traditional brokers such as Echo.  


Uberization of Trucking Offers Many Advantages to the Market 


• For carriers, benefits could include lower operating costs, increased loaded miles (wasted downtime), higher revenues (due to less 
brokerage fees), better fuel efficiency and asset utilization, more transparency, and reduced admin / paperwork costs


• On the shipper side, larger app-based marketplaces should give small shippers more access to ready capacity, at price points that they 
can more easily control. Large shippers, on the other hand, should be better able to manage exception freight that falls outside of their 
typical contract agreements, such as freight surges prior to holiday


According to a Frost & Sullivan Study (Uber for Trucks: Executive Analysis, May 2016)


• Believes that the Uber model for trucking is poised to revolutionize freight mobility
• Mobile based freight brokerage generates ~$100m in revenues. By 2025, the mobile freight market is expected to grow at a compound 


annual growth rate of 74.65% and generate $26.4bn in revenue for the entire market. Estimated that by 2025, 16% of 3PL will be 
enabled through mobile platforms


• “Mobile-based freight brokers are strategizing to grow their network by offering as much value as possible for free to customers on 
their apps. In addition to strengthening their freight brokering capabilities, mobile-based freight brokers are bundling transportation 
management solutions together to attract customers”


According to an Oliver Wyman recent study: (Uber Trucking is on its Way, 2016)


“Many of the new trucking apps are being developed by non-traditional technology companies with brokerage authority, and these are 
looking to increase their appeal by undercutting the middleman fees charged by traditional freight brokers, while offering more 
comprehensive solutions. Thus much like the taxi industry, which is now fighting back against ride sharing with its own streamlined apps 
(such as Hailo and Arro), traditional truck freight brokers will need to embrace “uberization” as well – or risk being displaced entirely.”

Echo’s Early Backer Now Investing in 
Competitors to Disrupt Echo!


Transfix Raises $22M Series B to Disrupt Freight Brokering; Led by NEA
Company has built online marketplace for the trucking and logistics industry


NEW YORK, July 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Transfix, the leading provider of on-
demand trucking that some have called "Uber for trucks," today announced $22 
million in Series B funding led by new investor New Enterprise Associates 
(NEA). NY-based Transfix has created an online marketplace for the trucking and 
logistics industry, providing a platform that matches shipments with available 
trucks. Several existing investors also participated in the round, including Canvas 
Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, and Corigin Ventures. The new funding will 
go toward continued investment in technology and expanded product offerings 
to meet customer demand.


Transfix is focused on the full truckload (FTL) market, which is a $420 billion 
market each year in the U.S. alone. Transfix reduces the amount of "empty 
miles" driven by truckers with algorithms that match freight with trucks based 
on location and in real-time. Its solution yields significant savings for shippers 
and increased pay for truck drivers.


The company also gives free technology to its users in the form of tools 
catered specifically to them. Drivers get a mobile app (iOS & Android) that 
allows them to easily communicate load details and other features. Trucking 
companies get a free FMS (Fleet Management System) to manage their drivers 
and streamline their business. Shippers get a dashboard with real time 
shipment locations, alerts, and customized analytics. Transfix has created a 
marketplace that provides considerable value for drivers, carriers, and shippers.


Source: Transfix Press Release


NEA understands the freight brokering market well given its historic investment in Echo. It is reasonable to 


assume that it believes new technology players such as Transfix can displace parts of Echo’s business.


New Enterprise Associates initially backed Echo Global 
and invested in 2006 according to its website


• According to Echo’s IPO Prospectus, in June 2006, Echo 
issued 3,129,496 shares of Series D preferred stock 
(after giving effect to the one-for-two reverse stock 
split), or approximately 18.0% of its current equity 
interests on a fully-diluted basis, to New Enterprise 
Associates 12, Limited Partnership, NEA Ventures 2006, 
Limited Partnership, the Younes & Soraya Nazarian 
Revocable Trust and Anthony R. Bobulinski in exchange 
for $17.4 million in cash, or $5.56 per share


• NEA beneficially ownership was 15.3% of Echo at its 
2009 IPO


• NEA’s last reported beneficial ownership of 6.3% was on 
4/30/12. By the following proxy, NEA reported no 
ownership

Technology Disruption in Small Parcel


According to Crunchbase, Shyp has raised $62m and is a new and credible threat in small parcel shipping

says “Material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode, including small parcel, could 


have a significant impact on our net revenue.” (1)

Echo’s Prior Failure in Mobile App 
Development….


CEO Waggoner Response When Asked About the Uberization Effect Oct 28, 2015


“Well, look, first of all, we consider ourselves a strong technology company, and we invest heavily in it, and we keep our eye 
on the trends in the emerging technologies and the emerging players. That being said, it is a market, where having customers 
matters, having capacity matters, having relationship matters, having working capital matters. And so we have all those 
things and we have the technology. And whether or not a new entrant can make a new marketplace, I think, remains to be 
seen, because you've got to have those other ingredients that I already mentioned. But we're keeping eye on it, we intend to 
look around the corner at every bend, and we're continuing to invest in our new technology. And I think we'll be fine.”


EchoTrak Mobile Launches on the Apple iOS and 
Google Android Platforms, Enabling Users to Easily 
Manage Shipments on the Go


CHICAGO, July 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Echo 
Global Logistics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ECHO), a leading provider 
of technology enabled transportation and supply chain 
management services, today announced the launch of 
EchoTrak Mobile, the company's first-ever free mobile 
app. EchoTrak Mobile allows supply chain managers to 
easily track and manage shipments with any Apple 
iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch devices and Google's 
Android phone and tablet platforms.

In our opinion, Echo’s CEO has a false sense of optimism that his company can fend off emerging tech 


competitors, especially given Echo’s prior failure developing an mobile app in 2011!

Amazon: The Elephant In the Room


• Amazon has taken steps to broaden its profile in the transportation sector for the first time in its 10-K SEC filing in Jan 2016, referenced its 
role as a transportation service provider:


• “Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including 
Prime Video and Prime Music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping 
costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our 
inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.”


• Amazon has began leasing Boeing planes with ATSG and later Atlas Air to create an Air Cargo Network


• Amazon has “hundreds of Ph.D. mathematicians” who spend their days optimizing logistics; “It’s just one giant math exercise,” a Deutsche 
Bank analyst recently wrote (See Next Slide For How Many Ph.D’s Echo Employs)


• Others believe that Amazon will make a business out of its delivery network, as it did with Amazon Web Services, thereby challenging 
the world’s leading shipping companies. “I fully expect Amazon to build out a logistics supply chain that others can use,” says John Rossman, 
a former Amazon executive who’s now a managing director at the restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal. “Over the next five years? I doubt it. 
Over 10 or 15 years? Oh yeah.”


• UPS and FedEx have shrugged off Amazon’s threat to their business, in public anyway. On a conference call in February, UPS CEO David 
Abney was diplomatic: “Amazon’s a good customer of ours. We have a mutually beneficial relationship.” In an investor call the following 
month, FedEx CEO Fred Smith scoffed at the notion that Amazon might challenge his company, calling it “fantastical.” Lieb, the Northeastern 
professor, who’s been talking to CEOs in the shipping industry for 23 years, says they’re less confident in private. “When Amazon was 
talking about same-day delivery, people said, ‘Who cares? We don’t want that business anyway,’ ” Lieb says. But once Amazon began leasing 
planes, they started to worry. “Amazon’s market entry strategy has pretty much been ‘I’m going to come in and I’m going to beat you to 
death with low prices,’ ” he says. “If Amazon follows that tactic, they would destabilize this industry rather quickly.”


• The fear has spread to Wall Street, where analysts say investors worry about what Amazon’s strategy means for the shipping industry.
“The natural inclination among any observers of the market when they see Amazon is to be scared,” says David Vernon, a Sanford C. 
Bernstein analyst who tracks the shipping market. “Amazon is the epitome of a zero-sum game.”


Source: “Will Amazon Kill FedEx? - Bloomberg, August 31, 2016


Some industry observers expect Amazon to ultimately move into the logistics sector, and could offer its supply 


chain services to third parties. Given Amazon’s scale and focus on low prices, this could force substantial margin 


compression on traditional and 3rd party logistics providers.

New Management Compensation 
Scheme Is Worrisome


Shareholders should be cautioned that 1) Management’s targeted annual cash incentive bonus has been steadily 
rising recently, and 2) Management recently stated paying itself special bonuses tied to closing acquisitions. Three 
executives collected a total of $470,000 to complete the Command acquisition. 


We believe shareholders should be cautioned when executives tie bonuses to deal-making. We recently noted the 
extraordinary bonus that Intertain’s management paid itself for Gamesys. For an acquisitive company like Echo, we 
don’t believe management should be paid extraordinary bonuses for executing its stated business strategy .

Evidence Suggesting Lapses in 
Financial Due Diligence Processes


Echo’s acquisition due diligence process needs to be questioned given its history of being duped when it touted the 


acquisition of Shipper Direct 2012. Echo later admitted on Feb 7, 2013 that internal control weakness existed (8k)


Echo Global Logistics, Inc. Acquires Shipper Direct Logistics


CHICAGO, July 26, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Echo Global 


Logistics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ECHO), a leading provider of technology-


enabled transportation and supply chain management services, has 


acquired substantially all of the assets of Shipper Direct Logistics, Inc. 


("Shipper Direct"), a truckload transportation brokerage located in

business as Echo Global Logistics, Inc. Founded in 1989 by Billy and 


Angela Suddarth, Shipper Direct is a non-asset based transportation 


service provider that specializes in truckload solutions for the 


Southeastern and South Central United States. With this acquisition, 


Echo expands its sales organization, and customer and carrier

track record of servicing mid-sized and larger shippers. The 


company will also contribute to our network of strong carrier 


relationships," said Douglas R. Waggoner, Chief Executive Officer of 


Echo Global Logistics. Waggoner continued, "We believe the Shipper 


Direct team fits well with the Echo culture, while bringing 


experience and talent to help the combined companies 


grow." "Shipper Direct is excited to join the Echo team," said Billy

sales support and service offering that Echo offers will enable us to 


increase our market share and the level of service we deliver to clients."

Presidents. Echo has retained the entire Shipper Direct workforce in

Former Owner Of Tennessee Company Indicted On Federal Fraud 


Charges Relating To $9 Million Corporate Transaction


May 28, 2015:  Angela M. Suddarth, 51, of Orlando, Florida and 


previously of Goodlettsville, Tennessee, was indicted yesterday by 


a federal grand jury on fraud charges relating to the sale of a 


transportation brokerage company, announced David Rivera, United 


States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.  The 22-count 


indictment charges Suddarth with wire fraud, mail fraud, money 


laundering, aggravated identity theft, perjury, bankruptcy fraud, and 


making a false statement to a federal agency. According to the 


indictment, Suddarth owned Shipper Direct Logistics, a 


transportation brokerage company based in Hendersonville, 


Tennessee.  In 2012, Suddarth entered into an agreement to sell her 


transportation brokerage assets to Echo Global Logistics, a public 


company based in Chicago, Illinois, for approximately $9 million.  In 


connection with this transaction, Suddarth fraudulently inflated revenue 


figures and provided false and fabricated financial reports and 


information to Echo Global Logistics.  Suddarth also falsely represented 


that the financial information had been prepared by a Certified Public 


Accountant and fabricated emails to appear that information had been 


sent by the Certified Public Accountant.   The indictment also charges 


Suddarth with causing a fabricated email that appeared to come from an 


employee of Echo Global Logistics to be submitted to a U.S. Department 


of Labor investigator, although no such email was ever actually sent.  In 


addition, the indictment charges Suddarth with making false statements 


in a sworn affidavit submitted in connection with a federal civil lawsuit 


and with lying on a bankruptcy petition by falsely stating that she had not 


earned any income in 2011, 2012, or 2013.

Echo Becoming More Dependent on 
Outside Capital to Fund Itself…


While continuing to use cash inefficiently, Echo has become much more dependent on short-term financing 


in recent years through borrowings on its line of credit and new asset-based lending facility (ABL).

Echo’s Comp Committee Lauds Management, 
Fails to Acknowledge Failure


Investors need to question the governance of Echo. In its proxy statement discussing 2012 results, the 


compensation committee rewarded management handsomely and failed to even acknowledge the Shipper Direct 


debacle but pointed to two “successfully integrated” companies. In fact, the entire proxy failed to acknowledge 


Echo’s material weakness in its financial controls in the audit committee report.  


2012 Proxy Statement
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 


In 2012, the Company reached several financial milestones. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 
2012 was $757.7 million compared to $602.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, 
representing a 25.7% increase. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company achieved 
Company Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") of $29.7 million 
compared to EBITDA of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, representing a 8% 
increase. In arriving at the 2012 EBITDA used to compute the non-equity incentive pay of our named 
executive officers, the Compensation Committee removed certain items it did not deem as routine 
operating costs. In 2012, the Company achieved $31.8 million in adjusted EBITDA (as defined in "-
Annual Cash Incentives" below), representing a 17% increase from 2011. In addition to the financial 
growth, the Company also acquired and successfully integrated two companies in 2012. As a result of 
the 2012 performance of the Company, our named executive officers, Douglas R. Waggoner and David 
B. Menzel earned non-equity incentive plan compensation of $150,000 and $86,460, respectively. Mr. 
Menzel earned an additional bonus of $88,540 as a result of additional operating responsibilities 
carried out in 2012 that contributed to improved financial performance.

Is Echo Management Gaming The 
Cash Bonus Targets?


Performance Goals. Consistent with our performance-based approach, and given the broader responsibilities of 
our named executive officers, the annual incentive compensation for our named executive officers is partially 
based on the Company’s net revenue (60% of Company performance component) and partially based on overall 
Company adjusted EBITDA (40% of Company performance component).  For 2015, the Company achieved $67.8 
million in adjusted EBITDA.  This adjusted EBITDA figure was further adjusted for the impact of 2015 integration 
costs.  The cumulative impact of this adjustment, related to the 2015 integration costs, was a $2.3 million 
increase to our 2015 adjusted EBITDA.  As a result, for 2015, the Company achieved adjusted EBITDA of $70.1 
million, compared to a target of $68.0 million.  This adjusted EBITDA met 103.1% of the adjusted EBITDA target, 
and was paid out at 147.2% of target payout.  The Company achieved net revenue of $290.3 million, compared to 
a target of $290.1 million.  This net revenue met 100.0% of the net revenue target, and was paid out at 100.8% of 
target payout.    In addition, each of the named executive officers achieved 100% of their individual performance 
objectives.  This assessment of individual performance for the named executive officers was based on the 
Compensation Committee’s determination that each executive made significant contributions to the performance 
and growth of the Company in 2015. 


Source: ECHO 2016 Proxy Statement


Convenient “adjustment” on top of a 2015 Adjusted EBITDA target that fell short by $0.2m 


allowed management to beat its 2015 target and pay itself a handsome bonus. Furthermore, 


the revenue target was also narrowly exceeded by $0.2m….statistical fluke?

Evidence Suggesting 
Financial and Accounting Issues
65


Summary of Accounting Concerns


Concern Evidence


Growing Rift Between GAAP and 
Non-GAAP results


Empirical and irrefutable evidence. The rift grew meaningfully after the Command Transportation when 
Echo intentionally made changes to its adjusted results


Rapid Escalation in Audit Fees
Echo’s audit fees have grown 41% p.a. in the past 3 years, substantially faster than peers. On a per 


employee and % of revenues basis, its audit fees are substantial outliers


History of Material Weakness of 
Internal Financial Controls


Echo touted the acquisition of Shipper Direct in 2012 for ~$10m. It later disclosed that it had been 
defrauded by the sellers and impaired the assets. Echo claims to have remedied the control deficiency in 


2013, but we remain skeptical given the collection of issues noted herein


Potential Revenue Recognition Issues
Groupon restated revenues pre-IPO. Echo quietly made changes to its revenue disclosures and presentation 
shortly thereafter. In our opinion, after reviewing Echo’s Terms of Service for its business and newly clarified 


FASB accounting guidance, it appears clearer Echo’s accounting treatment seems problematic


Intangible Amortization Policies
Every single year, Echo has inexplicably increased estimated useful lives for its intangible assets. Recently, it 
re-allocated $20.6m from intangibles to goodwill from the Command deal, artificially boosting its EPS by at 


least $0.12 cents 


Earn-Out Accounting


Echo has been running contingent payments for acquisitions as financing cash flows, and not breaking out 
amounts related to changes in performance and time value. From an analytical viewpoint, we believe 


investors should consider these as investment cash flows, and be used to assess Echo’s efficacy as a roll-up 
strategy to achieve operating leverage (we believe it does not) 


Abnormally Low Bad Debts
Allowance for doubtful of accounts as a % of gross receivables has contracted every single year, and 


bottomed at just 0.38% in Q3’15; industry peer average stands at 1.5% of gross receivable. Therefore, there 
is a strong possibility that Echo is artificially inflating its earnings by under-reserving for bad accounts. 


When taken together as a whole, the plethora of problems we’ve identified at Echo suggest that investors 


should be very cautious about investing.

Investors should be cautioned that Echo’s audit fees have risen substantially in the past few years, at rate far 


in excess of industry peers. As a % of net revenues and on a per employee basis, Echo’s audit fees are 


extreme outliers to all of its larger peers. Academic research finds that It is not uncommon for auditors to 


increase audit fees when the perceived risk of, or existence of internal control deficiencies, are present. (1)

GAAP Non-GAAP Delta


Widening Rift Between GAAP and 
Non-GAAP Results Is Worrisome


Source: Press Releases and Conference Calls


Rapid signs of earnings quality deterioration is evident in Echo’s recent earnings reports. As can be 


seen from the chart below, the delta between GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings has grown steadily since 


2012 (the year it was ‘defrauded’ by Shipper Direct). In 2015 Echo sold investors on Non-GAAP EPS of 


$1.16 [ $1.25 ex: deal costs(1) ] vs. $0.28 on a GAAP basis. In Q2’15 investors were rattled when the 


CFO announced a plethora of financial presentation changes.


(1): On the quarterly earnings conf calls, management has repeatedly tried to justify further adjustments to 
Non-GAAP EPS results by including add-backs for Command integration expenses. These additional 
adjustments are not reflected in the chart


CFO Kyle Sauers on Q2’15 Conf Call


“Given the significance of the Command acquisition and our 
recent capital raise, we've modified the way we're presenting 
our non-GAAP earnings per share to provide better 
information around the ongoing operations of our business. We 
continue to exclude deal cost associated with M&A activity, 
and in Q2, this includes a onetime cost for the unused term 
loan commitments associated with the Command acquisition; 
and we also continue to exclude any changes in contingent 
consideration payable to sellers of our previous acquisitions


“We're now also excluding all the non-cash expense 
associated with stock compensation programs. The most 
significant of these is the restricted stock that was issued as 
part of the Command acquisition. Amortization of intangibles 
associated with acquisitions are now excluded from non-
GAAP presentations as well.”


“And the coupon carry on our recently issued convertible debt 
is 2.5%; however, GAAP dictates that an additional non-cash 
charge be taken as interest expense in addition to that coupon 
payment. In Echo's case, approximately 3.25% incremental 
above the 2.5% coupon will apply, and so for non-GAAP 
purposes, we'll be excluding this non-cash charge.”


Alarming Delta Between Echo’s GAAP and Non-GAAP Results

Ballooning Command Integration Costs


Echo’s results continue to generally disappoint. In Q2’16 Echo reported quarterly Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27c and 


missed expectations of $0.32c or -16% below expectations (1). Echo called out $3.1m of Command integration 


costs or $0.06 cents per share to conveniently “beat” expectations by $0.01 cent. (2) At times, Echo’s


Command integration costs have not even reconciled among public statements (3). 


We believe investors should be highly cautioned about Echo’s earnings quality given escalating integration 


costs, and now mysterious and unexplained cost synergies announced in Q2’16.

Reduced Transparency: Echo Stops

David B. Menzel - President & Chief Operating Officer:  “So I think on the managed – or enterprise client counts, we've decided that that 
metric, as we've gotten bigger and that's a smaller part of our business, just doesn't really make sense to continue to update and disclose. 
We've signed, I think, 10 new clients in the quarter, so we continue to add clients, high renewals rates. But we decided that was just kind of 
getting to be extra information that wasn't necessary to the – really driving the financial results. So we have kind of backed off on disclosing 
that. I think transactional clients were – there's no reason we can't disclose that.”    Source:  Q2’2015 Conference Call

When Echo came public, its prospectus touted its fast growing “enterprise” clients and stated the following: 


“We typically enter into multi-year contracts with our enterprise clients, which are often on an exclusive basis 


for a specific transportation mode or point of origin.” In Spruce Point’s opinion, Echo touted this segment to 


receive a higher valuation, since investors value companies higher that have long-term contractual cash 


flows. Echo has never regularly disclosed renewal rates in its SEC filings despite the COOs discussion below.

Cash Flow Statement Presentation Issues


Source: Press Releases and Conference Calls


Echo makes use of earnout and other deal structures whereby they acquire, but pay later for the business. 


This allows them to flow subsequent payments through the “financing” section of the cash flow statement. 


From an analytical point of view, Spruce Point believes they should be viewed as investment cash flows, and 


be used to evaluate the total cost of its M&A roll-up strategy.
75


The SEC Has Been Scrutinizing Earnout 
Accounting Issues


Note: MDC’s response counter argument as to why its accounting treatment is correct
E&Y guidance “Statement of Cash Flows” June 2015


Earnout accounting leaves significant discretion for management to make assumptions on post-deal 


closing performance that affects earnings and cash flow presentation. There is evidence to suggest 


the SEC has been looking into the accounting classification for contingent payments linked to M&A 


transactions due to time value. For example, it recently questioned MDC Partners on its use of 


accounting techniques that resulted in the SEC requesting reclassification of portions of payments as 


operating cash flows. Echo also does not bifurcate contingent payments per SEC guidance noted 


below. Echo’s current accounting may be misleading because its operating cash flow reflects all the 


benefits from improvements in performance of acquired companies, but none of the costs!


SEC Correspondence to MDC:  May 9, 2014


“With regard to the “Acquisition related payments” line item under financing activities, please tell us the 
payment amounts attributable to the initial estimated present value of the underlying obligations recorded 
at the acquisition dates, the accretion of present value and changes in fair value”


SEC Correspondence to MDC:  June 13, 2014


“We note your response to comment 3. We note that payment amounts attributable to the accretion of 
present value and changes in fair value are recorded as an expense in the statement of operations. 
Accordingly, please reclassify the component of acquisition related payments attributable to changes in fair 
value and accretions of present value under operating activities”

Questionable Accounting: Aggressive 
Customer Relationship Amortization


Almost every year, Echo has inflated its assumptions for customer relationship useful lives and other intangibles which 


enables understatement of Amortization Expense, and overstatement of Net Income.  This assumption does not appear 


reasonable given that its business mix has moved towards more spot transactions and away from managed transportation


“Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships, carrier relationships, noncompete agreements and trade names, which are being amortized on an 
accelerated basis over their estimated weighted-average useful lives of 14.8 years, 17.0 years, 6.7 years and 4.0 years, respectively.” 2015 10-K p. 25


“The Company's intangible assets consist of customer relationships, noncompete agreements, and trade names, which are being amortized on an 
accelerated basis over their estimated weighted-average useful lives of 9 years, 3 years and 3 years, respectively.”  2013 10-K, p.23


“The Company's intangible assets consist of customer relationships, noncompete agreements, and trade names, which are being amortized on the straight-
line basis over their estimated weighted-average useful lives of 6 years, 3 years and 3 years, respectively.” 2009 10-K, p 42


“The Company's intangible assets consist of customer relationships, noncompete agreements, and trade names, which are being amortized on the straight-
line basis over their estimated weighted-average useful lives of 5 years, 10 months and 3 years, respectively.”  S-1, p. F-11

Questionable Accounting: Aggressive 
Customer Relationship Amortization


The aggressiveness of Echo’s customer relationship amortization assumptions become much clear when comparing them 


with Command’s assumptions. As indicated below, Command assumed a 7 year useful life whereas Echo assumes 17 years!

Echo moved its initial estimate of $146m of intangible assets to $125.4m thereby avoiding $20.6m of intangible 
assets that would have been subject to amortization. The difference was allocated to goodwill which does not 
impact EPS.(1) In addition, Echo boosted useful life assumptions amongst all categories and as a result reduced 
annual amortization expense by $5.8m (EPS benefit of $0.12c /share at 38% tax rate and 29.5m shares)

Echo’s Allowance For Doubtful Acct’s Fall to Record Low Despite Inclusion of Command on June 1st, 2015


Another area of concern is Echo’s accounting for bad debts. We note that during 2015, its allowance for doubtful 


accounts hit an all time low of 0.38% of gross receivables. This % fell despite the inclusion of Command which 


reserved 1.3% and was consolidated on June 1, 2015. Based on an industry peer average analysis, we find that 


Echo’s competitors reserve 1.5% of gross receivable (1). Therefore, there is a strong possibility that Echo is 


artificially inflating its earnings by under reserving for bad accounts. 


(1) Based on FY 2015 results for C.H. Robinson, Expeditors, Landstar, XPO Logistics, HUB Group, and Forward Air


Command’s allowance account rose 
during the acquisition period, and 
stood at 1.3% of gross receivables

Potential Revenue Accounting Issues


Source: 2009 and 2010 10-K filings


Echo quietly changed reporting from “Gross Profit” to “Net Revenue” – potentially as a result of 


the SEC’s scrutiny over Groupon’s revenue recognition policies. In its S-1 IPO filing Echo said, “Gross 


profit is the primary indicator of our ability to procure services provided by carriers and other third-parties 


and is considered by management to be the primary measurement of our growth.”

Echo’s Revenue Recognition


Source: S-1 filings, p. 35 and 2015 10-K, Revenue Recognition description , p. 25


Echo stopped disclosing how much revenue is booked as “fee for service” vs. on a gross basis after the filing 


of its S-1. These fee for services were initially discussed as tied to enterprise arrangements (and Echo also 


later stopped disclosing enterprise customers) and small parcel. However, Echo still discusses the booking of 


revenue as fee for service in the discussion of its revenue recognition policies


Critical Accounting Policies,  Revenue Recognition


In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605-20 Revenue Recognition - Services, 
transportation revenue and related transportation costs are recognized when the shipment has been delivered by a 
third-party carrier. Fee for service revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered. At the time of delivery 
or rendering of services, as applicable, our obligation to fulfill a transaction is complete and collection of revenue is 
reasonably assured.

Echo’s Revenue Recognition


Echo books a majority of its revenue under the “gross basis” as opposed to a net basis similar to a 


commission arrangement. Its main justification is that it bears the risks and benefits associated with 


the revenue generating activities. Our analysis will call these claims into question.


Critical Accounting Policies,  Revenue Recognition


In accordance with ASC Topic 605-45 Revenue Recognition - Principal Agent Considerations, we generally 
recognize revenue on a gross basis, as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement, because 
we bear the risks and benefits associated with revenue-generated activities by, among other things: (1) acting as 
a principal in the transaction; (2) establishing prices; (3) managing all aspects of the shipping process, including 
selection of the carrier; and (4) taking the risk of loss for collection, delivery, and returns. Certain transactions to 
provide specific services are recorded at the net amount charged to the client due to the following key factors: 
(a) we do not have latitude in establishing pricing; and (b) we have credit risk for only the net revenue earned 
from our client while the carrier has credit risk for the transportation costs. Net revenue equals revenue minus 
transportation costs.

Echo Terms of Service Suggest Its Revenue 
Recognition Policies Problematic


Source: Echo Terms and Conditions


Read the fine print!! Echo’s own Terms of Service calls into question its role and liability in the 


transaction. It even states clearly it is just a freight broker.  A broker is synonymous with agent.


ECHO will attempt to assist in the resolution of freight claims, but has no responsibility or liability related to any claim. All freight cargo claims should be 
submitted immediately to ECHO to help ensure timely resolution.  If the loss or damage is apparent, the consignee must note such loss or damage 
information on the bill of lading/delivery receipt.  If the loss or damage is not apparent (concealed), the Customer must contact Echo within 3 days after 
taking delivery.  The filing of a claim does not relieve the responsible party for payment of freight charges. Freight payment is necessary in order for a 
carrier to process a claim


ECHO is not liable for any loss, late-delivery, non-delivery, or consequential damages caused by the act, default or omission of the carrier, Customer or 
any other party who claims interest in the shipment, or caused by the nature of the shipment or any defect thereof. ECHO is not liable for losses, late-
delivery or non-delivery caused by violation(s) by the Customer of any of the TERMS AND CONDITIONS contained in the Bill of Lading or of the carrier's 
General Rules Tariff including, but not limited to, improper or insufficient packing, securing, marking or addressing, or of failure to observe any of the rules 
relating to shipments not acceptable for transportation or shipments acceptable only under certain conditions. ECHO is not liable for losses, late delivery or 
non-delivery caused by the acts of God, perils of the air, public enemies, public authorities, acts or omissions of Customs or quarantine officials, war, riots, 
strikes, labor disputes, weather conditions or mechanical delay or failure of aircraft or other equipment. ECHO is not liable for failure to comply with 
delivery or other instructions from the Customer or for the acts or omissions of any person other than employees of ECHO.  Subject to the limitations of 
liability contained in the Bill of Lading and the carrier's General Rules Tariff, ECHO shall only be liable for loss, damage, mis-delivery or non-delivery caused 
by ECHO's own gross negligence. ECHO's liability therefore shall be limited to the fees that ECHO has earned with respect to the subject shipment.  


ECHO MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH REGARD TO DELIVERIES OR WITH REGARD TO THIS WEBSITE, INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEBSITE OR SERVICES 
RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS CONDUCTED ON THIS WEBSITE. ECHO CANNOT GUARANTEE DELIVERY BY ANY SPECIFIC TIME OR DATE. IN ANY EVENT, ECHO 
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR INCOME, 
WHETHER OR NOT ECHO HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT BE INCURRED.  


Echo is only a freight broker. Echo is not a freight carrier as it does not transport cargo. Therefore, regardless of the terms and conditions of the freight 
carrier that performs the transportation services for the customer, Echo’s liability shall be at most equal to the liability of the freight carrier, but under no 
circumstances shall it exceed the limitations of liability set forth in these TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  These TERMS AND CONDITIONS, however, shall not 
serve to affect or limit the liability of the freight carrier performing the transportation services for the Customer.  Instead, the terms and conditions of the 
freight carrier shall control the rights and responsibilities between the Customer and the Freight Carrier.  If you have any questions regarding carrier 
insurance or carrier liability, please contact ECHO for more details.

In Our Opinion, Latest FASB Guidance on 
Gross vs. Net Clarifies Our Position


(1) Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Principal vs. Agent Considerations, March 2016. FASB states very clearly the following, “Topic 606 requires the entity to determine whether the nature of 
its promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (that is, the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (that is, the entity 
is an agent). This determination is based upon whether the entity controls the good or the service before it is transferred to the customer.


To Echo’s defense, there has historically been some interpretation and judgement required in determining 


net vs. gross revenue recognition. However, in March 2016 the FASB recently finalized amendments to the 


guidance on the topic, making it clearer in our opinion, that Echo acts as an agent and not as principal. (1)  


Echo Says of its 
Revenue Recognition


FASB Says Our View


We act as a principal in 
the transaction


Indicators that an entity is a principal and controls the 
transaction include primary responsibility for fulfilling 


the promise to provide the customer the good or 
service, inventory risk, and discretion in setting prices


Echo’s Terms of Service suggests the 
responsibility falls on the carrier, who is liable 


for delivery losses, lateness, damages etc. 


We take the risk of loss 
for collection, delivery, 


and returns


FASB does not focus on the risks Echo mentions. 
Instead, FASB states a principal in the transaction that 
has control, takes on “inventory risk” before the goods 


or services have been delivered to the client. 


Echo’s Terms of Service does not suggest it has 
liability for risk of loss for the inventory, but 


places it on the carrier. Echo specifically states 
it is liable only up to its commission.


We manage all aspects 
of the shipping process 


including carrier 
selection


FASB does not comment or state that supplier selection 
or management is relevant to determining control


Because the new FASB guidance does not 
deem this relevant, in our opinion, it places 


further weight on Echo acting as agent


We establish prices


According to FASB, establishing the price that the 
customer pays for the specified good or service may 


indicate that the entity has the ability to
direct the use of that good or service and obtain 


substantially all of the remaining benefits. However, an 
agent can have discretion in


establishing prices in some cases. 


Establishing prices does not alone guarantee 
that Echo is a principal as there are exceptions. 


FASB listed this condition as the last of three 
conditions, potentially viewing it as the least


important of the three

(implying 11%) upside – not a favorable risk/reward in our view! None of the analysts are modeling 


disruption to Echo’s business from the Uber for Trucking movement, or have considered the plethora of red 


flag issues we’ve identified.

Price Targets Inflated on Unreasonably 
High Non-GAAP Numbers


By adjusting Echo’s numbers to account for numerous aggressive accounting assumptions, and 


unrealistic expectations for cost and revenue synergies tied to Command, Spruce Point has independently 


developed a realistic view of Echo’s true earnings. 


(1) Most analysts just take management’s 
word that $250m of revenue synergies can 
be achieved. We give Echo zero credit given 
a year has passed with nothing to show


(2) In Q2’16 management came up with 
unspecified $3m of cost synergies; we 
give them zero credit for this


(3) Adjusted to reverse the Q3’15 re-
allocation of intangibles to goodwill. 
(4) Normalizes amortization to 8yrs inline 
with industry peers vs. Echo’s 14.8yrs
(5) Normalizes bad debt expense closer to 
industry average of 1.6% of receivables


Note: Analysis assumes 38% tax rate and 29.1m diluted shares o/s

Looking to recent M&A deals in the transportation logistics sector suggests a 9x – 10x EV/EBITDA multiple 


range. In our view, Echo paid a rich multiple of 11.2x for Command Transportation, and has failed to live up 


to the expectations set by management.

What Are Echo’s Shares Worth?


While larger high quality industry peers trade at 10 – 12x ‘17E EBITDA, Echo should trade at a discount 


given our multitude of concerns. Applying a 8.0x – 9.0x multiple on our normalized EBITDA, we see 


$11.00 - $13.00 per share or approximately 50 – 60% downside.
