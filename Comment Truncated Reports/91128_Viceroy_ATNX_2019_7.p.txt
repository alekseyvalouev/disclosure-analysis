Athenex – Financial Situation 
Ahead of earnings, Viceroy provide an insight of what ’s to come.  


November 4, 2019 – This report provides a deep dive on Athenex’s significant 


revenue declines and capital over-commitment that investors can expect in the 


coming months. We believe revenues from the second half of 2019 will fall ~40% 


against the first half of 2019. 


▪ Athenex best seller, Vasopressin, has been pulled due to FDA ruling brought 


about by a lawsuit against Athenex by its largest customer, AmerisourceBergen. 


▪ COO Jeffrey Yordon is on record as stating the Vasopressin ban “did not come 


unexpected”. 


▪ Almirall licensing payments in 2018 were non-recurring, and 2019 milestones 


appear to have been delayed as Almirall redefine Athenex deliverables. 


▪ Per management’s guidance, we expect product sales revenue to fall 


approximately 40% in the second half of 2019 against the first half of 2019. 


▪ Athenex have not only committed >US$1.5b expenditure at their Dunkirk site 


across the next ten years but are also on the hook for excess development costs 


for the facility, whose floorplan has expanded by 28% on-the-fly and falling 


significantly behind schedule. 


▪ Athenex’s new China-funded plant must also generate unrealistic revenues of almost US$1b within 5 years 


of opening, despite turning over only $160m across the last 5 years combined. 


▪ Athenex must also pay RMB 10b in taxes over 10 years at its China Site, according to project commitments. 


Strangely, Athenex’s own tax projections do not meet the required sum from these commitments by over 


30%. 


▪ To manage its cash burning commitments to major facilities and accelerated R&D, Athenex has issued 


dilutive equity, and incredulously borrowed US$50m from major investor, Perceptive, at a punitive rate 


of 11%. 


Considering the quantum of issues Viceroy have highlighted, it is alarming to shareholders that Athenex 


have not addressed a single point of our work. Opting instead to simply state we have published 


“inaccurate information”. Other commentators have begun to back-test our work1. 


Where are the inaccuracies, Athenex? 


We have already highlighted management’s involvement in Sino Forest, GCL Silicon/Poly, Suntech, Chelsea 


Therapeutics, the world’s largest illegal taxol smuggling operation, and now LyphoMed, Gensia and Sagent. It 


is mind blowing that Athenex investors would continue to associate with any one of these farces, let alone a 


collection such as this. 


Viceroy reiterate our view that Oraxol is obsolete in the modern medicine, and that Athenex will be effectively 


bankrupt by mid-2020 with no profitable operations given management’s overenthusiastic spending habits. 


Viceroy remain short Athenex, and are in the process of obtaining a compiled, detailed report by industry 


specialists pertaining to Oraxol and its inability to be commercialized. 


In considering the above, Viceroy estimate that Athenex’s risks of a highly discounted and dilutive capital 


raise is all but guaranteed.

1. Non-recurring revenue 


A “pressin” issue 


The judgement banning the sale of Vasopressin has destroyed Athenex best sales prospect to date: 


 
Figure 1 Athenex Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript2 


 
Figure 2 Athenex Q1 2019 Earnings press release3 


Since its prospectus the company has only disclosed a complaint for declaratory judgement against Endo Par 


Innovation, Par Pharmaceutical and Par Sterile Products (the Par entities) regarding an infringement on their 


patents. This developed into a landmark case for the FDA based on Athenex’s use of “bulk” pharmaceutical 


ingredients. 


Recently, a judgement in favor of Endo's subsidiary Par Sterile Products, LLC entities was passed July 15, 2019 


putting a stop to vasopressin revenue for Athenex. As a further blow, the FDA upheld their decision that 


vasopressin was not a viable use for bulk manufacturing as there was an FDA-approved product already on the 


market.  


 
Figure 3 4Docket summary – Case 1:18-cv-00896 


Vasopressin is no longer a source of income for the company. Since its prospectus the company has only 


disclosed a complaint for declaratory judgement against Endo Par Innovation, Par Pharmaceutical and Par Sterile 


Products (the Par entities) regarding an infringement on their patents. This developed into a landmark case for 


the FDA based on Athenex’s use of “bulk” pharmaceutical ingredients.

Figure 4 Athenex Prospectus 


Athenex’s API arm, Athenex Pharma Solutions, was put under fire in September 2018 by PharMEDium Services 


(PharMEDium) for allegedly abusing the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 in their Amicus Curiae brief on 


the case. What makes this more interesting is that PharMEDium is a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, 


Athenex’s largest customer, accounting for 21% of revenues in Q2 2019. 


 
Figure 5 PharMEDium Services Amicus Curiae brief 


 
Figure 6 Athenex 2019 Q2 10-Q 


The brief filed September 20, 2018 by PharMEDium claims that Athenex intentionally misinterpreted section 


503B to prepare its products from bulk pharmaceutical ingredients. This is likely to cut down on costs as bulk 


ingredients are generally cheaper and easier to procure. 


Under the DQSA, bulks can only be used under direction from the FDA in the event of a shortage in the market 


or inclusion on a list; note that a shortage alone is not considered permission. 


In response to this dismissal, Athenex COO, Jeffrey Yordon, stated the FDA’s decision “did not come 


unexpected”.  


 
Figure 7 Extract – Bloomberg Article5 


Either this is a complete lie, or the Athenex had been selling as much Vasopressin as 


possible before the FDA undoubtedly came knocking.

Viceroy Research Group 5 viceroyresearch.org 


Viceroy’s projection of Athenex’s ongoing earning power treats vasopressin revenue as non-recurring revenue 


to reflect that the company is prohibited from selling it. 


 
Figure 8 Viceroy Revised EBITDA 


Per management’s guidance, we expect product sales revenue to fall approximately 


40% in the second half of 2019 against the first half of 2019. 


Other historical non-recurring sources 


We have also removed several non-recurring revenue sources: 


▪ Almirall’s US$30m payment for KX01 from 2018.  


▪ PharmeEssentia’s US$2m payment for KX01.

Non-recurring future payments 


Athenex have received $20m that is dependent on the results of clinical trials for Athenex’s KX01-AK-003 and 


KX01-AK-004 drug, being satisfactory.  


 
Figure 10 Second amendment to Athenex/Almirall 


Did Almirall catch on to the conflicts of interest in Athenex conducting its own research? 


Alongside delays in this licensing contract fulfilment and drug development, it is increasingly concerning that 


Athenex appears to have been given a greater burden of proof in providing “satisfactory” data to Almirall. 


Athenex, as a Company, must now not only provide clinical trial data, but also “summary of the findings signed 


off by an executive member of Athenex with fully audited listings, tables and figures including SAS datasets.” 


Original Contract: December 11, 2017 





Second amendment change –  June 18, 20196 





Athenex has received this cash, guaranteed against a bank deposit. We are unsure at this date as to whether 


Almirall has provided a notice that it is satisfied with KX01 results. I suppose we will find out at Q3 release. 


It is astonishing how low Athenex’s risk management controls are, especially given the 


Board’s and Management’s history of fraud.

2. Diving into commitment 


Dunkirk’s Buffalo Billions 


Athenex has committed to US$1.5bn in operational expenditure in Dunkirk over the course of 10 years at its 


allegedly soon-to-be-completed facility.  


 
Figure 11 – Extract from Athenex Q2 2019 10-Q 7 


The facility is not only far behind schedule, but has also been upgraded in size: 


 
Figure 12 – Extract from Athenex Q2 2019 10-Q 8 


Therefore, the risk for Athenex does not only lie in its commitment to expenditure in Dunkirk, but it is also liable 


for the thinly budgeted site’s excess costs over its budget of $200m.

Chongqing 


On September 23, 2019 – almost three years behind schedule – Athenex announced the completion of its new 


440,000sqft facility in Chongqing9. This government funded project does come with its caveats. For instance, 


Athenex must reach certain revenues and tax milestones: 


 
Figure 13 The Athenex Pharmaceutical Base Project Agreement10 


Strangely, Athenex’s projections do not meet these caveats.  


Additionally, the sum of Athenex’s tax projections for the first 10 years sums to only RMB 


6.8b, well below the required RMB 10b. 


This is besides the ridiculous projection that the plant will operate at yearly sales of ~US$1bn within 5 years, 


while Athenex in its entirety is still doing sub-$90m at its peak, a figure which will now drop substantially, and 


while opening another major facility in Dunkirk! 


 
Figure 14 Viceroy recreation of Athenex Chongqing projections 


Dilution solution – Perceptive hedging their bet 


To manage its cash burning commitments to major facilities and accelerated R&D, Athenex has issued dilutive 


equity, and incredulously borrowed US$50m from major investor, Perceptive, at a punitive rate of 11%, when 


banks are lending at approximately half of that rate. 


In all fairness, Viceroy would have asked for a lot more. 


 
Figure XX – Extract from Athenex Q2 2019 10-Q 11 


We estimate that Athenex, if lucky, may make it to HY 2020 before hats are out for a >10% equity dilution.
