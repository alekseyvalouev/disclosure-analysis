We believe that Shougang Fushan Resources Group Limited (HK: 0639) (“Fushan”), a 2008 effective reverse merger
trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange,has misrepresented its business and financial position to investors and that, as
was the case with Chaoda ModernAgriculture (HK: 0682), regulators will halt trading of Fushan’s stock on account of
such impropriety.

www.glaucusresearch.com


1.Overpayment for a Major Acquisition from Insiders. Comparable acquisition data indicates that Fushan signifi-
cantly overpaid for the coal mines that it acquired from company insider Xing LiBin (“Mr.Xing”) for HK$ 10.5 billion1.
By our calculations,Fushan acquired the mines for RMB 97 per tonne of the stated coal reserves,when its competitors ac-
quired other similarly-sized, primary-coking coal mines (in the same or neighboring province) for between RMB 11 and
RMB 16 per tonne of reserves. This indicates that Fushan overpaid by roughly HK$ 8 billion.


2. Pump and Dump. Fushan’s long-time ChairmanWong Lik Ping (“ChairmanWong”) and his cohort,Mr.Xing,
each sold the vast majority of their respective company shares within 18 months of the reverse merger. ChairmanWong
grossed HK$ 4.5 billion andMr.Xing grossed HK$ 4 billion as Fushan’s stock soared on the strength of suspiciously high
margins.


a.We believe Fushan’s EBITDA margins are fabricated because they are head and shoulders above those of its
domestic and international peers and they display Madoffian consistency.


b.Suspiciously Low Costs. Fushan's cost of goods as a percentage of sales is 3500 basis points lower than that of its
Chinese and international coking coal comps.We believe that,much like the Longtop scandal, insiders have embel-
lished Fushan's performance by moving costs off of its books. Specifically,we suspect undisclosed related-party trans-
actions with Mr.Xing,who controls 12 area coal mines, 8 of which are within 15 miles of Fushan's operations.


c.Ridiculous ASPs.Despite selling a commodity, Fushan justifies above-market prices (in this case as high as 20%)
because its product is different. In 2008,one related party customer single-handedly boosted overall post-merger sales
and pre-tax income by 10% and 21%, respectively, by buying an enormous amount of coal at a 72% premium to
prices paid by other customers.


3.Undisclosed Related PartyTransactions. FushanmadeHK$ 375million in purportedly charitable donations (17%
of its 2009 EBIT) to the Liulin Provincial Government for the construction of public schools. We believe that this was
no charitable donation; rather evidence suggests that the money went to an elite, for-profit school owned by Mr.Xing.


4.Musical Chairmen. Fushan has churned through 5 chairmen in the last 3 years. Since 2009,no chairman has signed
off more than once on the company’s annual audited financials, suggesting that they may have fled rather than risk being
tarnished by an accounting scandal at the company.


5.Weak Auditor. Fushan’s auditor, BDO Limited Hong Kong, has a checkered history of representing other publicly
listed Chinese companies which have committed or have fallen under suspicion of committing fraud.


6.Valuation.Webelieve Fushan is worth nomore thanHK$ 0.91 per share,which is the private market value of its mines
based on a generous multiple of 29x its estimated reserves as of Q1 2012. This figure includes Fushan’s minority stakes in
Mt.Gibson (MGX) andAPAC (1104 HK) at a 20% liquidity discount. We gave no credit to net cash of HK$ 0.69 per
share given the brazen nature of the Fushan fraud and the difficulty of recovering against entrenched and powerful insid-
ers in China’s corrupt judicial system.

SHOUGANG FUSHAN RESOURCES GROUP LIMITED HK 0639


Introduction
Shougang Fushan Resources Group Limited (“Fushan” or the “company”) is a mining company that produces and sells
coking coal.The company,which went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (“HKEX”) via an effective reverse merger,
owns and operates three coal mines in northern China (Shanxi Province).


It is our opinion that Fushan is a pump-and-dump scheme that serves as a vehicle to transfer wealth from shareholders to
wealthy, powerful and connected insiders. The company boasts margins that are nearly double almost all other publicly traded
domestic or international coking coal miners. This is not credible. We believe that insiders have exaggerated the performance
of the company by inflating sales figures and moving costs off Fushan’s books through disclosed and undisclosed related-party
transactions. As the price of Fushan’s shares skyrocketed on the strength of dubious production figures and out-of-this-world
performance, insiders aggressively sold their respective stakes in the company.


We also believe that Fushan has inappropriately transferred shareholders money to investors by more direct means. We pres-
ent evidence that Fushan purchased coal mines from insiders at price-to-reserve multiples significantly higher than what in-
dependent third parties paid for similar mines in the same region during the same time period. We also believe that Fushan
has violated securities laws by diverting company funds to for-profit schools owned by a major shareholder under the guise of
charitable donations.


But to understand the story it is necessary to identify the primary beneficiaries of these illicit transactions.


The Men Behind the Curtain
For those investors similarly impressed by Fushan, its uber-impressive profits and magical growth story,we would like to introduce
former Fushan ChairmanWong Lik Ping (“ChairmanWong”) and Forbes 400 Chinese billionaire Xing LiBin (“Mr. Xing”).


ChairmanWong served as the chairman of Fushan from
2001-2009, during which time the company struggled as
a middling jewelry business.


By contrast, Mr. Xing was then one of China’s richest
men and owner of Shanxi Lasen Energy (“Lasen En-
ergy”), a massive privately-held conglomerate with in-
terests in coal mining, electricity, cement, hotels,
agriculture and education.


ChairmanWong and Mr. Xing came together in 2008 to
orchestrate the reverse merger that created the com-
pany in its current form,making billions for both men
in the process. This is their story.

Fushan Overpays for Acquisitions
On July 25, 2008,Fushan consummated a $HK 10.5 billion acquisition of an 82% interest in three coal mines (the“3 Mines”),
purchased from Fortune Dragon Group (“Fortune Dragon Group”), a company owned by Mr.Xing and ChairmanWong.
Fushan paid the owners of Fortune Dragon Group HK$ 4.86 billion in cash (cash raised throughout the prior year in
anticipation of the acquisition) and HK$ 5.67 billion in new shares issued by the public company.


This HK$ 10.5 billion transaction transformed Fushan overnight from a floundering jewelry company into a Chinese mining
behemoth (measured solely by market capitalization). But evidence suggests that the company significantly overpaid for old,
provincial mines, thus illicitly enriching ChairmanWong,Mr. Xing and their cohorts at the expense of shareholders.


From Fushan’s public filings, we have assembled the following information on this transformative acquisition and the value of
the acquired mines. The following chart presents the gospel according to the company:


The conventional metric for evaluating a coal mine acquisition is the ratio of the purchase price of the mine’s implied total
enterprise value to the amount of such mine’s proven and probable reserves. For the Fushan’s 2008 acquisition, according to
our calculations the implied total enterprise value of the 3 Mines (before subtracting net debt) was 13.8 billion RMB, or 97
times the amount of proven and probable coal reserves of the 3 Mines.


In order to assess the reasonableness of the purchase price paid by Fushan, we retained China Coal Resources, a subsidiary of
Fenwei Energy Consulting Co, to provide data on acquisitions of other private coal mines in the same geographic region and
during months leading up to the announcement of the Fushan acquisition. China Coal Resources is China’s premier consul-
tancy in the coal and coke industry, employing a staff of over 360 professionals.


Without revealing the purpose of our inquiry, we asked China Coal Resources for a table of comparable transactions, includ-
ing the estimated reserves and production data for coking coal mines acquired in the same region (Shanxi province and neigh-
boring provinces) in 2007 and 2008. InAppendix I we have included the complete mergers and acquisitions comparables table
for the 2007-2008 period that we obtained from our independent, third party consultants.

APPLES TO APPLES


According to China Coal Resources’ coal classification chart (and coal quality data provided by the company), Fushan's coal
falls into the category of bituminous #25 coal (see Appendix II), which falls into the broader group of primary coking coal.
To put it in context,of the 14 sub-categories of coking coal,Fushan's appears fifth best in terms of quality. In the universe of Chi-
nese metallurgic coal, Fushan’s coal is slightly above average, but nevertheless is an undifferentiated commodity that must com-
pete with higher and lower quality coking varieties and contemporary substitutes such as pulverized coal (PCI).


In the table below we compare Fushan’s acquisition of the 3 Mines with other acquisitions of ‘primary coking coal’ mines
in the Shanxi and neighboring provinces during the same time period. This ensures that we are comparing apples-to-apples
and giving the company the benefit of the doubt for the quality of the coal that it purports to mine. Even with these gener-
ous assumptions, the data suggests an unmistakable conclusion: that Fushan vastly overpaid for the 3 Mines.


Fushan acquired the 3 Mines from an insider for RMB 97.0 times (per tonne) of the amount of reserves. By comparison, its
competitors bought coal mines of similar size, in the same area, during the same time period, producing a comparable grade
of coking coal, for an average multiple of RMB 13.9 times (per tonne) of reserves.


If investors applied the valuation metric of comparable transactions (13.9x reserves) to the 3 Mines acquired by Fushan from
its rich and powerful benefactors in 2008, the total debt on the books of the 3 Mines would have exceeded the value
of the mines. In other words, it appears that ChairmanWong, Mr. Xing and their cohorts sold investors a net
liability for over HK$ 10.5 billion.


By this metric, it appears that Fushan overpaid Mr. Xing and his cohorts by over HK$ 10.5 billion for the 3 Mines.5 Worse
still, the company’s valuation of the 3 Mines relied on highly suspicious production figures for the 3 Mines spoon-fed to the
company by none other than the seller.

Dubious Production Data
A host of further evidence supports the notion that Fushan massively overpaid for the 3 Mines, thereby enriching insiders to
the detriment of shareholders.


EMPEROR’S NEW CLOTHES


In July 2008, Fushan paid HK$4.9 billion in cash (HK$4 billion of which was raised in the capital markets from investors im-
mediately prior to the acquisition) and issued 1.26 billion new shares valued at HK$5.7 billion (thus diluting existing shareholders)
to acquire the 3 Mines. Fushan tapped the capital markets to raise money for the acquisition by pointing to dubious produc-
tion figures at the 3 Mines. Such production figures are not remotely credible and appear not to have been independ-
ently verified.


The following graph shows production data provided in Fushan’s public filings. Suspiciously, production at each of the 3 Mines
jumped meteorically just prior to their acquisition by Fushan. The exponential growth of the 3 Mines just prior to their acqui-
sition by the company is simply not credible for three reasons: the mines were already mature at the time production spiked, the
mines were located in a popular coal mining region,making it unlikely that they could have escaped unnoticed for a significant
period of time,and headcount at the 3 Mines did not appear to increase between 2005-2007, a period that saw 4 ac-
quisitions and a miraculous explosion of productivity.

FROM ZERO TO HERO


At the time of the acquisition, the 3 Mines were, on average, already decades into production (each was established in 1968,
1988, and 1996, respectively). Despite it being highly unlikely that Fortune Dragon Group could so quickly and easily ramp
up output, in the four years prior to the acquisition, production at the 3 Mines purportedly exploded. The production his-
tory of the Jinjiazhuang and Zhaiyadi mines, in particular, merits close scrutiny.


Fushan’s public filings only included pre-2004 production figures for the Jinjiazhuang mine (“Jinjiazhuang”). According to the
technical report provided by the company, from 1996 to 2001, Jinjiazhuang’s production maxed out at 150,000 tonnes of coal
per year. Then, from 2001 to 2003, the Jinjiazhuang Mine was mothballed for three years. Needless to say, Jinjiazhuang
did not seem a likely candidate for a booming mining operation.


But, according to production figures provided by Fortune Dragon Group, Jinjiazhuang went from idleness to spectacular prof-
itability in a short time. Production appears to have increased by 900% in the five years prior to Jinjiazhuang’s sale to Fushan.


900%. At an old mine. The“growth” at the Zhaiyadi mine is similarly unbelievable; it rocketed up 860% in the four years prior
to the acquisition.


Fushan’s oldest mine is Xingwu (originally opened in 1968,when Lyndon Johnson was president of the United States). After
taking 36 years to reach 700,000 tons of coal, production more than doubled in the four-year period prior to the sale of the
mine to the company.Apparently, this mine took four decades to reach the inflection point in its growth curve.


Note that acquisitions cannot explain the exponential growth of production at the 3 Mines. In December 2006, the Fortune
Dragon Group absorbed four smaller mines into its existing mining operations. But prior to such acquisition, the 3 Mines had
purportedly recorded 3 years of suspiciously amazing growth.


HIDING UNDER EVERYONE’S NOSE?


Fortune Dragon Group’s mines were not tucked away in a remote or under-mined region. Just the opposite. Shanxi province
alone accounts for 55.4% of China’s coking coal reserves.6 According to the company's 2009 annual report, the 3 Mines are
"located within the Lishi-Liulin mining area of Hedong coalfield, one of China's key reserve areas for high-quality hard cok-
ing coal." Given the number (and density) of coal mines in the area,we find it unlikely that the assets capable of such a quick
and easy jump in production remained under the radar for, on average, 24 years since they began commercial production.


EMPLOYEE-FREE GROWTH


Perhaps most suspiciously, production at the 3 Mines skyrocketed even though the Fortune Dragon Group did not add any
net employees. Despite boosting output by 102% between 2005 and 2007,Fortune Dragon Group’s headcount actually shrunk.
How did fewer employees produce more than twice the amount of coal considering that labor is a major cost of goods for Chi-
nese coal mines?

Below we have graphed the headcount at the 3 Mines from 2005 through 2007 and juxtaposed it with a graph on the right
showing the meteoric rise in production at the 3 Mines during the same period.7


Fortune Dragon Employee Count Fortune Dragon Coal Output


We believe that the above graphs provide compelling evidence that Fushan defrauded shareholders by lying about the productivity of
the 3Mines.We find it absurd that a company could increase production so dramatically at old mines without increasing headcount. In
fact,headcount decreased from 2006-2007,a period during which,according to Fushan,production increased by almost 25%,and Fortune
Dragon Group purportedly spent $HK 1 billion to acquire four smaller mines fromMr.Xing’s wife. This is simply not believable.


RUBBER STAMPS


A savvy investor might object to our conclusion on the grounds that the company hired two independent consultants, a min-
ing expert and an appraiser, to bless the 3 Mines acquisition. But on closer inspection, such independent evaluations are no
more than rubber stamps of data provided by the sellers.


The company hired JohnT.Boyd, an independent mining consulting firm, to review the reserve estimates and production fig-
ures of the 3 Mines and prepare a technical report of its findings (the “Boyd Report”). Strangely, the Boyd Report relies al-
most exclusively on estimates of reserves and historical production data at the 3 Mines provided by Mr.Xing’s Fushan Dragon
Group (referred to as FDG in Boyd’s report):


“The basis of our work was historical operating and other source data provided principally by FDG …the pri-
mary source of information (written and verbal) relied upon by BOYD in preparing this ITR was
provided by FDG…in preparing this report, we have relied upon reserve, operating, and other data
as provided by FDG…the accuracy of the results and conclusions of this report are reliant on the accuracy of
information provided. We have made no attempt to verify the technical and geological information
presented in the reference material documents and assume it has been prepared by competent engi-
neers and geologists…nor do we represent any of our findings include matters of a legal or accounting nature.”


In other words, the Boyd Report relied almost exclusively on data provided by Fortune Dragon Group and its owners (Mr.
Xing and ChairmanWong), which is a grave conflict of interest that undermines any comfort investors can take from the al-
legedly independent evaluation.


The company also hired Greater China Appraisal LimitedTseWai Leung to provide an independent valuation of the transac-
tion (the “Greater China Appraisal”). Yet the Greater China Appraisal, like authors of the Boyd Report, relied upon figures
provided by Mr. Xing:

“We have not carried out detailed site measurement to verify the correctness of the mining areas of
the Coal Mine but have assumed that the areas shown in the legal documents provided to us are correct.”


Put simply, the company bought three old mines and justified the acquisition to shareholders based on dubious production fig-
ures provided by ChairmanWong and Mr.Xing, the primary beneficiaries of the transaction. Such production figures appear
not to have been independently verified by the consultants and appraisers brought in to evaluate the acquisition.

Fushan Pumps, Insiders Dump
The objective of a pump and dump scheme is to talk up the share price through misleading financial performance so that in-
siders may dispose of their shares after other investors take the bait.


The chart below shows that Mr.Xing and ChairmanWong dumped 90% of their interest in the company within 18 months of
the 3 Mines transaction. We estimate that Mr.Xing grossed HK$ 4.0 billion and ChairmanWong grossed HK$ 4.5 billion.


Upon the consummation of the reverse merger,Mr.Xing received a 15% stake in the company (670 million shares) and Chair-
manWong’s ownership stake stood at 31% (1.4 billion shares). When the markets saw Fushan’s outstanding performance and
the price of the company’s stock soared, ChairmanWong and Mr. Xing sold out.

Ridiculous Margins
A common denominator of Chinese reverse mergers that have collapsed under allegations of fraud is that their performance
appears too good to be true. The play book is simple. Fraudsters hide costs through off-books transactions with related par-
ties in order to inflate margins and pump up their stock price. Once the stock price soars on the wind of amazing profitabil-
ity, insiders sell. Longtop Financial (NYSE: LFT) was the paradigmatic example of this scheme.


We believe that Fushan’s insiders have perpetrated a similar deception. Compared to other coal mining companies, Fushan’s
financial performance is simply incredible. The company’s EBITDA and EBIT margins easily trounce its HKEX and A-share
coal competitors, which, for the most part, are much larger, vertically integrated, and more experienced organizations.


Fushan’s financial performance is so far superior to its competitors that it leaves only two choices: either it has revolutionized
the coal mining business or the company is fabricating its financial statements.

A-SHARE COMPS (EBITDA MARGIN)9


It is highly unlikely that Fushan is the most efficient and best-managed coal mine in the world, as its global and Chinese com-
petitors should benefit from economies of scale. Fushan produces coal from three old and provincial mines. Yet it manages to
generate better EBITDA margins than companies with much larger mines. Either Fushan is the most efficient and best-man-
aged coal company in the world or it is a fraud. We think the answer is obvious.


For those that would argue that Fushan's margins can be explained by its focus on high quality, and therefore, high priced coal,
we present the following chart comparing Fushan to other Chinese and leading international coking coal companies, which
focus almost exclusively on high priced coal. Again, Fushan's margins seem a work of fiction.

GLOBAL METALLURGIC (COKING) COAL COMPS – EBITDA MARGINS10


The peer group we assembled in the above chart is made up of pure coking coal companies operating in Shanxi (Shanxi Lu’an,
Shanxi Xishan), a neighboring province in China (Kailuan Energy), Southern China (Hidili) and in other parts of the world,
such as North America,Australia, and India.


Fushan cannot argue that cheaper labor can account for the discrepancy because in our comparison we included local com-
petitors hiring from the same labor force. In addition, several of the above companies are industry leaders for metallurgic coal,
with vastly greater purchasing power, technology, and management skills. Yet their margins still average 3500 basis points below
those of Fushan. This fails the smell test.


MADOFFIAN CONSISTENCY


One of the hallmark features of Bernie Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme was that he consistently produced exceptional monthly returns
despite wild swings in the market. The consistency of Fushan's margins bears a striking resemblance to Madoff ’s returns: no-
tice in the above chart how margins for Fushan’s peers fluctuate during the doom and gloom of the great recession (2008-2010).
Yet Fushan’s margins appear immune to the cyclicality in coal prices during the same time period.


To the contrary, in 2009,Fushan's adjusted EBITDA margin (excluding stock option expense and charitable contributions) in-
creased 724 basis points despite:


• its average selling price for raw coal declining by 18%,
• its sales declining 6% on an annualized basis,
• its production cost per tonne increasing by 13%, and
• the reported loss of the company’s most profitable customer who accounted for 31% of sales in the prior year.


Virtually all of its competitors suffered during this period. How was Fushan immune? Fushan, like Madoff, has a track record
remarkable for both its excellence and its strange consistency.

Oh What An Awful Web We Weave...
If we dig deeper into Fushan’s remarkable margins,we find that Fushan’s performance is driven by curiously high average sell-
ing prices ("ASPs") for a commodity and an unreasonably low cost structure.


COAL 101


Coal is found in continuous seams that stretch out over vast geographical areas, like an underground river. Below is a picture
of a coal seam (the thick black lines) which stretches across the countryside.


It is particularly important to understand how coal seams affect the market price of coal. Each seam produces coal with dif-
ferent characteristics. But, and this is crucial, coal characteristics generally do not significantly vary within a seam at
a similar access point. Thus, exchanges, companies and traders typically set a spot price for coal by the seam and nearest
city of origin.


Fushan primarily mines seams #4 and #9 within five miles of Liulin.Coal from seams #4 and #9 from the greater Liulin area
are traded at prices set by the Liulin coal market.


How is Fushan more profitable than other coal companies? Part of the reason is that it sells Liulin #4 and #9 coal at premium
to the market prices for coal mined from the exact same seam. According to BNP’s recent research report, from 2009-
2011, Fushan sold its Liulin #4 coal at a 19% premium to the Liulin #4 benchmark price, while the company’s #9 clean
coal sells at a 10% premium to the Liulin #9 benchmark.


Coal is a commodity (or so we thought). How can Fushan’s coal sell at a significant premium to the same coal mined from
the same seams? The whole point of setting a spot price for coal from each seam is that buyers and sellers can quickly and
easily exchange the commodity without having to determine the unique characteristics of each lot. The notion that Fushan
could sell its #4 coal for almost a 20% premium to the spot price of #4 coal is absurd.


RELATED PARTY ASPS


This begs the deeper question: who would pay a premium to the spot price for a commodity?
The answer: a related party who, as a major shareholder, directly benefits from Fushan’s financial performance.


In 2008, Mr. Xing’s conglomerate bought raw coking coal from Fushan at 72% above the price paid by other customers. 11


The following table summarizes the transaction.


11 http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2008/1125/LTN20081125099.pdf


www.glaucusresearch.com


14
SHOUGANG FUSHAN RESOURCES GROUP LIMITED HK 0639


In 2008,Mr.Xing’s related party premium for one 3-month period singlehandedly boosted Fushan's 2008 sales and pre-tax net in-
come by 10% and 21%,respectively.12 Mr.Xing’s decision to buy raw coal from Fushan at a hefty premium came immediately after
the reverse merger and just prior to the time when Mr. Xing and ChairmanWong dumped virtually all their shares. While this
transaction was disclosed to investors,we think it should be noted that coal washing is a razor thin margin business,making it un-
likely that Mr.Xing could afford to overpay for raw coal and still make a profit, and that it seems incredibly unlikely that Mr.Xing
would ever buy raw coking coal from a third party,much less for a 72% premium, given that he owns 12 coal mines in the same
area, 8 of which are within 15 miles of Fushan's operations.


It is also worth noting that since 2008, Fushan’s board has maintained huge mandates for related party coal transactions with
Mr. Xing and director Shi (who also owns competing coal mines in the area), and 27% shareholder Shougang parent (whose
employees comprise nearly half of the board). Board-approved transaction caps allow these parties to purchase coal for more
than twice the price that Fushan commands with other customers. We believe that these arrangements provide a significant
opportunity to related parties to manipulate the share price of Fushan by artificially boosting ASPs.


In our opinion, the notion that Fushan sells a commodity at a large premium to a related party is dubious.We suspect that such
transactions take place at market prices but that Fushan marks up the price on the invoice in order to boost its margins. Make
no mistake that insiders reap a massive benefit from such actions: outstanding margins boost Fushan’s stock price, allowing in-
siders to enrich themselves on the sale of the company’s shares.


LONGTOP 2.0


In addition to reporting unrealistically high ASPs, Fushan achieves world-beating margins because its costs, as a percentage of
revenue, are so much lower than its domestic and international competitors’ margins.


The graph below compares Fushan’s cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales against its pure coking peers. This chart is truly re-
markable because it shows Fushan allegedly mines a commodity at gross margins that would be the envy of a software monopoly.

GLOBAL METALLURGIC (COKING) COAL COMPS – COGS AS % OF SALES


The above graph suggests that Fushan has revolutionized the coal industry. It has discovered a way to mine coal so much more
cheaply than its competitors that it seems like magic. Notice that cheap labor costs or geographic anomalies do not explain the
difference: Fushan’s costs are ridiculously lower than domestic peers, including coal companies mining in the same province
(Shanxi Lu’an, Shanxi Xishan).


In this way, Fushan reminds us of Longtop Financial, a US-listed Chinese company which collapsed after Citron Research and
Bronte Capital publicly accused it of committing fraud. Like Fushan,Longtop boasted absurdly high margins relative to its com-
petitors.


Longtop was able to artificially inflate its margins through hidden related party transactions: Longtop’s insiders shifted its labor
costs off the company’s books to an undisclosed related party, making Longtop’s performance stunning by comparison to its
competitors. We believe that something similar may be happening with Fushan.


PROXIMITY TO RELATED PARTY COMPETITORS


Mr.Xing, through his conglomerate Lasen Energy, owns twelve competing coal mines near Fushan’s coal mines, eight
of which are within 15 miles of Fushan's operations. On the following page, we have prepared a simple map showing
the close proximity of Fushan’s coal mines to Mr. Xing’s coal mines.

ing range (late 2009).

PUDA COAL
Fushan’s operations are within
a 2 hour drive of Puda Coal,
another coking coal fraud.


OTHER INSIDER DEALINGS
Fushan also maintains a supply
contract with company director, Shi
Jianping, who, like Mr. Xing, owns
competing coal interests in the area.
SHOUGANG FUSHAN RESOURCES GROUP LIMITED HK 0639


A closer look at Fushan’s business reveals that Mr.Xing is one of the company’s top suppliers for a number of non-coal inputs
such as tools, accessories, facilities rental, construction contracts, and possibly other common cost of goods sold items like labor
and transportation.


We find it odd that one of the most cost-efficient coal mines in the world has a middle man between itself and many of its key
inputs. We believe Mr. Xing’s Lasen Energy is moving costs for these services off-books, which has helped Fushan earn gross
margins as high as 74% and adjusted EBITDA margins as high as 69%.


Also of interest is the unique structure of the supply contracts between Mr. Xing’s Lasen Energy and Fushan. As the following
excerpt shows, the price of materials supplied to the company by Mr. Xing is determined not based on the market price of the
materials or services supplied, but on the price that Mr.Xing has charged other entities for similar materials or services.


Any investor in Chaoda is, to their great regret, already familiar with just such a contractual arrangement (Chaoda, halted after al-
legations of fraud, had a similarly dubious contract with its chairman which was highlighted in the whistle-blowing piece circu-
lated by Anonymous).


This contractual structure allows Mr. Xing to charge Fushan any price he wants, provided he can show that he charged such
price to another customer. It is basically a blank check for Mr. Xing to make up whatever price he likes.


But we believe that Mr. Xing is rather clever. Rather than overcharge Fushan for materials and services, we suspect that he
undercharges Fushan (at least on paper), thereby allowing the company to boast spectacular margins and thus bolstering
the price of his stock. It is essentially the same strategy as Longtop and Chaoda: use related party transactions to shift costs off
the books of the publicly listed company, thus making the publicly listed company’s performance appear spectacular and send-
ing its stock price through the stratosphere.


The number of related party transactions between Fushan and Mr. Xing and his family are head-spinning, so we put it in vi-
sual format to show investors just how tangled a web Mr. Xing has woven around the company.

Given that Fushan’s margins are much higher than its competitors, investors should be deeply suspicious at the tangled web of
related party transactions between the company and insiders.


The proximity of Mr. Xing’s other coal mines, the fact that Fushan relies on Mr. Xing as both a major supplier and customer,
and the relationship between Fushan and Mr. Xing’s family all present an ideal opportunity to falsify Fushan’s margins. It
would be near impossible for anyone to verify Fushan’s claimed production and sales figures given how easy it would be to
move costs off of the company’s books.


We believe that Fushan has moved significant costs off its books to Mr. Xing’s other companies, allowing it to earn margins
2000 bps to 3000 bps above their HK,A-share, and global peers – margins that also showed almost no signs of cyclicality in
the 2007-2011 period.


In short, we believe Fushan fraudulently exaggerated its margins to pump up the price of its stock, which later allowed insid-
ers Mr.Xing and ChairmanWong to dump virtually all of their shares.We believe that the charade continues today so that the
company can raise money for another dubious acquisition.

Fushan Diverts Money Earmarked for Charity
Under the guise of making a HK$ 375 million charitable contribution to public elementary schools, evidence indicates that
Fushan diverted the money to a for-profit school owned and operated by Mr. Xing’s conglomerate.


According to the 2009Annual Report of Fushan,“[i]n the light of the considerable profit that we have earned, the Group de-
cided to give back to the society through donations to charities. Last year, under the request of the relevant Mainland gov-
ernment authority, the Group joined hands with other coal enterprises in Liulin County, Shanxi Province to commit
ourselves for donation for the construction of modern schools and provision of educational facilities in the re-
gion which cover a total land area of 1,000 mu.The annual donation made by the Group between 2009 and 2011 is RMB110
million, a total donation of RMB330 million [roughly HK$ 375 million].”


While we applaud the notion of a major corporation giving back to the community, as we will see,Fushan’s contributions hardly
qualify as charitable. Rather, it appears that the donations went to a for-profit school owned by Mr. Xing.


Below we show two pictures side by side. On the left we show an excerpt from the company’s 2009 Annual Report showing
a blueprint of a school to which the purportedly charitable monies were donated. On the right we show a picture from the
website of one of Mr. Xing's private, for-profit schools. They are clearly the same school.

SHOUGANG FUSHAN RESOURCES GROUP LIMITED HK 0639


From the same website (article translation below) we learn that although the schools receive government subsidies, they are
privately-owned, for-profit entities:


According to our Chinese attorneys, such privately-held schools receive government subsidies but remit any operating profit
(or a percentage thereof) to their private shareholders. In China, such schools are exclusive and costly. Mr.Xing’s schools charge
a hefty tuition and are structured to remit a profit to his private conglomerate. What is the connection to Fushan?


The first of Lasen Energy’s three listed schools, Lasen High School/Middle School, is an elite, for-profit high school as can be
confirmed through its website (www.sxls.net). Within that website, there are pictures of elaborate buildings currently under
construction (available in Appendix IV), one of which is the same exact picture from Fushan's 2009 Annual Report.
The evidence indicates that, rather than making a charitable contribution, Fushan shareholders are funding the expensive cap-
ital investments in a school, for which a Fushan insider will be collecting the return on investment.


At best, Fushan has violated securities laws by failing to disclose this related party transaction. At worst, this is textbook fraud: using
money raised from investors through the capital markets to secretly boost the profitability of businesses owned by insiders.


Fushan recently announced plans to double down on school charity15, committing further payments of $HK 244 million per
year between 2012 and 2014.

SHOUGANG FUSHAN RESOURCES GROUP LIMITED HK 0639


Who Will Be The Chairman When The Music Stops?
Fushan has had five different chairmen in the last three years.16 We believe that the high turnover at the chairman position in-
dicates that the end game is near: no one wants to be sitting at the head of the table when the music stops.


The position of chairman of a public company is a highly coveted position, and for good reason. Serving as the chairman of
a public company is a well-compensated and prestigious position, so it is highly unusual to find a public company where its
chairmen quit so frequently and so soon after being hired.


The short tenure of Fushan’s recent chairman is therefore noteworthy and suspicious. Since ChairmanWong, no chairman
has signed off more than once on the company’s annual audited financials, suggesting that they may have fled rather than risk
being tarnished by an accounting scandal at the company.


Adventures in Auditing
Fushan’s auditor is BDO Limited Hong Kong (“BDO”), an accounting firm which has a track record of signing off on the fi-
nancial statements of companies which committed fraud or are currently being accused of committing fraud. BDO’s record
speaks for itself.


BDO audited China ExpertTechnology (“CXTI”), a notorious U.S.-listed Chinese fraud. CXTI’s shares soared to $7.00 on
the strength of spectacular financial results. But CXTI was a hoax.The company did not exist and its financials were conjured
from thin air.The CEO and CFO subsequently disappeared and CXTI ceased to file financial statements, wiping out its in-
vestors. CXTI’s shares are now almost worthless.How could investors have confidence in an auditor that signed off on a com-
pany that did not exist?


BDO Limited’s less-than-sterling record does not end with CXTI. BDO Limited is the auditor of China Biotics (“CHBT“),
Orient Paper (“ONP“) and Gulf Resources (“GURE”), all of which have been the subject of whistle-blowing investigations
in the last twelve months.


BDO Limited has accumulated a roster of clients that, in the last year alone, have seen the value of their shares drop precipi-
tously as a result of accusations of fraud.

This track record may not come as a surprise, considering that BDO Limited Hong Kong is not regulated by the PCAOB.
Many Chinese auditors, under pressure to please clients, often refrain from conducting deep due diligence, ignore suspi-
cious numbers, and make favorable assumptions on their clients behalf.Without the risk of censure or punishment, given
that they do not answer to any U.S. regulatory body, the carrot of substantial fees can lead Chinese auditors to prioritize
client retention over accurate disclosure and a thorough investigation.


We have no idea whether BDO has been misled by the company or it is complicit in what we believe to be an ongoing scam.
But we are certain that BDO’s track record suggests that its status as Fushan’s auditor should not give any investor comfort that
it can serve as a bulwark against fraud.

SHOUGANG FUSHAN RESOURCES GROUP LIMITED HK 0639


Valuation
If we value Fushan’s business as a multiple of the reserves remaining in the company’s three coal mines, then we can calculate
a reasonable value of the shares as follows:


Fushan claims to have HK$ 0.69 per share in net cash and cash equivalents. In light of the evidence presented in this report,
which in our opinion shows fabricated sales, off-the-books expenses, and defrauding shareholders of billions of dollars, we
doubt that the company’s stated cash balance actually exists. For those investors confident in BDO Limited's ability to count
cash and verify sales invoices in China, Deloitte’s experience with Longtop shows that even top-tier auditors are easily fooled
by fake cash balances.


We therefore value the company atHK$ 0.91 per share,which consists of the salvage value of its three mines (HK$ 0.63 per
share) assuming a generous 29x multiple of reserves as reflected in CCR's most recent 2010 M&A comps (see AppendixV)
plus HK$ 0.28 per share for Fushan's minority stakes in Mt. Gibson (MGX AU) and APAC Resources (1104 HK) at a 20%
liquidity discount. Even this estimate may be too sanguine.


Given the difficulty of recovering money against fraudsters in China’s judicial system,we believe that equity holders would be
fortunate to recover anything if the company collapses under regulatory scrutiny. Chinese courts are notoriously corrupt, ar-
bitrary and protective of local businesses and industry. Notions of judicial independence do not apply.As a result, for foreign
investors such as Fushan’s equity holders, we suspect that litigating against a powerful and wealthy local Chinese businessman
in a Chinese court would be a Sisyphean task.


Further hindering any prospect of recovery is that Fushan’s puppet master is one of the richest men in China and theVice Chair-
man of CPPCC, Liulin County. Along with his vast wealth, Fushan’s insiders have a surplus of relationships and connections
with government and state-owned enterprises, which magnify his influence over judicial outcomes.


In light of the difficulty of recovering any cash from entrenched insiders through China’s judicial system, after paying off debt
holders, we believe that there will be nothing left to pay equity holders, making Fushan’s equity essentially worthless. But to
be generous, we are placing a price target of HK$ 0.91 on Fushan’s shares.
