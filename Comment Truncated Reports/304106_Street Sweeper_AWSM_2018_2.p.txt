Cool doesn’t let its financial facts get in the way of promotions. And these bought-and-paid-
misleading. 
PR Newswire, Yahoo, Nasdaq, Morningstar, SilverDoctors, The Globe and Mail, Proactive Inve

Here’s another version:


The truth is this: Cool isn’t earning a penny per square foot. 
The firm’s stores are losing millions. 
The $900 million potential appears to be fabrication. 
And Cool is paying promoters to perpetuate these lies.


TheStreetSweeper has repeatedly called and emailed to ask Cool to acknowledge these erro

TheStreetSweeper issues an investor
alert for Cool Holdings (AWSM)! This
fundamentally flawed computer re-

promotions just before unleashing a
$25 million shelf.
