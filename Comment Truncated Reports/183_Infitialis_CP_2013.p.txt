Canadian Pacific Railway: Off The Tracks After Ackman

Introduction


Investors in industries deemed popular or in vogue by the general public have a
propensity to engage in folly often resulting in the manifestation of valuation bubbles for
the pioneering companies. As the great Charles Mackay wrote in 1841: "Men, it has been
well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover
their senses slowly, and one by one." Nearly two hundred years later, these words are still
relevant as even nowadays men find it difficult to act against the herd while the herd goes
mad.


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in an effort to identify bubbles
before they implode. Our track record of success speaks for itself. In this report, we will be
exposing folly on the scale of our prior report on Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
(NASDAQ:MLNX) in September 2012 when the firm's shares were trading at a shocking
$119/share.


Canadian Pacific Introduction


Like Bill Ackman's legendary bicycle ride on the Montauk Highway last summer, the
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (the "Canadian Pacific" or the "Company") (NYSE:CP)
share price has recently spurted ahead of its comparables in an unsustainable fashion as
it has more than doubled to $126.96/share from $60.62/share before Ackman started his

activist campaign less than 18 months ago. While Canadian Pacific's recent share price
performance is impressive, investors may soon be yelping in pain like Mr. Ackman when
his Montauk bike-ride pace faded and debilitating leg-cramps set in.


Like its peer Canadian National Railway Company (CNI) [TSX: CNR] Canadian Pacific is
a Class 1, transcontinental mainline railway. A core tenet of the mainline rail business is
funneling as much rail traffic from feeders and connectors as possible onto a high-density
mainline railway network. Thus, the two main divers of railway profitability/cash-flow are
carload volumes and cost controls, both of which are intended to be maximized through
the economies of scale in the mainline business model. In addition, the railroading
business in general has high sustaining capital intensity, as both the physical track and the
rolling stock (locomotives and rail cars) require frequent maintenance and replacement to
sustain efficient and safe operations.


Canadian Pacific's potential economies-of-scale are significantly limited relative to its
peers because the Company operates a significantly smaller network of only 14,400 miles
of track through predominately rural areas with approximately 55% of the geographic
footprint in Canada and the remainder in the United States. For comparison, Canadian
National Railway operates the largest rail network and the only transcontinental network in
North America with over 20,600 route miles of track. Moreover, from an operational
perspective, Canadian Pacific is less competitive than its peers as it has a higher average
track grades because of its Canadian Rockies crossings (estimated 2-3%) which
significantly increases its fuel costs (with limited pass-through ability to customers), has
less United States connectivity, is more northerly, and has a higher mileage concentration
in Western Canada (~40% of volumes). The latter two factors drive increased winter
network outages due to snow, flooding, and landslides. Moreover, the steeper average
track grades and mountainous geographic footprint increases the capital intensity of the
business relative to its peers and makes it more difficult for even the most talented
management teams to affect operational improvements, such as average train velocities
and locomotive dwell times.


Recently, Canadian Pacific was subject to a proxy battle (publicly launched 10/28/11 when
shares were trading at $60.62/share) which was initiated by Mr. William Ackman of
Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. of New York ("Pershing Square"). Pershing
Square believed Canadian Pacific was ineffectively operating the railway and successfully
removed the prior C-suite management team as well as several sympathetic board
members. Pershing Square then was able to select Mr. E. Hunter Harrison as the new
Chairman of the Board and CEO for Canadian Pacific on 06/28/12. Mr. E. Hunter Harrison

is best known for his prior leadership of the Canadian National Railway Company and
Illinois Central Railroad Company, but his recent track-record is of more concern with the
$4bn bankruptcy of Dynegy Inc. and the independent finding of a "fraudulent conveyance"
of certain of the firm's key assets while he served as Chairman and CEO. Pershing
Square owns 24.2mm shares of CP, approximately 13.9% as of 12/31/12, for a current
market value of ~$3.1bn, or >30% of Pershing Square's total AUM.


Interestingly, Mr. William Ackman's subsequent activist campaign on Herbalife (NYSE:
HLF), which utilized the same techniques as his CP battle including a massive conference
presentation and extensive media engagement, almost immediately blew-up in his face as
the market quickly poked significant holes in his thesis and took a countervailing position,
driving the share price above the level before Pershing Square's presentation. While this
dynamic may take longer to play out for the CP situation, it seems the market could
quickly revert once these and other flaws are exposed in the Pershing Square investment
rationale for the Company.


Canadian Pacific Summary Valuation Metrics:


Interestingly, during the proxy contest, one of the purported failures highlighted by
Pershing Square of the prior management team of Canadian Pacific was its 10/30/08
acquisition of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation ("DM&E") for
~$1.8bn at an 18.0X LTM EBIT multiple. Astute investors would note that because of the
recent run-up in Canadian Pacific's share price, the Company is currently valued at a
shocking three full turns higher at 21.1x LTM EBIT.


Investment Thesis: SHORT Canadian Pacific


Because of the recent and unsuitable run-up in equity valuation, Canadian Pacific is a
compelling short opportunity because of 1) an irrational market assumption regarding the
timing and feasibility of the railroad operational improvement plan, 2) sub-optimal
corporate governance oversight, and 3) impending Pershing Square liquidation of CP
common stock following the implosion of their recent J.C. Penney Company, Inc.

(NYSE:JCP) investment and limited partner redemptions following their bolloxing of the
Herbalife situation coupled with a purported SEC investigation into Pershing Square's
trading activity.


The current irrational market behavior appears to exist because many investors have
been blindly riding the coat-tails of Pershing Square's pre-2012 success on such names
as MBIA Inc.(NYSE:MBI) and General Growth Properties Inc. (NYSE:GGP); which
conveniently overlooks Ackman's prior implosion of Gotham Partners and failed activist
investments in Borders and Target. These primarily Canadian-based individuals, funds
and sell-side analysts are largely playing a momentum trade, not a fundamental
investment, in CP shares. Further, in their blind following of Bill Ackman, it seems that they
are quick to forget that Pershing Square's position has been completely illiquid to date,
due to the size of the position and reputation risks of selling shortly after installing their
own management team. Finally, the risk of a merger take-out, long rumored, seems
extremely diminished at this point in time because of the exceedingly rich valuation of CP
relative to its peers and anti-trust regulatory concerns in Canada and the United States.


Canadian Pacific Turn-Around Plan is Fatally Flawed


CP shares are currently pricing in full achievement, with no room for shortfalls or delays,
of an aggressive turn-around plan. This plan contemplates both achieving an Operating
Ratio ("OR") of ~65% by 2016 and generating a revenue CAGR of over 6% from 2012-
2016. The lowest annual OR that CP has achieved in the last 20 years was 75.3%,
approximately 1,000bps above the OR that the stock is currently discounting and also the
most recent 4q12 performance by Mr. E. Hunter Harrison. Moreover, CP was on the only
Class 1 railroad to have significantly lower train velocity on their network, YoY, in January
2013. CP is clearly trading as a "story" instead of an investment based on the underlying
operational performance of the business at this time.

Of particular note, the market seems to believe CP can transition from a bottom decile OR
performer to a market-leading firm in less than four years. Moreover, CP Management and
sell-side estimates earnings estimates are paired with exceedingly aggressive CAPEX
intensity targets, as forecasted CAPEX spend is to be below both CP and CNI precedents.
Simply put, in railroading, it is difficult to increase operational efficiency without sustained
investment in new equipment and technology to both capture incremental efficiency
improvements in new technologies and avoid equipment malfunctions and delays
associated with service outages and delays.


Blood on the Tracks: Oil-on-Rails Future Potential is Over-Played


In addition to a dramatic operational improvement, CP bulls have priced-in significant
revenue growth from crude oil-on-rails transport as oil/gas producers choose to ship
liquids from Alberta and North Dakota via rail versus being subject to heavy negative
pricing differentials on the constrained existing pipeline capacity. Mr. E. Hunter Harrison,
CP's Chairman and CEO, has done little to temper investors' expectations, declaring on

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 6/28


the 10/24/12 investors call, 'If you put it [oil-on-rails projects] all together, it'll make people
forget the Gold Rush in 1849." CP has attempted to capitalize on the boom in crude
transport, forecasting its ~$90mm in CAPEX will allow it to transport nearly 70,000
carloads a year by 2014, up from the only approximately 500 carloads in 2009.


Because of some current pipeline capacity constraints in moving liquids out of Alberta and
North Dakota, the crude oil pricing differential to PADD III (Gulf Coast) has been
~$30/barrel, making rail-transport a price-competitive alternative at this time. However, as
the Keystone XL, Northern Gateway, and TransMountain pipeline expansion projects
move closer to fruition, astute investors should remember that, on a mile-for-mile basis,
pipeline transport of crude is roughly half the cost of transport via rail and is significantly
safer with lower probability of catastrophic spills or leaks. Moreover, the pricing dislocation
between crude and natural gas has significantly crimped demand for coal, further limiting
CP's potential for consolidated volume and revenue growth.


Just last week on 03/27/13, CP demonstrated the significant dangers of shipping crude oil
via rail when 14 cars on its 94-car train heading for the Chicago area crashed off the CP
tracks approximately 150 miles northwest of Minneapolis near the town of Parkers Prairie.
The derailed crude tanks released a gusher of more than 30,000 gallons of untreated
crude oil onto the prairie, shutting the rail line for an estimated 2-3 days, and requiring a
massive remediation effort to clean up the literal river of crude oil. Luckily, the derailing
happened in a relatively rural area and the spilled crude did not combust, but this is a
poignant example of the potential risks of shipping highly volatile cargos on relatively old
tracks. Moreover, it reiterates the importance of the continuous CAPEX investment
required to ensure tracks and trains remain in safe and efficient operating condition.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 7/28


As an analogy to the current oil-on-rails mania, investors would be well-served to review
CP's disastrous 10/30/08 acquisition of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad
Corporation ("DM&E") for ~$1.8bn at an 18.0X LTM EBIT multiple. At the time of the
acquisition, bullish investors were excited about CP's possibly to start hauling Powder
River Basin ("PRB") coal and capture a portion of the rich "dark-spread" pricing differential
between natural gas and coal commodities at the time. Moreover, DM&E's 70% OR at the
time of acquisition was supposed to be accretive to CP's operating statistics. However, CP
paid this significant premium to become the 3  rail provider in the PRC basin, a relatively
weak strategic position in freight negotiations with potential customers. In 4q12, CP
announced it was indefinitely deferring plans to complete the expansion of its rail network
within the PRB region and was forced to take a $180mm impairment on construction and
land option expenses.

Like the CP's strategic position in the PRB for coal, CP is also competing with BNSF and
CNI for oil on rail shipments, both of whom arguably have better and faster network
connections with the Bakken field and PADD II/III refineries. With CP currently trading at
21.1x LTM EBIT, investors should consider purchasing the Company at the current market
valuation as a replay similar to the DM&E acquisition disaster.


Post-Pershing: An improvement in governance?


After all the drama involving Pershing Square's proxy rebellion, investors seem to be
blindly assuming that new slate of management and Board of Directors will result in a
dramatic increase in operational efficiency and shareholder returns. However, a closer
review of their respective biographies raises some significant governance concerns.


E. Hunter Harrison: Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer


Mr. E. Hunter Harrison is best known for his prior leadership of the Canadian National
Railway Company and Illinois Central Railroad Company, but his recent track-record is of
more concern with the $4bn bankruptcy of Dynegy Inc. and the independent finding of a
"fraudulent conveyance" of certain of the firm's key assets while he served as Chairman
and CEO. Also, it is difficult to understand how Mr. E. Hunter Harrison can serve as a
"hands-on" manager as he still resides in Wellington, Florida, approximately 5,000km from
CP's corporate headquarters in Calgary, Alberta. Also, investors should compare the fact
that Mr. E. Hunter Harrison purchased CP stock at a significantly lower VWAP relative to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 9/28


the current market price as part of the proxy battle should also be compared against his
purchase of the similar amount of Dynegy stock, which is now worth $0/share following
the firm's bankruptcy.


Moreover, after the dramatic run-up in CP's share price, it seems prudent for investors to
remember Warren Buffett's (a now proven rail-road investor and executive, in addition to
all his other accomplishments) extremely prescient quote from 1989, "When a
management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for
bad economics, it is generally the reputation of the business that remains intact."


Richard C. Kelly: Board of Directors and Chairman of the Audit Committee, Finance


Mr. Kelly was President and Chief Executive Officer of NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG"), a
former subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. from June 6, 2002 to May 14, 2003, and a director of
NRG from June 2000 to May 14, 2003. In May 2003, NRG and certain of NRG's affiliates
filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
to restructure their debt, wiping out equity holders.


The Hon. John P. Manley: Board of Directors, Audit and Finance Committee


Mr. Manley was a director of Nortel Networks Corporation and Nortel Networks Limited
(collectively, the "Nortel Companies") when the Nortel Companies applied for and were
granted creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act on January
14, 2009, wiping out equity holders. In addition, as a result of the announcement in May
2004 by Nortel Companies of the need to restate certain of their previously reported
financial results, the Ontario Securities Commission made a final order on May 31, 2004
prohibiting all trading by directors, officers and certain current and former employees
including J.P. Manley.


William A. Ackman: Board of Directors, Corporate Governance and Finance
Committee


William A. Ackman is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Pershing Square Capital
Management, L.P. Pershing Square Capital Management had an economic exposure to
more than 40% of the stock of Borders Group, Inc. ("Borders") via a combination of
common shares and cash-settled total return swaps at the time of the company's Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing on 06/16/11, which wiped out all equity holders as
the firm was liquidated. It is estimated that Pershing Square investors lost in excess of
$200mm on its investment in Borders.


Paul C. Hilal: Board of Directors, Finance and Compensation Committee

Paul C. Hilal is a Partner at Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. Pershing Square
Capital Management had an economic exposure to more than 40% of the stock of Borders
Group, Inc. ("Borders") via a combination of common shares and cash-settled total return
swaps at the time of the company's Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing on
06/16/11. It is estimated that Pershing Square investors lost in excess of $200mm on its
investment in Borders.


Rebecca MacDonald: Board of Directors, Finance and Compensation Committee


Rebecca MacDonald is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Just Energy Group Inc.,
an independent marketer of deregulated gas and electricity, and previously founded
Energy Marketing, Inc. Just Energy has hit the skids over the last year, with its shares
down 48.1% on an LTM basis and allegations of accounting fraud circling.


Pershing Square Will Become a Forced Seller


After reviewing the current market dynamic, it appears an impending Pershing Square
liquidation of CP common stock is looming. First, Pershing Square's high-profile
investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. has imploded after the last year as Bill
Ackman's hand-picked CEO, Ron Johnson, alienated the Board of Directors and failed to
halt a >30% decline in same-store sales. It is estimated that Pershing Square has lost
>$200mm on their JCP investment.


Next, on 12/19/12, Bill Ackman launched a high-profile short-sale campaign against
Herbalife Inc. After Ackman publicly admitted to shorting over 20mm HLF shares, Third
Point and Icahn Associates took an opposing long position, driving share prices higher
than the price before the Pershing Square presentation in a "mother of all short-
squeezes." As the Pershing Square limited partner begin to realize a significant portion of
their net worth is now tied to a single controversial stock, investor redemptions are posed
to skyrocket. Investor redemptions will require Pershing Square to liquidate its long
positions, such as its largest holding CP. Finally, based on the SEC FOIA response in
Appendix 1, it appears the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is now
investigating Pershing Square and William Ackman's trading regarding Herbalife. This will
also likely cause LPs to reconsider their association with Ackman and CP.


It is also important to review the differences in the background and perspective of the
notable self-made investor Carl Icahn, who grew his net worth inch by inch over decades
with investment acumen, as opposed to Bill Ackman, who primarily grew rich from
management fees on billions of others people money under management. Moreover,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1314411-canadian-pacific-railway-off-the-tracks-after-ackman 11/28


Ackman appears to have taken an inordinate sizing risk as the trading volume of CP
indicates that Pershing Square's position is way too large for a dynamic capital fund
should he face any redemptions in the future.


Precedent Transaction Multiples and Canadian Resource Protectionism Limits Take-
Over Risk


Below are ALL the significant railroad mergers in North America in the last 20 years with a
transaction value great than $1bn. Please note this is also the same comparable
transactions peer-set Evercore utilized in its fairness opinion for the BNSF acquisition by
Berkshire Hathaway.


Based on these precedent transaction multiples, it seems difficult to believe that even if
the United States and Canadian anti-trust regulators would approve further consolidation
within the industry, that a strategic acquirer could afford to pay more than 7-10x CP's LTM
EBITDA, or $47.63-$78.78/share. In addition, the Brookfield Asset Management and
Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec buyout consortium that purportedly expressed a
preliminary indication of interest in CP back in 2007 would be unable to stump up the
>$30bn premium enterprise value check and limited capacity for additional leverage,
which is more than double the enterprise value of CP back in 2007 when rumors started to
circulate within the marketplace.


Moreover, because of the recent displays of Canadian resource nationalism and
protectionism, it seems unlikely that Canadian anti-trust regulators would allow one of its
two remaining Class 1 railroads be acquired by foreign firm or merged into another
railroad. First, on 04/10/08, the Canadian Government blocked the proposed $1.3bn sale

of Canadian aerospace and information technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler &
Associates Ltd. to U.S. defense company Alliant Techsystems Inc. on national security
grounds under the Investment Canada Act, which is rather ironic considering Canada has
never been invaded! Under the Investment Canada Act, rulings are made by the industry
minister, a politician, and require only that the proposed transaction show a "net benefit" to
Canada, a largely subjective assessment. Second, on 11/02/10, Canadian Government
again utilized the Investment Canada Act to block the proposed $38.6bn purchase of
Potash Corporation, a Saskatchewan fertilizer miner and producer, by BHP Billiton, a large
Australian mining company. Most recently, on 03/20/12, Gencore International PLC was
required to make several adverse deal structure concessions, such as divesting assets
which comprise a majority of the Canadian operations segments to Agrium Inc. and
Richardson International Ltd., to ensure regulatory approval for its $6.1bn acquisition of
Viterra Inc., a global grain and logistics business that was headquartered in
Saskatchewan. In addition, Canadian protectionism concerns have been raised in the
Nexen and Progress oil/gas transactions as foreign acquirers have pursued companies
listed in Canada (never mind the fact that a majority of the respective target companies'
assets were outside Canada).


Thus, based on these recent poignant examples of Canadian resource nationalism and
protectionism being utilized to derail merger agreements with compelling industrial logic, it
seems unlikely any rational railroad peer would attempt a take-over or merger run at
Canadian Pacific in light of its extremely rich valuation metrics and the adverse
geopolitical environment.


Pair-Trade Possibility: Short CP / Long CNI


Because CP is up a shocking 51% over the last 6-months versus 11% for CNI and 67%
versus 24% for the last 12 months, respectively, a pair-trade with a short CP leg and long
CNI leg may be attractive for those with a bullish macro perspective. In addition, because
CP currently trades at a significant valuation premium to CNI, it is likely this relative
valuation dichotomy will converge over time. Moreover, CNI should benefit from a more
robust operating history and key structural advantages of 1) larger network size, 2) higher
US exposure, and 3) more efficient track operations.

5/20/2018 Canadian Pacific Railway: Off The Tracks After Ackman - Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) | Seeking Alpha

While a pair-trade introduces some basis and tracking risk to the investment thesis, it
seems to be an appropriate macro hedge in light of increased interest in infrastructure
investing and potential bulk commodity demand volatility.


Conclusion


Like our previous report on Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. in September 2012 when the
firm's shares were trading at a shocking $119/share, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited
(NYSE/TSX: CP) is an overvalued company with limited potential upside. Below are the
top five reasons why long investors should consider selling their position in CP or why
aggressive traders should consider entering into a short-sale position:


1. After rallying over 67% over the last twelve months and outperforming all peers,
CP shares have entered unsustainable levels based on irrational market
assumptions regarding the timing and feasibility of the Company's operational
improvement plan.


2. Potential business growth for crude oil via rail transport has been overplayed
and is detrimental to more important coal transport.


3. Sub-optimal corporate governance structure and the Board of Directors
composition raises serious concerns about prior risk tolerances, accounting
issues, and bankruptcy filings at such issuers as Dynegy, NRG, Nortel, Borders,
and Just Energy.


4. After bolloxing their JCP and HLF trades and under investigation by the SEC,
Pershing Square may be required to begin selling down a significant portion
their oversized CP position, which has been completely illiquid to date, in order
to meet investor redemptions and reduce portfolio risk exposures


5. Pair-trade with Canadian National Railway Company can be utilized to reduce
macro risk exposure.
