Executive Summary


Question:  What do you do when your stock price declines by 50%, your diluted share count
doubles due to egregious stock based compensation and poorly structured financing rounds
with ill-conceived ratchets, and your business model is structurally broken less than two years
after your mispriced IPO?


 Answer:  Why of course you announce a business model pivot on the back of nebulous non-
GAAP metrics, concoct a story about a low-cost customer acquisition channel that ignores
intense competition from Amazon.com and other economic realities, alter past financial
metrics lower to overstate current period growth, create ebullient out-year financial targets
only to surreptitiously adjust the target date and growth rates when results are below plan,
reclassify your pro-forma revenue definition multiple times  –  while including physical goods-
related revenue in your newly classified digital revenue category (attracting SEC
correspondence in the process), further inflate revenue growth rates by recording one-time
inventory transfers as profitless revenue, boast about your strong 80% [monthly] customer
retention rate  –  which translates into something closer to 93% annual churn  when the fine


 print is read, claim to grow subscribers 40% despite your own subscriber figure from the prior
year’s press release suggesting growth of 15%, inflate EBITDA by increasing capitalized
expenses 340% year-over-year (as a % of revenue), make 10 acquisitions that obfuscate
organic growth (and subsequently write-off multiple deals), and exclude “non -recurring”
items from adjusted financial results for ten consecutive quarters  to magically transform deep
operating losses and cash burn into marginally positive adjusted EBITDA. And that run-on
sentence is just the beginning…  


Sell- side promotions and “hope - based” investments are often built on the foundation of a
strategic business model pivot. These stories dismiss years of disappointing operating and
financial execution as yesterday’s news. Management teams and their cadre of sell -side


 promoters instead encourage investors to focus on non-GAAP metrics and aspirational target
models years into the future. As a result, accounting warts, irreconcilable financial results, and
operating inconsistencies that would traditionally cause severe stock price declines, can be
marginalized and ignored… at least until the story is busted.


We believe Chegg, Inc. (CHGG) is an orchestrated promote. The carefully constructed,
disingenuous bull thesis, is that CHGG is in the midst of a transition from a low margin
textbook rental business into a high growth, high margin digital educational services
company. This report extensively details why we believe CHGG has fabricated pro-forma
financial results, misrepresented its unit economics, and repeatedly provided misleading
metrics that are subsequently altered. Based on recent correspondence with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), and conspicuous changes to its financial reporting, we believe
CHGG’s shenanigans discussed herein are under the microscope.


Like most promotes, CHGG and its sell-side partners use buzzwords and endorsements that
appear to legitimize the story. For example, the sell-side points out that the company was
initially funded by prominent venture capital firms such as Foundation Capital, Insight
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________4


Venture Partners, and Kleiner Perkins. The CEO, who was the former COO at Yahoo!, is a
veteran Silicon Valley executive who “talks the talk” when discussing the transition from a
capital intensive textbook rental business to a high margin digital services business. On its
most recent earnings call, the word “Platform” was used eleven  times to describe the new
operating model, while Google, Netflix, Spotify, and Uber were audaciously listed as
“compelling macro trend” comps in the most recent investor deck. Bu lls paint a compelling


 picture of a textbook rental customer base that creates a low cost competitive advantage for
Chegg Services to acquire customers. Without appropriate diligence, management’s  elevator


 pitch sounds enticing to retail investors and resonates with analysts.


We believe there is one problem with the compelling investment story…IT IS FICTION . 


CHGG’s strategic business model pivot has been marked by underperforming acquisitions,
weak execution, intense competition, and value destruction. W orse still, we believe CHGG’s
management has utilized accounting gimmickry, deceptive segment reorganizations, and non-
GAAP adjustments that directly violate SEC reporting standards. Management has
consistently inflated the company’s non -GAAP profitability by excluding acquisition-related
compensation costs, transitional logistic charges, and/or restructuring charges for 10
consecutive quarters, while simultaneously including  one-time gains on textbook
liquidations. Management’s vague “pro forma” revenue me tric is devoid of the reconciliations
required by the SEC’s Reg. G, while the company’s aggressive and inconsistent investor


 presentations appear designed to consistently overstate organic revenue growth.


CHGG’s core textbook rental business is in secula r decline marked by commoditization and
intense competition from Amazon, Pearson, and others. By management’s own admission, the
textbook rental segment, which serves as the low-cost customer acquisition funnel for digital
services, will decline by at least 10% in 2016 and 2017. Rather than candidly address the


 pervasive challenges in CHGG’s core business, management has pursued a “digital” business
strategy through subscale, poorly performing acquisitions. Over the last six years, CHGG has
acquired 10 companies, of which four have been total write-offs, and just one has performed
to plan.


The amalgamation of these ten acquired properties represents CHGG’s supposed high -growth,
high-margin digital services segment. But the facts tell a different story. We believe CHGG’s
management made multiple alterations to its segment reporting to obfuscate the floundering,
low visibility, dynamics of its digital segment. Previously, management stated that its all-
important digital revenue growth would be 60% in 2016. Our analysis suggests 60% growth is
a blatant misrepresentation and digital revenue growth will be just 16% in 2016. Additionally,


 based on CHGG’s own disclosures, we show that customer churn in digital services is
approximately 93% annually . And while management claims its fastest growing services


 business, Chegg Tutors, will pull blended corporate margins higher, our analysis shows this
segment generates a mere 30% gross margin.


We believe management has persistently altered its reporting methods to flatter digital
growth. As such, it comes as no surprise that CHGG’s historical revenue reporting segments
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________5


are replete with discrepancies that fail to reconcile from quarter-to-quarter. In the last three
years, CHGG has reported three different revenue derivations, which we believe blatantly
overstates digital revenue growth and masks an inability to hit financial targets. The SEC
appears to share our confusion based on its correspondence with CHGG management asking
for an explanation for certain revenue segment reporting.


While management’s promotional cadence has been self -enriching, shareholders have
suffered. In CHGG’s 10 -year history, management has raised more than $400 million,
including $180 million from the company’s IPO just three years ago. Despite  incessant capital
raises, CHGG has (i) never generated a profit, (ii) has an accumulated deficit of $370 million,
and (iii) will end 2016 with less than $60 million of cash in the bank before  considering $35
million of acquisition earn-out obligations and expected free cash flow burn of $25 million.


 No wonder sell-side analysts have been such unabashed supporters!


Like all promotes, the too-good-to-be-true story can only persist for so long before facts
trump fiction. While CHGG beat sandbagged Q3 guidance (Chegg Services revenue was
down sequentially despite only a partial quarter of its Imagine Easy acquisition in Q2’16), the
company guided Q4 below consensus estimates and cut 2017 expectations. We believe more
negative revenue revisions are coming. With CHGG’s accounting shenanigans exposed,
competitive pressures intensifying, and 2017 guidance that appears highly unobtainable, we


 believe the rubber will soon meet the road. CHGG’s pivot is near ly complete and in 2017
management can no longer utilize its “pro -forma revenue” cookie jar to hide poor results. We


 believe CHGG is trapped and management’s only options are (i) attempt larger acquisitions to
 plug the impending revenue hole, or (ii) confess that actual growth rates and profitability are
less than what management has led investors to believe.


We believe CHGG’s intrinsic value is less than $2.00 per share, which would represent
75% downside from the current trading price.


*****************


This initial report details the following topics, representing just the tip of the shenanigans on
the CHGG iceberg:


1) CHGG’s inauspicious background and value -destroying CEO
 I. Disastrous pre-IPO ratchets have caused substantial shareholder dilution


 Increasingly onerous ratchet conditions on multiple rounds of pre-IPO financing and
indefensible stock-  based compensation have resulted in the unjust enrichment of CHGG’s
management at the expense of its unaffiliated shareholders. In less than three years,
shareholders have suffered nearly 100% dilution.


 II. Dan Ro  sensweig’s dubious leadership track record  
 Mr. Rosensweig served as CEO or COO of three companies prior to CHGG. He destroyed


significant value at all three companies.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________6


 Mr. Rosensweig was most recently CEO of Guitar Hero, one of the most popular video
game franchises in history. Under Mr. Rosensweig’s stewardship, sales collapsed, a
leadership change ensued within one year, and Guitar Hero was temporarily discontinued.


2) CHGG’s textbook rental business is commoditized & faces increased competition  
 A bullish perspective on CHGG assumes the company’s textbook rental business can


serve as a low cost customer acquisition channel for its higher growth, higher margin
digital segment. This thesis appears to be false. Based on our analysis, CHGG’s textbook
rental business has decelerated for three consecutive years and will decline  by nearly 10%
in 2016.


 Amazon has entered the textbook rental business and is aggressively targeting CHGG’s
core customer base. Barnes & Noble Education, which operates over 750 college


 bookstores, recently launched a price match guarantee.
 Based on reviews of textbook rental comparison sites, CHGG is generally the most


expensive rental option.


3) Chegg Services stability, margins, and growth characteristics are misrepresented
 I. Chegg Services faces persistently high customer churn


 CHGG management claims Chegg Services renewal rate is 80%. However, management
does not openly highlight that this is a monthly renewal rate. Annual churn is
approximately 93%. Claims that Chegg Services is a recurring business are false.  


 II. Chegg Tutors pricing implies management misrepresented gross margins  
 Management claims overall gross margins will be driven substantially higher by growth In


Chegg Services. However, public disclosures do not support m anagement’s claims.
CHGG’s fastest growing digital business, Chegg Tutors, appears to have gross margins of


 just ~30%.
 III. Management has historically squandered shareholder capital through poor acquisitions


 In the last six years, CHGG has spent nearly $140 million of shareholder capital on 10
acquisitions.


 4 of the 10 acquired companies/products have been shut down or discontinued, while 3
acquisitions are behind plan.


 Based on our analysis, we believe just one of management’s growth acquisitions is
 performing to plan.


 IV. Chegg Services subscriber growth is significantly overstated
 While CHGG management claims subscriber growth accelerated in Q3’16 to over 40%,


we believe management furtively revised the metric to exclude declining eTextbook
customers and included Imagine Easy subscribers.


 Based on our analysis, normalized subscriber growth decelerated to just 15% in Q3.


4) CHGG has consistently misrepresented its financial & segment reporting
1. Management has repeatedly reorganized reporting segments to artificially inflate digital


 growth
 Since CHGG came public three years ago, management has reported revenue under three


different segment derivations.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________7


 Each revenue reclassification appears to coincide with a specific quarter in which
management would have failed to achieve its financial targets.


 II. Normalized digital revenue growth is significantly below management’s target  
 Based on company disclosures, we believe normalized digital revenue growth would be


 just 16% in 2016 had management maintained consistent reporting segments.
 III. Multiple revenue reclassifications have discrepancies with reported pro forma financials


 In August 2015, CHGG management publicly stated pro forma revenue was $142.7
million in 2014.


 In February 2016, the same 2014 historical  revenue was inexplicably adjusted downwards
 by 6% to $134 million.


 We believe the alteration of historical pro forma results was intended to set a lower bar in
 previous years to artificially enhance perceived current year growth.


 IV. The SEC requested info rmation regarding CHGG’s revenue reclassifications
 In December 2015, the SEC sought an explanation for why management included


CHGG’s Ingram commission on physical textbook rentals in its “digital” segment.  
 CHGG management defended its segment reporting in correspondence with the SEC.


However, just two months later, management again altered its revenue classifications in
what appeared to be another brazen tactic to obfuscate organic growth.


V. Did CHGG’s inventory transfer sales to Ingram artificially infl ate revenue?
 Under CHGG’s GAAP filings, the company’s “Sales” line item includes just -in-time sales


of print textbooks and other required materials.  
 Our analysis shows “Sales” revenue should correlate with “Rental” revenue. However, in


2014 and 2015, “Sales” revenue inexplicably re -accelerated, diverging from “Rental”
revenue declines.  


 We believe CHGG artificially inflated revenue growth by recording initial inventory
transfers to Ingram as profitless revenue.  


VI. CHGG appears to be in direct violation with SEC Regulation G
 Despite the SEC’s recent Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations on perceived non -


GAAP financial reporting abuses, CHGG management appears to willfully disregard
Regulation G with its reporting of non-GAAP profitability and revenue metrics.  


5) Management’s egregious compensation & other conflicts of interest  
 I. Abusive stock compensation transfers value from investors to management  


 CHGG spends nearly 23% of its pro forma revenue on stock-based compensation, which
is more than 500% greater than its peer group.


 Sell-side models appear to neglect over 11 million anti-dilutive shares from the
company’s current share count because CHGG is unprofitable.  


 At market prices, a potential acquirer would need to absorb a 12% increase in the
outstanding shares based on vesting schedules and current options.


 II. Management’s excessive pay is not tied to performance  
 In 2015, CHGG failed to achieve all performance based compensation targets and the total


shareholder return was negative. In recognitio n of this “performance,” the Board of
Directors rewarded Mr. Rosensweig with $10 million of compensation.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________8


 Since coming public three years ago, CHGG’s stock price has declined by 45%,
underperformed the Russell 2000 by 60%, and management has repeatedly missed


 performance targets. Nonetheless, Mr. Rosensweig has received nearly $24 million in
compensation.


6) Weak operating performance, cash burn, & acquisition earn-outs impair the
balanced sheet  


 I. Management has misrepresented recent business momentum
 In Q2’ 16, CHGG management boasted that EBITDA more than doubled year-over-year.  
 Excluding one-time gains/losses on textbooks liquidations, EBITDA actually declined  


year-over-year.  
 II. Significant increases in capitalized expenses may be overstating EBITDA


 After exiting textbook rentals, CHGG should have minimal capital intensity.  
 Historically CHGG spent 2- 3% of revenue on capital expenditures. However, YTD’16


capitalized expenditures inexplicably jumped to 9% of revenue.  
 III. Management quietly pushed out its target operating model by one year


 Throughout CHGG’s transition from a textbook rental company to a digital business,
management has stated its target operating model of 25% revenue growth, 60% gross
margins, and 25% EBITDA margins would be achieved by 2017.


 In early 2016, without explanation, management inexplicably moved its target model date
to 2018 and lowered its growth target in an investor presentation.


 IV. CHGG’s business model(s) perpetually destroy capital and burn cash  
 In its most recent earnings call, management stated CHGG generates a lot of cash.
 This statement is patently false. In less than three years, CHGG’s cash balance has


declined from $160 million to less than $60 million.
 Despite relying on excessive stock-based compensation in lieu of cash compensation,


management expects to burn ~$25 million of free cash flow in 2016.
V. Imagine Easy earn- out payments may impair CHGG’s balance sheet  
 In addition to paying $25 million to close its Imagine Easy acquisition, CHGG committed


to a $35 million incremental earn-out, with $27 million due in 2017.
 With approximately $55 million of cash at year-end and an annual burn rate exceeding


$25 million, we believe CHGG will need to access the capital markets in 2017.


7) Rubber mee ts the road in 2017 & VC’s and insiders are voting with their feet  
 I. CHGG will struggle to meet 2017 guidance


 Based on our analysis Chegg Services’ revenue has decelerated for three years to under
30% growth. To achieve 2017 guidance, the segment’s growth  must meaningfully
reaccelerate.


 II. VCs and insiders heading for the exits before the next reset
 Three of CHGG’s top six pre -IPO investors have sold their entire positions for a loss.
 Since August 2016, CHGG’s Chief Product Officer has sold more than 80% of his


holdings.


8) CHGG is significantly overvalued
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________9


 I. CHGG trades at a substantial premium to education-focused peers and a broader consumer
internet basket
 CHGG trades at 42x EV/EBITDA compared to 5x -7x for publicly traded education-


focused peers.
 Despite GAAP revenue declines, decelerating pro forma revenue growth, negative free


cash flow, and a structurally broken business model, CHGG trades at a substantial
 premium to both AMZN and LNKD.


 II. Generous valuation implies 75%+ downside
 Applying a generous  peer group valuation multiple, we believe CHGG’s intrinsic value is


$1.72, or 75% lower than recent market prices.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________10


1) CHGG’s inauspicious background and value -destroying CEO


 I. Disastrous pre-IPO ratchets have caused substantial shareholder dilution


“There will be a time when this bull market ends, and when it does these ratchets will be very
 painful”  
*** Neeraj Agrawal, General Partner at Battery Ventures 1 


CHGG was founded in 2005 by Aayush Phumbhra, an Iowa State graduate student, with the
objective of saving college students money by allowing them to rent rather than buy
textbooks. 2 Since its inception, CHGG has raised more than $400 million, or 67% of its
current $600 million enterprise value. 3  As we will discuss in detail later, CHGG has
recklessly destroyed over $300 million of capital through operating losses, capital
expenditures, and disappointing acquisitions.


How has CHGG managed to raise nearly half-a-billion dollars despite never generating a
 profit, never trading above its IPO price, and attempting to redesign its operating model two
years after going public? One word  –  ratchets. According to a Wall Street Journal article,
“Valuation -Hungry Startups Should Heed Chegg’s Disastrous IPO ‘Ratchet’”, CHGG’s
management chose to grant onerou s “ratchet” provisions to investors to achieve the highest


 possible valuation. 4  While it may be easy to argue “the past is the past,” we believe
management teams have hardwired DNA, and a troubling pattern exists at CHGG of self-
serving actions that conflict with the interests of unaffiliated shareholders.


These ratchet provisions provide investors in specific rounds incremental shares if future
capital raises occur below a specified price (e.g., at IPO). While ratchet provisions provide
anti-dilution protection to certain investors, early investors and employees can suffer extreme
dilution.


CHGG management first offered ratchet provisions as part of the company’s series D
financing round in 2009. 5 According to an early angel investor, and former CHGG board

member, Oren Zeev, CHGG received multiple financing offers without ratchets. Nevertheless,
CHGG’s management chose the ratchet deal because it provided an initial 20% higher
valuation. 6 In exchange for this paper-based wealth creation, CHGG provided Insight Venture
Partners a “2x” ratchet provision. Simply, Insight would either double their money, or
CHGG’s management would issue additional shares to Insight at the expense of earlier
investors and employees. 7 


Despite the notoriety of ratchet rounds, CHGG management raised two subsequent VC rounds
with ratchet provisions, each with conditions more onerous than the last. How aggressive was
management? Two of CHGG’s fundraising rounds required the company to IPO at a price
greater than $25 in order to avoid triggering the ratchets. 8 Due to clear missteps on the part of
management, CHGG’s final round of pre -IPO financing, its Series F round, was raised at a


 price below its previous two rounds (the dreaded “down round”). Although management must
have known the company faced a significant overhang due to its prior two ratchet rounds at


 prices CHGG would not achieve, management again chose to raise capital with a ratchet
 provision at $12.00. 9 


When CHGG filed its public prospectus, the IPO price range was set between $9.50 and
$11.50. 10 Despite tepid institutional interest in its IPO, CHGG management priced its IPO at
$12.50, thus avoiding dilution from the additional Series F ratchet. While management was


 protected, the stock price declined by 23% on its first day of trading and has never traded at
its IPO price. Due to the company’s prior two capital raises with ratchet provisions, CHGG
was forced to issue 13.1 million additional  shares on its IPO, which resulted in 25% dilution
to new shareholders.

Because of CHGG’s costly ratchets and egregious stock compensation grants (detailed later),
 pre-IPO shareholders have suffered nearly 90% dilution in less than three years.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH

 II. Dan Rosensweig’s dubious leadership track record  


A focal theme of the CHGG bull thesis is that company management has created value for
shareholders in past endeavors. For example, a BMO Capital Markets report stated, “We


 believe Chegg has a very solid management team with a demonstrated track record of success.
We note several members of the management team have occupied high positions in very
successful Silicon Valley tech companies, including the company’s CEO, Dan Rosensweig,
who previously worked as the chief operating officer of Yahoo!” 11 


The facts would sugges t management’s “achievements” warrant extreme caution. Prior to
 becoming CHGG’s CEO, Mr. Rosensweig held leadership roles at three companies –  ZDNet,
the technology news and information site, Yahoo!, and Guitar Hero. We believe Mr.
Rosensweig unambiguously destroyed shareholder value at each of his prior companies and
the recent CHGG promotion appears to mirror the value destroying playbook of his past
ventures.


From 1997  –  2000, Mr. Rosensweig was President and CEO of ZDNet, which he took public
in March 1999. In a sign of the times, ZDNet’s share price nearly doubled in its first day of
trading, closing at $36.00 from a $19.00 IPO price. 12 The stock would never again reach this
level. In an eerily similar pattern to CHGG, ZDNet commenced a reorganization and business


 pivot shortly after its IPO. Also mirroring CHGG’s strategy of obfuscating organic growth,
Mr. Rosensweig quickly acquired six companies in the span of just nine months. 13 ZDNet
investors did not fall for Mr. Rosensweig’s hollow strategy. During  the greatest bubble of our
lifetime, when companies like Webvan raised hundreds-of- millions of dollars without
sustainable business models, ZDNet’s stock price declined by 75%. 14 , 15  According to
Advertising Age, “ZDNet's investors have battered the stock in part because no one seems to
know what the company will be when all is said and done.” 16  While it might sound
convenient to use the internet bubble crash as a scapegoat for Mr. Ros ensweig’s failures at
ZDNet, we would point out that the during the time period ZDNet lost 75% of its value the


 Nasdaq  gained  61%. 17

After the ZDNet debacle, Mr. Rosensweig joined Terry Semel in 2002 to transform Yahoo!
into a media business. Mr. Rosensweig served as COO at Yahoo! from 2002 to 2006, which
encompassed historic strategic blunders. During Mr. Rosensweig’s tenure, Yahoo! (a) had the
chance to buy Google, (b) failed to buy Google, which subsequently usurped Yahoo!’s search
dominance, (c) purchased Overture for $1.4 billion, (d) failed to integrate Overture
successfully, (e) failed on its opportunity to buy a start-up called Facebook for $1 billion, and
finally (f) was forced to undo its entire media strategy and revert back to Yahoo!’s technology
roots. 18 Mr. Rosensweig departed Yahoo! during a management shakeup in late 2006 that was
marked by investor and employee unrest. 19 According to an Associated Press article at the
time, the reorganization represented “Yahoo’s mea culpa  for meandering aimlessly during the


 past year, to the chagrin of investors and the delight of competitors like Google Inc. that lured
away online traffic and advertisers.” 20 In 2008, Business Insider ran an article titled, “Was
Yahoo’s Terry Semel the Worst Internet CEO Ever?” 21  If Mr. Semel was indeed in the
running for “Worst Internet CEO Ever,” what does that say about Mr. Rosensweig as COO?  


Despite his poor track record at ZDNet and Yahoo!, Mr. Rosensweig was again given a
wonderful opportunity when he became CEO of Guitar Hero, which was at the time the
fastest-selling video game ever. The franchise recorded more than $1 billion in revenue in
2007 and was a consumer juggernaut. 22 Enter Mr. Rosensweig, who stated when he joined
Guitar Hero, “With a platfo rm and content that universally engages a wide range of
audiences, Guitar Hero has incredible growth potential. I look forward to continuing to
develop Guitar Hero into an even more successful enterprise.” 23 His new employer, Guitar
Hero’s parent Activision  Blizzard, was equally enthusiastic about Mr. Rosensweig,


 proclaiming, “We are looking forward to leveraging [Rosensweig’s] proven online experience
to build upon the billions of hours of entertainment we deliver each year in the ‘Guitar Hero’
network.” 24
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________14


After joining Guitar Hero, Mr. Rosensweig embarked on a process to expand distribution
through new business partners and spin-offs, such as DJ Hero and Band Hero. 25 It would be
an understatement to say Rosensweig’s strategy was not successful. In less than  a year, the
Guitar Hero juggernaut was experiencing rapid sales declines and Mr. Rosensweig quickly
departed. 26  In 2011, Activision Blizzard was forced to shutter the entire Guitar Hero
division. 27 


2) CHGG’s textbook rental business is commoditized & faces in creased
competition


“As we move ahead, our textbook business by design will become a smaller part of our
overall company, and we are still able to glean great value from it. Our strategy is to use our


 Required Materials business to build our brand, grow our reach, and acquire customers
 profitably, enabling us to more efficiently introduce our higher growth and higher margin
 services that students love. And as you can see from our results, it's working.”
 –  Dan Rosensweig, 2/22/16  


Most education technology companies struggle because the unit economics for student-
dependent businesses are often unprofitable. Specifically, the cost to acquire a student-
customer is generally higher than the lifetime value of that customer. CHGG historically has


 been no exception with its consistent GAAP, non-GAAP, and free cash flow losses. However,
the “new” promote argues that CHGG can use its commoditized textbook rental business to
funnel customers into its higher margin digital services segment. The bulls argue that
CHGG’s  textbook rental business, despite atrocious standalone unit economics, can lower the
company’s digital services lead generation costs compared to the plethora of other education
technology providers. Like much of the CHGG promote, the story is not supported by the
facts. As discussed below, CHGG’s textbook rental business is not self -sustaining and Chegg
Services is in fact neither a high growth, nor high margin business.


CHGG’s textbook rental business has been renamed “Required Materials.” As seen in th e
table below, the business has transitioned from decelerating growth to a nearly 10% structural
decline based on management’s 2016 guidance.  


When CHGG initially introduced its textbook rental offering in 2007, the concept was
revolutionary. 28  CHGG disrupted the prior model that forced college students to purchase
expensive, single use textbooks. Ten years ago, students paid approximately $1,200 per year
for textbooks and that cost has increased by nearly 50% over the last decade. 29 CHGG had an
innovative model and a first mover advantage that resulted in revenue that grew from

essentially zero in 2007 to nearly $150 million by 2010. 30 [Like most uneconomical models,
CHGG’s losses grew at a faster rate than revenue, but that is beside the point.]  


CHGG’s impressive revenue growth attracted significant competition. Numerous upstart
competitors entered the market, with sites such as AbeBooks, Half.com, ValoreBooks,
eCampus, BookRenter, Textbooks.com, and Boundless all entering CHGG’s market; it is
abundantly clear there are no barriers to entry for textbook rentals. CHGG’s first mover
advantage was unsustainable given the lack of product differentiation (an intermediate
accounting textbook from CHGG is substantially similar to the same intermediate accounting


 book from BookRenter or Half.com). In addition to intense direct competition, comparison
shopping sites such as dealoz.com, textbookrentals.com, TextSurf, and StudentRate began to
appear, which allowed students to compare rental sites for the best price.


 Next, while limited brand differentiation and zero sustainable barriers to entry destroyed
most, if not all, economic profit potential among mono-line textbook rental companies,
Amazon’s entry into the market in further assured CHGG’s demise. Aft er launching a digital
textbook rental service in 2011, Amazon quickly followed with a full-scale physical textbook
rental program in 2012. Unsurprisingly, Amazon’s size, scale, and technological advantages
destroyed the incumbents. According to Uwire, a popular college student website, Amazon is
already considered one of the best places to buy or rent textbooks:


“Through Amazon, students are able to order books based on condition, price and shipping.
Students can also order Kindle versions of textbooks, which can be used through the free


 Kindle app. Book rentals are also provided and are priced based on how long one plans to
use the textbooks. Amazon provides students with one of the most cost effective routes for


 purchasing or renting textbooks.”


Today, CHGG is rarely the low cost option for students. For example, the textbook
Intermediate Accounting rents for $320.95, which is 123% more expensive than the lowest
cost option from knetbooks. Additionally, CHGG’s most popular textbook, Campbell
Biology, al so illustrates the price “uncompetitive” nature of CHGG’s textbook rental


 business.

CHGG’s inability to compete in the rental textbook market, as evidenced by management’s
implied ~10% revenue decline and basic comparison shopping, represents a clear indication
this segment is not a sustainable source of low cost customer acquisition for the company’s
digital services. Additionally, we believe competition is poised to become even more intense.


Barnes & Noble Education (BNED), which operates over 750 college bookstores and related
e-commerce sites, piloted a price-match program at 70-80 schools in 2015. Based on its
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________17


success, BNED recently announced the price-match program will be expanding in 2016 to the
majority of its campus bookstores. 31 The program offers student a refund during the first week
of class if they find a lower price on used, new, or rental textbooks. 32 CHGG will face the full


 brunt of the implementation of this program in Q4’16, which could explain management’s
implied g uidance for Required Materials to decline by nearly 40% in Q4’16.


Amazon is also increasingly focused on attracting college student customers by rolling out
 branded mailrooms on university campuses. The program, called “Campus Pick -up Point,”
was initially piloted in 2015 at Purdue University as a service for students who live in dorms
or apartments, where receiving packages can be challenging. 33 In 2016, Amazon is expanding
the program to the University of California at Davis, the University of California at Berkeley,
the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the Georgia
Institute of Technology, and the University of Pennsylvania. 34 Amazon also has plans for
several more “pickup points” on or near other university campus es.35 As part of the program,
universities receive 2% of every Amazon purchase delivered, further aligning interests around
the program. 36 


And just last month, Pearson, one of the largest textbook publishers in the country, announced
a partnership with Follett Higher Education, the largest campus retailer nationwide. The


 partnership will provide Follett’s 1,200 campus bookstores nationwide access to Pearson’s
Digital Direct Access model, which is a suite of e-textbooks and other digital content. 37 Tom
Malek, Senior Vice President of Partnerships at Pearson, stated, “By partnering with Follett,
we’re making these pricing and delivery models available to all of Follett’s partners,
increasing student affordability and access, and improving faculty access to real-time data and
analytics.” 38 


Given substantial and increasing competition in the textbook rental market, we believe
CHGG’s purported low cost customer acquisition channel doesn’t have a chance to compete
successfully.


3) Chegg Services stability, margins, and growth characteristics are
misrepresented


 I. Chegg Services faces persistently high customer churn


The vast majority of CHGG’s businesses target college students (Chegg Study, Chegg Tutors,
and Internships.com are all higher education focused). Assuming the average college student
is enrolled for four years, CHGG numerically has at least 25% of its customers churning
annually (assume cohort linearity). We believe actual annual churn is closer to 100%.  


Management often highlights Chegg Study’s high renew al rate. In its most recent quarter,
CHGG reported an 80% renewal rate for this segment. 39 While this renewal rate may appear
respectable, the fine print discloses CHGG’s renewal rate is actually the monthly  renewal rate
for the quarter. As such, CHGG’s ren ewal rate is closer to 7% on an annualized basis.
Obviously, this means CHGG must replace 93% of its customers every year.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________18


We readily admit that while the table below is correct for a steady cohort, the analysis is
imperfect. Students may cancel their CHGG memberships at different points (e.g., over the
summer or winter holidays) and re-enroll later. However, no matter how the data is sliced, the
80% monthly renewal rate, or 20% monthly churn, creates retention challenges that are
typically only found in the online dating industry.  


 II. Chegg Tutors pricing implies management misrepresented gross margins


CHGG management has consistently stated that the company’s digital services segment is a
higher growth, higher margin business compared to textbook rentals. According to
management, CHGG will have gross margins of at least 60% when the company reaches its
target operating model (we discuss later how management quietly pushed out its target model


 by a year). Management has also stated Chegg Tutors is its fastest growing segment and will
 be the fastest segment to reach $100 million in revenue despite de minimis revenue today. 40 
The inference is that the drive towards 60% gross margins will be driven by the fastest
growing segment, Chegg Tutors, which mathematically would require gross margins well in
excess of the overall target model of 60%. However, the implied math driving management’s
future promises appears faulty.


CHGG pays its tutors $20 per hour. 41 As can be seen below, the standard pricing for Chegg
Tutors is $30 per hour. 42 (30 minutes at $15 per week plus 50 cents for each additional minute
equates to $30/hour) Making the laughable assumption that revenue from Chegg Tutors
carries no incremental costs like hosting, technology, or customer care, advertised gross
margin would be only 33%. It is unclear how these publicly advertised figures reconcile with
management’s story of 60%+ gross margins.

 III. Management has historically squandered shareholder capital through poor acquisitions


In a repeat of Mr. Rosensweig’s playbook from ZDNet, CHGG has chased revenue growth
through murky acquisitions. In the last six years, CHGG has completed at least 10
acquisitions. We believe every current digital services offering came by way of acquisition, as
CHGG has not developed a single product internally. This begs the question, on what exactly
did CHGG spend $60 million in 2015 for technology and development?


Contrary to management’s claim that its acquisition strategy has been a success, we believe
Cramster, which was renamed Chegg Study, is the only  acquisition that has performed to plan.
Four of the ten products/companies acquired by CHGG have subsequently been shut down or
discontinued, while three others are behind plan. While it is too early to determine whether
Imagine Easy will be a success, the $139 million of wasteful acquisition expenditures to date


 bode poorly for the return on the incremental $35 million of earn-out payments.

 IV. Chegg Services subscriber growth is significantly overstated


While CHGG management has recently touted its strong subscriber growth as a key metric for
 business momentum, this metric is never actually defined nor is it included in a single formal
SEC filing. If this metric is indeed important for investors and analysts to evaluate
management’s progress, why would management exclude it from its formal filings with the
SEC?


We believe the answer is because management consistently alters the metric to fit its shifting
narrative. F or example, in Q3’15 management reported 825,000 digital subscribers,
representing 23% year-over-year growth. However, management reported 800,000
subscribers in Q3’16, which they claimed represented over 40% year -over-year growth.
Shrinking subscribers from 825,000 to 800,000 would seem to represent 3% contraction, NOT
40% growth.  


Source: Q3’15 CHGG earnings press release.  


Source: Q3’16 CHGG earnings press release.  


As part of CHGG’s shifting segment disclosures (which we discuss in detail below), we
 believe management also altered its definition of a subscriber. Based on our understanding of
CHGG’s revised reporting, the company’s subscriber count conveniently no lon ger includes
eTextbook customers (which is now in decline). Fortunately, because management provided
historical CHGG Services subscribers for the first time in its Q3’16 data sheet, we can
calculate implied historical eTextbook customers. Next, if we assume these customers
grow/decline at the same rate as overall Required Materials (the segment to which eTextbooks
was shifted in order to inflate perceived digital growth), we can calculate a normalized digital
subscriber metric. Finally, because CHGG acquire d Imagine Easy in Q2’16, we must
therefore remove an estimate for these customers. As can be seen in the analysis below, we


 believe organic digital subscriber growth has been quickly decelerating  throughout 2016.

4) CHGG has consistently misrepresented its financial & segment
reporting


1. Management has repeatedly reorganized reporting segments to artificially inflate digital
 growth


In the ~3 years since CHGG has gone public, management has reported company revenue
under three different derivations. We believe the primary goal of constantly reshuffling
revenue segments is to obfuscate the company’s poor results.


At the time of its IPO, CHGG had two straightforward revenue categories  –  “Print
Textbooks” and “Non - print Products and Services.” Print Textb ooks represented the slower
growth textbook rental business while Non-print Products and Services represented the
company’s faster growing eTextbook, subscription, and advertising segments.  


In 2015, management reorganized its reporting segments to incl ude “Print Textbooks” and
“Digital Offerings.” While the change appeared innocuous, we believe the modification
contained details that had the undeniable impact of overstating digital segment growth. As
discussed in more detail below (and has garnered specific SEC attention), management

attributed Ingram commissions from print textbooks rentals to the company’s “digital”
revenue group. While there was no net impact to consolidated revenue, the categorization of


 print textbook rental commissions as digital revenue undeniably overstated digital growth,
which has become the most important metric for the investment community.


We believe the reporting reorganization in 2016 was an even more duplicitous attempt to hide
weak performance and further manipulate digital revenue growth. Management once again
changed CHGG’s revenue segments, this time to “Required Materials” and “Chegg Services.”
Under the newest iteration, management shifted both its Ingram textbook rental commissions
and its eTextbooks revenues to “Required Materials” (formerly “Print Textbooks”).
Previously, both eTextbooks and the Ingram commissions had been classified under digital
services revenue. The attribution reconfiguration of these two sub-segments had the effect of
overstating year-over-year comparisons for digital revenues not once, but twice (as seen in the
illustration below).


In 2015, nearly all of the commission revenue from Ingram was new compared to the
 previous year (the program was piloted in late 2014 and fully rolled out in 2015). Therefore,
including Ingram commissions (front print textbook rentals) as digital revenue vastly
improved the growth profile for this segment in 2015. However, these commissions would
need to be lapped in 2016, which would have created a challenging comparison for digital
growth. Supporting our belief that management manipulated its segment reporting, the
company moved the Ingram commissions out of digital (the segment management believed to


 be appropriate in 2015) and into “Required Materials” in 20 16. The net effect was that the
new Chegg Services segment faced a remarkably easier comparison in 2016.


In addition to shifting CHGG’s Ingram commission revenue, management also inexplicably
removed its eTextbook business from the company’s digital reven ue category. Given
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________23


eTextbooks is a 100% digital business, why would management feel compelled to make this
arbitrary change? We believe the shift was a blatant attempt to hide slowing digital growth.


CHGG’s eTextbook segment had historically been a fast growth business based on market
share gains versus print textbooks. However, in late 2015 publishers raised the relative prices
for eTextbooks (compared to print textbooks), which significantly curtailed eTextbook
growth. According to management, eTextbook unit growth was greater than 60% in 2014. 43 
However, because of the publisher pricing changes, management expected eTextbook revenue
to decline in 2016. 44 As such, similar to management’s conundrum regarding the company’s
Ingram commissions, eTextbooks would become an unwelcome drag on digital revenue
growth in 2016. We believe the reason for the unorthodox maneuvers by management is
crystal clear: move eTextbooks and Ingram commissions to Print Textbooks (now Required
Materials) to hide the rapid deceleration of Digital revenue (now Chegg Services).


 II. Normalized digital revenue growth is significantly below management’s target  


“Our digital businesses are expected to grow better than 60% in Q4 and we anticipate
 similar growth in 2015 .” 
 –  Andy Brown, CHG G CFO, Q3’14 earnings call, 11/3/14  


As discussed above, we believe CHGG management reorganized its reporting segments to
hide slowing growth in its all-important digital segment. We also believe actual digital growth
is a fraction of what CHGG has represented publicly. At the end of 2014, management
unequivocally stated that it expected digital revenue to grow at least 60% in 2015, which was


 prior to Ingram commission revenue shifting from print to digital. In fact, when asked in the
conference call’s Q&A about this exact topic, (whether 60% forecast included or excluded
Ingram), CFO Brown unmistakably stated:


Question  –  Douglas T. Anmuth : And can I just follow up on 2015, the 60% digital
 growth number that you mentioned. Does that include and make some assumption for
how much of  –  for a part of the business that is, of course, moving over to Ingram and
has revenues getting booked in digital?


 Answer  –  Andrew J. Brown : No Doug, it doesn't…anything that Ingram adds would
 just be bigger [and] that would add to that total. 45 


Despite (a) the benefit of multiple acquisitions throughout 2014 that would have aided the
2015 year-over-year growth rate, and (b) shifting Ingram print textbook commissions to the
digital segment, CHGG’s digital revenue slowed substantial ly in 2015 and was well below
management’s stated target that excluded the large benefit that was ultimately received from
the Ingram segment reorganization.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________24


Entering 2016, CHGG was already behind its targeted growth plan and  now faced the
difficulties of lapping its Ingram commission benefit. Management had committed to
substantial growth that would not be achievable. Rather than candidly address the
disappointing digital growth, as discussed above management again altered CHGG’s revenue
reporting segments. We have not seen one sell- side report that identified management’s
changes or attempts to independently analyze the actual growth rate of CHGG’s digital


 business. However, an estimate for the digital growth rate can be calculated.


Chegg Services revenue is simply the former digital revenue segment excluding the
company’s Ingram commission and eTextbooks. We can therefore calculate historical implied
revenue for these sub-segments by deducting restated Chegg Services revenue from originally
reported Digital revenue. Next, if we assume revenue from Ingram and eTextbooks declines
in 2016 at the same rate as the overall guidance for Required Materials, we can determine
2016 estimated revenue for Ingram and eTextbooks. With this straightforward calculation, we
can create a clean compare for digital revenue growth by adding Ingram commissions and
eTextbooks to management’s guidance for Chegg Services. The math is scary and illustrates
why we believe management has gone to such great lengths to avoid straightforward
reporting. Using the company’s own segments, financials, and guidance, normalized digital
revenue growth will be just 16% in 2016. As discussed above, we believe the substantial
deceleration in digital revenue growth is the primary driver for man agement’s unjustifiable
changes to its revenue reporting segments and altered long-term targets. Above all else, with a
16% normalized digital revenue growth rate, we believe the company will not achieve
management’s 2017 guidance (which itself is already  below prior consensus estimates).

 III. Multiple revenue reclassifications have discrepancies with reported pro forma financials


Possibly because CHGG management has reclassified revenue so many times, or because of
creative retroactive changes to PowerPoint slides that artificially inflate current-year revenue
growth, historical pro-forma revenue disclosures fail to reconcile. For example, in an IR


 presentation from August 2015, CHGG reported 2014 pro forma revenue of $142.7 million,
implying 2014 growth of 40% compared to $101.9 million in 2013. Just six months later, in
CHGG’s 2016 IR presentation, the historical 2014 revenue was revised down by 6% to $134
million ($66M + $68M).


Perhaps the revenue changes were a mistake, but the lower 2014 revenue baseline obviously
flatters the 2015 growth rate. We have been unable to find any disclosure or explanation for
the change and it remains unclear why historical revenue would change well over a year after
it was initially reported. Based on what we believe to be a consistent pattern of
misrepresentation and misleading reporting, we would point out that the 2014 revenue
alteration resulted in 24% reported growth for 2015, as opposed to only 16% growth had the
originally reported revenue figures been maintained.

 IV. The SEC requested information re  garding CHGG’s revenue reclassifications  


Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000000000015056977/filename1.pdf


If not clear by now, we believe CHGG’s multiple revenue reclassifications and dubious
 presentation of textbook rental comm issions as “digital” are highly misleading. On December
8, 2015, the SEC sent a letter to Mr. Rosensweig, which appeared to focus on CHGG’s digital
revenue classification. 46 Specifically, the SEC inquired, “Please tell us how you determined
commission fees related to the Ingram Content Group (“Ingram”) partnership, where Ingram
fulfills print text book transactions, are most appropriately presented as revenue from Digital
offerings.” 47 


Less than two weeks later, CHGG responded with a vigorous defense, despite openly
conceding that the Ingram commissions are tied to  physical  product sales:


 Response: Chegg respectfully advises the Staff that, although the product delivered by
the Ingram Content Group (“Ingram”) is physical in nature, Chegg provides a digital


 service through its website by serving as the interface between the student and Ingram.
The marketplace service that Chegg provides is similar regardless of whether the
textbook is print or digital. When a student places an order on the Chegg.com website


 for a textbook that is owned by Ingram, Chegg facilitates the transaction between the
 student and Ingram but Ingram fulfills the rental textbook order. Chegg never takes
 possession of the textbook; rather we offer a textbook owned by Ingram for rental by a
 student.   All of the activities required for Chegg to earn its commission from Ingram
are executed through the Chegg website and are digital, and thus we have determined
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________27


to be similar in nature. Based on these considerations, Chegg records the commission
 fees earned from Ingram on the transaction as component of digital revenue on its
Consolidated Statement of Operations. We continue to record revenue earned in
connection with orders of print textbooks owned by Chegg as a component of print
revenue. This differentiation of print versus digital revenue is useful to our investors
as it provides a view into our transition from owning a capital intensive print textbook
business to a fully digital business. This allows investors to properly model Chegg’s


 go-forward business. 48 


Despite vehemently defending its revenue characterization to the SEC on December 21, 2015,
management took the unusual step of completely reversing course and removing Ingram
commissions from its digital segment when it provided guidance for 2016. Concomitant with
this illogical step (based on the justification provided months earlier to the SEC), management
reclassified its Ingram commission revenue and renamed its segments “Chegg Services” and
“Required Materials.” On CHGG’s Q4’15 earnings call, the company’s CFO Andy Brown
stated, “We will also be reporting and guiding separately on total Required Materials which
includes revenue from textbooks, eTextbooks as well as the Ingram commission. We are
doing this to increase transparency into our slow growth business, but more importantly it
matches the way students come to Chegg to search for textbooks and our goal is providing
students the textbooks they need in the format they want.” 49 


While the explanation and new segment names implied broad changes, the only effective
modifications were to remove eTextbook and Ingram commissions from digital (both of
which are now in decline). Interestingly, when a sell-side analyst asked a question regarding
the reclassification, management admitted the change was driven entirely by the motivation to
remove Ingram commissions and eTextbooks from the digital segment:


“So what's in the Required Materials is this. It is all of the Ingram commission, all of
the print books that we deliver, and all of the eTextbooks. And so essentially what is
done  –  and let me put it in a different format. If you take what our Digital revenue was
last year, take out the Ingram commission and take out eTextbooks and put it with our


 print, that gives you Required Materials. That's ho w it works.”   –  Andy Brown, CHGG
CFO, 2/22/16


Management’s staunch defense to the SEC, which was immediately followed by another re -
segmentation, adds further support to our belief Messrs. Rosensweig and Brown orchestrated
their segment reporting in a misleading and inappropriate manner to overstate digital revenue.


V. Did CHGG’s inventory transfer sales to Ingram artificially inflate revenue?  


In August 2014, CHGG announced a strategic alliance with Ingram Content Group. Under the
agreement, CHGG would continue to market textbooks and provide customer service, while
Ingram would be responsible for textbook inventory, fulfillment, shipping, and returns. As


 part of the deal, CHGG would transfer its textbook inventory to Ingram at cost. 50 While the
transaction would clearly impact CHGG’s balance sheet (debit to cash or accounts receivable
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________28


and credit to inventory), the inventory transfer created no economic benefit and thus should
have had a non- recurring impact on CHGG’s income statement. However, we believe these
transitory inventory transfers, which should have been recorded as one-time gains/losses,
were instead included as profitless revenue as yet one more mechanism to inflate perceived
growth. On CHGG’s GAAP income statement (which unsurprisingly is not discussed by
management), the company reports three revenue line items:


1. Rental  –  rental of print textbooks
2. Services  –  Chegg Study, brand advertising, eTextbooks, tutoring, enrollment


marketing, and commerce
3. Sales  –  just-in-time sale of print textbooks and the sale of other required materials


Based on the company’s business drivers, rental revenue (1) and sales revenue (3) should be
highly correlated as both segments are tied to student demand for physical textbooks. Each
year, some students rent textbooks, while others purchase course materials. However, growth
in these two segments diverged significantly in 2014 and 2015, which coincided with
CHGG’s Ingram alliance. In 2014, rental revenue declined by 4%, yet sales revenue increased  


 by 145%. Management did not bother to discuss this unique development and revenue driver.


What is more confounding than the revenue growth variance is the profit (or lack thereof)
generated on the “Sales” increase. In 2015, gross margin on sales revenue was only 2% and
year-to-date 2016 gross margin is negative  5%, which implies CHGG generates essentially
zero incremental profit on these transactions and thus further demonstrates the impressive
revenue growth may have been a function of profitless textbook inventory sales to Ingram.


VI. CHGG appears to be in direct violation with SEC Regulation G


The SEC implemented Regulation G in 2003 to prohibit material misstatements or omissions
that would make the presentation of a non-GAAP financial measure misleading to investors. 51 
Earlier this year, the SEC issued new Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DIs)
regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures to further curb perceived abuse. 52 
Specifically, the updated C&DIs state, “a non -GAAP measure that is adjusted only for non-
recurring charges when there were non-recurring gains that occurred during the same period
could violate Rule 100(b) of Regulation G.” 53  The SEC is effectively telling management
teams they may not exclude one-time charges while also including  one-time gains when
reporting non-GAAP measures.

Despite the SEC’s clear guidelines, CHGG management appears to continue its disregard for
regulatory reporting requirements. Specifically, for 10 straight quarters CHGG’s management
has excluded acquisition-related compensation (which is clearly recurring at this point),
restructuring charges, and other “one -time” expenses from its adjusted EBITDA calcula tion.
Striking at the heart of the SEC’s newest C&DIs, CHGG has simultaneously included  one-
time gains repeatedly on the liquidation of textbooks. What is also noteworthy is that CHGG’s
supposed one-time adjustments have grown from $1.2 million in 2013 to $12.2 million in
2015.


In addition to CHGG’s abuse of non -GAAP profit adjustments, we believe management has
also violated Regulation G regarding its opaque non-GAAP pro forma revenue metric.
According to the SEC, “Regulation G requires the registrant  to provide… a reconciliation (by
schedule or other clearly understandable method), which shall be quantitative for historic
measures and quantitative, to the extent available without unreasonable efforts, for


 prospective measures, of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented
and the most directly comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in
accordance with GAAP.” 54 


In the midst of its promotional business model pivot, CHGG continues to rent its own
textbook inventory (for which the company receives 100% of revenue), while also receiving
commissions for orders that are fulfilled by Ingram. Management has publicly stated CHGG
receives an approximate 20% commission for each Ingram transaction. 55 Thus, while CHGG
is undergoing its transition, management is reporting pro forma revenue metrics “as if”
Ingram already owned all textbooks. Considering management has disclosed the Ingram
commission, an “as if revenue” reconciliation table reconciling GAAP to non -GAAP revenue
that is “clearly understandable” and “quantitative” should not be difficult. Nonetheless,
CHGG’s quarterly earnings press releases provide one line item titled “Adjustments.” What
exactly these adjustments entail, and how they are calculated, is unclear. In fact, as shown
extensively above, CHGG’s adjusted results change without explanation. In early 2015,

management introduced certain pro forma metrics to “assist” investors in understanding the

in certain quarters, while excluded altogether in others. 56 


5) Management’s egregious compensation & other conflicts of interest  


 I.  Abusive stock compensation transfers value from investors to management  


CHGG’s stock -based compensation represents an astounding 28% of revenue. Across a broad
spectrum of education businesses, marketplaces, and consumer internet companies, average
stock-based compensation expense as a percent of revenue is less than 4%. While we would
gladly debate whether stock based compensation should be considered an expense (yes, it
should), that is not the point. CHGG’s rate of spend on stock compensation is not even
comparable to the company’s education -focused peers, which typically spend less than 1% of
revenue on stock comp. CHGG’s stock based compensation expense is also many multiples
higher than that of its technology peers, which are generally known for aggressive stock
compensation in the first place. The only company we could find with remotely similar stock
compensation to CHGG as a percent of revenue is Twitter (TWTR).


Incredibly, despite outlandish levels of non-cash stock compensation expense, CHGG
continues to burn cash (more on cash flow below). [in the table below we generously included
LinkedIn in an effort to expand the peer group, although few would find the actual
comparison fair]

Because of CHGG’s excessive stock compensation, the gap between basic and diluted shares
outstanding has a material impact when analyzing the company’s ma rket capitalization and
enterprise value. CHGG has nearly 16 million shares that would be included in its diluted
share count in the unlikely event the company ever achieves profitability, or the even less
likely event the company were to be acquired. Stock compensation (options, RSUs and PSUs)
does not impact CHGG’s adjusted income statement and these potentially dilutive shares are
excluded from analyst models and adjusted financial results.

 II. Management’s excessive pay is  not tied to performance


“All or a portion of 50% of the shares subject to these PSU awards may have been earned
upon our achievement of digital revenue, digital revenue net the commission earned from


 Ingram and free cash flow performance targets by December 31, 2015 that were approved by
the compensation committee and subject to the compensation committee’s determination that


 such targets were achieved, in full or in part, following the completion of the 2015 fiscal year.
The targets for each of these performance measures for 2015 was $143.6 million for digital
revenue, $135.9 million for digital revenue net the commission earned from Ingram and $26
million for free cash flow .”  –  CHGG 2016 Proxy Statement


CHGG’s Board of Directors is comprised of multiple  venture investors and “friends” of the
CEO. Considering the potential conflicts this coziness could present, we were surprised to see
CHGG neglect to provide a “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section in its proxy
statement. The lack of disclosure and accountability extends well beyond compensation.
CHGG does not provide a list of peers, it does not provide a conceptual discussion about
compensation for its executive team, and it does not disclose how the company performed
relative to its performance-based metrics.


We are not owners of CHGG, so we are agnostic about the company’s poor governance
 policies. However, we would point out that in 2015, CHGG did not achieve a single
 performance-  based target that was outlined in the company’s Proxy Stateme nt. Additionally,
total shareholder return, as defined by the CHGG’s stock price performance, was negative
2.6%. For this utter lack of shareholder value creation, Mr. Rosensweig’s Board awarded him
with nearly $10 million of stock grants. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) also took
issue with the excessive compensation, stating, “The equity grant to CEO Rosensweig more
than doubled, resulting in pay and performance misalignment. No disclosure was provided
regarding a rationale for the increase in eq uity awarded.” 57

While half of Mr. Rosensweig’s stock awards were performance -based, and therefore
technically should have been subject to meeting pre-defined performance targets, it appears
the compensation committee ignored these benchmarks. While CHGG did not achieve a
single performance-  based metric in 2015, the compensation committee “determined that 33%
of [Mr. Rosensweig’s] PSUs were earned.” 58 No explanation was provided about why these


 performance grants were issued.

*while management did not disclose Ingram commission, we note that rental revenue declined by ~61 million,

Since CHGG went public three years ago, its stock price has declined by 45%,
underperforming the Russell 2000 by 60%. Further, management has repeatedly missed its


 performance targets. Yet over the same period that shareholders have suffered immense
losses, Mr. Rosensweig has received nearly $24 million in total compensation.

6) Weak operating performance, cash burn, & acquisition earn-outs impair
the balance sheet


 I. Management has misrepresented recent business momentum


Like most stock promotes, management’s public assessment of its financial performance is
often in stark contrast to an objective analysis of the financial accounts. In Q2’16, CHGG
management highlighted that EBITDA more than doubled compared to the prior year, with
the CFO proudly stating on the earnings call, “as a result of the strong revenue and gross
margin performance, our adjusted EBITDA came in at $7.2 million, more than double the


 prior year and another proof point that our new business model is working.” 59 What the CFO
failed to share was that excluding lumpy, non-recurring textbook sales, EBITDA would have
actually declined year-over-year. The benefit of selling textbook inventory for gains will
cease in 2017 as the Ingram inventory transfer is completed.


 II. Significant increases in capitalized expenses may be overstating EBITDA


CHGG’s transition from a textbook rental company to a fully digital business should reduce
capital intensity. Historically, outside of textbook purchases, CHGG has been a relatively
capital light model, spending 2% to 3% of revenue on capital expenditures. CHGG’s
education, marketplace, and consumer internet peers generally spend less than 5% of revenue
on capex as well.


However, through the first nine months of 2016 CHGG’s capex has more than tripled,
increasing to over 9% of revenue. In fact, through the first three quarters alone, CHGG’s
capitalized expenses are more than twice what the company spent through all of 2015. In


 particular, in Q2’16 CHGG’s capex was nearly 18% of revenue. Despite the massive increase,

COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________34


neither Mr. Rosensweig nor Mr. Brown addressed the issue in their prepared remarks on the
Q2’16  earnings call. When asked during the Q&A about the abnormal increase, Mr. Brown
stated, “I think when you think about CapEx for Chegg, it’s a little bit of a misnomer. Most


 people think it’s buildings and things like that, but we also capitalize a lot of our content cost
and things like that.” 60 


Mr. Brown’s explanation for 18% of revenue going towards capex is that CHGG has
historically  capitalized its content costs. But this explanation fails to reconcile. If capitalizing
content costs was a historical  practice and does not represent a change in strategy, then
capitalized content costs don’t explain the disproportionate increase in capitalized expenses
relative to revenue.


We believe the actual explanation is that CHGG management has shifted operating expenses
from its income statement to capitalized expenses on its balance sheet. While this strategy
inflates adjusted EBITDA by excluding the resulting depreciation, it does not alter the overall
cash flow of the business, which, as discussed below, continues to deteriorate.


 III. Management quietly pushed out its target operating model by one year


As CHGG has been pivoting from a textbook rental business to a 100% digital business,
management has repeatedly shared its “target operating model.”  With the Ingram transition
expected to be completed by the end of 2016, management made the logical argument that its
target model would be achieved in 2017. Throughout 2015, CHGG included its target model
and timeline in every publicly filed investor presentation. As recently as November 2015, and
seen in the screenshots below, CHGG publicly endorsed achieving its target financial model
in 2017. On CHGG’s Q3’15 earnings call, Mr. Brown again promised, “During 2017 we
expect to reach our target model of 25% revenue growth, greater than 60% gross margins, and
25% EBITDA margins, along with strong free cash flow.” 61 That sounded pretty good.


However, when CHGG reported its Q4’15 earnings results just three months later, the widely
 promoted target model was shifted by an entire year into 2018. In addition to shifting the
target model date from 2017 to 2018, management also quietly changed its revenue target
from 25% total “Revenue Growth” to 30% “Chegg Services Revenue Growth.” As is often
the case with this management team, there was no explanation provided for the meaningful
target model change or year-long push-out. As we discovered last week when management

 provided initial 2017 guidance for revenue growth of only 19%, we believe the revenue
growth target change is due to the fact CHGG is materially behind its operating plan.


Source: CHGG IR presentation, 11/2/15 Source: CHGG IR presentation, 22/22/16


 IV. CHGG’s business model(s) perpetually destroy capital and burn cash  


“We think it's important for people to know that we generate a lot of cash and we are able to
 generate free cash flow. And that's something that is new to Chegg…  One of the wonderful
things that we can say for the first time since we've been public is we generate a lot of cash


 from operations.”   –  Dan Rosensweig, CHGG Q2’16 earnings call, 8/1/16  


With all due respect to Mr. Rosensweig, we believe this quote demonstrates either a lack of
understanding about the definition of cash flow or intent to deceive investors. While CHGG
has generated cash year-to-date, the primary sources are unsustainable or the result of timing.
Specifically, cash flow from operations has been distorted by the proceeds from the
liquidation of textbooks (which will cease next year) and the timing of fall semester rush


 payments that will be remitted to Ingram in Q4’16. More importantly, based on
management’s guidance that CHGG will end the year with $50 to $60 million in cash,
CHGG’s operating free cash burn will be north of $25 million in 2016, which represents a 3x
increase  over 2015.


Prior to 2015, when CHGG commenced its business transition away from print textbooks, the
company actually generated significant cash flow from operations. While the operating cash
flow never translated into free cash flow because of significant cash outflows for textbook


 purchases, cash flow from operations was indeed positive. However, cash flow from
operations turned negative in conjunction with the digital transition in 2015, and in a direct
contradiction to Mr. Rose nsweig’s statement, the negative cash flow is expected to intensify
in 2016.


While there could be possible explanations for Mr. Rosensweig’s inaccurate and misleading
 public cash flow statements, it is our opinion that (a) Mr. Rosensweig misrepresented the
actual economics of the business, or (b) he does not understand the definition of free cash
flow. Unfortunately for shareholders, neither is a good explanation.
COPPERFIELD RESEARCH  


 ________________________________________________________________________36


Mr. Rosensweig’s mis -statements appear consistent with a troubling trend of management
 playing fast-and-loose with its free cash flow guidance. For example, in early 2015
management stated, “We expect free cash flow in the range of $15 million to $25 million.
Although this is a large increase over 2014, we expect to see an accelerated benefit to cash
flow through 2016 and beyond as a result of the payment terms to Ingram and the freeing of
our capital from being tied up in new inventory.” 62  Despite clearly tracking behind plan,
management reiterated this cash flow guidance on its Q1’15 earnings call. On its Q2’15
earnings call, management lowered its free cash flow guidance to $15 to $20 million. As the
year progressed, and the company continued to track behind plan, management stopped
discussing free cash flow entirely. Ultimately, CHGG generated a free cash flow loss of $8
million in 2015. Even giving the company credit for lumpy net gains from the liquidation of
textbooks, free cash flow was still negative  $2 million  –  well below management’s guidance.  


V. Imagine Easy earn-out payments may impair CHGG’s balance sheet  


CHGG was cash rich after raising $180 million in its IPO. Due to operating losses, textbook
library investments, numerous failed acquisitions, and untimely share repurchases, CHGG
will have burned through all but ~$55 million of cash by the end of 2016. And as shown
above, CHGG’s digital business utilizes significant cash when capitalized investments are
included.


While $55 million of cash may seem manageable, the company’s cash position appears
 precarious. As seen in the table below, CHGG has $35 million of earn-out payments due to
Imagine Easy, of which $27 million represent payments expected to be made in 2017.
Combined with the expected cash burn rate exceeding $25 million, we believe CHGG will
need to access the capital markets within twelve months. [NOTE: CHGG maintains a $30
million revolving credit facility, but based on restrictive EBITDA covenants, we believe the
revolver may not be accessible.]

7) Rubber meets the road in 2017 & VC’s and insiders are voting with their  
feet


 I. CHGG will struggle to meet 2017 consensus expectations


“GAAP and pro forma become the same when we get to 2017, so there won’t be any
difference. It will be just GAAP only.”   –  Andrew Brown, CHGG CFO, Q4’15 earnings call,
2/22/16


CHGG management has been 100% clear that the 2017 income statement will no longer
include arbitrary and misleading pro forma adjustments. As such, CHGG’s pro forma 2016
guidance should provide a clean baseline off of which investors can bridge 2017 guidance.
Based on extensive analysis, we believe growth expectations are materially too high and
CHGG will disappoint investors throughout 2017.  Management already lowered 2017
expectations when they provided initial revenue guidance approximately $5 million below


 prevailing consensus estimates on the Q3’16 earnings call. We believe this is the first of many
negative revisions to come.


Pro forma “Required Materials” revenue growth has decelerated since 2013 and
management’s 2016 guidance implies the segment wil l actually decline by nearly 9%.
CHGG’s lack of product differentiation and the intense competitive environment should


 prevent the segment’s performance trends from improving. Even management appears to
agree with this conclusion, as implied 2017 guidance assumes Required Materials’ decline
accelerates next year. While management’s guidance implies Required Materials will decline
11.5%, based on recent trends and increasing competition, we believe Required Materials’
decline worsens to 20% next year. Based on what we believe is a more realistic level of
decline, “Chegg Services” growth would need to re -accelerate from 28% (management
guidance for 2016) to nearly 40% to meet management’s guidance. Considering Chegg
Services growth has consistently decelerated in each of the last four years, we do not believe
such a strong re- acceleration will occur. Even taking management’s guidance at face value,
Chegg Services growth would need to re-accelerate to ~35% in order to achieve 2017
numbers. Finally, it is important to also keep in mind that as the Required Materials segment
disintegrates, CHGG will lose its purported low-cost customer acquisition funnel.


We are convinced that management will be forced to make more frequent (or larger)
acquisitions, or 2017 will  be the year CHGG’s promotional story unravels.

 II. VCs and insiders heading for the exits before the next reset


CHGG raised significant venture capital during its six years as a private company. Many of
the early-stage VCs are trapped with large investment losses. Rather than continue to patiently
support CHGG through its highly anticipated digital transition, several of CHGG’s most
knowledgeable investors have exited their positions. In fact, three of CHGG’s top six pre -IPO
shareholders sold their e ntire investment. CHGG’s largest pre -IPO shareholder, Ace ltd.,
exited its stake in 2015, which we believe is a particularly troubling development. Ace


 benefited substantially from one of the aforementioned pre-IPO ratchet provisions  –  its stake
increased  by nearly 40% from 7.6 million shares to 10.5 million shares at CHGG’s IPO –  and
the firm had been an investor in CHGG for less than five years. Venture firms are typically


 patient, long-term investors, who support management teams through value-creating
transitions. Yet, despite its short holding period and substantial increase in ownership due to
the ratchet provision, Ace exited its entire investment before reaping the “rewards” from
management’s promotional pivot.


In addition to many of CHGG’s VCs exiting their investments (many at losses), corporate
insiders are also heading for the door. Charles Geiger, CHGG’s Chief Product Officer, has

dumped nearly $1 million of stock since August, decreasing his ownership position by more

Why woul d VCs and insiders, who presumably understand CHGG’s business and digital
transition better than unaffiliated holders, sell so much stock just as the company is on the


 precipice of reaching its target model? We believe the answer is because VCs and insiders
know CHGG will not deliver on 2017 estimates, and management’s business pivot will be
exposed as a stock promotion.


8) CHGG is significantly overvalued


 I. CHGG trades at a substantial premium to education-focused peers and a broader consumer
internet basket


 No matter how the story is spun by management or its sell-side cadre, CHGG is an education
technology company. The business utilizes technology to provide textbooks and other
services to college students. There are no unique moats around CHGG’s bus iness and the
company has no proprietary processes, manufacturing know-how, or intellectual property.
CHGG is no different than its education-focused peers, most notably BNED, which operates
campus bookstores and provides study guides, new, used, and digital textbooks, and other
course materials. Companies that serve college students operate in a low growth market, with
a fickle and consistently churning end-consumer, and significant competitive pressures.
Unsurprisingly, BNED and other education companies generally trade for less than 1.0x
revenues and 5x-7x EV/EBITDA.


CHGG on the other hand is covered by internet and e-commerce analysts who have been
captivated by management’s “pivot” story. CHGG currently trades at more than 3.5x pro
forma revenue and 50x EV/EBITDA.


Even if we expand the peer group to a broader set of marketplace franchises and consumer
internet businesses, CHGG is still a significant valuation outlier. While nothing about CHGG
resembles the financial profiles, growth and cash flow characteristics, and competitive
dominance of companies like AMZN and LNKD, we generously selected a vast peer group.

For example, we utilized LinkedIn’s current valuation, which embeds Microsoft’s 50%
acquisition premium.


Incredibly, despite declining GAAP revenue, decelerating pro forma revenue growth, negative
free cash flow, and a structurally broken business model, CHGG trades at a substantial


 premium to AMZN, LNKD, and every other consumer internet or e-commerce peer we could
imagine. While it should pre sumably trade at a discount to the basket below, CHGG’s stock


 price trades at over a 100% revenue multiple premium and over a 300% EBITDA multiple
 premium.


 II. Generous valuation implies 75%+ downside


While revenue multiples may provide a stop-gap valuation methodology for a company that
loses money and burns cash, ultimately mediocre businesses are valued on prospective
earnings or EBITDA. Fortunately, CHGG management has publicly directed investors
towards its positive “adjusted” EBITDA as a framewor k for valuation. For 2016,
management’s most recent EBITDA guidance is $18 to $20 million. If we use $19 million as
a baseline and adjust for $5 million of one-time gains on textbook liquidations that will not
recur in 2017 and cash-  based recurring “acquis ition- related compensation” (the company

reported $4 million YTD for these two items), CHGG should generate approximately $14
million of recurring EBITDA this year.


While we believe CHGG should trade in-line with its education-focused peers (i.e., 5-7x
EV/EBITDA), we have assumed the promote garners a broader, more generous peer group
multiple of 11.9x. After including CHGG’s estimated year -end cash balance and deducting its
Imagine Easy earn- out obligations, CHGG’s intrinsic equity value is $186 million.  


Finally, while CHGG reported 91 million basic and diluted shares in Q3’16, this share count
excludes 11.2 million anti- dilutive shares. Using CHGG’s correct fully diluted share count of
102 million shares, CHGG’s intrinsic per share equity value is $1.82,  or 77% downside from
the current share price.
