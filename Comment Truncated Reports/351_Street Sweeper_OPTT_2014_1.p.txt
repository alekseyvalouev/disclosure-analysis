Ocean Power Technologies: Wave Goodbye To This Wave Power

Summary


OPTT regurgitates old, misleading news that pops the stock price.


The star Australian project – despite what the market is led to believe – is gravely
jeopardized by a missing agreement and the absence of multi-millions in funding.


Big company projects, including the Oregon project, are dead, and others are
hopelessly bogged down by delay after delay. OPTT's lack of transparency keeps
investors unaware of those issues.


Investors/lenders fear offering OPTT desperately needed capital because of its
delays and difficulty showing wave power technology can become a viable business.
But proving wave power requires multi-millions.


Many of the projects are so small that the electricity generated by the ocean wave
technology could power only a few light bulbs.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Ocean Power Technologies (NASDAQ:OPTT) might blow its rivals out of the water - if only
it could deliver projects like it delivers regurgitated news.


OPTT stock was swimming with the bottom feeders when the company announced a
multi-million dollar Australian deal in January with the following deceptive headline:
"Ocean Power Technologies Announces Funding Agreement With Australian Government
For A$66.5 Million Grant."


Bam! Shares jumped with the announcement by 52.9 percent in pre-market trading to
$3.38.


But here's the deal: OPTT had already announced the grant five years ago. Here is that
headline: "Ocean Power Technologies Wins Funding From The Australian Federal
Government."

The January press release actually announced Aussie funding from the original grant
would be available for phase one and two, plus OPTT would now have to meet more
milestones. So this carefully crafted news release isn't really surprising, positive news at
all. But the market -- eager for a hint of good news -- took off and ran with it.


"Fool the investors" works this week, too


Buoyed by previous announcements, OPTT tried it again Tuesday.


This time, the regurgitated gem reads: "Ocean Power Technologies Announces Victorian
Wave Partners Has Received A$5 Million Initial Grant Funding From Australian
Renewable Energy Agency."


Many people mistook the announcement to mean that OPTT was getting a fresh batch of
funding. The sound of the Australia project apparently finally running toward its power-
wave goal -- combined with the sound of investors pushing the "buy" function -- was truly
deafening.


The stock price exploded almost 9 percent to $4.06.


What was wrong with this announcement? First, the $4.6 million (US dollars) grant was
already assumed, because execs in March said Australia, with conditions attached, would
fund part of the first phase.


This is not new. And it is not new funding. In fact, the release states that grant revenue will
be accounted for later, indicating OPTT doesn't dare count it now because the company is
unlikely to come up with the required matching money.


Second, the misleading headline ignores the real news that OPTT is legally required to
disclose in its 8-K, US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That real news is that
the Oregon project is officially Dead Sea debris.


The US Department of Energy has terminated the remaining teeny, single-buoy contract
with OPTT, because the company couldn't come up with enough money.


Key wording in the new SEC filing is:


"The Company and the DOE are discussing the steps necessary to close out the
project."

OPTT's bad habit of regurgitating "news" is just another surface wave in a growing
tsunami of issues surrounding the company that has been trying since 1994 to turn
electricity-generating ocean wave power into a real business.


Indeed, the bitter words of OPTT's own house broker Collins Stewart ring as true today as
the day they were published in The Times of London's article. The broker ridiculed the
company in 2008 for "displaying a total inability to deliver."


TheStreetSweeper highlights below why that sad assessment is valid today, and we
believe will continue to be valid in the long run.


Issue Number 1: Troubled technology hasn't been proven - not for commercial use.


It's a vicious circle. The technology can't be proven because the money - another $150
million - isn't there. The money isn't there because the technology is unproven and
investors fear they'll lose money on a dying deal.


Let's look at the company's star project -- the Australian project -- from a dollars and
pennies perspective.


Back in 2009, Australia agreed to help OPTT with a demonstration project to build and set
up a wave power station off the Australian coast. The start date was August 2011. The
goal: eventually get enough of the company's buoys bobbing in the ocean to turn electric
generators to produce enough energy for 10,000 homes, at a capital expenditure rate of
more than $3 per watt, compared with wind energy's cost of only $1 per watt.


Australia's renewable energy program granted OPTT $60 million ($66.5 million Australian)
for this project.


But Australia is one stern sugar daddy that has attached two major hitches to that grant.


Matching money for the Australian project is absent


First, OPTT must pony up matching money, or lose the grant.


The total project cost in US dollars is about $210 million. Subtracting the grant, OPTT
must raise $150 million!


The Australian project is in phase one of three phases. Australia is willing to pay half of
the first phase, according to the recent earnings call. But OPTT can't even pay for its half
of the first phase.

Phase 1 has a $19 million price tag that is completely OPTT's responsibility. But the
company has only $17 million.


That money already faces an impossible stretch beyond the Australian project, because
OPTT has plans for an improved product in its back pocket. But the price tag attached to
the PB 500 is an estimated $13 million.


For OPTT - which has never been profitable, and carries a $148 million accumulated
deficit - the combined price tag might as well be a billion bucks.


Daunting second condition


The second hitch connected to Australia's grant -- and equally important to any potential
investor/lender -- is that OPTT must first get licensing and a purchase power agreement.
The power purchase agreement, or PPA, is an arrangement for OPTT to sell its wave-
generated power to a utility company.


About 5 years have passed. But still no license or power purchase agreement?


This is ominous. But during its most recent earnings call, the company tried to appease
antsy analysts concerned about its slow, awkward attempts to become a business.


An analyst asked about hindrances, noting that the new Australian administration seems
"openly hostile to renewable types of technology."


Chuck Dunleavy, the company's chief executive, denied the hostility characterization, but
admitted Australia is discussing whether to ditch its carbon tax benefit. The demise or
decline of the carbon tax benefit there may be the last gasp for a project already bobbing
in a crazy ocean of uncertainty.

The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment in time to
meet the publication deadline.


Issue Number 2: Regurgitated "news" erroneously doubles share price


OPTT's old news habit frequently jumps out in the form of the dog-eared Lockheed Martin
deal. In a pre-Valentine's Day kiss to investors, OPTT announced Feb. 11 that the
company had a - gasp! - deal with Lockheed Martin. See the press release here.


This "news" is two years old.

Check out the same Lockheed Martin deal that the company's Securities and Exchange
Commission filing mentions happened in 2012, here. Or the old 2012 press release itself,
here.


Besides, as an analyst told TheStreetSweeper: "The two press releases even use the
same wording!"


Desperate companies pull this stuff because it works. That fake rehashed Lockheed
announcement nearly doubled OPTT's share price to over $4 overnight.


Unfortunately, the so-called news was that Lockheed is doing essentially what it has done
since 2009. Lockheed is still helping with design and project management. But it remains
to be seen just how long Lockheed will remain part of the equation now that it is working
with a Chinese conglomerate - one of various international companies - offering other
wave-powered options.


The regurgitated Lockheed and Australian announcements sparked the OPTT stock rally
that investors see now. It's all about regurgitated news that's been misinterpreted.


Why is OPTT obsessed with puffing itself up this way?


It needs money. Desperately.


Issue Number 3: Dead projects taint OPTT's prospects


The ambitious Oregon project has crumpled into a virtual $5-million heap of scrap metal.


The prototype power buoy sat on dry dock -- and kept eager investors dangling -- for three
long years, while OPTT kept busy violating its federal licensing requirements, fighting bad
weather and misplacing one of three anchors dropped in the sea floor. The state of
Oregon finally demanded last fall that OPTT pull up the last remaining anchor. And the
federal government told OPTT it must get its licensing act together before proceeding.


Amid hoop-la and back-patting, the company just last year boasted (in fact, the blurb is
still on the company website) that the Oregon project received "the first license issued for
a wave power station in the US."


But neither shareholders nor the US Department of Energy ever got to see the business
end of their investment -- the power buoy -- touch the ocean water.


And they never will.

Investors were surprised to learn on March 14 that OPTT surrendered a permit application
that would have allowed OPTT to eventually place 100 power buoys off the Oregon coast.


OPTT summarily dispatched this heartbreaker during the earnings call:


In late February, we decline to renew a preliminary permit received several years
ago from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in connection with the
potential future phase of that project.


This reflects our focus on determining the prospects to obtain added funding …


So, it was simply about the company refocusing? The company describes to FERC the
"unforeseen delays in Phase 1 Project implementation and associated studies, as well as
increased project-related costs."


The news that the project couldn't get past phase 1 -- much less phase 2 and 3 -- even
surprised analysts, including one who asked what specific regulatory requirement axed
the Oregon project.


CEO Chuck Dunleavy:


… where we stand right now is being very realistic with respect to the cost
associated with moving forward with that project.


… We certainly don't want to prejudge or second-guess ourselves as to where we
will come out.


Yet, filings with the FERC and SEC clearly show the big Oregon project was dead at that
point.


And now, this week's revelation shows even the tiny, single-buoy demonstration portion of
the project is absolutely dead.


Check out the filing here on page 19 to see more on how misunderstandings and missed
reports helped sink the deal.


Spain project no better than Oregon deal


Unfortunately, the original 2006 Spain project is also dead in the water.


Company filings say the 40-kilowatt buoy was tested and quickly removed from the water
because of problems with the power take-off and control systems.

Filings track the basic problem back to OPTT's ticking heart: The power buoy simply could
not perform.


Unfortunately, a recent company filing ominously warns that plans to improve the buoy
system may be abandoned if it can't scrape up external funding.


The company failed to meet its 3-year deadline to deploy the first buoy and connect nine
other buoys off the coast of Spain, according to filings. Further damaged by partnership
issues, OPTT scaled back the project into a simple single-buoy demonstration.


Investors must consider these dead projects and decimated upgrades amid the choppy
waters already churning around the Australian project.


Absent a miracle, the Australian project is dead, too.


Issue Number 4: "Completed project" powers only 3 light bulbs


Investors also should not be deceived by projects listed on the company website as
"Completed Projects." Much as we want to believe otherwise, these are not commercially
viable.


The most interesting "completed project" in Hawaii has earned US Navy funding and the
Marine Corps' blessing. But even it is simply a test site, connected to the power grid only
"to evaluate technical and economic feasibility of commercial scale wave energy systems
from multiple suppliers." The Navy's press releases says the goal is to eventually make
the Marine Corps Base Hawaii energy self-sustaining.


Here's the kicker. The buoy generated about 3 to 4 kilowatts. That would power the grand
total of three light bulbs left on all day.


Even though OPTT later upgraded the system to 40 kilowatts capacity, that still isn't
proving its wave power can become a commercial success.


Issue Number 5: Where is everybody going?


After the March 24 bell, the company filed a notice with the SEC that the chairman of the
board, George Taylor, is stepping aside. Though he'll remain on the board and as a
consultant, his retirement as chairman and an OPTT employee is "effective immediately."


The electrical engineer, who co-founded the company in 1984, has been a big defender of
the Australian project.

"We see this as a great opportunity to prove a large demonstration program which will
really satisfy the naysayers that this (wave power) is indeed a true competitor," he said in
January 2012 of the Australian project.


The founder's unfortunate departure follows the recent resignation of another key
manager. Brian Posner left his post as chief financial officer in August 2013.


One wonders what's behind the sudden departure of both the chief financial officer and
the founder. If key OPTT folks are jumping ship, what does that say about the direction of
the Australian project and the company itself?


Conclusion


We'd like to see a company surf the ocean wave power technology into commercialization.
But, in our opinion, this company can't do it.


The projects are dead or mired in delays; the company's caught in a vicious cycle of
unproven, un-fundable technology; the star Australia project is seriously jeopardized by
insufficient money and the critical absence of a power purchase agreement; the company
shows a sleazy aptitude for using regurgitated news to pop the stock price; and the lack of
capital is unlikely to be improved, because investors are not buying the company's pipe
dream.


All in all, we believe the OPTT technology -- even the entire OPTT plan -- offers investors
nothing but an ocean full of misfortune.
