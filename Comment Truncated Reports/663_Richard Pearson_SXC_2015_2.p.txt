SunCoke Confides To IRS: We Don't Qualify For MLP Status

Summary


Yesterday SunCoke assured investors that the company is confident that it qualifies
as an MLP.


Yet on the very same day, SunCoke wrote a letter to the IRS stating clearly “we don’t
qualify”.


In fact, there are three specific criteria which exclude SunCoke from qualifying, and
SunCoke will not be grandfathered.


SunCoke’s letter to the IRS is included herein.


Because it does not qualify as an MLP, SunCoke should still be expected to trade
down by 30-40%.


Yesterday I wrote an article highlighting the risk that GP SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SXC)
and its LP SunCoke Energy Partners LP (NYSE:SXCP) would lose their MLP qualification
due to new proposed regulations from the IRS which explicitly excluded the coking of coal
from being treated as qualified income.


Investors were rightly concerned and the stock quickly hit a new 52-week low of $12.82.
However, without the benefits of the MLP structure, SunCoke should clearly head much
lower than that.


SunCoke responded with a press release which stated that the company had, on the
same day, submitted a joint comment letter to the IRS seeking clarification. The stock
jumped sharply, for a time, but then gave up its gains to close flat on the day.


SunCoke stated categorically that:


Although we are seeking clarification of the proposed regulations, we believe that
the proposed regulations as currently drafted support the position that the coking of
coal is a qualifying activity.


There are two not-so-funny things to note here.

The first is that the new proposed regulations have been public for almost 6 weeks now
and SunCoke only felt the need to correspond with the IRS following an article from a
random blogger (me) who highlighted these problems to the public. Despite its assurances
to the contrary, it seems that SunCoke itself was unaware of these implications until just
the time I pointed them out.


The second (and much more serious) thing to note is that SunCoke has now explicitly told
investors the exact opposite of what it has stated to the IRS in writing. (pdf download
available here)


Again, SunCoke told investors that "we believe that the proposed regulations as currently
drafted support the position that the coking of coal is a qualifying activity".


This is very important because it had a material impact on the stock. SunCoke traded as
high as $14.78 - more than 15% above the day's low of $12.82.


But in their letter to the IRS, SunCoke explicitly stated (on page two, paragraph three)
that:


As a result, under the Proposed Regulations as currently drafted, the listed "mining
processes" generate qualifying income and the "refining" of ores generates
qualifying income but the processes that in fact occur between "mining" and
"refining" do not. Thus, the Proposed Regulations would exclude from qualifying
activities numerous mineral processing activities, including the coking of coal

Note: the above document is 9 pages long. I have highlighted the relevant sections in
green on pages 2, 7 and 8.


The entire tone of the letter to the IRS is far different than the confidant tone that was
shown to investors in the press release. Not only does SunCoke admit that under the
proposed regulations it doesn't qualify as an MLP, but throughout the letter, SunCoke is
visibly pleading with the IRS to not take the course that it has, stating in different
instances:


"This result could not have been intended…."


"Fortunately, it is an error…."


"One can only conclude that Congress intended…."


"It is difficult to understand why…"

Problem #2: A "substantial" problem


My original understanding of the argument being raised by SunCoke was that they
believed they still qualified to be treated as an MLP because the chemical changes
involved in coking were not "substantial". In other words, SunCoke acknowledges that
there are chemical changes, but supposedly not to such an extent that it would disqualify
SunCoke's MLP structure.


Yet for some reason SunCoke is now fighting to get the IRS to include activities which DO
CAUSE substantial chemical change.


From page seven, we can see that SunCoke states:


There is simply no basis in section 7704 or in the legislative history for imposing a
blanket exclusion of any activity that results in a "substantial" physical or chemical
change from the definition of processing or refining.


So why is SunCoke fighting this particular fight ?


I think I made a clear case in my last article that coking involves a "substantial" chemical
change. The fact that SunCoke is now fighting to have such "substantial" activities
included in the new regs seems to bolster the argument even more.


Problem #3: MACRS (I missed this one myself….)


In addition to the requirement of engaging in a qualified activity, the new Proposed
Regulations have an accounting requirement which SunCoke does not appear to meet. It
is regarding the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) for depreciation.


Once again, SunCoke has explicitly told the IRS that "we don't qualify".


SunCoke states (page eight):


For example, SunCoke classifies its coke production assets under class 33.4,
which includes "assets used in coke production." That category, however, also
encompasses assets used in a broad array of processes generally relating to the
steel industry…some of those activities, such as the refining of iron ore, clearly are
qualifying activities…but other activities, equally clearly, would not be qualifying
activities. Accordingly, the MACRS limitation should be deleted from the final
regulations.

Problem #4: There will be no grandfathering


In the press release, SunCoke says that:


In order to be grandfathered, a partnership either must have received a private letter
ruling or be engaged in the activity based on a reasonable interpretation of the
statute and its legislative history. We believe that the receipt of the opinion of our
counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that our coking operations generate qualifying income
provides that reasonable interpretation.


We believe that section 7704(d)(1)(E) and its legislative history fully support the
position that coking of coal generates qualifying income and that any final
regulations will clarify the coking of coal is a qualifying activity.


So SunCoke's only basis for stating this opinion is that their law firm had told them so.
This is the same law firm that apparently missed the impact of these changes for the past
6 weeks.


And with respect to that same section 7704(d)(1) referenced above, on page two (as we
saw before) of the letter to the IRS SunCoke states that:


Inexplicably, the Proposed Regulations define the independent section 7704(d)(1)
activity of "processing" to include on the "mining processes" described in Treas Reg.
§1.613-4(f)(1)(ii)...By doing this, the Proposed Regulations ignore the well-
established and long-standing definition of "mining"…and effectively eliminate the
word "processing" of ores and mineral from the statute…. Thus, the Proposed
Regulations would exclude from qualifying activities numerous mineral
processing activities, including coking of coal"


Thus, SunCoke has no real basis for saying that they "believe" that they will be
grandfathered.


Conclusion


As evidenced by the concerns raised in SunCoke's letter to the IRS, SunCoke has a real
problem. SunCoke does not qualify as an MLP.


Yet these problems have been in existence for 6 weeks. And only after my article did
SunCoke address them with the IRS. One can now better understand the frustrations
expressed by Jet Capital in its 13Ds. Management clearly comes across as a group of

uninformed bumblers.


More importantly, I think I have never seen a situation where a company has filed an
explicit press release to assure investors while, on the same exact day, directly
contradicting those exact assurances in a letter signed by the CFO. This appears to be
even worse than just bumbling.


The IRS letter from SunCoke spells out with crystal clarity why SunCoke does not qualify
as an MLP and why it will not be grandfathered. As a result, there is still a very clear 30-
40% near term downside in the stock.


Now that SunCoke is actually aware of the problem, we can expect the company to
strenuously object to the Proposed Regulations in letters to the IRS, citing errors and
conflicts with the intentions of Congress, and etc. This is exactly what Westlake Chemical
and several other affected paper companies will be doing with their own (different)
problems until the comment period ends in August. But as it stands, SunCoke simply does
not qualify as an MLP. So the best they can do is hope that the IRS will change its
regulations in these specific areas to benefit a single corporate interest, namely SunCoke.


As is generally the case, the smart money has already started to figure this out while the
laggards are still scratching their heads. Following the assuring press release from
SunCoke, the stock rose as high as $14.72 - up by 5% on the day. But it quickly gave up
all of those gains to close flat on the day. I therefore believe that I am not the only one to
have read this letter to the IRS. As the letter gets more broadly read, SunCoke should see
immediate downside.
