EXPRESS SCRIPTS: REBATE
SYSTEM IS A FINANCIAL
ENGINEERING KICKBACK
SCHEME


One company in the healthcare system that deserves


to fall to the mighty sword of the new Trump


administration is Express Scripts.  (NASDAQ:ESRX) has


used their position as the nation’s largest PBM to make


itself into

“The reason drugmakers sharply raise list prices


without a corresponding increase in net price is that


PBMs demand higher rebates in exchange for


including the drug on their preferred-drug lists”

Rebates are pharma-speak
for “Kickbacks”.


But Do Not Listen to


Citron!  We are Biased!
All ESRX investors must
read this devastating CMS
bulletin, issued last week
[https://www.cms.gov/Newsroo
sheets/2017-Fact-Sheet-
items/2017-01-19-2.html] :


The rate of growth of PBM rebates
from 2013-2015 is double the rate of
growth of gross drug spending

Often, the Part D sponsor or its
pharmacy bene�ts manager (PBM)
receives additional compensation
after the point-of-sale that serves to
change the �nal cost of the drug for
the payer, or the price paid to the
pharmacy for the drug. Examples of
such compensation include rebates
provided by manufacturers and
concessions paid by pharmacies.


As the growth of rebates and other
price concessions places more of the
burden on bene�ciary cost-sharing,
Medicare’s costs for these
bene�ciaries also grow.


The growing use of rebates and other
price concessions has contributed to
an important shift in how Part D
spending is distributed across the
�nal three phases of the part D
bene�t


Rebates and discounts
biopharmaceutical companies pay to
PBMs and payers do not directly
reduce cost-sharing for these
patients.


As Medicare drug costs spiral out of control, the


percentage of pharma spending Express Scripts


extracts from rebates is far greater than its peers, and


expanding. This sum is now approaching $100 per


person per year for every citizen in the U.S.  Ironically,


ESRX diverts huge cash �ows from companies that


actually invest in innovative R&D into “kickbacks” for


themselves.  They create no new or improved drugs.


The problem is so obvious we read in today’s WSJ:


“Merck has o�ered higher rebates and discounts to


pharmacy-bene�t managers so that they would keep


Merck products on preferred-drug lists”

Conclusion:  It is simple math:  If ESRX loses 50% of its


rebates, they lose 30% of EPS, and the stock goes


straight to $45.


Our 2 cents…..without the
rebate.
