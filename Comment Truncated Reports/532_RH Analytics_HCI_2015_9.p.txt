Summary


HCI Q3'14 policy count revealed in regulatory documents.


We estimate new assumptions will increase the policy count by approximately 40%.


The allure of takeouts is clear, but they come with risks as well.


Policy count is the most basic operating statistic for domestic Florida insurers. Yet, the HCI
Group (NYSE:HCI) appears hesitant to provide it to investors. The company does not
publish its policy count in either its quarterly earnings release or the 10-Q. When asked for
the figure on the Q3'14 conference call, Paresh Patel answered "I don't have it exactly in
front of me, but I think it would be somewhere around 150,000 give or take one or two
(thousand)." We find the lack of transparency surrounding the policy count bewildering.


As it turns out, it was not plus or minus 1,000 or 2,000, as Mr. Patel stated. Filings with the
Office of Insurance Regulation in Florida, OIR, indicate that HCI had 147,737 policies at
the end of Q3'14, which means the policy count was -2,263, from 152,337 polices at the
end of Q2'14. The figures indicate quarterly churn rate of -3%, and an annualized churn of
-11.5%.


Since the close of the quarter, HCI has announced two wind-only dominated assumptions
- a 69,000 policy assumption in December, and a 50,000 policy assumption scheduled for
February. The 119,000 headline assumption numbers are reduced by two factors: policy
selection, and policyholders that choose to opt out of the assumption and remain with
Citizens. In OIR documents, HCI noted that it had selected 47,000 of the approved 69,000
for the December takeout. On December 18, the company announced it had assumed
approximately 36,000 policies in the first assumption, implying a net add rate of 52% of
the headline takeout. Applying the same selection and opt-out rate to the 50,000 policy
takeout scheduled for February implies that HCI will assume approximately 26,000
additional policies.


If the estimates hold, the combined net additions from both assumptions will be roughly
62,000 policies, which will increase HCI's total policy count by roughly 40% to just under
210,000, assuming zero churn in Q4'14 on its existing book. HCI may well vault from the
