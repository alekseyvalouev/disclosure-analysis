Initiation of Columbia Sportswear (COLM) with a Target Price of $45.29 


(51% downside) 
 


Our analysts find related accounting red flags between Columbia Sportswear 


and Under Armour (2017). In fact, GHR believes COLM is at risk of revenue 


recognition and channel stuffing concerns well beyond that of UAA in 2017.   
 


• COLM currently has one of the worst inventory positions in all of retail: As such, 


we calculate that mgmt. has delayed writing down over $225 million of inventory 


(28% of total inventory). 





• COLM’s inventory channel is stuffed: Contrary to sell-side analysts who follow 


COLM, our research reveals that COLM’s wholesale partners are currently stuffed 


with product and will be hesitant to purchase inventory going forward. These 


retailers account for 58.6% of COLM’s total sales in fiscal 2019.  





• COLM positioned for failure in COVID environment: Management looks to be 


waiting for things to get back to normal instead of adapting to the new COVID 


environment. In terms of e-commerce sales (11% of sales in 2019), we see that 


the company has fallen far behind industry leaders such as Lululemon and Nike.  





• Accounting irregularities are littered throughout COLM’s financials: Similar to 


the recent Under Armour debacle, GHR sees elevated red flags at COLM that 


point us to revenue recognition fears. Moreover, extending credit terms to failing 


partners and spiking prepaid expense lead us to believe management has been 


playing games with its financials.  





• Valuation is irrational: COLM’s stock price remained fairly flat throughout a 


turbulent 2020. Based on the analysis laid out herein, we believe that fair value 


of COLM stands at $45.29, or 51% downside.

Key Similarities Between Columbia Sportswear and Under Armour 


GlassHouse juxtaposes both Columbia Sportswear and the past indiscretions of their peer 


Under Armour. Based on our research, we believe COLM is in an ominous accounting position, 


akin to Under Armour in 2017. The end result for UAA was charges of revenue recognition 


violations by the SEC and DOJ, but most importantly, the stock price dropped over 75% from 


all-time highs as a result of management’s malfeasance.  


Key Characteristic  Under Armour (2017) Columbia Sportswear 


Company Led by 
Founders  


Kevin Plank led Under Armour for over 20 


years before being forced to retire in 2019. 


Based on our extensive research, we find that 


most founder-led companies that grow from 


start-ups tend to report poor internal controls 


and liberal uses of their accounting.  


CEO Timothy Boyle took over then-Columbia Hat 


from his father in 1970 when he passed. Remarkably, 


he grew a business with $800,000 in annual sales 


into the $6.20 billion company it is today. However, 


our analysts remain wary of this founder-led 


company’s internal controls and accounting. 


Misstatement 
of Inventory 
Accounting 


Under Armour was accused of pulling revenues 


from future periods by first stuffing the 


channel with products to wholesale customers. 


During the periods in question, UAA’s 3M DSI 


values grew from 120 days in 2014 to 140 days 


in 2017. The increased amount of inventory on 


hand could have been caused by recent 


channel stuffing by management.   


We opine that COLM’s inventory position is much 


worse than UAA’s in 2017. In fact, COLM’s current 


inventory position is one of the worst we have ever 


seen at a public retailer. Whereas UAA’s DSI balance 


grew by only 16% over the three years, COLM’s DSI 


balance has spiked by 76.4% in this year alone (371 


days). Our research points to a highly elevated 


stuffed retail channel that COLM faces in 2020 and 


beyond.  


Violations of 
Revenue 


Recognition 


Sales at UAA were pulled forward in order to 


meet sales estimates for a period of time 


between 2015-2017. Under Armour’s DSO 


value, an indicator of pulled forward sales, 


grew by 56% during this timeframe.  


Management discussed pulling forward sales in 2019 


to the amount of $45 million in Q3 2019. Based on 


the firm’s DSO metric, which has surged 41.8% in the 


last year (76 days), we believe this has taken place 


during other periods as well.  


Motivation  


While management and analysts were 


accustomed to double-digit sales gains at UAA, 


management needed to turn to financial 


engineering to keep the good times going. 


Once the sales growth stopped at UAA, the 


stock was decimated.  


Management’s continual poor inventory decision-


making put the company into dire straits. A glut of 


inventory at the channel level as well as enticing 


retailers with credit terms have backed COLM in 


between a rock and a hard place.  


End Result 


In 2019, CEO Plank “retired,” as his firm was 


engulfed with revenue recognition violations 


presented by the SEC/DOJ. The firm’s stock 


plummeted since then and has never 


recovered.

Columbia Incompetence Puts the Company in Dire Straits 
 


GlassHouse Research first came across Columbia Sportswear (COLM) in our screens in 


2019, when the company was riding high in a banner year. COLM grew the top line 


quarter after quarter and management painted a rosy picture, with new corporate plans 


such as CONNECT, C1, and X1. However, underneath all the revenue gains and promises 


of margin expansion, our analysts found reason to believe that most of the gains were 


artificial in nature, or in other words financially engineered. Outsized inventory metrics, 


unusually high gross margins, pull-forward of sales, extension of credit terms with 


wholesale customers, spikes in prepaid expenses, and new disclosures and risk factors 


detailed in the 10-K lead us to believe that 2019 gains were primarily a farce.  





Then, COVID-19 began to rear its ugly head in early 2020, impacting China and much of 


Asia. While the virus spread in Asia, COLM management quickly weighed their options as 


their supply chain was disrupted. On 02/27/20, the company put out the following Press 


Release placating investors’ fears that its business would be impacted:
GlassHouse Research 


5 | P a g e  
 





Management was not concerned about the coronavirus’ impact on sales outside of Asia, 


focusing on procuring new inventory for fall 2020 and beyond. Two weeks later, COLM 


had to reverse course, shuttering its stores in North America as the virus spread 


throughout North America. 








Based on management comments made in later analyst calls, we believe that during this 


short period, COLM doubled-down on their inventory procurement as management 


panicked at the thought of diminished 2020 sales due to insufficient finished goods. This 


backfired against the company in future periods; our research shows that many of 


COLM’s retailers chose to cancel their orders, leaving COLM with bloated inventory and a 


stuffed channel. By the time management realized there would be substantially reduced 


foot traffic and sales throughout the world, it was too late.  





Management downplayed its massive amount of inventory currently held on hand and 


has told a sensational tale of wholesalers chomping at the bit for refreshed inventory 


receipts in H2 2020. However, based on retailers’ comments and current inventory 


positions, we believe management will need to impair/markdown over $225 million 


worth of inventory in upcoming periods.  





Management’s ineptitude and liberal use of accounting has set the company up for 


complete failure in the new COVID-19 retail environment. While retailers with a large 


online presence like Nike and Lululemon have thrived, it appears that COLM management 


has set itself up for failure.

COLM Inventory Diagnostics are Among the Worst in Retail 





• Registering a bifurcation from its peers and channel retailers, Columbia’s inventory 


increased by 6.7% YOY to $806.9 million as of 06/30/20, the highest absolute level ever 


reported by the company by far. This contrasts with 3M sales, which fell by an 


astonishing 39.8% YOY to $316.6 million.  





• While many of COLM’s peers either took appropriate provisioning or clamped down on 


inventory receipts in the last two periods, COLM was caught flat-footed. As a result of 


continued inventory purchases into H1 of this year, quarterly days-sales-of-inventory 


(DSI1) spiked by 73.4% YOY to 371 days, currently one of the highest in retail. Twelve-


month DSI followed this trend, increasing by 19.5% YOY to 180 days, representing a new 


all-time high for the sportswear company.  





• Analyzing inventory relative to quarterly sales, we find that the current inflated value of 


254.9% (an all-time high), has risen from only 143.7% a year ago. Longer-term trends 


portray a similar trend, increasing by 324 bps YOY to 29.4% of 12M sales.  





• Management has undoubtably blamed the glut of inventory and raised diagnostic 


metrics on the pandemic. However, we see a mismanagement of inventory and 


provisioning, notwithstanding COVID-19. Management’s ineptitude regarding 


heightened inventory purchases going into 2020 remains the crux of our thesis. 











 
1 Three-month days-of-inventory (3M DSI) = Average inventory QOQ / 3M COGS * 91.25. Twelve-month DSI = 
Average inventory YOY / 12M COGS * 365. 


Unlike accruals manipulation, inventory manipulation generates 


real cash costs. Relative to the optimal inventory level, producing 


excess inventory increases the carrying costs (storage, insurance, 


transportation, etc.) and the likelihood of inventory 


obsolescence, spoilage, and write-downs.

• When we analyze inventory relative to normalized sales2, the metrics, although 


improved, reveal a problem at Columbia Sportswear. For example, normalized 3M 


inventory-to-sales still increased by 960 bps YOY to 153.3%, representing the second-


highest ratio recorded in the history of the company. Normalized DSI values reveal a 


similar trend, increasing by 18 days to 232 days, representing a five-year high. 





• Chart 2 on Page 8 shows that while normalizing sales/COGS improved COLM’s inventory 


metrics, excess inventory still remained within the company. DSI levels have increased in 


a stair-step fashion since 2017, revealing management’s unwillingness to provision for 


inventory obsolescence, like many of its peers have.

Chart 2: COLM Normalized DSI Trends 














COLM Needs to Impair $227.1 Million Worth of Excess Inventory  





While the entire retail industry faced inventory headwinds in H1 2020, many of Columbia’s 


competitors chose a different route than our target company. COLM’s competitors were busy in 


Q1 and Q2 because they cancelled supplier purchase obligations immediately, marked down 


their inventory to fair market value with significant losses, and/or sold through a material 


amount of inventory through e-commerce and digital channels. Chart 3 (Page 10) demonstrates 


how much of an outlier Columbia Sportswear is regarding its outsized inventory position.  





Management tried to assuage sell-side analysts and investors’ fears about its over-procurement 


in early March by stating that their wholesale partners had cleaned their inventory and would 


be ready to purchase in great numbers come fall.  





The problem with this theory is twofold. First, even if inventory is viewed relative to future sales 


(using analyst estimates), inventory still spikes to five-year highs of 48.3% and 29.5% of 6M and 


12M forward sales, respectively (see Chart 4, Page 10). Moreover, retailers seem to be stuffed 


with COLM inventory from a product perspective, as discussed later in the report.

With COVID-19 on the rise again in Europe and certain parts of the United States, we believe 


that retailers will continue to be stringent with their inventory procurement in H2 2020. 


Delaying product purchases will crush COLM in two ways: 1) highly diminished sales from 


retailers as they take a wait-and-see approach to the pandemic, and 2) a need to impair millions 


worth of inventory that no one will take off its balance sheet.  





Finally, it is obvious to our analysts that after COLM management realized the massive error of 


its bloated inventory purchases, it decided to pump the breaks in late Q1 and Q2. For example, 


the firm reported purchase obligations from suppliers of $505.0 million at the end of Q1 2020. 


This amount was in line with historical norms for COLM. However, just one period later, this 


amount plummeted to only $232.9 million in purchase orders, as COLM scrambled to cancel 


their orders from suppliers.  





But the damage appears to have been done — even with the decline in supplier orders, 


inventory still ballooned to $806.9 million, the highest balance on record for COLM. Pressured 


by retailers earlier in 2019 to obtain inventory for seasons over 18 months out, the same 


retailers have now cancelled most of their orders with COLM, leaving them high and dry.  








Calculating the Impact: 





Basing our calculations on a normalized 12M DSI ratio of 151 days (previous year’s value), we 


reverse-engineered what we believe is the correct amount of inventory Columbia should 


currently carry. We estimate that COLM’s normalized inventory balance should stand at $579.8 


million (versus $806.9 million currently). Consequently, GlassHouse analysts believe that $227.1 


million of excess inventory needs to be impaired, marked-down, or written-off in future 


periods, putting all the recent TTM operating profits at risk ($224.9 million). With expected 


inventory of $579.8 million in the period, this represents a 23.3% YOY decline, more in line with 


COLM’s 39.8% YOY revenue decline and COLM’s retailers (as discussed later).  





So far, management has been obstinate to impair a meaningful amount of inventory as it 


believes the inventory can be salvaged in future seasons at full price. In fact, we learned that 


management only charged approximately $6 million for inventory obsolescence in the latest 


period (only 2.6% of our estimate), which deviates materially from peers. We believe this is a 


form of earnings management to cosmetically maintain gross margins in current periods.

Gross Margins Remain Unsustainably High Versus Retail Channel 





Analyzing gross margin trends at the retail channel, we find that most retailers took material 


inventory obsolescence write-downs in Q1 and Q2. As a result, gross margins fell dramatically 


within the industry (see Chart 5, Page 12). While COLM’s gross margins only fell by 362 bps and 


201 bps YOY to 47.8% and 46.2% in Q1 and Q2 2020, respectively, the decline in retailers was 


much more pronounced. We calculate that retailer gross margins fell on average by 1,179 bps 


and 437 bps YOY. Contrary to the litany of sell-side analysts who follow COLM, we believe these 


retailers’ demise is a harbinger of things to come for COLM at the wholesale level.  





Additionally, most retailers took substantial hits to their stock price when the degradation of 


gross margins was disclosed. This is where we believe most the sell-side analysts get it wrong 


when it comes to COLM. As discussed, most believe that COLM’s retailers’ inventory books are 


lean and will be eager to buy more in H2 2020; we disagree wholeheartedly. Furthermore, 


analysts believe that gross margins will remain fairly flat in H2 2020, then report expansion in 


H1 2021. Due to compressed sales and increased provisioning over the next year, we believe 


reaching these gross margin estimates will be near impossible.  





When asked about gross margins during the back half of 2020 in the Q2 2020 earnings call, CFO 


Jim Swanson appears to be highly sanguine about the situation, stating: 





I think it's going to be largely dependent upon the consumer and consumer demand 


and the promotional environment from an overall retail standpoint. As you look at 


our first half gross margin, most of the drivers that are in there are COVID related. 


Among them were some fairly significant inventory provisions that we've made, 


given our excess inventory position. Assuming the environment doesn't get worse, I 


wouldn't anticipate that, that continues to be a headwind in the latter part of the year. 





While Mr. Swanson appears to ease analysts’ fears about a degradation of gross margins, we 


find it highly unlikely that the firm will be able to increase margins. It also of note that Mr. 


Swanson gave these comments on July 30th when COVID-19 cases appeared to pass their apex 


in the United States and were miniscule in Europe. However, in the last month, cases have 


increased as the world appears to be bracing for a second wave (see Exhibit 1).

Columbia’s Current Retail Channel is Stuffed 
 


Columbia Sportswear has one of the worst inventory positions in retail. Not only has COLM 


management figured out a way to stuff its own retailer channel with products pre-COVID-19, it 


also figured out a way to purchase an exorbitant amount of finished goods, only to have 


wholesale customers cancel orders. Management has been way off on inventory positioning in 


terms of its customer demand, dating back to 2018. It was almost comical for our analysts to go 


through each earnings call and see how far off-base Mr. Swanson and Mr. Boyle were in their 


assessment of future demand environments.  





But let us start at the beginning.  





In 2017, management came up with “Project CONNECT” to “drive sales, capture cost of sales 


efficiencies, generate SG&A expense savings, and improve marketing effectiveness.” However, 


this project impacted inventories as well. In response to an analyst who questioned the 


company’s inventory growth in 2018, CEO Tim Boyle stated the following: 





But one of the things that the company has in its favor is an enormously strong 


balance sheet frankly. We can have a higher return on the balance sheet by investing 


in inventory where it's appropriate. So we've done a lot of work around Project 


CONNECT to level load our factories, which is going to increase the – a percentage 


– a certain percentage of the inventories that we carry at certain times of the year 


when comparing. And to answer your question about cancellations, actually, it's been 


quite the opposite. So we're very comfortable with the inventories where they are, 


and we believe we're in great shape to keep the business growing (Q2 2018 Earnings 


Call). 





While management kept inventory turns in check throughout 2017, they have now changed 


their strategy through Project CONNECT to hold a larger amount of inventory on hand to satisfy 


suppliers, which is where COLM’s inventory demise began. The firm spouted off double-digit 


percentage gains in inventory over the next seven consecutive periods.  





Based on comments made by Mr. Boyle, Columbia seemed dead-set on keeping an outsized 


amount of inventory on hand throughout 2019, as the firm was ill prepared for the 2018 winter 


season: 





Based on the exquisite year that we had in 2018 and beginning of 2019, where 


inventory levels were compressed. We ran out of inventory in certain categories.
GlassHouse Research 


14 | P a g e  
 


 
And so we probably got a little ahead of ourselves. But as our business is a high 


percentage of repeat products, where we have a significant business and so those – 
that merchandise has been, as I said, on orders that we have for our wholesale 


customers as well as inventory that we'll be placing in our outlet stores. (Q4 2019 


Earnings Call) 





On top of the outsized inventory on hand, management felt pressure from wholesale partners 


to procure inventory earlier in the supply chain. From the firm’s 2018 10K filing, COLM states 


the following:  








Demand Planning and Inventory Management 


As a branded consumer products company, inventory represents one of the largest 


and highest risk capital commitments in our business model. We begin designing and 


developing our seasonal product lines approximately 12 months prior to soliciting 


advance orders from our wholesale customers and approximately 18 months prior to 


the products' availability to consumers in retail stores. As a result, our ability to 


forecast and produce an assortment of product styles that matches ultimate seasonal 


wholesale customer and end-consumer demand and to deliver products to our 


customers in a timely and cost-effective manner can significantly affect our sales, 


gross margins and profitability.  








After this excerpt, Columbia’s accountants and lawyers added the following, which was new to 


the current 10K report: 








The demand planning process has become more complex as an increased proportion 


of the forecast is for in-season replenishment that is not confirmed until later in the 


selling period. Failure to achieve our demand planning goals could reduce our 


revenues or increase our costs, or both, which would negatively affect our gross 


margins and profitability and could affect our brand strength… 





We use those advance orders, together with forecasted demand from our DTC 


businesses, forecasted wholesale order cancellations, reorders and replenishment 


orders, market trends, historical data, customer and sales feedback, and other 


important factors to estimate the volumes of each product to purchase from our 


suppliers around the world. The competitive landscape with our suppliers has 


resulted in our efforts to extend our buying periods and to procure products earlier in 


the seasonal period.
GlassHouse Research 


15 | P a g e  
 





We believe the extended procurement period has presented a significant risk to a legacy 


outerwear company such as COLM. The strategy of buying inventory earlier in the supply chain 


process is what would ultimately become a disaster in 2020. COLM found itself in a conundrum. 


The company faced greater pressure to replenish inventory on demand from its retailers, while 


simultaneously attempting to appease manufacturers by placing orders well before demand 


was confirmed.  





On top of the absurd inventory strategy employed by management in 2019, the company 


continued to execute more blunders as they: 1) doubled-down on inventory purchases in 


March before the pandemic hit the U.S., and 2) heightened the use of extending credit terms to 


retailers to entice purchases, which stuffed their retailers with bloated product.4 Both 


strategies blew up in their faces in 2020.  Now, for the first time, Columbia is discussing 


inventory that will be sold over several years, not months. (Q1 2020 Earnings Call):  





Timothy P. Boyle 





As it relates to carryover inventory, as you know, the bulk of our sales are through 


fairly long historical products and we have good visibility on that merchandise, and 
we have some carryovers that we'll be selling over the next several years. We're 


going to be focusing on inventory turns and liquidity, an area where we really never 
had to manage with the kind of precision we're going to be working with in the 


future. 





Our main thesis speaks to management incompetence relating to inventory procurement time 


and time again. While other competitors and retailers over-provisioned excess inventory, 


cancelled orders and cleaned their books, COLM appears to be happy with the status quo.  





Management also believes that its wholesale customers will purchase products at historical 


levels in H2 2020, greatly deviating from peers’ strategies. Here again is CEO Boyle in the latest 


earnings call: 


 
Timothy P. Boyle 





Certainly. Well, our order book was essentially complete in January of 2020 for fall, 


prior to the pandemic real – hit in Europe and North America. And since then, that 


order book has compressed slightly, not a tremendous amount. But what we've seen 
is, frankly, an opportunity where we have inventory present where we believe that, 


frankly, later in the season, there will be a likely shortage of inventory in winter 


 
4 GlassHouse will discuss this in our Accounting Irregularities section on Page 22.

products. Many of our competitors canceled all orders for merchandise coming in 
from Asia in winter. And we were very selective in terms of how we work that 


effort. And so my feeling is we're in the right position with inventories today 
matching our order book.  





Our analysts scoured every public retailers’ comments regarding inventory purchases in H2 


2020. We have no idea where Mr. Boyle is getting the notion that there will be an inventory 


shortage. We believe H2 2020 will be a rude awakening for a company that continues to make 


all the wrong decisions.  





Retailers Hesitant to Purchase Finished Goods in H2 2020 





Our research points to Columbia’s heavy reliance on their retail channel to move product and 


increase sales. We find COLM’s wholesale revenues grew by 10.6% to $1.78 billion in 2019. 


Furthermore, the company reports that 58.6% of sales originated from their wholesale 


customers in fiscal 2019. While this percentage split stayed steady at 57.4% in Q1 2020, the 


ratio fell to 50.5% in the latest period as retailers cut back and cancelled purchase orders from 


Columbia.

As detailed in our above analysis, management believes that they will be able to sell through 


the current glut of inventory on hand onto its retailers in H2 2020. Much of this theory is based 


on comments made by retailers discussing their clean/lean inventory levels going into the fall 


season. While most retailers have admitted to clean inventory levels heading into the fall, we 


believe this is due to write-downs from an accounting perspective and not a physical one. 


Retailers seem reluctant to purchase inventory for the fall season in a weak demand 


environment. 





Below are major retailers’ inventory positions, as well as recent comments made by 


management. They illustrate COLM’s abysmal approach to the fall and winter retail seasons. 


Although we cannot ascertain specific metrics regarding COLM’s inventory at each retailer, we 


show an overall perspective about what each management team faced going into H2 2020. 





Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)  





In the midst of the pandemic, DKS worked to reduce and cancel their inventory receipts from 


wholesalers almost immediately. Here is Dick’s CFO Lee Belitksy discussing inventories on the 


Q1 2021 call: 





Our quarter end inventory levels decreased 2% compared to the end of the same 


period last year. And working alongside our brands, we acted decisively to reduce, 


defer and cancel planned receipts to align with our new sales forecast. For the rest of 


2020, we are conservatively planning our inventory receipts. 
 





Corroborating our “channel is stuffed” hypothesis, DKS disclosed a material $28 million in 


inventory write-downs on their book in Q1, a major factor in inventory levels’ fall of 2% in the 


period.  





Dick’s CEO discusses the excess of physical inventory on the same call: 





Oh, yes. I don't know yet. None of us do. We think it will probably be a tad more 
promotional because people have inventory to get rid of. 





Looking at Q2 2021 for DKS, the company decreased inventories further by 12% to $1.88 billion. 


Because of this, it kept inventory turns within historical values for the company. Management 


seems to be content with keeping levels here during the reduced traffic environment.
GlassHouse Research 


18 | P a g e  
 





Furthermore, when asked about future inventory receipts in the fall, DKS management focused 


more on home grown brands such as CALIA and Alpine Design Brands, which outperformed the 


company average in the period. A key account for Columbia, it is interesting to note that Alpine 


Designs product lines are in direct competition with Columbia Sportswear (as well as DKS’ CALIA 


being in direct competition with Columbia’s SOREL). According to comments made by Dick’s 


management, DKS continues to give floorspace and web presence to their private label brands 


such as CALIA and Alpine, leaving Columbia out in the cold.  





Nordstrom, Inc (JWN) 





In the latest period, Nordstrom brought inventories down significantly by 24.1% YOY to $1.47 


billion. Though inventories decreased from a dollar perspective, we believe most of the physical 


inventory was marked down and moved to Nordstrom Rack outlets, as discussed on the 


08/25/20 Earnings Call: 


 
The roots of our Rack business is in more efficiently clearing out inventory from our 


Full-Price business, allowing us to flow in new merchandise. So this is certainly a 


time for us to leverage that capability, that asset, to look at our inventory health 
overall across our company, and our Rack team played a huge part in getting us into 


the clean inventory position that we enjoy being in right now. 





Moreover, it appears that management remains cautious about purchasing new inventory in 


the fall: 





And then we're very prudent on the inventory choices that we've made for Q2, 
partially because we really want to make sure we were set up in the transition period 


for fall in the second half of the year… 


 
From an inventory perspective, again, we were very prudent in how we thought 


about this. Our plan was, quite frankly, to just focus on preserving cash and liquidity 
and really looking at how to best manage the biggest investment and risk that we 


have, which is in inventory, primarily seasonal inventory, and we were really pleased 


with how we executed against that. 
 


Macy’s, Inc (M) 





Like Nordstrom, Macy’s reduced inventories by making appropriate markdowns in the period. 


Unfortunately, it appears that with their newfound clean positions, they will lean into 


categories that Columbia is not a part of:
GlassHouse Research 


19 | P a g e  
 





In the quarter, Backstage performed better than our main boxes but still saw sales 


erosion of nearly 45% due to closures. We took appropriate markdowns during the 


quarter to clear through seasonal merchandise in Backstage and enter the third 


quarter in a clean inventory position. The sales recovery is expected to improve in 


the third quarter as we lean into stronger trends in home, casual and basics… 





So what we've seen is that now that we've got our inventory in parity with the 


demand that we're expecting in the back half of the year, seeing some really good 


regular-priced sell-throughs in categories from off-price all the way to luxury, our 


freight is moving very well right now. 





Columbia appears to be at a disadvantage again, with Macy’s happy with its inventory position 


and reluctant to make significant inventory purchases in the fall. This is also corroborated by 


Macy’s 10Q filing:  








Company is approaching the back half of the fiscal year conservatively given an 


anticipation of continued turbulence associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and a 


moderation of its stores' recovery… 





The Company has been and may continue to be required to change its plan for 


inventory receipts, which could place financial pressure on its brand partners. 








Finally, Macy’s, a major Columbia customer, has a real chance of going bankrupt in 2020 


(Altman Z-Score of only 0.96x as of 08/01/20). If Macy’s goes under, it will be unable to pay 


what is due under the extended payment terms that COLM has offered. None of these Macy’s 


retailer level issues bode well for COLM in the upcoming periods.  








Kohl’s Corporation (KSS) 





As of 08/01/20, Kohl’s was able to bring down inventories by 26.2% YOY to $2.70 billion. 


Reducing inventory by this significant amount, the firm was able to reel DSI values within 


historical averages at 133 days. Like the other retailers, Kohl’s may be hesitant to purchase 


material amounts of inventory going forward, based on the CFO Jill Timm’s and CEO Michelle 


Gass’ recent comments:
GlassHouse Research 


20 | P a g e  
 





Our inventory dollars at the end of the quarter were down 26% as compared to last 


year driven by lower inventory receipts during the quarter and our ability to work 


through existing inventory as stores reopened. As we look to the balance of the year, 


we will continue to manage inventories tightly with the opportunity to chase into 


demand… 





Further, we will continue to manage our inventory and expense with great discipline 


and ensure we are prepared to react to the ever-changing environment… 





We positioned our inventory very conservatively. Jill shared inventory down 26%. 


You asked how we're planning the back half of the year. We are continuing to plan 


the back half of the year conservative from an inventory position, but we are working 


very closely with our vendors to go after any upside and chase demand. And you've 


seen us do that in the past. 





JC Penney Company (JCP.Q) 





The now defunct JC Penney reduced inventories by 23.5% YOY to $1.89 billion as of 08/01/20. 


We believe that a large portion of COLM’s recent spike in bad debt expenses may be due to JC 


Penney’s bankruptcy. In either case, this will hit Columbia on multiple fronts: decreased sales 


from a lost retailer and lost receivables/bad debts from a dying company.  





Here is what the company discussed in their latest 10Q filing (JCP no longer releases earnings 


calls): 


 
Merchandise inventory decreased $580 million, or 23.5%, to $ 1,891 million as of 


the end of the second quarter of 2020 compared to $ 2,471 million as of the end of 


the second quarter of 2019 and decreased $275 million from year-end 2019, as a 


result of the deferral of supplier shipments due to the closing of stores and resulting 


decline in sales. Merchandise payables decreased $642 million as of the end of the 


second quarter of 2020 compared to the corresponding prior year period and 


decreased $550 million from year end 2019.
GlassHouse Research 


21 | P a g e  
 


Dillard’s, Inc (DDS) 





Dillard’s inventories declined by 20.0% YOY to $1.28 billion as of 08/01/20. While the company 


does not publish earnings calls, we found information regarding inventory procurement from 


the company’s 10Q filings:  


 
The Company took a number of actions to enhance liquidity during the six months 


ended August 1, 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, including the 
following: 





• Extended vendor payment terms during the first quarter but restored most 
vendors to standard payment terms by August 1, 2020 


• Canceled, suspended and significantly delayed merchandise shipments 


• Reduced merchandise purchases during the first and second quarters by 
33% and 62%, respectively 


• Reviewed and reduced discretionary operating and capital expenditures 


• Reduced payroll expense 


• Executed aggressive promotional markdowns to clear inventory 


 
Now that we ran through the gauntlet of Columbia retailers and their recent demand 


environment, can we say with a straight face that we are excited about inventory purchases 


going into the back half of the year? With COVID-19 resurging in the fall in many parts of 


Europe and the United States, we cannot for the life of us understand why Columbia 


management would be so optimistic going into the fall season.

Revenue Recognition Concerns Headline Accounting Red Flags 
 


As aforementioned, earnings quality issues sprouted up at COLM even before the pandemic hit. 


We now believe that the pandemic exacerbated these issues to cataclysmic levels at the firm. 


For example, while 2019 was a banner year for the sportswear company in terms of revenue 


and profits, we believe much of these gains were artificially enhanced by accounting gimmicks. 


One of these gimmicks relates to the firm’s receivables balance and the extending of credit to 


retail customers. Our following analysis presents how the firm was able to pull forward sales 


into current periods, which runs parallel to Under Armour’s strategies in 2017.  





In Q3 2019, consensus estimates for revenues in the period stood at $883.3 million. But COLM 


reported revenue of $906.8 million, or a 13.9% YOY gain. Digging into the earnings call, we 


found that a material amount of $45 million in sales was pulled from Q4 into Q3.  
 


Analyst 


Congrats on a strong quarter. Just first, maybe for Jim, can you help us frame the 
impact of the timing shifts given the earlier shipment of the fall 2019 orders? So if 


you normalize that out, can you help us quantify maybe the dollar value or EPS 
impact of that pull-forward? 





Jim A. Swanson – CFO  
Yes. Absolutely. So in our second quarter earnings call, I'd indicated that the shift 


was going to be about $20 million out of the fourth quarter and into the third quarter 
relative to the experience that we've had last year. And as we sit here today, and 


obviously we had the earlier receipt of our inventory that we've been reflecting in our 


inventory balance, that shift became about $45 million from – again from Q4 and 
into Q3 and, call it, 2/3 of that was in the U.S. There's a portion of that was 


international as well. And that's, by and large, what drove the upside to our outlook 
for the quarter. So it's more of a timing shift than anything. 





As a result of the timing shift, management beat estimates by 2.7% in the period. However, 


sans this artificial gain, revenues would have been $861.8, resulting in missing earnings by 


2.4%. Timing shifts like these are eerily similar to the SEC’s charges of revenue recognition 


violations against Under Armour. This quote from UAA details the accusations presented 


against them: 





The Wells Notices, which the SEC uses to inform investigation subjects that it 


intends to bring enforcement actions against them, relate to sales that were allegedly 


pulled forward during a period from the third quarter of 2015 through the end of
GlassHouse Research 


23 | P a g e  
 


2016, Under Armour said. The SEC is “focused on the company’s disclosures 


regarding the use of pull-forward sales in order to meet sales objectives.”5 





Since then, an increase in COLM’s receivables diagnostics give us great cause for concern. The 


continued rise indicates two nefarious signals: 1) the company is using relaxed credit terms to 


entice retailers into shifting future sales into current periods, and 2) the company is now at risk 


of heightened bad debt expenses from failing retailers during COVID-19.  





We present our accounts receivable (AR) analysis below:  





• Dating back to Q4 2017, our research points to 11 consecutive quarters where 


receivable growth outpaced sales. As a result, an AR-to-3M sales value of 49.6% (42.4% 


under ASC 605) in Q2 2018 spiked up to a current value of 68.7% just two years later 


(see Chart 7 on Page 24). 





• This increase represents a 1,915 bps (2,627 bps ASC 605) gain in just a two-year period 


and a new five-year seasonal high for the company (under either ASC 606 or 605).  





• Days-sales-outstanding (DSO) metrics have also exploded over the last two years, when 


we believe most of the channel stuffing and timing shifts have occurred. While AR 


decreased by 22.5% YOY to $217.5 million at the end of Q2, sales declines outpaced this, 


plummeting by 39.8% during Q2 2020. As a result, 3M DSO surged by 41.8% YOY to 76 


days; the highest DSO value recorded by COLM in the last five-years (under ASC 606 or 


605).  





• Based on our analysis, we believe that management pulled forward $70.9 million of 


sales in fiscal year 2019, normalizing the firm’s DSO balance, then reverse-engineering a 


normalized AR balance. This amounts to 18.0% of 2019 operating profits and will be a 


major headwind in future periods.  





• Exacerbating COLM’s receivable woes, the firm’s bad debt expense spiked in 2020 as 


several of the company’s retail partners face possible bankruptcy. Astonishingly, 


Columbia’s allowance for doubtful account (AFDA) increased by 256.6% YOY to $28.8 


million. We believe this could just be the start, in terms of sufficient provisioning. COLM 


cites bad debts as a material reason for the increase in SG&A costs in the Q2 period 


stating, “increased bad debt expense, reflecting heightened AR risk resulting from the 


ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.”

Excerpts from COLM’s annual filings corroborate our thoughts regarding extending payment 


terms to customers:  


 
We extend credit to our wholesale customers and international distributors based on 


an assessment of the customer's financial condition, generally without requiring 


collateral. Wholesale customers may receive extended payment terms when placing 


advance orders and taking delivery of finished goods prior to peak seasonal shipping 


periods. We generally utilize credit insurance or standby letters of credit to minimize 


our risk of credit loss for customers in certain markets or with qualifying 


circumstances. We manage our inherent risk of uncollectable receivables by 


maintaining and investing in information systems, processes and personnel skilled in 


credit, risk analysis and collections. 





The continued increase of AR diagnostics is a harbinger for a heightened extension of payment 


terms in two ways. First, the spike in receivables relative to sales portends finished goods being 


shipped earlier in the sales process to the retailer, but the cash payment is then delayed. 


Second, the salient rise of bad debt expense leads us to believe that the receivables are badly 


aged, as COLM is not being paid in a timely manner, if at all.  





Finally, we would like to highlight an excerpt from COLM’s risk factors in their 10Q filing that 


appears to be clairvoyant in nature: 





Our Orders from Customers Are Subject to Cancellation 


We do not have long-term contracts with any of our wholesale customers…  If any of 
our major customers, including distributors, experience a significant downturn in 


business or fail to remain committed to our products or brands, these customers could 


postpone, reduce, cancel, or discontinue purchases from us. As a result, we could 
experience a decline in sales or gross profit, write-downs of excess inventory, 


increased discounts, extended credit terms to our customers, or uncollectable accounts 
receivable, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, 


results of operations or cash flows. 


 
We are floored with the accuracy of COLM accountants/lawyers regarding the above excerpt. 


Literally everything they discuss above is playing out in front of their eyes in real time and is 


only going to get worse. However, by the tone and direction of management on the latest 


earnings call, they will have you believe that H2 will bring a surplus of demand out of nowhere 


which will solve their earnings quality woes. This is wishful thinking. In our later sections, we 


will reveal how ill-prepared COLM is in an everlasting COVID-19 world.
GlassHouse Research

Outsized Prepaid Expenses Responsible for $18.8 million of Operating Gains 





In general, we view growth of prepaid expenses and other current assets (AKA prepaids) ahead 


of revenue and/or total operating expenses as a potential indicator of excess costs stored on 


the balance sheet (i.e., excess relative to their expected future benefits). Regardless of whether 


the build-up occurred as a result of deterioration in (macro or micro) economic circumstances 


or a relatively higher rate of capitalization (slower amortization) than in prior periods, the end 


result is the same. Absent similar growth in revenues, margins will decline as these costs must 


ultimately be amortized against earnings.  





Columbia has been fairly tight lipped with regards to their prepaid assets. However, GlassHouse 


believes a large portion of these excess costs revolve around several IT infrastructure endeavors 


the company is taking on. No matter the reasoning behind it, the remaining excess costs stored 


on the balance sheet will unwind in future periods, compressing margins and profits. 
 


• GHR observes a consistent rise in prepaid expenses and other current assets on COLM’s 


balance sheet. In Q3 2017, the company reported a balance of only $36.1 million, 


however since then, this balance has accelerated in a parabolic fashion up to $102.6 


million in the latest period.6 Lacking from COLM’s footnotes, the firm reported an 


increase in this account at a time when revenues were down 39.8% YOY. GlassHouse 


finds that a divergence of this magnitude with no clarifications highly peculiar, especially 


with a blessing from Columbia’s auditor.  





• Prepaid expenses, other current assets and non-current other assets are not discussed 


at all in COLM’s 10K report, notwithstanding a small amount of currency forward 


contracts disclosed. While this figure continued to increase in 2020, there was little to 


no disclosures as to why the current balance stands at $102.6 million.  





• In the excerpt below from the 2019 10K filing, we see that prepaids consumed over 


$15.1 million, $9.78 million, and $19.2 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively – all 


highly material amounts. Other assets consumed a material $3.55 million and $12.4 


million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We are perplexed to find no mention of this 


highly material consumption of cash in the liquidity and capital resource section of the 


company’s 10K filing.   





 
6 As a result of ASC 606, prepaid expenses increased by $12.2 million on 01/01/18.
GlassHouse Research 


27 | P a g e  
 








• Digging into the numbers, prepaids have outpaced both 3M sales and 3M OpEx on a YOY 


basis by 1,324 bps and 864 bps, respectively as of Q2 2020. As a result of the recent 


growth in this account, prepaid expenses are up to 32.4% (29.4%), relative to 3M sales 


(3M OpEx). Both these ratios are at their respective five-year high, showing the severity 


of this unusual increase. 





• We find similar results when the level of prepaids is added to long-term other assets 


(AKA Total Other Assets or TOA). For instance, total other assets jumped 2,449 bps YOY 


to 51.7% of 3M sales. Again, analyzing total other assets versus 3M OpEx, TOAs also 


increased 1,744 bps YOY to 47.0%; both historical maximums for Columbia (see Chart 8). 


Longer-term trends reveal a similar trend with TOAs rising 101 bps YOY to 6.8% of 12M 


OpEx in the period, representing an all-time high.
GlassHouse Research 


28 | P a g e  
 





• To quantify the rise in TOAs relative to earnings, we calculate that if Columbia would 


have kept the TOA-to-12M sales ratio constant at its Q2 2019 value of 6.0%, the 


company would need to reduce operating income by $18.8 million, or 8.4% of all TTM 


operating income.

Capitalizing expenses is the easiest way for CEOs and 


CFOs to create faux earnings in any given period. 


Prepaid expenses are rarely discussed on conference 


calls, as analysts are too busy digesting 


management’s guidance and updating their models.  





In our experience, it is the perfect account to 


manipulate, as it is often overlooked.

COLM is Positioned for Failure in New Normal 
 


So far, our report has detailed how management got into this mess at Columbia. A stuffed 


inventory channel, pulling revenue forward, collection risks, and heightened deferred expenses 


are major red flag accounting risks that will reverse violently in future periods. Yet, in the face 


of these headwinds, management has told sell-side analysts with a straight face that it believes 


it is better positioned than the competition for H2. 





Bad decision after bad decision have put the company into this precarious situation: 





• First, management under-procured enough inventory to satisfy demand in the 2018 


winter season.  





• In order to combat this bad decision, management over-purchased inventory from 


China throughout 2019, which it completely overshot. In later conference calls, 


management discussed ageing of inventory being higher than normal, saying that some 


may need to carry into future seasons. 





• As a result, COLM pulled forward sales and stuffed the channel to rid itself of inventory 


on the books.  





• At the beginning of 2020, management panicked at the thought of not being able to 


procure inventory for the Fall 2020 season, due to China disruptions. It then procured 


excess inventory, assuming that COVID-19 was contained in Asia. 





• Two weeks later, COVID-19 spread to the United States and COLM shut down all its brick 


and mortar stores. 





• In the latest earnings call, management had the audacity to talk about their “great 


position” after doing so much wrong over the past two years.  
 


Timothy Boyle – CEO  
But what we've seen is, frankly, an opportunity where we have 


inventory present where we believe that, frankly, later in the season, 


there will be a likely shortage of inventory in winter products. Many of 
our competitors canceled all orders for merchandise coming in from 


Asia in winter... So I think, frankly, we're in a great position here.
GlassHouse Research 


30 | P a g e  
 





• Finally, in a period when competitors have smartly leaned on their e-commerce and 


digital platforms, COLM’s internet/mobile presence is nowhere near other market 


leaders such as Nike and Lululemon. Making matters worse, their main digital mobile 


experience “X1” was set to be released in early 2019, which was delayed to early 2020, 


and now will not be released until late 2020 … maybe.  





Failed X1 E-Commerce Roll-Out Another Blunder by C-Suite 





In 2018, Columbia introduced Experience First (X1) as this would revolutionize the company’s e-


commerce system: 





Experience First ("X1") 


We have also made the decision to launch a new initiative, X1. This initiative within 
our DTC operations is designed to enhance our e-commerce systems to take advantage 


of the changes in consumer browsing and purchasing behavior towards mobile 
devices. It encompasses an upgrade of our e-commerce platforms to offer improved 


search, browsing, checkout, loyalty, and customer care experiences for mobile 


shoppers, and is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2019. The project will 
be fully integrated with our C1 initiative, and will be implemented across all of our 


brands. 








How prescient it was for Columbia to launch a brand-new revolutionary e-commerce platform 


right before a global pandemic that would highly reduce foot traffic just one year later. But 


oops, the X1 e-commerce platform did not launch in early 2019; however, Columbia promised it 


would be ready in late 2019. 





“While we are continuing to work towards 2019 implementations of C1 and X1, we may shift 


that timeline to ensure completeness of each system and to align timing of go-live with our 


retail calendar and store rollout plan.” – Q4 2018 Earnings Call 





Ok ready to roll out in late 2019… 





“While we are continuing to work toward North American implementation of C1 in the second 


half of 2019, we are now working towards a phased implementation of X1, beginning with 


Europe-direct in 2019, followed by the launch of North America in ‘20.” – Q1 2019 Earnings Call 
 


Well at least it would be ready before the pandemic hit…

“We continue to invest in our Experience First initiative or X1 and intend for the platform to go 


live for the Columbia, SOREL and Mountain Hardwear brands in North America prior to the peak 
holiday [2020] sales period.” – Q1 2020 Earnings Call 
 


Looks like a wasted opportunity to us at GlassHouse. We find it hard to believe that consumers 


who were sitting at home for six months, underwhelmed by Columbia’s legacy digital platform, 


would sign back on in the winter with an X1 product that may or may not be ready. The gold 


standard in the space lies within Nike and Lululemon. Their recent margin expansion and stock 


price rise is justified based on their digital presence (discussed in next section).  





E-Commerce Metrics Nothing to be Excited About at Columbia 





During the latest earnings call, management touted the performance of their DTC e-commerce 


division, which grew by 72% YOY. While this percentage alone may seem a success to some, our 


analysts are not convinced.  





Management has been tight-lipped about their e-commerce figures. It has not provided 


absolute numbers of e-commerce sales, and this quarter was one of the first times it discussed 


specific e-commerce numbers (although they are discussed in vague terms in the CFO 


commentary).  





Reverse-engineering e-commerce sales based on comments made by management, we find an 


e-commerce trend that does not stack up well versus industry leaders (see Chart 9, Page 33). 


Prior to the pandemic, COLM’s e-commerce sales decelerated into single-digit growth in Q3 and 


Q4 2019. Only after the pandemic reduced traffic in brick and mortar stores did e-commerce 


begin to resurge. Finally, analyzing e-commerce sales as a percentage of total sales, we find a 


ratio of only 11% in 2019 to be highly insufficient compared to COLM’s peers.  





Here is market laggard Under Armour discussing an appropriate amount of e-commerce sales in 


a recent earnings call: 





Although we expect e-commerce sales to represent a higher portion of our overall 


business in 2020, sales in this channel have historically represented a small 


percentage of our total revenue. For example, in 2019 sales through our direct to 


consumer channel represented 34% of net revenues, with our e-commerce business 


representing less than half of the total direct to consumer business [17%].
GlassHouse Research

Even Under Armour realizes that e-commerce sales under 20% of total sales in the new digital 


environment are not enough to attract modern customers.  





Market leader Nike discussed the appropriate amount of online sales in a recent earnings call: 





This next phase of our Consumer Direct Offense is expected to drive sustainable 


growth and profitability as we accelerate NIKE to a digital-first company. We are 


committed to the execution of this strategy, despite the short-term adverse impacts 


to our business from a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). As such, our long-


term financial goals on average, per year, remain the same and are outlined 


below… digital is fueling how we create the future of retail… And looking ahead, we 


now expect our overall business to reach 50% digital penetration. 





Nike understands the ever-changing customer and is shooting for an astonishing 50% in digital 


sales, which would have sounded crazy just three years ago. Another market leader, Lululemon, 


is astoundingly already there, reporting over 60% of sales from their direct-to-consumer 


channel as of 08/02/20.  





There is a new normal in retail. There will be winners and losers. Columbia is a loser. 


Management teams like COLM that are praying for a return to normal will get decimated over 


the next year, as consumer preferences to online accelerate. COVID-19 is not going away, 


rather, it is resurging in Europe and in areas of the U.S. If management were truly adapting to 


this pandemic, X1 would have been released six months ago and management would have 


cleaned the inventory off its books, like most of the retail industry.

Conclusion 


The bull case regarding Columbia Sportswear’s stock price revolves around the following tenets 


that we believe the sell-side community has misunderstood. Sell-side analysts believe:  





• Retailers currently have lean inventories and will be ready to purchase inventory from 


COLM at heightened levels in the fall/winter season.  


• COLM will expand gross margins in H2 2020 and beyond.   


• The company’s e-commerce sales will buoy COLM’s top-line in future periods during the 


pandemic. 


• The impact of COVID-19 is transitory and will not affect Columbia in the long-term.  





We have gone step-by-step to debunk many of these flawed reasonings for investors and 


analysts. Based on our analysis, we believe that much of the recent sales growth in 2019 was 


attributable to channel stuffing and pulling revenue forward. We believe that the company’s 


gross margins will fall off a cliff in H2 2020 and beyond as the firm deals with heightened 


markdowns and write-offs. On top of a gross margin decline, our prepaid expense analysis 


points to operating margin degradation over the next year as well. Finally, we detailed how 


management’s handling of the X1 e-commerce platform is in disarray at the worst possible 


time.  





As such, we believe Columbia’s stock price will decline precipitously over the next twelve 


months as these accounting gimmicks reverse violently. Furthermore, we highly doubt that the 


sell-side community fully comprehends the magnitude of accounting headwinds that COLM will 


face over the next year.  





For our valuation, we used COLM’s peer group median FWD P/E value of 21.5x (see Table 3, 


next page) and our sustainable earnings ($2.11) to arrive at our fair value. In analyzing the 


firm’s sustainable values, we made conservative adjustments to earnings figures that are 


detailed throughout this report. As such, we believe a fair share-price for the firm currently 


stands at $45.29, which represents a 51% downside to the share-price.  





In light of our concerns regarding the myriad of accounting red flags laid out herein, GlassHouse 


finds the current stock price to be highly irrational. Accordingly, we initiate coverage on 


Columbia Sportwear (COLM) with a target price of $45.29.
