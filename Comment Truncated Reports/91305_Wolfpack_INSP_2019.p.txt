Inspire Medical Systems: A Nightmare Investment 


Introduction 


Wolfpack is short Inspire Medical Systems (INSP). The annual market opportunity promoted by its 


management is so preposterous that it must be disingenuous, leaving investors holding the bag of this 


terminally unprofitable business. It turns out that Inspire can barely even give their device away: It has 


been available to ~9 million enrolled U.S. Veterans for free since 2014, but data from the VA hospital 


system show only 387 total patients have opted for Inspire’s surgery. Our research shows Inspire can’t 


even sell 20,000 units in a year, much less the 500,000 units claimed by management. Inspire’s surgically 


implanted device comes with a long list of onerous lifestyle restrictions and insufferable side-effects that 


permanently haunt past patients and drive off potential patients. Insiders have pocketed more than $340 


million from stock sales, nearly 3x the company’s total revenue since the 2018 IPO. Inspire is only good 


at selling two things: this ridiculous growth story and their stock. 


Summary 


Inspire’s device is far too invasive and restrictive to ever gain traction in a market with numerous non-


invasive alternatives.  


Inspire promotes itself as a minimally-invasive and more convenient solution for Obstructive Sleep 


Apnea (“OSA”). We found that Inspire’s surgery is anything but minimally-invasive. It carries serious 


risks such as laceration of the jugular, paralysis and leaves large visible scars on the patient’s neck and 


chest. Further, Inspire’s device requires additional surgeries to replace the battery every 7-10 years for the 


rest of your life, which is a shit sandwich in-and-of itself.  


In the years between these surgeries, Inspire’s device can cause serious injury if the patient has a 


pacemaker, undergoes an MRI, or requires defibrillation during a cardiac event.1 All Inspire patients have 


to live with a nightmarish list of restrictions that make Inspire’s “therapy” as inconvenient as we could 


possibly imagine. They must worry about every day activities like answering their cell phone, using a 


computer or power tools, going to the store and going through airport security because Inspire’s device 


can be damaged by any one of these activities, requiring yet another surgery.  


Would you be willing to take on all of these risks and restrictions to “ease the symptoms” of a condition 


that has numerous non-surgical treatment options?

We reached out to several Inspire patients who had written about their experience online and spoke to 


four who were willing to share their story with us in detail. After hearing these stories, it appears that the 


adverse-effects and lifestyle restrictions of Inspire’s device can be worse than the symptoms of OSA 


itself. Inspire’s own studies show that the unhappy patients we spoke to were not outliers. During 


Inspire’s self-funded Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction (“STAR”) study, the key to its FDA 


approval, 85% (107 out of 126) of patients suffered at least one adverse event. During the 12-month 


study, these 107 patients experienced 494 total adverse events.2 We consider this to be very concerning, 


considering that Inspire hand-picked the patients for this study, rejecting 86% of the original applicants.  


Inspire’s real-world FDA submitted adverse event reports include horror stories of surgeons lacerating the 


patient’s jugular during surgery and patients nearly dying on the operating table, ending up in ICU 


without ever receiving the implant.  


We have provided a full list of these 192 adverse event reports in Appendix D to this report. In the last 


month and a half, ten new adverse events were reported to the FDA, five of which resulted in removal of 


the device for medical necessity. 


Two of the Inspire patients we spoke to allowed us to share their stories. We will refer to them as “Patient 


A” and “Patient B.” Patient A felt she was misled about the procedure and the device itself, and that if she 


had been warned of the potential side-effects, she never would have had the device implanted at all. She 


told us she experienced three serious adverse events, one of which involved temporary paralysis caused 


by part of the device slipping down into her abdomen. She claims that when she attempted to contact 


Inspire about this adverse event, they rejected her claim and “vehemently denied it could have happened.” 


Inspire now ignores her calls, leaving her only with visible scars and regret.  


Patient B was nearly 80 years old when she had Inspire’s device implanted. She complains that the 


constant electrical shocks feel like someone is “tugging and twisting” her tongue. This is not an isolated 


incident – one-third of the patients in Inspire’s STAR study complained of similar discomfort from the 


electrical stimulation.3 Even worse, Patient B now carries a bucket around her house because of the 


significant excess mucus production she has experienced since the device was implanted. Inspire does not 


list this as a potential side-effect of its “therapy.” Patient B says that the Inspire device has “ruined her 


life.” Neither of these patients still use the device, but they are afraid to have it removed due to the serious 


risks associated with the removal surgery. 4 


We also found a growing list of customer complaints, with terrifying descriptions of the potential 


downsides to Inspire’s invasive procedure, such as “drooling, facial paralysis or drooping, slurred 


speech” and “nerve damage resulting in numbness and discoloration of one side of the tongue, or battery 


leaking into body.” These are just a few of the dozens of customer complaints that we found. You can see 


the full list in Appendix E of this report. 


Our research shows that Inspire’s management exaggerates its TAM by at least 50x in order to sell 


investors a growth story they must know is fictional. Despite incessantly touting a $10 billion (500,000 


unit) annual market opportunity, insiders have sold more than $340 million worth of stock since the IPO – 


nearly 3x the company’s total revenues during that period. Most recently, Chau H. Khuong, an Inspire 


Director and Partner at OrbiMed Advisors, sold 1.5 million shares for ~$130 million between March 3-6. 


Just weeks later Inspire pulled its 2020 guidance and announced a secondary offering of 2 million shares 


at $58.00, a ~35% discount to Khuong’s well-timed sales.

Sleep Apnea experts we spoke to told us that OSA symptoms are often so subtle that patients don’t even 


realize they have a condition. Inspire’s solution for OSA is proving to be about as popular as lobotomies 


were for treating migraines in the 1950s.5 Inspire’s device has been on the market for 5 years in the U.S. 


and 9 years in Europe and has only sold ~7,200 units worldwide. 


Inspire’s massively overstated TAM also underpins investors’ dreams of achieving profitability through 


economies of scale. However, Inspire is actually exhibiting diseconomies of scale. Despite growing its 


unit sales from ~2,300 in 2018 to ~3,700 in 2019, Inspire’s SG&A expense per unit actually increased 


from $23,800 to $24,800. Inspire has already reached the most desperate OSA patients, making each unit 


more expensive to sell. At an operating margin of -42.5% and free cash flow burn of -$10,000 per unit in 


2019, it may seem impossible for INSP’s financial performance to get much worse, but it can, and we 


believe it inevitably will.  


This company will likely never make a profit. Its device is only a feasible therapy for Strict Amish 


Communities who don’t use cell phones, power tools, computer disk drives or basically any other 


technology that we can’t live without. Furthermore, we found empirical evidence to prove how unrealistic 


Inspire’s $10 billion per year TAM claim is.  


Data from Inspire’s most mature markets show that, in reality, the vast majority (99%+) of OSA patients 


refuse Inspire’s surgical solution. Inspire can’t even sell patients their device for free. For example, 


Inspire’s device has been available to ~9 million U.S. veterans at no cost to the patient through the U.S. 


Veterans Administration (“VA”) for more than five years.6 However, instead of taking off toward 


Inspire’s massive purported TAM, Inspire’s sales to the VA peaked at only 150 units (~1% of VA CPAP) 


in 2018 and fell to a mere 110 units (~0.7% of VA CPAP) in 2019.7  


Because patients must first try and reject CPAP treatment to be eligible for Inspire’s implant, the number 


of new CPAP users per year is the starting point for its top-down TAM calculation and the basis for its 


hyperinflated TAM claims. Inspire uses an internal “company estimate” of 2 million new CPAP users per 


year for this critical assumption. After speaking to numerous industry experts and hearing over and over 


that Inspire’s estimate was far too high, we decided to engage an independent market research firm to get 


the kind of precise data that Inspire refuses to provide.8 Their data showed that new CPAP users per year 


are less than half of the 2 million internal “company estimate” Inspire uses in its TAM calculation. After 


adjusting for patient preference and reviewing Inspire’s actual sales performance in the five years since 


its FDA approval, we conclude that Inspire’s realistic TAM is less than 2% of what management claims. 


Our research proves to us that the internal estimate Inspire uses as the basis for its growth story is a farce. 


We are providing more truly independent data and estimates for investors than Inspire has. We challenge 


Inspire’s management to provide investors with evidence that supports its opaque internal estimate of 2 


million new CPAP prescriptions per year, which it uses as the starting point in its TAM calculation. We 


spent months speaking to experts, market research firms and other industry participants, none of whom 


believed Inspire’s estimate of 2 million new CPAP prescriptions per year was anywhere near realistic.  


Our investment thesis on Inspire: Focus on management’s actions, not their words. 


Note: This is not a COVID-19 thesis. While Inspire’s 2020 sales will undoubtedly be decimated by the 


cancellation of elective surgeries, which management unsurprisingly waited as long as possible to 


mention to investors, our thesis on Inspire has nothing to do with COVID-19 and everything to do with 


management cashing out while promoting bad faith estimates for future growth, which our research 


shows to be entirely unrealistic.

1. Inspire’s Solution is Worse Than the Problem: 


In its promotions, Inspire downplays the terrifying side-effects and high adverse event rates of its surgery 


by referring to its device as a minimally-invasive solution. CEO Tim Herbert made the following 


statement at the SVB Leerlink Global Healthcare Conference on February 26, 2020: 


“And so, here's the new brand, keep it really simple, no mask, no hose, just sleep. We don't talk 


about implant, we don't talk about surgery, we talk about a therapy that will -- you'll use every 


night in your -- procedure, and… so, here's two commercials that we ran.”
9
 


However, the Inspire surgical manual tells the surgeon to make three cuts of 2.5 inches each. One on the 


jaw, one on the collarbone, and another on the ribs. The device then goes into a “pocket” which is 


“scooped out” of the chest by the surgeon. The lead wires are “tunneled” to the throat and rib-cage. Then 


excess wire is bundled or wrapped around the device. This seems invasive to us, unless you’re comparing 


it to having a lung removed.  


Inspire, by its own admission, purposely avoids talking about implants and surgery because they know 


these are deterrents to potential patients. See Appendix B for the full gauntlet of pre and post-op 


procedures Inspire’s patients must undergo. We spoke to one Inspire patient who felt she was misled 


about the procedure and the device itself. We will refer to her as “Patient A.” 


Patient A believes that Inspire’s device never would have worked for her and that if she had been warned 


of the potential side-effects, she never would have had the device installed at all. The picture below, 


provided by Patient A, shows just how invasive this procedure really is. 


10 Days Post-op: 





Patient A told us about three serious adverse events she experienced. She claims that one of these events 


involved part of the device slipping down into her abdomen, resulting in temporary paralysis. She regrets 


ever getting involved with Inspire and no longer uses the device. 


Another Inspire patient we spoke to, who we’ll refer to as “Patient B,” was nearly 80 when she had the 


device implanted. She claims the procedure has resulted in the glands in her throat producing significant 


amounts of excess mucus. She now carries a bucket around her house to avoid making a mess, as she 


coughs up mucus throughout the day. Although in her 80s now, Patient B had a healthy social life until 


the Inspire treatment took its toll. Excess mucus production is not listed as a potential side effect, but 


Patient B believes it clearly should be.

She also complains that the constant electrical shocks feel like someone is “tugging and twisting” her 


tongue. This is a very common complaint from Inspire patients – one-third of the patients in Inspire’s 


STAR study complained of discomfort from the device’s electrical shocks, which are supposed to be 


providing the “therapy.”10 Patient B claims the Inspire treatment has “ruined her life,” and we can 


understand why. 


Just like Patient A, Patient B finds the device impossible to live with. She no longer turns it on at night. 


Both patients want to have the device removed but fear the significant risks associated with the removal 


surgery. So, they have simply left the device in place – a not-so-subtle reminder of what changed their 


lives forever. 


We include a very long list of adverse event reports from the FDA database in Appendix D. There are a 


disturbing number of cases of surgeons “lacerating” the jugular vein during the procedure, as well as 


other nightmarish, near-death stories like this one: 


“During a surgical procedure to implant the Inspire System, shortly after putting the stimulation 


cuff on, the patient coded and his heart rate went down to 28. An emergency team responded in 


the operating room and provided treatment. Immediately after treatment, the patient's blood 


pressure dropped and the emergency team again provided treatment. The physician decided to 


end the case. The patient is currently in the ICU and should make a full recovery.” 


Inspire reports having done ~7,200 implants, and there have been 192 adverse events reported to the FDA 


as of the date of this writing, which equates to a real-world adverse event rate of ~2.7%. However, during 


Inspire’s initial 12-month STAR Study, when all patients were monitored and all adverse events were 


documented, 107 out of 126 patients (85%) suffered at least one adverse event and there were 494 total 


adverse events.11 Several medical experts we spoke to said it’s expected that many real-world adverse 


events would go unreported for a variety of reasons, so a real-world adverse event rate higher than 1% 


would be considered a major red flag to them. 


Inspire’s surgery is bad, but the device’s restrictions are even worse 


Inspire promises patients a mask-free sleep in exchange for long list of more onerous restrictions on their 


everyday life. The restrictions on cell phones, power tools, computers and other technology makes it 


impossible for patients to resume their normal lives after surgery.  


Every sleep expert we spoke with highlighted that the symptoms of OSA often go unnoticed by the 


patient themselves. Many patients only go to the doctor for OSA because their bed partner can’t tolerate 


the patient’s snoring. The doctor often has to convince the patient that they have an “illness” at all: 


“A lot of times patients are very reluctant to go for a surgical option. Their perception is that it’s 


not a very high priority or concerning medical issue… So, the number of patients who agree, who 


even want to discuss surgical options, is fairly low.”
12





It really is that simple. Patients are unlikely to choose to undergo an invasive, expensive surgery with a 


cumbersome list of restrictions that must be followed for the rest of their life to fix a condition that 


generally doesn’t bother them very much.

Below is an excerpt of the long list of restrictions – just a few things an Inspire patient must think twice 


about having, doing, or being anywhere near for the rest of their life:13 


Restriction Inspire/FDA Guidance 


Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) You should not be exposed to Magnetic Resonance 


Imaging (MRI). Exposure to MRI can damage your 


stimulator or leads, cause serious injury, or result 


in unintended stimulation. This is the case even if 


you have had the stimulator removed and only the 


leads remain implanted. 


Pacemakers The electrical pulses from the Inspire system could 


affect the ability of the cardiac device to sense and 


respond to heart function as intended. This could 


result in serious injury. 


Mobile phones and other radio-frequency sources 


(tablet computers, AM/FM radios, cordless and 


conventional telephones): 


Keep these items at least 15 cm (6 in) away from the 


stimulator. 


Computer disk drives Keep the stimulator away from disk drives. 


Dental drills and ultrasonic probes These procedures may cause permanent damage to 


the stimulator, particularly if used in close proximity 


to the device 


Theft Detector or Security Screening Devices Use care when approaching theft detectors and 


security devices (such as those found in airports, 


libraries, department stores, and government 


buildings). ... If you must pass through the theft 


detector or security screening device, make sure your 


therapy is off. When walking through the device, keep 


as far from it as possible. Note: Some theft detectors 


might not be visible. Proceed through the security 


device. Do not linger near or lean on the security 


device. 


Handheld security wand Ask them not to hold the security wand near the 


stimulator longer than needed. 


Power tools Keep the motor away from the stimulator and leads. 


Electrolysis 








These procedures may cause permanent damage to the 


stimulator, particularly if used in close proximity to 


the device 


Laser procedures These procedures may cause permanent damage to the 


stimulator, particularly if used in close proximity to 


the device 


Psychotherapeutic procedures (for example, 


electroshock therapy) 


These procedures may cause permanent damage to the 


stimulator, particularly if used in close proximity to 


the device 


Radiation therapy These procedures may cause permanent damage to the 


stimulator, particularly if used in close proximity to 


the device 


Antennas of citizen band (CB) or ham radios could generate enough electromagnetic disturbance to 


potentially create unwanted stimulation from your 


stimulator. Avoid them if possible. 


Electric induction heaters could generate enough electromagnetic disturbance to 


potentially create unwanted stimulation from your 


stimulator. Avoid them if possible. 


Induction range Keep the stimulator away from the burners while the 


burners are turned on. Induction ranges, unlike 


conventional electric stoves, produce magnetic fields 


to generate heat.  


Large stereo speakers could generate enough electromagnetic disturbance to 


potentially create unwanted stimulation from your 


stimulator. Avoid them if possible. 


 
13 Guidance from Inspire’s Patient Manual – See the full list in Appendix G
Page 7 of 57 





Any one of those restrictions could be enough to deter a patient from an elective implant – all of these 


combined are absolutely ridiculous, in our opinion.  


Further, Inspire isn’t exactly a new option anymore. It has been commercially available in the U.S. for 5 


years and in Europe for 9 years. This is plenty of time to observe real-world adoption rates and use that 


data to estimate Inspire’s true commercial opportunity, rather than continuing to use the hypothetical 


dream-scenario TAM estimate Inspire’s management incessantly pushes on investors. However, if Inspire 


presented the abysmal real-world numbers, there may not be any investors left. 


Inspire can barely give its device away for free: 


The VA sleep doctor we spoke with told us that, even at no cost to the patient, less than 1% of VA CPAP 


users go on to try Inspire’s implant.14 We found data from the VA and DoD which supports these claims. 


It appears that Inspire’s sales to the VA peaked at ~1% of VA CPAP prescriptions in 2018 and are now 


declining. 


The VA Hospital System appears to be the optimal market for Inspire’s expensive implant: The VA 


covers all medical costs for ~9 million enrolled veterans. OSA is far more common for military personnel 


and veterans than the broader population. According to the VA, 20% of veterans have been diagnosed 


with OSA—compared with only 5% of civilians in the general population.15 For this reason, VA hospitals 


were early to try Inspire. The VA first approved the Inspire device for the treatment of OSA ~5 years 


ago.16 If Inspire can’t be successful in the VA hospital system, we don’t believe they will be successful 


anywhere. 


An OIG report on the VA’s use of CPAP machines shows that ~500,000 veterans were being treated with 


CPAP in 2017 and estimated that 699,000 veterans were being treated with CPAP in 2018, implying 


nearly 200,000 veterans were newly prescribed CPAP in 2018:17 





 
14 https://www.va.gov/health/aca/NonEnrolledVeterans.asp 
15 PR Newswire: Inspire Therapy Approved for OSA Patients at VA Hospitals 
16 Inspire’s therapy has a “weak for” recommendation as an OSA treatment. CPAP and educational/behavioral interventions 


carry “strong for” recommendations for treating OSA according to the table on p. 28 of the latest VA guidelines.  
17 The VA/OIG report did not state an exact number for FY2017, although the chart shows its approximately 500,000. The report 


does state the FY2018 number of 699,000. We used the lowest-end estimate of 150,000 to give Inspire every benefit of the doubt.

However, because the report doesn’t disclose the exact number for 2017 and the 2018 figure is “an 


estimate based on the average annual number of veterans served from October 2017 through May 2018,” 


we used what we believe to be the most favorable number possible for Inspire in the calculations below 


(150,000 new CPAPs in 2018).18  


In 2018, VA and Department of Defense (DoD) purchasing data show that a mere 150 patients were 


treated with Inspire’s implant. This means that the ratio of CPAP treatments to Inspire implants was ~1% 


in 2018. Further, Inspire’s sales to the VA peaked in 2018. VA purchasing data shows only 110 purchases 


from Inspire in 2019, a -26% year-over-year decline. Even if we generously assume that CPAP didn’t 


continue its 8-9% year-over-year growth between 2018 and 2019 and instead remained flat, these 110 


implants would only represent ~0.7% of new VA CPAP prescriptions.19 This data supports the VA 


clinicians’ statements that less than 1% of CPAP users at the VA go on to try Inspire’s surgical treatment.  


The chart below shows Inspire’s unit sales to the VA since its approval in 2014:20 





According to a senior clinician at the VA, patients ask about Inspire at VA clinics, prompted to do so by 


Inspire’s DTC marketing campaigns. However, when they hear it requires surgery, most simply walk 


away. One VA clinician made the following statement during our conversation with him: 


“I am skeptical that Inspire will take a large market share; people just do not want surgery.”

Inspire’s most mature market shows its future is bleak 


After nearly a decade of commercial availability in Germany, a wealthy country with a population of 83 


million that spends ~9% of its GDP on healthcare, Inspire only sold a meager ~300 units there in 2019.22 


A former Inspire employee told us the company’s early business-development strategy focused on 


Europe, at least in part because the regulatory approval process is less challenging than in the U.S. In 


Europe, medical devices need a “CE mark” before they can be sold. This designation only proves the 


device passes certain quality and safety standards, but says nothing about its efficacy. In this sense, it is 


easier to gain a “CE mark” approval in Europe than an FDA approval in the U.S. Inspire first received a 


CE mark in Europe in 2011, nearly a decade ago.23 


According to Inspire’s European website, there are 48 Inspire Sleep Clinics in Germany.24 The costs of 


the implant and procedure were covered in 113 hospitals under the NUB process of the German federal 


reimbursement agency in 2019.25 Given it has been available in Germany for nearly a decade, and the 


extensive service infrastructure Inspire has established there, Germany serves as an excellent example of 


what a mature market looks like for Inspire.

24 Inspiresleep.de 
25 INSP 2019 10-K, p. 22: “In Germany, the Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus, the German federal reimbursement 


agency, has granted the Neue Untersuchungs-und Behandlungsmethoden ("NUB") Status 1 coverage for our Inspire system. The 


NUB process allows for the introduction of new and innovative medical devices prior to reaching reimbursement eligibility and

2. Inspire’s Promotional Management Team Doesn’t Buy Their Own Bullshit: 


Although Inspire’s executives incessantly tout a market opportunity that implies they will grow the 


Company’s sales by 100x, their actions tell an entirely different story. With 99.2% of their purported 


TAM still in front of them, insiders have decreased their stake in the company from 45.54% to only 


4.94% today by selling 5,537,240 shares, cashing out more than $340 million, nearly 3x the company’s 


total revenue since the IPO, without ever buying a single share on the open market.  


It appears that management realized that the company would never be profitable, and the only way they 


could personally make money was to take Inspire public. While executives travel from conference to 


conference selling investors on Inspire’s unbelievable growth prospects, they cash out stock options as 


soon as they can. Management’s actions contradict their words. 


The chart below shows all open market purchases and sales by Inspire’s insiders since the expiration of 


its IPO lock-up period on October 31, 2018.
26


 In addition to the absence of a single insider purchase, it’s 


hard to miss the massive insider sales in early March 2020, when the stock was at its all-time-high, near 


$90. The vast majority of these sales were made by Chau Q. Khuong, an Inspire Director and Partner at 


Orbimed Advisors. He cashed out 1.5 million shares for ~$130 million just weeks before Inspire 


withdrew its 2020 guidance and executed a two million share secondary offering at $58.00, a discount of 


~35% to where Mr. Khuong cashed out.27  





The table below provides the details of Mr. Khuong’s well timed sales. These transactions decreased 


Khuong/OrbiMed’s remaining stake in Inspire to only 347,000 shares, a -86% decrease from the 


2,444,221 shares they owned when Inspire went public in May 2018.

10b5-1 plan which appears to ensure he doesn’t own any shares of Inspire stock by exercising options as 


they vest and selling them in the open market in the same transaction. Below is an example of a common 


transaction for Mr. Ban:28 





Notice in the Form 4 above, he exercised options for 10,000 shares at $1.14 each and immediately turned 


around and dumped them on the market between $85 and $88. Mr. Ban started selling just after the IPO 


lockup expired on October 31, 2018. Randy’s first sales were on November 19 and 20, 2018, when he 


sold a total of 10,000 shares at prices as low as $39.61. 


Of course, Ban and Khuong aren’t the only insiders that have been rapidly dumping their stock. CEO Tim 


Herbert is a habitual seller as well. He is the face and voice of Inspire – he seems to make a living 


promoting INSP stock at conferences then turning around and dumping 15-25k shares at a time.  


On May 22, 2019, CEO Tim Herbert made the following incredibly bold statement at the RBC Capital 


Markets Healthcare Conference: 


“Our ASP is $23,500 but for easy math that’s a $10 billion annual opportunity just in the United 


States. Okay, that's just a huge number, we don't look at it that way. We switch up, we look at it 


as from a bottoms up. How can we establish a number of centers and physicians to be able to 


treat this population. We know we have an unlimited number of patients that need the 


therapy.”

Just six days after making this outrageous claim, Mr. Herbert sold 25,000 shares for a quick ~$1.3 million 


payday. He’s not putting his money where his mouth is – he’s just putting it in his pocket. Herbert has 


pocketed nearly $16 million from stock sales since the IPO.  


Unfortunately, we couldn’t fit a table of all of Inspire’s insider sales on one page, so we had to put it in

Our investment thesis for Inspire: follow what management does, not what they say.
Page 13 of 57 





3. Inspire Exaggerates its TAM by ~50x: 


Our research shows that Inspire’s actual TAM is less than 2% of the $10 billion per year (500,000 units 


per year) TAM Inspire promotes. Inspire’s management mentions this figure repeatedly on earnings calls, 


at investor conferences and in company presentations as its key selling point for investors. We view this 


as a baseless claim derived from Inspire’s self-serving “company estimates” and misleading methodology 


that ignores important factors such as patient preference, competition and the abysmal real-world 


adoption rate in Inspire’s most mature markets. 


Inspire’s TAM Calculation Relies on “Company Estimates” and Ignores Key Constraints 


Inspire uses an unverifiable “company estimate” for the most critical assumption in its TAM calculation: 


the number of new CPAP prescriptions per year in the U.S. Inspire claims there are 2 million new CPAP 


prescriptions per year in the U.S. alone. However, data from an independent market research firm shows 


Inspire’s claim to be overstated by ~2.5x. Because patients must first try and reject CPAP treatment to be 


eligible for Inspire’s implant, the number of new CPAP users per year is the key assumption in 


calculating Inspire’s TAM.  


Most importantly, Inspire’s in-house TAM estimate completely ignores the effect of patient preference. 


Contrary to management’s delusions, this is an invasive surgical solution aimed at treating a condition 


that often has mild symptoms which patients generally aren’t willing to undergo surgery to treat. We 


adjust for this factor by looking at parts of the OSA market that have had access to Inspire’s device for as 


long as 9 years and therefore act as a guide for Inspire’s adoption rate in a mature market. This adjustment 


– which we’ll refer to as the “reality adjustment” – severely restricts Inspire’s actual commercial 


opportunity. 


Below we review the self-serving methodology and assumptions that Inspire uses to calculate its 


purported market opportunity and show that, even using its self-serving methodology, its TAM falls by 


~80% when we input verifiable, empirical data.
Page 14 of 57 





Below is the TAM slide from a February 2020 Inspire investor presentation. The most important assumption for this top-down TAM calculation is 


the number of adults with moderate to severe OSA prescribed CPAP prescription each year. Inspire claims this number is 2 million – their source? 


See footnote 2: “Company estimates” (i.e., “we made it up”)
Page 15 of 57 





Below is our calculation, employing the same approach, but using realistic and verifiable numbers: 





We still consider the above estimate to be highly optimistic because it entirely ignores patient choice, among other factors. However, we felt it was 


worth showing that simply using realistic estimates, Inspire’s best-case TAM falls by ~80%, to 104,125 units versus their claim of 500,000.  We 


elaborate on the numerous other flaws in Inspire’s methodology below.
Page 16 of 57 





Inspire’s “company estimate” of 2 million annual CPAP prescriptions is overstated by ~2.5x 


CPAP treatment numbers are the most important data point in Inspire’s TAM calculation because patients 


must reject CPAP before they can be a potential Inspire customer.30  Therefore, annual CPAP treatment 


numbers provide a starting point for Inspire’s top-down TAM calculation. 


We commissioned market research firm Frost & Sullivan to compile data and forward estimates for 


annual CPAP unit sales.31 They estimated 850,000 CPAP unit sales per year for the U.S. We used the 


high-end of the data for our estimate to give Inspire the benefit of the doubt. Even so, this crucial 


assumption is less than half of the 2 million new CPAP users per year in the U.S. that Inspire uses in its 


self-serving “company estimate.” Further, a 2018 Forbes article suggests a total CPAP population of 8 


million, growing at 8-9% a year. This would imply between 600k and 700k new CPAP prescriptions a 


year. 


Not all CPAP prescriptions are for the type of Sleep Apnea that Inspire “treats” 


CPAP is used to treat a broad spectrum of sleep-related breathing disorders, such as Central Sleep Apnea 


(“CSA”), which Inspire’s device can’t treat.32 By ignoring the fact that not all patients treated with CPAP 


are potential Inspire patients, Inspire further exaggerates its realistic TAM.  


For the sake of transparency, we have been unable to find an empirical estimate for the exact proportion 


of CPAP sales that are related to moderate/severe OSA, aside from our experts’ opinions. So, we gave 


Inspire the benefit of the doubt again on this point by not adjusting the market research firm’s annual 


CPAP sales figure down to account for new CPAP users with other conditions. 


Inspire appears to conflate total and annual data points to support its self-serving claims 


It appears that Inspire has conflated total data points with annual data points misleading investors and 


making their unrealistic annual market opportunity appear attainable.  


While six sleep experts we spoke to thought Inspire’s unsourced claim of 17 million total moderate to 


severe OSA cases in the U.S. was realistic, they all agreed that ~80% of those cases are undiagnosed. The 


symptoms of even “moderate to severe” OSA are often mild, so most people don’t even bother seeing a 


doctor about it. If 80% of the 17 million cases are undiagnosed, that implies a diagnosed population of 


~3.5 million Americans. Given a diagnosed population of ~3.5 million Americans, it is simply impossible 


for there to be 2 million new CPAP users each year. The entire population of CPAP users would need to 


turn over every 21 months for this to be true.  


Inspire’s estimate for “Anatomy Eligibility” ignores crucial constraints, such as BMI and age 


We conclude that anatomical eligibility reduces Inspire’s realistic TAM by at least 50%. The term 


“anatomically eligible” refers to the multitude of constraints on Inspire’s potential patient population, 


such as the type of sleep apnea the patient has, their BMI, their age and the severity of their OSA. In some 


cases, the way the patient’s airway collapses, such as “concentric collapse,” means Inspire’s implant will 


not work.33 


Inspire’s claim that only 30% of OSA patients who reject CPAP treatment will be “anatomy ineligible” is 


supported only by the hand-picked sample used in Inspire’s Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction 


(“STAR”)34 study, in which only 23% of the patients were rejected on the basis of anatomy ineligibility.

Page 17 of 57 





However, this was after heavy pre-screening for age, BMI and OSA severity that ensured most of the 


STAR study patients met the criteria for these constraints. Nonetheless, we gave Inspire the benefit of the 


doubt once again and used their assumption that 70% of patients will be anatomically eligible in our 


estimate presented above.  


According to Inspire-sponsored studies, their initial FDA approval, and an FDA patient manual for 


Inspire’s device, the efficacy of Inspire’s device declines above a BMI of 32. Among other reasons, the 


weight of a patient’s own flesh can mean that too great an electrical stimulation is required to move the 


tongue forward and open the airway without causing pain or disturbing sleep. This represents a massive 


constraint for Inspire’s commercial opportunity.35 





BMI alone reduces Inspire’s addressable market by more than 30%. Nearly 30% of the US population has 


a BMI of over 32. Furthermore, OSA prevalence correlates with BMI. A study published in 1993 in the 


New England Journal of Medicine concluded that one standard deviation increase in BMI resulted in a 


three-fold increase in the risk of sleep-disordered breathing.  


Age is also a major problem for Inspire. The likelihood that a person will suffer from OSA increases with 


age. A study by the American Thoracic Society provides the following figures for the prevalence of sleep 


apnea in adult men of various ages: 


• 3.2% prevalence in men 20-44 years old 


• 11.3% prevalence in men 45-64 years old 


• 18.1% prevalence in men 61-100 years old 


OSA prevalence increases with age, but so do the problems and risks of surgery. A sleep doctor we spoke 


with indicated that age is an important factor in whether he would recommend a surgical implant like 


Inspire: 


“And in general, the older we get the more medical problems we have so, nothing is really 


absolute as far as upper limit [with respect to patient age]. But in general, I would say the best 


candidates are probably in their forties and fifties.” 


The severity of the OSA and other factors such as neck girth, further reduce the addressable population, 


but all of these are ignored in the TAM calculation inspire presents to investors.

4. Cheaper, Less Invasive Competition is Growing Quickly: 
 


When Inspire was launched, it was not a new concept and it did not use game-changing technology. 


Medtronic had first tried hypoglossal nerve stimulation back in the late ‘90s. Their first patents were filed 


in 1998, nearly a decade before Inspire was spun off from Medtronic. Inspire’s CEO, Tim Herbert, acts 


obnoxiously confident about this perceived lack of competition: 


“So, we don't have competition -- it's not like we're grabbing market share. It’s our market to 


create. So this is the what keeps me up at night. It’s the question --  it's about how do we stay in 


control while we're growing fast.”
36





There are similar surgically implanted OSA treatments working towards FDA and Medicare approval, 


such as LivaNova’s “Aura 6000” device and Nyxoah’s “Genio System” which already received CE Mark 


approval in Europe. The introduction of direct competition will put pressure on Inspire’s ASP,37 and 


inherently reduce Inspire’s realistic commercial opportunity.38

Nyxoah: 


Nyxoah, a privately held Belgian company, is currently on the path for commercial launch in the U.S. It 


received CE approval in Europe during 2019. Nyxoah received an investment from ResMed in January 


2020. ResMed is the leading CPAP manufacturer globally. Their investment in Nyxoah provides it the 


sales infrastructure and FDA trial experience to quickly compete with Inspire and should be concerning 


for Inspire investors. The Nyxoah device is powered by an external battery pack, so it doesn’t require an 


additional surgery to replace the battery every 7 to 10 years. 


LivaNova: 


LivaNova is a mid-sized listed, profitable company, which owns a portfolio of products including a 


number of neurostimulation devices. It has extensive experience rolling out new neurostimulation devices 


and an existing sales infrastructure from its acquisition of Imthera last year. LivaNova is currently 


reconfirming trial results ahead of an FDA submission, which is expected to be made later this year.39 


In its 12 month pilot study, LivaNova’s patients saw a mean reduction in AHI of 53% after 12 months 


and a mean ODI reduction of around 50% - almost exactly the same as Inspire. The LivaNova device 


requires no DISE procedure ahead of implant, and does not rely on a chest-implanted sensor, so the 


surgery is less invasive. 


The table below compares Inspire’s results to its direct competitors:40,41 





Numerous non-invasive options already exist 


Oral appliance therapy is an effective, non-invasive treatment that fits easily into the patient’s lifestyle. 


They are completely non-invasive, easy to wear, comfortable, convenient and don’t come with a long list 


of restrictions or a $40,000+ price tag.  


The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (“AASM”) has approved oral appliance therapy (“OAT”) as a 


first line treatment for patients diagnosed with mild to moderate OSA. The AASM also recommends oral 


appliances for patients with severe OSA, who are unable to tolerate or cannot wear CPAP devices. 


Another option for people with severe OSA is combination therapy (wearing CPAP and an oral appliance 


together) to help reduce the pressure on a CPAP machine, making it more comfortable to use.42 


One of the sleep apnea experts we spoke to was shocked to hear Inspire’s TAM estimate and their 


promotional language. Her immediate reaction was: 


“In their literature, Inspire almost pretends that oral appliances don’t exist Oral appliances are 


a much better first choice. A dentist makes it for you, and ADA is cranking out dentists who make 


these.”
43





The American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (AADSM) says that there are over 100 oral appliances 


for sleep apnea that have received FDA approval. Oral appliances are essentially custom-fit mouthpieces

have the device fitted.44 


Numerous recent studies show patient compliance/adherence with oral devices is as high as 86% over a 3 


year period.45 Unlike Inspire, the bugs are worked out of them. One of the largest makers of oral 


appliances, SomnoDent/SomnoMed, has already treated over 400,000 patients. 


Below are a few of the oral appliances currently on the market:46 








Most importantly, oral appliances do not require surgery. Many are covered by Medicare and private 


health insurance – they don’t require separate dental plans. The Inspire device and surgery costs upwards 


of $40,000, while these oral appliances only cost between $5,000 and $10,000.

Appendix B – The Inspire Process: 


1. The patient first has to be diagnosed with sleep apnea, and then with obstructive sleep apnea. 


2. The patient has to undergo a sleep-study.  


3. The patient has to try CPAP, and then ultimately fail with CPAP either for insufficient effect or due to 


habitual noncompliance.  


4. The patient must have a drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) at a sleep lab, which involves general 


anesthetic and a team watching how the patient’s throat collapses during apnea events. 


5. Then the patient needs to be recommended for Inspire. Then evaluated for Inspire. Then approved for 


Inspire by their insurer. 


6. Then the patient needs to have the surgery, which requires full sedation and three 2.5-inch incisions.  


7. Then after three weeks there is a post-operative visit to check the incisions.  


8. Then the patient has to spend a month or so with the device implanted, but not yet ‘activated’. 


9. After that, the patient returns to a doctor for a full sleep study, to have the device turned on and given 


its initial programming. 


10. Then, after four months of using the device, the patient returns to a doctor for a further sleep study, to 


have the device programming ‘adjusted’. 


11. Then 60 days after that, the patient returns for even more re-programming. 


12. Then if all is well, the patient must undergo another sleep study. 


13. Then, though nothing in this life of rue can be certain, the patient may have to return periodically over 


the years for further program adjustments.  


14. Then at some point between 7 and 11 years, the patient will have to undergo another surgery to 


replace the battery in the device, which will have died by then, or sooner depending on use/adherence. 


Each of these steps of course requires an office visit, with the potential for a co-payment and follow-up 


bill for the portion not covered. Some of the visits will be to a sleep doctor, some to an ENT surgeon. 


After all of this, the device that is to be permanently implanted in your body until you die is covered 


by a ‘limited’ warranty for three whole years.

Page 26 of 57 





Event Date Event Description 


2020/01/07 PATIENT WENT TO THE HOSPITAL COMPLAINING OF PAIN AT SENSE LEAD SITE. 


HOSPITAL SUSPECTED INFECTION AND SURGEON OPENED THE SITE, DIAGNOSED 


A (B)(6) INFECTION, AND TREATED BY REMOVING FLUIDS AND PACKING THE 


SITE. REVISION SURGERY IS SCHEDULED. 


2019/12/11 PATIENT HAS INFECTION AT NECK INCISION ATTRIBUTED TO AN INGROWN HAIR. 


INFECTION WAS TREATED WITH KEFLEX AND BACTROBAN. 


2019/11/29 THE PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2019. PATIENT REPORTS RIGHT NECK 


PAIN AND STIFFNESS. THE PHYSICIAN SUSPECTS AN INFECTION AND STARTED 


TREATMENT WITH CLINDAMYCIN ON (B)(6) 2019. 


2019/11/21 A VESSEL WAS DAMAGED WHEN THE STIMULATION LEAD WAS IMPLANTED. THE 


VESSEL WAS REPAIRED INTRA-OPERATIVELY WITHOUT FURTHER ISSUE. AN 


ADDITIONAL INCISION WAS NEEDED TO REPAIR THE VESSEL. 


2019/11/18 PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED WITH THE INSPIRE SYSTEM ON (B)(6) 2019 AND 


DEVELOPED A SEROMA POST-OPERATIVELY. THE SEROMA WAS ASPIRATED AND 


THE PATIENT WAS PUT ON ANTIBIOTICS. THE LABS CAME BACK CLEAR OF 


INFECTION. THE SEROMA WAS RESOLVED AS OF (B)(6) 2019. 


2019/11/18 PATIENT EXPERIENCED INTERMITTENT SENSE LEAD PAIN SYMPTOMATIC OF 


INTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA. THE SURGEON REMOVED THE INSPIRE SYSTEM (B)(6) 


2019. 


2019/11/22 EROSION OF THE STIMULATION LEAD AT THE MANDIBLE. STIMULATION LEAD 


AND IPG SURGICALLY REMOVED (B)(6) 2019. 


2019/09/14 IN 2018 I HAD A DISE (DRUG-INDUCED SLEEP ENDOSCOPY) TO DETERMINE IF I 


WAS A GOOD CANDIDATE TO HAVE THE INSPIRE DEVICE IMPLANTED IN MY 


CHEST TO TREAT MY SLEEP APNEA. AFTER THE TEST, I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS 


AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MY TONGUE FALLS 


BACK WHEN I FALL ASLEEP BLOCKING MY AIRWAY. ON (B)(6) 2019, I HAD 


SURGERY TO HAVE THE INSPIRE DEVICE IMPLANTED. THEY ALSO CONNECTED A 


WIRE FROM THE NERVE OF MY TONGUE TO THE DEVICE AND A SENSOR WAS 


PLACED IN BETWEEN MY RIBS TO MONITOR MY BREATHING WHICH WAS ALSO 


CONNECTED TO THE DEVICE. I WAS THEN TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO HEAL FOR A 


MONTH BEFORE THEY COULD ACTIVATE THE DEVICE. AFTER A MONTH, IT WAS 


ACTIVATED. I WAS TOLD TO INCREASE THE INTENSITY EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS 


UNTIL IT WAS FELT TOO INTENSE, AND THEN TO STEP IT DOWN TO A 


COMFORTABLE LEVEL. FIRST I DISCOVERED THAT NO MATTER WHAT INTENSITY 


I USED, IT WAS NOT HELPING WITH MY SLEEP APNEA. I WAS SNORING AND 


CLEARLY STOP BREATHING SEVERAL TIMES PER HOUR, EACH NIGHT. I ALSO 


NOTICED THAT IT WAS CAUSING MY TONGUE TO ‘DOUBLE AND TRIPLE 


TRIGGER’, WHICH MEANS THE DEVICE WAS APPARENTLY BEING TOLD TO 


STIMULATE THE NERVE SEVERAL TIMES AT ONCE. STILL, MY DOCTOR WANTED 


ME TO HAVE A SLEEP STUDY TO PROPERLY TITRATE THE DEVICE. I HAD THE 


SLEEP STUDY (INSPIRE EMPLOYEES WERE PRESENT) AND UNFORTUNATELY, 


THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET IT TO PROPERLY WORK. IN FACT, THEY WERE 


CONCERNED THAT THE SENSOR THAT MONITORS MY BREATHING WAS NOT 


WORKING PROPERLY. AFTER THE SLEEP STUDY, I WENT TO SEE MY SLEEP 


DOCTOR AND THE INSPIRE TEAM WAS THERE TO CAPTURE DATA AND DO 


ADDITIONAL TESTING. AFTER TESTING, THEY DETERMINED THAT THE 


BREATHING SENSOR THAT WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY AND THEY 


RECOMMEND REVISION SURGERY TO REPLACE IT. THEY ALSO ASKED ME TO GET 


CHEST X-RAY. ON (B)(6) 2019 I HAD THE REVISION SURGERY. THEY DETERMINED 


THAT THE REASON THINGS WEREN’T WORKING PROPERLY WAS THAT THE 


CONNECTION FROM THE SENSOR TO THE ‘CAN’ HAD PARTIALLY 


DISCONNECTED. THE SURGEON RECONNECTED IT AND TESTED IT WHILE I WAS 


UNDER ANESTHESIA. WHEN I AWOKE, HE TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING WAS 


WORKING WELL AND I COULD IMMEDIATELY START USING THE DEVICE AGAIN. I
Page 27 of 57 





Event Date Event Description 


STARTED USING THE INSPIRE IMMEDIATELY AND BASED ON HOW I WAS 


FEELING AND THE FACT THAT MY WIFE SAID I WAS STILL SNORING, I KNEW IT 


WASN’T WORKING FOR ME. MY SLEEP DOCTOR HAD ‘ME’ GO FOR ANOTHER 


SLEEP STUDY TO PROPERLY TITRATE THE DEVICE. THEY SENT A TEAM FROM 


INSPIRE AGAIN, TO RUN THE SLEEP STUDY. WHEN I WOKE IN THE MORNING, THE 


INSPIRE PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT THEY WEREN’T SUCCESSFUL BUT WERE STILL 


CONFIDENT THAT WITH ADDITIONAL TUNING, IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. THEY 


SAID THAT THEY WOULD MAKE A PLAN WITH MY DOCTORS. ON (B)(6) 2019, I 


WENT TO MY SURGEON’S OFFICE AND WAS MET BY A TEAM FROM INSPIRE, MY 


SLEEP DOCTOR, AND A RADIOLOGIST WHO BROUGHT AN ULTRASOUND 


MACHINE. THE SURGEON PERFORMED AN ENDOSCOPY WHILE THE INSPIRE 


PEOPLE ACTIVATED THE DEVICE AT MULTIPLE INTENSITY LEVELS WHILE THE 


ULTRASOUND WAS POSITIONED UNDER MY CHIN. WHEN THEY WERE DONE, THE 


TEAM LEFT THE ROOM TO CONFER AND THEN CAME BACK POUT TO SPEAK WITH 


ME. THEY DETERMINED THAT MY PALATE WAS NOT MOVING FORWARD WHEN 


MY TONGUE WAS MOVING FORWARD (THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED A 


POSSIBILITY BEFORE I HAD THE INITIAL INTENSITY). THEY EXPLAINED THAT 


WITH MOST PEOPLE THE PALATE MOVES FORWARD WITH THE TONGUE AND 


BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY DIDN’T THINK IT WOULD WORK. HOWEVER, THEY 


STILL SET IT TO AN ‘OPTIMAL’ INTENSITY LEVEL AND ASKED FOR ME TO TRY IT 


ANOTHER 2 WEEKS. I BELIEVE I USED IT FOR A WEEK AND THEN CONTACTED MY 


DOCTOR TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I WAS EXHAUSTED AND THAT IT CLEARLY 


WAS NOT WORKING FOR ME. I LET HIM KNOW THAT THE INTENSITY LEVEL WAS 


SO HIGH THAT IT WAS WAKING ME SEVERAL TIMES PER HOUR THROUGHOUT 


THE NIGHT. WE AGREED THAT I SHOULD STOP USING IT AND HE WAS GOING TO 


DO SOME MORE RESEARCH. AT THAT TIME, I SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD JUST 


HAVE THE DEVICE REMOVED. I THEN WENT BACK TO CPAP. ABOUT A WEEK 


LATER, I HEARD FROM MY SLEEP DOCTOR. HE SAID THAT HE SPOKE WITH 


INSPIRE ASKED FOR ME TO GET A CHEST X-RAY TO SEE IF EVERYTHING LOOKED 


CORRECT AND CONNECTED. IT WAS. FDA SAFETY REPORT ID # (B)(4). 


2019/11/11 TWO WEEKS AFTER IMPLANT, THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH TWO LARGE 


HEMATOMAS AT THE CHIN AND IPG WITH CONSIDERABLE BRUISING ACROSS 


THEIR TORSO. THE PATIENT IS ON ANTICOAGULANTS, WHICH COULD NOT BE 


STOPPED DUE TO A HEART VALVE. THE PHYSICIAN DRAINED THE HEMATOMAS, 


AND PUT A DRAIN IN THE CHIN. THE PATIENT HAS BEEN ON ANTIBIOTICS SINCE 


IMPLANT, AND WILL CONTINUE. 


2019/10/28 AT ROUTINE POST-OP APPOINTMENT, THE PHYSICIAN NOTICED THAT THE 


PATIENT'S IPG SITE WAS RED AND SWOLLEN. THE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED 


ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT WHICH RESOLVED THE INFECTION. 


2020/02/07 STIMULATION LEAD MIGRATED OUT OF THE SKIN AT THE LEVEL OF THE 


MANDIBLE. A PROCEDURE WAS DONE TO RE-INSERT A 2 CM PORTION OF THE 


STIM LEAD THAT HAD EMERGED THROUGH INCISION DEHISCENCE. THE 


PHYSICIAN RE-INCISED THE NECK INCISION, CONFIRMED THERE WAS NO 


INFECTION, THEN TUCKED AND SUTURED THE EXPOSED LEAD SUB-


PLATISMALLY IN PLACE AFTER HEAVY IRRIGATION.

2019/08/07 THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED LOCALIZED SWELLING UNDER HER CHIN NEAR 


THROAT INCISION AFTER IMPLANT. SHE WAS SEEN BY THE HEALTHCARE 


PROVIDER AND WAS GIVEN ANTIBIOTICS (AMOX-CLAV GENERIC FOR 


AUGMENTIN). THE ISSUE IS NOW RESOLVED. 


2019/08/07 WHILE TUNNELING BETWEEN THE IPG AND THE NECK INCISION, THE 


PHYSICIAN HIT THE JUGULAR. THE PHYSICIAN REPAIRED THE VESSEL 


INTRAOPERATIVELY. 


2019/08/23 AFTER IMPLANT ON (B)(6) 2019, THE PATIENT DEVELOPED A RASH ON HIS CHEST 


MEDIAL TO THE DISTAL ASPECT OF THE SENSING LEAD INCISION. ALL THREE 


INCISIONS LOOKED GREAT AND THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT THINK THERE WAS 


ANY INFECTION BUT PRESCRIBED THE PATIENT A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS OUT 


OF PRECAUTION. 


2019/07/30 THE PATIENT HEARD A ‘POP’ AND THE IMPLANT BECAME MOBILE. IN A

INSPIRE SYSTEM WAS DISCOVERED RESULTING FROM TWIDDLER'S SYNDROME. 


THE IPG HAD BEEN FLIPPED +50 TIMES, CAUSING DAMAGE TO BOTH LEADS. THE 


PHYSICIAN REMOVED THE PROXIMAL SECTIONS OF THE LEADS AND RESECURED 


THE IPG IN THE POCKET FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE RE-IMPLANTATION. THE 


EXPLANT PROCEDURE TOOK PLACE ON (B)(6) 2019. I WALKED HER STEPPING UP 


WITH HER REMOTE. SHE GOT FROM LEVEL 6 TO 7. BUT SAYS IT WON’T GO 


HIGHER. THE UPPER LIMIT LIGHT ISN’T ON. I THINK SHE WAS JUST IMPATIENT 


AND NOT WAITING LONG ENOUGH TO CONNECT TO THE IPG, SINCE IT WENT UP 


ONE LEVEL AT FIRST. SHE NEEDS TO BE SEEN IN OFFICE. I DON’T THINK IT’S A 


REMOTE ISSUE. IT’S POSSIBLE IT’S JUST SOME LATER HEALING, BUT THERE 


MIGHT BE AN ISSUE.

Event Date Event Description 


2019/05/20 PATIENT REPORTS SEVERE NERVE PAIN RADIATING FROM HER NECK TO THE 


TOP OF HER HEAD AND MIGRAINE HEADACHES. THE PHYSICIAN REPORTS THAT 


THE PATIENT'S ISSUE IS NOT RELATED TO THE IMPLANT, BUT THAT SOME 


ASPECT OF THE PROCEDURE TRIGGERED THE PROBLEM AS THERE WAS NO 


HISTORY PRIOR AND SYMPTOMS STARTED IMMEDIATELY POST-OP IN THE 


RECOVERY ROOM WHEN SHE WAS COMING OUT OF ANESTHESIA. HER 


PHYSICIAN HAS NOT ACTIVATED HER DEVICE. THE PHYSICIAN REFERRED THE 


PATIENT TO A NEUROLOGIST WHO PRESCRIBED MULTIPLE MEDICATIONS FOR 


SYMPTOM RELIEF AND AN MRI. MRI RESULTS WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. 


NEITHER THE NEUROLOGIST NOR THE ENT FEELS THIS IS RELATED TO THE 


IMPLANT ITSELF, BUT POSSIBLY POSITIONING ON THE TABLE INJURED THE 


CERVICAL NERVE DURING THE PROCEDURE. 


2019/05/31 THE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH THE STIMULATION LEAD WIRE PARTIALLY 


EXTRUDED OUT OF THEIR SURGICAL INCISION. THE SURGEON EXAMINED THE 


LEAD UNDER A SCOPE TO ACCESS FOR ANY DAMAGE AND RAN PROGRAMMING

INTRAOPERATIVELY. 


2019/04/23 DURING THE IMPLANTATION OF THE INSPIRE STIMULATION LEAD, THE 


PATIENT'S EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN WAS LACERATED DURING TUNNELING. 


THE BLEEDING WAS NOT EASILY CONTROLLED AND MORE ADVANCED 


INTERVENTION WAS NEEDED. THE SURGEON MADE A SECONDARY INCISION 


APPROXIMATELY 5CM LONG AND 5CM BELOW THE PRIMARY STIMULATION 


LEAD INCISION. THIS ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE SOURCE OF THE BLEEDING 


AND HE WAS ABLE TO DELIVER THE PROPER INTERVENTION TO CONTROL 


THE BLEED. 


2019/04/22 THE PHYSICIAN REPLACED A PATIENT'S STIMULATION LEAD WHICH HAD BEEN 


IMPLANTED TOO SUPERFICIALLY. THE REVISION WAS SUCCESSFUL. 


2018/02/16 THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE INFORMED INSPIRE ON (B)(6) 2019 OF A PATIENT WHO 


HAD EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE EVENT IN (B)(6) 2018 WHEN THE PATIENT'S

WAS OVERSEWN WITH TWO LAYERS OF SUTURE. THE AREA WAS FLOODED WITH 


SALINE, ANESTHESIA PERFORMED VALSALVA WITHOUT ANY BUBBLES BEING 


SEEN. THE LEAD WAS THEN MOVED TO A DIFFERENT RIB SPACE SUCCESSFULLY. 


POST-OP CHEST X-RAY DID NOT SHOW PNEUMOTHORAX. THE PATIENT WAS 


CLINICALLY ASYMPTOMATIC AND DISCHARGED PER USUAL. 


2019/02/11 ON (B)(6) 2019, I HAD AN INSPIRE SLEEP DEVICE IMPLANTED TO HELP ME WITH 


MY SLEEP APNEA. AFTER SURGERY, I HAD TO WAIT A MONTH TO HEAL. I WENT 


TO THE DR ON (B)(6) 2019, FOR THEM TO TURN THE DEVICE ON AND START USING 


IT. VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I STARTED NOTICING PAIN IN MY RIB WHERE 


THEY PLACED THE SENSOR WHICH MONITORS MY BREATHING AND TELLS THE 


DEVICE WHEN TO STIMULATE MY TONGUE NERVE. SOMETHING (THEY THINK 


THE SENSOR) WAS TELLING THE DEVICE TO DELIVER STIMULATION 


INCORRECTLY. I WENT IN FOR FURTHER TESTS AND AM AWAITING THEIR CALL. 


HOWEVER, THEY SUSPECT THAT I WILL NEED A "REVISION" WHICH WILL 


REQUIRE THEM TO REPLACE THE DEVICE AND THE SENSOR BELOW. 


2019/02/22 THE PATIENT DESCRIBED RECENT PAIN AT THE INTERCOSTAL INCISION SITE. CT 


ORDERED BY IMPLANTING SURGEON AND POSSIBLE BREATHING SENSOR 


MIGRATION INTO PLEURAL SPACE. HARDWARE/EQUIPMENT IS FUNCTIONING AS

INTRAOPERATIVELY AND THE PATIENT WAS TOTALLY ASYMPTOMATIC, BUT 


VERY CLEAR SMALL PNEUMO ON POST-OP X-RAY. NO ADDITIONAL FOLLOW-UP 


OR INTERVENTION IS EXPECTED FROM THIS. 


2019/01/09 PATIENT EXPERIENCED UNINTENDED STIMULATION ON THE RIGYT SIDE OF 


THEIR NECK AND THORAX. 


2019/07/23 PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A PARTIALLY EXPOSED SENSOR LEAD AND A 


SWOLLEN IPG POCKET. THERE WAS INFECTION IN BOTH OF THESE SITES. 


PATIENT UNDERWENT SURGERY TO EXPLANT THE SENSOR LEAD AND IPG. 


THOROUGH IRRIGATION WAS USED TO CLEAN BOTH SITES AND THE 


INCISIONS WERE THEN CLOSED. THE EXPLANTED PRODUCT WAS SENT TO 


THE HOSPITALS PATHOLOGY LAB PER THEIR STANDARD OPERATING 


PROCEDURE. 


2018/04/18 DURING A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT THE PATIENT SHARED THAT HE HAS 


EXPERIENCED NAUSEA AND "VOMITTING" FOLLOWING HIS IMPLANT 


PROCEDURE. HE ALSO COMPLAINED OF PAIN AT THE IPG SITE WHICH WAS 


TENDER AND AT TIMES THE IPG CAN ANGLE UP IF PUSHED ON ACCIDENTALLY. 


THE PATIENT WAS INSTRUCTED TO SEE HIS PCP AND A GI DOCTOR. 


2018/12/13 PATIENT IS EXPERIENCING TRACTION ON THE STIMULATION LEAD. 


2018/12/17 PATIENT REPORTED THAT THE STIMULATION WAS PAINFUL AND THAT THERE 


WAS SWELLING IN THEIR TONGUE AN ON THEIR NECK. 


2018/12/05 THE PATIENT STATED THAT HE HAD NOTICED A LISP AFTER HIS IMPLANT 


SURGERY WHICH HAS IMPROVED WITH TIME. 


2018/12/05 PATIENT HAD 3MM'S OF FLUID ACCUMULATION UNDER NECK INCISION SITE OF 


THE STIMULATION LEAD AND A SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE. THE PHYSICIAN IT 


DRAINED THE FLUID AND CHECKED FOR INFECTION. THERAPY ACTIVATION 


DELAYED FOR ONE WEEK. THE ISSUE HAS RESOLVED. THERE WAS NO INFECTION 


AND NO ANTIBIOTICS WERE NEEDED. 


2018/11/27 PATIENT EXPERIENCED A PNEUMOTHORAX DURING THE IMPLANT WHICH WAS 


ADDRESSED DURING THAT PROCEDURE. PATIENT WAS MONITORED FOLLOWING 


IMPLANT AND IS DOING WELL.

Event Date Event Description 


2018/11/01 SURGEON INADVERTENTLY CUT THE DIGASTRIC TENDON DURING THE 


STIMULATION LEAD IMPLANTATION. THE TENDON WAS SURGICALLY REPAIRED 


DURING THE IMPLANT PROCEDURE. IMPLANT PROCEEDED WITHOUT FURTHER 


INCIDENT OR COMPLICATION. 


2018/10/15 PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED (B)(6) 2018 AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED AN 


INFECTION AT THE SENSING LEAD IMPLANT SITE. PATIENT HAS BEEN PUT ON 


ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT AND HAD THE ENTIRE INSPIRE SYSTEM EXPLANTED 


ON (B)(6) 2018. 


2018/09/27 AFTER THE IMPLANT SURGERY THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED SOME SWELLING AT 


THE INCISION SITE OF HIS STIMULATION LEAD. HE CALLED THE DOCTORS 


OFFICE AND THEY PRESCRIBED HIM AN ANTIBIOTIC WHICH RESOLVED ALL 


SWELLING AND IRRITATION. THE PATIENT ALSO HAD SOME WEAKNESS IN HIS 


LOWER RIGHT LIP BUT SAID IT WAS IMPROVING OVER TIME. AT THE PATIENT'S 


THERAPY ACTIVATION VISIT, THE DOCTOR DID A FUNCTIONAL TONGUE EXAM 


WHICH SHOWED NORMAL FUNCTION. THE PATIENT WAS ACTIVATED AND SENT 


HOME. 


2018/10/02 DURING A SURGICAL PROCEDURE UNRELATED TO INSPIRE THERAPY THE 


SURGEON OBSERVED THAT THE SENSING LEAD, IMPLANTED 2.5 YEARS EARLIER, 


WAS PLACED IN THE PLEURAL SPACE. THERE IS NO PATIENT INJURY AND THE 


THERAPY IS WORKING WELL, BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED 


A SELF HEALING PNEUMOTHORAX DURING THE IMPLANT PROCEDURE. 


2017/09/21 DURING TUNNELLING, PRIOR TO PLACEMENT OF THE SENSOR LEAD, PHYSICIAN 


WAS USING A MALLEABLE RIBBON RETRACTOR WHICH IS NOT AN INSPIRE 


PRODUCT. THE RETRACTOR WAS PLACED INTO THE INTERCOSTAL SPACE BUT 


PLANED SLIGHTLY BELOW THE INTERNAL INTERCOSTAL FIBERS. A SLIGHT 


NOISE WAS NOTED AND SOME SMALL BUBBLES WERE OBSERVED. CORRECTIVE 


MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO MANAGE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL 


PNEUMOTHORAX. NO LUNG COLLAPSE OR VOLUME CHANGE WAS NOTED AND 


ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THE SITUATION WAS STABLE THE SENSOR WAS 


PLACED AND THE CASE COMPLETED AS NORMAL. THE PATIENT WAS OBSERVED 


AND NO FURTHER COMPLICATIONS WERE NOTED. Manufacturer Narrative: THE 


PNEUMOTHORAX WAS CAUSED BY A SURGICAL TOOL CALLED A RIBBON 


RETRACTOR. THIS TOOL IS NOT MANUFACTURED BY INSPIRE MEDICAL SYSTEMS 


BUT SINCE IT CAUSED THE PNEUMOTHORAX WHILE BEING USED DURING AN 


INSPIRE IMPLANT PROCEDURE, SPECIFICALLY IN PREPARATION FOR 


PLACEMENT OF THE INSPIRE MODEL 4323 SENSING LEAD WE ARE FILING THIS 


MDR. 


2018/09/28 PATIENT SHOWED UP AT THE OFFICE WITH A SMALL BUMP ON HIS NECK. HE 


THOUGHT IT WAS A PIMPLE AND PICKED AT IT, BUT IT WAS A PART THE 


STIMULATION LEAD BELOW THE STIM INCISION. NO INFECTION, BUT PATIENT 


PUT ON ANTIBIOTICS AS A PRECAUTION. PATIENT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE OR 


AND THE SMALL AREA WAS OPENED UP, LEAD WAS REPOSITIONED UNDER THE 


PLATISMA AND SUTURED LOOSELY DOWN. AND THE INCISION CLOSED. 


2018/06/19 INITIAL REPORT WAS THAT PATIENT REQUIRED DEVICE SETTING ADJSUTMENTS 


BUT SUBSEQUENTLY IT WAS MADE KNOWN TO INSPIRE THAT ISSUES WITH 


SENSING  AND WAVEFORMS LED TO TWO REVISION SURGERIERS, ONE TO 


REPLACE THE SENSING LEAD (B)(6) 2018), AND THEN LATER (B)(6) 2018) THE IPG 


WAS REPLACED. THIS RESOLVED THE ISSUES AND THERE WAS NO PATIENT 


INJURY. Manufacturer Narrative: RETURNED PRODUCT ANALYSIS OF THE SENSING 


LEAD REVEALED THAT THE DIP CPAT INSULATION ON THE SENSE LEAD HAD 


BEEN CUT, POSSIBLY DURING IMPLANT PROCEDURE. THIS DAMAGE WOULD BE 


CONSISTENT WITH THE DEVICE ISSUES REPORTED.

AND HAS SCHEDULED AN EXPLANT PROCEDURE AS A RESULT. 


2018/10/01 DURING THE PATIENTS DEVICE CHECK VISIT, THE SLEEP TECH NOTICED THAT 


THE IPG INCISION WAS CRUSTED OVER AND WHEN THE PATIENT LAID DOWN, IT 


BROKE OPEN AND PUS CAME OUT. ALSO, THE SENSE LEAD INCISION WAS RED 


AND CRUSTED OVER AND LIKELY INFECTED AS WELL. THE ON-CALL PHYSICIAN 


SENT THE PATIENT HOME AND DIRECTED THE PATIENT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH 


THEIR PRIMARY PHYSICIAN THE NEXT DAY. 


2018/04/16 DURING THE IPG RE POSITIONING FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES, A BREACH IN THE 


SENSING LEAD INSULATION WAS NOTICED.  IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED DURING 


THIS INITIAL REVISION PROCEDURE. THERAPY WAS DISCONTINUED AND 


ANOTHER PROCEDURE WAS DONE TO REPLACE THE SENSING LEAD AND 


RESTORE THERAPY.  THIS RESOLVED THE ISSUE. 


2018/08/27 PATIENT EXPERIENCED PAIN/HEAT AND A SEROMA AT THE IPG INCISION SITE. 


PHYSICIAN ASPIRATED 5-7 CC OF FLUID FROM THE IPG SITE, AND STARTED 


ANTIBIOTICS.

REQUIRE MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS. 


2017/09/06 NO PATIENT INJURY, BUT PATIENT UNDERWENT A REVISION SURGERY TO 


REPLACE A SENSING LEAD. THE EXPLANTED LEAD WAS NOT RETURNED. 


HOWEVER ON (B)(6) 2018 AFTER REVIEWING THE RELATED INFORMATION 


PROVIDED THE LIKELY ROOT CAUSE LEADING TO THE NEED FOR A REVISION 


SURGERY WAS ELECTRICAL LEAKAGE DUE TO A N INSULATION BREACH. 


2017/12/13 NO PATIENT INJURY BUT THE SENSOR LEAD PRODUCED ABNORMAL 


WAVEFORMS. PATIENT CONTINUED TO USE THERAPY ANYWAY FOR A WHILE 


BUT EVENTUALLY HAD A REVISION PROCEDURE TO REPLACE THE SENSOR LEAD 


TO ADDRESS ELECTRICAL LEAKAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL LEAD. 


2018/08/22 PATIENT WAS EXPERIENCING PAIN DUE TO IPG POSITION. ON (B)(6) 2018 WE 


WERE INFORMED THAT PATIENT HAD THE IPG REPOSITIONED WHICH RESOLVED 


THE ISSUE.

INTERCOSTAL AREA NEAR THE SENSING LEAD AS WELL AS HEADACHES AND 


RESTLESS SLEEP. SHE ALSO STATED THAT WHEN SHE AWAKENS THAT SHE GETS 


3-4 QUICK PULSES FROM THE THERAPY. PATIENT WILL BE RETURNING TO THE 


CLINIC FOR A FOLLOW UP REGARDING THESE ISSUES. 


2018/08/09 PATIENT WAS ACTIVATED AND TONGUE MOTION WAS POSITIVE. SENSE AND 


FUNCTIONAL THRESHOLDS WERE CAPTURED. HOWEVER ABNORMAL 


IMPEDANCE VALUES WERE NOTED AND THERAPY ACTIVATION WAS 


POSTPONED. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY HOWEVER, UNUSUAL IMPEDANCE 


READINGS PROMPTED THE PHYSICIAN TO DO A REVISION SURGERY TO REPLACE 


THE SENSE LEAD ON (B)(6) 2018.

OF THE STIMULATION LEAD. THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL 


FOR THE HEMATOMA AND THE BLOOD THINNERS WERE DISCONTINUED FOR 72 


HRS AND HE WAS PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS. THE HEMATOMA LOOKED MUCH 


BETTER THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED. THE 


PATIENT WAS BROUGHT BACK IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER AND WAS DOING 


WELL. 


2018/04/27 NO DEVICE MALFUNCTION BUT PATIENT DEVELOPED A HEMOTOMA NEAR SITE 


OF SENSOR LEAD POST IMPLANT WHICH REQUIRED ANTIBIOTICS TO TREAT. 


EVENT FULLY RESOLVED. 


2018/03/08 THE PHYSICIAN HIT A BRANCH OF THE ANTERIOR JUGULAR VEIN WHILE 


USING THE CODMAN CATHETER PASSER TO TUNNEL THE STIMULATION 


LEAD DOWN INTO THE IPG POCKET. HE WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE 


BLEEDING THROUGH THE EXISTING INCISIONS AND HAD TO MAKE AN 


EXTRA 1 CM INCISION TO ACCESS THE VEIN AND STOP THE BLEEDING. 


POSTOPERATIVELY THE PATIENT HAD A NOSEBLEED IN THE PACU FROM 


INTUBATION, WAS HYPERTENSIVE AND THE MARGINAL MANDIBULAR BRANCH 


OF THE FACIAL NERVE WAS WEAK, LIKELY FROM RETRACTION. NO HEMATOMA. 


SHE WAS FINE WITH EXTRA 1 CM INCISION. LATER THE NEXT MORNING: NO 


NOSEBLEED OVERNIGHT, BLOOD PRESSURE BETTER, NO HEMATOMA, IN GOOD 


SPIRITS, RIGHT LOWER LIP WEAKNESS WILL BE FOLLOWED.

2017/02/27 SURGEON COMPLETED AN INSPIRE SYSTEM IMPLANT FOR A PATIENT AT (B)(6) 


MEDICAL CENTER ON (B)(6) 2017. DURING PREPARATION OF THE SENSOR LEAD 


LOCATION HE FELT THE RIBBON RETRACTOR PENETRATED NEAR THE PLEURA 


POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL INTERCOSTAL 


MUSCLES. HE HALTED PREPARATION OF THE SENSOR SPACE AND TOOK ACTION 


TO ASSES FOR POTENTIAL PNEUMOTHORAX. WITH ASSISTANCE FROM 


ANESTHESIA HE IRRIGATED THE INCISION SITE WHILE THE LUNGS WERE 


EXPANDED. A SMALL AMOUNT OF AIR BUBBLES WAS NOTED INITIALLY BUT 


RESOLVED UPON FURTHER TESTING. LUNG VOLUME REMAINED STABLE DURING 


TESTING AND AFTERWARD DURING SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENT OF THE SENSOR 


AND COMPLETION OF THE IMPLANT PROCEDURE. THE PATIENT REMAINED 


STABLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE CASE AND DURING TIME IN POST OP. THE 


PATIENT WAS KEPT OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION WHICH WAS PRE-PLANNED 


PRIOR TO THE CASE AND REMAINED ASYMPTOMATIC UPON DISCHARGE. 


OBSERVATION OF SURGEON AND INSPIRE PERSONNEL WAS THAT THE RIBBON 


RETRACTOR USED FOR THE CASE WAS MORE RIGID THAN THE RECOMMENDED 


RUGGLES AND MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEEPER PLANE. A RUGGLES 


RETRACTOR WAS USED DURING AN EARLIER CASE WITHOUT INCIDENT. 


Manufacturer Narrative: NO EVIDENCE OF DEVICE MALFUNCTION BUT USER ERROR 


MAY HAVE CAUSED A PNEUMOTHORAX. WHILE IT APPEARED TO RESOLVE 


DURING THE INITIAL IMPLANT PROCEDURE, THE PROCEDURE WAS PROLONGED 


AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE. DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED AND IN USE. 


2017/01/09 I DISCUSSED THE FEASIBILITY PATIENT WHO REPORTED A POTENTIAL IMPLANT-


RELATED INFECTION WITH THE DR. THE INVOLVED PATIENT HAD THE IPG 


REMOVED ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO DUE TO A COMPLAINT OF DISCOMFORT 


WITHOUT ANY INFECTION SIGNS. THE CURRENT INFECTION WAS REPORTED IN 


THE IPG POCKET AND SENSE LEAD AREA RECENTLY. THE SENSE LEAD REGION 


BECAME SENSITIVE AND SHOWED CLEAR SIGNS OF INFECTION AFTER THE 


ANTIBACTERIAL TREATMENT. THE SOURCE OF THE INFECTION IS UNKNOWN. 


THE DR. REMOVED THE SENSE LEAD TO ADDRESS THE INFECTION AND HAS 


SHIPPED THE EXPLANTED LEAD TO INSPIRE.

Event Date Event Description 


2016/12/08 THE PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2016. THE PATIENT WAS POST 


BILATERAL MASTECTOMY AND SUBSEQUENT RADIATION TREATMENT. THE 


RIGHT SIDE OF THE CHEST WALL DEMONSTRATED MORE THINNING OF THE SKIN 


AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUES THAN THE LEFT. THE IPG WAS PLACED IN A 


SUBCUTANEOUS POCKET ON THE LEFT SIDE, AND THE SKIN/SUBCUTANEOUS 


LAYER NOTED TO BE THIN. ON POSTOPERATIVE DAY SEVEN THE PATIENT 


PRESENTED FOR WOUND INSPECTION AND SUTURE REMOVAL. A PATCH OF 


CRUSTED SKIN 1 CM IN DIAMETER WAS NOTED AT THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF 


THE IMPLANT. OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS THIS AREA DECLARED ITSELF AS 


A FULL THICKNESS NECROSIS OF SKIN AND THE IMPLANT BECAME VISIBLE. THE 


DAY FOLLOWING THIS OBSERVATION THE PATIENT WAS BROUGHT TO SURGERY 


WHERE THE IPG POCKET WAS REOPENED, PURULENCE NOTED, AND THE 


IMPLANT REMOVED FROM THE WOUND WITH SENSING AND STIMULATION 


WIRES UNDISTURBED. THE POCKET WAS DEBRIDED OF GRANULATION AND 


CAPSULE TISSUE AND IRRIGATED WITH ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTION. THE UNIT WAS 


REPLACED INTO A SUB PECTORALIS MUSCLE POCKET AND SECURED AND THE 


WOUND SUTURED. POSTOPERATIVE COURSE WAS UNEVENTFUL. PATIENT WAS 


REFERRED TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND APPROPRIATE ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY 


INSTITUTED. IMPLANT ACTIVATION AND TITRATION WAS PERFORMED OVER 


THE ENSUING WEEKS AND PATIENT DID EXTREMELY WELL WITH UAS. ORAL 


ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY DISCONTINUED AFTER FOUR MONTHS AND TWO WEEKS 


LATER SKIN OVERLYING IMPLANT BECAME SWOLLEN AND RED AND SCANT 


DRAINAGE OCCURRED FROM SENSING LEAD INCISION SITE. PATIENT WAS 


PLACED BACK ON ANTIBIOTICS AND ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR 


EXPLANTATION ON (B)(6). ON DAY OF EXPLANT SURGERY NO EVIDENCE OF 


INFLAMMATION, PAIN, OR DRAINAGE. IPG POCKET WAS OPENED FIRST AND 


THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF INFECTION. SENSING LEAD INCISION WAS OPENED 


NEXT AND GRANULATION TISSUE AND PUS ENCOUNTERED OVERLYING THE 


WIRE LEADING TO THE SENSOR, BUT THIS AREA NOT CONTIGUOUS WITH THE 


IMPLANT POCKET. NECK WOUND OPENED LAST AND ACTIVATION LEAD/WIRE 


REMOVED WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF INFECTION. ALL WOUNDS WERE IRRIGATED 


WITH ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTION. INFECTED WOUND PACKED WITH MEDICATED 


GAUZE TO BE ADVANCED AND REMOVED. 


2016/11/18 MUCOSAL TEAR IN FLOOR OF THE MOUTH EITHER HAPPENING FROM THE BLUE 


NIM PROBE (ANOTHER MANUFACTURERS DEVICE) USED TO MONITOR 


GENIOHYOID OR FROM NERVE DISSECTION DUE TO CHALLENGING ANATOMY 


WHILE IMPLANTING THE MODEL 4063 STIMULATION LEAD. THE DOCTOR PLACED 


3 DISPOSABLE STITCHES IN THE FLOOR OF THE PATIENTS MOUTH AND SENT HIM 


HOME ON ANTIBIOTICS. Manufacturer Narrative: DEVICE IMPLANTED AND IN USE. 


2016/11/18 ON (B)(6) 2016 AN INSPIRE PATIENT, WHO HAD BEEN IMPLANTED 1 MONTH 


EARLIER, COMPLAINED OF PAIN AND INFLAMMATION AT THE IPG AND 


STIMULATION LEAD SITES. THIS PATIENT HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED KEFLEX 


POSTOP BUT DID NOT FOLLOW THE REGIMEN. THE DOCTOR DIRECTED THE 


PATIENT TO TAKE KELFLEX FOLLOWING PATIENT'S COMPLAINT OF 


INFLAMMATION, AND THE PATIENT BEGAN TO FEEL BETTER HOWEVER, ON 


(B)(6) THE PATIENT BEGAN LEAKING SEROMA FROM HER IPG SITE SO THE 


PHYSICIAN EXPLANTED THE SYSTEM. UPON EXPLANTING THE SYSTEM THE 


PHYSICIAN CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS INFECTION PRESENT AT BOTH THE 


IPG AND STIMULATION LEAD SITES. THE LIKELY CAUSE WAS DUE TO THE NEED 


FOR A MORE COMPLEX TUNNELLING ROUTE IN ORDER TO AVOID THE PATIENTS 


BREAST PROSTHESIS. Manufacturer Narrative: DEVICE NOT YET RETURNED FOR 


EVALUATION. DEVICE NOT YET RECEIVED AT MANUFACTURER.

Event Date Event Description 


2016/10/19 PATIENT PRESENTED AT DR.'S OFFICE WITH A GOLF BALL SIZE MASS NEAR THE 


SENSING LEAD INCISION. LOOKED A LITTLE SWOLLEN BUT THE SKIN WAS 


NORMAL. DR. SAID IT WAS FIRM AND MOBILE BUT NOT TENDER. PATIENT IS 


BEING BROUGHT BACK FOR AN ADDITIONAL DR VISIT AND FOR A CHECK TO 


ENSURE THE INSPIRE SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.PHYSICIAN AND 


PATIENT DECIDED TO HAVE THE MASS AND THE SENSING LEAD REMOVED. THE 


REMOVAL WENT WELL. UPON INSPECTION OF THE EXPLANTED LEAD WE COULD 


SEE A "NICK" NEAR THE FIXED ANCHOR THAT ENGINEERS HYPOTHESIZED WAS 


THE CAUSE OF THE MASS. ALL PATHOLOGY REPORTS WERE CLEAR NO SIGN OF 


INFECTION. PATIENT HAS SINCE BEEN SEEN BY ENT MULTIPLE TIMES AND 


HOPING TO GET SCHEDULED FOR REIMPLANTATION OF SENSING LEAD. 


2016/08/03 SURGEON NICKED THE PATIENT'S JUGULAR VEIN DURING THE IMPLANT 


SURGERY, SPECIFICALLY WHILE TUNNELLING IN PREPARATION FOR 


IMPLANT OF THE STIMULATION LEAD. THE SURGEON WAS ABEL TO STOP THE 


BLEEDING AND CONTINUED WITH THE IMPLANT OF THE SYSTEM. THE PATIENT 


IS DOING WELL AND IS RESPONDING NICELY TO THE THERAPY BUT THE 


PATIENTS SURGICAL PROCEDURE WAS PROLONGED BY 2.5 HOURS AS A RESULT 


THIS EVENT. Manufacturer Narrative: DEVICE NOT RETURNED TO MANUFACTURER. 


2016/08/19 NO PATIENT INJURY BUT PATIENT FELT THAT HIGHER STIMULATION SETTINGS 


WERE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE EFFICACY. AFTER TRYING DIFFERENT DEVICE 


SETTINGS, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT A SURGERY TO REPLACE HIS IPG AND 


LEADS. SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED PRODUCT NOTED THAT 


THERE HAD BEEN FLUID INGRESS IN TO THE SENSOR LEAD PORT ON THE IPG 


WHICH WAS THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF EFFICACY. 


2016/06/07 PATIENT EXPERIENCED SWELLING OF THEIR TONGUE AFTER USING THE 


THERAPY WHICH WOULD RESOLVED ON ITS OWN DURING THE DAY. PATIENT 


DID GO TO THE ER AT ONE POINT WHEN THEIR TONGUE SWELLED OVER 


CONCERNS THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DUE TO A STROKE, WHICH IT WAS 


DETERMINED THAT IT WASN'T. PATIENT HAD DEVICE SETTINGS ADJUSTED TO 


PERMIT A LOWER STIMULATION AMPLITUDE AT THE BOTTOM END OF HIS 


STIMULATION RANGE. Manufacturer Narrative: DEVICE STILL IMPLANTED AND IN 


USE. 


2016/06/05 THE PHYSICIAN CONFIRMED THAT THE PATIENT HAS AN INFECTION IN THE IPG 


DEVICE POCKET AND HAS DECIDED TO SCHEDULE A SURGICAL PROCEDURE TO 


REMOVE THE DEVICE AS A RESULT. Manufacturer Narrative: DEVICE STILL 


IMPLANTED, EXPLANT PROCEDURE. 


2016/04/19 PATIENT WAS NOT FEELING ANY STIMULATION FROM THE SYSTEM. THIS WAS 


ULTIMATELY RESOLVED BY ADJUSTING THE DEVICE SETTINGS, BUT PRIOR TO 


THIS THE PATIENT UNDERWENT AN EXTRA SURGICAL PROCEDURE TO 


DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE STIMULATION LEAD IMPLANT NEEDED TO 


BE REVISED. Manufacturer Narrative: DEVICE REMAINS IMPLANTED AND IN USE. 


2015/12/30 PNEUMOTHORAX OCCURRED ASSOCIATED WITH PLACEMENT OF SENSOR LEAD. 


CHEST TUBE PLACED TO TREAT PNEUMOTHORAX. REVISION PROCEDURE

Event Date Event Description 


2015/12/21 THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED EPISODES WHERE THE SYSTEM'S STIMULATION DID 


NOT WORK PROPERLY, SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD FEEL WEAKER THAN NORMAL. 


A CHECK OF THE SYSTEM SHOWED THAT THE PATIENT'S STIMULATION 


SENSATION THRESHOLD HAD NEARLY DOUBLED. THE SYSTEM WAS EXPLANTED 


AND A NEW SENSING LEAD AND IMPLANTABLE PULSE GENERATOR WERE 


IMPLANTED. THE EXPLANTED DEVICES WERE DECONTAMINATED, AND 


RETURNED TO THE MANUFACTURER WHERE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE 


SENSING LEAD HAD SHIFTED POSITION THRU THE MOVEABLE LEAD ANCHOR. 


THIS REDUCED THE SIZE OF THE LOOP BETWEEN THE TWO ANCHORS WHICH IS 


REQUIRED FOR STRAIN RELIEF. THE PATIENT WAS NOT INJURED AS A RESULT OF 


THIS INCIDENT, BUT IF THE EVENT WERE TO RECUR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT 


COULD LEAD TO INAPPROPRIATE STIMULATION THEREFORE THE 


MANUFACTURER IS FILING THIS REPORT. 


2015/06/12 TWO MONTHS AFTER IMPLANT THE PATIENT DEVELOPED A SMALL AREA OF 


GRANULATION/SUPERFICIAL INFECTION IN THE SENSOR WOUND. THE 


PHYSICIAN INITIALLY TREATED THE PATIENT WITH TOPICAL AND ORAL 


ANTIBIOTICS AND THEN ON (B)(6) 2015 EXPLANTED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THE 


EXPLANT PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITHOUT ISSUE. NO 


SIGN OF INFECTION WAS NOTED AT THE STIMULATION LEAD IMPLANT SITE 


HOWEVER SIGNS OF INFECTION WERE NOTED AT THE IPG AND SENSOR LEAD 


IMPLANT SITES. ALL INCISION SITES WERE THOROUGHLY IRRIGATED WITH 


ANTIBIOTIC LACED SALINE SOLUTION. THE ORIGIN OF THE INFECTION IS 


UNKNOWN. Manufacturer Narrative: MODEL 3024 NEUROSTIMULATOR SERIAL # (B)(4)

THREE REQUESTS FOR RETURN OF THE DEVICES FROM THE USER FACILITY 


HAVE BEEN MADE BUT USER FACILITY IS UNWILLING TO RETURN THEM. 


2015/04/09 ON (B)(6) 2015 INSPIRE BECAME AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING EVENT. A PT WHO 


WAS IMPLANTED WITH THE INSPIRE SYS ON (B)(6) 2015. ON (B)(6) PT CONTACTED 


HIS PHYSICIAN TO REPORT A HEMATOMA ON THEIR NECK AND AT THE IPG 


(IMPLANTABLE PULSE GENERATOR) INCISION SITE. THE EVENT WAS SURGICAL 


IN NATURE. NO ALLEGED PROD DEFICIENCIES, AND THE DEVICE WAS NOT 


EXPLANTED. GIVEN THAT THE PT WAS ON BLOOD THINNERS THE PHYSICIANS 


FELT IT WOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUES TO LEAVE THE HEMATOMA UNTREATED. 


CONSEQUENTLY THE PT WAS BROUGHT BACK IN SO THAT THE PHYSICIAN 


COULD CONDUCT AN EVACUATION OF THE HEMATOMA ON (B)(6) 2015 WHICH 


RESOLVED THE EVENT. 


2015/02/11 PT WAS IN THE IDE PIVOTAL STUDY FOR THE INSPIRE UPPER AIRWAY 


STIMULATION SYSTEM. RECENTLY HE CALLED HIS PHYSICIAN AND STATED 


THAT HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH HIS PT REMOTE, SPECIFICALLY THE PT 


WAS UNABLE TO TURN OFF HIS THERAPY SO THE STIMULATION CONTINUED TO 


ENGAGE THE TONGUE PROTRUSION MUSCLES. THE PT WAS EXPERIENCING 


DISCOMFORT SO RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THE THERAPY TO TIME OUT 


AUTOMATICALLY HE WENT TO THE CLINIC WHERE HIS PHYSICIAN TURNED OFF 


THE THERAPY USING HIS PROGRAMMER. THE PT STATED HE HAD MILD 


DISCOMFORT AFTER HAVING THE THERAPY OFF BUT NO OTHER INTERVENTION 


WAS NEEDED AND THE PT RETURNED HOME.

Appendix E – Customer Complaints 


Below is a table negative comments about Inspire’s device, primarily pulled from 2018 or 2019. The 


comments were posted on various sleep apnea boards and other internet fora, and are linked in the 


table. 


Verbatim Customer Complaint Source 


Here are the issues I’ve had with the procedure: *Lead wire/electrode between the 


stimulator under my chin and the generator in my chest is very prominent in 


appearance and looks very odd in my opinion. Very difficult to shave that area 


now which would not be your problem :) Overall it causes my entire neck area to 


look odd, when I raise my chin, it feels very taut it is quite unsettling. Also on 


several occasions the area under my chin feels like it is knotting up for some 


reason which is painful.  Generator planted in my chest wall is also very 


prominent and does not look good (Took away some muscle mass which I have 


not been able to regenerate with all types of exercise) not being able to have an 


MRI is also huge for me. I did not know I would have that limitation until after 


surgery :(  The actual sleep outcome results of using this technology has also been 


unsatisfactory for me. I was waking up more tired using Inspire that I was using a 


CPAP. Also it would cause my jaw to pop and my ears to ring after a night of 


using inspire. There were other issues as well but I won’t burden you with too 


many details. 


https://myapnea.org/f


orum/inspire-implant 


I had the Inspire device implanted almost 3 years ago and I've basically given up 


trying to use it. I wake up in the night and have to pause the unit (as designed) to 


go back to sleep. But when it comes back on, it comes on at therapeutic strength 


and is like an alarm clock going off in my mouth; it just keeps waking me back up 


and I always resort back to CPAP. I have repeatedly asked Inspire to modify their 


code to slowly ramp the stimulation up over several minutes so I will sleep right 


through the un-pausing but they have so far been unwilling to do so. In fact they 


have stopped following up with me all together. In my experience it does not work 


and is not yet ready for prime time.

It is surgery. They say its outpatient but I spent the night. I would not have wanted 


to go home that first day. Three incisions. One by your ribs, one below your 


collarbone and one on your neck. They are each about 2-3 inches long. The one by 


the ribs was the worst. Like a bruised rib.

I have been a snorer and a gasper for years. You are not alone! In fact, I’m still 


doing both, according to my husband, with the INSPIRE implant activated. I’m 


about to go back to square one, wearing CPAP while my hypoglossal nerve 


stimulator is taking my tongue out to the left corner of my mouth when I’m 


sleeping, and it is on. ...  Keeping my oxygen sats above 75 is tricky for me 


without the CPAP and Inspire together.

It was tolerable and actually he maxed out on the highest setting two weeks ago. 


He is still exhausted and has no energy. I can tell you that since I sleep right next 


to him his apnea has gotten worse ... the duration is longer with much more 


gasping. We have double checked the battery life and ensured that the device is on 


due to the issues explained...everything is AOK in that arena.

I have had the Inspire implant put in and recently had it removed. Long and short 


of it, I was NEVER a candidate for this IMPLANT my INSPIRE TRAINED 


SURGEON SHOULD HAVE KNOW THAT and INSPIRE SHOULD HAVE 


MADE SURE OF IT!!! I have professionals to back that up. Medicare has denied 


payment finding the provider liable for the cost of the $88,240.30 surgery. I've 


spent 2yrs of my life, dozens of appointments, I have very visible scars and for

But a few months ago it started to malfunction, turning off after about two hours 


each night, instead of the eight hours it should last. The Inspire representatives 


were very helpful, even sending a representative to meet with me and a doctor in 


Dallas (I live in Texas now, several hours from the nearest doctor who uses the 


device). They were unable to fix the problem with their device readers, so I was 


told that the implant would need to be replaced.

Victoria McCullough, 69, of Escondido, California, was one of the first to receive 


a pacemaker-like device that stimulates a nerve to push the tongue forward during 


sleep. Now, more than 3,000 people worldwide have received the Inspire implant. 


Infections and punctured lungs have been reported; the company says serious 


complications are rare. McCullough said she asked her doctor to remove the 


device soon after it was activated in 2015. "It was Frankenstein-ish. I didn't like it 


at all," McCullough said. "My tongue was just thrashing over my teeth."

So, my device was installed on 9/11/19 and turned on for the first time a month 


later. Everything went well during the activation, but I quickly realized that 


something wasn't right when I started to sleep. The device would give the initial 


stimulation with I turned it on with the remote, but then it would intermittently 


work throughout the night. I kept telling my rep what was happening, but he kept 


telling me that it was just my body getting adjusted to it. After a month of the 


device literally not working at night, my device was reprogrammed and on the first 


night, it was difficult to breath and I got severe pain to the side of my head every 


time the device would fire. So, it took a while to get seen again and last week I 


was reprogrammed, AGAIN. Now, it seems as though the device is "on" all night, 


but I feel as though the stimulation significantly decreases throughout the night, 


almost like a battery dying. It's always much stronger at the beginning of the 


night.

I was a good candidate so I went ahead with the surgery. It was about three hours 


long and the scarring was a bit more than I expected. My speech was slightly 


slurred for a few months but it returned to normal. There are three incisions. One 


just below the jaw line, one for the device itself just below my right clavicle, and a 


third one near the bottom of the rib cage on the right side as well. The incision 


near the rib cage was not fun for about a week (like a cracked rib).

Verbatim Customer Complaint Source 


Sep 26, 2019: Does anyone have the VA criteria for getting authorized to have the 


Inspire Sleep Apnea device implanted? ... I did a search on the site and only had 


one hit from 2016 - no one answered the questions then. ... - got a call back from 


the VA asking why I wanted to do this and questions about what the problems 


were with my CPAP - just wondering if there is any printed criteria as to who is 


allowed the procedure. 





Sep 26, 2019: Inspire is new and VA lags on new things. 





Nov 5, 2019: Called the VA to check on my referral request - apparently they 


denied my request - back on the 26th of September.

My husband had the Inspire device implanted two years ago, and it no longer 


works for him as a viable means to control his sleep apnea. He went in for a wet 


endoscopy a couple of weeks ago, so they could take a look at his throat while he 


was sleeping and the Dt’s are now telling him to go back on the CPAP again. He 


will likely go back into surgery to have the Inspire device removed in a few 


months. So not worth the surgery or expense for him to have this device 


implanted.

I dislike the feeling when it is turned on, I was told it is milder than what happens 


when you are asleep. Unfortunately, I feel the zaps in the middle of the night, I 


pause the remote, finally turning it off.

My experience was terrible. After the surgery and the consequential all the 


outcomes publicized on the Inspire website, plus all the information my doctor 


provided me, were not fulfilled at all. 


 First, before the surgery, my doctor described the surgery. According to him, he 


was going to insert the device by making two incisions; one on the right side of 


my chest, the other in my throat under my chin. After I came out of the surgery, I 


realized that the “incision” in my throat wasn’t a simple “incision”, it was a radical 


deep cut of about 4.5 inches, which until today (four months after the surgery) has 


not healed completely and it still painful. You should notice that on 


the Inspire website they never show a picture or a video of the patient’s right side 


where the cut has been performed. 


 Second, the doctor told me that I was going to be able to recuperate from the 


surgery in about 4 to 6 days after the surgery. This is not the case. It took more 


than two weeks for me to be able to go to work due to the intense pain and 


discomfort I experienced. My neck was extremely swollen (I can provide you with 


pictures) for about 4 weeks, the inflammation hasn’t yet disappeared completely 


after 4 months since the surgery. 


 Third, one month after the surgery, the doctor activated the device. He told me 


that it was going to take about one month to get used to the electric impulse that 


moves my tongue forward to open the airway during the time I am sleeping. That 


day, I found out for the first time that this device does not work by sending an 


electric impulse when you are having an apnea, but rather it constantly fires the 


electric impulse during all the time you are sleeping or trying to sleep. By doing 


this, you have to subject yourself to a constant electric shock sent to the 


hypoglossal nerve which moves your tongue forward. This electric shock is 


painful and excruciating, it is literally a torture, you cannot sleep at all 


while Inspire is doing “its job”. 


 Fourth, I went back to my doctor to see what I could do in order to find out how 


we could solve these issues. After going through this very painful and expensive 


surgery, I didn’t want to give up, I wanted this to work for me, I was desperate. 


The doctor decided to adjust the setting by lowering the intensity of the electric

shock. He told me that I should get used to this electric shock little by little and 


eventually I was going to be able to sleep with Inspire on. He also informed me 


that I had to increase the level of the intensity gradually (the device has 10 levels) 


all the way up to level 10, where level 10 is the only effective setting that makes 


the apneas less severe. I started with level one. After three weeks, I was able to 


reach level 3. At that point, I experience a severe symptom of vertigo that took me 


to the ER. Every doctor I saw at the ER thought that the reason for the vertigo was 


the use of this device. When I consulted with the doctor who implanted, he denied 


that there is a correlation between the use of Inspire and vertigo. At that point, I 


decided to stop using Inspire and wait until vertigo disappears. Three weeks after 


that, I used Inspire again; after three hours the vertigos came back. It was sad and 


disappointing that after going through all these suffering I had to give up 


using Inspire to solve my sleep apneas. 


I went through a lot of hurdles with my insurance company to have this device 


implanted. Cost me roughly $8,000.00 (with my annual max insurance 


deductible). I have severe sleep apnea. The device does not work for me at all. I’m 


very disappointed. I’ve reverted to a CPAP device. The Inspire device will be 


implanted in me for life but it doesn’t bother me…I just don’t activate it any 


longer.

I had Inspire implanted early 2017. First AHI decreased, than it went up. Couldnt 


sleep without medicatie due to voltage stimulation. Algorithm seems weird but 


they don’t like to admit. Didn’t loose weight as well which was the idea. Didn’t 


sleep better and couldn’t tolerate it well. I asked my doc to again allow me a 


CPAP which was strangely refused. Bought myself another CPAP and now ahi 


and sleep are back in control. I don’t recommend Inspire.

and had have had problems ever since every time I’ve gone back for them to do an 


adjustment to make it work right not only did they not fix the problem they charge 


me an extraordinary amount each time even though they said it was stuff they had

Here are the issues I’ve had with the procedure: (please note that I am a fit, 158 lb 


man) *Lead wire/electrode between the stimulator under my chin and the 


generator in my chest is very prominent in appearance and looks very odd in my 


opinion. Very difficult to shave that area now which would not be your problem :) 


Overall it causes my entire neck area to look odd, when I raise my chin, it feels 


very taut it is quite unsettling. Also on several occasions the area under my chin 


feels like it is knotting up for some reason which is painful. 


generator planted in my chest wall is also very prominent and does not look good 


(Took away some muscle mass which I have not been able to regenerate with all 


types of exercise) not being able to have an MRI is also huge for me. I did not 


know I would have that limitation until after surgery :( 


The rib cage sensor has not been a problem The actual sleep outcome results of 


using this technology has also been unsatisfactory for me. I was waking up more 


tired using Inspire that I was using a CPAP. Also it would cause my jaw to pop 


and my ears to ring after a night of using inspire. There were other issues as well 


but I won’t burden you with too many details. If you do wish to discuss further if 


you may feel free to call me at 205-254-0460.

I had mine done not long ago, I am at week six I believe. They tried to turn it on 


last week but as I discussed with my docs I am having problems with my tongue. 


The right half of my tongue is a different color and the muscle is relaxed and not 


working properly. When I stick my tongue out it now shoots over to the right. I 


believe I took some damage to a nerve and that is what is causing the issue. 


Hopefully it heals. They decided to keep the device turned off for another month 


or so to try and let me heal. Have your had any problems with your tongue? 





I also have a numb spot near my stomach on my ribs I fear I took some nerve 


damage causing that as well. All of my incisions are healing well though. Thank 


you for sharing your experience. I think I will eventually make a post detailing 


mine. If you don't mind answering, how painful was your throat incision? I think 


that was the worst part of my surgery. It wasn't terrible pain wise but it was more 


than advertised. Also where do you feel the tongue simulator? I feel the wire 


pulling well to the right of center, I figured it would be right in the middle. 





I guess that's another thing my throat wire is quite tight, I can't look up all the way 


and even have limited range of motion side to side. Have you experienced any of 


this? Again thanks for sharing!

Hi. I'm a sleep tech who has done a few Inspire titrations and maybe I can offer 


some insight into this decision you're about to make. 


... 


In my professional opinion, Inspire therapy should be the last option, failing 


everything else. It is a semi-permanent device that you put in your body and you 


will feel a bump on your chest where the body of the stimulator is placed, much 


like a pacemaker or a defibrillator. I've heard that Inspire is in the process of 


making MRI-safe devices, but I don't know if they've already been rolled out or 


are still being figured out. As previously mentioned by other redditors, they have a 


ten-year battery lifespan, and will have to be replaced. You will have to have a 


remote with you and if you lose it or break it, you can get another one sent to you 


under warranty or pay like some hundreds of dollars to get a new one. Your 


tongue may stick out slightly out of your open mouth with every breath or it may 


very well be completely extended out of your mouth. You may also have dry 


mouth in the morning which may require something like Biotene to solve.

Restriction Inspire Explanation 


Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) You should not be exposed to Magnetic 


Resonance Imaging (MRI). Exposure to MRI 


can damage your stimulator or leads, cause 


serious injury, or result in unintended 


stimulation. This is the case even if you have had 


the stimulator removed and only the leads 


remain implanted. 


Pacemakers The electrical pulses from the Inspire system 


could affect the ability of the cardiac device to 


sense and respond to heart function as intended. 


This could result in serious injury. 


Dental drills and ultrasonic probes These procedures may cause permanent damage 


to the stimulator, particularly if used in close 


proximity to the device 


Electrolysis 








These procedures may cause permanent damage 


to the stimulator, particularly if used in close

Devices 


Use care when approaching theft detectors and 


security devices (such as those found in airports, 


libraries, department stores, and government 


buildings). ... If you must pass through the theft 


detector or security screening device, make sure 


your therapy is off. When walking through the 


device, keep as far from it as possible. Note: Some 


theft detectors might not be visible. Proceed 


through the security device. Do not linger near or 


lean on the security device. 


Handheld security wand Ask them not to hold the security wand near the 


stimulator longer than needed. 


Mobile phones and other radio-


frequency sources (tablet computers, 


AM/FM radios, cordless and 


conventional telephones): 


Keep these items at least 15 cm (6 in) away from 


the stimulator. 


Computer disk drives Keep the stimulator away from disk drives. 


Power tools Keep the motor away from the stimulator and 


leads.
