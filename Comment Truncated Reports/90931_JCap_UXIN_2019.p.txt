 ‣ Overstated transaction volume: We believe that Uxin 


exaggerates the volume of auto sales processed by the com-
pany by as much as 40%.


 ‣ Undisclosed debt: Financial statements for Uxin’s operat-
ing companies in China show a staggering level of debt that 
puts the company at risk of collapse. The debt has not been 
reported to U.S. investors.


 ‣ Fake values: The price of cars sold is artificially elevated to 
raise loan values, which are sometimes twice the actual value 
of the car. This means that the loan collateral is far below 
what’s needed to cover defaults. We believe the elevated val-
ues have been used to obtain more debt than the company 
really needs, perhaps to enable insiders to take out cash. 
Management has pulled far more money out of the company 
than is justified by cash flows.


 ‣ Circular transactions: We have learned that Uxin’s se-
cret sauce for “revenue growth” is a special POS machine 
that embeds Uxin’s proprietary software and routs unrelated 
transactions through Uxin accounts. Evidence suggests that 
Uxin is counting these third-party transactions as its own 
revenue. Uxin has provided transaction subsidies to induce 
dealers to use the POS.

 ‣ Overstated inventory: We had software built that shows 
the number of unique automobiles management says are 
available for sale is overstated by half. Even the more mod-
est number of listings over-represents Uxin’s inventory. We 
conducted more than 40 interviews with dealers, former Uxin 
executives, and salespeople from competing companies, and 
all concurred that Uxin is basically a Craigslist of autos, listing 
cars that are being offered on multiple websites. For free.


 ‣ Siphoning cash: Uxin’s founder has taken about $280 mln 
out of the company by sleight of hand. Founder Dai Kun1 
could not even wait for the IPO before enriching himself: he 
took the first chunk of $100 mln before the company listed 
then got about $180 mln in December 2018, while the shares 
were still in lock-up. Two other insiders made about $270 mln 
in the same sale. This money did not come out of Uxin cash 
flows—far from it.


 ‣ Well-known in China as a cheat: Uxin’s truly awful pub-
lic reputation is well hidden from Western investors, but a 
simple search in Chinese turns up hundreds of news articles, 
blog posts, and lawsuits alleging that Uxin is a cheat. The 
company is absolutely plagued with consumer lawsuits and 
has been repeatedly reported to consumer watchdogs in the 
Chinese government for improper fees added to the loans it 
sells. 


 ‣ Sell: Uxin is so dishonest that we would not know how to 
attach a valuation. We urge Uxin shareholders to race to the 
exits.

Executive Summary
In the dark, fraud-infected world of used car sales in China, Uxin has man-
aged to sell its bill of goods not just to Chinese consumers but to U.S. pub-
lic markets. Detailed exposés have shown that all China’s online used-car 
dealers exaggerate. However, Uxin came up with the most sophisticated 
strategy to lie about its sales: it got auto dealers all over China to flush 
unrelated sales through Uxin’s accounts using a special Point of Sales (POS) 
machine. 


The fake revenue tool paid off nicely. Hemorrhaging cash, Uxin desper-
ately needed an IPO in 2018 simply to stay alive. Uxin achieved that debut 
on June 27 last year. The company garnered a valuation of about $2.7 bln 
despite just $290 mln in 2017 revenue and heavy losses. The only way to 
accomplish that was by reporting massive growth—and report growth it 
did. Uxin claimed on IPO that, from 2016 to 2017, its revenue increased by 
137% and transaction volume rose by 68%.


Before the shares even started trading, company founder Chris Dai Kun 
managed to capture $100 mln for himself. And before the IPO lock-up 
expired, he pulled off a sale that earned him another roughly $180 mln 
without needing to disclose a management sale to shareholders. It was a 
complex deal, done by apparently engineering a margin call on shares col-
lateralized to a company that is now deeply embroiled in a corruption scan-
dal. The strategy used for this share sale was, we believe, highly sugges-
tive of collusion with this Chinese financial institution, which is now under 
investigation for share manipulation and two of whose top executives have 
been arrested.


Uxin is an online marketplace for used cars, selling both to dealers and 
to individuals. It was founded in 2011 as an auction site for dealers, but 
the company found that it could add little value to these transactions and 
moved to the consumer market in early 2018. The company also pushed its 
lending business for second-hand cars, going from 38% of revenues from 
“loan facilitation” in 2016 to 55% in the most recent quarter.


Second-hand auto sales and financing are crowded fields in China, with 
at least nine well-financed competitors, including Guazi, Renren, the list-
ing site 58.com, and Yixin, which provides financing for second-hand cars. 
The company reported selling a total of 814,498 cars in 2018, which would 
represent as much as 59% of China’s online second-hand auto sales or 6% 
of China’s whole second-hand auto market—if the numbers were true.

Even in its reported financial statements—which omit huge liabilities--the 
company is in a perilous financial state. To try to persuade investors of its 
financial stability, in Q1 2019, Uxin basically relied on financial manipula-
tion. It decreased current assets and increased current liabilities. It reduced 
its advances to sellers by 24% and almost doubled the proportion of ad-
vances it takes from buyers, to 33% of revenue from 17% of revenue. Uxin 
also sold a bit of equity. As it is, with ¥801 mln in the bank and burning 
¥250-300 mln each quarter under the best of circumstances, the company 
will likely have to raise cash just to keep the lights on. 


Those already poor numbers were in the company’s report to investors. It 
also told investors that, at the end of 2017, before the IPO, the company 
had $75.7 mln in net debt (cash and near cash minus short- and long-
term borrowings). The Chinese financials tell a different story. On a non-
consolidated basis, at end 2017, those statements showed $1.76 bln in net 
debt.2 We believe this is undisclosed and not eliminated in consolidation. 
We obtained financial statements reported to Chinese tax authorities by 16 
of Uxin’s Chinese operating companies, including all those named as mate-
rial in Uxin disclosures. Companies with the largest assets and liabilities 
are wholly owned by Uxin, not Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). A single 
subsidiary, Kaifeng Financing Lease (Hangzhou) Co. Ltd., represents fully 


 2  We are using the 2017 balance sheet as an apples-to-apples comparison because Chinese 
financials are reported annually so we do not have quarterly statements to compare with Uxin’s. 
Although we have not consolidated financials of Uxin’s Chinese operating companies, only one 
company, Kaifeng Financing Lease, has borrowings in 2017, and that company’s payables and 
receivables do not suggest heavy inter-company transactions.

three-quarters of total liabilities across the 16 companies. Those liabilities 
cannot be consolidated away. Kaifeng’s Chinese financial statements show 
that Kaifeng had long-term borrowings of $2.05 bln in 2017 and $3.59 bln 
in 2018. 


The debt number likely stems from cars that Kaifeng is notionally renting 
to buyers, who receive ownership at the end of the lease period for ¥1, ac-
cording to a contract we viewed. Kaifeng appears to carry cars on its bal-
ance sheet purchased with cash from two shadow banks—something com-
pany management explicitly claims does not happen. Management says 
48% of cars financed by Uxin in 2018 were financed on a financial leasing 
basis.


Juicing revenues with a “billion-dollar” POS
A series of negative articles on Uxin published in early 2017 alleged that 
half of Uxin sales volumes were faked using “brushing” strategies.3 In 
March 2017, Tianxia News was one of many news outlets in China that 
published an article entitled “Brushing Is Almost Half: Financial Data for 
Uxin Second-Hand Auto Create Doubts.”4


But Uxin goes far beyond brushing: it came up with a way to generate 
circular “revenues” using a specially designed POS. The machine directs 
all receipts first to Uxin, regardless of whether the transaction was a Uxin 
sale or not. Uxin then pays the auto dealers and agents. The POS is simply 
a payment mechanism at dealers, like any machine to run credit or debit 
cards. Uxin may be responsible for 5% or 10% of sales at a participating 
dealer, but Uxin tries to capture the other 90-95% of sales by taking pay-
ment through the Uxin POS. We confirmed in eight interviews, including 
with a former Uxin financial manager, that Uxin counts as its own revenue 
dealer sales in which Uxin had no hand. For example, if a given dealer sells 
five cars a month via Uxin but sells 100 cars in total off the lot each month, 
the other 95 sales could be counted as Uxin’s revenue as long as they are 
processed using the Uxin POS.


Financial statements submitted to China’s tax authorities confirm our re-
search on the circular money flows through the POS: statements for 2018 
show that the company revised 2017 revenue numbers for two companies, 
Youzhen (Beijing) Business Consulting Co., Ltd. and Youfang (Beijing) 
Information Technology Co. Ltd., from ¥265 mln ($39.5 mln) originally

reported for 2017 to 0. The statements, obtained from financial authorities 
by Chinese attorneys, suggest that Uxin, once clear of the IPO, reported its 
actual rather than its pretend revenues.


Uxin incentivized dealers to adopt the POS by subsidizing the banking 
charges, which average 50-60 bps. This makes sense, given how much 
money Dai made from transacting in his stock—he needed investors to 
believe in growth, no matter what the cost. 


Our interviewees could not tell us how many Uxin POS machines are in the 
market, but a former finance manager for the company said “at least 5,000.” 


Initially, there was a trust problem: “When consumers used the POS, mon-
ey went into Uxin’s account,” said a former Uxin manager in an interview. 
“What if, by any chance, the company ran away with the money? Not only 
did the auto dealers have this concern, but even Uxin employees worried: 
we didn’t want to be working for nothing,” the manager said. [quotes are 
all translated from Chinese]


Uxin came up with an innovative solution: automatic redirection of funds 
to the appropriate account. Auto dealers and ex-Uxin financial managers 
told us that Uxin designed software to first wash funds through its own ac-
count then automatically route transactions to the designated recipient in 
a two-stage process. 


A former Uxin financial executive told us that Uxin wanted to get hold of 
transaction revenue “from all the car dealers in all of China and make it

Uxin’s.” This was to fool to investors into believing that Uxin’s transaction 
and sales volume were huge.


We interviewed a former Uxin executive who spent three years working 
in financial management for the company. That executive said: “When the 
consumer paid via the Uxin POS, the money would go into the Uxin ac-
count.”


The Uxin two-step POS scam has been documented in the Chinese press. 
“Uxin put its own POS machine in auto shops, and that allowed any trans-
action to go through Uxin’s books,” according to an article that appeared 
September 22, 2018 on a site called Twoeggz.5 Another article published 
in March 2017 reported: “Uxin fakes sales mainly in two ways. The first is 
that a dealer gives Uxin sales receipts and gets reimbursed, and the second 
is that Uxin places its own POS machines with dealers and any transaction 
can then go through Uxin.”6 Eight of our interviews with auto dealers and 
with current and former Uxin employees confirmed this. Said one manager 
for Uxin: “This policy was proposed by one of our vice presidents before we 
went public, and we had no choice but to promote it.”


A former executive of Uxin’s financial division justified the POS policy by 
saying that the machine was designed to collect data on all the transac-
tions in the second-hand auto market so that Uxin would have visibility 
into the market. But he said that “The transactions that really belong to

Uxin maybe represent about one-third of what Uxin reports.” In other 
words, Uxin could be overstating transaction revenue by two-thirds.


Uxin employees say that the price war among big payments companies like 
Alipay and Tenpay has made the Uxin POS less competitive, and Uxin POS 
penetration is declining.


Mine is mine, yours is mine
Interviewees at used car dealers told us that Uxin collects unrelated con-
tracts and car listings to claim as their own. 


On March 4, 2019, we interviewed a salesperson at the Jiading District Sec-
ond-Hand Auto Market in Shanghai, a market that cooperates with Uxin 
and uses its POS. At the end of the month, the e-commerce salespeople 
have to meet their quotas. “So they pay us fees and not only run fake sales 
through the POS but also collect contracts and legal receipts from us” to 
run through their accounts via the POS.


A salesperson at another second-hand auto market in Shanghai, inter-
viewed on March 5, said “We use the POS machine that Uxin provides to 
run sales through Uxin accounts, and we provide sales contracts and legal 
receipts to Uxin salespeople” so that they can claim these unrelated sales 
as their own. A salesperson at a second auto market in Shanghai said, us-
ing the POS “we ‘brush’ official and unofficial receipts to help the salespeo-
ple meet their sales targets.”


Two dealers told us that Uxin pays for the costs of fake transactions. “Uxin 
gives dealers subsidies of different levels,” said a large second-hand auto 
dealer in Shanghai. “The Uxin Finance Department typically books these 
as advertising costs or labor costs.”


We interviewed staff at several second-hand auto markets in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Shijiazhuang, and Chengdu. “Every loan salesman at Uxin has 
to issue at least five loans per month,” said one interviewee. “If they do not 
make this number, they pay the car dealers for some sales receipts to add 
to their sales results.” This manager said that auto dealers work with Uxin 
to create fake sales and are reimbursed for associated costs, like sales tax.


Transaction volume: overstatement of about 2x
In every part of its business, Uxin is lying about its scale. On the website, 
Uxin massively over-represents its coverage and its inventory of cars. The 
company claims to cover 900 cities and to have a goal of reaching 1,500 by 
year end. On the Q4 call, CEO Chris Dai Kun said: “First of all, we're ex-

that really belong 


to Uxin maybe

one-third of what

panding our - the sales network. Today, we cover 900, the region. And our 
aim at the end of the year, we want to coverage 1,500, the country level 
cities.” (Bloomberg transcript, Q4 2018 results)


We had a piece of software built that searches the Uxin website and cre-
ates an Excel entry for each car, which has a unique URL. Our team leaders 
are three of China’s top data scientists, who come out of China’s biggest 
internet companies and are well versed in techniques used by Alibaba, JD, 
Vipshop, and others to make their numbers look impressive to investors. 
The team that built the tool numbers around 30 people. We accessed 37.5 
mln pieces of data in the scraping process and downloaded the data to a 
massive spreadsheet that lists the cities covered by Uxin and lists the cars 
advertised as available in each city. We have high confidence in the sound-
ness of the software. It showed us that the site actually covers 399 cities, 
not the 900 the company claims. 


The software also demonstrated that the site overstates the inventory of 
cars. IR claims there are 200,000 unique listings. We verified 103,600 on 
March 18. The website itself offers a number of “available cars” in each 
locality, which add up to 35.09 mln. 


Here is a small sample from our data showing car listings across the top 
and cities along the left side.


The “1” indicates that a car appears in the listed city. If you look down the 
columns, you will see how each car listing is repeated in almost every city.


So Uxin is posting the same car hundreds of times on the different city 
sites, even though it may be logistically impractical to actually purchase 
the cars, since many are thousands of miles away.


Ask yourself this question: If I have 50 cars for sale in New York, but I have 
a website in every state, do I have 50 cars available or, as Uxin maintains, 
2,500?

Actually available? Maybe 50,000 cars
The company is pulling every lever it can to print numbers that look less 
bad. While most online players charge for listings, Uxin gives free listings 
to dealers to give the illusion of scale. That means that many of the cars 
Uxin lists as “available” are actually being sold by other companies or may 
not be available at all. Dealers estimate that as many as 40% of the listings 
are of cars not actually sold by Uxin. Some dealers list the same cars on 10 
different sites. 


 ‣ Redundant listings: The site displays cars for sale that are also 
offered on other websites. Dealers we spoke with said they posted 
inventory with Guazi, 58.com, Che168, Dafengche, and their own

websites. That means that a portion of the displayed inventory is sold 
by other sites, not by Uxin.  
Here is one of the several cross listings we found, of a 2017 Passat 
registered in August 2018, with 10,000 km on its odometer, listed on 
Uxin and Che168.


 ‣ Cars that have already been sold: The majority of cars are 
sourced from dealers, and the listings often persist on the site after 
the dealer has sold the car offline, according to the manager of one of 
China’s largest second-hand dealers, in Shanghai. “The ecommerce 
companies, in order to make their numbers look good, knowingly are 
not going to take down their car listings,” said this manager in an 
interview.

 ‣ Cars dealers have not authorized Uxin to sell: Uxin staff 
roam second-hand car markets and photograph cars on the lot with-
out authorization, say dealers. “There are cars that we dealers are 
not selling on the ecommerce platforms that the appraisers select 
and put on line. We can’t vouch for the timeliness or accuracy of that 
information,” the manager said. Another manager said: “In the past, 
these ecommerce salespeople and inspectors all day were wandering 
around our lot and trying their best to photograph and post every 
single car we have.” 


In total, we estimate that Uxin only really has 50-60% of the posted in-
ventory. A dealer we spoke with in Shanghai had this to say: “In order to 
make the numbers look pretty for investors, everyone [all the online used-
car dealers] is trying to think of a way to put inventory on their sites, while 
30% or even 40% of it is fake.”


Known cheat
Uxin’s strategies to create fake revenue are well known in China, hav-
ing been the subject of numerous blog posts and articles in the press. An

analysis that appeared in several outlets7 in early 2017 demonstrated that 
Uxin makes its inventory and turnover appear much bigger than they are 
by posting multiple photos of the same car, listing cars for sale that have 
already been sold, and taking photos of all the cars on a used car lot and 
posting them without authorization. The author of the post found that less 
than 5% of the cars listed for sale on the Uxin website were posted just 
once; most listings were repeated at least 20 times on different pages. Uxin 
also exaggerates the number of results for a search.


 “Take Beijing, for example,” says the author. “Uxin displays 62,475 as the 
number of available vehicles. Take the data from 300 pages. Each page 
displays 40 cars, which means there should be 12,000 independent cars 
on those pages. But the spider [the software code this developer wrote] 
scanned 300 pages and found they listed only 1,921 cars.”


Another set of stories demonstrated that Uxin misrepresented the number 
of cars it had on offer by posting duplicate listings and listing for-sale cars 
that had already been sold.8


Backing into the sales volume
The lower inventory suggests that actual sales transactions are much 
lower than Uxin claims. There are a few other ways to estimate what ac-
tual sales might be, and most of those ways bring us to conclude that Uxin 
is overstating sales volume by around 40-50%.

Reported transaction revenue
In our interviews, Uxin salespeople told us that service fee paid to Uxin as 
a commission for selling a car is generally between ¥2,000-3,000. But as 
calculated, the fee is much lower, suggesting that Uxin is exaggerating the 
number of cars it sells—the denominator. Uxin discloses transaction rev-
enue and number of cars sold to consumers. The calculated transaction fee 
based for 2018 based on these numbers was ¥1,304, suggesting that, even 
if we were to accept the transaction revenue as real, Uxin must be selling 
just half of the cars it reports selling. 


Number of cars sold per salesperson
As of mid-2018, the company reported 5,963 salespeople. In our interviews, 
Uxin employees said that the best sales staff could sell up to 10 cars per 
month, but that most averaged three to four sales per month. Assuming 
that each salesperson sells five cars per month, the company is able to sell 
357,780 cars in a year. But Uxin reported selling 814,498 cars in 2018. Of 
those, 319,672 were sold to dealers. Presumably, those sales require less 
sales participation. Nevertheless, the numbers suggest that Uxin may be 
overstating sales by 40-50%.


Buying own cars
We have confirmed with several former Uxin employees that Uxin itself 
purchases cars to resell. This is not disclosed in any filings we were able to 
locate. Employees estimated the owned cars at about 5% of inventory. We 
believe Uxin buys and resells cars in order to increase turnover. 


We visited a Uxin lot in the city of Shijiazhuang and found about 15 cars 
that we believe had been purchased by Uxin because they had been issued 
temporary plates. When a customer buys a car, the original plates are can-

Overstating car values 
Uxin appears to be intentionally overstating the value of cars in order to 
borrow more money. We are not certain who uses the extra loans, but we 
are sure that Uxin overstates its car values and overstates the amount of 
loans required. This dramatically raises the financial risk for Uxin, because

repossessing and selling the cars carried on its balance sheet would not 
cover the associated loan amounts. Although Uxin claims that it merely 
guarantees loans for “financing partners,” its financial leasing company, 
Kaifeng, has ¥24.1 bln in assets and an equal amount of loans, equivalent 
to 389,000 cars at China’s average used-car price of ¥62,246. IR confirmed 
to us that Uxin is on the hook for 100% of its loans.


Kaifeng management claims not to hold any cars on its balance sheet. But 
the evidence from Kaifeng’s balance sheet indicates this is simply not true. 
We obtained an actual Uxin contract from a salesperson and have seen con-
tracts excerpted in several lawsuits. The contract we obtained assigns the 
car as collateral to Kaifeng while the buyer retains ownership. In many of 
the lawsuits available online, cars purchased by consumers are registered 
to various Uxin subsidiaries, at least for an initial period.


This clause, from the “Counter-Guarantee Letter of Commitment” that 
forms part of the Uxin contract documents obtained by J Capital, reads 
“I hereby guarantee: 1) The collateral is owned by me, and providing the 
collateral to Kaifeng does not violate any third-party rights nor does the 


collateral have any defects affecting its current value; 2) I guarantee that 
before signing this guarantee agreement I have not established a collateral 
or guarantee for the collateral (other than with Kaifeng’s agreement)."


The patented inspection process is a fake
Uxin overvalues the cars through its inspection process. In promotional 
materials, Uxin says:


“Every vehicle on Uxin’s platform is vetted through a more than 
300-point vehicle inspection program, which provides an accurate 
assessment of the vehicle’s condition. Vehicles that have not been 
involved in major accidents and meet Uxin’s stringent quality stan-
dards receive the Uxin Certified accreditation and the industry-
leading warranty.”


The company has patented a device it uses to make video recordings of the 
cars that it compares with Google Glasses, saying that inspectors wear spe-
cial Uxin goggles that detect car defects as they record. We have not seen 
inspectors use these goggles though we have seen them use a handheld 
device that apparently detects defects in the body of the car from accidents.

A video of the inspection process is embedded here10.


But former company executives say that the inspection actually consists 
of “a visual inspection” plus an “inspection with a flashlight.” Hundreds 
of plaintiffs in lawsuits claim that Uxin sold them defective cars, failed to 
report that the car had been in an accident, changed the odometer, or even 
neglected to report a completely different engine in the car.


Four inspectors we interviewed said that the company told them that 
the car values needed to be higher in order to make company numbers 
look better to investors by raising transaction values and loan values. To 
achieve that result, Uxin changed its valuation process in late 2017 to 
prepare for the IPO. Some of the valuations, according to press reports 
and Uxin staff, are almost double the value that an inspector would as-
sign. A November 12, 2018 story on Sohu recounts the purchasing experi-
ence of a woman who bought a 2012 Highlander in Shenyang and found 
herself being charged for a higher loan amount than she had agreed to.11 
She released her chat record in which she tried to contest the charges with 
an attorney. “I made a down-payment of ¥80,000,” she said. The lawyer 
reviewing the sale documents responded, “They wrote that the down-pay-
ment was ¥40,000.” She added, “I borrowed ¥70,000 and they wrote down 
¥80,000.”


The company used to rely mostly on its inspectors to determine the value 
of a used car, but in late 2017, according to our interviews, “the company, 
not the assessor, determined the value.”


Several buyers claim that the 300-odd-point inspection of which Uxin 
is very proud is just for show.12 A lawsuit13 filed against Uxin’s Shanghai 
subsidiary, Yougu, in Hubei Province in January by a buyer named Hu 
Huanghuang alleges that Uxin sold him an Audi Q3 for ¥250,000 ($37,252) 
with an inspection certificate and a maintenance contract. However, the 
suit goes on, he discovered on driving the car that the engine had been

removed and replaced with cheaper parts. A 2018 lawsuit filed in Tianjin 
alleges that Uxin fraudulently issued an inspection certificate certifying 
that a car had not been in any serious accidents and facilitated a sale of the 
car for ¥86,000 ($12,806). Uxin was required to repay all charges, which 
amounted to ¥101,690 ($15,143), and to pay damages. A buyer filed suit 
in Liaoning in 2018, because she managed to verify that the car she pur-
chased on Uxin had had its odometer turned back.14 


According to a news report, a man purchased a second-hand car through 
Uxin for a little more than ¥100,000 ($14,891). After registering the car, he 
learned that, despite the multi-point inspection conducted by Uxin, the car 
had been in a serious accident and could not be driven. He said Uxin re-
fused to reimburse the buyer. He threatened to jump off a building if Uxin 
did not return his money. Two hours later, after a crowd had gathered, a 
Uxin representative arrived and told the man, named Ji, that the company 
would “take responsibility” and presumably repay him for the car.15


There are at least two reasons for overstating the car values: 


 ‣ Financing down-payments: Higher valuations allow Uxin to

finance down-payments for buyers who do not have a lot of money 
to put down. Banks lend 70-80% of the value of a car. On a ¥100,000 
car ($14,900), that would mean the buyer would need to come up 
with ¥20,000 ($2,980). But if the customer wants to put down just 
¥5,000, she must borrow ¥95,000. To do that, the car must be valued 
at ¥118,750. Banking rules would then allow Uxin to lend the cus-
tomer 80% of the “value” of the car, or ¥95,000. 


 ‣ Improved loan revenues: There is copious testimony in the 
Chinese press and in legal cases attesting to deceptive lending prac-
tices by Uxin that boost loan values. An article published on JRJ 
(“Finance Street”) on December 3, 2018 provides a description: A man 
in Ningbo purchased a used Cadillac and was encouraged to take a 
Uxin loan. Uxin added so many fees that the loan value was ¥248,500 
for a ¥168,000 car.16


Similarly, “on November 9, 2018, I bought a car from Uxin Second Hand 
Auto,” says a blog post carried on a site called “Fast Lane Complaints.” The 
car cost ¥60,000 ($8,940), and Uxin assessed it at ¥160,000 ($23,841) and

Loans,’” JRJ.com, December 3, 2018: http://money.jrj.com.cn/2018/12/03083025438871.shtml


Uxin guarantees 
100% of the car 


loans made by its 
shadow partners. 
That means that 


inflated values for 
the cars put Uxin 


at tremendous 
financial risk.

offered the buyer a loan of ¥140,000 ($20,861).


We sent investigators in posing as buyers to verify that Uxin requires cus-
tomers to make down-payments before reading a contract, something on-
line posters have complained about. That practice facilitates over-valuing 
the cars. 


Unreported debt
We obtained 2016-17 financial statements for Uxin’s direct subsidiary Kai-
feng Financing Lease (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd., a wholly owned Uxin subsid-
iary and the sole subsidiary of Uxin that is licensed to provide credit. That 
company has a mind-boggling ¥24.1 bln of debt on its books. In U.S. dollar 
terms, that’s $3.6 bln, more than twice the market capitalization of Uxin. 
The debt is not disclosed in U.S. financial statements.


Kaifeng is the principal engine of Uxin’s China business. Kaifeng owns the 
cars that Uxin finances and notionally leases them to the buyers. The com-
pany’s reports indicate that it carries loans collateralized by the cars whose 
sale it is facilitating. But if the value of the cars is significantly overstated, 
then the collateral coverage is inadequate. Hundreds of blog posts and 
news articles in China, like a post on 21cn17 and an article in Sohu news 
called “Uxin Loan Sharking: Cheating People Out of their Sweat-Money,” 
that claims interest of 50% of the price of the car,18 accuse Uxin of using 
deceptive practices to charge interest rates that compute to about 18% an-
nually. Lending practices that makes consumers feel cheated, when com-
bined with high interest rates, make the default risk especially high. 


Based on contracts we have viewed, we believe that Uxin takes the cars 
as collateral and technically owns them for the term of the “lease.” As of 
December 31, 2017, Kaifeng Financing carried ¥24.08 bln in borrowings 
and ¥24.14 bln in long-term assets. The assets should be cars held against 
customers’ payment of their loans. In its IPO prospectus, Uxin reports: “Cars 
purchased through our loan facilitation service are pledged as collateral 
to secure the loans.” We suspect that this massive debt facility might have 
been used to take money out of the country.


Uxin’s default risk is enormous. Kaifeng is already teetering on financial 
ruin. If the collateral—the cars—are as overvalued as evidence suggests, 
just a few defaults could send Kaifeng into insolvency.

We purchased a credit report on Kaifeng. That report showed delinquent 
loans for a business unrelated to what Uxin reports: “factoring for imported 
and exported cars.” A Chinese news article that appeared in 2015 did men-
tion that Kaifeng exports second-hand cars on behalf of Shenzhou, a large 
rental service provider.19


So Uxin is exporting or financing the export of used cars. It would be nice 
if investors knew about the risks this presents.


Weakening in 2019
We recently checked in with nine dealers—in Beijing, Shenzhen, Xian, Su-
zhou, and Shanghai—about their sales numbers through Uxin. Those who 
volunteered sales volumes for the current quarter all said that sales had 
declined in 2019. 


 ‣ A Shanghai dealer said: Last year we sold 8-10 cars per month 
through Uxin. This year, in January, we sold one, in February four, in 
March through the 27th, two. This dealer also said that his company 
offered the same inventory on 10 websites.


 ‣ A Xian dealer told us that they sold 193 cars through Uxin in 2016, 
207 in 2017, and 163 in 2018.


 ‣ Another Shanghai dealer said his company had sold 36 cars through 
Uxin in the second half of 2018 and has sold 13 in the first quarter of 
2019.


 ‣ A third Shanghai dealer has been listing on Uxin for a year but has 
not sold any cars.


 ‣ A fourth Shanghai dealer sold 63 cars through Uxin in 2018 and has 
sold nine in Q1 2019.

Many of the online auto dealers own offline second-hand car dealers, which 
enables them to purchase cars themselves if visible third-party sales num-

bers are low. Uxin is no exception: the company has an undisclosed 20% 
stake in the Beijing Lentuo Second Hand Auto Market. 


Lentuo’s 45% owner is the auto dealer Lentuo, a famously unsavory Chi-
nese reverse merger that was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 
2015 after failing to respond to multiple queries from the SEC. GeoInvesting 
found that Lentuo had failed to disclose ¥250 mln in related-party debt.


Lentuo announced the joint venture deal in 2014, saying that the JV would be-
come China’s biggest online-to-offline car dealer, but Uxin has never disclosed it.


The other owners are a subsidiary of the online auto dealer Bitauto (BITA) 
and Uxin, as well as another 5% owner. Buying and selling with this con-
nected dealer would make it possible for Uxin to generate its own sales by 
creating circular transactions. One of our Uxin interviewees did not spe-
cifically know whether Uxin transacts with Beijing Lentuo, but he said that 
the online sales platforms set up offline auto companies to generate trans-
actions and reduce taxes.


Hidden Insider Selling: How Dai Kun took $280 mln out of Uxin
Dai Kun took $280 mln out of Uxin immediately before and after IPO with-


out reporting an insider sale. He did it in two stages, first taking $100 mln 
via a loan repaid in shares and then taking another $180 mln with a “forced” 
margin sale. IR told us that management has never sold shares—techni-
cally true but not really true.

On first glance at the Uxin prospectus (see pages 173 to 176)20, it appears 
that Dai Kun received loans from Uxin to buy out shares in the company 
held by investment firms Bertelsmann and Amplewood. When examined 
closely, it is clear that Dai Kun used this loan arrangement as a smoke-
screen to take $100 mln in cash out of Uxin using share transfers in the 12 
months before IPO.


Dai Kun borrowed a total of $114 mln, including interest, from Uxin. This 
was revealed in correspondence with the SEC (see p 7)21. The first loan of $17.7 
mln in May 2015 was used to purchase two parcels of shares from Bertels-
mann and Amplewood. The second loan of $56.5 mln in July 2017 was used 
to pay $41 mln to Bertelsmann to purchase shares, while the remaining 
$18 mln was just cash to Dai Kun. Bertelsmann received $61.3 mln for the 
shares. Uxin paid the difference of $20.4 mln, and then the company record-
ed the payment as salary to Dai Kun (see Prospectus pages 122 and 173)22. 
The third and fourth loans to Dai Kun in July 2017 and May 2018, of $22.8 
mln and $10.7 mln, were just cash to Dai Kun; no shares were purchased.

Dai Kun repaid the loan on May 28, 2018, one month before the company’s 
June 27 IPO, by transferring 31 million shares valued at $3.68 each, for a 
total $114 mln (Prospectus p. 176)23.


Two weeks earlier, on May 14, 2018, Dai Kun had arranged for Uxin to grant 
him 17.7 mln shares at a cost of RMB589,631 to be recorded as compensation 
to him by the company when they vested (Prospectus p F-138)24. These shares 
vested on the day of the IPO (June 27) but in effect they replaced 17.7 mln of 
the shares redeemed in the transfer two weeks later (May 28) for a value of 
$65.3 mln. We estimate that the remaining 13.3 mln shares used in the trans-
fer cost Dai Kun $7.2 mln, based on the issue price of the Series A and Series C 
shares that were transferred.


Effectively, Dai Kun received $107.7 mln in cash from Uxin in loan principal 
forgiven with shares that cost him a total of $7.2 mln. This cash came out of a 
company that was losing massive amounts of money and borrowing heavily. 
Dai walked away with $100 mln in cash from the transactions just one month 
before IPO, when shareholders are normally subject to lock up. 


Stage 2: Netting $180 mln from a “forced” share sale
In October 2017, Dai Kun took out a $100 mln loan collateralized by 57 mln 
shares in Uxin, which he controlled via Kingkey New Era Auto Industry Limit-
ed, of which he owns 40%. The lender was a Chinese SOE listed in Hong Kong 
called China Huarong Asset Management Co., Ltd. (HK 2799), the largest dis-
tressed asset management company in China. Under the loan terms, receipts

from a share sale in excess of the money owed would go to Dai Kun. The docu-
ments outlining the loan and how it was used to seize the shares were filed by 
Uxin in an SC 13D filling25 on December 27, 2018. 


Huarong added a margin provision26 to the loan on September 28, 2018 that 
came into effect on December 1, 2018. The provision said that, should the 
share price fall below a certain LTV ratio for five consecutive trading days, 
then a margin call could be made. Dai Kun could then partly repay the loan, 
put up additional capital within two days, or surrender the shares. On the five 
trading days following the provision coming into effect, from December 3-7, 
2018, the LTV fell below that ratio, which we estimate was 1:2. Dai Kun was 
requested to pay up or provide further collateral. He did not, and the shares 
were seized on December 14, 2018 (see 13D p 10)27. 


Shares tripled in price on unusually high volume before the massive sale, 
causing Uxin to lose 21% in a single trading day and then to fall by 64% in 
two weeks , as Huarong sold out of its position. The average volume of shares 
sold was 800,000 per day in the seven months before December 1, 2018, fall-
ing even lower, to an average of 400,000, in November 2018. In December, 
however, the average daily trade was 9.6 mln shares, an increase of 24 times 
over November. While the stock price in the first few days of December was 
the lowest since listing, it climbed to an all-time high on December 19, around 
the time the lender started to sell. 


Uxin filed an SC13D disclosure on December 26, 2018, one week into the mas-
sive sale of shares, so shareholders had no warning. We estimate that two-
thirds of the 57 mln shares seized had been sold off before the disclosure. On 
the day of disclosure, the stock price fell 21%. No lock-up provision was at-
tached to this sale. 


The loan terms stated that, when the shares were seized for a margin call, 
they could all be sold, and any remaining funds after repayment of the $100 
mln would be returned to Dai Kun. The documents with all of this information 
outlined were filed by Uxin in an SC 13D filling28 on December 27, 2018. The 
windfall from that sale put roughly $180 mln into Dai Kun’s pocket, as we 
calculate below.

We believe Huarong started to sell the shares from December 19, 2018, 
shortly after it issued an instruction letter to Dai Kun. We estimate that 
up to 95% of those shares could have been sold before December 31, 
2018—China Huarong did not file an ownership statement for the quarter 
ending December 31, 2018. We further estimate all of the shares were 
sold off by end of January 2019, for a total yield of $449 mln, at an aver-
age price of $7.86 per share. That would have delivered Dai Kun roughly 
$180 mln in cash from the sale. Two other insiders that co-invested in 
Kingkey with Dai Kun,  also subject to IPO lock-up, were Chen Jiarong 
and Jimmy Ching-Hsin Chang. Under the same assumptions, they made 
$90 mln and $180 mln, respectively, from the sale. This activity also went 
unreported as insider sales. 


China Huarong is now embroiled in a corruption scandal. Its chairman 
was arrested and charged with corruption on November 7, 201829. The 
chairman of subsidiary Huarong Real Estate Co, which signed the loan 
with Dai Kun, was arrested and charged with corruption on January 22, 
201930. The corruption case against the two chairmen is based on manip-
ulating stocks in Hong Kong.

The timing of the margin call and share sale was the month after the first 
corruption case, and the share liquidation was completed before the sec-
ond. We do not think this was a coincidence. We believe it is just a matter 
of time before this loan and the corruption investigation are revealed to 
be related. Huarong, with its huge balance sheet, could easily manipulate 
trading in Uxin shares if it chose to. 


We believe the Uxin trading incident bears the hallmarks of collusion 
and could make Uxin the focus of investigators. The loan to Dai Kun was 
made in October 2017 by China Huarong Asset Management via Huarong 
Real Estate Co. and then another four entities before, ultimately, a spe-
cial-purpose BVI vehicle was used for the loan. The loan was made before 
Uxin was listed, meaning that the share collateral was not liquid. That is 
very unusual, first, because of the risk that an IPO would not occur. Sec-
ond, the shares used as collateral were not subject to lock-up. And third, 
the original loan did not include a margin provision. A margin provision 
was added on September 28, 2018 and came into effect on December 1, 
2018. 


If it turns out that Uxin had anything to do with abetting Huarong in the huge De-
cember sell-off, Uxin could be investigated in the related corruption case in China.

We believe that the Uxin edifice could collapse without warning with just a 
small rise in market delinquencies. A look at Uxin’s reported balance sheet 
betrays a company that is not only insolvent but careening toward default. 
Obligations are absolutely staggering—and undisclosed.


Uxin claims that it ended the bulk of its financial leasing business in 2015. 
As of year-end 2018, the company reported only $68.8 mln in financial 
lease receivables on the accounts reported to U.S. investors. Uxin reports 
that it merely facilitates loans from “financing partners.” The company 
claims that the only loans it carries on its own balance sheet are financial 
leases provided to dealers and loans to consumers that were originated 
before September 2015.


“In addition, prior to September 2015, we provided funds to con-
sumers in the form of financial lease agreements. We continue to 
provide loans through our Easy Loan program to selected dealers in 
the form of financial lease agreements to help finance their inven-
tory. In these arrangements, we are considered the loan originator 
and hold such loans on our balance sheet. We generate interest in-
come from these arrangements. Interest income is measured at am-
ortized cost using the effective interest method.” (page 118, 424B4)


But Uxin’s financial leasing subsidiary, Kaifeng, holds ¥24 bln in long-
term loans and ¥24 bln in “other receivables.” This is against sharehold-
ers’ equity of just ¥436 mln and cash of ¥2.19 bln. This debt has not been 
reported to U.S. shareholders. The most recent Uxin balance sheet, for the 
period ending December 31, 2018, reports long-term borrowings of ¥481.8 
mln and total liabilities of ¥4.97 bln.


Although the company says that it works with many lending companies, 
much of its business is through its financial leasing subsidiary, Kaifeng, as 
is amply proven by lawsuits and articles in the Chinese press. Kaifeng has 
67 branches around the country to help process its loans. That Kaifeng is 
the recipient of loan payments is also evident from many contracts filed as 
part of legal proceedings by customers who feel they have been cheated.


The company does not disclose enough to indicate where those borrowings 
come from. We purchased a credit report on Kaifeng from a subsidiary of 
the People’s Bank of China, and that report indicated that Kaifeng does not 
have bank debt despite the company’s report to China’s tax bureau indicat-
ing ¥24 bln in long-term borrowings. That could mean that the source of 
financing is shadow banks. The Kaifeng balance sheet, shown below in 
translation, reveals much more debt than the U.S. financials disclose.

Indeed, we know from interviews with Uxin salespeople that two shadow 
banks provide most of Uxin’s consumer loans: WeBank, which belongs to 
Tencent, and the less-known internet bank XWBank.31 Press reports also 
indicate that the company has sold asset-backed securities to raise money. 
In 2016 and 2017, Uxin was selling its ABS to the public on online plat-
forms such as zichan10032 (“100% assets”).


ABS is the preferred financing strategy of direct competitor Yixin Group 
(2858 HK). But Yixin fully reports its debt. And Yixin is profitable. In 2017, 
doing the exact same business, Yixin offered a better return on assets. Be-
low are Chinese 2017 financials for each of the company’s financial leasing 
subsidiaries.


Everything about Uxin suggests a company whose chief raison d’etre is 
to hoodwink investors as much as possible in order for a few people in 
management to make a bundle of money from selling highly priced stock. 
There is no reason for public investors to play along.
