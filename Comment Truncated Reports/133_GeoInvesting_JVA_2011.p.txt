Coffee Holdings: Overvalued at Current Prices

Non-recurring gains mask earnings decay; insiders now dumping at inflated prices


On July 15, 2011 we stated that we established a short position in shares of Coffee
Holdings (NASDAQ:JVA) at $22.30.


In response to the wild ride in the share price of JVA over the last four months (up 650%
from trough to peak), the GeoTeam decided to take a closer look. After careful research,
we have concluded that the company is dangerously overvalued at current prices.
The stock appears to have rallied as a result of what we suspect were unnoticed and
consider to be non-operating items in its fiscal 2011 quarterly earnings reports. These
items may have created the appearance of strong earnings growth when in fact it seems
apparent that core earnings are decaying. The following summarizes our obs.


Regarding earnings comparisons...


The stock surged in response to its 2Q 2011 earnings press release in which the company
reported apparent strong net income growth of 47% from the previous year's same
quarter.


To the contrary, for the same time period, if we remove the gains from the company's
earnings, as would be appropriate for unpredictable non-recurring items, the earnings
actually declined year over year by 37%. Repeat: they declined.


Regarding the use of options and futures contracts...


In their press releases, we believe that management failed to effectively communicate
to the market that the net income growth in both quarters was essentially entirely a result
of gains made through the purchase and sale of options and futures contracts to manage
the purchase of coffee.


In FY2008 and 2Q 2008, when JVA reported huge losses that created the (false)
appearance of a rapidly decaying business, the company very clearly communicated to
investors in its earnings press releases that the losses resulted specifically from non-
recurring losses on options and futures contracts. To quote the FY2008 earnings press
release:

We had a net loss of ($2,597,294), or ($0.47) per share (basic and diluted) for the
year ended October 31, 2008 compared to net income of $937,316 or $.17 per share
(basic and diluted) for the year ended October 31, 2007. The decrease in net income
primarily reflects hedging losses when the price of coffee surged to a ten year high
and subsequently collapsed during February and October 2008.


Now that the company has found itself in the reverse situation, with options and futures
contracts leading to non-recurring profits that have created the (false) appearance of
attractive earnings growth, the company has decided to say nothing in its earnings
press releases, paving the way for the stock to rally on hype and hot air. We find this lack
of clarity and consistency in press release disclosure to be both opportunistic and
troubling. Shame on management.


Regarding insider selling...


Even more troubling is the fact that management is now capitalizing on the stock’s
questionable price surge by dumping shares as the stock has rallied. On July 11th, the
CEO sold $3.37MM worth of shares in the open market at prices ranging from $23.01 to
$25.81.


As if that weren’t enough, on the same day, the Vice President sold another $3.36MM
worth of shares.


Regarding coffee prices...


Coffee prices are currently tapering off of an all-time 30 year high. Unless investors think
that coffee prices are going to infinity, then these gains are non-recurring.


Conclusion


If we apply an extremely generous P/E multiple of 30 to JVA’s trailing 12-month taxed
operating EPS of 0.217 (excluding gains from purchases and sales of options and futures
contracts, and applying a 36% tax rate), JVA's fair value would be $6.50. Given that...


the company’s year over year recurring earnings growth is negative,
management appears to be inconsistent in terms of what it emphasizes in press
releases, and
most importantly, insiders are dumping their shares on the open market,
