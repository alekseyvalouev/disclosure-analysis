Summary: SmileDirectClub (Nasdaq:SDC)
SmileDirectClub is a company that claims to be disrupting orthodontics with its
“teledentistry” platform and with its at-home ‘do it yourself’ model. We believe the
company is carelessly cutting corners in a �eld of specialized medicine, putting customer
safety at risk.
Alabama and Georgia dental boards have enacted rules that render some of the
company’s practices illegal. We expect more states will follow suit.
Major medical organizations like the American Dental Association and the American
Association of Orthodontists have alleged that SmileDirectClub puts patients in danger
and is practicing medicine illegally. They have �led complaints with the FTC, FDA, and at
least 36 state boards.
SmileDirectClub’s practices have earned it over 1,200 Better Business Bureau complaints
in just 5 years as a company. We communicated with one customer who was forced to
use wire cutters to remove SDC products after he struggled to breathe. Review sites are
replete with other horror stories of customers who had to take emergency dentistry into
their own hands.
While professional dentists o�er personalized care and comprehensive pre-screening, we
were told by a former SDC store manager that the company was sending 75 to 100 cases
to one orthodontist’s phone, per day, to “crank out” case decisions.
Instead of �xing its practices, the company has gone on a litigation spree to silence critics.
SDC has even required dissatis�ed customers to sign legal releases promising not to

complain to regulators or write bad online reviews, in exchange for refunds.
The Chairman/CEO sold the company his private plane a month before the IPO – and this
wasn’t even the �rst time he sold the company an interest in one of his private planes.
Insiders and a�liates cashed out almost $700 million of $1.27 billion in total net IPO
proceeds.
Financially, the company is another pro�tless, cash incinerating “unicorn” that we believe
has signi�cant added �nancial headwinds to face as a result of regulatory, legal and
customer satisfaction liabilities.
The company is trading at ~6.5x its revenue run-rate, an absurd multiple for a money-
losing consumer products company with no meaningful barriers to entry. Well-funded,
more responsible competitors are popping up left and right.
All told, we believe SmileDirectClub will wind up as a case study in why it’s a bad idea to
invest in a company that attempts to �t a complex, dangerous medical process onto a
low-cost, high volume assembly line.
We see downside of 70% purely on a valuation basis, and downside of 85% given the
above headwinds. We have a one-year price target of $2.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of
SmileDirectClub. This report represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own
due diligence. Please see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.


Part I: SmileDirectClub is Another Ugly IPO
That Has Somehow Avoided Even Basic Scrutiny


In a year �lled with busted and over-hyped Silicon Valley-backed IPOs, one company seems to
have somehow slipped through the cracks largely unnoticed.


SmileDirectClub (“SDC” or “SmileDirect”) IPO’d on September 12
(https://www.barrons.com/articles/smiledirectclub-ipo-�rst-trade-51568306975), pricing its
o�ering at a higher-than-expected $23 a share, giving the young company an $8.9 billion
valuation (https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/11/smiledirectclub-prices-ipo-at-23-per-share-
valuing-the-company-at-8point9-billion.html). Since then, the stock has dropped over 40% and
now trades at a ~$5.2 billion valuation. From here, we expect the stock will be further cut in
half several times over the next 6 to 12 months.


SmileDirectClub is a company that’s existence seems largely predicated on its ability to provide
customers a lower-cost clear aligner treatment that meets the level of care of traditional
orthodontics. Our investigation discovered evidence suggesting its level of care is not even
close to the standard.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 3/46


We believe that SmileDirectClub is putting customer safety at risk, potentially practicing
medicine without proper licensing, and could end up as one of the worst consumer blowback
stories in recent memory.


Once the market realizes the above, in conjunction with the company’s �nancial and
governance issues, we expect SmileDirectClub will reprice signi�cantly lower and will be subject
to long overdue scrutiny from investors, analysts and the press.


About Our Investigation


During our investigation into SmileDirectClub, we spoke with multiple former employees,
competitors, and customers. We reviewed the company’s SEC �lings and numerous court
�lings, visited one of the company’s “Smile Shop” locations in New York City, and corresponded
with dentists and orthodontists.


Background: A Brief History of SmileDirectClub And Its
Product


SmileDirectClub was founded in 2014 with a simple approach: o�er inexpensive clear teeth
aligners by cutting out expensive and time-consuming elements of the process.


The company’s approach claims that it requires zero meetings with dentists or orthodontists,
instead replacing them with a “teledentistry” platform.

)


Users take their own dental impressions at home via a do-it-yourself kit or go to one of several
hundred brick and mortar “Smile Shops” where their mouths are scanned by “Smile Guides”.


Once approved, clear aligners are sent by mail to customers who then undergo 5-10 month
treatment plans (https://smiledirectclub.com/?&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuNbsBRC-
ARIsAAzITueJ95Wc_KXAXaC5etnFbIwLQXzDkUkNru0ToFREWAx5OtPsLhQx3_waApowEALw_wcB
&gclsrc=aw.ds). The customers can communicate questions and issues through SmileDirect’s
customer service platform and the company’s “Dental Team
(https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/)” along the way.


SmileDirect was backed by some of Silicon Valley’s most notable VCs, including Kleiner Perkins
(https://www.cdr-inc.com/news/press-release/smiledirectclub-announces-380-million-equity-
private-placement-3.2-billion). In just 5 short years, the company has gone from startup to
multi-billion-dollar public company by employing its “disruptive” approach to specialized
medicine.


Background: SmileDirect’s Goal of “Disrupting” The
Traditional Orthodontic Model Seems to Largely Rely on
Dangerous Corner-Cutting


We think SmileDirectClub is an ongoing case study in precisely why the best practices of the
traditional dentistry model exist to begin with.


Throughout the course of our research, dentists and orthodontists were unanimous in telling
us that SDC was missing the most vital parts of any orthodontic treatment, which include a
comprehensive pre-screening and evaluation for complex legacy dental issues, professionally
performed molds and/or scans, as well as continuing personalized care from a licensed
professional.


During our research, we came across “Do It Yourself” dental horror stories, allegations of
practicing medicine without licenses, dental emergencies in the company’s “Smile Shops” and
lawsuits – all of which we believe will help put the world – and the public markets – on notice
about SDC’s questionable approach.

Reality Check: State Regulators and Major Medical
Organizations Have Begun to Declare the Company’s
Practices Illegal


Several state dental boards have recently clamped down on SmileDirectClub with rules that
render certain of the company’s practices illegal. Major medical organizations have also come
out swinging with complaints targeted directly at the company:


Alabama. The Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama found that SmileDirect’s practice of
taking pictures of teeth for the purposes of creating dental products constituted the
unlicensed practice of dentistry. (Pg. 2
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Dzq4rQJdNuAmzm)) SmileDirect �led suit against the
board, with most of its claims dismissed in April (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-
releases/federal-court-throws-out-six-of-smiledirectclubs-eleven-counts-against-the-
alabama-dental-board-300834293.html).
Georgia. The Georgia Board of Dentistry clamped down on SmileDirect
(https://dentistrytoday.com/news/industrynews/item/4822-federal-court-�nds-that-
digital-scanning-constitutes-the-practice-of-dentistry) with a rule that targeted the
company’s practice of allowing dental assistants to take digital scans of customer’s
mouths without any direct supervision from a licensed dentist. SmileDirect �led suit, but
most of its claims were dismissed in May (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-
releases/federal-court-dismisses-a-majority-of-smiledirectclubs-claims-and-�nds-that-
smiledirectclubs-digital-scans-constitute-the-practice-of-dentistry-300850327.html).
36 State Complaints have been �led against (https://www.aaoinfo.org/_/1-press-room/)
SmileDirect by state a�liates of the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) alleging,
in a substantiated fashion, that SmileDirect is illegally operating as a dentist without
proper licensing in the subject states. See example here
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Maajh8OXtPEpZN).
FDA (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Fb6MHOigKskeic) and FTC
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/r5Wth2awFRTss4) Complaints have been �led by
the American Dental Association alleging that
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/cMSW7zDYrbw1UA) SmileDirect is “placing the public
at risk” and alleging “false and misleading claims (that) constitute unfair and deceptive
practices.”


In response to the industry pushback, SmileDirect’s CFO retorted in a recent Forbes interview
(https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurendebter/2019/09/11/smiledirectclub-ipo/#79d7401c6aca)
by saying:

that.”

Reality Check: In Just Five Years as a Company, SDC Has
Amassed 1,200 Better Business Bureau Complaints and a
Damning New Class Action Lawsuit


In addition to regulators, the company seems to be getting pushback from another important
constituency—its customers. A review of the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website for
SmileDirectClub shows over 1,200 customer complaints
(https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/nashville/pro�le/cosmetic-dentistry/smiledirectclub-0573-
37111672/complaints) as of this writing, for a company that is only 5 years old!


Just last week, a major lawsuit seeking class action status was �led
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/cMSW7zDYrbw1UA) against the company on behalf of
customers and orthodontists/dentists.


Among its allegations, the lawsuit references “thousands of substantiated, serious customer
complaints” and provides several examples (emphasis added):


“Product made my teeth worse with spacing and gaps…After �ve months and four
aligners and a crack tooth and numerous attempts to talk to customer service to �x
my issues all of which led nowhere.”


“Please don’t do this yourself—especially if you’re just trying to save money…my
crown and implant- which was super expensive to get done- came o�
altogether.”


Similar complaints are ubiquitous across Facebook groups (1

(https://www.facebook.com/groups/404102996597815),3

customers share their stories, as we will show.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 7/46


This is certainly not to say that all of the company’s customers are dissatis�ed; after all, an
assembly line approach to specialized dentistry can work for some, but it also creates
dangerous gaps in the process that expose patients to heightened risks.


SmileDirectClub is taking the startup approach of “moving fast and breaking things”. In this
case, unfortunately, they seem to be “breaking” many of their customers’ teeth.


Financials: Another Pro�tless Unicorn Incinerating Cash
at an Accelerating Rate


SmileDirectClub has seemingly focused on growing revenue at all costs. The company has seen
an impressive revenue trajectory over the past 2 years, achieving 83% year over year revenue
growth as of the most recent quarter:


(Source: Prospectus Pg. 90
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.htm)


)


But the company has also substantially increased its losses over the same timeframe:

)


Note that the above GAAP losses could (we believe temporarily) improve in subsequent
quarters. Last quarter, the company took a one-time $29.6 million charge on the
extinguishment of debt which it is not expected to repeat in subsequent periods.


The above losses are not fully re�ected in the company’s operating cash �ow metrics, however,
which are far worse. In the most recent 6-month period, the company used almost $98 million
of cash on an operating basis, putting it on track for a 2019 run-rate of negative $196 million,
compared to negative $114 million in 2018.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 9/46


The cash �ow metrics have su�ered in part because the company has extended �nancing to
roughly 65% of its customers, allowing them to pay over a period of up to 24 months [Pgs. 34
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht

We expect such �nanced revenue growth will represent a substantial future drag on cash
intake, particularly with historical delinquency rates ranging from 9%-10%. [Pg. 34

The company has $201 million in debt [Pg. F-47

credit facility (expiring December 14, 2020, unless renewed [Pg. F-49

m)])


With pro-forma cash of roughly $537 million as of the IPO o�ering [Pg. 23
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)], an operating cash burn run-rate of $196 million and $151.3 million of debt due in 2020, we
expect the company will aim to re-tap the equity markets by the end of 2020. That, of course,
assumes the company’s operating metrics stay on the same course.


We Expect Financials Will Materially Worsen


We believe operating metrics will deteriorate in the future due to the company quickly
approaching a “massive public backlash” stage of its business model. We believe that stage
could include:


Major legal and regulatory liabilities. As shown above, multiple state dental boards
have already moved to outlaw some of the company’s current practices. A major class
action lawsuit was recently launched and we anticipate more will follow. The ADA and
AAO also appear to be �ghting the company’s practices aggressively on all fronts.
Consumer backlash. The backlash against companies that play it fast and loose with the
public’s health can be severe, as we have seen recently with vaping companies like Juul.
We expect it is only a matter of time before the mainstream media sheds light on the
subject of DIY orthodontics in the same manner.
Competition. Even if all of the above was ignored, the company has no meaningful
barriers to entry and well-funded competitors are emerging quickly.

Part II: SmileDirectClub’s Dangerous Lack of
Professional Dental Oversight


Orthodontics is a specialized form of dentistry
(https://www.americanboardortho.com/orthodontic-professionals/about-board-certi�cation/).
After a traditional 3 or 4 year dental program, dentists must then pass a rigorous exam and
spend an additional 2 to 3 years in residency before earning orthodontic board certi�cation
(https://www.americanboardortho.com/orthodontic-professionals/about-board-certi�cation/).


The reason orthodontists must spend additional years studying the craft is because
orthodontics is both risky and patient speci�c.


The American Dental Association made this clear in their petition to the FDA
(https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2019-archive/july/association-�les-complaint-
with-ftc-fda-against-smiledirect-club) �ghting against SmileDirect’s practices:


“Teeth are complex living organs comprising many elements. They have nerves and
require blood circulation. Moving teeth that are next to other teeth, are rooted in
bone, and are held in place by ligaments is often a complicated procedure dependent
on multiple individual variables. There really isn’t a “one-size-�ts-all” methodology for
providing competent, professional orthodontic treatment.”


-American Dental Association


The genesis of most of SmileDirect’s problems can be tracked back to what we believe to be a
dangerous lack of professional dentist oversight.


We intend to walk readers through the traditional orthodontic process and show how it
compares to SmileDirect’s “disruptive” new process – and the dangers that result.

Exam Before Orthodontics to Check for Dangerous Issues

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 11/46


Dentists and orthodontists have been adamant that comprehensive oral exams are the
required �rst step before undergoing orthodontics. The American Dental Association (“ADA”)
has made this crystal clear (https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2019-
archive/july/association-�les-complaint-with-ftc-fda-against-smiledirect-club) in its petition
calling out SmileDirect’s practices:


“Without a comprehensive oral examination, customers are at signi�cantly higher risk
for injuries attributable to their orthodontic treatment. This is why dentists are
ethically and professionally obligated to know �rsthand, before they prescribe
treatment, the state of their patients’ oral health.” [Pg. 8
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Fb6MHOigKskeic)]


The ADA further detailed the potentially severe consequences
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Fb6MHOigKskeic) of ignoring this all-important �rst step:


“…patients may be severely injured, su�ering tooth loss, bone damage, nerve
damage, jaw pain, exposed teeth roots, receded gums, aggravated or entirely
new bite maladjustments, and other related injuries.” [Pg. 8
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Fb6MHOigKskeic)]


Rather than following the industry standard, SmileDirect has seemingly chosen to ignore it.
Instead, the company lets customers simply �ll out a waiver and a survey stating whether they
are aware of any dental issues.


We experienced this ourselves when we went to one of SmileDirect’s “Smile Shops” in
Manhattan to research the intake process. There was no dentist on site at all.


At one point during the process, the assistant put an iPad in front of us with a 16-question
survey of yes/no questions. All of the answers were pre-�lled out to say “no”. Questions
included:


“Do you feel pain in any of your teeth?”
“Have you noticed any loosening of your teeth?”
“Do you have untreated periodontal disease?”


(See the full list of questions here (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Jq0ZBbi7D4sWWW))

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 12/46


Most people feel pain in their teeth at some point, but how many are able to accurately
diagnose whether the cause is decay, or something else? Most people also don’t even know
what periodontal disease is, let alone the intricacies of testing for it.


This is likely why an orthodontist we contacted in Pennsylvania warned us that with
teledentistry, we would be “skipping the most important step, diagnosis”. The orthodontist
said that aligners require “a full evaluation, and not just the signing of some waivers”.


The outcome of SmileDirect’s approach, as we will show, seems to involve a lot of broken teeth,
damaged gums and other adverse outcomes, including worsening of gaps and bite issues.

who “Cranked Out” 75 to 100 Cases Per Day from His Phone


Once customers sign waivers and self-certify their own dental health, they seem to be fast-
tracked down the SmileDirect assembly line.


We spoke to a former manager of one of the company’s “Smile Shops” based in the Eastern
United States, asking about the process for approving patients.


He told us that SDC had just one orthodontist for his entire market of shops, who would
“crank out” about 75 to 100 case approvals or denials – using his phone – for those seeking
treatment:


“So we did have the orthodontist – his name was [redacted] – he would come by every
once in a while, like maybe once a month, for like – he might do trainings about how
to scan – but he was getting things sent directly to his phone and he was making
a determination on whether or not you’d be a good candidate or not. So, he was
very friendly, very helpful, very quick and e�cient. We’d almost immediately see
whether or not you would be a good candidate for this treatment.”

When we asked if the orthodontist was the only person responsible for approvals for his store,
the ex-employee clari�ed that he was in charge of the entire market for his area:


“One guy per market. So, some markets were a little bit di�erent. We only had a
couple of stores in the [redacted] market. He handled all of the ones that we had. He’s
literally cranking them out, like as soon as we send them. It’s taking him a
couple of minutes and he’s done. And he can say ‘yay’ or ‘nay’.”


Finally, when asked to estimate how many cases the orthodontist could go through on a daily
basis, given the number his store was sending, combined with other stores in the market, the
ex-employee said:


“On a normal day, I’d say probably between 75 to 100.”


Obviously, there is a huge gap between personalized care from an orthodontist in their o�ce
versus an orthodontist who reviews a case as one of dozens (or possible hundreds) daily, from
his or her phone.


SmileDirect’s Aggressive Sales Culture: Employee Review
Claims “We Are Approving Too Many Cases That Should
Never Be Allowed”


A common theme among online reviews is that SmileDirect takes on patients that are rejected
by competitors like Invisalign and traditional orthodontists.


On Glassdoor (https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Smile-Direct-Club-Reviews-E1043560.htm),
employee reviews (1 (https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Smile-Direct-Club-

dangerous approvals at SmileDirect’s Smile Shops (emphasis added):

“You are appointed 30 minutes to sell a new smile to each new customer all day every
day and then next customer. Your job is only secure based on you selling and closing
at least 70%+ during these appointments each month, using all the newest sales
tactics the company keeps pushing us to use. That is company standard and you will
be put on a PIP and performanced out if you cannot meet their sales expectations. “


“This is hard to do with a clear conscience once you see re�nement and
midcourse correction customers coming into our shops DAILY with serious mal-
occlusion, open anterior bites, edge to edge occlusion, and even mobility due to
treatment! We are approving too many cases that should never be allowed to do
ortho without a doctor evaluating their periodontal health or being UPFRONT and
STRAIGHT FORWARD with how their bites will be misaligned once treatment is
completed. We are not doing the right thing for everyone. Yes, we are helping many
people achieve the smile of their dreams, but others are being ruined. I see those
people daily!”


Based on multiple reviews, agents are tasked with closing sales on 70%-73% of their
appointments. This raises the obvious question: what if 70% of an agent’s initial appointments
aren’t eligible for SmileDirectClub due to obvious dental issues?


SmileDirect’s Aggressive Sales Culture: We Filled Out the
Company’s ‘Smile Assessment’ Saying “I Have Zero Teeth
Le� in My Mouth”


SmileDirect’s Response: “You’re a Great Candidate!”


A quota sales system puts numbers over quality, which can be dangerous in a medical context.


High quotas also strike us as extremely inadvisable given that SmileDirect’s initial sales funnel
doesn’t seem to reject anyone. We �lled out the company’s “30 second smile assessment
(https://smiledirectclub.com/smile_assessment/)” on its website and noticed that we got
accepted as a “great candidate” no matter what answers we provided.


Eventually we put the company’s assessment to the ultimate test, declaring “I have zero teeth
left in my mouth”.

After “grading our tooth test…”


SmileDirect determined that we were a great candidate!


The reputation for accepting just about anyone (even in later stages of the process) pervades
online reviews about the company, as well. In one example, a customer says:

“Other companies rejected me, yet I was accepted by SDC…(my teeth are) pretty
crowded, and was surprised that they accepted me.”


The user later posted this photo of her teeth in the thread:


The thread continued, with users warning that Smile Direct takes anyone.

The former store manager we spoke with estimated that the orthodontist approved about 80%
of cases in his market.


We reached out to the company asking for the overall approval/denial rate. We will update this
report should they write back with an answer. (See Appendix A for all the questions we asked
the company and for our somewhat odd interaction with investor relations.)


Overall, the company’s aggressive sales culture, quota system, and practices seem to
encourage treating patients that have clearly been deemed unsuitable by the “traditional”
orthodontic model.

Take Your Dental Scans in A Sterile O�ce in Case Anything
Goes Wrong


SmileDirect’s “Disruptive” Model: We’ll Mail You Dental
Impression Molds and You Can Perform this Important
Medical Procedure in Your Living Room

Traditionally, once a patient is pre-screened for treatment, professional dentists/orthodontists
take impression molds or perform a scan of their patient’s teeth. With the bene�t of
experience, professionals can take more e�ective impressions or scans and can avoid common
dangers and pitfalls.


Contrary to the approach of using experienced professionals, SmileDirectClub mails customers
impression molds and instructs them how to do it themselves. Here is one (of several) YouTube
videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u2Kl9MpheY) of a SmileDirectClub customer
trying to �gure out the at-home process:


(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u2Kl9MpheY)Following the molds, the company then
instructs customers to take pictures of their teeth.


It is hard to imagine that these pictures and impressions, performed almost entirely by
untrained �rst-time customers using their phones in their living rooms or bathrooms, are of
the highest quality.

Nonetheless, the pictures and impressions, which serve as the foundation of the process for
many of SmileDirect’s customers, are then sent to o�shore unlicensed technicians based in
Costa Rica to set up treatment plans. (Yes, we’re serious. More on this later.)


We asked an orthodontist about whether taking impressions was really all that hard:


“How di�cult is it to take accurate impressions? Would you trust someone who has
never done it before to take them?”


His response:


“Very. Never. Even highly skilled dental assistants occasionally make poor impressions,
necessitating retakes.”

Sometimes medical procedures go wrong even under the care of professionals. But when
medical procedures go wrong at home, users are generally unprepared.


We read multiple online reviews from SmileDirect customers whose impression molds got
stuck. The customers then needed to �nd various ways to pry the molds free from their
mouths.


In other instances, the untrained customers simply took bad impressions, which they believed
led to bad aligners that either didn’t �t at all or worse—led to damage or other adverse
outcomes.


In one example, a user had his molds get stuck in both his gums and a bracket he had for a
missing tooth. After running around in a panic for 30 minutes, unable to breathe, the
individual was forced to take emergency dentistry into his own hands, cutting the mold out of
his mouth with wire cutters.


Per the Facebook post (https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?
q=ethan%20wade%20heacock&epa=SEARCH_BOX) (emphasis added):

“Top impressions went perfectly and I was smiling and was glad I can get this �xed.
Then came bottom to get it impressed. I did everything correct and had waited til I can
pull it o�. Fun part came after this. The mold got stuck in my gum and bracket for my
missing tooth. After almost 30 mins of running around with drool coming out of
my mouth, I had to grab my tools from my tool box and cut this mold into a
bunch of little pieces. I could not breath due to the mold pushing down on my
tongue.”


“So to people who think doing the SmileDirectClub is better than braces trust me go
the more expensive route because this did not go well at all. If it was not for smart
thinking I would have messed my teeth up even more.”


We followed up with the individual and asked him for more information about the experience.
He told us:


“Yea I had to cut the mold o� with a pair of wire cutters. I did my research before
I even purchased the kit to make sure that the bridge my dentist inserted would not
interfere with the molding. I could not get the molding o� at all. It had actually
seeped below my bridge and was stuck it actually got so bad I had to resort my
way into cutting near my gum line just to free my bridge from it getting ripped
out.”


We remarked o�handedly that “hopefully you at least got your money back” and received this
unexpected reply:


“Actually no to this day and this was a year ago actually. To this very day I still
get calls, texts and emails telling me I need to turn in the moldings. I had
actually called them plenty of times and even sent that very picture and told them hey
it got stuck and this is what’s left of it and they said it was not their problem and that
they needed some broken molds back”

Smile Shop In-Store Horror Stories: “There Were Many
Instances Where, In the Middle of a Scan, A Customer’s
Tooth – Or Teeth – Came Out. And There Would Be A Lot of
Blood.”


These days, digital scanners are much more common than using impression molds. Per an
orthodontist we communicated with:


“All orthodontists now use digital scanners in their o�ces. A digital scan is much more
accurate. In New York State, only a certi�ed dental assistant, or doctor, is permitted to
make a digital scan for the purpose of fabricating a medical device.”


SmileDirect o�ers digital scans (in lieu of at-home mold kits) for customers that can make it to
any of the company’s roughly 300 brick & mortar Smile Shops. [Pg. 2
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)] But even in this environment, the Shops generally do not have a trained dentist or
orthodontist on site, instead relying on dental assistants or dental hygienists for support.


A former “Smile Shop” store manager shared some of his most di�cult experiences with us.
Among those horror stories, were times when customers would lose a tooth – or teeth – in the
midst of getting a scan to see if they were eligible for SDC.


As the former store manager told us, he wasn’t a dentist, so he was left unsure of what to do
(emphasis added):


“There were many instances where, in the middle of a scan, a customer’s tooth
came out – or teeth would come out. And there would be a lot of blood – and
both instances are not something that you really can prepare for.”


“And it would be traumatic for our Smile Guides to have to deal with that, even
though a lot of them did come from, or had dental backgrounds or worked in dental
o�ces. You know, it’s a very unpleasant experience. You have to deal with something
like that – like, I’m not a dentist – what do I tell you?”

Customers that lost teeth in the store generally had issues with loose teeth and gums that
would normally preclude them from orthodontics to begin with. Once again, the issue seemed
to arise from a lack of screening procedures and a lack of oversight from a dentist.


Orthodontic “Traditional” Model: Once Your
Dentist/Orthodontist Determines You Are Eligible and It’s
Safe, They Will Cra� Your Plan and Guide You Along the
Way


SmileDirect’s “Disruptive” Model: Onshore Dentists are
Allegedly Paid a Token $50 Per Each ‘Approved’ Treatment
Plan, While Plans Are Set up O�shore by Unlicensed
Technicians in Costa Rica


SmileDirect states that a U.S. licensed dentist “approves” the patients and their treatment
plans. This is true, but according our conversations with former employees and a recent class
action lawsuit, such approvals appear to be mere token involvement.


The complaint (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/cMSW7zDYrbw1UA) alleges that onshore
dentists are paid a small $50 �at fee per approval:


“SmileDirect states that a U.S. licensed orthodontist ‘approves’ the treatment plan. In
fact, to the extent that U.S. doctors or orthodontists are involved in the process, they
are minimally involved. SmileDirect has acknowledged in its ‘ELP participation
agreement for 2017’ that, to the extent a U.S. dentist “participates” in approving
the treatment program, they are only paid if they actually approve the program
and then are paid only $50.”


The ADA petition to the FDA lambasting SmileDirect also references this price point per
approval as well. [Pg. 19 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Fb6MHOigKskeic)]


We reached out to SmileDirect to con�rm whether this is still in fact the process and will
update this report should they write back with an answer.


SmileDirect also does not use onshore licensed medical professionals to set up treatment
plans. Rather, the company conducts all of its treatment planning operations in Costa
Rica. [Pg. 31

The company employs “approximately 650 treatment plan setup technicians” in Costa
Rica along with “approximately 85 doctors for quality review”. [Pg. 115
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)] Once the plans are set up and reviewed o�shore, an onshore dentist is then sent the plan
for approval.


All told, this staggered, assembly line approach to the process seems to preclude meaningful
doctor/patient interaction. It makes it di�cult to fathom how the actual licensed dentists are
much more than a rubber-stamp along the way.


Orthodontic “Traditional” Model: Dentists Fit New Sets of
Aligners on Patient in O�ce Making Sure They Do Not
Damage the Mouth


SmileDirect’s “Disruptive” Model: Aligners Shipped
Directly to Patients, Who Make Adjustments at Home with
Tools Like Nail Files


Traditionally, during clear aligner treatment (the type of product SmileDirect o�ers), aligners
are shipped to the dentist supervising the patient. From there, professionals ensure a proper
�t and that the aligners do not cause damage to the patient’s jaw, teeth, or gums. The visit also
gives patients a dedicated doctor to answer questions and guide them along the way.

Contrary to that guided procedure, SmileDirect sends aligners to its customers by mail. From
there, customers regularly take matters into their own hands when the aligners don’t �t or
cause bleeding or other damage.


SmileDirect groups and message boards are littered with customers advising each other on DIY
dentistry topics like which nail �les to purchase to �le down their aligners and how to adjust
aligners at home:

His reply: “Moving teeth is not a benign process. It’s a medical procedure.”


Former SmileDirectClub Employee: Customers Are Under
the Impression That The “Dental Team” Consists of
Dentists or Orthodontists, But the Only Requirement is to
Be a Dental Hygienist or Dental Assistant


When SmileDirect customers have medical issues, they can contact customer service, which
puts them in touch with the company’s “Dental Team”.


We spoke to a former SmileDirect customer service representative as part of our research who
informed us that customers are often under the mistaken impression that the Dental Team
consists of dentists.


Instead, we were told that the only requirement to be on the “Dental Team” was to be a dental
assistant or dental hygienist (emphasis added):


“The dental team is the ones who actually talk on the phone with customers…If you’re
a dental assistant or dental hygienist, you can be on the dental team. And that’s not
saying that they’re the ones creating the plan. But they’re the ones that are on the
phone talking to the people who are pretty much under the impression that
they’re a dentist or orthodontist.”


Once again, SmileDirect customers hoping for medical advice from a dentist seem to be under
the wrong impression.


Former SmileDirectClub Employee: Customers Are Only
Given the First Name of People They Speak to on the
“Dental Team”


Part of the reason customers are under the wrong impression about the Dental Team is
because they are provided very little information about who they are speaking with. We were
told that customers are essentially kept in the dark:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 29/46


“Really, the only information that they have is their �rst name…whenever they talk to
people, there was never a direct line for a direct person speci�cally. The only email or
number for the dental team was the generic DentalTeam@smiledirectclub.com
(mailto:DentalTeam@smiledirectclub.com) and then all the calls went to the same
number, if that makes sense.”


The former representative continued, telling us the only place customers got a name was the
one that was appended to their Smile Plan, and that even as an employee of the company they
were largely in the dark about names of people on the Dental Team (emphasis added):


“There’s a person’s name on their Smile Plan, which is basically what was created for
their smile for the invisible aligners, but that’s like really the only place that there’s a
name.”


“But they de�nitely didn’t have any information that showed ‘this person practices in
this state’, you know what I’m saying? Because of insurance purposes, I know they did
have to categorize it by location, but we didn’t really see any of that at all. The only
thing I could ever see was the name of the person that created the plan, that
was really it. And that’s really, I think, the only thing that the customer was
really able to see as well.”


In the American Dental Association’s petition to the FDA
(https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2019-P-2038-0001) regarding SmileDirect, it
writes:


“To any extent SDC may have lowered costs it has done so by recklessly selling “do-it-
yourself dentistry” over-the-counter to its customers…


“SDC has virtually eliminated from the process any substantive participation by a
dentist in a customer’s teeth straightening treatment”

On SmileDirect’s website its “Lead Dentist” states (https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-
behind-your-smile/):


“An individual who is requesting treatment by using SmileDirectClub’s aligners is
receiving the same level of care from a treating dentist or orthodontist as an
individual visiting a traditional orthodontist or dentist for treatment.”


– Je�rey Sulitzer, DMD, Lead Dentist at SmileDirectClub


The above statement seems to be the key to SmileDirect’s “success”. Meanwhile, every dentist
or orthodontist that we spoke to disagreed with this statement.


We think consumers, regulators, and the media will soon wake up to the realization that this
assertion made by the company is wrong at every turn.

One of the key selling points for SmileDirect seems to be its customer review ratings. Third-
party review sites show ratings ranging from 2.7 (https://www.highya.com/smiledirectclub-
reviews) to 4.3 (https://www.trustpilot.com/review/smiledirectclub.com) out of 5.0 stars. The
company claims in its prospectus that it has an average rating of 4.9 out of 5.0 from user
reviews submitted through its own website. [Pg. 2
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919004785/a2239489zs-1.htm)]


In examining the company’s reviews, we found a troubling fact.


When most normal companies have an unhappy customer, they grant a refund or make other
concessions. Rather than follow that typical practice, SmileDirectClub seems to turn its refunds
into hush money.

The Capital Forum recently reported that SmileDirect withholds refunds to dissatis�ed
customers unless they sign agreements not to post negative reviews or �le regulatory
complaints. Per the article (https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/07/SmileDirectClub-2019.06.21.pdf):


“Customers who are dissatis�ed with their experience and want a refund are asked to
sign a release preventing them from �ling negative complaints on social media or with
regulators and to withdraw any previously �led complaints. This practice could run
afoul of Section 5 of the FTC Act and state laws, according to FTC sta� and legal
experts.”


Again, we’re not saying the company doesn’t have happy customers. The product clearly works
for some. Nonetheless, these attempts to muzzle negative reviews strikes us as a method of
distorting reality.


SmileDirectClub’s Pattern of Using Aggressive Litigation to

Beyond its attempts to muzzle dissatis�ed customers, the company has �led a bevy of lawsuits
(https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nidhisubbaraman/smile-direct-club-lawsuits-dentists)
against critics.


We at Hindenburg take pride in reporting on companies that try to use litigation to silence
criticism. We believe that companies engaging in such practices are vastly more likely to have
something sinister to hide.


In late 2017, the company sued an orthodontist
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/mGtoU5xdcIQsxA) who posted a YouTube video that
questioned the safety of the company’s approach. The parties later settled
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/lkR5FBZ4R8U1x).
Days later, it sued the Michigan Dental Association
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/HLqVPYt8yK8kxe) for writing an article about
SmileDirect that highlighted “numerous legal and patient safety concerns.” The case was
eventually dismissed (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3FY7wt95M7Aie2).


In addition to suing critics, the company has used the threat of litigation to intimidate others
from coming forward.

11/4/2019 SmileDirectClub: Moving Fast and Breaking Things in People’s Mouths – 85% Downside – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 32/46


A recent complaint (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/cMSW7zDYrbw1UA) alleged “a barrage
of ‘cease and desist’ letters from SmileDirect’s counsel threatening lawsuits and threatening the
�ling of ethical complaints with regulators” against professionals that had voiced their opinions
on the inadequacy of the product.


All told, we think the pattern of lawsuits, threats, and muzzling of dissatis�ed customers are all
telltale signs that SmileDirect is a company that goes out of its way to silence opposition.


No Meaningful Barriers to Entry: Well-Funded
Competitors Are Popping Up Le� and Right


Despite the company’s aggressive practices, it has burned signi�cant cash and has printed
signi�cant net losses to date.


Even if one were to assume that the public, regulators, and the company’s customer base raise
no issues with its practices (which they are), basic economics would nonetheless make it
incredibly hard to achieve lasting pro�tability going forward.


We are already seeing numerous competitors to SmileDirect o�ering substantially similar
services:

11/4/2019 SmileDirectClub: Moving Fast and Breaking Things in People’s Mouths – 85% Downside – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 33/46


We spoke to Candid, Invisalign, Smile Love, Uniform Teeth, and Orthly. The most commonly
cited di�erentiator relative to SmileDirect was that the competitors included substantial
involvement from an orthodontist throughout the process, often including multiple visits and
direct guidance.


The competitors cited SmileDirect as a mostly Do It Yourself (DIY) operation with very light
involvement from orthodontists.


SmileDirect has spent an enormous amount on marketing to date ($209 million in marketing &
selling expenses in just the past 6 months! [Pg. 88
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)]) In the absence of meaningful barriers to entry, the company may simply be paving the way
for more responsible competitors to take its market share.


Governance Questions: Chairman/CEO Sold his $3.4
Million Private Plane to the Company 1 Month Prior to the
IPO. And It Wasn’t Even the First Time He Sold an Interest
in a Private Plane to the Company!


SmileDirect’s Chairman David Katzman controls about 87.5% of the vote [Pg. 150
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)], giving him extraordinary power.


With that power, some of his recent decisions strike us as questionable. Namely, in August
2019, one month before the IPO, Katzman’s entity sold the company his 1996 twin-engine
private jet for $3.4 million. [Pg. 156
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)] Here is the plane (https://�ightaware.com/resources/registration/N623HD):

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 34/46


Remarkably, this wasn’t even the �rst time Katzman sold the company a plane. In
February 2019, the company purchased a $1.1 million interest in another plane from a
Katzman-controlled entity. [Pg. 156
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.ht
m)] In 2018, a Katzman entity billed the company roughly $1 million for use of his plane.


Governance Questions: Executives and A�liates O�oaded
Almost $700 Million Into the IPO


In an IPO, investors aim to see cash reinvested back into the business to have a growth pro�le
to look forward to.


We’re also realists – it’s reasonable to expect some insiders and early investors to want to cash
out parts of their stakes.


During SmileDirect’s IPO, company executives and a�liates cashed out almost $700 million,
representing over half of the total net IPO proceeds:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 35/46


(Source: Prospectus Pg. 153
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.htm)


)


By comparison, only $387.9 was raised for general corporate purposes, with the balance
paying yet more executive bonuses and cashing out early shareholders.


All told, we think the company’s executive team chose pinpoint timing to o�oad their shares
onto the public (and a couple of private jets).


Conclusion & Predictions


We think SmileDirect is selling a dangerous product that cuts corners instead of actually
disrupting the orthodontics industry. True disruption results in a better product at a better
price, not in muzzling harmed customers with legal releases and silencing critics with litigation.


We expect SmileDirect’s harmful practices will lead to an increasing chorus of opposition from
regulators, media, customers, and its more responsible competitors, eventually impairing its
brand or forcing it to signi�cantly alter its practices. This won’t happen instantly, but we think
within a year we’ll be looking at a vastly di�erent “teledentistry” landscape than we are right
now.


As far as the stock is concerned, the company is currently trading at ~6.5x its current revenue
run-rate, despite continuing to incinerate cash. The market is currently valuing SDC as if it is a
high-margin recurring-revenue SaaS company in explosive-growth mode.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1775625/000104746919005230/a2239665z424b4.htm
11/4/2019 SmileDirectClub: Moving Fast and Breaking Things in People’s Mouths – 85% Downside – Hindenburg Research


https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 36/46


In reality, SDC strikes us as (i) a low-quality consumer product company (ii) with high customer
acquisition costs (iii) in a competitive, worsening-margin environment (iv) extending seemingly
sub-prime �nancing to customers (v) who are largely making 1-time purchases.


The company’s ridiculous valuation is typically only found deep in the enchanted unicorn
forests of Silicon Valley. Now that SDC is a public company, we expect its valuation will become
far more tethered to actual operating performance over the next 6-12 months as IPO lockups
expire and as the market begins to process its business model.


We expect that the company will continue to show revenue growth, and may even turn a brief
GAAP pro�t, while continuing to burn operating cash �ow over the next couple of quarters.


Given our prognosis for negative cash �ow and negative net income, we were left with a basic
revenue multiple for our analysis. When applying a 2x multiple to SDC’s Q2 2019 revenue run-
rate we arrive at a market cap of $1.5 billion, representing downside of 70%.


As consumer backlash hits, and the company’s cash balance comes back into focus, we expect
matters to worsen considerably. Our overall 12-month price target is $2, representing about
85% downside from current levels.


Best of luck to all.


Appendix A: Questions We Asked the Company


We emailed SmileDirect’s investor relations with questions in advance of this report. They
replied quickly (A+ response time), but repeatedly asked that questions be answered over the
phone. We repeatedly asked that they answer questions, any of them, in writing (we wanted
them to be de�nitive/on-the-record) and they failed to do so. We found the exchange to be
pleasant, though rather odd.


Should the company respond back with answers to any of our questions below, we will update
this piece accordingly. Here they are so readers can get a sense of the questions we were
interested in:


1. What do you view as the next growth market for the company? I saw some expansion in the
UK but where else do you see opportunities in the near future?

https://hindenburgresearch.com/smiledirectclub-moving-fast-and-breaking-things-in-peoples-mouths/ 37/46


2. I read in the recent class action complaint which said that Alabama and Georgia had
outlawed certain practices employed by the company. Are you receiving pushback from any
state boards other than Georgia and Alabama right now? How do you plan to handle operating
in those two states going forward?


3.  Have you heard any guidance or response from the FDA or FTC on the issues raised by the
ADA with those agencies?


4. One common criticism I’ve seen is that the company doesn’t have thorough involvement
from orthodontists and dentists.  What is the role of dentists/orthodontists in the SDC process
from start to �nish?


5.  Do customers know who they are speaking with on the dental team?


6.  Who do you see as your most formidable competitor at the moment?


7.  What percentage of prospective customers does the company reject?


8. The recent class action lawsuit stated that the company pays orthodontists/dentists $50 per
approval of each plan. Is that still the going rate today?


9. Are there other circumstances where orthodontists/dentists are paid and what are the rates
for those services?


11. The Capital Forum published an article recently saying that customers are asked to sign a
release in order to get a refund. Is that still the case and are you able to share a copy of what
that release looks like?


12. What percentage of aligner sales are generated from at home kits vs SmileShop scans? Do
you see that mix changing?

This report is actually a good one, and it doesn’t even get into the issue of the TAM math, which
argues for growth hitting a wall much sooner than they are guiding analysts. If the TAM is 20
million people, and it replenishes somewhat each year, then it is actually very hard to exceed
1.0 million case starts per year for an extended period of time. If you look at the adoption rates
of other consumer discretionary services, stu� like Botox, among others, you’d see that they
usually penetrate only a few points of the market per year. It makes sense. You have crooked
teeth, you want them �xed… the people who really care about their appearance will act sooner,
but once the “early adopters” have signed up, then you get into the people who think “yeah I
want to do this… at some point… maybe next year… maybe I’ll do a vacation �rst… maybe I
should save a little more… let me revisit this next year.” It’s just the way large ticket consumer
discretionary products tend to see adoption. And those were products without competition.

Thus, for Smile Direct to achieve the targets they are hinting at by the middle 2020’s (well over
2 million case starts), they would have to follow a much, much steeper adoption curve than we
usually see. Or they will need to have runaway success in overseas markets.


It’s an aggressively managed company, with aggressive street expectations. The fact they
pushed so hard on maximizing IPO pricing suggests they knew this thing was a house of cards,
and they just wanted to be able to monetize as much in the IPO as they could, with no regard
for building trust or goodwill. If this were a durable franchise, consistently compounding value,
they would have been less greedy, so as to not burn bridges in advance of a large number of
looming secondaries.

Very well researched and prepared article that needs to “get out there.” I will be sharing it.
Read the BBB complaints—they all sound similar/the same (all 1270 of them). Go to SDC
Facebook page and feel for the poor customers on there asking when their aligners are really
going to show up and how they can cancel (good luck with that)…and read the canned
responses from SDC.
Someone I know who dealt with them was appalled at the consent form the company made
her sign in order to get her refund (she had no aligners yet had to beg for her money back and
sign a document she did not agree with): she was to delete any negative reviews, retract any
o�cial complaints with agencies, and keep anyone else from seeing the consent form! What

kind of business demands this after they have failed to supply the service that was paid for? I
can’t imagine they will be around for much longer, but God help the people who pay these
people because they feel they can’t a�ord real treatments.
