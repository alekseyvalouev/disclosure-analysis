Ozner Water International Holding Ltd. (2014.HK) (“Ozner” or the “Company”) manufactures and leases water purifiers to 


corporations and households.  In this report, we present publicly available evidence, including SAIC filings, government tax 


records and independent brand rankings, which in our opinion, indicate that Ozner has made false and misleading 


representations and disclosures to the market regarding its financial and operational performance.   





We believe that Ozner has a real working business, produces real products and leases such products to real customers.  


However, based on our review of the independent evidence presented in this report, we believe that Ozner’s business is 


substantially smaller (in production and sales) and much less profitable than Ozner claims.   





We estimate that Ozner is only worth between HKD 0.27-0.85 per share, a downside of 76%-92% from today’s trading 


price.  However, in our view, further downside pressure on Ozner’s share price is likely given what would appear to be major 


breaches of Hong Kong listing rules and investor confidence. 





1. SAIC Filings Indicate Material Exaggeration of Sales, Production and Profit.  SAIC filings of Ozner’s primary 
operating subsidiaries indicate, in our opinion, that Ozner’s revenues, production and profitability are in reality a fraction 


of the figures reported to Hong Kong investors and regulators in its prospectus.   





a. SAIC Filings Indicate Real Production Figures are 90% Less than Reported.  According to the prospectus, the 
cost of raw materials and components for the manufacture of water purification systems, which accounted for 70% 


of the total production costs, was RMB 184 million and RMB 130 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  


Because Ozner’s subsidiary, Shangyu Haorun Environmental Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shangyu Manufacturing”), 


manufactured all of Ozner’s water purification systems during this period, it should have incurred all such 


production costs.  But SAIC filings show that Shangyu Manufacturing’s production costs were only RMB 7.5 


million and RMB 12 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, over 90% less than the costs of raw materials and 


components reported in Ozner’s prospectus.  In our opinion, this indicates that Ozner materially exaggerated the 


scale of its production and business in its prospectus.  





b. Profitability and Revenues from Leasing Purifiers Much Less than Reported.   Annual rental fees from leasing 
water purifiers to corporations and households ostensibly accounted for ~70% of Ozner’s reported revenue during 


the pre-IPO track-record period.  However, SAIC filings of Shaanxi Haoze Environmental Technology (“Shaanxi 


Haoze”) and Shanghai Haoze Water Purification Technology Development Co., Ltd (“Shanghai Haoze”), Ozner’s 


two operating subsidiaries that lease water purifiers to end users, indicate that Ozner’s revenues from the leasing of 


water purifiers were 54% less than reported in Ozner’s prospectus for 2012 and 2011, respectively.  More 


importantly, SAIC filings show that rather than generate RMB 18 million in operating profit in 2011 and RMB 98 


million in 2012 as Ozner claims, the leasing subsidiaries were in fact unprofitable in 2011 (losing RMB 3 


million) and only generated RMB 18 million in operating profit in 2012 (81% less than reported). 
  


2. Same Business, Different Result?  In 2009, Mr. Xiao, Ozner’s chairman, CEO and founder, sold his water purification 
leasing business, including the Ozner-brand, to a Hong Kong listed company, Chaoyue Group Limited (“CGL”) (HK: 


0147).  From 2009 through 2012, CGL reported that its water purifier leasing business lost RMB 195 million 


(including write downs).  CGL eventually sold the business to Ozner for HKD 78.5 mm in September 2012, after losses 


forced CGL to write off most of its value.  This is disclosed in the public filings.  Not disclosed in Ozner’s prospectus is 


the degree of similarities between CGL’s failed water machine leasing business, which it sold in September 2012, and 


Ozner’s reportedly profitable business, which went public in 2014. 





a. Same Brand.  A PowerPoint presentation available online shows that CGL sold and leased Ozner-branded water 
purifiers. 





b. Similar Models using the Same Technology.  The same PowerPoint presentation shows that CGL sold the same 
(or very similar) models of Ozner-branded water purifiers (from 2010-2012), using what appears to be the same 


technology that Ozner employs today.

COMPANY:    Ozner Water International Holding Limited │ HK: 2014 


INDUSTRY:    Water Purification  
 




























































































c. Same Management.    CGL's annual reports state that from 2009 through 2012, Ozner’s CEO, founder and chairman, Mr. Xiao, served as the 
director of the CGL subsidiary in charge of leasing water purifiers.  Moreover, the CGL PowerPoint presentation shows that CGL employed the 


exact same research and development team as Ozner (prior to its IPO).   





d. Same Business Model.  CGL, like Ozner, rented machines to end users through a network of third party distributors. 
 


e. Same Time.  In January 2011, CGL sublicensed the right (through an intermediary) to market and sell Ozner-branded water purifying machines to 
Ozner in all but 10 cities in China.  From January 2011 through September 2012, both Ozner and CGL were marketing and leasing Ozner 


branded machines to end users in China – CGL retained the right to do so in the ten cities of its choice, and Ozner purchased the right to do so in 


the other regions.  In other words, both CGL and Ozner appear to have been marketing the same models to Chinese consumers at the same time.  


Should not the result have been similar? 





f. Different Result. Between February 2009 and March 2012, CGL reported that its water purifying business lost an aggregate of RMB 195 
million.  By the time CGL sold the business to Ozner in 2012, liabilities significantly exceeded assets.  How can a business, which was a small, 


unprofitable failure and sold after considerable losses in 2012, suddenly transform into a business with a HKD 6.2 billion market capitalization and 


38% net margins for a 2014 IPO?  We do not believe that a failed businesses can rise from the dead so quickly. 





3. Material Undisclosed Related Party Transactions.  According to its prospectus, Ozner sublicensed the right to market and lease water purifying 
machines under the Ozner brand from a purportedly independent third party, Shanghai Haoyang Environmental Technology (“Shanghai Haoyang”) from 


January 2011 through September 2012, before acquiring the business outright from CGL.  Ozner unequivocally stated in its prospectus that Shanghai 


Haoyang was an “independent third party” and went so far to say, in no uncertain terms, that “none of Shanghai Haoyang or its directors or 


shareholders had any past or present relationship, including without limitation, employment or financing relationship with [Ozner] or our … 


shareholders during the Track Record Period.”  We believe that this is a blatant misrepresentation, because PRC government records, available to 


any investor online, show that an Ozner shareholder and director of one its operating subsidiary was in fact the controlling shareholder of Shanghai 


Haoyang since 2010.  This undisclosed related party transaction is, in our view, a clear violation of the listing rules regarding a transaction and 


relationship critical to Ozner. 





4. PRC Government Tax Records Indicate Net Income a Fraction of Reported Figures.  The city of Shangyu (Zhejiang province) publishes annual tax 
rankings, available to any investor online, recognizing the top tax paying businesses (including income tax and VAT) in its jurisdiction.  If Ozner’s 


reported financials are accurate, we calculate that its sole manufacturing subsidiary during the track-record period should have paid approximately 


RMB 3.3mm, 8.7mm and 8.9mm in VAT in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Yet the Shangyu city tax rankings state that Shangyu Manufacturing 


paid only RMB 2.27mm, 2.25mm and less than 1mm in total taxes (including VAT) in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, suggesting, in our opinion, 


that Ozner’s taxes paid (and thus net income) is at least 74% less than Ozner claims. 





a. Why Does Ozner Not Pay Income Tax?  Despite reporting an aggregate of RMB 795 million in revenue and RMB 277 million in net income 
from 2011 through 2013 (and accruing RMB 64 in income tax payables by FYE 2013), Ozner paid less than RMB 3 million in total income 


taxes during the pre-IPO track-record period.  Ozner claims that it did not pay income taxes because it did not submit invoices to its principal 


distributors.  But taxes are not due when customers are invoiced, but rather when revenue and profits are recognized, which is why we find Ozner’s 


explanation ludicrous.  After all, if this were true, then all companies could defer taxes on leased goods by simply not invoicing customers (even 


though they receive payments for such goods).  We believe that Ozner did not pay meaningful income taxes because it was barely profitable, and 


that its explanation of an invoice-based tax exemption is not credible and further evidence that it has been exaggerating its reported profitability. 





5. Questionable Market Share 
 


a. Consumer Brand Ranking.  Ozner claims in its prospectus to be the third largest water purifier manufacturer in China and the market leader in 
commercial sales.  Yet six different, independent rankings of top water purifying brands conducted by six different organizations in 2013 and 2014, 


do not list Ozner in the top 10, let alone the top three, of brands of water purifying machines in China.  Each list includes Ozner’s purported 


competitors, Midea and Qinyuan, in the top 10.  These consumer surveys undermine the Company’s claims regarding its market share, sales and 


brand awareness.   





b. Taobao and Tmall.  Similarly, even when we limit the search parameters to water purifying machines which cost over RMB 2,000 (to account for 
Ozner’s most popular models), a ranking of top water purifiers sold on Tmall and Taobao in the past 30 days shows that not only has Ozner failed 


to place any product in the top ten, but also that Ozner has only sold a limited number of purifiers over this time.  Compare this to Midea and 


Qinyuan, which according to Taobao and Tmall have each sold thousands of machines priced at over RMB 2,000 over the same period. 





6. Accounting Shenanigans: Depreciation.   Ozner’s most critical accounting assumption is that it assigns a 10-year useful life for water purification 
machines leased to end users.  But this critical assumption appears unreasonable when compared to historical assumptions for Ozner-branded water 


purifiers.  From 2009-2012, CGL estimated the useful life of the same machines at 5 years.  Using a 5-year useful life assumption instead of 10 years, 


we estimate that Ozner’s 2013 earnings per share would have been 39% less than reported (this is without even taking into consideration the evidence 


presented in this report which we believe shows that Ozner is significantly less profitable than it claims). 





7. Valuation.  We believe, based on the evidence presented in this report that Ozner’s sales and profits are significantly less than reported.  Although we 
believe that Ozner’s business may be worth between HKD 0.27-0.85 per share, we expect further downside pressure on Ozner’s share price as a result 


of what in our opinion were material misrepresentations during Ozner’s listing process regarding its financial and operational performance.

SAIC FILINGS SUGGEST MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS 





SAIC filings of Ozner’s primary subsidiaries indicate that the Company’s production, sales and 


profitability are a fraction of the figures reported to Hong Kong investors and regulators.   


1) SAIC Filings Indicate Real Production Figures 90% Less than Reported 
 


SAIC filings of Shangyu Haorun Environmental Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shangyu Manufacturing”) 


indicate that Ozner massively overstated its production during the pre-IPO track-record period.  


From 2011 through 2013, Ozner reported that its only manufacturing facility, responsible for the 


production of all of the Company’s water purification machines during the track-record period, was 


owned and operated by its subsidiary Shangyu Manufacturing.
1
   





Source: Ozner Prospectus, p. 27. 


Given that the Company disclosed the average cost of raw materials and components per machine (RMB 


1,200 in 2012 and RMB 1,100 in 2011) as well the total number of machines produced for both years, we 


can calculate the total cost of such production inputs during the track-record period.   





Ozner’s COGS in its prospectus do not reflect production costs, because such costs are capitalized.  Only 


the depreciation (1/10
th
 of the production costs) appear as COGS on the consolidated income statement in 


the prospectus.  However, because Shangyu Manufacturing does not maintain title to the water purifying 


machines, but transfers title to the machines to other subsidiaries for lease to end users, Shangyu 


Manufacturing does not keep the machines on its balance sheet.  Accordingly, the manufacturing 


subsidiary’s COGS in the SAIC filings should reflect not depreciation but the production costs of the 


machines disclosed in the prospectus.

Put simply, as Ozner’s sole manufacturing subsidiary, Shangyu Manufacturing should have incurred at 


least RMB 184 million and RMB 130 million in costs in 2012 and 2011, respectively, as this was the 


reported cost of raw materials and components purchased to produce water purifiers.  


However, SAIC filings show that Shangyu Manufacturing’s COGS were only RMB 7.5mm and 


11.9mm in 2012 and 2011, respectively, which is 96% and 91% less than the Company’s reported costs 


of raw materials and components in those years.

The balance sheet from Shangyu Manufacturing’s SAIC filings confirms that such production costs were 


not capitalized.  The only increase in PP&E (where such capitalized costs would be recorded) was from 


RMB 2.8 million in 2011 to RMB 25 million in 2012.  This increase was due to the expansion of the 


Shangyu manufacturing facility (a RMB 26 million increase in PP&E according to the prospectus).
2
  The 


balances of PP&E on the SAIC balance sheets are simply too small to account for capitalized 


manufacturing costs, even if such an accounting practice were permitted under PRC GAAP.

The balance of trade payables at Shangyu Manufacturing similarly indicates that Ozner’s production costs 


were significantly less than reported in its prospectus.   


In its prospectus, Ozner reported over RMB 37 million and RMB 43 million in trade payables, a liability 


on the Company’s balance sheet, at FYEs 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Ozner states in its prospectus that 


the vast majority of trade payables arose from payments to suppliers of components of water purification 


machines, which means such payables should be incurred by its sole manufacturing subsidiary.
3
  Yet, 


SAIC filings show that Shangyu Manufacturing’s trade payables were RMB 0.7 million at FYE 2012 and 


RMB 0.9 million at FYE 2011.   





Ultimately, Shangyu Manufacturing’s SAIC filings show that the production costs of Ozner’s sole 


manufacturing subsidiary during the track record period were over 90% less than the cost of raw 


materials and components reported by the Company in its prospectus.   


We believe that the Shangyu Manufacturing SAIC files are a smoking gun, indicating that the Company 


materially fabricated its reported production and thus the scale of its business to Hong Kong investors and 


regulators.   


2) Profitability and Revenues from Leasing Purifiers Much Less than Reported   
 


Annual rental fees from leasing water purifiers to corporations and households ostensibly accounted for 


~70% of Ozner’s reported revenue during the pre-IPO track-record period and are increasingly the 


Company’s dominant business segment (accounting for 76% of revenues in FY 2013).   





According to Ozner’s prospectus, Shanghai Haoze Water Purification Technology Development Co., Ltd. 


(“Shanghai Haoze”) and Shaanxi Haoze Environmental Technology (“Shaanxi Haoze”), are the 


Company’s subsidiaries which lease water purifying machines to end users (together, the “Leasing 


Subsidiaries”).
4
   





Ozner recognizes revenue from the leasing of water purifiers on a straight-line basis over the one-year 


term of the lease.
5
  But Ozner purportedly receives the annual leasing fee in cash up front from its 


principal distributors (often in the form of a deposit or advance from the distributor when it signs up with 


Ozner), and the annual fee is deducted from such deposit or advance on a monthly basis following either 


installation or the annual renewal of the lease.
6
   





The Company reported leasing revenues from water purifiers of RMB 53 million in 2011 and RMB 195 


million in 2012.  Importantly, Ozner reported that this business was its primary driver of profitability.  In 


2011, its water purification leasing business accounted for 67% of reported operating profits (RMB 18.3

million).
7
  In 2012, the water purification leasing business accounted for 80% of reported operating 


profits (RMB 98 million).
8
 





Yet SAIC filings of Shaanxi Haoze and Shanghai Haoze indicate, in our opinion, that Ozner’s leasing 


revenues are much smaller and far less profitable than reported.  On a consolidated basis, rental revenues 


reported in the SAIC filings of the Leasing Subsidiaries were ~54% less than reported in the 


prospectus in both 2012 and 2011.   











Equally important, SAIC filings show that rather than generate operating profits of RMB 18 million in 


2011 and RMB 98 million in 2012, the Leasing Subsidiaries were unprofitable in 2011 (losing RMB 3.1 


million) and only generated RMB 18 million in operating profit in 2012 (81% less than reported).
9
 





It is critical to note not only that revenues and operating profits are a fraction of the figures reported to 


Hong Kong investors in the prospectus, but that SAIC balance sheets for the leasing subsidiaries show a 


combined PP&E of revenue generating assets of RMB 252 million in 2012, 34% less than reported in 


the prospectus.

 We believe, based on the low COGS in the SAIC filings for both Leasing Subsidiaries, that the Leasing Subsidiaries capitalize 


the acquisition cost of the water purification machines like the Company does on a consolidated basis in its Hong Kong filings.  


As a result, we believe that profitability figures are comparable between SAIC filings and the Hong Kong prospectus.  However, 


because in the PRC (and on SAIC filings) they do not capitalize the installation costs of the machines, we would expect a slight 


difference between Hong Kong filings and SAIC filings.

million on the Hong Kong balance sheet).  Ozner Prospectus, p. 205, 231 and I-31.

The balance sheets in the SAIC filings also confirm that Shaanxi Haoze and Shanghai Haoze are, as the 


Company reiterates in its prospectus, the leasing subsidiaries which maintain title to machines rented out 


to end users and thus should report rental revenues and operating profits similar to the figures reported in 


the Hong Kong prospectus.  They do not.

If Ozner’s prospectus was truthful and accurate, we would expect the SAIC filings of the Company’s 


primary leasing subsidiaries, Shaanxi Haoze and Shanghai Haoze, to show substantially the same 


financial performance (at least in terms of sales and operating profits) as the consolidated entity.   





They do not.  Rather, the Leasing Subsidiaries’ SAIC filings’ shows revenues which were 54% less than 


reported.  SAIC filings also show that operating profits were 81% less than reported in 2012, and that the 


subsidiaries were unprofitable in 2011 (in direct contradiction to the prospectus).  In our opinion, this is 


further evidence that Ozner has significantly overstated the financial performance of its Company to 


Hong Kong investors and regulators.

SAME BUSINESS, DIFFERENT RESULT? 


Prior to Ozner’s IPO, evidence suggests that Chaoyue Group Limited (“CGL”) (HK: 0147), a Hong Kong 


listed company, ran a very similar business, leasing Ozner-branded water purifying machines to end 


users, from 2009 through 2012.  Despite leasing 63,000 water purifiers
12


 (including many of the same or 


similar models as Ozner leases today), CGL’s water purification machine leasing business was an 


unprofitable failure which CGL eventually sold after prolonged and significant losses.   


Put simply, we are skeptical that almost an identical business could go from small and unprofitable failure 


in 2012 (under CGL) to a thriving and profitable operation with a market capitalization of HKD 6.2 


billion under Ozner.  We believe that such a turnaround is fantasy, and that the Company’s purported 


performance has simply been exaggerated in preparation for a 2014 IPO.    


1) Ozner’s Water Purifier Leasing Business Failed under CGL 
 


In 2005, Ozner’s chairman, founder and CEO, Shu Xiao (“Xiao”) started Shanghai Comfort, which leased 


water purification machines to end users in China through a direct marketing channel and third party 


distributors.  In 2008, a Hong Kong public company, CGL, agreed to purchase the business from Xiao in 


exchange for preferred shares in CGL.  The purchase price however, would change considerably.   


Originally, CGL announced that the consideration for the acquisition was HKD 800 million in preferred 


shares.  In its subsequent annual report, CGL announced that the consideration for the purchase was in 


fact only HKD 383 million in preferred shares, subject to a purchase-price adjustment based on whether 


the business achieved a profit in calendar-year 2009 of HKD 100 million.
13


  It failed.  In fact, the water 


purification leasing business was so unprofitable that CGL adjusted the purchase down from HKD 383 


million to HKD 41 million, an 89% decrease.
14





From the time CGL acquired Shanghai Comfort in 2009 to the time it sold the subsidiary to Ozner in 


2012, the business continued to be a money-losing failure beset by declining sales and mounting write 


offs, driven primarily by the awful performance of the water purifier leasing segment.   





Following CGL’s acquisition of the water purification business, the segment operated at a loss.  It was 


unprofitable from FY 2010 through FY 2011, including a particularly disastrous FY 2011 in which the 


water purification machine leasing segment recorded losses of HKD 167 million because CGL had to 


write off most of its value.

CGL was forced to write off almost all of the value of the business and take massive impairment losses on 


the value of the leased machines, PP&E (including the factory), intangible assets (presumably including 


the Ozner brand) and goodwill: 





Such impairment losses resulted in an upside-down balance sheet in which the business, driven mainly by 


the failing water purifying leasing segment, began to report liabilities significantly in excess of assets. 





2) CGL’s Water Purifying Business Appears Very Similar to Ozner’s 
 


Although Ozner does mention in its prospectus that CGL struggled, it discusses neither the extent of 


CGL’s losses nor the striking similarities between CGL’s business and Ozner’s.  Consider the following 


PowerPoint presentations.  The first presentation was circulated between 2010 and 2012 by CGL.  The 


second presentation was circulated in 2013 by Ozner in anticipation of its IPO.  


In the CGL presentation, CGL describes its “Ozner” branded water purification and air sanitization 


business:

CGL’s PowerPoint presentation states that it marketed Ozner-branded water purifiers to the 2010 


Shanghai expo, so we estimate that the presentation was created at some point between 2010 and 2012 


when it sold the water purification business to Ozner.   


It is clear from the CGL presentation that CGL was leasing very similar models under the same 


brand which employed the same technology designed by the same research and development team 


as Ozner.   


Mr. Xiao Shu, Ozner’s founder, CEO and Chairman, also apparently worked for CGL during this period.  


He is listed in each CGL annual report from 2009-2012 as the director of the Shanghai Comfort 


operating subsidiary, suggesting (in our view) that he was involved in the management of the subsidiary 


that leased and marketed water purifiers on behalf of CGL.

Clearly Mr. Xiao, according to CGL’s annual reports, remained the director of the subsidiary which 


marketed and leased water purifiers from 2009-2012. 


CGL’s public financials also makes clear that Ozner’s water purification business was a money-losing 


failure, beset by declining sales and mounting losses until CGL finally wrote off most of the business.

In January 2011, CGL signed an agreement with an independent third party, Shanghai Haoyang.  Under 


the new deal, Shanghai Haoyang took over the office facilities, intellectual property (including the right to 


sell water purification machines under the brand name ‘Ozner’), and the annual rental fees from 


previously installed purifying machines.  Shanghai Haoyang assumed responsibility to manage and 


service installed water purifying machines, and assumed the right to market and lease new machines to 


new customers (other than in 10 cities retained by CGL).  In exchange, Shanghai Haoyang agreed to pay 


CGL an annual fee of only HKD 12.5 million.   


In many ways this arrangement appears to be an indictment of Ozner’s current valuation and of the water 


purifier leasing business model.  For the paltry annual fee of HKD 12.5 million, CGL was willing to 


subcontract all service and maintenance obligations and revenues for installed machines (as well as the 


right to lease to new customers in all but 10 cities).  This arrangement makes sense given how much 


money CGL was losing by leasing water purifying machines.  But it also suggests that Ozner’s current 


valuation is largely illusory and supports other evidence presented in this report indicating that the 


Company’s historical profitability has been fabricated. 


Another detail is critical.  Shanghai Haoyang sublicensed its right under the contract from CGL to Ozner, 


meaning that from January 2011 through September 2012, both CGL and Ozner were marketing, 


leasing and installing water purifying machines in China to end users.  But CGL retained the right to 


run the business in 10 cities of its choice (which, based on CGL’s annual report, we believe were as 


follows):

From March 2011 to March 2012, CGL’s water purifier leasing segment managed RMB 22 million in 


sales and RMB 9.7 million in operating profit.
16


  But this includes HKD 12.5 million in fees from 


subcontracting management of the installed machines to Ozner, so setting aside such fees it appears that 


CGL still operated the water purifying business at a loss during this period.
17





By contrast, in CY 2011, Ozner reported 107,000 new installations, which supposedly generated RMB 53 


million in rental income from leasing water purifiers and RMB 18 million in operating profit. How did 


Ozner generate more than five times the leasing revenues of CGL when CGL retained the right to lease 


machines in the 10 cities of its choice? How did Ozner install 107,000 new machines in CY 2011 when 


CGL retained the rights to the (presumably) best 10 cities and CGL had only installed 34,700 total 


machines since it acquired the business?
18


 How was Ozner able to operate profitably in those areas when 


CGL was presumably not able to do so?  


In August 2012, CGL sold the Shanghai Comfort business to Ozner for a consideration of HKD 78.5 


million.
19


  In essence CGL sold the water purification machine leasing business to Ozner for 1.5% of 


Ozner current market capitalization.  We believe that in this acquisition, Ozner acquired the right to 


use the Ozner brand, the rights to payments on installed machines and the rest of the Shanghai Comfort 


water and air purification business.   


In describing the sale of Shanghai Comfort, CGL made clear that water and air purification business 


(including the leasing of water purifying machines) had been responsible for HKD 213.6 million in 


losses in FY 2011 and HKD 0.1 million in losses from operation in FY 2012.  The water and air 


purification business also carried net liabilities as of March 31, 2012, of HKD 205.7 million:

It is clear from CGL’s public filings that leasing Ozner-branded water purifying machines in China was a 


dramatic failure, resulting in sustained losses before CGL disposed of the business after writing down 


most of its value.  


Ozner’s current shareholders and auditors have to ask themselves how an essentially identical business, 


apparently run by the same manager (Mr. Xiao) leasing the same (or similar) products using the same 


core technology under the same brand, was unprofitable under CGL, only to suddenly become extremely 


profitable (net income margins of 35% and 38% in 2012 and 2013) when it was repackaged in preparation 


for the 2014 IPO.  We believe that the most likely explanation, and one that is corroborated by SAIC 


filings and tax records, is that Ozner’s water purifying business did not come back from the dead.  Rather, 


we believe that financial alchemists have simply fabricated the Company’s newfound success.

UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 


PRC government records, available to any investor online, indicate, in our opinion that Ozner blatantly 


misrepresented its relationship with the third party from whom Ozner acquired the rights to its business 


and with whom Ozner continued to transact throughout 2 of the 3 years of the track-record period.   


As discussed in the previous section, leasing Ozner-branded water purifiers was such a disaster for CGL 


that in 2011, CGL sub-contracted the rights to run the business to Shanghai Haoyang Environmental 


Technology (“Shanghai Haoyang”) in exchange for an annual fee HKD 12.5 million per year.  Under this 


framework, CGL granted to Shanghai Haoyang the right to market and lease water purifiers under the 


Ozner brand, the right to all revenues from previously installed machines, as well as right to use all office 


facilities, intellectual property and third-party distributors of the water purifying business (in all but 10 


cities).  


According to the Company’s prospectus, Shanghai Haoyang then sub-contracted its right under the CGL 


subcontract to Ozner from January 2011 through September 2012.  In September 2012, Ozner terminated 


this sub-contract with Shanghai Haoyang and supposedly cut out the middleman by purchasing the 


Shanghai Comfort business (including installed water purifying machines and the Ozner brand) from 


CGL.   


Clearly Shanghai Haoyang’s dealings with Ozner were critical to both Ozner’s entry into the water 


purifying business and its operations between January 2011 and September 2012.  During that period, 


which covered almost two years of the three year pre-IPO track-record period, Ozner paid Shanghai 


Haoyang a fee for the right to market, lease, install and receive revenue from Ozner-branded water 


purifying machines.  Therefore, any details about the relationship between Shanghai Haoyang and Ozner, 


including any relationships that would otherwise suggest that the two parties did not conduct business at 


arm’s length, would be critical to Ozner’s IPO investors.   


That is why Ozner unequivocally stated in its prospectus that Shanghai Haoyang was an “independent 


third party” and went so far to say, in no uncertain terms, that “none of Shanghai Haoyang or its 


directors or shareholders had any past or present relationship, including without limitation, 


employment or financing relationship with [the Company] or our … shareholders during the Track 


Record Period”:

But this appears to be a blatant misrepresentation.  Corporate records published online by the Chinese 


government indicate that Xiao Jianping (an Ozner shareholder and director of an Ozner operating 


subsidiary) was and is a 60% shareholder of Shanghai Haoyang.  Any investor can access such record by

The above record indicates that Xiao Jianping (not be confused with the Mr. Xiao who is Ozner’s

 SAIC records show that Xiao Jianping originally pledged to contribute RMB 300,000 in Shanghai Haoyang (see next page) but 


that amount was reduced to RMB 60,000 when Shanghai Haoyang's registered capital was reduced from RMB 500,000 to RMB 


100,000.

Ozner explicitly stated in its prospectus that none of Shanghai Haoyang’s shareholders had any 


relationship with Ozner, past or present, during the track-record period.  But the evidence suggests exactly 


the opposite: that an Ozner shareholder and manager of an operating subsidiary was in fact the controlling 


shareholder of Shanghai Haoyang during that time.   


Plainly, Shanghai Haoyang is not an independent third party as the Company claims, but is rather a 


hidden, undisclosed related party.  Not only do we believe that this is a clear violation of Hong Kong’s 


listing rules but, in our opinion, constitutes a blatant misrepresentation to investors.

PRC TAX RECORDS INDICATE NET INCOME A FRACTION OF REPORTED 





Annual tax rankings published by the city of Shangyu independently indicate, in our opinion, that Ozner’s 


net income was at least 74% less than reported.   


The city of Shangyu (Zhejiang province) publishes annual tax rankings, available to any investor online, 


recognizing the top tax paying businesses in its jurisdiction.  Included in each company’s rankings are the 


total amount of taxes paid for the calendar year (including income taxes and VAT paid).   


Ozner’s prospectus reported both the number of units produced from 2011 through 2013 as well as the 


cost of production on a per unit basis during this period.  As a result, we are able to calculate the total 


cost of production for each such year.  Because Shangyu Manufacturing was Ozner’s only 


manufacturer during the track record period, it should have been the sole subsidiary paying such 


production costs and thus should have been responsible for the associated VAT payments for the 


completed goods, allowing us to calculate the minimum VAT that Shangyu Manufacturing should 


have paid from 2011 through 2013.  Shangyu Manufacturing must pay VAT because, as the Company 


discloses in the Prospectus, it transfers title of the machines it produces to Ozner’s other subsidiaries for 


lease to end users.

 SAIC filings confirm that Shangyu Manufacturing does not retain title of the machines, as no such rental generating machines 


are listed on its balance sheet.

If Ozner’s reported financial statements are accurate, then we calculate that Ozner’s sole manufacturing 


subsidiary, Shangyu Manufacturing, should have paid approximately RMB 3.3mm, 8.7mm and 8.9mm 


in VAT in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 


Yet according to the city of Shangyu’s annual tax rankings, Shangyu Manufacturing paid only RMB 


2.27mm in 2013, paid only RMB 2.25mm in 2012, and did not appear on the list in 2011 (meaning it paid 


less than RMB 1mm in total taxes that year, including VAT).   


In our view, independent tax rankings produced by the local government indicate that Shangyu 


Manufacturing paid at least 74% less in taxes than should have been the case if the Company’s reported 


financials were accurate.

The city of Shangyu’s tax rankings are prepared by the local State Tax Bureau and include VAT and 


income tax by companies in Shangyu.  If the Company’s reported financials were accurate, then we 


calculate that Shangyu Manufacturing should have paid significantly more VAT than it did.   


 
 Source: 1. Glaucus estimate based on Ozner Prospectus 
 2. Shangyu City Tax Rankings, 2011, 2012, 2013 


We believe that local or provincial tax rankings, such as those referred to above, are a credible source for 


taxes paid in China.  For example, in our research on China Lumena (which is still halted since we issued 


our March 2014 research opinion), a similar tax ranking was, among other evidence, a telltale sign of 


misconduct.  Such lists are an invaluable tool for investors doing research on public companies, but they 


are rarely as decisive as they are in this case.   


Here, Ozner reported the supposed production costs of its manufacturing subsidiary, a claim directly and 


convincingly contradicted by the Shangyu city tax records.  Such government tax rankings indicate, in our 


opinion, that Ozner’s production figures and net profits were far lower during the track-record period than 


should be the case if the financials disclosed by Ozner were accurate.   


1) Why Does Ozner Not Pay Income Tax? 


Another facet of the Company’s tax profile undermines its reported financial performance.  Despite 


reporting an aggregate of RMB 795 million in revenue and RMB 277 million in net income from 2011 


through 2013, Ozner paid less than RMB 3 million in total income taxes during this period.

Ozner Water International Holding Ltd | HK: 2014 www.glaucusresearch.com 


Ozner’s explanation is deeply suspicious.  The Company explained that it did not pay income taxes 


because:  





“Income tax payable was primarily attributable to the timing difference in revenue recognition 


for accounting and tax reporting purposes. We recognize revenue of water purification services 


on a monthly basis over the one-year lease term for accounting purposes, whereas revenue 


reported to local tax bureau is revenue for which invoices were already issued to principal 


distributors. We typically issue invoices to principal distributors at the end of lease terms, 


which we believe is consistent with market practice for the leasing business.”
22








This explanation appears ludicrous.  Ozner claims that it leases water purifiers for 1-year terms, meaning 


that if tax liabilities accrued because of the ‘timing difference’ between the end of a lease and the calendar 


year, income taxes owed on leased machines would not be outstanding for more than 1 year (at the most).   





Yet Ozner’s income tax payables have supposedly increased from RMB 10 million at FYE 2011, to RMB 


34 million at FYE 2012, RMB 64 million at FYE 2013 and RMB 79.7 million at June 30, 2014.
23











Source: Prospectus, p. I-4. 





Over this time it has paid an aggregate of RMB 7 million in income taxes, less than 10% of what it owed 


as of June 30, 2014.
24


  Rather than a “timing difference,” the continuing accrual of tax liabilities suggests 


that Ozner simply does not pay its income taxes.    





In essence, Ozner claims that it is not required to pay income taxes because it has not yet invoiced its 


distributors, even though it has already received cash payments for leasing the machine and it has already 


recognized revenue for the transaction.  If Ozner’s explanation is to be believed, any company could 


simply defer taxes by not invoicing distributors for payments received on leased goods!  





We believe that the more likely explanation for the Company’s failure to pay meaningful income taxes is 


that Ozner has materially fabricated its reported profitability.  Rather than report that it paid high income 


taxes, a claim that could easily be rebutted by local tax authorities who might then investigate the 


Company over its taxes, we believe that Ozner simply made up a (weak) explanation for why the 


Company barely paid any income taxes during the track-record period.   





In our opinion, based both on our understanding of the PRC’s tax system and conversations with 


experienced accountants and auditors, the Company’s purported explanation is not credible and that its 


failure to pay more than RMB 3 million in income taxes over the track-record period (2011-2013) is 


simply additional evidence that the Company has significantly overstated its profitability.

OZNER’S MARKET SHARE QUESTIONABLE 


Consumer and industry surveys of China’s water purifying market call into question the Company’s 


claims regarding its market share, sales and the strength of its brand. Ozner claims in its prospectus to be 


the third largest water purifier manufacturer in China and the leader in commercial sales.   





Source: Ozner Prospectus, p. 1. 





Source: Ozner Prospectus, p. 83. 


According to Ozner, its principal competitors at the top of the water purifying market are Midea and 


Qinyuan.  The Company claims that it has a clear lead on other water purifying manufacturers, including 


Angel, Litree and Canature.  Yet independent data undermines such claims. 


1) Consumer Brand Rankings 


We found six different consumer and industry surveys in 2013 and 2014 produced by either consumer 


research centers or consumer brand websites.  Each survey lists the top ten brands of water purifying 


manufacturers.  Not one of the six surveys even lists Ozner among the top 10 brands, let alone in the 


top three as the Company claims.   





By contrast, each of the six surveys lists Ozner’s competitors Midea and Qinyuan as a top brand.  


Below we have provided links to each survey, the top ten rankings as reported, and details regarding the 


author of the survey and (where available) the methodology.

Ozner Water International Holding Ltd | HK: 2014 www.glaucusresearch.com 


These surveys are recent (2013 and 2014) and reputable.  If, as the Company claims, Ozner was the third 


largest brand by market share in the water purifying market and the leader in corporate sales, we should 


expect it to appear on the lists summarized above.   


Yet Ozner does not appear in the top ten (or appear at all) on any of the lists, even though its principal 


competitors (Midea and Qinyuan) are listed on each ranking.  Ozner claims that its sales exceeded sales 


by Litree and Angel by 16% and 23%, respectively, during the track-record period.
25


  Yet Litree appears 


as a top ten brand on 5 of the 6 surveys, whereas Angel appears as a top ten brand on 4 of the 6 surveys.  


Ozner claims that its sales exceed Canature’s by 92%, yet even Canature manages to appear in the top ten 


in 2 of the surveys.   


The two market share surveys which seems to validate the Company’s claimed market share are neither 


independent nor credible.  The Frost & Sullivan report quoted in the prospectus was paid for by the 


Company and prepared using sales data provided by Ozner.  The Company also reported that 


HC360.com named it a ‘top ten brand,’
26


 but that award was sponsored by Ozner (it is called the ‘Ozner 


Cup top 10 China Water Purification Brand’).
27





In our view, the six independent surveys undermine Ozner’s claimed market share, sales and the 


purported strength of its brand.   


2) Taobao and Tmall 


Similarly, Ozner’s purifiers do not even rank in the top 10 on Tmall or top 15 on Taobao, even if we limit 


our rankings to the category of purifiers which are supposedly Ozner’s most popular models.   On both 


websites, customers can see the ranking of products and the number of machines sold in the last 30 


days.
28


  This is a useful tool of comparing the popularity of brands.

On Tmall, we filtered the results for water purifiers to machines priced above RMB 2,000.  In the last 30 


days, Ozner’s purported competitors, Midea, Angel and Qinyuan, sell the top ranked purifiers, sales of 


which were in the hundreds. By contrast, comparable Ozner purifiers are not ranked and appear to have 


~100 total units sold.   


Taobao shows similar results: Ozner is ranked far behind Qinyuan and Midea and sales of its products are 


an order of magnitude smaller (~22) than its supposed competitors.  





Taobao 





Rankings on Taobao and Tmall corroborate the consumer brand surveys, indicating, in our view, that 


Ozner’s brand is far less popular than the Company claims.  Such rankings also support the validity of 


SAIC filings and tax rankings by indicating that Ozner’s production and sales are far less than reported to 


Hong Kong investors and regulators.

Ozner Water International Holding Ltd | HK: 2014 www.glaucusresearch.com 


ACCOUNTING SHENANIGANS: DEPRICATION 


Ozner’s most critical accounting assumption is a 10-year useful life for water purification machines 


leased out to customers on an annual basis.
29


  Because Ozner’s machines are depreciated on a straight line 


basis over the 10-year useful life of its machines, most of the production cost is not recognized 


immediately, but deferred over the life of the asset.  As such, depreciation expenses on leased purifiers 


accounted for 42% of Ozner’s COGS in FY 2013. 


But there is reason to doubt whether Ozner’s depreciation assumptions are reasonable.  A 10-year useful 


life assumption is in direct contradiction to historical useful life assumptions for leased Ozner-


branded water purifiers.  As discussed previously in this report, CGL leased and sold Ozner-branded 


water purifiers (including the same or similar corporate models for sale by Ozner today) from 2009 


through 2012.   


After acquiring the business, CGL directors carefully considered the useful lives of drinking water 


purification machines, including a careful estimation of expected usage, expected wear-and-tear, potential 


for technical obsolescence, and any future legal limitations.  CGL also considered the historical 


experience with such machines.  CGL concluded by reassessing the estimated useful life of the 


machines from 9 years to 5 years: 





Source: CGL 2010 Annual Report, p. 45. 





CGL was selling similar purifiers under the same brand designed by the same research team as Ozner.  


Yet their estimate for the useful life of Ozner’s machines was 5 years (and 50%) less than Ozner’s current 


accounting assumptions.

To give investors an idea of how sensitive Ozner’s purported financial performance is to this depreciation 


assumption, in the following table we compare the effect on COGS by adjusting the assumption to 7-yr, 


5-yr and 3-yr useful lives.  











Using CGL’s assumption for a 5-year useful life reduces 2013 net income by 36%, and this effect will 


only get larger as more and more of Ozner’s revenues are derived from purifiers purportedly in 


circulation. 


The impact on Ozner’s valuation is even more striking.  Simply by using CGL’s 5-year useful life 


assumption, at current multiples we calculate that Ozner’s share price is worth 39% less than its current 


price.

In this report, we have presented compelling evidence showing, in our opinion, that Ozner has materially 


misrepresented the scale and profitability of its business to Hong Kong investors and regulators.  But 


what is striking is that even setting such compelling evidence aside, Ozner’s shares appear 39% 


overvalued simply by correcting a depreciation assumption which materially contradicts the historical 


assumptions of the previous owners of Ozner’s business.

Ozner Valuation - By Useful Life
46 
 


Ozner Water International Holding Ltd | HK: 2014 www.glaucusresearch.com 


VALUATION 


Rarely does independent, publicly available evidence, converge so neatly to indicate (overwhelmingly), in 


our opinion, that a Company has materially misled investors, regulators and the market regarding its 


financial and operational performance.   





Ozner claims to be the third ranked producer in a highly fragmented sector, supposedly ranked just behind 


competitors and giant appliance conglomerates Midea Group and Qinyuan Group.
30


  In a highly 


fragmented appliance market such as water purifiers, we should expect intense competition between firms 


selling a relatively commoditized product.  There is little ability to differentiate between products (the 


technology for water purification appliances is relatively straight forward), so we expect firms to compete 


on price and terms, which should drive down margins and make it difficult to turn a robust profit.  





Yet, Ozner reports just the opposite: the Company claimed to generate 68% gross margins in 2013 (65% 


in 2012) and 46% EBIT margins in 2013 (43% in 2012).  These are margins worthy of a branded 


monopoly, such as Apple, which incidentally reports a 29% operating margin.  How can the sale of 


commoditized water purifiers (from a non-industry leader) be almost twice as profitable as the sale of 


differentiated, best-in-class high end consumer electronics sold by one of the world’s most famous 


brands?   





Today, the Company trades for 15.9x 2014 Annualized EBITDA of HKD 318.29 million as calculated 


below.  





We believe that there is a significant amount of credible, publicly-available evidence which suggests that 


Ozner’s real EBITDA is between 50% and 90% lower than reported.  We also believe that trading in 


Ozner’s share will be halted pending an investigation into such misrepresentations.

Ozner Water International Holding Ltd | HK: 2014 www.glaucusresearch.com 


In our opinion, the breadth of the Company’s misrepresentations are so significant that it will no longer 


trade at a 15.9x EBITDA multiple, but (at most) 8x EBITDA.  And we believe even such a multiple is 


extremely generous.  Furthermore, only a small amount of Company cash remains offshore (denominated 


in USD or HKD), the rest has been repatriated to the PRC where it is beyond the reach of Ozner’s foreign 


creditors and shareholders.  As a result, we estimate that Ozner is worth between HKD 0.27-0.85 per 


share, a downside of 76%-92% from today’s trading price.   





We believe that even a valuation of HKD 0.27-0.85 per share may be generous, as there could be 


significant downside pressure on the Company’s share price given, in our opinion, the scale of its 


misrepresentations.  We do not believe investors will ever trust Ozner again – nor should they.
