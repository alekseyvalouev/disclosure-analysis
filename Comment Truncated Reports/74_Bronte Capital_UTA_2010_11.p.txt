Travelling through time with the Universal Travel Group
Universal Travel Group just held an investor conference call to answer investor questions about their
business.  They answered some and left many unanswered.  However I just want to focus on one
thing:  the Chinese language websites.


They said the Chinese website running smoothly and that “we will try our best to maintain and
upgrade in the future.” 


That is good – because there are either a few “easter eggs” on the site or they are selling time-travel. 
I am going to show you how to book tickets for the 2007 Sinopec Formula 1 Grand Prix. 


First you go to the www.cba-hotel.com site.  Here is a screen shot.


I have used Google Translate to change this page to English.

I find Americans sometimes do not get
a British or Australian sense of humor.
 
If something on this blog makes you
really angry I suggest you read Swift's

At the top of the page are the key tabs – things you can do on this website – things like book hotels or
tickets.


The sixth tab – in a fairly prominent place – is for F1 tickets.  I pressed it – and translated to English. 
Here is a screenshot.

This is precisely as it seems – you can still buy tickets to the 2007 Sinopec Formula 1 Grand Prix.  (I
hope they let me bet on the race because I know the winner!)


This is from a site they maintain – and it is not deep in the site – it is a click on the main tabs on the
front page.   I made a Youtube video as well.

Still the company wishes to maintain the site in future – and 20 percent of their business comes from
these sites according to the conference call we just heard.  So maybe we will soon be able to rent a
