Short OSIR. Osiris Therapeutics Beset By

Summary
Since I last highlighted fraud concerns at Osiris, the stock has fallen by 40%. I
expect an additional 50% drop based on new catalysts.
The CEO has since resigned unexpectedly.
Osiris is unable to �le its 10K and has now received a NASDAQ de�ciency notice.
Last week, Osiris’ head of sales has just been charged with defrauding the federal
government.
Yet, Osiris still trades with a market cap of nearly $200 million.

Background on Osiris


The last time I wrote about (https://seekingalpha.com/article/3812496-osiris-aggressive-channel-stu�ing-
accounting-irregularities-outright-fraud) Osiris Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OSIR
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OSIR)) was in January 2016 when the share price was $8.50. At the time,SCROLL

https://moxreports.com/osiris-therapeutics-beset-by-newer-and-bigger-troubles/ 2/6


the stock was hitting what were then 52-week lows. As I noted in that article, I seldom drop the “F Bomb” (the
word “fraud”), but there are simply too many red �ags to ignore with Osiris.


Since that time, the shares are now down by around 40% to around $5.00. The shares did brie�y plunge to as
low as $3.55 (down 60%) before rebounding to the current level. I now see an abundance of borrowable
shares for shorting available at a very low rate, so I assume that the recent bounce was largely due to short
covering.


I continue to expect that the shares will soon trade down to the $2-3 range, based on additional catalysts
which were expected and which are now materializing. As expected, Osiris is now delinquent in �ling its
�nancials. As of its last �led �nancial statement, the company had approx. $1.23 in cash per share. (However,
based on its historical cash burn, the cash balance has almost certainly declined signi�cantly over the past 6
months). Osiris still has a market cap of close to $200 million.


In my previous article (https://seekingalpha.com/article/3812496-osiris-aggressive-channel-stu�ing-
accounting-irregularities-outright-fraud), I noted that the CFO had already resigned and been replaced. The
auditor had already resigned. Internal controls had been deemed to be ine�ective. The former auditor had
required multiple restatements of the �nancials due to revenue recognition issues. I also noted that I expected
that the annual report would not end up being �led as expected.


Recent developments


The recent bounce in the stock has now provided another excellent entry point for a short trade as the next
leg down begins. Following my last article, there have been several new developments, none of which bode
well for the future of Osiris.


First, shortly after my article, we saw that the CEO suddenly resigned
(https://seekingalpha.com/news/3085726-osiris-chief-exit-reinforces-problems-company) for “personal
reasons.” Again, this follows the prior resignation of the CFO and the auditor BDO. Following a month long
supposed “search” for a new CEO, Osiris simply appointed (http://dc.citybizlist.com/article/338412/osiris-
board-con�rms-dwayne-montgomery-as-ceo) existing Chief Business O�icer Dwayne Montgomery as the new
CEO. The fact that Osiris couldn’t (or perhaps wouldn’t) �nd any outsider to take the role should be viewed as
highly concerning.


Second, we saw that Osiris was unable to �le its annual report 10K (https://seekingalpha.com/news/3167845-
osiris-unable-�le-2015-annual-report-due-accounting-errors-shares-26-percent-premarket). Readers should
keep in mind that Osiris appointed Big 4 E&Y as its new auditor following the resignation of BDO last year.
This was to be E&Y’s �rst opportunity to audit the books of Osiris. As I highlighted in my last article, if there
was a problem (i.e. “fraud”), E&Y would �nd it and the 10K would not be �led. This is exactly what has now
happened. Osiris has now just received a de�ciency notice (http://www.orthospinenews.com/osiris-
therapeutics-receives-de�ciency-notice-from-nasdaq/) from the NASDAQ because it has not �led its 10K.


Finally, and most recently, Osiris has now lost its National Director of Sales and Marketing
(https://connect.data.com/contact/view/mrruV2FfakhzNdmWw-1JSA/todd-clawson), Todd Clawson following
charges that he defrauded the federal government. Sometime over the past few days, Clawson removed all
references to Osiris from his LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-clawson-135148a) and his name
no longer appears in the company’s phone directory.


As noted here (http://m.seattlepi.com/local/crime/article/Feds-Pharmaceutical-exec-VA-doctors-conspired-
6922295.php#photo-9633885) from March 18th:

Prosecutors claim Advanced BioHealing Inc. executive Todd Clawson and others paid kickbacks to VA
[Veteran’s Administration] podiatrists and clinicians who promoted the company’s product, a “biologic”
wound dressing. Clawson has been charged with bribery and health care fraud.


To view the government’s full criminal complaint against Clawson, click here (https://moxreports.com/wp-
content/uploads/TC_CriminalCharges_3.17.16-2.pdf). Clawson is set to be sentenced
(https://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/TC_Sentencing_3.22.16.pdf) on June 10th, but has not yet been
jailed.


The point is that Osiris’ problems are not limited to the C suite. Osiris has now lost the individual who is
responsible for actually selling the product as well.


As shown here in the New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/nyregion/dining-at-a-star-in-
queens.html?_r=2), Clawson is (“was”) was big winer and diner at Michelin star restaurants in New York,
entertaining doctors (prospective customers).


Conclusion


Since the time of my last article, shares of Osiris have declined by 40%, but previously declined to as low as
$3.55. I believe that the real decline is just beginning and that the stock should ultimately settle in at around
$2-3. That represents an additional decline from current levels of around 50%.


We have already seen the resignation of the CEO, the CFO, and the auditor. The head of sales has just been
charged with defrauding the federal government. Financials have already been forced to be restated and now
the company is unable to �le its form 10K annual report.


Despite all of this, the company still trades with a market cap of nearly $200 million.


Based on all of this, Osiris is a compelling short down to around $2.00.


Author’s note: Osiris management contacted the author and noted that Mr. Clawson had resigned from Osiris
and is no longer employed there. Mr. Clawson’s title at Osiris was apparently incorrect on various public sites
including LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, Connect.Data and the New York Times. Management notes that his correct title
should be listed as “Executive Director, Marketing and National Accounts”. Management also noted that the
criminal charges were against Mr. Clawson personally and not against Osiris. All details of the criminal
charges against Mr. Clawson can be viewed in the government’s criminal complaint, which was provided
above.
