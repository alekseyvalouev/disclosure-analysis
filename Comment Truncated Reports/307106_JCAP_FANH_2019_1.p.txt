 ‣ In a major restructuring last year, Fanhua claimed to 
have sold its P&C division. Actually, the company simply robbed public 
shareholders. It gave 11 of the 19 companies targeted for sale to a 
Fanhua executive and misreported the transfers as a sale to a third 
party. The remaining companies are either mere shells or were trans-
ferred to a company we suspect is related to Fanhua executives.


 ‣ We estimate that Fanhua moved at least $136 mln in 
2017 revenues off the books but still under executive control.


 ‣ In its life as a public company, Fanhua has regularly en-
riched its executives by buying companies from individual managers 
then divesting them again or simply gifting companies to managers, 
all without disclosure. In our report, we detail more than a dozen such 
cases, but there are many more.


 ‣ A new share compensation scheme, the 521 Scheme, 
has been used to justify paying $250 mln to company co-founder Lai 
Qiuping. We believe the plan is simply a diversion. It closely resembles 
the scheme that collapsed the company’s share price in late 2010. 1


 ‣ Our interviews in China indicate that Fanhua has guaranteed 
around ¥1 bln in financial products sold by Lai’s privately owned com-
pany. We believe these are undisclosed related-party transactions.


 1  Note: In this report, we use the Chinese format for names, in which the surname comes 
first. Fanhua disclosures may put the given name first, so Peng Ge in Fanhua disclosures is 
Ge Peng in our report. We do this to make it easier for third parties to check our informa-
tion, because we make clear which portion of the name is the surname.

 ‣ Fanhua developed a huge commercial real estate project in the 
founder’s hometown for more than two years without telling inves-
tors. Fanhua has been pre-selling residential units there for delivery 
in 2020—which puts the company on the hook to spend to build out 
those units. The project was finally mentioned, in passing, on a No-
vember 2018 company conference call.


 ‣ Investors are skeptical that regulators are doing their job in 
China—how much of this company’s value has been stolen? Based 


on the evidence, we believe this company is uninvestable.

Executive Summary
Fanhua (FANH) is a U.S.-listed, China-based company that claims primar-
ily to distribute insurance products. Before Q4 2017, most FANH income 
came from property and casualty insurance. In Q4, the company claimed 
to divest most of its P&C insurance business, as well as its insurance bro-
kerage business. Currently, the company is described in its disclosures as 
primarily a distributor of life insurance.  


Over the course of our months-long investigation of FANH, we concluded 
that Fanhua Inc. is nothing but a shell game among related parties that 
allows executives to loot investor cash. We detail how the executives run-
ning Fanhua have made undisclosed payments and loans to insiders, used 
“share incentive plans” to hand themselves cash, and covertly transferred 
equity in subsidiaries to ensure that investor cash goes into executive 
pockets. 


Most recently, executives stole a big chunk of the insurance business right 
from under investors’ noses, purloining companies that they had reported 
sold to a third party. We examined the financial statements of all 19 com-
panies Fanhua supposedly sold to a company called Beijing Cheche. Not 
only were most companies NOT sold to Cheche, but the biggest portion of 
revenue was given to a Fanhua executive.


The Cheche transaction was just one in a series of Fanhua deals that are 
not what they appear to be. Fanhua has regularly acquired shell companies 
belonging to undisclosed insiders. It has given away equity without dis-
closure. Our checks of public records show that Fanhua shareholders are 
not the owners of around half of the companies listed on Fanhua’s official 
website.2


The sale that wasn’t
On October 27, 2017, Fanhua announced that it would sell its P&C insur-
ance division for ¥220 mln, or $31.8 mln. The company said the buyer, Bei-
jing Cheche Technology, would pay $13.7 mln in cash and the balance in 
a note payable over three years with 8% interest. 3 Based on the financial 
statements of the target companies and on comparables, we calculate that 
this price is equivalent to 1x P/E.


The transaction was a fake. Fanhua gave Cheche only six of the 19 target 


 2 See appendices for brief descriptions of key executives and companies.


 3  Should Cheche fail to pay the second part of the consideration—which appears to be contingent 
upon achieving a certain revenue target—then the loan will convert back to Fanhua equity.

companies it listed in a sales contract attached to its 2017 20-F. Further-
more, we suspect that Cheche itself may be an undisclosed related party.


Eleven of the companies were given to a Fanhua executive. Of the remain-
ing two, one appears not to exist, and the other has been shifted to joint 
ownership by Fanhua and the “buyer.”


The share purchase agreement filed by Fanhua describes Cheche as a “third 
party” that “operates an online auto insurance platform.”

We visited the head office of the company that now owns 
most of Fanhua’s P&C businesses, supposedly sold to 
Beijing Cheche. That office is pictured below.

Fanhua claimed that it was selling the 19 target companies in order to 
focus on higher-margin life insurance sales. But this too was a lie. Fanhua 
continues to sell P&C, and the offloaded companies also sell life insurance. 
Nor can this be regarded as transitional: the transaction was completed 
more than a year ago, but when we called the 19 companies that Cheche 
“bought,” most said they still sold life insurance. One said that the majority 
of sales comes from life insurance.4 These facts further show the breadth of 
the fraud.


In fact, Fanhua’s own website supports our conclusion that the company 
lied about the sale, using it as cover to transfer prime assets to Fanhua 
management at a bargain price. The Fanhua Holdings website should rep-
resent companies owned by FANH, and yet several of the companies listed 
in the 2017 20-F as part of the sale to Beijing Cheche Technology are still 
on Fanhua’s website as the advertised agents for life insurance. For exam-
ple, Dongguan Nanfeng Jiayu was listed on the Fanhua Holdings website 
as of November 24, 2018 as the company handling life insurance sales for 
Dongguan, Guangdong. Fanhua reported that it sold that same company as 
part of the effort to offload P&C insurance sales.


Theoretically, the Fanhua China website should now show companies that 
exclusively sell life insurance. Several of the companies on the website 
post their revenues from life vs P&C insurance, but only one has a high 
proportion of life insurance sales. Shandong Fanhua Times reported ¥330 
mln in life insurance sales in January through August 2017 and ¥230 mln 
in P&C sales. Ironically, Shandong Times was among the companies sup-
posedly sold to Cheche.

A representative of one of the target companies supposedly sold to Cheche 
told us over the phone: (our translation) "I figure Cheche just wanted to use 
Fanhua's license to sell auto insurance. Our company is still Fanhua. There 
has been no acquisition, just a shift in selling auto insurance."


Even more stunning, employees we spoke with at nine of the target com-
panies supposedly sold to Cheche do not know they were sold. Two more of 
the target companies appear not to exist, and an employee at yet another 
told us the company has not been in the insurance business for a decade. 
Employees we reached at several of the companies had never even heard 
of the purported acquirer, Beijing Cheche. Others of the target companies 
emphatically confirmed that their companies had not been sold and contin-
ued to belong to Fanhua. One of the companies told us that it was soon to 
become “a direct subsidiary of Fanhua.” Another, said, "Actually, we are the 
Fanhua sales team."  5


In the sale, Fanhua said it valued the companies at ¥130 mln ($18.8 mln) 
more than their net asset value. We do not consider asset value relevant 
to a sales agency. Fanhua also said the divested companies would achieve 
a minimum of ¥2 bln--$287 mln—per year in revenue in each of the next 
three years. The wording is as follows:


The Target Company is an insurance agency specializing in the 
distribution of automobile insurance products and in good stand-
ing, with the capacity of achieving no less than RMB2 billion auto 
insurance premiums each year from 2018 to 2020.


We looked at the financial statements of a competitor to Fanhua in China, 
also an insurance sales agent, called Datong. That company has a net mar-
gin of 11%. If the companies that Fanhua divested earned 11% on ¥2 bln 
in revenue, they would make $31.4 mln per year in profit. In that case, the 
total consideration of $31.8 mln would represent approximately one year of 
company profit—a P/E ratio of 1x. Payment, furthermore, per the terms of 
the agreement will be received in three years at best. 


Clearly, there is something wrong.


We obtained 2016-2017 financial statements for all the companies on the 
Fanhua Target List, which can be found on Schedule 1, page 9 of Fanhua’s 
2017 20-F and in Appendix A to this report. Ostensibly, the sale was to

the revenue for the few companies that were transferred to Cheche.

The recipient of the 11 target companies is an executive named Yang Lin 
via his shell company called Sichuan Boxin Xinrui Network Technology.7 
The “headquarters” of Sichuan Boxin Xinrui’s parent company, called Bei-
jing Boxin Lintong, is pictured on page 6.


It is unclear whether Yang Lin’s Sichuan Boxin Xinrui actually paid any-
thing for the new subsidiaries. Neither Sichuan Boxin Xinrui nor its Bei-
jing-based parent company reported any revenue in 2016 or 2017, and the 
companies’ registered capital was insufficient to pay the purchase price. 
Instead, it appears that Fanhua simply gifted its own executive $95 mln in 
2017 revenue in just one transaction that it told investors was a sale to a 
third party. Adding the other companies given to Yang Lin in 2017-18, Fan-
hua gave away at least $135.9 mln in revenue to Yang Lin in 12 months.


A longtime executive of Cheche told us in an interview, “Cheche acquired a 
portion of Fanhua’s auto insurance, and Yang Lin also acquired some of the 
companies under Fanhua Times Sales and Service. Currently, those compa-
nies are owned by Sichuan Boxin Xinrui Network Technology.”

Yang Lin: a proxy for Fanhua management


So, who is Yang Lin? Not only did he get companies from the Cheche trans-
action, but Fanhua handed him several other companies, with total 2017 
revenue of $135.9 mln. 


Yang Lin is a longtime senior employee of Fanhua and is reportedly “very 
close” to Fanhua’s CEO. He may be acting as a proxy for the founders. He 
maintains a very low profile, but a government official we spoke with in 
Sichuan Province told us that companies Yang Lin registered there were 
registered by a “representative of [Fanhua founder] Hu Yinan.” 


A July 2017 article that appeared in a Chinese publication called East Mon-
ey described Yang as an executive who joined the Fanhua team in 2007. 
The article praises Yang Lin as the genius behind Fanhua’s success in the 
Sichuan region called Neijiang. Titled “Fanhua in Neijing: A Beautiful 
Two-Year Turnaround,” the first paragraph mentioning Yang Lin, from the 
article pictured below, reads as follows:


Starting August 1, 2015, Yang Lin, the new head of [Fanhua’s Si-
chuan] Neijiang platform, took office. From the construction of the 
platform to the development of the organization, in just over a year, 
the Neijiang platform fully covered three outlying counties and 
established not only the headquarters in Neijiang City but sales of-
fices in Zizhong, Longchang, and Weiyuan. In August 2015, there 
were only about 20 employees in Fanhua’s Neijiang area. In just two 
years, that number grew to 1,626 people.

Our interviews with Fanhua employees confirmed that Yang Lin is a Fan-

The company that acquired Fanhua subsidiaries in the Cheche transaction 
is called Sichuan Boxin Xinrui. Official documents for this company indi-
cate that it is headquartered in Sichuan, in the county of Renshou, which 


 8  Chinese government records additionally indicate that Yang Lin is responsible person of five 
Fanhua companies and shareholder of six that have been gifted assets by Fanhua.

same level and also has no revenue. It is very unlikely that this company 
could have paid $31.8 mln for the Cheche companies a mere 18 months 
after it was formed.


We went to the local government office in charge of the park to make sure 
we hadn’t missed anything. Officials in the office said there was no Sichuan 
Boxin Xinrui in the area. Yet we know from Chinese government records 
that Yang Lin established not only this but four other companies in that 
industrial park. SAIC records show that four of the five were established on 
the same day, April 13, 2016 and a fifth later on. We could find no traces of 
any of the five. That suggests to us that Yang Lin and Fanhua wanted shell 
companies in an accommodating jurisdiction that would not require them 
actually to maintain premises or pay taxes.


A longtime government official working in the office park in Renshou, Sich-
uan remembered the registration. He told us that the companies registered 
to Yang Lin had been established by “a representative of Hu Yinan.” This 
supports our suspicion that Yang Lin is a proxy for senior management.


We checked other locations in the industrial park in case Boxin Xinrui had 
moved. No one in the area had heard of the company.

Sichuan Boxin Xinrui has a parent company, in Beijing, called Beijing 
Boxin Lintong. Here is the company’s government registration record:


Like Sichuan Boxin Xinrui, Beijing Boxin Lintong reported no revenue and 
no employees in 2017. Like its subsidiary, registered capital is $728,000, 
not enough to pay for the companies acquired by its subsidiary. We visited 
Beijing Boxin Lintong’s registered address, but, like its Sichuanese subsid-
iary, Beijing Boxin Lintong had no operations. Staff and neighbors in the 
office park in Beijing said no such company had ever operated at the prem-
ises.

“I don’t know anything about a sale”
To understand the Cheche sales transaction, we telephoned all 19 compa-
nies listed in the Fanhua 2017 20-F "target list" appended to the contract 
with Beijing Cheche. 


Four of the companies could not be found or had all numbers disconnected. 
One company told us “Actually, we are Fanhua.” Another said that they 
were not supposed to talk about the transaction to outsiders. “There has 
been no acquisition, just a shift in selling auto insurance," said another. (See 
Appendix B for detail)


Is Cheche related to Fanhua?
Just a handful of the target companies went to the designated buyer, 
Cheche, whose name literally means “Car Car.” So, who or what is Cheche?


We believe that Cheche may not be quite as arm’s-length a buyer as adver-
tised; in fact, it could be an undisclosed related party. We found that one 
of the owners of Cheche, called Shenzhen Ruiyuan Investment Company 
(Limited Partnership), was registered at the same Shenzhen address at 
approximately the same time as Fanhua subsidiary Qunabao and Fanhua 
co-founder Lai Qiuping’s investment vehicle Chengchuang (Shenzhen) 
Investment Co. Ltd. This supports our view that Cheche could be related to 
Fanhua. The shared location is not itself proof of a connection; the address 
accommodates hundreds of companies. But the investor behind Ruiyuan 
had previously invested in Cheche then pulled out and formed Ruiyuan for 
the sole purpose of re-investing in Cheche.9


 9  The Ruiyuan founder, Xiong Dan, invested in Cheche in December 2014. He sold his shares a 
few months later. Right after selling his shares, on June 18, 2015, Xiong Dan established a part-
nership called Shenzhen Ruiyuan, and Shenzhen Ruiyuan invested in Cheche on July 24, 2015, 
one month after the partnership had been founded.

To see whether Shenzhen Ruiyuan does anything other than hold the in-
vestment in Cheche, we went to Shenzhen. But Shenzhen Ruiyuan has no 
staff, no phone, and has not kept its registration current with the govern-
ment. This is common with fraudulent companies, which exist to facilitate 
capital transactions but not to engage in business.


The fact that this investor in Cheche is co-located with Fanhua and Fan-
hua-related companies provides an additional piece of evidence supporting 
our view that Cheche has an undisclosed relationship to Fanhua. There is 
more: Three of Cheche’s operating companies in Guangzhou share an office 
with two Fanhua companies and a company owned by Fanhua co-founder 
Lai Qiuping.


This is the Shenzhen government agency that handles registration and bookkeeping for 
companies for a fee and where six Fanhua subsidiaries have their registered addresses. 
Shenzhen Ruiyuan Investment Co., an early investor in Cheche, also has its registered 
headquarters here, as does Chengchuang, the fund management company owned by Fanhua 
founder Lai Qiuping. | Photo by J Capital December 7, 2018

Cheche’s website (www.chetimes.com) has several photos of Cheche’s office. 


In November 2018, our investigator visited the office of Fanhua Times, 
which had supposedly been divested to Cheche in October 2017. At the of-
fice address, 601-09, No. 195, Guangzhou Ave, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou,10 
our investigator was unable to find any location that looked like the photos 
on the website. The investigator also could not find the name and/or logo 
that Cheche uses on its website. Instead, the office displayed Fanhua’s logo. 
We can only conclude that the company used stock images on its website 
to hide the fact that the office is still under the control of Fanhua.


Our investigator found several of the “Cheche office” images on websites of 
separate unrelated companies.

Not the first fake transaction
The Cheche transaction was only one of many Fanhua deals that are not 
what they appear to be. Yang Lin, the executive who took over 11 of the 
companies purportedly sold to Cheche, has regularly received companies 
from Fanhua without disclosure of a related-party transaction. In 2017-18, 
Fanhua made undisclosed transfers to Yang Lin of four other companies 
in addition to the 11 transferred as part of the Cheche transaction. Those 
were Wenzhou Huilian, Shenzhen Nanfeng, Beijing Ruisike Management 
Consulting Co. Ltd., and Fanhua Bocheng Insurance Brokerage Co. Ltd.


 ‣ In January 2017, Fanhua reported divesting Beijing Ruisike Manage-
ment Consulting Co. Ltd. to a third party. The company was actually 
transferred to Yang Lin.

 ‣ On July 10, 2018, Fanhua transferred Shenzhen Nanfeng Insurance 
Co. Ltd. to Yang Lin’s Sichuan Boxin Xinrui. Shenzhen Nanfeng 
Insurance had been founded by Fanhua CEO Wang Chunlin and was 
purchased by Fanhua in 2014.


 ‣ On August 3, 2018, Fanhua transferred Wenzhou Huilian Insurance 
Agency to Yang Lin’s shell company Sichuan Boxin Xinrui. Fanhua 
made no disclosure. Fanhua had acquired Wenzhou Huilian Insur-
ance for ¥16 mln in 2014.


 ‣ On August 21, 2018, Fanhua announced that it was divesting Fan-
hua Bocheng Insurance Brokerage Co., Ltd. to a third party. In real-
ity, Fanhua Bocheng was given to Yang Lin’s shell company Beijing 
Boxin Lintong.


We obtained tax records for Shenzhen Nanfeng, Wenzhou Huilian, and 
Fanhua Bocheng Insurance Brokerage. Their 2017 revenue was $30.3 mln, 
bringing the 2017 revenue of companies transferred to Yang Lin’s owner-
ship to $135.96 mln.


Round trip
The Bocheng transaction is textbook legerdemain that took assets from 
Fanhua investors and put them under control of undisclosed related parties 
that we believe are proxies for top management. It worked like this:


1. In January 2017, Fanhua reported divesting a subsidiary called Bei-
jing Ruisike Management Consulting Co. Ltd. to a third party.11


2. In April 2017, Fanhua transferred Beijing Ruisike Management Con-
sulting to Yang Lin.


3. In November 2017, Fanhua reported disposing of Fanhua Bocheng 
Insurance Brokerage to a third party. The disclosure from Fanhua’s 
20-F is as follows:


In November 2017, the Group disposed of Bocheng to a third party 
for a total consideration of RMB46,582. And the consideration re-
ceivable was further offset by the other payables to Bocheng . . . The 
Group recognized loss of RMB904 on the disposal of this subsid-
iary. (page F-28, Fanhua 20-F filed April 20, 2018. Numbers are in 
thousands.)


 11  “In January 2017, the Group disposed of Beijing Ruisike Management Consulting Co., Ltd to a 
third party.” (2017 20-F page F-28, filed April 20, 2018).

4. Fanhua Bocheng was actually transferred to Beijing Ruisike Man-
agement Consulting and Beijing Boxin Lintong Technology Co. Ltd. 
By this time, Yang Lin owned both companies.


5. On November 22, 2017, Yang Lin transferred his equity in Beijing 
Ruisike Management Consulting to Liu Tingting. This transaction 
was undisclosed. Liu Tingting calls herself a Fanhua employee, and 
we believe she is a stand-in for top management. 


In this way, both Beijing Ruisike Management Consulting and Fanhua Bo-
cheng Insurance Brokerage were removed from the Fanhua balance sheet 
and are now privately controlled by Fanhua executives.


So who is Liu Tingting, who now owns 
two companies that Fanhua “divested” 
in 2017 and 2018? Three separate inter-
views in Beijing confirmed that she is a 
Fanhua employee. Furthermore, in Liu 
Tingting’s social profile, she calls herself 
“Fanhua Finance Sales Director.” A job 
ad for Ruisike, Liu Tingting's company, 
says that Ruisike has "the managerial 
strengths and capital of the Fanhua 
Group."

the floors, 7, 9, and 20, were occupied, though we could not find people in 
the offices on a Friday afternoon. All three offices displayed the sign “Fanhua 
Insurance Services.” There was no sign for Beijing Ruisike.


Beijing Ruisike appears to exist on paper only, but its subsidiary, Fanhua 
Bocheng, seems to be going strong. In fact, it still operates as Fanhua—
it’s just not owned by Fanhua anymore. Beijing Bocheng’s web page says 
that the company is owned by Fanhua. This text from the About Us page of 
Bocheng’s website, accessed on January 4, 2019, reads as follows:


“Fanhua Bocheng Insurance Brokerage Co. Ltd. (hereafter called “Fanhua 
Brokerage”) was established on January 12, 2005 and is headquartered in 
Beijing with ¥50 mln in registered capital. The company has already devel-
oped into a leading comprehensive insurance brokerage platform.”


These transactions rob shareholders of value. 


Lining the Founder’s Pockets
Last June, Fanhua launched a share compensation scheme that we believe 
is a decoy for self-enrichment. To kick off the plan, Fanhua purchased 8.5 
mln shares from its co-founder, Lai Qiuping, at $29 per share, giving Lai 
$246.5 mln, ostensibly in order to create a “bank” of shares that can be 
awarded to employees in the future. 


We do not believe employees will realize a benefit. The incentive plan is 
probably illegal in China and therefore not really intended to be imple-

mented. And Fanhua has a history of stiffing employees on these share 
schemes. Fanhua has not explained why it needs to purchase all shares for 
the incentive plan outright, instead of having employees purchase them 
directly. And Fanhua has only barely enough cash to make the purchas-
es. Fanhua spent fully 78% of its cash and cash equivalents to purchase 
shares. Finally, the price paid to Lai is too high: the trading price of the 
shares has been as low as $21 since June. Fanhua shares are currently trad-
ing at about $23.


Last June 15, Fanhua announced the “521 Development Plan” to award 
shares to employees as incentive for meeting sales targets over the com-
ing five years. We obtained a copy of the Power Point presentation given to 
employees to encourage them to join.


521 is very unusual for an equity incentive plan. It establishes three funds 
that each will purchase 14 million shares of the Nasdaq-traded stock. Fan-
hua is providing loans to support the exercise price of the shares, which is 
$29. Employees are to pay 8% on the loans, in cash.13


 ‣ We believe the plan is illegal: It is technically illegal under China’s 
foreign-exchange rules for Chinese citizens to own foreign company

shares, unless the ownership is approved by the State Administration 
of Foreign Exchange. The necessary approvals are not transparent, 
and to our knowledge, have never been granted. Foreign companies 
frequently structure their plans to provide "phantom" stock option 
grants, i.e. the right to receive the difference between the strike price 
and the exercise price of a stock option. Technically, that spread is 
supposed to be given to employees in Renminbi and is subject to 
standard individual income tax rates. Although these rules have not 
often been observed, direct share grants are probably not legal.


 ‣ Why the private transaction? Fanhua could have bought shares on 
the open market, which would have benefitted all shareholders. 


 ‣ The loan component also looks illegal: As part of the 521 Plan, Fan-
hua reported that it would grant up to $365.4 mln in loans to its own 
employees at 8% interest to fund their purchases of the shares. This 
is firmly illegal in China. Interest-bearing loans to employees are 
considered “illegal fundraising,” while extending loans in Renminbi 
to fund assets that are priced in dollars is a foreign exchange activity 
permissible only to government banks.


 ‣ The share awards are contingent, but the shares have been purchased 
outright: To be eligible for the share incentive plan, managers must 
achieve certain thresholds of life insurance policy sales starting with 
1.2 mln and going to 5 mln per year. That there are targets suggests 
that not all participants will be eligible for shares, yet Fanhua has 
pre-purchased the shares for the incentive plan.


The plan itself invites potential participants to become “franchisees” and 
tells them that they may choose between joining Fanhua and running 
their own company. This would seem to contradict the company’s assertion 
that it owns all the agencies directly. Slide 11 reads:


Fanhua’s Entrepreneurship System


Five characteristics:


1. Being an entrepreneur makes you happier
2. High performance bonuses
3. Employment for life
4. The benefits for joining the franchise are good

And four additional points:


1. You are the customer
2. The team is yours
3. The team can be inherited
4. The team can be handed over


In brief, Fanhua represents itself to investors as a directly owned insurance 
sales team. But the company represents itself to outsiders as a network of 
independently owned companies flying one corporate banner. 


We offer two alternative explanations for the mysterious 521 Plan: 


 ‣ Maybe Fanhua does not actually have the cash it claims. A curious 
line on the balance sheet, called short-term investments, ballooned 
from ¥688 mln in 2014 to ¥2 bln in 2015 without explanation and 
despite slow revenue growth and anemic cash generation. We cannot 
understand how Fanhua can generate that much cash on such low 
profitability. If Fanhua were overstating its cash balance, using the 
phantom cash to “buy shares” from Lai, this might be one convenient 
way to remove it from the balance sheet. 


 ‣ Fanhua may want to book 8% interest income on the loans that Fan-
hua advertises it will extend to participating employees, an amount 
that should garner around $20 mln per year. The company has said it 
would lend $365 mln toward the share options. 


Déjà vu all over again
The “521 Development Plan” looks a lot like the share incentive scheme 
that torpedoed Fanhua’s share price in 2010-11. 


Fanhua, formerly called CNInsure (CISG US), has consistently found itself 
unable to offer both attractive sales compensation and high profits that 
would send the share price higher. Consequently, Fanhua concocted a com-
pensation scheme that it kept secret from public investors and failed to 
book as a cost.


In 2010, a research company called OLP found that Fanhua had issued 
equity incentives to its managers without disclosing the arrangement to 
investors. After the detailed report came out, Fanhua vehemently denied 
the share plan despite ample evidence from Fanhua’s own website.

In spite of the continued denials, after issuance of the OLP reports, Fan-
hua’s reported growth and margins collapsed, suggesting that canceling 
the share incentive plan had exposed Fanhua’s operating reality. Net in-
come declined by 171% in 2011 compared with 2010, falling to negative 
¥299 mln (-$43 mln). By 2016, net income was still just 37% of what had 
been claimed in 2010.

negotiate Chinese minefield,” published on November 29, 2011 claimed 
that a private equity investor had spent $10 mln on due diligence then 
backed out of the deal.


The 521 Development Plan looks very much like the share incentive plan 
that Fanhua failed to disclose in 2010. 


The promise of future share compensation may have raised apparent profits 
by diverting bonus or commission. With 0 revenue growth in 2017, Fanhua 
reported 169% growth in profit. That profit came principally from a 56% 
decline in selling expenses—even though the company more than doubled 
its headcount of sales representatives, from 231,592 to 579,348.14


Fanhua assures its employees that the company is putting resources into 
the share incentive plan, which they call the “happy struggle plan”:

Enriching insiders, stiffing shareholders
The Cheche sale was only the latest in double dealings by Fanhua, which 
habitually enriches its executives by giving them investor-financed loans, 
equity in affiliates, or cash. In the bullet point below, we list 14 historical 
examples, but they are far from exhaustive.


Fanhua says that it directly owns 100% equity in all of its insurance inter-
mediary companies. This is patently untrue. The company disclosed that 
its restructuring began in 2011 and was undertaken because of a regula-
tory change in China that made it easier for a foreign-owned firm to own 
insurance agencies. “. . . in October 2011 we commenced a restructuring 
of our company which resulted in us obtaining direct controlling equity 
ownership in all of our insurance intermediary companies.” (Page 15, 2015 
20-F)


Then, in a 6-K filed on May 25, 2016, the company reported:


As of date, except for two insurance agencies and the claims adjust-
ing operation, we have completed acquiring the minority interests 
of all of our insurance intermediary companies.


But this is not true. Post May 2016, we identified nine employees with 
shareholdings in 33 Fanhua companies. This is far from an exhaustive list 
and does not count employees with independent companies that engage 
in undisclosed related-party transactions with Fanhua. Here are just a few 
examples:

sible for shareholders to understand what they actually own. In the case of 
Hubei Fanhua, there are six layers of companies between CNInsure Hold-
ings, the ultimate parent, and Hubei Fanhua, and 11 different Fanhua enti-
ties have interests in the Hubei company. Furthermore, the equity shifts 
around year to year.


While the fact that there are minority interests is often disclosed, Fanhua 
does not tell investors that the minority owners are Fanhua employees. The 
self-dealing has gone on throughout the history of the company.

founder of Fanhua’s Puyi Fund company. He is described in this BBS 
post as a top executive of Fanhua.17


 ‣ A former Fanhua vice president called Xue Kai owns 12.5% of Hebei 
Fanhua. Xue Kai is a senior executive officer whose term ran from 
January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. In various interviews that 
have appeared in the Chinese press, company executives described 
Xue’s role as driving a newly consolidated life insurance business. 
According to our interviews in the insurance industry in Hebei Prov-
ince, Xue founded an insurance sales agency in Hebei in 2005 and 


 17  Fanhua originally owned 10% of Hebei Fanhua. It bought an additional 41% in 2009 (FANH 
6-K filed March 3, 3010) without disclosing how much it had paid, and, in 2015, it acquired an ad-
ditional 36.5% of the equity interest for a total consideration of $6.5 million in cash and a 12.5% 
share of profit or loss in the Hebei operations (FANH 6-K filed May 20, 2015).

joint ventured with Fanhua in 2009. Chinese government records 
show that he is a current or past owner or executive of 17 companies, 
of which at least seven are Fanhua companies.


 ‣ In 2008, three executives of Hunan Fanhua Insurance Agency were 
granted 45% of the company’s equity.


 ‣ In the province of Hubei, Fanhua similarly compensated executives. 
Fanhua established Hubei Fanhua in 2004 as a wholly owned subsid-
iary and then hived off 40% of the equity for executives Zhu Jiusheng 
and Long Yubo. Fanhua bought back the equity from them in Decem-
ber 2015, according to Chinese corporate records.


 ‣ Between December 2015 and September 2016, Fanhua purchased 
equity in five Fanhua companies from Long Yubo, who was described 
in 2015 as a vice president of the fund company and holds his equity 
via a Tianjin-registered company called Tianjin Jingxu. 


 ‣ In August 2009, Fanhua purchased equity in Jilin Fanhua from com-
pany executives Long Yubo and the fund founder Sun Conghai. Fan-
hua sold the equity again in 2014 to an individual named Wang Yu. 
The company’s name was changed to Jilin Ronghao Insurance.


 ‣ In July 2010, Fanhua paid about $13 mln to acquire limited “prefer-
ence rights” to Shenzhen InsCom E-Commerce, a company whose 
ultimate beneficiary appears to be Fanhua CEO Wang Chunlin.18


 ‣ In 2011, the company paid its co-founder and president Lai Qiuping 
about $7.9 mln for two companies he owned, Guangzhou Huajie and 
Dongguan Zhongxin, which Fanhua then divested in 2016 for about 
$30,000. 


 ‣ In February 2013, Fanhua purchased equity in Sichuan Fanhua Xin-
tai Insurance from executive Zhu Jiusheng.


 ‣ In June 2014, Fanhua purchased Nanjing Yukai Insurance from Sun 
Conghai.


 18  See FANH 6-K filed July 30, 2010 page 6: “. . . CNinsure will acquire 65.1% equity interest 
in InsCom for RMB84 million. Meanwhile, as part of the corporate restructuring of InsCom, 
CNinsure’s equity interests in six of its affiliated property & casualty insurance agencies will be 
transferred to an affiliated subsidiary of InsCom in exchange for preference shares newly issued 
by InsCom. With the preference shares, CNinsure is entitled to all of the profits of InsCom for a 
certain period and reserves the right to require InsCom to redeem the preference shares.”

 ‣ In July 2015, Fanhua purchased equity in Changsha Lianyi Insur-
ance and Ningbo Baolian Insurance from Sun Conghai


 ‣ In October 2015, Fanhua bought equity in Shandong Daoxing Mintai 
from Sun Conghai and sold it the next year to Shandong Dongsen 
International Holdings.


 ‣ In December 2015, Fanhua bought equity in Henan Fanhua Anlian 
from Sun and Zhu.


 ‣ In 2016, Fanhua disposed of Guangzhou Huajie Insurance Agency to 
its co-founder, Lai Qiuping. Fanhua had purchased the company in 
2011 for ¥25 mln. The company has not disclosed the disposal as a 
related-party transaction.


 ‣ In January 2016, Chinese records show that Fanhua transferred its 
equity in Hebei Fanhua Insurance Agency Co. Ltd., with six branch-
es, to two private owners. The owner of 87.5% of the equity is a Fan-
hua executive, even though the company is identified on the Fanhua 
Holdings website as a Fanhua subsidiary.


 ‣ In 2016, Fanhua bought Fanhua Century Insurance Agency from a 
holding company owned by its CEO, Wang Chunlin.19


 19  Chinese SAIC records show that Fanhua Insurance Sales Agency Group Corp. acquired Shen-

 ‣ Fanhua has extended ¥500 mln in loans to Shenzhen Chuangjia 
Investment Limited Partnership, owned by company executive Yu 
Haifeng, 


 ‣ In July 2018, Fanhua sold or transferred its wholly owned subsid-
iary Guangzhou Yian Insurance Agency to Yang Lin’s Boxin Xinrui. 
Fanhua Times had injected capital in April 2017. The company’s last 
disclosure about this company was in 2012.


Fanhua made the loan to Shenzhen Chuangjia without disclosing that Ch-
uangjia is a related party. The disclosure in the 2017 20F is as follows:


This (other receivables RMB 513 million) represented loan to Shen-
zhen Chuangjia Investment Partnership Limited ("Chuangjia") of 
RMB500 million and corresponding interest receivable RMB13.18 
million. The loan is secured by the 99% equity share of Chengdu 
Puyi Bohui Information Technology Limited ("Puyi Bohui"), a major 
operating subsidiary of Chuangjia, with interest rate 7.3% per an-
num.


Our investigator visited Shenzhen Chuangjia and found that it displays the 
CNFinance logo. The company is headquartered at its 1901, Luohu Busi-
ness Center, No. 2028, Shennandong Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen.20


Based on Chinese government records, Shenzhen Chuangjia is 99.99% ben-
eficially owned by Yu Haifeng, the CEO of Puyi Inc., a P2P platform associ-
ated with FANH.


FANH did not disclose the relationship between Chuangjia and FANH even 
though Chuangjia is controlled by Yu Haifeng, who is the CEO of a related 
party. Therefore, Chuangjia is actually an undisclosed related party to 
CNFinance and also FANH. 


Fanhua’s official website in China lists the major subsidiaries in each prov-
ince as well as a few cities. There are 210 companies listed. We looked up 
the registration records of most. The majority are either not owned by Fan-
hua at all or have equity holders who are individuals. 


For example, randomly choosing Wenzhou in Zhejiang on “The Fanhua 
organization” portion of the Fanhua website, the life insurance company 
listed is Wenzhou Huilian Insurance. This company is owned by Yang Lin.

Fanhua shareholders are not the owners of around half of the companies 
listed on Fanhua’s official website. The companies sold to Cheche are still 
displayed on the site, with addresses and phone numbers. In Guangzhou, 
Guangzhou Huajie is shown as a sales agency, and yet this company is 
wholly owned by Lai Qiuping.


Undisclosed guarantees
Our interviews indicate that Fanhua is paying handsome returns to one of 
its founders for capital raised from the public. Fanhua employees and for-
mer employees we interviewed confirmed that Fanhua guarantees financial 
products issued by Lai Qiuping’s Chengchuang (Shenzhen) Investment Co. 
Ltd. We have identified 41 such investment products. Funds offered to the 
public have to be registered with China’s securities regulator, and the fund 
minimum issuance value is ¥10 mln. That means that total issuance is at 
least ¥400 mln ($58.3 mln). But we believe that Lai’s company has raised 
several times that amount. A Fanhua interviewee told us that the guaran-
teed products outstanding have principal of “at least ¥1 bln ($147 mln)” and 
that Fanhua guarantees returns of 6.8%-8.5%.


Fanhua explicitly claims it does not issue guarantees. On page 67 of its 
2017 20-F, the company says “We have not entered into any financial guar-
antees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of 
third parties.” But four separate longtime employees of Fanhua told us that 
the company does guarantee Lai’s products. A sales agent also confirmed 
this and said the guarantee is in the purchase contract but that employees 
are not permitted to disclose the contract except to paying clients.


Some of this money appears to have been channeled into pre-IPO shares 
of Fanhua subsidiary CNFinance; although employees selling the Cheng-
chuang funds did not know the specific investment targets, several of the 
investment products return as much as 150% to retail investors, accord-
ing to Chinese government notices, and we cannot think of an investment 
other than pre-IPO shares that could reach that rate of return. But, given 
that Fanhua guarantees 8.5% on products issued for two years, the ¥1 bln 
or more should properly be recognized as debt and should be disclosed as 
such. 


The “private equity” securities have bland names, like “Chengchuang M&A 
Fund No. 3.” But our interviews indicated that the money is all being chan-
neled into Fanhua to promote sales growth. 


Chengchuang tells investors that its funds return as much as 144%. Below 
is a liquidation notice issued on September 28, 2018 for the “Chengchuang

M&A Phase 6 Equity Investment Fund,” launched May 19, 2016. The no-
tice reports that the fund returned 143.74% to subordinated investors and 
45.66% on the preferred tranche.


A mid-level employee at Fanhua told us the following in an interview (our 
translation): “Chengchuang Funds was founded to raise money for Fanhua 
Group. The principal use of funds is to support various Fanhua business 
units in their effort to achieve a listing in the United States.” This was cor-
roborated in a second interview. Four other interviews confirmed that Fan-
hua guarantees both principal and returns on Chengchuang private equity 
funds.


Longtime Fanhua employees told us that “most” of the Chengchuang 
funds raised are invested in Fanhua. We have seen three Chengchuang 
fund liquidation notices signaling fund payouts, and each reported returns 
over 42% to preferred investors. Salespeople confirmed that this return 
is typical. Whether or not Fanhua itself has paid returns of that level to 
Lai’s company, Fanhua’s guaranteed 8.5% return constitutes both undis-
closed debt and an undisclosed related-party transaction. In other words, 
the Chengchuang financial products are yet another way in which Fanhua 
management has lined its own pockets.


Several interviewees told us that the Chengchuang financial products all 
raise money for Fanhua subsidiaries. Those comments support our view 
that Fanhua is desperate for cash and that the cash balances reported in 
the company financial statements may not be reliable.

Fanhua’s secret real estate development
Fanhua has undertaken a massive commercial real estate project in Ren-
shou, the county about 70 kilometers from Chengdu where company found-
er Hu Yinan was raised and that is host to at least five phantom Fanhua 
companies. Fanhua has not disclosed the investment except in the most 
general terms. Fanhua formed a 51-49% joint venture real estate develop-
ment company on July 19, 2016 to develop 14 buildings with a construction 
area of 336,499 in the “Tianfu New Area.” Fanhua and contributed just over 
¥10 mln in capital but made no mention of the Tianfu project until Novem-
ber 5, 2018, when Fanhua issued a 6-K announcing that its life insurance 
operation had completed its relocation to Tianfu.


FANH is a 51% (majority) owner in this joint venture, which has not been 
disclosed. This should prompt the company’s auditors to ask why the JV 
was not consolidated in FANH’s financials. The company described the JV 
by saying: 


“In addition, persuaded to its policy of attracting investment to de-
velop the local economy, in 2016 the Renshou County government 
in which the Tianfu New Area is situated, expressed its support for 
Fanhua to publicly bid for a parcel of land in the Tianfu New Area 
to establish a back-office center. As Fanhua had neither a license nor 
interest in real asset development, on July 16, 2016 Fanhua estab-
lished a joint venture with an independent third party real-estate 
developer Sichuan Tianyi Real Estate Development Company for 
the sole purpose of developing the parcel of land. Under this ar-
rangement, Sichuan Tianyi will be responsible for developing the 
land and providing all funding for the development, while Fanhua 
will not provide any loan guarantee or any other funding for the 
development. Upon completion of the real estate development, Si-
chuan Tianyi would keep all the profits from the sales of the devel-
opment properties and Fanhua will have a right to purchase cer-
tain properties at a discount. As of today, the project is still under 
development.”21


We found it ridiculous that FANH is involved in, or may benefit from, this 
transaction, as they clearly disclose they:

2. Will not provide “any other funding” for the development 
3. Don’t have a license
4. Don’t have an interest in real estate development


Despite FANH’s statement that they’re not funding the project, our due 
diligence has led us to believe that they are likely contributing capital to it, 
unbeknownst to FANH’s investors.   


We became aware of the existence of this real estate investment and the 
details of this project back in the summer of 2018, during the course of our 
on the ground due diligence. Prior to the November 2018 conference call, 
FANH had never disclosed that it had a real estate investment associated 
with its relocation with Fanhua Lianxing. 


Fanhua has undertaken the project in a joint venture with a Sichuanese 
developer called Tianyi Real Estate, and the housing is already being pre-
sold, with earliest delivery scheduled for December 2020, according to our 
interviews with salespeople. 


But the project website says that Fanhua Inc. is the developer.

closures, in 1999, they began to sell automobile insurance products and 
automobile loans.  
 
In 2009, Guangdong Nanfeng Automobile Association changed its name

scribed Yang Lin as an executive who joined the Fanhua team in 2007. 
Our interviews with Fanhua employees were divided on his affiliation. One 
interviewee said Yang Lin was a Fanhua executive, but others said that he 
was “very close” to the company and to Fanhua CFO Ge Peng.


In June 2015, Fanhua also created a joint venture with a company that 
Yang Lin had established nine months earlier. The company was called 
Beijing Bopai Tongda. Fanhua has exited the company, but we have been 
unable to find any disclosures.


In 2014, according to Chinese corporate records, Yang Lin established Bei-
jing Baoping Software as a technical platform for insurance sales. Barely 
one year later, Fanhua invested in the company and Fanhua CFO Ge Peng 
became chairman. 


Yang Lin also owns three businesses based in the small Sichuan county 
where Fanhua founder Hu Yinan is from and where Fanhua is building a 
huge residential real estate project.


Two published accounts say that Yang Lin took over a Sichuan branch of 
Fanhua in 2015 and built it from 20 people to 1,626 in just two years, with 
comparable revenue growth.


Yu Haifeng
Yu Haifeng is chief representative or majority 
owner of several asset management compa-
nies owned by Fanhua that generally go under 
the name Puyi. He also owns a company called 
Renshou Puyi Corporate Management Center 
in Renshou, Sichuan, where Fanhua is relocat-
ing its headquarters. This article says that Yu 
started Puyi on Fanhua's behalf. Three Fanhua 
employees confirmed to us that Yu is a Fanhua 
executive.  Yu is also owner of Shenzhen Ch-
uangji Investment Partnership, to which Fan-


hua extended loans in 2017 without disclosing them as loans to a related 
party.


Zhu Jiusheng
Fanhua executive and owner of Shanghai Miaofeng Investment.
