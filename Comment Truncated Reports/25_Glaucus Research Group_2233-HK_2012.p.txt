We believe that West China Cement Limited (HK: 2233) (“WCC” or the “Company”) is a blatant fraud.  In July 2011,
Moody’s Investor Service released a report identifying red flags in the corporate governance of certain Chinese compa-
nies.  Moody’s found the most flags at WCC, a cement manufacturer operating in China’s Shaanxi province that pur-
ports to be one of the most profitable cement companies in China.  In this report, we pick up where Moody’s left off and
present compelling evidence that WCC is falsifying its publicly filed financial statements.


1.  Fictitious Margins.  We believe WCC’s margins are fabricated.  Despite the fact that WCC sells a commodity in a hyper-
competitive market, its margins are 2000 basis points above their H-share, A-share, and local competitors.  


a.  Smoking Gun SAIC Filings.  Management claims its dominance of the areas south of Xi'an allows it to earn
higher margins.  But it appears that WCC has misrepresented the profitability of its southern factories, as 2009 SAIC
filings show that WCC’s primary southern cement facility (Ankang Yaobai) earned a gross margin 1400 basis points below
the reported Company average.  


b.  Low Average Sales Prices (“ASPs”).  Management explains its celestial margins because it charges "premium
prices" for cement.  This is not true.  Evidence from Digital Cement and WCC’s own filings show that between
2008 and 2011, WCC's ASPs have averaged 3% below the Shaanxi mean selling price.


c.  Customary COGS.  Cement is not rocket science.  85% of the costs of making cement are raw commodities such
as limestone, coal and electricity.  Independent data from the Shaanxi province confirms that WCC pays about the
same as its local competitors for the majority of these primary inputs, meaning that cost savings cannot explain the
Company’s margin advantage.  


d.  No Cheating at Monopoly.  WCC claims a near monopoly in the areas of southern and eastern Shaanxi.  But
evidence from a trusted independent source, Digital Cement, shows a host of undisclosed competitors in these areas. 


e.  2011 Price War Exposes the Absurdity of WCC Margins. In 2011, a Shaanxi-province price war drove re-
gional cement prices to the lowest in China. At least 40% of Shaanxi cement manufacturers lost money; the rest likely
struggled to break even. Despite WCC's larger peers selling cement throughout China at much higher ASPs, WCC
claimed to lead Chinese players with a reported EBITDA margin of 36% even though it sold cement almost exclu-
sively in Shaanxi. This is simply not credible.


f.  2011 Factory-Level Margins Contradict Reported Figures.   WCC makes its actual net profit margins avail-
able for four WCC plants in 2011.  The data directly incriminates management in a fraud.  In each of WCC's core mar-
kets during the price war of 2011, disclosed or otherwise estimable factory-level margins averaged a net loss of (7%),
even though the Company reported a net margin of 21%.


g.  Eastbound and Down.  WCC tells investors its core markets in the east and south are remote and protected from
competition from central Shaanxi.  Due diligence calls to WCC’s competitors demonstrated exactly the opposite: that
cement factories in the hyper-competitive central area of the province are willing to serve customers up to at least 180
km away.  This means WCC's relevant market share in its most important market, Weinan (35% of total capacity), is 22%,
not 100% as management claims.  The same analysis goes for WCC's other core markets.  This is not surprising as mod-
ern highways and tunnels cut through the mountains between central and southern Shaanxi.

2.  Suspicious Acquisitions.  WCC appears to be massively overpaying to acquire money-losing cement factories.  We
suspect that such transactions are secret payments to related parties.  


a. Overpaying for Money-Losing Facilities.  Between late 2010 and 2011, three of WCC’s larger competitors,
including industry leader, Anhui Conch, appear to have acquired cement factories in Shaanxi for an average of
RMB 60 per ton of annual capacity. During that same time period, WCC acquired three money losing ce-
ment factories and one barely profitable factory for an average price of RMB 349 per ton, a 479% premium
on the prices paid by these competitors.


b. Shifeng Hustle.  We sent an investigator to the registered address of the largest reported shareholder of a ce-
ment factory recently acquired by WCC – a man who allegedly received over RMB 244 million. Yet his regis-
tered address showed a grimy dormitory for a water treatment plant, suggesting that rather than being a
wealthy factory owner, he was merely a front man and possibly a conduit for an undisclosed payment to insiders.  


3.  Madoff-like Pyramid Financing. A hallmark of an obvious fraud is that management pursues expensive financ-
ing alternatives despite purportedly being flush with cash.  In May 2008, WCC borrowed RMB 420 million at an effec-
tive interest rate of 20.23% despite allegedly generating cash flow from operations of nearly RMB 1 billion between
January 2008 and December 2009.


4. Suspicious Operating Metrics. Off-market operating metrics often portend artificially inflated sales or cash. In
WCC's case: 


a. Selling and distribution expenses: 1% of sales vs. 5% average for China comps
b. Average interest income rate on cash: 0.42% vs. >1% for Anhui Conch
c. Accrued VAT payables: bear no correlation to sales or VAT refunds


5.  Abnormally High Auditor and Management Turnover. The high turnover of auditors and key managers since
2008 supports our suspicion that WCC's financial statements are doctored.  


Since 2008
Auditors 4
CFOs 3
Chairmen 3


Worse still, WCC replaced its CFO and its auditor in a two-week period in the spring of 2011. If that does not scare an
investor, then they are either brave or ignorant.


6.  Who Watches the Watchmen? Corporate Governance Figureheads Tainted by Past Scandals.  WCC’s audit
chair and corporate secretary have tarnished corporate governance records.  


a.  Audit Chair.  The Chairman of WCC's audit committee, Lee Kong Wai Conway, also served on the audit com-
mittee of scandal-ridden Sino Vanadium (TSX: SVX), whose share price collapsed under suspicion of fraud.


b. Secretary.  The core duties of a Chartered Hong Kong Secretary are to oversee corporate governance and com-
pany disclosures.  Between 2006 and 2010, WCC’s Secretary, Sin Lik Man (“Mr. Sin”), was responsible for corpo-
rate governance at Norstar Founders Group Limited (2339 HK) (“Norstar”).  Norstar’s share price collapsed 80%
in 2008 under a cloud of fraud.  Since then it has been tied up in litigation.  Such a disgrace should have ended Mr.
Sin’s career.  Instead he found a home at WCC ‘protecting’ investors. 


7.  Valuation. As of June 30, 2012, WCC had approximately HK$5 billion of debt outstanding, the holders of which would
take priority over shareholders. Given the difficulty of recovering money against alleged fraudsters under China’s corrupt
and arbitrary judicial system, we believe that off-shore (i.e. non-PRC) debt holders can at best hope to recover
$0.20 on the dollar (see our detailed valuation section at the end of this report), putting the value of the equity at
$0.00.

INTRODUCTION 
 
West China Cement Limited  (“WCC” or the  “Company”)  is a cement manufacturer operating almost exclusively in 
the Shaanxi province.  WCC first went public on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market 
("AIM") in 2006.    Despite  China’s  frothy growth at the time, London investors  never  bought  into  WCC’s  story,  and  
the  Company  fled  to  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  (“HKEX”)  in 2010 with the parting quip from the chairman 
that  “British investors don't  really  understand  China.”     
 
Perhaps British investors understood China all too well.  In July 2011, Moody’s  Investor  Service released a report 
identifying red flags in the corporate governance at 21 Chinese companies.  Moody’s  found  the  most  red  flags  at  
WCC.   
 
This is staggering considering that WCC had even more red flags than Sino-Forest (TSX: TRE), which collapsed 
spectacularly last year after Muddy Waters exposed it as one of the largest frauds of all time, costing investors 
billions.     Moody’s   also   branded  WCC  with  more   red flags than Winsway Coking Coal (HK: 1733) and Chaoda 
Modern Agriculture (HK: 0682), which saw trading of its shares halted under allegations of fraud.1  But according to 
Moody’s,  WCC  had the most red flags. 
 
Following  the  release  of  the  Moody’s  report, WCC’s share price plunged.  But  WCC’s  share  price  recovered  (until 
recently) to its IPO-range and stands as a shining example of the short-term memory possessed by the denizens of 
Wall Street.  After nearly 8 months investigating the Company (by a team of 8 analysts with expertise in finance, 
law  and  accounting),  we  believe  that  WCC’s  reported  performance  is  simply  fabricated. 


 
Despite selling a commodity in a country saddled with massive overcapacity of cement manufacturers, for the last 
four years WCC has claimed to be one of, if not the most profitable cement maker in China; WCC’s  margins  are  
roughly 2000 basis points above their H-share, A-share, and provincial competitors' averages. 
 
The Company’s   management   has   boasted   that   its   superior   profitability   is   driven   by   the   ‘premium’   price   WCC  
receives for its cement.  But independent sources show that this is simply not true.  Rather than selling a premium 
product,   WCC’s   ASPs   appear to have averaged 3% below the provincial average.  In addition, data from the 
Company  and  from  respected  independent  sources  shows  that  WCC’s  costs  are  in  line  with  its  competitors.  It  clearly 
neither sells a premium product nor makes a commodity for cheaper than its peers.  This implies that WCC’s  
purportedly impressive performance is a sham.   
 
SAIC filings corroborate this conclusion.  2009 SAIC data for what should be the Company’s   most   profitable  
factory show margins 1400 basis points below the margins reported in WCC’s  public  filings.     
 
We also have serious concerns that management may have already stripped the company of its cash, primarily via 
acquisitions at above-market prices.  Recently, WCC has paid an average of 479% more than its competitors to 
acquire cement factories in Shaanxi.  Our investigations have shown that the registered seller of one such factory 
acquired by WCC appears to be a front man.  We infer that the real seller is likely to be a related party and that the 
acquisitions have been used as a way to siphon cash from WCC and its shareholders and creditors.  Why else would 
WCC have taken out loans at an eye-popping interest rate of 20% when it supposedly had significant cash available 
from operations? 
  
We believe that Hong Kong regulators should take immediate action against the Company to protect Chinese and 
global investors.

I. MARGINS FIT FOR A SUCKER 
 
China produces more cement than every other country in the world combined.2  According to a May 2011 Equity 
Research Report prepared by the Bank of China (who, by the way, serves as one of WCC’s  principal  banker),  the  
national   average   cement   price   “stagnated over the past decade (0.7% CAGR and up only 9% during 2000-
2010)”  because  the  industry  was  “dogged by overcapacity.”3  
 
Because cement is a commodity, we would not expect producers to maintain a significant margin advantage for very 
long.  But amazingly, WCC has consistently boasted EBITDA margins that are, on average, 2000 basis points 
above its Chinese competitors.   
 
The   Moody’s   report   was   also   suspicious   of   WCC’s   reported   margins.      Yet   in   a   conference   call   responding   to  
Moody’s   allegations,  WCC’s  management   claimed   that   “our  margin   is normal.”     We  could not agree more.  We 
believe   that  WCC’s  margins  are  most  certainly “normal”  and  substantially  below  the  Company’s  reported  
margins.  But there is no denying   that   WCC’s   reported margins greatly exceeded margins reported by other 
Chinese cement companies.  
 
The   following   chart   shows   the   average,   from   2008   to   2011,   of   WCC’s EBITDA/ton of cement produced, as 
compared to its much larger, more scalable HKEX-listed peers.  The size of the markers in the graph below 
corresponds to the respective size of each company (measured by average tons of cement produced from 2008-
2011).  Notice that WCC is comparatively tiny, yet vastly outperforms its peers. 
 





WCC is much smaller than its peers and is therefore unable to benefit from the same economies of scale available to 
its competitors.  Despite this, WCC’s   EBITDA/ton   ratio suggests it is by far the most profitable cement 
manufacturer.       
 
Below, WCC’s  EBITDA  margins  are compared against its H-share and A-share listed competitors.  These charts 
depict a story of incredible dominance in a highly competitive and commoditized space.

Even more peculiar, WCC’s reported gross margins easily trounce those of local competitors in the Shaanxi

management  in  WCC’s  public  filings,  to  find  out  more  about  the  Chinese  cement  business.

SAIC FILINGS SUGGEST BLATANT MISREPRESENTATION 
  
WCC operates almost exclusively in Shaanxi province.  By most accounts, Shaanxi is a tough place to sell cement, 
as overcapacity has caused cement prices in the province to fall to the lowest in China (see page 14).  While cement 
factories are sprinkled throughout Shaanxi, the main hub of modern, high-volume factories are located in the hyper-
competitive center (Baoji, Xianyang/Xi'an, and Tongchuan) for two reasons: the central area is the hub of the 
province’s  economic and industrial activity (roughly 60% of cement demand is located there) and the central area is 
a good base to serve customers in the outlying regions.   
 
Paradoxically, WCC’s  management has justified its suspiciously amazing performance by claiming dominance of 
niche markets in the southern part of Shaanxi province.  WCC claims that such niche markets are somehow immune 
to the cutthroat competition of the hyper-competitive central Shaanxi market.  The following excerpt is pulled 
directly  from  the  Company’s  2010  Hong  Kong  Prospectus  (pg.  136): 
  


 
 
Accordingly, we would expect WCC's Ankang Yaobai facility to show significantly above average gross margins 
and average  sales  prices  (“ASPs”) in 2009 because, of the Company's primary plants in 2009 (Pucheng, Lantian, 
and Ankang), Ankang Yaobai was the only cement plant located in Southern Shaanxi.4   
 
Yet according to SAIC filings (excerpts reproduced in Appendix I), the gross margins for the Ankang Yaobai 
facility were a mere 28%, which were 1400   basis   points   below  WCC’s   reported   average.   Not   surprisingly,   the  
Ankang SAIC margins were more on par with the Shaanxi average gross margin (ex-WCC) of 23%.   
 
 





In 2009, Ankang  Yaobai  was  WCC’s  only full-time facility  operating  in  WCC’s  core  market  of  Southern  Shaanxi.    
According to management, Ankang Yaobai should have been   driving  WCC’s   purportedly outstanding financial 
performance   and   carrying   the   load   for  WCC’s   other   factories   in   the   hyper-competitive area of central Shaanxi 
(Xi’an).     Yet Ankang Yaobai earned gross margins only slightly above the Shaanxi average.   
 
The Ankang facility accounted for 26% of production in 2009. If the Ankang facility's profitability, as shown in the 
SAIC filings, was correct, WCC's other facilities would had to have achieved 47% gross margins, more than twice 
the Shaanxi average, to meet the gross margin figure reported  in  WCC’s  public  filings.    
 
This would have been virtually impossible.  WCC’s  other  facilities operated in areas with more competitors.  Simply 
put, SAIC filings suggest that WCC lied about its profitability.  Further evidence of misrepresentations abound.   


                                                 
4 WCC  added  a  small  facility  (Zhen’an)  in  August  of  2009  which  accounted  for 5% of the Company’s 2009 
production.

WCC HAS BELOW-AVERAGE ASPs 
 
WCC reports spectacularly high margins – much greater than its peers over   the   last   four   years.     Management’s  
explanation  for  such  magical  performance  is  that  WCC  maintains  a  “price  premium”.  Yet this is not true. 
  
Based on data obtained from Digital Cement, WCC's ASPs were, on average, 3% lower than the average ASPs for 
cement in the Shaanxi province from 2008-2011.  
 


 
  
Rather than benefiting from premium pricing, it appears that WCC sells cement for less than the Shaanxi average.  
This finding makes sense, given that WCC sells the majority of its cement to distributors instead of directly to 
customers:   


WCC’s  Customer  Mix5 
 


 
 
If the Company's world-beating margins cannot be explained by higher prices, in order to hit its reported margins 
then WCC must be producing cement for much cheaper than the field. Yet this does not appear to be the case.

WCC’s  COGS APPEAR IN LINE WITH PEERS 
 
The primary inputs in making cement, which together typically account for 85% of  a  manufacturer’s  costs,  are: 


 Coal 
 Electricity 
 Raw Materials (limestone, gypsum, fly ash, clay, and other commodities) 


 
A closer look  at  WCC’s  COGS shows that it pays roughly the same amount of money for its primary inputs as its 
peers,  meaning  that  cost  savings  cannot  explain  the  company’s  massive margin advantage over its competitors.  We 
have assembled the following  data  from  the  Company’s  filings  and  compared  it  with  data  we  obtained  from  Digital  
Cement and other independent sources. 
 
Since 2008, it appears that WCC’s  coal  and  electricity costs have been essentially in line with the market.

Raw Materials (32% of 2011 WCC COGS) 
 
It   is   next   to   impossible   to   justify  WCC’s   margins   on   the   grounds   that   it   obtains   commodity raw materials for 
significantly less than its competitors.  Shaanxi is a mountainous area rich in natural resources, containing some of 
the biggest limestone (around 8% of COGS6) inventories in China.  
 
WCC’s  supply  chain  for  raw  materials  is  typical  of  cement  producers  in  the  province:  the  Company sources fly ash 
(4%) from local coal power stations, it sources gypsum (4%) and iron powder (1%) from neighboring provinces and 
it sources limestone (8%) from  Shaanxi’s  ubiquitous  quarries. 
 
Its  costs  might  be  even  higher  than  average  in  the  Company’s  core  markets.    According  to  its  filings, WCC claims 
its supposedly higher-margin southern facilities like Ankang Yaobai incur above average limestone costs given the 
extra distance the raw material must be transported by conveyor belt over difficult terrain. 
 
That said, WCC does claim to employ a cost saving measure of dubious significance.  According to the Company, it 
lowers  costs  by  employing  “residual  heat  recovery  systems.”    Yet  this  is  a  basic  technology,  and  while  it  may  give  
WCC   an   advantage   over   tiny   Shaanxi  mills,   we   doubt   that   the  Company’s   larger,   national   competitors   have   not  
heard of basic  recirculation  techniques.    In  fact,  most  of  WCC’s  factories  are  built  by  Sinoma,  a  national,  vertically-
integrated  conglomerate  that  produces  cement  and  is  one  of  WCC’s  top  competitors  in  the  Shaanxi  province.  It   is  
near impossible for WCC to claim a technological advantage when its competitor builds its facilities. 
 
In  sum,  WCC’s  cost  structure  appears  almost   identical  to  that  of  other  domestic  and  provincial  cement  producers,  
and is unable  to  account  for  WCC’s  purportedly  decisive  cost  advantage.     
 
If WCC sells cement for less than its competitors, and the costs of its input are more or less the same, how does the 
Company  generate  such  an  enormous  margin  advantage  over  its  peers?  We  believe  it  doesn’t  and  that  management  
is simply lying.

NO CHEATING AT MONOPOLY 
  
WCC’s   management   explains   its   abnormal   margins   on   the   grounds   that   the   “deployment   of   [WCC]   production  
facilities allows [the Company] to establish a dominant market position in our core markets at Weinan, Ankang, 
Hanzhong and Shangluo regions  in  Shaanxi.”7  How  does  this  explain  WCC’s  superior  performance  compared  to  its  
competitors?  In   a   recent   management   presentation,   the   company   said   “our   core   markets   in   Southern   Shaanxi  
(Shangluo, Ankang, Hanzhong) have enabled us to maintain price  premiums  compared  with  Central  Shaanxi.”8   
  
Management assembled the following chart to convince investors of its dominant market position. 
 
 
 


 
 
 
In order to confirm our suspicion that management has been misrepresenting the competitive nature of the Shaanxi 
cement business, we asked Digital Cement, the same company quoted by WCC in its filings as the authority on 
cement in China, to give us a list of cement companies in Shaanxi.   
 
WCC would have investors believe that there are only 5-6 relevant players in the province, but according to Digital 
Cement, there are over 85 undisclosed competitors in the region, many of which are located in the South and East 
where WCC allegedly "dominates".    
 
We assembled the following map of cement producers in Shaanxi from data provided by Digital Cement, which 
anyone can access with a subscription.  Note that according to Digital Cement, every facility on this list produces at 
least 70,000 tons of cement per year.

Digital Cement’s List of Shaanxi Cement Producers 
 





 
   
Digital Cement is a trusted source for cement data in China and WCC repeatedly refers to it in its public filings.  
This map, based on a list of cement producers in Shaanxi provided by Digital Cement in June 2012, shows a glut of 
independent producers in the regions in which WCC purportedly claims dominance.  
 
We have assurances in writing from Digital Cement that despite some smaller capacity being taken out of the 
province between 2008 and 2011, the list provided to us is up to date and at least 99% of the blue dots above are 
operational as of December 2011.

In addition, Digital Cement also published that over 48% of the cement factories identified in the map above were 
losing money as of April 2012 (up from 40% in 2011), which further supports our primary contention: that far from 
operating in isolated bliss in a magical land of remote customers and above market prices, WCC operates in a 
brutally competitive landscape with an over-supply of cement manufacturers.  
 
Rather than disclosing the true nature of its business, or the cut throat nature of making cement in Shaanxi, we 
believe that WCC simply lied to the market about its financial performance and justified it on the grounds that it was 
supplying  cement  to  customers  in  ‘remote’  regions  of  China,  betting  that  investors did not know any better.
15 
 


LIES,  DAMNED  LIES  and  …  WCC’s  2011  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS 
 
In 2011, competition between producers in Shaanxi was so intense that Shaanxi’s  cement  prices  fell  to  the lowest in 
China.  Prices fell so low in Shaanxi that at least forty percent of Shaanxi cement producers lost money and the 
rest likely struggled to break even.  Yet WCC still claimed an incredible 36% EBITDA margin.   
 


 
-Source: Digital Cement, Nomura Research January 2012 


 
More suspiciously, WCC easily beat its H-Share and A-Share competitors, even though such competitors were 
selling cement in provinces with higher prices (as shown in the chart above) and WCC sold cement almost 
exclusively in Shaanxi.   
 
 


 
 
A price war in the province where WCC did almost all of its business should have ravaged the company.  Instead, 
WCC still claimed to be virtually tied with Anhui Conch, a company 15x its size, as the most profitable publicly 
listed cement company in China in 2011.

2011 FACTORY LEVEL MARGINS 
 
Evidence that WCC is lying about its profitability abounds. Even though the Company claimed to achieve a 21% net 
profit margin in 2011, data from the Company’s   filings   and   other   independent   sources   suggests that many of its 
plants (including those in the reportedly most profitable areas) suffered an average negative 7% net margin.   
 
The net margin  data   assembled  below  was   in  most   cases   buried   in  WCC’s   filings (and in one case taken from a 
report  from  an  analyst  with  a  ‘buy’  recommendation  on  WCC).    Investors  should  find  it  staggering  that  a  number  of  
WCC’s  plants  in  remote  areas  (supposedly  the  Company’s  core  strength)  lost  money  in  2011.     
 


 
 
 
In the chart below,  we  overlaid   the  net  profit   figures  onto  a  map  of  WCC’s  cement   factories  by  region.     Keep   in  
mind that WCC claims to achieve staggering profitability because of its purported dominance of the remote markets 
circled below.

The chart above begs the obvious question: which region enabled WCC to achieve a 21% net margin in 2011? It 
certainly was not the outlying provincial regions as the company claims, because according to WCC’s  own  filings 
and an independent source with  a  ‘buy’  recommendation, it’s most remote plants either barely broke even or 
lost money in 2011.

EAST BOUND AND DOWN 
 
Typically, the service radius for a cement factory is 300 km.10 Yet WCC claims that it can maintain an enormous 
advantage in a country that has more cement capacity than any country on earth because its southern and eastern 
Shaanxi markets are isolated from the glut of cutthroat competitors in central Shaanxi (most of whom sit less than 
250 km from WCC plants).  According to WCC, due to its mountainous topography, southern Shaanxi lacks a 
transportation network and is thus isolated from other regions; providing a natural barrier to entry from competitors 
and allowing WCC to reap high ASPs (and thus high margins).  Convenient theory for WCC, but it is not true. 
 
WCC would like investors to believe that cement factories in the hyper-competitive central region (Baoji, Xianyang 
and Tongchuan) cannot serve customers in the east (Weinan) and the south (Hanzhong, Ankang, Shangluo), thus 
allowing WCC to maintain a dominant market share and pricing power.   
 
But from  WCC’s  own  filings,  we  know  that  cement  factories  in  Shaanxi serve customers anywhere from 150 km to 
250 km away from the factory.  WCC's 2007 annual report shows that its southern and eastern factories serve central 
Shaanxi, and that each cement factory has a service radius of roughly 250 km.  Below is the map, straight from 
the  Company’s  filings,  with  the  service  radii  for  its  factories. 
 


 
 
If  WCC’s  remote  Shaanxi  factories  can  serve  central  Shaanxi,   then  surely   the  hyper-competitive market of central 
Shaanxi  can  serve  WCC’s  supposedly  protected  markets  in southern and eastern Shaanxi. 
 
Further support for large service radii comes from the very first page of WCC's 2006 AIM prospectus, in which the 
Company states that products from its Pucheng facility are "predominantly sold" in three cities, including Yan'an, a 
278 km drive north. WCC even maintained a sales office in Yan'an! Shaanxi roads have only gotten better since 
2006.

Moreover, a 2009 filing by WCC boasts that its recently  acquired  Hanzhong  plant  is  “strategically  placed  to  supply  
projects   not   only   in   southwest   Shaanxi,   but   also   in   neighboring   Sichuan   and  Gansu.”     Gansu border cities are 
roughly 150 km from the closest Hanzhong factory.   
 
If  we   take  management’s   representation   as   to   the   service   radii   of   its   cement   factories,   and   put   them  on   the  map  
recently disseminated by management to convince unwitting investors of near monopolies in the eastern and 
southern  regions,  we  see  that  WCC’s  factories are not at all immune to competition from Baoji, Xi'an/Xianyang 
and Tongchuan.  
 
The  map   below,   based   on   radii   of   service   provided   by   management,   shows  WCC’s   competition.      It   shows   that  
WCC’s  cement  factories  are  within  the  service  areas  of  hyper-competitive modern producers in central Shaanxi.   
 


WCC Management Map - 180 km Radius Overlay 


 
This chart shows that management has been misrepresenting its market dominance to investors.  Far from having a 
monopoly   over   purportedly   ‘remote’   regions   of   the province, WCC’s   cement   factories   compete   directly   with  
factories in the central areas of the province, all of which are hyper-competitive environments replete with 
unused cement making capacity.   
 



http://www.westchinacement.com/eng/ir/rns/rns090331.pdf
20 
 


This map also corroborates the SAIC filings and ASP data discussed  above:  if  WCC’s  allegedly  protected  cement  
factories in reality compete with the glut of cement producers flooding the central Shaanxi market, then WCC 
should not maintain any type of margin advantage over its peers.   
 
In fact, management admits that price changes in Central Shaanxi are devastating prices all across the province. This 
directly conflicts with management's claims of "dominating" its core markets due to their distance from central 
Shaanxi. 
 


 
      - WCC 2011 Annual Report, page 14 


 
 
Like the rest of China, southern Shaanxi has been commissioning infrastructure projects at a torrid pace, connecting 
the more remote areas   to   the  provincial  hub  (Xi’an),  and  allowing   the   free   flow  of  goods.     For  example,   the  G65  
road connects Ankang (the  location  of  one  of  WCC’s  allegedly  remote  and  inaccessible  cement  plants)  to  the  central  
hub  of  Xi’an.    These modern highways cut right through the mountains. 
 
 


 
 
There is more.  Located in Southern Shaanxi, the 11-mile Zhongnanshan Tunnel is the longest two-tube road tunnel 
in the world. When it opened in 2007 at a cost of $US 410mm, the tunnel reduced travel times from Xi'an to 
Southern Shaanxi by over two hours. 
 


 
 
 
There are also major rail lines throughout Southern Shaanxi; one line connects, for example, Xi'an to Ankang.   



http://www.bukisa.com/articles/93253_worlds-most-spectacular-tunnels
21 
 


 
In  order  to  show  investors  that  WCC’s  allegedly  remote  facilities  in  Ankang,  Hanzhong,  Tongchuan  and  Weinan  are  
not nearly as remote or secluded as management would have them believe, we simply asked Google Maps the drive 
time  between  the  hyper  competitive  areas  in  central  Shaanxi  (Xi’an).     
 
 


Weinan to Tongchuan – 2 Hours
22 
 


Ankang  to  Xi’an  – 3 Hours 
 





Hanzhong to Baoji – 5 Hours 
 


 
The most remote location is only 278 km drive from central Shaanxi, while allegedly remote areas such as Ankang 
and Weinan are three hours and two hours respectively from the hyper-competitive provincial center.
23 
 


WEINAN BLOODBATH 
 
A perfect  example  of  management’s  bald  faced  misrepresentations  is  the  Weinan  Region,  where  management  claims  
a "100% market share" following its dubious acquisitions of the money-losing Fuping and Shifeng plants (see 
section below).  
 
We called a number of competitors in the Xianyang and Tongchuan areas of Central Shaanxi posing as a customer 
in Pucheng, Weinan. We asked them if they could deliver cement to our factory, and they said yes.  An Anhui 
Conch factory in Qianxian said they deliver to our area, 180 km away.   
 
In  the  table  below,  we  calculated  WCC’s  actual  market  share  in  Weinan,  including  the  competitors  that  deliver  to  
customers within its service radius.   
 


 
 
In reality, WCC's Weinan plants comprise only 22% of the modern cement capacity within a 180 km radius of 
Pucheng, the nexus of WCC's Weinan cement activities. 
 
All of this evidence shows exactly what we suspected: that the Shaanxi province is hypercompetitive, and that prices 
in the southern and eastern parts of the province are not immune from overcapacity in the center.

II. SUSPICIOUS ACQUISITIONS 
 
Moody’s  expressed  concern  that  WCC’s  chairman  and  his  daughter  dominate  the  Company  by  owning  44%  of  its  
stock.  In response, management claimed that such ownership concentration was not a red flag but a good thing, and 
that investors would be more worried if the chairman reduced his ownership stake.  WCC completely missed the 
point: a pump and dump is not the only way to defraud shareholders.  Many companies that have collapsed under 
allegations of fraud, including China Biotics (CHBT), Rino International (RINO) and China Education Alliance 
(CEU), had insider ownership of between 41% and 63%.  
   
Often, fraudulent companies ambitiously invest in acquisitions and capital expenditures to secretly funnel 
money out of the public vehicle and into the hands of insiders.  This can be far more lucrative than merely selling 
shares.  In this case, WCC paid a massive 479% premium over the market price to add capacity, raising the specter 
that public funds were diverted to undisclosed related parties.   
 
Between 2006 and 2012, WCC raised RMB 5.7 billion from debt and equity holders and reportedly generated RMB 
3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. Of this RMB 8.8 billion, 86% was spent on capital expenditures and 
acquisitions.  Only a pittance (2%) was paid back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
 


 
 
Despite reporting RMB 3.1 billion in cash flow from operations, WCC's cumulative negative free cash flow was 
(RMB 1.9 billion), primarily due to heavy spending on capital expenditures.   
 
Suspiciously, WCC paid a massive 479% premium over the market price to add capacity, raising the specter that 
public funds were diverted to undisclosed related parties.   
 
Shaanxi cement prices fell to new lows in 2011 and early 2012 as overcapacity led to a price war while coal input 
costs were hitting new highs (see section above).  Shaanxi cement companies were losing money hand over fist, with 
as many as 40% of the cement producers in the province reporting losses.  During this time, WCC's competitors 
scooped up Shaanxi cement factories for an average price of 60 RMB per ton.  Anhui  Conch,  WCC’s  rival  cement  
firm, even acquired a 9 million-ton-per-annum factory in Shaanxi for RMB 50 per ton (see Appendix II).

As the chart above shows, WCC did not seem to notice the price war because the Company continued to purchase 
cement plants for an average of RMB 349 per annual ton of capacity, a 479% premium over the price its 
competitors were paying to acquire cement capacity in the province.  Most suspiciously, WCC acquired a 65% interest 
in the Shifeng facility for 365 RMB per ton in March 2012, even though a western cement conglomerate acquired a 
35% interest in the same factory for RMB 68 per ton in 2010.  Prices should have only dropped in Shaanxi from 
2010 to March 2012.   
  
Why  would  WCC  pay  such  a  huge  premium  over   the  prevailing  market  price?  We  suspect   that  WCC’s  acquisitions  
may be a vehicle to embezzle money to undisclosed related parties, so we sent an investigator to dig into one such 
deal. 
 
The Curious Case of Dawei Li 
   
In March-April 2012, WCC acquired 65% of Shifeng for RMB 474.5 million or RMB 365 per ton from a consortium 
of  two  Chinese  Sellers:  Shaanxi  Shifeng  Concrete  (“Shifeng Concrete”)  and  Shaanxi  Xin  Yi  Da  Investment  (“Xin Yi 
Da Investment”).11  According to WCC's public filings, the Shifeng facility was hemorrhaging cash in 2011 and 
unprofitable in 2010. 
 


Shifeng Cement Financials
RMB ( '000,000) 2010 2011

Net Income (1) (36)  


 
We obtained the SAIC filings for the Chinese sellers, which showed that an individual named Dawei Li was by far 
the biggest shareholder of both sellers.  SAIC filings stated that Dawei Li owned 65% of Shifeng Concrete and 43% 
of Xin Yi Da Investment, meaning he should have pocketed over RMB 244 million from WCC on the sale of the 
Shifeng cement factory.

15 Dawei Li owns 66% of Shifeng Concrete, which owns 65% of Shaanxi Yi Da Investment, giving him a total of 
43% ownership interest in Shaanxi Yi Da Investment.

We   sent   an   investigator   to  Dawei   Li’s   registered   address   from   the   SAIC   filings;;   only   to   find that this purported 
multi-millionaire’s   registered   residential   address   is (as of July 2012) the affiliated dormitory of a water 
treatment plant!  Below are pictures taken of Daiwei  Li’s  registered  address. 
 


The Abode of a Front Man or a Captain of Industry?
31 
 


The Apartments Are Decidedly Modest  
 





Is this the Doorman of a Millionaire or a Water Treatment Employee?
32 
 


 
Dawei Li should have personally pocketed over RMB 244 million (before taxes) on the sale of the plant to WCC.  
Our   investigator   spoke   to   a   real   estate   agent   in   the   area,   who   said   that   the   monthly   rent   at   Dawei   Li’s   registered  
address was RMB 1,500 per month.  This is a very humble lifestyle for a man who was allegedly the majority owner 
of a cement factory worth over RMB 730 million.   
 
Recall that around the same time that WCC paid RMB 365 per ton for the money-losing Shifeng plant (2 million tons 
of annual capacity), Anhui Conch purchased 9 million tons of capacity from Baoji Zhongxi for RMB 50 per ton (see 
Appendix II).  Even more suspiciously, a western cement conglomerate acquired a 35% interest in the same Shifeng 
factory in 2010 for RMB 68 per ton.  Prices should have only dropped in Shaanxi from 2010 to March 2012, so why 
did WCC pay 365 RMB per ton?   
 
Is Dawei Li secretly related to an insider at WCC? We cannot say for sure.  But we do know that WCC is massively 
overpaying for acquisitions and that the purported majority shareholder of one such target appears to live an 
exceedingly modest life and not the life of a man who owned a lucrative factory that netted him a small fortune.    
 
Rather, Dawei Li appears to be merely the front man for an otherwise undisclosed recipient and in our opinion the 
preponderance of evidence raises the serious possibility that WCC is merely transferring money to undisclosed 
related parties and stripping the Company of its cash.
33 
 


III. MADOFF-LIKE PYRAMID FINANCING AT UNECONOMIC TERMS 
 
One of the hallmarks of fraud is the pursuit of expensive financing alternatives despite purportedly generating plenty 
of cash from operations.  This shoe fits WCC snugly.  In 2008, WCC borrowed RMB 420 million at an effective 
interest rate of 20.23% even though it was allegedly generating almost RMB 1 billion in cash from operations 
between January 2008 and December 2009.  
  


 
 
This is highly suspect.  If WCC was truly generating a significant amount of cash from operations, why would the 
Company pursue financing at a usurious interest rate?   
 
Nor can the Company justify the loan as bridge financing to complete the switch from the AIM exchange to the 
HKEX  (completed   in  August  2010).     Rather,   according   to  WCC’s  prospectus,   the  Company  borrowed  RMB  420  
million in order to “finance  our  capital  injection in the construction of our Ankang cement plant with an annual 
production  capacity  of  2.0  million  tons  in  the  southeast  Shaanxi  province.” 
 
Why would a business generating almost RMB 400 million per year in cash from operations borrow money at 
20.23% to  pay  for  acquisitions?  The  simplest  explanation  is  that  WCC’s  cash flows were much lower than reported.   
 
Other features of the loan make it seem Ponzi-like: as a condition of the loan agreement, the lenders required WCC 
to raise more money from the capital markets.
34 
 


 
 
This seems like a pyramid financing scheme, as WCC raised money at an exorbitant price in the hopes of raising 
more money in the future to pay off such debt.   
 
A blatant Chinese fraud, ChinaCast (PINK: CAST), traded on the Nasdaq exchange at a market capitalization of 
$300 million USD before collapsing under allegations of fraud.  
 
In October 2008, at the same time WCC was borrowing money at 20.23%, CAST raised $10 million at an 
approximate cost of $2 per share after accounting for warrants and underwriting expenses.  At the time, CAST 
reported $US 60mm, or more than $2 per share, in net cash as well as significant free cash flow.  This was an 
extremely dilutive valuation as it valued the company's enterprise at zero.  However, the company justified the 
raise because it desperately needed cash flow for an acquisition (just like WCC).  Recently, investors and regulators 
discovered that CAST executives allegedly illegally transferred the company’s  cash and assets to a management-
controlled entity, leaving U.S. shareholders to contend with a 95% loss peak to trough. 
 
The lesson is simple: beware of companies with high reported cash flows that raise money at exorbitant prices in 
order to fund acquisitions.
35 
 


 
IV. ODD OPERATING METRICS 


 
Off-market operating metrics are a telltale sign of fraud because by artificially inflating sales or cash balances, 
performance metrics start to significantly deviate from the industry standards.  In WCC's case, selling and 
distribution expenses, interest income and VAT payables are significantly different than their peer group, suggesting 
that the Company could be inflating sales and cash balances.   
 
Selling and Marketing Expenses (% of Sales)  
 
As we know by now, the Shaanxi cement market is hypercompetitive, especially of late.  Yet despite operating sales 
offices throughout Southern, Eastern, and Central Shaanxi, and operating in mountainous areas where distribution 
costs run high, WCC reports virtually no spending on selling and distribution. This compares to the biggest, most 
efficient cement company in China, Anhui Conch, running selling and distribution expenses at 5% of sales.

Abnormally Low Interest Income 
 
There have been several 6-month periods where WCC has reported virtually no interest income despite a 
purportedly large cash balance and significantly higher rates during the investment periods.  
  





  
 
Investors have been burned by other Chinese companies, such as Universal Travel Group (PINK: UTRA) and 
China-Biotics (PINK: CHBT), which had reported abnormally low interest income.  It is often a telltale sign that a 
business is lying about its cash balance or at least can't afford to maintain a high cash balance between reporting 
periods.

Abnormally Low Accrued VAT Payable 


China’s   value   added   tax   (“VAT”)   is   a   form   of   consumption   tax.      WCC pays a 17% VAT to its suppliers on 
purchased  materials.    WCC  then  collects  a  17%  VAT  from  its  customers.    Because  WCC’s  sales  are  greater  than  its  
costs, it collects more VAT from customers than it pays to suppliers.  Thus, periodically, WCC must remit this 
excess VAT collected to Chinese tax authorities.  This process is similar to a U.S. company holding, and then 
surrendering payroll taxes collected on behalf of its employees.  


WCC’s  VAT payables are  a  liability  on  the  Company’s  balance  sheet.     It   is   the  amount  of  net  VAT  that  WCC  is  
holding for Chinese tax authorities at any given time. VAT payables should increase as sales increase.  It is common 
sense that the more cement WCC sells, the more VAT it receives from its customers and the more VAT payables it 
must remit to Chinese tax authorities.   


WCC and its peers also receive VAT refunds, a form of subsidy from the Chinese government, which the Company 
classifies  as   ‘other   income’  on   its   income   statement.     VAT  refunds  are   simply  a  decrease   in   the  amount  of  VAT 
payables that the Company must remit to tax authorities.  Specifically, WCC claims that it receives VAT refunds for 
recycling industrial waste.  Like VAT payables, VAT  refunds  should  move  in  lock  step  with  WCC’s  sales:  the  more  
cement produced and sold by the Company, the greater the VAT refund.  


But  as  the  chart  below  shows,  WCC’s  accrued  VAT  payables  do  not  seem  to  increase  concomitantly  with  sales  and  
the VAT refunds, which we believe presents a significant red flag.

As expected, Anhui Conch’s (shown above in blue) VAT refunds and accrued VAT payables rise more or less in 
lockstep with sales.  


However, even though WCC (shown above in red) seems to file for VAT refunds in lockstep with its reported sales 
figures, its accrued VAT payable at year-end has remained flat despite a 400% increase in sales.  This is a massive 
red flag: if VAT payables are any indicator of economic activity, it would suggest that WCC might be fabricating its 
sales in addition to its margins. 


Furthermore, Chinese tax authorities may want to look into the massive spread between WCC's VAT paid and VAT 
refunds claimed.

V. AUDITOR AND MANAGEMENT TURNOVER 
 
WCC has had four different auditors in four years. The recent auditor turnover at WCC further supports our 
suspicion that the company is materially misrepresenting its financial position.   
 
May 2011 – Present Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu16 Deloitte presided over the Longtop 


accounting scandal.  
January 2011 – May 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (Hong 


Kong) 
Moved from PWC UK to PWC 
Hong Kong in anticipation of 
delisting from the AIM exchange. 


October 2009 – January 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC UK Signed off on only 1 audit.  
2006 - October 2009 PKF UK LLP Resigned ahead of Hong Kong 


listing 
 
The resignation of PwC Hong Kong is especially noteworthy.  PwC Hong Kong resigned after only four months as 
the Company’s  auditor,  supposedly because the parties could not come to terms on the audit fee for the fiscal year 
2011.   
 
The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants, supported by the HKEX and the Securities and Futures 
Commission   (SFC)   (Hong   Kong’s   analogue   of   the American SEC) recently called out auditors resigning over 
purported fee disputes when the real reason for the resignation is because accountants discovered financial 
shenanigans:  
 


In many cases, fee disputes are stated to be the reason for the change. Concern has been 
expressed that certain auditors have been relying on purported fee disputes to disguise the real 
reasons for the change. As a result, potentially significant and fundamental matters about the 
listed issuer may not be disclosed to investors and creditors and the market is not therefore 
being kept fully informed. It is important that the situation concerning the change of auditors 
should be disclosed in full to avoid the possibility of the market being misled.17 


 
The warning to investors is ominous: when an auditor resigns over a purported fee dispute, there may be more than 
meets the eye.   
  
Deloitte 
 
For   those   investors   taking  comfort   in  Deloitte’s  brand and reputation as a bulwark against fraud, we would invite 
you to consider the cases of Longtop Financial, New Oriental Education and Suntech Power Holdings.   
 
At its peak, Longtop Financial traded on the New York Stock Exchange for a market value of US$ 2.4 billion before 
Citron Research publicly accused the company of fraud.  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the mainland China branch of 
the massive accounting firm, had audited Longtop since its IPO in 2007.  Following  Citron’s  allegations,  Deloitte  
resigned,  sending  the  price  of  Longtop’s  shares  plummeting  and  wiping  out  its  shareholders.     
 
Deloitte  said  it  found  “very  serious  defects”  that  included  significant  differences  in  deposit  balances at banks from 
what the Company reported and loans to the Company that had not been previously disclosed.18  But this was too 
little  too  late  for  investors  wiped  out  by  Longtop’s deceitful management team.  The fact is that despite successive 
audits, Deloitte had failed to detect a massive (and actually pretty obvious) accounting fraud. 
 
When the SEC subpoenaed  Deloitte’s  records  on  Longtop,  the  accounting  firm  refused,  stating  that producing such 
material would violate Chinese state secrecy laws.  To compound what was a rough month for the accounting firm, 
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board recently disclosed part of its 2007   annual   review  of  Deloitte’s

United States operation that highlighted deficiencies in its quality control in the work of Deloitte’s  foreign  affiliates.    
The  PCAOB  report  stated  that  Deloitte  “has  no  formal  system  in  place  to  monitor  the  services  its  foreign  affiliates  
actually  perform.”  It should therefore not have come to the surprise of any investor that more recently, two other 
prominent Deloitte-audited firms have seen their share prices collapse under allegations of fraud.   
 
In July 2012 Muddy Waters Research issued a crushing report alleging that New Orient Education (NYSE: EDU) 
was engaged in a long running and comprehensive scheme to forge its financial statements.  EDU stock price 
subsequently tanked almost 40%.   Deloitte was apparently asleep at the wheel on EDU: the accounting firm failed 
to notice some major red flags, including that EDU was allegedly claiming massive tax exemptions that were 
inapplicable.   
 
As if Longtop and New Orient Education were not enough, Deloitte has also come under fire for its audit of Suntech 
Power Holdings (NYSE: STP), one of the  world’s  biggest  maker  of  solar  panels.    STP’s  stock  price  plunged when it 
was revealed that German bonds pledged by an affiliated company as collateral for a financing guaranty may never 
have actually existed.  STP claims it was the victim of fraud and it would be humiliating for Deloitte if it was 
revealed that the auditor never verified the mere existence of $680 million worth of German bonds supposedly 
standing behind a loan as collateral.   
 
Suffice  it  to  say  that  the  company’s  shareholders should not shrug off the evidence compiled in this report because 
Deloitte stands behind WCC.   
 
WOE BE THE CFO 
  
In addition to high auditor turnover, Moody’s  highlighted  that  WCC has had three different chief financial officers 
since 2008.  Suspiciously,  WCC’s  previous  CFO, Low Po Ling, was re-assigned on May 30, 2011, just two weeks 
after the Company replaced PwC as its auditor.19  If re-assigning a CFO and losing an auditor in the same month 
does not scare an investor, they are either brave or ignorant.   
 
MUSICAL CHAIRMEN 
 
WCC has also had a different chairman for each of the last 3 years.

DOCUMENTED WEAKNESSES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS 
 
In WCC's 2010 Hong Kong prospectus, an independent consultant identified numerous weaknesses in WCC's 
internal controls, including:  


  
 Lack of accounting personnel with a good understanding of IRS reporting requirements, 
 Lack of internal control policies and procedures due to lack of resources, 
 Lack of information technology general controls policies and procedures, and 
 Lack of an effective corporate governance system in relation to compliance with the Listing Rules. 


 
We understand these issues were reviewed to the satisfaction of WCC's Independent Directors. However, the weakness 
in   the  Company’s   internal   controls   shows   that  management   had   the   opportunity,   and  we   believe   the   inclination,   to  
manipulate WCC financials.

I. WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMAN?  
 


Both of WCC’s primary corporate governance figureheads have resumes tarnished by their association with other 
companies that collapsed under suspicion of fraud.   
 
Sino Vanadium – A Resume Killer (or not) 
 
The Chairman of WCC's audit committee, Lee Kong Wai Conway (“Mr. Conway”), also served on the audit 
committee of scandal-ridden Sino Vanadium (TSX: SVX).  Mr. Conway joined the audit committee of SVX in 
October 2009, when the company’s share price was hovering around CAD 0.60 per share. 
 
On March 31, 2011, Sino Vanadium's COO, CTO, and CFO all unexpectedly quit in the same press release, sending 
SVX’s stock price down on suspicion of accounting irregularities.  SVX then restated its financial statements for 
three prior periods.  After the accounting scandal, the price of SVX’s shares collapsed and management took the 
company private for a mere CAD 10 million (CAD 0.27 per share).  
 
Mr. Conway’s audit committee service for Sino Vanadium, a company that collapsed under suspicion of fraud that 
cost shareholders tens of millions in losses, should have disqualified him from further service on the audit 
committee of any public company.  Yet he is the Chairman of WCC’s audit committee and supposedly the most 
important figure in safeguarding WCC’s corporate governance standards.  As if to compound the mistake, WCC 
also appointed Sino Vanadium’s former chairman, Ma Zhaoyang, as an independent director in July 2010.1  
Apparently WCC was really impressed by Sino Vanadium’s corporate governance record.   
 
Mr. Sin 
 
In Hong Kong, a corporate secretary is charged with upholding the highest standards of a company’s corporate 
governance and compliance.  WCC's long-serving2 Company Secretary, Sin Lik Man, has at the age of 33 already 
been tainted by corporate scandal. 
 


Prior to joining the Company, the curiously named Mr. Sin was responsible for corporate governance at Norstar 
Founders Group Limited (2339 HK) between 2006 and 2010.  Norstar has been halted for years after losing 
nearly 80% of its value under suspicion of fraud.  Near the end of 2008, multiple executives resigned, including the 
group controller, and the stock was halted.  It has been tied up with creditors in liquidation ever since and has yet to 
reopen three and a half years later.  Its stock chart is below.

VII. VALUATION 
 
We believe WCC's equity holders have little chance of any recovery and that holders of the Singapore-traded senior notes (“Senior Note Holders”)  will   not 
recover more than $0.20 on the dollar.  In  order  to  value  WCC’s  senior  notes,  we assembled a sampling of recovery rates for foreign holders of Chinese corporate 
bonds under distressed conditions.  The weighted average recovery rate was 16.92%.

WEIGHTED AVERAGE

In order to estimate the recovery rate for bondholders currently seeking recovery (in the right hand column), we used 
an average  of   such  bond’s   trading  price over the last five days.  The weighted average recovery rate for foreign 
bondholders was roughly 17% although, as we discuss in this section, such a valuation is quite generous in the case 
of WCC.   
 
Liquidation vs. Restructuring 
 
We did not include any examples of debt restructuring in our sample size because a liquidation scenario is far more 
likely in the case of WCC.   
 
A recent study by Goldman Sachs on the recovery rates on Chinese corporate bonds identified five key factors most 
likely  to  influence  a  foreign  creditor’s  recovery  rate  in  a  distressed  scenario.22  The study found that companies with 
the following characteristics were significantly more likely to enter liquidation: (i) accounting irregularities, (ii) 
unusual capex or working capital fluctuations (iii) the presence of significant on-shore (i.e. PRC) creditors, (iv) a 
market cap of under US$ 1 billion, and (v) a commoditized business (recovery rates for real estate businesses were 
significantly higher than metals and mining companies and other commoditized businesses).   
 
WCC bears all of the characteristics of a likely liquidation scenario: (i) we have identified a number of accounting 
irregularities in this report, (ii) the Company has engaged in a bizarre pattern of capex and acquisitions (paying a 
479% premium over the market price to add capacity), (iii) it has over HK$ 3.3 billion in on-shore creditors, over 
50% of which are secured creditors), (iv) it has a market cap under US $1 billion and (v) it has a commoditized 
business which is suffering secular pain due to significant over capacity.   
 
The Impotence of Foreign Creditors 
 
The case of Asia Aluminum shows  how  little  WCC’s  foreign  creditors can hope to recover in the event that WCC 
collapses under the weight of its fraudulent conduct.  In that case, Asia Aluminum issued almost $1.2 billion USD 
(face value), yet its offshore (i.e. non-PRC based) creditors would take a massive haircut at the expense of 
unsecured onshore (i.e. PRC based) creditors.   
 
In 2009, Asia Aluminum came under scrutiny for fraud.  Investors cried foul, accusing the aluminum producer of the 
fraudulent transfer of assets and capital and various accounting shenanigans. Ravaged by the great recession and 
months of weak global demand for its commodity, Asia Aluminum teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. 
  
Management proposed to take the troubled aluminum maker private and keep the obligations of domestic 
unsecured creditors at par, but offered foreign secured bondholders 20 cents on the dollar and foreign PIK 
note holders 1 cent on the dollar.   
 
Foreign bondholders rejected the measly offer and sued in a Hong Kong court to force Asia Aluminum into 
bankruptcy.  Yet the court appointed liquidator, Ferrier Hodgson, was unable to secure any of Asia Aluminum’s 
assets because they were located in China.23  
 
A management-backed entity, Golden Concord, ultimately bought Asia Aluminum for a song and paid senior 
bondholders 18 cents on the dollar and junior PIK note holders 0.9 cents on the dollar.  Despite the fact that other 
bidders (including a consortium of hedge funds advised by KPMG) came forward with superior offers to buy out 
Asia Aluminum, the Hong Kong liquidator awarded the assets of the aluminum producer to management.   
 
WCC bondholders take note: just because you are a creditor abroad does not mean you are a creditor in 
China.  Asia Aluminum bondholders were completely impotent as the management buyout assumed the loans by 


                                                 
22 Note  to  WCC  bondholders:  the  GS  report  specifically  called  WCC  2016  Senior  Notes  GS’s  “least  favored  bonds.” 
23 Worse still, a global aluminum conglomerate, Norsk Hydro, approached Asia Aluminum with a proposed buyout 
offer.    Despite  the  fact  that  such  an  offer  was  far  superior  for  Asia  Aluminum’s  creditors  (debt  and  equity  holders),  
local government  officials  obstinately  supported  management’s  take-private offer.

PRC creditors (including unsecured Chinese creditors) at par even though foreign creditors took an 80% haircut on 
their investment.   
 
Therefore,  in  order  to  properly  value  WCC’s  equity  and  bonds,  an  investor  must parse the value of its assets and 
liabilities located inside the PRC and those assets and liabilities located abroad. 
 
White Collar Crime Pays, WCC Will Not 
 
WCC’s  Senior Note Holders will  be  as  powerless  as  Asia  Aluminum’s  to  recover  any  assets  in  China  because of the 
structure of the note issuance.  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement governing the issuance of the US $400 million 
senior notes, due in 2016, WCC’s  obligation  to  repay  Senior Note Holders is secured only by a pledge of the equity 
in the “Subsidiary  Guarantors”,  a  group  which includes two shell companies, West China BVI (a BVI entity) and 
Faithful   Alliance   (a   Hong   Kong   entity),   but   which   does   “not include any subsidiaries of the Company 
established under the laws of the PRC.” 
 
In  other  words,  WCC’s  Senior  Note  Holders  have  a  security  interest  in  two  shell  companies  (one  in  HK  and  one  in  
the BVI) but no security interest in any asset located in the PRC.  On the following page we have mapped out this 
structure chart.

To see why Senior Note Holders will not recover any assets in the PRC when that facility is in default, consider the mechanics of the Bond Indenture.
47 
 


To review, after an event of default, in order to recover any assets located inside the PRC, Senior Note Holders will 
have to declare a default, form a creditors committee, hire counsel, attempt to negotiate a potential restructuring with 
an obstinate WCC, file for an involuntary liquidation in Hong Kong, win a judgment in their favor (good luck), 
foreclose on the pledged equity in the BVI and Hong Kong, appoint their own directors to the boards of the HK and 
BVI entities, file an action in a PRC court and win a court case in the PRC against a connected and wealthy PRC 
citizen.   
 
Chinese courts are notoriously corrupt, arbitrary and protective of local businesses and industry. Notions of judicial 
independence  do  not  apply.  As  a  result,  for  foreign  investors  such  as  WCC’s  debt  holders,  we  suspect  that  litigating  
against a powerful local Chinese businessman in a Chinese court would be a Sisyphean task.  Further hindering any 
prospect  of  recovery  are  any  relationships  WCC’s  insiders may have with the local government or state owned 
enterprises, which would only magnify their influence over the judicial system. 


 
Senior Note Holders face potentially 1-2 years of delays and litigation before they can even show up in the PRC 
to ask a PRC court to enforce the rights of a foreigner against a Chinese management team.   
 
A Tragic Comedy 
  
In December 2011, Glaucus issued a research report showing that China Medical Technologies (formerly a 
NASDAQ listed Chinese company) had defrauded investors.      In  response,  CMED’s  management   team  appears to 
have taken the money and ran.  Almost immediately after the release of our report, CMED defaulted on a $5 million 
coupon payment for its corporate bonds (even though CMED claimed, at the time, to have US$ 206 million in cash 
in its accounts).  Note holders were initially stunned and tried in vain to contact the company.  Finally, in late June 
2011,   almost   6   months   after   CMED’s   management   team went dark, bondholders kicked off the asset recovery 
process by filing for bankruptcy in the Caymans.  
  
While creditors   played   by   the   rules,   CMED’s inside ownership was busy rigging the game.  According to a 
complaint filed in California by GLG Partners and other bondholders, CMED’s   founder and 
chairman misappropriated the equity of the PRC operating companies out from under the 
foreign holdco companies to entities controlled by himself within the PRC before creditors could even begin the 
process to recover assets.    
 
CMED presented the same risk profile to bondholders as WCC: it only had assets located in the PRC, it had 
domestic  creditors  and  it  had  a  large  number  of  equity  and  debt  holders  located  outside  the  PRC.    While  CMED’s  
foreign creditors were busy jumping through the proper hoops to seize assets in the PRC, it appears that CMED’s  
management  simply  stole  the  assets.    We  currently  do  not  know  how  CMED’s  story ends, but its creditors are not 
sanguine about a recovery.   
 
This   is   a   troubling   case   for   WCC’s   Senior Note Holders: while they attempt to recover assets by filing for 
liquidation   in   a   foreign   jurisdiction,  WCC’s   management   team   could   easily   steal   the   assets   out   from   under   the  
foreign shell companies to which such bondholders have a claim.  
 
PRC Creditors 
 
Even  if  WCC’s  management  does  not  simply  steal  the  assets  while  its  foreign  creditors  trot  the  globe,  Chinese  courts  
will almost certainly favor Chinese creditors.   
 
In  the  following  table  we  have  attempted  to  estimate  the  recovery  value  of  WCC’s  assets  located  inside  the  PRC  to  
show that even domestic creditors would be lucky to recover at par.  The economic conditions in Shaanxi are 
deteriorating such that 40% of cement plants are losing money. Even if we value WCC's Shaanxi-based facilities at 
100 RMB/t, which is well above what legitimate competitors like Anhui Conch have paid for modern Shaanxi 
capacity during the last 18 months, the business is only worth $HK 3.166 billion.

According to WCC, its PRC creditors are secured and would have priority over foreign creditors with respect to the 
Company’s  domestic  assets; meaning  even  in  a  perfect  world  there  would  likely  be  no  recovery  for  WCC’s  foreign  
creditors and equity holders.   
 
But this is not a perfect world.  This is China.   
 
Whether   WCC’s   management   simply   steals   the   assets   or   its   PRC   creditors   get   hold   of   WCC’s   assets,   foreign  
creditors  can  only  hope  to  recover  WCC’s  offshore  assets.     To the misfortune of foreign creditors, we believe that

WCC’s  only  offshore asset is a small cash balance meaning that Senior Note Holders are at the mercy  of  WCC’s  
management team for any recovery over 1 cent on the dollar: 
 





 
Perhaps  WCC’s  management  team  will  pay  Senior  Note  Holders 20 cents on the dollar, the same amount that Asia 
Aluminum’s   management   team   paid   offshore   creditors.      Maybe   20   cents   on   the   dollar   is   the   going   rate for 
terminating the rights of western creditors against their will.  But any such payments would be at the discretion 
and charity of a cadre of insiders that so far has demonstrated an insatiable thirst for western money, 
meaning that offshore creditors cannot rely on recovering more than the value of the offshore assets.    
 
So even though we expect Senior Note Holders to only recover 0.01 on the dollar, we will charitably value the 
Senior Notes at $0.20 on the dollar (the Asia Aluminum buyout price), putting the value of the equity at $0.00.
