Star Scientific: A Tobacco Stock Buoyed by Dubious Forecasts

* Editor's Note: This story is the first in a two-part investigative series, with the second
article scheduled to run after the Fourth of July holiday.


Over the years, regulatory filings show, Star Scientific (CIGX) has often changed its pretty
story -- with the former cigarette maker now spinning tobacco as the key to breakthrough
medical cures – but the company has rarely changed its ugly numbers.


Star posted its highest revenue as a discount cigarette maker more than a decade ago,
records show, and has generated dismal sales (and absolutely no profits) ever since
shedding that traditional tobacco business. Last year, for example, Star posted total
revenue of just $848,000 – or less than 1% of the $223 million in record 2000 sales it
achieved as a profitable cigarette company – while recording an annual loss (a number
that keeps growing) for the eighth straight year in a row.


Star nevertheless boasts a market value of almost $600 million, some 35% higher than its
peak market value during the year the company achieved its strongest financial results on
record, and currently trades at an astounding 720 times its prior-year sales. If investors
assigned Star the same multiple now as they did back then, the company would sport a
market value of just $1.68 million – with its $4.50 stock fetching barely a penny a share –
instead.


For years, corporate filings reveal, Star has enjoyed far more success selling its story (and
the stock it keeps issuing in order to stay afloat) than it has at actually selling its unpopular
products. Star executed the latest in a series of private placements during the first quarter
of this year, with enough warrants and stock options now outstanding – at average
exercise prices of around $2 a share – to increase the company's swelling share count,

5/23/2018 Star Scientific: A Tobacco Stock Buoyed by Dubious Forecasts - Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCMKTS:RCPI) | Seeking Alpha

which totaled less than 60 million back in 2000, by another 33% to almost 180 million
shares. The restrictions on the last of that cheap stock should expire this September,
records indicate, with the shares facing a potential slide toward $3 unless the company's
handsome market value further expands to absorb that looming dilution hit.


Of course, that price assumes that investors continue to value Star based on its ambitious
plans and keep ignoring the company's miserable results. Without the speculative hype
provided by its long-shot dreams, which alternate between beating Big Tobacco for
massive damage awards and beating Big Pharma for blockbuster miracle cures, Star
would arguably lose all of the appeal that makes it one of the most active (and volatile)
small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange.


Take a look at the company's latest quarterly results, just for starters. Star posted total
revenue of $156,000 during the first quarter, corporate filings show, with dwindling sales of
its most-established product – tobacco-based "Hard Snuff" lozenges now competing with
well-branded rivals – plummeting 26% to $110,000 "due to higher returned goods and
promotion costs." Star generated the rest of its meager revenue from its newer CigRx
offering, a nutritional supplement designed to curb nicotine cravings, but that product –
introduced a full year earlier – still mustered less than half the revenue posted by the
company's shrinking hard snuff business despite the celebrated launch of a national
marketing campaign.


Nevertheless, one of the most vocal stock promoters touting Star these days recently
portrayed CigRx as a looming blockbuster hit.


"Its market potential is staggering, and its eminent regional and national rollout gets closer
by the day," declared John Faessel, a longtime company bull who previously touted NXT
Nutritionals (OTCPK:NXTH) – a dubious microcap company exposed by
TheStreetSweeper before it later collapsed – in two "research reports" published by a
promotional website that caters to the penny-stock crowd. "Star and inVentive Health (the
company's big marketing partner) are preparing for a major push with new, state-of-the-art
call centers to handle the volume of sales that they anticipate.


"So you get the picture: inVentive Health has the muscle and know-how, sees a big – if not
huge – revenue stream and has the money to push CigRx out to a nationwide public …
Therein lies the moon-shoot potential."


Star launched that national roll-out a full month before the first quarter came to an end,
however, and still sold only $46,000 worth of CigRx – while losing $1.41 million on the
product -- during that three-month period. Nevertheless, even after Star released those

figures, Faessel began suggesting that CigRx could soon achieve annual sales of $100
million and eventually see that number explode to $800 million down the road. He pegged
the value of Star's stock at $6 using the first sales figure and at $40 to $60 using the
second.


That math, while intended to dazzle investors with explosive growth projections, actually
illustrates the huge distortion already present in Star's current share price. According to an
equation set forth by one of Star's most relentless bulls, sales of CigRx need to skyrocket
from a current run-rate of about $200,000 to $100 million – or roughly 50,000% -- in order
to justify a stock price that's just $1.50 above present levels.


In other words, that math suggests, Star should already be selling $75 million worth of
CigRx a year to warrant the stock price it currently enjoys. But for now, that math
indicates, current sales of CigRx warrant a stock price of just one penny – about the same
price rendered when assigning past valuation multiples to the company – instead.


This exercise clearly underscores an obvious point. With current sales of Star's hard snuff
actually fading and explosive sales of CigRx largely baked into its share price already,
investors are not buying the stock based on high hopes for the company's unpopular
products. Rather, they are counting on jackpot-size payouts – measured in the billions –
from a couple of apparent long-shot gambles regularly hyped by the enthusiastic bulls who
keep touting the company's speculative shares.


Star failed to respond to requests by TheStreetSweeper seeking input for this story.


Up in Smoke


For the past decade, filings show, Star has been pursuing massive damages against
tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds (NYSE:RAI) for allegedly infringing on its patented curing
process for reducing the deadly toxins in tobacco to create less harmful cigarettes.


Star has already suffered major setbacks in the case, records show, with both a federal
judge and a federal jury ruling against the company – by declaring that its "invention" was
not new – and siding with RJR instead. The company's stock plummeted below $1 after
each of those decisions, records show, but staged a big comeback when the U.S. Patent
& Trademark Office (PTO) took the opposite stand by confirming the validity of those
contested patents earlier this year.


The stock, which fetched less than $2 when select investors (including Star CEO Jonnie
Williams) purchased millions of shares through a private placement the week before that
ruling, rocketed toward $4 within days of that favorable development. Lifted by escalating

hopes for long-sought damages, combined with powerful hype about the company's
pursuit of tobacco-based medical breakthroughs, the stock continued to rally in the weeks
that followed and ultimately broke past $5 this April for the first time in years. With the
stock finally closing above the crucial $5 mark in late May, records indicate, Star
executives are now free to exercise millions of cheap stock options granted under new
employment agreements – signed days after the favorable PTO decision – that linked fully
half of those awards to a single-day closing price of $5 or more.


Meanwhile, despite the celebrated PTO ruling, Star still faces the inherently daunting
challenge of reversing earlier decisions through the courtroom-appeals process. For its
part, corporate filings show, RJR has portrayed the PTO ruling as an irrelevant
development in a distinctly separate case.


"For several reasons," the tobacco giant stated in its latest quarterly report, "RJR Tobacco
believes that the PTO's re-examination decision – which is not binding on the Federal
Circuit – should not materially affect the Federal Circuit's review of the district court's final
judgment, because the jury found non-infringement in any case and invalidity in RJR
Tobacco's favor on grounds not considered by the PTO."


In fairness, like any party embroiled in a legal war, RJR likely holds a biased view favoring
its own shot at victory. At the same time, however, Star General Counsel Robert Pokusa –
the insider arguably best equipped to weigh the company's chances in the case – has sent
some potentially negative signals to the market in recent months as well.


In late March, with Star climbing above $4 on the favorable PTO ruling four weeks earlier,
Pokusa executed the first insider sale by a company executive in years. He exercised
50,000 options set to expire, filings show, and then sold the underlying stock at $3.66 a
share (a price well below the reported low for the day) instead of holding onto it for
potentially bigger gains on down the road. Two months after that, records show, Pokusa
followed up by selling twice as much stock – this time cashing in options expiring a full
year later – as the stock raced toward a new multi-year high before losing some of its
steam once again.


Pokusa exercised almost one-third of his stock options through those two transactions,
records indicate, and directly owns just 1,200 shares in the company (or less than 1% of
the total number he sold) at the present time.


Pokusa can still score a big windfall if Star actually manages to beat the formidable RJR
down the road, corporate filings indicate, since the company has promised a portion of
any damages it receives in exchange for a cap on related legal fees. By cashing in a big

chunk of his stock options (exercised at prices roughly 60% to 75% below the prices that
he received) in the meantime, however, Pokusa has also scaled back his exposure to any
looming courtroom setbacks like those that have decimated the shares – and seemed to
threaten the very survival of the company – over the course of the past few years.


Down to Dreams?


If Star weathers yet another devastating blow in that legal war, as bearish investors have
widely come to expect, then the company could need to pull off nothing short of a miracle
– besting Big Pharma with an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease – in order to
support, and ultimately boost, its current share price.


Four years ago, with the company's stock hammered below $1 on its original courtroom
defeat, Star suddenly announced plans to expand into the biotech arena by seeking
potential tobacco-based treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Star abandoned the discount
cigarette business – the past source of most of its revenue and all of its profits – that same
year, records show, leaving the company almost entirely dependent upon proceeds from
stock sales to address its constant need for cash.


Star won a surprising legal victory in the meantime, records show, when it convinced an
appeals court to return its case back to the lower court for further review that would
include an actual jury trial. With its shot at a huge damage award seemingly revived,
records show, Star resumed its status as a hot litigation stock – its biotech story now
fading into the background – until a jury, like the federal judge before it, ruled against the
company in mid-2009.


After spending the rest of that year in survival mode, its stock spiraling well below $1 a
share, Star once again embraced biotech as a key focus for the company. Star soon won
over a growing crowd of bulls, records show, with even a former contributor to
TheStreet.com – James Altucher – trumpeting the company's chances of proving that a
tobacco-based "nutraceutical" could effectively treat Alzheimer's disease. In April of 2010,
just one day after Star announced that a research institute would begin testing the
compound (later identified as anatabine), Altucher boldly predicted that the company could
introduce a new Alzheimer's treatment within a few months and see its stock rapidly
skyrocket to $15 or $20 a share as a result.


When almost a year passed without that potential cure and Altucher returned with an even
bolder forecast – this one carrying a headline suggesting that Star had already cured
Alzheimer's disease – he sparked a strong rebuttal from a former colleague widely viewed
as the best financial journalist covering the biotech space.

"He knows full well there is no scientific evidence yet to back up a claim that anatabine
cures Alzheimer's," Adam Feurestein, a veteran columnist for TheStreet.com, declared.
"His column, despite the enticing headline, doesn't offer any proof, either…


"It's highly unlikely that any nutraceutical or nutritional supplement, including anatabine, is
going to be selective enough to cure a disease like Alzheimer's," Feurestein continued. "I
know some people swear by the efficacy of nutraceuticals, but I'm not one of them. I prefer
a bit more scientific rigor with my medical claims."


That science costs plenty, of course, with the pharmaceutical industry often spending
billions pursuing miracle cures that they sometimes fail to find. Meanwhile, corporate
filings show, Star itself spent just $650,000 on research and development during its most
recent quarter -- or roughly half the modest sum it spent the previous year -- even as it
further bolstered its public image as a viable biotech company within reach of a possible
Alzheimer's cure.


In a damaging report earlier this month, however, New York hedge fund manager Martin
Shkreli proclaimed that at least three drug companies have already conducted clinical
trials of similar tobacco-based agents and found no evidence supporting their use as
effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. He expressed serious doubts that Star, with
its "lack of success" in the nutraceuticals field and its "complete lack of experience" in the
pharmaceuticals space, could somehow manage to succeed where more established
health-related companies had already failed.


His firm placed a bet against the company by shorting its heavily promoted stock, pegging
the true value of Star – including its shrinking hard snuff business, its unpopular CigRx
offering, its potentially long-shot legal awards and its proposed treatment for Alzheimer's
disease – at well below $1 a share.


"What will make the stock go down?" Shkreli mused at the time. "I don't know … (But) I'm
not so concerned with when it will happen, as I'm pretty sure it will."


Disclosure: Through its members, TheStreetSweeper began establishing a financial
position in CIGX on June 22 and will profit on future declines in the share price. It currently
holds the following positions in the stock: 800 contracts for the July $5.50 puts purchased
at an average price of $1.18 apiece; 350 contracts for the July $6 puts purchased at an
average price of $1.54 apiece; and a total of 44,300 shares of CIGX stock sold short at an
average price of $4.83 a share. TheStreetSweeper will sell the CIGX puts it acquired and
cover its short position in the stock at a future date. It will update this disclosure when
those transactions occur.
