Summary: Riot Blockchain, Inc. (RIOT)
Riot reported yet another dubious transaction via 8-K during a market “dead zone” –


Friday after the close.


Riot is paying a $4 million upfront consulting fee to a believed undisclosed related party


entity.


Just last week we had identi�ed the entity, Ingenium International LLC, as being highly


suspicious.


Collectively, Riot’s series of suspicious transactions are among the most brazen


irregularities we have seen in a U.S. listed company.


Introduction


We genuinely thought we were done writing about Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT)) after our �rst article


(https://hindenburgresearch.com/riot-blockchain-sudden-business-pivot-suspicious-


acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend/) in early December. After all, what more needed to


be said?

Riot Blockchain: Yet Another Suspicious,
Cash-Depleting Transaction

1. We had called the company out for making an arguably absurd “pivot” from a medical


device company to a blockchain company.


2. We had identi�ed that the company overpaid by about 6x for equipment purchased


through a highly suspicious, newly-formed entity.


3. We had identi�ed that a special dividend seemed to disproportionately enrich insiders.


4. We had identi�ed that Barry Honig, an individual with a controversial past, seemingly had


an in�uential behind-the-scenes stake in the company.


That should have been enough.


It also should have been enough when we wrote our second article


(https://hindenburgresearch.com/riot-blockchain-this-crypto-clown-car-continues-hurtling-


toward-the-abyss/) on January 9th, entitled (http://seekingalpha.com/article/4136235-riot-


blockchain-crypto-clown-car-continues-hurtling-toward-abyss) “Riot Blockchain: This Crypto


Clown Car Continues Hurtling Toward The Abyss.”


After all, what else could there be?


We had reinforced our earlier research by identifying numerous issues with:


Believed related party transactions


Multiple auditor switches


The company’s pattern of reporting seemingly negative news on Fridays after the market


close.


Subsequent to that second article, the Wall Street Journal


(https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-who-rode-pivot-from-biotech-to-bitcoin-sells-big-stake-


1517403600), the Denver Post (https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/11/riot-blockchain-


bioptix-castle-rock/), and CNBC (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/public-company-changes-


name-to-riot-blockchain-sees-shares-rocket.html) corroborated and expounded on our


research with exposes of their own. The stock plummeted, particularly after the CNBC piece.


Our second article (https://hindenburgresearch.com/riot-blockchain-this-crypto-clown-car-


continues-hurtling-toward-the-abyss/) even made a cameo appearance in one of Riot’s growing


list of class action lawsuits (1 (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/riot-blockchain-

Our rather absurd headline is now forever cemented in the records of Florida’s Southern


District.


Great! Now we were done. Totally…


But then, despite all the scrutiny by us, by media outlets, by other independent bloggers


(http://blockchainstock.blogspot.com/2018/01/riot-blockchain-riot-pump-dump-


or_18.html) and by numerous �nancial professionals (except for Dennis Gartman


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-21/risky-crypto-bet-blows-up-dennis-


gartman-s-retirement-account))… despite all of it, something remarkable happened.


On Friday, February 16 , after the market close, the company reported yet another 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000112/0001079973-18-


000112-index.htm) detailing what we believed to be its most brazen transaction yet: The


company overpaid by an estimated $18.5 million for equipment purchased from a believed


undisclosed related party entity.


We have so many other things to do. There are all manner of companies we are researching


that engage in questionable business practices, “creative” accounting, or other believed


improprieties. We have several reports coming out in the next couple weeks that we think will


be brand-new and highly impactful.


But we just couldn’t help ourselves. The transaction struck us as just too brazen. So we wrote a


third article, titled “Riot Blockchain’s Brazen Disclosure Issues Continue.”

Finally! After showing what we believed to be clear, new related-party transactions… we were


done?


It’s Not Over


Just prior to leaving the o�ce on Friday we had a cynical thought:


“Gee, what wackiness might Riot report after the close today?”


We were half joking, but we went ahead and checked EDGAR anyway. Sure enough, another 8-


K popped up from Riot Blockchain, having been �led yet again on a Friday after the market


close.


A Consulting Agreement Unlike Any We Have Ever
Seen Before


The new Friday, February 23 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000125/riot_8k.htm) describ


ed how earlier in the week (on Wednesday, February 21) Riot entered into a consulting


agreement with an entity called Ingenium International, LLC (“Ingenium”). The �ling stated that


Ingenium would “provide consulting services related to the Company’s business for a 12 month


period” in exchange for consideration of $4 million in cash. The services described included


installing, deploying, and monitoring the crypto-currency miners that were recently purchased


by the company.


All seemed vaguely plausible at that point, despite the fact that a supposed blockchain


company might be expected to have the in-house expertise to deploy its own crypto-mining


equipment without shelling out millions to outside consultants.


But putting that aside for the moment, our �rst sign that this consulting agreement was highly


irregular were the payment terms


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000125/ex10x1.htm):


In consideration of the Services to be rendered by Consultant hereunder, during the


Term the Company agrees to pay to the Consultant (A) $4,000,000 (the “Cash


Payment”) upon execution of this Agreement.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Given that the consulting services are supposedly meant to take place over 12 months, we �nd


it odd (to say the least) that the $4 million is to be paid upfront upon signing.


Our second sign that the consulting agreement was highly irregular was that we had already


reported that Ingenium appeared to be a suspicious and apparently related party entity of Riot


on literally the same day that Riot signed the agreement with them.


In our article from February 21  (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4148841-riot-blockchains-


brazen-disclosure-issues-continue) under the header “A Variety of Other Entities Raise


Additional Questions” we named Ingenium as one of two entities that appeared to be an


undisclosed related party of the company. We didn’t know at the time whether or what


business the entity had transacted with the company. The key link we identi�ed, however, was


that the same individuals listed on corporate records for Ingenium


(http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTi�ToPDF?


storagePath=COR%5C2017%5C1211%5C20572492.tif&documentNumber=L17000252547) matc


hed the names of individuals listed on corporate records


(http://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?


lx8nvq=fmE0EMNZjWiD8qFICJyf1w%253d%253d) for Kairos Global Technology Inc, a subsidiary


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000112/riot_8k.htm) Riot.


As we wrote in the same section of the article:


Our overall concern with these potentially related entities center around whether


shareholder funds could be misused via investments that pass through them.


At the time (i.e., 5 days ago) we even took the time to email Riot’s investor relations and ask


whether the company or any of its a�liates or related parties engaged in transactions with


Ingenium International, LLC or any of the other believed related party entities. We didn’t hear


back.


Just for sport, we emailed investor relations again and asked again whether Ingenium is a


related party. We also asked, “Why did you opt to pay the entire $4 million consideration upon


execution of the consulting agreement rather than pay over the term of the agreement or


upon completion of the actual services the consultant is hired to perform?” We have not heard


back as of this writing. Should we hear back from the company we will update this article with


its responses accordingly.

Needless to say, we still maintain our original concerns about Riot’s transactions with


seemingly related entities.


Director Resignation


The same 8-K


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997318000125/riot_8k.htm) reporte


d that Eric So, who was originally appointed director in October 2017,


(https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riot-blockchain-appoints-eric-so-to-board-of-


directors-300540986.html) had resigned from the board. In his place, an individual named


Remo Mancini was appointed to a variety of important board positions:


“The Audit Committee (Chairman), Nominating and Governance Committee and


Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Mr. Mancini was also appointed


to serve as Lead Independent Director of the Board of Directors.”


Mancini is the owner and President of Sandstone Strategies, which according to his LinkedIn


pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/in/remo-mancini-8300b1a5/) is “a Professional Directorship


Corporation facilitating Remo Mancini’s service on Boards of Directors.”


Conclusion


We have seen a lot of ridiculous things in our day, but we believe Riot has engaged in some of


the most brazen activity we have seen in a U.S. listed equity.
