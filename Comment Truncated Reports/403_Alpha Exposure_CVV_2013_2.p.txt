CVD Equipment's Defense Shows No Errors In Our Prior Article

This morning, CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ:CVV) released a brief statement
(here) in response to our article about CVV's declining operations. Alpha Exposure
believes this statement only serves to support our article that highlighted CVV's poor
operations and precarious financial situation (here). It is important to note that President
and Chief Executive Officer Leonard Rosenbaum did not refute any of our claims.


Mr. Rosenbaum did not refute that CVV's backlog is down to the lowest level in nine
quarters due to declining orders.

He did not refute that CVV spends very little on R&D and holds an insignificant IP portfolio
of patents and intellectual property, as found in Note 6 of CVV's 2012 Annual Report
(here).

Lastly, the CEO did not refute that CVV produced underlying operating losses in the first
half of the year after adjusting for a one-time gain from a sale of a building that will not
recur.

In our experience, when two sides have a disagreement, the side that bases its argument
on factual evidence is more often in the right. If you read our last article, you can see that
we presented a factual argument. In contrast, the Company's press release states that we
are "purposefully attempting to create a negative picture" by publishing an article that is
"misleading" and "scandalous and injurious to the public." The Company also attempts to
discredit our article by calling us "internet bloggers," and criticizes our anonymous nature.
However, in not one single instance does the Company identify one misleading or
incorrect fact in our article.


Alpha Exposure stands by our article and believes CVV's statement today only further
supports our view that CVV continues to be a great short. At Friday's closing price of
$11.22/share, we believe CVD is a compelling short and believe true underlying value is
only $5 per share based on its historic earnings, which is a generous valuation for a
company that has since turned unprofitable and is now shrinking.
