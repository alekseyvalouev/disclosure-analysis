Puda Coal Chairman Sells Half the Company; Pledges the Other Half
to Chinese PE Investors

Chinese RTO Puda Coal, Inc (NYSEMKT:PUDA) Chairman Ming Zhao transferred the
ownership of PUDA’s sole Chinese operating entity, Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd
(“Shanxi Coal”), to himself in 2009 without shareholder approval according to official
government filings. Then, in 2010, Zhao sold 49% and pledged the other 51% of Shanxi
Coal to CITIC Trust Co., Ltd (“CITIC”), a Chinese private equity fund, for RMB245 million
($37.1 million).


Zhao then recklessly leveraged Shanxi Coal by borrowing RMB3.5 billion ($530.3 million)
from CITIC at an incredibly high 14.5% annual interest rate (including fees) to finance the
development of its coal mines. PUDA shareholders are completely unaware of these
transactions that decimate the value of its U.S. listed shares.


Background – An Industry Facing Government Mandated Consolidation


According to PUDA’s 2010 10-K filing:


In order to improve production efficiency, workplace safety and to reduce coal mine
accidents, the Shanxi provincial government issued a policy in 2009 requiring
mergers and consolidations of smaller coal mining companies in Shanxi Province.
Pursuant to the government policy, the government awarded certain selected larger
coal production enterprises the opportunity to acquire, consolidate and restructure
smaller coal mines through mergers, acquisitions and asset or share transfers.


The aggressive government mandated consolidation of the coal mining industry beginning
in 2009 coincided with the darkest days of the world financial crisis. PUDA management
either had to become a consolidator, requiring massive additional capital, or else dispose
of its coal businesses. Management, lead by Chairman Ming Zhao, made the decision to
pursue aggressive growth by becoming a consolidator. Unfortunately for PUDA, during the
financial crisis, the U.S. capital markets were completely closed. Therefore, in September
2009, Chairman Ming Zhao made a fateful first step to attract Chinese domestic investors:
he transferred the ownership of Shanxi Coal to himself.

PUDA Chairman Ming Zhao Takes Action, Stealing Shanxi Coal from U.S.
Shareholders


In order to raise money domestically, Zhao needed to sever the direct foreign shareholder
ownership of Shanxi Coal, PUDA’s sole Chinese operating subsidiary. On 9/3/09, Yao
Zhao (Ming Zhao’s brother and the legal representative of PUDA’s WFOE, Shanxi Putai
Resources Limited, “Putai”) illegally authorized Putai to transfer 90% of Shanxi Coal to
Ming Zhao, adding to the 8% Ming Zhao already held. Additionally, Yao Zhao divided his
own 2% of Shanxi Coal between Ming Zhao and Wei Zhang.


An official copy of the “Notification of Share Registry Change” can be downloaded here
(.pdf), including a partial translation. The transfers resulted in Ming Zhao owning 99%
of Shanxi Coal, leaving U.S. investors with nothing. Incredibly, PUDA’s auditor,
Moore Stephens, failed to catch this theft of an entire company that is clearly
documented in government ownership filings that any lawyer can obtain directly
from the source.


After stealing Shanxi Coal from U.S. investors, Ming Zhao began looking for domestic
investors to fund his aggressive expansion plans. At the same time, Zhao brazenly
continued trying to raise money for PUDA in the U.S., despite the fact PUDA (without
Shanxi Coal) was just a shell company. As U.S. capital markets recovered, on 2/18/10,
PUDA sold 3.284 million shares in a public offering underwritten by Brean Murray and
Newbridge Securities raising $14.5 million (8-K here), without disclosing to the investors
that PUDA no longer owned Shanxi Coal, its sole operating subsidiary in China. Why did
Brean Murray fail to perform any basic legal due diligence on the real ownership of Shanxi
Coal?


Chairman Zhao Sells Half of Shanxi Coal and Borrows $530.3 Million at 14.5%


In July 2010, Zhao recklessly accepted a highly leveraged RMB2.745 billion ($416 million)
equity and debt investment from the $31.3 billion Chinese private equity arm of China
International Trust and Investment Company (“CITIC”, website here). On 7/15/10 Zhao
sold 49% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC for RMB245 million ($37.1 million) and pocketed
the proceeds. An official copy of the “Notification of Share Registry Change” can be
downloaded here, including a partial translation.


On 7/19/10 Zhao and Zhang pledged the other 51% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC as
security so that the company could obtain a 3-year loan for RMB2.5 billion ($379
million) at a cost of 14.5% (annual interest plus fees) from CITIC. (Note: Zhao pledged
50% and Wei Zhang pledged his 1% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC so that the entire remaining

51% of the company was thus pledged to CITIC). The loan was subsequently
increased to RMB3.5 billion ($530.3 million), bringing the combined investment to
RMB 3.745 billion ($567.4 million). The official filed copies of the share pledge
agreements detailing all these amounts can be downloaded here (.pdf) and here (.pdf).


As of 1/26/11, the outstanding principal, interest and fees payable under the 14.5% 3-year
loan agreement amounted to RMB5.0225 billion ($761 million). Annual interest and fees
on the loan are an incredible RMB507.5 million ($76.9 million USD), over twice the
$34 million EBIT shown in PUDA’s 2010 10-K filing. Shanxi Coal is now a highly
leveraged bet on Ming Zhao’s operational ability to dramatically increase coal production
and profitability enough to service the company’s crushing debt load. Any disruption could
lead to default and loss of the pledged shares to CITIC.


On 12/16/10, PUDA again tapped the U.S. capital markets, this time for $101.5 million by
selling 7.85 million shares at $12 per share in a public offering underwritten by Macquarie
Capital and Brean Murray (8-K here). PUDA again failed to disclose Chairman Zhao’s
9/3/09 illegal transfer of 99% of Shanxi Coal to himself, nor Zhao’s illegal sale of 49% of
Shanxi Coal to CITIC for $37.1 million, nor the $530.3 million 14.5% loan from CITIC
secured by the pledge of the remaining 51% of Shanxi Coal shares. Why did Macquarie
Capital also fail to perform basic legal due diligence on the real ownership of Shanxi Coal,
half of which had been already sold to CITIC? Furthermore, at $12 per share, Macquarie
investors paid over six times the $1.91 valuation CITIC paid for 49% of Shanxi Coal in July
(see my discussion of valuation at the end of this report).


Chairman Zhao Secretly Returns a Portion of the Shanxi Coal to the Rightful Owner


In a partial attempt to cover up his theft of the company, Chairman Zhao and Wei Zhang
transferred their pledged 51% interest in Shanxi Coal to Shanxi Puda Mining Industry Ltd
(“Puda Mining”), a former 100% owned subsidiary of Shanxi Coal that, through
suspicious shareholder shuffling, Zhao maneuvered to make it the 51% parent of Shanxi
Coal. Puda Mining’s 51% interest in Shanxi Coal continues to be completely pledged to
CITIC (see official agreement here (.pdf)).


According to the government filing (available here (.pdf)), Puda Mining shares are
now 90% owned by Putai (the WFOE), 8% Ming Zhao and 2% Yao Zhao. Following
these transfers, PUDA now owns only 45.9% (90% of 51%) of Shanxi Coal, about
half of the 90% PUDA owned before Chairman Zhao began his shenanigans.


PUDA’s 2009 and 2010 Audited Financials can No Longer be Relied Upon

Since Ming Zhao stole 99% of Shanxi Coal in 2009, the operating company’s 2009 and
2010 financials should not have been consolidated into PUDA’s 2009 and 2010 audited
financials. PUDA’s audited 2009 and 2010 financials can thus no longer be relied
upon. For 2011, even though Zhao recently returned 45.9% of Shanxi Coal to PUDA
through its 90% ownership of Puda Mining (the 51% owner of Shanxi Coal), Puda Mining’s
51% interest in Shanxi Coal is entirely pledged to CITIC.


PUDA Cannot Consolidate Shanxi Coal’s Financials in 2011 and Beyond


Since CITIC has 100% control of Shanxi Coal, via its 49% ownership plus 51% share
pledge agreement including voting, veto and other control provisions, PUDA can no
longer consolidate the financial results of this subsidiary (see SFAS 94 page 5
Section 4 link here (.pdf)). PUDA should record its stake in Shanxi Coal as a long-
term investment on its balance sheet, valued at cost.


The damage done cannot be reversed. There is no way CITIC will give up their 49% of
Shanxi Coal, 51% pledged shares, veto rights and other control provisions. Shanxi Coal
owes CITIC over $761 million. Until this debt is repaid (if ever), the share pledge and other
control provisions will certainly persist. PUDA is now just a holding company with a
minority 45.9% investment in a coal operation in China it does not control, with the
added overhead of being a public company (for now at least) in the U.S.


What is PUDA’s Investment in Shanxi Coal Worth?


The book value of PUDA on 12/31/10 was $251 million. Shanxi Coal owns all the mining
assets, coal washing plants, cash and receivables and bears the obligation to repay the
debt reflected on PUDA’s 12/31/10 balance sheet. The 12/31/10 book value of Shanxi
Coal is therefore roughly the same as the 12/31/10 book value of PUDA. I need only to
deduct an estimated RMB184 million ($27.7 million) in placement fees and accrued
interest on the CITIC loan from the book value of Shanxi Coal, bringing its book value
down to $223.3 million. Since PUDA shareholders now only own 45.9% of Shanxi Coal,
multiplying $223.3 million by 45.9% gives a value of $102.5 million for PUDA’s Shanxi
Coal investment. Dividing $102.5 million that by 30.02 million PUDA shares outstanding at
12/31/10 values PUDA at $3.41 per share.


There is significant risk of default due to the very high leverage and servicing cost of the
$530.3 million 14.5% debt of Shanxi Coal. Annual interest and fees on the loan total $76.9
million USD, more than twice times the $34 million EBIT PUDA generated from operations
