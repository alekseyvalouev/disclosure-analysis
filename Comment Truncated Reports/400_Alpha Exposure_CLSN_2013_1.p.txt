Celsion: 50% Downside After The HEAT Trial Failed

Over the last few weeks, Celsion's share price has skyrocketed from below $1 to nearly $2
per share, largely on hopes that the recently presented post-hoc analysis shows that the
Phase III ThermoDox HEAT trial was not a complete failure. We have spoken with key
opinion leaders as well as doctors who participated in Celsion's (NASDAQ:CLSN) Phase
III ThermoDox HEAT study. Their opinions were clear: the HEAT trial was a total failure.
Even the post-hoc subgroup analysis that Celsion presented last month failed to show a
statistically significant benefit in patients and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
Having reviewed the Phase III results and subgroup analysis, all the doctors we spoke
with unanimously believed that Celsion has no chance of regulatory approval.
Furthermore, our research leads us to believe that the road forward for Celsion is perilous,
especially if they pursue another Phase III trial for ThermoDox.


We believe Celsion is a compelling short at these levels and have a price target of $0.73,
which is the current net cash balance per share. We believe the ThermoDox asset is
worthless and that the company's ongoing cash burn, which we estimate at $14 million
this year, means that the company's value will continue to decline. In fact, it is not unusual
for companies to trade below cash when they have no viable assets and are burning cash.


Nothing Compelling from the Phase III Results


What makes us believe Celsion is a compelling short? First, the Phase III trial was a
failure. It failed to meet its primary endpoint of a 33% improvement in Progression Free
Survival (PFS). In fact, there was no benefit at all! Patients who received RFA plus
ThermoDox had a PFS of 13.97 months versus 13.87 months in the control arm. Look at
how closely the two lines overlap with each other.

Second, while Celsion is touting the results of its post-hoc subgroup, experienced biotech
investors know that such analysis is very suspect. Last month, Celsion presented a post-
hoc subgroup analysis that showed ThermoDox may work better when RFA is given for
greater than 45 minutes (see link here).


This is an extreme form of data-mining. When biotech companies fail in their Phase III
trials, they invariably conduct a post-hoc subgroup analysis to dig for any positives. This is
akin to Scott Boras representing a free agent who just finished the season hitting .200,
and going around to teams and presenting data that shows the baseball player averaged
.300 against lefties in 25 games. While the .300 average may seem impressive, the data
set is too small to draw meaningful conclusions, is not indicative of the real world, and
ignores the fact that the baseball player is hitting 0.180 against righties. In Celsion's case,
by believing the subgroup analysis, investors are also believing that the ThermoDox
treatment actually harms patients if it's given for less than 45 minutes. This demonstrates
the absurdity of the subgroup analysis.


In addition, there's no scientific justification for Celsion's subgroup classification in the first
place. A doctor who participated in the clinical trial told us that the 45 minute cut-off time
was more or less arbitrary. He said that while he thought the 45 minute time frame made
sense, he admitted that the 45 minute mark was a company-chosen time frame that made
the data look the best.

Lastly, it's important to note that even the cherry-picked subgroup failed to achieve
statistical significance. Despite Celsion's best efforts at data mining, they could not even
find a subgroup that showed statistical significance! The log-rank p-values for both
Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival failed to reach statistical significance and
were 0.1379 and 0.2213, respectively. These levels are nowhere close to being
statistically significant, which typically requires a p-value below 0.05.

When we asked key opinion leaders for their thoughts on the subgroup analysis, they all
agreed that no conclusions could be drawn from the Phase III trial, nor did they find
anything remotely compelling in the trends in the subgroup data. It was their unanimous
opinion that Celsion cannot obtain regulatory approval in any country based on the results
of the Phase III ThermoDox HEAT study, even on the results of the post-hoc subgroup
analysis. They all said it would not pass regulatory muster with the FDA, the EMA in
Europe, or the CFDA in China.


Risky and Expensive Road Ahead for Celsion


Celsion only option if they want to continue to pursue ThermoDox they is to run a new
Phase III trial. This is not an easy task, and our research indicates that Celsion will face
significant challenges if they choose to conduct another trial.


First, a new Phase III trial will take at least 5 years to complete. Celsion needs to design
an entirely new trial with new parameters, obtain FDA approval for the new trial design,
enroll patients, and then follow the patients through PFS and OS. As reference, the
ThermoDox HEAT Phase III trial began enrolling in the second quarter of 2008 and read
out in the beginning of 2013. That's 4.5 years.


Compounding matters is that Celsion may have to conduct a larger clinical trial. The
doctor who participated in the HEAT study believed Celsion should go for a smaller clinical
benefit than the 33% improvement in PFS that Celsion originally targeted. However, in
order to achieve statistical significance for a smaller benefit, Celsion will need to enroll a
greater number of patients to make the statistics work out. The HEAT trial took 4 years to
enroll. A larger trial would take even longer, perhaps 5 to 6 years to enroll.


In addition, there are other significant challenges that a new Phase III trial will face that
may prevent it from even getting off the group. The doctors we spoke with all said they
would be wary about participating in a trial that originated from such data mining,
especially if the data mining did not result in a statistically significant finding. As a result,
we believe Celsion will face difficulties getting centers and clinicians on board for a new
trial, especially one that will require a lot of patients and potentially take 6-7 years to
complete. The clinicians also told us that RFA times are declining and that fewer and
fewer procedures last as long as 45-90 minutes. This is because the base RFA procedure
is getting more efficient due to advancements of the probes. Clinicians naturally feel that
less surgery time is better, so Celsion will be fighting an uphill batter if they ask these
clinicians to extend the RFA procedure time for longer periods.
