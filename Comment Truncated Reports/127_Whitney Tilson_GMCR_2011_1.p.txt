Green Mountain Growth Story
Just a Tall Tale?

Traders slammed Green Mountain in the after hours, sending shares
tumbling as much as 30% in extended trade. 
 
Although the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly results,
hurt by weak sales, top hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson tells us
something else may be behind the selling. 
 
”The growth story looks like it was pumped up by shenanigans,” he
says.


”There are many big questions here,” he says. But the biggest is
probably that “inventories were up 356% year over year. And they don’t
really provide a satisfactory explanation in the earnings release,” Tilson
says.


”This smells to me like channel stuffing,” he says. “It looks to me like
they pulled a lot of demand forward last quarter, stuffed the channel. “ 
 
And he thinks the sell-off is a sign “that game has come crashing down.
This company may be in real trouble,” he says.

Of course Tilson is talking his book, he’s short Green Mountain. (And he
may add to his short - “I thought it was over valued at $30 on the way
up,” he tells us.)  
 
But it isn't only Tilson who is skeptical of Green Mountain. Last month
David Einhorn also raised questions about the company’s business
model.


On the conference call Green Mountain said they're confident there has
been no misconduct and no wrong doing. 
 
But that may not matter. 
 
”If you’re a money manager, now you have to peel out of the stock just
because it could be a problem for your portfolio,” says Dan Nathan.  
 
Looking at the rest of the earnings release, Green Mountain reported
fourth-quarter sales of $711.9 million. Analysts were looking for sales of
$760.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.


Net income was $75.4 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $27
million or 20 cents a share a year earlier. Adjusted profit was 47 cents a
share, compared with the 48 cents that analysts were expecting on
average.


However, there was a bright spot, the company forecast a profit for the
holiday quarter that was largely above analysts' estimates.
