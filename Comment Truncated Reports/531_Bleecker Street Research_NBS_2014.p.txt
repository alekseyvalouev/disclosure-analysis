Summary


NBS recently ran-up in front of expected Phase 2 data.


NBS failed its primary endpoint, but changed the endpoint mid-trial.


Maxim analyst Jason Kolbert who has a buy on the stock was previously employed
by NBS and may own shares.


On November 14, Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert put out a bullish note on NeoStem,
Inc. (NBS) in front of Phase 2 data. The note combined with apparent market enthusiasm
for this data helped propel shares up 40% in two weeks before the event. On November
17, when the data was due, it appeared that Mr. Kolbert could take a victory lap. The
press release from NeoStem read:


NeoStem Announces Initial Positive Data from Phase 2 PreSERVE AMI Clinical
Trial"


It's all good right? Well not really. As Adam Feuerstein from TheStreet pointed out:

NBS10, formerly known as AMR-001, is an autologous stem-cell therapy derived
from a patient's own bone marrow. When injected back into patients following a heart
attack, the stem cells are supposed to restore blood flow, rebuild damaged cardiac
muscle and improve function.


Except in NeoStem's study, NBS10 fell short on two primary endpoints designed to
assess the therapy's efficacy. The study used non-invasive imaging to assess blood
flow through the heart, six months after a single infusion of NBS10 or a placebo.
There was no difference between NBS and placebo, NeoStem said.


The study's other co-primary efficacy endpoint was a measurement of adverse
cardiac "MACE" events -- defined as cardiovascular death, a repeat heart attack,
heart failure hospitalization and coronary revascularization. To date, 17% of patients
treated with NBS10 have suffered a MACE event compared to 19% of patients in the
placebo arm -- a difference which was not statistically significant.


But it gets worse. As ZZLangerhans points out, NeoStem actually changed the primary
endpoint of its trial. You can see all of the changes here. But what is important is that
NeoStem talked down the mention of myocardial perfusion, because NeoStem saw no
difference in the data. NeoStem talked up Major Adverse Cardiac Events, because they
saw encouraging but not statistically significant numbers. Below is a screenshot of the
changes.


You can view all of the changes here. If you are wondering whether or not this is legal you
are not alone. Derek Lowe called it "over the line." At the very least, it could be a sign that
this is not the highest quality of biotech companies.


Jason Kolbert and NeoStem


Jason Kolbert may not be entirely unbiased. In 2011, NeoStem announced he was joining
NeoStem as Vice President of Strategic Business Development. Here is Jason Kolbert
being interviewed by CorporateProfile in March 2011.

Here is a sample of some of CorporateProfile's work. It appears to be a quasi-Investor
Relations site that uses semi-attractive models to interview CEOs and other Officers of
microcap companies.


Jason Kolbert also owns some NeoStem stock, his last SEC Form 4 shows he owned
8,000 shares. Perhaps this is a conflict of interest. And maybe that is why Mr. Kolbert
remains bullish on the stock, saying that NeoStem results were positive when they clearly
were not.


End Game


NeoStem had $17M in cash burn last quarter. With only $4M in quarterly revenues and a
market cap of $155M NeoStem appears wildly overvalued, especially in light of these
recent events. If cash burn continues at this rate then it will be out of cash within two
quarters unless it does a substantial capital raise, which will likely be dilutive. If the market
is still enthusiastic about NeoStem then they may be able to pull it off, to extend their life
