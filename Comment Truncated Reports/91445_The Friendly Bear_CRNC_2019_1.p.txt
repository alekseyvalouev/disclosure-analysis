Summary


Short Ideas Tech


CRNC


Investors who think Cerence is a cutting edge AI/SaaS/Connected-Car play are in
for a rude awakening.


Tech juggernauts such as Google, Apple, and Amazon, as well as blue-chip
startups such as Soundhound (backed by Mercedes, Hyundai, Tencent and Nvidia)
are devouring Cerence’s market share.


Cerence has tried to minimize competitive threats but revenue disclosures and
recent contract awards point to a secularly challenged company that will not be
able to mask degradation in 2021.


Nuance, Cerence’s pre-spin parent company, did not pursue a strategic/PE exit
which strongly suggests that logical buyers did not find Cerence attractive at price
levels of ~$15/sh.


As legacy revenues/cash flow roll-off, Cerence will follow the path of Telenav – a
car navigation stock that saw its stock collapse in the face of identical competitive

This article was selected to be shared with PRO subscribers, who also got 7 days'
exclusive access to The Friendly Bear’s original Top Idea on Cerence
(NASDAQ:CRNC). The Friendly Bear is an individual investor who primarily focuses on
short ideas. Find out more about PRO here.


Seeking Alpha: Can you briefly summarize your bearish thesis for readers who may not
have seen it yet?


The Friendly Bear: Cerence is just a boring automobile OE supplier that has
temporarily benefited from investor excitement over terms such as AI and SaaS. In my
view, there is little substance to the hype story. Cerence used to have dominant market
position, but there is nothing that differentiates its technology today and it is facing up
against large technology companies that have R&D budgets larger than Cerence’s
entire market cap. These large technology companies are focused on getting into cars,
homes, your phone, your entire life. There is added pressure for Cerence because even
new startups on the white label side such as Soundhound are coming out with
innovative products. So Cerence is going from having dominant share of automobile
voice recognition applications to a major share donor. The company plays down this
share loss dynamic – but just look at what has happened with Mercedes – a prior
material customer of Cerence’s that has now entered a major strategic and economic
partnership with Soundhound – and it is easy to see that Cerence is on the wrong side
of history.


Two things. First, the company is aggressive with press releases. I’ve seen this before in
a prior short – TrueCar – the company put out incessant press releases touting minor
developments. That stock eventually collapsed.

In the past few days, Cerence has put out at least two fluffy announcements about niche
electric car contracts that appear to be economically largely irrelevant. But these
announcements hit on buzz words that the market loves – EVs and AI. These types of
announcements get a certain group of investors excited. That is part of what I think
drove the crazy surge in the shares this year.


The second dynamic is that value investors are desperate to prove that their craft is not
dead – in a world of anemic economic growth, when value investors find any company
that optically looks cheap and is showing some signs of growth, they pile in and get to
enjoy the growth investor high life for a while. Being a growth investor is a lot more fun
these days because your stocks go up every day without any effort. You see this
dynamic often in recently spun off companies – where investors extrapolate trends or
dream up dreams and start to think they actually own something transformational and
growth oriented – then find out in one single bad quarter that they actually owned a
pretty lousy business. The reality most of the time is that value investors who think they
found hidden gems are self-deluding.


SA: Why do you think investors are ignoring such an obvious comp to Telenav (which
argues for significant downside)? Is it because they are thinking CRNC is a certain type
of company when it’s really another type?


The Friendly Bear: People want to believe that maps are something Google is
unusually strong with hence the collapse of Telenav shares, but that voice is something
Cerence is uniquely positioned to deliver. But when you think about how much money
Google, Apple, and Amazon spend on their voice assistants in smart phones and
personal assistants, and then you consider that they are all going after the car, it is hard
to fathom that they will not win – at least on the technology front. These companies are
incredibly focused on R&D tied to voice assistance and AI. Also, it’s a big selling point
for OEs to say they include Alexa or Siri in the cars. They even include these factoids in
their car commercials. As a white label provider, Cerence goes up against that dynamic.
Yes, luxury brands may want white label solutions because they want to own the
customer experience – but it is clear Soundhound has made huge inroads on that side
of the business (through Mercedes at the very least). So Cerence is facing juggernaut
threat in the mass market auto space, and on the white label side is facing at least
Soundhound. I think Cerence has just been better at marketing its story than Telenav –
talking up AI and SaaS is more believable with Cerence than with Telenav.
