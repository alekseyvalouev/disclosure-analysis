ParkerVision Still Tremendously Overvalued

Summary


ParkerVision's loss of JMOL on infringement an enormous blow.


ParkerVision stock now essentially worthless.


$0.25 per share price target based on option value.


On June 20th, Judge Dalton issued an order on the Post Trial Motions in the ParkerVision
(NASDAQ:PRKR) vs. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) hearing. As part of these post trial
motions, he GRANTED Qualcomm's motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL) for a
new trial regarding non-infringement. In doing so, Judge Dalton stripped ParkerVision of
the jury award and royalty rate they had been awarded. While this devastating news
caused a precipitous drop in ParkerVision's stock, we believe that the stock is still
tremendously overvalued.


At last night's closing price of $1.85 and 98.5 million shares outstanding, ParkerVision
carries a market capitalization of $182 million. While this is significantly less than
ParkerVision's prior market capitalization of approximately $500 million, there is now
nothing to support the current market capitalization. The company produces no revenue
and despite hiring 3LP over 18 months ago to work on licensing deals, none have been
signed. Furthermore, the likelihood of a licensing deal being signed is now extremely low
because ParkerVision just lost whatever leverage they may have had in negotiations as a
result of Judge Dalton tossing the first case and the IPRs being filed.


We believe that the only reason ParkerVision stock still trades above $1 is a large
fundamental misunderstanding by shareholders. This misunderstanding is highlighted in
ParkerVision's press release when they state:


While we are pleased that the court upheld the jury's decision that the patents are
valid, we are obviously disappointed with the District Court's ruling that judgment be
entered for Qualcomm on non-infringement.

To be clear, the Judge did NOT find the patents valid. He simply found insufficient
evidence to find them invalid. If you read the IPRs that were filed by Mike Farmwald and
RPX and discussed within this SeekingAlpha article (HERE), you will quickly realize that
the validity of these patents is highly questionable given the vast amount of prior art that
an expert in the field of RF found. The large amount of prior art should lead to the PTAB
determining that the patents are invalid. Even if the patents are ultimately found to be
valid, we see no value in a valid patent that no one infringes, which is the current status
following the JMOL from Judge Dalton.


Shareholders seem to view the lawsuit against Qualcomm and HTC (OTC:HTCCY) as
another source of potential value. The first thing worth noting about this lawsuit is that
ParkerVision has not served Qualcomm or HTC yet. There are two ways that we know this
lawsuit has not been served. First, when we look at the first lawsuit, there is a certificate of
service, but there is no certificate on the second lawsuit. Second, neither Qualcomm nor
HTC have responded. Qualcomm and HTC need to respond to a lawsuit in 21 days, but
that 21 days starts from the day they are served, so the lack of a response means that
they have not been served. Even if Qualcomm and HTC do eventually get served, this
new lawsuit is years away from being tried as Qualcomm and HTC will likely file IPRs
against these patents. Keep in mind that ParkerVision is now filing a lawsuit on their
second string patents. They would clearly use their best patents on the first case, so the
patents in this new lawsuit were not even worth asserting in the first case. If Qualcomm
wins the IPRs it is likely to file, then the lawsuit will be dismissed. Furthermore,
ParkerVision will find it difficult to use the inflammatory emails from Qualcomm in the
second lawsuit, because ParkerVision previously said these emails were about the energy
sampling patents. It will now be impractical and lacking in credibility to claim the emails
are about different patents. We find it hard to believe that a judge will allow this.


Bulls also seem to be misunderstanding the fact that an appeal could be devastating to
ParkerVision. If ParkerVision appeals, Qualcomm gets to cross appeal. Therefore, it is
possible ParkerVision ends up worse on appeal. This is because the Federal Circuit could
find the patents invalid on appeal, especially with the IPRs in process. The Federal Circuit
could also decide to toss the Markman. Therefore, an appeal is not a one-sided event
where ParkerVision can only emerge victorious. In fact, ParkerVision risks losing a lot on
an appeal.


The only thing that may be certain about the future for ParkerVision shareholders is that
they will face further dilution. ParkerVision ended last quarter with $25.3 million in cash.
They currently burn about $4 million in cash a quarter, but the cash burn is likely to rise as
