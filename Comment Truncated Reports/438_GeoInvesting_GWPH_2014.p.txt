INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.
(INSY) – The Long And
Short Of It: Buy INSYS
Therapeutics And Sell GW
Pharmaceuticals
August 11, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary


Cannabidiol (“CBD”), a cannabis-based substance, is
the focus of INSY and GWPH, two companies
competing to develop CBD for the treatment of Dravet
Syndrome, a form of childhood epilepsy.
Contrary to what appears to be respected analysts’
expectations, INSY managed to receive orphan drug
designation for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome.
We believe analysts were misled into believing that
GPWH had exclusivity to pursue CBD for Dravet
syndrome.
Given that INSY already has licenses in place to
manufacture and distribute cannabis-derived products
in the US, it appears much better suited for success
than one that doesn’t, namely GWPH.
INSY offers a much better valuation proposition than
GWPH; our best case valuation for INSY is $86/share,
or over 218% upside; for GWPH, $52/share, or
around 40% downside.

JUXTAPID, off-label. The motivation for doing so was
obvious. The drug treats what is estimated to be a one-in-
one-million population condition. With such a limited
population of eligible patients, AEGR had to push the
envelope if it was to convince the Street of its viability.
Shortly after we published our article, AEGR reduced its
2014 revenue guidance and the stock’s price has declined
by 30% since then. The moral of the story is that hype and
blue sky scenarios are pervasive in the pharmaceutical
space and investors should proceed with caution.


This brings us to two other pharmaceutical stories that
caught our eye. As we have been closely following the hot
cannabis industry, we noticed two companies that are
working to develop competing Cannabidiol (“CBD”)
compounds to treat epilepsy in children – INSYS
Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) and GW
Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH). INSY is our bullish
call that has been quietly making progress (while insiders
buy) without the fanfare and GWPH, our bearish call that in
our opinion is making fanfare without properly telegraphing
the risks that it faces for its CBD to reach the market
(while insiders sell).


INSYS Therapeutics – go long the substance overhype
GW Pharmaceuticals – sell the promotional hype


We rate GWPH a SELL with around 40% downside, and
INSY a BUY with more than 200% upside potential.


This story becomes even more compelling in light of
analysts’ price targets. With respect to GWPH, the price
targets are clearly overweighed with an assumption that
the company will eventually gain approval for its CBD.
However, price targets on INSY have not accounted for this
same kind of approval assumption. We find this very odd
since both companies have received orphan drug status
from the FDA for their CBDs and only one would be able to

ultimately gain final FDA approval. We believe that once
INSY begins informing analysts and investors about its
progress with its CBD initiative that price targets will have
to be raised. We detail in this report why we believe that
INSY has the clear advantage in this race, including the key
role the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) will play
in the FDA approval process for GWPH which has to import
its raw material from outside the U.S.


Background


The valuation arbitrage between GWPH and INSY centers
on the compound Cannabidiol. CBD is a compound
derived from marijuana for which medicinal applications
are still unknown. A simple Google search of “Cannabidiol
Epilepsy” yields significant anecdotal evidence that CBD
has the potential to treat Epilepsy in children. The interest
in and use of CBD was amplified by a compelling CNN
documentary available here.


The Medical Marijuana Market Offers Great
Opportunities, But Be Careful


The issue at hand is the development and marketing of
CBD. There is a great deal of excitement about the drug’s
potential for treating epilepsy. GWPH has engaged in a
heavy promotional campaign and potentially
misrepresented certain key points to Wall Street analysts
who bought the story, leading investors to push the stock
price up by more than 1,000% in the last 12 months,
translating to a market cap of over $1.7 billion for the
company. Rather than attack the drug itself, we
choose to focus on management statements and rosy
projections versus the business environment and
legal realities.


For investors who choose to avoid the hype and instead
focus on substance we have identified INSY as an

https://geoinvesting.com/the-long-and-short-of-it-buy-insys-therapeutics-and-sell-gw-pharmaceuticals/ 4/19


opportunity to access the exact same opportunity that
GWPH touts but with far less hype and uncertainty. INSY
received FDA Orphan Drug Designation on July 1, 2014 for
exactly the same compound for which GWPH had been
previously granted orphan status. However, a major
difference is that INSY has a market cap of only $925
million and existing robust revenues and cash flows from
Subsys, a drug that has already been FDA approved and
has been successfully marketed since March 2012.
Furthermore, GWPH has not received FDA approval
for any of its drugs as all of its revenues are
generated outside the U.S.


For investors who desire exposure to the medicinal
marijuana market, they can do so by buying INSY, where it
is almost a free option, as opposed to being long GWPH, a
company that faces more business and regulatory
challenges and thus a much lower probability for success.
GWPH does, however, excel at heavy promotional activity,
including the issuance of misleading statements about its
business.


In this report, we show:


1. GWPH appears to have made misleading statements
that mask the actual and relatively low probability for
success.


2. GWPH’s promotional tactics have apparently been
successful as analysts have been misled enough to
incorporate materially false assumptions in their
reports, which in our opinion indicates poor or even a
lack of due diligence by these analysts.


3. INSY is a far safer and higher probability investment
for those hoping to capitalize on the bull case for
medicinal marijuana.

https://geoinvesting.com/the-long-and-short-of-it-buy-insys-therapeutics-and-sell-gw-pharmaceuticals/ 5/19


Wall Street analysts are extremely bullish on the market
for CBD as an epilepsy treatment. In their valuations of
GWPH, a probability discounted forecast still yields
valuations equal to GWPH’s current share price of around
$90. This is evidenced by excerpts from respected
analysts, shown in the screenshots below. (note: GWPH
uses the trade name “Epidiolex” for the compound CBD.)


On June 30, 2014, Merrill Lynch (“ML”) assigned a $110
price target for GWPH with 85% of that value attributed to
Epidiolex and CBDV. That’s $1.3 billion of the company’s
current $1.5 billion market cap:


Piper on June 30, 2014:


Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on May 12, 2014:


The problem with the bullish assumptions is not drug
efficacy related. We are not doctors, and do not intend to
try to debate science. We are solely interested in securities
valuation. Contained within these analyst reports are
certain assumptions regarding the probability of success
that are simply untrue. In an April 22, 2014 note, MS
backs up valuation claims with the following statement:


MS appears to believe that GWPH has exclusivity to pursue
CBD for Dravet syndrome.

Piper Jaffray (Piper) also makes a key incorrect assumption
in the, as seen below:


Unfortunately for Piper, INSY received Orphan Drug Status
for CBD the following day. The following screen shot was
obtained on the FDA website that is open to anyone:


Note the Orphan Designation for the treatment of Dravet
syndrome. So is it possible for multiple parties to have an
Orphan Drug Designation prior to approval? In order to
confirm this evidence, we retained FDA counsel who was
very clear in saying that there is no such thing as
orphan exclusivity prior to FDA approval. We are not
sure if the MS analyst is an FDA attorney, but it does not
show up in his bio. We believe the analyst was misled
by GWPH’s management, as we doubt he invented this
idea on his own. More troubling though is that he
apparently made no meaningful effort to validate
management’s claim of exclusivity.


Simply said, our basic search of orphan drug designations
and approvals clearly refutes Piper’s assumption that there
would be no competition for GWPH from ISNY or anyone
else.


What about analysts that cover INSY? This is where the
opportunity exists. INSY has been quiet about its CBD
program even as insiders purchase stock in the open
market. Following is an excerpt from an Oppenheimer
report on INSY published the same day that INSY received
Orphan Designation:

Notice there is no mention of CBD at all. So a
compound that ML says is worth over $1.3 billion to
GWPH has NO value to INSY?! This presents
considerable upside for INSY shareholders and appears to
be undetected by the Street.


Misrepresentation of ongoing “Trials” and Poor Due
Diligence:


Although physician-sponsored trials are ongoing,
GWPH is NOT currently conducting any clinical trials
for Epidiolex approval, despite convincing the Street that
they are. One of the reasons analysts have continued to be
excited by GWPH is that they believe the company is
rapidly pursuing clinical trials. This is evidenced by the
following from Merrill Lynch on June 30, 2014:


Also, from Piper on June 30:


In a particularly disturbing piece of evidence, GWPH
management also seems to have confused ML’s investment
banking team with claims that the company is currently
conducting clinical trials. In an ML internal document found
on a private wealth advisor’s website, we see that when ML
did due diligence for GWPH’s recent equity offering, they
also believed that clinical trials were taking place:


In order to confirm the progress of these trials referenced,
we went to clinicaltrials.gov. A search for “Cannabidiol” and
“Epilepsy” yields the following shocking result:

https://geoinvesting.com/the-long-and-short-of-it-buy-insys-therapeutics-and-sell-gw-pharmaceuticals/ 8/19


GWPH is not currently conducting any FDA clinical
trials for Epidiolex. But what about Dr. Orrin Devinsky,
the doctor that ML spoke to? Who is he and what were they
referencing?


Dr. Devinsky is a respected researcher. The “trial” that so
many Street analysts mention is actually just an
investigational study at NYU. Many online resources
regarding this study reference this article from a pro-
legalization blog which gets information from GW’s
chairman. Dr. Devinsky does appear to care deeply about
helping families affected by epilepsy. He argues for the
investigation of medicinal marijuana and epilepsy in a
NYTimes Op/Ed available here. Within the article, he
argues:


“There is no reason such studies cannot be done
with other products derived from marijuana, such
as the oil with high CBD and low THC sold in
Colorado that was used by Charlotte Figi.”


This implies Dr. Devinsky is more interested in proving that
OTC CBD in dispensaries could be helpful to patients. He
does NOT appear to be specifically interested in the
approval of Epidiolex. It would be negative for any
valuation scenario if the leading researcher on the topic
were to argue that there is no need for a prescription drug,
but we will address that later.


Dr. Deinvsky also appears to do his best when trying to
bring expectations back to earth in a conference call

organized by GWPH on June 17, 2014. Within the same
call, the transcript shows that Stephen Wright of GWPH
makes promotional statements such as:


“So, before heading on to Dr. Devinsky, if I could
just draw some key conclusions, firstly, we
interpret these data as showing promising signals
of efficacy, especially in Dravet syndrome.”


This is immediately followed up by Dr. Devinsky saying:


“It has been as Dr. Wright said, an open-label
trial, so that both the parents and children who
are cognitively aware, as well as the
investigators are aware of the medication, the
active substance that’s been given, so this is not
the randomized or double-blind trial…it is an
open-label study, and obviously not as
valuable data as we would get from a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial.”


This is to say, this is in no way a proper clinical trial that
can be used for FDA approval. As seen above, the actual
FDA trials are not yet underway.


This is clear evidence that GWPH is not actually very far
ahead of INSY in the race for FDA Orphan Approval.


INSY’s Home Field Advantage


Part of the reason GWPH will likely struggle is that it does
all of its manufacturing in the UK. Since CBD is a Schedule
1 substance, the commercialization of Epidiolex would
require GWPH to get a license from the DEA to import it for
commercial purposes. This would be the first license of its
kind ever issued by the DEA so it is not likely to happen.

In a presentation to investors on May 22, 2014, GWPH lists
as a development milestone that:


Well, not really. Under pressure from other government
bodies, the DEA has allowed the importation of schedule I
substances for purely research purposes only. This is
how Dr. Devinsky is able to use Epiodiolex in the NYU
study. This makes sense; one can easily see the benefits of
medical research that could help the sick.


As noted in the company’s recent prospectus, GWPH still
has not requested nor received approval from the DEA for
the importation of Epidiolex for sale. From the June 20,
2014 prospectus:


“Moreover, Schedule I controlled substances,
including BDSs, have never been registered
with the DEA for importation commercial
purposes, only for scientific and research
needs“


Well, if you can’t import it, do they at least have the right
to make it? Further on in the prospectus, you can see that
they don’t:


“In the United States, the DEA regulates the
cultivation, possession and supply of cannabis for
medical research and/or commercial
development, including the requirement of
annual registrations to manufacture or distribute
pharmaceutical products derived from cannabis
extracts. We do not currently conduct any
manufacturing or repackaging/relabeling of
either Sativex or its active ingredients, or

any product candidates, in the United States
[bolded for emphasis]. In the event that we
sought to do so in the future, a decision to
manufacture, or supply cannabis extracts for
medical research or commercial development in
the United States would require that we and/or
our contract manufacturers maintain such
registrations, and be subject to other regulatory
requirements such as manufacturing quotas, and
if the DEA failed to issue or renew such
registrations, we would be unable to manufacture
and distribute any product in the United States
on a commercial basis.”


Additionally, in an article about GWPH, a doctor from the
very same NYU center doing the study says:


“You can’t pretend this stuff isn’t
marijuana,” ASA’s Aggarwal says of Sativex.
“That’s like saying to a judge when you get
caught with pot brownies that this is
something different. Marijuana shouldn’t be
cordoned off for the sake of FDA drug
applications or patents.” [bolded for
emphasis]


We consulted FDA attorneys on the topic, and it is clear
that the type of licensing for import versus domestic
production is a very different and could take years. We
engaged a law firm familiar with DEA regulations, and the
law is quite clear. If importation is NOT for research
purposes, then the company would have to
demonstrate that the US is lacking in sufficient
supply. Given commercial production of medicinal
marijuana is booming, and the existence of INSY’s
manufacturing, this process could take a significant
amount of time even if CBD were to gain FDA

approval. It places a huge question mark on GWPH’s
commercial strategy. We believe the company will have to
enter into a domestic production agreement with a third
party or engage in production itself as a result of the legal
environment. This is a significant challenge for any proper
clinical trial, as approval would have to be based on clinical
trials using the identified manufacturer. We believe that
GWPH is taking a great risk by not addressing this problem
first.


This puts GWPH at a competitive disadvantage to
INSY.


INSY has manufacturing facilities in Austin, Texas, and is
fully licensed by the FDA and DEA for the manufacture and
distribution of cannabis-derived products.


Whereas GWPH has NEVER obtained FDA approval for ANY
drug in the US, INSY has already been through the
process. It is our belief that a company, namely INSY, that
already has manufacturing and licenses in place is better
suited for success than one that doesn’t, namely GWPH.


INSY Set Up To Under Promise And Over Deliver


In May of 2013, GWPH CEO Justin Gover was interviewed
by Forbes. A notable fact about the interview, available
here, is that Epidiolex is not even mentioned. His big
growth story in the US is Sativex, a drug with a much
smaller market than is anticipated for CBD. In fact, in order
to find any mention of Epidiolex from GWPH, one would
need to fast forward to November of 2013, after the stock
price had already moved up 300% and the marijuana stock
hype had begun. On the November 19, 2013 earnings call,
management mentions Epidiolex 19 times, up from ZERO
times in the previous transcript. With a new stock price
justification and an exciting program, Gover celebrated by
dumping 500,000 shares in the market on November

26, 2013, only one week after the earnings call. This was
followed by equity raises in January of 2014 and June of
2014. His sale was done the same day as the publishing of
Piper’s favorable report regarding GWPH.


INSY management has done the opposite. After mentioning
CBD in his opening comments on the May 13, 2014
earnings call, INSY CEO Michael Babich does not say CBD
or Cannabidiol for the entirety of the Q&A section. From
May 15 until June 16, 2014 INSY management invested
nearly $6 million into INSY stock in the open market. This
is far from the promotional behavior displayed by GWPH
insiders, and we believe shows INSY’s management team
puts their money where their mouth is:


Recent Event Makes INSY An Even Greater Bargain


It is important that investors have perspective on INSY’s
flagship drug, Subsys, and a recent event that unjustifiably
resulted in INSY’s stock price falling sharply. Subsys
accounted for 97.5% of INSY’s $41.6 million in revenues in
Q1so any news concerning the drug is going to move the
stock.


Between July 31 and August 1, 2014, INSY dropped
sharply from $30 to an intraday low of $22.50 on August 1
before recovering to $28 in recent trading. The volatility
was based on news that Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX),
the largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (“PBM”) with around
30% market share, announced it would be adding Subsys
to its excluded medications list for the national formulary
beginning January 2015. The second largest PBM, CVS
Pharmacy, did not follow suit to restrict Subsys.
Oppenheimer and JMP Securities (“JMP”) analysts quickly
weighed in with sharply divergent views on the impact of
Express Scripts’ decision. The Oppenheimer analyst

5/23/2018 INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY) - The Long And Short Of It: Buy INSYS Therapeutics And Sell GW Pharmaceuticals | GeoInvesting

estimated $50-$60 million in revenues and 25% of INSY’s
EPS in 2015 was at risk and surmised that Subsys’ growth
potential without Express Scripts would be severely
impacted. The JMP analyst concluded the Express Scripts
scare was overblown and that weakness in INSY’s share
price was a buying opportunity. We are putting more
weight in JMP since the analyst explicitly mentioned
that he spoke with INSY management, while the
Oppenheimer analyst made no such statement.
Following is an excerpt from the JMP report published on
August 1, 2014:


“Concerns over reimbursement coverage
overblown, buy on weakness; reiterate
Market Outperform rating and $65 price
target on Insys Therapeutics. INSY shares
have been under pressure yesterday and this
morning due to concerns that Subsys may be
added to Express Scripts’ (“ESI”) exclusion list
for 2015. While we do not have insight into
whether or not Subsys will be added to ESI’s
exclusion list, we do not believe that such a
change would materially impact the product’s
sales or growth trajectory. This is because the
product already has prior authorization
requirements and is not currently included
in any PBM preferred formulary positions.
We also had the opportunity to speak with
management who believes that the
product’s inclusion on the ESI exclusion list
would have little to minimal impact on
overall Subsys business. We view this
weakness as a buying opportunity. Our $65 price
target is derived through a risk-adjusted
DCFanalysis, including Subsys and pipeline
candidates.

Subsys success has been achieved even
with reimbursement road blocks and
insurance companies recognize its medical
necessity. We highlight that Subsys is currently
subject to reimbursement restrictions, as has
been the case since the product was launched.
The product is not currently included in any PBM
preferred formulary positions. Therefore, we view
the potential impact to Subsys becoming an
excluded product for ESI as different (i.e.,
substantially less negative) from a scenario
where a drug that was previously included on a
formulary is removed and placed on a PBM’s
exclusion list. We note that, typically, prior
authorization is required for an insurance
company to grant reimbursement access for
Subsys. As such, physicians prescribing Subsys
are accustomed to securing patients’ access to
drug by gaining prior authorization approval from
insurance companies, including attesting to the
product’s medical necessity. Insys also has
infrastructure to provide assistance to physicians
with insurance coverage determination and the
prior authorization process.”


In our view the JMP analyst put the concerns over the
Express Scripts’ decision to rest. We recommend investors
pay close attention to INSY’s Q 2 release and conference
call on August 12, 2014 as the Express Script decision and
impact on Subsys will almost certainly be prominently
discussed. If management echoes JPM statement we would
expect shares of INYS to approach the pre Express Scripts
scare levels.


Valuation – GWPH Grossly Overvalued, And INSY A
Screaming Buy

We note that Infitialis has previously said that there will be
no market for CBD because people will just go to
dispensaries rather than have insurers pay for an
expensive Orphan Drug. We are less convinced. We believe
the appropriate case study is GSK’s drug Lovaza. Lovaza is
fish oil. Unlike OTC fish oil, the FDA inspects the
manufacturing and has reviewed data regarding Lovaza.
Other fish oil products are exempt from FDA inspection or
regulation because of the Dietary Supplement Act. Despite
fish oil being far more widely available than marijuana
products, Lovaza still manages to generate approximately
$250 million in revenues per quarter. See data here.


We believe that, while pricing might fall short of Street
expectations, parents will want FDA quality CBD when
giving it to their epileptic children and insurers will cover
the costs. In fact, we believe that the synthetic CBD
produced by INSY will be superior because its consistency
can be better controlled than extractions from plants.


Rather than speculate on the market size, we will rely on
Street analyst expectations for CBD, but will handicap
probabilities based on our research.


The probability adjusted present value of CBD for Epilepsy
has a wide range. Piper believes it could be worth up to $2
billion, while ML has a more conservative $1.6 billion
estimate. How does this translate to stock prices? MS
thinks that if Epidiolex fails, GWPH is worth $9 per share.
These are DCF based calculations using a 9% WACC. As
these WACCs take into account materially false information
(such as exclusivity, clinical trials that have not yet begun,
and direct competition from a seasoned rival), we think
that 10% far too bullish. Adjusting this discount rate to
20%, we get roughly half the ML’s valuation for CBD, or
$800 million. At that valuation for Epidiolex and an
additional $9 a share from MS, we get to a best case
$52/share for GWPH or around 40% downside.

This is in sharp contrast to our valuation of INSY. INSY has
conservative management, manufacturing licenses, US
based production, and a track record of having gained FDA
approvals. It’s everything that the Street wishes GWPH
had. We believe a 10% WACC could be fair for INSY’s CBD
program. Using $1.6 billion and 34.2 million shares
outstanding, we derive $46/share for CBD. Adding existing
programs that Oppenheimer values at $40/share, we can
see a blue-sky valuation of $86/share. This presents
over 200% upside.


A hedged investment in CBD for Epilepsy of being short
GWPH and long INSY is a rare opportunity in capital
markets.


Also – 44% of INSY’s float has been shorted – a juicy long
proposition for us.
