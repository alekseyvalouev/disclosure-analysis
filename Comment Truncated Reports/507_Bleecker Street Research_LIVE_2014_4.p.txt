LiveDeal: 75% Downside This Time, The Thesis Is The Same

LiveDeal (NASDAQ:LIVE) has continued to put out almost daily press releases, although
it appears that their effectiveness is diminishing. Three weeks ago, a bullish press release
could have sent the stock up 10% in a day, but now the stock might be flat or only up a
little bit. So what have all these press releases had in common? Well they all say nothing
and use big numbers regarding the general industry, yet rarely say anything specific to
LiveDeal. Additionally, the company reported earnings and announced a shelf offering in
mid-February, which I will cover below.


Press Releases


2/19: "Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) Follows LiveDeal's Lead but Without Key Benefits
to Users"


I'm not sure how this is supposed to be bullish. Groupon, which is better capitalized and
already has a national presence, could easily replicate LiveDeal's business model. Also
Groupon has a huge mailing list that it could use to promote its new service, something
LiveDeal doesn't have.


2/20: "LiveDeal Inc. Launches National Media Rollout on the Howard Stern Show"


Interesting, and that will probably get LiveDeal some visibility. Howard Stern does have a
target demographic that advertisers seek.


2/21: LiveDeal Platform to Reach 12 Million Listeners on Popular Howard Stern
Show


Same message as the press release the day before. Except for this quote.


If you're a LiveDeal investor, you should feel pretty good that you're investment is
getting the royal treatment with a media campaign that will begin with more than 12
million listeners from all over the country. There may not be a more powerful start to
a rollout than to reach more than 12 million potential business owners and potential
consumers.


2/24: LiveDeal Mobile Popularity Set to Explode with Addition of Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android Apps

This press release, using the big total industry numbers, said:


Gartner, Inc., the world's leading information technology research and advisory firm,
predicts mobile phone shipments will rise to 1.91 billion units in 2014 while
tablet shipments are expected to rise 42.7% to 263.2 million units this year. In a
recent report from eMarketer, the firm said mobile transactions are on pace to
drive 19% of all e-Commerce sales in 2014 which corresponds to $56.72 billion
in sales. Forecasts also show mobile transactions will represent 26% of digital retail
transactions in 2017, reaching an eye-popping $113.57 billion, an increase of
close to $90 billion in just 5 years.


2/24: LiveDeal Inc. to Unveil Plans for Significant Enhancements to livedeal.com on
March 12 in Light of Excess Demand and User Feedback


Due to excessive demand and enthusiastic feedback from consumers and
restaurants, the Company today announced that it will unveil plans for
enhancements in a forthcoming version of its successful mobile marketing deal
platform on March 12, 2014.


That enthusiastic response from the restaurants must be coming from those 15
restaurants I called where only two of them had heard of LiveDeal.


How Was The Last Quarter?


On Valentine's Day evening, LiveDeal filed its 10-Q and announced a $50 million shelf
registration. First the registration,


This registration statement includes $50,000,000 of securities which may be issued
by the registrant from time to time in indeterminate amounts and at indeterminate
times. Securities registered hereunder may be sold separately, together or as units
with other securities registered hereunder.


This is a pretty large filing for a company with a $113 million market cap, but that's what
happens when a stock goes up 900% and the value of it is much lower. The quarter itself
wasn't much better.Yes, revenues were up 4%, as they said in a press release, but if one
even bothered to look at the filing, then you saw a pretty bad quarter. Here are the
highlights.


Cash on hand declined 32% from $761k to $511k.
