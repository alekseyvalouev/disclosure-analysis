Growing Pains: Pacira Stretched Very Thin Following Exparel Launch
Mar. 13, 2013 9:30 AM ET6 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Pacira Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PCRX) is an emerging specialty pharma company
which in 2012 launched an opiate alternative ("Exparel") for post surgical pain
management. The product is currently approved for use in certain post surgical pain
applications including removal of hemorrhoids and bunions.


Since the product launch in April 2012, the shares have tripled, enjoying a boost from
strong sequential revenue growth along with a surging bull market for healthcare names
across the board.


Pacira Share Price vs. NASDAQ Index


Had the price remained in the $12-13 range, the company could easily be viewed as a
potential acquisition target for a Big Pharma player looking to expand its pain
management portfolio with specialty drugs.


However with the price now hovering close to $30.00, Pacira's market cap is now roughly
$1 billion, making the economics of a buyout prohibitive for any Big Pharma buyer. As a
result, at current prices, Pacira will be forced to justify its valuation by expanding sales and
by ultimately generating its first-ever quarterly profit. It is currently hoped that this will
occur sometime in 2015.

The growth in Pacira's valuation has occurred very quickly, and in fact has significantly
outpaced the growth of Pacira as an operating company as well as the still nascent growth
of its only real commercial product. As a result, it may well be the case that a pull back
around $18.00 should be expected in the near term - a decline of roughly 30%.


This view is supported by the fact that in January, Pacira saw the onset of insider selling
by Sanderling Ventures of around $10 million at a price of $18.93.


Likewise, as soon as the shares broke through $18.50, Pacira was quick to issue a $120
million convertible bond which can be converted into Pacira shares.


As the share price continued to rise, the selling continued as would be expected. On
March 7th, Sanderling once again reported a cashless exercise of warrants netting over
50,000 shares.


On March 11th, three after-hours block trades totaling over 1.3 million shares (nearly $40
million) went through at a 5% discount to the closing price.


Sanderling's recent Form 4 filings shows that it was responsible for an additional 374,000
at $27.73 (also about a 5.5% discount to the day's close). The seller of the remaining 1
million shares should be disclosed shortly.


In any event, the rush seems to be building to begin exiting Pacira at its heightened
valuation. Sanderling has now exited the majority of its position. Most recently, rather than
sell its shares over several days, Sanderling chose to lock in an immediate 5.5% discount.


There are a number of key issues for investors to consider when evaluating Pacira at its
current $29.00 price tag and billion dollar market cap.


Pacira's Exparel was approved by the FDA in 2011 for specific uses in post surgical pain
management, including for removal of hemorrhoids and bunions. Exparel's ability to
facilitate delayed and reduced use of opiate pain killers has caused the company and Wall
Street analysts to project a market opportunity of $1 billion in revenues.


Pacira's Exparel product was commercially launched in April 2012. Sequential revenue
growth has been in the double digits but off of a very low base. Even by the end of its first
year, the product has only just broken though $7.8 million per quarter in sales.


The reason that this is problematic is that the benefit from Exparel had been expected to
be quite monumental in that it would be an easy to implement and dramatically improved
solution vs. opiates and Patient Controlled ("PCA") alternatives.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1269051-growing-pains-pacira-stretched-very-thin-following-exparel-launch 3/14


The fact that after one year, the product has been this slow to be adopted suggests that
the product is far more marginal and far less revolutionary than had been hoped.


This view is supported by looking at the repeat order numbers and customer growth
numbers.


Of its 819 accounts at present, only 13% have ordered more than 10 times, while only
23% have ordered more than six times. Wall Street analysts have chosen to view this
situation as "the glass is 13% full" as opposed to taking the view that "the glass is 87%
empty."


The reason that this is cause for concern is that Pacira has disclosed the total number of
surgeries where Exparel could be appropriate is in excess of 40 million per year,
suggesting that repeat orders would be both numerous and large. This was the basis for
the "$1 billion" revenue prediction.


The magnitude of the revenue stall is evidenced by the fact that Pacira has also disclosed
that it already has access and orders in 75% of the top 100 target hospitals. It is therefore
not the case that the medical community is unaware of the existence of Exparel.


In fact, Pacira's three largest customers (out of 819 total) account for fully 55% of
revenues.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1269051-growing-pains-pacira-stretched-very-thin-following-exparel-launch 4/14


A similar way to look at this problem is by noting the slowing growth in "new account
boxes" per week. When Exparel was launched in April from a base of zero, new account
growth was decent at 60 per week.


Yet by December, that growth rate had already slowed to around 20 per week. Even if we
factor in slowdowns for Thanksgiving and Christmas, that number remains well below 30
per week and continues to trend lower.


Again, to put this in perspective, Pacira has a target market of over 40 million surgeries
per year, yet even with repeat orders, the company is still only showing repeat order boxes
in the hundreds per week.


Even if Pacira were selling 10x this amount, it would not be coming anywhere close to
achieving a meaningful market share vs. its 40 million surgeries. So even though the
sequential growth rate looks good vs. its low base, it continues to be the case that by year
end this hoped-for blockbuster drug had achieved a presence that would not even be
noticed by anyone, unless they had a very specific reason to be following Exparel sales.


By year end, Pacira had sold just 5,497 boxes of Exparel vs. 40 million potential surgeries.


So in fact, even if Exparel were selling at 100x of where it is now (549,700 boxes), it's
market share would still be just over 1%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1269051-growing-pains-pacira-stretched-very-thin-following-exparel-launch 5/14


The de minimis market share by year end was not due to any lack of effort by Pacira. In
fact, Pacira has had a massive and full blown marketing strategy in effect since well
before the commercial launch. Pacira noted the following pre-launch efforts:


Our commercial team has executed on a full range of pre-launch activities for
EXPAREL including:


(NYSE:I) publications and abstracts for the EXPAREL clinical program efficacy and
safety, health outcomes studies, and review articles on postsurgical pain
management;


(ii) health outcomes studies which provide retrospective and prospective analyses
for our hospital customers using their own hospital data to demonstrate the true cost
of opioid-based postsurgical pain management;


(NASDAQ:III) key opinion leader, or KOL, development programs and advisory
boards to address topics of best practice techniques, guidelines and protocols for
the use of EXPAREL, educational needs of our physician, pharmacist and registered
nurse customers, nerve block clinical studies and additional indications for the future
development of EXPAREL and


(iv) education initiatives such as center of excellence programs, preceptorship
programs, pain protocols and predictive models for enhanced patient care, web-
based training and virtual launch programs.


In addition, Pacira had already developed a 60 person sales force dedicated to Exparel.


The point is that Pacira put forth the biggest and best effort possible. But following its
launch in April 2012, Exparel has generated almost no sales relative to what had been
projected.


The double-digit growth against the very small base really only translates into a few
hundred boxes per week.


And as we have seen with past drug launches, blockbuster drugs tend to be blockbusters
from the very beginning because the drugs are novel and fill a much needed void. For
drugs that are slow to be taken up, the chances of eventually morphing into a late
blooming blockbuster are greatly reduced.

However, there is potential for the addressable patient market to increase beyond its
current low level. Pacira is currently evaluating Exparel's potential for use in knee and
chest surgeries. In December, Pacira also announced a partnership with Aratana
Therapeutics which will study Exparel's use as a pain killer in cats and dogs.


It must be kept in mind that Pacira is a company that has never generated a profit and still
operates on a negative gross margin. Against this backdrop, the valuation of nearly $1
billion is clearly unsustainable and is likely to contract in the near term.


When quarterly earnings were announced on March 7th, the shares quickly dropped by
more than 5%. The concern among investors was that the company had done nothing to
reverse its ongoing negative gross margins.


Indeed, Pacira missed on earnings, delivering a loss of $0.50 vs. expectations of a loss of
$0.42.


In fact, even this loss of $0.50 was actually the result of several factors which mitigated a
substantially larger loss.


Total share count had increased dramatically during 2012 from 16.4 million to 30.3 million.
When spread out over the greater number of shares, this reduced the loss from what
would have been $0.93 to just $0.50. Yet even this $0.50 was still a 20% greater loss per
share than had been predicted by analysts.


In addition, 2012 Pacira's financials actually benefited quite substantially from the
termination of two partnerships, both of which were terminated in 2012.


As a result of these partners walking away, Pacira was able to immediately realize a total
of $18.3 million in revenues from "collaborative licensing and development." Each of these
involved revenues which had previously been treated as "deferred revenues." These
revenues are now history and will no longer be recurring. In fact, the amount recognized
from collaborations is actually slightly greater than Pacira's total revenues from actual
"product sales" which will be recurring.


Despite this miss and the impact of helpful mitigating factors, analysts were quick to raise
their share price targets on Pacira by nearly 50%. Yet with share price targets of
$32.00-$33.00, the current share price is now just 10% below analyst targets for 1-year
performance.


Following the 5% drop into the $24.00 range, the analyst upgrades caused Pacira to jump
as much as 20% to over $30.00

There are quite a few near-term factors which the analysts seem to be ignoring as they
take a long term and hopeful view for eventual profitability and material revenues.


Marketing expense is substantial, but is not the element which dominates the equation. In
most cases, early stage pharma companies must expend an amount which is greater than
their early stage revenues in order to successfully market their product and grow their
revenue stream.


In Q4, Pacira spent $13.3 million on SG&A, well above the Q4 product sales of $8.2
million. For 2012, Pacira spent $46 million on SG&A, which is well more than double the
$18.1 million in product sales. But again, this is not the problem.


Instead, the real problem is that unlike most one-product pharma companies, Pacira also
suffers from a negative gross margin. Pacira is actually selling its drug at a price which is
less than the cost to manufacture it. In fact, for Q4 Pacira had a negative gross margin of
-18%.


The reason for this is that Pacira still incurs fixed costs of around $30 million for
manufacturing Exparel, along with variable costs of around 10-15%.


On the recent conference call, it was noted that:


In 2013 and 2014 as we're putting Suite C online, that fixed cost number may move
around, may tick up a little bit, as I indicated, because we're doing those two things
in parallel. But as we get beyond into '14 and we're operating only in Suite C, we
should have just a fixed cost number that might be in the 30, $35 million range. We'll
have to see as we go forward here.


What this means is that the negative gross margin will continue until such time as there is
a substantial ramp up of sales of Exparel.


Making this goal a reality will certainly take both time and luck. On the conference call, the
CEO noted that:


We are on track to break even during 2014 and we continue to believe that Exparel
represents a blockbuster platform for post-surgical pain control.


The key takeaway from this is that for at least 1-2 more years, we should not expect any
profit whatsoever from Pacira. An eventual profit from Pacira will no doubt depend upon
Exparel achieving "blockbuster" status.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1269051-growing-pains-pacira-stretched-very-thin-following-exparel-launch 8/14


Both Pacira management and Wall St. analysts have conducted a bottom up analysis of
the post surgical pain management market and have come to a conclusion that Exparel
represents a "$1 billion opportunity" - i.e. a blockbuster.


In fact, many drug companies across a wide range of products regularly conduct a similar
type of analysis and the results are always very large revenue predictions.


Yet when we look at the overall drug market from a top down perspective, we can see that
billion-dollar drugs, which are so commonly predicted, are seldom realized in the real
world. This is just an observable fact in the marketplace based on actual sales data.


As noted by a recent article at the Pharmacy Times, in order to make the list of "best
selling drugs of 2011" a drug needs to reach revenues of just $2.7 billion. Any drugs with
revenues in the $1 billion range are also very close to the best seller list. Yet in order to
get to this level, Pacira will need to quickly increase annual sales by about 300x.


In early 2012, investors began showing caution when anticipating near term revenues
from new drug launches. The caution was well deserved. Even drugs which saw hundreds
of millions in sales in their first quarter post launch saw their share prices decline from
previously run up prices.


Shares of Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) had ended the year 44% below their 52 week high,
even though it had achieved record breaking sales of $420 million for just its first quarter
on the market.


Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) launched its macular degeneration drug Eylea and within
just 6 weeks, it had achieved total sales of $25 million.


By contrast, Pacira ended its first year with just $14.6 million in total sales of Exparel.


Now it is 2013 and risk appetite has increased dramatically among investors, yet a
January article entitled "Drug Launch Failures: A Rising Trend" shows that this optimism
may have gotten ahead of itself.


The fact that Exparel has been on the market for a full year and has only generated
revenues of $14.6 million basically tells us in advance that its blockbuster potential has
been dramatically overestimated by both management and by analysts.


This is all the more applicable given that these small revenues result from Exparel's status
as a full-price solution without any current generic equivalents.

Exparel's revenues will likely to continue to show continued steady growth off of its very
low base. Yet even if revenue growth were to suddenly jump to exponential levels, it would
take years to come anywhere close to what is being forecast.


And the overarching reality is that if the product was not an immediate success when
launched, then there is no new catalyst which would cause growth to suddenly become
exponential.


Still a small cap company with growing pains


Now that its market cap is approaching $1 billion, Pacira will be viewed by many as an
emerging mid-cap stock. But while the stock appears to be a mid cap, the underlying
company still bears all the hallmarks of a small-cap company with many of the predictable
challenges and growing pains.


In 2012 and prior to the launch of Exparel, Pacira had been dependent upon both
DeopDur and DepoCyte for its revenues. But then its partners Novo and EKR terminated
their partnerships with Pacira.


Pacira subsequently disclosed that:


We do not expect our currently marketed products, other than EXPAREL, to
generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability because we expect
to continue to incur significant expenses as we commercialize EXPAREL and
advance the development of product candidates, seek FDA approval for our product
candidates that successfully complete clinical trials and develop our sales force and
marketing capabilities to prepare for their commercial launch.


Yet these terminations actually had the effect of boosting the revenue which Pacira was
allowed to report to investors. Revenues which had previously been accounted for as
"deferred revenue" were able to be immediately recognized in full.


On the manufacturing side, it can also be seen that Pacira is facing similar challenges to
many of its peers with a fraction of the market cap. It is the manufacturing difficulties that
have caused Pacira to sell its only commercial product at a price which is below cost. This
is still a work in progress.


Also in 2012, the Medicines and Healthcare products Administration conducted a standard
inspection of Pacira's manufacturing facilities and noted certain "critical deficiencies." The
result was a cessation of manufacturing activities for DepoCyte along with a selective

product recall.


As with many small-cap companies, much of the valuation for Pacira lies in hopes and
expectations that there will be additional applications that may expand the revenue
potential. Yet investors often fail to appropriately monitor and handicap these new
developments.


Internally, Pacira also has made use of a number of notably small-cap business practices
such as related party transactions.


For example, in reality Pacira only retains a part time Chief Medical Officer who acts as a
consultant rather than an employee.


Pacira's Chief Medical Officer, Gary Patou, is actually a Managing Director with MPM
Capital, an investment fund which owns shares of Pacira. Under the terms of his
"consulting agreement" with Pacira, the Chief Medical Officer is only required to spend up
to 50% of his time working for Pacira.


Pacira CEO David Stack is also a Managing Director from MPM. Separate from that he
also has his own company called "Stack Pharmaceuticals" where he serves as Managing
Partner. The StackPharma ("SPI") webpage discloses Mr. Stack's roles as follows:


Through an SPI engagement, he is currently serving as President, CEO, and a
member of the Board of Directors of Pacira and is also a Managing Director at MPM
Capital.


In addition, Dave is a Director of Bio-Imaging Technologies, Inc., PepTx, Inc.,
Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Elixir Pharmaceuticals Inc.


Under the original consulting agreements with Stack Pharmaceuticals, Pacira ended up
paying Stack over $500,000 for items such as office space, a telephone system, work on
its website and research for Exparel.


Stack Pharma continues to use the same street address that Pacira uses on its SEC
filings, which is at #5 Sylvan Way in Parsippany, NJ.


Previously, Pacira's Vice President, Commercial, Taunia Markvicka also came from David
Stack's Stack Pharmaceutical, holding a dual role between Stack and Pacira.

Pacira Board Member Gary Pace also receives a large amount of consulting income from
Pacira which is separate from the income he receives for being a director. His consulting
income has been rising very quickly.


In June 2011, the original agreement provided for $5,000 per month in consulting income
plus the right to receive 10,000 shares.


Within 9 months, the income was doubled to $10,000 per month along with a doubled
20,000 shares.


Within a few months of this, these amounts were again revised upwards to $15,000 per
month (with a removal of the annual cap) along with a substantial 70,000 shares of Pacira.


So that ends up being $180,000 per year plus options on over $2 million worth of stock
being awarded to a board member for the separate (non-board) consulting services he
provides to the company. In addition to that, Mr. Pace is eligible for a $200,000 bonus in
connection to the Suite C manufacturing facilities being built by Pacira.


In the proxy, it was noted that:


As a result of Dr. Pace's new compensation arrangements, the board determined
that he will no longer qualify as an "independent director" under applicable NASDAQ
rules. As a result, Dr. Pace intends to resign from his position as chairman of the
nominating and corporate governance committee and a new chairman will be
appointed at the committee's next meeting.


With arrangements like these in place, it would obviously be quite inappropriate for Dr.
Pace to continue chairing any corporate governance committee.


The role of Governance Chair had previously paid Dr. Pace $10,000 per year prior to his
resignation.


In addition to supplying Pacira with its part time Chief Medical Officer and Chief Executive
Officer, MPM Capital has also been supplying Pacira with deals.


MPM is a shareholder of Aratana, which will now be collaborating with Pacira on the use
of Exparel as a pain killer in cats and dogs.


MPM is also a shareholder and board member in Rhythm Pharmaceuticals which also
recently entered into an agreement with Pacira.

Yet despite the decidedly small cap impression left by this series of related party issues,
Pacira management has taken a notably large-cap approach to executive compensation.


For the prior two years, compensation to the top three executives exceeded $4.5 million
even though Pacira continues to operate with a negative gross margin and at a time when
annual revenues were only $15 million.


Likewise, directors have also made out well, with total director compensation of around $1
million for the past two years, as disclosed in the last proxy.


In addition, option grants were quite substantial in 2012. During 2011, there were 395,000
options issued, taking the balance of options outstanding to 2.3 million.


Yet in 2012 alone, there were 2.1 million new options granted, bringing the total balance of
options outstanding to 4.0 million. Of these, 3.9 million are vested as of December 31,
2012.


This compares to a total outstanding share count of 30 million, so roughly 13% of the total
current share count. The average exercise price is just $7.78.


Conclusion


Pacira has an interesting product in Exparel. The product may allow use of opiates which
is either delayed, reduced or both. Yet the very slow adoption of the drug to date
demonstrates that the drug will most likely fall well short of its hoped-for blockbuster
status.


The stock price has soared due to optimism over its "billion dollar" prospects and due to a
hyper bullish market for development stage drug companies.


With the stock having tripled to close to $30.00 and a $1 billion market cap, it seems that
the market is still ignoring the fact that Pacira has negative gross margins and no
prospects for profitability for the next two years.


Analysts from the company's investment bankers have been quick to revise their share
price predictions upwards, even when earnings targets have been missed by a wide
margin, and even as realized revenues have been minimal and have generated negative
gross margins.


When the market cap of a small-cap company soars, investors often forget that the
underlying company may still be operating as a company with very small-cap
characteristics and small-cap risks.
