Citron Exposes the Dirty Secrets of j2 Global (JCOM)! 
Targets:  $40 Near Term, $27 within One Year,  


Single Digits Long Term 
 





For years j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) has been a darling of Wall Street and a 
nemesis for short sellers. The company has spun a high-tech story of “cloud 
computing”, digital media, and mergers and acquisitions. All the while, it is being 
funded by its legacy eFax business.  
 


That is the story they want you to hear. 
 


The real story, exposed here for the first time, is a company spending a billion on 
a roll-up strategy with negative organic growth.  J2 has been buying money-losing 
commoditized cloud computing companies, combining them with a non-
performing digital media strategy to inflate its top line, as EBIDTA runs in place.  
 


Why Has The Bull Case on eFax Finally Come to an End? 
 


In this report, Citron will show in new disclosures contained in j2 Global’s 10-K, 
that the company’s core business has hit a wall.  More importantly, the barrier to 


entry of their cash cow eFax business is gone as it finally comes off patent 
protection.  This is the beginning of the endgame after the company spent years 
rolling up a near monopoly control of an industry in decline. 
 


Citron analyzes all three of j2’s businesses, providing a basis for a fair 
and optimistic sum of the parts analysis which supports our price 
target: $27. 


  Note to Readers:  
Citron has spent considerable time and effort to prepare this story. We 
suggest you take your time, read the analysis and supporting documents, 
and make your own informed investing decision. The work is compelling, 
and we are confident in our conclusions. But read before you trade!

  The REAL story behind eFax and its Future 
 


For years short sellers have called for the end of j2 by stating the fax machine and 
electronic faxes will soon go the way of the dial-up modem. This point is obvious 
by just observing the Google trends on "internet fax" and "eFax": 
 


 
 
BUT!!! What the bears underestimated was j2’s ability to generate cash flow by 
dominating a business in decline. 
 


To be fair, there is still enough business using fax-to-email to deem this business 
"Not Yet Dead". While many have called eFax the worst part of their business, in 
reality it has been and remains the best part of their business. 
 


While j2 does not disclose its utter dependence on eFax services for its bottom 
line profits, Citron has done the homework. A single line stands out in the just-
filed 10-K (undisclosed in prior years): 
 





We rely heavily on the revenue generated by our fax services. 
Currently, a substantial portion of our revenue is fax-to-email related and 
constitutes 42% of our consolidated revenues. 
.”

Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 3 of 21 
 


To understand this story, it is pivotal to observe that j2 does not disclose a 
revenue breakdown by brand or service. It conflates eFax and a portfolio of 
copycat brands that offer the same service (including MyFax, SmartFax, 
MetroFax, RapidFax, Send2Fax, TrustFax, etc.) into its "Cloud Services Revenue" 
“segment” with other online utilities. Because we have reason to believe that all 
of these other “cloud computing” operations lose money, judging the quality of 
their acquisitions, and the performance of competitive businesses, we are left to 
conclude that 87% of j2’s operating income comes from fax related services.

Note to analysts: 
 





What the company and the analysts never discuss is the sustainability of the 
moat around this profit stream. So that's where we begin.  
 


Dirty Secret#1       :  
 
j2 fax-to-email strategy has been built on the importance of what is 
known as the “638 patent” which covers electronic faxing. Do not take it from 
us:  here it is directly from Stanford Journal of Law in discussing the practices of j2 


"Don't even bother opening your mouth unless you can publish a reliable 
estimate of how much of J2 Global's net revenue is directly attributable to its 
fax-to-email services."  


-- Andrew Left, Editor, Citron Research
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 4 of 21 
 


Global (page 290). Note this is an excerpt from a much larger criticism of the 
business ethics and practices of j2 from the perspective of patent trolling: 
 


First, j2 Global has sued a striking number of its competitors, and many, although not all, of the lawsuits 
were against relatively small competitors.124 j2 Global argues that most of the companies offering 
Internet fax services have modest revenues, which limits the potential damages and makes it 
economically sensible for the parties to settle for relatively small amounts.125 Nevertheless, suing small 
companies has the happy coincidence of ensuring that most will be unable to fight back, given that 
patent litigation can cost 1-5 million dollars.126 For a small revenue company, it is difficult to justify that 
type of expenditure -and even more difficult to find a patent litigator willing to take your case. 127 In 
addition to its wide-ranging assertion campaign, j2 Global also has had a remarkably large appetite for 
acquiring competitors and related companies, both here and abroad. A quick search of press reports as 
well as j2 Global's releases shows j2 Global acquiring more than 20 companies, including acquisitions in 
Canada, the UK, Ireland, Europe, Hong Kong, and Australia.128 Some of the companies acquired were 
ones that j2 Global had previously sued for patent infringement,129 raising the question of whether the 
lawsuits and patent assertions could have played a role in reducing the price, distracting management, 
or otherwise disadvantaging a target prior to purchase. In particular, j2 Global has been able to acquire 
some of the companies that have created the greatest headaches for them, including two of the three 
companies that purportedly objected to j2 Global's trademark filing as well as Venali. (Venali had filed 
antitrust claims,130 which were dismissed on summary judgment, and was eventually successful in 
proving that j2 Global's [AudioFax] patents related only to telephone fax systems and not to Venali's 


Internet fax services.)'

After spending a decade suing, then buying competitors who could have undercut 
pricing in a race to the bottom (which is "free") j2 has hit a wall in the acquisition 
game at the same moment their patent protection is expiring. 
 


 Sept 30, 2016 and April 1, 2017…tick-tock, tick-tock  
 


j2 makes a lot of noise about its portfolio of patents, many of which were 
acquired in a lawsuit-strewn acquisition path, whose true ownership is still being 
litigated.  
 


At the core of this strategy, they rely specifically on a root U.S. patent 6208638, 
which they have taken to the courts numerous times to protect. Nowhere in its 
SEC filings, nor in the analysts' ridiculous models, is the truth reflected that this 
key patent, the protective moat which protects over 40% of j2's gross revenues, 


and likely well over 75% of its net income, expires as protection against any 
and all competition in just 13 months.

Note: The other commonly referenced patent 6350066 in the above litigation 
links, expired last year. It covered storing incoming messages in a database. 
Obviously analysts did not pick up on that either.  
 


In another case, filed in June 2013, J2 Global vs. EC Data Systems, which currently 
operates  Faxage.com . This suit clearly asserts violation of 6020980 which covers 
"Facsimile Delivery to Electronic Mail". This patent expires Sept 30, 2016, just 6 + 
months from today.  
 


 
Examine j2's patent disclosure page carefully. The root '638 patent is listed first; 
that's the one that expires April 1, 2017. Of the 27 patents listed, 9 are already 
expired, and all but 4 will expire by 2019.  
 


Dirty Secret #2         : 
 


The only way j2 has been able to maintain the profitability of its fax-to-email 
business is through highly controversial and aggressive (if not fraudulent) billing 
practices. In proving this point we use as a source j2-owned PC Mag. While we can 
find many sources that publish public complaints about j2’s dubious billing policy, 
nothing is better than the company's own "flagship" brand. 
 


Despite eFax receiving an “excellent 
rating” and numerous "Editors Choice" 
awards from PC Mag,  (here, here, and 
here – kind of like your mother telling 


you you're good looking  all 34 reviews by users express  
nothing but disdain, using words like: "scam", "fraud",

Here are just two; the rest are all as bad or worse:   
 





Systematic entrapment of customers into recurring subscription fees explains j2's 
aggressive "investment" in controlling the space. They staunchly refuse to allow 
their customers phone number portability (only disclosed in very fine print on 
signup, and, ironically, a rule enforced on telecom providers but not them).  You 
can see how j2's abysmal customer service serves its interests. Its customers are 
trapped by design; j2 has no incentive to offer more.  
 


Note:  Citron does not claim that j2 will lose its legacy business overnight, but 
asserts that Wall Street cannot avoid applying a proper multiple to a business 
marked by: 
 


 negative organic growth  


 a dying industry  


 abusive and deceptive customer experience  


 and most of all, imminent loss of intellectual property protection 
 


So What is a Fax-to-Email Business Worth? 
 


Citron suggests it is more than generous to give this business a 2x 2016 revenue. 
Considering the lack of IP, organic growth, and overall trends of the industry:  This 


Rebecca Gaffney • 2 months ago 
EFAX IS THE WORST - I had almost a carbon copy experience of Andro's and everyone else's. 
Their service was wonky and crappy between my iPhone and computer, and I cancelled it after 2 
days. They charged me a month later anyway, and I sent them an email online asking them to 
cancel the account again. They did not, and I ending up calling them to make sure they cancelled 
the account and refunded my money. They were very rude about it - Megan and her supervisor 
Nick - and refused to refund my money, though they claim it's cancelled. They are the worst and 
need to be put out of business. I agree about PC magazine - get it together, guys! 


Andro Athan • 6 months ago 
This is one of my worst experience, efax is not not unethical but a punch of liars. 
I trusted them with my credit card details, tried the service once for my small company then 
realized it not right for me then cancelled the subscription in 2 days. 
2 months after, they charged me for the subscription and after calling them and writing many 
emails, the answer is 'NO REFUND POLICY' even if you are unlawfully charged for a subscription 
that you never used. 
Be aware and be smart. efax experience is 'easy to get in but difficult to let you go for any reason 
even if you are dissatisfied'. Decent people won't work for such companies

For Fax-to-Email Services  


2X 2016 revenue of $365 million = 


$730 million 


 
  The REAL Story behind j2’s "Cloud Computing" Business 





To create a foggy picture for investors and analysts, j2 has conflated its fax-to-
email revenues with cloud services businesses that offering backup, storage, and 
email security to small businesses. You can include in this pile a small amount of 
email marketing and web hosting. All of these businesses are fragmented and 
compete in spaces that have become highly commoditized. These types of 
companies have been the backbone of j2's M&A strategy.   
 


Despite these being boring money losing business, J2 has thoroughly prostituted 
the word “cloud”.  j2 uses the word "cloud" in its 10-K  169 times – more than 
Salesforce and Workday combined…if bullshit was only profits. 
 


Dirty Secret #3      :   


“Cloudy” with a Chance of Bullshit  
Putting aside digital media, which we will discuss below, everything bought for 
j2’s “cloud computing portfolio” aside from fax-to-email is commoditized, 
unprofitable junk, with no new or unique technology and no leverage.  The only 
thing cloudy about this is appearances.   
 


There is no evidence that j2 Global has ever put a profitable cloud business (other 
than fax-to-email) in this segment.  Here are some examples of attempted 
acquisitions j2 has tried to put under the “cloud”. 
 


How bad are these acquisitions? 
 


Citron found the financials of only one company they acquired, plus two they 
attempted to buy but were rejected, to better understand j2’s REAL M&A 
strategy. On Aug 23, 2012, Zintel was acquired by JCOM with a disclaimer of “not 
material financials. What very few realized is that Zintel was publicly listed on the

http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=702008
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 8 of 21 
 


New Zealand Stock Exchange. A review of Zintel’s pre-acquisition financials shows 
a company incurring net losses despite revenue of $58 million.  
 


In the same year j2's attempted to buy Lyris but was rejected. Lyris had over $250 
million of accumulated losses and declining revenues with a net loss of $10 mil 
the year before the offer.  


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1166220/000104746912008858/a2210897z10-k.htm 
 


Similarly j2 was rejected 3 times in attempts to buy Carbonite, which lost $22 
million last year. 
 


What is j2's "Cloud" (Mostly Storage and Backup) Business 
Actually Worth?  
 


All of the acquired business in the cloud space seems to have been losing money, 
with negative organic growth. Yet Citron will still assign a 2x revenue multiple for 
this category which is more than generous.  Practically speaking, many of the 
acquired companies would probably be out of business in this highly competitive 
industry still searching for profits. Don’t forget, the real competitors in this space 
include Google, Apple, and Microsoft.  
 
 


For Cloud Storage, Backup and Misc  Services 
(without fax-to-email or voice services) 


2X 2016 revenue of $184 million = 


$368 million 
 


The Truth About Digital Media 
Wall Street has cheered the emergence of JCOM’s Digital Media business since 
2012, hoisting a banner of "revenue diversification", now representing 30% of 
revenues in 2015. j2’s digital media business operates websites including 
PCMag.com, ZiffDavis, AskMen, IGN and SpeedTest.net. 
 


Dirty Secret #4      :  


All of the websites operated by j2 are either flat to down over the past 3 years.  
What is nice about quantifying digital properties is that traffic doesn’t lie. From 
Comscore data, as presented in the Susquehanna analysts reports, here is the 
traffic of their flagship properties.

( Blue dashes are j2 properties in the following graphs)
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 10 of 21 
 


(Blue dashes are j2 properties in this graph) 
 
 








What we see from the above charts is that organic traffic across j2 Global's 
flagship properties is flat to down over the past 3 years. (The only exception is the 
one-time bump in tech when j2 Global acquired Speedtest.net.)  One of the most 
glaring deficiencies of j2’s digital media business is the absence of any actual 
mobile strategy.  These are traditional content sites and click bait. 
 


Much like every other acquisition fed into the machine, when they acquired 
Speedtest they used their standard line that is used to comment on every 
acquisition:  
 


 
http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=885561 


While we give j2's management credit for diversifying revenues amongst their 
online properties, and squeezing as much juice as they can out of these 
businesses, you have to admit that these are all business on the decline. Organic 
traffic is flat or declining across all their properties over the past 3 years. 
Meanwhile, content has evolved, and sites like PCMag.com and Askmen.com are 
just not what they used to be. 
 


“Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed and the financial impact to 
j2 Global is not expected to be material.” 
 



http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=885561
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 11 of 21 
 


So what is the REAL value of digital media?? 
 


Considering both of j2’s nameplate assets were bought out of distress less than 4 
years ago, we credit management for breathing life into the corpses. But let's be 
realistic about valuations. The best comparison Citron could find would be to 
compare these “second tier” sites to those owned by Interactive Corp. 
 


Interactive owns a more compelling portfolio of web assets.  
 


j2 Global Portfolio IAC/Interactive Corp 


IGN (189) Ask.com (71) 


PCmag.com (349) Vimeo (131) 


Askmen.com (1669) Investopedia (488) 
Extremetech.com (3,110) CollegeHumor (1,465) 


Geek.com (3,382) Daily Beast (223) 


Speedtest.net (251 in US)  
 


IAC Valuation (not including Match)       


        EV Revenue 
EV / 
Rev 





IAC (w/ Match)   $4,675 $3,231 1.4x 
Match    $3,936 $1,020 3.9x 
Ownership Portion   84.6% 84.6%  
Proportional Match owned by IAC ($3,330) ($863) 3.9x 
IAC (without Match.com, no j2 
comparable property) $1,345 $2,368 0.6x 
 


So we see that the IAC properties trade at 0.6 x revenue. But let's be more 
generous than that. Let's find a flagship online property with a top 30 traffic with 
a compelling brand, just so we can be optimistic. We'll use the flagship of all 
digital media content – the New York Times (the 23


rd
 most visited site in the US) 


that trades at 1x revenue. But Citron is feeling generous so we will give them 1.5 
x 2016 revenue.  
Note: Citron is still highly doubtful that j2's digital media revenues can possibly 
grow from $216 mil in 2015 to $270 mil in 2016 … without more acquisitions.

THE BigGEST Dirty Secret  


OF THEM ALL :           


From fax to cloud to digital media, what Wall Street is really most 
excited about in JCOM is the wonderful machine illustrated below.  
Put in shit...and out comes gold! 
 








“We like the company's M&A program and think if negative market 
conditions persist it may afford the company attractive acquisition 
opportunities.”  


  -- JMP Securities, Feb 11, 2016
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 13 of 21 
 











Guess what, Wall Street. The machine doesn’t create gold after all – 
it’s really only fool's gold.   
 
 
 


  The Only Thing about the JCOM machine that you 
Need to Know 
 


Since 2013, cumulative Enterprise Value has ballooned 87%, from 
$2,253m to $4,214m.   


Meanwhile, EBIT has grown a scant 14%, from $175m to only $199m. 
 
 


“We believe that j2 management will continue to use its ample cash 
position on strategic M&A opportunities targeting profitable growth, 
entering new geographies, and developing its cloud businesses to 
complement its fax services.”  


  -- JMP Securities, Feb 11, 2016  
 
 


“Accretive M&A is a key part of j2’s value creation strategy where the 
company acquires under-optimized assets (either under-monetized or with 
subscale margins or both) at attractive valuations (usually around 2x 
revenue) and synergizes them accordingly.”  


  -- Susquehanna, Nov 4, 2015 
 
 


“We continue to believe the major catalysts for the stock will be M&A 
(especially mid-to-large size deals) and realization of synergies.”

One Word Changes Everything! 
 


Citron has made a career of finding that one piece of information that is critical to 
a business but goes widely unnoticed by Wall Street. In this case it comes in j2’s 
just filed 10-K for 2015. Previously, the company disclosed that it “may acquire 
companies in order to grow” and now we see for the first time that word has 
changed to “MUST”.  
 


What should be disturbing to every shareholder, is that while the 
analysts urge on j2’s indiscriminate acquisition binge onward, they 
missed the one new disclosure in JCOM’s most recent 10-K filings that 
changes everything:

(The “must"s above were previously “may”s) 
 


The company no longer wants acquisitions, it needs acquisitions.  This 
admission is death to roll-up organizations, as it admits to its negative 
organic growth and has fallen victim to the law of large numbers.  
 


j2 has become so desperate to acquire some form of cloud revenue, they have 
stooped to actually advertising on their own corporate website they will “buy 
your company”… This is so bottom of the barrel for a company this size.

  Citron Adds Up the Parts   


J2’s organic growth story is broken.  Therefore, a generous sum-of-the-parts 
analysis is needed.  The segment value assumptions made in this report, which

  Citron’s Dirty Little Secret: 


The Risks of Ignoring Risk Factors 
 


We are often asked how we spot and evaluate candidates for reports. There is no 
substitute for hard work and a lot of reading. The best place to read is a 
company’s 10-K filings, focusing especially on its risk disclosure section. Most risks 
disclosed in these sections are boilerplate text written by attorneys. Others 
identify the company’s actual material weaknesses.  And nobody tells you which 
are which.  More importantly, no one tells you which of the risks are imminent 
and real. This is one of the perspectives that Citron Research provides.

Our comments on the above findings:  


J2 Global Disclosed Risk Factor Risk 
Level 


Citron Comments 


Inability to sustain growth or 
profitability, particularly in light of an 
uncertain U.S. and worldwide 
economy and the related impact on 
customer acquisition, retention and 
usage levels, advertising spend and 
credit and debit card payment 
declines  





Generic comment about the risks of the 
U.S. and worldwide economy. Duh.  


Reduced use of fax services due to 
increased use of email, scanning or 
widespread adoption of digital 
signatures or otherwise  





Gigantic, imminent looming competitive 
factor that threatens 75% or more of J2's 
net cash flow and net income, against 
which they have no strategic defense. Can 
anyone spell DocuSign? 


Inability to acquire businesses on 
acceptable terms or successfully 
integrate and realize anticipated 
synergies. 





See our comments on p2 and 7 - 9. JCOM's 
acquisitions are becoming desperate and 
non-accretive. Despite spending 1 billion 
over 5 years, and accruing 600M in debt, 
the needle isn't moving and potential 
targets are spurning them.  


Failure to offer compelling digital 
media content causing reduced 
traffic and advertising levels; loss of 
advertisers or reduction in 
advertising spend; increased 
prevalence or effectiveness of 
advertising blocking technologies; 
inability to monetize handheld 
devices and handheld traffic 
supplanting monetized traffic.  





Obviously already happening, see 
Comscore Unique Visitors graph on page 
12 and 13. Three years of flatlines across 
all their most recognizable digital media 
brands; clearly margins for digital content 
companies is imploding; the market values 
Yahoo's content at zero. What is j2's 
honestly worth?  


New or unanticipated costs or tax 
liabilities, including those relating to 
federal and state income tax and 
indirect taxes, such as sales, value-
added and telecommunications 
taxes. 





Generic comment about changes in 
taxation that would affect every online 
business. Zzzzz.
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 19 of 21 
 


Inability to manage certain risks 
inherent to our business, such as 
fraudulent activity, system failure or 
a security breach  





Citron wonders when the systemic 
customer abuse detailed in numerous 
online reviews related to refund policies, 
phone number non-transferability, poor 
customer support, etc. really piss someone 
off enough to hack them.  


Competition from others with regard 
to price, service, content and 
functionality  





Look out for Hellofax and a host of others, 
plus tighter integration of fax-to-email 
services  within the next year as the barrier 
to entry is gone. 


Inadequate intellectual property (IP) 
protection, expiration or invalidity of 
key patents, violations of 3rd party IP 
rights or inability or significant delay 
in monetizing IP   


Core patent protecting fax-to-email 
expires less than 13 months from today.  
9 of 27 disclosed patents are already 
expired. Key patents expiring this year and 
next; by 2019 all but 4 of the 27 will be 
expired.  


Inability to continue to expand our 
business and operations 
internationally  





Citron wonders what this means. Does it 
include the same abusive refund policies, 
or does the EC prohibit that kind of online 
abuse of customers?   


Inability to maintain required 
services on acceptable terms with 
financially stable telecom, co-
location and other critical vendors; 
and inability to obtain telephone 
numbers in sufficient quantities on 
acceptable terms and in desired 
locations  





Sounds like this one is in here because the 
lawyers made them, and to have some 
true snoozers to dilute the toxic ones. 
Zzzzz 


Level of debt limiting availability of 
cash flow to reinvest in the business; 
inability to repay or refinance debt 
when due; and restrictive covenants 
relating to debt imposing operating 
and financial restrictions on business 
activities or plans  





Rollups are only good until they stop being 
good. The company's debt is up from zero 
to 600 million in 5 years; during which 
time J2 has generated negative $245 
million cash flow after acquisitions.  


Inability to maintain and increase our 
cloud services customer base or 
average revenue per user  





ARPU growth of 2.1% per year over last 2 
years, highly questionable churn rate 
definition. ARPU growth isn't going to save 
them from the huge risks in this table.
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 20 of 21 
 


Enactment of burdensome 
telecommunications, Internet, 
advertising or other regulations, or 
being subject to existing regulations  





Zzzzzz ... as long as ensnaring customers in 
an agreement they can't cancel and get 
refunded doesn't become subject to 
regulations.  


Inability to adapt to technological 
change and diversify services & 
related revenues at acceptable levels 
of financial return  





Sounds a lot like the description of the fax-
to-email service eFax provides. The 
company's main investment in 
competition has been patent trolling, and 
the state of their patent portfolio clearly 
shows declining utility of that investment 
in forward years.  


Loss of services of executive officers 
and other key employees  





Zzzzzz 


Other factors set forth in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K filed by us on 
March 2, 2015 with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) 
and the other reports we file from 
time-to-time with the SEC. 





Huge changes in the 10-K disclosures over 
the last couple of years. Citron suggests all 
investors read the red boxes on pages 2, 6, 
and 9.  





  Conclusion  
 


It is Citron’s opinion that j2 Global has spent the past four years using the money 
generated by its legacy eFax business to prop the financials of a collection of 
unremarkable and/or useless assets that have all been acquired with terms 
undisclosed.  
 


It's all about the machine!!!  
While Wall Street analysis are tripping over themselves in excitement about the 
future of M&A at j2 Global, no one seems to be paying any attention to the 
bottom line or the quality of businesses j2 Global is aggregating.  
 


The valuation of $27 given to j2 by Citron is more than fair. It isn't exaggeratedly 
pessimistic either ... once the pyrite is uncovered and carefully analyzed. 
 


Stay Tuned for Part 2 
 


In the interest of clarity and focus, Citron did not want to jam too many 
accounting details into this story. Part 2 will focus on the aggressive accounting
Citron Reports on J2 Global March 10, 2016 Page 21 of 21 
 


commonly used in busted roll ups, along with further focus on the accounting 
shenanigans used by j2 to obfuscate their real financials, including the real vs. 
misleading definitions of churn and customer counts.
