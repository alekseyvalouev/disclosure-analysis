A CHAIN IS ONLY AS
STRONG AS ITS WEAKEST
LINK: CITRON COMMENTS
ON INTEROIL AFTER A 7
YEAR HIATUS.


The Interoil story that has gone widely
unnoticed — Why John Paulson might get
�eas


While investors might be cheering or relieved to see
news that Interoil has found a new CEO, Citron believes
that investors might be looking at the wrong piece of
news.


For those of you short selling history bu�s, you might
remember that Citron was the �rst to write about
Interoil (NYSE:IOC), documenting its questionable cast
of characters and lack of reserves… back in 2005.  It has
been 8.5 years since we titled the headline on our story


“If you wish to be a success in the world,
promise everything, deliver nothing.”


— Napoleon Bonaparte

At the time, the stock was trading within 10% of its
current price. 


More notably at the end of 2006 we warned investors:


“While unchanged in its belief that the gas IOC
discovered is unlikely to be monetized ever, we
acknowledge the credibility of the story opens
the door for IOC to raise new desperately needed
equity to keep itself in the game for a long time.
Any short term catalyst for the stock to go lower
has seemed to disappear.”


We will not take this time to rehash the bear case which
has been told ad naseum in most every media outlet in
the world.  Instead we want to focus on one
coincidence that has gone widely unnoticed – which
could indeed be the weak link that causes the entire
Interoil story to unravel.


One of the most impressive aspects of the Interoil
promotion is their constant ability to attract “brand
name” shareholders who have rotated over the past 9
years.  Their current “brand name” holders are none
other than John Paulson and Richard Chandler, who
beyond their riches and prior successes, were both
holding the bag in the Sino-Forest debacle.


The story that Citron wants shareholders to focus on
now is that of the involvement of John Thomas
Financial and Tommy Belesis in Interoil.

In 2009, Interoil was facing a precarious situation.  They
needed their stock price to close above $32.50 for
�fteen days to force a conversion of debt to equity. 


The CEO of John Thomas Financial was none other than
the colorful Tommy Belesis who was able to transform
himself into a Hollywood bit-part actor, while
transforming Interoil from a stock promotion into a

sub-plot of the movie “Wall Street 2:  Money Never
Sleeps”.


But the plot has now gone sour.  On March 22, 2013,
Belesis was charged with fraud by the SEC:

April 15, 2013, three weeks later in a completely
unrelated matter, Belesis was charged with fraud by
FNRA.

broker-threats-1-.html]


Exactly one week later, Phil Mulacek resigned as the
CEO of Interoil, which he had nursed along from its
infancy for over a decade.  Citron notes how the
abruptness of his resignation stands out, and comes
with no logical explanation.

press-releases/2013-2/interoil-corporation-announces-

It should be noted that Mulacek’s relation to Belesis did
not stop at Interoil.  Mulacek’s brother, also a founding
member of Interoil, Pierre Mulacek, had an OTC
company that also did business with John Thomas
Financial.

So here is how it ties together:

Citron will make the assumption that a company like
John Thomas Financial did not just one day
independently stumble upon Interoil as its best idea for
an excellent investment.  John Thomas was a boiler
room operation, where hundreds of “phone chimps”
cold-called prospects to sell them the “house stock”. 
Moreover, we are making the assumption that
somewhere in that relationship was an unholy alliance
that involved stock manipulation and that Tommy
Belesis knows a lot more about Interoil and Mulacek
than anyone wants him to.


Just yesterday we read that John Thomas has pulled its
registration from FNRA — the �rm will cease to exist.

[http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20130710/FREE/13071


We believe this is a precursor to the next piece of news,
which will be an indictment against Belesis.  If you read
the charges of pump and dump and physically bullying
brokers, it does not take a Wall Street historian to
understand this will end in the hands of a criminal
prosecuting attorney. 


When that happens, what does Tommy do?  If anyone
knows the secrets of IOC, it is Tommy Belesis who
knows where the bodies are buried.  Does he disclose
his role in the relationships with Carlo Civelli and Phil
Mulacek that have dogged Interoil for years?  If in fact
we learn that Mulacek was actively involved in illegally
promoting Interoil stock, how will that make
shareholders feel about the reserves that are allegedly
in Interoil’s �elds?


This stock has long been a bull vs bear battle that we
enjoyed watching from the sidelines.  While the bears
have won on the informational side, the stock price has
been a stalemate.  Yet we all know that a chain is only
as strong as its weakest link.  The new CEO, who was
previously unemployed is just window dressing on a
bigger story. 


Tommy Belesis and crew are not exactly the type of
chaps that either Richard Chandler or John Pauslon
would have over for tea or polo in the Hamptons.  It will
be interesting to watch this play out over the next
