COMPANY:  Chong Sing Holdings FinTech Group Ltd. │ HKEX: 8207 


INDUSTRY:  Financial Services 
 


We are short Chong Sing shares and think its equity will ultimately be worth zero.  
 
Chong Sing Holdings Fintech Group Limited (HKEX: 8207) (“Chong Sing” or the “Company”), formerly known as Credit China, went public 


in November 2010 as a short-term secured finance provider.  Since being public, Chong Sing has made multiple acquisitions and introduced 


various new business segments, namely: payments, technology-enabled lending, cryptocurrency mining, blockchain, traditional loans and 


financing services. 





We believe that Chong Sing has nefariously been used by its director and largest shareholder, Mr. Zhang Zhenxin (“Mr. Zhang”), to conduct 


sham transactions and artificially inflate Chong Sing’s reported financial performance to attract investments from unsuspecting creditors and 


minority shareholders.  In this report we provide evidence which suggests to us that Chong Sing insiders are consistently spinning assets between 
Mr. Zhang’s cohorts to artificially inflate reported asset valuations and fabricate reported gains from illusory transactions.  Specifically, we 


present evidence that Chong Sing lied about its RMB 408 million gain on disposal in 2017 of Beijing Phoenix, having never been paid 


the cash consideration from the supposed purchaser! 





Additionally, we suspect that Chong Sing management has inappropriately managed its Leyu profitability to maximize its Leyu Put Option 


liability, contrary to interests of Chong Sing minority shareholders. We calculate that Chong Sing shareholders face imminent dilution of 


20% as a result of its Leyu Put Option liability.   


 
Fabricated profits of RMB 408 million in 2017 and imminent 20% dilution are just the tip of the iceberg for Chong Sing.  We cannot find a trace 


of evidence that Glory Metro exists, a supposed RMB 350 million exhibition services business that Chong Sing invested RMB 179 million in 


1H’18.  We are mystified by the RMB 10 billion valuation given to Chong Sing’s Bitfily, a newly launched blockchain hardware business within 


6 months of it being established.  We have uncovered numerous undisclosed related party transactions centered around Chong Sing’s director 


and largest shareholder Mr. Zhang, and Bloomberg intraday trading data suggests Chong Sing is one of the most manipulated stocks on the 


HKEx.   





We have seen this scam before.  Management buys and sells assets between secretly controlled entities to create fake profits and artificially 
inflate asset valuations (referred to as “spinning assets”), encouraging unsuspecting shareholders to buy the stock and creditors to lend against 


fabricated financial statements. Insiders benefit from the scam by saddling the public company with indebtedness and then transfer real assets 


(cash and property) into the hands of cohorts.  As is the case with many manipulated stocks, management often uses margin financing 


arrangements to secure additional cash borrowings using shares as collateral for loans.  We encourage investors to review what happened with 


Hosa International (HKEX: 2200) and Tech Pro (HKEX: 3823), where margin calls resulted in significant investment losses for minority 


shareholders.  


 
Reporting fake profits and fake cash from disposals will obviously violate Chong Sing’s outstanding debt covenants.  We expect Chong Sing’s 


senior creditors to try and collect monies owed while cash is still available. 





As of June 30, 2018, Chong Sing only had RMB 1 billion in tangible current liquid assets (primarily cash) to satisfy RMB 3.7 billion of current 


borrowings and payables due.  Put simply, Chong Sing does not have enough cash to satisfy its short-term liabilities.  Considering its inability 


to generate cash from operations and its existing indebtedness, we are highly skeptical that creditors will collect monies owed in full, leaving 


little, if any, value for minority Chong Sing shareholders.  


 
In our experience, this story does not end well.  We are short Chong Sing shares and think its equity will ultimately be worth zero.

Chong Sing │ HKEX: 8207              www.bonitasresearch.com 
 


1. SHAM TRANSACTION – FABRICATED PROFITS AND CASH CONSIDERATION.   In March 2017, Chong 
Sing purportedly sold its entire equity interest in www.9888.cn to a supposed independent third party, claiming to 


have received a RMB 514 million cash consideration and recorded a gain on disposal of RMB 408 million (26% of 


2017 pretax profits).  However, we believe this was a sham disposal designed to artificially inflate Chong Sing’s 


reported profits and cash consideration.  Independent evidence from Chinese P2P regulator NIFA, SAIC filings 


and HKEx prospectus applications reveal that the purchasing party of Beijing Phoenix never paid Chong Sing 


a RMB 514 million cash consideration!  Additional evidence exists Chong Sing management lied about its disposal 


of Beijing Phoenix and did not generate the amount of gains reported in its public filings. This is but one example 


whereby Chong Sing management engaged in nefarious activity for their own self-interests at the expense of creditors 


and minority shareholders. 





2. 20% DILUTION FROM LEYU PUT OPTION.    On October 31, 2016, Chong Sing announced its purchase of 
48% of Leyu for RMB 800 million.  The purchase agreement included a Put Option (“Leyu Put Option”) which gave 


the remaining 52% shareholders of Leyu the right to sell the rest of Leyu to Chong Sing at a 15x multiple of 2017 or 


2018 earnings, receiving newly issued Chong Sing shares as consideration.  To Chong Sing shareholders, the Leyu 


deal looks to be a terrible one.  2017 was a great year for Leyu, increasing profits by 588% year over year.  As a result, 


the holders of the Leyu Put Option were sitting on a golden ticket, with the value of the Put Option increasing 


an astounding 1360% from RMB 276 million to RMB 4 billion within 15 months!  Timing couldn’t have been 


worse.  Once the Leyu Put Option was created, Leyu’s performance declined significantly, with profitability down 


99% in 1H’18 versus 1H’17. To us, the rapid increase and decline in Leyu’s operating performance and the timing of 


peak profitability to maximize the value of the Leyu Put Option appears to be in the worst interest of minority 


shareholders.  Such a poor managerial decision deserves scrutiny as to whether Chong Sing management was complicit 


in a scheme to enrich insiders or whether they were simply inept. 





3. WHERE ART THOU GLORY METRO?  We cannot find a trace of evidence that Glory Metro Holdings Limited 
(“Glory Metro”) exists, a supposed RMB 350 million exhibition services business Chong Sing acquired a 51% equity 


interest in 1H’18 for a total cash consideration of RMB 179 million.  Firstly, we cannot identify Glory Metro as a 


registered business in either the PRC or Hong Kong.  Secondly, it is unlikely that a RMB 350 million business 


providing exhibition services in the PRC and Hong Kong would not have an online presence. Thirdly, the reported 


intangible to total asset ratio for Glory Metro does not reflect the balance sheets of other PRC exhibition service 


providers.  We find it highly probable that Glory Metro is another sham transaction, possibly used to funnel cash from 


Chong Sing into the hands of Mr. Zhang’s cohorts, or used to offset fabricated profits on Chong Sing’s income 


statement.  Either way, we believe such nefarious activity supports our opinion that Chong Sing is fabricating its 


reported financial performance to generate interest from unsuspecting creditors and shareholders.    





4. MR ZHANG – THE ORCHESTRATOR OF THE SPINNING ASSETS SCAM.   We believe that Mr. Zhang 
Zhenxin is the orchestrator behind Chong Sing’s scam transactions. Mr. Zhang is Chong Sing’s director and largest 


shareholder. Evidence suggests that Chong Sing lied about the independent nature of its counterparties in a series of 


acquisitions and disposals, and that these transactions appear to be with parties related to Mr. Zhang. Management 


buys and sells assets between secretly controlled entities to create fake profits and artificially inflate asset valuations, 


encouraging unsuspecting shareholders to buy the stock and creditors to lend against fabricated financial statements. 


Insiders benefit from the scam by saddling the public company with crippling indebtedness and loot the public 


company via disposals of real assets (cash and property) into the hands of cohorts.  As Mr. Zhang orchestrates the 


buying and selling of these assets, he can also selectively choose which assets he wants to own himself versus what 


should be reflected on Chong Sing’s balance sheet.  In this section we highlight how a Shanghai investment property 


was disposed to an undisclosed related party of Mr. Zhang’s, and how those related parties colluded with Mr. Zhang 


to artificially inflate the value of a newly launched Chong Sing blockchain business, Bitfily.

5. INCREASED RELIANCE ON NEWLY INTRODUCED PAPER PROFITS.   To offset a significant decline in 
the performance of its 2017 primary business segment, Chong Sing’s 1H’18 reported results introduced new one-time 


gains from the sale of hashing power and a non-cash gain from the vaulation markup of a level 3 assets majority owned 


by Mr. Zhang. In 1Q’18, Chong Sing claimed to generate profits of RMB 233 milllion from the “disposal of hashing 


power” yet gave no detail about its new crypto mining business.  Without these profits, Chong Sing would have 


incurred losses of RMB 203 million instead of its reported profits of RMB 29 million. Clearly significant. Yet, even 


after such success in 1Q’18, the following quarter, Chong Sing generated zero gains from the disposal of hashing 


power.  We ask, why would the Company discontinue its most profitable business from Q1 to Q2 2018!?!  In 


2Q’18, NCF Wealth Holdings Limited, formerly known as First p2p (“NCF” or “First P2P”), a level 3 asset majority 


owned by Mr. Zhang, was revalued by Chong Sing resulting in a non-cash gain of RMB 260 million (67% of 1H’18 


profits).  NIFA operating data reveals First P2P’s revenues declined 50% in 2017 and that the platform experienced 


dismal operating performance in 1H’18, making us suspicious of Chong Sing’s management’s misuse of level 3 asset 


revaluation techniques to generate illusory profits for Chong Sing. 





6. STOCK MANIPULATION.  As is the case with many manipulated stocks, management often uses margin financing 
arrangements to secure additional cash borrowings using their shares as collateral for loans.  Proceeds from these loans 


are often used to manipulate and artificially inflate the value of its shares, allowing more funds to be borrowed.  Fake 


buying interest can only maintain the ruse for a finite amount of time, and if the stock price starts to decline, the results 


are disastrous for shareholders. As witnessed with Hosa International (HKEX: 2200) and Tech Pro (HKEX: 3823), 


this creates a highly unstable situation where banks hold highly overvalued stock as collateral.   




















We are short Chong Sing and think its equity will ultimately be worth zero.

SHAM TRANSACTION – FABRICATED PROFITS AND CASH CONSIDERATION 
 





In March 2017, Chong Sing purportedly sold its entire equity interest in www.9888.cn to a supposed independent 


third party, claiming to have received a RMB 514 million cash consideration and recorded a gain on disposal of RMB 


408 million (26% of 2017 pretax profits). 





However, we believe this was a sham disposal to artificially inflate Chong Sing’s reported profits.  





Independent evidence from Chinese P2P regulator NIFA, SAIC filings and HKEx prospectus applications 


reveal that the purchasing party of Beijing Phoenix never paid Chong Sing a RMB 514 million cash 


consideration! 





Additional evidence exists that Beijing Phoenix was not historically as profitable as Chong Sing claimed. 





Such nefarious activity supports our opinion that Chong Sing is is fabricating its reported financial performance to 


generate interest from unsuspecting creditors and shareholders.  Public companies are required to disclose related 


party dealings so that those transactions receive increased scrutiny to confirm that self-dealings are appropriate and 


not being entered into at the expense of minority shareholders.  We believe that the primary orchestrator is Mr. Zhang, 


Chong Sing’s largest shareholder, who stands to benefit from Chong Sing’s inflated share price.   





a. No Cash Paid to Chong Sing from Beijing Phoenix Purchaser 
 


In 1Q2015, Chong Sing completed the acquisition of 100% equity interest in Beijing Phoenix Credit Management 


Corp (“Beijing Phoenix”) for RMB 50 million from a related party.1  Beijing Phoenix’s primary business operated 


under the brand name Financial Workshop, which included www.9888.cn and www.gongchangp2p.com in May 2017.  





 
Source: http://icp.alexa.cn/  





On March 30, 2017, Chong Sing announced the disposal of its 100% interest in www.9888.cn (including Financial 


Workshop) to Decade Elite Global Limited (“Decade Elite”), 2  a claimed independent third party, for a net 


consideration of RMB 514 million, booking a gain on disposal of RMB 408 million in 2017, a whopping 800% return 


on investment within 26 months. 





However, evidence suggests that Chong Sing was never paid RMB 514 million for the disposal of www.9888.cn!  





The P2P business in China is highly regulated.  In its 2016 Annual Report Chong Sing highlighted its involvement in 


a new credit information sharing platform for P2P lending players in China, National Internet Finance Association of 


China (“NIFA”) .

If Chong Sing was telling the truth, we would expect to see the purchaser, Decade Elite, or its parent company, MDGL

To us, the evidence clearly indicates that Decade Elite did not pay RMB 514 million to Chong Sing.  If no cash 


consideration was received by Chong Sing, then Chong Sing inappropriately booked a RMB 408 million gain on 


disposal of Beijing Phoenix. 





However, additional evidence suggests that Beijing Phoenix did not generate the net income reported by Chong Sing 


in either 2015 and 2016.    





b. No Cash Flow of Fees to Chong Sing from www.9888.cn Structured Contracts 
 


In 1Q20153, Chong Sing completed the acquisition of Beijing Phoenix.4  The deal was executed with Structured 


Contracts whereby Beijing Phoenix pays Wanjun Hangzhou, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chong Sing,5 a monthly 


service fee equivalent to 100% of the monthly net income of Beijing Phoenix.

As per the terms of the deal, Beijing Phoenix is to pay Wanjun Hangzhou a monthly service fee equivalent to 100%

To us the evidence clearly shows that Wanjun Hangzhou never received any monthly fees from Beijing Phoenix in 


either 2015 or 2016, which it should have received as per the terms of the Structured Contract if Beijing Phoenix was 


generating any profits.   





We believe this evidence further supports our opinion that the claimed disposal of www.9888.cn was a sham 


transaction.  





c. Beijing Phoenix was Never Disposed  
 


Additional NIFA disclosures and SAIC filings suggest that Beijing Phoenix was never actually disposed of by Chong 


Sing. Evidence suggests that related parties to Chong Sing are still involved in the Financial Workshop platform.

products advertized on www.9888keji.com they are redirected to http://www.gongchangp2p.cn/!   





NIFA discloses that on January 23, 2015, Chong Sing’s previous senior manager, Ms. Wei Wei (“Ms. Wei”), was 


listed as the registered shareholder for gongchangP2P.com. This corroborates the January 2015 disclosed timing of 


Chong Sing’s acquisition of Beijing Phoenix and suggests that Ms. Wei was Chong Sing’s nominee shareholder of 


Beijing Phoenix in the Structured Contract.

Chong Sing discloses that Ms. Wei has extensive historical overlap with Mr. Zhang’s UCF entites. 





 
Source: 2016 Annual Report- p. 53 





Surprisingly, SAIC filings show there was no change to Beijing Phoenix’s listed nominee shareholder since March 


2017, when Chong Sing supposedly disposed of the asset.  Ms. Wei is currently the sole registered shareholder, 


executive director and general manager of Beijing Phoenix.

What kind of an independent party would purchase a business for RMB500 million+ without changing its registered 


shareholder or designating its own shareholder? The fact that there has been no shareholder changes supports our 


opinion that Beijing Phoenix was never actually disposed of by Chong Sing insiders. 





More importantly, as Decade Elite Global Limited is a BVI company, it needs to operate P2P business through a set 


of structured contracts just like Chong Sing did.  As a part of customary structure contracts, the nominee shareholder 


of the operating entity, in our case, Beijing Phoenix, needs to pledge his or her shares in the operating entity to a 


wholly foreign owned entity (WFOE) established by the ultimate foreign shareholder.  In an arm’s length transaction, 


this share pledge will be registered with the SAIC.  However, the current SAIC filings of Beijing Phoenix indicate 


that the prior share pledge by Ms. Wei to Chong Sing’s WFOE was lapsed and there is no outstanding share pledge, 


which means Decade Elite Global Limited has not acquired control of Beijing Phoenix. 





The gongchangP2P.com’s website confirms the current senior management overlaps with previous management of 


Mr. Zhang’s UCF entities.

SAIC filings reveal that Beijing Douge is wholly owned by Shenzhen Elephant Internet Development Co., Ltd. 


(“Shenzhen Elephant”).  Shenzhen Elephant is an undisclosed related party of Chong Sing’s via Zhao Miaomiao and 


Mr. Kang. 





In September 2017, Shenzhen Elephant was sold to Beijing Jiahe Yongli Investment Management Co., Ltd. (北京佳


禾永利投资管理有限公司), which is owned by Zhao Miaomiao (赵苗苗) and Zhang Ruiling (张瑞玲).8 
 


SAIC filings reveal that the chairman and executive director of Shenzhen Elephant is Mr. Kang Zhongqin (“Mr. 


Kang”), who is the legal representative of Hainan UCF Wangxin Micro-loan Co., Ltd, an associate of Chong Sing.  


Mr. Kang was also the legal representative and executive director of Beijing Phoenix from May 2016 to November

Chong Sing’s auditor10 could have easily been fooled by the reported cash contribution received from the disposal of 


Beijing Phoenix.  The Purchaser revealed that it only invested RMB 1.6 million (HK$ 1.8 million) in 2017, 99% less 


than what Chong Sing reported to receive in cash consideration from the sale of Beijing Phoenix.   





To us, these fake cash considerations could have easily been offset by two unexpected, newly introduced line items 


on Chong Sing’s cash flow statement.  While no accompanying detailed notes are given for outbound cash flows 


of RMB 827 million that suddenly appeared in 2017, it is entirely possible that insiders worked with related 


parties to either round trip or offset the fabricated cash considerations from its sham Beijing Phoenix 


transaction. 





                                                             
10 Investors are wise to be skeptical of Chong Sing’s auditor, Shinewing HK, of effectively doing its job to accurately identify 


accounting issues and irregularities in Chong Sing’s reported financial performance.  In December 2017, Shinewing received the 


largest fine ever for a failed audit of a Chinese listed company.

We think the evidence is clear.  Chong Sing management lied about its disposal of Beijing Phoenix and did not 


generate the amount of gains reported in its public filings.   





As evidenced throughout this report, we believe that Chong Sing management engaged in nefarious activity for their 


own self-interests at the expense of creditors and minority shareholders.

20% DILUTION FROM LEYU PUT OPTION 
 





We calculate that Chong Sing shareholders face imminent dilution of 20% as a result of its Leyu Put Option 


liability. 





On October 31, 2016, Chong Sing announced its purchase of 48% of Leyu for RMB 800 million.  The purchase 


agreement included a Put Option (“Leyu Put Option”) which gave the remaining 52% shareholders of Leyu the right 


to sell the rest of Leyu to Chong Sing at a 15x multiple of 2017 or 2018 earnings, receiving newly issued Chong Sing 


shares as consideration.   





To Chong Sing shareholders, the Leyu deal looks to be a terrible one.  2017 was a great year for Leyu, increasing 


profits by 588% year over year.  As a result, the holders of the Leyu Put Option were sitting on a golden ticket, 


with the value of the Put Option increasing an astounding 1360% from RMB 276 million to RMB 4 billion 


within 15 months!11  





We calculate that Chong Sing shareholders face imminent dilution of 20% as a result of its Leyu Put Option 


liability.   





Timing couldn’t have been worse.  Once the Leyu Put Option was created, Leyu’s performance declined significantly, 


with profitability down 99% in 1H’18 versus 1H’17.  Such a poor managerial decision deserves scrutiny as to whether 


Chong Sing management was complicit in a scheme to enrich insiders or whether they were simply inept.   





At the time of the acquisition, China Binary (HK: 8255) was one of Leyu’s primary shareholders. China Binary 


deemed the Leyu transaction as a major transaction, and on November 25, 2016 China Binary released a Circular that 


disclosed additional details of the Leyu Put Option.   





One immediate omission from Chong Sing’s announcement was that the Leyu Put Option would be renegotiated and 


lowered to a level to allow the size of the transaction to be deemend under the limit threshold for a “major transaction” 


for Chong Sing. To us, this is clearly an act to avoid disclosure and shareholder approval.

As a result, the holders of the Leyu Put Option were sitting on a golden ticket, with the value of the Leyu Put 


Option increasing an astounding 1360% from RMB 276 million to RMB 4 billion within 15 months!12  





This liability is to be settled with newly issued Chong Sing shares which would result in an immediate 20% dilution 


to current shareholders. 





 
* Average closing price of the shares of Chong Sing as quoted on the Stock Exchange for the five business days 


immediately prior to the date of the Put Notice 


** Assume Put Notice Date is Friday, June 29th. 





Chong Sing disclosed that Leyu generated RMB 313 million in 1H’17 results, well in excess of the RMB 120 


minimum for the Put Option to be exercised.  Leyu Put Option holders were pleasantly notified that Leyu’s 2017 


profits accounteed for RMB 517 million.  We believe that all rational Leyu Put Option holders would have cashed in 


on a RMB 4 billion payday by giving the Put Notice to Chong Sing immediately upon receipt of Leyu’s 2017 audited 


financials on March 28, 2018.   





1Q’18 results came out on May 8, 2018 revealing that Leyu reversed its operating performance and was not profitable 


in 1Q’18, well within the three months Leyu Put Option holders had to notify Chong Sing of their interest in exercising 


the Put Option.   





Knowing 1Q2018’s poor results, there is no doubt in our mind that all rational Leyu Put Option Holders would have 


taken the high profit mark of Leyu’s 2017 annual profits and exercised the Put Option, knowing that if 2018 profits 


did not exceed RMB 120 million, the RMB 4 billion Put Option would expire worthless.  Not a risk we expect any 


rational person to take.

To us, the rapid increase and decline in Leyu’s operating performance and the timing of peak profitability to maximize 


the value of the Leyu Put Option appears to be in the worst interest of minority shareholders.  We urge regulators to 


investigate the beneficiaries of the Leyu Put Option to determine whether any of the holders are related parties to Mr. 


Zhang or other Chong Sing insiders.  We are skeptical of the coincidence that Leyu’s profitability peaked in 2017 


which created a RMB 4 billion liability, only to have performance immediately decline post Leyu Put Option 


calculation period. 





Chong Sing has 50 business days13 from the receipt of the Put Notice to issue new shares.  Assuming Leyu’s 2017 


audited financials were released coinciding with Chong Sing’s 2017 Annual Report on March 28, 2018, and the Put 


Notice was given to Chong Sing within three months (Thursday, June 28, 2018), Chong Sing should have issued new 


shares the first week of September 2018, at the latest.   





The Company has not commented.  We expect an immediate 20% dilution from this event.

Chong Sing discloses Glory Metro’s full name as Glory Metro Holdings Limited (盛都控股有限公司). A review of 


the Chinese SAIC filing website and Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals no such company named “盛都控股有


限公司” or “Glory Metro Holdings Limited”.  This means that there are no companies in the PRC SAIC or Hong 
Kong CR registered with the name Glory Metro. 





We also searched the SAIC Trademark Office for Glory Metro.14  Nothing came up.  We conducted the same search 


for 19 PRC exhibition service providers listed on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ).  We 


were able to find registered trademarks for 13 of them, 12 with trademark(s) registered under category 41 which 


includes business scopes of “culture and entertainment” and “conference services”.  For the six that do not have a 


registered trademark under their names, we can easily identify online their offcial websites or job postings offering 


employment. 





A keyword search for the Chinese keyword “盛都” produced 61 registered trademarks, none of which listed 


“exhibition” under its scope. One trademark under the name “盛都大典” listed services like “arrangement for 
conferences”,“entertainment program” and “provision of entertainment places”, but the registrant was an individual 


and we could not find any internet footprint of the business.

to see if there was any internet footprint or contact information for a RMB 350 million exhibition services business.

Thirdly, Glory Metro does not maintain a balance sheet similar to other PRC exhibition service participants.  We find 


it very unlikely that a exhibition services company worth RMB 350 million would have only RMB 43,000 in plant 


and equipment. Part of the value-add for exhibition companies is that they can produce local branded items quickly 


and efficiently because there is an inventory of paper, board, and exhibit setups available for use last minute. 





Chong Sing  reported that Glory Metro had intangible assets of RMB 193 million at the time of the acquisition, 


representing 98% of its total assets identified (“intangible to total asset ratio”). This is not the balance sheet of a typical 


exhibition business. We reviewed the balance sheet for 19 exhibition service providers listed on China’s National 


Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ).  The table below discloses the intangible to total asset ratio for each of 


the 19 PRC exhibition service providers.  The median ratio was 0.14%, a stark contrast to the 98% intangible to total 


asset ratio of Glory Metro.   





 
Source: Company Filings 


List:  http://money.163.com/17/1109/15/D2QDMIF0002580S6.html  





To recap, we cannot identify Glory Metro as a registered business in either the PRC or Hong Kong.  Secondly, it is 


unlikely that a RMB 350 million business providing exhibition services in the PRC and Hong Kong would not have 


an online presence. Thirdly, the reported intangible to total asset ratio for Glory Metro does not reflect the balance 


sheets of other PRC exhibition service providers.   





It is possible that Glory Metro is the name of an offshore holding company in the BVIs that operates using a different 


trade name.  If that is true, why didn’t Chong Sing disclose to investors Glory Metro’s trade name?  Or the name of 


the operating entity in either China or Hong Kong?   





We find it highly probable that Glory Metro is another sham transaction, possibly used to funnel cash from Chong 


Sing into the hands of Mr. Zhang’s cohorts, or used to offset fabricated profits on Chong Sing’s income statement.  


Either way, we believe such nefarious activity supports our opinion that Chong Sing is fabricating its reported financial 


performance to generate interest from unsuspecting creditors and shareholders.

Chong Sing │ HKEX: 8207              www.bonitasresearch.com 
 


MR ZHANG – THE ORCHESTRATOR OF THE SPINNING ASSETS SCAM 
 





We believe that Mr. Zhang Zhenxin is the orchestrator behind Chong Sing’s scam transactions.  





On October 9, 2013, Chong Sing acquired control over Dalian UCF Business Services Co., Limited from Mr. Zhang 


for a total consideration of RMB 225 million (HK$287 million15) satisfied by issuing 477 million shares at a 11.77% 


discount to market.  This allowed Mr. Zhang to inject his private business into a public company while avoiding new 


listing qualification requirements and scrutiny from regulators.  





Mr. Zhang is Chong Sing’s director and largest shareholder while maintaining his position as Chairman at UCF 


Holdings Group Limited (formerly known as “China UCF Group Co. Limited”) (“UCF Holdings”). 





 
Source: 2017 Annual Report – p. 44 





Evidence suggests that Chong Sing lied about the independent nature of its counterparties in a series of acquisitions 


and disposals, and that these transactions appear to be with parties related to Mr. Zhang.  





Management buys and sells assets between secretly controlled entities to create fake profits and artificially inflate 


asset valuations (referred to as “spinning assets”), encouraging unsuspecting investors to buy the stock and creditors 


to lend against fabricated financial statements. Insiders benefit from the scam by saddling the public company with 


crippling indebtedness and loot the public company via disposals of real assets (cash and property) into the hands of 


cohorts.  As Mr. Zhang orchestrates the buying and selling of these assets, he can also selectively choose which assets 


he wants to own himself versus what should be reflected on Chong Sing’s balance sheet. 





Earlier in this report we highlighted the sham disposal of Beijing Phoenix.  In this section we highlight how a Shanghai 


investment property was disposed to an undisclosed related party of Mr. Zhang, and how those related parties colluded 


with Mr. Zhang to artificially inflate the value of a newly launched Chong Sing blockchain business, Bitfily.

To us, these are clear connections. 





In addition, HongDa PRC was previously owned by Mr. Zhang through his private business, UCF Venture Co., Ltd. 


(先锋创业有限公司) (“UCF Venture”), before Shenzhen UCF Investment Co., Ltd. (深圳先锋投资有限公司) 
(“Shenzhen UCF”) 16  acquired HongDa PRC in October 2014.  Shenzhen UCF transferred HongDa PRC to a 


subsidiary of HongDa Financial Holding Limited (HKEX: 1822) (“HongDa Financial”) just a few months before 


Chong Sing disposed of Shanghai Shenlong. 17  





Secondly, Zhao Miaomiao, a person connected to Mr. Zhang and his private business in various ways, is an indirect 


shareholder of Jiaxing Mingfeng via her investment in Beijing Jiahe Zhengsheng Investment Management Co., Ltd  


(北京佳禾正声投资管理有限公司) (“Jiahe Zhengsheng”).18 





Thirdly, Shanghai Shenlong’s current (post-disposal) legal representative is Yu Haifen, a former employee of Mr. 


Zhang’s private business.19   





The disposal of Shanghai Shenlong is an example of a dubious undisclosed related party transaction whereby real 


assets are being sold to entities under the control of Mr. Zhang and his cohorts.  We question both the authenticity of 


Chong Sing’s reported gains on disposals and the motivation of Chong Sing management to sell tangible assets to 


undisclosed related parties of Mr. Zhang.  





To us, it appears that Chong Sing is acting in the best interest of insiders to loot the public company of tangible assets, 


leaving minority shareholders invested in intangible assets with questionable valuations.

b. Shenzhen Bitfily 
 


Since late 2016, Chong Sing has talked publicly about its intention to enter the blockchain/cryptocurrency/datacenter 


business.  In its 2017 Annual Report, Chong Sing disclosed that it “launched” a hardware manufacturing business 


with two products under the brand name “Bitfily”.

Desktop research using the keyword “Bitfily” easily identified the two20 hardware offerings which listed the website’s 


owner as Shenzhen Bitfily.21

On April 25, 2018, HongDa Financial (HKEX: 1822) announced an investment of RMB 50 million for a 0.5% equity 


interest in in Bravo Star Asia Limited (“Bravo Star Asia”), the indirect holding company of Shenzhen Bitfily.   





How did Shenzhen Bitfily go from a start-up selling two computer mining hardware products established in 


November 2017 to being worth RMB 10 billion within 6 months?  And if Chong Sing’s newly launched business 


line was truly this successful, why would Chong Sing not include Bitfily’s valuation in its public filings?  





We suspect that the investment from HongDa Financial was to support an extremely lofty valuation of Chong Sing’s 


newly established blockchain business, Bitfily, and that Bravo Star Asia’s newly minted RMB 10 billion valuation 


was used to secure additional financing arrangements.  





We believe we are reviewing the correct entities and that Chong Sing omitted a material subsidiary from its 


consolidated financial statements.  HongDa Financial’s announcement clearly states that Bravo Star Asia’s only 


investment is Bravo View, and that Bravo View’s sole wholly-owned subsidiary is Shenzhen Bitfily.

Considering the ownership language from Chong Sing’s 2017 Annual Report, the language from HongDa Financial’s 


investment in Bravo Star Asia and that Chong Sing’s CEO is a director of Bravo View and a signatory for Bravo Star 


Asia in Hong Kong CR filings, we suspect that Chong Sing is the ultimate beneficial owner of Shenzhen Bitfily.   





Since Bravo Star Asia is a BVI entity, we are unable to determine whether Bravo Star Asia used its lofty RMB 10 


billion valuation to secure additional borrowings.  However, if any liabilities exist at Bravo Star Asia or its subsidiaries, 


it would make sense to us why Chong Sing would want to omit the inclusion of its supposed RMB 10 billion valued 


subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements. 





Ultimately, we suspect that Chong Sing colluded with HongDa Financial to artificially inflate the value of Bravo Star 


Asia so that Chong Sing would be able to secure additional borrowings, and that Chong Sing purposely omitted Bravo 


Star Asia from its consolidated financial performance to avoid reporting increased liabilities.

INCREASED RELIANCE ON NEWLY INTRODUCED PAPER PROFITS   
 





To offset a significant decline in the performance of its 2017 primary business segment, Chong Sing’s 1H’18 reported 


results introduced new one-time gains from the sale of hashing power and a non-cash gain from the vaulation markup 


of a level 3 assets majority owned by Mr. Zhang.  





In 1Q’18, Chong Sing claimed to generate profits of RMB 233 milllion from the “disposal of hashing power” yet gave 


no detail about its new crypto mining business.  Without these profits, Chong Sing would have incurred losses of 


RMB 203 million instead of its reported profits of RMB 29 million. Clearly significant. Yet, even after such success 


in 1Q’18, the following quarter, Chong Sing generated zero gains from the disposal of hashing power.  We ask, why 


would the Company discontinue its most profitable business from Q1 to Q2 2018!?! 





In 2Q’18, NCF Wealth Holdings Limited, formerly known as First p2p (“NCF” or “First P2P”), a level 3 asset majority 


owned by Mr. Zhang, was revalued by Chong Sing resulting in a non-cash gain of RMB 260 million (67% of 2Q’18 


profits).  NIFA operating data reveals First P2P’s revenues declined 50% in 2017 and that the platform experienced 


dismal operating performance in 1H’18, making us suspicious of Chong Sing’s management’s misuse of level 3 asset 


revaluation techniques to generate illusory profits for Chong Sing. 





a. Blockchain 
 


In 4Q’17, Chong Sing entered the blockchain business by acquiring a datacenter from a third party, mining for 


cryptocurrency, and booking the value of its mined coins as blockchain services revenues.  By 1Q’18, cryptocurrency 


mining was 48% of revenues and accounted for over 100% of Chong Sing’s segment profits! 





 
Source: 1Q2018 Quarterly Report22 - p. 11 





Due to the price decline of cryptocurrencies in 1Q’18, the company recorded a loss from the changes in fair value of 


cryptocurrencies of RMB 122.7 million, wiping out 42% of its blockchain revenues generated in the quarter. 





To offset the decline in cryptocurrency prices in 1Q’18, Chong Sing purportedly generated profits of RMB 233 


milllion from the “disposal of hashing power”.  Oddly, hashing power sales was not reported as an above the line 


business segment rather a below the line adjustment to expenses.  While the Company gives limited disclosure of the 


economics of its hashing power business, we understand the sale of hashing power to generate revenus from the sub-


leasing of computer mining equipment to operators interested in mining for coins using a third party’s computer 


processing power.

would the Company discontinue its most profitable business from Q1 to Q2 2018!?! 





b. 855% Returns in 3 years from NCF 
 


In 2Q’18, NCF Wealth Holdings Limited, formerly known as First p2p (“NCF” or “First P2P”), a level 3 asset 51.5% 


owned by Mr. Zhang, 23 was revalued by Chong Sing resulting in a non-cash gain of RMB 260 million (67% of 2Q’18 


profits).   





On January 12, 2015 Chong Sing acquired a 10% equity interest in First P2P for RMB 50 million, valuing First P2P 


at RMB 500 million.   





No valuation gains for First P2P were recognized by Chong Sing in its 2015, 2016 or 2017 Annual Reports. And again 


in 1Q’18 the Company did not report gains from its investment in NCF. 





Then, all of a sudden, in its 1H2018 Interim Report, Chong Sing records a non-cash gain of RMB 260 million and 


reports that its investment in NCF is now worth RMB 621 million, a whopping return of 855% in three years! 





This would make NCF one of the best investments on the planet. 





 
Source: 1H2018 Interim Results – p. 45 





Using Chong Sing’s reported valuation for its 8.81% equity stake in First P2P worth RMB 621 million, Chong 


Sing is valuing First P2P at RMB 7 billion.  Does NCF deserve a RMB 7 billion valuation?  We think not.

aggregate number of added borrowers declined by 91%.

NIFA data includes First P2P’s financial performance from 2015 to 2017.  Since 2015, First P2P has had a significant 


negative total equity balance.  While profits increased from 2016 to 2017, revenues were down 50% year over year.   





 
Source: NIFA Website 





Is First P2P worth RMB 7 billion after revenues declined 50% in 2017 and the dismal operating performance in 1H’18? 


We think not. 





Rather we suspect this is another example of Chong Sing management’s misuse of level 3 asset revaluation techniques 


to generate illusory profits for Chong Sing.

STOCK MANIPULATION 
 


As is the case with many manipulated stocks, management often uses margin financing arrangements to secure 


additional cash borrowings using their shares as collateral for loans.  Proceeds from these loans are often used to 


manipulate and artificially inflate the value of its shares, allowing more funds to be borrowed.  Fake buying interest 


can only maintain the ruse for a finite amount of time, and if the stock price starts to decline, the results are disastrous 


for shareholders. 





Evidence of manipulation can be found in intraday trading patterns, particularly the appreciation of a company’s stock 


in the last hour of trading. Gains throughout the trading day, over time, should be uniform, so we compared the returns 


generated from two different trading strategies to see if there were any anomalies between the returns of a buy-and-


hold strategy versus a last-hour trading strategy.  





First, we calculated the returns if an investor simply purchased the shares on day 1 of the period and sold them at the 


end of the period. We refer to this as the buy-and-hold strategy. With the last-hour trading strategy, we modeled the 


compounded returns if, each day, an investor bought the subject stock at 3:00 pm (Hong Kong time), sold the stock 


an hour later at the close of the market, and then reinvested the proceeds in the same manner the following day. 





As is evident in the table below, for Hong Kong’s top traded stocks on August 24, 2018, there is a small median 


difference in an investor’s returns between a buy-and-hold strategy versus a last-hour trading strategy.  This is what 


we would expect for non-manipulated stocks. A partial investment period equates to partial return (or loss) 


participation.  





In the period from February 12, 2018 through August 24, 2018, the median return for an investor who bought and held 


Hong Kong’s most actively traded stocks was a loss of 9%.  A last-hour trading strategy for those same stocks would 


have generated a median return of 1%. 





If an investor bought and held Chong Sing’s stock from February 12, 2018 through August 24, 2018, it would have 


generated a loss of 45%.  But if an investor bought Chong Sing’s stock at the beginning of the last trading hour and 


sold at the close of the trading day (and reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Chong Sing’s stock 


would have returned an inexplicable 42% over that same period, a return difference of 87%!

This staggering difference is highly unusual when compared to other Hong Kong stocks, and in our opinion, strong 


evidence of manipulation. 





Ultimately time will reveal the specific purpose why Chong Sing’s stock was being manipulated.  For now, we suspect 


that management purposely executed the last hour manipulation to prop up Chong Sing’s daily closing price to secure 


additional short-term financing and possibly avoid margin calls on previously pledged shares. As witnessed with Hosa 


International (HKEX: 2200) and Tech Pro (HKEX: 3823), this creates a highly unstable situation where banks hold 


highly overvalued stock as collateral.  If share prices fall, banks may be forced to sell the shares held as collateral to 


secure outstanding loans. This will cause the share prices to fall further, prompting banks to sell more.

VALUATION 
 





We are short Chong Sing shares and think its equity will ultimately be worth zero.  
 


We believe that Chong Sing has nefariously been used by its director and largest shareholder, Mr. Zhang, to conduct 


sham transactions and artificially inflate Chong Sing’s reported financial performance to attract investments from 


unsuspecting creditors and minority shareholders.  In this report we provide evidence which suggests to us that Chong 


Sing insiders are consistently spinning assets between Mr. Zhang’s cohorts to artificially inflate reported asset 


valuations and fabricate reported gains from illusory transactions.  Specifically, we present evidence that Chong 


Sing lied about its RMB 408 million gain on disposal in 2017 of Beijing Phoenix, having never been paid the 


cash consideration from the supposed purchaser! 





Additionally, we suspect that Chong Sing management has inappropriately managed its Leyu profitability to maximize 


its Leyu Put Option liability, contrary to interests of Chong Sing minority shareholders. We calculate that Chong 


Sing shareholders face imminent dilution of 20% as a result of its Leyu Put Option liability.   





Fabricated profits of RMB 408 million in 2017 and imminent 20% dilution are just the tip of the iceberg for Chong 


Sing.  We cannot find a trace of evidence that Glory Metro exists, a supposed RMB 350 million exhibition services 


business that Chong Sing invested RMB 179 million in 1H’18.  We are mystified by the RMB 10 billion valuation 


given to Chong Sing’s Bitfily, a newly launched blockchain hardware business within 6 months of it being established.  


We have uncovered numerous undisclosed related party transactions centered around Chong Sing’s director and 


largest shareholder Mr. Zhang, and Bloomberg intraday trading data suggests Chong Sing is one of the most 


manipulated stocks on the HKEx.   





We have seen this scam before.  Management buys and sells assets between secretly controlled entities to create fake 


profits and artificially inflate asset valuations (referred to as “spinning assets”), encouraging unsuspecting 


shareholders to buy the stock and creditors to lend against fabricated financial statements. Insiders benefit from the 


scam by saddling the public company with indebtedness and then transfer real assets (cash and property) into the 


hands of cohorts.  As is the case with many manipulated stocks, management often uses margin financing 


arrangements to secure additional cash borrowings using shares as collateral for loans.  We encourage investors to 


review what happened with Hosa International (HKEX: 2200) and Tech Pro (HKEX: 3823), where margin calls 


resulted in significant investment losses for minority shareholders.  





Reporting fake profits and fake cash from disposals will obviously violate Chong Sing’s outstanding debt covenants.  


We expect Chong Sing’s senior creditors to try and collect monies owed while cash is still available.  





As of June 30, 2018, Chong Sing only had RMB 1 billion in tangible current liquid assets (primarily cash) to satisfy 


RMB 3.7 billionn of current borrowings and payables due.  Put simply, Chong Sing does not have enough cash to 


satisfy its short-term liabilities.  Considering its inability to generate cash from operations and its existing 


indebtedness, we are highly skeptical that creditors will collect monies owed in full, leaving little, if any, value for 


minority Chong Sing shareholders.  





In our experience, this story does not end well.  We are short Chong Sing shares and think its equity will ultimately 


be worth zero.

subsidiary of Hong Kong listed HongDa Financial Holding Limited (HK: 1822) (“HongDa Financial”)27 just a few 


months before the disposal of Shanghai Shenlong by Chong Sing. 


The below screenshot from HongDa PRC’s SAIC filings disclose these shareholder changes.

Shenzhen UCF’s SAIC filing lists UCF Venture as its previous shareholder: 





Source: SAIC filing 


Below is a screenshot of UCF Venture’s SAIC filings which reveal Mr. Zhang as its 99% shareholder. 





Source: SAIC filing 


The current shareholder of HongDa PRC, Hongshen Taigu Trade (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd. (“Hongshen Taigu”),  is an 


indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HongDa Financial (HK: 1822). On January 20, 20171, Chong Sing and HongDa 


Financial entered a joint investment to purchase 37% of Ping An Securities (HKEX: 231).  


First, Hongshen Taigu is a subsidiary of Hongshen Information Technology Consulting (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd. (弘深信


息咨询（珠海）有限公司) （”Hongshen IT”）. Although Hongshen IT is not listed as a principal subsidiary of 


HongDa Financial (HKEX: 1822) in its filings, its subsidiary, Hongshen Xi Wang Technology (Zhuhai) Company 


Limited (洪深希望科技（珠海）有限公司) was listed as a wholly-owned principal subsidiary of HongDa Financial 


in its 2017 annual report. Therefore we can easily infer that Hongshen IT is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HongDa 


Fianancial, and so is its wholly-owned subsidiary HongDa PRC.
