Is Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (NYSE:IIPR) 


the WeWork of Cannabis? We think it’s Worse! 
 


● IIPR is a publicly traded REIT focused on cannabis, and we are highly skeptical of 


the company and its management.  


● We visited in person dozens of properties, interviewed neighbors, the county 


clerks, and reviewed related leases. Our findings are shocking: We believe IIPR has 


accumulated a highly toxic portfolio of low-quality assets.  


● In our opinion IIPR either fails to do basic due diligence on its counterparts or is 


defrauding investors. 


● Multiple key lessees are already insolvent or at a high risk of insolvency.  


● Even worse, we suspect IIPR of arranging sham transactions to keep its biggest 


tenant solvent in the short term. We think this scheme has reached its breaking 


point since IIPR is drowning in unfunded commitments and its tenant ran out of 


properties to transact with IIPR. 


● We have identified a pattern of massive overpayment to inflate the book value of 


the portfolio, bordering in our opinion on fraud. Our on the ground due diligence 


corroborates that property improvements can’t possibly justify the incredible 


markups IIPR paid.  


● We estimate that about 38% to 49% of the company’s 2020 rental income is in 


direct jeopardy or already lost.   


● Our cash flow analysis shows that IIPR has many characteristics of a pyramid 


scheme. We believe the ever-increasing dividend would have to be financed from 


capital raises or reduced substantially. 


● IIPR shares many similarities with WeWork which too recently fell off: A real estate 


company with a flawed business model led by a young charismatic leader. Both 


companies are heavily dependent on outside financing. IIPR Executive Chairman 


Alan Gold is now pursuing new ventures, similar to WeWork’s Neumann. 


● Our independent analysis concludes that IIPR’s value per share is even under 


optimistic assumptions no more than $22.29.

1 PharmaCann – Scott Township PA  
$3M in annual rent for an empty Property 


IIPR 
purchased 


this property 
from 


PharmaCann 
for $942,000 
and offered 
TI up to 


$29.1M. 
PharmaCann 


is paying over 
$3M in rent 
per year 


starting August 2019. The project was scheduled to finish in November 
2019. IIPR indicated that $2.3M already went into the development of 
the property. We visited the property in March 2020 and found fallow 
land with signs of earliest stages of production, no building, nothing. Can 
shareholders really expect to receive $3 in rent on this property from its 
struggling tenant?  





2 Holistic Industries – Monson MA 
14x inflation in 1 year when IIPR bought it  





On 07/12/18, IIPR 
purchased the 
property from 
Holistic for 
$12.75M. The 
lease requires an 
initial annual rent 
of $1.9M. 
However, the 
property was 


previously 
purchsaed for 
$825,000 on 
05/23/18. In 
addition, Holistic 
previously rented 


the property for only $225,000. We fail to understand why Holistic would 
rather pay 10x on rent and believe an overpayment of property + inflated 
rent look more like a financing transaction. Is IIPR really just a bank for 
law-quality cannabis operators? 


3 Ascend Wellness – Lansing MI 
IIPR paid 5x what the seller paid just 4 days prior   


On 07/09/2019, IIPR 
purchased the property for 
$4.8M and offered TI of up 
to $15M. Yet, records show 
that the property was 
purchased just days before 
for merely $930,000. The 
price had been inflated by 
5X in 4 days! In addition, we 
believe that as of Jan 2020, 
the buiding was still an 


emtpy warehouse with no sign of production. As of March 2020, we 
believe construction had just begun. We estimate Ascend Wellness has 
to pay over $723,000 in base rent per year but this property seems far 
away from being able to generate any kind of revenue.   


4 PharmaCann – Dwight IL 
10x inflation in 1 year with no visible Improvements 





On 10/30/19, IIPR 
purchased the 
property for $18M 
with up to $7M in 
TI. However, the 
property was 
previously sold for 
$1.75M on 
08/16/18. We 
were unable to 
identify visible 


changes to the property happening between 2015 and 2017. We visited 
the property in March 2020 and found minimal improvements made to 
the property compared to historical photos from 2017 and 2018. 
Therefore, we find it difficult to justify the 10x price increase in merely 
one year. We estimate that PharmaCann pays $3.7M annually in rent for 
this property, but PharmaCann seems to be on the brink of insolvency. 


5 Emerald Growth Partners – Harrison Township MI 
Over 300% property appreciation in a day 


On 06/21/19, IIPR 
purchased the property 
for $6.9M, with up to 
$3.1M in TI.  


However, deed records 
show that the property 
price jumped from $2M to 


$6.9M in just one day. In addition, when we visited the facility, it appears 
that it was still under construction. EMG is estimated to pay close to 
$1.5M in annual rent before considering TI.


5 IIPR Deals You 


Should Know about
1 Introduction 
 


Innovative Industrial Properties Inc (NYSE:IIPR) went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November 


2016. The newly formed company was able to raise a little over $60 million in its initial public offering by 


selling 8.75 million common shares to the public, despite having no prior  operations. Cannabis stocks 


were hot in 2016 and the promise of a publicly traded REIT that specializes in the high yield emerging 


cannabis sector seemed appealing.  


IIPR went on to conduct multiple capital raises on the back of a rising stock price. Ladenburg Thalman & 


Co, Inc  and BTIG LLC conducted the offerings of the company.  








On the surface IIPR has been performing well, seeing its stock skyrocket. Even after the recent decline in 


stock price the company still sports a market cap and Enterprise Value in excess of $1.1B and $1.24B. The 


rising stock price has caused something of an arbitrage opportunity for IIPR as the company’s current 


dividend implies a cost of equity capital of about 5%. At the same time IIPR is targeting average yields of 


around 14% for its real estate investments. However, we believe this arbitrage is firstly unsustainable and 


secondly about to fall apart, because our findings imply that IIPR will in fact have to finance the 2020 


dividend from capital raises or reduce the dividend substantially.  


It is also noticeable that the company has been conducting the latest raises at substantial discounts.
IIPR’s business model is straight forward.  The company focused on the acquisition, ownership and 


management of specialized industrial properties leased to operators for the regulated medical-use 


cannabis industry. Most of these facilities are related to the cultivation or processing of marijuana.  


Since the company went public it has been busy raising money and putting it in the ground through a 


range of deals and commitments for future improvement. As of December 2019, the company sported 


747million in asset which consists of real estate investments and some working capital. In total the 


company has signed 56 leases (double check) with 19 key tenants to date. We have identified key 


problems with a majority of the company’s leases.  


In this report we examine systematically the issues the company faces, and our conclusion is devastating. 


At the current rate the company will have to pay $86M in dividends throughout 2020, which is supposed 


to be financed by rental income. Our analysis concludes that up to 50% of the rental income has either 


already vanished or is in high jeopardy. This combined with future commitments IIPR still has to fulfill, we 


believe the company will face insolvency in the near term.   


You can find a comprehensive list of our analysis of each individual lease, including sales history, and our 


on-the-ground due diligence in the Appendix, which is uploaded in a separate document on our website.
2 Insolvent Tenants 
 


IIPR has a number of tenants who are effectively insolvent or are in a dire financial situation.  


Despite some decent transactions with multi-state operators, IIPR’s portfolio is still heavily skewed 


towards smaller lower quality tenants.  Below is a list of IIPR’s tenants that we were able to identify and 


how much they are budgeted to contribute to 2020 rental income. It is noteworthy that IIPR has a very 


concentrated portfolio with the top four tenants contributing over 54% of rental income for 2019. 


PharmaCann and Vireo are especially important as the largest and second largest tenant for 2020. We are 


deeply concerned about the solvency of both of those tenants. While recurring transaction with weaker 


credit tenants have helped boost portfolio scale and rent income, they have deteriorated the portfolio 


quality.

The performance of IIPR’s publicly listed tenants is truly terrible. Below is a list of companies that have 


seen their stock prices plummet since signing their first lease with IIPR as of April 2nd 2020.  





This is especially devastating since these publicly traded key tenants are all money losing, and as cannabis 


companies they don’t have access to traditional bank financing. These companies are heavily dependent 


on equity raises, and a decline in stock price dilutes the chances for successful big equity raises 


substantially. Some of IIPR’s publicly traded tenants show unsustainable debt levels.  











We also noted that the credit profiles of the tenants have been trending negatively. Financial performance 


got worse and therefore the need for external financing increased. At the same time drastically fallen 


stock prices put IIPR’s tenants into a difficult situation to access such financing.  


To make matters worse for IIPR, the newly introduced Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code will put 


additional financial strains on its tenants. The new ruling forbids businesses associated with the 


“trafficking” of Schedule I or II substances, for example cannabis, to deduct otherwise ordinary expenses

from its taxable income. This might some cannabis businesses to pay taxes eventhough they might be still 


losing tons of cash on a cash flow basis.  





2.1 PharmaCann – IIPR’s By Far Biggest Client 
PharmaCann represents IIPR first and most important tenant in terms of income, representing more than 


one quarter of its total rental revenue with 26.2% in 2019 and 17% of the expected rental revenue in 2020.  


PharmaCann is a private cannabis operator and under a lease agreement with IIPR for 5 properties. Those 


properties are located in different states: New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois. Again, 


all individual leases are listed in the Appendix. 


The aggregate represents a total investment of $89,109,000 (excluding the remaining tenant 


improvements available but not used totaling $42,400,000) and a total annual rental income of 


approximately $18,794,000.  


PharmaCann acquired by MedMen for US$680M in October 2018 but the transaction was terminated a 


year later by MedMen in October 2019. The latest available financials for PharmaCann, filed as exhibits to 


publicly traded MedMen’s financials, paint a devastating picture. As of June 30, 2019, PharmaCann’s 


balance sheet looked horrendous, having accumulated $101,882,753 in liabilities, and the majority of the 


$13,870,311 in other assets consists of goodwill. PharmaCann was running at a quarterly burn from 


operations of $6.5M and was in urgent need of continuous financing to survive. With cash of $13,441,003 


in the bank as of June 30, 2019 PharmaCann had about two quarters left (excluding investing activities) 


before it ran dry without outside financing. With the MedMen deal falling apart, PharmaCann might be in 


serious solvency issues, and we found more strong signs for that during our due diligence.  


The MedMen deal failing apart had additional immediate negative consequences for PharmaCann. As part 


of the termination agreement, PharmaCann paid a termination fee to MedMen through a transfer of the 


membership interests in three entities (including a cultivation facility and two retail location in Illinois, as 


well as a license for vertically integrated facility in Virginia), which further deteriorated its credit quality. 


MedMen had advanced PharmaCann $3.4 million  in the period between December 23, 2018 and June 


30, 2019. 


PharmaCann’s Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Teddy Scott, who was involved in the company 


since its inception in 2014, resigned from his position in August 2019.  


All of PharmaCann’s cultivation properties are now encumbered so it doesn’t have further sale-leaseback 


alternatives and with private capital in cannabis heavily challenged, the company’s financial position can 


only become more dire. PharmaCann canceled in February 2020 the $4.0M construction funding 


commitment for its Pennsylvania facility. Is this a sign that the company is about to throw in the towel 


and declare bankruptcy?  


We spoke with several industry experts who confirmed PharmaCann is in a dire financial situation. We 


were also told that due to funding challenges and HSR provisions (antitrust) restricting integration efforts, 


PharmaCann operations were set back by over a year.  



https://www.chicagobusiness.com/marijuanacannabis/cresco-labs-co-founder-caltabiano-resigns
2.1.1 Throwing Good Money after Bad – Is IIPR PharmaCann’s Bank? 


We have established that PharmaCann is by far the most significant tenant for IIPR, and believe 


PharmaCann is currently financially challenged or even at the brink of insolvency. But here is where is gets 


a lot worse: While the initial deals IIPR made with PharmaCann had some economic basis, the latest 


transactions appear to be outright sham transactions. The series of events is noteworthy, IIPR signed a big 


$30M lease with PharmaCann in 2016, another big $18.5M deal in 2018 and three smaller deals recently 


in 2019.  


Readers should keep two questions in mind when reading our analysis on the last two sale-leasebacks IIPR 


signed with PharmaCann: 1. At what point does a price mark-up become fraudulent? 2. Has IIPR been 


engineering these transactions to keep their biggest tenant monetarily solvent? The answers and 


implications of the second question hint strongly at a Ponzi-like scheme: We suspect IIPR keeps its low-


quality tenant solvent through sham transactions to hide deteriorating credit quality from investors.  











We believe IIPR is trying to hide that its business model is fundamentally flawed. Already financially 


strained tenants sign overpriced sales leasebacks at onerous yields. No credible company would agree to 


sale leasebacks with its core assets for yields in excess of 13%, unless it urgently needs a cash injection 


now. Over time the high rent burdens the tenants additionally, but instead of reducing the exposure, IIPR 


extends additional short-term liquidity through more onerously priced sale leasebacks.
In PharmaCann’s specific case we think this scheme has naturally come to an end. We consulted with 


industry experts and believe that as of 2019, PharmaCann had  ran out of properties to sell to IIPR in sale-


leaseback transactions, and also don’t have sufficient cash to pursue new projects.  


In this section we examine the latest two of the four transactions between IIPR and PharmaCann to 


establish why we suspect IIPR is constructing sham transactions to keep its tenant solvent. Again, a 


comprehensive analysis on all leases can be found in the Appendix, which is uploaded as a separate 


document on our website.  





2.1.2 Scott Township PA – $260,000 a month for Empty Land? 


On August 8th, 2019, IIPR purchased property from PharmaCann for initially $942,000, offering 


reimbursement for improvement up to $29.1M for a total investment of $30.0 million (excluding 


transaction costs). 


We have identified the address to be Lot 4 Life Science Drive, Scott Technology Park, Olyphant, PA, 


corresponding to parcel 071.04-010-004.12 


The monthly Base Rent for the first twelve (12) months of the Term of the Lease is $260,000.  


We visited the site on 03/20/2020. To our astonishment, the property was still in very early age of 


construction.  





This should come as a huge surprise to investors. According to the schedule IIPR disclosed, construction 


was planned to finish in November of 2019.

Source: Exhibit C on development agreement 


However, according to a news report, construction was severely delayed and only began in December 


2019 as they only received final construction approval in October. PharmaCann spokesman Jeremy Unruh 


indicated that the property would be up and running in the second quarter of 2020. However, our research 


indicates that the property is far from completion. Moreover, due to the coronavirus breakout, we can 


expect severe delays in the construction. Why is PharmaCann willing to pay $3M in annual rent for an 


empty piece of land? According to IIPR’s footnote disclosure in the latest 10k, about $2.4M in construction 


funding already went into this property, but of that portion IIPR only funded about $745,000. So IIPR is 


still on the hook for the residual $1.6. We didn’t see the $2.4M improvements when we visited the 


property in person. We question whether the money IIPR sent to PharmaCann was used to further 


development of this lease, or to make rent payments on existing leases with IIPR. The worsening financial 


situation of PharmaCann suggests IIPR has thrown good money after bad in this case for the sake of 


keeping its key tenant afloat in the short term.   


2.1.3 Dwight IL – Real Estate Value Increase Over 10x in One Year without Any 


Major Changes 


On 10/30/2019 IIPR closed on the purchase of a property with approximately 48,000 sq. ft. of industrial 


space from PharmaCann. The purchase price was $18M, with up to $7M reimbursement for improvement. 


This was right after MedMen officially canceled the deal with PharmaCann, putting PharmaCann’s 


financial future at increased jeopardy. The deal terms are outrageous.  


We have identified the property to be located on 1200 E Mason Ave, Dwight, IL, 60420, parcel # 05-05-


02-300-015 



https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/after-delays-cannabis-grower-laying-groundwork-for-lackawanna-facility-1.2571905
This property showed significant price increases in just one year prior to the sales to IIPR. According to 


deed records, the property was sold for $1.75M in 08/16/2018 to PharmaCann before selling for $18M 


on 10/30/2019 to IIPR. This is a truly incredible mark-up. 





However, according to pictures from Google Maps, and our on the ground due diligence the property is 


still consisting of Steel Structures similar to ones built in 2015. We find it suspicious that the price has 


gone up significantly from $1.75M to $18M, over 10x, in just one year. We also see that the property is 


sold at a significant premium compared to the county’s assessment value.  


We dare to ask the question: Did this property really increase by over 10x in value or did IIPR inject money 


into its struggling main tenant?  


Below is the street view taken in June 2018.  











Our investigator visited the property in March 2020 and confirmed that minimal improvements have been 


made. We see construction to the right of the greenhouses, of what appears to be the early construction 


of an empty warehouse.

2.2 Vireo – IIPR’s Third Biggest Client is Also in Financial Troubles 





Vireo Health International, Inc. (CSE: VREO) (OTCQX: VREOF) is an American science-focused, multi-state 


cannabis company. The Company has operations in 10 states— Arizona, Maryland, Minnesota, 


Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island —and Puerto Rico.  


Leases with IIPR, Vireo represents the third most important tenant with 8.9% of their total rental revenue 


which is approximately $3.8/3.9M, by renting 4 of their properties. The aggregate of the investments 


made by IIPR for those properties is totaling approximately $26.2M. 


In 2019 Vireo has come short of its dispensary rollout plan and gross margins have been  significantly 


below expectations (16% in Q3/2019 vs 35% consensus and down 19% sequentially) Buildout in a number 


of locations have been put on hold and while the company has received some funding boost from Bruce 


Linton (Executive Chairman) recently, it still faces significant balance sheet risks going forward.
Similar to PharmaCann, the company has four properties tied up with IIPR at yields between 13.5%-16.5% 


which are very burdensome to cash flow in foreseeable future especially with operations progressing at 


much slower pace than initially anticipated. The company has a history of legal issues relating to smuggling 


charges against two former executives where company officials were charged with illegally transporting 


$500,000 worth of cannabis oil from the company’s Minnesota facility to its New York operation in 


December 2015. 


Along with its underperformance Vireo saw its stock price plummet by over 90% since its reverse-takeover 


last year. 





During the past 9 months Vireo has aggressively pursued acquisitions to overcome the struggles in its 


existing businesses but we attribute little value to the new acquisitions. Those acquisitions don’t represent 


much in terms of tangible assets and basis for future borrowing, according to their last quarterly filings; 


Only $4 million in tangible assets was acquired for a total investment of around $46.7 million. Vireo mostly 


acquired licenses (intangible assets), totaling a fair value of approximately $38.2 million. 


Vireo will need to raise a significant amount of money to operate these licenses properly. In fact, their 


intangible assets went from a very small $2,184,565 in December 31, 2018 to $38,149,913 as of 


September 30, 2019 while their operating expenses have just doubled, thus we believe that they are not 


yet operating most of their newly acquired licenses. Also, as of September 30, 2019, their net  loss is 


$19,884,720, ten times more than the same period a year before with a loss of $1,894,732. Vireo is 


currently at a run rate of burning about $11.3M in cash per quarter from operations; With $16.4M cash 


in the bank as of Q3 2019 the company had only 4.3 months of cash left before it will run out of money.  


Vireo just raised $10.5 million with the help of one of their directors (by indirectly subscribing for 


1,736,715 Units in the Offering, representing an estimate of $1.34 million) by issuing stock before their 


stock price collapsed. However we strongly believe this is far from enough and with the strongly 


suppressed stock price access to financing will be increasingly challenging.
2.3 DionyMed – IIPR signed a deal mere Weeks before Insolvency 
 


Another part of IIPR’s expected rental income that will never see the light of the day comes from 


DionyMed Brands Inc. (DYME). Indeed, this tenant is in receivership, considered bankrupt and has been 


delisted from both the Canadian and American Stock Market after going through numerous financial 


issues during the past year. Founded in 2017, DionyMed is (or was) a multi-state cannabis brands platform. 


DYME is a relatively small tenant for IIPR but the timing of the transaction is troubling. IIPR signed its only 


sale-leaseback with DYME at the end of July 2019, mere weeks before DYME went into default. DionyMed 


was one of the first and only major credit defaults in US cannabis, which makes us question the 


management’s investment/due diligence process, risk mitigation strategy and financial acumen. 


According to IIPR’s fillings, the tenant defaulted on its obligations to pay rent for January and February 


2020. After having a closer look at the tenant’s situation, we have no doubt about the fact that IIPR will 


have to find another tenant for this property and can put a cross on the money they are owed from their 


agreement with DionyMed. This tenant rents a property located in Los Angeles, California which 


represents approximately 35,000 square feet of rentable surface and approximately $776,000 in rental 


revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. This amount represents 5.9% of the investment of 


$13,000,000 made by IIPR to acquire this property (excluding tenant improvement allowance available of 


$2.0 million which has not been requested by the tenant).  


Starting March 2019, DionyMed Brands Inc. stock started to decline before getting caught in a downward 


spiral that eventually led to the stock being worth literally a penny.  





Some investors and executives of the company remained confident until the point where DionyMed 


started to receive numerous requests of repayment and notice of default in September 2019. The first 


one was from Flow Capital Corp. which engaged in legal proceedings against DionyMed Brands Inc. as  


DionyMed was in default under the company's royalty agreement. The claim was for the minimum sum 


of $2,698,116 made up of the investment balance, past-due royalty payments and late payment fees. 


Following this, the company Gotham Green also issued a request for repayment of its outstanding balance 


of $2.2 million representing the credit advance they made with DionyMed on July 30, 2019, plus accrued 


and unpaid interest.

https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item?bid=Z-C%3aDYME-2811539&symbol=DYME&region=C
Then in October, GLAS USA LLC and GLAS America LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent under 


DionyMed Brands Inc.'s credit agreement dated January 2019, provided the company with notice of 


default under the credit agreement and demand for immediate payment of the amount of $24,810,682.  


In the end, the company was unable to attract a viable transaction to restructure its debts and/or seek a 


sale of the company of its assets outside of a court process. GLAS America has therefore proceeded with 


the receivership application and the company, without any opposition, accepted the appointment of a 


receiver. 


Only a few days prior to receiving the notice, Edward Fields, DionyMed Brands Inc.'s chief executive 


officer, and Mark Zinselmeier, the company's interim chief operating officer, both resigned effective 


immediately. Mr. Fields also resigned as a director of the company and as an officer of the subsidiaries of 


the company. Following this decision, the company's four directors, being Susan Watt, David Kerr, Brett 


Moyer and Stephen Dineley, each independent director, have advised the company that they also intend 


to resign effective upon the appointment of the receiver. 


The one property PharmaCann sold to IIPR seems to us very problematic from a regulatory perspective. 


According to its PR statement, DionyMed received a provisional retail license from the California Bureau 


of Cannabis Control under its subsidiary Gourmet Green Room, Inc., for recreational and medical sales in 


its dispensary located at 1500 Esperanza Street in Los Angeles. The property in question at 1500 Esperanza 


Street is the property PharmaCann sold to IIPR. However we found photos showing that this property is 


clearly used as a growth facility.

2.4 MJardin – On its way to Insolvency 
 


MJardin is another client who seems weak and effectively insolvent.  


IIPR is leasing one property in Nevada to MJardin. It represents a rentable surface of 43,000 sq. The total 


investment made by IIPR for this property is $7,350,000 (excluding the remaining $2.2 million of 


improvement allowance available). The yield on this property is 13.7% which represents an annual rental 


income of approximately $1,006,000. 


MJardin seems to be in severe financial troubles, on the brink of insolvency. The company saw its stock 


price fall to $0.01 and thus their market cap reaching an alarming $6.654 million on March 23, 2020. 





MJardin was recently reported to be selling core assets in a desperate attempt to keep their head above 


the water. On January 2, 2020, MJardin said it had agreed to sell its GreenMart of Nevada cultivation 


facility in Cheyenne to a division of Phoenix-based Harvest Health & Recreation. MJardin plans to use the 


proceeds to reduce its debt and for working capital. The company bought GreenMart in July 2019. This 


shows that the acquisition only worsened their situation. 


MJardin burnt almost half of its cash in the period December 31, 2018 to September 30, 2019, going from 


approximately $30.4 million to $16.5 million. Receipts due from affiliates and related parties increased 


from $7.4 million to $13.9 million, which is another alarming sign of deteriorating earnings quality.  


MJardin burned $13.2M in cash from operations for Q3 2019 and we estimate the monthly burn to be 


about $4M. With the stock currently being severely depressed and the last capital raise in January 2020 


we estimate the company has only about 4 months until it runs out of capital and will be forced to halt 


operations. The coronavirus situation could have only worsened the company’s predicaments. The 


company discloses a going concern in their filings.  


MJardin has gone in a short period of time from an aspiring high growth company to a struggling company 


in what management calls a “turnaround” process.

3 Outrageous Markups, We See No Economic Basis for Lease Terms 
 


IIPR massively overpaid for the vast majority of the properties in its portfolio. An analysis of the deed 


records and conversation with county clerks enabled us to get transparency on the purchase history of 


each lease. All the transactions that IIPR has conducted are essentially sale-leaseback agreements, where 


the cannabis operator sells its property to IIPR and concurrently signs a long-term lease.  


For most of the leases in the below list our due diligence could not identify improvements on the 


properties that could possibly justify the giant mark ups in price within short periods of time. We also do 


not see an economic basis that would allow the tenants to pay anything near the proposed rent, simply 


because the underlying asset is too weak to produce that type of cash flow.  





We identified at least 18 of a total of 37 transactions were marked up by crazy amounts without proper 


justification. 


A couple of transactions are truly staggering, and one starts to wonder at what point this becomes fraud. 
We made an effort to analyze the merits of each individual deal, and concluded that out of 37 properties 
identified, 29 of them had obvious and significant issues that would negatively impact IIPR’s rental income 
directly, ranging from significant mark ups to defaults and egregious lease terms. 
 
The mark ups themselves are very problematic for multiple reasons. All of IIPR’s transactions are sale-
leaseback agreements. IIPR charges tenants about 14% on the investment, which also means that along 
with exaggerated purchase prices and improvements comes a high rent. This looks good for IIPR on paper, 
but we see that a lot of the leases lack the economic basis to charge such a high rent. Tenants are generally 
cash strapped and in need of short-term financing. This makes it more attractive for tenants to transact 
with IIPR now and receive outrageous returns on a property in a sale leaseback transaction, but will likely 
destroy the company in the future under the burden of the high rental payments. 
 
Another major reason we see for the mark-ups being highly problematic is that the repurposing value is 


likely be only a fraction of what IIPR paid for the properties. The vast majority of IIPR’s properties are not

lower prices if IIPR had to sell them to a non-cannabis operator (or any credible operator in our opinion).  


We consulted with the regional county clerks, who also often questioned why the property values were 
inflated so much in short periods of time.  
 
We highlight a couple of transactions in this report; The comprehensive analysis on the individual leases 
can be found in our Appendix, which is published in a separate document on our website. Frankly, the 
number of outrageous transactions is so big that it would blow the scope of this report.  
 


3.1 Lansing MI Ascend Wellness 
On 07/09/2019, IIPR closed the acquisition of a property in Lansing, MI, which comprises approximately 


145,000 sq. ft. of industrial space. The initial purchase price was approximately $4.8M, with additional 


reimbursement for improvements of up to $15M. We think IIPR significantly overpaid in this transaction 


with Ascend Wellness. 


We have identified the address to be 735 E. Hazel Street, Lansing, MI, 48912. Parcel ID #: 33-01-01-22-


105-001  


These are photos taken of the property on 01/15/2020. We do not see any signs of production activity 


going on and suspect it is an empty warehouse.
We visited the facility again on 03/23/2020. It appears construction has just started.  








We suspect the property is months away from being ready to use, and question why the tenant would 


pay rental income of $700,000 annually for an empty warehouse. 


More disturbingly, this property value has been hugely inflated. According to deed records, the property 


transaction price has gone up from $930,000 to $4.8M in merely a week! We also see it being priced at a 


significant premium compared to the county’s assessment.  


 
Are investors really supposed to believe that the value of this empty warehouse more than quadrupled 
within a week?

3.2 Harrison Township MU Emerald Growth Partners 
IIPR purchased a property in Harrison MI from Emerald Growth Partners comprising of 45,000 sq. ft. of 


industrial space on 06/05/2019 for a purchase price of $6.9M. IIPR is offering up to $3.1M in 


reimbursement for improvements.  


We identify the address to be 40800 Executive, Harrison Township, MI 48045  


Deed records show that IIPR purchased the property from EGH Executive LLC on 06/05/2019 for $6.86M, 


which matches IIPR’s announcement.  


However, another deed indicates that EGH Executive LLC purchased the exact property from Production 


Drive Properties on 07/04/2019 for $2M. 








The peculiarity of how EGH was able to sell a property to IIPR before even owning it is already disturbing. 


This transaction seems clearly prearranged to put money into the pockets of Emerald Growth Partners. 


We dare to ask again: Is IIPR really just a bank for low quality cannabis companies? We noticed that in the 


signature section of the deeds, these two deeds were signed one day apart. 



https://bsaonline.com/SiteSearch/SiteSearchDetails?SearchCategory=Parcel+Number&SearchText=17-11-13-277-027&SearchFocus=All+Records&uid=258&PageIndex=1&ReferenceKey=17-11-13-277-027&ReferenceType=0&SortBy=&SearchOrigin=0&RecordKeyDisplayString=17-11-13-277-027&RecordKey=1%3d17-11-13-277-027&RecordKeyType=1%3d0
We believe it is simply impossible to justify the price of the property to rise from $2M to $6.86M in just a 


matter of days.  


Our investigator visited the facility and discovered that it was now occupied by Pleasantrees, which is a 


retail medical marijuana outlet of Emerald Growth Partners.
3.3 Phoenix, AZ The Pharm 
 


IIPR purchased a property from The Pharm LLC on 09/19/2019, for a price of $2M. There was no PR 


statement for this purchase. We identify tenant improvement to be $452,000. 


We estimate 2020 rent for this property to be $373,000, representing a yield of 15.23%. 


According to deed records, we have located the property to be at the 1616 E. Glendale Avenue, Phoenix, 


Arizona. The property is currently occupied by Sunday Goods, a retail cannabis store. This is confirmed 


through the county’s parcel map.  





The deed records also show that this property was previously purchased by The Pharm LLC from 


Mitchell D. Song for $1.2M on 09/16/2019, merely three days before IIPR purchased it from The Pharm 


LLC. The price has gone up significantly by $800K, or 67% in three days, representing an annualized 


return of 8151%. We ask why IIPR didn’t buy the property directly, but instead chose to let The Pharm 


flip it for a huge profit within a few days.  


We visited the store and discovered that it wasn’t open. We confirmed this with the neighbors next 


door. A woman in the gas station suggested that the store won’t be open until end of March or April, 


but is highly suspicious even of this timeline due to the coronavirus. She also mentioned that the 


building was previously a pet veterinarian building knocked down in March or April 2019.

4 IIPR’s Business Model Seems Fundamentally Flawed  
 


We believe IIPR’s business model is fundamentally flawed. Already financially strained tenants sign 


overpriced sales leasebacks at onerous yields. No credible company would agree to sale leasebacks with 


its core assets for yields in excess of 13%, unless it urgently needs a cash injection now. Over time the high 


rent burdens the tenants, but instead of reducing the exposure, IIPR extends additional short-term 


liquidity through more onerously priced sale leasebacks.  


We simply do not see how IIPR buying warehouses and empty land for outrageous mark-ups creates low 


risk yields over 14%. The yield on investment might be initially high, but as we have shown in this report 


it is extremely risky and in a lot of cases the risks have already materialized (bankrupt tenants, empty 


land/construction way behind schedule, etc.). 


IIPR’s portfolio consists almost entirely of cultivation and manufacturing assets (almost no retail), which 


provide very limited recovery value. The majority of the facilities are warehouse spaces in remote 


locations away from city centers, which may not be appropriate for other industrial purposes under a 


triple net structure. If IIPR were forced to sell off assets we believe they would have to be sold at a 


substantial discount to IIPR’s acquisition price.  


On the surface, yields are already showing signs of compression and would likely continue on that path 


going forward due to increased competitions. Though IIPR discloses total portfolio yield, they have 


stopped disclosing acquisition yields in their press releases. One can see decreasing acquisition yields 


overtime.

 We also believe that IIPR faces significant regulatory and competitive risks. Headwind from US federal 


legalization of cannabis that can come through legislations like the SAFE Act and STATES Act would open 


the sector to banking and other financing alternatives. The Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking 


Act already passed the House in September 2019. Recently, there has also been some positive 


commentary on the bill, with Senator Gardner indicating that lawmakers are “close” to advancing the 


reform measure; We believe this could happen within months. The COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts 


on the cannabis sector is only emphasizing the need for regulatory changes, especially in regard to the 


banking access for cannabis companies, especially given the sector is excluded from accessing financial 


aid packages offered by the government. 


Management is guiding to 60-70% of their growth pipeline to derive from operators who are already 


tenants of IIPR. However, the higher quality, larger public multi-state operators have all been able to 


access the credit market over the past few months and will likely not rush to deal with IIPR at onerous 


terms. Also, as these operators become more profitable, they will be in much better position to service 


debt and would prefer to take on shorter-term fixed income liabilities rather than to sign long-term leases 


that escalate by 2.5-4% annually.  A few examples of MSOs accessing credit market (straight debt) in 


recent months include Cresco’s Securing $200M Senior Debt raise at 13% in February 2020, Harvest raising 


US$73M of senior secured notes at an interest rate of 15% and an additional $21M in senior secured notes 


at a rate of 9.25%, and CuraLeaf raising $275M in Debt at 14% in December 2019.  


We also found a few examples of other REITs signing deals with IIPR’s tenants and other operators (which 


could be potential targets for IIPR). This shows how limited the MSO landscape is and how competitive it 


is becoming for IIPR to sign new properties

COVID-19 could be the final blow to many of IIPR’s tenants and expedite the inevitable scenario. At the 
very least, a higher portion of IIPR’s 2020 rental income is in jeopardy. Direct negative impacts from Covid-
19 on IIPR and its tenants include:  


• Disruption to dispensary operations (E.g. MA, NV)  


• Missed lease payments 


• Disruption in production 


• Layoffs 


• Supply chain issues  


• Delays and cancellations of facility developments/construction and lower request for TI 
reimbursements which make up a significant portion of IIPR’s investments 


• Delays and slow downs in license and regulatory approvals 


• Likely delays in adult-use transitions in many states (e.g. NY which IIPR has meaningful exposure 
to) 


We believe the impacts of COVID-19 are not yet priced into the stock. It’s also important to note that the 
stock is up by 70% since March 18, 2020 but the overall social and economic outlook and impacts and of 
the pandemic have not improved but have actually worsened.

5 Cash Flow Analysis shows Dividend is unsustainable – Why we 
believe IIPR has the characteristics of a Pyramid Scheme 





In this chapter we quantify the impact of our previous analysis to set the insights into perspective and get 


an accurate picture of IIPR’s financial future. We believe the company has overpaid for properties with 


cash hungry tenants, who soon falter under the pressure of IIPR leases. This has led to defaulting tenants, 


and sham deals in an effort to keep the most important tenants afloat.  


The discounts we apply are based on a few main factors: 


• The tenant is already insolvent/has declared bankruptcy 


• The tenant is at high risk of insolvency 


• The underlying properties show no economic justification for the rental prices 


This spreadsheet shows our comprehensive bottom up analysis of every single lease we have identified. 


According to sell side reports the company has 52 leases in total of which we were able to identify 37. The 


remaining leases are smaller, and/or have not been announced or disclosed in any detail by IIPR. Our 


instinct tells us that if you see one cockroach there are probably many. In IIPR’s case that means that the 


smaller leases where the company is even more opaque should be expected to have even more egregious 


terms than the ones we actually found. Accordingly, we apply the average discount of the properties we 


were able to find to the unidentified portion of the property portfolio.  


 According to our analysis, after taking into consideration the effects of tenants defaulting, and removing 


overpayment effects, we determine that even in a good case scenario at least 38% of IIPR’s 2020 rental 


income is under direct jeopardy. In our Appendix where comprehensively analyze each lease we explain 


in detail our reasons for applying a discount for each individual property.
If we look at our bad case scenario, which in our opinion is more realistic due to the worsening economic 


environment, we are looking at a 49% decrease in 2020 rental income. Again, the detailed reasons for the 


application of a discount on each property are listed in our Appendix.

At the current run rate IIPR would have to pay out $86M in dividends throughout 2020. It seems to us that 


the company will not be able to do so based on our analysis. We expect that the dividend will have to be 


reduced substantially.

6 The WeWork of Cannabis?  
 


We see many striking similarities between IIPR and WeWork. WeWork has recently made headlines 


through its failed IPO along with the departure of its CEO and founder Adam Neumann.  


Both companies are led by a young dynamic/charismatic CEO/founder. While Neumann has already 


departed as CEO of WeWork Alan Gold is still maintaining his official roles with IIPR. However we can’t 


help but feel that Alan Gold is looking to exit the company given his new extensive side ventures (we 


comment on this more in the section below). 


Both businesses are flawed real estate models. WeWork had a run on the bank when it couldn’t manage 


to access financing through a public offering. Similarly, we believe there is a high risk for IIPR to get into 


serious financial issues once investors realize the low quality of IIPR’s assets and how dependent the 


company really is on equity raises.  


WeWork and IIPR also have in common that they promise their investors a differentiated business model 


and high-quality assets. WeWork liked to present itself as a community and technology company. IIPR 


pretends to have found the holy grail of real estate yields by renting to cannabis operators. We simply do 


not see how IIPR buying warehouses and empty land for outrageous mark-ups creates low risk yields over 


14%. The yield on investment might be initially high, but as we have shown in this report it is extremely 


risky and in a lot of cases the risks have already materialized (bankrupt tenants, empty land/construction 


way behind schedule, etc.).  


6.1 Is Alan Gold Exiting? 
Executive Chairman Alan Gold has been arguably the key driver and brain behind IIPR since its inception. 


His resume and credibility have allowed the company to conduct multiple capital raises without any kind 


of track record.  


Alan Gold has recently started another venture called IQHQ - (Formerly Creative Science Properties). The 
company focused on life science office developments and Alan Gold is currently a Director and Executive 
Chairman. Given Alan Gold’s profile and selected subsector of his new entity, we have reason to believe 
Alan’s attention is stretched too far. 
 
This is also concerning, given: 


• Mr. Gold’s role and importance in IIPR as Chairman and key drive since its inception 
• IIPR is still a growth stage company requiring full attention of management and board 


IQHQ is by no means a small venture either. The company has already raised almost as much capital as 
IIPR’s total raise to-date in a single private raise, namely $770M of equity capital.  
 
IQHQ is already taking on big projects with a $270M purchase of Fenway Office-Medical Property in 
Boston; This is larger than any other project that IIPR is involved with. The project includes a main 22-
story high-rise building, a 12-story mid-rise building, and a shared use automated garage that will be 
accessible to both buildings. This seems to us far more sophisticated and financially/time/labor-
consuming than any of IIPR’s projects.

https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businesswire.com%2Fnews%2Fhome%2F20200212005685%2Fen%2FCreative-Science-Properties-Forms-New-REIT-Rebrands&data=02%7C01%7Cspuri%40ansonfunds.com%7C20e28736c1cf4f33017108d7d4c3f690%7Ccc9b37f8dcad49d5ae78c4bd3b8862f3%7C0%7C0%7C637211810451163276&sdata=Ho6IIjGuY2QEo55XtookGgSnE30q6ggoJUydVhUL5K4%3D&reserved=0
Alan Gold has not yet officially resigned from any of his positions with IIPR and the company continues to 
pay him over $2.6M per year. This is about 2.5x the annual salary for IIPR’s CEO.  Should IIPR reduce Alan 
Gold’s pay knowing a large portion of his time will be allocated to another growth company? 





7 Our Independent Analysis Suggests Significant Downside  
 


At the end of 2019, IIPR had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $117.3M and exchangeable 
senior notes of $134.7M. IIPR has meaningful obligations towards its tenants to fund improvements, 
amounting as of December 31st 2019 to $195M. It is also noteworthy that IIPR still has to pay for about 
$25M in tenant improvements that were already made but not yet funded by IIPR. We noticed that an 
increasing number of tenants start to cancel tenant improvements in the first few weeks of 2020. $4M of 
construction funding commitments related to IIPR’s lease with PharmaCann at one of IIPR’s Pennsylvania 
properties was canceled. Green Peak amended its lease with IIPR which, among other things, canceled 
the remaining tenant improvement allowance of approximately $15.2M. DionyMed, which is effectively 
bankrupt now, has unsurprisingly also canceled $2M of tenant improvements.   
 
However, investors should also pay attention to the reimbursement options that IIPR extended to certain 
tenants including Trulieve and Grassroots, amounting according to the company’s 10K to approximately 
$53.8M.  
 


These reimbursement options between IIPR and these tenants are essentially “put options” and they will 


likely only get exercised if the tenant is unable to access alternative financing. Since the tenants have the 


option of cancelling these reimbursements, these leases should not be considered when estimating the 


company’s NAV or rent projections.  


As the March 2020, the company’s shareholder equity was $798.0M, and the company’s majority asset is 


Net Real Estate held for Investment of $505.9M. We note that IIPR’s current book value is only $46.84 per 


share. However, an analysis only based on book value of assets booked at costs ignores the quality of the 


assets. Based on our tenant and rental income analysis in above sections, we believe that the economic 


and fair value of IIPR’s main balance sheet item should be materially lower.  


Another way to look at the company’s value is its ability to pay out dividend to investors and dividend 


yield rate would be able to compensate the risk that investors bear when holding IIPR’s stock. Based on 


our rental income analysis, we estimate that IIPR’s rental income would be 38% lower in a Good Case 


Scenario and 49% lower in a Bad Case Scenario in 2020 compared to 2019, which would translate to an 


even greater decrease in IIPR’s dividend due to costs remaining relatively resilient. 


We have shown in this report that IIPR’s assets are risky and overpriced, and we do not believe that the 


current spread between the company’s cost of capital and the yield on the underlying assets is sustainable. 


At current prices and with the current dividend run rate, IIPR sports a cost of equity capital around 5.38%, 


while its risky portfolio of assets yields over 13%. We think IIPR’s valuation will adjust to reflect more 


closely the risk profile of its underlying assets. We do not think IIPR deserves a premium valuation, if 


anything a discount is applicable due to the severe operational challenges we outline in this report.

For our valuation we assumed that the average rental decrease of our good and bad case scenario, 


which is a 43.5% decrease. We then adjusted the company’s cost of equity capital up from 5% to about 


8%, still giving IIPR a premium valuation that it probably does not deserve. We conclude a price target of 


$22.29. 





8 Conclusion 
 


We have demonstrated in this report why we are deeply skeptical of IIPR and its management. In the end, 


we think the business model is fundamentally flawed and starting to fall apart. IIPR is heavily dependent 


on capital raises, and we expect the company to approach the capital markets aggressively in 2020. The 


company currently still has about 10M shares available for sale through its ATM offering. The dividend 


will have to be reduced or financed from capital raises.  


We also expect Executive Chairman Alan Gold to continue pursuing other ventures more extensively. Is 


he realizing the tide is about to turn for IIPR in a tightening capital market? 


Even though flawed sell side reports from investment banks continue to push IIPR’s stock we think the 


company will soon run out of investors willing to buy the stock at heavily inflated prices. And the clock is 


ticking for IIPR.
