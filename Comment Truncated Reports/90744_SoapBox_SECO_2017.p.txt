This research report expresses soley our opinions. Use Soapbox Research opinions at your own risk. In no event should Soapbox Research be 


liable for any direct or indirect trading losses caused by any information contained in this report. We have a short interest in Secoo Holding 


Limited’s stock and therefore stand to realize gains in the event that the price of the stock declines. Please refer to our full disclaimer located 


on the last page of this report. 





Secoo Holding Ltd (“SECO” or “the company”) has fabricated their financial statements and lied about 


their business. We initiate coverage with a price target of $0 and 100% downside as we believe that the 


company will be delisted for filing fraudulent financial statements with the SEC.  





1) SAIC filings of VIEs Beijing Secoo and Beijing Auction show 


that SECO has lied in their prospectus and  has committed 


fraud.  SECO primarily conducts their business through two 


Variable Interest Entities (VIEs).  SAIC filings of these 


operating entities show that SECO has inflated their revenue 


by over 600% in 2016.  


2) SECO is likely involved in smuggling. Secoo does not show 


any import records despite claiming to sell primarily 


imported goods. A key competitor was arrested for 


smuggling just a few months ago. If SECO were conducting 


actual business, they would have to import a substantial 


amount of goods for sale. The lack of import records shows 


not only that the company is lying about their financial 


statements but that it is likely involved in smuggling.  


3) SECO customer disclosures are illogical and show likely false. 


SECO also uses bots and paid pumpers to give the 


appearance of online activity.  Screen shots from app store 


show use of bots to fake reviews.  


4) Auditor resignation and declining employee count despite 


claimed increase in sales.  SECO has significantly reduced 


headcount despite growth claims.  SECO dismissed auditor 


PWC without saying why and switched the much more fraud-


friendly KPMG in November of 2016. Disclosure in the 


prospectus shows a 27% decrease in headcount despite 


growth claims.

Introduction 


Secoo Holding Ltd conducted an IPO on September 22, 2017, at $13 per share. As we are now several 


years into a bull market cycle, and the Chinese ADR index is up 56% YTD, promoters and bankers are 


back to bringing fraudulent Chinese companies back to capital markets. In the prospectus filed with the 


SEC, SECO relied heavily upon claims made by Frost & Sullivan that it is “Asia's largest online integrated 


upscale products and services platform as measured by GMV in 2016”
1
.  Frost & Sullivan is no stranger 


to providing falsified market studies which appear to support claims made by fraudulent companies.  


Frost & Sullivan most recently and notably provided research that supported claims by Tianhe Chemical 


(“Tianhe”) which have now been proven fraudulent.  This was an $8 Billion fraud perpetrated in Hong 


Kong, and is currently being investigated by the SFC.  Investors that followed Frost & Sullivan’s 


conclusions were completely wiped out.  The history of Frost and Sullivan shows that no investor should 


rely on any research provided by them. 


The reality is that the online vertical luxury goods business in China is incredibly competitive and has 


been struggling
2
. Luxury brands do not want to diminish their brands through lower pricing and rarely 


cooperate with vertically integrated retailers.  The preferred manner by which they do business is to set 


up their own shops on Tmall or JD.com and control pricing.  As well, well off Chinese are able to travel 


abroad freely or to Hong Kong and Macau in order to purchase luxury goods.  It makes no intuitive sense 


that SECO could actually succeed in this industry in particular competing against internet giants like 


Alibaba and JD.  Closer inspection shows that the company is simply lying in their financial statements.

SAIC Files Show Evidence of Fraud 


SAIC financials for SECO’s largest operating subsidiaries show substantially lower revenues that 


reported: 


Beijing Secoo 2015

Beijing Secoo 2016
5 
 


Beijing Auction 2015
6 
 


Bejing Auction 2016 





According to the SECO prospectus, it conducts its business through VIEs.  This is a common arrangement 


that is familiar to all investors in Chinese companies.  A company cannot conduct business over the 


internet in China without an ICP license, and foreigners cannot hold shares in a company with an ICP 


license.  


 Page 127 of the prospectus clearly explains that SECO’s online business is conducted through these 


licensed entities:
7 
 


Beijing Secoo holds the license for the main website while Beijing Auction holds the license for the 


auction business: 








According to the Propsectus, SECO claims to have online revenue of RMB1,277mm (US$192mm) in 2015 


and RMB2,273mm (US$342mm) in 2016.  See below form the prospectus: 








Because of the arrangements and regulations described above, this online revenue must have been 


recorded by the two VIEs.  We obtained SAIC files for these two subsidiaries (shown above) and we 


discovered that SECO has lied in their IPO prospectus:

As you can see, actual revenues for the two entities are a small fraction of what the company claims.

SAIC filings not only show that the VIEs are much smaller but that revenues are shrinking substantially.  


Desperate because their business was failing, SECO has turned to committing fraud and conducting an 


IPO to hide their failure.  





Smuggling and No Import Records 


Because SECO claims to sell luxury goods, a substantial amount of their inventory must be imported.  


See below form page 19 of the prospectus: 





However, SECO’s subsidiaries and VIEs show NO records of imports at all.  It is likely that for the small 


amount of items it does sell SECO is smuggling goods.  In fact, the owner of a large competitor luxury 


goods site xiu.com was recently arrested for smuggling:

The fact that we are unable to locate any import records of the subsidiaries means that SECO is likely 


smuggling the goods they are reporting in SAIC files just like their competitor.

False Claims about Customer Activity 


According to the prospectus: 





SECO claims to have 15.1 million members but only 300 thousand active customers. Additionally, they 


claimed that they processed 953,700 orders.  Looking at the above, this means that 51% of the active 


users only ordered once, meaning orders attributable to one-time use would be 953,700 – 


(51%*300,000) = 800,700 orders from repeat customers.  If the prospectus is to be believed, that means 


147,000 people accounted for over 800,00 orders. Based on what the company claims for average order 


size, that means there must be 147 thousand people ordering at least 5 times a year for more than 


3,500 RMB per order.  This is highly unlikely.  These big spenders could easily purchase goods outside of 


China.   


In order to pass due diligence, we believe that SECO has faked its member number.  As we can see in the 


app reviews, there are paid pumpers and bots that are made to appear like users.  This comment is 


particularly telling:
11 
 








Other Red Flags 


Declining headcount in the prospectus contradicts the narrative of a growing company: 





The red box highlighted says “long 


press the dotted box to copy 


comment content”. The pumper is 


actually so lazy/clumsy that s/he 


didn’t even bother to delete the 


copying instructions for pumping!  


Readers who can read Chinese can 


also easily see how fake the other 


comments are.
12 
 


Any company that is supposedly growing at such a rate would need to increase the support staff to 


handle order volume, traffic, and customer inquiries.  This shows that SECO is likely lying about their 


growth. By contrast, Alibaba increased headcount by 37% in the year ending March 31, 2017
3
.  


Page 101 of the prospectus shows that before deciding to substantially inflate revenue in preparation 


for an IPO, SECO dismissed PWC and hired KPMG.  No reason was given: 


“On October 31, 2015, we dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP, or 


PricewaterhouseCoopers, as our independent registered public accounting firm, and, on November 23, 


2016, engaged KPMG” 


KPMG has been associated with numerous China frauds
4
, and so we believe that SECO hired them in 


order to find someone more gullible.  





Valuation 


SECO is a loss making company perpetrating accounting fraud. As we have no reliable financial 


information other than SAIC files that show a tiny loss making business, we believe that the company 


will be delisted and has a value of $0 per share, downside of 100%.
