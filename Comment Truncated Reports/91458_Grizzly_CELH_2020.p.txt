Why We Don’t Trust Celsius Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CELH) 
Portrayed Growth


- Celsius Holdings Inc. is a fitness beverage company that
has seen its stock skyrocket in 2020 on the back of sudden and
unexpected revenue growth
- Investors have been led on by strong sales trends driving
sky-high expectations for the future, though our analysis shows
Europe, a substantial portion of the business, is not nearly as
good as it looks, with far lower and potentially negative sequen-
tial growth across Q3-2019 to Q2-2020.
- We find Celsius’ acquisition of their Nordic distributor
Func Foods concerning, and urge investors to question why 
management would commit resources to a non-core business 
approaching insolvency with a poor track record of successfully 
growing brands, serving a geography with declining sales 
- Our search for a rationale revealed what appears to us to
be several troublesome factors indicating Func may have been
used for sales manipulation and/or channel stuffing. We highlight
rising payables, beneficial distribution terms, and strong hints at
Multi-Level-Marketing Activities.
- It is not surprising these concerns have not been
addressed, as Celsius’ auditor Assurance Dimensions has a far 
from stellar track record and in our view seems ill-equipped to 
spot misrepresentations.
- Celsius has also rightfully come under scrutiny for
misleading advertising. We believe the company carefully walks
the line with the health benefit claims of its products, backed by
self -funded scientific studies, and that the recent rise in sales will
bring additional regulatory scrutiny to the brand, an under-repre-
sented risk.
- There are key individuals with worrying backgrounds
that seem largely unknown to investors. We believe Celsius’s key 
shareholder Carl DeSantis has a checkered history of what 
appears to be fraudulent behavior. Particularly concerning, we 
believe Carl DeSantis is really the mastermind behind the 
company. 
- An executive member of Celsius’ initial Nordic Distribu-
tor People’s Choice (acquired by Func Foods) is linked to the
“Panama Papers”.
- Current shareholders are selling large portions of shares.�
Investors who participated in the 2020 Private Placement�
immediately offered an on-shelf prospectus to dump their shares.�
We see lack of confidence in their own stock.
- Given the risks noted in this report, we believe investors�
should exercise caution when thinking about the growth that
(judging by market valuation) is assumed to be a foregone�
conclusion. Combine this with the apparent fraudulent track�
record of key individuals and an auditor who seems ill-equipped�
to detect fraud, and you have yourself a perfect set up for a bad�
awakening. We see the stock declining to a price target of $�����
and potentially much lower.

Research report on Celsius Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CELH)


Background
Celsius Holdings Inc develops, markets, and distrib-
utes fitness beverages under the Celsius brand. The 
company was founded in 2004 and came public via a 
reverse merger in 2007, with subsequent perfor-
mance resembling a pump and dump as the stock 


October 9th 2020


price dropped over 95% from peak in its first year. 
Despite the rocky start, Celsius has made significant 
operational progress over the last decade, growing 
from a fledgling microcap into a business now valued 
in close to $1.5 billion. 


Celsius experienced modest growth in its early years, 
as their “good for you” active lifestyle energy drinks 
saw slow adoption in the US and internationally, but 
things began to change in 2017 as sales started to 
ramp. 2018 saw the trend continue and 2019 capped 
off with stellar 43% YoY growth. Growth continued to 


look positive into 2020, and did not go unnoticed by 
investors, with the company’s market cap quadru-
pling to over $1.6B over YTD 2020, implying a ~13x 
2020 EV/Revenue multiple.


While the expectations built into the valuation are 
clearly lofty, there is indication to believe investors 
are significantly overestimating Celsius’ earnings 
growth capability. The hitch lies in Celsius’ European 
operations, led by recently acquired Swedish / 
Finnish distributor Func Foods. Europe contributed 
to nearly a quarter of the 43% growth in 2019 and 
has grown to account for almost half of all growth 
in H1-2020. At first glance this doesn’t seem like a 
serious cause for concern, but further analysis 


reveals that true growth in Europe is likely far lower 
and potentially negative sequentially, obfuscated by 
the acquisition. 


But it gets even worse. In our research we uncovered 
multiple red flags that lead us to conclude that there 
is a high probability of channel stuffing in the Europe-
an segment and other aspects that lead us to doubt 
the integrity of Celsius’s financial statements.

Func Foods Acquisition: When Misallocated Resources 
Looks Deceptively Good
On Sep. 11th 2019, Celsius announced the acquisition of Nordic wellness company Func Food Group Oyj, claim-
ing that it would bolster their product portfolio and provide a well-established operational infrastructure and 
unique marketing platform critical to expanding the Celsius brand in Europe.


“In addition, the combined business is expected to enable much stronger in-market investments to drive 
expansion across Europe before expected broader brand and market consolidation occurs. Adding Func 
Food's FAST Sports Nutrition line to the Celsius® line- will provide Celsius with new, additive revenue 
streams and establish an additional product offer and platforms for growth. ”    
           --- Celsius PR


The acquisition instantaneously doubled European 
revenues, from ~$3.4M in Q3-2019 to over $6.8M in 
Q4-2019 which further jumped to $8.5M in Q1-2020 
(the first quarter to fully account for the acquisition, 
which closed on Oct 24, 2019). While optically this 
looks great, all Celsius did was merge Func Food’s 
margin into their own. Investors are perceiving this 
massive bump as a key piece to the hyperbolic 


growth story when largely all they’ve done is switch-
ing from recording the revenue via sell-in (when it 
reaches the distributor) to sell-through (when it 
reaches the final consumer) and acquiring the addi-
tional margin. The disconnect lies in that Celsius is 
being compensated for growth that isn’t really 
growth if you look past the surface. So what does 
the true sales growth really look like?


Func Foods provides public quarterly reports and conveniently breaks out Celsius product sales, though the 
filings are only available through to Q1-2019. The statistics are not encouraging, with flat towards decreasing 
revenue across 2017-2019.

October 9th 2020


R E P O R T S


Func Foods Acquisition: When Misallocated Resources 
Looks Deceptively Good
To take things one step further, we look at the margin 
profile of Func Food, by comparing Celsius’ Europe 
revenues (essentially COGS for Func) vs Func’s Celsius 


specific revenues. Averaging out the quarterly gross 
margin for the latest full year of data we have avail-
able (2018) yields the following:


Adjusting down the consolidated post-acquisition 
revenues by Func Foods’ average gross margins 
provides a rough method for a closer apples to apples 
comparison versus Celsius’ previous quarters, and 
shows far lower and potentially negative growth 
versus the stellar 102.1% and 24.6% growth that is 


perceived. Most notably, Q3-2019, the latest quarter 
prior to the Func Food Acquisition, vs Q1-2020, the 
first quarter fully inclusive , shows little to no growth 
in the core Europe business. Adding the latest 
results from Q2-2020 continues to show a downward 
trend, with the potential to go to negative in coming 
quarters.


Upon adjustment, it is quite evident that EU certainly 
has not seen the purported revenue growth in the 
consumer end, and that the drastic growth portrayed 
was merely an accounting gimmick to transfer gross 
profit from Func Food into top line revenue at Celsius.


Worse yet, despite management constantly boosting 
the synergies of the acquisition of the Nordic Partner, 
we believe this is ultimately a EPS dilutive transaction 
that in the short-term enhances perceived growth 


but will in the long run only hurt investors.


We find ample evidence that suggests that the 
acquition was nothing more than a bailout of a 
failing company, a summation of two money 
losing entities. Management cleverly portrays 
the artificial growth in revenue while not address-
ing the misrepresentation of revenue and cash 
flow.

Func Foods Acquisition: Contradictory Statements Raise 
Concernsthat EU Acquisition Wasn’t Part of the Plan
While the revenue bump from acquiring Func looks 
good optically, the data seems to show Celsius placed 
resources into a geography where growth was 


inadequate. Management also indicates in commen-
tary as recent as Q1-2019, that the real opportunity 
lies in North America, and that they don’t see that 
much growth potential in Europe:


Regards the Nordics, they did had a really good first quarter, as we mentioned. They had a new launch 
with a flavor called Peach Vibe, which was really successful. It seems to be the overall downturn we saw in 
2017 and 2018 has stabilized. We're working with them really closely to continue to make sure we stabi-
lize that Nordic operations and protect our that revenue that's there. So we're working with them closely. 
We're really focused at this point on North American expansion. There's opportunities throughout 
Europe, but with the limited resources we have -- as I mentioned, we're a really lean team. There's so much 
opportunity right now in North America with the expansions that's going place. We are very much 
focused on North America. We do have -- through our Nordic partner, there is activities and store 
expansion going on, taking place in Finland and Norway. But outside of that, at this point, we are really 
focused on North America.
          
Europe, we've stated prior and within our European market really about stabilization within the region 
and we anticipate that move to more normalized levels as we stated in the past. We do have a strong 
presence with ACV there. We don't see a tremendous amount of expansion at this point. We're using 
all of our capital resources for North America, so more of a stabilization.


          ---Q1 2019 CC


Following the emphasis made on the US sector, and a 
slow-down in underlying growth in Europe in Q2 
2019, Celsius management suddenly dubiously 
decided to acquire Func Food.

Func Foods Acquisition: Func Food Sports a History of Fail-
ing Brands


To make matters worse, Celsius appears to be only 
one of many brands that Func Food had failed to 
promote and grow successfully. Using internet 
archives, we identified that across 2003-2018, Func 
Food has attempted to build 11 brands. Today, only 3 
have survived, Celsius, FAST and CocoVi. This 
indicates that Celsius effectively bought an “expert” in 
distribution and brand building that could only 


successfully scale 2/10 brands outside of Celsius, with 
the surviving 2 also declining. This hardly fits the 
description of a “well-established operational 
infrastructure and unique marketing platform”. Not 
to mention the fact that Celsius is not in the distribu-
tion and supply chain business (evidenced by the fact 
that all of NA distribution is outsourced). 


CocoVi and FAST are the only 2 brands that survived to today outside of Celsius. However, these two brands 
appear to be quickly deteriorating as well. 


“Management updated their estimates for net revenue and cashflow for year 2019-2023. Key change is 
related to lowering the sales outlook of CocoVi products in Finland and Sweden. In addition FitFarm 
sales trend has been updated to steadily declining. For FAST brand portfolio restructuring in Finland 
and Sweden will slow down next few years' growth, and FAST expansion countries sales outlook has 
also been decreased.”
          --- CGU Finland 2018


This begs the question, why would Celsius buy a branding and distribution business that has this poor track 
record and has consistently struggled with unprofitability, when Celsius does not even do distribution at all?

Func Foods Acquisition: Revenue Recognition, Payables 
and Commentary Indicates Potential Channel Stuffing 


Celsius recognizes revenue under sell-in, which is whenever they sell to a distributor, vs sell-through, which is 
when the product reaches the final customer. This is standard in the beverage industry, but there is some alarm-
ing commentary and line items that bring concern. 


First, the commentary noting all Nordic revenue is sell in, and does not indicate the product was sold to end 
consumers:


“In Europe, revenues for the third quarter were down 11%, coming in at approximately $3.4 million and 
slightly down to flat for the first 9 months of 2019 due to timing of new flavor launches, promotional 
programs and timing of orders. Please keep in mind, these revenues are derived from Celsius sales 
to our Nordic partner and are not sales from our Nordic partner to retail locations and consum-
ers, i.e., sell-in or sell-through data. In addition, these figures are not consolidated as the Func Food 
Group acquisition took place post quarter-end on October 24. “      
          --- Q3 2019 CC


Of greater interest is CEO John Fieldly’s comments on the Nordics at a UBS Consumer and Retail Conference in 
April 2020:


“So it wasn't a core strategy for the company in the beginning. It was a good way for the company to 
receive immediate cash on cans being sold that we were producing in North America, and it's going 
back really in 2010, is when they first launched. “        
                                           --- Q3 2019 CC


While Mr. Fieldly’s comments do not necessarily indicate channel stuffing, they are not encouraging. A 2015 
contract between Celsius and People’s Choice, who previously managed Nordic distribution of Celsius before 
being bought by Func Foods, indicates generous upfront terms with up to 50% of the purchase price paid out 
before the distributor receives the order: 


“The Distributor shall pay twenty-five (25) percent of each total order price seven (7) days prior to sched-
uled can production for the ordered Products and twenty-five (25) percent of each total order price seven 
(7) days prior to the scheduled filling of the cans for the ordered Products. The remaining fifty (50) percent 
of the total order price will be due net ninety (90) days from the date of pick up of the Products. “  
                            --- Distribution Agreement


Is this simply good working capital management on Celsius’ part, or are they forcing a distributor into a situation 
where it can’t be economically viable? There is one additional piece that adds incremental concern to the issue, 
and that is the payables at Func Foods. Func Food’s payables rose steadily, peaking at 9.3M EUR in Q1-2019, the 
last quarter of public financials we have available before Func was acquired.

R E P O R T S


Func Foods Acquisition: Revenue Recognition, Payables 
and Commentary Indicates Potential Channel Stuffing 


Considering Celsius was Func’s main brand and 
revenue contributor by a large margin (and the last 
two brands standing are also failing), it’s safe to say 
that it is very likely a large portion of those payables 


were due to Celsius. This is in fact corroborated by 
Celsius in their purchase documents, where they state 
approximately $5.2M USD of payables were due to 
them from Func Foods:


“The preliminary purchase price allocation has been used to prepare pro forma adjustments in the pro 
forma balance sheet and income statement. The final purchase price allocation will be determined when 
the Company has completed the detailed valuations and necessary calculations. The final allocation may 
include (1) changes in fair value of inventories, (2) changes in fair values of property and equipment, (3) 
changes in goodwill and allocations to intangible assets such as trade names, technology, and customer 
relationships, and (4) other changes to assets and liabilities. The accounts payable include $5.2 million 
of payables due to the Company. “         
                                                                                                                                                          -- Celsius 8K


So in addition to an optical doubling of European 
revenues, Celsius also got to sweep away a multi-mil-
lion dollar loss on potentially uncollectable receiv-
ables (uncollectable as Func was nearing bankruptcy 
and creditors would have likely taken all that 
remained of the company). This rationale seems 
much more likely to be the reasoning for acquiring 
Func, as the revenue growth and opportunity to scale 
do not seem compelling. In fact, in Q3 and Q4 2019, 
Celsius produced its best OCF results in its entire 


lifespan. We highly suspect it to be a result of aggres-
sive channel stuffing and the avoidance of write-offs 
through an acquisition that  essentially cancelled out 
the receivables. In other words, we believe instead of 
being transparant with Wall Street, Celsius decided to 
extend, pretend and enjoy the fruits of their obfuscat-
ing labor.

Func Foods Acquisition: On the Ground Due Dilligence 
Validates Our Concerns of Poor Growth 
Our investigator visited a number of stores that 
People’s Choice identified as major customers. We 
interviewed sales guides and store owners, and 
collected expiration dates on competing brands. 


Typically, better selling brands in the same category 
tend to have more distant expiration dates, as they 
are sold out more quickly and therefore re-shelfed 


with more recently produced products. Unsurprising-
ly, upon compiling and averaging the expiration dates 
of multiple well-known brands, Celsius has the closest 
expiration dates, averaging only July 2021. Whereas 
Redbull on average expires in Nov 2021, and Monster 
averages May 2022. 


We also inquired into how each brand was selling, 
and asked for recommendations for energy drinks in 
each store. Although Celsius was recognized as one of 
the larger brands, rarely did anyone recommend it. 
Nor did anyone identify them as top selling or top 
growing. In fact, almost every store mentioned that 
either Redbull or Monster was their best seller, 
and either Nocco or Powerking were their fastest 
growing brands. 


Sample Interview ( Bergendalhs Foods aka. City Gross )


speaker 1:Hello there I wonder where the energy drinks are 
located?
Speaker 2: There are some here in the refrigerator and some 
over there.
Speaker 1: Which one do you recommend?
Speaker 2: These ones are better which are the ones located 
by the entrance and the exit, they are refrigerated.
Speaker 1: I see, the ones that sell the best are the ones that 
are stored cold in the refrigerator?
Speaker 2: No I think it is not like that.
Speaker 1: Because I am interested in becoming a distributor 
and then I would like to know which one is selling the most?
Speaker 2: That is Powerking, people are looking for the 
cheapest alternative. Also it doesn't matter if they are cold 
or not. They still buy.
Speaker 1: Ok, thank you.
Speaker 2: You are welcome.

Func Foods Acquisition: Negative + Negative ≠ Positive
So what is the actual result of the acquisition on 
Celsius’s financial performance? According to our 
analysis, beneath the flabbergasting top line revenue 
growth, the acquisition is simply the summation of 


two EBITDA negative, Net Income negative and 
cashflow negative companies. What’s the answer to 
a negative number + a negative number? The correct 
answer is more negative.

Func Food Financials


EBITDA (EUR Mil) Net Income (EUR Mil) OCF (EUR Mil)


As we can see from Celsius’s financials, the company 
has been operating at a loss consistently from both a 
cash and non-cash perspective up until Q1 of 2019. 


Similarly, Func Food has almost consistently been 
operating in negative territory in the same metrics 
(The few abnormally positive columns are due to 
one-time events such as acquisitions or financing 
related).


We therefore find it extremely difficult to believe that 
shortly after the Nordic Acquisition, Celsius could 
“miraculously” become a cash-flow positive, EBITDA 
positive and Net Income positive company while 
maintaining its hyper growth in both US and Europe. 


As we’ve previously demonstrated, the growth in 
revenue the acquisition has brought is only artificial. 
It is merely transferring Func Food’s previous gross 
profits item into Celsius’s revenue line item. The 
underlying economics do not change. In fact, post 
adjustments, we even observe quarter over quarter 
decline. 


Thus we highly doubt the integrity of the company’s 
financials post acquisition. We believe whatever 
benefit the acquisition has brought is short-lived. In 
the long run, the Nordic Acquisition will only hurt 
shareholder value.

Func Foods Acquisition: Our View Is That Nordic Partner 
Acquisition Was a Bailout


So why did the acquisition happen despite its long term negative effect on Celsius? We believe the acquisition 
was nothing more than a bailout of a near-bankruptcy entity that only brings in short term non-organic growth. 


We noticed a few things that stood out on Func Food’s financial statements.


1. Top line clearly was not growing. Both Func Food’s overall revenue and Celsius brands revenue has been stagnant, if 
not declining.
2. The company continues to operate at a loss. Losses are also expanding despite growth slowing down.
3. Ballooning accounts payables ($5.2M USD due to Celsius)
4. Dreaded June 2019 Bond of 38M EUR that has been defaulted

Hence, as the June maturity approaches, Celsius is 
left with two choices, either to let Func Food go into 
bankruptcy and get picked apart by creditors with 
first priority (and say goodbye to the “immediate 
cash for North American product”), or acquire a 
company and merge Func’s margins into the compa-
ny despite Celsius having no business in distribution 
and branding. Management chose the latter, result-
ing in an optically massive bump in European 
revenues (due to transition from wholesale to retail) 


“The company has been in event of default after non payment of bond coupon interest at 26 th March 
2019 Standstill period was agreed with bondholders on 17 th April 2019 which was to enable finalizing  
acquisition negotiations with potential buyer. Acquisition negotiations and standstill period ended 
on 9 th May 2019 “          
                                                                                                                                                         -- Func Food Q1 2019


and the avoidance of losses of accounts receivables. 
This optical growth amounted to over 100% and 
~25% in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 respectively and 
drove the stock price to historical highs with the 
stock appreciating almost 4x to highs. However, after 
adjusting for the acquired margins, real growth is 
likely <30% and negative for Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.

Func Foods Acquisition: Nordic Partner Hint Multi-Level 
Marketing


According to People’s Choice’s introduction, the main 
marketer for Celsius in Sweden and a subsidiary of 
Func Food, they had a non-employee & non-paid 
ambassador system with A-F rankings. This language 


sounds awfully similar to multi-level-marketing to us, 
which is a known tool to stuff sales channels and 
inflate revenues artificially.


“People’s Choice has a sale force comprising of approximately 30 employees together with approximately 
150 brand ambassadors. People’s Choice’s sales force structure includes one head of sales, two key 
account managers and 2 regional managers, who in turn are supported by 21 sales persons which 
together ensure nationwide coverage. “ 


“In addition to the sale force, People’s Choice is supported by a network of approximately 150 ambassa-
dors who take part in the marketing of Celsius. These are not employed by People’s Choice, but assists 
with spreading the brand and inspire other people to follow a healthy and active lifestyle. Each ambas-
sador is categorised on a scale from A-F according to their ability to contribute to the marketing of 
Celsius“ 
         
                                                                                                                                                     -- People’s Choice 2016


Our investigator visited People’s Choice Headquarter 
in Sweden, where we could only identify three 
employees at the company. The office was much too 
small to accommodate 30 employees. We question 
whether this looks like a successful distribution 
company that sells over millions of Euros worth of 
product a year, or a sham middle-man?


Our doubts were further corroborated by similar 
instances found in China, where they were publicly 
accused for multi-level marketing schemes.

Failed Expansion in China Accused for Multi-Level Market-
ing Scheme


Outside of the “miraculous” newfound growth from 
Northern Europe, Celsius’s international growth 
trajectory has been rather disappointing. Previously, 
Celsius had high hopes for international growth in 
China. But the China expansion did not work out as 
envisioned. 


Celsius made their first order to China in Q3 2013 and 
entered a partnership with Qifeng Food Technology 
for China distribution in 2017. Similar to their 
attitude towards their Nordic Partner, management 
also presented a wonderful picture regarding the 
Chinese sector. 


“we recently announced our partnership with Qifeng Food Technology, an international wholesale 
distributor of food and beverages founded by former Pepsi, Nestlé and Red Bull executives to distribute 
CELSIUS in China through their nationwide distribution network, commencing in the back half of 2017. 
Through this partnership, CELSIUS will be available for distribution through a network of over 500 
distributors. Qifeng's network of distributors, national experience, proven ability to execute will provide us 
a strong partner to maximize our exposure and speed to market”.


“we look forward to much success in China with our partner Qifeng Foods, who has a distribution 
network of distributors who are proven, experienced team members with an in-depth knowledge of 
launching and growing brands in the China marketplace.”
          --- CC 2017 Q2


However, after nominal sales and no profitability, the 
business was sold in Jan 2019 to Qifeng Food. The 
stated sales price of Celsius China business was 
$6.9m of royalties over the next three five and 
additional royalties on the backend. Additionally, 
Qifeng Food took on a $12.5m unsecured note due 
to of Celsius, so that Celsius can recoup its capital 
investments in China.


Based on historical performance of the China market 
we see little chances of Celsius recouping their 
Chinese investment.


Worse yet, it was reported that Celsius was operating 
an illegal Multi-Level Marketing scheme in China. 


According to a presentation on Celsius marketing, 
when team leader A develops a subordinate member 
B, A can get RMB 8,000, and then if B develops a 
subordinate member C, B can get RMB 8,000. Addi-
tionally, after B develops a subordinate member C, A 


will get RMB 3,890 from that recruitment on top of 
the RMB 8,000 A obtained when developing member 
B. This clearly has a pyramid scheme aspect to it and 
seems to be more focused on recruitment rather 
than selling the actual product. 


Chinese articles also state that the Celsius marketing 
teams were using social media platforms to conduct 
“brainwashing” type of promotion to recruit WeChat 
business groups and develop distributors.


We note at this point that multi-level-marketing 
seems to be a recurring theme. As we will explain 
later, Celsius’s biggest shareholder has also had 
allegation of illegal multi-level marketing involve-
ment against him.

R E P O R T S


Extremely Unsuitable Auditor Ill-equipped to Identify Red 
Flags


We believe Celsius has engaged an auditor who 
seems ill equipped to spot any wrongdoing. Celsius 
has engaged D’Arelli Pruzansky, P.A. (DPP) since 2015. 
In 2017, the company merged with Assurance 
Dimensions, Inc. (AD). AD has served as Celsius’s 
auditor ever since. 


Out of the 22 companies they audited that we 
could identify, at least 14 public companies reek 
of fraud and/or saw its stock price plummet to 


virtually zero. The track record is so bad that it 
makes us question if this auditor might be specifical-
ly sought out by bad actors. The stock price of most 
of these firms already screams caution, as they 
appear to be highly dilutive towards public share-
hoders. To make matters worse, many complaints 
regarding these companies can be found on Inves-
torshub. We believe the only reason these companies 
are not yet delisted is because their abysmal size 
allowed them to fly under the radar on the OTC 
market. 


In 2019 and 2018, Celsius paid 179,100 and 119,500 in audit fees respectively. Surprisingly, Verus International, 
with a market cap of merely 7M, paid 129,350 and 45,000 in 2019 and 2018 respectively. We believe with AD is 
not only not suitable, but is severely ill-equipped to fully audit Celsius.

R E P O R T S


Concerning History of Key Personnel
The credibility of key management is always a tell-tale sign of the quality of company’s reporting. Unfortunately, 
their present and future business plans were not the only red flags that stood out. We have identified a stagger-
ing number of individuals in both Celsius and its Nordic Partner that hints lack of corporate governance, pyramid 
schemes, multi-level marketing, insider enrichment and aggressive promotional pump and dump - old habits die 
hard and we believe the same tactics are taking place at Celsius.


The Man Behind Celsius - Carl DeSantis
At the very center of Celsius’s control seems to be the 
long-term shareholder Carl DeSantis, who effectively 
controls the company. CD Financial, Charmnew 
Limited, and Grieg International have been funding 
Celsius since its inception and all three entities are 
affiliated with DeSantis.


DeSantis had previously been involved in many 
notorious companies including failed stock promo-
tion schemes iBio and Integrated BioPharma, but 
most concerning to us is Rexall Showcase Interna-


tional, and the way he marketed Cellasene. Similar in 
name and in claim, Cellasene, like Celsius, was 
marketed to make you look and feel your best, 
though in this case it referred to the elimination of 
cellulite. Rexall Sundown faced a lawsuit from the 
FTC with regards to Cellasene, as the FTC reported 
Rexall had no clinical evidence to support their 
claims. These claims included the ability to increase 
metabolic rate and improve circulation, claims we 
find oddly similar to those made by Celsius. 


Rexall Sundown Inc. - Stock Manipulation, Pyramid Scheme & More
Rexall Sundown Inc. was founded by DeSantis in 
1976, operating as a manufacturing of vitamins and 
nutritional supplements. In 2000, Royal Numico N.V. 
acquired the company for close to $2Bil USD. Accord-
ing to an article published on a palm beach local 
newspaper, while DeSantis was at the helm, the 
company created Rexall Showcase International 
(RSI), to market dietary supplements through 
Amway-type independent distributors, including 
doctors who peddled pills to family, friends and 
patients. The article further alleges that RSI is 
engaged in a fraudulent pyramid scheme, in which 
the distributors make money by recruiting new 
distributors rather than selling products to retail 
customers. 


We find this especially worrisome since we see a 
similar pattern with Celsius. Celsius had allegations 
of pyramid scheme like activities against it in China. 
Moreover, language from old documents on their 
Nordic distribution partners suggests that Nordic 
distribution was or is supplemented with multi-level 
marketing activities. 


In 1995, DeSantis hired Stanley Cherelstein, a former 
controller for Phar-Mor, the infamous and notorious 
Billion Dollar fraud, as the Financial Controller for RSI. 
In 2000, Cherlstein was further promoted to CEO and 
President. Phar-Mor was one of the largest frauds in 
American corporate history. The official report of the 
U.S. Federal Court-appointed bankruptcy examiner, 
Jay Alix states that Cherelstein not only knew about 
the PharMor fraud, but participated in the prepara-


tion of fraudulent financial records and personally 
profited from the fraud. At Phamor, Cherelstein and 
his accomplices kept a second set of books to which 
they even assigned the strikingly accurate code 
name ‘cookie.’ Their purpose was to deceive investors 
and defraud them in the magnitude of more than 
one billion dollars.


More disturbingly, DeSantis through RSI distributed 
another dietary supplement product called 
Cellasene, an herbal dietary supplement purported 
to eliminate cellulite. DeSantis marketed Cellasene as 
a product that is clinically proven to eliminate 
cellulite. However, the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) filed a lawsuit against RSI in 2000 for false and 
unsubstantiated and misleading advertisement.  FTC 
further reported that Rexall had no clinical evidence 
to support claims that Cellasene “fights cellulite from 
the inside”. 


We find this alarmingly similar to the claims 
Celsius is making regarding its “Clinically-proven” 
benefits. However, this time around, Celsius was 
more “careful”, yet nonetheless misleading, in their 
advertisement. We will further address this in later 
sections of the report. 


In short, we see the exact same patterns in DeSantis 
previous company Rexall, as we see with Celsius. 
Multi-level-marketing allegations, overexaggerated 
product claims backed by little or biased scientific 
evidence and a culture of fraud.

Concerning History of Key Personnel


Oragenics - Why is Celsius Recruiting from a Failed Bio-Pharma Company?


The Man Behind Celsius - Carl DeSantis


Oragenics is a healthcare company focused on 
developing treatments for oral mucositis and novel 
antibiotics against infectious disease. The company 
was originally established in 1996 in Tampa Florida, 
focusing on the concept of replacement therapy 
called S.Mutans Replacement Therapy. Over the past 
15 years, the company has produced little to no 
revenue due to lack of successful products. Little can 
be found today regarding this particular replace-
ment therapy. Recently, the company has been 


making headlines as they attempt to advance their 
Covid vaccines, in what appears to be another pump 
and dump scheme. 


However, Oragenics’s stock price very much reflects 
the reality of the company, with the stock falling over 
99% from its highs. It appears the only thing the 
company was successful in was diluting shareholders 
into oblivion.

Concerning History of Key Personnel
Nordic Partner Owners Involved in European Investigation
Circumfilia Limited was one of the original owners of 
Func Food. Through our research, we found that 
Circumfilia Limited was registered in Malta and its 
shareholder and director is Andreas Celik, who was a 
former co-owner of People’s Choice AB. Be reminded 
that People’s Choice AB has long been used by 
Celsius to market Celsius products in Sweden of 


Europe. However, according to Offshore Leaks 
Database by The International Consortium of Investi-
gative Journalists (ICIJ), Circumfilia Limited was 
identified in the Paradise Papers investigation. 
According to the introduction of this Paradise Papers 
investigation: 


“As a whole, the Paradise Papers files expose offshore holdings of political leaders and their financiers as 
well as household-name companies that slash taxes through transactions conducted in secret. Financial 
deals of billionaires and celebrities are also revealed in the documents. “ 


Roger Ng, Lessner, Ka-Shing and Simons
Some other key individuals involved in the invest-
ment of Celsius also caught our attention. 


Russell Simmons was one of the earlier investors. He 
invested in the company in April 2015 along with 
Kimora Lee Simmons. Russell is most known as a 
hip-hop producer. He was accused by two women 
for sexual misconduct in 2017. Simmons was actively 
promoting (misleading) customers for Celsius. 
During one exclusive interview with HipHopDX, he 
said “If you drink a Celsius, you lose 100 calories 
without working out.” 


Tim Lessner and Roger Ng, both of whom were 
heavily involved in the Malaysian 1MBD 4candal 


were also significant shareholders of the company. 
Roger Ng was in fact the “managing director for Asia” 
for Celsius until recently. 


According to Sarawak Report, it appears that Celsius 
holdings was embarrassed by their connection to the 
two and removed them from their website. 
However, Kimora Lee Simmons, current wife of 
Leissner and ex-wife of Simmons still has a 5.6% 
stake in the company.

False Advertisement Claims Based on Own “Scientific” 
Studies


Back in 2000, DeSantis’s prior company RSI touted 
the clinically proven benefits of another dietary 
supplement product called Cellasene. However, the 
FTC filed a lawsuit against RSI for false, unsubstanti-
ated and misleading advertisement. In fact, people 
have allegedly died due to the consumption of 
Cellasene. 


A decade later, we believe DeSantis is back at it again 
with Celsius, only this time he played it smart and 
actually went through the trouble of actually 
conducting “Clinical Studies”, which we discovered to 
be self-funded and uncreditworthy.


Self-funded Studies Appear to be Uncreditworthy


Celsius quotes seven “Peer Reviewed Clinical Studies” 
that validates that their product increases metabo-
lism and helps burn fat. However, all of the studies 
were funded by Celsius. Furthermore, five out of 
the seven studies were conducted by researchers 


with a history that invokes little confidence, if any 
history at all. The main researchers include Vincent 
Dalbo, Michael Roberts, Jeffery Stout and Chad 
Kerksick. 


- Vincent Dalbo: Titled as Lead Researcher. However, we discovered that he was actually a graduate student at the time 
of study. He now appears to be measuring the effects of caffeine on the dribbling speed for basketball payers.
- Michael Roberts: Retired shortly after conducting the studies for Celsius (We wonder why)
- Jeffrey Stout: Titled as Secondary Author. His other work includes caffeine’s impact on exercise. Unsurprisingly, 
caffeine improved performance!
- Chad Kerksick: We found him to be arguably the most questionable character. He is listed in two of the research 
papers as “Principal investigator of the study who obtained grant funds for project, supervised data collection and 
analysis, supervised statistical analyses and co-authored the papers”. He has been involved in multiple allegations of data 
tampering and self-participation in his own studies. Furthermore, he was put on leave of absence, and later resigned due 
to accusations of “Using Students As Guinea Pigs, Poking And Bruising Them”


Furthermore, Miami Research Associates was also 
listed on Celsius’s 2018 presentation. However, the 
study was nowhere to be found on their own web-
site. We were only able to locate this study, which 
appears to have included Celsius. No results are 


posted even to today, we wonder why.


Moreover, a study funded by GNC appears to show 
the same result as Celsius, yet with generic “thermo-
genic” ingredients.


“Although six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and 
related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the 
FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed 
on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in 
burning calories or enhancing their metabolism.”

False Advertisement Claims Based on Own “Scientific” 
Studies


Rockstar Lawsuit Accuses False Product Claims
Celsius and its management has had a history of 
misleading buyers with false or exaggerated health 
claims. In addition to DeSantis and his RSI product 
Cellasene, Kimora Leissner, an early investor, incor-
rectly and publicly stated that weight loss can be 


experience without exercise with the consumption 
of Celsius. 


In 2018, the energy drink producer Rockstar laid out 
a series of false product claims against Celsius. 
Highlights of the lawsuit include: 


- CELH has knowingly and willfully made false and misleading advertising claims, and used deceptive business 
practices to gain customers
- CELH marketed their product as “dietary supplements” event though it is just a conventional beverage
- Company claims of its drinks providing “healthy energy” are unsubstantiated
- Even the self-funded studies done by the company can’t hide the fact that their drinks contain only customary 
energy drink ingredients. 


So beneath all the “scientific studies”, what is the ultimate benefit of Celsius? It seems to us that Celsius paid for 
bogus studies to hide the fact that the benefits simply stem from an overdose of caffeine. Celsius is ranked 
amongst the top 5 in popular energy drinks in terms of Caffeine containment. 


 Aggressive Claims Don’t Scale Well
Celsius makes a lot of product claims, stating that it 
“burns body fat” (since updated to include exercise 
as a requirement), enhances metabolism and is 
“negative calorie”. 


While we understand that the beverage industry is 
hyper competitive, this is not a good way to 


generate sales, especially at scale. As the brand attracts more eyes, it also attracts more regulatory scrutiny, and 
the sheer breadth and significance of the claims Celsius presents pose a major risk of investigation and litigation, 
one that investors seem to overlook. In our view it is a risk of particular importance, especially considering the 
history of Celsius’ largest shareholder Carl DeSantis.

Valuation
We believe the company is overvalued even under positive assumptions, and especially given the glaring red 
flags we outlined in this report. The multiple expansion relative to revenue is unreasonable because a lot of the 
growth has come from dubious and unsustainable sources. 


Currently Celsius is trading at BCPVU��� EV/S, whereas multiple comparables in this sector are trading at an 
average of EV/S of 4.6 and median EV/S of 3.3.


After adjusting the revenues post-acquisition of Func Food in Europe, we applied average EV/S, median EV/S and 
20% discount to MNST’s EV/S to calculate our price targets for Celsius.


USD MN Symbol TTM Sales EV EV/S

Under these three scenarios, the target price of Celsius ranges from $4.62 to $����, suggesting a potential 
downside between ����% and 7���%. We believe that our corporate governance discount might be far 
too generous based on the checkered history of DeSantis.

However, just recently, Arcus sold close to 5 million shares in June 2020. DeSantis also sold 700,000 shares in 
August. We believe DeSantis used Arcus sales to mask the fact that he is aggressively dumping shares at the 
current valuation, indicating that he also believes the share price to be too high. 


0n August 20th 2020, six directors and Carl DeSantis again sold an aggregate of 1.3M shares valued at����. 
during a private placement deal to Boyu Capital and a leading global institutional investor�	(*$
.


Shortly after in September 2020, Boyu and other shareholders filed an open-shelf prospectus to resell their 
acquired shares in the 2020 private placement to the market. We believe this reflects poorly, as it indicates that 
insiders lack confidence in the performance of the company and is simply flipping over quickly.

Research report on Celsius Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: CELH)


October 9th 2020


R E P O R T S


In conclusion, in order to justify the company’s current stock price, one would have to believe that Celsius is the 
next Monster Beverage and we can’t wrap our heads around this given what we know. Quite the opposite, we 
believe Celsius and its key insiders exhibit a pattern that shows they are willing to conduct fraudulent activities to 
boost sales and defraud investors. Combine this with an auditor who seems to be utterly unable to detect fraud, 
and you have yourself a perfect set up for a bad awakening when more light is shed on the company.
