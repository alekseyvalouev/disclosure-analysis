Intralinks: Hyping the Cloud

Short Ideas


The magic word "cloud" has been gaining popularity these days -- many companies are
eager to claim that they have something to do with the ‘cloud,’ even though their whole
knowledge of the cloud concept was limited to some natural phenomenon in the sky not
long ago.


Intralinks (IL), which IPOed in August of this year at $13/share, well below the initial $14
- $16/share marketing range, is a good example of cloud hype. Below is a quote from
their most recent S-1 filing, “At our founding in 1996, we introduced cloud-based
collaboration for the debt capital markets industry and, shortly thereafter, extended our
solutions to merger and acquisition transactions.” The phrasing is somewhat confusing:
It sounds as if Intralinks was aware of the ‘cloud’ concept back in 1996, way before
Google (GOOG) was born.


Intralinks is not exactly a newcomer to the public market. It tried twice to go public in
2000 and 2005, respectively. Each time it failed due to a lack of interest. In those old
days, apparently the phrase “on-demand” was the buzzword since their old S-1 did not
use the word ‘cloud’ even once, but ‘on-demand’ 82 times. In the new S-1, however, the
word ‘cloud’ was repeated 32 times and the phrase ‘on-demand’ only 3 times.

Since coming public, Intralinks’ CEO, Andrew Damico, has been actively promoting his
company. He had interviews with Bloomberg and CNBC, spinning the cloud concept and
painting a $9 billion potential market size for the Company. The stock has done quite
well, settling at $20.59 as of the last Friday.  


Well, when a company tries so hard to associate its image with the latest business
craze, expectations tend to rise too fast, and long-term outcomes tend to underachieve
short-term results. My analysis shows that Intralinks may follow this same fate; the
recent meteoric rise in its share price, makes the stock appear grossly overvalued
based on the following points. 


Its business actually competes in a niche market of a size much smaller than the $9
billion suggested by the CEO.


1.


The market is being saturated and Intralinks is relying heavily on its sales force to
push their products and services. 


2.


Intralinks product line is very limited and it is met with intense competition from
existing competitors and new innovative companies. 


3.


After 13 years in business, this Company is still losing money each quarter. The
lackluster business does not deserve the current extraordinary valuation.


4.


Let’s learn Intralinks business first.


In its CEO’s own words from the Bloomberg Interview, “Intralinks helps its corporate
clients exchange critical information in a secure, compliant and orderly fashion.” It
provides solutions for secure file collaboration and exchange, a so-called virtual data
room (“VDR”) service. Its largest customer sector is the financial services industry, in
particular investment banks, which contribute more than half of its revenue. Its clients
typically use VDRs to store, distribute and control access of sensitive information.

Its competitors include a multitude of service providers, including both VDR providers,
such as Merrill Corporation, RR Donnelley & Sons Company (RRD) and Bowne & Co.,
Inc. (BNE), and enterprise software providers, such as EMC Corporation (EMC) and
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). A simple Google search for VDRs returns
a multitude of other competitors vying for what appears to be a relatively commoditized
product. It also expects to encounter increased competition, both domestically and
internationally, from established software companies as well as new competitors such as
Microsoft Corporation and Google, Inc.


Now how big is the market it competes in?


In its 2010 S-1 filing (page 2), the Company claimed that its target market size is $9.3
billion, defined as a combination of content management, team collaborative
applications, search and discovery applications and enterprise portals. This is actually
misleading. The Company has only two products: Intralinks Exchanges and Intralinks
Courier. The former is the VDR product and the latter is secured FTP and email, a
simpler and less value-added product than the VDR. These can be counted towards
content management and team collaborative applications, but nothing close to
enterprise portal, let alone search and discovery applications. The $9 billion market size
claim holds a lot of water.


Gartner recognized Intralinks as the market revenue leader in the teaming and
enterprise social software market with an estimated 22.5% share of the worldwide
market in 2009. This sounds closer to the truth. Back the numbers out, the teaming and
enterprise social software market, in which Intralinks competes in, was $600m plus
global wide.


But even this relatively factorial view was spun for misleading promotion. The following
Bloomberg interview screenshot shows the CEO’s about-face behind a jaw-dropping
subtitle “Intralinks has 22% of the global cloud computing market.” If this were true, you
should not buy Google (GOOG), but Intralinks instead.

Is Intralinks competitive?


Intralinks is not an innovative company. Its product offering remains limited to two
products. Its growth mainly comes from the Company’s effort to sell the products to
customers from industries outside of financial services. The Company’s income
statement shows that over 40% of the revenue was spent on sales and marketing,
which really raised the question for the competitive nature of its business. A good and
mature product sells itself and should not incur so much sales and marketing cost.


From the people who had experience with various VDR products, I heard positive
opinions on Merrill Datasite, but feedback on Intralinks products was much less
enthusiastic. Besides competition from its existing competitors, Intralinks face severe
future threats from new innovators like Dropbox and Box.net. Dropbox, a file sharing
and synchronization service provider with over 4 million users and founded only in 2007
by two MIT students, has superior technology and vibrant culture. I believe that it is only
a matter of time for them to reach into Intralinks’ market since it is their low-hanging fruit.

Nothing is more telling of a company’s reputation than by its own employees’ comments.
Glassdoor.com, a free career community where anyone can find and anonymously
share an inside look at jobs and companies, helped us to have a peek into those
opinions. Based on the ratings, the employees are “dissatisfied.” The CEO has a low
approval rate of 38%. You may believe that employees would be happier now that the
Company has gone public -- Wrong. Seven current or past employees commented
about this company since its IPO in August, and nearly all of them had low opinions.
The comments generally reflected frequent reorganizations, high turnover, low morale,
and no long-term product roadmap.


A current sales employee who gave the best rating among the commentators said,
“Stop turning over the workforce- there is only so many times you can rearrange sales
people and territories before it blows up.”


A past employee commented, “Wake up. Who's in charge? Where is the company
going? IPO... are you kidding who cares about a 1 trick pony SaaS company.”


A current sales person in Germany this month opined, “No long-term product roadmap /
vision. No structure and strategy.”


The company is losing money every quarter.


In the interviews the CEO had with the media, he seemed most proud that the Company
had been around for 13 years. One thing he never bothered mentioning was that the
Company was losing money for all those years. Intralinks had $143m revenues in 2008
and lost $40m before tax benefits. In 2009, it had $141m revenue and again lost $43m
before tax benefits. In the most recent quarter ended September 2010, Intralinks lost
$7.5m before tax benefits. It had adjusted EBITDA $16m, but spent $19m on capital
expenditures and capitalized software, leading to negative $3m of free cash flow.


The Company has an unsustainable valuation.

Intralinks valuation is extraordinarily high compared to its anemic growth. With 50 million
shares outstanding, the current share price gives it a whopping $1 billion market
capitalization. Its long-term debt stands at $160 million, making the enterprise value
$1.16 billion. Its book value is $248m, and tangible book value negative $142m. Price /
Book Value = 4x. Its current running rate annual revenue is $176m, making EV/LTM
Sales 6.6x, and EV/ LTM EBITDA = 22x, assuming EBITDA margin of 30%.


Now let’s look at its growth. Intralinks had negative revenues and net income growth
from 2008 to 2009. For the first 9 months of 2010, revenue increased from $101m to
$132m, a 30% growth, and adjusted EBITDA grew from $35m to $41m, a 17% growth.
Even if we do not normalize the 2010 growth and believe that it will continue, this
EV/EBITDA still looks too pricey.


A quick comparison of Intralinks with its domestic peers in security software business
using Finviz.com shows that Intralinks is expensive. It has the highest Price / Sales,
Price / Cash and Price / Free Cash Flow and the second highest Price /Book Value. It
has no Price / Earnings to compare with since it has negative earnings.

Disclosure: Author long GOOG and short IL


Going forward the Company is forecasting anemic growth on a sequential quarterly
basis. Revenue for Q4 2010 is forecasted to be in a range of $48 - $50m. We note that
this is only a maximum of $2m in quarterly revenue growth from the previous quarter.
Likewise, next quarter’s non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in a range of
$17 - $19m, up from $16.3m last quarter. This hardly paints the picture of a rapidly
growing company, yet with the stock price up 80% since the beginning of September, it
appears investors are overestimating the Company’s growth prospects. Unless, of
course, the Company is gaming the system and manufacturing easy projections with
such a narrow forecast range, then I could be wrong. This would allow the Company to
“beat” Street estimates, and continue to proclaim how well they are doing.


Insiders want to sell.


Last Friday, the Company announced that, merely 3 months after its IPO, it was going to
have a follow-on offering for 9 million shares. It is a clear sign to the market reflecting
how the current private equity investors and the management think about the current
stock price level. The original private equity owners are clearly seeking to exit at this
elevated price. Funds managed by TA Associates and Rho Capital own nearly 67% of
the stock and are anticipated to be aggressive sellers at this price level.


Conclusion


Cloud is a sexy word now, but do not let it cloud your judgment. A one-trick pony with a
13-year business history, Intralinks will find its market shares encroached by younger
and more innovative competitors. Intralinks has never made a profit, and may struggle
to do so unless it aggressively reduces its operating cost structure. Since most
operating costs are sales and marketing, Intralinks may sacrifice long-term
competitiveness and growth for near term profitability to meet the Street’s increasingly
elevated expectations. The Company’s profitability is also handicapped by the high
amount of debt on the balance sheet ($158m as of Sept 30, 2010) and its limited free
cash flow. Its current stock price reflects unrealistic optimism for the Company’s future
growth prospects as a player in “cloud” computing. I will not be surprised if in due time
Intralinks’ stock price drops far below $13, its IPO price. Insiders may well be thinking
similarly, and taking advantage of today’s generous stock price level above $20 to
unload in a secondary offering.
