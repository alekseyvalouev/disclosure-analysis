After publishing this series, I have been contacted by several former Plus500 customers who believe
they were defrauded by the company. One individual in the Netherlands shared a long and extensively
documented complaint, which was submitted to the FCA and the Financial Ombudsman in April.


The current AML-related inquiry by the FCA is unlikely to be an isolated event. In light of the
company’s actions toward its customers, I strongly suspect that the additional scrutiny stems from
multiple such customer complaints.


When a gambler visits a casino, the gambler gambles with the knowledge that the house has an edge.
When a novice trader trades with Plus500, the trader knows the odds do not favor long-term success
at highly leveraged CFD trading. However, the trader expects that the platform is organized in a way
that is fair and objective, and that prices will accurately reflect developments in the underlying
securities. A review of customer complaints suggest several ways in which this may not be the case.


In this post, I’ll use a case study of complaints from a single Dutch affiliate forum to set out a few ways
in which it appears the company has crossed the line. Thank you to MM for translation assistance. The
forum in question is hosted by affiliates of Plus500 and offers Netherlands-based customers of
Plus500 a Dutch-language venue to discuss their experience.


Note that many customer complaints are by novice traders. They sometimes mix legitimate concerns
with misunderstandings of typical financial contract terms. That does not change the basic facts of
their complaints. Suitability considerations and regulatory requirements generally place the burden for
properly documenting the terms and conditions of a trading platform on the company, not its users.


I’m sure affiliates will explain away some behavior documented below as being part of industry norms,
but the argument is not that Plus500 is necessarily the worst offender among all platforms. Being
mostly fair, or fair to most users, is not sufficient. If Plus500 has in fact manipulated its platform to the
disadvantage of some users, there will be significant consequences. At a minimum, Plus500 takes
advantage of inexperienced traders. If the customer complaints are accurate, it also cheats
them.


1. Arbitrary expiry procedures 
Customers note that Plus500 sets arbitrary expiration dates for contracts that do not match the
underlying instruments and are not always clearly communicated or adhered to. Expiry terms are
not well-documented, and Plus500 sometimes expires existing contracts early, without prior
notice. Contract expiry typically occurs on a weekend at the last Plus500 quoted price on Friday
(not necessarily the relevant underlying price)—this is how Plus500 records profits on Saturdays.
Plus500 retains sole discretion to roll contracts to the next expiry. Customers opening positions in
a new contract do not have transparency into which futures series is used to determine opening
prices. 
 
Trader Rokil complains about an unannounced early expiration in Coffee, resulting in a
loss. Trader Fredkroket says this happened to him in Bitcoin as well.

Trader Snarf complains about an expiry date unexpectedly set one week before the expiry date of
the underlying front-month contract at CME. Administrator Armijn admits he also missed an expiry
date once and lost money because it was written in fine print on the second page of an
instrument. Trader Navras replies with the same experience. 
Plus500 retroactively changed the expiry date of an outstanding Bitcoin contract, resulting in a
loss for Trader Peacock. Trader Linda mentions a similar experience with Facebook. She claims
her trade history on that instrument was erased.


 
Trader Freedom Capital on an English-language website describes how a Bitcoin contract with a
November 30, 2013 expiration date was closed in mid-November and replaced with a daily
expiration (with higher costs) without notice.  


2. Inopportune cancellation of withdrawals 
A basic principle of dealer-model CFD brokerage is that customers cannot owe the brokerage
more money than they have on deposit. However, because Plus500 takes a long time to process
withdrawals, it sometimes uses the delay to its advantage. Customers have reported withdrawn
amounts, which were already debited from their Plus500 accounts but had not yet been
transferred, being cancelled and returned without warning, placing the funds at risk to cover open
positions. Other customers have reported suspicious timing of rejected withdrawal requests,
despite proper documentation, that occurred within minutes of new positions being opened.


 
Trader Thomasson reports funds he had already withdrawn were returned to his account to cover
a margin deficit. The withdrawal was still ‘pending’ but had already been debited from the account
for several days when he went below margin. Plus500 used the withdrawn funds to cover the
margin deficit, but this amount was insufficient so the positions were closed at a total loss of both
the withdrawn amounts and other monies on deposit.


3. Difficulty closing positions 
Several users have reported unexplained, system errors that prevent positions from being closed
while in a profit position. In other instances, profitable positions remain open and exposed to
market risk because Plus500 chooses not to make quotes available on the platform at its
discretion.


Trader GBG could not close a USDRUB position at a profit one hour before the stated closing
time of the market. He tried unsuccessfully for an hour, the market closed, and the next day his
position changed to a loss and could once again be traded. Plus500 support responded that the
ruble was unavailable for trade due to ‘low trading volume’ despite external trades taking place in
the underlying. GBG has complained to the FCA and changed brokers.


Trader Verlangen complained that he could not close his position at a profit; the close button did
not work. After his trade entered a loss position, he could close it again.

4. Miscellaneous platform inconsistencies and policies 
Traders cite a variety of arbitrary rules and actions by the company that work to their detriment,
including closed accounts, price divergence from the underlying, and different withdrawal limits
for different users. Some traders claim prices quoted on Plus500 demonstrate higher volatility
than the evolution of the underlying, resulting in additional losses for leveraged traders. As
discussed in Part 8, traders worry about the definition of “scalping” in the User Agreement. While
Plus500 appears to ultimately resolve scalping complaints in favor of the users who push back
(after several months, in the case of two different Singaporean users), how many more
inexperienced traders simply go along with it when they are told that their profits are illegitimate?


 
Trader Linda concludes that with a definition like “a systematic trading strategy” Plus500 can call
just about anything scalping. Plus500 support is quoted: “Please note that scalping has no
specific time definition. A trader is considers as scalper when using a systematic trading strategy
of holding short-term positions. Please be aware that when examining a scalper we look at the
overall trading activities, rather that just on a certain position.”


 
Discussion about scalping; traders worrying if trades under ten minutes are considered
scalping.Trader Ikbener somehow managed to open two accounts and made EUR 4,500 from his
sign-on bonus. The profitable account was closed, and he was not allowed to collect the profit. 
Trader Johanserv complains about inexplicable differences between quotes at Plus500 and on
other financial sites.


 
Trader Pokemon asks about the minimum amount of money he can withdraw. Administrator
Armijn and Linda figure out that it is different for all users. For the administrator himself, the
minimum has increased over time; he speculates that it might reflect higher bank costs. Trader
Linda concludes that it is completely unclear how and why Plus500 determines the minimum
withdrawal sum for various users.


 
Trader Vijo complains that Plus500 closed his account after two years of trading, without
announcement or reason, and made a new one for him while not transferring all of the money or
positions on his old account. Plus500 support stated that his new account was reopened at
Plus500′s Cyprus subsidiary, Plus500CY. The miscalculation of money in the old account was
never fully explained.


The message to Trader Vijo from Plus500 support, dated February 23, 2015, confirms that
Plus500 has been transferring UK-regulated client accounts to Cyprus, as reported on
LeapRate and Business Insider last week. Trader Vijo’s experience confirms that Plus500 has been
attempting a regulatory arbitrage for months before the recent voluntary action. Why would Plus500

transfer EU clients to Cyprus while under investigation by the FCA? This action strongly suggests the
company is trying to take advantage of the EU passporting mechanism from a jurisdiction with less
stringent oversight. Full email reproduced from the thread below:


Hello, 


We reviewed your account and would like to inform you That as you already agreed by accepting the
New User Agreement, due to a regulation change – from The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to the
Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, your old account was closed on 02.16.2015 and the
balance of (€ -157.67) was Transferred to a new account with the same email address, but under the
new regulation. 


You can still have access to your previous account under the email: old_mail@emailadres.nl and your
old password, for information and taxation Purposes, for 30 days after the opening of your new
account. After That period the old account (old_mail@emailadres.nl) will be closed and you will be
trading into account: mail@emailadres.nl. 


This change did not have any effect on your account’s trading only the change in e-mail. 


Your current account is exactly the same as the old one, simply under a different regulation.

Erikka  
Customer Support  
Plus500 CY Ltd

3042 Limassol


In addition to the above individual experiences, the customer complaint to the FCA documented an
extensive list of ways in which the Plus500 User Agreement is inconsistent with Dutch Law and the
UK’s Unfair Contract Terms Act. It also highlighted numerous ways in which the trading platform is
risk-enhancing and unsuitable for novice traders. Minimum order sizes and thresholds are in some
cases larger than the tick size of the underlying instrument. Default order sizes are very high relative to
customer account balances. Plus500 also upgrades most users to a “Gold account” after a short
period of activity, setting the default order size and leverage limit to a much higher level.


I am not an attorney, but I have four theories of how legal liability could attach to Plus500 as a result of
these and other actions, some of which were referenced in Part 9. While customers have been
contacting journalists, short sellers, and the FCA, they really should be in touch with a competent
multi-national law firm. The allegations just among Dutch customers alone appear sufficient to support
a class action suit. This is a situation where a determined prosecutor or advocate could make a real
difference for customers who have lost money unfairly.


1. Class action complaint by customers: I recognize that the United States is a much more
litigious society than Europe. Here, there would already have been multiple shareholder

derivative actions based on all the things people were upset about at the AGM. However, the
allegations documented above are serious and warrant investigation. If a court determined that
Plus500 acted abusively, restitution and punitive damages could be significant.


2. Foreign regulatory fines and claims: Plus500 operates without a license in many parts of the
world, as detailed in Part 11. Any customer losses attributable to the platform are in theory null
and void, as the company operated without authorization and could not enforce its user
agreement. While it might be difficult or impossible for a foreign regulator or court to enforce a
judgement upon Plus500, the risk remains. Plus500 operates using currencies and the
international banking system in ways that may bring it into the regulatory net of other countries,
including the US.


3. Local marketing violations: Plus500 notes in the Admission Document that its affiliates may run
afoul of local securities marketing requirements. It does not note explicitly that it accepts affiliate
marketers located in jurisdictions where it is not authorized to operate, including the United
States. Affiliates who receive revenue sharing arrangements are in effect participating in a multi-
level marketing scheme and receiving up to 30% of the turnover of an unlicensed broker-dealer.
The US SEC and Department of Justice are not likely to look kindly upon US persons profiting
from the operations of a foreign securities firm that is not authorized to operate in the US, while
using US means of commerce to promote that entity. Local authorities have been notified.


4. UK or Cyprus regulatory fines or loss of registration: So far, the FCA has not shown itself to
be particularly punitive. At the AGM, Plus500 said there was no evidence that the FCA will issue
a fine for Plus500′s AML procedures. However, if the allegations by customers are true, there
may be meaningful consequences for other behavior.


With that, I will reiterate the question I raised in Part 10: Would you do business with Plus500?

Today my position in plus500 was forcefully closed due to a margin call. I suffered 2000 euro


loss. I had a cfd on the stock of under armour (UA) (class a) which was being traded at 31


dollars. on 7 december 2016, the under armour changed ticker on the NYSE. Class a shares became UAA,


while class c shares, which were being traded at 25 dollars, became the new UA. Instead of adapting this


change in their system, plus500 just changed the rate for existing positions, creating a 25%+ loss… I have


written several times to plus500, but they are not willing to provide me compensation or reopen my positions. 


This is a clear breach of contract (cfd) as i had a contract on class a shares, while they suddenly changed it to


class b shares. 2 totally different instruments. It is the same as if you would buy stock of apple and find out that


you ofn facebook instead. 


what should i do? Can i start a legal action? I live in holland, do i need a dutch, a british or a cyprian


court/lawyer?
