Why I Just Made Montage Technology Group My Largest Short
Position

This morning's announcement by Montage Technology Group (NASDAQ:MONT) that it is
being acquired, and the resulting run-up in its stock, has made this one of the best shorts
I've ever seen, so I added to my position this morning.


I first shorted Montage late last year in the high teens when I concluded that a majority of
its sales were either fictional or illegal - and I'm even more certain of it today - for reasons
that have been well covered by the excellent reports by ARISTIDES CAPITAL and Gravity
Research on this site and elsewhere.


Then in March of this year, Montage announced that a non-binding proposal to acquire the
company for $21.50 in cash was made by "Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology
Investment Co., Ltd. ("PDSTI"), a wholly state-owned limited liability company directly
under Pudong New Area government of Shanghai."


The stock traded up to almost the bid and I figured PDSTI would soon figure out the truth
about Montage and walk, so I didn't cover my short position.


Then, this morning Montage issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a
"definitive merger agreement under which PDSTI will acquire all of the outstanding
Ordinary Shares of Montage for US$22.60 per Ordinary Share."


In light of this, am I wrong in my conclusion about Montage? I don't think so. In fact, after
reading Aristides Capital's latest report, which coincidentally was also released this
morning, I'm more certain than ever.


But then why is PDSTI going through with the deal? Of course they've read the Gravity
and Aristides reports, so are they really that clueless? I think not. Rather, my best guess is
that this is a well-orchestrated scam to defraud the government of Shanghai, which is the
sole investor in PDSTI. It's really pretty simple: the guys running PDSTI are conspiring
with the guys running Montage to pay $693 million for a company that's maybe worth $100
million - and then they share the excess proceeds of $593 million among themselves and
the shareholders. I can't prove this of course - it's only speculation, but it's what makes the
most sense to me. If you think this sounds far-fetched, you don't know China very well.
Using government money to vastly overpay for acquisitions is a very common scam.
