-------------------


We hold a short posi�on in YETI Holdings (NASDAQ: YETI).


Wall Street’s ability to cra� a narra�ve to sell overpriced stock to investors is as old as the stock market itself.  YETI is


unanimously recommended by Sell Side analysts who tout YETI as a powerful brand with significant growth poten�al. 


But these rosy projec�ons, in our opinion, ignore the fundamental reality of YETI’s business. Our findings include:


·         YETI’s Controlling Investor Has Been A�emp�ng to Exit for Years.  YETI was saddled with a large debt load to


pay private investors a $451 million dividend before a 2016 IPO a�empt that was later aborted when sales


began to decline. We calculate that one publicly traded Business Development Company valued their YETI


shares at a mere $4.94 per share as recently as June 2018. But the combina�on of exuberant markets and Wall


Street promo�on finally allowed YETI’s private equity backers to cash out to the tune of approximately $229


million in a JOBS Act IPO (which requires less disclosure) completed in October.   


·         YETI’s Brand is S�ll Struggling to Regain its Popularity. Although Sell Side analysts tout YETI’s brand strength,


evidence suggests that consumer excitement about YETI products has faded since reaching a peak in 2016.

Missteps by management have also recently alienated core customers.  


·         YETI Faces Increased Compe��on and Product Satura�on.  With limited barriers to entry, numerous


compe�tors and retailers have saturated the market with product alterna�ves to the company’s expensive


coolers and stainless-steel mugs.  Commentary from publicly traded companies in the industry signal problems


for YETI moving forward, while compe��ve products such as HydroFlask have gained market share at YETI’s


expense


·         Claims of YETI’s “White Space” Growth Poten�al Ring Hollow.  Although Sell Side analysts project straight line


double growth poten�al well into the future, YETI’s purportedly “innova�ve” new products are in


commodi�zed categories such as dog bowls, wine tumblers, backpacks, duffel bags, chairs, blankets, and


bo�le openers. We also are not sanguine about YETI’s foray into opening retail stores or its prospects in


Europe or China.  


Investors who bought into the hype surrounding recent IPOs such as Go-Pro (GPRO), FitBit (FITB) and Blue Apron


(APRN), have been le� with massive losses.  At a valua�on of 2.5x EV/Sales, we see similar risk embedded in YETI


shares. Especially with roughly $400 Million in debt and aggressive spending plans, which leave YETI li�le room to


navigate should fundamentals deteriorate.   


While we are skep�cal about YETI long term, we believe this is a par�cularly �mely and a�rac�ve short because YETI’s


trading pa�erns suggest the stock price has likely been supported by underwriters exercising their GreenShoe op�on


(which allows them to purchase 2.4 million shares in the open market to stabilize the price).   But now that the 30-day


GreenShoe period has expired, the underwriters are no longer able to support the stock price in this manner.


Furthermore, only around 19% of YETI’s shares are freely tradeable, leaving approximately 65 million shares becoming


eligible for sale some�me a�er the lockup expires this coming April.   


---


YETI’s controlling investor, private equity firm Cortec Group, appears to have been eager to exit its YETI investment for


the last several years.  First, YETI took on $490 million in debt during 2016 to pay a $451 million special dividend in May


2016, of which Cortec received $312 million in proceeds.   Then near the peak of consumer excitement for the


company’s products, Cortec a�empted to sell YETI shares through an IPO originally filed in July 2016. YETI was


reportedly seeking a he�y $5 Billion valua�on that would have yielded Cortec a 50x return on its 2012 investment.  But


the IPO was later aborted “due to market condi�ons”, which the sell side has spun as a purportedly “prudent and


tac�cal decision”.  The company’s investor rela�ons has subsequently explained that a large customer cancelled an


order and, according to a former employee, the failed IPO caused unrest among senior YETI lieutenants, leading to


elevated employee turnover.  Although Sell Side analysts tout purported opera�onal improvements in finance, IT, and


logis�cs made since 2016, we note that YETI’s S-1 specifically discloses material weaknesses rela�ng to IT and inventory


valua�on. 


A�er YETI’s sales declined 22% in 2017, YETI capitalized on exuberant markets to come public at a $1.6 Billion valua�on


this October. But YETI’s IPO s�ll didn’t come easy.  The IPO priced at $18 per share, below the original range of $19-21,

and YETI also had to downsize the offering, selling 16 million shares versus the 20 million expected.  The IPO primarily


benefited Cortec and insiders, who received 87.5% of the proceeds, with only $45 million going to the company, which


also had to eat $16.6 million in IPO expenses. 


The fact that investment bankers found enough investors willing to purchase YETI shares anywhere near the IPO price,


in our opinion, is a credit to the promo�onal power of Wall Street’s sales machine. Months prior to the IPO, we


calculate that Oaktree Specialty Lending Corpora�on (NASDAQ: OCSL, which prior to 2017 was named Fi�h Street


Finance and run by different management), valued its YETI shares at only $4.94 per split-adjusted share or 73% less


than the IPO price.  OCSL originally acquired YETI common shares in conjunc�on with its 2012 financing of Cortec’s


acquisi�on.  We calculate that OCSL’s fair value of YETI peaked at $29.56 per share in late 2016 but declined


throughout 2017, according to it SEC filings.  OCSL even sold 1 million of its YETI shares in the March 2018 quarter at


the $4.94 price.

states


YETI was founded by two brothers a decade ago selling high end coolers to hunters and fisherman that retail for as


much as $1,300 each. A�er first gaining trac�on in America’s South East as a niche supplier to serious outdoor


enthusiasts, the brand began to a�ract a much broader following as a luxury some fans call the “Redneck Rolex”. Sales


caught fire during 2015 and 2016 as a mass market phenomenon that went viral amongst boaters, beachgoers,


tailgaters, and millennials, including an Instagram trend of bikini-clad women posing on top of YETI coolers. YETI made


its way into country music lexicon while its stainless-steel mugs and cups became a popular holiday gi�.

Sell Side analysts tout the strength of YETI’s brand which they claim is gaining popularity. But evidence suggests that


consumer excitement about YETI products has faded since 2016 and the brand is s�ll struggling to regain its prior


popularity.  A�er YETI’ sales grew 74% in 2016, they declined sharply in 2017. YETI’s S-1 explains that retailers and


distributors “overbought” in 2016 and when demand failed to materialize in 2017, unsold goods backed up in the


channel.  Although sales grew 34% during the first six months of 2018, YETI’s preliminary Q3 sales show growth


decelerated to 7% in the quarter. In November 2017, an execu�ve from outdoor products manufacturer Vista Outdoor


(NYSE: VSTO) specifically named YETI as part of a “stainless steel bubble” that “really cooled off” and “is largely behind


us”:


“The only part we've really been disappointed in CamelBak is we missed the stainless steel bubble, which


really occurred in that certain companies like YETI and Hydro Flask and others managed to take advantage of,


that for a variety reasons, we don't have �me to go into here, we really missed that bubble.”


“That part of the market has really cooled off, so there was an opportunity there we missed. But that bubble


is largely behind us. We do have stainless offerings out there, and we are ge�ng a fair share of the market, but


we missed the real excitement, where tumblers were selling for $45 and $50 apiece. We missed that peak


part of the market.”


– Stephen Nolan, CFO VSTO conference presenta�on, November 30, 2017:


Sell Side analysts roll out a variety of sta�s�cs lacking context to suggest YETI’s brand has strengthened. But Google


Trends data, which shows consumer search ac�vity over �me, indicates that overall consumer interest has waned


significantly since reaching a peak in 2016. For example, the search term “ye� coolers” is down substan�ally from prior


levels.  Consumer search interest for other YETI products including “YETI Mugs”, “YETI Tumblers”, and “YETI Rambler”


have also failed to recapture their 2016 highs.

The Sell Side also claims that “YETI is revered among its core outdoor enthusiast customers”. But this ignores recent


missteps by management that appear to have recently alienated many of these core customers.  In April 2018, the


Na�onal Rifle Associa�on sent out an email to members aler�ng them that YETI had abruptly cut �es with it (which


YETI describes as a misunderstanding). This triggered calls for boyco�s and led some previously loyal customers to


blow up their YETI coolers in YouTube videos.

In February 2018, YETI moved to cut �es with hundreds of small specialty distributors and retailers.  An industry ar�cle


ques�oned if YETI was “abandoning specialty retailers who gave foo�ng to the brand’s success”.  One business owner


opined that YETI is “leaving the core competence of the business that got them to the dance”.  Another said that a�er


receiving a termina�on le�er from YETI, he “thought it was funny” because “his store stocked YETI when they first


started out, but stopped selling the brand when sales decreased”.  He explained that “YETI was a specialty brand, then


it was suddenly in the hardware store and pharmacy down the block…you open up to everybody in the world and you


go from premium to not so premium”.

Sell Side analysts also seem to ignore the reality that a�er YETI’s ini�al successes, the market has become increasingly


compe��ve and extremely saturated with alterna�ves to YETI’s products.   YETI has limited barriers to entry and


established cooler manufacturers such as Coleman and Igloo have rolled out new models with similar features at lower


prices.  YETI also faces direct compe��on from new rivals such as RTIC and Orca, which have taken market share by


rolling out similar product por�olios. Private label alterna�ves such as KODI Coolers replicate YETI coolers (see here,


here). Anecdotal evidence, including this “Ice Challenge” posted by a consumer on YouTube, suggests YETI performs no


be�er than cheaper coolers made by compe�tors (Below).

Meanwhile in drinkware, mass-market retailers including Walmart and Costco are selling stainless steel subs�tutes of


YETI Ramblers at significant discount.  A Sportsman’s Warehouse execu�ve stated in 2017 that GoPro and Ye� “were


very strong year one type products” but “there’s been a lot of knock-offs to both of those companies since then”.

High quality alterna�ves such as the Hydro Flask have recently gained significant popularity and taken market share at


YETI’s expense.  As shown below, Google search ac�vity for “YETI Rambler” peaked in 2016, and consumer interest in


Hydro Flask now far surpasses it:

Sell Side analysts also claim that YETI’s margins will expand significantly over the coming years.  But the parade of


compe��on creates pressures for YETI to cut prices to induce sales and compete with lower priced compe��on.


Unsurprisingly, YETI cut prices and provided discounts on certain products in June 2018.  We believe this trend is likely


to exacerbate the pressures on YETI’s gross margins over �me, which have already fallen to 46% from 50% in 2016. 


Another reason we are skep�cal of YETI’s ability to sustain the kind of sales growth bulls an�cipate is because the


business has limited amounts of recurring revenue.  YETI coolers are well-made and long las�ng, which means that


customers who have already purchased an expensive YETI cooler strike us as being unlikely to buy another one from


the company. This means that YETI must con�nuously a�ract new customers to grow sales, which is especially difficult


in light of the challenges facing the brand.  YETI is also vulnerable to an economic downturn, as consumers could easily


cut discre�onary spending on expensive coolers and mugs without blinking an eye.


Hibbet Sports (NASDAQ: HIBB), a spor�ng goods chain in YETI’s core market of the southeastern United States, signaled


problems for YETI in a May 2018 conference call with investors.  Sales of YETI goods had previously boosted Hibbet’s


sales last year, but management confirmed that sales of YETI goods have slowed significantly this year and “it’s been an


impact for us, certainly”:

redowlresearch.blogspot.com/2018/11/yeti-wall-streets-latest-over-hyped-ipo.html 11/14


The Sell Side touts “white space” growth from new products, with one analyst claiming that “through excep�onal


innova�on, YETI creates its own markets versus simply entering exis�ng markets”. But YETI’s new products are in


product categories such as dog bowls, wine tumblers, backpacks, duffel bags, chairs, blankets, and bo�le openers.  Are


investors really supposed to believe that YETI is “crea�ng new markets” with these kinds of commodi�zed goods in


crowded categories?


We also are not sanguine about management’s plans to spend at least $35 million in capital expenditures next year to


increase staff and finance projects including the opening of YETI branded retail stores, bringing the company into


another difficult arena.  YETI also vaguely refers to expansion into China and Europe, but the no�on that foreign


consumers will purchase expensive coolers that went viral amongst millennials in America’s South East several years


ago strikes us as fanciful, at best.  


Conclusion


Wall Street’s promo�on of YETI reminds us of previous IPOs such as GoPro, FitBit, and Blue Apron.  In each of these


cases, investors were sold shares based on hype that failed to materialize.  


At 2.5x Enterprise Value / Sales, we see similar risks embedded in YETI’s valua�on. Especially with $400 Million in debt


and aggressive spending plans, which leaves YETI li�le room to navigate should fundamentals deteriorate.   Even if


growth comes in be�er than we expect, YETI will have to use a substan�al por�on of its cash flow to pay down debt for


years to come. This is inherently problema�c for a company a�emp�ng to grow in such a highly compe��ve industry.


While we are skep�cal about YETI long term, we believe this is a par�cularly �mely and a�rac�ve short because YETI’s


stock price has likely been supported by underwriters exercising their GreenShoe op�on (which allows them to


purchase 2.4 million shares in the open market to stabilize the price).  Although the company has not disclosed if


underwriters have exercised their op�ons, Post IPO trading ac�vity involved large bids at fixed prices for extended


periods of �me, which is a trading pa�ern we find sugges�ve of underwriters suppor�ng the stock price (example


below). But now that the 30-day Greenshoe period has expired, the underwriters are no longer able to support the


stock price in this manner.

shares are held by private equity investors, leaving approximately 65 million shares becoming eligible for sale


some�me a�er the lockup expires this coming April.
