A Response To Lumber Liquidators

Summary


In its slide presentation and conference call this morning, Lumber Liquidators said all
the right things - but don't be fooled.


It's telling that management simply read a prepared statement and didn't take any
questions, despite the fact that they have had weeks to prepare.


It's little wonder why Lumber Liquidators is trying to understate its customers' actual
exposure to formaldehyde.


I believe it's a better short today than it was before the 60 Minutes story aired.


Going forward, I'm going to lower my public profile and allocate my time elsewhere.


In its slide presentation and conference call this morning, Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL),
as I expected, said all the right things - but don't be fooled: in reality, it was just a
continuation of the company's campaign of distraction and deception in what I think will
prove to be a vain attempt to mislead customers, investors and regulators.


The accusation against Lumber Liquidators is simple: that in order to save approximately
10% on its sourcing costs, the company has over an extended period purchased in China
and sold to its American customers hundreds of millions of square feet of laminate flooring
that has levels of formaldehyde, a dangerous chemical and known carcinogen, many
times the limit set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) that the company claims
to adhere to - and that the company knew, or should have known, this.


Yesterday, I was 98% confident that Lumber Liquidators was guilty of this charge. After
hearing the company's defense, I'm now 99% confident.


It's telling that, on its conference call, management simply read a prepared statement and
didn't take any questions, despite the fact that they have had weeks to prepare. This is
highly unusual and an insult to investors and analysts. Other companies hosting a
conference call to address criticism typically take a handful of pre-seeded questions from
friendly sell side analysts, so the fact that Lumber Liquidators wouldn't even do this
speaks volumes. As one analyst said: "If you are 100% clean....you shouldn't be afraid to
talk."

It really boils down to a simple question of credibility: whom are you going to believe? 60
Minutes, one of the most long-standing and respected news programs in the world, whose
lawyers no doubt went through every word of the segment with a fine-toothed comb before
it aired, or a company with every reason to lie, a terrible reputation (see here, here, here,
here and here), and Chinese sourcing questions hanging over it that are so credible that
Federal agents raided its headquarters in September 2013, which (as the company
recently disclosed in its 10-K) could result in criminal charges?


Broadly speaking, Lumber Liquidators is making two defenses:


First, the company on its web site claims that "60 Minutes used an improper test method
in its reporting that is not included in California's regulations and does not measure a
product according to how it is actually used by consumers." In reality, it is Lumber
Liquidators that is using improper test methods.


Those interested in the details of this "debate" can read my articles, Lumber Liquidators'
Campaign Of Distraction And Deception and Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing
Doesn't Comply With CARB, and this one: GeoInvesting Concurs With Tilson And 60
Minutes: Our Take On Testing Methods Used For Lumber Liquidators Study.


But for those who don't have the time or interest, just apply common sense and ask
yourself this simple question: if 60 Minutes' testing (all of which is posted here) was
improper, why did the tests show that 30 out of 31 samples of Lumber Liquidators'
Chinese-made laminate had formaldehyde levels averaging 6-7 times the CARB 2 limit,
yet every sample of laminate flooring from Home Depot, Lowe's and even Lumber
Liquidators' own flooring sourced from U.S. mills was below the limit? The answer is
obvious: because 60 Minutes' testing was accurate and valid.


Kip Howlett, the President of HPVA, which operates HPVA Laboratories, a CARB-certified
lab that I hired to test samples of Lumber Liquidators' laminate, commented:


When you have five labs all doing it the same way and getting the same results, it
isn't about the test method. The company either didn't understand the SOP [CARB's
Standard Operating Procedure for labs], or did understand it and did a work-around.
They're either stupid or they're lying - which is it?


Lumber Liquidators' second line of defense (implied by the company and made explicit by
its defenders) is that, even if its laminate has levels of formaldehyde above the CARB
limit, where's the harm?

For starters, read what the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention have to say about formaldehyde: it can cause "watery eyes; burning
sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat; coughing; wheezing; nausea; and skin irritation,"
"upper respiratory tract irritation [that] can potentially exacerbate asthma symptoms and
other respiratory illnesses," "chronic runny nose, chronic bronchitis, and obstructive lung
disease," and is a "known human carcinogen" associated with "several cancers, including
nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia."


But at low levels, serious symptoms are unlikely - so the real question is, what is the
actual, real-world level of formaldehyde Lumber Liquidators is exposing its customers to
via its laminate and what harm might result from this?


The company, not surprisingly, says the level is very low, as shown in slide 16 of its
presentation:


Lumber Liquidators claims that "The emissions from our laminate floors will typically only
add approximately 5 ppb to a home when first installed." If true, this would be good news
since regulators have set 7 ppb as the limit to protect everyone, including children.

But the company's claim flies in the face of the evidence. 60 Minutes (which, again, posted
all of its test results here) hired a lab to test three samples of Lumber Liquidators'
laminate, using the California Department of Public Health home model, which tests how
much formaldehyde a typical homeowner would actually be exposed to. In sharp contrast
to the company's claims, these tests showed the following levels:


Sample 1: ~268 ppb/ .292 ppm OR 329.3 μg/m3
Sample 2: ~93 ppb/.101 ppm OR 113.6 μg/m3
Sample 3: ~57 ppb/0.057ppm OR 69.96 μg/m3


In other words, the actual levels of formaldehyde were 11-54 times the levels claimed by
Lumber Liquidators. Whose tests are you going to believe?


When 60 Minutes showed these results to Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the world's leading
experts on this subject (see his bio here and here), he said (according to the transcript):


Dr. Philip Landrigan: It's not a safe level, it's a level that the US EPA calls polluted
indoor conditions.


Anderson Cooper: Would you want that in your home?


Dr. Philip Landrigan: No.


Dr. Philip Landrigan of N.Y.'s Mt. Sinai Hospital, specializes in environmental
pediatrics and exposure to toxic chemicals. He's talking about the results of another
kind of test Drury and Larson conducted measuring the concentration of
formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical home.


Dr. Philip Landrigan: I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky
because it would increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a
person's lung function, increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce symptoms
in everyone but children will be the people most likely to show symptoms at that sort
of level.


In light of these frightening risks, especially to children, it's little wonder why Lumber
Liquidators is trying to understate its customers' actual exposure to formaldehyde.


Conclusion


It's been quite a battle royal - the bears have had their day/week/month/year and now the
bulls are having their day/week.
