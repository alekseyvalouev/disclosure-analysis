Throw the BABY (Natus Medical Inc.) Out with the Bathwater 























Who is GlassHouse Research? GlassHouse Research (GHR) is made up of former forensic 


accountants/analysts who have worked for prominent hedge funds on Wall Street, as well as 


boutique forensic accounting firms. Our purpose is to expose public companies that have been 


taking advantage of US GAAP as well as IFRS accounting for their benefit. We seek to find 


companies where GAAP (or even worse, non-GAAP) earnings are deviating from true economic 


earnings of the target firm. 


Overall, we search for evidence of a “culture of fraud” within public companies.

Initiation of Natus Medical Inc. (BABY) with a Target Price of $9.80  


(70% downside) 
 


Lowered guidance, impairments, write-offs, restatements and fines from the 


SEC are all on the table as Natus will need to deal with these major accounting 


concerns in 2019.   
 


• Concealed obsolete inventory makes Natus inventory position one of the 


worst we have ever seen. We calculate that at minimum, Natus needs to 


write-off/take losses on approximately $18.0 million (one-fifth of total 


inventory, or 30% of TTM earnings) in obsolete inventory. 





• Natus’ warranty/bad debt reserves and prepaid expenses accounts have all 


been depleted/manipulated over the last year to artificially increase EPS by 


$0.33 (or nearly 25% of TTM earnings). This will reverse violently in 2019. 





• Based on comment letters found from the SEC, the Commission has been 


highly critical of Natus’ use of non-GAAP exclusions in the past. Today, we 


see BABY’s current exclusions as the most aggressive they have ever been. 





• CEO Kennedy and CFO Davies left their past companies in ruins with both 


Intersil and Extreme Network’s stock price falling over 55% each before 


they bailed as CFO to come to Natus Medical.

Key Similarities Between Natus Medical and Logitech’s Fraudulent Activity 


GlassHouse juxtaposes both Natus Medical (BABY) and the past transgressions of the prior 


fraud Logitech International (2011). Based on our research, we believe Natus is in a much worse 


accounting position than Logitech ever was in 2011. The end result for Logitech was not a 


pretty one. Restatements, fines with the SEC, but most importantly the stock price dropped 


over 70% as a result of management’s malfeasance.  


Key Characteristic Logitech International (2011) Natus Medical Inc. 


Business 
Strategy 


A roll-up company that based most of its 


future guidance on sales from acquisitions and 


new product lines.  


A roll-up company that bases most of its future 


guidance on sales from acquisitions and new product 


lines. 


Misstatement 
of Inventory 
Accounting 


Logitech deliberately minimized the write-


down of millions of dollars of excess 


component parts for a product which Logitech 


had excess inventory in FY11. 


We opine that BABY’s current inventory position is 


much worse than Logitech’s in 2011. This is after the 


Natus has already received material weaknesses and 


an adverse opinion from their auditor (KPMG) 


regarding their deficient inventory accounting. 


Violations of 
Accrual 


Accounting 


Logitech paid fines regarding violations related 


to warranty accrual accounting and failure to 


amortize intangibles from an earlier 


acquisition. 


GlassHouse observed highly aggressive accounting 


regarding the firm’s warranty and bad debt reserve. 


Natus recently received a material weakness 


regarding its acquisition accounting in 2017 that has 


yet to be remediated. 


Reduced Sales 
Guidance 


The SEC stated that Logitech mgmt. schemed 
to inflate the company’s operating income 
after experiencing poor sales for their new 


product, Revue, among others product lines. 


Natus has reduced their sales guidance time and 
time again over the last two years as new product 


lines and acquisitions have failed to deliver.  


Motivation  


“Logitech failed to write down the value of its 


inventory to avoid the financial consequences 


of disappointing sales.” - SEC 


Amid an unruly proxy fight with Voce Capital, 


disappointing acquisitions, and lackluster organic 


growth, mgmt. possesses high motivation to 


artificially enhance earnings.  


Correspondence 
with SEC 


From 09/14/2010 onwards, Logitech received 


multiple letters from the SEC challenging the 


firm’s use of critical accounting estimates and 


revenue recognition policies.  


Natus has received several comment letters from the 


SEC and in a very rare comment, the SEC accuses 


Natus of classifying “normal operating expenses” as 


restructuring costs among other concerns. 


End Result 


In 2011 after reducing guidance, restating 


earnings and paying fines for fraud, the stock 


price fell from $20 to a low of $6 (70% drop).

Concealed Non-Current Inventory Makes BABY’s Inventory Diagnostics One of 


the Worst GHR has Ever Seen  
 


Let GlassHouse be perfectly clear that after examining Natus’ current inventory metrics, we find 


the firm’s inventory diagnostics to be one of the worst we have ever seen when analyzing 


public companies. When we dig into BABY’s 10K and 10Q filings, the situation only becomes 


graver as we believe management will need to write-off and take losses on most of their 


obsolete inventory. Exacerbating the issue, it appears that analysts are completely blind to the 


highly growing balance of inventory on the company’s balance sheet as inventories have been 


rarely discussed in recent conference calls. In this regard, we find it peculiar that days-sales-


outstanding (DSO) metrics are disclosed by the CFO every period, but we are befuddled to why 


inventory metrics are rarely discussed. 





Diving into Natus’ inventory metrics, GHR finds a plethora of accounting concerns that all point 


to the fact that BABY is 1) currently stuffing its channel/end user to increase sales and/or 2) 


refusing to write-down their obsolete inventory in order to keep margins artificially healthy. 


Due to the company’s recent proxy fight with Voce Capital, we believe that prior CEO Jim 


Hawkins and now new CEO Jonathan Kennedy possessed high motivation to cosmetically 


increase sales/margins and may have resorted to these accounting gimmicks in order to do so. 


While non-GAAP gross margins have recently hovered around the 60% value over the last two 


years, we believe that this ratio has been highly inflated due to management’s efforts. But 


again, these games can only be played in the short-term and will violently reverse in future 


periods. 





Overall, our research has pointed to BABY’s inventory previously being pushed onto hospitals, 


physician offices, and clinics to the point where they are stuffed with products and are hesitant 


to procure any more inventory. To make matters worse, it appears that management’s 


visibility into future buying trends of its clients were highly inaccurate and now the company 


is stuck with bloated inventory on its shelves and balance sheet; in some cases, the products 


have been discontinued and have become obsolete.  





What does this ultimately mean for Natus with respect to future sustainability of earnings? 


With only unfavorable options on the table for BABY, we believe our inventory analysis puts a 


time catalyst of BABY’s share price decline (within one-to-three quarters). Below we detail 


Natus’ unfavorable recent inventory metrics:
GlassHouse Research 


5 | P a g e  
 





• Natus’ current inventory balance has recently increased by 16.2% YOY to $80.6 million, 


which outpaced sales (cost of revenue) growth of only 6.5% (6.9%) in the Q3 2018 period. 


As a result, 3M days-sales-of-inventory (DSI)1 increased to 139 days as of Q3 2018, which 


stands at a five-year seasonal high and the largest figure reported by BABY since Q3 2011. 


Longer-term metrics report similar results with 12M DSI increasing by 13.3% YOY to 127 


days, again representing a five-year maximum.   





• Natus’ inventory-to-quarterly-sales metric also portrays a harbinger for future margin 


compression as this metric has increased by 516 bps YOY to 61.7% at the end of Q3 2018; a 


new five-year high. Inventory-to-12M-sales follow a similar pattern growing by 93 bps YOY 


to 15.5% in the latest period.  





• Now that we have discussed BABY’s dire inventory predicament, let us highlight an excerpt 


from Natus’ inventory footnotes discussed in its 10K filing: 














                                                           
1 Three-month days of inventory (3M DSI) = Average total inventory QOQ / 3M COGS * 91.25
GlassHouse Research 


6 | P a g e  
 





• Here we can see that management has chosen to classify some of its longer-term (and 


higher risk) inventory as “non-current inventories” under the “Other Asset” balance sheet 


line-item. Now, when we calculate Natus’ already dreadful inventory metrics to include its 


higher risk non-current inventory, their inventory diagnostics become one of the worst in 


the space.  





• Specifically, when including non-current inventories, 3M DSI spikes up to 168 days as of Q3 


2018, which near an all-time high of 170 days. Longer-term metrics are just as bad with 12M 


DSI increasing by 12.6% YOY to 155 days, representing an all-time maximum for BABY (see 


Chart 1, below).   





• Natus’ total inventory-to-quarterly-sales metric also follows suit as this metric has increased 


by 544 bps YOY to 73.4% at the end of Q3 2018; a new five-year high. Total inventory-to-


12M-sales also increased by 95 bps YOY to 18.4% in the latest period.

• In our experience, we cannot remember ever seeing inventory being stored as a long-term 


item even after going through countless SEC filings. Therefore, GlassHouse executed a 


screen to search for the keyword non-current inventories (and other similar monikers such 


as long-term inventories etc.) in the filings of companies classified under “Health Care 


Equipment/Services”.  Our screen that searched through over 965 companies with a 


market cap over $25 million in this industry only found four (or 0.4%) of Health Care 


Equipment/Services companies that classified inventory as long-term/non-current: 





o Natus Medical (BABY), non-current inventory = 16% of total inventory  


o Inogen (INGN, Market Cap $3.10b) = 5% of total inventory  


o Xtant Medical (XTNT, Market Cap $31.7mm) = 1% of total inventory 


o Rockwell Medical (RMTI, Market Cap $173.8mm) = 30.6% of total inventory; 


however, RTMI breaks out its LT inventory separately on its balance sheet.  





• Even worse, we point out that the long-term balance of non-current inventory has been 


skyrocketing in recent years. To illustrate this, we observe that non-current inventories have 


increased by 35.6%, 89.3% and 4.5% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Management 


describes these items as “service components, inventory purchased for lifetime buys, or 


inventory that is turning at a slow rate”. But let us be perfectly clear, these are basically 


the worst type of inventory that stays on the top rack of Natus’ warehouse and 


accumulates dust. Management is concealing what should be these written-down 


inventories under non-current other assets in order to artificially enhance their inventory 


metrics and reported earnings. 
 


• We also find it highly perplexing that a company whose inventory is growing by double-


digits in every period over the last three years has not been asked about its snowballing 


balance dating back to the Q3 2016 earnings call?  





• Can it get even worse for Natus’ inventory? Yes, it can. This is because in every period 


management has decided to transfer some of its inventory into PP&E (this is separate from 


BABY’s non-current inventory stored in “Other Assets” on the balance sheet). Disclosed 


below in the firm’s 2017 10K:
GlassHouse Research 


8 | P a g e  
 





• The accumulation of these transferred inventory equates to $5.5 million over the past five 


years. While this number may appear to be minimal, if we add this figure to the overall 


inventory balance, this equates to a new 3M DSI balance of 178 days, over 10 days added 


to the firm’s DSI balance of 168 days.

Distinct Inventory Metrics Show that Natus’ Current Channel is Stuffed with Products 
 


• When we dig further into Natus’ inventory problems, things continue to get worse and 


worse as we find finished goods has spiked by 34.9% YOY to $61.8 million as of 09/30/18. 


Again, this classification of inventory remain the highest risk as finished goods represent 


products sitting on shelves and are at most risk for obsolescence. Relative to 3M sales, 


finished goods increased by 997 bps to 47.3%, representing a five-year seasonal high. 





• Furthermore, when we analyze the ratio of finished goods and raw materials to total 


inventories, it confirms that Natus is currently carrying a historically higher amount of 


finished goods on its balance sheet. Where BABY once carried 55.1% of its inventory as 


finished goods, this metric jumped 942 bps YOY to its current ratio of 64.5% (see Chart 3, 


below). This represents the highest percentage of finished goods to total inventory in any 


period in the last five years. 





Chart 3: Natus Finished Goods and Raw Materials Relative to Total Inventory 








• What the above Chart reveals to us is that Natus is not purchasing raw materials at an 


accelerated rate in order to sell into heightened demand. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The

company appears to have an extremely weak demand environment for its products and 


they are now gathering dust in their warehouses.  





• Further corroborating this thesis, we can turn to the firm’s accounts payable-to-inventory 


ratio. As of 09/30/18, this ratio currently stands at its lowest value ever recorded at 21.5%. 


This divulges to us that management has been actually decreasing its inventory purchases 


over the last three years (see Chart 4, on Page 11). However, inventory continues to build 


due to depressed sales. Again, these accounting metrics point to massive channel stuffing 


done by management in previous periods in order to achieve short-term gains.  





• Finally, we ask ourselves can Natus be procuring more inventory in order for the launch of 


new products in the upcoming periods? We can answer this with a resounding no as the 


numbers do not lie. Using consensus sales estimates for future periods, we can analyze 


inventory relative to future sales to see if these figures are historically within norms for 


BABY.  





• After performing our analysis, we actually found that metrics were dangerously high for the 


firm. Analysts are predicting low-single-digit growth for Natus over the next year and with 


inventory sitting at all-time highs, there appears to be little future demand to push its 


inventory onto customers. Relative to forward 3M and 6M sales, we find that inventory 


stands at 70.2% and 35.5%, respectively as of 09/30/18. Both the values stand at five-year 


maximums for the firm, thus debunking any future demand for Natus’ current inventory 


levels. 





• As aforementioned, there are only two possible outcomes in this scenario based on our 


experience 1) Natus will attempt to maintain its price points on its products resulting in 


decreased sales and future impairment risk of its inventory and/or 2) the company will need 


to discount its products significantly in order to move inventory and avoid warehousing & 


transporting costs. Even worse with management just discontinuing its Global 


Neurodiagnostics (GND) and NeuroCom balance product lines, this will cause revenues to 


drop by an approximate $19 million in 2019. This leaves more obsolete inventory on the 


books waiting to be written-off as full losses.  





• To quantify the impact that not impairing these inventories has had on earnings, we can 


reverse engineer Natus’ inventory balance using the firm’s five-year DSI average of 133 


days. As a result, we estimate that BABY should have written-off $17.8 million of their 


inventory in the latest year to match a historical balance for the firm. This impact would 


result in a $13.9 million after-tax loss for BABY in the TTM, or $0.42 of EPS.

Channel Stuffing and Failing to Write-Off Obsolete Inventory Will Doom Natus 
 


Our overall thesis revolves around Natus management stuffing its customers with products in 


order to increase sales at a time when there was clearly a weak demand environment. Judging 


from excerpts from prior earnings calls, we can now see that management has overbuilt its 


current inventory position and will now face an ominous future as it will need to unwind its 


slow moving and/or obsolete inventory on its balance sheet.  





As the reader can see from Chart 1 on Page 6, DSIs have been growing in a stair-step fashion 


dating back to 2013. While Voce Capital previously praised newly appointed CEO Jonathan 


Kennedy for securing “low hanging fruit” in order to boost BABY’s share price, we believe the 


opposite may be true. For example, we do not believe it is coincidence that DSI levels have risen 


so sharply coinciding with Mr. Kennedy’s tenure as CFO. As a result, margins may have been 


artificially protected as Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Hawkins stubbornly refused to write-off obsolete 


inventory.  





Furthermore, when analyzing comments made by management in the past year, it is 


apparent that 1) management has zero visibility into its future demand environment based 


on continued missed projections, 2) management is extremely fixated on securing gross 


margins above 60% at all costs, 3) the firm has failed to write-off the correct amount of 


inventory when it has discontinued its products and 4) the amount of inventory being held as 


“ship-hold” in its Seattle warehouse is adding to Natus’ inventory woes.  





We observe this with Mr. Hawkins comments made in the Q4 2017 earnings call: 


 
As we previously reported, revenue in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to 


weakness in our U.S. neurodiagnostic business and lower-than-expected revenues from 


Otometrics…In our neurodiagnostic business, while we were disappointed with the results in 


the fourth quarter, we are encouraged that in 2018, we will receive the orders of customers 


delayed in the fourth quarter. In fact, some of these large orders have already been booked 


in the first quarter. 





However, after this statement we found that Q1 2018 projections where then missed with Mr. 


Hawkins stating in the Q1 2018 earnings call: 


 
While our neurodiagnostic business bounced back nicely in the first quarter, we continue to 


experience longer sales cycles in the United States.
GlassHouse Research 


13 | P a g e  
 


Finally, in the Q2 2018, newly appointed CEO Jonathan Kennedy states: 


 
And so as we've learned more and understand more the requirements there and get used to 


sort of the shift in the purchase cycle, I think that, in and of itself, firms up our ability to 


predict and our ability to meet customers' needs along the way of the selling process to 


include IT. 





And by “get used to sort of the shift in the purchase cycle”, GlassHouse believes that customers 


are not buying products at the rate they did previously. Even worse, when management has 


admitted to “end of life-ing” products, we have seen no apparent writing-off of inventory on 


the income statement or footnotes. Here we disclose an excerpt by Mr. Kennedy in the Q2 


2018 earnings call: 


 
Revenue from our Newborn Care business declined approximately 15% versus the same 


quarter last year. This decline was led by intentional end-of-life decisions for certain 


products that did not have the required scale to remain viable. While we have made 


most of these product liability decisions, you should expect to see marginal downward 


effects on Newborn Care revenue over the next several quarters.  
 


We also find in the Q4 2017 where Mr. Hawkins discussed discontinuing product lines: 


 
We continue to prune smaller products that don't warrant the resources to keep them 


in the market, and we now have a number of new product development projects underway. 





And more statements from Mr. Hawkins on Investor Day – 06/22/17: 


 
Also, there's a $3 million or $4 million worth of product that we have decided not to try 


to remediate. The amount of work the FDA wants us to do for that amount of revenues 


doesn't make sense. So we haven't shipped those products since, I think, August of last year 


and we're basically going to, as we say, throw them in the ocean and not bring those 


back out. It just doesn't make sense. 





We would expect BABY’s inventory balance to somewhat fall as these obsolete inventories 


should have been written-off the books, but the opposite has occurred. This leads us to believe 


that management is incorrectly storing most of this obsolete inventory under “other assets” on 


the balance sheet.  





When researching Natus’ inventory in the wild, we found employees that described Natus’ 


products as “outdated” and “10 to 15 years old.” An employee also felt that Natus’ products 


were of inferior quality in order to “pad the pockets of senior staff and major shareholders.” 


Overall, we suspect BABY’s outsized inventory balance is composed of legacy products that are 


not being sold or will be cannibalized by newer offerings and will inevitably be written off.
GlassHouse Research 


14 | P a g e  
 








Lastly, the company has detailed serious issues regarding their FDA deficiencies in their 


manufacturing processes in their Seattle facility (received in 2014 and 2016). As a result, the 


FDA imposed “ship-holds” on certain products produced there and Natus has discontinued 


certain other products in the facility. Moreover, what was initially believed to be a transitory 


item, has turned into a long drawn out process that the company did not envision. While the 


company has recently completed audits of its Seattle facility in Q3 2018, this does not relieve 


the Warning Letter. Natus goes into detail in its 2017 10K stating:  


 
The company has classified $15.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively, of inventories as 


non-current… This consists of inventory that will be shipped when the ship-hold on the 


NeoBLUE products is released. The company believes that these inventories will be utilized 


for the intended purpose.  





Due to this ship-hold, we believe that a material amount of inventory has sat in Natus’ Seattle 


warehouse left to grow obsolete. And again, where we believe management should have 


written-off much of this inventory, it continues to grow on the balance sheet.  





In the immediate-term, we do not see how management will be able to achieve higher gross 


margins at a time when demand for their products, especially within the Newborn and 


Otometrics segments, are facing material headwinds. Newly appointed CFO Benjamin Davies, 


also appears to be fixated on gross margin in the latest earnings call stating: 


 
I think now that I've joined the company, that's one of the things that I've kind of had the 


opportunity to work on at my last company and some of the other places I've worked, really 


focus on gross margin and a lot of areas. I did a lot of work in cost and inventory in the early 


part of my career. And that's – those are areas that I'm going to focus on as the year goes on 


here. 





To conclude let us leave the reader with a major statistic that details Mr. Kennedy’s tenure as 


CFO. During his tenure as CFO/CEO, Natus’ DSI metric has increased by 57 days, from 98 days 


to 155 days! And for some reason, no analysts want to discuss the spiking inventory balances 


quarter after quarter!
GlassHouse Research

Under Jonathan Kennedy, Natus needed to Restate its Financials Due to a Material 


Weakness Regarding its Inventory Accounting Amongst Other Reasons 
 


After examining Natus’ inventory, GHR continued to ask ourselves, can this situation get any 


worse? Well, let us point out that under Mr. Kennedy’s watch as CFO in 2014, the firm received 


an adverse opinion from KPMG. This was due to a material weakness found with its design 


controls over its accounting for inventory. In Natus’ own words let’s take a look from Natus’ 


2014 10K: 


 
Management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of 


December 31, 2014, identified a control deficiency was not effective due to a lack of 


sufficient resources to effectively design, implement, and operate controls over certain 


accounts with an appropriate degree of precision. Specifically, the design of controls 


over the accounting for inventory, accounts receivable and revenue recognition for 


software contracts and multiple element arrangements was inadequate, which in the 


aggregate constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 





We find this to be highly concerning given the current ominous state that Natus’ inventory 


balance is in. Even now the company is still dealing with a new material weakness regarding its 


acquisition accounting! We want to point out how rare it is for a company to receive a material 


weakness as they far outweigh normal control deficiencies. The fact that Mr. Kennedy has 


received two different material weaknesses over a three-year period is astonishing to say the 


least. Here is management’s statement regarding its new material weakness that has not been 


remediated as of today [2017 10K]: 


 
If we do not remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial 


reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely 


affected 





Management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 


2017, identified a control was not effective because we did not perform an effective risk 


assessment relating to significant acquisitions, and as a result, we did not adequately design 


control activities over the accounting for the acquisition of Otometrics. The first fiscal year 


exemption for internal controls over financial reporting does not apply to controls over 


purchase price accounting, which constituted a material weakness in our internal control over 


financial reporting… The existence of this material weakness and of any other ineffective 


controls over our financial reporting could result in one or all of the following: 1) Revision of 


previously filed financial statements; Failure to meet our reporting obligations; Loss of 


investor confidence; and Negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.

Delayed Payment from Customers Threaten Persistence of Earnings 


In combination with BABY’s added risk of a stuffed inventory channel, their accounts receivable 


(AR) on the balance is in no better position. In our experience, the heightened balance in both 


these balance sheet accounts points to future share price degradation in upcoming periods as 


the firm works to normalize these line-items.  


Management’s aforementioned statements of longer product cycles speaks to both a stuffed 


channel and revenue that has been pulled forward to meet sales/earnings estimates. Again, 


while management may cosmetically enhance sales and earnings through these accounting 


gimmicks for a short-period of time, these actions are not sustainable in the long-term and 


points to a decreased demand for their products. Over the next year without the help of any 


acquisitions, GHR believes that most investors can expect a large drop off in revenues as the 


previous non-recurring and acquisition revenue gains disappear. Below, we highlight Natus’ 


current receivable trends.  





• Currently, Natus’ days-sales-outstanding (DSO)2 levels stand at 85 days and 86 days of 3M 


DSO and 12M DSO, respectively as of Q3 2018. This represented an increase of 9.1% YOY 


from Q3 2017. We view the current levels of 86 days to be extremely heightened from an 


absolute level as the firm is now waiting approximately three months to get paid on its 


products.  





• Previously, the firm listed an improvement in its receivables in its 2016 10K stating, “The 


change in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by a decrease in accounts 


receivable following increased collections efforts…” However, this was to be short-lived as 


in fiscal 2017, the firm faced collection issues again detailed in the 2017 Annual Report: 


 
The change in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by an increase in accounts 


receivable and lower collections during the year compared to the year prior 2016.  





• In the Q3 2018 earnings call, we get a clearer picture as CEO Kennedy discusses recent 


issues regarding AR collections. Here, he details the following credit issues with Turkey/Iran: 
 


I mean, we went through that analysis last week. Very minimal. Like I said there, we do 


have delays or really a stop in shipments to Turkey and Iran over their ability to pay. 


And that hurts us about $1 million a quarter. So that was a piece of it…  


                                                           
2 Three-month days sales outstanding (3M DSO) = Average total AR QOQ / 3M Sales * 91.25
GlassHouse Research 


17 | P a g e  
 


This was the first quarter of it. It will continue until we resolve Iran and Turkey. My 


speculation is that Iran probably gets solved first as we figure out what the supply chain has 


to look like to be able to get medical devices in Iran. I do believe that'll happen. It's just a 


little more complicated than it was.  





And then with Turkey, it's your – anybody's guess as to when the currency in Turkey 


becomes something that they're able to buy – import products. They have 40% or 50% 


decline in the Turkish lira, so that pretty much pulls them out of buying international 


products because of the cost to them has gone up so high, doubled. 





• Finally, for the first time the firm discloses credit concerns regarding its Peloton product 


line:  


 
Sure. Peloton remains a solid business for us. We've got about 130 hospitals that we do the 


hearing screen service for. We've gone through time and had experience on the 


receivables on that side. Even this quarter, we had another $1.5 million receivable 


adjustment that we took for Peloton from – over – that accumulated over the last 


several years where we're just not getting payment from certain hospitals and certain 


states.  





So we're, again, going through this annual planning process to decide where do we stand 


with some of these dates that you just can't quite get payment to the level you need to. 


Some of those contracts is converted to just direct payment for fee-for-service directly to the 


hospital. So just in a simple outsource program where we're not actually trying to bill 


payers. We'd like to see that adoption more often than not, but you're dealing with the 


economic ability of the hospital whether or not they can do those sorts of things. So it's an 


evolving business and I would say one that keeps us close to our customers, which we like 


but also one that we've had some challenge with over the last several quarters. 





• These collections issues combined with Natus’ channel being stuffed leads us to believe a 


disastrous road lies ahead for BABY over the next year. Reduced guidance, sales declines, 


the write-downs of inventory and receivables, and goodwill impairments are all on the 


table for Natus as it enters into 2019 with new board members looking to shake things up.  





• Exacerbating BABY’s collection concerns, we find that management has chosen to reduce 


the firm’s allowance for doubtful accounts (AFDA) by 38% YOY to only $6.3 million as of Q3 


2018. While DSO trends have been rising and collections are obviously an issue, we can see 


no logical reasoning as to why Natus’ deemed it appropriate to lessen this much need 


reserve.  





• Relative to gross AR, this ratio has plummeted by a material 307 bps YOY to only 4.9% as of 


09/30/18. Again, with the reported heighted DSO balance by Natus, we would expect the
GlassHouse Research 


18 | P a g e  
 


contrary to be true with this reserve increasing in the period. As a result of this decrease, 


this has allowed Natus to receive an aesthetic margin expansion over the TTM.  





• For example, if we use Natus’ Q3 2017 ratio of 8.0% as our baseline, we calculate that 


BABY’s AFDA reserve should stand at $9.7 million based on gross receivables of $127.4 


million. As a result, this difference in reserve leads to a $3.4 million ($2.7 million after-tax) 


tailwind to earnings over the past year, or a $0.08 positive impact to EPS (5.7% of TTM 


non-GAAP EPS).

Salient Growth in Prepaid Expenses Indicate Future Margin Compression 
 


In general, we view growth of prepaid expenses and other current assets (AKA prepaids) ahead 


of revenue and/or total operating expenses as a potential indicator of excess costs stored on 


the balance sheet (i.e., excess relative to their expected future benefits). Regardless of 


whether the build-up occurred as a result of deterioration in (macro or micro) economic 


circumstances or a relatively higher rate of capitalization (slower amortization) than in prior 


periods, the end result is the same. Absent similar growth in revenues, margins will decline as 


these costs must ultimately be amortized against earnings.  








• GHR has observed a consistent rise in prepaid expenses and other current assets located 


on BABY’s balance sheet. In Q4 2015, the company reported a balance of only $11.2 


million, however since then, this balance has increased in a stair-step fashion up to 


$30.8 million in the latest period. Lacking from Natus’ footnotes, the firm reported an 


astonishing 174.5% YOY jump to its current balance with very little explanations given in 


the firm’s filings. 3  An increase of this magnitude with no clarifications we find to be 


highly peculiar, especially with a blessing from Natus’ auditor.  





• Prepaids are discussed briefly in the firm’s 2016 10K report in the liquidity and capital 


resources section stating, “The change in operating assets and liabilities was driven by… 


an increase in prepaid expenses related to prepayments we made to our distribution 


partner for the Venezuelan contract.” During this timeframe prepaids almost doubled 


from $11.2 million as of 12/31/15 to $22.0 million at 12/31/16. But while this figure 


                                                           
3 Natus does not disclose a prepaid and other current asset footnote with sub-line items broken out in its annual 
filings. 


Capitalizing expenses is the easiest way for CEOs and 


CFOs to create faux earnings in any given period. 


Prepaid expenses never get discussed on conference 


calls as analysts are too busy digesting 


management’s guidance and updating their models.  





In our experience, it is the perfect account that no 


one looks at to manipulate.
GlassHouse Research 


20 | P a g e  
 


continued to increase into 2019, there was little to no disclosures to why the current 


balance stands at $30.8 million.  








• We observe that in the excerpt above from the Q3 2018 10Q filing, we can see that 


prepaids consumed over $14 million in cash in the period, a highly material amount. 


However, we are perplexed to why no mention of this highly material consumption of 


cash is to be found in the liquidity and capital resource section of this 10Q.  





• Digging into the numbers, prepaids have outpaced both 3M and 12M sales on a YOY 


basis by 518 bps and 118 bps, respectively as of Q3 2018. As a result of the recent 


growth in this account, prepaid expenses are up to 23.6% (5.9%) relative to 3M sales 


(12M sales). Both these ratios are near their respective five-year high showing the 


severity of this unusual increase. 





• We find similar results when the level of prepaids is measured against total operating 


expenses (rather than revenues). For instance, prepaids jumped 129 bps YOY to 6.5% of
GlassHouse Research 


21 | P a g e  
 


12M operating expenses. Again, analyzing shorter-term patterns, prepaids also 


increased 610 bps YOY to 27.1%, of total three-month operating expenses.  





• To quantify the rise in prepaid expenses relative to earnings, we calculate that if Natus 


would have kept the prepaid-to-12M sales ratio constant at its Q3 2017 value of 4.7%, 


the company would have to reduce its EPS by $0.15 over the TTM. This EPS value also 


equates to 10.3% of TTM non-GAAP EPS.

Natus Warranty Reserve is Severely Under-Accrued 


In combination with BABY’s added risk of a stuffed inventory channel and delayed payment 


from major customers, the company’s balance sheet woes continue as GHR believes its 


warranty reserve is insufficiently funded. Listed in the company’s risk factor section in its 10K, 


Natus discloses how inadequately or miscalculating its warranty reserve can impact its 


company:  
 


Liability for product warranties 
The Company provides a warranty for products that is generally one year in length. In some cases, 
regulations may require the Company to provide repair or remediation beyond the typical 
warranty period. If any products contain defects, the Company may be required to incur 
additional repair and remediation costs. Service for domestic customers is provided by 
Company-owned service centers that perform all service, repair, and calibration services. Service 
for international customers is provided by a combination of Company-owned facilities and 
vendors on a contract basis. 
 


A warranty reserve is included in accrued liabilities for the expected future costs of servicing 
products. Additions to the reserve are based on management’s best estimate of probable liability. 
The Company considers a combination of factors including material and labor costs, regulatory 
requirements, and other judgments in determining the amount of the reserve. The reserve is 
reduced as costs are incurred to honor existing warranty and regulatory obligations. 





• In GHR’s view, management has been under-reserving its warranty reserve in recent 


periods which has cosmetically enhanced margins. Specifically, as BABY has been growing 


the top-line through acquisition growth and reporting increased warranty settlements over 


the past five years, we find that BABY’s provisioning for its warranty reserve (warranty 


expense) has been underfunded based on our calculations.   





• To illustrate this, GHR calculates a highly material 27.1% YOY decline of Natus’ warranty 


reserve to $9.1 million as of Q3 2018. However, more importantly, the warranty reserve fell 


by 320 bps YOY to 6.9% relative to 3M sales. This is important to understand because as 


Natus’ increases its sales (mostly through acquisitions), the firm will naturally need a higher 


reserve to account for those extra sales, hence the ratio with sales. However, conflicting 


with this line of thinking, Natus management has chosen to decrease its reserve by a 


significant amount.  





• Looking at longer-term trends for Natus, the company’s warranty reserve fell by 87 bps YOY 


to 1.7% of 12M sales as of 09/30/18. Thus, if we use the 2.6% prior year’s ratio as a 


baseline, GHR calculates an 11 cent benefit to the bottom line for BABY over the TTM. Or
GlassHouse Research 


23 | P a g e  
 


in other words, 7.8% of non-GAAP EPS over the TTM (11 cents) was based on this 


unsustainable warranty reserve benefit alone. 





• Exacerbating this unsustainable boost to earnings over the TTM, we found that Natus has 


disclosed specific warranty accruals for its NeoBLUE phototherapy products that are on a 


ship-hold in Seattle due to the FDA:  





As of December 31, 2017, the Company has accrued $5.4 million to bring certain 


NeoBLUE® phototherapy products into U.S. regulatory compliance. The Company's 
estimate of the costs associated with bringing the NeoBLUE® phototherapy products into 
compliance is primarily based upon the number of units outstanding that may require the 
repair, costs associated with shipping and repairing the product, and the assumption that the 
FDA will approve the Company's plan for compliance 





• So where clearly management continues to have issues with the ongoing ship-hold of its 


products in Seattle, the firm’s warranty reserve continued to dwindle. This puts the 


company at risk of heightened write-offs and subsequently warranty expenses. In our view, 


we see an acceleration of margin degradation in future periods (within the next three 


quarters) based on the firm’s inadequate warranty reserve alone.

Non-GAAP Exclusions Accelerate After Drawing Ire of SEC 





In this section we will not argue the veracity of management’s use of non-GAAP exclusions with 


amortization, acquisition and restructuring costs. However, what we will point out are 


management’s extensive acceleration of these exclusions over the tenure of CEO Jonathan 


Kennedy. Exacerbating the issue, it appears that the SEC has already come down on Natus in 


the past for their non-GAAP exclusions where they call out Natus for “restructuring costs… 


which may be inconsistent with Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations”.  





Obvious to everyone following Natus, non-GAAP earnings for BABY have been substantially 


higher than the company’s as-reported GAAP earnings. For example, in the trailing 9M period, 


non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.99; a major contrast from the GAAP loss of $0.35. Throughout 


all of 2017, non-GAAP EPS of $1.45 dwarfed the GAAP loss reported of $0.62 (see Table 4, on 


Page 26).  





We can see throughout Mr. Kennedy’s tenure as CFO, these bifurcations of GAAP and non-


GAAP income have accelerated dating back to 2013. These deviations from non-GAAP-to-GAAP 


stand at $0.29 (39.2%), $0.29 (29.9%), $0.41 (36.0%), and $0.33 (25.6%) in fiscal years 2013, 


2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively. Finally, in the last two years, the deviations accelerated 


with non-GAAP earnings of $1.45 and $0.99 and GAAP losses of $0.62 and $0.99 in 2017 and 


9M 2018, respectively.  





On 07/07/2016, then CFO Jonathan Kennedy received a comment letter from the SEC that 


detailed the following regarding its use of non-GAAP earnings:  
 


3. We note that you present non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP gross margin in 


the headline of your press release as “record” results without also presenting GAAP earnings 


per share with equal or greater prominence, as required by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(A) of Regulation 


S-K. Similarly, you discuss forward-looking non-GAAP earnings per share guidance without 


providing the corresponding GAAP earnings per share amounts or the required quantitative 


reconciliations. Your presentations appear to give greater prominence to the non-GAAP 


measures than to the comparable GAAP measures which is inconsistent with the 


updated Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations issued on May 17, 2016. Please 


review this guidance when preparing your next earnings release.  





4. We note that your non-GAAP measures exclude restructuring costs that appear to 


be normal, recurring operating expenses necessary to operate your business, which 


may be inconsistent with the updated Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations 


issued on May 17, 2016. Please review this guidance when preparing your earnings release.
GlassHouse Research 


25 | P a g e  
 


The most concerning item lies with bullet point #4 that accuses Natus of excluding normal 


operating expenses from non-GAAP earnings, thus improving margins dramatically. We note 


that in our time studying SEC comment letters, it is extremely rare for the SEC to accuse a 


company of excluding normal operating expenses from non-GAAP earnings. The company 


responded with the following comment with regards to this accusation: 


 
We believe that adjusting non-GAAP results for restructuring costs is consistent with each of 


the foregoing.  While there have admittedly been adjustments for these charges in past 


earnings releases, these costs have been in response to the relatively unique 


circumstances of the respective acquisitions giving rise to the restructuring activity 


(other than the much less frequent restructuring charges that have been in response to 


significant changes in the markets the Company serves or the Company’s business).  





The Company has over time completed multiple acquisitions of other companies and 


businesses. Following an acquisition the Company will, as it determines appropriate, initiate 


restructuring events to eliminate redundant costs. Restructuring expenses which are excluded 


in the non-GAAP items are exclusively related to permanent reductions in our workforce and 


redundant facility closures. Consistent with Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 


102.03, we do not describe these charges as non-recurring or in other terms that 


mischaracterize the frequency of these charges. 





This was back in the middle of 2016 where BABY ended up excluding only $0.05/per share in 


restructuring charges in all of 2016. Since that time, Natus’ restructuring exclusions have 


skyrocketed to $0.22 and $0.58 in 2017 and 9M 2018, respectively. Also, as we can see from 


the above statement, management has tied restructuring charges to acquisitions. However, we 


point out that the last acquisition the firm made was assets of Integra back on 10/06/17! While 


we would expect some restructuring charges to carry over, we do not understand how over a 


year later since their last acquisition the firm has accelerated its restructuring and acquisition 


charges.  





Finally, when we look at Natus’ non-GAAP earnings, the firm’s material exclusions of “recall 


accrual and remediation efforts”, which are associated with the firm’s Seattle FDA recall, 


appear to be part of the firm’s regular operating business. Especially, due to the length of time 


(approximately five years since the first letter), we believe these expenses to be highly 


reoccurring in nature and a normal operating cost for the company. As the reader can see in 


Chart 7, these charges continue to be a highly material percentage of earnings that 


management wants investors and analysts to ignore as true costs to the business.  





With the SEC already closely watching management’s use of non-GAAP exclusions, we believe 


that the firm’s use of non-GAAP exclusions has been highly aggressive under Mr. Kennedy as
GlassHouse Research 


26 | P a g e  
 


CEO/CFO. While the company believes these costs to be non-recurring, we believe these to be 


true costs to the company as cash is going out the door at an accelerated pace.

Inept Natus Management Has Led the Company Down a Dark Path  





Natus Medical Inc. (BABY) has had an interesting last 12 months to say the least. The medical 


device company has gone through a well-publicized proxy fight with Voce Capital, 


organizational changes, material weaknesses relating to their financials, continued issues with 


the FDA, and finally, a recent consolidation of their segments in order to “increase 


transparency”. Before this segment consolidation occurred, Natus operated in three segments: 


Neurology (neurodiagnostics and monitoring), Newborn (neonatal assessment and treatment), 


and Otometrics (hearing aid fitting, screening, and assessment).  





With the stock price somewhat stagnant over the past five years, this drew the ire of 


institutional shareholders Voce Capital (Voce). As a result, in April 2018, Voce informed the 


Board of Directors of their intent to nominate new director candidates to replace 50% of the 


Natus Board (three of the six seats, including the Chairman of the Board – Robert Gunst). 


Furthermore, Voce was not discreet regarding their disdain for long-tenured CEO Jim Hawkins. 


Specifically, Voce took issues with Mr. Hawkins’ future vision of Natus as they described the 


company as “in disarray”. Here is an excerpt describing Mr. Hawkins in their letter to the Board: 


 
CEO Jim Hawkins had long pursued a “roll-up” strategy, with a string of poorly 


integrated acquisitions, muted organic growth, declining profitability and management 


turnover. His primary talking point in our first meeting with him was that he intended 


to maximize the value of Natus through a sale once he stabilized the business.  





Having completed 2012 with annual revenues of $292 million, he stated that he had build 


Natus through acquisitions to reach $300 million in revenues which was the “critical mass” 


he felt he needed to attract the attention of General Electric and Philips, competitors whom 


he stated were his preferred acquirers of Natus. (That bogey steadily grew over time, to $400 


million, then $500 million and beyond…) CEO Hawkins also represented that he was in 


annual dialogue with each those parties concerning a potential sale of the company.  





We agree with Voce Capital that Natus was and still is a company in disarray. We also find it 


quite disconcerting that management’s focus appeared to be raising the top line by any means 


possible in order to entice a sale. Illustrating this idea, Voce wrote about CEO Hawkins’ failed 


acquisitions strategies in their press release (04/23/18)4:

GlassHouse Research 


28 | P a g e  
 





CEO Hawkins has always appeared to prefer doing deals over building Natus organically. 


Yet his success extracting value from acquisitions is dubious at best. In 2005, when this 


buying spree began, Natus had approximately $43 million in revenue. The aggregate 


revenue of the companies purchased since then, measured at the time of their 


acquisition, is approximately $492 million. Yet Natus’ pro forma 2017 revenue 


(inclusive of its acquisitions of Otometrics and Integra), was approximately $531 


million. This implies total organic revenue growth of negative $4 million over the 


previous twelve years.  





Despite its aggregate investment of $569 million over more than a decade the Company has 


nevertheless managed to shrink its revenue base! Nor do the acquisitions appear to have 


generated any benefits of scale: Natus’ gross margins and operating margins were higher 


in 2005 than now (63% and 14% then versus 60% and 13% today, respectively), before 


the acquisition frenzy started and when the Company had a fraction of its current revenues. 





Surprisingly, Voce appeared to favor the firm’s previous CFO Jonathan Kennedy in the same 


press release:  


 
After the arrival of CFO Jonathan Kennedy in March 2013, the Company appeared to regain 


its footing as CFO Kennedy began mopping up CEO Hawkins’ mess. Over the next three 


years, Natus made only three small acquisitions totaling approximately $17 million in value 


(one of which was only $1 million).  





Boosted by facility consolidation (necessitated from all the previous buyout activity), gross 


and operating margins both expanded. CFO Kennedy also reduced the corporate tax rate 


from 31% to 23% through a series of shrewd maneuvers. Earnings jumped from $0.62 


in 2012 to $1.55 in 2015, with the Company consistently beating and raising guidance. 





GHR essentially disagrees with Voce’s entire sentiment surrounding Mr. Kennedy’s job as CFO. 


As the reader will come to see in our detailed report, we believe many of the “shrewd 


maneuvers” orchestrated by Mr. Kennedy were nothing more than smoke and mirrors.  





While Voce Capital has hope for Natus under the newly appointed CEO Mr. Kennedy, we at 


GlassHouse are not as optimistic. In fact, we argue that the company is currently screwed either 


way. Yes, the string of acquisitions did help to conceal a deteriorating core company. However, 


now that the acquisitions will most likely cease, we believe the company will need to “reset 


expectations” with investors and analysts, as it will need to deal with the cornucopia of 


accounting issues detailed herein.

Voce Capital Wins Two Seats on Natus Board  
 


Natus, in its defense, (and defense of former CEO Hawkins), gave a series of retorts through 


press releases leading up to the 06/22/18 vote for new directors. Within these retorts, Natus 


defended their track record of enhancing shareholder value, endorsed the incumbent board 


members (Robert Weiss, Doris Engibous, and Robert Gunst), and detailed Voce’s lack of a new 


strategy.5  





When the chips were all settled on 06/22/18, Voce Capital was able to replace two board 


members (Robert Weiss and Doris Engibous) with Lisa Heine and Joshua Levine. However, 


Voce’s endeavors to remove Chairman of the Board Robert Gunst failed. Subsequently, with 


two new members added to the board, CEO Jim Hawkins “retired” abruptly a few weeks later 


on 07/11/18, after 14 years of service. As a result, the former CFO Jonathan Kennedy, who 


appears to have Voce’s blessings, was promoted to CEO and appointed to the Board of 


Directors. Subsequently on 09/17/18, Natus appointed Drew Davies as Executive Vice President 


and CFO effective 10/01/18. Mr. Davies appears to have close ties with Mr. Kennedy as they 


both previously worked for Intersil Corporation as Controller and CFO, respectively.

New Management is Cut of the Same Cloth as Jim Hawkins 
 


Let us be perfectly clear, Natus Medical is one of the worst run public companies we have ever 


come across throughout our research. In recent years, under the helm of Mr. Hawkins and Mr. 


Kennedy, Natus 1) started multiple new product lines, only to discontinue them in future 


periods, 2) purchased new bolt-on acquisitions and subsequently shut them down a short 


time later, 3) endorsed new hires to lead divisions only to fire them in later periods, 4) 


continued to give guidance that was missed over and over again due to management’s lack of 


visibility into future demand, and 5) finally under Mr. Kennedy’s watch, the firm received two 


material weaknesses regarding its inventory, AR, and then acquisition accounting in 2014 and 


in 2017.  





We believe that Voce Capital was only partially correct by blaming just Jim Hawkins for the 


tribulations of Natus. While Mr. Hawkins may be mostly at fault for the operational deficiencies 


of Natus, we believe Mr. Kennedy will soon be held accountable for the myriad of financial 


engineering red flags that have been employed by the company. Below, let us dissect and 


counter each of Voce’s accolades, given to the newly appointed CEO in their press release:  





1. CFO Kennedy reduced the ETR from 31% to 23% through a series of shrewd maneuvers 





As trained accountants, we do not view the reducing of their tax rate to be any kind of 


accomplishment. This is especially true after reviewing exactly how Mr. Kennedy was able to 


reduce the firm’s tax rate down to 23% (reached in FY2016). So how was Mr. Kennedy able to 


reduce taxes by over 800 bps? A straightforward strategy of shifting its profits overseas to low-


tax jurisdictions, a strategy that we honestly do not believe will hold water with the IRS.6  





2. Earnings jumped from $0.62 in 2012 to $1.55 in 2015 





For brevity’s sake, we do not believe Voce should be pleased with Mr. Kennedy as we believe 


much of the firm’s earnings growth was due to financial engineering and unsustainable sources. 


For example, Mr. Kennedy decided to exclude $0.15 (10% of non-GAAP EPS) of product 


remediation costs in 2015, however we consider this to be a normal operating cost of the 


business. Furthermore, the company accelerated its exclusions of amortization costs over the 


same timeframe. Finally, we believe a substantial portion of these earnings gains were due to 


inventory accounting games as we have discussed in our prior Inventory Section on Page 4.

Newly Appointed CEO Kennedy and CFO Davies Have Left Prior Companies in Disarray 
 


Coincidentally, we find that CEO Jonathan Kennedy (June 2004 to April 2013) and CFO Drew 


Davies (April 2009 to August 2012) both worked together previously at the semiconductor firm 


Intersil Corporation (ISIL, now acquired by Renesas Electronics). While Natus and Intersil 


operate in two different industries, we have found several uncomplimentary similarities 


between the two firms. During Mr. Kennedy’s tenure as CFO, ISIL’s stock price was at 


approximately $20 as of June 2004. While the stock performed admirably over the next two 


years, it cratered during the recession and never recovered. At the time of Mr. Kennedy’s 


departure, the stock price stood near $7, representing 65% of value deterioration over nine 


years.  





What brought ISIL down? Well, a lot of the same issues currently coinciding with Natus: 1) 


Declining profitability/ROIC metrics (see Chart 8, below) as the company tried to acquire its way 


to growth, 2) too many product lines that needed to be condensed, 3) and finally, inventory 


concerns as the firm’s DSI balance spiked to a high of 126 days in 2010 with the stock price 


never to recover.

GlassHouse Research 


32 | P a g e  
 





Furthermore, when we dig into Drew Davies’ past endeavors, they do not appear to paint a 


pretty picture. After leaving Intersil and spending only six months working for Marvell 


Technology (MRVL) as their Corporate Controller, Mr. Davies took a CFO position at Extreme 


Networks (EXTR) starting in June 2016. Throughout his tenure, the stock price of EXTR jumped 


to a high $15.00 at the end of 2017. However, the high would be short-lived, as the stock 


plummeted to a low of $5.50 when Mr. Davies exited the company amongst accounting 


system issues in September 2018. A cursory review of EXTR’s non-GAAP earnings appears to 


show management using aggressive non-GAAP exclusions that we take issue with.  





Overall, while Voce Capital believes they have the right leadership to steer Natus into 


prosperity, we believe Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Davies are cut from the same cloth as Mr. Hawkins 


and will lead the company into unfortunate despair. Furthermore, GlassHouse takes issue with 


Natus’ current weak Audit Committee which appears to have no accounting background 


experience. The Audit Committee consists of Board Members Kenneth Ludlum (Chairman), 


Robert Gunst, and William Moore. While Mr. Ludlum has been deemed an “audit committee 


financial expert” by the Board, we note that he has no prior public accounting experience. 


Furthermore, he does not possess a CPA license nor an accounting degree in any form. 





In the midst of two material weaknesses found under his watch as Audit Committee 


Chairman, GHR wonders how Mr. Ludlum has been able to keep his job as Audit Chairman for 


this long. Based on history, it is apparent that this Audit Board has let Mr. Kennedy do as he 


pleases in terms of aggressive acquisition, inventory, AR, reserve, and revenue recognition 


accounting. So why should investors trust this Audit Board now to protect Natus’ investors? 











We think a billion company can generate a 


lot more profits. It can be a lot more 


attractive to investors. We want to 


become a billion plus company, and we do 


it organically eventually, but we can 


accelerate with good acquisitions.  





– CEO Electronics for Imaging, Guy Gecht 


As we go forward, we’re going to drive 


to $1 billion in 5 years. That’s our goal. 


Doing some of this through organic 


growth and some through acquisitions… 


And it’s a very exciting goal that we’ve 


set internally and we’re committed… to 


make happen.

Q4 2016 Earnings Call, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“For our full year 2017, we expect non-


GAAP earnings per share guidance of 


$1.80 to $1.85.” 


The company reported non-GAAP EPS 


of only $1.45 (a 21% miss) as the firm 


continued to lower its EPS guidance 


after every period.  


06/22/17, Investor Day, 
CFO Jonathan Kennedy 





Mr. Kennedy disclosed revenue 


guidance of $505 to $510 million for 


2017. “We should be able to achieve 


that with revenue growth driven in 


Otometrics, Newborn Care and 


Neurology.” 


Even halfway into the year, mgmt. 


missed guidance with revenue of only 


$501.mm. However, sans acquisitions, 


BABY would have only produced sales 


of $386.mm, or only 1.2% organic 


growth. 


Neuro and Newborn sales were only up 


1.9% and 0.2%, respectively. The firm 


also reported “lower than expected 


revenues from Otometrics.”

Goal of 20% operating margin for 2017. 


And >22% long-term. 


The firm reported non-GAAP operating 


margin of only 13.2% for FY2017. 


FY2018 isn’t much better with only 


12.0% margins reported.

CFO Jonathan Kennedy 





Relating to ROIC – “If you look at 2012, 
down at 6%, okay, that's not too bad, 
but it's not stellar. But getting into '14 
and '15, 13%, 15% and then 14% ROIC in 
2016. So a 14% ROIC for last year. And 
then if we look at Otometrics, we paid 
about $150 million for that business. If 
we achieve our 20% margin goal on – by 
the time we get there, it's $115 million, 
$120 million business, the return on 
capital on that business will exceed 
what I'm showing here today, will be in 
the mid-teens.” 


According to GHR calculations that use 
BABY’s non-GAAP data, we calculate 
ROIC as being lower amounts of 8.8%, 
11.2%, 13.2%, and 9.6% in 2013, 2014, 
2015, and 2016, respectively.  
Furthermore, while management was 
hoping for mid-teen ratios for the 
future, this metric dropped off a cliff to 
7.9% in 2017. The firm stopped 
disclosing its ROIC metric after 
06/22/17.8  


06/22/17, Investor Day, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“So we're really positioned now for 


very fast organic growth along with 


layering in acquisitions for the next 5 


years. We put out there for ourselves 


a goal that we believe we can be a 5% 


to 7% organic growing business. That's 


a big statement.” 


Mgmt. incorrectly stated that 


consolidated organic growth was +3% 


in the Q1 2018 period (it was -4.6%). 


Natus has now reported negative 


organic growth in 4 straight periods. 


Mgmt. has also appeared to stop 


disclosing the consolidated organic 


growth rate for BABY. 


06/22/17, Investor Day, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“And how we look to do that is 


certainly led by Otometrics. We 


believe they can grow 10% to 15% a 


year.” This business was selling 


approximately $100mm a year when 


Natus acquired them. Mr. Hawkins 


also proposed a 20% operating margin 


for the Otometrics segment. 


Otometrics sales growth has 


decelerated greatly over the last two 


periods; reporting no growth in the 


latest period. Margins are nowhere 


near 20% as the firm was expecting to 


sell its Otoscan product for $15,000 


and has only been able to sell a 


lackluster 50 units near an $8,000 


price point.

“Really interesting kind of spin on our 
EEG business is GND. So we acquired 
GND in January of 2015… It works 
very, very well. And from the payer's 
perspective, it is a lot less expensive, a 
lot less expensive to do this in the 
home versus doing in the hospital. So 


GND has been a wonderful, wonderful 


addition to our EEG portfolio.” 


In its 01/15/19 Press Release, Natus 


exited this “non-core” business. The 


GND business accounted for 


approximately $12mm in revenue in 


2018. After only 3 years in the Natus 


family, GND was discarded. As a 


result, GHR expects material 


impairments to goodwill and 


inventory in the next period.

CFO Jonathan Kennedy 


Regarding payment for Peloton 
service, “We talked last quarter on our 
call about some of the issues we've 
had in Peloton just recently with 
reimbursement rates…  
 
So in response to that, we have made 
a strategic shift to focus only on 
profitable hospitals; in other 
words, those hospitals where we 
aren't dependent on solely third-party 
payers.” 
 


From the Q3 2018 earnings call, “Even 


this quarter, we had another $1.5 


million receivable adjustment that 


we took for Peloton from that 


accumulated over the last several 


years where we're just not getting 


payment from certain hospitals and 


certain states... So it's an evolving 


business… but also one that we've 


had some challenge with over the last 


several quarters.” 


Q2 2017 Earnings Call, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“In the second quarter, Jonathan 


Kennedy, our CFO, was appointed to 


also head up our Newborn Care 


business unit. I would like to report 


that significant progress has been 


made to improve our processes in our 


Seattle facility, where we are 


operating under a warning letter. We 


look to complete this remediation 


work in the first half of 2018.” 


While the company has reported 


positive audits in the Q3 2018 


quarter, Natus has still been unable 


to remediate its ship-hold in the 


Seattle facility with the FDA, two 


periods after it was forecasted to be 


completed.

Q3 2017 Earnings Call, 
CFO Jonathan Kennedy 


“As we talked about before, Peloton 


coming down from a revenue 


perspective due to lower revenue per 


baby. In terms of getting Peloton on 


track, earlier in the year, Peloton was 


not profitable, and I'm happy to 


report that today, we've restructured 


that, and that business is doing quite 


well from a margin perspective… from 


a growth perspective, Peloton will 


continue to grow, although priced 


lower than past expectations but will 


continue to grow.”  


While mgmt. has pretty much 


stopped discussing Peloton numbers 


all together, GHR cannot imagine 


them doing well with the Newborn 


segment TTM sales being down 17% 


YOY.  


Q3 2017 Earnings Call, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“We announced the acquisition of 


neurosurgery business assets from 


Integra LifeSciences… for $47.5 million. 


With historic annual revenue of 


approximately $50 million.” 


GHR calculates that these Integra assets 


produced only $39.2 million of revenue 


over the TTM. While mgmt. did not set 


any sales goals for these assets, we 


cannot fathom a 21.5% decline in sales 


is what they were expecting.  


Q4 2017 Earnings Call, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“For our full year 2018, we now expect 


revenue of $535 to $540 million and 


non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.60 to 


$1.65.  


Mgmt. has now reduced guidance twice 


in 2018, with full year revenues guided 


to be $525 to $530mm and non-GAAP 


EPS of $1.47 to $1.50. 


Q1 2018 Earnings Call, 
CEO Jim Hawkins 


“Our Newborn Care supply business 


increased. This leads us to believe that 


birthrates increased in the quarter, 


which would obviously be a positive for 


our Newborn Care business if this 


continues.”  


In every publication GHR researched 


relating to U.S. birthrates, this number 


has been falling precipitously, since a 


recent high in 2007. No data suggest 


that this trend is changing whatsoever. 


This is even more apparent in the 


Newborn segment’s lackluster sales 


declines of -14.7% and -7.3% in Q2 and 


Q3, which caught mgmt. by surprise.9

01/15/19 Press Release 
CEO Jonathan Kennedy 


Natus will consolidate its three 


business units, Neuro, Newborn, and 


Otometrics into “One Natus”… The 


new structure provides for increased 


transparency, efficiency and cross-


functional collaboration across 


common technologies, processes and 


customer channels.  


Natus has one of the worst inventory 


and balance sheet positions we have 


ever seen researching public 


companies. The fact that mgmt. has 


misled investors time and time again in 


a two-year span is frightening, to say 


the least. Now mgmt. wants to 


consolidate segments to increase 


transparency? How does that make 


any sense? 





Updating our above GAAP guidance comment, let’s break down what is actually going on here. 


Management has given both GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS estimates with a breakdown of the 
expected non-GAAP exclusions. Therefore, with both figures given, we would expect both figures in 


parallel (GAAP and non-GAAP) to beat or miss guidance if the exclusions are projected correctly. 


Obviously, this has not been the case with Natus.  





Let’s take a look at Q3 guidance given in the Q2 2018 earnings release:  











We see that Natus was able to reach the lower end of the non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.40. 


However, what happened to the $0.19-$0.23 of GAAP earnings? All of a sudden, the firm 


decided to report $0.41 of restructuring and “other non-recurring” costs and exclude them 


from non-GAAP earnings. Natus ended up reporting a GAAP loss of –$0.17. These are actual 


cash expenses leaving the door for Natus, $13.8 million in Q3 to be exact. We see this as a 


recurring theme regarding BABY’s missed EPS estimates, where unexpected non-GAAP 


exclusions continue to unearth every period. We also point out that on 07/07/16, CFO Jonathan
GlassHouse Research 


39 | P a g e  
 





Kennedy received a letter from the SEC that called out Natus’ restructuring costs for 


“appearing to be normal, recurring operating expenses necessary to operate your business”. 





After every instance where management provided some sort of guidance, they persistently fell 


short of their endeavors. Whether the reasoning was nefarious in nature or due to 


incompetence, both reasons behind the incessant missed predictions remain unsatisfactory. 


Exacerbating things, these issues occurred while Mr. Kennedy orchestrated the plethora of 


accounting gimmicks that have yet to be unwound into BABY’s future financials. While current 


investors may believe the worst is behind Natus with Mr. Hawkins “retiring,” we believe this 


is just the tip of the iceberg with CEO Jonathan Kennedy at the helm.

Accounting Red Flags Are Set to Violently Reverse for Natus Medical in 2019 


The bull case regarding Natus’ stock price revolves around the following tenants that we believe 
the sell-side community has misunderstood:  
 


1) Investors believe that Jonathan Kennedy is different from previous CEO Mr. Hawkins and 
under his leadership, Mr. Kennedy will be able to turn around the company based on his 
track record. 


2) Analysts believe that gross and operating margins have room to expand and the result 
will propel the stock price upwards.  


3) Investors believe that the company will now be able to grow the company organically 
with the focus now coming off acquisitions.  





Regarding the above items, we have gone step by step to debunk many of these flawed reasonings 
for investors. With regards to Mr. Kennedy, Voce Capital sang his praises stating that he “mopped 
up CEO Hawkins mess” and that he “helped to expand both gross and operating margins”. Based 
on our analysis, Mr. Kennedy was only able to expand margins by consciously deciding not to 
write-off what we believe to be legacy and impaired inventories on the balance sheet. 
 
This segues into the second bullet point, the only way that Natus has been able to keep such 
consistent gross margins near 60% is because Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Kennedy orchestrated 
accounting games with inventories, receivables, AFDA, prepaids, and their warranty expense. 
Finally, now that the company will cease its acquisition strategy, we believe that in this current 
weak demand environment, Natus’ true earnings will continue to report declines and losses with 
respect to revenues and earnings. All these items, we believe, will cause Natus’ stock price to 
decline precipitously over the next twelve months. Furthermore, we highly doubt that the sell-
side community fully comprehends the magnitude of accounting headwinds (especially Natus’ 
current inventory situation) that BABY faces over the next year.  
 
We at GHR believe the company’s sustainable economic earnings can be better estimated using 
our accounting adjustments made in the previous sections. Adjustments made for Natus’ 
inventory, prepaid expenses, and underfunded warranty and AFDA reserve need to be made in 
order to strip out any financial engineering gains. Furthermore, we believe the firm’s reoccurring 
product remediation costs need to be added back to EPS to come to a sustainable EPS figure.

Table 5: Sustainable EPS Calculation 


 
 
 
Basing our valuation on our sustainable EPS value of $0.49, we believe a fair share-price for the 
firm stands currently at $9.80, which represents a 70.0% downside to the share-price. Based on 
Natus’ non-existent growth and dire outlook, we believe a very conservative P/E multiple lies at 
20x, which we used in our models.  
 
In light of our concerns regarding the plethora of accounting and fundamental concerns laid out 
herein, GlassHouse finds the current stock price to be highly egregious. Accordingly, we are 
initiating coverage on Natus Medical Inc., (BABY) with a target price of $9.80.

Appendix 
 


Exhibit 1: Natus Income Tax Footnotes (2017 10K) 





Where Natus once kept a reasonable 39.1% of their earnings within the United States in 2015, 


the excerpt below illustrates that this drastically changed in 2016 and 2017. Essentially 


reporting $0 of earnings within the U.S. in 2016 and then a large loss of $18.1 million in 2017, 


Mr. Kennedy basically engaged in transfer pricing of its products to shift profits overseas at 


an accelerated rate. While this could fly with companies that possessed little tax nexus within 


the U.S., we find that Natus currently reports 54.1% and 45.9% of sales and assets within the 


United States in 2017, respectively. This material amount of Nexus leads us to believe that 


BABY is not out of the corner yet, as Natus discloses that its U.S. Federal taxes remain open to 


examination from 2014 through 2017. Thus, we believe the company is now at high risk of 


penalties, increases in uncertain tax positions (UTP), and higher future tax rates.  











The Company's tax returns remain open to examination as follows: U.S. federal, 2014 through 2017; U.S. 


states, generally 2013 through 2017; and significant foreign jurisdictions, generally 2013 through 2017.
