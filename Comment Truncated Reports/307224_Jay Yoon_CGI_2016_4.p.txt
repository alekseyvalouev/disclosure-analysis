Celadon	Group:	The	Smoking	Gun	Emerges
Dec.	8,	2016	9:25	AM	ET48	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


Thanks	to	a	tip	from	an	individual	with	ties	to	the	trucking	industry,	I	have	uncovered
what	appears	to	be	“smoking	gun”	evidence	that	CGI	overstated	its	historical	profits.


This	“smoking	gun”	is	a	large	tractor	swap	consummated	in	September	2016
between	Quality	and	Stoops	Freightliner,	a	truck	dealer	located	in	the	Midwest.


Based	on	my	analysis,	CGI	did	not	properly	account	for	this	swap	in	its	financial
statements.	As	a	result,	the	company	appears	to	have	overstated	its	Q1	2017	profits
by	>$10m.


CGI’s	Q1	2017	10Q	and	earnings	report	contain	several	red	flags	which	further	call
into	question	the	company’s	accounting	methods	and	ability	to	remain	solvent.


Over	the	past	few	months,	I	have	received	several	emails	from	both	current	and
former	employees	expressing	concern	over	the	conduct	of	the	company	and	its
management.


Author's	Note:	I	intend	to	submit	the	contents	of	this	article	as	an	addendum	to	my
whistleblower	complaint	with	the	SEC.	I	have	also	contacted	the	FBI's	white	collar	crimes
division,	as	I	believe	the	"smoking	gun"	contained	in	this	article	warrants	their	attention.
None	of	the	information	and	analysis	in	this	article	is	intended	to	be	an	allegation	of
wrongdoing	on	the	part	of	Stoops	Freightliner.


Public	Interest	Statement


I	believe	the	information	contained	in	this	article	about	Celadon	Group's	("CGI"	or	the
"company")	(TICKER:	CGI)	alleged	wrongdoing	is	a	matter	of	public	interest.


CGI	is	a	publicly	traded	company	on	the	NYSE	with	a	market	capitalization	of	over	$200m.
The	company's	largest	investors	include	institutional	investment	firms	such	as	Wellington
Management	company,	Blackrock	Fund	Advisors,	and	T.	Rowe	Price	who	hold	14.0%,

7.1%	and	5.2%,	respectively,	of	CGI's	outstanding	shares	(as	of	9/30/16).	The	clients	of
these	firms	include	many	retail	investors	who	have	invested	their	savings	into	investment
funds	and	retirement	funds	managed	by	these	institutions.


Also,	as	discussed	in	my	previous	articles	on	the	company	(here,	here,	and	here),	I
believe	CGI	will	likely	need	to	raise	a	significant	amount	of	money	from	investors	via	a
large	secondary	equity	offering.	If	my	analysis	in	this	article	is	true,	then	the	potential
investors	in	such	an	offering	could	experience	a	significant	financial	loss.


Thus,	given	the	potentially	negative	financial	impact	that	CGI's	actions	could	have	on	its
large	and	diverse	investor	base,	I	believe	it	is	important	to	disclose	my	findings	about	the
company	to	the	public.

In	my	previous	articles	on	Celadon	Group,	I	reported	that	the	company	had	seemingly
misrepresented	its	financial	performance	by	overstating	its	historical	profits.	I	made	this
analysis	based	on	the	numerous	accounting	irregularities	present	in	the	company's	SEC

filings	and	earnings	releases.	Unfortunately	for	CGI	shareholders,	based	on	new
information	which	I	have	recently	uncovered,	there	is	more	evidence	that	this	reporting	is
accurate.


In	September	2016,	Quality	completed	a	large	swap	of	around	1,000	tractors	with
Stoops	Freightliner,	a	truck	dealership	located	in	the	Midwest.	This	highly	unusual
transaction	was	brought	to	my	attention	in	early	November	by	an	individual	with	close	ties
to	the	trucking	industry.	Following	up	on	his	information,	I	spoke	with	sales	representatives
at	Stoops	and	Quality	and	was	able	to	put	together	the	pieces	on	this	transaction.


What	I	discovered	appears	to	be	"smoking	gun"	evidence	that	CGI	has	misrepresented	its
financial	performance.	In	Q1	2017,	CGI	reported	a	$1.3m	gain	on	the	sale	of	equipment.
However,	due	to	the	swap	transaction,	the	company	should	have	likely	reported	a	large
loss	instead.	Thus,	it	appears	that	management	did	not	properly	account	for	the	swap
transaction	in	its	financial	statements.	I	estimate	that	CGI	overstated	its	gain	on	sale
of	equipment	and,	in	turn,	its	net	income	by	at	least	$10m	in	Q1	2017.


This	assertion	is	supported	by	management's	apparent	attempts	to	hide	this
transaction	from	the	investment	community.	For	example,	CGI	did	not	mention	this
transaction	in	its	SEC	filings	or	Q1	2017	earnings	report.	Given	the	large	size	of	the	tractor
swap,	I	am	puzzled	as	to	why	it	was	not	disclosed.	Another	notable	example	was	that
management	recently	made	the	unusual	decision	to	block	my	phone	number	from
calling	their	corporate	offices.	As	I	will	later	explain,	it	appears	that	this	decision	was	made
in	an	attempt	to	prevent	me	from	learning	more	about	the	tractor	swap.


If	CGI	has	in	fact	overstated	its	profits	via	the	swap,	the	company	may	very	well	be	in
violation	of	its	4x	leverage	ratio	covenant	by	a	meaningful	amount.	Given	the	company's
highly	questionable	accounting	methods,	it	is	doubtful	that	it	would	receive	a	waiver	from
its	lenders	for	such	a	violation.	Thus,	I	believe	that	the	discovery	of	this	transaction	by
CGI's	lenders	could	push	the	company	into	bankruptcy.


The	bad	news	does	not	end	there.	I	have	uncovered	several	serious	additional	"red	flags"
related	to	CGI's	financial	reporting	and	business	practices.	This	includes	several
accounting	irregularities	in	the	company's	Q1	2017	financial	statements,	as	well	as
management's	increasingly	troubling	and	unprofessional	behavior.


CGI's	increasingly	precarious	liquidity	situation	also	deserves	examination.	Some
investors	seem	to	believe	that,	by	eliminating	its	lease	shortfall	advance	obligations,	the
proposed	JV	with	Element	will	fix	CGI's	liquidity	issues.	However,	in	Q1	2017,	the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 4/28


company	did	not	make	any	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	to	Element.	Despite	not
making	these	payments,	CGI	still	generated	a	free	cash	flow	loss	of	$19.8m.	Thus,
even	if	the	JV	is	consummated,	it	is	unlikely	to	solve	the	company's	liquidity	problems.


Finally,	over	the	past	few	months	I	have	received	several	emails	from	both	current	and
former	employees	of	CGI.	In	their	emails,	these	individuals	expressed	a	great	deal	of
concern	over	the	allegedly	poor	conduct	of	the	company	and	management.	Up	until	now,	I
have	chosen	not	to	reveal	these	emails	to	the	public.	However,	given	CGI's	increasingly
concerning	behavior,	I	believe	now	is	the	appropriate	time	to	disclose	some	of	them.


Overall,	given	the	mounting	red	flags	surrounding	the	company,	CGI	remains	a	highly
attractive	short	opportunity.	I	believe	that,	with	the	discovery	of	this	swap	transaction,	the
likelihood	of	an	SEC	investigation	has	increased	considerably.	Also,	based	on	my
analysis,	I	expect	the	company	to	declare	bankruptcy	over	the	next	few	months.	Thus,	I
reiterate	my	price	target	of	$0	for	CGI	shares.


Section	1:	Investors	Continue	to	Ignore	an	Increasing	Amount	of	Smoke


Before	discussing	CGI's	recent	tractor	swap	and	the	severe	negative	implications	of	this
swap	for	shareholders,	I	think	it	is	important	to	first	reestablish	the	low	credibility	of	the
company	and	its	management.


In	one	of	my	previous	articles	on	CGI,	I	warned	investors	of	the	foolishness	of	ignoring	all
the	"smoke"	surrounding	the	company.	At	the	time,	the	"smoke"	I	was	referring	to	were	the
numerous	accounting	irregularities	in	the	company's	financial	statements	and	lack	of
transparency	by	management.	I	was	also	referring	to	the	March	2016	and	April	2016
inquiries	by	the	SEC	into	the	company's	accounting	practices.


So	far,	the	market	has	continued	to	ignore	the	obvious	warning	signs	building	around	the
company.	Since	reporting	Q1	2017	earnings	on	November	2nd,	CGI's	stock	price	has
increased	by	over	35%	from	$6.15	to	$8.35	as	December	6th.	This	sharp	rise	in	CGI's
stock	price	is	puzzling	given	that	in	my	view,	the	Q1	2017	report	only	increases	the
concerns	over	its	financial	reporting	methods.


Some	of	the	additional	red	flags	which	I	have	identified	over	the	past	few	weeks	are	as
follows:


Red	Flag	#1:	Free	Cash	Flow	Continued	to	Significantly	Lag	Net	Income	in	Q1	2017

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 5/28


In	Q1	2017,	CGI's	free	cash	flow	(operating	FCF	-	capex	-	capital	lease	payments	+	PP&E
sale	proceeds)	was	once	again	significantly	less	than	its	reported	net	income.	Based	on
the	company's	own	financial	reports,	provided	below	is	a	comparison	of	the	company's
free	cash	flow	and	reported	net	income	in	Q1	2017:


As	shown	above,	CGI's	Q1	2017	free	cash	flow	was	$17m	lower	than	reported	net
income.	This	large	disconnect	between	free	cash	flow	and	reported	net	income	is	highly
concerning.	As	I	discussed	in	my	previous	articles,	when	free	cash	flow	generation
significantly	lags	earnings,	this	can	be	a	warning	sign	that	profits	have	been	inflated.


Red	Flag	#2:	Continued	Mismatch	in	Change	in	Equipment	Held	for	Sale	in	Q1	2017


In	addition	to	poor	free	cash	flow	generation,	the	quarter-over-quarter	change	in
equipment	held	for	sale	on	the	balance	sheet	once	again	did	not	match	the	CF
statement	by	a	large	amount:


In	previous	articles,	I	argued	that	CGI	is	manipulating	its	working	capital	as	a	means	to
overstate	its	profits.	The	continued	large	mismatch	in	the	change	in	equipment	held	for
sale	in	Q1	2017	further	supports	this	assertion.


Red	Flag	#3:	Puzzling	Increase	in	Other	Assets	in	Q1	2017
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: The Smoking Gun Emerges - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 6/28


Prior	to	Q3	2015,	CGI's	other	assets	balance	had	historically	been	very	small	(around	$5m
or	lower)	with	very	little	change	from	quarter-to-quarter.	However,	since	the	end	of	Q3
2015,	CGI's	other	assets	balance	suddenly	increased	exponentially.


For	example,	from	Q3	2015	to	Q4	2016,	other	assets	increased	from	just	$4.7m	to
$43.3m.	The	company	attributed	this	large	increase	in	other	assets	on	its	lease	shortfall
advance	payments	to	Element.	According	to	management,	Element	is	obligated	to
eventually	reimburse	CGI	for	these	payments.	Thus,	it	accounted	for	its	lease	shortfall
advances	as	a	receivable	in	other	assets.


In	Q1	2017,	the	company	did	not	make	any	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	to
Element.	This	was	confirmed	by	the	following	disclosures	on	pg.	13	of	its	Q1	2017	10Q:


"…lease	shortfall	advance	arrangement…	are	for	shortfalls	between	the	required
lease	payments	and	the	amount	actually	collected	from	the	independent	contractor
or	fleet…"


"The	financing	provider	is	required	to	reimburse	us	for	these	advances…"


"…we	have	accounted	for	the	related	receivable	under	other	assets	on	our
consolidated	balance	sheet,	in	the	amount	of	$31.9	million	as	of	September	30,
2016	and	June	30,	2016."


As	highlighted	above,	receivables	related	to	its	lease	shortfall	advance	payments
remained	at	$31.9m	from	Q4	2016	to	Q1	2017.	Based	on	this,	it	can	be	concluded	that
CGI	did	not	make	any	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	in	its	most	recent	quarter.


Despite	not	making	these	payments,	other	assets	on	CGI's	balance	sheet	increased
another	$3.3m	from	$43.3m	as	of	Q4	2016	to	$46.6m	as	of	Q1	2017.	This	increase	in
other	assets	makes	little	sense.	If	CGI	did	not	make	any	lease	shortfall	advance	payments
in	the	quarter,	then	why	did	other	assets	increase	another	$3.3m?


Overall,	this	puzzling	increase	in	other	assets	in	Q1	2017	further	supports	my	assertion
that	CGI	is	manipulating	its	working	capital	as	a	means	to	overstate	its	profits.


Red	Flag	#4:	Sudden	Removal	of	Accrued	Equipment	Purchase	Liabilities	from
Balance	Sheet


Another	significant	red	flag	in	the	Q1	2017	financial	report	is	the	company's	curious
decision	to	remove	accrued	equipment	purchase	liabilities	from	its	balance	sheet.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 7/28


Provided	below	is	CGI's	current	liabilities	as	of	Q4	2016	as	disclosed	on	pg.	48	of	the	FY
2016	10K:


As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	in	its	FY	2016	10K,	CGI	previously	reported	accrued
equipment	purchases	as	a	separate	line	item	on	its	balance	sheet.	Next,	I	have	provided
CGI's	current	liabilities	as	of	Q1	2017	as	disclosed	on	pg.	5	of	the	Q1	2017	10Q):


As	shown	above,	in	Q1	2017,	CGI	removed	its	disclosure	of	accrued	equipment	purchase
liabilities.	In	isolation,	this	change	in	disclosure	would	not	be	all	that	concerning.	However,
when	taking	into	consideration	recent	events,	this	decision	is	highly	suspect.


To	be	more	specific,	in	previous	articles,	I	had	pointed	out	that	the	company's	Q3	2016
PP&E	balance	was	inflated	relative	to	what	was	implied	by	its	capex,	PP&E	sale
proceeds,	depreciation	and	conversion	of	capital	leases.	In	Item	#4	of	CGI's	October	19th
response	letter,	management	provided	the	following	explanation	for	its	seemingly	inflated
Q3	2016	PP&E	balance:


"…the	balance	sheet	includes	accruals	for	equipment	purchases	that	have	been
contracted	but	for	which	cash	payment	has	not	been	made,	whereas	the	cash	flows
from	investing	activities	would	not	reflect	non-cash	activity…"


According	to	management,	the	Q3	2016	PP&E	balance	was	inflated	largely	because	of
accrued	equipment	purchases.	However,	as	I	pointed	out	in	my	rebuttal	to	the	response
letter,	accrued	equipment	purchases	cannot	explain	CGI's	inflated	PP&E	balance.	In	Q3
2016,	CGI's	accrued	equipment	purchase	liabilities	were	only	$464K.	This	is	far	less	than
the	$22m	that	the	company's	Q3	2016	PP&E	balance	appears	to	have	been	inflated	by.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 8/28


The	fact	that	management	stopped	disclosing	accrued	equipment	purchases	immediately
after	I	pointed	out	this	discrepancy	is	likely	not	a	coincidence.	I	believe	CGI	is
intentionally	hiding	this	line	item	because	it	realizes	attributing	its	inflated	PP&E	to
accrued	equipment	purchases	makes	little	sense.	Thus,	based	on	management's
recent	actions,	I	remain	highly	suspicious	of	its	PP&E	accounting	methods.


Red	Flag	#5:	Quality	Continues	to	Purchase	a	Significant	Amount	of	Trucks


In	previous	articles,	I	pointed	out	how	the	continued	purchasing	of	large	amounts	of	trucks
by	Quality	made	little	sense.	Given	the	soft	used	truck	market	and	CGI's	ongoing	liquidity
issues,	I	was	confused	as	to	why	management	would	engage	in	such	a	seemingly	self-
destructive	strategy.


Management's	puzzling	behavior	has	continued	in	FY	2017.	In	Q1	2017,	the	Quality
business	once	again	spent	a	large	amount	of	cash	on	truck	purchases.	Consider	the
following	disclosures	from	pg.	13	of	CGI's	Q1	2017	10Q:


"From	time	to	time	we	will	assign	these	leases	and	sell	the	underlying	assets	to	third
party	financing	companies.	In	addition,	we	sell	unleased	assets	in	the	used
markets."


"Total	net	proceeds	and	net	gain	as	a	result	of	these	transactions	during	the	three
months	ended	September	30,	2016	were	$52.6	million	and	$1.3	million,
respectively…"


In	Q1	2017,	the	Quality	business	generated	net	proceeds	of	$52.6m	from	truck	sales.	With
this	in	mind,	consider	the	following	comparison	of	CGI's	equipment	held	for	sale	as	of	Q1
2017	vs.	Q4	2016:


Equipment	held	for	sale	consists	primarily	of	trucks	purchased	by	the	Quality	business.	As
shown	above,	from	Q4	2016	to	Q1	2017,	CGI's	total	equipment	held	for	sale	balance
declined	by	only	$10.7m.	This	means	that	the	Quality	business	purchased	an
additional	$41.9m	worth	of	trucks	in	Q1	2017	($52.6m-$10.7m).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 9/28


In	Item	#9	of	its	response	letter,	management	provided	the	following	justification	for
Quality's	recent	truck	purchases:


"…at	December	31,	2015	we	had	commitments	to	purchase	approximately	$83.5
million	in	equipment…It	should	be	noted	that	not	all	of	the	$83.5	million	of
commitments	related	to	Quality."


Unfortunately,	based	on	recent	disclosures	in	CGI's	FY	2016	10K,	this	explanation	does
not	make	any	sense.	The	following	disclosure	is	from	pg.	60	of	its	FY	2016	10K:


"We	have	planned	commitments	to	add	$24	million	of	tractor	operating	leases	over
the	next	twelve	months	as	of	June	30,	2016.	Generally,	our	purchase	orders	do	not
become	firm	commitment	orders	for	which	we	are	irrevocably	obligated	until	shortly
before	purchase."


At	the	end	of	FY	2016,	CGI	had	just	$24m	of	tractor	purchase	commitments.
Furthermore,	the	company	expected	to	pay	for	these	commitments	with	operating	leases
rather	than	cash.	Finally,	as	described	above,	these	commitments	are	not	firm
commitments.	Based	on	this,	I	am	not	sure	why	the	Quality	business	spent	$41.9m	on
truck	purchases	in	Q1	2017.


This	all	leads	back	to	the	question	of	whether	management	is	incompetent	or	if	instead
there	is	something	more	sinister	going	on?	In	my	opinion,	it	is	the	latter.	As	I	will	discuss
later,	I	believe	Quality's	recent	truck	purchases	are	linked	to	its	tractor	swap	with
Stoops.


Red	Flag	#6:	Management's	Recent	Peculiar	Behavior	During	Earnings	Season


Another	point	of	concern	for	CGI	investors	is	management's	peculiar	behavior	during
earnings	season.	As	I	discussed	in	a	previous	article,	CGI	reported	its	Q4	2016	earnings
over	a	month	later	than	usual	on	September	1st.	When	the	company	finally	did	issue	a
report,	it	released	the	earnings	report	more	than	three	hours	after	the	market	close.	To	top
things	off,	management	made	the	curious	decision	to	not	hold	an	earnings	call	to	discuss
that	report.	This	type	of	conduct	is	highly	unusual	for	a	public	company.


This	suspect	behavior	has	continued	into	FY	2017.	When	the	company	reported	its	Q1
2017	earnings	on	November	2nd,	management	once	again	decided	to	release	the
earnings	report	more	than	three	hours	after	market	close.	This	lengthy	delay	in
reporting	Q1	earnings	caused	a	significant	amount	of	frustration	amongst	investors	and

research	analysts.	For	example,	one	research	analyst	that	covers	the	company	(whom	I
will	keep	anonymous)	emailed	me	the	following	message	expressing	his	displeasure	over
the	late	release:


So	why	is	CGI	reporting	its	earnings	at	such	a	late	time?	My	best	guess	is	management
released	its	Q4	2016	and	Q1	2017	report	well	after	market	close	in	an	attempt	to	bury	the
bad	news.	One	thing	is	certain,	this	pattern	of	obfuscation	and	opacity	by	management
has	only	further	damaged	their	credibility.


Red	Flag	#7:	Management	Blocked	My	Phone	Number	from	Calling	their	Corporate
Offices


Perhaps	the	most	concerning	recent	development	is	management's	decision	to	actually
block	my	phone	number	from	calling	their	corporate	offices.	On	November	16th,	I	spoke
with	a	couple	of	sales	representatives	from	Quality	about	their	recent	swap	transaction
with	Stoops.	My	findings	from	these	conversations	will	be	discussed	in	a	later	section.


On	November	17th,	just	one	day	after	these	conversations	took	place,	I	was	surprised	to
discover	that	my	phone	number	had	been	blocked	at	the	offices	of	both	CGI	and
Quality.	Video	proof	of	this	blocking	can	be	found	here.


This	type	of	behavior	should	raise	all	sorts	of	red	flags	for	CGI	investors.	Credible
companies	do	not	take	these	sorts	of	actions.	The	fact	that	management	blocked	my
number	just	one	day	after	I	inquired	about	the	swap	is	likely	not	a	coincidence.	Instead,	it
appears	management	is	doing	all	it	can	to	prevent	the	public	from	learning	more	about	this
transaction.	Investors	must	ask	themselves	why	management	is	so	afraid	of	the
details	of	the	swap	being	revealed.


So,	to	end	this	section,	I	once	again	plead	with	investors	and	analysts	to	stop	ignoring
obvious	warnings	signs	and	demand	more	transparency	from	management.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 11/28


The	story	of	how	I	uncovered	the	"smoking	gun"	on	CGI	began	in	early	November	when
an	individual	involved	in	the	trucking	industry	and	familiar	with	the	facts	contacted	me.	I
am	declining	to	identify	this	person	and	will	refer	to	this	source	as	"A."	A	copy	of	his	initial
email	to	me	(with	his	contact	details	redacted)	is	provided	below:


As	shown	above,	"A"	claimed	that	he	could	help	me	"put	together	the	pieces"	in	regards	to
CGI.	With	my	curiosity	piqued,	I	immediately	called	"A"	to	learn	what	he	knew.	Here's	what
he	said:


Stoops	Freightliner,	a	division	of	Truck	Country,	is	a	large	truck	dealer	with	23	locations	in
Iowa,	Indiana,	Ohio,	Minnesota,	and	Wisconsin.	According	to	"A,"	a	Stoops	dealership	in
Indianapolis	had	recently	completed	a	tractor	swap	of	around	1,000	units	with	Quality	in
September	2016	(Q1	2017).	The	fact	that	Quality	and	Stoops	exchanged	vehicles	was	not
that	peculiar.	Dealers	often	use	vehicle	exchanges	as	a	means	to	manage	their	inventory.


That	being	said,	the	sheer	size	of	this	tractor	swap	was	in	his	view	quite	unusual.	Even
more	peculiar	is	the	fact	that	Stoops	has	been	selling	the	tractors	it	received	from	the
swap	at	bargain	basement	prices.	Over	the	past	few	weeks,	a	trucking	company	that	"A"
claims	to	be	familiar	with	purchased	numerous	Quality	tractors	from	Stoops.	According	to
"A,"	all	of	these	tractors	were	priced	significantly	below	market	value.


For	example,	this	company	recently	purchased	a	2012	Peterbilt	587	from	Stoops	for
almost	$23K.	The	invoice	for	this	transaction	is	provided	below	(with	contact	details,	VIN	#
and	certain	pricing	info	redacted):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 12/28


To	prove	that	this	unit	was	part	of	the	recent	swap	with	Quality,	"A"	also	sent	me	the	title
for	this	tractor.	Provided	below	is	a	copy	of	the	signature	page	of	the	title.	(A	full	copy	of
the	title	can	be	found	here)


As	shown	above,	Quality	is	listed	as	the	seller	of	the	Peterbilt	unit,	while	Truck	Country
(a/k/a	Stoops)	is	listed	as	the	purchaser.	Also	note	that	the	date	of	the	sale	was	in
September,	which	is	when	the	swap	with	Quality	took	place.


"A"	also	sent	me	the	invoices	and	titles	for	two	additional	2012	Peterbilt	587s.	These	units,
like	the	unit	discussed	above,	were	part	of	the	swap	with	Quality.	These	two	Peterbilt	587s
were	purchased	from	Stoops	at	an	average	price	of	around	$23K	per	unit.


The	fact	that	Stoops	is	selling	the	2012	Peterbilt	587s	it	received	from	Quality	for
around	$23K	is	quite	puzzling.	This	appears	to	be	almost	50%	below	fair	market	value
for	this	model	year	and	type	of	tractor.	For	example,	on	CommercialTruckTrader.com,

To	further	illustrate	just	how	outrageously	cheap	Stoops	is	pricing	its	Quality	inventory,
consider	the	following	list	of	recent	used	tractor	purchases	made	by	one	company	from
various	dealerships	(with	contact	details,	purchase	dates,	VIN	#s,	certain	pricing	info	and
other	sensitive	information	redacted):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 14/28


Upon	receiving	this	list,	I	asked	"A"	to	help	explain	which	tractor	purchases	in	the	list	were
from	the	Quality	swap	(contact	details	redacted):


According	to	"A,"	the	used	2012	Peterbilt	587	(highlighted	in	the	red	box)	is	the	only
tractor	in	the	above	purchase	list	that	was	part	of	the	swap	(The	invoice	and	title	for	this
tractor	are	linked	above).	This	unit	was	purchased	for	less	than	$23K.	By	contrast,	the
other	2012	model	year	tractors	in	the	list	(which	were	not	part	of	the	swap)	were
purchased	at	much	higher	prices	generally	ranging	between	$30K	and	$45K.


At	this	point,	it	should	be	clear	that	Stoops	is	pricing	the	2012	Peterbilts	from	Quality	at
well	below	market	value.	That	being	said,	I	recognize	that	this	represents	just	a	small
sample	of	the	~1,000	tractors	involved	in	the	swap.	With	this	in	mind,	I	tried	to	check
whether	the	other	tractors	from	the	swap	were	being	offered	at	similar	bargain
basement	prices.	In	response,	my	source	confirmed	this	with	a	simple	"Yes."	A	copy
of	this	email	exchange	is	provided	below	(contact	details	redacted):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 15/28


In	order	to	further	confirm	the	information	I	had	culled	and	that	"A"	had	provided,	I	reached
out	directly	to	Stoops	for	more	details.	I	called	the	Stoops	office	in	Indianapolis	and	spoke
with	JT	Thornburg,	a	sales	manager	at	the	branch.


I	first	asked	Mr.	Thornburg	to	confirm	that	his	dealership	had,	in	fact,	swapped	~1,000
tractors	with	Quality	in	September	of	this	year.	He	confirmed	that	this	was	true.


Next,	I	requested	a	pricing	list	for	all	of	the	Quality	tractors	that	Stoops	was	offering.	Mr.
Thornburg	said	he	could	not	provide	such	a	list,	but	did	provide	pricing	quotes	for	a	group
of	2012	Freightliner	Cascadia	and	2012	Kenworth	T700	tractors	which	were	received	in
the	swap.	In	total,	he	estimated	that	the	2012	Cascadias	and	T700s	represented	50-100
of	the	~1,000	tractors	from	the	swap.	The	pricing	quotes	provided	by	Mr.	Thornburg	for
these	two	tractors	types	were	as	follows:


2012	Freightliner	Cascadia:	$32K-$35K
2012	Kenworth	T700:	$24K-$27K


These	price	quotes	from	Mr.	Thornburg	further	confirm	"A"'s	opinion	that	Stoops	is
selling	its	Quality	inventory	at	well	below	market	value.	For	example,	on
CommercialTruckTrader.com,	most	of	the	2012	Freightliner	Cascadias	are	listed	in	the
$40K-$50K	price	range.	This	is	significantly	higher	than	the	$32K-$35K	prices	offered	by
Stoops.	Also,	on	CommercialTruckTrader.com,	2012	Kenworth	T700s	are	listed	in	the
$35K-$45K	price	range.	This,	once	again,	is	significantly	higher	than	the	$24K-$27K	price
ranges	offered	by	Stoops.


The	final	question	that	I	posed	to	Mr.	Thornburg	was	how	his	dealership	was	able	to	offer
the	Quality	tractors	at	prices	far	below	market	value.	He	declined	to	answer	this	question.
Thus,	in	order	to	figure	out	the	final	piece	to	this	puzzle,	I	decided	to	contact	Quality's
sales	team.


Section	4:	The	Value	Destructive	Nature	of	the	Swap


I	reached	out	to	Quality's	sales	team	for	further	clarification	on	the	swap	transaction,
speaking	with	two	different	members	of	that	team.	The	first	person	I	spoke	with	claimed	to
be	a	general	sales	representative	at	Quality.	During	our	brief	conversation,	he	confirmed
that	Quality	had	completed	an	~1,000	unit	tractor	swap	with	Stoops	in	September.	When	I
asked	him	for	more	information,	he	transferred	me	to	another	individual	who	he	said	would
know	more	details	of	the	swap.
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: The Smoking Gun Emerges - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 16/28


I	was	transferred	to	a	person	claiming	to	be	the	director	of	used	truck	sales	at	Quality.	I
asked	him	why	Stoops	was	offering	Quality's	tractors	at	far	below	market	prices.	Was
there	anything	wrong	with	these	vehicles,	or	was	Stoops	simply	just	stupid?	The	response
that	he	gave	was	quite	shocking	to	me.


He	explained	that	Stoops	was	able	to	offer	the	tractors	at	such	low	prices	because
Quality	had	incentivized	Stoops	to	carry	out	the	swap.	When	I	pressed	him	for	more
detail,	he	provided	me	with	some	of	the	specifics	of	the	transaction.	He	explained	that
Quality	sent	more	tractors	to	Stoops	than	it	received	back	in	the	exchange.	By	his
estimate,	for	every	100	tractors	Quality	sent	to	Stoops,	Quality	only	received	around
75	tractors	in	return.	Thus,	because	they	were	receiving	significantly	more	value	in	the
swap,	Stoops	was	able	to	offer	the	tractors	from	the	swap	at	a	discounted	price.


This	naturally	led	to	my	final	question	of	why	in	the	world	Quality	agreed	to	such	a	value
destructive	exchange.	His	response	was	that	the	transaction	allowed	Quality	to	reduce	its
inventory	which	would	"help	calm	the	nerves	of	investors."	This	makes	little	sense.
Exchanging	higher	valued	assets	for	lower	valued	assets	does	nothing	to	ease	investors'
ongoing	liquidity	concerns	about	CGI.	Instead,	it	merely	serves	to	destroy	shareholder
value	by	reducing	the	company's	collateral	and	book	value.


So	why	did	CGI	decide	to	go	through	with	such	a	seemingly	foolish	transaction?	I	will
attempt	to	answer	this	question	in	Section	7	of	this	article.


Section	5:	CGI's	Miraculous	Gain	on	Sale	of	Equipment


Before	continuing	with	my	discussion	of	the	swap,	I	will	first	discuss	why	CGI's	reported
gain	on	sale	of	equipment	in	Q1	2017	is	puzzling	given	the	current	market	environment.


The	following	disclosure	is	from	pg.	13	of	CGI's	Q1	2017	10Q:


"…we	sell	unleased	assets	in	the	used	markets.	Total	net	proceeds	and	net	gain
as	a	result	of	these	transactions	during	the	three	months	ended	September	30,	2016
were	$52.6	million	and	$1.3	million,	respectively…"


As	highlighted	above,	in	Q1	2017,	CGI	reported	$52.6m	of	net	proceeds	and	a	net	gain	of
$1.3m	from	the	sale	of	equipment.


Due	to	the	severe	collapse	in	used	tractor	prices	over	the	past	year,	the	company's	ability
to	generate	a	$1.3m	profit	from	equipment	sales	is	highly	suspect.	Current	used	tractor
prices	appear	to	be	at	a	level	that	is	well	below	the	depreciated	value	of	the	tractors
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: The Smoking Gun Emerges - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 17/28


on	CGI's	balance	sheet.	This	is	illustrated	in	the	following	table:


CGI	depreciates	its	tractors	to	a	salvage	value	of	40%	over	a	period	of	four	years.	This
means	that	a	new	tractor	will	depreciate	at	a	rate	of	15%	per	year	for	four	years	and	then
remain	at	a	salvage	value	of	40%	of	cost	until	disposed.	The	average	price	of	a	new	Class
8	tractor	is	around	$140K.	Thus,	a	new	tractor	would	depreciate	$21K	per	year	(15%	*
$140K)	to	a	salvage	value	of	$56K	after	four	years.


Based	on	CGI's	depreciation	schedule,	the	current	book	value	of	a	model	year	2012
tractor	is	estimated	to	be	around	$56K	($140K	*	40%	salvage	value).	In	comparison,	the
average	market	value	of	a	model	year	2012	tractor	should	be	around	$40K.	This	is	more
than	28%	(or	$16K)	less	than	the	depreciated	book	value.


The	difference	between	depreciated	book	value	and	market	value	only	increases	for	more
recent	model	years.	For	example,	the	book	value	of	a	model	year	2014	tractor	is
estimated	to	be	around	$87.5K	($140K	*	(2.5	years	of	age	*	15%	annual	depreciation)).	In
comparison,	the	average	market	value	of	a	model	year	2014	tractor	is	around	$55K.	This
is	more	than	37%	(or	$32.5K)	less	than	the	depreciated	book	value.


From	this	analysis,	it	should	be	clear	why	CGI's	reported	gain	on	sale	of	equipment	makes
little	sense.	The	company	generates	a	gain	on	equipment	sales	if	the	market	value	of	the
equipment	exceeds	the	book	value.	However,	the	research	shows	that	CGI's	tractors
appear	to	be	worth	much	less	than	the	depreciated	value	reflected	on	its	balance	sheet.
Thus,	instead	of	reporting	a	$1.3m	gain	on	equipment	sales,	it	appears	that	CGI
should	have	reported	a	significant	loss.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 18/28


Further	supporting	this	assertion	is	the	fact	that	CGI's	peer	competitors	with
comparable	depreciation	schedules	have	recently	reported	losses	on	equipment
sales.	For	example,	Covenant	Transportation	(TICKER:	CVTI)	("CVTI")	depreciates	its
tractors	over	five	years	to	a	salvage	value	of	25%.	Thus,	like	CGI,	CVTI	depreciates	its
tractors	at	an	annual	rate	of	15%.


In	Q3	2016,	CVTI	reported	a	loss	of	$421K	on	the	sale	of	$5.5m	of	equipment,
representing	a	loss	margin	of	7.6%	($421K/$5.5m).	This	is	in	direct	contrast	to	the	$1.3m
gain	that	CGI	reported	on	the	sale	of	$52.6m	of	equipment.	Based	on	the	current	loss
margin	of	7.6%,	if	CVTI	had	also	sold	$52.6m	of	equipment	in	its	latest	quarter,	it	would
have	reported	a	loss	of	$4.0m.


It	is	also	worth	noting	that	CVTI's	depreciation	schedule	is	more	aggressive	than	CGI's.
CVTI	depreciates	its	tractors	to	a	lower	salvage	value	than	CGI	(25%	at	the	end	of	five
years	vs.	40%	at	the	end	of	four	years),	so	its	older	tractor	models	are	carried	on	the
balance	sheet	at	a	meaningfully	lower	value.	This	means	that	CVTI	should	report	higher
average	gains	on	the	sale	of	its	tractors	than	CGI.	This	has	not	been	the	case.


In	summary,	CGI's	ability	to	continue	claiming	gains	on	the	sale	of	equipment	is
miraculous	in	the	context	of	the	current	market	environment.	All	of	the	data	and	evidence
suggests	that	the	company	should	be	reporting	a	loss.	With	that	point	firmly	established,	I
can	now	continue	my	analysis	of	the	swap	transaction.


Section	6:	Tractor	Swap	Appears	to	Confirm	CGI	Has	Inflated	Its	Profits


The	discovery	of	Quality's	tractor	swap	with	Stoops	is	terrible	news	for	CGI	shareholders:
this	transaction	appears	to	confirm	that	CGI	has	significantly	inflated	its	profits	in	Q1	2017.


Based	on	GAAP	accounting	rule	ASC	845,	a	swap	of	equipment	is	included	in	the	P&L
as	a	gain	or	loss	on	the	sale	of	equipment.	Accounting	rules	also	dictate	that,	in	a
swap	of	assets,	the	assets	being	exchanged	should	be	marked	to	fair	value:


"In	general,	the	accounting	for	a	nonmonetary	transaction	is	based	on	the	fair	values
of	the	assets	exchanged.	Thus,	the	cost	of	a	nonmonetary	asset	received	in
exchange	for	another	nonmonetary	asset	ordinarily	is	measured	based	on	the	fair
value	of	the	asset	given	up	or,	if	more	clearly	evident,	the	fair	value	of	the	asset
received.	A	gain	or	loss	is	recognized	if	the	cost	of	the	nonmonetary	asset
recognized	differs	from	the	carrying	amount	of	the	nonmonetary	asset	given	up…"

Based	on	ASC	845,	the	accounting	for	the	swap	transaction	with	Stoops	should	have

1,000	tractors	are	sent	to	Stoops	and	750	tractors	are	received	back	in	the	exchange

The	750	tractors	received	are	marked	to	fair	value
For	example,	if	the	market	value	of	the	tractors	received	is	$40K	per	tractor,	the	total
fair	value	of	the	750	tractors	received	is	$30m
A	gain	or	loss	from	the	sale	of	equipment	is	recognized	by	CGI	based	on	the
difference	between	the	fair	value	of	the	750	tractors	received	and	book	value	of	the
1,000	tractors	given	up
For	example,	if	the	book	value	of	the	1,000	tractors	is	$60m,	then	CGI	would	realize	a
loss	of	$30m	from	the	swap	($30m	fair	value	of	750	tractors	-	$60m	book	value	of
1,000	tractors)


Basically,	if	the	fair	value	of	the	tractors	received	by	Quality	is	less	than	the	book	value	of
the	tractors	given	up,	then	a	loss	from	the	swap	should	be	realized.	If	the	opposite	is	true,
then	a	gain	is	recorded	from	the	swap.


I	believe	CGI	should	have	reported	a	significant	loss	from	the	swap	transaction	with
Stoops.	This	assertion	is	supported	by	a	couple	key	points:


First,	as	previously	noted,	the	market	values	of	CGI's	tractors	are	significantly	lower	than
the	depreciated	value	on	its	balance	sheet.	Thus,	even	if	the	swap	was	an	even	exchange
of	tractors	(1,000	tractors	for	1,000	tractors),	the	marking	of	the	vehicles	to	fair	value
would	result	in	a	large	loss	for	CGI.


Second,	the	swap	was	not	an	even	exchange	of	tractors.	Quality	only	received	around
750	tractors	for	the	~1,000	tractors	it	sent	to	Stoops.	Given	significantly	less	than	fair
market	value	was	realized	in	the	swap,	it	appears	a	near	certainty	that	CGI	should	have
realized	a	significant	loss	from	this	transaction.


Given	the	large	loss	that	CGI	should	have	realized	from	the	swap,	I	see	no	way	that
the	company	could	have	reported	a	gain	on	sale	of	equipment	in	its	most	recent
quarter.	CGI	reported	only	$52.6m	of	net	proceeds	from	the	sale	of	equipment	in	Q1
2017.	Based	on	the	large	size	of	the	swap,	it	appears	that	the	swap	should	have
accounted	for	most	of	these	equipment	sale	proceeds.	Thus,	the	gain	of	$1.3m	on	the
sale	of	equipment	that	the	company	reported	should	have	been	a	significant	loss.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 20/28


So	just	how	much	did	CGI	potentially	overstate	its	gain	on	sale	of	equipment?	I	believe	the
amount	is	likely	to	be	significant.	For	example,	if	the	company	conservatively	lost	$10K	of
value	per	tractor	from	the	swap,	it	would	result	in	a	loss	from	the	transaction	of	$10m
(1,000	tractors	given	up	*	$10K	loss	per	tractor).	Thus,	I	believe	CGI	may	have
overstated	its	gain	on	sale	of	equipment	and,	in	turn,	its	net	income	by	at	least
$10m	in	Q1	2017.


I	believe	a	$10K	write-down	per	tractor	is	conservative,	and	giving	CGI	the	benefit	of	the
doubt.	Based	on	the	large	difference	between	the	market	value	and	depreciated	book
value	of	CGI's	tractors	(as	reflected	in	the	previous	table),	the	value	lost	per	tractor	may
be	closer	to	$20K	each	or	higher.


Section	7:	Why	Is	CGI	Willingly	Destroying	Shareholder	Value?


At	this	point,	I	believe	I	have	established	the	following:


Quality	carried	out	a	swap	of	~1,000	tractors	with	Stoops	in	September	2016
(confirmed	by	multiple	sources);
Stoops	is	selling	the	tractors	received	from	Quality	in	the	swap	at	well-below	market
value	(confirmed	by	invoices	and	pricing	quotes	I	received	from	Stoops);
The	swap	is	value	destructive	for	CGI	/	Quality.	For	every	100	tractors	given	to	Stoops,
Quality	only	receives	in	return	around	75	tractors	(confirmed	by	the	director	of	used
tractor	sales	at	Quality);
This	uneven	exchange	of	value	was	agreed	upon	in	order	to	incentivize	Stoops	to
participate	in	the	swap	(confirmed	by	the	director	of	used	tractor	sales	at	Quality);	and
Revealing	this	swap	appears	to	prove	that	CGI	has	inflated	its	historical	profits.	Given
the	depressed	prices	for	used	tractors	and	the	uneconomical	nature	of	the	swap,	CGI
should	have	likely	reported	a	large	loss	on	the	sale	of	equipment	in	Q1	2017.


One	question	that	remains	unanswered	is	why	CGI	wanted	to	carry	out	the	swap	in	the
first	place.	Why	was	CGI	so	eager	to	carry	out	the	transaction	that	it	was	willing	to
incentivize	Stoops	with	such	lopsided	terms?	Over	the	past	few	days,	I	have	tried	calling
management	with	the	intention	of	asking	them	this	very	question.	Unfortunately,
management	has	blocked	my	number	so	my	access	to	them	appears	completely	cutoff.


I	asked	"A"	for	his	opinion	on	why	the	swap	took	place.	His	best	guess,	based	on
conversations	with	industry	insiders,	was	that	CGI	was	using	the	swap	as	a	vehicle
(no	pun	intended)	to	overstate	its	profits.	He	believes	that	the	company	is	significantly
inflating	the	fair	value	of	the	tractors	involved	in	the	swap.	By	inflating	the	fair	value	of	the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 21/28


tractors	to	a	price	above	book	value,	CGI	can	record	a	gain	from	the	transaction.
Ultimately,	management	does	not	care	that	it	is	losing	value	in	the	swap	because	they
know	that	the	fair	value	of	the	tractors	can	be	manipulated.


Given	CGI's	precarious	covenant	situation,	I	think	"A''s	explanation	makes	sense.	That
being	said,	it	would	be	helpful	to	hear	management's	take	on	this	matter.	I	am	calling	on
management	to	publicly	provide	more	details	about	the	swap	in	a	press	release.	Given	the
significance	of	this	transaction,	I	believe	shareholders	and	the	investing	public	deserve	to
know	more	specifics.


I	also	encourage	investors	and	analysts	to	reach	out	directly	to	CGI	management,	as	well
as	the	Indianapolis	sales	office	of	Stoops.	If	you	learn	any	new	information	about	the
swap,	please	contact	me	with	your	findings	or	leave	a	note	in	the	comments	section
below.


Section	8:	Discovery	of	the	Swap	Could	Lead	to	an	Immediate	Bankruptcy	Filing	by
CGI


So	what	does	the	unveiling	of	this	swap	transaction	mean	in	terms	of	the	company's
financial	situation	going	forward?


For	starters,	it	appears	to	confirm	that	CGI	is	a	significant	loss-making	business.	In	Q1
2017,	CGI	reported	a	net	loss	of	$2.9m	or	$0.10	per	share.	However,	due	to	the	seemingly
improper	accounting	of	the	swap,	the	company's	reported	net	loss	was	likely	understated
by	at	least	$10m.	If	$10m	is	deducted	from	the	reported	net	loss	of	$2.9m,	then	CGI
should	have	reported	a	net	loss	of	at	least	$12.9m	in	Q1	2017.


Even	more	concerning	is	the	fact	that	the	discovery	of	this	transaction	could	lead	to	a
bankruptcy	filing	by	the	company.	Lenders	may	press	CGI	for	more	details	on	this
transaction,	and	it	is	possible	that	CGI	will	be	found	to	be	in	immediate	breach	of	its	debt
covenants.


Based	on	the	terms	of	its	credit	agreement,	the	company	is	obligated	to	provide	truthful
and	accurate	financial	information	to	its	lenders.	Thus,	if	CGI	has	in	fact	inflated	its	profits
via	the	swap	transaction,	this	may	place	them	in	immediate	default.


In	addition	to	providing	truthful	and	accurate	information,	CGI	is	also	obligated	to	maintain
a	debt	to	EBITDAR	ratio	of	less	than	4x.	If	$10m	of	potentially	overstated	profits	is
deducted	from	LTM	EBITDAR,	then	this	would	place	CGI	in	violation	of	its	leverage	ratio
covenant	by	a	meaningful	amount.	A	detailed	calculation	of	the	company's	Q1	2017
leverage	ratio	is	provided	below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 22/28


Based	on	reported	results,	I	calculate	that	CGI's	current	leverage	ratio	is	4.1x	(as	shown	in
the	left	column	above).	Thus,	the	company	may	already	be	in	violation	of	its	4x	leverage
ratio	covenant.	That	being	said,	in	its	Q1	2017	earnings	call,	management	claimed	that	its
current	debt	to	EBITDAR	ratio	is	3.8x.


However,	if	$10m	of	potentially	overstated	profits	from	the	swap	are	taken	into
account,	CGI	would	likely	be	in	violation	of	its	debt	covenant	by	a	significant
amount	(as	shown	in	the	right	column	above).	Thus,	regardless	of	whether	its	current
leverage	ratio	is	3.8x	or	4.1x,	it	appears	that	proper	accounting	for	the	swap	should	place
CGI	in	violation	of	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.


Given	the	highly	questionable	nature	of	CGI's	accounting	methods,	it	is	not	certain	that
its	lenders	would	give	the	company	a	waiver	for	these	potential	breaches.	Thus,	for
these	reasons,	I	believe	that	the	discovery	of	this	swap	transaction	could	be	the	catalyst
for	a	bankruptcy	filing	by	the	company.


Section	9:	The	Tractor	Swap	May	Explain	Quality's	Puzzling	Truck	Purchases

7/18/2019 Celadon Group: The Smoking Gun Emerges - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 23/28


As	highlighted	as	Red	Flag	#4	in	Section	1,	the	continued	purchasing	of	large	numbers	of
trucks	by	Quality	in	Q1	2017	is	puzzling.	That	being	said,	it	appears	that	the	discovery	of
this	swap	transaction	may	provide	a	logical	explanation	for	these	purchases.


The	~1,000	tractors	that	Quality	gave	up	in	the	swap	with	Stoops	were	likely	recorded	as	a
sale	of	equipment.	At	the	same	time,	the	tractors	received	in	the	swap	would	likely	be
recorded	as	a	purchase	of	equipment.	Thus,	I	believe	the	more	than	$40m	that	Quality
spent	on	truck	purchases	in	Q1	2017	can	be	largely	attributed	to	the	~750	tractors	it
received	in	the	exchange.


Section	10:	An	Eventual	SEC	Investigation	Appears	Likely


In	my	opinion,	the	discovery	of	Quality's	swap	transaction	with	Stoops	has	greatly
increased	the	chances	of	an	eventual	SEC	investigation.	For	starters,	this	information
supports	my	previous	view	that	the	company	is	using	irregular	accounting	methods	to
overstate	its	profits.	As	I	just	detailed,	this	transaction	indicates	that	CGI	inflated	its	Q1
2017	profits	by	a	meaningful	amount.


The	highly	peculiar	nature	of	this	transaction	(i.e.	the	uneven	exchange	of	value)	may
likely	catch	the	SEC's	attention.	The	fact	that	CGI	is	engaging	in	seemingly	self-
destructive	business	transactions	indicates	that	something	is	not	quite	right.	Further
supporting	this	assertion	is	management's	seemingly	desperate	attempts	to	prevent	the
details	of	this	swap	from	being	made	public	(i.e.	blocking	my	phone	number	and	no
disclosure	in	either	filings	to	the	SEC,	on	its	website	or	in	investor	calls).


Section	11:	Insolvency	Appears	to	be	Right	Around	the	Corner


Due	to	its	high	amount	of	leverage	and	rapid	cash	burn,	CGI's	ability	to	remain	solvent	is
increasingly	questionable.	Over	the	past	two	fiscal	quarters,	the	company	generated	a
free	cash	flow	loss	(operating	FCF	-	capex	-	capital	lease	payments	+	PP&E	sale
proceeds)	of	$41.9m.	This	represents	a	run-rate	cash	burn	of	almost	$84m.	The	company
is	also	likely	in	violation	of	its	4x	leverage	ratio	covenant.


Based	on	management's	behavior,	it	appears	that	insolvency	may	be	right	around	the
corner.	This	desperation	is	perhaps	best	illustrated	by	CGI's	value	destructive	tractor	swap
with	Stoops.	As	I	explained	earlier,	it	appears	the	company	may	have	used	this	swap	as	a
means	to	artificially	boost	its	profits.	Management's	desperation	is	also	illustrated	by	the
expensive	equipment-backed	loans	that	the	company	has	taken	over	the	past	two
quarters	($30m	loan	in	Q4	2016	and	$15m	loan	in	Q1	2017).	I	am	not	sure	why	CGI

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 24/28


decided	to	raise	money	in	this	manner	rather	than	simply	draw	on	its	much	cheaper
revolver.	I	suspect	that	it	is	because	the	company's	ability	to	draw	on	its	revolver	may
have	become	more	restricted.


Some	investors	are	hopeful	that	the	JV	will	fix	CGI's	liquidity	issues.	However,	based	on
recent	evidence,	this	appears	to	be	a	misguided	hope.	Consider	the	following	disclosures
from	pg.	21	of	CGI's	Q1	2017	10Q:


"Recently,	our	lease	shortfall	advance	obligations	to	our	third	party	financing	provider
and	a	depressed	market	for	freight	and	used	equipment	have	decreased	our
liquidity."


"We	have	entered	into	the	MOU…	which	we	expect	will	include	the	collection	of	our
outstanding	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	and	the	elimination	of	further	lease
shortfall	advance	obligations."


"if	we	are	successful	in	eliminating	these	payment	obligations,	then…	we	do	not
expect	to	experience	significant	liquidity	constraints	in	the	foreseeable	future."


As	shown	in	the	above	quotes,	management	has	attributed	its	liquidity	issues	on	its
lease	shortfall	advance	payment	obligations	to	Element.	Management	also	claims	that
if	its	proposed	JV	with	Element	is	consummated,	then	the	company	should	no	longer	have
any	liquidity	issues.	Unfortunately,	these	claims	do	not	appear	to	be	true.


As	I	demonstrated	in	Section	1	(Red	Flag	#3),	in	Q1	2017,	CGI	did	not	make	any	lease
shortfall	advance	payments	to	Element.	Despite	not	making	any	of	these	payments,
the	company	still	burned	through	$19.8m	of	free	cash	flow	in	the	quarter.	This
means	that	CGI's	core	trucking	business	appears	to	be	burning	cash	at	a	rapid	rate.
Thus,	even	if	the	JV	is	consummated,	it	is	unlikely	to	fix	CGI's	liquidity	issues.


Also,	it	is	unclear	why	CGI	did	not	have	to	make	any	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	in
Q1	2017.	Based	on	the	low	utilization	of	Element's	trucks,	the	company	should	have	made
a	meaningful	number	of	these	payments	in	the	quarter.	Thus,	it	is	logical	to	believe	the
company	avoided	paying	this	obligation	because	it	simply	does	not	have	the	necessary
liquidity.	This	is	yet	another	sign	of	a	desperate	financial	situation.


Section	12:	Current	and	Former	Employees	Come	Forward
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: The Smoking Gun Emerges - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 25/28


Over	the	past	few	months,	both	current	and	former	employees	of	CGI	have	reached
out	to	me	to	express	their	concerns	over	the	conduct	of	the	company	and
management.	Initially,	I	was	reluctant	to	release	their	emails	publicly.	However,	given
CGI's	increasingly	concerning	behavior	(as	evidenced	by	the	swap),	I	think	it	is	important
for	investors	to	know	the	full	story.


The	first	email	that	I	will	disclose	is	from	a	former	employee	of	the	company.	I	received	his
email	on	October	12th,	shortly	after	the	release	of	my	second	article	on	CGI.	His	message
to	me	(with	his	name,	contact	details,	date	of	departure	and	unconfirmed	allegations
redacted)	is	provided	below:


As	shown	from	the	message	above,	this	individual	claimed	to	have	recently	left	the
company	due	largely	to	the	issues	which	I	pointed	out	in	my	previous	articles.	He	also
pointed	out	additional	issues	related	to	CGI	which	I	was	not	aware	of.	I	have	redacted	out
these	new	allegations	since	I	am	in	the	process	of	investigating	them.


The	most	concerning	information	that	I	received	was	from	someone	who	claimed	to	be	a
current	employee	of	CGI.	In	the	interest	of	protecting	his	identity,	this	individual	referred	to
himself	as	John	Doe	in	his	email.	He	even	created	a	separate	email	address	for	the	sole
purpose	of	communicating	with	me.


A	copy	of	"Mr.	Doe"'s	initial	email	to	me	is	provided	below	(with	his	contact	details
redacted):
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: The Smoking Gun Emerges - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4029070-celadon-group-smoking-gun-emerges 26/28


Over	a	series	of	eight	emails	to	me,	this	individual	revealed	some	things	about	CGI's
business	practices	which,	if	true,	are	extremely	concerning.	I	am	currently
investigating	his	allegations,	so	I	have	kept	most	of	his	specific	allegations	confidential	for
now.	Any	meaningful	developments	on	this	investigation	will	be	provided	in	a	future	article.


That	being	said,	based	on	my	analysis	of	CGI's	financial	reporting	methods,	I	feel
comfortable	in	revealing	one	specific	claim	made	by	"Mr.	Doe."	In	one	of	his	emails	to	me,
"Mr.	Doe"	stated	that	he	"knew	for	a	fact"	that	CGI	was	not	accurately	reporting	its	losses
to	investors.	His	full	statement	on	this	matter	is	provided	below:


"When	it	comes	to	accounting	methods,	I	have	little	knowledge	of	the	specifics	of
how	they're	doing	things	within	the	accounting	division.	But	that	being	said,	I	know
for	a	fact	that	the	loss	they	advised	for	the	past	year	is	greater	than	what	they
are	admitting."


The	above	statement	by	"Mr.	Doe"	supports	my	analysis	that	CGI	has	overstated	its
historical	profits.	A	full	copy	of	the	email	which	contains	this	particular	claim	by	him	can	be
found	here	(with	allegations	under	investigation	redacted).


The	fact	that	"Mr.	Doe"	would	go	out	of	his	way	to	create	an	alias	for	the	sole	purpose	of
emailing	me	information	about	CGI	is	very	telling.	It	suggests	that	he	believes	the
company's	conduct	is	so	concerning	that	the	public	needs	to	know	about	it.


Once	again,	this	all	leads	back	to	my	previous	point	about	the	danger	of	ignoring	obvious
warning	signs.	Investors	would	be	foolish	to	ignore	the	concerns	of	someone,	like	"Mr.
Doe,"	who	appears	to	have	intimate	knowledge	of	CGI's	operations.


Before	ending	this	section,	it	should	be	noted	that	I	have	no	way	of	confirming	whether
"Mr.	Doe"	actually	works	at	CGI.	That	being	said,	the	stunning	amount	of	detail	provided	in
his	emails	strongly	suggests	that	he	is,	in	fact,	a	current	employee.

Conclusion


The	discovery	of	Quality's	swap	transaction	with	Stoops	is	the	strongest	evidence	yet	that
CGI	has	misrepresented	its	financial	performance	to	shareholders	and	the	investing
public.	Also,	based	on	this	discovery,	it	appears	that	the	company	is	currently	in	breach	of
its	credit	agreement	and	is	at	risk	of	declaring	bankruptcy	over	the	next	few	months.
Finally,	the	concerning	emails	I	received	from	individuals	claiming	to	be	current	and	former
employees	are	another	indication	that	CGI	is	engaging	in	questionable	business	practices.


As	I	have	demonstrated	through	four	lengthy	articles,	there	are	so	many	red	flags
surrounding	the	company	that	it	simply	boggles	the	mind.	Up	until	this	point,	investors	and
research	analysts	have	mostly	ignored	these	signs	of	trouble.	Hopefully,	the	concerning
revelations	in	this	article	will	lead	them	to	take	these	warning	signs	more	seriously.


I	continue	to	believe	CGI	is	the	best	short	opportunity	I	have	come	across	this	year.	Thus,
I	continue	to	recommend	shorting	CGI	shares	or	selling	shares	if	you	are	an	existing
shareholder.


Disclosure:	I	am/we	are	short	CGI.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving
compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is
