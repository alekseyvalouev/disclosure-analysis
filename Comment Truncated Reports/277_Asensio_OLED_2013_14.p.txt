The Real Origins of Universal Display’s OLED
claims.


Posted on October 8, 2013 by asensio.com


Tuesday, October 8, 2013.   Investors continue to hang-on to


Universal Display Corporation’s (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) claim that


it owns patents on inventions that assure its participation in OLED’s


future. But what exactly does UDC claim it invented and when and


where did it make and patent these inventions? Below we present


our review of UDC’s disclosures describing its claims and inventions


and the experiments that UDC alleges backs up these claims.


First we compiled a list claims that UDC has made to investors and


patent offices led by UDC’s so called dramatic OLED invention.


These are what UDC sometimes calls its “key PHOLED technology


patents” and other times its “Universal PHOLED phosphorescent


OLED technology.” Then we conducted an exhaustive investigation


of UDC’s disclosures describing the experiments and results that it


says support these claims. The disclosures detailing UDC’s


experiments and their results are a lot simpler and much more


straightforward than the language that UDC used to write about its


alleged breakthrough discoveries. As we all know the real story is


often remarkably simple.


Investors may not know that the real origins of all of UDC’s


identifiable claims originate from government-funded experiments


conducted by two undistinguished college professors performed


almost 20 years ago.


As shown below and in an accompanying report titled “Technical


Observations on UDC’s Underlying Experimentation” UDC’s


experiments were not breakthroughs but routine laboratory work


following the prescribed instructions known to yield the results


obtained. Yet this simple laboratory work and entirely

unremarkable results are the basis for the only UDC patents that


have any discrete identifiable economic value.


A U.S. federal government agency, the Defense Advanced Research


Projects Agency (“DARPA”) provided funding for research into


OLEDs from 1994 to 2002. It was this government-funded research


that provides the sole basis for UDC’s ‘key patents.’ Even though


UDC claims to have made a dramatic breakthrough, a review of the


DARPA experiments done by a leading expert shows that UDC


conducted no fundamental experimentation that used any new


theories, equipment, observation methods, materials, or OLED


architecture. UDC merely used existing materials and architectures


and routine prescribed laboratory methods that are, at best,


commonly referred to as optimization work. UDC built one example


of one OLED using one combination of existing materials and


architecture following methods developed by others.


The OLED and phosphorescent OLED fields rest on real


fundamental breakthroughs in the study of ultrafast chemical


reactions that date back to the 1970s. Tellingly, UDC itself has


admitted in its legal defense that OLEDs were common before it


commenced its experimentation and the any materials and


architecture used in a fluorescent OLED were easily transferred to a


phosphorescent OLED, and has even admitted that the only


difference between a fluorescent OLED and a phosphorescent OLED


is the type of material used in the emissive layer.


Based upon our interviews with an expert and other confirming


sources, at the time that UDC made its breakthrough claims, OLEDs


had already moved well past the theoretical development stage and


were at a highly developed stage of scientific field of research.


Work on ultrafast chemical processes, an area requiring more


complicated experimental methods and measurements than the


laboratory work performed by UDC, had been on-going for over 30


years. As a result, there was a great deal of comparable


experimental information available on the work done in the DARPA


project. Any independent informed expert can give an investor a


clear layman’s explanation of the routine and unremarkable nature


of UDC’s OLED from a viewing of a UDC slide show presentation


disclosing the laboratory work it performed, which is attached to


the 2002 DARPA report. An earlier 1998 version of the DARPA report


is available here.


A companion report gives specific details and instances of the


routine, optimizing nature of the DARPA experiments.


The findings of our review stand in stark contrast to the


promotional claims of UDC. In the final DARPA report, UDC


scientists claimed to have “made a significant difference in the

prospects of OLEDs.” UDC scientists claimed that the project’s


“largest breakthrough” occurred in 1998 and that this was using


iridium to produce light in a process called phosphorescence, made


possible by a “chemical suite developed by our team.” UDC


reiterated these promotional claims in a September 29, 2011 filing


with the EPO, claiming to have been the inventor of a “class of


phosphorescent organometallic iridium compounds” that were


“nothing other than a dramatic breakthrough, opening a new field


of OLED technology.”


As we show in our report titled “UDC’s ‘glaring confessions’


contradict its claims. Confessions were made unbeknownst to


investors and analysts,” under pressure from the EPO’s supreme


adjudicators, clearly in hopes of saving some sort of claim it can


continue to use in this stock promotion, UDC itself has now backed


away for the only real claims listed above, which is of having


invented a chemical compound.


Based on our review, there was no real breakthrough in the DARPA


experiments; it was trial and error, with no invention that was


predictable. It was simple optimization. The mundane nature of


UDC’s laboratory work supports the position that UDC’s OLED


claims will be revoked after the November EPO hearing and that


their revocation will trigger undisclosed termination clauses in


UDC’s 2011 Samsung agreement.
