Globalstar: Elements Of Promotion
Oct. 30, 2014 10:00 AM ET44 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Even after a recent drop, Globalstar is still up 7x from its 2013 lows. Yet the
financials have deteriorated to the point of functional insolvency.


Globalstar has all the elements of promotion: mostly retail investor base, lack of top
20 research coverage and a volatile share price with no support.


Understanding the promotional elements may tell us more about the future share
price than trying to understand the technology alone.


In the past, I have written about very similar promotions that fell by 60-80% once
exposed.


A few weeks ago, Kerrisdale Capital gave a presentation delivering its short thesis on
Globalstar Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSAT). Prior to rumors of Kerrisdale's presentation, Globalstar
had been trading at close to $4.00, with a market cap of nearly $4 billion.


After a wave of back and forth conference calls and presentations by Kerrisdale and
Globalstar management, the stock bottomed at $1.56 - a decline of nearly 60% in two
weeks.


Since then, the stock has rebounded slightly to just over $2.00. The question now
becomes how to play Globalstar. The stock is still down 40% since pre-Kerrisdale, but
investors must remember that the stock is up from just 30 cents in 2013. As a result, the
stock is still up 7x since just last year, even as the company's financial results have
become increasingly strained.

It is very clear that Globalstar is in financial distress. But the first question that investors
should ask is "just how deep is the distress ?"


And the second question that investors need to ask is "is Globalstar a simple stock
promotion ?" Kerrisdale had originally called Globalstar the biggest stock promotion since
the implosion of multi billion dollar Sinoforest. However, the information presented by
Kerrisdale focused mostly on the technological shortcomings of Globalstar's product
offering within wireless spectrum and provided less detail about what made the company
a likely stock promotion.


How deep is the financial distress ?


Even a cursory look at Globalstar's financials shows that the picture is grim. This is very
clearly the reason why the stock was trading as low as 30 cents just last year.


Revenues from Globalstar's satellite offering have been relatively flat for several years
now, with only minor growth since 2011. But by 2013, losses had swelled from $55 million
to almost $600 million. And in the first 9 months of 2014, the company reported over $900
million in losses already. This is clearly not a sustainable situation.

The biggest problem is that Globalstar has over $600 million of debt and generates little to
no operating cash flow. Against this, Globalstar has only $24 million of cash. Globalstar
already has a working capital deficit (a negative current ratio), such that short-term
liquidity is already becoming visibly problematic. Long-term liabilities also exceed long-
term assets.

In short, this is a company that is in very deep and dire trouble. On paper, it is already
functionally insolvent, while it faces over $600 million in debt.


This is clearly why the stock was trading at 30 cents just last year. But investor
enthusiasm and reports from two small brokerages have focused on Globalstar's holdings
in wireless spectrum. It simply comes down to the fact that hopes for a multi billion dollar
monetization of these holdings are what propelled Globalstar from 30 cents to over $4.00
and a $4 billion market cap. Without that hope, we would be right back to 30 cents again
due to the company's functional insolvency.


Is Globalstar a stock promotion ?


Kerrisdale's presentation focused heavily on the technological aspects of Globalstar's
holdings in wireless spectrum and then came to the conclusion that they are largely
obsolete, unneeded and will ultimately become largely worthless. As a result, Kerrisdale
predicted a default on the $600 million in debt, a bankruptcy and a stock price of zero.


What immediately struck me about Globalstar is that this type of detailed technological
analysis can often be seen to be largely unnecessary. Globalstar does in fact possess all
of the elements of a classic stock promotion. In the past, I have exposed a number of very

similar promotions and watched as their share prices declined by as much as 80%.


But in doing so, I consistently did not bother to engage in much debate about the merits of
the companies' claimed technologies.


I have seen many investors spend considerable amounts of time trying to research,
understand and quantify the technological claims made by stock promotions. It is a
process that can go on endlessly. There are always arguments to both sides, and typically
neither side is willing to concede on their views.


What I have found instead is that when all of the elements of a stock promotion are
present, then a debate over the technology quickly becomes a moot point.


Today, I will look at three past stock promotions, which I have exposed, each of which fell
by 60-80% once the hype subsided. It should be noticed that when I wrote these articles, I
did not need to spend much time at all debating the company's underlying claimed
technology. Instead, all I had to do was confirm that they possessed many of the typical
elements of stock promotions. Following a sharp run up, they were almost guaranteed to
fall.


(Note: Seeking Alpha has launched a beta version of a performance tracker. This version
measures performance based on the closing stock price AFTER articles such as mine
have come out. It is designed to measure the opportunity that investors had to make
money. When I talk about share price changes, I refer to the change since the last close
BEFORE my articles came out. This demonstrates the overall level of mispricing that was
present pre article.)


I will then show how Globalstar shares all of the common features of these stock
promotions.


When one takes a step back and looks at the big picture, it is easy to feel very foolish for
being taken in by a stock promotion. In fact, they are all variations on a very similar and
basic theme, as follows:


A small company with a consistent history of financial failure suddenly develops a new
game changing technology, which it oddly happened to acquire very cheaply. The
overwhelming majority of investors who come to understand this get rich opportunity
happen to be unsophisticated retail investors. While there is almost always some level of
institutional involvement, it is the exception rather than the rule. In the broader sense,
large numbers of institutional investors for some reason could not figure it out. The
valuation soars to unprecedented levels despite very shaky underlying fundamentals.

Mainstream research analysts refuse to cover the stock, but one or more boutique
specialists back the stock with hyper bullish forecasts in anticipation of investment banking
revenues.


Clearly, this description applies quite precisely to Globalstar. But it also applies in almost
identical fashion to at least a dozen other stock promotions, which I have written about.
The ones I focus on today are Organovo (NASDAQ:ONVO), Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL)
and Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON), each of which declined by 60-80% following my articles.
(Click on the links to read my past articles).


The first clue: overwhelming reliance on retail investors


When a small cap company has institutional holdings of less than 50%, it should be
considered a major red flag. For larger companies, such as the then $4 billion Globalstar,
this threshold should be set even higher at perhaps 80-90%. To be clear, for a company of
Globalstar's size, we should normally expect at least 80-90% (or more) of the stock to be
held in institutional hands.


Instead, Globalstar has institutional holdings of just 36%. Although there are clearly some
institutions who have bought in, it is tiny for such a large company. Note that this 36%
applies to the free float, which represents all shares available to the public to buy. It does
not count insider ownership.


Heavy reliance on retail does not guarantee the existence of a stock promotion. But it
should be considered a red flag and as a reason to keep looking for further evidence.


Low institutional ownership was my first reason to evaluate each of Organovo, Uni-Pixel
and Neonode. It was why I continued looking for further evidence.


The second clue: The pot of gold is always at the END of the rainbow


Were it not for a get rich quick opportunity in wireless spectrum, Globalstar would likely be
trading back at around 30 cents. It is pure faith that is holding the company afloat.


This is a factor that all stock promotions have in common. The underlying equity is worth
nearly nothing (other than the value of any cash), but the value of the stock is greatly
inflated based on enthusiasm. The contrast is always stark.


The other factor that is common is that investors have been convinced to ignore multiple
years of consistent failure, because the hoped for end game is expected to change
everything.

Shares of Neonode had soared to over $9.00 based on the hype that they were about to
begin doing business with tech giants LG and Samsung. It was not a lie. Neonode was in
fact doing business with these tech giants. Unfortunately, as I pointed out, Neonode had
been doing identical business with very similar tech giants for years and had never
managed to break a profit. The technology simply did not offer a meaningful profit
potential. As this became apparent, the stock imploded to below $2.00.


In a separate instance, shares of Organovo had soared to nearly $14.00 on hopes that it
would revolutionize the world of drug development with 3D printed liver assays. But
Organovo's technology had been around for years. In Organovo 1.0, the stated mission
was to sell completed 3D bioprinters. When this failed, Organovo began positioning itself
as Organovo 2.0, selling 3D printed testing assays. Once the market began to understand
that this was also less than viable, the company repositioned itself as Organovo 3.0, which
would focus on running testing itself. In the meantime, the share price has fallen by 60%.

We can see the same repositioning with Globalstar. First, the company was poised to
dominate communications via satellite as soon as it emerged from bankruptcy. As
investors got tired of ever ballooning losses, the company repositioned the focus to the
multi-billion dollar spectrum opportunity.


In 2012 / 2013, shares of Uni-Pixel rose from $8.00 to as high as $42.00 based on nothing
more than hype about a similar end game opportunity. As with the examples above, Uni-
Pixel had acquired some very cheap technology and over a period of years had failed to
deliver any meaningful results


When I wrote about Uni-Pixel, it was at a time when many other investors were debating
and hyping it, using very deep and sophisticated analysis of their supposed technology. I
didn't bother debating them on the technology. Many readers were furious that I could
issue such strong and negative outlook on the company without ever engaging in the
debate on its technological merits. The stock has now crashed by more than 80% since its
peak. It was simply a promotion.

To me, this was very simple. I had identified all of the elements of a stock promotion, such
that whatever the hype was about the technology was likely to be more of a distraction
from what really mattered. This is exactly what we are now seeing with Globalstar.


Many retail investors are now busying themselves by reading up on the ins and outs of
TLPS and FCC spectrum auctions and approvals. Instead, they should really be taking a
further step back to see if it is purely a stock promotion.


The third clue: lack of mainstream analyst coverage


Prior to the report from Kerrisdale, Globalstar was a $4 billion company whose stock had
soared at the time by more than 10x since the previous year. Yet there is still a noticeable
lack of any meaningful research coverage. Not a single top 20 investment bank covers the
stock.


Investment banks do not make money off of their research. But they do use research as a
lead in towards making other revenues. Research leads to sales and trading activity,
which generates trading commissions. It also can lead to investment banking revenues by
establishing relationships with management.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2616765-globalstar-elements-of-promotion 10/21


Even when a company is marginal, it is quite common for top 20 banks to initiate with a
"hold" or "neutral" recommendation just so that they can begin to generate trading
commissions or investment banking fees on the name


The point is that for a company of this size, it is extremely unusual to see that not a single
top 20 investment bank is willing to provide any research coverage.


It is not surprising that banks would not initiate with a "sell" recommendation. Sells, by
nature, end up applying to a much narrower audience (typically only those investors who
already happen to own the stock). And clearly initiating with a sell rating is not likely to
generate investment banking relationships.


This is not to say that there is zero coverage at all on Globalstar. But the only two houses
providing research coverage on Globalstar are two tiny boutique firms, Chardan Capital
and Odeon Capital. Not surprisingly, both of them rate it a "buy" and see the stock as a
double or triple from current levels.


This was also the case at both Uni-Pixel and Neonode. Just like Globalstar, these
companies managed to attract coverage from a small boutique investment bank and get
ratings, which predicted multi bagger returns in the near term simply by echoing
management's bullish sentiments.


In both cases, the bank focusing on these names was Craig Hallum, which is in a similar
tier as Chardan and Odeon. There was also a high focus on retail.


Uni-Pixel received share price targets as high as $58, which sent the stock on a tear from
$8.00 to as high as $42.00 (intraday) in just 6 months. Retail investors were in a frenzy.
Not surprisingly, as the stock peaked, Uni-Pixel sold $35 million of stock at $32.00 (via
Craig Hallum of course), setting the stage for the stock to decline. The stock quickly began
its descent and now trades for around $5.00, down by around 80% from its peak.


This game can be played again and again with retail heavy, speculative names. Not long
thereafter, Hallum rated Neonode a $10.00 stock, sending the stock itself to $9.00. Again,
by being the only research provider, Hallum was easily tapped to lead the inevitable equity
offering. Neonode raised money at $6.50. The stock now trades for around $2.00.


A quick flip through Chardan's equity coverage universe reveals that it tends to focus on
fairly speculative names with a high frequency of multi-bagger targets.

For investors in Globalstar, understanding the dynamics of such small brokerages can
help them steer clear of the pump. For those who are interested in finding good short
opportunities, these types of coverage lists can be a goldmine.


A few years ago, fortunes were made by investors who took the naïve approach of simply
shorting any Chinese reverse merger, which had coverage from Rodman & Renshaw.
More recently, I have done well by frequently shorting names, which have aggressive
targets by Craig Hallum.


The point is that when ALL of the mainstream research providers refuse to provide
research on a multi-billion dollar company, leaving only 1-2 small, hyper bullish, retail
focused boutiques, it points strongly to a promotional stock.


The fourth clue: what does the share price action mean ?


When I wrote about Organovo in November of 2013, the stock was approaching $14.00
intraday. The market cap was over $1 billion. The article I wrote was not in any way
sophisticated. Instead, I simply highlighted that there was already existing competition that
had been on the market for almost two years with a product that was functionally identical.
Organovo was not set to release its own product in development for at least another year.


This simple revelation on my part coincided with a drop of nearly 40% in two days on this
billion dollar company.


It was not the strength of my argument that caused the drop. It was the uncertainty and
lack of thorough research by those who were in the stock. Even this simple revelation
came as a major shock to these investors, including the institutions who were in the name.
This is the only way to explain the violent sell off.


We can see the same phenomenon with Globalstar, and it is largely a function of the first
three clues. It is clear that retail will seldom have a very deep understanding of a
complicated technology play. But if there were a stronger instructional base, then it would
be almost impossible to see the stock implode by 60% in just 2 weeks. If these investors
had done thorough research and had any conviction in the name, they would clearly have
been buying more not letting the stock get cut in half. Both Chardan and Odeon have
made efforts to defend the stock. But given the fact that they are smaller boutiques and
that there are no top 20 banks to chime in, the research support has been largely
ineffective.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2616765-globalstar-elements-of-promotion 12/21


In short, the steepness of the decline itself helps to show that the underlying support for
this stock was very weak indeed. It is itself another signal that this was more of a
promotion than a fundamental play on a sound technology.


Conclusion


I have made it a point to pay close attention to all of the presentations and conference
calls by both Kerrisdale and Globalstar management. I have listened to the experts that
each side has produced. But what it comes down to is that the investment case for
Globalstar is not based on the technology. It is based on the promotion.


Globalstar is still up by nearly 8x since its lows of 2013, despite the fact that its financial
condition has deteriorated to the edge of functional insolvency. Globalstar is hemorrhaging
money at a rate, which cannot continue.


Aside from the dramatic spike in the share price, the elements that accompany it speak
loudly to promotion. For some reason it has largely been retail investors who have bid up
the stock while most institutions (with a few exceptions) have largely not been interested.
It is an investment story where we are told to fully ignore the dismal present, because
there is supposedly a huge back-end-loaded payoff in the future. Yet there are no top 20
investment banks willing to provide any coverage to this supposed opportunity; only two
small and ultra bullish boutiques are interested. Finally, the ease with which the share
price was toppled speaks loudly to the lack of conviction that is held by those in the stock.
This typically tells us that the investment case is weak and has been only lightly or poorly
researched.


Despite the initial 60% drop in Globalstar, it has only shown a slight bounce on short
covering. At current prices, Globalstar remains a compelling near-term short.
