Galectin Therapeutics is a development stage biotechnology company that is developing
drugs for fibrotic diseases and cancer. From the GALT website:


Galectin Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on discovery and
development. We apply our leadership in galectin science and drug development to
create new therapies for fibrotic disease and cancer. Drug candidates based on our
unique carbohydrate technology target galectin proteins, which are key mediators of
biologic and pathologic function.


GALT has strong ties to well known stock promoters, and has been paying for campaigns
targeting retail investors and retirees. GALT has been paying for these campaigns and
has done significant capital raises on the back of these promotions. Since these
promotions have begun, GALT's stock has more than doubled and volume has exploded.
But first, some history.


The History of What Is Now Galectin Therapeutics


What is now Galectin Therapeutics was founded in 2000 as Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Adam Feurstein provided some color in his Biotech Mailbag on Pro-Pharmaceuticals all
the way back in 2010. While one shouldn't hold what happened to Pro-Pharmaceuticals
against GALT, it does provide some interesting context. GALT's story begins on May 26,
2011, when Pro-Pharmaceuticals changed its name to "Galectin Therapeutics." That's
when the current GALT story began.


The Promoters Enter The Scene

From the time of the name change up until TDM Financial began getting paid to promote
the stock, GALT was a sub $5 stock that traded sparsely. The promotion worked, as
GALT's stock has nearly tripled since TDM Financial began targeting retail investors and
retirees. Since the promotion began GALT has used the strength in its stock to do a $100
million offering which included a 500,000 share sell from Richard Uhilein. How do we
know GALT is targeting retail investors and retirees? TDM Financial has provided a "case
study" on its website of the GALT promotional campaign complete with a quote from
GALT's chairman.


The stock has gone up partially on the back of numerous press releases such as this one,
which have been written by Emerging Growth Corp.


TDM Financial said GALT hired them to:


"Galectin Therapeutics Inc. engaged TDM Financial on July 12, 2013 to broaden and
enhance their shareholder base, as well as reach an audience of sophisticated
individual and institutional investors, through a combination of dedicated list
mailings, targeted content syndication, and other forms of measurable and effective
outreach."


Under the "Audiences Targeted" section of the report, TDM Financial says that they are
targeting retail investors and retirees.

TDM Financial goes on to boast that its campaign increased the price of the stock and its
visibility.


The promotion has continued to work, if one measures the success of a promoter by an
increasing stock price. This is clearly being done by retail investors buying into the
constant flow of positive press releases.


Indeed GALT has continued to steadily pay TDM Financial for its services, having paid
$35,00 since the beginning of the promotion.

So how do we know Emerging Growth Corp is also TDM Financial? Well it's pretty easy. It
all goes back to one Daniel Minton of Whitefish, Montana. Daniel Milton's LinkedIn page
shows that he is the owner of TDM Financial.

Using the State of Montana's LLC search to search for "Emerging Growth Corp." one sees
that Daniel Milton is listed as the registered agent for this entity. An interesting note, while
Emerging Growth Corp. has been promoting stocks for well over a year now, the LLC was
only two months ago.

If you're still not satisfied that TDM Financial is Emerging Growth Corp, going to
emerginggrowthcorp.com should settle it for you. Going to that web address takes you to
TDM Financial's website.


Who Else Has Emerging Growth Corp. Promoted?


You can see the full list of stocks that Emerging Growth Corp (a/k/a Daniel Milton) here.
As you can see it is a list mainly comprised of penny stocks. Just in the last month Mr.
Milton has promoted these stocks through his Emerging Growth Corp.

As you can see, most of these are truly penny stocks with microscopic market caps. Can
you spot the outlier? (It's GALT). So why is GALT using a penny stock promoter for
"marketing services"?


Another Penny Stock Promoter Has Been Involved


Having connections to one stock promoter is bad enough, but GALT has ties to another
stock promoter. This time the stock promoter is Patrick Cox, who also promoted PVCT
right before the stock plunged 90%. Patrick Cox has promoted numerous biotechs, here is
an interview in which he touts several biotechs including GALT. As BuyersStrike points
out, Patrick Cox has colorful background. This is Patrick Cox. This is Patrick Cox calling
GALT a company that will "change the world." Here is a picture of Patrick Cox.


Who Owns The Stock? (Hint - The promotion has worked)

The promotion has targeted retail investors and retirees, among others. And that's
basically who owns the stock. Institutional ownership is very low and insiders have been
selling stock.


Institutional ownership is just 16% of the float.

Insiders Selling The Stock


Over the last twelve months there have been a total of 17 insider buys in the open market,
while there have been 16 insider sales in the open market. While that doesn't sound too
bad, according to NASDAQ, insiders have bought less than 15,000 shares while they
have sold 700,000 shares in the last twelve months.

GALT R&D Spend vs. General & Administrative Spending


Since the name change to Galectin in 2011, GALT has never spent more on R&D than it
has on General & Administrative (G&A).


If you look at other biotechs in similar positions they are spending substantially more on
R&D than they are on G&A. For example, Sarepta (NASDAQ:SRPT) spends around $2 in
R&D for every $1 it spends on G&A.


Tuesday's Announcement


On Tuesday, July 29th the company will announce the findings from its Cohort 2 of Phase
1 in the Clinical Trial of GALT's main drug, GR-MD-02. This cohort will be dosed with twice
the level of Cohort 1. Only 8 patients are in this Cohort. If the data is positive the stock will
likely go up, if negative it will go down. This article is not attempting to forecast the results
of an 8 person Cohort in a Phase 1 trial, but rather to examine the background of those
involved with GALT.


Summary


They say you judge the character of a person by those with whom they associate. If that
holds true with corporations, then GALT has been associating with penny stock promoters
that have pushed all sorts of subpar companies on retail investors and retirees. Perhaps
