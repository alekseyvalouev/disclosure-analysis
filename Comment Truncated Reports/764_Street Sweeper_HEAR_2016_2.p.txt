Turtle Beach: Digging The Hole Even Deeper
Sep. 28, 2016 11:51 AM ET28 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Turtle reverse-merged into a company holding old, unwanted technology. After
holding on a couple of years, Turtle finally realizes it's a losing proposition and
announces restructuring plans for the division.


With cash dwindling to $1 million, Turtle is left to try to squeeze profit from the
troubled gaming headset division.


Turtle's headsets are largely ignored by reviewers and many are doomed to discount
bins. Meanwhile, gamers are playing on their phones, eliminating the need for
consoles and headsets.


Net revenues in the first half of the year are down dramatically from 2013. Net losses
have more than doubled.


Return on equity and profit margins are far worse than the rest of the industry.
Institutional ownership is extremely low. Additionally, Turtle has disclosed a material
weakness in financials.


Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR) has forgotten Will Rogers' famous quote: "If you find
yourself in a hole, stop digging."


The San Diego, California headset company has dug itself into a money pit that
necessitates the desperate restructuring of its HyperSound business. But in our view, the
effort will only prolong the misery, as Turtle creeps toward further decline. Let's look at
nine reasons TheStreetSweeper expects more Turtle troubles.


1. Reverse Merger Grabs Old, Unwanted Technology


Turtle became publicly traded in January 2014 via a reverse merger stock swap with
Parametric Sound Corp. (PAMT), whose technology centered on directing sound waves in
a narrow beam.


MDB Capital underwrote Parametric just prior to the merger. TheStreetSweeper has
written about the decline of other companies underwritten by MDB Capital, including Uni-
Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) and Resonant (NASDAQ:RESN).

Parametric had traded as a penny stock until it conducted a 5-for-1 reverse stock split in
early 2012. Parametric received the money-losing HSS technology through a 2010 spin-
off from LRAD Corp., which had grown tired of the unappreciated tech. LRAD CEO Tom
Brown said, "we have been unsuccessful in developing a market for HSS, [and] we have
no current plans to invest further resources in it."


That technology has been around nearly two decades now and has been very slow to
commercialize. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration cleared HyperSound for
marketing to people who wanted 
improved "clarity and comprehension of sounds."


This is where the odd story gets even odder.


2. HyperSound Gets Off To A Bad Start


So with the FDA's clearance in hand, Turtle might have been expected to rush off to target
audiologists or consumers with hearing impairment. But no. They went after gamers.


Turtle chose to commercialize by launching HyperSound embedded in displays of
Activision's videogame Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in around 1,000 Best Buy stores.


By then, the 11-year-old Advanced Warfare series was showing signs of decline, Forbes
warned Activision investors. Franchise fatigue had set in for many fans, and they
demanded something new and different - but HyperSound didn't fit the bill.


The bad news had just begun for Turtle's effort. Best Buy soon endured a drop in
customer traffic, despite aggressive, expensive promotions. Within two years of Turtle's
display launch, the retailer closed 50 stores, and has continued to quietly close stores
through the present.


In short, after HyperSound had been abandoned, Turtle turned around and mis-marketed
it. But it took a long time before Turtle decided the other guys were right.


3. Guess What Gets Restructured?


Fast forward to recent days. Now Turtle has decided it's time to restructure - something
that is virtually always the beginning of the end.


Indeed, Turtle announced Sept. 26 the restructuring of its money-gobbling legacy product
HyperSound.

Though the announcement may have surprised investors, there were plenty of signs that
Turtle was getting fed up - or at least should have been getting fed up - with this
technology the company hitched itself to just before its IPO. In fact, the company has
repeatedly noted that HyperSound has done nothing but create operating losses:


Our HyperSound business has not generated significant revenues, has a history of
operating losses, expects additional losses and may not achieve or sustain
profitability. [source]


Our HyperSound business has incurred operating losses since the spin-off of
Parametric Sound Corporation from LRAD Corporation in 2010, and we expect
additional losses in the near-term as we continue to expend significant resources on
personnel, consultants, intellectual property protection, research and development,
marketing, production and administration. [source]


Even as HyperSound continued to drag on the company, leaders talked up the technology.


CEO Juergen Stark said during the Q1 2015 earnings call:


The quarter was also highlighted by good progress for the launch of our HyperSound
healthcare products scheduled for later this year.


Turtle seemed to shift focus from the weird idea of marketing HyperSound to gamers to:


...executing the successful launch of our HyperSound hearing product. Our
groundbreaking in-home solution for helping people with hearing loss to better
understand and enjoy TV, music and other media.


But Turtle seemed to shift focus again months later. The Q4 2015 earnings call
concentrated on the headset business (initially held by the parent holding company) and
away from the bothersome legacy product...So we should have expected that
restructuring announcement that came about two months later.


There will be lots of slicing and dicing, considering the company last year invested a
whopping $11.6 million to commercialize HyperSound and add some headsets to its
lineup.


So if HyperSound ever had a speck of potential we can safely assume it's just about all
gone. And potential isn't the only thing that's coming up short.

4. Cash-Poor


Imagine having to operate a business on one-sixth the cash that was available just six
months ago. That's Turtle's situation. Turtle is running out of cash:


(Source: Company SEC filing)


The company had about $12 million in revolving and term loans on June 30, 2016. Excess
borrowing availability is $4.9 million. But it looks like some sort of capital raise will be
needed in the future.


But what is the potential for the remaining business - gaming headsets?


5. Headsets: Once Moldy, Now Ignored


Turtle's headset business has been troubled and still looks uncertain.


Just last October, the company had to recall ~$6 million worth of its next-generation
gaming headsets due to mold problems.


(Source: US Consumer Product Safety Commission)


With this recall well behind Turtle Beach, its headsets still weren't mentioned in the 2016
headset review by PC Gamer:

The headsets were also excluded from the review shown below:

And Turtle's product barely squeaked by to earn last place in PCMag's review:


The reviewer commented: "Turtle Beach's Ear Force Stealth 450 is an affordable and
functional wireless gaming headset, but it's a solid example of getting what you pay for. It
doesn't sound bad and it doesn't feel cheap, but it pales in comparison with the Editors'
Choice Logitech Artemis G933. If you really want a wireless headset, the G933 or the
Skullcandy PLYR 1 ($149.99 at Amazon) are much better options, though more
expensive."

*6. Bargain Basement Discounts


Fierce competitors' new cutting-edge products often send older, less desirable products
straight to the discount bin. And that's what Turtle is enduring with some of its products,
according to an Amazon search:


In some cases, customers were picking up Turtle's headsets at discounts as steep as
47%.


7. Smartphone Trend Weakens Opportunity

Entertainment Software Association has been tracking an interesting trend. The group
found that a whopping 36 percent of the most frequent gamers play on their smartphones.


That means Turtle products will face additional challenges as more and more gamers play
video games on their smartphones, turning up their noses at video consoles that require
headsets.


If that trend continues as expected, Turtle could see a continuation of another unfortunate
trend...


8. Losses Increase


Turtle is seeing increasing net losses. While net revenue did increase 26% in the first half
of the year, net losses more than doubled:

While the industry is recording horrible profit margins over the past 12 months, Turtle's are
even worse:

When we look at how many dollars of profit Turtle generates for each dollar of
shareholders' equity, we find that return on equity is poor:

The institutions must have seen all the signs, and decided they don't want Turtle.

9. Material Weakness Revealed


Last, but not least, Turtle revealed in its most recent 10-Q (see page 35) that the company
has "identified a material weakness in [its] internal control over financial reporting" that has
not yet been remedied. This is not only a confidence-killer but could lead to issues such as
late filings, restatements, and even suspension or delisting from the Nasdaq.
