Globalstar: TLPS In Perspective
Nov. 20, 2014 9:30 AM ET26 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Support for TLPS was the brainchild of John Dooley of Jarvinian.


The background of Dooley and Jarvinian show the risks of unbalanced optimism for
unproven technologies.


Other wireless constituents continue to line up against Globalstar with the FCC.


I continue to be fascinated by the action surrounding Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT). The
stock has been very volatile as a largely retail investor base tries to handicap the odds of
spectrum riches vs. bankruptcy vs. distressed financing.


Jim Cramer recently highlighted the risks of Globalstar, sending the stock down a quick
15%. It was notable that Cramer did not try to handicap the prospects for the company's
technology. CEO James Monroe (who has recently been buying stock) subsequently
appeared on Cramer to support the stock, but so far the share price has not been
cheered.


In my past articles, I also deliberately tried to take a step back and evaluate Globalstar
without delving into the technological minutia. I believe that there are bigger picture
issues, which dominate the equation and that many people who are spending their time
trying to decipher all of the techie details are missing the forest for the trees.


Today, however, I am looking at a technology aspect. But I am doing it in a different way
so as to provide additional perspective for those who are trying to piece together the TLPS
puzzle. Specifically I am looking at the origins and history of Globalstar's involvement with
TLPS and the involvement of the entity known as Jarvinian.


Back in January of 2013, Globalstar had a share price of around 30 cents and the
company was basically in tatters. TLPS was the "brainchild" needed to resuscitate the
company. But it was not the brainchild of Globalstar itself.


As mentioned on a January 2013 webinar, General Counsel L. Barbee Ponder said:

Now I'm pleased to be joined by John Dooley of Jarvinian. The TLPS opportunity is
his brainchild, and we are grateful for all of his technical assistance in making
TLPS a reality this year.


It should be noted that elsewhere within this webinar, Ponder noted that TLPS was on
track to become a "reality by the end of the year." Yet as we are approaching 2 years
out, we still have no TLPS reality.


In order to better understand the prospects for TLPS, it is instructive to evaluate its history
with Dooley and Jarvinian.


The key point from all of this is that Globalstar has relied heavily on Dooley and his
Jarvinian to sell investors on the TLPS concept. In fact, it appears that they may
have largely oversold Mr. Dooley as well as the TLPS concept.


Mr. Dooley is still heavily involved with the TLPS concept. Following the presentation of
the short thesis by Kerrisdale Capital, Globalstar held a lengthy conference call to rebut
the negative sentiment. Dooley was the key speaker on this call and his remarks were in
fact more than twice as long as those from CEO Jay Monroe. This led to some confusion
among listeners who assumed that Mr. Dooley must be a Globalstar employee. In fact, he
is not.


On the conference call, CEO Monroe introduced Dooley as "the founder and managing
director of Jarvinian, a spectrum and advisory practice that has been working with
Globalstar for the last several years to develop the concepts around TLPS."


Mr. Dooley wrote the technical appendix to Globalstar's 2012 petition for rulemaking. But
his background there is relayed in a different context:


I, John Dooley, am Managing Director of Jarvinian Ventures, a wireless investment
fund. I am an Engineer with 17 years of experience in the development of advanced
wireless technologies. I am qualified to provide the opinions and analyses presented
in this Declaration. Under penalty of perjury, I hereby declare that the preceding is
true and correct to the best of my information, knowledge, and belief:


So the first question about Jarvinian is: is Jarvinian a spectrum and advisory
practice working for Globalstar, or is it a fund pursuing its own objectives as it
stated to the FCC?

Finding out much about Dooley is a bit of a challenge. Mr. Dooley did author several self-
promotional articles on himself on Wikipedia, but these were deleted after the self
promotion was highlighted by other users. It appears that Dooley was using aliases ("B
Manohar") to attempt to try to create buzz around his own name (i.e. pretending to be
someone else) before being discovered. Clicking on the link and viewing the history of
changes to the article makes this clear.


Despite the curious background, Globalstar's recent conference call presented him with
significant accolades. But it appears that they largely oversold their conference call expert,
saying that he:


· Developed regulatory and technological solutions for the reformation of previously
unusable RF spectrum


· Assisted Globalstar in developing TLPS, made possible with Globalstar satellite
spectrum


· Developer of a regulatory and engineering solution for Terrestar, opening up
unanticipated new 4G spectrum in L-Band


· Founder of Nanoton; created advanced nanomaterials enabling next-generation wireless
filters and antennas


· Holds numerous patents in wireless and intelligent computing technologies


In fact, Terrestar (OTC:TSTRQ) is a pink sheets traded company which is also being
restructured. It business description states that Terrestar "seeks to launch a wireless
communications system to provide mobile coverage throughout the United States and
Canada using integrated satellite-terrestrial smartphones." But so far, there has been no
petition for rulemaking and Terrestar is currently realizing revenues of just $3 million per
quarter while losing $60 million per quarter at the bottom line.


Nanoton sounds very advanced, stating that it is "developing advanced nano-polymer
filtration capabilities for next generation wireless networks." But its website still refers to
Jarvinian's old office address, as it has since 2010. The only real press release to come
out of Nanoton was in January 2013, at the same time as the Globalstar webinar, which
stated that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 4/15


Jarvinian Wireless Innovation Fund has begun a long-term development and
investment relationship with Nanoton, a producer of high performance nanomaterial
derived RF filtration for wireless infrastructure. Jarvinian will help Nanoton accelerate
the availability of high-selectivity filtration, which is critical to the efficient utilization of
new spectrum.


Basically, it is a company, which is not engaged in commercial activity, which is simply
founded by one arm of Dooley to interact with his other arm, Jarvinian.


As for the "numerous" patents, Mr. Dooley has received three according to Google's
patent search function. One in each of 1995 (expired), 2007 and 2013.


But Jarvinian and Dooley were clearly very important to the October 9th Globalstar
conference call. A majority of the technical diagrams and analysis were directly sourced
directly to information supplied by Jarvinian. This can be seen in the footnotes on each
exhibit.


Jarvinian has been involved in a back and forth battle with the Engineers for the Integrity
of Broadcast Auxiliary Services Spectrum also known as EIBASS. In 2013, EIBASS wrote
Ex Parte comments to the FCC accusing Jarvinian and Globalstar of violating the terms of
its test licenses by not contacting the relevant broadcasters for interference coordination.
Jarvinian's role is mentioned specifically throughout.


EIBASS has taken an aggressive stance against Globalstar's testing of TLPS, stating
(emphasis added):

In its reply comments, Globalstar once again incorrectly claims that the issue
of grandfathered TV BAS Channel A10 at 2,483.5-2,500 MHz is a settled issue.
It is not.


What is important is that this Globalstar filing constituted an acknowledgement, at
long last, of the fundamental incompatibility between grandfathered TV BAS
Channel A10 operations and MSS ATC operations. Adding AWS-5/TLPS only
aggravates the problem.


Globalstar did not entertain the notion of frequency coordination being able to avoid
interference between BRS1 base stations and MSS ATC base stations, even
though both would be fixed-site stations. Why? Because the MSS handsets that
would communicate with MSS ATC base stations are mobile devices, triggered by
subscribers making telephone calls, web surfing, or other data requests, whose
time-of-use and location is never known in advance. It is the identical conflict for co-
channel grandfathered TV BAS Channel A10 ENG operations and MSS ATC/AWS-
5/TLPS.


The response and rebuttal from Jarvinian on behalf of Globalstar can be found here.


EIBASS's latest filing from November 2014 with the FCC can be found here. ABC and
CBS Television networks have already come out in support of EIBASS's position, stating:


This letter is filed on behalf of the ABC Television Network ("ABC") and CBS
Television Stations ("CBS") in support of the ex parte comments of the Engineers
for the Integrity of Broadcast Auxiliary Services Spectrum ("EIBASS")… ABC and
CBS wish to emphasize the critical role that BAS spectrum in the 2450-2500 MHz
band, namely BAS Channels A8-A10 ("BAS Channels"), plays in the coverage of
sports events and other events of public importance, e.g., breaking news, coverage
of emergency situations, etc.


The ABC and CBS filing with the FCC can be found here.


The battle has continued, even after the short thesis, which has been presented by
Kerrisdale.


According to tvtechnology.com, "EIBASS Warns of Globalstar TLPS Interference Propose
2 GHz Wi-Fi said to pose problems"


The article notes that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 6/15


A group of engineers who actively rally for Broadcast Auxiliary Service spectrum say
a proposed Wi-Fi service in the 2 GHz band would interfere with BAS. Globalstar
of Covington, La., is proposing to build a terrestrial, low-power broadband network
on its licensed spectrum at 2,483.5 to 2,495 Mhz….


The Globalstar ex parte filing spends pages explaining how TLPS/AWS-5 would be
compatible with existing 2.4 GHz S-band WiFi operations, while ignoring how
newcomer co-channel AWS-5 operations would avoid interference to grandfathered
A10 TV pickup stations in many of the major metros, such as Boston, Chicago,
Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City, Miami, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Sacramento, San
Francisco and other areas," the Engineers for the Integrity of Broadcast Auxiliary
Service Spectrum said, also in an ex parte filing.


While the headlines focus mostly on Globalstar, the Ex Parte filings themselves have a
heavy focus on the involvement of Jarvinian in conducting the testing.


For those who are determined to try to handicap the outcome of the FCC decision making
process, I strongly encourage them to have a read through all of the Ex Parte filings,
which can be found here.

Jarvinian and Dooley have a long history of ambitious plans. There is heavy marketing of
the ideas and a strong sales pitch, but ultimately results have traditionally failed to appear.
So far, this has also included Globalstar's TLPS.


In 1993, prior to Jarvinian, Mr. Dooley filed for a patent for a "space lattice passive
repeater," or SLPR. The goal of this was to reduce interference from local cell base
stations.


In 1996, he founded Novatics, Inc. and appointed himself CEO. By June, he had assigned
his SLPR patent to Novatics. The website has since been taken down for Novatics, but a
snapshort of it from archive.org reveals heavy promotion of this idea. For example, there
was the following "press release":


New Technology Allows Wireless Operators to Untether Broadband Internet


New York, NEW YORK - The Novatics corporation will today announce the unveiling
of Conduit3G, the Wireless industry's first new model for system development in
over two decades.


"Conduit3G represents a dramatic leap forward in network capabilities," says John
Dooley, Director of the Novatics Advanced Systems Group. "For the first time, we
will truly have to [sic] ability to bring high capacities and advanced applications, such
as broadband Internet, to wireless users. Up until this point, many were questioning
whether the promises made regarding mobile videoconference and Internet
browsing were going to be viable. Conduit3G removes any doubt - such things are
now possible with our technology.


Five years later, in 2006, Dooley was still posting white papers and a "pre-market
technology briefing and disclosure."


Like the TLPS concept at Globalstar, the need for Conduit3G was portrayed as being both
indispensable and imminent. But I can find no reference to the technology having been
adopted in practice.


Likewise, other projects came up with fancy sounding names and terminology, but which
never ultimately resulted in any commercial activity. There was the "the Hyper-Sensitive
RF Transducer Project," "the recently announced 5-Year Initiative," and "ultra-massively
parallel supercomputing."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2698015-globalstar-tlps-in-perspective 8/15


The point is that, just like with Globalstar's TLPS, there has been a tendency to present
the adoption of new wireless technologies as being certain and imminent. The results then
fail to materialize.


As with TLPS, the estimation of the timing appears to be right around the corner. There
are subsequent delays. Then it is dropped altogether.


In 2004, the Novatics stated that "Fully [sic] availability of Novatics technology for next-
generation commercial wireless networks can be expected by Q4 2005 in nearly all
markets." But by 2005, it was "by Q1 2006." Then in 2006, it was "by Q2 2007." This was
the case until, 2009, when the Novatics website was finally taken down.


The point is that we can also see from the predecessor to Jarvinian a history of over-
excitement and hype for an imminent technology adoption, which never happens.


I have no doubt that Mr. Dooley and Jarvinian hold the same level of excitement towards
TLPS as they have with their past technological predictions. But if the past is any guide,
then TLPS likely faces a challenging future.
