Deer Consumer Products Shares Halted After Factories Idled

Yesterday, August 13, 2012, the Nasdaq halted trading in Deer Consumer Products
(NASDAQ:DEER) until the company has "fully satisfied Nasdaq's request for additional
information." I applaud the Nasdaq's decision, coming over a year after I first questioned
DEER here, here, and here. In today's report, I will show the likely reason DEER was
finally halted.


Background


Deer Consumer Products has reported spectacular growth in sales from its Chinese
domestic kitchen appliance manufacturing business each of the last four quarters, as well
as reiterated truly stunning 2012 sales guidance, as shown in the following table:

Subsequent to the publication of this report, on 8/30/12 I obtained evidence of a small
amount of ongoing production activity at the newer of the two Yangjiang facilities
amounting to perhaps 5% of the facilityâ€™s capacity.

Most recently, on August 3, 2012, I had an independent third-party investigator visit
DEER's two Yangjiang factories. He noted that there was no sign of any production
activities or workers other than security and maintenance personnel.


Two photos from his visit appear below.

The glaring questions are now:


1) How long ago were DEER's factories shut down?


2) Why were they shut down if manufacturing kitchen appliances is as profitable as DEER
claims?


3) Why was there no 8-K disclosing the factories were shut down?


4) How many historical 10-Qs and 10-Ks need restatement?


Some clues can be found in DEER's SEC filings. Consider DEER's reported headcount at
year-end reported in its 10-K filings and reflected in the following table:


According to its 2011 10-K, at 12/31/11, DEER had only 437 employees (excluding sales
and marketing staff), a decline of 78% from the prior year, despite a 29% increase in
revenue. This contradicts the growth and earnings continuously reported by DEER and
touted by Benjamin Wey of New York Global Group as the "world's largest producer of
blenders and juicers."


Likewise, DEER's reported employee welfare expenses reported in its 10-Qs have fallen
to almost nothing in recent quarters, hardly indicative of a growing world-class company
as shown in the following table:
