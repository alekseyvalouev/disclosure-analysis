Executive Summary

Quick Research Highlights Driving Our Strong 
Sell Opinion And 50% - 60% Downside Target: 


PTC’s Conversion Story From Perpetual Licenses To Subscription Model Is Late To The Game, And An Excuse For Management 


To Explain Away Poor Results And Deteriorating Economics. Its Conversion Uses Gimmicks And A Questionable Value 


Proposition To Compel Users To Subscribe


Investors Are Ignoring PTC’s Weak Financial Results In Favor of Dubious Metrics Such As “Bookings”, “ACV” and “Unbilled 


Deferred Revenue” – Read The Fine Print, They Have No Correlation To Future Revenues. We Even Spoke With PTC’s Former 


EVP of Sales To Ask His Opinion What These Metrics Mean, And He Couldn’t Explain Them. We Can’t Even Find Evidence That 


PTC’s $20M Mega Deal With The Air Force (It Booked And Said Closed In Q4’16) Even Exists With PTC As The Prime


PTC Is Acting As If It’s Distressed. The Company Is Dangerously Levered, Just Did A Stealth Credit Amendment In Q1 After It 


Burned Cash For The First Quarter In Recent History, Has Largely Tapped Out Its Revolver, Has Too Much Cash Trapped 


Internationally, And Is Now Having To Fund Its Negative Working Capital Position


PTC’s 5 Yr. Recurring Restructuring Odyssey Appears To Be An Elaborate Accounting Scheme To Sell Investors On 


Meaningless Non-GAAP Figures. We’ve Done A Deep Dive Analysis And Are Shocked By PTC’s Overstatement Of Office 


Locations, And Irreconcilable Employee Headcounts. Are They Just Firing And Re-Hiring People To Expunge Expenses? We 


Believe Its Restructuring Directly Violates SEC Guidelines Given Its Inability To Make Reliable Estimate. PTC’s CFO Was Chief


Accounting Officer At Autodesk During A Period It Had an SEC Investigation And Said Its Financials Could No Longer Be Relied 


Upon 


PTC Has Squandered $585 Million On Its Internet-of-Things (IoT) Acquisition Spree. PTC’s IoT Is Nothing More Than A Highly 


Promoted, Low Growth, Money Losing Business Used To Distract Investors From Its Core Legacy Business Issues. Management 


Is Promoting Misleading Organic Growth And Can’t Get Its Market Share Figures Straight. We Estimate Organic Growth Below 


9%. Analysts Expect 30-40% Growth. Its Market Share Appears To Be 10%, Not 18%-28% Touted By Third Party Reports  


While All Analysts Say “Buy” Six Insiders Have Stock Sale Programs, And They Only Own 1% Of The Company. Analysts’ See 


Upside To $60 (+12%), But We See 50% - 60% Downside As Our Long-Run View. This Represents A Terrible Risk/Reward For 


Owning PTC’s Shares. PTC Is Trading At Peak Valuation With Little Covenant Cushion; Careful Investing To All….

Spruce Point Believes PTC Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


PTC (“PTC” or “the Company”) Is A Legacy Computer-Aided Design Software and Solutions Provider to Engineers, 


Manufacturers, and Others. In Our Opinion, PTC Is Struggling To Transform Itself And Masking Financial Distress By 


Heavily Promoting a SaaS Conversion “Story” And Hyping Its Low Growth, Money-Losing Internet of Things (IoT) Business


 PTC is showing many signs of an old-line technology company struggling to transform (Note: its name + ticker change from Parametric 


Technology (PMTC)). Spruce Point has a successful history exposing similar stories such as NCR and Sabre. With PTC, the similarities 


are striking. On the surface, the Company’s transformation appears wildly successful. Since PTC started its SaaS conversion story in 


FY14, and accelerated the move in FY16, its “Bookings” – an obscurely defined measure management steers investors towards - are 


up 6x, and significantly outperformed PTC’s guidance in FY16. As a result, PTC’s shares surged almost 100% from its early 2016 lows


 Investors are blinded by meaningless bookings, and ignoring the large GAAP vs. Non-GAAP discrepancies. PTC’s actual GAAP 


financial performance rapidly deteriorated in FY16. Part of the deterioration is explained by the short-term effect of the model transition. 


Subscription sales carry lower upfront costs than a fully paid perpetual licenses, so as a result there is a natural short-term depression 


of sales and EPS from this transition. PTC and its analysts’ believe that its results have bottomed, and it is set to have a rapid 


acceleration of earnings and cash flow; there are indications that this simply isn’t the case


 We believe that there’s more than just conversion dynamics suppressing results, and underlying disruption is occurring in PTC’s 


business from new competitors at much lower price points (free!). PTC’s long-term GAAP/Non-GAAP EBIT and EPS divergence total a 


stunning $933m and $7.15 per share since 2012. PTC’s working capital recently turned negative, it burned cash flow in Q1’17 for the 


first time, had to borrow on its credit facility to fund itself, make a credit amendment, and has limited remaining borrowing capacity. 


These results speak volumes about PTC’s fragile financial condition. The Company is highly levered at 3.5x Debt/EBITDA


 PTC effectively pulled forward FY16 results with gimmicks such as a Win-Back program (the name in and off its self tells you that PTC 


is losing out) which pushed maintenance users to take a subscription and inflated bookings. We believe many users were forgoing the 


expense of maintenance; PTC is now compelling them to take a subscription which includes maintenance. Although nothing has really 


changed, it allows PTC to inflate its bookings metric.  The true organic progress of PTC’s conversions are impossible to discern. PTC 


defines its own, non-standard metrics, such Annual Contract Value (ACV), and Unbilled Deferred Revenue to spin its story. Read the 


fine print: these metrics have almost no relevance to expected revenues. For PTC to extract any value, its customers have to stick with 


a subscription for 4+ years, yet the average customer contract is just 2 years. If customers churn, PTC is toast. Most transition models 


don’t succeed, and we have plenty of examples 


 PTC even introduced a “rule of thumb” to monitor the impact of its bookings impact on Sales and Non-GAAP EPS, yet this rule is a


moving target, and a caveat was added that the analysis cannot be reconciled to GAAP results. Major red flag! The last company we 


exposed that said it couldn’t model its results to GAAP was Sabre Corp, which recently cut cash flow guidance twice. PTC’s conversion 


story looks nothing like others we’ve analyzed. The most unusual aspect of PTC’s model change is that its Deferred Revenues aren’t 


growing – another major red flag.
7


Spruce Point Believes PTC Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


PTC Is Intentionally Obfuscating Or Not Disclosing Many Traditional Metrics Used To Evaluate Its Business


 PTC used to provide reasonably good information to investors in its excel spreadsheet posted on its investor relations website. A 


tab in the file called “Supplemental Data” would regularly disclose information such as Active Support Seats, Quota-Carrying Sales 


Reps, and deal size figures. These figures and are no longer provided. We think we know why: by analyzing the data leading up to


its omission, revenue per Active Support Seats and per Quota Rep was in secular decline


 PTC sales are conducted either directly through its sales force, or through indirect channel partners (aka VARs). PTC used to


provide the split of direct vs. indirect sales in its SEC filings, but stopped this practice. However, the Company still provides the % 


split in its Supplemental Data tab. To our dismay, these percentages do not reconcile to historical SEC filings and suggest potential 


$30-$50m of revenue misstatement. This fact caused us to take a deeper look into PTC’s channel partners. By using the Wayback 


machine to see total resellers listed on PTC’s website, we find significant shrinkage from FY11–FY16 of 440 to 253 or 43% 


 PTC’s vanishing resellers and sales quota reps omission supports our view of PTC as a melting ice cube. The reason that PTC’s


resellers are shrinking may be explained by a recent program guide we found on the PTC User Community website. PTC wants 


resellers to pay it upfront for selling subscriptions, which amounts to asking resellers to provide it financing. PTC reserves almost 


nothing for allowance for doubtful accounts, which again points to offloading cash collection to its partners. PTC pretends its DSOs 


are improving, but when adjusted for receivables buried in “other current assets” the DSO is stubbornly high 


Perpetual Restructuring Charges, Segment Shuffling, Reclassifications + Other Signs of Unreliable Financial Reporting


 PTC has been taking restructuring charges now for 5 years totaling >$230m. Its assets are nothing more than people, computers


and offices, yet it cannot seem to optimize itself correctly. Part of the issue, is that PTC has embarked on a reckless and expensive 


acquisition spree. Since 2011, PTC has made 11 acquisitions totaling $1.1bn (many to build its Internet-of-Things (IoT) hype 


machine (more on this coming up)). We’ve successfully argued that the best way to evaluate any roll-up strategy is to evaluate 


free cash flow after acquisition costs (See reports on our website: LKQ, Ametek, Echo Global Logistics). We find no evidence yet


that PTC has extracted any value from these deals, especially in light of having its weakest cash flow quarter in Q1’17


 More to the point of restructuring charges, we find worrisome issues by looking carefully at the nature, composition, and impact of 


these programs on results. To illustrate, PTC appears to be getting lower return on investment (measured by opex savings) per


cash cost of executing its restructuring programs. It is now even guiding to growth in operating expenses due to planned 


investments…huh? We also have difficulty reconciling employee headcount figures, while accounting for employees acquired from


acquisitions, and those explicitly identified for termination or “repurposing” – PTC’s total employee count is down just 1.5% in the 


same period it has taken massive charges. Is the Company just firing and re-hiring employees to expunge expenses?
8


Spruce Point Believes PTC Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


 If PTC were really executing on its restructuring program and optimizing its assets, we wouldn’t find so many discrepancies with its 


operational footprint. For example, PTC discloses in its Annual Reports its total square footage under the discussion of its 


properties. We find a net increase in total office square footage from FY11-FY16 despite reporting fewer offices. Furthermore, PTC 


cannot seem to reconcile its global office locations. To illustrate, using the Wayback machine, we find a systematic overstatement 


of office locations disclosed in its Annual Report vs. office locations listed on its website; the discrepancy is currently a 35% 


overstatement, which cannot merely be dismissed as a small oversight


 In light of the fact that PTC dramatically ramped up its guidance for restructuring charges in FY16, and cannot get its numbers 


straight, heightens our fear that its restructuring charges are nothing more than a means to flush expenses through the income 


statement. The SEC says that companies have to reliably estimate a restructuring program, yet PTC appears unable to do so. As


part of PTC’s Non-GAAP figures, it asks investors to ignore these charges as an add-back to results. Its last restructuring program 


had charges totaling 10% of Adjusted Operating Expenses and 7% of sales. Now that PTC states its restructuring program is 


“materially complete” it puzzles us that its restructuring accrual still amounts to $25m. Shouldn’t it be $0?


 In addition to recurring restructuring, PTC has a dizzying amount of reclassifications and segment reporting changes. Due to 


recent changes, PTC stopped disclosing how it allocates these restructuring charges (along with other pertinent financial 


information such as segment depreciation, capital expenditures, etc.) across its business units. It appears to place it in violation of 


ASC 280 Segment Reporting. In our view, this augments or concerns that PTC’s restructuring program could be bogus. In 


addition, it appears obvious to us that PTC’s last segment reorganization stuffed more expenses into the “unallocated” line item, 


which serves to flatters the reporting of “segment profit” for each of its businesses


 There’s plenty of additional evidence to suggest weak financial controls. For example, in October 2016 PTC had to file an 8-K to 


correct its GAAP guidance because it “inadvertently omitted interest expense” – oops small oversight! Earlier in the year, PTC 


settled with the Dept. of Justice and SEC for $28m related to a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation of payments by former 


employees to Chinese official between 2006 and 2011. 


 PTC has often disclosed that “We are currently under audit by tax authorities in several jurisdictions.” Finally, investors are starting 


to see the magnitude of the issue. In Q4’16, PTC revealed a $12m payment to Korea tax authorities. PTC has tried to save taxes 


by reorganizing its European operations through Ireland (dissolving the Atego acquisition), but has left a sloppy trail and continues 


to act as if Atego is in operation. In the process, PTC’s GAAP and Non-GAAP tax rate seem meaningless. Its income statement 


shows tax benefits (allowing inflation of its EPS), but in reality PTC continues to spend $25m-$30m in cash taxes

Spruce Point Believes PTC Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


Management's Promotion: All Aboard The CEO’s Internet-of-Things (IoT) Hype Train


 Another way PTC has diverted attention from its struggling core business is by attaching itself to the IoT “story” - the latest buzz 


business high on hope, but short on growth and profits. PTC’s CEO Jim Heppelmann has all the markings of a stock promoter, 


and not an operator. To illustrate, he uses promotional language such as “thought leader” and “big dog” when describing himself 


and PTC. If this doesn’t make you pause, consider the fact that Mr. Heppelmann promotes his IoT thought leadership via articles 


on the topic co-authored by Harvard professor Michael Porter. However, what PTC doesn’t widely disclose is that Mr. Porter was 


a director and received fees from PTC. In other words, Heppelmann’s Harvard thought leadership looks like a paid-for promotion


 When it comes to spending money, PTC is not shy about spending big money to chase a dream. PTC’s foray into the IoT space 


is largely acquired and exhibiting all the elements of an overly promoted failure. PTC’s IoT business is the combination of five


expensive acquisitions (Axeda, Kepware, ThingWorx, ColdLight, Vuforia) totaling $585m, and purchased at an average 7.5x 


revenue multiple. The multiple could be justified only by exponential growth, but sadly there is none


 Either having loose lips, or intending to over-promote, PTC’s CEO recently proclaimed that its IoT business had 53% organic 


sales growth. However, based on our detailed analysis, we estimate that its true organic growth is a meager 8.6%. Single digit 


revenue growth and a money losing operation that isn’t scaling should not get any investors excited about PTC’s promotional IoT 


business. At the ~8% organic growth rate, it will take PTC 10.5 years to achieve $200m in revenue, a run rate the CFO claims is 


the breakeven point. Will investors wait this long? Apparently, the executives of the companies acquired by PTC are not willing to 


wait for the big upside that PTC promotes. We observes that many of the key founders and executives have already jumped ship,


while PTC is trying to recruit “evangelists” to promote its dreams 


 PTC cites every research paper it can find to spin the story that IoT is growing 30%-40% p.a and that it is a market share leader. 


Yet, in its recent March 2017 IoT presentation it cut its addressable market size from $1.1bn (2014) to $900m (Today). At PTC’s 


current LTM IoT segment revenue of $90m, it has just 10% market share, not the 18%-27% the reports its cites claim. PTC’s 


claims of being a “thought leader” are equally as dubious. There are substantial competitors offering IoT platforms: Amazon, IBM, 


Salesforce, Intel, and Samsung just to name a few. PTC’s ThingWorx platform has 10K Twitter followers vs. hundreds of 


thousands (and millions) for some of its competitors; whose thoughts can be heard the loudest?


 With so much competition in the IoT platform space, it’s no surprise management stopped disclosing key metrics such as IoT 


customers and logos, and now references the “freemium” model when describing its business model; you get what you pay for. 


What we’ve found is that average revenue per IoT customer is declining, along with the % of recurring revenue. In our opinion, 


PTC is attempting to sell a solution for a loosely defined problem, and doesn’t have the right footprint to sell strategically into the 


right decision making channels

Spruce Point Believes PTC Is A 
“Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons: 


Investors Overlooking Management’s Past Associations With Controversial Companies, While Sleepy Governance Creates 


Moral Hazard And Allows Management To Sell, Sell, Sell All The Time  


 PTC’s CEO is no stranger to corporate controversy, having been associated with SDRC. To illustrate, Heppelmann was the CTO 


at Metaphase Technology, a JV formed in 1992 between SDRC and Control Data Systems to develop and market advanced 


PDM software. According to an SEC complaint, from 1992-1994, executives at SDRC inflated revenue and earnings through 


fictitious revenues. A material amount of the improperly recognized revenue was based on purchase orders containing conditional 


language from SDRC's Far East Operations. When the scheme was disclosed in September 1994, approximately $30m of SDRC 


product was stored in a warehouse at the Cincinnati Airport. Heppelmann was not named in the complaint


 PTC’s CFO Andrew Miller came from Autodesk where he was the Chief Accounting Officer and Controller through 2008. In 2006, 


Autodesk announced its Audit Committee was conducting a review of its stock option granting practices; an SEC investigation 


commenced. Autodesk announced its financial statements could no longer be relied upon. During the review, Autodesk also 


determined that it incorrectly recorded certain reseller credits


 Overseeing management is a Board that happily rewards them for failure, and can’t define what goals management should be 


focused on. To illustrate, the Comp Committee gave the CEO a pass for failing to hit long-term Non-GAAP EPS targets defined at 


his promotion to CEO in 2010, covering periods through 2013-2015. It allowed 49.7% of his unearned award to vest. This 


practice creates moral hazard, and could give PTC’s executives additional confidence to inflate financial performance to realize


value for its considerable “free” equity grants.  It’s also noteworthy that PTC ties none of its executive cash bonuses to 


performance in IoT which it promotes as a significant growth driver. In fact, the latest proxy statement only mentions IoT once 


 The short-term incentive cash bonus targets have changed every year since 2013. The latest two bonus targets, Subscription 


ACV and Non-GAAP operating expenses (opex), are defined in such an inconsistent way to allow management to game the 


system. For example, in calculating Non-GAAP opex PTC omits restructuring charges, which we’ve argued are suspect and have 


been reoccurring for 5 years. Secondly, PTC omits selected expenses related to acquisitions tied to its IoT strategy. Conveniently, 


PTC doesn’t say it removes acquisition contributions to its Subscription ACV. Lastly, PTC uses a similar sleight-of-hand in 


removing excess incentive compensation. Again, PTC gets all the benefit to its Subscription ACV performance metric, but wants


to exclude a portion of the costs. Not surprisingly, PTC’s Non-GAAP operating expense of $646.2m just barely beat its threshold 


target of $648.2m


 Insider ownership by management and directors is near an all-time low at just 1%. It’s noteworthy that ownership materially 


decreased in 2011 when the restructuring programs began. At the current time, six insiders have active stock sale programs
11


Spruce Point Sees 50% - 60% Downside


Investors’ Are Overlooking PTC’s Deteriorating Financials + Signs Of Distress, And Focus Only On Bookings. Its 


Valuation Has Reached Unjustified Levels. Consider The Following:


 PTC has made four revisions to its credit agreement since Nov 2015. Its latest revision (not even properly discussed in the 


recent 10-Q, but quietly filed as an exhibit) buys it a little extra wiggle room while it grapples with limited borrowing capacity 


(just $40m disclosed at year end), too much inefficient cash trapped abroad (77%), and has to fund a negative working capital


position while it burns cash flow. PTC’s current total leverage of 3.5x puts it dangerously close to its 4.0x covenant


 Meanwhile, PTC’s analysts largely ignore these issues, and place an average price target of $60 with a majority saying “Buy”.


At its current share price, there’s just 12% upside. In our view this is a terrible risk/reward to owning shares at current levels. 


The sell-side analysts’ take the Company’s results at face value and assume management’s guidance can easily be achieved 


without any consideration given to the numerous concerns we’ve raised in our report. Bookings, a seemingly made up metric 


which the Company heavily disclaims, is all the analysts narrowly focus on 


 PTC currently trades at 5.6x, 23x, 40x 2017E Sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS, respectively. Its 5-year average 


valuation of Sales, EBITDA, and Non-GAAP EPS multiple is 3.7x, 17x, and 26x, respectively. PTC also trades at 94x and 43x 


LTM and 2017E operating cash flow. To put in perspective its current valuation, in 2014 (pre-conversion) its multiple was 3.5x, 


13x and 17x Sales, EBITDA, and Non-GAAP EPS respectively. PTC’s multiple expansion is comparable with Adobe’s (which is 


consider the gold standard example). Unlike Adobe’s conversion, PTC has experienced negative cash flow and declining 


deferred revenue – a fact that no one can explain.  At the current time, PTC trades at a premium to its peers which on average 


are valued at 5.6x, 16x, 26x, 22x multiple of Sales, EBITDA, EPS and operating cash flow, respectively. These peers are 


generally expected to produce more top-line revenue growth than PTC, have better cash generation, but analysts’ are fixated 


on the ramp of PTC’s Non-GAAP EPS growth, which we have shown has severe distortions from economic realities


 Comparable acquisitions of companies in technical software and electronic data automation space have sold (with a control 


premium) at next 12 months forward multiples of 3.5x revenues and approximately 14x EBITDA, respectively. Most recently, 


Siemens announced the acquisition of Mentor Graphics for 3.5x and 13x Sales and EBITDA, respectively, in November 2016. 


Mentor is arguably a much better business with a similar top line growth profile, but operating cash flow margins at 25% vs. 6% 


at PTC. These deal premiums suggest further over-valuation of PTC’s shares


 By all valuation benchmarks, PTC’s share price is overvalued. Given the numerous accounting distortions in PTC’s reporting 


that affects EBITDA and EPS, we believe the best way to value its shares are on a multiple of revenues and operating cash 


flow.  For the sake of argument, we assume management’s 2017E figures, and apply more realistic multiples to discount our 


concerns. At 2.5x – 3.5x revenues and 18x – 21x operating cash flow, we see approximately 50% – 60% downside risk

Fundamental Strains And 
Subscription Conversion “Story”
15


What Is Straining PTC? 


 The CAD and related software spaces (PLM, SLM, ALM) are mature and very competitive end markets that have experienced 


deflationary pricing over time. For a great history of PTC and its pricing, we recommend the chapter on PTC from “The 


Engineering and Design” by David Weisberg. Today, PTC competes against larger rivals such as Dassault, Siemens, Autodesk 


and others. In addition to the challenges of operating in a mature end market, the space is now coming under siege from next 


generation startups (e.g. OnShape which is pure cloud solution, and gaining traction amongst the next generation of engineers at 


leading universities such as MIT; OnShape is a longer term disruptor in the industry).


 In an attempt to preserve and grow revenues, PTC has pivoted away from providing products towards being a solutions provider.


This strategy focuses on two distinct, yet hopefully related, business initiatives


 Change the legacy product delivery mechanism (perpetual license + maintenance) to a SaaS subscription and position the 


firm’s capabilities as an integrated part of client’s product management processes 


 Develop a leading IoT platform that can serve as a standalone service solution or ideally can be used in conjunction (or 


cross-sold) with the legacy software offering


 PTC’s vision to shift from a product sales company to a solutions provider is ambitious, and pulling off the integrated solutions –


IoT state is reminiscent of Apple transforming itself from a PC company to a media platform with an integrated product ecosystem


(more on this later).


 Acknowledging that the IoT initiative can have an extremely wide range of financial/strategic outcomes, lets first consider the 


three strategic challenges with converting the legacy product business to a solutions service.  


 Customer Relationships:  Although PTC continues to focus within the industrial space, the point of sale is beginning to 


evolve from an engineering team (CFO signoff) to a Head of Product and potentially CIO (C-Suite signoff) 


 Complexity of Sale:  The sale begins to evolve from the competitive technical merits of the product versus the competitors, 


to understanding the client’s overall product strategy and how the suite of solutions can help to better run the client’s 


business.  Once the solutions oriented “partner” sale has been made, these relationships need to be fostered to ensure 


that the solutions are actually integrated into the client’s product management processes


 Pricing:  The software solutions have undergone deflationary pricing over time in the legacy licensing model.  The upside 


of a subscription model are lower upfront costs and greater flexibility in managing usage over time. However, the client 


ends up spending 30% +more over the life of the contract when purchasing through a subscription and can cancel

Key Questions To Consider As PTC’s 
Pivots Towards Solutions


 Does PTC have the right client decision making relationships? Does PTC have the right support model and individuals to execute on 


the sale and implementation of solutions?  Can PTC resellers execute the transition abroad when many of them are product sales 


oriented and may not be exclusive to PTC? Is the subscription service appropriately priced to reflect the premium associated with 


greater payment/use flexibility and is there reason to believe that this pricing won’t also be deflationary over time.


 Switching gears to the IoT initiative, it’s important to realize that this is a space still in its infancy and that it represents a fundamental 


shift in how companies operate their business model. Before the IoT space really takes hold, customers’ will have to make significant 


budgeting, planning, risk management, and reputational decisions. There will certainly be some customers keen on a trying to seize a 


first mover advantage, but the reality is most will take a wait and see approach that will be measured in years rather than quarters. It’s 


important to realize that this sale is less about PTC pushing a capability, than it is about delivering the best solution to a customer who 


has already bought into the IoT concept.


 What are the odds that PTC miraculously pulls off the IoT transformation, and remains a top five player in a space that is still in its 


infancy?  Thinking back to the Apple analogy, lets look at the critical success factors that allowed the unlikely to occur:


 Product Focused:  Apple has clearly become an outstanding consumer marketing company, but at its core it is a product 


company.  The Company’s ability to manage the transition was predicated on understanding and delivering what clients wanted 


better than its competitors.


 One Success at a Time:  The transition from making PCs to eventually selling media didn’t happen overnight.  Their ability to 


make this progression was predicated by building credibility and loyalty with one best in class product after another (iPod, iPhone, 


iPad) until they owned the consumer’s mindshare (and content)


 Innovation: Apple made a large number of acquisitions that allowed features to be added to their product, but the actual design 


and functionality was always maintained internally.  Their ability to deliver the optimal solution came as a direct result of innovating 


rather than acquiring and assembling their product. 


 Leadership: Steve Jobs ability to create a culture and lead a smooth transition of this magnitude was a testament to the quality of 


his leadership team


Investors’ evaluating the odds of the full PTC IoT transformation should think through the answers to the below questions in 


regards to the success that PTC has had relative to Amazon and IBM (lesser degree Microsoft and GE).


 Has PTC established a reputation of service excellence with clients? Hint: See Forrester Wave study for details. Does PTC have 


enough service penetration to occupy significant mindshare with the C-Suite of potential customers? What are the implications 


and product sacrifices of PTC’s decision to acquire rather than build? Is PTC’s leadership team up to the task of delivering on this 


transformation despite their track record of being late to SaaS, endless restructurings and significant turnover of acquired talent?

Signs of a Non-Economic Financial Model


For highly acquisitive companies effecting a roll-up strategy, Spruce Point has consistently advocated to evaluate financial 


performance by looking at cash flow after recurring acquisitions (see reports on our website: AMETEK, LKQ and ECHO). At 


the moment, it’s clear that PTC is on a non-economic path with declining operating cash flow, and no evidence it can earn 


back the $1bn+ its paid for 11 acquisitions. It’s also worrisome that PTC’s liquidity is at an all-time low while its debt is at a 


high. PTC recently disclosed that just $40m of capital was available to borrow on its revolver due to covenant restrictions. (1)

Before we get into PTC specifics, investors should take a step back and consider that there are more examples of 


failed subscription and cloud conversion stories, than success stories. PTC would like investors’ to believe it is 


executing a flawless transition to a subscription model and that it still has a long runway of opportunity. Everyone 


cites Adobe as the model success story, but fails to point out the struggles and failures of many.

PTC’s transition to a subscription model looks nothing like other transition models we’ve analyzed. In particular, 


we should expect deferred revenue to grow meaningfully during the implementation phase. Curiously, we find 


that PTC’s short and long-term deferred revenue balance declined in Q1’17 and its cash flow went negative. PTC 


claims that shortfall is a result of a two day calendar shift impacting the timing of fiscal quarter ends and billing 


schedules. (1) Color us skeptical, but this just sounds like a convenient way to explain away a $64m shortfall.

PTC’s Fuzzy Breakeven Math


PTC’s transition is not a guaranteed success. According to its 2015 Analyst Day Presentation (bottom right), it must 


retain its customers on subscription for at least 4 years to breakeven. However, the current average customer contract 


length is 2 years according to the FY16 10-K. Ironically, the 2014 slide the year before (bottom left) showed a less than 3 


year breakeven. PTC did not use the breakeven slide at all at its 2016 Analyst Day. Also, notice that in 2014 PTC’s 


“Lifetime Value” would be 33% over 5 years. On an apples-to-apples basis, the Lifetime Value over 5 years in the 2015 


slide would be just 12.5%! (1). These slide changes appear to reflect a lower expectation for subscription pricings vs. 


perpetual with support pricing.

PTC’s Organic Growth Hard To Discern


PTC does not give investors any disclosure about what exactly is driving its subscription revenue growth; is it 


coming from simply pushing maintenance customers into subscriptions, or is it truly growing organically by 


acquiring new customers? PTC’s key peers do a much better job describing their revenue attribution.


Dassault


Subscription revenue remained flat during the three months 


ended October 31, 2016, as compared to the three months ended 


October 31, 2015, primarily due to a 40% increase in new 


model subscription revenue, offset by a 4% decrease in 


maintenance revenue. The 40% increase in new model 


subscription revenue was due to a 158% increase in product 


subscription revenue and a 25% increase in revenue from 


flexible enterprise business agreements. The 4% decrease in 


maintenance revenue was attributable to the business model 


transition, as we expect maintenance revenue will slowly decline 


as perpetual license sales have ended, and customers adopt our 


new model subscription offerings. Maintenance revenue from 


perpetual software products represented 86% and 90% of 


subscription revenue for the three months ended October 31, 


2016 and 2015, respectively. New model subscription revenue 


represented 14% and 10% of subscription revenue for the 


three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

AutoDesk


Dassault Systèmes benefits from a high level of recurring


software revenue, at the core of its financial model.


Recurring software revenue represented 70% of non-IFRS


total software revenue in 2015, and grew 10% in constant


currencies, of which 7% was organic;


IFRS new licenses revenue increased 23.7% and 12% in 


constant currencies in 2015. Non-IFRS new licenses revenue of 


€735.6 million increased 26.5% and 15% in constant 


currencies, benefiting from organic growth estimated at 11% 


in constant currencies and 2014 acquisitions. New licenses 


revenue represented 28.6% and 28.5% of total software revenue 


for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Organic Revenue Growth


We attempted to recast PTC’s current financials to isolate what they would look like as if the current transition to a 


subscription model had not occurred. In our view, there’s no real underlying growth.

Investors Are Giving Too Much Credence 
To PTC’s Oddly Defined Bookings Metric


Despite progressively worse financial results, investors seem enamored with PTC’s bookings. However, PTC’s bookings and 


associated Annualized Contract Value (ACV) should be taken with a grain of salt. Their terms are non-standardized and we cannot 


find any other companies using similar definitions. Even PTC warns clearly that “it does not represent actual revenue that will be 


recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales were perpetual licenses, nor does the 


annualized value of monthly software rental bookings represent the value of any such booking.” We even asked PTC’s former 


Head of Sales and he could not explain to us what they mean!

PTC’s ACV Calculation As Explained, With Little Support or Justification and Unknown Values For Variables: “In order to normalize 


between perpetual and subscription licenses, we define subscription bookings as the subscription annualized contract value (subscription 


ACV) of new subscription bookings multiplied by a conversion factor of 2. We arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering a number 


of variables including pricing, support, length of term, and renewal rates. We define subscription ACV as the total value of a new 


subscription booking divided by the term of the contract (in days) multiplied by 365. If the term of the subscription contract is less than a 


year, the ACV is equal to the total contract value. License and subscription bookings equal subscription bookings (as described above) 


plus perpetual license bookings plus any monthly software rental bookings during the period. Total ACV equals subscription ACV (as 


described above) plus the annualized value of incremental monthly software rental bookings during the period.”  (Source: 10K, p. 26)


PTC’s Increasing Subscription ACV and Bookings Above Guidance Excites Investors Although The 


Metrics Are Based On Opaque Formulas:

An Example: 
Low Quality Monthly “Bookings”


Some PTC customers require bespoke subscription periods to accommodate shorter duration software needs. As 


explained by a PTC community user below, his project lifecycles range from 2 to 6 weeks, not 12 months. Thus, a 


traditional PTC annual subscription model does not accommodate his needs. However, PTC takes full credit for these 


short duration customers in its bookings and annualizes them to report ACV. In Q1’16, PTC amended its Bookings 


metrics to reference monthly software rental bookings. We believe it is a highly aggressive tactic by management to 


include annualized monthly rentals in ACV.


PTC User Quote – December 2015


“Subscription terms are currently 12 months.  This seems too long.  I would be more interested if I could add capability in 
one month increments.  Imagine only having to purchase Creo Simulate or the Reverse Engineering Extension when you 


have a project that needs them, and then be able to stop when that project is complete.  Our project lifecycles are typically 2 
- 6 weeks, not 12 months long.”  Source


Starting in Q1’16 - Bookings Now Include “Monthly Rentals”


“In order to normalize between perpetual and subscription transactions, we define bookings as either the annualized 
contract value (ACV) of a new subscription multiplied by a conversion factor of 2, the annualized value of incremental 
monthly software rental bookings, or the contract value of a new perpetual license. We arrived at the conversion factor of 
2 by considering a number of variables including pricing, support, length of term, and renewal rates. We define ACV as the 
total value of a new subscription solutions booking divided by the term of the contract (in days) multiplied by 365, unless the 
term is less than one year, in which case the contract value equals the ACV. For monthly rentals, bookings equals revenue 
in the period, and ACV equals the annualized value of the rentals.”  Source: 10-Q, p.23

Another Booking Inflation Example: 
“Win-Back Support” 


There is ample evidence to suggest PTC has had difficulty convincing customers to pay money for its 


maintenance/support. This is a high margin revenue stream that customers can easily opt-in / out of as they see 


necessary. PTC has often used variations of a “Win-Back” program to entice customers. The customer commentary 


below gives good insight into the waning value proposition of maintenance costs. 


PTC User Community Discussion September 2015 -- Source


Doug Schaefer: “Our VAR is telling us that PTC is discontinuing the Winback program at the end of the month. After 9/30, to reinstate inactive seats all back 
maintenance will have to be paid, not just the 12 months back as it is now. The alternatives are a monthly subscription plan or purchasing new seats. Has anyone else 
been told the same thing?”
TomUminn: “I just checked with our VAR and they confirmed the same thing. On the other hand, PTC has done this same thing multiple times in the past and 
eventually they start it back up again. I think after awhile they get too desperate for the lost maintenance dollars...”
Doug Schaefer:  “Back in 2009 we elected to allow our maintenance to lapse simply because PTC wouldn't budge on downgrading our seats to something more 
affordable and more in line with what we were actually using.  When we came back in 2012, they gave us exactly what we had asked for in 2009.  They missed out on a 
couple of years of our money as a result.  Plus, we learned that we could service our customers just fine without paying maintenance every year, hence why we let it 
drop again.”
MarcoTosin: “What is changing NOW is that PTC is kicking customer from maintenance to subscription.”
Doug Schaefer: “It see(m)s that this is exactly what they are doing now. I agree with Tom, it won't last forever. If you get punitive about people returning to the fold, 
they are simply less likely to return.”


MCAD Central Discussion Board, September 2011 -- Source


Biff: “I held my maintenance with PTC for approx 8 years, the expense for 1 licence with ASX & AAX was ridiculous but i kept it going. I then decided to purchase 
Solidworks. It seemed that more customers were moving to it & to be honest, from a commercial point of view it was the best decision I have made.
DGS:   “You have to watch what they're offering. They want to 'win back' you business, so they are going to offer a better price. What they will do often is offer to 
renew you at a lower function seat than you had, thus a lower price. Plus, part of the renewal is paying a year of back mainenance, per PTC's policy.”
Erik_Gifford: “These scenarios probably sound familiar to all of us who are responsible for managing all the CAD/CAM/CAE maintenance contracts. We've dropped 
modules that weren't getting used, repackaged licenses and done multi-year maintenance contracts to try to realize a reduced price from PTC. The best deal we ever 
got was on a three-year contract when Rand was our VAR and PTC wasin a legal battle with them. I think Rand knew they weren't going to be a PTC VAR much longer 
and didn't care if they didn't get the usual cut of the maintenance pie. There have been several times where in hindsight I've questioned the actual value the 
maintenance contract and wondered if we'd be better off dropping it and rebuying when a major shift occurs (i.e. Creo 2?). Always interesting to read the transcript of 
PTC's quarterly meeting with investment bankers. Although PTC has certainly made some recent investments in their product and made improvements, after you read 
the transcripts you can't help but feel that it's the investment bankers they're worried about keeping happy. Really interesting when you see the numbers and business 
plans they discuss. PTC isn't willing to give you a discount on buying the software (or winning you back) to be your friend, it's to get you back into the maintenance 
revenue stream where the margins are huge.”

Management’s Spin on “Win-Back Support” 


From the commentary below, PTC reinstituted the Win-Back program in Q3’16, but created a gimmick that pushed 


customers into taking a subscription, which includes the maintenance. A customer that is looking to add 


maintenance already has a perpetual license.  Therefore, the optics of just reclassifying a customer who needs 


maintenance that was accounted for as support revenue as now subscription revenue appears questionable. It 


appears this tactic will also allow PTC to further inflate its bookings metrics. Our research suggests that PTC may 


have angered its customers in the process – not a recipe for long-term business success.


CFO Quote – Q2’16 Earnings Call


“I'll remind you that the long-term business model we presented at our Investor Day did not include any assumption that our large
support revenue base would transition to subscription. So this could represent a big upside to our long-term business model. And


at the beginning of April, we announced a support win-back program in the channel that converts customers to subscription.”


“The one thing we do have that's new starting in Q3 is the win-back program in the channel. So especially, with our CAD 
customers, there were some that would go off maintenance, and then, just before they wanted to upgrade, they would come back 
on. And in the past, we charged them a fee to come back live. And then, they would directly go back off again after they got their 


upgrade. We would recognize that win-back in our support revenue, but we'd recognize it all at one. So what we now have is a 
program that's more attractive that gets them to move on to subscription. So it's actually a little cheaper to move on to 


subscription than to just do a one-time win-back. And we'll be recognizing that revenue moving forward. But the thing is, once 
they move to subscription, they can't use the software unless they stay on subscription. So that's the benefit for us. So it's a 


benefit for them, it's probably easier to come back on, benefit for us is once they're on subscription, they have to stay on it to use 
the software. And so you heard me refer to the notes that's one of the things that is a change in our support guidance. We used to 


get about $20 million a year on those win-backs that we would have in the support, and now that's going to be recognized 
forward as opposed to upfront.” Source

Bookings By Heavy Discount Promotions


PTC offered heavy promotions starting at 50% in Q2’16, which incentivized customers (no longer covered by support) to move 


fast by narrowing the discount to 20% through the end of FY16. Certain foreign resellers were advertising savings up to 80% off 


(but failing to mention that in the long-run that a subscription will cost more than perpetual). While investors might be excited 


about bookings exceeding expectations, they might be disappointed when planned margin increases don’t materialize.

CEO on Q4’16 Conf Call (October 2016): “Late in the quarter we recorded an SLM subscription booking of $20 million that was not 


in our guidance due to deal timing uncertainty, but please take note that even without this transaction, we still would have exceeded the 


high end of our bookings guidance” and later…. “ Speaking of mega deals, I'd like to circle back and provide some additional color on the 


strategic SLM engagement that we won in Q4, which capped off a strong year for our SLM business. Following a comprehensive commercial 


and technical evaluation, a U.S. government customer in the aerospace and defense sector selected a PTC-based solution to help transform 


its legacy part forecasting system to our cloud-based Service Parts Management solution. This customer has one of the most complex supply 


chains in the world with over 5,000 large assets and support systems in 1,500 locations around the globe consuming upwards of 1 billion 


spare parts. This validates our solution as being the best in breed and clearly illustrates that we're able to solve large complex service 


logistics issues for the most demanding supply chains and reinforces PTC's leading position in the Federal Aerospace and Defense segment.


CFO on Q1’16 Conf Call (Jan 2017) With this in mind, despite the FX headwinds for the full year fiscal 2017 we are maintaining our 


bookings guidance range of $400 million to $420 million. This represents 5% to 10% growth excluding the $20 million SLM megadeal we 


closed in Q4, 2016.”


“The announcement of a customer's selection of PTC 


software is not necessarily indicative of the timing 


of the related booking, recognition of related 


revenue, or the amount of revenue for any particular

“The announcement of any particular selection of PTC 


software is not necessarily indicative of the timing of 


recognition of revenue there from or the amount of

cases PTC's software must be successfully implemented

PTC’s Financial Troubles


Before we look closely at PTC’s recent financial obfuscation, it’s important to consider the recent troubles the 


Company has had from a financial management perspective. The most significant issue was the recent settlement 


with the Department of Justice and SEC in 2016. None of this should inspire much shareholder confidence.


Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(FCPA) Violation (Feb 2016)


Korea Tax Audit
(July 2016)


Forecast Restatement
(October 2016)


What 
Happened


PTC effectively bribed Chinese officials by 
paying their travel expenses to secure 


business. “PTC failed to stop illicit payments 
despite indications of potential corruption by 
agents working with its Chinese subsidiaries, 
and the misconduct continued unabated for 


several years,” said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of 
the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit.


In July 2016, PTC received an assessment 
from the tax authorities in Korea related to 


an ongoing tax audit


PTC issued financial guidance for Q1’17 and 
FY17. Although GAAP operating expense 


guidance and GAAP operating margin 
guidance were presented as intended for 


both periods, as was Non-GAAP EPS guidance, 
the GAAP EPS guidance included in the 


October 26, 2016 press release and prepared 
remarks inadvertently omitted interest 
expense for both the Q1’17 and FY’17 


periods, which requires revisions to the GAAP 
EPS guidance for both periods. 


Cost to 
Shareholders


PTC agreed to pay $11.858 million in 
disgorgement and $1.764 million in 


prejudgment interest to settle the SEC’s 
charges and its two China subsidiaries agreed 


to pay a $14.54 million fine in a non-
prosecution agreement

Rules Are Made To Be Broken…..


Warning: PTC started giving a “rule of thumb” for investors to track the change in its sales and Non-GAAP EPS for every 1% 


shift in subscription mix. Curiously, it changed its estimate from $3m in sales / $0.02c Non-GAAP EPS to $4m / $0.03c 


between Q3 and Q4 without any specific reason. This change coincided with a large miss relative to expectations, which of 


course PTC explained away by substantial bookings outperformance, as well as escalated restructuring charges in Q4. PTC 


even went so far to say that “We cannot estimate the effect on GAAP EPS due to the number of unknown items, including tax 


items, included in GAAP EPS.” The last company Spruce Point evaluated that could not reconcile its estimates to GAAP was 


Sabre Corp, which has cut its guidance twice in recent earnings periods. (1)

Less and Less Important Disclosure 
Covering Up Pricing Deflation


Source: Compare above with current PTC FY’17 Financial Data Tables


We also caution investors’ that PTC no longer discloses key supplemental data and the reason appears to be that PTC doesn’t want


investors to see its pricing power is rapidly deflating. In particular, upon reviewing previous supplemental financial data tables, we 


find that PTC no longer discloses quota-carrying reps (as of Q4’16), active seats (as of Q4’15), and average deal size. Next we will 


show that resellers have been in structural decline and now it looks like direct sales reps and revenue per rep are too.

PTC wants investors’ to believe that sales are temporarily under pressure from a change to a subscription model. However, 


Spruce Point believes that the problem is more structural in nature. We’ve conducted a forensic analysis of PTC’s reseller 


partners. PTC stopped disclosing exact indirect sales in its SEC filings in 2013, but has continued to claim 20%-25% of revenues 


come from this channel (1). ChannelAdvantage resellers must pay a fee, are required to make annual revenue commitments, and 


cannot sell competitive products among other requirements (2). From our analysis it is clear that software resellers are in 


structural decline and that PTC is no longer emphasizing status levels. With both sales and marketing employees and software 


resellers in decline, how exactly is PTC able to sustain revenue growth momentum? PTC has also said that all of its “high growth” 


IoT goes through resellers, and not direct, so this should be a major concern for the growth story. (3)

Channel Sales Reporting Discrepancy


Source: PTC FY’17 Financial Data Tables Source: PTC FY’12 10-K Annual Report, p. 16


Our concerns about channel revenues are supported by the fact that PTC’s own financial information doesn’t 


reconcile. We illustrated that PTC no longer puts specific indirect channel revenues in its SEC filings. On its investor 


relations website, PTC provides and excel file with a tab “Supplemental Data” (bottom left table) – it lists “Channel” 


Revenue of 23% / 23% in FY11/12, but these figures do not reconcile with historical SEC filings at 27.3% / 26.9% 


(bottom right table). Direct revenue % also don’t add up and are 72% / 73% in FY 11/12 vs. 77% in the left table below.


The discrepancy suggests approximately $35 - $50m of irreconcilable revenues.

PTC Reseller Economics Stink


From PTC’s Channel Partner guide, it appears that its resellers are effectively financing PTC, which we suspect resellers cannot


possibly be happy about.  The billing flow schematic below shows that PTC gets paid upfront, while the reseller bears 


responsibility for billing and collecting from the end user.  Note PTC’s reseller revenue recognition, while described differently, 


appears analogous to its peer ANSYS’s policy.


Source: Found on PTC User Community website May 2015


Revenue Recognition From Resellers


PTC


“Revenue arrangements with resellers are generally recognized on a sell-through basis; that is, when we deliver the product to the end-user customer. We 
record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller. We do not offer contractual 
rights of return, stock balancing, or price protection to our resellers, and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date. As a result, we 
do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns”


ANSYS


In sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. The Company recognizes revenue from 
transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment, collectibility from the channel partner is probable, a 
license agreement signed by the end-user customer is received and delivery has occurred, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. 
Revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the Company by the channel partners

% Sales From Channel 41% 79% 24.4% 20%-25%


PTC’s revenue and reseller arrangements look even more unusual in light of the fact that it accrues almost no allowance for 


doubtful accounts against its accounts receivable. ANSYS again is an illustrative example. It reports nearly an identical % of 


revenues from channel partners, yet accrues 10x more for its receivables allowances. Recall also that ANSYS describes almost 


identical revenue recognition and that its channel partner bears the risk of collection. The difference could be explained by our 


prior observation that PTC asks its resellers for upfront payment. We reiterate that all else equal, why would resellers want to sell 


for PTC if they are effectively being asked to finance it. Another possibility is that PTC is incorrectly accounting for Partner  


Allowances, a practice that Autodesk does a good job disclosing in its financial reports. 


1) When adjusted to included PTC’s billed but uncollected support and subscription related amounts included in Other Current Assets of $129.3m and $126.3m in 2015/16, the allowance % of 


gross receivables falls to just 0.31% and 0.35% in 2015/16, respectively. Figures disclosed in PTC’s 10-K, p. F-10 


2) Autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a 


specified time period. A portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period. The remainder, which relates to incentives on our Subscription Program, is 


recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period. 


These incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments. The reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra 


account receivable (when due to distributors and direct resellers) or accounts payable (when due to indirect resellers).

Misleading DSO Also Supports Our Case 
That Something “Doesn’t Look Right”


Upon reviewing PTC’s deferred revenue disclosures, we noticed something unusual. The Company cites “Billed 


but uncollected support and subscription-related amounts in other current assets.” To us, this certainly sounds 


like a receivable. Upon further inspection, we notice that PTC discloses its DSO in its financial spreadsheet. The 


trend makes it look as if DSOs have been rapidly improving. We decided to see what would happen if we 


included the billed and uncollected receivables into the DSO calculation. Not surprisingly we’ve found almost no 


improvement from FY 2013 – 2016.

Loose Use of Non-GAAP Terms


Spruce Point believes that PTC’s evolving versions of Backlog are becoming increasingly distorted. To illustrate, PTC now tries 


to present “Unbilled Deferred Revenue” along with Deferred Revenue in a table and wants investors’ to evaluate the total 


amounts. However, Unbilled Deferred Revenue does not appear on PTC’s balance sheet! While “contractually committed” 


sounds like a strong assurance, it’s entirely possible that customers can cancel their contracts with limited/no penalty. 


PTC should also clearly specify that Unbilled Deferred Revenue is a “Non-GAAP” figure.


Backlog (2014) – Early Part of Transition: “We generally ship our products within 30 days after receipt of a customer order. A high percentage of our 


license revenue historically has been generated in the third month of each fiscal quarter, and this revenue tends to be concentrated in the latter part of 


that month. Accordingly, orders may exist at the end of a quarter that have not been shipped and not been recognized as revenue. We do not believe 


that our backlog at any particular point in time is material or indicative of future sales levels.”  (Source: 10-K, p.4)


Backlog (2015):  “We define backlog as contractually committed orders for license, subscription and support with a customer for which the associated 


revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced. Deferred revenue primarily relates to software support agreements invoiced 


to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized. Customer commitments for amounts that are not in deferred revenue and have not yet 


been invoiced to customers related to multi-year support and subscription contracts totaled approximately $210 million at September 30, 2015 


(compared to approximately $185 million at September 30, 2014), of which we expect to invoice customers approximately $140 million within the next 


twelve months.” (Source: 10-K, p.5)


Deferred Revenue and Backlog (Unbilled Deferred Revenue): “We define unbilled deferred revenue as contractually committed orders for license, 


subscription and support with a customer for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced. We do 


not record unbilled deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet until we invoice the customer. Deferred revenue primarily relates to software 


agreements invoiced to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized. Of the unbilled deferred revenue balance at September 30, 2016, 


we expect to invoice customers approximately $210 million within the next twelve months. The increase in unbilled deferred revenue is primarily due to 


the increase in our subscription bookings, which are generally billed annually at the start of each annual subscription period.” (Source: 10-K, p. 17)


PTC wants to divert investor 


attention from Deferred Revenue, 


to Unbilled Deferred Revenue. 


We view this presentation as 


potentially misleading since 


Unbilled Deferred Revenue does 


not appear on PTC’s balance sheetSource: 10-Q, p.27

Many Reclassifications


Period Reclassification


Q1’17 p.27
In 2016, we launched Navigate, a ThingWorx-based PLM solution. In 2017, revenue and bookings for Navigate are being allocated 50% to 
Solutions and 50% to IoT; 2016 reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The impact of the
reclassification on 2016 revenue was immaterial.


Q3’16 p.5


Through the second quarter of 2016, we had two operating and reportable segments: (1) Software Products, which included license and 
related support revenue (including updates and technical support) for all our products except training-related products; and (2) Services, 
which included consulting, implementation, training, cloud services, computer-based training products, including support on these 
products, and other services revenue. With a change in our organizational structure in an effort to create more effective and efficient 
operations and to improve customer and product focus, during the three months ended July 2, 2016, we revised the information that our 
chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources 
and assessing performance. As a result, effective with the beginning of the third quarter of 2016, we changed our operating and 
reportable segments from two to three: (1) the Solutions Group, which includes license, subscription, support and cloud services revenue 
for our core CAD, SLM and PLM products; (2) the IoT Group, which includes license, subscription, support and cloud services revenue for 
our IoT, analytics and augmented reality solutions; and (3) Professional Services, which includes consulting, implementation and training 
revenue.


Q1’16 p. 5


In 2015, we classified revenue and cost of revenue in three categories: 1) license and subscription, 2) support and 3) professional services. 
Effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2016, we are reporting perpetual license revenue separately from subscription revenue 
and are presenting revenue in four categories: 1) subscription, 2) support, 3) perpetual license and 4) professional services. Effective with 
the beginning of the first quarter of 2016, we are combining cost of license and subscription revenue with cost of support revenue and 
reporting it as cost of software revenue. As a result, we are presenting cost of revenue in two categories: 1) cost of software revenue and 
2) cost of professional services revenue. The discussion that follows reflects our revised reporting structure.


Q1’16 p. 5 Effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain expenses related to management of our product lines 
from general and administrative to marketing.


FY15 10K, p.15


Through 2014, we classified revenue in three categories: 1) license; 2) service; and 3) support. Because we introduced subscription-based 
licenses in 2015, we have revised our revenue reporting. Effective with the beginning of the first quarter of 2015, we report revenue as 
follows: 1) license and subscriptions (L&S); 2) support; and 3) professional services. L&S revenue includes perpetual license revenue, 
subscription revenue and cloud services revenue. Cloud service offerings were previously reflected in service revenue and cost of service 
revenue. Consulting and training service revenue and consulting and training cost of service revenue are now referred to as professional 
services revenue and cost of professional services revenue. The discussion that follows reflects our revised reporting structure.


PTC’s frequent reclassifications are nothing more than ways to put a shine on a struggling business. We will illustrate 


how recent actions serve to bolster the IoT business and enhance segment profit presentation.

Meaningless Tax Rate


We believe PTC’s GAAP/Non-GAAP earnings should be viewed skeptically. Just witness how PTC’s GAAP and Non-


GAAP tax estimate centered around 20% going into FY16 and by year end the GAAP tax rate was -19% and Non-GAAP 


rate was 5%. PTC cited a FY16  “tax benefit” of $0.11c per share. PTC doesn’t make it easy for investors to see how 


much they actually pay in cash taxes.  Most companies disclose these figures at the bottom of the cash flow 


statement, whereas PTC buries the figures in the footnotes of its Annual Report. 


The general trend of flat cash taxes mirrors our view that PTC isn’t really growing. 


Actual Cash Taxes Buried Deep In PTC’s Annual Report, p. F-24


“At September 30, 2016 and 2015, income taxes payable and income tax accruals recorded in accrued income taxes, other 
current liabilities, and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets were $18.7 million ($6.3 million in 


accrued income taxes, $5.5 million in other current liabilities and $6.9 million in other liabilities) and $14.7 million ($4.0 
million in accrued income taxes, $2.2 million in other current liabilities and $8.5 million in other liabilities), respectively. At

PTC would like investors’ to ignore its restructuring expenses and evaluate its Non-GAAP results.


The problem we see is that PTC’s restructuring charges have been recurring now for 5 years and keep increasing in size.


The cumulative restructuring charges since 2012 are $231m. Charges accelerated in 2016 and amount to 10% of 


Adjusted Operating Expenses and 7% of sales.

1) $3.9m related to closure of excess facilities. Total charges exceed high end $80m due to “incremental efficiencies” identified in Q4


2) 10-K p.16 says the following: “We expect that the cost savings associated with the headcount and facility reductions will be offset by certain planned cost 


increases and investments in our business. As a result, we do not expect net operating expense reductions in 2017, as compared to 2016 levels”


PTC made frequent increases to its restructuring plan during FY 2016 and spent $83m in actual cash costs 


to execute its program ($30-$40m more than originally planned). PTC’s restructuring program has all the 


trappings of earnings management. The SEC will be keen to see our analysis in light of its own Accounting 


Bulletin 100 that says companies must be able to make “reliable estimates”


Why did this 


change? 


Does PTC 


have trouble 


tracking 


headcount?


SEC on Restructuring: “Repeated material changes in the nature, timing, or amount of the 
estimated exit costs and involuntary termination benefits subsequent to the commitment 
date may also indicate an inability to make reliable estimates.”

PTC’s recurring restructuring programs is showing severe signs of diminishing returns on investment. 


We have analyzed the ratio of cash costs spent vs. estimated savings and savings per employee. Both 


metrics are in rapid decline. In light of PTC’s 2016 restructuring program being repeatedly increased, and 


its plunging efficacy, it suggests potential earnings manipulation.

PTC’s restructuring charges don’t align with its reported employee count.


It’s worth focusing on the sales and marketing restructuring charges which comprise the majority of the 


restructuring. PTC’s sales and marketing headcount was reported at 1,508 (2012) vs. 1,442 (2016), which 


represents a decline of just 66 people in four years. Over the same period, total charges have represented 


$80.1m or an astronomical $1.2m per net terminated employee

With All The Sales and Marketing 
Charges, Why Are Employees Rising?


According to recent Linkedin data, employee headcount is now rising the fastest in sales, marketing and 


business development. This seems awfully strange for a company that has spent years showing 


restructuring charges in sales and marketing and says it is dependent on achieving lower sales and 


marketing expenses to achieve its operating margin targets!

If PTC’s Restructuring Is Complete, Why Is 
There Still A Large Accrual?


Source: PTC Q1’17 10-Q


“We continue to proactively manage our cost structure and invest in what we believe are high return 


opportunities in our business. Our goal is to drive continued margin expansion over the long term. To that 


end, we restructured our workforce in 2016, and we completed facility-related restructuring actions 


in the first quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we were materially complete with those 


actions and had incurred total restructuring charges of approximately $83 million. Of that amount, 


$6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2017.”  (Source: 10-Q, p. 25)


PTC’s Restructuring Accrual Activity Does Not Suggest It Is Complete…. 


PTC describes its restructuring activity to be “materially complete”; however, according to its 


restructuring accrual accounts, it still has a $25.6m accrual amount. When comparing this 


amount with the total $83m of charges taken, it would appear that the accrual outstanding is 


material and not completed!

What’s Going On With Atego?


Office Locations Don’t Exist According to PTC


Here’s more evidence of either sloppiness or outright deception. PTC acquired Atego (UK) on July 1, 2014 for $50m. 


PTC appears to have liquidated and sold its Intellectual Property according to UK filings, yet continues to maintain 


Atego’s website and promote its extensive presence and office locations almost 3yrs later. However, some quick 


checks reveal that Atego no longer maintains offices at certain sites. 


Even PTC’s corporate website does not show offices in Arizona or Oregon!

Employee Reviews Bolster Our Suspicion


Recent employee feedback on Glassdoor support our view that PTC’s business and recent financial performance should be 


heavily scrutinized, and that frequent restructurings appear to be used to hit quarterly numbers. We don’t find any evidence that 


its transition to a subscription model is a wild success, or that employees believe the IoT story is a rapid growth engine.


Be Careful What You Wish For: “The executives are slaves to the quarterly results. They lay people off at the slightest hint of a miss. The longer you are 


there, the bigger the target on your back becomes.”  (Source)


Management Doesn’t Care About Employees: “Environment is still somewhat toxic. CEO can be emotional. CFO is self-absorbed and doesn't care about 


the employees. Management work ethic is weak.” (Source)


High Tech, High Turnover:  “High turnover, achieve earnings numbers maintain stock price through regular layoffs. Company made too many acquisitions 


between 2014 and 2016.” (Source)


It’s a Big Company With Some Focus Issues: “Lack of trust in the long term direction of the company. They regularly acquire companies and seem to 


change focus every few years. Regular layoffs across the organisation. Don't get complacent. If you are not working on 'the new shiny' then you might find 


your project cancelled or moved to India.” (Source)


PTC: “Has bet the farm on IOT like all the big boys but has achieved very little revenue to show for it. Enterprise CAD/PLM/ALM/SLM getting gutted to the 


bone to fund the IOT bet.” (Source)


Senior Application Architect:  “The direction of the company and many M&A acquisitions eliminated many software products from previous M&A. If the 


company does not put the marketing, sales and training on a product or segment then it will simply die. As a result consultants are not billable hence let go and 


existing customers suffer.”  (Source)


Constant Layoffs: “Upper management is clueless and fickle. A mid-sized company that long aspired to be a large company (and at least achieved the


ridiculous layers of bureaucracy thereof) now want to re-invent itself as a hot new start-up. No idea or patience on how to achieve reform except to lay people 


off at random.” (Source)


Change Is Not A Joke: “I should have known it was a bad sign when my recruiter joked that PTC stands for Prepare To Change. But the reality is that change 


is not funny. PTC lays off anyone and everyone - from upper management to the lowest minions - every quarter. And this is all done under the guise that we 


are "changing" for the better. What a bunch of BS. We cut people in order to make our number. Happy investors = happy upper management.” (Source)


Searching For Growth Engine: “Brain drain in progress - many great colleagues were laid off over the last few years and more recently, many are leaving. 


Acquisitions since 2011 have failed to drive growth. Strategy changes monthly- Lower investment in CAD and PLM core solutions is causing lack of 


competitiveness in market.”  (Source)

Segment Reporting Gimmicks Also 
Support Our Restructuring Concerns
59


PTC’s Segment Reporting Does Not 
Conform To ASC 280 Requirements


PTC’s segment reporting disclosures do not conform to best practices as dictated by 


“ASC 280 Segment Reporting” which has been effective for several years.


PTC has shuffled its segment reporting multiple times, and upon each iteration, its disclosures are becoming 


less and less transparent. We consider this to be a major red flag for investors.


• A fundamental principal of ASC 280 is that a company’s segment disclosures should be consistent with 


management’s reporting structure. The objective is to allow users to “see through the eyes of management” a 


company’s business


• ASC 280 requires certain components of segment profit or loss that are reported to the CODM to be separately 


reported for each reportable segment, including revenue, depreciation, interest revenue and expense, income 


taxes and significant noncash items


• Under ASC 280, a public entity reports a measure of assets for each reportable segment for those assets that 


are included in the measure of the segment’s assets provided to the CODM. If no asset information is provided 


for a reportable segment, disclosure of segment assets is not required, but that fact and the reason for its 


exclusion should be disclosed. In addition, an entity is required to disclose its equity investments and capital 


expenditures if these items are included in the measure of segment assets reviewed by the CODM


• In the next few slides, we will illustrate that PTC is on a path of less and less disclosures, and does not 


conform ASC 280 reporting guidelines. For example:


• Significant non-cash items such as restructuring charges by segment are now no longer disclosed


• No reporting of depreciation by segment on a quarterly basis 


• No reporting of segment capital expenditures (annual or quarterly)


• No reporting of segment assets reported on a quarterly basis

PTC’s quarterly segment reporting in FY 2016 regularly disclosed restructuring charges by segment (see 


footnote 1). The company does not disclose segment depreciation or amortization on a quarterly basis.

Change in Segment Reporting in Q3’16


“With a change in our organizational structure in 


an effort to create more effective and efficient 


operations and to improve customer and product 


focus, during the three months ended July 2, 


2016, we revised the information that our chief 


executive officer, who is also our chief operating 


decision maker (“CODM”), regularly reviews for 


purposes of allocating resources and assessing 


performance. As a result, effective with the 


beginning of the third quarter of 2016, we 


changed our operating and reportable segments 


from two to three: (1) the Solutions Group, which 


includes license, subscription, support and cloud 


services revenue for our core CAD, SLM and 


ePLM products; (2) the Technology Platform 


Group, which includes license, subscription, 


support and cloud services revenue for our IoT, 


analytics and augmented reality solutions; and 


(3) Professional Services, which includes 


consulting, implementation and training revenue”


We recorded restructuring charges of $2.8 million and $44.5 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. Solutions Group included $1.4 million 


and $16.3 million, respectively; Technology Platform Group included $0.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively; Professional Services included $0.3 million and $4.8 


million, respectively; and unallocated departments included $0.5 million and $22.1 million, respectively, of these restructuring charges. We recorded restructuring charges 


of $4.4 million and $42.6 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015. Solutions Group included $1.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively; 


Technology Platform Group included $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively; Professional Services included $0.3 million and $10.9 million, and unallocated departments 


included $3.0 million and $22.9 million, respectively, of these restructuring charges.(10-Q, p.19)


Notice that PTC changed its segment reporting in Q2’16, but still reported restructuring charges 


by segment to investors. Also, notice that Professional Services is listed as a separate operating segment. 


We will show in the next few slides why to pay close attention to these items.

Revenue By Two Groups?


Source: PTC 2016 10-K, p.18


Recall on the previous slide, we showed that PTC’s recent segment reclassification resulted into three groups 


1) Solutions Group, 2) IoT Group, and 3) Professional Services.


However, when presenting its results to investors elsewhere in the 10-K, Professional Services are not 


separated, but incorporated into the previous two operating segments. Therefore, it appears management is 


saying one thing, but doing another when it comes to evaluating and presenting its financial results.

Obfuscating Disclosures in the 
Last Annual Report


(1) The Solutions Group segment includes depreciation of $5.4 million, $5.6 million and $5.7 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The IoT Group segment 


includes depreciation of $1.6 million, $1.0 million and $0.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Professional Services segment includes depreciation of 


$2.0 million, $2.2 million and $2.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Unallocated departments includes depreciation of $19.7 million, $20.1 million and 


$19.0 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Source: PTC 2016 10-K, F-42


Pay very close attention to the footnotes. 


PTC no longer provides disclosure about the restructuring charges per business segment! 


Under the new presentation unallocated expenses are significantly higher, which flatters segment profits.

PTC Expensive IoT Acquisition Hype…


PTC has gone on an expensive acquisition spree to build its IoT dream. The Company has announced 5 deals 


totaling ~$585m and paid an average of 7.5x revenues or >$1.2m per employee. Our concern about overpayment 


appears to be mirrored by ThingWorx’s CEO in the quote below.

PTC’s IoT Hype Machine


According to Goldman Sachs research, the IoT market is growing 40% and PTC’s bookings should be expected to 


grow 30%-40% (bottom left table). That’s not surprising given that PTC repeatedly cites many boutique research 


firms that flatter it with awards and claims it has market share leadership (bottom right table). 


One would naturally expect the market leader to grow at or above the market’s growth rate.

PTC’s Market Share Spin


PTC cannot seem to get its market share data straight. According to a recent slide (bottom right) from March 2017, 


management says its attractive target markets are $900m today. With just $90m of LTM sales, we estimate PTC’s 


market share is just 10%. This is well below the other research reports that PTC touts on the previous slides of 18% -


27% share. Also, PTC’s TAM has apparently shrunk from $1.1bn to $900m in the past two years (bottom left), despite 


more acquisitions that are supposed to add to their solution and selling capabilities.

quotes from research analysts. (1) We wanted to test these 


claims by looking at thought leadership from an independent 


angle. We view Twitter followers as a reasonable gauge of 


who’s thoughts are being followed. Sadly, we find that PTC’s 


ten thousand Thingworx followers ranks #15 on our list, well 


behind many technology heavyweights that compete with PTC 


in the IoT space.

Vague Metrics and Charts Promote IoT


PTC promotes its IoT business with vague charts referencing acceleration of transactions and expansion opportunities.


The problem is if you look carefully, many of the charts have no scale or no hard numbers to support its claims.

Is The CEO Misleading Investors?


Brace yourself carefully. PTC’s CEO either doesn’t know his business well or appears to be making misleading 


statements. At the recent Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference, the CEO said that PTC’s organic 


growth in IoT was 53% and that its license revenue crossed $100m.


On the next slide, we’ll illustrate true organic growth of just 8.6% and LTM revenues of $90m. It’s not surprising the 


CEO chooses the more aggressive interpretation of its revenues (annualizing the last quarter of IoT revenues) to 


claim it has $100m of sales.


CEO Heppelmann: “We have a lot of momentum. More than 1,200 customers. We put out 
a press release talking about our calendar 2016 results so that all the analysts could 
compare us to other people. The business grew more than 100% overall. But on an 
organic basis, grew 53%, and the revenue--license revenue crossed $100 million. So 
we're basically talking about a--if it were a standalone business, a unicorn--$100 million 
business growing more than 50%, 1,200 customers, and more than 250 partners who help 
us take it to market--resellers, system integrators, some OEM people who build it into 
some solution they sell, and so forth. So quite a large ecosystem--I'd argue the largest in 
the world of IoT, and a lot of momentum”

PTC’s IoT Business Sadly Disappoints….


For all of the hype and PTC promotion of its IoT business, we estimate true organic sales growth of just 8.6% from 


FY15-FY16. This is significantly below the 30%-40% market growth rate touted by research experts and management. 


Now management is trying to allocate more sales to IoT such as Navigate on a go forward basis to boost growth (1)

PTC’s IoT Business Will Be A Money 
Loser For A Long Time.…


Single digit revenue growth and a money losing operation that isn’t scaling should not get any investors excited 


about PTC’s promotional IoT business. At the ~8% organic growth rate, it will take PTC 10.5 years to achieve $200m 


in revenue, a run rate the CFO claims is the breakeven point. Are investors willing to wait this long?


Management‘s equity will vest and can cash out well in advance we suspect. 


Q1’2017 Earnings Conference Call


Analyst: “Okay, for Andy just two things. One, how are you thinking now about the profitability or eventual profitability of the IoT business. 


When you look at your numbers in fiscal 2016 according to the 10-K on a direct cost basis, IoT for the year had 116% of revenue in cost but 


for the fourth quarter it was only 104% which suggest you are getting a lot closer, on that basis the profitability for the IoT business, so if you 


could comment on that?”


CFO Miller: “So the profitability of IoT you know we basically think that as a software business exceeds that roughly $200 million in revenue, 


that’s really the point in time that assuming it’s still very high growth, that’s the point in time you tend to cross over into profitability”


IoT business not scaling 


well with losses increasing 


with more revenue.

Less Transparency and Model Pivot..


Investors should be cautioned that PTC abruptly changed its focus on the logo metric to evaluate its IoT business in 


2016. Initially the CEO touted how important it was to evaluate, but quickly started back-tracking and cited a move 


towards a freemium program which makes it less meaningful.  


CEO on Q1’16 Conference Call: “We grew our IoT new logo count 55% year-over-year, landing 65 new IoT customers in the 


quarter…I think if you look at IoT, you know, you can look at it from two perspectives. The main perspective that we think 


about is new logos. It's an early market and in an early market, market share is everything. And so we've been running a 


land-and-expand type of go-to-market program which is a little new for us, quite frankly. And so we've really pushed on 


new logo acquisition. And that's where you see the most impressive data. New logo is up 55%, I think it was.”


CEO on Q2’16 Conference Call: So coming back to the core of ThingWorx offering, we landed 66 new logos in the quarter, 


bringing our first half total to 131, which is a 26% increase year-over-year. We'll continue to update you on this new logo metric as 


it's currently defined throughout the balance of the fiscal year. But at that point, the metric will need to be remodeled a bit, 


because it does not reflect customers who start with Kepware or Vuforia of which there are many, nor does it now 


reflect the new way we engage accounts via the premium program that we recently put in place. So while we want to 


report a metric that reflects momentum, this metric, as currently defined, is starting to fall out of alignment with how we run the 


Technology Platform business


CEO on Q4’16 Conference Call:  “We landed 81 new ThingWorx logos in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 275. As 


we've discussed in the last few quarters, we've provided this new logo metric – over the past two years actually – as a way to 


help gauge market traction with new customers. While I'm pleased with our new logo success rate, our pivot towards a 


freemium program as a more efficient way to engage new accounts makes this new logo metric a bit less meaningful. 


So we'll also begin to share a few other key metrics around our freemium program moving forward.”

With Decreasing Revenue Quality


PTC would like investors to believe its IoT business is primarily subscription sales and high quality revenue.


However, looking closely we see that “recurring revenues” as a % of total IoT sales has been declining along with 


average revenue per IoT customer.

And Founders and Executives Fleeing…


Only two business leaders remain currently affiliated with PTC post-acquisition.


That’s the risk that’s run when overpaying for technology companies.


It’s easy for founders and executives to set sail and leave behind a managerial void for the acquirer.

Management Background Is Controversial

Prior Company / Role What Happened


James
Heppelmann


CEO
Metaphase Technology / 


CTO
1992 - 1997


In 1992, SDRC and Control Data Systems, Inc. established a JV, Metaphase 
Technology, to market product data management software. From 1992-1994, 
executives at SDRC inflated revenue and earnings through fictitious revenues. A 
material amount of the improperly recognized revenue was based on purchase 
orders containing conditional language ("conditional purchase orders") from 
SDRC's Far East Operations. Neither of the Heppelmann’s were named in the 
complaint. (Source: SEC Litigation, April 1997)

Autodesk / VP Finance 
and Chief Accounting 
Officer and Controller


2003 – 2008


On August 17, 2006, Autodesk announced that its Audit Committee was 
conducting a voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option granting 
practices and related accounting issues. The SEC also investigated Autodesk. As a 
result of the findings, Autodesk’s balance sheet, income and cash flow 
statements from 2002-2006 could no longer be relied upon and were restated. 
During the review, Autodesk also determined that it incorrectly recorded certain 
credits to resellers. As a result, adjustments were made to increase net revenues 
and decrease deferred revenue by $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in 
fiscal 2005 (Source: Autodesk 10-K)


Silicon Graphics /
Director of Finance


1991-1998


A Securities complaint and litigation commenced that in 1995 Silicon Graphics 
executives operated as a fraud and issued false and issued misleading 
statements which enabled insiders to exercise options and sell stock at inflated 
prices before disappointment emerged due to serious problems with: 1) recently 
reorganized North American sales force 2) weak demand in Europe 3) weak sales 
to OEM customers 4) sluggish gov’t sales and 5) a shortage of ASIC chips for use 
in its new products. The case was eventually dismissed, Miller wasn’t named in 
the dispute (Source: Case filing)


PTC’s current CEO and CFO have been affiliated with controversial companies in the past.

CEO Seems Like A Self-Promotion Expert


In our opinion, the resume of PTC’s CEO is littered with self-aggrandizement, including references to himself as a “dynamic 


speaker” and “thought leader.”  However, what shocks Spruce Point the most is that he cites “highly influential” articles co-


authored with Michael porter, a well known strategy professor from Harvard who served on PTC’s Board from 1995 - 2015. 


Porter also received special consulting fees for attending events sponsored by PTC for existing and potential clients.(1)  


Viewed from this context, it appears to us that PTC effectively paid a Harvard Professor to burnish the CEO’s image.

Management Likes “Fake News”


In our opinion, PTC’s management makes heavy use of self-promotional news it creates to fill space on its 


website. Unfortunately, all of its ‘news’ about winning awards, being named a leader in its space, and 


forming partnerships is not resulting in much revenue, GAAP earnings, or operating cash flow growth

PTC Makes Financial Targets Easy For 
Management To Collect Cash Bonuses


We will illustrate that PTC’s cash bonus for management is a constant moving target of esoteric financial metrics 


rarely used by peers in its industry.  The bar appears to keep getting lower and lower.


Source: 2015 Proxy Statement


Source: 2014 Proxy Statement

84


If At First You Don’t Succeed, Try Changing 
The Bonus Metrics Again


When management failed to hit its target in 2015, it changed the target yet again and re-scaled its ACV target lower 


(next slide). The Comp Committee also gave the CEO a pass for failing to hit Non-GAAP EPS targets defined at his 


promotion to CEO in 2010 and covering periods through 2013-2015. It allowed 49.7% of the unearned award to vest. 


In our opinion, this practice has created moral hazard, and given PTC’s executives additional confidence to inflate 


financial performance to realize value for its considerable “free” equity grants.  It’s also noteworthy that PTC ties 


none of its executive cash bonuses to performance in IoT which it promotes as a significant growth driver. In fact, 


the latest proxy statement only mentions IoT once. Also notice the “3x” multiplier which differs from the 2x multiplier 


promoted to investors. 


(1) Amounts also include additional compensation expense associated with modification of the 2013 and 2014 performance-based awards as described above in Compensation 


Discussion and Analysis under “2013 and 2014 Performance-Based Equity” and “CEO Long-Term Performance-Based Equity Award” on page 33. The modification amounts for the 


executives were: Mr. Heppelmann, $5,036,205; Mr. Glidden, $780,123; Mr. Cohen, $1,132,850; Mr. DiBona, 811,850; and Mr. Ranaldi, $872,035.

85


Highly Questionable Bonus Calculation


PTC’s bridge to pay executives cash compensation on Non-GAAP operating expenses has Spruce Point concerned. First, PTC 


omits restructuring charges, which we’ve argued are suspect and have been reoccurring for 5 years. Secondly, PTC omits 


selected expenses related to acquisitions tied to its IoT strategy. Conveniently, PTC doesn’t remove acquisition contributions to 


its other performance metric of Subscription ACV! Lastly, PTC uses a similar sleight-of-hand in removing excess incentive 


compensation. Again, PTC gets all the benefit to its Subscription ACV performance metric, but wants to exclude a portion of the 


costs. Not surprisingly, PTC’s Non-GAAP operating expense of $646.2m just barely beat its threshold target of  $648.2m!

Promoter View Vs. Reality


What The Stock Promoters Say Spruce Point’s View


Seaport Global (BUY $69):


• “The IIoT is still in early days, but PTC has already grown 


IIoT to $100MM in sales, up organically 50% YoY in 2016”


• “PTC's transition to subscription pricing vastly exceeded 


expectations, pulling forward transition-related trough 


revenues/earnings ~2 years early (FQ1:17). Therefore, PTC 


is now at an inflection point as revenues/margins accelerate, 


in our view”


Goldman Sachs (Buy: $58)


• “A higher recurring revenue mix drives better FCF”


• “Synergies between the core CAD/PLM business and the IoT 


platform”


• “30-40% higher lifetime value of a customer”


Wedbush (Buy: $59): Investment thesis (#1 point) PTC is 


proving its ability to control costs, even in a mixed 


macroeconomic environment.


Brean Capital (Buy: $62): With the most comprehensive IoT 


platform offering in the marketplace and an early market 


leadership position, we believe PTC’s IoT assets (which include 


its CAD and PLM product portfolio) could prove to be highly 


strategic for any large tech bellwethers who want to pursue this 


large market opportunity


• Check your math carefully. We calculate an anemic 


growth rate of just 8.6% and LTM sales of $90m. A 


majority of the sales growth is acquired, and we don’t 


believe PTC has done a great job extracting value. 


• “Pulling forward” (aka stealing from the future) implies 


difficulty ahead because all of the easy gains have been 


made already. We believe PTC’s bookings 


outperformance is due to moderate, and revenue 


acceleration and margin improvement is not guaranteed


• Then explain why Q1 cash flow was negative for the first 


time ever and why is % of recurring revenue in IoT 


declining?


• How exactly are synergies being derived when PTC 


runs each IoT business separately and revenue per IoT 


customer and % of recurring revenues are declining


• …Life time value assuming they stick around and 


renew; PTC won’t disclose churn


Is that so? We question the frequent and recurring 


restructuring charges. GAAP operating expenses were 


up $159m with revenues down $26m from FY11-16


Stoking the takeover angle huh? PTC has paid a 


whopping 7.5x sales multiple for a collection of disparate 


assets growing single digits, not making money, and not 


scaling. Why would anyone step in to acquire it now? All 


the large tech players (IBM, Google, MSFT, Amazon) 


have their own solutions

We’ve reviewed comparable acquisitions in the technical software and electronic data automation over the 


past decade and find that average takeover multiples of NTM Sales and EBITDA are approximately 3.5x and 


14x, respectively. Given that PTC’s current multiples are 6x and 24x we find that its shares are richly valued 


and exceed any control premium multiple that a logical acquirer would pay.

PTC Trading At An Unjustified 
Premium To Its Peers 


PTC’s overvaluation is easy to observe from its current relative valuation to peers. It cannot be explained by abnormal 


revenue growth or better cash flow margins. Investors’ are overly fixated on PTC’s Non-GAAP EPS growth, which we 


have illustrated is an unreliable measure of the Company’s performance.

Spruce Point Intermediate Term Price Reference Ranges


By all measures, PTC’s share price is overvalued. Given the numerous accounting distortions in PTC’s 


reporting that affects EBITDA and EPS, we believe the best way to value its shares are on a multiple of 


revenues and operating cash flow.  For the sake of argument, we assume management’s 2017E figures, and 


apply a more realistic multiple to discount our concerns. We see approximately 50% – 60% downside risk


$ in millions, except per share amounts


1) 77% of PTC’s cash is held outside of the U.S; it may be appropriate to discount its value assuming a 35% repatriation rate


2) Management has guided to $127-$137m of Free Cash Flow. We increase this figure by $25m, PTC historical annual capital expenditures
