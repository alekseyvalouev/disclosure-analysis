China Green Agriculture: Why This Chinese Class Action Lawsuit Is
Different Than the Rest

On Friday a highly regarded law firm, Saxena White P.A., announced it has commenced a
class action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders of China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA), by
filing a detailed 46 page complaint (available for downloading here) with the US District
Court of Nevada. What makes this lawsuit stand out from previous cases is that it is
supported by much stronger evidence (see the table below) resulting in some very serious
allegations made by an experienced team of lawyers (Saxena White’s partners came from
Milberg Weiss, the nation’s first and formerly largest class action outfit that won over $45
billion for defrauded shareholders over its 30 year history; including $7.2 billion from
Enron). Since leaving Milberg, Saxena White attorneys have won large settlements over
the past several years, most notably $53.3 million from Sirva, Inc. and $34.4 million from
Cablevision Systems.


I will now summarize the major findings laid out in great detail in Saxena White’s complaint
along with CGA management’s explanations:


1. Value Added Tax (VAT) Paid. According to its press release dated September 13,
2010 (available here), CGA management stated that during the two-year period ending
June 2010, it made VAT payments totaling approximately $9.4 million to the Chinese
State Administration of Taxation (SAT). However, SAT records Saxena White cites in
its lawsuit clearly show miniscule VAT payments made over this period totaling less
than $100,000 (a copy of the records and the due diligence report prepared by IFRA is
available for download here). CGA management’s explanation to date simply
describes these records as “incomplete.” Despite the falling stock price, analyst
downgrades and resignation of their IR firm CGA management has not produced any
evidence to counter this claim. Intelligent investors must assume at this point that

these were phantom payments and over $9 million in company funds are plainly
missing.


2. Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Paid. In this same press release, CGA management
stated it paid “RMB 14,466,731.61 (approximately $2.1 million) in March 2009 for the
CIT incurred for calendar 2008” and “RMB21,040,562.21 (approximately $3.1 million)
in March 2010 for the CIT incurred for calendar 2009.” First of all, this statement that
corporate tax was paid in March of the year following its accrual is inconsistent with
Chinese tax regulation requiring quarterly pre-payment of CIT. More importantly,
IFRA’s due diligence report included the official SAT record, which showed no income
taxes paid by CGA. Management once again has produced no evidence to the
contrary. Therefore investors can only conclude that another $5.2 million is
unaccounted for.


3. Greenhouse Land Purchase. On September 25, 2009, at the depths of the global
financial crisis, CGA management stated the company paid approximately $10.8
million to purchase 88 acres of rural farmland in Shaanxi Province (an economically
less developed Province in Western China). Detailed records obtain by IFRA (available
here) from multiple government sources (including the deed tax paid on the
transaction) all clearly show that the actual price paid was only $2.7 million.
Management responded to the evidence by claiming that the $8.1 million difference
was paid to an undisclosed state-owned company they identify as the “seller” of the
land, despite no public record of this payment and existence of the aforementioned
“seller”. Once again, management failed to offer any proof of this payment and
investors must add another $8.1 to the growing pile of unaccounted money.


4. Gufeng Acquisition. On July 2, 2010, CGA management closed the acquisition of
Beijing Gufeng Chemical Products Co., Ltd., ("Gufeng"), for a total consideration, cash
plus stock, of $31.8 million plus a commitment to fund another $14.7 million toward
Gufeng’s working capital needs. Gufeng’s selling shareholder, in return, promised the
company would make at least $10.6 million net income in the 12 months following the
sale or else give back some of the CGA shares paid. This acquisition makes no
financial sense for CGA shareholders. Gufeng was historically unprofitable, poorly
managed, with production lines that CGA plans to replace and upgrade at significant
cost to produce an entirely different type of organic fertilizer that CGA must then find a
market for. IFRA calculated the replacement cost of Gufeng’s plant at less than half the
price CGA paid. The $10.6 million net income “guarantee” is completely unobtainable.
CGA significantly overpaid untold millions for Gufeng. Investors should consider at
least $10 million in wasted money. Combined with the missing tax and land payments
mentioned above there is over $32 million unaccounted for.

By comparison, the following table shows that other Chinese securities class action suits
filed in the last three months are based on much less evidence:

So what happens next? CGA management has been dodging the issues for over two
months now, leaving me little reason to believe they can ever explain these discrepancies.
Even CGA’s former highly paid and well-regarded IR firm quit out of frustration over
management’s inability to address the issues. Will a court date force CGA management to
defend themselves or will they just “go dark” and stop reporting to their investors as in the
case of China Expert Tech (OTC:CXTI)? In that case investors will lose everything and the
lawyers get nothing. Alternatively and more likely, CGA management will fight the charges
but still lose, resulting in a mess of earnings restatements and eventual financial
settlement with the plaintiffs. To prevent further loss, shareholders should band together to
insist that CGA’s Board appoint a controller to make sure the company’s cash and other
assets are secure.


Thankfully the analyst community got CGA right. They have more or less been
consistently cautious in their research reports thus protecting their clients in a way they
rarely do. This time those suffering loss are mainly the “quant” funds and others who
never performed any real due diligence or read my prior articles on Seeking Alpha.
