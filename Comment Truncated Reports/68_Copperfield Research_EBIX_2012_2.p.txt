EBIX: If The SEC
Cometh, The SEC
Will Findeth (Or
So We Suspect)
Dec. 5, 2012 11:51 AM ET10 comments | Includes: Ebix Inc…


Today we published a report on Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX). It can be found in its
entirety at:

Below is a piece of the report. THE REPORT SHOULD BE READ IN ITS
ENTIRETY AS THE SEGMENT BELOW ONLY CONTAINS HIGHLIGHTS
AND THE APPROPRIATE REFERENCES ARE FOUND IN THE FULL
REPORT:


On March 24th, 2011, we shared our first research report on Ebix in a three
part series that was published on the main page of Seeking Alpha.[1] We
argued among other things that Ebix had: misrepresented organic growth,
been reporting questionable cash flow generated by a potentially illegal tax
scheme, multiple auditor resignations, governance abuses, and a highly
promotional, contentious CEO. We concluded that Ebix was nothing more than
a roll-up with a misrepresented business model. Further, our analysis detailed
a lack of de novo growth, which was supplemented with two tactics: tax
arbitrage and destructive cost cuts (headcount reductions and offshoring). We
questioned the sustainability of this strategy and notified the IRS and SEC of
the material abuses we believed were so pervasive at Ebix. Since our original
report, damaging information has materialized, including accusations from
former employees of Peak that Ebix made "Fraudulent Misrepresentations"
and "acted with utter disregard and recklessness." It is our opinion that
the malfeasance at Ebix is even more egregious than what occurred at OCZ,

which we wrote about last year.[2] Since our report on OCZ, the CEO and CFO
have resigned, the stock has declined by 85%, and the company disclosed an
SEC investigation on November 21, 2012.[3]


Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported that the SEC is currently
conducting an investigation into Ebix in a story titled "Ebix Accounting
Practices Said to Be Probed by SEC."[4] According to Bloomberg, the SEC
investigation has been ongoing for the past year and is "focused on revenue
recognition, internal controls and the accuracy of the company's public
statements to shareholders." The Bloomberg article cited information from four
different sources, including three former Ebix employees who had conducted
interviews with the SEC, as well as naming the specific SEC attorney leading
the investigation. The article implied the investigation also focused on "Ebix's
strategy of booking U.S. revenues to units based in Singapore and India"
which we criticized as the heart of Ebix's potentially illegal tax scheme. Since
our initial report, we believe the ingredients for a full blown SEC investigation
have only grown. In this brief report, we will discuss: 1) The SEC
Correspondence History and a Vociferous Denial. Despite ardently denying any
knowledge of an SEC investigation, Ebix has filed 40 comment and response
exchanges with the SEC. Mysteriously, the public exchanges with the SEC
stopped around the same time Bloomberg reports that an investigation began.
2) The Continued Misrepresentation of Growth and Altered Disclosures. Based
on recent public disclosures, we believe Ebix has continued to misrepresent its
growth, and in fact organic growth was NEGATIVE in Q3'12. Ebix reported
1H'12 pro-forma organic growth in the most recent 10Q that does not
reconcile with the figures provided in the 10Q's from the first and second
quarter. An amended 10Q from the first quarter introduced new disclosures for
pro-forma revenues that were not presented in the original filing. Based on our
analysis, Ebix may have misrepresented its pro-forma revenue growth in the
first and second quarter 10Q's by 30x compared to the 0.2% that was implied
in the third quarter 10Q. Investors that bought Ebix stock in the first two
quarters of 2012 may have done so on the basis of organic growth numbers
that were overstated. 3) The Damning Accusations made in the Peak Lawsuit.
Another acquired company is suing Ebix for failing to make earn-out
payments. The plaintiff's testimony describes countless examples of
dysfunction, misrepresentation, and insufficient internal accounting controls at
Ebix. The lawsuit provides vivid accusations of behavior that ranges from
unscrupulous to incompetent, including an example where "Ebix's own CFO

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1341841-ebix-if-the-sec-cometh-the-sec-will-findeth-or-so-we-suspect 3/10


and Controller [were] unable to agree on Peak's revenue….and in fact
disagree[d] by more than $800,000 over a one year period." Despite the
severity of the accusations, we have been unable to find disclosures of the
Peak lawsuit in Ebix's most recent SEC quarterly filings. Should the allegations
levied against Ebix be true (failure to manage billing, collection, sales, taxes,
regulatory payments, and accounting for Peak), then it would seem probable
that those same failures would be found by the SEC at the corporate level. 4)
Additional Lawsuits and Contingent Payments. Ebix is facing at least two class
action lawsuits that appear headed to trial. One class action complaint includes
testimony from a former senior Ebix employee who corroborates the
dysfunction and weak internal controls alleged in the Peak lawsuit. This
incriminating evidence may be integral to any investigation the SEC has
launched. Further, Ebix also faces at least two lawsuits accusing them of failing
to pay earn-outs. With $30 million of balance sheet earn-out liabilities,
investors may begin to view this line as a debt-equivalent, and question "one-
time" P&L benefits from reversing the earn-outs. 5) Our Original $9.00 Target
Did Not Consider SEC or IRS Action. For a roll-up business with negative
organic growth, overstated margins given limited investment in the business,
quality of earnings issues, the potential for a massive overhang from
regulatory investigations, lawsuits, and the possibility of significant liability or
fines relating to the questionable tax strategy, we now believe that a more
appropriate multiple should be 4x to 5x LTM EBITDA. This would be
approximately $5.50 to $7.70 per share, or downside risk of 55% to 68%.
