Don't Believe In Affymax - The Stock Is Probably Worthless

Investors in Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY) would like you to believe that Omontys will make a
miraculous comeback and that Affymax will be a major winner. My belief is that the last
AFFY article contained multiple factual errors that when refuted show that the future for
Omontys is in fact dire. At the conclusion of this article all doubt should be removed
regarding the low likelihood that Omontys returns to market.


Truth #1: The Death Rate of Epogen is 0.0027% vs. 0.024% of OMONTYS


Falsehood #1: The Death Rate of Epogen is 0.85% vs. 0.02% of OMONTYS


This error comes from mixing data from www.drugcite.com with the safety data that was
reported by the company. The data from drugcite shows "For each adverse event listed,
percent (%) represents percentage of the adverse event to all adverse events reported for
the drug. Percent does not represent a rate related to drug utilization." In essence, a
comparison between drugcite adverse event rates and those of a patient population is
comparing apples and oranges. This is incorrect data analysis and should be discarded in
favor of analysis which compares the number of treated patients in each group who die in
the same period of treatment. The correct analysis is further explained below.


Truth #2: Europe was never going to approve Omontys due to safety concerns


Falsehood #2: European approval is merely delayed due to ongoing root cause
analysis


The most recent Affymax article states that Takeda withdrew from consideration for
European approval "because they were doing the "root cause analysis" they would not be
able to complete the investigation because it was still in process and "ongoing" despite the
fact that severe reactions were not present at the time of the clinical trials." However, there
is no evidence to support this conclusion. The truth is that we showed you an excerpt
directly from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that stated the CHMP
"was of the provisional opinion that Omontys could not have been approved" due to "study
results indicating that Omontys may increase the risk of death or heart and circulatory
problems." It is clear that the EU application was withdrawn because Takeda
(OTCPK:TKPHF) could not get Omontys approved due to its safety profile.

Truth #3: Fresenius (NYSE:FMS) is running away from Omontys


Falsehood #3: Fresenius supports Omontys


The prior article wants investors to believe that Fresenius supports Omontys based on a
letter from Fresenius from February 13, 2013. Again, this is an out of context data point
because the recall did not happen until February 23, 2013. Pasting an outdated letter to
suggest that Fresenius is comfortable with the Omontys safety profile is not relevant,
especially in light of the recent conversation we had with Fresenius IR during which they
stated they would not "risk its franchise on a drug with unknowns like Omontys."


Truth #4: Epogen is safer than Omontys


Falsehood #4: Omontys is just as safe as Epogen


The last article wants investors to believe "Apples to Apples (not Apples to Oranges) --
each drug projected to 260,000 doses, the calculation shows that OMONTYS actually has
less fatalities than Epogen." Yet again, this is incorrect analysis because the safety data
we cited in our prior article was based on patient numbers and not on dose numbers. The
safety data that shows Epogen is safer than Omontys is based on 25,000 Omontys
patients being treated for approximately 2 months as opposed to 260,000 Epogen patients
being treated for a full year when the data is adjusted for the fact that the data covers a
period 6x longer for Epogen (12 months) as compared to Omontys (approximately 2
months). It is statistically invalid to do a comparison between the number of deaths in a
patient population treated for a year and a patient population treated for only 2 months.
The Baird analyst made the appropriate adjustments, and it clearly shows that Omontys is
9x more likely to cause a patient to die as compared to Epogen.


Conclusion


The recent article on Affymax recommending the stock on the potential for Omontys to
return to market draws the wrong conclusions based on outdated data and incorrect
analytical methods. The truth is that Omontys is more dangerous than Epogen, the EU
was well aware of the safety problems, and Fresenius is running away from the drug. It
remains our conclusion that Omontys is unlikely to be approved to return to market and
that Affymax's stock will probably be worthless.
