Beijing Offices Still seems to be Closed One year after the Beijing Authorities Raid.
Neighbor said that the office is closed most of the time, "occasionally someone would
come over". Too me it looks like NHTC itself knows it's better off operating in the
shadow. That much for a Legit Business.Revenue Decreasing at 2-digit pace during
the last 2 quarters of 2016 Q4 Bottom line (and consequently CF) "altered" by a sudden
12.87% Decrease in Commissions paid (from 47.38% to 34.51%). Commissions are
Crucial to keep old and attract new Members. Lower Commission help the bottom line in
the near term but destroy the business in the long run. You Clean the numbers for this
"Trick" and you realize how Q4 2016 was the worst Quarterly Net Income Results
since Q1 2015.


January 2016, I posted a blog warning NHTC Investors that the Police had Raided and
"Shut Down" the Beijing NHTC Offices ( Link). The following day, the Company issued
a"damage-repair" PR denying all the allegation and claiming what happened was not a
raid but just a "meeting with the Beijing Chaoyang District SAIC and the Public Security
Bureau".


Furthermore, during the Q1 2016 Earnings Call on 2016-04-27, The Company stated
that the Beijing Office was closed for Renovation (Note that we always Claimed it was
shut down by authorities):


DEAR READER, GUESS WHAT:… The Beijing Office as of Today (and last week) …
still seems to be closed (9 Months Later)! Neighbor said that the office is closed most
of the time, "occasionally someone would come over".

A Missing "G" … that much for Completed Renovation … hahaha


Why is the Beijing Office Still Closed … one year after the Beijing Authorities Raid?


Why is the Beijing Office Still Closed… ten months after the "1-month long Renovation
explanation" given by the Company?


THESE FINDINGS WOULD LEAD A SUSPICIOUS INVESTOR TO BELIEVE THAT
AUTHORITIES DID INDEED SHUT DOWN THE BEIJING OFFICE IN JANUARY 2016
& THAT THE"1-MONTH RENOVATION" WAS JUST A WAY TO TEMPORAIRLY
MASK THE SHUT DOWN (at least they changed the doors). NO MORE EXCUSES 1
YEAR LATER.


Revenue has been decreasing at double digit rates over the last 2 Quarters:

In Q3 2016 the company posted the Lowers Operating Cash Flow (5.9m) since Q2 2014
(4.5m). Q4 results were altered by substantially lower commissions payout to members
(not a good idea long term).


Q4 bottom Line Results as well as Cash Flow were altered by a 12.87% reduction in
Commissions paid (Q1 2015 to Q2 2016 average was 47.38%, while Q4 2016
commissions amounted to "only" 34.51% of Revenue).


This abrupt Change in Commissions as % of Revenue is very suspicious and,
while it helps the Company mitigate Bottom Line damages from a shrinking business in
the Short term, it only worsens the problem for the coming Quarter s(when current
Members will leave and fewer new members will be attracted).

If we take into account this "Lower Commissions (34.51%) in Q4 2016 Trick", we can
see how in Q4, under the normal Commissions Regime of 47.38%, Net Income
would have been 11m USD instead of the 19m USD figure Reported. 11m USD
would have been the worse Quarterly Net Income since Q1 2015.


The Same Logic Applies for Free Cash Flows (in this Case however, it would have been
the 2 nd worse Figure since Q3 2014).


Interesting is the relationship between Historical Market Capitalization (Green) of the
Company and Quarterly Free Cash Flow (Yellow). In Q3 2016 it broke down. Based on
current Free Cash Flow, NHTC should go back to 2014 Valuation (65% downside Risk).
