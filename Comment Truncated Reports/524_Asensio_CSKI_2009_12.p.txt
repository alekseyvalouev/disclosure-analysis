The China Sky Routine: Another Press Release,
Another Unimportant Drug.


Posted on June 2, 2009 by Asensio.com


Today China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) issued a press


release stating that the company had received production approval


for yet another drug, diclofenac sodium eye drops. The press


release states that the eye drops product is expected to contribute


$0.5 million to revenues in its first year of sales.


Diclofenac is a standard anti-inflammatory drug used for a wide


range of purposes. In some countries, diclofenac is approved for


over-the-counter use, and for eye drops. Diclofenac eye drops are


used to treat non-bacterial inflammation of the anterior part of the


eyes, especially with postoperative treatment following cataract


surgery, as an alternative to steroids.


The only interesting issue here is why China Sky chooses to issue a


press release for a product that is not proprietary, that has limited


uses, and that will, according to the company, produce sales


comprising 0.4% of the $128 million in revenues included in the


company’s 2009 guidance. China Sky did not disclose if they would


earn a profit on the sales. And of course, the release sheds no new


light on China Sky’s unexplained low inventory and high margins.
