For the last 15 years, NovaGold’s management team has systematical-ly misled investors with subjective presentation of information about 
a deposit so remote and technically challenging that the mine will never 
be built. During that time, management has been treating this 12-person 
concept company like an ATM, awarding themselves base salaries that 
rival those of the CEOs at Newmont and Barrick and total compensation 
packages comparable with those at Rio and BHP. If the information from 
the company’s feasibility studies were presented in a more honest light, 
investors would understand that the Donlin deposit, of which they own 
50%, is not feasible to put into production at any gold price. 


Management deliberately misleads investors with custom metrics de-
signed to deceive, directing investors to presentations which claim the 
deposit will require $6.7 bln in capital, however, the feasibility study 
clearly shows this number is $8 bln (already, we believe, far too low). The 
proposed natural gas pipeline central to powering the project is dead on 
arrival. The terrain around the Donlin deposit is among the most inhospi-
table on the planet. Based on recent cost-per-inch/mile data we obtained 
from ICF,1 we show the costs of the pipeline (if someone were even to 
attempt to build it) are likely in excess of $3 bln, two to four times higher 
than management’s previous forecast. One engineer we spoke with who 
worked on costing the pipeline told us he doesn’t know of any engineer-
ing company that has the experience to build such a complex pipeline.


Management has a long history of over-promising. The Galore Creek 
project, once promoted as the company’s key asset, was quietly sold at 
a loss in 2018 after revised capex estimates increased by 5x. 


In short, this is a stock promote, not a mining plan.

NG’s silver-tongued CEO is already preparing the ground for the inevitable 
pipeline failure by focusing investors on the potential for a higher-grade, 
smaller mine. Management has drilled only 16 drill holes since 2011 and not 
even released the modeling results of the last, meager exploratory drill as-
says in 2017. If the grade had improved, they would be shouting it from the 
rooftops.


Management's narrative hasn't convinced everyone, Barrick (GOLD US), 
NovaGold’s 50:50 joint-venture partner and the largest gold miner in the 
world, is so unenthusiastic about the project that Barrick hasn't included 
Donlin in its new 10-year program, despite this year’s higher gold price. 
“We’re not changing the rules on this,” Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said on 
the Q4 earnings call on February 12, 2020 when asked about Donlin. The 
rule Bristow was referring to was Barrick’s estimate of capital costs and 
return based on a long-term gold price of $1,200 per ounce. Contrast this 
with Bristow’s comments on Skeena Resources’ (SKE V) Eskay Creek asset, 
which he characterized as “the value being uncovered by our partners at 
Eskay Creek in British Columbia.” Unlike NovaGold, Skeena’s management 
team isn’t promotional, which explains why Skeena’s market cap is just 
one-sixth of NovaGold’s.


Management’s game is clear: keep investors interested in the stock while 
they rake in huge salaries. Construction of the Donlin mine was originally 
expected to start in 2008. Now, 12 years later, management’s best guess is 
that construction may start in 2022 and production in 2028. The icing on 
the cake? Taking advantage of renewed market enthusiasm due to higher 
gold prices by cashing equity to the tune of $35 mln, $25 mln of which 
was in the last 12 months.

our strategy

time. A wise

Pipeline: Project Killer


Donlin is more an infrastructure project than a mine. The gold is in mi-
croscopic deposits in igneous rock. To power the processing machinery to 
grind the rock small enough that gold can be chemically leached out, Don-
lin would require a 220 MW power plant, sufficient to supply electricity 
to a city of 500,000 people. It would be the largest power plant in Alaska 
and increase the electricity produced in that state by about 40%. To fuel 
the power plant, management claim they can build a 316-mile pipeline. We 
think itâ€™s a dead letter.

Management's biggest misrepresentation is around the cost to build the 
pipeline. They estimated it would cost $1 bln, or $230,544 per inch/mile (the 
standard unit for costing pipelines), however we have found that a com-
parable pipeline (Mackenzie pipeline) was costed out in 2013 for double 
that price--$471,111—and abandoned in December 20172 after more than a 
decade of planning and despite all approvals achieved because it was just 
too expensive to build. 


We consulted a pipeline expert who was familiar with the project. He 
reluctantly agreed with our view that the cost and difficulty of building 
the 316-mile pipeline that Donlin's remote location necessitates makes it 
improbable it's a viable option for the company. We walked him through 
our assumptions for the pipeline, and he confirmed our rough estimates 
that the pipeline capex would run 200-400% of management's forecast. 


Applying the inch/mile costing used on the Mackenzie Pipeline to the 
Donlin site, we arrive at a capex cost of twice that given by manage-
ment--$2.09 bln. The 750-mile, 30-inch Mackenzie Pipeline was costed at 
$10.6 bln in December 2013, or an inch/mile cost of $471,111.3 The inch/
mile costing metric eliminates the cost differences between 14 inches and

30 inches. The Mackenzie pipeline is useful for comparison because the: 
Mackenzie River Delta of Canada's Northwest Territories has a similar cli-
mate and geology to the adjacent Alaskan territory and the Donlin project 
pipeline,4 albeit milder, with less permafrost.


In addition to initial lowballing of cost, we believe that as a result of cost 
inflation, the pipeline cost could exceed $3.8 bln. Data from the Interstate 
Natural Gas Association of America show that costs have risen by 82% 
since 2012, when the Donlin pipeline was costed out.5


4  Volumes 1, 2 and 3 of Imperial Oil’s Application for the Mackenzie Gathering System 
outline the project https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Item/View/3892106, we spoke with 
a pipeline engineer familiar with Donlin and he agreed the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline was a 
comparable pipeline but not necessarily a 1:1 ratio as the logistics cost for larger diameter 
pipes may be higher.

The pipeline would be one of the most difficult ever built, with 95% of the 
terrain hilly or mountainous. The pipeline route is frozen for seven months 
of the year, and the discontinuous permafrost creates engineering com-
plexity, as the ground in spring turns to wetlands and bogs the machinery. 
Each of 300 stream crossings will require a temporary bridge, and dam, 
and two pits, one on either side of the stream, for the drilling equipment to 
bore a hole under the stream. The estimated construction time is three to 
four years. 


Pipeline unit costs have 
increased 82% since the 


feasability study.


Data is based on 35,000 miles 
of actual pipeline construction 
up 2013-2017 and estimates 
41,000 miles 2018-2035 over 


a wide variety of terrain.

The expert we spoke with confirmed “There isn’t a lot of contractor/indus-
try experience anywhere for the permafrost and environmental issues you 
might encounter.” There are also changes that will need to be made for 
environmental reasons that have not been included in pipeline estimates, 
and those changes will add cost. 


The mine’s own feasibility study stated that accuracy of the capital cost 
estimate is considered to be between -15% and +30%. But mines are never 
built for less; they are always built for more. Mining construction projects 
on average have cost overruns of 62%, according to a survey by Ernst and 
Young.6

Plan B: Also a bust
Likely preparing investors for the inevitable "pivot" when it becomes clear 
that the pipeline won't work, the management team started to claim they 
could solve the power issue by barging diesel 194 miles up the Kuskokwim 
River. This looks even less plausible than the pipeline, according to data 
buried in the feasibility study. Even if NovaGold reduced the mine capacity 
by half, it could not barge in enough diesel to operate the power plant.


The current mine configuration would require 1.1 ML (Mega Liters or 1 
mln liters) of diesel per day or 403 ML per year to fuel the power plant. 
The total diesel that can be barged up the river is at best is 253 ML. The 
mine vehicles alone would consume 151 ML per year. 


The Donlin Mine has been granted environmental approval for 58 round 
trips by fuel barges per year of operation. Given restrictions imposed by 
river flow, each fuel barge trip could transport on average around 4.2 ML. 
After mine vehicle use, that would leave enough diesel to power the plant 
for between 67 and 93 days. Under the most optimistic scenario, cutting 
production to half of what is now planned, the diesel barged in would be 
sufficient for at most seven months of operations per year, essentially re-
ducing output to a quarter of what is now planned.

NG tries to square the circle


Investors shouldn't be surprised with the narrative change. For years, NG 
management has been trying to find a way around the fundamental prob-
lem of getting energy to the site. They have floated the idea of a coal-fired 
plant, wind turbines—even biomass. 


In the earliest days of the mine, it was to be grid-connected by a power 
line that would take three years to construct. The only problem was the 
grid they were planning to connect to did not have the power to supply the 
project. Then they tried coal. The coal power was to be from a new mine-
mouth power plant in Healy. Our favorite idea was the possibility of us-
ing peat near the mine. Wind power was considered for 20% of the mine’s 
power needs in 2006 and diesel for the balance. “We have gone with on-
site diesel power with wind cogeneration,” said the CEO on February 24, 
2009.

Fool’s gold
With all permits for Donlin secured and close to all-time-high gold prices, 
management is stalling for time: investors are being asked to wait for an-
other feasibility study. Management is dangling the idea that there might 
be an even bigger mine and richer deposits, even though Donlin already 
has a large enough reserve for 27 years of mine life:


“There are clearly opportunities for substantial expansion of the 
resource.” CEO Greg Lang, January 23, 2020


“[T]here are clearly significant future opportunities for substantial 
expansion of the resource. When the time is right, we will resume 
exploration.” Greg Lang, October 2, 2019 


“While the Donlin Gold deposit is well known, there are future op-
portunities for additional drilling and expansion of the resource.” 
Greg Lang, June 27, 2019


Actually, NG’s own study showed disappointing results after the very 
limited foray beyond the main mining area, back in the 1990s. Since 2011 
they have drilled only 7,040 meters, 16 drill holes, which runs counter to 
the idea that they are interested in exploring a larger ore body.  


The pornography test
Given the enormous technical complexity of constructing the pipeline and 
the impossibility of barging enough oil to power the project, management 
likely knows that this project isn't feasible, which is why executives are 
evasive when analysts attempt to pin them down on timing for further 
development

Comments by Thomas Kaplan:


“My sense is that the moment will come in a not dissimilar way to 
the way that Justice Potter Stewart when answered the question, 
“How do you define pornography? I can’t define it, but I know it 
when I see it.” April 2, 20208


“[W]e've always said that the time to build Donlin [is] extrinsic of 
the studies that are being done and optimizations and drilling and 
the partner is all being ready to go, extrinsic of that.” April 2, 2020 


“You know that our strategy is not to make any wine before its time. 
A wise man once told me that these kinds of assets are rarer than 
hens' teeth." October 3, 2018


This would trouble us less if the story hadn't continually changed for 15 
years. In fact, construction of the Donlin mine was originally expected to 
start in 2008. Now, 12 years later, management's best guess is that con-
struction might start in 2022 and production in 2028.

A Brief History of Management Claims


To give you a better idea of the ever-changing narrative, we have produced 
a timeline of the last 15 years.


This shape shifting repeats a familiar pattern for NG. In the past decade, 
NovaGold feverishly talked up two other assets, only to spin off or sell 
them at a loss. Before the first asset, NovaCopper, was spun out, in 2012, 
management promoted it with the same vigor as it now promotes Donlin: 


”On our Ambler project [NovaCopper], this is a really exciting proj-
ect. You can see the metal count here, there are very few deposits in 
the world of this caliber.”9

“There aren't a lot of comparable really to Ambler. It's such a spec-
tacular grade for a volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit that there 
really aren't a lot of comparable to it.”10


By the end of that year, NG had spun out NovaCopper. Now trading as Tril-
ogy Metals (TMQ CN), its shares have slumped 32% since divestiture.


NG's promotional management team held out the second asset, Galore 
Creek, as the key project to finance the development of other deposits. With 
8 mln ounces of gold and 9 bln pounds of copper, Galore was sold to New-
mont (NEM US) in July 2018 for $80 mln less than NG had spent on devel-
opment; NG took a loss on the sale. The $275 mln consideration included 
$75 mln contingent on production, which is so unlikely that NG is not ac-
counting for it. Newmont quietly shut the project down on April 28, 2020.11

The Galore Creek story bears striking similarities to the problems we have 
identified at Donlin. It is a textbook case of disastrous feasibility studies 
and enormous understatement of capital required.12 In 2004, NG reported 
that capital costs would be $0.8 bln. In 2006, the estimate more than 
doubled, to $2.2 bln. In 2011, estimated costs doubled again, to $5.2 bil-
lion. The mine showed a greater than 500% increase in capital costs in just 
seven years. The same mining services company that produced the Donlin 
Feasibility Study, AMEC, completed the study of Galore Creek. 


Original Sin
Management continually and deliberately misleads investors on capital 
costs for Donlin. Read any company report, presentation, or transcript over 
the last 10 years and you will see “Total Project Cost” of $6.7 bln to build 
the mine. 


Yet the company appears to be misrepresenting cost in the above presen-
tation. The most recent feasibility study, done in 2012, estimated that the 
initial capex alone, is $8 bln, not $6.7 bln.


This extra initial capex cost was buried inside the Second Updated Fea-
sibility study (February 2012) as a single line in the projected cash flow 
statements, not defined anywhere else in the report, and called “IFRS13 
Total Capitalized Opex (Sustaining Capital).”

We believe that excluding this additional cost was a deliberate attempt to 
mislead the market, because capitalized opex was included in the capital 
costs to build the mine in the first feasibility study in 2009.15

Self-Care
NovaGold management might have the cushiest job in mining. Despite the 
limited progress (the last feasibility was produced in 2012) the CEO has 
awarded himself $8.3 mln in cash compensation over the last five years 
plus over 1.8 mln shares. Senior office holders and directors have taken $35 
mln in net cash from share sales in the last five years.


The CEO’s total compensation rivals that of the two largest mining compa-
nies in the world, BHP, with 72,000 employees, and RIO, with 47,000.

Some 70% of NG insider share sales were over the last 12 months, as the 
share price increased by 300%. The CFO’s stock in the company has halved, 
from around 2.2 mln shares to 1 mln. The CEO has reduced his net position 
by 26%. Clearly, the insiders have voted with their feet.


Promoting “optimization” and higher grades
Aware of how unattractive an investment proposition has been offered, No-
vaGold since early 2018 has been pushing mine “optimization.” Optimization 
means halving production capacity to reduce capex expenditure by 40% and 
drilling to identify higher-grade deposits to compensate for the loss of scale.

“As part of our ongoing optimization work, we've studied more selective 
mining methods as a means of enhancing the grade,” CEO Greg Lang said 
in a January 25, 2018 call.  


But management clearly knows there is no optimization to be had. Man-
agement is drilling very selectively in hopes of finding a deposit, no mat-
ter how small, with higher-than-average purity. Most recently, in 2017, the 
company drilled a mere 16 drill holes or 1.1% of the number of holes that 
had originally been used to determine the grade of the resource. Yet Nova-
Gold has been silent on the results even of this cherry-picked study. Clearly 
the grade did not improve from this drilling. After the 2017 assay, the CEO 
sold down $2.5 mln in stock. 


Nevertheless, the CEO on January 23, 2020 told analysts: ‘So we think 
there's opportunity to -- through higher grade offset some of the econo-
mies of scale we lose.” 


The $15.4 mln managers have paid themselves in cash compensation would 
have bought investors 80 exploration drill holes rather than the 16 drilled. 
It could have paid for a new feasibility study into a downsized mine capacity 
with more affordable capex. Management paid themselves instead, because 
they know no new drilling or resizing of the mine will make a difference. 


We actually expect the grade to decline by 5-7% with better modeling of 
the resource, based on estimates in the company’s feasibility study:18

18  Donlin Creek Second Updated Feasibility Study, January 2012, pp 14-16


NovaGold’s market capitalization values Donlin at over $8 bln, and the mine requires 
at least $10 bln in capital to get started. Compare that with other listed gold mines.

 ‣ Seabridge (SA US) is a comparable mine in Northwest British Co-
lumbia adjacent to Alaska. Seabridge is close to a grid connection 
powered by cheap hydropower. Seabridge has a lower capital cost and 
higher NPV than Donlin and still is not funded. Market cap is less 
than one fifth that of NG—and Seabridge owns the whole mine. 


 ‣ SolGold (SOLG LN), which owns the Cascabel mine in Ecuador, has 
higher country risk, but capital costs per unit of annual output and 
capital to NPV ratio are far better. The company also has a very low 
market cap given the better metrics and NPV. 


 ‣ Newcrest Mining (NCM AU) acquired Red Chris from Imperial Met-
als (III CN) for $804 mln for 70% of an operating mine with the 
equivalent resources of 26 mln oz of gold. That values an operating 
mine at $1.15 bln with a similar resource as Donlin and no start-up 
capital required.


NovaGold has managed to snag its valuation strictly through enthusiastic 
deception. We encourage serious investors not to take the bait.
