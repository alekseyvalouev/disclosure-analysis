BroadVision: Challenges Loom Ahead
Apr. 25, 2012 2:45 AM ET24 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Broadvision (NASDAQ:BVSN) is overvalued, and Wednesday's earnings release should
further demonstrate that. The company's shares have been inflated by the efforts of
several stock promoters who have been hyping the company's enterprise social
networking initiative, Clearvale.


But in our opinion, Clearvale remains unproven and faces substantial competition from
larger and well-funded players. Given the number of companies that have entered the
enterprise social networking competitive landscape, we think Clearvale will fall short in its
attempts to generate value for Broadvision shareholders.


As a result, we expect today's earnings release to remind investors that Broadvision is in
very much a transitory mode. Earnings per share and operating profit could very well be
negative in 2012, if recent history is any indication. The company's legacy products are in
decline and unlikely to re-enter a growth mode. In the meantime, the company's Clearvale
product did not generate material revenue in 2011 and should remain unprofitable
throughout 2012, given that Clearvale remains in a development phase where R&D and
marketing costs will likely outweigh any initial revenue. As such, we expect continued
losses at BVSN.


Legacy Businesses in Rapid Decline


First, let's discuss Broadvision as a whole. The business has been in serious decline over
the past five years, with both revenue and profit on a steep downward trajectory, as we
can see below.

Revenue has declined at a compounded annual growth rate of -19% over the past four
years. Operating profit has turned negative for the past two years, coming in at -$3.4
million in 2010 and -$4.7 million in 2011.


The company's drop in revenue has been caused by its troubled legacy products. These
legacy products include a variety of software solutions that customers can implement for
e-commerce, customer interaction and other functionalities on both intranet portals as well
as external websites. Products include Broadvision's Business Agility Suite, Commerce
Agility Suite and Quicksilver solutions, and descriptions of these products can be found
here and here.


These businesses have been suffering rapid decline and there appear to be few
expectations of a turnaround. Management makes this relatively clear in both SEC filings
and conference calls. For instance, in the company's most recent earnings call, CEO
Pehong Chen commented that "Market maturity and consolidation mean that all legacy
solutions cannot sustain a growth business." In the third quarter earnings call, Chen
elaborated:


The legacy business is a very horizontal platform business, and as we have said
many times, they are very mature and consolidated under primarily two players, IBM
and Oracle/BEA... Even though we still think we have a very good product, and all
our current customers still on our platform can attest to that, I think the trend is just
not in our favor as, again, probably is evident to many peopleâ€¦ [That] explains our
declining install base and maintenance revenue.


Clearvale: A Small Player Competing Against Well-Funded Giants


Given its declining legacy business, Broadvision has focused its turnaround efforts on its
new Clearvale product. BVSN has substantial cash on its balance sheet, and Chen has
signaled that much of this cash will be used to fund Clearvale's development. Clearvale is
an enterprise social networking ("ESN") product that is intended to enable customers to
build the next generation of interactive internal portals and external websites.


Unfortunately for Clearvale, it is competing with large competitors with deep pockets,
many of whom currently have more advanced offerings and began developing their
enterprise social networking solutions before Clearvale.

The list of industry titans devoting resources to the enterprise social networking market is
daunting. IBM launched IBM Connections several years ago, and Microsoft's
(NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint, a broad content-centric collaboration offering, is
increasingly becoming prevalent in a social enterprise context. Salesforce.com
(NYSE:CRM) has made its Chatter social networking product a central focus, and given
Salesforce.com's track record of forward-looking and innovative products, we think that
Chatter may end up being the main enterprise social networking platform for customers
who already use the Salesforce CRM platform.


Putting these tech largecaps aside, Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) is the leading
enterprise social networking platform right now, and is increasingly running away from the
competition. The company now sports a $1.5bn market cap and a blue chip customer
base. Yammer has received more than $140 million in venture capital funding to-date,
while SocialCast has been acquired and is now a subsidiary of tech giant VMWare, Inc.
(NYSE:VMW). Finally, a slew of other competitors have viable offerings, including Intel
Capital-backed Telligent, VC-funded Moxie Software, etc.


We have reviewed many of the competitor platforms, and found quite a number superior
to Clearvale. In a telling report, Forrester, a leading IT research firm, published a study
reviewing the enterprise social networking sector. Throughout the report, there was not a
single mention of Clearvale. In explaining why they excluded certain vendors in their
report, Forrester wrote:


A number of highly viable vendors were not included because their social technology
products have insufficient market presence and/or market awareness within
Forrester and its client base. This list includes such vendors as Igloo, Moxie, and
Saba.


Clearvale likely belongs under this classification, as it has apparently not won enough
clients to put it on the map for Forrester. To better understand Clearvale's limited inroads
thus far, it's instructive to compare Clearvale's customer testimonials with the customer
lists of its competitors. These customer testimonials are available on the Clearvale
website here, and provide a brief description of these companies in the table below:

Another way to examine how Clearvale stacks up to the competition is to compare
revenue between Clearvale and JIVE, the only publicly traded pure-play enterprise social
networking business. In FY 2011, JIVE generated $77m of revenue. In contrast,
"Clearvale did not generate material revenue in 2011", according to the most recent 10K.
Based on press reports on the internet, we also believe that SocialCast and Yammer are
generating at least $10m+ in revenue.


To be clear, we are not saying that Broadvision's Clearvale will be unable to transform
itself into a viable player within the enterprise social networking sector. We are, however,
arguing that thus far there is limited evidence supporting that, and the tripling of the BVSN
stock price in the past four months is not justifiable when examining the current economic
potential of Clearvale.


Clearvale has a tough road ahead of itself. It is competing in a crowded sector against
well-funded competitors, many of whom have more financial resources for R&D and
marketing expenditures than Broadvision, even after accounting for the $54 million of cash
on the company's balance sheet.


From our review of the available service offerings, we would argue that quite a number of
Clearvale's competitors have more user-friendly interfaces than Clearvale, and equally
robust functionality. In examining the various leading enterprise social networking options,
we were unable to find sufficiently differentiating factors with the Clearvale platform to
become comfortable that Clearvale would be able to catch up to its competitors in market
share.


While Broadvision management may argue that the ESN revenue opportunity is vast
enough to allow quite a number of providers to survive, Clearvale has yet to post
meaningful revenue, whereas its competitors have already posted tens of millions.
Clearvale needs to report more progress, in terms of sales, profit, customer wins and
industry acknowledgement, before we can justify the current share price.
