NanoViricides: House Of Cards With -80% Downside, 'Strong Sell'
Recommendation
Feb. 11, 2014 9:00 AM ET157 comments
by: Pump Terminator


PLEASE SEE FULL DISCLOSURE IN OUR PROFILE


Aside from sounding like the name of another terrible Keanu Reeves movie, NanoViricides
(NYSEMKT:NNVC) is the worst US reverse merger we have ever seen. NNVC is so
obviously a vehicle designed specifically to enrich insiders we find it offensively similar to
the China RTO frauds. This is the first report in a series we will release outlining the most
egregious shareholder violations we are aware of in any NYSE company. With multiple
questionable stock promoters NNVC has pumped the stock +330% while heavily diluting
shareholders and stealing NNVC out from under public investors as insiders siphoned off
millions of dollars. We also believe one of NNVC's top scientists has been dishonest which
calls into question NNVC's "technology," which we believe is clearly not viable. NNVC's
fair value is <$1 versus current trading price of $4.60 and is currently breaking down from
the large unrestricted stock selling volume created by the (yet another) recent RDO equity
sale. Our medium-term price target is $0.00 as we believe NNVC will implode once it is
unable to raise cash, like the CEO, co-founder and ex-CFO's previous defunct company,
SSUR.


Whistleblower Document: "Smoking Gun"


NNVC shareholders seem unaware of this incriminating must-read document, written by a
company insider and supporter, which outlines countless examples and allegations of
NNVC managers Seymour and Diwan abusing shareholders and looting the company.
Once NNVC insiders face subpoena power under threat of perjury, we don't see how
anything will be left for NNVC shareholders. As you read this please keep in mind: If this is
how NNVC treats a longtime supporter and associate how do you think it will treat YOU, a
faceless public shareholder?


Have NNVC Management Effectively Stolen the Company Out from Under
Shareholders?


It seems to us Anil Diwan and Eugene Seymour have stolen all potential value in NNVC
from public US shareholders. Let us explain and introduce the two main players.

NNVC's CEO Eugene Seymour on RedChip (RedChip is famous for promoting multiple
China frauds)


NNVC's president, cofounder and chairman Anil Diwan,


(also cofounder and majority owner of Theracour Pharma)


First, NNVC does not own any of the intellectual property or patents under development
by NNVC. 100% of NNVC's research, development and "technology" relies on licenses on
the IP from Theracour. As a result, NNVC is literally nothing without the "Theracour
Pharma, Inc" relationship. Unfortunately for NNVC, Theracour is also majority owned and
controlled by NNVC's President, Chairman and co-founder Anil Diwan. If the Theracour
relationship were terminated or changed for the worse, there would literally be zero
technology or IP left with NNVC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 3/45


Brammel's suit revealed the following: In 2007 and 2009 Brian Brammel (longtime
associate and supporter of Eugene Seymour) raised money from his network so NNVC
could allegedly begin early stage work on Dengue Fever, Ebola and Keratoconjunctivitis.
What Brian and his investors was not told was NNVC had never signed any licensing
agreements with Theracour for these diseases. Brian Brammel only learned this absurdity
after NNVC had spent the money and came back to him for more money to now be used
to pay Theracour for the licensing on the diseases Brian had already funded development
on! Diwan and Eugene seem to have deliberately used NNVC's cash to develop drugs for
the benefit of Diwan's Theracour to which NNVC had no rights.


NNVC then had to pay Theracour to secure these licenses. However, in a worrisome
conflict of interest, Anil Diwan seems to have controlled both sides of this transactions for
both NNVC and Theracour. As a result, Diwan and Seymour decided to create and pay
Theracour (and themselves) 7,000,000 (at the time) brand new specially crafted "Series A
Preferred Stock" (worth ~$36m today). No shareholder vote took place, nor were any
disclosures on the details of this transaction, fairness opinions or independent consultant
analysis ever provided to shareholders that we could find.


Devil in The Details: "stolen control of the company and now have absolute
dictatorial power"


The trick is these "Series A Preferred Stock" have very unusual terms only offered to
insiders which grant them "absolute dictatorial power" over NNVC, while Diwan already
controls Theracour. Originally, each A share converted into 4 shares of NNVC stock and
carried 4 votes per share but on 6/15/2012 (after the insider lawsuit first became filed)
mysteriously the Preferred shares were amended to each carry an astonishing 9 votes
each! This may not seem important until you do the math on what this means.


In effect, this means NNVC insiders granted Theracour an astonishing 63,000,000 votes
total (at the time). So all in Eugene Seymour and Anil Diwan (the only two board members
at the time) in 2012 increased their own voting control from ~30% to 54% and effectively
stole control of NNVC from shareholders.


"We want to avoid having to go to shareholders every time we need something" -
CEO Eugene Seymour discussing Brammel proxy by email


After this they required no shareholder meetings or approval of anything they do. If they
raised their cash compensation to $50m per year or sold the Theracour licenses back to
themselves for $1, there is essentially nothing shareholders could do to stop them. While

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 4/45


all the dilution has impacted this math slightly, with (what we believe is) Leo Ehrlich's likely
share ownership while Diwan, Seymour and insiders continue receiving egregious A
shares, NNVC shareholders can look forward to much more "dictatorial control" of NNVC
by Diwan and Seymour. If Leo Ehrlich did not own shares why is NNVC seemingly
keeping shareholders from inspecting the shareholder registry and trading records??


"In real terms the officers and directors have been slowly and methodically stealing
voting control of the company for their own self-dealing pursuits." -Brian Brammel
Complaint Direct Quote


So now, we believe if you own NNVC shares you quite literally own nothing. You own a
subordinated piece of paper without useful voting control that is held hostage by people
who control all the value and seem to dictate the terms NNVC shareholders (you) pay
them. With Anil and Eugene seemingly controlling the public cash raising machine and
together controlling Theracour, which receives the cash and holds all the value, they have
created the perfect vehicle to get rich. They combined a public financing vehicle that
bleeds shares into the market to unknowing public investors while Theracour and insiders
get the money. Where are NNVC's original articles of incorporation and bylaws? They are
referenced in the 10ks but we cannot find them filed with SEC as they claim anywhere.


Interestingly, we also could find no evidence Anil Diwan himself was ever elected in any
legitimate shareholder meeting…. Nor was a proper shareholder meeting called for first 7
years of company's existence and no proper shareholder meeting called to select the
current CEO either?!


"the Board has avoided calling shareholder meetings because the Board knows it
would not be able to obtain sufficient votes to approve these transactions and
intentionally chose to disregard the requirement of calling such meetings." -
Brammel Complaint Direct Quote


If Anil and Eugene did not intend to unfairly enrich themselves at the expense of NNVC
shareholders why did they create this unusual structure resulting in their complete control
of the company??


Theracour Pharma: Taking Cash from NNVC Shareholders and Giving it to Anil
Diwan


In case you were wondering the answer to the question above, read on:
5/22/2018 NanoViricides: House Of Cards With -80% Downside, 'Strong Sell' Recommendation - NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSEMKT:NNVC) | Seeking …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 5/45


"specifically Seymour (NNVC CEO) represented to Mr. Brammel that Diwan did not
want CIMS (Brian Brammel's Company) to be further involved with the company
because he felt CIMS was trying to take things away from him and that he (Diwan)
felt that CIMS's questions about the licensing agreement were meant to take
benefits he had received under the agreement away from him as they were not fair
and of market value." -Brian Brammel Complaint (emphasis added)


This sounds to us like NNVC CEO Seymour personally admitting Diwan discussed how
the Theracour agreement is not fair to NNVC shareholders and was not of market value.
So we believe either CEO Seymour lied here to Brammel, or Chairman and President
Diwan lied about the original Theracour agreement being fair and signed off by an
independent consultant. Where is this consultant's report and the detailed original
Theracour contract? Given this is the (only) important part of NNVC why has this not been
provided publicly to shareholders?


Furthermore, Theracour's terms (what we could find) seem egregious to us and not in line
with industry standards:


"(1) that TheraCour can charge its costs (direct and indirect) plus no more than 30%
of direct costs as a development fee"


Apparently, Theracour can gouge NNVC for an arbitrarily decided "30% of direct cost"
additional fee? As Diwan is 70% owner of Theracour, 70% of this money is his and how
much cash he has received is not explained in the SEC filings. Even worse: "TheraCour
may terminate the License upon a material breach by us as specified in the agreement." If
Diwan and Seymour control NNVC can't they also control if NNVC agrees to a "material
breach" and gives Theracour back the IP that NNVC shareholders paid to develop?


Is it a coincidence that now, after seizing total voting control of NNVC, Diwan suddenly
hires his own wife at NNVC paying her a very healthy salary and then Diwan goes on to
also suddenly decide, apparently without independent opinion, NNVC now needs to pay
millions of dollars in build out costs on a building Diwan owns?


NNVC's Absurd Manufacturing Facility: Giving More NNVC Shareholder Money to
Anil Diwan


In another example of NNVC Diwan and Seymour extracting shareholder cash, they
recently determined NNVC now requires their own cGMP compliant manufacturing facility.
They also decided the best way to do this would be for Anil to sell NNVC shares in the

open market when SeaSide88's conversion rate was being determined, unnecessarily
causing even more shareholder dilution. Diwan then used this money to purchase a
building in his own entity "Inno-Haven, LLC" that NNVC would then pay millions of dollars
to build out. Allegedly Diwan's personal attorney (also an NNVC shareholder) even
oversaw both sides of this transaction! Is there really not a single facility in the world that
NNVC could use that was not owned by Diwan? Where was the independent analysis
indicating this was the best choice?


Even worse, as of 1/27/2014 NNVC does not have any lease or terms signed for the
building it is paying for! NNVC is once again spending resources to develop assets owned
by Diwan before establishing the terms or costs it will incur. We sense shareholders are
about to get pillaged again.


"NNVC will be forced to comply or miss critical deadlines for its FDA submissions
and abandon its substantial investment made for Diwan's asset. Diwan will be in a
position to dictate terms and with Seymour will have dictatorial vote in the Company
to control the terms of the lease." -Brian Brammel Complaint Direct Quote


Anil Hires His Wife as CFO While Auditor and Internal Financial Controls are Failing


NNVC uses a tiny "no name" auditor repeatedly cited for numerous deficiencies including
"failure to perform sufficient audit procedures to test cash", which seems like basic audit
work to us. If NNVC's auditor is not even verifying cash then what is it verifying?


We estimate, in the first 24 quarters NNVC was in existence NNVC had to file "notification
of inability to timely file" it's SEC filings more than 19 times. Why a company with zero
revenue outsourcing virtually all its operations seems unable to get their accounting and
SEC filings in on time is baffling.


Shareholders need not worry, however! Diwan recently hired his own wife, "Meeta Vyas,"
as CFO so she can supposedly look out for shareholders and ensure the financials are
honest….


There is no excuse for a public company with more than a few million dollars to not be
using a reputable big 4 auditor. NNVC shareholders should demand this to ensure their
financial statements are reliable.


NNVC "Science" Verified by Krishna Menon: Apparently With A Record of "False
Claims"?

NNVC's "Chief Regulatory Officer", Krishna Menon


Krishna Menon (originally a veterinarian in Jamaica) is not just Chief Regulatory Office but
also principal owner and COO of "KARD Scientific" the lab that NNVC uses for their often
cited animal models and studies NNVC touts as efficacy evidence. All researchers
obviously stake their entire career on accuracy, validity, reliability and honesty yet Menon
appears to have more discrepancies than any public executive we have ever seen. Truly
incredible.


We will not repeat this hilariously embarrassing article so read this now. Ironically it is
authored by a journalist Menon originally contacted to get more blindly supportive media
attention.


- India New England Article on Krishna Menon: "Researchers many claims don't check
out."


"routine fact-checking by INDIA New England soon revealed that the story of Krishna
Menon contained many false claims and exaggerations" - India New England Article


We noticed this story was no longer on India New England's website and some claim it
was taken down because it was false. We called India New England and here is what we
were told about the article's accuracy: "All entirely true, no question. The only reason we
took it down is the editor is no longer with us and this story caused quite a stir, and we
grew tired of all the phone calls when the editor who wrote it doesn't even work here
anymore."


Amazingly we found even more examples of conflicts in what Menon has publicly said. In
his NNVC management biography he claims "a PhD in Pharmacology in 1984 from
Harvard University " and yet in the CTIX management biography (where he is President)
he claims "a PhD in Pharmacology from Kerala University ". We don't see how Menon can
be telling the truth in both statements.

It seems Menon claimed in 2005 (when NNVC came public) to be "the holder of 7 US
patents ", yet when we searched the US patent database we could find no patents of
Menon's before he made these claims? Did Menon lie about this or did NNVC fail to do
even the most basic of background checks?


Furthermore, allegedly Vivien Boniuk, MD from Feinstein's Institute who has done
"research" for NNVC is also a shareholder. Where is the truly independent analysis?
Where are the big pharma companies knocking down their door with huge cash payments
for exclusive research contracts like BIND? Is it really impossible to find an independent
lab to test your drugs that is not owned and run by a company insider?


Instead NNVC shareholders are fed a steady diet of "imminent news," promises and
promotion that never materialize into anything meaningful like this absurd 2009 press
release about agreement with unnamed "Major Pharma" that turned out to be nothing.


Eugene Seymour and Leo Ehrlich's previous company "Saliva Diagnostics" seems to have
essentially gone straight to zero and appears to have received law suits and multiple FDA
warning letters . This defunct company now trades with ticker SSUR for $0.05 per share
with $198k market cap (not a typo).


Given all of this, we find it hard to believe anything these people say is true.


NNVC Insiders Are Getting Rich


By our estimates, of the ~$36m in cash NNVC has raised (excluding the recent equity
sales, they haven't had time to spend that yet) insiders have collected ~$8m in
compensation, a full 22% of every dollar they have received. This excludes any sums
received by Theracour which would further enrich Diwan and Ehrlich received by Diwan or
Ehrlich, and any KARD compensation Menon received. For example, as 70% owner of
Theracour, Diwan is entitled to 70% of the ~$36m in "Series A Preferred Shares," or $25m
in value if converted into shares at current stock price, that he created and paid himself.

NNVC then spent another $7m on SG&A (whatever that includes for a company with
basically no operations). These two items alone are a full 42% of all the money NNVC has
raised. We estimate NNVC has only performed testing on ~5k animals which makes the
~$20m "spent" on R&D over the past 7 years also very questionable.


How have the millions of dollars of insider compensation and expenses been financed? By
heavily diluting shareholders of course


Continuously Using RDOs Leaves NNVC Vulnerable to "Death Spiral"


"I don't give a $h*t what the market price is, I just want to get this done quickly…"


- NNVC CEO, Eugene Seymour from Brammel Complaint Email Exhibit (apparently
displaying his attitude towards shareholder dilution while discussing terms of yet another
dilutive capital raise.)


Most companies sell equity to institutional investors directly when they need cash. Not
NNVC, as they rely on a special toxic type of equity financing called a "Registered Direct
Offering" or RDO. Instead of placing shares of stock with long-term supporters of the
company, RDOs instead are typically offered at enormous discounts to hedge funds who
usually dump the shares into the market as quickly as possible. For instance, NNVC's last

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 10/45


RDO sold shares at $5.25 when shares traded as high as $6.54 the previous day, and
NNVC still had to throw in ~2.6m warrants to get the deal done. Another RDO NNVC did
with "SeaSide88" was offered at a 26% discount to the previous day's price, included a
10% dividend on unconverted shares, and had warrants.


The risk in this is that NNVC becomes what we call an "inception company" because it
only exists as long as shareholders believe it exists. They NEED you, the public
shareholder, to keep buying the stock or these RDOs stop working as there is nobody to
buy the discounted stock the hedge funds can sell into the market. Once the share price
breaks down, it requires an ever increasing amount of shares and warrants at increasingly
large discount to generate the cash required, until shareholders get diluted into oblivion.
Many shady junior gold mining companies are experiencing this dynamic currently.


In just the last 3 months NNVC has been diluting shareholders and selling shares to the
market hand over fist with 2 separate deals for ~$30m in the past 5 months. NNVC's
previous RDO sold stock at $3.50 per share , which is substantially below where the stock
is now. Anil Diwan himself has also sold stock into the open market in the high $2s. If
NNVC stock stays this elevated, we expect continued RDOs to provide insiders cash.


Do you think Diwan and NNVC are selling huge amounts of stock because they think the
stock is undervalued? Do you think there could be any connection between the company
needing money and all the conferences attended and stock promoters? Now that they
have the money what do you think happens to the stock next?


NNVC Management Response: "Total Bull$hit"


We had an investor contact NNVC on the phone and, when discussing the complaint, the
company representative was obviously shaken and responded loudly "that issue is
complete Bull$hit." NNVC claims since there is not a big monetary demand that there is
nothing to worry about but we believe that clearly misses the point. Some incredible
allegations have been brought to light and if some of these are true there is very real risk
NNVC faces severe punishment from the SEC or worse. This complaint is just the
beginning and we believe once Seymour and Diwan, things are only going to get worse.
Otherwise why was NNVC in such a hurry to do two RDOs so quickly? God knows how
bad it really is inside NNVC and there could be many more lawsuits of increasing severity
that could result in the end for this company in our view. Furthermore, NNVC only survives
due to a consistent stream of shareholder money and so when public investors decide
"enough is enough" NNVC will cease to exist. Taking drugs through the required FDA
stages can easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars which NNVC does not have.

Unfortunately we did not receive articulate responses supported by facts but instead
received more useless blanket statements. We believe NNVC needs to hold an open and
public conference call with an opportunity for all investors to voice their questions and then
NNVC needs to respond in detail to all allegations with responses supported in
documented fact. Otherwise, they lose all credibility and should resign.


NNVC Valuation Completely Detached From Reality


Shareholders have recently been willing to pay $4.60 per share, based on our estimate of
56.4m shares, gives NNVC an eye popping $260m market cap for this "business." Even if
you assume NNVC's licenses from Diwan's Theracour are based on legitimate science
AND ever shown to be valuable AND you believe NNVC management will let
shareholders keep the upside (all of which we doubt) NNVC's current valuation STILL
makes zero sense:


For example, BIND therapeutics, a clinical stage nanomedicine biotech platform company
(unlike NNVC) has formal collaborations with Amgen, Pfizer and AstraZeneca for
development and a potential game changing (BIND-014) compound already in phase 2
clinical trials for lung and prostate cancer. BIND theoretically has enormous potential
payments of up to $1b in upfront and milestone payments with $450m potentially pre
commercial . BIND has received millions in upfront payments from AMGN, PFE and
AstraZeneca with these huge pharma partners also agreeing to pay for development
costs. BIND even has $80m in cash!


NNVC has none of these positives yet NNVC trades at a much higher value!! Even if you
choose to ignore all the scary NNVC red flags above (BIND appears to have none of
these) NNVC at a minimum should trade at a lower valuation than BIND, which alone
indicates more than -30% to -40% downside per share depending on the appropriate
discount. And this assumes you believe NNVC is a legitimate company with good
management looking out for your best interests.…


NNVC trades for 21.5x tangible book value and a huge premium to other obviously
superior biotech companies so we caution that as this story comes unwound there is
almost no downside support. We expect to see NNVC trade -80% or more from here, as
NNVC stock has done in the past.


We think NNVC should trade for less than cash given egregious dilution and cash burn
(biotechs often trade for less than cash for these reasons) but even applying a generous
premium to NNVC gives a per share value of less than $1 or -82% downside.
