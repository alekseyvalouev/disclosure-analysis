Blair Levinsky Short High Liner Foods: Sohn Canada

(Capitalize For Kids.)  Next up is Blair Levinsky from Waratah Capital


Advisors who pitched a short of High Liner Foods. 





Blair Levinsky's Capitalize For Kids Presentation 








-    Questions: 


o    What is the situation? 


o    Why does it exist? 


o    How is it going to change? 





-    Crowding in non-resource equities 


-    Hot IPO market, expensive food companies 


-    Short High Liner Foods (TSE:HLF) 


-    Customers such as Walmart, McDonalds for seafood 


-    Have seen growth in sales and EBITDA yet volumes have declined 13 quarters


in a row, margins have compressed. 


-    Attempting to bail themselves out of the mess through acquiring companies with


debt. 


-    Now they are overlevered and have bad businesses to run 


-    Through analysis of the cash flow statement it looks like realized incremental


EBITDA/Capex+acqusitions+NWC inv. Between 2011 and 2014 imply average


acquisition price of 13.3x multiple which is very high for industry 


-    High Liner claims to have a 30% pay out ratio but have averaged -$40MM in


FCF for the last 5 years but have been increasing the dividend payout for the large


family shareholder who likes dividends 


-    Current earnings are $71MM (without adjustments), have told the street they


will see $150MM in EBITDA in 2016, difficult to manage given lack of balance


sheet flexibility and inability to drive cost cuts
