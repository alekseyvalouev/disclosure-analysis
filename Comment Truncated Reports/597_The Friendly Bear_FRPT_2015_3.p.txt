Twinkies Vs. Freshpet: Moldgate Analysis Points To 75%+ Downside
May 14, 2015 9:03 AM ET8 comments

Summary


Freshpet has now admitted to having mold in some of its products, but management
claimed that its "fresh" food is naturally susceptible to mold.


We question whether the "fresh" product designation is applicable for Freshpet given
its average product shelf life is reported to be 140 days (7-10x longer than milk).


The company attributed mold to bags being compromised during transit and stocking
- if this is true, we wonder why the company has not pulled defective bags from retail
shelves.


We found precedents of other pet food companies issuing recalls as a result of
excess moisture in packaging leading to the potential for mold growth.


Given the confirmation and (in our view) questionable explanation of mold, we see
75%+ downside (1.5x 2015 sales, a ~25% discount to pet food comps).


During Freshpet's (NASDAQ:FRPT) 1Q15 earnings call, the company acknowledged
consumer mold complaints but dismissed the concerns, claiming that the mold found in
some of their bags is part of the normal course of business for a "fresh" food company.
Management said their mold complaint rate is low and that the rate of mold complaints
has held steady for the last two years.


The company attributed the mold complaints to bags getting "treated incorrectly"
(described as a "bump or poke or cut") during shipping and handling.


We have real questions around this "bag flaw" explanation for the mold. First, we wonder
how well management can track mold if the issue is occurring during transit. Second,
Freshpet very recently claimed that there are no mold issues in its cat foods. The bags
Freshpet uses for its cat foods appear to be similar to those it uses for its dog foods.
Therefore, it is odd that cat foods are unaffected by mold. If the issue at hand is
occasional improper handling of bags, one would think this would impact all bags,
regardless of whether the contents are dog or cat related.

However, for the purposes of this article, we will take management at face value and
assume that mold is occurring due to bags being compromised in transit (in other words,
we will ignore the comment above, and also ignore the explosion of mold complaints on
Facebook since the beginning of 2015).


We share management's view that running a national fresh food operation is highly
challenging. We also think that management's claim speaks to the fundamental structural
flaw in Freshpet's business. In our view, running a sub-scale cold chain for "fresh" food out
of one single manufacturing facility in Bethlehem, PA is simply too operationally
challenging to pull off on a national scale without running into hiccups.


Given these bags are required to make the trip from Bethlehem, PA to locations across
the country, we have to ask - is it not the responsibility of the company to utilize a bag that
is able to withstand long mileage trips from the Freshpet Kitchen to the grocery store?


So here are the key questions we think the sell side should have asked on the call:


Is it not highly likely that bags will end up getting "bumped and poked" during
the ~2,800-mile trip from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to Olympia, Washington?
Is something as benign as a "bump and poke" really causing the fabric of these
bags to become compromised?
If this is the case, could mold that is not visible to the naked eye be forming in
some of these compromised bags?


On the earnings call, CEO Richard Thompson drew an interesting analogy, in which he
remarked "we're not making Hostess Twinkies over here that last on a shelf for
years and years", implying that the manufacturer of the Twinkie has a huge "leg up"
against Freshpet in the ongoing battle against mold contamination.


So we decided to run a quick analysis comparing and contrasting Twinkies with Freshpet.

Our research on Twinkies was startling. There is a popular misconception that the
"processed ingredients" in Twinkies makes them expiration resistant. In reality, the shelf
life of Twinkies currently stands at 45 days.


So how does the "fresh" pet food sold by Freshpet stack up against the iconic Twinkie?


From a Forbes article in October 2014:


A big component of Freshpet's message to consumers is its focus on healthy
ingredients, as it doesn't use preservatives in the foods it produces. The Freshpet
items have a roughly 20-week shelf life, while most dry pet foods can sit on
shelves for years thanks to preservatives.


A twenty-week shelf life without any preservatives? That works out to 140 days. Now
THAT is truly disruptive. We cannot imagine that traditional fresh food products such as
milk can sit on shelves for almost half a year. According to this article, milk "sell-by" dates
vary state-by-state but can range from between 12 to 21 daysâ€¦ a fraction of the reported
140-day shelf life of Freshpet products.


Here is one potential idea. Based on company acknowledged incidences of mold and the
lack of artificial preservatives in Freshpet's products, perhaps the company should
consider rolling back the expiration date labels on its products? While this seems like a
rather easy potential solution to mold, it would likely annihilate the company's already
flimsy unit economics.

Summary


We are wondering why many on the sell side appear to have glossed over the mold issue
in their post-quarter notes. The sell side appears to have taken comfort in management's
claim that the mold issues impact only a very small percentage of bags. Below, we found a
few recalls related directly to mold formation in pet foods.


We wonder why Freshpet is not taking similar action in response to mold
complaints...


Iams "Potential for Mold Growth" Recall


Wellness Recall


Kong Recall (including company commentary below)


The products were not dried properly so a small percentage of finished goods have
gone moldy. Majority of the product is fine, and the mold was caught at our DC*, but
some product may have made it to PetSmart so we are recalling all the product at
PetSmart and destroying all the product we have at our DC.


We found this defense of Freshpet from a recent sell side report interesting:

Given the reported 20-week average shelf life of Freshpet products, we conclude with one
simple question:


Is any amount of mold in unexpired/unopened packages ever acceptable for any
food brand, let alone a supposedly premium pet food brand?
