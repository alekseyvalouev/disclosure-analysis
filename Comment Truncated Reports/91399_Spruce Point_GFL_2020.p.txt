Spruce Point Has Succeeded In 
Canadian Shareholder Activism


Spruce Point has written four recent critical activist reports in Canada. In a majority of the cases, the share price collapse 


has met or exceeded our downside estimate of intrinsic value. The avg. share price decline is 77%. A common theme is that 


Canadian analysts don’t ask difficult questions of management, challenge assumptions, and are overly optimistic.

Spruce Point’s Activist Success Exposing Poorly 
Executed Industrial Roll-Ups


Spruce Point has a strong track record of exposing highly promoted industrial roll-ups before investors figure out that the 


businesses had inflected negatively. Notably, Spruce Point exposed CECO Environmental and LKQ in the recycling sector.


Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Short-selling involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of infinite loss potential. Please see Full Legal Disclaimer at the front of the presentation.

(Nasdaq: CECE)


LKQ Corp

Report 2/10/15 2/13/17 1/15/14 (Prescience Point)* 12/13/18


Market Cap $3.2 billion $430 million $10.1 billion $15.1 billion


Company 
Promotion


Leader in the rigid and flexible packing 
industry. Successful ability to acquire and 


integrate numerous acquisitions to extract 
synergies, increase earnings and cash flow. 


Ability to effect a turnaround despite 
challenging end markets


Effective roll-up acquirer serving the 
environmental, energy, fluid handling and 


filtration industrial segments. Its largest 
PMFG acquisition would be a success and 


allow for rapid delivering of its balance 
sheet, and renewed growth


Best of breed recycled auto part 
distributor capable of effecting a roll-up 


strategy and producing consistent double 
digit revenue and EPS growth


Leading logistics and transportation 
company that operates as a highly 


integrated network of people, technology 
and physical assets. XPO can spend up to 
$8bn for a mega-deal to propel its share 


price to $145


Our 
Criticism


Poorly executed roll-up with limited 
disclosures about acquisition costs, and 


deal performance post-closing. Investors 
are overlooking Greif’s material weakness, 


and still buying into management’s 
aggressive Free Cash Flow definition, and 
excessive add-back adjustments to EPS. 
Dual class share structure presents poor 
governance and insiders focused on pay 


vs. performance


A poorly constructed roll-up, we argued 
CECO was forestalling a goodwill 


impairment, its cash flow would fall
significantly in 2017, and it could come 


under covenant pressure. CECO was 
misportraying its true leverage, while its 


end markets were contracting. 
We estimated downside risk of 30%-60%


An ineffective roll-up by a management 
team with a history of financial failure 


(Waste Management / Discovery Zone). 
LKQ is caught in a gross margin squeeze 
being masked by relentless acquisitions, 


and aggressive inventory accounting open 
to significant mgmt judgement. Its move to 
Europe is an implicit acknowledgement of 


waning domestic growth


XPO’s financials should be viewed 
cautiously as a result of aggressive 


accounting assumptions, from a CEO 
known for aggressive roll-up strategies. 


The Board is not best suited to oversee the 
strategy, and the stock is a Wall St. darling 
poised to disappoint as its fragile financial 


condition becomes evident


Successful 
Outcome


The CEO was ousted shortly after our 
report. Greif continued to miss Wall Street 
sales and earnings estimates, and failed to 


turnaround its business as promised. 
Further, Greif curtailed additional M&A for 


four years post our report 


CECO took a goodwill charge in Q4’16 as 
predicted, and changed its presentation of 


its financial leverage in its investors 
presentation - implicitly acknowledging 


our criticism. Q2’17 results were 
significantly below expectations, it 


admitted continuing challenges in its end 
markets, and its YTD operating cash flow 


has evaporated. CECO’s shares were 
downgraded, and shares fell >40%  


Gross margins have declined from over 
47% to 39%. The Company’s successive 
acquisition in Europe and domestically 


have failed to boost its share price. LKQ’s 
multiples have contracted significantly. Its 
CFO was replaced (Feb 2015) and its CEO 


recently stepped down (March 2017)


XPO cut its guidance and missed financial 
targets. Its COO was terminated after XPO 
lost a substantial customer, believed to be 


Amazon. XPO’s mega-deal never 
happened, and instead it tempered its 
growth strategy by turning to levered 
share repurchases. XPO talked about 
restarting acquisitions, but instead is 


saying it could dismantle the Company. 
XPO terminates strategic review

Spruce Point Has A Track Record Identifying Capex 
Accounting Anomalies As Leading Indicators of 
Underlying Problems


GFL’s capex accounting irregularities should not be taken lightly by investors. Spruce Point has a strong record of success 


unearthing previously-unidentified financial strain among companies reporting irregular or inconsistent capex figures. Included in 


these are some of our most successful short campaigns.


Report NASDAQ: CSTE | Aug 2015 / Oct 2015 NYSE: AOS | May 2019 and Twitter NYSE: USC | May 2018


Ent. Value $1.7 billion $7.8 billion $1.7 billion


Company 
Promotion / 


Situation 
Overview


Leading quartz countertop manufacturer capable of 
producing sustainable 43% and 26% gross and EBITDA 
margins, while producing double digit growth in the 
fast growing U.S. market. The Company claimed it 


needed to increase capex to construct a manufacturing 
facility in the U.S. to accelerate its North American 


expansion


Leading maker of water heaters and treatment 
products, boilers, and air purifiers. Fast and 


sustainable growth in China, allowing for corporate 
gross margins in excess of industry peers.


Highly accretive and synergistic North American 
roll-up of ready-mix concrete operations capable 


of expanding margins and growing earnings


Our Criticism Our intense fundamental and forensic due diligence 
uncovered evidence of slowing U.S. growth, and 


margin pressure being covered-up. We also expressed 
grave concerns about the Company’s strategy to 


build a U.S. manufacturing facility and believed its 
capex costs seemed overstated, which would allow 


capitalization of costs on the balance sheet and
potentially overstate earnings. Our background work 


into CEO Yos Shiran also revealed a pattern of 
mismanagement at Tefron, an Israeli textile company, 


that promoted a unique technology but failed


Our intensive due diligence revealed a number of 
capital expenditure anomalies, notably consistent 
mis-forecasting. These capex issues appeared to 


point to gross margin inflation via expense 
capitalization. Shifting revenue recognition standards


pointed to the possibility of aggressive booking of 
sales. Excessive spending on a protracted ERP
implementation also appeared to be linked to


accounting and financial issues


Becoming more aggressive in acquisitions to grow 
and providing limited deal transparency. GAAP vs. 
Non-GAAP strain intensifying. Leverage rising to 


pre-bankruptcy levels. CEO has hidden from 
disclosure a DWI arrest for reckless driving. 
Aggressive use of capital leases to embellish 


EBITDA. Management's history of meeting Capex 
guidance is horrendous. PP&E accounts suggest 
overcapitalization of costs with vehicle accounts 


up 500% yet physical trucks up 100%


Successful 
Outcome


Two CEO/CEO’s and two CFO/CFO’s of Caesarstone 
subsequently resigned. The Company later reported 
numerous manufacturing problems in both its new 
U.S. production and Israeli facilities. Gross margins 
contracted to 25%. The share price has fallen ~80% 


from our initiation price


Following a report from J Capital, AOS admitted that it 
had been engaging an undisclosed material supply 


chain partner in China, confirming suspicions of 
channel-stuffing. In Q2 2018, not long after we 
published our report, AOS substantially revised 
guidance, showing weakness in China with sales 


projected down 16-17%. AOS fired the President of 
A.O. Smith China in Feb 2020 following our report


Following our report, USCR continued to miss 
analyst expectations numerous times. In April 
2019, a regional executive resigned and in Feb 
2020, USCR announced its CEO would “retire”. 


Shares declined by approximately 55% following 
our report

Spruce Point Estimates 100% Downside Risk To 
GFL Environmental’s Share Price


After conducting a forensic financial and accounting review (inc. multiple former employees interviews), Spruce Point believes shares of GFL Environmental (TSX/NYSE: 


GFL), a cash degenerative North American roll-up of environmental service companies, are worthless. We find GFL’s CEO Patrick Dovigi has obfuscated connections to 


what some observers have dubbed “organized crime” – if true, making the stock uninvestable to institutional shareholders and putting its two deals to acquire Waste 


Management assets and WCA Waste at risk of not receiving Dept. of Justice approval in our opinion. GFL’s executive Joy Grahek fails to disclose her role advising Philip 


Services (NYSE/TSX: PVH), a dual-listed roll-up of metal and industrial services that collapsed, was pursued by the OSC regulators, settled $80m of shareholder claims, and 


was described as “one of the great unprosecuted frauds in Canadian business history”.  In our opinion, GFL’s leverage is understated by aggressive reporting of revenue 


and EBITDA, and free cash flow burn is understated by ~60%; this is evidenced by financial restatements without explanation, and by minimizing a material weaknesses of 


financial controls. We believe GFL’s debt is understated by at least C$460m. We believe its staggering C$5.6bn total debt load, and financial losses make it reliant on new 


capital to sustain itself, nevermind its desire to grow via increasingly expensive acquisitions. With a meaningful portion of the stock pledged as collateral for loans, we 


believe there is a real risk that the stock collapses and the auditor fails to sign off on GFL’s financials after reviewing the evidence we’ve amassed.

Leverage Also 


Understated


GFL’s CEO Patrick Dovigi has scrubbed his biography in SEC and SEDAR filings connecting him to multiple individuals that have had regulatory 


infractions, legal challenges, and allegations of securities fraud in the U.S. Notably, Dovigi was a Director of NGTV, a company whose financials 


were overseen by an individual associated with Simon Marketing, the Company involved in the mob-linked McDonald’s Monopoly scandal. In 


addition, NGTV involved Andy DeFrancesco (tied to Aphria and Fareport Capital scandals), Romeo DiBattista Jr (tied to Fareport Capital), Frank 


Mersch (settled with the Canadian securities regulators for misleading statements) and Hunter World Markets (SEC charged with stock 


manipulation). In addition, Dovigi has been associated with Rob Ford, and his brother Doug Ford, influential Canadian politicians that the local 


media has suggested are connected to organized crime, and patronage controversies. GFL also obscures the role of Paul (Paolo) Borrelli, a 


former executive and current employee, who is connected on social media to Antonio Borrelli. Antonio went to prison for attempted murder that 


paralyzed an innocent bystander. Peter Scarcella, who police say “is one of Toronto’s top mob figures”, is Antonio’s uncle.


GFL’s first IPO prospectus discussed a material weakness of financial controls, a troubling fact for a Company founded 12+ years ago. GFL 


removed the material weakness statement before its IPO suggesting it was remediated. Yet, Spruce Point finds evidence that GFL has restated 


both revenue and EBITDA, without explanation, by pulling from “intercompany” revenues. This maneuver, which flatters its U.S. EBITDA 


margin, a key part of the growth story, is suspicious. When we spoke with a former employee about GFL’s practices, we heard an opinion that 


GFL was particularly aggressive, and didn’t have the right operational structure in place to succeed. The SEC questioned GFL’s use of “Run 


Rate EBITDA”, and based on the fine language in the prospectus, we believe it provides GFL significant discretion to inflate EBITDA. We 


believe GFL presents a potentially misleading view of its “Total Gross Debt” which ignores capital leases, loans to CEO Dovigi, and the debt 


portion of the Tangible Equity Units (“TEU”) issued in March 2020. In total, we believe GFL understates debt by at least C$460m, and potentially 


more if post-closure landfill liabilities aren’t accurately modeled. We estimate current Net Debt/EBITDA is 4.7x (5.2x pro forma for WM/WCA). 


GFL carries a deep junk credit rating of B+/B1 with S&P and Moody’s. In Q2 2020, GFL made an accounting maneuver that inflated its 


operating cash flow by 2x, understated capex by 19% and H1 2020 free cash flow burn was ~60% more than reported. Our analysis shows GFL 


is struggling more than investors believe, which may explain why it rushed an expensive deal to buy WCA Waste despite not closing on WM.


Another Poorly 


Organized and 


Opaque Canadian 


Roll-Up That We 


Expect Will Fail To 


Meet Lofty Goals. 


Multiple Examples of 


Questionable Deals


We believe GFL is an aggressive roll-up, having acquired 143 companies since 2007, that overpays for assets and failed three times to IPO. In 


one case, GFL bought a company that itself acquired 60 companies, making GFL a roll-up of roll-ups. We believe GFL is simply a financial 


motivated investment scheme that failed multiple times to IPO, and has parallels to Philip Services Corp, a scandalous U.S./Canadian roll-up 


that went bankrupt. We find examples of GFL touting deals, but through poor post-acquisition execution, have operational or financial challenges. 


In an extreme case, GFL bought Rizzo Environmental before U.S. authorities indicted its founder for fraud. We also have concerns about the 


financial guidance issued in the recent Waste Management deal. We heard from an industry observer familiar with GFL’s Canadian business that 


50% of its deals are estimated to have under-performed post acquisition. GFL gives limited deal terms and post-acquisition performance, leaving 


investors to “trust” it when talking about its ability to drive organic growth and margin expansion. Our analysis shows no evidence of operating 


leverage: GFL has grown sales at the same rate as its two largest operating expenses, employee wages and hauling fees per employee.

Delisting Risk Is High


CEO Dovigi has increased loans to GFL recently, which caused us to investigate his related party dealings. We find evidence 


that through his real estate holding company PJD Properties, he leases office space to GFL, and this fact was not properly 


disclosed to investors. In addition, we find that GFL leases a mansion in British Columbia from an employee that was acquired


in an acquisition. We also heard from sources to “follow GFL’s green trucks” for clues as to where GFL might be spending in 


ways adverse to shareholders. This led us to Interior Motives Custom Upholstery where we found that GFL has commissioned 


fancy interior design work for its vehicles. These vanity projects add costs to shareholders with no addition to profits. In addition, 


we are concerned by GFL sending truck and heavy equipment refurbishment work to Campus Auto Collision, where Mr. 


Dovigi’s partner at Earthworx landed after pleading guilty to soil contamination, while charges were dropped against GFL. 


Campus Auto associates itself with individuals that appear to have had past legal issues. 


Spruce Point believes the current slate of “Independent” Directors are suspect. Mr. Nayar fails to include on his biography that


he has received fees from BC Partners as an advisor, GFL’s largest control shareholder. Also, board member Mr. Guindi’s law 


firm received fees from BC Partners and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. GFL does not compensate its directors with cash, 


they own no stock, and have an immaterial number of legacy options. More importantly, in our opinion, none of the current 


Independent Directors have any full-time operational experience in the waste management or environmentally sensitive 


industries critical to overseeing GFL’s business. As a result, we believe the Board is ill-equipped to best serve new shareholders 


and ensure that GFL is operating in compliance with stringent rules and regulations – a challenge for GFL historically.

In Our View


Evidence of Undisclosed 


Related-Party 


Transactions With The 


CEO And Spending With 


“Friends” That Could Be 


Adverse To 


Shareholders’ Interest


Dovigi and others have used margin loans tied to the value of GFL’s stock. Best corporate governance practices generally 


dictate that executives and directors not pledge stock. This presents undue risks to investors should the stock come under 


pressure, and forced selling be required. GFL’s IPO lock-up expires in late August 2020, giving insiders the ability to cash out, 


and repay the margin loan with stock sales. 


Based on our research and conversations with former GFL employees, we believe it will be unlikely that GFL stems its cash 


burn and turns a profit any time soon while it continues its torrid acquisition pace. Yet, stock promoters take GFL’s word that it is 


growing organically (with little data to verify), can continue to acquire (yet overpay for acquisitions), and improve margins


(despite evidence of wasteful spending and operational mishaps). Collectively, analysts see 17% upside to GFL’s share price, 


and argue it’s stock is cheap to peers, yet ignore GFL’s financial control issues of unexplained revenue restatements, 


aggressive accounting that inflated recent cash flow by 2x, and understated debt burdens. We believe GFL is more expensive 


that it appears: its enterprise is not correctly modeled for the impact of TEUs, and its market cap to intangible assets and 


goodwill is industry leading at 98%. We believe GFL is uninvestable to institutions given these financial control issues, and the 


CEO’s documented relationships with many controversial parties. We believe GFL’s audit committee needs to engage an 


independent expert to review any related-party dealings between GFL and its CEO, along with dealings among his associates. 


Given that GFL is dependent on capital to sustain itself and grow, we believe the stock could be worthless absent new funding.


CEO Lives A Large Life 


With A Side Hobby That 


Could Distract Him From 


Running GFL In Our View


CEO Dovigi is not shy about flaunting the wealth created from building GFL via aggressive acquisitions. He claims to buy a new 


car every 6 months, and the Company provides him a generous annual auto stipend and use of a Company jet. In addition, he 


has multiple vanity homes all across North America, and a super yacht we believe is named Lady Jorgia. CEO Dovigi is also 


known to develop properties as a side-venture, but these property development activities have in the past created lawsuits and 


community push back, notably in Muskoka. He also does not disclose his role at PJD Properties on his SEC-filed biography. 


Spruce Point believes shareholders would be better served if CEO Dovigi focused all his attention and effort on GFL.

GFL’s Growth Story Is Largely Over


Spruce Point believes the largest pillars of the GFL “growth” story via acquisitions are now over. This is mirrored by the recent 


comment below by the CEO during last week’s WCA deal announcement call. We believe investors are now left with two 


very big risks: 1) Will GFL receive regulatory approvals for each transactions, and 2) Will GFL will make due on its promises 


to properly integrated recent acquisitions? Between announced (C$2.8bn) and closed acquisitions (C$1.1bn), GFL has spent 


C$3.9bn on YTD 2020 acquisitions, putting significant organizational strain on a Company, that in our view, has historically 


failed in its M&A deals and not exhibited any operating leverage


Spruce Point 


Warning


“So I just wanted to highlight that to refresh everyone’s sort of memories on what we said, what we have done, 
and sort of what we’re focused on sort of moving forward. But I think post WCA, there’s not another larger 
scale opportunity that’s in our horizon at the moment, and we’re just going to focus on getting these integrated 
properly and then focusing on tucking-in smaller M&A deals like what we’ve talked about acquiring sort of 25 
to 30 deals a year of sort of $1 to $10m of EBITDA.”

Deals


We Believe Current GFL Investors Are Left “Betting” On The Uncertain Outcome Of These Three Things, 


Yet Most Sell-Side Analysts Have Already Given GFL Credit For Successful Completion


This deal requires Dept of Justice (DOJ) approval. There is already evidence that deal terms have changed, yet 


GFL did not disclose this to investors. Why not? Furthermore, GFL recently added new “forward looking” statement 


language signaling risks of DOJ approval. Lastly, how will the DOJ view the varied controversial business 


connections that GFL has?


Before even closing WM/ADS, we believe GFL has further complicated its situation, by now requiring two regulatory 


approvals. The financing of the deal is not entirely certain. GFL is indicating it needs to raise $500 - $750m of debt. 


Moody’s says WCA is free cash flow constrained and that its capex margin is 15%; GFL shows 10.5%. Who to trust?


Based on our extensive research, we believe GFL’s CEO likes to spend lavishly, and in ways that may not be 


beneficial to investors. Our research shows that GFL has often made poor acquisitions, with extreme lapses in due 


diligence (eg. Rizzo) and by neglecting customer service and infuriating customers (eg. Bestway). By our analysis, 


GFL has extracted no operating leverage in key operating costs up to this point, so we are skeptical that GFL has an 


adequate plan to change its historical practices

Insights From A Call With A Former 
GFL Employee


“You’ll never find them, and you don’t want anything to do with them...”
Former 


GFL 


Employee


“Would you describe them as highly ethical good people, should we do more investigation?”
Spruce 


Point


“Why did you leave GFL?”Spruce 
Point


“I felt the Company had to go in a different direction and it wasn’t going there. I also had ethical concerns and had no interest in 
continuing with the Company.” 


Former 


GFL 


Employee


“Can you talk about the history, who were the initial backers, whose idea was the operation, and how did it evolve? Seems like 
the initial equity backers have moved on at this point.”


Spruce 


Point


“I have to say this very gently….a number of owners have come and gone and moved on. There’s certainly a group still behind 
the scenes pulling the strings at this Company and I’m not prepared to say any more about that.”

GFL 


Employee

CEO Dovigi’s Associations Should Give Investors 
Cause For Serious Concern


Through either one or two degrees of separation, GFL’s CEO has been closely associated with people that have been involved 


with various business scandals, some of which have involved charges (and convictions) for fraud and imprisonment.

Why Does GFL’s Former General Counsel Omit Her 
Role Advising “One of the Great Unprosecuted 
Frauds of Canadian Business History”?


GFL’s former General Counsel, and now SVP of Strategic Initiatives, omits from her biography that she was legal counsel to Philip 


Services Corp. (NYSE/TSX: PHV), a dual-listed industrial metals and services roll-up that collapsed and went to zero. The Ontario 


Securities Commission brought allegations against the executives for failure to provide full, true and plain disclosures of material 


facts, and Philip’s auditor Deloitte (GFL’s auditor), executives and underwriters settled shareholder lawsuits for $79.7m.(1,2 ) Philip 


Services was described as a “house of cards” with “grossly inflated revenue” and “one of the great unprosecuted frauds of Canadian 


business history” by a Canadian lawyer.(3) Mrs. Grahek appears to have been particularly close with the top executives of Philip 


Services: she was named in a lawsuit with them and the executives invested in her next business venture.

Ms. Grahek was also named in a lawsuit with the

Hamilton businessman Bob Waxman has been sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing almost $18 million US from Philip Services Corp. 
“But the tough sentence doesn't mean the end of the 14-year saga that contributed to the spectacular collapse of Philip Services Corp., and sent fraud investigators around the world trying 


to trace stolen money. An appeal is already filed. Waxman spent the afternoon in a holding cell at Hamilton's courthouse but was released on bail pending that appeal…
Waxman was found guilty of six charges of fraud and theft relating to trades on copper he orchestrated in 1996 and 1997 as president of the metals recovery group at Philip Services.


In the mid and late 1990s, Philip was in the midst of an aggressive growth-by-acquisition spree and was constantly short of cash to finance its day-to-day operations. In that environment 
Waxman hatched a scheme to raise ready cash. The plan, which he has always held was carried out with the full knowledge of the board of directors, involved buying copper on delayed 


payment terms from a supplier and then immediately selling it for cash.”

What Happened To Executive Paul Borrelli Prior 
To GFL Registering To Going Public?


Per a BC Securities Commission filing we see that Paul Borrelli was a named executive officer of GFL as of April 2019 during a debt capital raise 


led by Barclays Capital. Oddly, Mr. Borrelli did not appear on the Company’s website, unlike the other officers, in April 2019 using the 


waybackmachine. Mr. Borrelli ceased to be an officer as of July 2019 and was not named in GFL’s F-1 Registration Statement when it was 


preparing to IPO. Mr. Borrelli has no public work biography, and does not maintain a LinkedIn account. His photo can be seen in 2014 accepting an 


award for GFL. His wife has a public Facebook profile and his photo appears next to her. We see that a Mr. Antonio Borrelli indicates that he 


knows Paul. His photo appears similar to a Mr. Antonio Borrelli who was sentenced to prison for a murder plot that injured an innocent bystander 


in 2004, and back to jail for “continuing to meet with mobsters”. The Globe and Mail says that Antonio Borrelli’s uncle is Pater Scarcella, 


“one of Toronto’s top mob figures” according to the police.

CEO Dovigi’s Associations Should Give Investors 
Cause For Serious Concern (Cont’d)


GFL uses Campus Auto Collusion for its vehicle and equipment refurbishment. This reconnects CEO Dovigi with Claudio Villa, who plead guilty at 


Earthworx (a former GFL partner) in 2015 for dumping toxic dirt, while charges against GFL were dropped. Per Campus’ Instagram, Mr. Villa 


maintains relationships with individuals described as cousins. These individuals have names and images similar to those with past legal issues.

Soil broker Earthworx convicted of dumping toxic dirt at 
sheep farm - March 2015


“In a Star story last fall, GFL president and CEO Patrick Dovigi 
said his company chose to be a good corporate citizen by 
cleaning up the mess left on farmer Ruco Braat's land, in the 
hamlet of Bailieboro. Dovigi also said GFL took just 192 
truckloads to the farm and suggested that another soil 
company brought the dirty soil to Braat's land. After pleading 
guilty last week, Earthworx and its director, Claudio Villa, 
were fined $84,500 (plus a 25 per cent victim surcharge) for 
offences related to the deposit of soil contaminated with metals 
and organic compounds on the sheep farm.” Source

Dovigi And Ford Connection


CEO Dovigi has a relationship with Campus Auto Collison, which by public photographs, services GFL’s fleet 


refurbishment. Campus Collision is also friendly with Doug Ford (as seen in the photo below), who the Globe and Mail 


said has a history with drug dealing.(1) Dovigi and Ford are in a small circle, centered around Campus Auto Collison.

Earthworx also connects GFL, Mr. Dovigi and Director Dino Chiesa, to Gordon Churchill of Port Perry. Mr Churchill, in 


addition to Mr. Villa, were both referenced as directors/owners of Earthworx. Gordon pleaded guilty in June 2007 to 


charges of production of a controlled substance, unauthorized possession of a firearm and misconduct by peace officer. 


Gordon’s son Nick Churchill follows Villa’s Campus Auto on Instagram. Nick Churchill was also sentenced to prison.

Should Banks’ Reputational Risk Committees 
Reassure Investors?


But don’t worry, the underwriters who have promoted GFL’s stock to investors have “reputational risk” committees 


which vet clients. In the case of Goldman Sachs, did that stop them from funding 1MDB and Jho Low? 


And Did J.P. Morgan’s risk committee weigh in on dealing with sex offender Jeffery Epstein?

Hot Potato Economics: Fourth Time Is A Charm 
To Sell Garbage To Public Investors


GFL has been flipped around like a hot potato pancake among multiple owners, gone through five CFOs and on 


its fourth try, came public. Spruce Point believes GFL was in such need for new equity capital, that it finally 


IPO’ed in March 2020, one of the worst months, and least advantageous times to raise capital, ever for equities.

Insights From Calls With Former 
GFL Employees: Will GFL Make Money?


“There are two parts, U.S. and Canada. Canada is quite saturated and prices are competitive. Chances of making big profits 
in solid waste, are not going to happen. GFL’s main money maker is the infrastructure business. I am less familiar with the 
U.S. side of the business. It’s tough to say if GFL will make money in the next year or two.” 


Former GFL 


Employee 2


“Will GFL ever make money from a high level. They talk about opportunities to expand margins, and acquire. Based on your 
experience, will they achieve these objectives in the long-run?”


Spruce Point


“Do you have confidence GFL can make money?”Spruce 
Point


“Under the current management structure and people, no. I would never put a dime in there. If you could see a mature 
management in the industry, absolutely, there’s an opportunity….I have no confidence at this point and time.”


Former 


GFL 


Employee 1


“Does GFL have a path to profitability?”Spruce Point


Former 


Employee 3


“That’s the wildcard in the GFL story, that’s the gamble. Acquisitions play a key part to keep the momentum going. 
What happens when acquisitions stop? You need profitability. Can they turn around? Today they are not making money. 
That’s a fact. I don’t know if they can. They’ve acquired so rapidly.”

Free Cash Flow ($170.6) ($203.9) ($138.0) ($220.2) -59.5%


We have shown that both GFL’s operating cash flow and capital expenditures do not reconcile. 


As a result, we believe its free cash flow is also misstated. We believe true H1 2020 free cash flow burn was ~60% 


worse than reported by GFL. 


“When you think about how cash flow and leverage should play out over the balance of the year, we 
should incur an additional $140 million to $150 million of CAPEX and approximately $140 million, $145 


million of cash interest costs in the second half of the year. If you layer on the conservative assumption of 
working capital, ending the year as cash flow neutral, you get to a free cash flow number of somewhere 
between $275 million and $300 million for the back half of the year, depending on your views of where 


we end up in terms of EBITDA.”

Note: Spruce Point Adjusted capex uses the “additions” from the PP&E footnotes

has barely increased while FCF has worsened. Granted there is a COVID-


19 impact in H1 2020, but with so much money spent on acquisitions, 


Spruce Point is surprised there is no FCF growth.

Biography And Has Connections To 
Many Controversial People
25


The Waste Management Industry


Right or wrong, the waste management business has often been associated with organized crime and illegal 


activity, a fact that GFL’s CEO acknowledges and downplays. In fact, 18 years ago one of the largest corporate 


accounting frauds in U.S. history was perpetuated by Waste Management, a company audited by defunct 


auditor Arthur Andersen. GFL’s audit engagement partner, Stephen Dominic DiGiacomo, started his career as a 


Staff Accountant at Arthur Andersen from 1999-2002. (1,2)


“I’m in the waste management 
business. Everyone assumes your

3) “One Man’s Trash, How Patrick Dovigi Built GFL Into A Waste Empire”, Globe & Mail, Sept 2019


Dovigi has heard the rumours. “People like to think it’s like an episode of The Sopranos. Given my last name, there’s been some 
suspicion,” he told an interviewer in 2012. Tony Soprano, America’s favourite garbageman mobster, had only been off the air a few 
years when Dovigi splashed onto the scene in Toronto. Reflecting on the talk now, he laughs. “People would always say, ‘Who is this 
kid? How’s he doing this? It must be the Mafia that’s involved,’” says Dovigi, whose stocky six-foot frame and dark hair would 
certainly get him an audition for the part. “The things people were saying were just insane. It was funny. It’s all just noise.”

A New Face Emerges In The Waste 
Management Industry….


Despite the waste management industry being mature, and intensely competitive, there is a story of a rags to riches empire being


built by Canadian Patrick Dovigi, founder of Green For Life (GFL). With the support of Canadian backers and banks, GFL has rolled-


up over 143 companies since 2007. GFL’s big break came in 2011 when it won a lucrative 7yr contract from the City of Toronto 


during controversial Mayor Rob Ford’s tenure. Given the low bid submitted by GFL, some observers cried foul play.(1) During our 


research, we learned GFL turned to the U.S. as growth and competition limitations and constraints in certain Canada end markets 


like solid waste are being reached. Through a Nov 2018 merger with Waste Industries in the U.S., GFL became the 4th largest 


environmental services company in North America. In our opinion, Dovigi’s success from aspiring NHL goalie to garbage magnate 


is a carefully curated narrative. However, based on our detailed investigative background check, forensic review of GFL’s 


financials, and discussions with former employees knowledgeable about GFL, we believe investors should exercise extreme 


caution, have skepticism about GFL’s financials, and question the “bull case” narrative being spun by stock promoters that it will 


become a profitable enterprise.

“Would you describe them as highly ethical good people, should we do more investigation?”

“I felt the Company had to go in a different direction and it wasn’t going there. I also had ethical concerns and had no interest in 
continuing with the Company.” 


Former 


GFL 


Employee


“Can you talk about the history, who were the initial backers, whose idea was the operation, and how did it evolve? Seems like 
the initial equity backers have moved on at this point.”


Spruce 


Point


“I have to say this very gently….a number of owners have come and gone and moved on. There’s certainly a group still behind 
the scenes pulling the strings at this Company and I’m not prepared to say any more about that.”

Why Does GFL’s CEO Make Omissions In His 
SEC And SEDAR-Filed Biographies? 


Dovigi’s current biography was modified to omit his ties to Lower East Capital Partners (Andy DeFrancesco / Romeo 


DiBattista / Frank Mersch), which would have linked him to NGTV and other parties. His biographies also omits his role 


as VP, Brovi Investments (Romeo DiBattista), Right Lease, and PJD Properties – a currently active entity that Mr. Dovigi 


appears to use to develop and sell properties (eg. Recently a St. Regis condo in Florida). In the next slide, we highlight 


why investors might care about Dovigi’s association with these businesses and people.

Alleged Connection To “Organized Crime”…..


Prior to GFL, Dovigi worked for Romeo DiBattista at Waste Excellence Corporation "WEC".(1.2) WEC emerged from 310 


Waste, a company charged with numerous environmental issues with three men sent to jail.


From a blog on the internet claiming to be a deposition in the trial of 310 Waste, a deponent referred to Pat Dovigi, Andy 


DeFrancesco and Romeo DiBattista as “part of organized crime”.(3)

CEO Dovigi’s Associations Should Give Investors 
Cause For Serious Concern (Cont’d)


GFL uses Campus Auto Collusion for its vehicle and equipment refurbishment. This reconnects CEO Dovigi with Claudio Villa, who plead 


guilty at Earthworx in 2015 for dumping toxic dirt, while charges against GFL were dropped. Per Campus’ Instagram, Mr. Villa maintains 


relationships with individuals described as cousins. These individuals have names and images similar to those with past legal issues.

“In a Star story last fall, GFL president and CEO Patrick Dovigi 
said his company chose to be a good corporate citizen by 
cleaning up the mess left on farmer Ruco Braat's land, in the 
hamlet of Bailieboro. Dovigi also said GFL took just 192 
truckloads to the farm and suggested that another soil 
company brought the dirty soil to Braat's land. After pleading 
guilty last week, Earthworx and its director, Claudio Villa, 
were fined $84,500 (plus a 25 per cent victim surcharge) for 
offences related to the deposit of soil contaminated with metals 
and organic compounds on the sheep farm.” Source

Lots of Question Marks Around GFL And Its CEO 
According To The Local Press


City staff had anticipated a $6-million savings by carrying out Mayor Rob Ford's controversial plan to privatize garbage collection; 
GFL is offering closer to $11-million in annual savings. But opponents of Mayor Rob Ford's plan to contract out garbage 
questioned whether the company's bargain bid -- GFL undercut the next lowest bidder by $3.5-million -- is too good to be true.


"Right now I can't believe that this bid is true and I haven't received either from the independent financial review or city staff enough 
reassurance that I should trust this number,“ said Councillor Gord Perks, who sits on the public works committee. Mr. Perks said he 
fears the company's bid is too low to be sustainable and will require residents to either fork over more cash in coming years or have 
no waste collection services should operations fail.


"If they can't deliver on price, we are going to find ourselves two or three years from now with them holding a gun to our heads
because we will have laid off our staff, sold our trucks and will be completely dependent on them," he said. "I have particular 
concerns with this contract because it is so far off the mark that the rest of the marketplace has set.“


Councillors in Kawartha Lakes recently rejected a contract renewal with GFL, despite the company submitting the lowest bid. City
staff argued that its bid was "misleading" and decided to give the contract to Miller Waste Systems, according to reports.

“But in April, 2007, his mentor, Romeo DiBattista Sr., informed him that his services were no longer needed. The DiBattista family, 
which had stakes in businesses as diverse as concrete-forming, meat processing, real estate and broadcasting, also sued Dovigi for 
allegedly misappropriating $673,000 in funds.”

Spruce Point Does Not Suggest Investing In 
“Larger Than Life” CEOs


Based on our research and opinion, we believe CEO Dovigi lives a large lifestyle, supported by generous company perks such 


as a car allowance and private use of jet. We have identified multiple marquee properties owned by Dovigi. He is known to 


have a side hobby of developing properties, which has engendered complaints and lawsuits.(1) Spruce Point does not 


believe investors should accept its CEO being distracted with real estate ventures on the side.

“Larger Than Life” CEOs (Cont’d)


Shareholders are picking up the tab for CEO Dovigi to purchase a new car annually and personal use of the 


Company jet. As a CEO who is reportedly a billionaire, it begs the question why can’t he afford this on his own 


without burdening GFL, a chronically cash consumptive enterprise, with these additional costs.

Why Is GFL Leasing A Mansion From 
A Current Employee?


Given the multitude of lavish properties that CEO Dovigi owns, we find it unusual that GFL leases a mansion from Daryl 


Goodwin, a current employee and seller of Enviro-Smart Organics to GFL. We believe this should be considered a 


related-party transaction. We believe this is an excessive perquisite for an employee, even if a portion of the land is 


being used for business purposes.(1)   Does CEO Dovigi use this property as well when in BC?

Obscured Organic Growth And Inability To 
Gauge GFL’s Economic Roll-Up Value Creation


Spruce Point has consistently argued that roll-up investments should be evaluated on the merits of their ability to produce 


organic revenue growth, and by extension, organic earnings and cash flow. We observe that GFL, having completed over 143 


acquisitions, does not give investors adequate disclosures or insight into organic growth. The crux of the issue is that GFL 


does not announce, or disclose, the names of many of its acquisitions. For acquisitions that are disclosed, it infrequently 


provides acquisition deal size or financial contributions of targets. 


GFL’s disclosures make it impossible for investors to evaluate its ability to create value.

“Our ability to continue to grow our business and generate improvements in our financial performance depend on our ability to continue to 
expand our environmental services platform by leveraging our diversified business model to broaden our geographic reach and scalable 
capabilities. Our success in achieving this growth and improvements is dependent on our ability to execute on our three-pronged strategy 
of: (i) continuing to generate strong, stable organic revenue growth; (ii) successfully executing strategic, accretive acquisitions; and (iii) 
continuing to drive operating cost efficiencies across our platform.”

1) The Q1 2020 and Q2 2020 disclosure provided was irrelevant to determining the current quarter impact, citing revenues since April 1, 2019: Q1 Example: “Revenue from 


acquisitions completed since April 1, 2019 accounted for approximately $180.2 million of the increase, the majority of which was in our Solid Waste business”

Inability To Reconcile GFL’s Acquisition Claims


Former GFL CFO Shawn Parnham started in Dec 2011 and left 2013, claiming 21 completed deals. Yet, GFL’s total deals 


completed from 2011 – 2013 are claimed to be 16, and total deals from 2007-2013 are 23. 


It’s hard to have faith in GFL’s numbers when they don’t reconcile.

Insights From A Call With A Former
GFL Employee Confirm Our View


“What is your opinion of GFL’s financial and accounting reporting systems? Were they accurate and robust enough to give 
investors an accurate and insightful view of the Company?”


“Yes, I think the IT infrastructure is solid, but where they breakdown is on the operations. If you don’t have a robust operational 
accounting system, you can’t roll that properly upstairs. One problem is if you don’t have independent reporting for each line of 
business, you get movement of cost and revenue that shouldn’t move. So for example, if you want to beef up the margins in one
business you allocate costs [elsewhere]. That’s one weakness in the financials for sure. Commercial should be doing 36% of EBIT,
Industrial 16%, Residential 10% of EBIT. Transfer stations can be either a cost or profit center. So when the market is looking is 
looking for 35/36% commercial and you’re not producing that, you can move costs to the transfer station where no one cares or
landfill where you’re making 46/50% and you can see those shenanigans going on without proper operational reporting.”

“GFL prospectus claims margin expansion opportunities: “As we execute on our growth strategies, we will continue to leverage 
our scalable capabilities to manage costs and drive higher operating margins”. What do you think of this?”


“(Chuckle) It’s a pretty story; sounds awfully good. You can’t achieve that if you don’t have the structure in place. Let me explain. 
No secret they wanted to go public multiple times but failed.  Have to have a national infrastructure and systems in place; GFL 
doesn’t have it in place. Mr Dovigi is reluctant to do it. That’s a roadblock. The history of GFL is independent cowboy operators, 
which is great, but when you try to put senior managers from the large public companies in place, none of them last. Look at the
CFO position, they’ve had like 5 people roll through that position in 4 years. Patrick runs it his way.”

that isn’t performing so well to bolster those numbers. An example would be between hauling and transfer stations. They’ll 
allocate the repair/fuel/labor to truck repair and transfer, over to hauling to bolster either P&L to basically suit what the market

GFL’s Material Weakness: Was It Resolved,
Or Quietly Minimized?


From its first SEC filing on July 19th 2019 – Feb 3th, 2020 GFL included language that pointed to a material weakness of 


financial controls. Yet, mysteriously this language disappeared in its final IPO prospectus in March 2020, leading 


investors to believe that the weakness was either remedied or did not exist.(1) Upon further investigation, including a 


review of GFL’s Q1 and Q2 2020 results, Spruce Point finds evidence that financial control deficiencies may still exist.


Failure to comply with requirements to design, implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material 


adverse effect on our business and stock price.


As a privately-held company, we were not required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in a manner that meets the standards of 


publicly traded companies required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("Section 404"), in the United States, or National Instrument 52-


109—Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings ("NI 52-109"), in Canada.


In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements, management has identified certain control deficiencies during its 


time as a privately-held company that together amount to a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 


in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim 


consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During this time, we did not have in place an effective control 


environment with formal processes and procedures or an adequate number of accounting personnel with the appropriate technical training in, 


and experience with, IFRS to allow for a detailed review of complex accounting transactions, including business combinations, that would 


identify errors in a timely manner. In addition, we did not design or maintain effective controls over the financial statement close and reporting 


process in order to ensure the accurate and timely preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS.


Subsequent to December 31, 2018, management has taken steps to address the material weakness and implement a remediation plan, 


which management believes will address the underlying causes. The Company has engaged external advisors to provide financial accounting 


assistance in the short term and we continue to evaluate and document the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and execute the 


remediation and implementation of our internal controls as required. The Company has hired a Vice President of Internal Audit and has reallocated existing 


senior finance personnel to focus on the design and effectiveness of internal controls. The Company is in the process of increasing certain personnel 


responsibilities to enhance appropriate segregation of duties where possible, establishing a more comprehensive review and approval process and 


implementing additional internal reporting procedures. While management believes that the steps taken to date are adequate in addressing the 


material weakness, the material weakness identified above cannot be considered remediated until the applicable relevant controls operate for a 


sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. No assurance can be 


provided at this time that the actions and remediation efforts will effectively remediate the material weakness or prevent the incidence of other 


material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting in the future.


Source: Initial F-1 (July 2019) and F-1 (Feb 3, 2020) 


1) Final Prospectus (March 2020) states “if material weaknesses are identified” and “Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal 


deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses which could result in a material misstatement of our annual consolidated financial 


statements, our interim reports, or disclosures that may not be prevented or detected.

Revenue Control Issues


Spruce Point believes that if revenue cannot be accurately depicted, then investors should have limited 


confidence in GFL’s entire financial reporting. We observe that GFL’s historical revenue for Q1 2019 does not 


even match between its Management Discussion & Analysis section and its Financial Statements. We believe this is 


an extreme concern and GFL’s audit committee should investigate.

Spruce Point finds it troubling that GFL restated results and did not notify investors of the change. The large

Run Away Fast From “Run-Rate EBITDA”


GFL’s Run-Rate EBITDA is a term heavily disclaimed by GFL and was questioned by the SEC Pre-IPO.(1) By reading 


the fine print, Spruce Point believes GFL management has wide discretion to over-estimate EBITDA to portray itself 


in the best light possible.

Mysterious Adj. EBITDA Margin Inflation
(Q1 2020)


Spruce Point also sees that GFL restated its Adjusted EBITDA to make the USA Waste segment’s margins look 


much better by +2.1% (210bps). Again, the boost came from the “Corporate” or “Intercompany” account.  Given 


GFL’s growth angle is in the U.S., it could provide motivation to inflate this figure.

Source: IPO Prospectus – March 4, 2020 


In our opinion, GFL is showing investors an inaccurate measure of its leverage. Per its own IPO 


Prospectus, its lenders evaluate it on a “Net Funded Debt” measure, and not “Total Gross Debt” as depicted in its 


recent earnings press release. GFL completely ignores capital and operating leases (among other forms of debt) 


in its reporting to investors.

Spruce Point’s Adjusted Leverage


Recall on the previous slide, GFL claims its Total Gross Debt is C$5,217m. However, this figure conveniently ignores leases, related-


party debt owed to CEO Dovigi and the TEU Notes which are debt equivalents. We estimate GFL’s debt is C$460m more than 


reported and financial data providers fail to capture the adjustments. The table below is our pro forma estimate for the planned 


acquisition of Waste Management / Advanced Disposal assets and WCA Waste.

We view GFL’s “Adjusted EPS” as highly problematic. We don’t understand why GFL is adding back $4.9m of IPO costs in Q2 despite its 


IPO occurring early March 2020 in Q1. GFL’s cash flow statement in Q2 shows no further inflows from equity issuance. Even more 


perplexing, GFL boosted an amortization add-back of deferred financing fees in the first half by $2.3m that is not mathematically supported 


by the fees in Q1 and Q2 2020. This allowed it to claim a $0.01 per share adjusted profit. As a result, we do not trust the reported results.

After a careful examination of GFL’s operating cash flows, we find an irreconcilable add-back for foreign exchange 


exposures on long-term debt. Spruce Point believes FX changes on long-term debt should not be viewed as an 


operating cash flow. This allowed GFL to show nearly double the cash flow from operations in the first half of the year at 


$82.0m versus $40.9m. The Company touted the growth in cash flow below.


“For the six months ended June 30, 2020, cash flow from operating activities was $82.0 million, an increase of 
125.9% compared to the same period in the prior year”

Capex Appears Understated Leading To 
Free Cash Flow Overstatement


Source: Q2 2020 financial statements


Note: GFL reports zero organic additions to intangible asset in H1 2020


GFL’s capex listed through the cash flow statement does not reconcile with capex additions through the PP&E 


accounts. As a result, we believe capex is being capitalized on the balance sheet by at least C$41.1m

More Capex Anomalies


Looking carefully at the bottom of the cash flow statement, GFL reports “supplemental information” related to 


“asset additions financed through leases”. We observe that that Q1 2020 + Q2 2020 results do not equal H1 2020 results. 


The magnitude of the misreporting is $15.7 million, or nearly 100%.

Spruce Point Has A Track Record Identifying Capex 
Accounting Anomalies As Leading Indicators of 
Underlying Problems


GFL’s capex accounting irregularities should not be taken lightly by investors. Spruce Point has a strong record of success 


unearthing previously-unidentified financial strain among companies reporting irregular or inconsistent capex figures. Included in 


these are some of our most successful short campaigns.


Report NASDAQ: CSTE | Aug 2015 / Oct 2015 NYSE: AOS | May 2019 and Twitter NYSE: USC | May 2018


Ent. Value $1.7 billion $7.8 billion $1.7 billion


Company 
Promotion / 


Situation 
Overview


Leading quartz countertop manufacturer capable of 
producing sustainable 43% and 26% gross and EBITDA 
margins, while producing double digit growth in the 
fast growing U.S. market. The Company claimed it 


needed to increase capex to construct a manufacturing 
facility in the U.S. to accelerate its North American 


expansion


Leading maker of water heaters and treatment 
products, boilers, and air purifiers. Fast and 


sustainable growth in China, allowing for corporate 
gross margins in excess of industry peers.


Highly accretive and synergistic North American 
roll-up of ready-mix concrete operations capable 


of expanding margins and growing earnings


Our Criticism Our intense fundamental and forensic due diligence 
uncovered evidence of slowing U.S. growth, and 


margin pressure being covered-up. We also expressed 
grave concerns about the Company’s strategy to 


build a U.S. manufacturing facility and believed its 
capex costs seemed overstated, which would allow 


capitalization of costs on the balance sheet and
potentially overstate earnings. Our background work 


into CEO Yos Shiran also revealed a pattern of 
mismanagement at Tefron, an Israeli textile company, 


that promoted a unique technology but failed


Our intensive due diligence revealed a number of 
capital expenditure anomalies, notably consistent 
mis-forecasting. These capex issues appeared to 


point to gross margin inflation via expense 
capitalization. Shifting revenue recognition standards


pointed to the possibility of aggressive booking of 
sales. Excessive spending on a protracted ERP
implementation also appeared to be linked to


accounting and financial issues


Becoming more aggressive in acquisitions to grow 
and providing limited deal transparency. GAAP vs. 
Non-GAAP strain intensifying. Leverage rising to 


pre-bankruptcy levels. CEO has hidden from 
disclosure a DWI arrest for reckless driving. 
Aggressive use of capital leases to embellish 


EBITDA. Management's history of meeting Capex 
guidance is horrendous. PP&E accounts suggest 
overcapitalization of costs with vehicle accounts 


up 500% yet physical trucks up 100%


Successful 
Outcome


Two CEO/CEO’s and two CFO/CFO’s of Caesarstone 
subsequently resigned. The Company later reported 
numerous manufacturing problems in both its new 
U.S. production and Israeli facilities. Gross margins 
contracted to 25%. The share price has fallen ~80% 


from our initiation price


Following a report from J Capital, AOS admitted that it 
had been engaging an undisclosed material supply 


chain partner in China, confirming suspicions of 
channel-stuffing. In Q2 2018, not long after we 
published our report, AOS substantially revised 
guidance, showing weakness in China with sales 


projected down 16-17%. AOS fired the President of 
A.O. Smith China in Feb 2020 following our report


Following our report, USCR continued to miss 
analyst expectations numerous times. In April 
2019, a regional executive resigned and in Feb 
2020, USCR announced its CEO would “retire”. 


Shares declined by approximately 55% following 
our report

We have shown that both GFL’s operating cash flow and capital expenditures do not reconcile. 


As a result, we believe its free cash flow is also potentially misstated. We believe adjusted H1 2020 free cash flow burn 


was ~60% worse than reported by GFL. 


“When you think about how cash flow and leverage should play out over the balance of the year, we 
should incur an additional $140 million to $150 million of CAPEX and approximately $140 million, $145 


million of cash interest costs in the second half of the year. If you layer on the conservative assumption of 
working capital, ending the year as cash flow neutral, you get to a free cash flow number of somewhere 
between $275 million and $300 million for the back half of the year, depending on your views of where 


we end up in terms of EBITDA.”

Spruce Point is surprised there is no FCF growth.

There’s a saying: “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”. We find it concerning that GFL is restating 


permitted landfill capacity from year end 2019, along with its Quebec fixed level capacity from 15 years to 9.8 years 


– a meaningful reduction.

Management Arguing For Significant 
One-Time Adjustments Without Justification?


Interestingly, GFL reports significantly higher unit-level landfill amortization than most peers – perhaps due to its relatively high exposure 


to liquid waste. However, in its latest quarterly release, management claimed that a purported $35m one-time adjustment – for which no 


details were provided whatsoever in prior SEC filings – would have reduced FY19 unit-level landfill amortization by ~25%. We wonder why 


such an enigmatic “one-time” item can simply be ignored when calculating GFL’s true underlying unit-level landfill amortization.

GFL Commentary At Odds With Market 
And It Walking Back Expectations


During Q2 earnings season, GFL talked up a bullish recovery, especially in July, when most competitors were 


signaling caution, GFL then later recalibrates expectations around working capital benefits. 


“Now the last sort of 3 weeks post, I would say the July long. We can, we've seen the business significantly uptick 
and is trending much closer to budget, then we've been for the whole year. 


So all signs are pointing in the right direction.”


GFL CEO


Dovigi


“Through July we were seeing landfill volumes up slightly sequentially. However, we were not experiencing the 
typical seasonal ramp we usually see during the summer months.”


Casella Waste


Q2 Earnings Call


“Sure. Yes. I mean, we are, to your point, seeing July continue to accelerate, albeit at a slightly slower pace. 
I mean, look, this kind of went from zero to not 70 miles an hour, but probably zero to 60 miles an hour pretty fast, 


and now we're moving back towards 70 miles an hour.”


Waste 


Management


Q2 Earnings Call


“Despite my comments about the strength of collections, given the uncertainty in the
current environment, we think it's prudent to adjust these expectations to remaining flat
for working capital for the year as a whole. We continue to see real upside opportunity in
the area of working capital. We're just re-calibrating expectations as to when those dollars


will be realized. In terms of the cadence, the anticipated Q3 revenue increase as we
rebound from Q2 will put pressure on Q3's working capital. So we expect Q3 to be close


to flat when the majority of the second half recovery will be realized in Q4.”

“Waste Industries, a GFL Environmental subsidiary, recently paid more than $15 million to settle years-running 
litigation over a Tennessee landfill. This includes $7 million for any remaining host fees and $8 million for outstanding 
expert fees and litigation costs. The November 2019 settlement is part of ongoing legal issues GFL is working through 
after its 2018 acquisition of the company. Obtained by Waste Dive through a public records request, the settlement 
between Waste Industries and Decatur County marks a resolution over the Decatur County Landfill in Bath Springs. 
Under the settlement, Waste Industries is also required to increase its performance bond posted with the Tennessee 
Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) to $20 million.”


GFL’s first foray into the U.S. was its $2.8bn merger with Waste industries in Nov 2018. In its Nov 1, 2019 F-1 SEC filing, GFL claimed 


it was “vigorously disputing the merits” of a legal case with Decatur County, and that it “cannot predict the final outcome of the 


dispute”. GFL said any legal resolutions would not have a material effect on it financial position. As such, it appears GFL did not 


take a legal accrual or charge for this litigation. Yet, with the benefit of a FOIA request, we see that GFL settled the case just 12 days 


later on Nov 12, 2019 for $15m. How could it not predict the outcome? With net losses projected to be ~$270m in the first nine 


months through Sept 30th and seeking funds through an IPO, how could GFL argue that a $15m settlement wasn’t material?


“Waste Services of Decatur, LLC ("WSD"), a subsidiary of Waste Industries, filed a declaratory judgment action against Decatur 
County related to WSD's life-of-site operating agreement for the MSW landfill owned by Decatur County. While the suit was 
dismissed, Decatur County brought a counterclaim against WSD and joined Waste Industries, LLC (collectively with WSD, the "Waste
Industries Parties") to the lawsuit alleging certain violations of environmental laws and claiming entitlement to remediation of
contamination conditions allegedly resulting from the Waste Industries Parties' operation of the MSW landfill and subsequently under 
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the RCRA. We do not believe Decatur County's allegations are supported or accurate. 
The Waste Industries Parties are vigorously disputing the merits of Decatur County's claims, but we cannot predict the final 
outcome of this dispute.

“That's, yeah I mean like I said like in any acquisition Michael, you've got your gold, silver, bronze and you get a 


couple of pieces lead. Right? It's what you do with the couple of lead you make a bronze, silver and silver gold. The 


bulk of what we’re getting is gold. There's some silver and bronze and a couple of pieces of lead. We’ve got to figure 


out what to do with the lead. But you have to take the good with the bad.”


GFL is acquiring Advance Disposal Services assets. If, by its own admission, it is getting a mixed bag of imperfect 


assets, than how is it possible based on the metrics it told investors, that the assets are among the most productive and 


profitable in the industry, and even above Waste Management’s corporate average? See the table below

“First, I think the majority of what we're getting is stuff that is coming off of the ADS platform. ADS operates on

and the integration team we have, we are believed, we're very well positioned to integrate these assets very easily.”


GFL/WM 


Deal


On June 24, 2020 GFL announced it’s acquiring assets to be divested from WM’s acquisition of Advanced Disposal. 


It’s paying US$835m, acquiring US$345m of revenues and 900 employees.

Signs Suggesting The Waste Management 
Deal Is At Risk


“I think we have -- let's start with the ADS transaction that we all talked about and had a call on. I think from 


the ADS perspective, we are ready to hit the switch. From an integration perspective, we spent -- obviously, 


we're in a constructive relationship with ADS and Waste Management. We spend a lot of time on planning to 


make sure that this goes smoothly. We have a full road map to actually get this done from an integration 


perspective, and we're just truthfully waiting to get the final DOJ sign-off so Waste Management can close 


theirs and then we can close our transaction 5 days later with them.”


Spruce Point believes it odd that GFL did not discuss an amended agreement with Waste Management on their 


Q2 earnings call. At the same time, GFL is introducing greater regulatory uncertainty by acquiring the WCA 


business. A new “forward-looking” risk factor statement highlighted by GFL may offer clues that its deals are on 


shaky regulatory grounds.

WCA Deal of Desperation 


In our opinion, GFL’s announced acquisition of WCA right after Q2 2020 earnings illustrates its desperation to paper over poo r 


performance. Spruce Point believes GFL is overpaying for WCA which was acquired for 1.9x and 8.8x Sales and EBITDA in 


2011, while GFL is paying 3x &11.5x. According to one analyst, “when it was publicly traded back in the early part of the 


decade at ~6x NTM EV/EBITDA it was not viewed as the highest quality asset.”(1) GFL has not yet made good on its promise 


to close the WM deal (subject to DOJ approval) and is acquiring yet another business subject to DOJ approval, imposing 


additional regulatory risk. Furthermore, GFL is financing the deal with $600m Preferred Shares convertible into 23.8m GFL sub


voting shares with a liquidation preference of 7%. This undercuts current GFL investors.

WCA Capex Discrepancy


A little more than 2 weeks before GFL acquired WCA Waste, Moody’s issued a report discussing WCA’s free cash flow 


constraints. Notably, Moody’s indicated WCA’s capex margin is 15%, well above the industry average. Yet, GFL’s investor 


presentation shows WCA’s capex margin at 10.5%. This is $18m of annual capex spend that GFL doesn’t appear to be 


accurately representing. We previously illustrated that GFL has capex accounting anomalies that understate capex amounts.

Unexplained Financial Expectation Revisions 
Conveniently Made When Promoting A New Deal


We find inconsistencies in GFL 2020 Free Cash Flow outlook in the second half of the year. There is no explanation as to why 2H 


FCF estimates changed from $275 - $300m to $318 - $328m in just a week’s time. Importantly, GFL’s outlook figures “excludes 


additional acquisitions that may close during the year, including the WCA transaction and the acquisition of divestiture assets 


from Waste Management and ADS.”  Thus, they should be apple-to-apples. We believe this is additional evidence of financial 


control concerns at GFL, or at worst management cherry-picking more flattering figures to sell the WCA deal to investors. 


Spruce

“When you think about how cash flow and leverage should 
play out over the balance of the year, we should incur an 


additional $140 million to $150 million of CAPEX and 
approximately $140 million, $145 million of cash interest 


costs in the second half of the year. If you layer on the 
conservative assumption of working capital, ending the 
year as cash flow neutral, you get to a free cash flow 


number of somewhere between $275 million and $300 
million for the back half of the year, depending on your 


views of where we end up in terms of EBITDA.”

Crime Doesn’t Pay: Rizzo Environmental Fraud


GFL announced its move into the U.S. through the acquisition of Rizzo Environmental Services, headquartered in Sterling Heights,


Michigan. The acquisition proved to be an inauspicious start to GFL’s U.S. expansion, as shortly thereafter, Rizzo was charged with 


fraud. Rizzo was able to maintain and expand his equity stake in GFL.(1) At a minimum, this illustrates poor due diligence on the part of 


GFL, and a consistent theme Spruce Point believes is occurring with GFL’s acquisitions. GFL paid $118m for Rizzo per court filings.

3) “Garbage Executive and Tow Company Owner Charged with Bribery and Fraud”, US Dept of Justice, May 2017


4) “Rizzo’s Red Garbage Trucks To Get Dumped Amid FBI Probe”, Detroit Free Press, Oct 2016


"Rizzo Environmental has a loyal and growing customer base because of its market leading customer service and its committed management 
team, led by Chuck Rizzo, Jr., who brings over 25 years of waste industry experience and relationships to GFL. “Chuck (Rizzo, Jr.) and his 
management team share the same growth vision and commitment to safety as GFL,” Dovigi continues. “Rizzo Environmental is a natural fit, 
both geographically and culturally, for GFL's plans to grow the GFL brand into the United States. We expect Rizzo Environmental to serve as 
a foundation from which GFL can continue its growth strategy into the Midwestern U.S. through both acquisitions and organic growth. The 
customers and employees of Rizzo Environmental will see little change in the way that Rizzo Environmental has historically operated with its 
headquarters remaining in Sterling Heights. GFL also announced that it has completed the acquisition of Enviro-Smart Organics Ltd. and West 
Coast Lawns, an organics waste processing facility and turf farm in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. GLF says that its acquisition of Enviro-
Smart confirms the company’s commitment to investing in environmental processes that can be applied and offered to customers from other 
GFL facilities.” (See: Enviro-Smart)

"The former CEO of garbage hauler Rizzo Environmental Services (RES), Charles B. “Chuck” Rizzo, 46, of Bloomfield Hills, was indicted 
today on five counts of bribery and three counts of conspiracy to commit bribery, in connection with garbage contracts in Clinton, 
Macomb, and Chesterfield townships, Acting United States Attorney Daniel L. Lemisch announced. The superseding indictment also charges 
Charles B. Rizzo and Fiore, as well as Rizzo’s father, Charles P. Rizzo, 70, of New Baltimore, and Derrick Hicks, 47, of Bloomfield Hills, with 
conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. In addition, Charles P. Rizzo is charged with seven counts of mail and wire fraud, and his son, 
Charles B. Rizzo, is charged with twelve counts of mail and wire fraud. The fraud charges are based on the defendants’ conspiracy involving 
at least ten different schemes to steal money from RES between 2013 and 2016, a time when the majority owner of RES was a New York 
based private equity firm.”

• “Dovigi said that had his company known about the probe, it likely would not have purchased Rizzo.”
• "When asked if he believes Chuck Rizzo Jr. owes his company an apology, he said: "For now – no.  It is what it is."

Did GFL Pay Almost $140m For Soil Safe, 
A Distressed Asset?


GFL announced the acquisition of Soil Safe in July 2019. The deal announcement lacked financial terms and any information that 


would give insight into Soil Safe’s state of affairs. However, Spruce Point’s investigation reveals the business was owned by Ares 


Capital Corp (NASDAQ: ARCC) a publicly traded BDC. Per Ares’ filings, we see that it marked the equity as worthless and booked a


$13m net realized gain. Soil Safe had $127m of sales through the 9m ended Sept 2019 (so we estimate $169m of annual sales). 


It appears that Soil Safe was struggling to make money and having to borrow at double digit interest rates.


Source: Ares 10-Q 6/30/19 and 10-Q 9/30/19


1)  GFL Press Release


"Soil Safe and its management team led by Mark Smith, are recognized as industry leaders in contaminated soil recycling and the 
development of inert soil products for beneficial use in sustainable construction and green building applications. GFL is one of the 
largest processors of contaminated soils in Canada and our acquisition of Soil Safe is in keeping with our strategy of replicating all 


of our service offerings in the US," said Patrick Dovigi, GFL's Founder and Chief Executive Officer. "Soil Safe's in-house expertise 
and recycled products complement and extend our existing capabilities as we build our infrastructure business to service our 


customers' needs across North America. We are excited to welcome Soil Safe and its employees to the GFL team."


Ares Capital marked Soil Safe’s equity at 


zero and booked a $13m “net realized 


gain”. This suggests the deal was close 


to the value of the debt’s fair value. The 


double digit interest rates paid by Soil 


Safe at a time of ultra low borrowing 


costs charged illustrate that Soil Safe 


was a deeply distressed company.

The Bestway Acquisition: Handled In The 
Worst Way According To Locals


GFL announced the acquisition of Bestway, pushing its expansion into the Midwest Colorado Springs region. The deal was 


promoted by Regional VP John Griffith, who described the deal “as an exceptional fit”, that customers “shouldn’t notice any change 


in service”,  and that all of Bestway’s management and senior staff would stay on with the business. However, Spruce Point’s 


research reveals otherwise. Customer complaints’ surged and GFL’s VP Griffith has since resigned.(1) Furthermore, we’ve heard that 


senior Bestway management has left the business, and their LinkedIn profiles corroborate this by not mentioning GFL.(2) Based on 


our research, GFL paid $84m. We estimate Bestway had $30m of sales, and GFL paid a hefty 2.8x / 10x multiple of sales and EBITDA.

“Bestway is a great company and compliments GFL’s existing footprint in Colorado,” says John Griffith, a regional vice president of GFL. “This 
merger is an exceptional fit for both companies, because it allows for Bestway to access to GFL’s greater resources, capital, and expertise in 
things like safety and sustainability, while still allowing Bestway to maintain its culture of excellent customer service and its special relationship 
with the Colorado Springs community to remain intact. Griffith said that apart from some technological upgrades coming to Bestway’s internal 
systems, its existing customers shouldn't notice any change in services. All of Bestway’s 153 employees and management team were retained 
in the merger. “We are proud that all of Bestway’s management and senior staff has been invited to stay post-merger and has elected to do so,” 
Griffith says. “With the addition of the Bestway team, the future very bright for GFL in Colorado.”

• “Other customers complained that they were unable to contact the company about missed pickups.”
• “I’ve called and emailed,” Shannon J. wrote on the Facebook page. “Nothing. My trash can is overflowing.”
• “But then, GFL started moving more than 40,000 residential customers to a new billing system that was considerably more complex than 


Bestway’s had been. The company also brought in GFL’s phone system.
• Staton said he probably underestimated the difficulty of making the switches.
• “In early July, customers of GFL Environmental started reaching out to the 11 News Call For Action team noting several issues with the new

Enviro-Smart or Enviro-Stupid Acquisition?


GFL touted the acquisition of Enviro-Smart Organics, but we believe it is not without problems. The Company has operated without


an air quality permit for years. Locals claim the foul stench is a serious problem. GFL must contain the odors within 1km of the


facility, but has claimed onerous capital investment as a means to appeal. In our opinion, this is just another poorly planned deal by 


GFL that resulted in unexpected higher costs to shareholders.

• "It's gross. It feels like you're living in garbage," he added.
• “The stench emanating from Enviro-Smart Organics has drawn the scorn of hundreds of residents in the residential

• ‘In early August, Metro Vancouver finally issued a permit for Enviro-Smart Organics. The company is now required to enclose 


all of the waste that currently sits outdoors.”
• "By March 2020, the company must fully enclose its odorous sources, take that air and fully treat it," said Ray Robb, Metro 


Vancouver's regulation and enforcement division manager.”
• The 43-page-permit ultimately orders the smells to be contained within one kilometre of the facility by the 2020 deadline. 
• "The likelihood is that while the appeal process is in place, GFL won't invest in the new facility," he said. GFL can also appeal 


the conditions of the permit.

gives GFL a foothold in eight new Midwest states — Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio — and 


expands its presence in Michigan. Future Environmental generates an estimated $75-$80 million worth of revenue. While CEO Dovigi was 


calling it “one the premiere liquid waste businesses in the U.S.” the evidence suggests otherwise. Within just a few months, the Illinois EPA 


agency levied enforcement charges against GFL for systems “in poor condition” which caused oil leakage and ground damage. 


Spruce Point believe this is further evidence of poor acquisition and property due diligence on the part of GFL.

Future Environmental (Problems!), (Cont’d)


Based on our research, we believe GFL had significant employee retention issues from its acquisition of Future 


Environmental. A local court case in Illinois shows GFL had to file an injunction against employees going to Hunter 


Pipeline Services. We also find LinkedIn employee profiles showing overlap between these two companies.

Board: Whose Interests Are Served?

Spruce Point Has Concerns With Some of GFL’s 
Board And Its “Independence”


Spruce Point believes investors should not be comforted by GFL’s supposed “Independent” Board. As a documented fact, Mr. 


Nayar is an advisor to BC Partners, the largest institutional shareholder BC Partners. Mr. Guindi’s firm received fees from 


OTPP and BC Partners.

Little Upside Seen In The Stock Even Among 
Bullish Analyst Base


Sell-side analysts are generally bullish on GFL, and take management’s narrative at face value that GFL is a value-


accretive roll-up with more room to expand through acquisitions. In addition, sell-side analysts believe GFL’s story that 


margins will expand as it defines a path towards profitability. Analysts give GFL full credit for the WM and WCA deals 


despite the DOJ regulatory approval risks the persist. We believe, based on our rigorous investigation, that GFL’s 


financial objectives are highly likely to fall short of expectations.

Bull Case Narrative Is All “Trust Me” Fluff


Spruce Point finds little independent evaluation of management’s claims from the sell-side analysts, whom are 


compensated with lucrative fees for assisting GFL with financing and M&A advisory fees to implement its roll-up.


Impossible to evaluate 


the parts when few 


details about the 


acquisition parts are 


provided!


Then why have recent deals been heavily in the U.S.? Based on our 


research, we believe GFL is reaching up against potential antitrust /  


competitive issues and market saturation in Canada.


Any specifics and why hasn’t this been achieved over the past few 


years? What has GFL been doing all this time?


Perhaps valuation discount exists because 


GFL management are poor at operations?

Insights From Calls With Former 
GFL Employees: Will GFL Make Money?


“There are two parts, U.S. and Canada. Canada is quite saturated and prices are competitive. Chances of making big profits 
in solid waste, are not going to happen. GFL’s main money maker is the infrastructure business. I am less familiar with the 
U.S. side of the business. It’s tough to say if GFL will make money in the next year or two.” 


Former GFL 


Employee 2


“Will GFL ever make money from a high level. They talk about opportunities to expand margins, and acquire. Based on your 
experience, will they achieve these objectives in the long-run?”


Spruce Point


“Do you have confidence GFL can make money?”Spruce 
Point


“Under the current management structure and people, no. I would never put a dime in there. If you could see a mature 
management in the industry, absolutely, there’s an opportunity….I have no confidence at this point and time.”

“Does GFL have a path to profitability?”Spruce Point


Former 


Employee 3


“That’s the wildcard in the GFL story, that’s the gamble. Acquisitions play a key part to keep the momentum going. 
What happens when acquisitions stop? You need profitability. Can they turn around? Today they are not making money. 
That’s a fact. I don’t know if they can. They’ve acquired so rapidly.”

Even If You Believe GFL’s Financials At Face 
Value, Its Shares Are Very Expensive


Source: Company financials, Bloomberg, and Spruce Point analysis and adjustment for the TEU impact


Spruce Point believes the market is overvaluing GFL, in part by not accurately modeling the impact of its TEUs which 


further increase its enterprise value. As a result, we believe on certain metrics like sales, EBITDA and operating cash 


flow, GFL is trading at a premium to industry blue chips Waste Management, Republic Services, and Waste Connections 


on future financial expectations.

Investors Ascribe Industry High Value 
To GFL’s Intangible Assets


Average


While many GFL stock promoters will point to its revenues and EBITDA to argue it’s undervalued to peers, none have 


pointed out the unexplained financial revisions to these figures that undermine confidence in its reporting, or point out 


the staggering amount of goodwill and intangibles assets on its balance sheet, accumulated from overpaying for assets 


in our view. We have provided numerous examples of deals that have had problems, suggesting that these intangible 


assets are at risk of impairment. GFL’s has the highest market cap to intangible assets in the industry. If, as suggested 


by an industry observer, more than half of GFL’s deals are failures, we believe its market cap could easily be halved.

Note: Our GFL market cap adjusted for tangible equity units


“If I were to take a conservative estimate, well over 50% of GFL’s 100+ acquisitions I’d characterize as a failure.”

GFL “Tangible Equity Unit” Misclassified Causing 
Unjustified Buying


Blackrock’s iShares ETF (NYSE: PFF) owns 1.1m shares ($65m) of GFL’s Tangible Equity Units “TEU” / (NYSE: GFLU). Per PFF’s 


prospectus it is designed to match the ICE Exchange Listed Preferred & Hybrid Securities Index (PHGY). The index specifies that it 


is to include “Preferred” securities and Hybrids that “potentially convert into preferred shares”. However, in our opinion, there is 


nothing preferential about GFLU. GFLU TEUs are convertible into subordinate voting shares, which are described clearly as 


subordinate to any preferred shares. Furthermore, the GFLU security is ~83% linked to the sub voting equity and ~17% tied to a 


subordinated and unsecured note making the emphasis on the security more towards the non-preferential subordinate voting 


shares.  As a result, we believe the ICE Index and PFF have created unjust buying of a misclassified security.

GFL Subordinating Voting Shares 
Really “Income” Securities?


Spruce Point believes “creative” financial engineering by GFL around its subordinated common stock has broadened its 


shareholder base. Despite not making money, GFL pays a token US$ 0.01 cent quarterly dividend on its subordinate 


voting shares, giving the stock an annualized yield of just 0.18%. We find that two funds – one fund calling itself a 


“monthly high income fund” and another an “income fund” – own GFL.  Spruce Point is baffled why a “monthly” income 


fund would own a stock that pays a quarterly dividend, and is hard pressed to see why a paltry 0.18% yield is attractive. 


When seeing GFL’s US$ 0.01 cent dividend, Spruce Point is reminded of Maxar Technologies, another short call of ours 


that had an irrational dividend policy and slashed its dividend to $0.01 per share upon revealing its distress.
