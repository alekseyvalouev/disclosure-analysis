Summary


Sell-side research analysts misstate Google search results.


Low repeat rate will drive continued advertising spending and destroy EBITDA
margins.


Highly frequent insider selling adds pressure.


Inventory-light model raises questions over product quality assurance.


Just when I thought the bear case for Wayfair (NYSE: W) has become crystal clear that no
sell-side research analyst would even entertain defending the stock, BAML analysts Paul
Bieber and Justin Post proved me wrong. In a note published on Monday, the pair of
research analysts upgraded the stock from neutral to buy, despite slashing their price
target by 17%. Furthermore, a substantial portion of their bull case rests on Wayfair's high
placement in organic search results on Google for home goods. But did they properly
Google the keywords they claim to have Googled?


"We performed 50 searches on Google for home goods and our analysis indicated that W
was the #1, #2, or #3 organic search result 80% of time". Unfortunately for investors
heeding the opinion of the pair of analysts at BAML, they did not seem to perform the
Google searches they claim to have performed. Of the random 50 sample search phrases
the analysts claim to have Googled, 25 were ranked #1 for organic search results on
Google and 11 were ranked #2, according to them. I performed identical searches of the
key phrases in Google and received a set of completely different results. Now, there are
two possibilities here: it could be that the BAML analysts did not bother erasing their
cookies before conducting their little exercise, or it could be that they did not even bother
actually doing the searches on Google. Either way, the factual error undermines their
credibility, as investors would reasonably expect internet research analysts to understand
that Google uses cookies to customize search results.


Of the 23 items ranked #1 by BAML, only 7 items are actually #1 when searched on
Google, with the rest all ranked lower. "Table linen", for example, is ranked #6 even
though BAML claimed it is #1. Of the 11 items ranked #2 by BAML, only 1 item was

actually ranked #2 on Google, with the rest all ranked lower. "Dinner plates", for example,
is ranked #5 as opposed to #2 claimed in BAML's research.

Oftentimes, sell-side analysts have different points of view that are subject to debate. As
stretched as the merits of their argument might be, the points are, at a minimum, based on
facts. Organic Google search results are not subject to debate. Before recommending
your clients to get into a money-losing e-commerce business, at a minimum, make sure
you have conducted correct Google searches.


Cohort Analysis


To analyze a business model such as Wayfair's, access to proper cohort data will help
investors understand whether the company's business model and brand are indeed
gaining grounds with customers. Analysts have gone to great length to highlight repeat
purchase behaviors at Wayfair. No bull thesis stands without assuring investors that the
company will be able to retain customers after it turns off the tap on advertising spending.
Unfortunately, with the exception of its IPO prospectus, Wayfair seems to have been trying
hard not to disclose a proper set of cohort data that will show the percentage of repeat
customers over time.


Instead, Wayfair management and sell-side analysts have been actively promoting two
sets of seemingly similar data points, hoping investors might simply equate those to
proper cohort data.


Almost always, when management actively hides readily available data and direct
investors' attention to data that look alike, there is something under the hood that is worth
digging. In the case of Wayfair, it is important to explain why seemingly rapidly improving
data points offered by management do not translate to sufficient improvement in customer
retention.


Company management likes to point to a PowerPoint slide in its investor presentation
deck showing rapid improvement of its gross revenue per customer over time.

On the surface, it looks like an impressive achievement showing customers acquired in
more recent period spending more over time than customers acquired in older periods.
Management further highlighted that in the 6th month post initial purchase, average 2014
customers spent over twice as much as ones in 2011.


First of all, it is a fairly confusing set of data. To calculate the average spending during the
6th month of initial purchase of customers acquired in a specific year, Wayfair has to track
July spending pattern for customers acquired in January, August spending for ones
acquired in February, and so on and so forth until it aggregates December spending for
customers acquired in June. If you assume a constant order size and a constant
percentage of 6th-month repeat customers, the disclosure really provides a snapshot of
repeat customer rate in the 6th month post initial purchase relative to prior years.


Going back to the repeat customer definition in Wayfair's prospectus, the company defines
a repeat customer as someone who purchased from the same site at least twice during
the quarter and the subsequent 270 days. In another word, a repeat customer is the
cumulative probability of someone who bought again in either the 1st month, the 2nd
month or 3rd month etc., up until the 9th month after his initial purchase. For the more
mathematical minded, think of the repeat customer percentage as a bell-shaped

cumulative probability function, with each further month representing a smaller percentage
of the repeat customer percentage. This is also easy to understand, because over the
span of 9 months, a repeat customer is much more likely to purchase in the first month of
their initial purchase rather than wait till the 9th month to make a repeat purchase.


Wayfair disclosed in the third quarter of 2011 and 2013, repeat rates were 15.9% and
24.2% respectively. Due to the way repeat customer is defined, 1st-month and 2nd-month
gross revenue per customer over time is likely a better proxy to assess the repeat rate
trend. A rough bootstrap of years 2011 and 2012 (data from the 3rd quarter of 2011) for
the first month yielded roughly 9.5x, and in the years 2013 and 2014 yielded roughly 15x.
The percentage increase also corresponds to Wayfair's reported repeat rate increase from
15.9% to 24.2%. If one were to perform a similar calculation, the company's repeat rate in
2015 so far is likely right around 30%. Now, sell-side analysts like to compare Wayfair
against other similar players in e-commerce - a 30% repeat rate should warrant a
significant discount relative to peers. At a $2 billion-a-year run rate, if Wayfair still
manages to lose 70% of its customer after acquisition, its long-term viability is severely
questionable, as the company may never be able to turn off its advertising spending.


Oftentimes, investors find it difficult to navigate companies with obviously flawed business
models, yet seemingly improving metrics. When Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) and Zulily
(NASDAQ:ZU) were skyrocketing on improving metrics, fundamental flaws in their
business models often get cast aside as sell-side research analysts cheerlead quarterly
improving metrics as proving a successful business model. Nothing can be further from
the truth. Oftentimes, in the case of flawed business models, a temporary improvement in
metrics have explanations unrelated to business model validation. My note on flawed
cohort analysis in Angie's List should serve as an alarming bell that overly relying on sell-
side interpretation of improving metrics could likely spell disasters down the road.


Insider Sale


While much of the bear case on Wayfair has been extensively discussed, one thing that
has yet to garner much attention is the pattern of insider selling at the company. Its
founders and executive team members are among the most frequent insider sellers I have
ever seen. The 10b-5 trading plan of its senior executives and founders provide monthly
selling in excess of 135,000 shares. What makes Wayfair's case more interesting than
others is the fact that every single member of its executive team seems to be engaged in
the monthly trading plan, even ones who own relatively small amount of the stock. The

trading plan makes Wayfair a more attractive candidate for short selling, due to the
constant addition to free float. With the Labor Day holiday behind us and sell-side
research pumping out bullish notes, a secondary offering is likely imminent.


Conclusion


Wayfair has an indefensible business model. Spending massive amount of money to buy
traffic is a losing proposition when you cannot afford to compete on price with Amazon in
high-volume merchandise. With investors being blinded by growth in a low inflation, low
interest rate environment, less thought is given to the fact a $2 billion revenue business
should not be posting negative EBITDA unless it has fatal flaws in its business model. I
struggle to find another viable consumer retail name that posts negative EBITDA at such
scale of revenue. Wayfair's inventory-light model dictates that the company lacks control
over what is shipped to its customers and sufficient assurance over the quality of its
products. I would like to leave my readers with the review posted by Chelsea of Wayne,
PA, after she purchased a wine rack from Wayfair. Although an isolated incident, it speaks
to the fundamental issue facing the company as it continues to grow. Just as vendors
praised Wayfair, consumers are not necessarily dealing with the best products when they
buy from Wayfair.


"My boyfriend sent me this as a housewarming present. I was extremely excited to
open it. We opened the box when it arrived and when we pulled out the wine rack
from the back, out came a decaying mutilated body of a cat. It was honestly one of
the most traumatizing things I've ever seen. My whole apartment smelled like
decaying flesh. I don't know how that happened but dear lord you guys need to
check your packaging because it was horrific. 
 
When we called the company they offered us 25% off our next order... thanks, I
guess? If that's how you deal with sending a customer a dead animal in their
package, you all need to seriously rethink your customer service. I do not think I can
ever order from you all again and I am telling all my friends and family about it.
Supposedly you're sending me a new wine rack, I'd appreciate it if you check the
box for animals before sending. To all that think this review is a joke, unfortunately it
is not. I hope this NEVER EVER happens to anyone else."
