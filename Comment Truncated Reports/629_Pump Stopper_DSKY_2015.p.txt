iDreamSky Technology: Strong Sell On Obsolescence, Game Failures
And Accounting Issues -68% Downside

Summary


DSKY’s American SEC documents show curious differences with local Chinese
SAIC filings, CFO associated with bankruptcy and failure, raising serious questions
about cash balances, profit margins and accounting integrity.


DSKY in terminal decline with past hit games rolling off while “real-time” data shows
new games are failing while DSKY content partners experience rampant piracy and
financial disappointment.


DSKY is being inevitably disintermediated, Tencent excluding DSKY by buying up
quality content while foreign game companies rapidly open local Chinese
development offices of their own.


China Mobile recently halted billing, which could not come at worse time as DSKY
has limited time to milk final remaining dollars from declining past hit games.


Wall Street DSKY revenue estimates are impossible as DSKY business continues to
implode, DSKY investors are confused valuing DSKY on future earnings and are
missing “melting ice cube” dynamic.


I believe DSKY is a "walking zombie" Chinese JOBS act IPO experiencing inevitable
decline with serious accounting and financial statement integrity issues. Even if you trust
DSKY's financial statements, long term I believe it is fundamentally worthless and will
become obsolete while "real time" data shows near term revenue estimates are
impossible. Shockingly, DSKY Chinese SAIC filings show "curious" differences relative to
US SEC filings, as Chinese tax filings show much lower past cash balances and margins
than reported to American investors, raising serious questions about the integrity of
DSKY's SEC filings. Furthermore, DSKY's CFO is associated with bankruptcy and failure
while DSKY's IR partner is a notorious Chinese IR firm known for touting Chinese stocks
later facing fraud allegations.


US investors confuse DSKY with a China growth story, valuing it as if it were a going
concern based on vague and unsubstantiated future "earnings" multiples, while missing
the decline rates of its games. After IPO'ing on the back of an unusual, one-time game

success, DSKY is now trapped with current games rolling off, new games failing, and their
entire business model becoming obsolete at a rapid pace.

Even if you trust DSKY's financial statements, DSKY is trapped in a fundamental "death
spiral" while juggernaut competitors outbid them for content, forcing DSKY into swift
obsolescence. As it continues to become increasingly obvious DSKY revenue estimates
are impossible, I expect DSKY stock will continue to collapse and, after wasting it's cash
balances overpaying for "left over" content, DSKY will dwindle towards eventual
irrelevance and failure.


DSKY Quick Fundamental Summary and Background


If you want a candid discussion of DSKY's fate and background from a DSKY founder, I
strongly recommend you watch this two part interview with DSKY's Jeff Lyndon here and
here.


Originally a failed game developer (iGameDock) itself, DSKY is what is known in the
gaming industry as a "publisher" or "distributor" meaning DSKY is a middle man for foreign
game developers to distribute Android games in China. DSKY takes foreign games (like
Gameloft's), makes small changes for language and monetization, and then manages
distribution and sales in China. For this task DSKY has historically collected a gross
margin "publishing tax" of 35-40%. Since DSKY was one of the first players to take this
niche seriously, DSKY initially had limited competition on choosing which games to
distribute. Therefore, DSKY was able to take already successful games from other
markets and get them to China while marketing them before pirate game cloning studios
could steal the games and monetize their own distributed clones.


Historically, when mobile or social games initially take off in a region, distributors have
played a temporary role. In the US for example, during the early days of Facebook
(NASDAQ:FB) and Mobile similar distributors like 6wave and Chillingo thrived temporarily
before essentially flaming out and failing.


The reason these distributors temporarily rise, only to later become epic fails, is because
in the early days of gaming the fresh content providers are small and the ecosystem is
evolving with lots of moving parts. However as the market evolves, the game developers

themselves become large and more sophisticated while simultaneously the platforms
consolidate, streamlining the ecosystem, and eventually leaves the distributors without a
business.


(pic by me)


The problem for DSKY, which other game distributors before them also experienced, is
that unfortunately now all of the factors which helped DSKY in the past are reversing into
headwinds, swiftly rendering DSKY obsolete. DSKY founder Jeff Lyndon has said himself
(at 15:40) that in 2011-2012 the Chinese market was dominated by American companies
but in the future he expects the market to become essentially 100% Chinese game
developer driven.


DSKY Old Games Rolling Off, New Games Failing


I will go through why DSKY is currently failing, but first let me prove to you the math of
DSKY's impossible future and show you what is going on here.


The first fact you need to understand is that it has been a LONG time since DSKY
distributed a homerun hit game.

(DSKY website)


This temporary benefit was great for DSKY at the time, but the problem is DSKY is still
expected to grow, and to grow from this would require keeping games in the top ten in
China as mobile gaming is financially a "winner take all" arena. We can see below in early
2014 DSKY had 3 of the top ten titles, something I believe will never repeat.


(pic credit DSKY)


To see where DSKY is now, since DSKY is a customer focused company, we have all the
data available to make a pretty good "real time" revenue model by using App Annie and
taking snap shots of Android game download screens. I have "real time" Android
download models but for presentation simplicity we'll use App Annie as a proxy for now.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3174406-idreamsky-technology-strong-sell-on-obsolescence-game-failures-and-accounting-issues-minus-68-percent-downside


For those of you who think App Annie is not a useful estimate, Chukong (DSKY's largest
distribution competitor) disagrees and publicly uses App Annie data as Chinese market
proxy routinely. App Annie provides ranking data free for anyone to look at but I highly
suggest you pay for AppAnnie revenue numbers as I've found them quite accurate
historically.


We can see below all DSKY's games still rank well out of the top games they used to be.
Even the hyped Bruce Lee addition to Temple Run only generated one very small bump
(right at the end of Q1) in usage before settling back down near irrelevance.


(pic credit App Annie)


And if we look at the current top games in China, we see now DSKY titles are absent with
the top game titles now dominated by DSKY's theoretical partner Tencent
(OTCPK:TCEHY).

and it seems DSKY's partner Fruit Ninja is still experiencing widespread piracy??


(pic credit recent Chukong presentation)


From a revenue perspective, for DSKY to hold game revenue flat would need to keep
distributing homerun, top 10 games because the "melt off" of Chinese mobile game users
is extremely quick (and actually getting quicker). We can see below that in 14 days nearly
90% of players have fallen off and in 30 days 93% of total users have left. Here, DSKY
founder Jeff Lyndon says China casual games are lucky to have a user life of 2 weeks.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3174406-idreamsky-technology-strong-sell-on-obsolescence-game-failures-and-accounting-issues-minus-68-percent-downside


(pic credit talking data)


DSKY has quoted numbers higher than this but no matter whose numbers you use,
retention of Chinese mobile gamers is very short. We can also see that percent of users
who end up paying (daily%p) and ARPU are also extremely low for Chinese gamers.


(pic credit talking data)


With the known lifespan of old gamers, the arpu, % of total users who ever pay and
sequential downloads we can estimate DSKY revenue and see there is just no way DSKY
can keep up past revenue levels for any sustained period of time. If DSKY wants future
growth, they need to constantly put up hit top 10 games. However, DSKY's new games
are failing miserably and they appear to be getting desperate. Let me explain:


DSKY's Cookie Run Disaster: Financial Failure and Rampant Piracy
5/22/2018 iDreamSky Technology: Strong Sell On Obsolescence, Game Failures And Accounting Issues -68% Downside - iDreamSky Technology (…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3174406-idreamsky-technology-strong-sell-on-obsolescence-game-failures-and-accounting-issues-minus-68-percent-downside


One of the main excuses given for DSKY's latest earnings call disaster was a delayed
launch of Cookie Run. However, if we look to see how DSKY's Cookie Run is doing now, it
looks like a total disaster. Given the low amount of downloads we can see below, I
estimate generated revenue is ~$0. Furthermore how is it possible DSKY had a "source
code issue" when it appears DSKY already did a pilot launch last year? Is DSKY just
making excuses for a very poor launch?


(pic credit Cookie Run)


Even more concerning, when we look this game up (see below) we find an overwhelming
amount of Cookie Run counterfeits which have been available for a long time! (This is an
unappreciated structural headwind DSKY faces - there are a lot of virtually instant and
increasingly high quality counterfeit games in China.) Where is DSKY protecting their
content provider and taking these down?!

(pic credit Cookie Run Clones)


Aside from the rampant piracy and failed launch, if we look at Cooke Run it becomes clear
this is a "has been" game that was popular in Japan years ago but has been losing market
share for a long time now.

DSKY's Other Hyped Game "Monument Valley" Also Failing with Minimal DSKY
work and Piracy


As another example of DSKY's desperation and failure, consider the game Monument
Valley they hyped on the last call. This game is obviously a stretch to economically
distribute in the Chinese market given the UsTwo founder's preference for up front game
5/22/2018 iDreamSky Technology: Strong Sell On Obsolescence, Game Failures And Accounting Issues -68% Downside - iDreamSky Technology (…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3174406-idreamsky-technology-strong-sell-on-obsolescence-game-failures-and-accounting-issues-minus-68-percent-downside


payment (instead of F2P) and minimal financial success in developer markets.


However the issue is that this game has been cracked and available in China for many
months for free while it's "pay up front" model just doesn't work in China. DSKY apparently
offered to bring it to China but Chinese gamers have been complaining that DSKY FAILED
as they apparently did essentially zero work on the art or gameplay?


If monument valley simply wanted their game reskinned in Chinese with virtually zero
development work then they could have gone to any app competitor highlighted above
who does this for <$1k and puts the app on top 20 stores (90%+ of the market). Even
more absurd, China was already paying small amounts for Monument Valley apparently in
a manner that didn't require UsTwo to pay DSKY at all! If we attempt to lookup DSKY's
distributed Chinese version of Monument Valley it is basically nowhere to be found far as I
can tell! What is going on here?!


It is clear to me there is no way either of these games, or any of the other games in
DSKY's portfolio, have any hope of upstaging Temple Run or Subway Surfer to become a
top game.


Why is DSKY Failing Miserably To Launch New Hit "Top 10" Games?


There are many reasons for the eventual demise of DSKY but the primary issues are:
DSKY getting squeezed out by consolidating mobile platforms (like Tencent) and the
parabolic increase in Chinese mobile gaming competition while foreign game companies
gain China sophistication and setup shop in China themselves. In other words, DSKY's
value proposition has eroded badly.


Chinese Android Market: Rapidly Consolidating and Squeezing DSKY Out.


In the early days of Chinese mobile gaming, the Android market was extremely
fragmented. This era is coming to an end as the Chinese app market is becoming quite
consolidated. We see below that (even using a chart from 12m ago) the top 9 app stores
alone have ~100% of market activity, compared to an estimated >800 total China Android
App stores 6 years ago.

Much of China's app stores consolidation has happened and billing/monetization is
apparently next.


"From what App Annie knows about the Chinese market, we're starting to see a
consolidation of the top five or six app stores - the distribution platforms," says
Schmitt. Monetization is following suit. China's three major carriers released a joint
billing SDK for developers."


Now with the China Android app platform market and monetization consolidating, the next
step is for platforms [Qihu (NYSE:QIHU), Tencent, etc.] to go straight to content providers
and remove distributors with excessive margins (DSKY), and this is happening now in a
big way.


Tencent especially has been aggressive in going straight to content providers and signing
very rich deals. Most recently, Tencent bought a direct $126m stake in Gluu Mobile
(NASDAQ:GLUU) after buying a $400m stake in Riot Games, a $330m 40% stake in Riot
Games and a $500m stake in CJ games corp. Now 7 of 10 top grossing games are
Tencent's games on Tencent's WeChat as Tencent takes over the market, and even worse
for DSKY, Tencent plants to dramatically increase future volume of games published on
WeChat! EVEN WORSE Tencent is aggressively working with foreign game developers to
help them enter China!

List of Tencent's foreign gaming investments just from 2013 and older.


It's not just Tencent though, as now Xiaomi is making and buying their own games while
China Mobile (CHM) doing the same and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) also [with SkyMobi
(NYSEMKT:SKY)] becoming increasingly active in Chinese mobile gaming. Qihoo also
summarized its intention to compete directly with DSKY at recent development
conference:


"We helped many western developer/publishers make a hit in China include:
Disney, EA, Glu and Gameloft. 360 Store accounts for 40% of market share, we
distribute mobile contents to our 400mn active users' smart phones through 360
Mobile Assistant(our killer app). We are very interested in bringing Western
Mobile Games to Chinese players. Please feel free to contact us if you are
planning to enter China."

Tencent even offering localization for King's candy crush as early as last year and then
Tencent also going directly to Japan and Korea to lockup the best content and most
popular games there directly as well. This only ends one way for DSKY....


One reason Tencent and Qihu can pay more than DSKY, and still generate attractive
returns on their game development deals is because the platform Channel and
Billing/Monetization costs are as much as 60% of gross revenue!


(pic credit TalkingData)


As you see above, Tencent and Qihu collect at least 30% of gross revenue from
Channel/Platform cost. As a result, they can expand their own margins while
simultaneously giving much more of the total revenue to game developers by removing
DSKY entirely.


The $100-500m+ checks Tencent and others are writing are checks DSKY simply can't
afford. Fortunately (for shorts) this will only get worse, as DSKY's business dev head has
stated he expects the upfront cash payments to content developers to move into the "eight
figures" (!!!), effectively pricing DSKY out of the market in my view.

Increasing Sophistication of Chinese and Foreign Mobile Game Companies = DSKY
Obsolescence


"What I foresee in 12-24 months from this (2014) it will be all Chinese games in
China"


-Jeff Lyndon, DSKY Founder


It seems we can expect DSKY's current distributor business model to be disintermediated
within the next 12-18 months. The problem is twofold, first Chinese (and other Asian)
game developer quality is improving rapidly, which negates any reason to work with DSKY
as they obviously don't need help understanding their own culture. Back in 2012, 90% of
top games in china were Western games but that has shifted rapidly and we can see at
15:45 DSKY founder Jeff Lyndon knows Korea and Japan can produce the same quality
of games as the US but with better natural culture for Asian customers. As these Asian
game companies get increasingly comfortable in China, the Korean, Japanese, and
Taiwanese game developers are also now opening their own offices in China and working

directly with Chinese platform companies, cutting DSKY out entirely. Even the US
distributors are moving in with juggernaut Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) mobile
distribution division Chillingo, publisher of Cut the Rope, Angry Birds, and others will have
an office of their own office direct in China.


Furthermore, DSKY states the larger game companies are not likely to need publishers in
China long term. Example one is "Plants vs. Zombies", who entered the China market on
their own and kept DSKY's margins for themselves. They had to pay to get up the learning
curve but now even DSKY admits "they've picked it up. They're doing well now".


Even other lesser issues for mobile games in China are rapidly being resolved.
Compressing and "right sizing" games in China is largely not an issue anymore as WiFi
has become increasingly ubiquitous, 3/4G data plans are getting cheaper and China local
phones by Xiami and Huawei offer high performance cheaply. There are even marketing
focused companies to help mobile game developers while of course partnering with a
platform like Tencent or Qihu thoroughly addresses that.


As China has become a larger and more important market, foreign game companies
inevitably setup their own development arms in China, staffed with Chinese employees,
and are expected to begin producing China focused/dedicated games.


We are already seeing competition squeeze DSKY also, as their direct and large
competitor Chukong, is working with many of DSKY's claimed customers. If DSKY truly
had a strong advantage as they claim, I don't see why Gameloft, Ubisoft or Disney would
need to work with other Chinese distributors who compete with DSKY such as Chukong.

As a result of these simultaneous dynamics, the Chinese game company has become
virtually impossible for anyone but Tencent and Qihu. Mobile game development in China
is now so competitive there are apparently 15,000+ mobile game companies (double rest
of the world!) in China with success rates of ~0.1%. The competition is so fierce, Baidu VP

has stated >57% of new mobile games are lucky to live past 10 days! For the ones that
live longer than a week, according to China Intl Digital Entertainment (China Joy) even
back in Q2-2014 a full 95% of mobile games fail to generate any profit with only the top
1% of mobile games generating gross billings of more than 50m RMB per month.


Given all of the above, I am not surprised to see DSKY failing to create games with similar
success as Temple Run, and I don't see how they can compete long term.


If DSKY really plans to grow why are they apparently not hiring English speaking
developers?


Most companies raising $100m from American investors do so in order to grow and
DSKY's current valuation certainly assumes future growth. With this in mind I am surprised
to see DSKY shows just three openings (which have been there for months) for English
speaking developers while the direct careers link on their page doesn't even work?


Kabaam Games, Gluu Mobile and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) all have lots of job postings,
with even the extremely questionable CMGE showing 50+ job openings on their website.


DSKY's American SEC Filings Don't Match Their Chinese SAIC Filings??


If you go and pull DSKY's historic Chinese SAIC filings you will find some interesting
questions are raised. I am struggling to explain this and am concerned as the only
explanations I have here are not good…..


In order to understand how DSKY cash flows work, below is my estimated DSKY VIE
structure analysis. It is not clear to me why DSKY requires so many subsidiaries and
strange looking shell structures.

An interesting exercise to attempt with any Chinese company is to go track down the
relevant local Chinese SAIC filings and legal docs for all the relevant subsidiaries, then
add up all the financial statements from the Chinese SAIC filings and compare them to US
SEC filings to see where they may match (or not). When I look at this for DSKY, some
"interesting" questions arise for me.


The first thing I note below is the revenue numbers I come up with for 2013 from Chinese
SAIC filings are approximately similar to DSKY's reported SEC filings. This gives me some
confidence that I have likely identified the relevant Chinese SAIC filings and am not
missing anything.


The two other things I notice though are very confusing. First, is that DSKY's reported
cash balances in 2012-2013 seem strange. Chinese SAIC filings indicate 2013 cash
balance of ~16.59m RMB while the US SEC filings show cash balance of ~179m RMB?!?
The second question that pops out at me are the differences in earnings, as the US SEC
filings appear to show materially higher profits?

I honestly am not sure how to explain these apparent issues?? I tried to call DSKY
repeatedly but it appears to be impossible to get someone from their internal IR on the
phone so I was not able to answer this question. I look forward to DSKY providing
whatever their explanation is so I can see if it is honest and credible.


DSKY Accounting Weaknesses and Deficiencies


During the IPO filing, DSKY highlighted two material weaknesses and other control
deficiencies. Despite these significant control deficiencies, DSKY was able to go public in
the US under the JOBS Act.


In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the two years
ended December 31, 2013, we identified two material weaknesses and other control
deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. A "material weakness" is
a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company's financial statements
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A control deficiency
exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or
detect misstatements on a timely basis. Effective internal control over financial reporting is
necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate
as a public company.


One of the material weaknesses identified relates to our lack of sufficient accounting
personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting
requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP technical accounting issues and

prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S.
GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. The other material weakness identified relates
to our lack of effective control procedures, including the lack of a comprehensive
accounting manual, to track, estimate and record the proceeds that we share with
our game developer partners and to assess the completeness and accuracy of the
related accruals on the proceeds sharing and withholding taxes.


Given the financial statement weaknesses and deficiencies, how can anyone trust their
numbers?!?


DSKY CFO Jun Zou's Dubious Background


CFO Jun Zou was hired by the company prior to the DSKY going public in August 2014.
However, Mr. Zou was also the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Board Secretary and VP
of Strategy of Chinese BAK Battery Inc (NASDAQ:CBAK) until 2010. In 2012, CBAK has
teetered on the edge of bankruptcy while facing serious allegations of problematic balance
sheet issues and accounting practices (here, here and here).


After CBAK, Mr. Zou went to Xunlei XNET. Mr. Zou was the CFO of XNET from 2010 to
2012. XNET tried to go public in 2011, but was apparently not able to gather enough
investor interest and so Mr. Zhou presumable left XNET after the failed IPO. XNET
appears to be an enabler of illegal movie downloads and copyright infringement, which
has been a disastrous investment.


When considering Mr. Zou's background in leading a company to the edge of bankruptcy
and then a company which allegedly facilitates illegal content, I am left feeling financially
queasy.


DSKY's Unfavorable Dual Class Share Structure: Removing Voting Control from
Shareholders


US investors should note that of the shares offered to investors, they are receiving heavily
disadvantage shares which seem to have close to zero voting rights with no real claim to
the underlying assets. Public investors, who hold A-shares, received 1 vote per share
versus 10 votes per share for insiders who hold the B-shares and, as a result, public
investors will hold 25% of outstanding shares, but less than 10% of the voting rights,
effectively giving public shareholders zero control or influence of their investment.

DSKY's IR Firm Known for Promoting Chinese Companies Which Wipe Investors

If DSKY is such an amazing opportunity where is the credible CFO? Why partner with an
IR firm like this? And why such a rush to IPO in the first place? Why not fix the glaring
financial control issues? I think these questions answer themselves.


DSKY: THE END IS HERE


As we can see below, DSKY business is already flattening out and about to enter
sequential decline. Given the lifespan of a Chinese casual phone game customer, this
reversal is likely to be fairly violent as this unfolds.

(pic credit charts from Piper Jaffray built with DSKY numbers)


The only hope of slowing down the decline I can see is for DSKY to quickly overpay for a
game company (remember Tencent's platform economics mean Tencent can economically
pay more than DSKY) which will only slow the near term DSKY decline and postpone the
inevitable, while leaving DSKY without whatever cash balance they actually have.
Depending on how much DSKY's overpays by, it may actually accelerate their demise.


I expect the Q2 numbers reported won't be too horrendous given DSKY gave guidance
deeply into the quarter already but there is just no hope for guidance (if DSKY is honest)
and the 2015 Q3 & Q4 numbers seem impossible.


There have been many game publisher/distributors in the past from 6waves to Chillingo,
and none of them have worked out well or lasted for any sustained period of time, I don't
see how DSKY will end up differently.


China Mobile DSKY Billing Disruption: Disastrous Timing for DSKY


Even worse for DSKY is China Mobile (the world's largest mobile phone carrier) has been
reported to have shut down billing in some provinces to crack down on illegal billing
practices by mobile games. This could not come at a worse time for DSKY who must try to
milk every last dollar they can from their remaining declining games before that revenue

goes $0. I estimate this alone could hit DSKY and Sky-mobi (NASDAQ:MOBI) by as much
as 10%+ of revenue in Q2/Q3 with spillover impact on partners Qihoo and Baidu
(NASDAQ:BIDU). Gamelook report appears to show some casual mobile game
companies experiencing daily revenue drops of 1/3.


DSKY Estimates Still Far Too High, DSKY In Terminal Decline


Given what we have seen above, it is clear DSKY is going to struggle in the near term and
CapIQ shows investor estimates for future revenue.


(pic credit CapIQ)


Coupled with the very short life of paying Chinese mobile game users, we can see growth
into 2016 will be essentially impossible and these estimates are clearly completely
unrealistic. If DSKY is flat lining and the Chinese mobile phone market is growing, that
means DSKY must be losing gobs of market share.


The estimates assume DSKY will constantly roll out hit games in China (which they have
shown they cannot do) and take market share away from competitors (they are actually
losing market share). With no hit games, I believe DSKY will consistently disappoint.
Guidance for this upcoming quarter looks potentially reasonable but as we move into Q3
and Q4 of this year, I expect more downgrades and guidance reductions.

Conclusion: DSKY = Walking Zombie (At Best)


DSKY's business model is malfunctioning and over time DSKY's market opportunity and
margins will contract as DSKY's relevance in the market shrinks into nothing. As DSKY's
business continues to unravel I believe DSKY has no choices. If DSKY were to just lie
about their financial results (I'm not saying they will), since all their products are customer
facing and can be verified with industry data and data scrapes, that could easily be
verified and presented to the SEC. This means DSKY has to report honest income
statement metrics, assuring the accuracy of the pending implosion.


Unappreciated is the negative feedback loop built into DSKY. I estimate about 1/4 of
DSKY current downloads are a product of DSKY's internal marketing on their old hit
games. As those games fall off, DSKY's ability to market any new games also disappears
and their whole business is likely to reverse in violent fashion.


I have been short DSKY for some time and SAIC filing discrepancies coupled with real-
time China app store data showing new games failing with shrinking legacy games, I think
the short thesis is timelier now than ever.
