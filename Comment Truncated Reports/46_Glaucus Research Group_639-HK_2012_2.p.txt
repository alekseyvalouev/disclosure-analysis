WHEN ONE FERARRI IS JUST NOT ENOUGH TO SAY I LOVE YOU 
 


The fall of Bo Xilai has brought the tension to a boil between wealthy oligarchs enriched by China’s swift rise and 


the hundreds of millions of disenfranchised have-nots that China’s rapid development has left behind.  Fueled by 


stories of excess, such as tales of Bo’s son flamboyantly partying abroad or ripping through Shanghai in a new 


Ferrari, the Bo scandal has galvanized China’s burgeoning netizens and inflamed popular sentiment.  Bo, formerly 


the Chongqing party chief and heir-apparent to China’s most powerful political posts, serves as a cautionary tale to 


any nouveau-riche corporate boss who shows off his wealth, especially if he gained such wealth at the expense of 


the Chinese people.   





Against a backdrop of simmering populist discontent, the excessive lifestyle of Xing LiBin (“Mr. Xing”), the man 


behind Shougang Fushan Resources Group Limited (HK: 0639) (“Fushan” or the “company”) has drawn negative 


attention.   





Fushan is a mining company that produces and sells coking coal and is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange 


(“HKEX”).  It owns and operates three coal mines in northern China (Shanxi Province).  Mr. Xing orchestrated the 


effective reverse merger that created the company in its current form, making himself and his cohort, former Fushan 


Chairman Wong Lik Ping (“Chairman Wong”), billions in the process.  





But tales of Mr. Xing’s profligate spending have stirred populist backlash.  According to reports, just a few weeks 


ago he threw a RMB 70 million wedding for his daughter.  The wedding embodies decline-of-Rome decadence at 


its best.  The guests, who included a number of celebrities, enjoyed some of China’s most famous pop groups and a 


fireworks show worthy of a Disney movie.  If you do not believe us, watch the video here. 





But the most excessive detail of the wedding, and what will surely enshrine Mr. Xing and his family on the frieze of 


greed’s Parthenon, was the 6-Ferrari dowry Mr. Xing reportedly gave to his son in law.

Such petulant displays of excessive wealth have unsurprisingly stirred not only resentment but a significant amount 


of negative attention into the origins of Mr. Xing’s fortune.  The rise of Fushan is an integral part of this story.   





On July 25, 2008, Fushan bought an 82% interest in three coal mines (the “3 Mines”), purchased from Fortune 


Dragon Group (“Fortune Dragon Group”), a company owned by Mr. Xing and Chairman Wong for $HK 10.5 


billion in cash and stock.  





On April 12, 2012, we published a report (available here) and a brief video (available here), in which we set forth 


evidence supporting our opinion that Fushan has intentionally misrepresented its business and financial position to 


investors.  Specifically, we believe that Mr. Xing and his associates made a fortune at the expense of shareholders 


when Fushan overpaid, using money raised from investors, for three old and provincial mines that it purchased from 


Mr. Xing’s Fortune Dragon Group.    





We also believe that after the acquisition, Fushan misrepresented its financial performance to investors, potentially 


by using related party transactions with Mr. Xing and other insiders to manipulate its margins.  This allowed insiders 


to cash out at fabulous prices.  Mr. Xing and Chairman Wong each sold the vast majority of their respective 


company shares within 18 months of the acquisition as Fushan’s stock soared on the strength of suspiciously high 


margins.  Chairman Wong grossed an estimated HK$ 4.5 billion and Mr. Xing grossed an estimated HK$ 4 billion.  


In response to our report, the company issued a Clarification Announcement.

In this response piece, we present new evidence buttressing our opinion that Fushan has repeatedly violated 


securities laws and evidence rebutting the company’s tepid response.   We believe that:  





1. Fushan’s Coal is Not as Special as Fushan Claims.  Fushan’s defense to our allegation that its margins 
are fabricated is that the company mines “panda coal”, which Fushan claims to sell for high prices because 


of its exceptional quality.  However, in this piece we present new evidence showing that in 2007, prior to 


going public, Fushan sold its supposedly special coal for relatively cheap prices (below RMB 350/t).  Then, 


as soon as its mines went public in 2008, Fushan sold the same coal to related parties for nearly three times 


the average price that it sold to such customers in 2007 (when the mines were private).  This supports 


our opinion that the company is overstating the quality of its coal and using transactions with related parties 


to manipulate its margins.   
 


2. Fushan’s dubious relationship status.  In response to our contention that Fushan is manipulating its 
margins through undisclosed related party transactions with Mr. Xing and his associates, the company 


scrambled to tell investors that since 2009 it had essentially stopped doing business with Mr. Xing.  We 


disagree. 





a. As recently as December 2010, based on recommendations from management, Fushan’s board 
authorized RMB 9 billion of related party transactions for the period from 2011 to 2013 with 


Mr. Xing and his associates.  


b. These transaction caps permit Fushan to sell coal to Mr. Xing at 100% to 150% premiums to the 
prices Fushan that discloses to investors in its annual report. 


c. In 2008, Fushan sold raw coal to Mr. Xing for high prices and bought raw coal from Mr. Xing for 
low prices.   


d. According to Fushan’s public filings, Mr. Xing’s conglomerate bought raw coking coal from 
Fushan at 72% above the price paid by other customers in 2008. 





3. Overpayment for Acquisitions from Insiders.  A recent Chinese news story set forth evidence that Mr. 
Xing was able to acquire the Xingwu mine (one of the three mines now owned by Fushan) for a cash 


payment of only RMB 80 million, a bargain-basement price that supports the notion that  Fushan’s mines 


are not worth as much as the company claims.  Further, in response to our previous report, Fushan 


presented a misleading and gimmicky purchase price calculation in an attempt to show that the company 


did not overpay for the 3 Mines.

A BLACK BEAR PAINTED WITH WHITE SPOTS IS NOT A PANDA 





Glaucus Claim:  In our original report, we argued that Fushan’s EBITDA margins are fabricated because they are 


head and shoulders above those of its domestic and international peers.  We suspect that Fushan has been 


manipulating its margins by selling its coal at a premium price to related parties.   





Fushan Response: The company explains its suspicious margin-advantage by saying that it sells “premium coking 


coal which is of relatively higher market value than other types of coal.” The company states that all of its dubious 


figures can be explained away because it sells what it calls ‘Panda Coal,’ which despite being a commodity, is 


supposedly significantly better than other coal.  We think that this explanation is a joke.   





According to Fushan’s Acquisition Prospectus, the average selling price (“ASP”) for coal from Fushan’s mines in 


2007, the year prior to going public, was less than RMB 350 per tonne.  This is nowhere near the high ASP that 


Fushan has reported since it took its mines public.  





More importantly, the transaction history of Fushan’s mines show that related parties only started paying a high 


price for this allegedly special coal in 2008, the first year the mines were part of a public company.  This 


suggests that rather than mining ‘special’ coal, the company is simply using invoices from related parties to fabricate 


its financials.   





In the table below we present data from Fushan’s public filings showing the transactions with related parties Mr. 


Xing and Director Shi in 2007 and 2008.  Recall that Mr. Xing sold the 3 Mines to Fushan in 2008 for HK$ 10.5 


billion.  Both Mr. Xing and Director Shi are Shanxi area coal bosses with private coal mining companies which buy 


coal directly from Fushan.  Luckily for us, the company’s filings allow investors to compare the prices that Mr. Xing 


and Director Shi paid for Fushan’s coal before and after Fushan took its mines public.

* Annualized Figures
 





If Fushan’s coal was really so special, then investors should expect that its customers would pay the same high price 


for its coal when the mines were private as they did when the mines were public.  But if you believe, as we do, that 


Fushan is simply fabricating its margins, then we would expect that after the 3 Mines went public, related parties 


would all of a sudden start ‘paying’ a much higher price for the same coal.  The reason is simple: after the mines 


went public, insiders had a huge incentive to lie about the performance of the company in order to sell their 


shares in the open market at high prices.   





The data provided by the company supports exactly what we believe and undermines any argument by the company 


that its suspicious margins can be explained by the quality of its coal.  It is even more damning when compared to 


the differences paid by non-related parties from 2007 to 2008.

The evidence is indisputable.  Mr. Xing and Director Shi paid an average of ¥330 per tonne of coal when the 3 


Mines were private, but when the 3 Mines were public, the same related parties purportedly paid an average of ¥897 


per tonne for the same coal from the same mines.  If Fushan’s ‘panda’ coal were really as special as the company 


claims, such coal should have yielded much higher ASPs in the year before the 3 Mines went public.  





The most important detail to remember is that within 18 months of the 3 Mines acquisition, Mr. Xing and Chairman 


Wong dumped almost all of their stock in Fushan, with Mr. Xing grossing an estimated HK$ 4.0 billion and 


Chairman Wong grossing an estimated HK$ 4.5 billion.
4
  Insiders clearly had an enormous incentive to drive up the 


price of Fushan’s stock.   





To bolster the case that Fushan has been using coal sales to related parties to manipulate their margins, the average 


sales price to non-related party customers only increased 53% from 2007 to 2008, whereas the price purportedly 


paid by related parties skyrocketed 172%.  In addition, as shown on the graph below, the average monthly coal 


volumes sold to Mr. Xing and Director Shi rose more than 400% after the 3 Mines went public.

As soon as Mr. Xing and other insiders had an enormous economic interest in Fushan’s share price, Mr. Xing and 


Director Shi started ‘buying’ far more coal from Fushan at far greater prices than they did when the 3 Mines 


were private.  This strongly suggests that Fushan’s profitability is driven not by the uniqueness of its ‘Panda Coal’ 


but by inflating sales to related parties.     





Fushan Sells a Commodity at Prices Immune to Market Forces 





If we are right, then Fushan’s ASPs should go up when market prices for its coal and its competitor’s ASPs go down 


(or stay flat).  Lo and behold, in a DBS Vickers sell-side report from April 13, 2012, an analyst compared the 


average sale price of Fushan’s clean coal against Hidili and the spot market prices for Liulin #4 and Liulin #9 coal 


(the types of coal that Fushan claims to sell).   





The following charts and accompanying graph, built with data from the DBS Vickers report, show that Fushan’s 


ASPs are apparently immune to market conditions: despite the fact that the market prices decline in 2009 (Hidili’s 


ASPs behave as we would expect), Fushan’s ASPs continue to magically rise.

As the graph shows, Fushan’s ASPs defy the conventions of market economics: when the spot price for its 


commodity fell and competitors reduced prices for sales, Fushan inexplicably raised its average sales prices.

WHAT IS FUSHAN’S RELATIONSHIP STATUS WITH MR. XING? 





In this section, we discuss what we believe to be the rotten core of Fushan: undisclosed related party transactions 


with Mr. Xing and his associates, and management’s attempt to cover up this relationship in response to our 


allegations.   





Glaucus Claim:  We believe Fushan’s EBITDA margins are fabricated because they are head and shoulders 


above those of its domestic and international peers and they display Madoffian consistency.  In the graph below, we 


compare Fushan’s EBITDA margins with those of other Chinese metallurgic coal miners, three of which are based 


in the same province (Puda, Shanxi Xishan and Shanxi Lu’an).  





CHINESE METALLURGIC COAL COMPS (EBITDA MARGINS)

In response to our allegations, the company scrambled to tell investors that it since 2009 it had essentially stopped 


doing business with Mr. Xing and his associates.  Specifically, Fushan stated that transactions with Mr. Xing 


represented “approximately 0.15% of the total sales and approximately 0.80% of the cost of sales of the Company 


for the financial year ended 31 December 2011.”  The company reports the following figures for transactions with 


Mr. Xing from 2008-2011:

Reported Transaction Amounts with Mr. Xing





We believe these reported figures vastly understate the volume of Fushan’s actual transactions with Mr. Xing.  Five 


facts support our contention that Fushan continues to do business with Mr. Xing and that such dealings could 


explain the vast superiority of Fushan’s EBITDA margins vis-à-vis its competitors:  





(1) As recently as December 2010, Fushan’s board authorized RMB 9 billion of related party transactions for 
2011-2013 with Mr. Xing and his associates.   





(2) These transaction caps permit Fushan to sell coal to Mr. Xing at 100% to 150% premiums to the prices 
Fushan discloses to investors in its annual report. 





(3) In 2008, Fushan sold raw coal to Mr. Xing for high prices and bought raw coal from Mr. Xing for low 
prices.   





(4) According to Fushan’s public filings, Mr. Xing’s conglomerate bought raw coking coal from Fushan at 
72% above the price paid by other customers in 2008. 





(5) The company engaged in the same suspicious transactions with Director Shi, another related party and local 
coal boss with competing mines in the area.  





Due to a loophole in Hong Kong securities regulations, a public company's auditor is not required to disclose the 


amounts and prices of related party transactions as long as 1) they occurred in accordance with previously stated 


pricing policies of the firm, and 2) the transactions did not exceed the related party caps set out by the board. We 


believe that Fushan uses a combination of Chaoda-like pricing mechanisms together with massive transaction caps 


with related parties in order to hide the details of its related party transactions from shareholders and regulators.
10 





FACT #1: As recently as December 2010, Fushan’s board authorized RMB 9 billion of related party transactions 


for 2011-2013 with Mr. Xing and his associates.  The board’s decision was based on the recommendations of 


Fushan’s management team regarding the amount of expected future business with Mr. Xing.  If the company had 


truly stopped doing business with Mr. Xing in 2009, why in November 2010 would management ask the board to 


expressly permit Fushan to do a massive amount of business with Mr. Xing from 2011-2013?  





On November 4, 2008, the company entered into a Revised Supply Contract with Mr. Xing.  According to the 


accompanying filing, Fushan entered into the revised contract to permit the company to do more business with Mr. 


Xing.  Fushan’s board of directors stated at the time that it had reason to “expect that approximately 30% of the 


expected raw coking coal output and 30% of the expected purchase of raw coking coal of the Mining Companies 


will be sold to or purchased from Mr. Xing’s Companies respectively for the three years ending 31 December 


2010.”
7
 





On November 12, 2010, Fushan renewed this contract for another three years, permitting the company to buy and 


sell raw coal to Mr. Xing and purchase other supplies from Mr. Xing and his conglomerate.  On December 1, 2010, 


Fushan’s board of directors set forth the following caps for sales and purchases between the company and Mr. Xing 


and his associates:
8
 





RMB 2011 2012 2013 Total


Cap Amounts for Sales of Raw Coal to Mr. 


Xing
1,120,000,000 1,210,000,000 1,310,000,000

Nov 2010 Master Agreement with Mr. Xing





So what do the annual caps mean? According to Fushan’s filings:  





We understand from the management of the Group that the determination of the Annual Caps in 


respect of the Sales have taken into account the expected sales amount of (i) clean coal; (ii) raw 


coal; (iii) accessories and plant and machinery; and (iv) electricity by the Group to Mr. Xing and 


his associates, whereas the Annual Caps in respect of the Purchases have taken into the account 


the expected purchase or procurement amount of (i) clean coal for trading; (ii) raw coal and 


byproduct coal for producing clean coal; (iii) accessories and plant and machinery; (iv) 


construction services; and (v) rental services by the Group from Mr. Xing and/or his associates. 





These annual caps are staggering.  If Fushan was done doing business with Mr. Xing and his associates in 2009, 


why in December 2010 did its management team expect to do almost RMB 9 BILLION in transactions over 


the next three years with Mr. Xing and his associates?  





Why Transaction Caps Matter more than Reported Transactions 





We believe that Fushan’s board authorizes such high caps on transactions with Mr. Xing and his associates so that 


Fushan can hide the details of such transactions from the marketplace.   





Under Hong Kong Securities Rule 14A.38, each year a company’s auditor must provide a letter to the exchange and

As such, Fushan’s auditor only has a duty to verify and disclose that transactions with Mr. Xing have not exceeded 


the caps and were conducted at prices consistent with the practices of the company (more on this below).   





In 2008, the company was compelled to report that it had exceeded its caps on related party business with Mr. 


Xing and his associates.  Not only was the company compelled to file a mea culpa, but it had to disclose, for the 


first and only time, to our knowledge, the details of its related party transactions (price and volume) etc… Investors 


could see from the company’s filings that Fushan was selling coal to Mr. Xing at a 72% premium over coal sold  to 


other customers.  Obviously, this creates the presumption that Fushan was using related party invoices to boost its 


financial performance.
9
  





This could explain why after such an embarrassing disclosure, Fushan’s board has set the transaction caps so high.  


It never wanted again to disclose to shareholders the details of its transactions with Mr. Xing.  After all, under HK 


rules, if a company never exceeds its caps, the auditor can simply bless the related party dealings and the company 


does not have a duty to tell shareholders the prices of its insider transactions.  In other words, if your goal was to 


hide related party dealings, just have huge caps! 





The Relative Size of the Transaction Caps is Staggering 





To put this in perspective, below we have charted Fushan’s anticipated transactions with Mr. Xing as a % of COGS 


and sales in the following fiscal years.

Mr. Xing Expected Supplies as a % of COGS 96% 118% 95% 102%


* Using an Approximation of Exchange Rates duing the Period


Why are Fushan's COGS so low? Supplier Transaction Caps with Mr. Xing?





These figures make a mockery of Fushan’s pleas of innocence that after 2009 it did not do significant business with 


Mr. Xing.  Fushan’s board authorized the company, based on management’s recommendations of the expected 


transaction volume with Mr. Xing, to purchase a virtually limitless amount of raw coal and other supplies from Mr. 


Xing and his associates which roughly exceeded the company’s COGS from 2009-2011.   





A table comparing the authorized caps for sales to Mr. Xing and his associates to Fushan’s overall sales tells a 


similar story:

Again, investors should remember the origin of these caps: they are based on management’s estimate of how much 


business Fushan will do with Mr. Xing and his associates.  To put it another way, on December 1, 2010, 


management anticipated in 2011 that Fushan would purchase an amount equal to 95% of its 2011 COGS from Mr. 


Xing and his associates and sell an amount of raw coal equal to 19% of its total 2011 sales to Mr. Xing and his 


associates.   





Doing More Business with Mr. Xing, not Less! 





The company protests that it was winding down business with Mr. Xing circa 2009, but, as any investor can see, this 


statement is completely misleading.  The following chart shows the caps with Mr. Xing for total transaction volume 


from 2009-2013.
12











The chart shows that the company anticipates purchasing far more of its inputs from Mr. Xing and his associates 


going forward.  We believe that such related party transactions can explain Fushan’s suspiciously amazing margins.

FACT #2: Fushan’s board-approved transaction caps allow Fushan to sell coal to Mr. Xing and another related party (Director Shi) at a premium to the 


market price, giving the company the opportunity to artificially boost its margins through fake invoices for related party transactions.   





The following table sets forth the caps (for tonnage and RMB purchase price) for the sales of coal to Mr. Xing and Director Shi.  Notice that it permits the 


company to sell to both related parties at prices far above the company’s reported average sales price for coal from its mines.

Recall that the transaction caps represent management’s expectations of the amount of coal (and price of coal) that 


management anticipates Fushan will sell to both related parties.  We think it is crucial for investors to note that such 


caps permit the company to sell coal to Mr. Xing and Director Shi at a premium to other customers.  





A savvy investor might object to this point on the grounds that, pursuant to Hong Kong securities rules, the 


company’s auditor must verify that related party transactions are conducted in accordance with “the pricing policies 


of the listed issuer.”
14


  The counterargument is that even if the caps permit Fushan to sell to Mr. Xing and Director 


Shi at a premium, such sales must still be made at prices near those charged to other customers.   





We disagree because of the structure of the coal sales contract between Mr. Xing and Fushan, which we have 


excerpted here:  





The basis of determining the prices for the Continuing Connected Transactions will be in 


accordance with (i) comparable market price; or (ii) if no comparable market price can be taken as 


a reference, a price reasonably agreed between the parties, where the price should be no less 


favorable to/from third parties.
15








Anonymous Analytics exposed Chaoda Modern Agriculture (HK: 0682) (“Chaoda”) for a similar contractual 


provision.  Anonymous alleged that Chaoda was cooking its books because the price for related party transactions 


could be easily manipulated: all the company had to do was to find some other purportedly independent third party 


to buy/sell goods at the desired price, and then the price from such “independent party” could be used to justify 


whatever price Chaoda wanted to charge related parties.   





We suspect that Fushan uses this contractual provision to sell (or at least invoice) coal to Mr. Xing and Director Shi 


at a premium to other customers, thus artificially boosting its margins and juicing its stock price.  Why? Because it 


appears from the company’s filings that they did so in the past…

FACT #3: In 2008, just prior to the time when Mr. Wong and Mr. Xing dumped their shares, Fushan bought raw 


coal from Mr. Xing at low prices and sold raw coal to Mr. Xing at high prices. It appears to be an example of raw 


coal arbitrage using a related party to manipulate the company’s margins.    





How does an arbitrage scam work? A company sells a commodity or product to a related party at a high price, then 


buys the same commodity from a related party at a low price, thus making the company’s margins look other-


worldly. When the stock price goes up, insiders dump their shares.   





In 2008, Fushan sold raw coal to Mr. Xing for a price 77% higher than the price at which the company bought raw 


coal from Mr. Xing.

The above chart shows that Fushan bought raw coal from Mr. Xing at a low price and then sold raw coal to 


Mr. Xing at a high price.   





Consider that the company only disclosed the above data (and only for a three month period) because it had to on 


account of the fact that it violated its transaction caps on its dealings with Mr. Xing.  Because the company did not 


violate its caps again, we do not have any more data on potential arbitrage of raw coal between Mr. Xing and 


Fushan.  At the very least the data summarized above creates a presumption that Fushan engages in coal arbitrage 


with related parties, and such transactions could easily be used to manipulate its margins.    





The primary contention of our report is that Fushan’s margins are so far superior to other coal mining companies 


that they defy credibility.  In short, such performance in a commodity business appears too good to be true.  Coupled 


with the fact that insiders like Mr. Xing and Chairman Wong sold out of the majority of their shares when the price 


of Fushan’s shares soared on the wings of its margins, and it does not take a rocket scientist to suspect a pump and 


dump scheme.

Fushan at 72% above the price paid by other customers.

In 2008, it appears that Mr. Xing’s related party premium for a 3-month period singlehandedly boosted Fushan's 


2008 sales and pre-tax net income by 10% and 21%, respectively.  Mr. Xing’s decision to buy raw coal from Fushan 


at a hefty premium came immediately after the reverse merger and just prior to the time when Mr. Xing and 


Chairman Wong dumped virtually all their shares.   We think it is unlikely that Mr. Xing would ever buy raw coking 


coal from a third party for a 72% premium given that he owns 12 coal mines in the same area, 8 of which are within 


15 miles of Fushan's operations. 





It is also worth noting that we included this argument in our original report, and Fushan made no attempt to rebut 


or explain the fact that it sold to Mr. Xing at a significant premium to its other customers.
17 





FACT #5: It appears that the company engaged in the same suspicious transactions with Director Shi, another related party and local coal boss with competing 


mines in the area.  According to company filings, just three months after the 3 Mines acquisition, Director Shi's expected coal purchases from Fushan 


increased by 2600%, comprised of a 650% anticipated increase in volume and, depending on the mine, between 100% and 300% anticipated increase in sales 


price.

According to the company’s filings, Fushan sold more coal to Mr. Shi after he became a related party than before he joined the board.  More disturbingly for 


Fushan’s shareholders, it appears from the company’s filings that Mr. Shi paid more for the same coal after becoming a related party.

FUSHAN OVERPAYS FOR THE ACQUISTION OF THE 3 MINES 





Recently, Chinese media has reported a story (available here) corroborating our allegation that the 3 Mines were not 


worth as much as Fushan and Mr. Xing would have shareholders believe.  The story claims that in 2002, the Xingwu 


coal mine (“Xingwu”) (one of the 3 Mines now owned by Fushan) was losing money and was selling coal for ASPs 


of between RMB 100 and RMB 167 per ton.  As a result, the story alleges that Mr. Xing was able to acquire the 


Xingwu mine for only RMB 80 million in cash (he also assumed RMB 100 million in debt), a bargain-basement 


price that supports the notion that the mine is not worth as much as Fushan’s claims it to be and that Mr. Xing 


defrauded Fushan’s shareholders when the company paid over $HK 10.5 billion for the 3 Mines (Xingwu plus two 


other coal mines) in 2008.   





Glaucus Claim:  In our original report, we presented comparable acquisition data which showed that Fushan 


significantly overpaid for the 3 Mines.  By our calculations, Fushan acquired the mines for RMB 97 per tonne of 


the stated coal reserves, when its competitors acquired other similarly-sized, primary-coking coal mines (in the same 


or neighboring province) for between RMB 11 and RMB 16 per tonne of reserves. This indicates that Fushan 


overpaid by roughly HK$ 8 billion. 





Fushan Response: The company protested that it did not overpay, rather that it acquired the 3 Mines for 


approximately RMB 42 per tonne of reserves.  So how much did Fushan pay for the 3 Mines as a multiple of 


reserves, RMB 97 per tonne as Glaucus alleges or RMB 42 per tonne as the company alleges?  Keep in mind that 


this is not merely a dispute between two bankers about a calculation: it goes to the very heart of whether Mr. Xing 


illicitly enriched himself and his cronies at the expense of shareholders.   





In our report, we provided a detailed appendix showing how we calculated our figure of RMB 97 per tonne.  We can 


only speculate as to how Fushan arrived at RMB 42 per tonne, but in our opinion, Fushan could have only reached 


such a conclusion by using a number of accounting gimmicks.   





Estimate of Reserves 





The first dispute concerns the amount of reserves at the 3 Mines at the time of the acquisition:  





 Fushan Glaucus 


Reserve Estimate 200 mm tonnes 142 mm tonnes 





The difference between the company’s reserves estimate and our estimate of reserves is that Glaucus counted only 


recoverable reserves, whereas the company included unrecoverable reserves in its analysis.  We believe that the 


company’s reserve estimate is not only incorrect (obviously so), but shows that the company is attempting to cover 


up the true purchase price of the 3 Mines.   





On the next page, we provide direct excerpts from Fushan’s Acquisition Prospectus showing that the 3 Mines only 


contained 142 mm tonnes of recoverable reserves at the time of acquisition.

Accounting Gimmick #1:


Fushan


erroneously


uses larger reserve estimate


to make acquisition 


price appear 


smaller


again, recoverable reserves are what matter


Source: Acquisition prospectus, page VII-6, Valuation Report with reference to BOYD Technical Report.


 - The Acquisition Prospectus clearly distinguishes between ‘recoverable’ and ‘unrecoverable’ reserves.

"principal assets" according to Chinese methodology


ONLY inlcude RECOVERABLE reserves

We think that the above excerpts from Fushan’s Acquisition Prospectus are conclusive.  Judged by the company’s 


own public filings, Fushan overestimated the amount of reserves at the 3 Mines in its purchase price calculation in 


order to make it appear as if the company did not overpay for the acquisition.  But this is not the only gimmick used 


by the company and sell side analysts in trying to rebut our report.  





Enterprise Value Calculation 





In the chart below, we have attempted to recreate Fushan’s calculation. In order to arrive at a figure of 42 


RMB/tonne, we had to use several accounting gimmicks to artificially lower the purchase price of the mines.   





Fushan Glaucus Comments


Equity Purchase Price (mms) HK$10,530 HK$10,530


Sale Loan (i) (158) 0


Glaucus properly ignores intercompany loans for 


valuation purposes.


Sale Loan (ii) (236) 0


We believe the company improperly reduces the 


purchase price by these amounts.


Sale Loan (iii) (741) 0


HK$9,395 HK$10,530


Equity Value After 


Currency Conversion to 


RMB(mms) ¥8,439 ¥9,458


% of the 3 Mines Acquired 


by Fushan 82%


We believe the company improperly takes the 


purchase price for 82% of the mines divided by 100% 


of mine reserves.


Equity Value - adjusted to 


100% ¥11,574


Glaucus grosses up the  purchase price to  reflect the 


remaining minority  interest


Debt acquired per 


valuation report (mms)


¥2,234


Fushan's own Valuation Report adds back the net 


liabilities of the mines assumed by Fushan to arrive at 


enterprise value.  We believe that the company 


chooses not to count net liabilities assumed when 


quoting the purchase price to investors.


Enterprise Value (mms) ¥8,439 ¥13,808


Reserves (tonnes mms) 205.75 142.35


Fushan's reserve figures include unrecoverable 


reserves (see previous page)


TEV/Reserves 41.0x 97.0x


Fushan's gimmicky calculation fails to capture the 


true purchase price of the 3 Mines transaction.





We believe that Fushan’s calculation contains four basic errors: (1) it subtracts intercompany loans from the 


purchase price even though we believe that such loans are effectively intercompany receivables and thus have no 


real value, (2) it does not account for the percentage of the mines actually acquired by the company (82%), (3) it 


does not add back net liabilities assumed by the company as part of the acquisition to the enterprise value of the 3 


Mines and (4) its estimate of reserves includes non-recoverable reserves (as discussed above).
21 








Fushan’s calculation is amateurish and self-serving.   It ignores basic Wall Street conventions for calculating 


enterprise value, to the point where the company’s calculation seems like a dirty trick to convince investors that 


Fushan did not unjustly enrich insiders at the expense of shareholders in acquiring the 3 Mines. 





Why does this matter?  





A casual shareholder may ask: what’s the big deal? So you disagree with the company on how to calculate the 


purchase price of an acquisition made in 2008? How does that affect my investment?  





As discussed in detail in our report, we retained an independent consultant, China Coal Resources, to provide data 


on acquisitions of other private coal mines in the same geographic region and during months leading up to the 


announcement of the Fushan acquisition.  





China Coal Resources provided comparable acquisition data showing that Fushan’s competitors acquired other 


similarly-sized, primary-coking coal mines (in the same or neighboring province) for between RMB 11 and RMB 


16 per tonne of reserves, whereas Fushan acquired the 3 Mines for RMB 97 per tonne of the stated coal reserves. 





Not to belabor the obvious, but buying a coal mine from insiders at above market value using funds raised from 


shareholders unjustly enriches such insiders at the expense of the company’s investors. In layman’s terms, if Fushan 


significantly overpaid for the 3 Mines, it strongly suggests that Mr. Xing and his cohorts defrauded shareholders.
