Valeant: Could this be the Pharmaceutical Enron? 
 


Citron Publishes the Smoking Gun!! 
Price Target lowered to $50 





Just four days ago in the world of Valeant, no one had ever heard of Philidor RX.  
Recent concerns about the company focused on its unsavory business practice of 
massive price raises on pharmaceuticals acquired in a rapid succession of 
acquisitions, while slashing research and development.  But no one had discussed 
how these drugs were distributed….until this week. 
 


On Monday morning before earnings, a report came out of SIRF, uncovering 
undisclosed relationships with specialty pharmas, namely Philidor RX.  Most 
importantly, the article introduced Wall Street to a court filing made by a 
company called R&O Pharmacy, filed with the California District Court in 
September, in which this small regional pharmacy claims it had received an 
improper demand for payment from Valeant to the tune of $69 million.  
 


Just yesterday, the New York Times increased its scrutiny on Philidor by 
questioning if its operation was the target of subpoenas recently served on 
Valeant over its pricing strategy, covered the prior week.  
 


This is Not Where the Story Ends; it is Where the Story Begins 
 
With its quarterly earnings report scheduled for first thing Monday morning, 
Valeant was well aware of the scrutiny that was about to come down on Philidor 
and the R&O lawsuit, as both SIRF and the NY Times had contacted management.  
Valeant came prepared for the conference call with pre-written questions and 
answers -- one about Philador, and one about R&O (below) -- in its slide deck.   
This is where the cover up begins.   
 


We will let the New York Times start:

The Big Coverup 


“Valeant had said little about Philidor until Monday, when J. Michael 
Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, revealed on his company’s quarterly 
earnings call that Valeant had purchased an option to acquire Philidor late 
last year. He said that Valeant consolidated Philidor’s results in its own 
financial reports.” 


 
An option?  To acquire a company to which you are the only customer?  Why 
would Valeant, a major big cap pharma, a darling of the hedge fund crowd, a 
suitor of Allergan and an aggressive acquirer of pharmas like Salix, Bausch & 
Lomb, etc., etc., be secretly maneuvering to buy a little known pharmacy with a 
concealed ownership structure? And then consolidate its financials?  Why was 
this entity NEVER disclosed in any prior company disclosure?  (See Valeant Slides 
on Philador here.)  
 


What is being covered up?? 
 


In the same slide presentation we read Valeant's explanation of a mysterious 
court document. R&O Pharmacy filed for pre-emptive relief in California District 
Court for having received a demand for $69 million from Valeant, stating it had no 
invoices from Valeant.  Valeant's explanation was this one slide: 


 
So we are to believe that Valeant putatively owns Philidor and is acting as its 
"protector” in sending the demand letter to R&O for payment?  The story seemed

a bit far-fetched, but it was somewhat plausible if you wanted to suspend all 
disbelief.  
 


But after a fair amount of due diligence Citron is about to post the line that should 
send alarm through all Valeant shareholders: 
 


Philidor Owns R&O Pharmacy.   
 


Citron believes the whole thing is a fraud to create invoices to deceive the 
auditors and book revenue.  PHANTOM ACCOUNTS.  Here is the reasoning. 
 


The Smoking Gun!! 
 


From the links below, it is obvious that Philidor and R&O are ARE THE SAME 
COMPANY AND SHARE MANAGEMENT.  The two companies have the same 
patient privacy disclosure, in fact formatted identically, on both companies' 
websites.  Note the R&O website refers to themselves as Philidor.

And look!  The pharmacies -- R&O, in Camarillo California, and Philidor RX in Horsham PA, 


have the identical toll free number to reach their Privacy Officer (at the bottom.)  
Now that's some service!

If you dial the fax # on the R&O website and press 1, you will get 
Philidor RX.  It does not stop at an R&O phone.

And as if this isn't enough, it appears to Citron that Valeant/Philidor have created 
an entire network of phantom captive pharmacies ...  the same privacy notice 
appears on several other "ghost ship" putative pharmacy websites.

Oh, and as by mere coincidence, these all have the same Privacy Officer contact 
phone number:   (855) 815-7688.  And these domains were all registered on the 
same day!  [ Click Here to See them all ]  
 


It is apparent to Citron that Valeant has created a network of “pharmacies” as 
clones of Philidor.  Why do these exist?   Citron believes it is merely for the 
purpose of  phantom sales or stuff the channel, and avoid scrutiny from the 
auditors.   
 


How Can This Be, Citron ?  Doesn’t the Head of the Audit 
Committee have Any Responsibility Here? 
 
Let us not forget that the head of the Valeant audit committee is Norma 
Provencio.  Mrs. Provencio herself was a director of Signalife which was run by 
now convicted stock fraudster Mitchell Stein. She was in fact his close associate 
for years -- information now conveniently omitted from her biography.  Mrs. 
Provencio’s integrity was first challenged by Bronte Capital in this posting you 
should read for yourself.  Now the relevance of its full context becomes clear.  
 


Is this Enron part Deux?? 
 


These similarities are too close to ignore.  Does everyone remember during the 
Allergan takeover battle, when Allergan chose the words “house of cards” ?  Look 
at the following similarities between statements by Valeant and those of Enron:

Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, phone call with Fortune, 2/14/2001: "It is unfair to us and 
unethical if you don't take the time to understand our business... we are doing it 
purely right... people who raise questions are people who have not gone through 
our business in detail..." 


vs. 
Valeant Chairman, CEO Michael Pearson, investor presentation, 5/28/2014: "So 
again, it is unfortunate that Allergan has not taken the time to understand our 
business... There is a number of inaccuracies in the report that was put out 
yesterday... They are just factually incorrect..." 


Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, phone call with Fortune, 2/14/2001: "[Enron] is a very 
simple model... it is a logistics company, not a trading company." 


vs. 
Valeant Chairman, CEO Michael Pearson, Sanford Bernstein conference, 
5/28/2014: "[Valeant] is more like a professional services firm than a sort of 
traditional pharmaceutical company." 
 


Enron CFO Andy Fastow, meeting with Fortune, 2/15/2001: "[Enron's] disclosure 
is more complete than anyone's." 


vs. 
Bill Ackman, conference call hosted by Pershing Square, 7/17/2014: "I will also 
point out that Valeant gives massively more disclosure about its business and did 
so prior to this transaction than Allergan." 
 


Enron Chairman, Ken Lay, email to employees August 2001: "I have never felt 
better about the prospects of the Company... our growth has never been more

Citron has seen this movie before.  In 2008, Arthrocare, a successful medical 
device company, was doing its dirty deeds through Discocare, an undisclosed 
captive "independent company".  When Citron exposed the relationship, 
Arthrocare tried to make it all go away by announcing it was buying Discocare.  
At the time, virtually every investment banking house on the Street had a "buy" or 
"strong buy" on Arthrocare, and Goldman-Sachs had been engaged to "explore 
strategic alternatives".  The entire thing began to unravel when Citron discovered 
-- and published -- that Arthrocare and Discocare -- ostensibly separate 
companies, had the same fax number. 
 
The CEO of Arthrocare is now doing 20 years. 
 


While it is impossible for Citron to state for certain at this point, this has the 
distinct aroma of product being jammed into a channel.  It had to have started 
small, and now it's just too big.  "We have an option to purchase Philidor"  is 
simply ... trying to put the genie back in the bottle.   
 


  Conclusion   
 


All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is 
to discover them……Galileo Galilei 
 
Citron Research has delivered the proof that something really stinks at Valeant 
and it is goes beyond their egregious price hikes

The Big Coverup 





All of a sudden, one thread unravels this whole web of deception. From the 
moment of the first public mention of Philidor, within 72 hours, Valeant is now 
holding an option to acquire Philidor and investors find out only in retrospect that 
Valeant has been consolidating Philador financials?  
 


Let's get the explanation -- Certainly Mr. Lay and Skilling had one all the way down 
to the trial -- and in which they still blamed the short sellers.
