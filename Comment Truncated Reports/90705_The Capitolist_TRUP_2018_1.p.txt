Summary


Top Idea Short Ideas Financials


TRUP


Trupanion is a pet insurance company that offers policy holders (or beneficiaries)
catastrophic coverage for their domestic pets (cats and dogs only).


The sales funnel is spearheaded by the Territory Partners who generate referrals
for Trupanion insurance and, therefore, must be licensed if their compensation is
dependent on the sale of insurance.


100% of Territory Partner and Veterinarian compensation is dependent on the
successful sale of insurance, but virtually none of them are licensed.


The Analysts covering the stock have no background in Insurance and have
pushed a valuation that's well in excess of the peer universe.


Regulatory action seems likely, and the result could be very high churn in Territory
Partners, the resulting stall in growth could cause 75% downside in the stock.

[Update 8/20/2018: Please see the company's response at the end of the article.]


[Update 8/21/2018: For further updates please see this article.]


Trupanion is an insurance company that the market is pricing as a tech innovator. The
market is, therefore, failing to properly value the company relative to its book value and
the regulatory risks it faces. I submit that Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) is worth no more
than 3x book value, which implies a ~$330M market cap and a share price of roughly
~$10/share. 3x book value gives the company ample credit for growth as its peer
universe of HC insurance companies trade at 1.8x book value. However, all the
companies in that peer universe generate massive amounts of free cash flow so there
may be an argument for a lower price considering the lack of free cash flow produced by
TRUP.


Trupanion is an insurance company that offers policy holders coverage for catastrophic
care for their dogs and cats. The company uses the insurance business to build out
users of its veterinarian billing software solution "Trupanion Express". It has shown
impressive revenue growth over the past five years, more than doubling from 2014 to
2017. That kind of growth can lead executives to push too hard and fly a bit too high in
order to keep up with the expectations of Wall St. In the case of Trupanion, I think there
are several salient points that need to be considered:


The sales channel consists of Territory Partners - converting veterinary clinics to
Trupanion Express - and the Veterinarians then converting their patients into
insurance policy holders. Very few of the Territory Partners (15), and none of the
Veterinarians, are licensed insurance agents.


1.


The valuation is stratospheric. At roughly ~11x book value the share price needs to
fall over 80% to reach the avg insurance company valuation.


2.


There are some interparty relationships whereby the CEO's father has been able to
sell his "downstream" to newer "Territory Partners" and the CEO's Brother is one of
the key current "Territory Partners".


3.


There are zero Wall Street insurance analysts who cover the stock, virtually all of the
analysts are technology analysts who have no insurance companies in their
coverage universe.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4196594-trupanion-regulatory-icarus-75-percent-potential-downside?source=all_articles_title 3/16


Revenue Attribution (just to clarify the importance of the channel in
question)


What's The Law That We Are Asserting?


The first sentence of the Trupanion 10-K states: "We provide medical insurance for cats
and dogs throughout the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico."


For the purpose of this article, I am going to take the company at their word and discuss
the corporation as if it is an insurance company - it's an important distinction only in that
it runs counter to the prevailing conversation among the sell side analysts. It's also
critical because a majority of the growth the company is reporting is derived from a
largely unlicensed network of third parties (referred to as Territory Partners) and the
completely unlicensed Veterinarians - both are paid insurance commissions based on
successful sale of the insurance.


According to the 2017 form 10-K TRUP filed with the SEC, over 65% of new policy
holders came from the mostly unlicensed Veterinarian and third-party referral channel. I
don't think its debatable that this channel is critical for the model to one day prove
sustainability.


For the sake of simplicity, the remainder of this report will focus on the Territory Partners
as a case study in "third party referral networks" and their licensing requirement under
state law. Given that we believe TRUP also pays Veterinarians based on the successful
sale of insurance we believe that they too need to be licensed (especially if the territory
partners are not considering that the vets are definitely "customer facing"). However, the
territory partners are a good case study as they are also responsible for the installation
of Trupanion Express (the CRM and billing software that the internet guys love so
much).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4196594-trupanion-regulatory-icarus-75-percent-potential-downside?source=all_articles_title 4/16


Initial Conclusion Is That These Folks Need to Be Licensed


The New York State Department of Financial Services (the regulatory agency that
oversees insurance companies in New York) has a helpful website that explains what
types of payments are acceptable to someone who is not a licensed insurance agent
(LINK)


I am focused on Question #3: "May an insurance agency pay a fee to a non-licensee
who is not an employee including, but not limited to, a telemarketer hired to solicit leads,
a financial planner, an attorney, and an accountant for making a referral?"


Answer: "An insurance agency may pay a fee to a non-licensee, non-employee for
making a referral provided that the non-licensee does not discuss the specific terms and
conditions of the policy, and the fee paid is not dependent upon whether the referral
results in the sale of insurance." (emphasis added)


The company for its part does not hide the role of its territory partners (from the
Prospectus)


"Increase the number of referring veterinary practices. We intend to increase the
number of veterinary practices that are actively introducing our medical plan to their
clients by continuing to expand our national independent referral network of Territory
Partners and increasing direct marketing to veterinarians."


TRUP also does not hide that their Territory Partners are "independent
contractors" (from the Prospectus)


"Our Territory Partners are "independent contractors" for all purposes and, accordingly,
we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation, and oversight
over our Territory Partners as we otherwise could if our Territory Partners were our own
employees."


TRUP also does not hide how the Territory Partners are compensated (from the
Territory Partner Brochure)


"With our 100% commission based model, you'll earn a commission for each new policy
within your exclusive region, and continue to receive residual income each month for the
lifetime of every policy you sell."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4196594-trupanion-regulatory-icarus-75-percent-potential-downside?source=all_articles_title 5/16


Which is exactly the point I am making...


Licensing requirements do not appear to be an area of debate (at least within NY State)
as the guidance from the New York State Department of Financial Services clearly
states that referrals from non-licensed independent contractors cannot be paid a fee
which is "dependent upon whether the referral results in the sale of insurance."


Trupanion establishes in its publicly available documents:


Territory Partners role is to generate referrals1.


Territory Partners are independent contractors2.


Territory Partners are paid ONLY when they generate a patient who converts to a
plan holder (or insurance beneficiary if you are a HC investor)


3.


It seems obvious that this sales funnel is in desperate need of a compliance officer and
some licensing, the SEC had some similar comments for the company in its initial
correspondence. Specifically, the SEC stated, "Please note here that Territory Partners
are compensated by you on a commission basis."


Trupanion has never filed a document with the SEC or for investors where they admit
that the Territory Partners are paid a commission, that's only published in the Territory
Partners brochure we linked above. Instead, Trupanion added the following risk
language to its Prospectus


"If regulators determined that any of our contact center employees, Territory Partners,
veterinarians or other referral sources were selling subscriptions to our medical plan on
our behalf, and therefore needed to be licensed in a particular jurisdiction, we could
become subject to conviction for an offense or the imposition of an administrative
penalty and liable for significant penalties and would likely be required to modify our
business practices and sales and marketing programs, or license the affected
individuals, which may be impractical or costly and time-consuming to implement. Any
modification of our business or marketing practices in response to regulatory licensing
requirements could harm our business, operating results or financial condition."

It's Just Not That Profitable to Be a Territory Partner


I do believe it's likely that the state regulators will force either the Territory Partners
and/or the Veterinarians to become licensed insurance agents, and I believe it would be
very difficult, if not impossible, for the company to get all of their Territory partners
licensed. Territory Partner retention is already a concern that comes up on every
investor call and very few of them have shown a willingness to get licensed so far.


The federal minimum wage of $7.25 equates to $15,080 annually. TRUP uses the same
wage projections in dozens of job postings, which estimates Territory Partner comp in
year one to be $4,500-15,000 (see here). TRUP materials say Territory Partners should
expect to incur costs of ~$12,000 per year, but online postings suggest costs are
actually often higher (see here). According to the CEO, only about 50% of Territory
Partners make it through their first two years (see here). So most Territory Partners
churn out of the business before making any money. That helps explain why our review
of the territory partners yields only 15 licensed insurance agents out of the 113 territory
partners we identified. On the most recent call, the CEO stated that the company had
106 territory partners, which suggests there has been some churn that I was unable to
reconcile real time.

The CEO's dad, David Rawlings Sr., and brother, David Rawlings Jr., are top Territory
Partners at TRUP. From 2011-2013, David Rawlings Sr. commanded 9-13% of all

Valuation, Valuation, Valuation


"Since 2003, David Rawlings, the father of our Chief Executive Officer, has
provided services to us as an independent contractor through his role as one of our
Territory Partners. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we
paid David Rawlings approximately $235,000, $268,000 and $310,000 for his
services as a Territory Partner."


"For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the three months
ended March 31, 2014, we paid our Territory Partners aggregate fees equal to $1.8
million, $2.7 million, $3.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively."


David Rawlings Sr. has since sold some of his territories to other down-line Territory
Partners, but Rawlings still receives a portion of the sales.


4/27/18 - Form DEF 14A


"David Rawlings sold certain territories to other Territory Partners, including his son
David Rawlings, Jr., pursuant to Assignment and Assumption Agreements that require
us to continue to pay David Rawlings a portion of the proceeds payable with respect to
those territories. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid David Rawlings
approximately $24,500 in fees for his services as a Territory Partner and in substantially
the same manner as we compensate other Territory Partners. In addition, we paid an
aggregate amount of approximately $131,595 to David Rawlings on behalf of certain
Territory Partners pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreements."


It remains an open source of debate how a stream of capital generated from the
successful conversion of patients into plan holders (beneficiaries) can be thought
of as anything but an insurance brokerage?


A brief walk through the available universe of insurance companies yields an avg
valuation of 1.8x Price to Book Value.

If one gave Trupanion a 3x book value multiple, it would imply a ~$330M market cap
and a share price of roughly ~$10/share. 3x book value gives the company ample credit
for growth as its peer universe of healthcare insurance companies trade at 1.8x book
value.


However, TRUP is trading at an inflated 11x or a 6.1x premium to the peer
universe.

An additional concern is that shareholders seem to reap no benefit from the "grow at all
cost" mentality as losses (defined here as retained earnings) are deep in the red and
showing renewed signs of expansion.

These valuation distortions are hard to come by unless there is a disconnect between
the owners/coverage of the security and its fundamental business practices. In the case
of TRUP we see that the coverage is dominated by internet and technology analysts, I
don't see a dedicated insurance analyst in the group.

Not to pick on Mark Mahaney of RBC, he's probably a perfectly nice guy and has a solid
reputation as an internet analyst. But there is nothing in this list of companies that would
suggest he has a long history with insurance regulations

Conclusion


RISKS


TRUP looks like a company that has grown too fast for its management team to
keep up with the regulatory environment they operate in. I submit that they have
serious compliance issues to deal with regarding the licensing status of the territory
partners and potentially the veterinarians who refer their patients to the insurance
product (and are also reimbursed based off of successful conversion of patients
into plan holders).


The model itself may not be viable if the company must assume the increased
costs associated with coming into compliance with the state insurance laws given
the current lack of cash flow generation as well as the dearth of operational
leverage displayed in the financial statements.


The valuation - even if everything else I have said is false - needs to be trimmed by
over 80% to come into harmony with its universe.


The risks to this thesis are simple - state insurance commissioners have to look at
the Trupanion model and decide that 3rd party "Territory Partners" as well as the
Veterinarians are allowed to sell insurance, and be paid a commission for said sale,
without attaining an insurance licenses.

Additionally, the uptake of the Trupanion insurance product could see a rapid rise in

circumstance, I could see a 6x book value as being appropriate yielding a $20 fair

Update 8/20/2018: A Trupanion representative reached out with the following response
to this article:


Veterinarians are not asked to sell or solicit insurance.


Trupanion does not pay any compensation to veterinarians based on the sale of
insurance.


Territory Partners do not sell or solicit Trupanion direct to consumers unless they
have elected to obtain a license as direct marketing is not their role.


Territory Partners and veterinarians do not convert pet owners to become policy
holders. Trupanion sells insurance to pet owners through its website and telephonic
service center.
