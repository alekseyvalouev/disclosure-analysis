Summary


We believe IMbark may have a healthier patient population which explains the
longer than expected overall survival.


Deeper analysis shows that median overall survival in patients after discontinuation
of Jakafi can be as long as 36 months.


If imetelstat had a positive impact on overall survival, we would expect the 9.4mg/kg
dose arm to have outperformed the ineffective 4.7mg/kg arm.


We are short Geron with a targeted return of 90%.


We believe the recent update from Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) was definitely negative.
Despite Geron's claim that the overall survival seen so far in the IMbark trial is very
promising, we believe the median overall survival (mOS) for the imetelstat group is not
unusual given the baseline health of the IMbark patients. We also believe that Geron
provided evidence that imetelstat has no impact on survival by disclosing that there was
no difference in median survival detected so far in either dosing arm. The update only
served to confirm our view of imetelstat's likely failure and our expectation that partner
Janssen (NYSE:JNJ) will terminate its licensing agreement.


IMbark enrolled a population which benefited survival when
compared to historical literature


The big takeaway that investors seemed to have had from Geron's recent update was that
with a median follow up of 19 months at the time of the January 2018 data cut, median
overall survival had not been reached in either dosing arm in the IMbark trial. Geron
further stated the greater than 19 months of median overall survival looked promising
since published clinical and real-world studies estimate that median overall survival after
discontinuing JAK inhibition therapy is approximately 14-16 months. Analysts such as

from Stifel went further and stated, "As the 19 month follow-up was conducted in January,
this suggests a potential ~22-24 month median overall survival in patients taking
imetelstat." Investors ate up the news, driving the shares up over 50% to 52-week highs.


We think investors are overlooking the fact that the patients in the IMbark trial are
healthier than the trials to which Geron compared them. The IMbark trial's inclusion and
exclusion criteria explicitly state that only ECOG 0-2 patients can be enrolled and that
patients with a peripheral blood blast count of >= 10% are to be excluded. The trial
excluded ECOG 3 patients, who are capable of only limited self-care and are confined to a
bed or chair for more than 50% of their waking hours. We also know that myelofibrosis
(MF) patients with peripheral blood blast count of >=10% have shorter overall survival.
Based on stated trial criteria, we have concluded that the IMbark trial did not include very
sick patients.


Geron provided additional information on the 4Q 2017 conference call when in response
to a question, Geron revealed that IMbark patients "required at least 75,000 platelets" per
microliter. This point is crucial because when stratified by platelet count, the historical MF
trials show that patients with higher platelet counts live substantially longer than the
overall population of patients who discontinue JAK inhibitors.


A well-known trial for MF patients after discontinuation of ruxolitinib (Jakafi) is a recently
published paper in the 130 edition of medical journal Blood by researchers at MD
Anderson. The researchers state that patients after discontinuation of Jakafi had a
"median survival time of 14 months (95% CI, 10-18 months)."


At face value, the IMbark results look very promising versus the MD Anderson results: at
least 19 months mOS in IMbark vs. an expected mOS of 14 months. However, the MD
Anderson trial was actually a chart review on an essentially all-comers basis and followed
patients from the start of Jakafi and after discontinuation. In other words, it included all
patients who discontinued Jakafi regardless of health. This can be seen in Table 1 where it
shows that the median platelet count in the post-Jakafi population was 91,000/ul with a
range of 11,000/ul to 922,000/ul. Because the median platelet count in the paper was so
close to the allowed lower bound in the IMbark trial, a substantial portion of the patients
followed in the MD Anderson paper would have been ineligible for IMbark. For reference,

a normal level of platelets is 150,000-400,000/ul and mild bleeding can occur if platelets
drop below 50,000/ul. We can also see that one of the patients in the MD Anderson paper
had a platelet count of 11,000/ul, which is considered very low.


We can see later in the Blood article in Figure 2B that patients with platelet counts
<100,000/ul did significantly worse in terms of survival. It appears this population had a
median survival closer to 10 months. They accounted for 33 of the 56 total patients, more
than half of the population, which we believe skewed the overall results negatively.
Conversely, for the patients with a platelet count of >100,000/ul, it appears the mOS was
closer to 36 months! We believe the IMbark patient population was more similar to the
>100,000/ul population in the MD Anderson trial than the <100,000/ul population. Keep in
mind that IMbark already excluded patients with ECOG scores greater than 2 and patients
who had peripheral blood blasts of >10%.

If IMbark, which as we showed above had a relatively healthy population, enrolled one-
third of patients that should have an expected mOS of 10 months and two-thirds of
patients that should have an expected mOS of 36 months, then we would expect the
blended average to be around 24 months. As a result, we believe that the median OS of
22-23 months that Stifel estimates Geron is observing currently is neither impressive nor
unprecedented. In fact, it's completely expected.


IMbark high-dose arm is not outperforming the low-dose arm
which was determined to be ineffective


Furthermore, Geron disclosed that neither arm of the IMbark had reached median OS.
The IMbark trial had two arms, a low-dose 4.7mg/kg arm and a high-dose 9.4mg/kg arm.
In September 2016, Geron announced that enrollment in the 4.7mg/kg dosing arm would
be discontinued because the dose was determined to be ineffective and did not "warrant
further investigation."

In addition, because the low-dose arm was essentially shut down, Janssen amended the
trial protocol so that the 4.7mg/kg arm patients were allowed to crossover to the 9.4mg/kg
arm at the investigator's discretion. However, Geron stated on the recent fourth quarter
2017 earnings call that "there were a meaningful number of patients who remained on 4.7
mg/kg." Therefore, we believe the 4.7mg/kg is a good proxy for a placebo or control arm.


Since Geron and Janssen determined the 4.7mg/kg arm was ineffective, then we should
expect the 9.4mg/kg arm to outperform on a survival basis, but we haven't seen that yet,
as indicated in their press release which stated: "the median overall survival has not been
reached in either dosing arm." Since the 4.7mg/kg arm was enrolled on average earlier
than the 9.4mg/kg arm, a best case would be equivalent survival rates between the arms.


This indicates to us that imetelstat has not had a positive impact on survival. This lack of
survival efficacy matches the lack of efficacy in traditional endpoints associated with MF
like spleen volume, which Geron and Janssen announced in April 2017, and we believe it
corroborates our view that imetelstat is not effective in MF.


Janssen is no fool


Lastly, we point out that Janssen has essentially delayed its decision on imetelstat multiple
times. A decision was originally expected in 2016 and then in 2017. If imetelstat truly
offered a 4-6 month or greater survival benefit, we believe Janssen would have opted into
imetelstat by now. Instead, Janssen stopped enrollment in September 2016 and has been
waiting until the last moment to make a decision. To us, this seems like more of a Hail
Mary than a strong indicator of efficacy.


We are short Geron


We are short Geron with a price target of $0.51. We believe imetelstat will be returned by
Janssen and value it at $0.
