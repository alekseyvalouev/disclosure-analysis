GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS 


• Gowex shares are worth €0.00 per share. 


• Over 90% of Gowex’s reported revenues do not exist. We 


estimate GOW’s actual revenues to be <€10 million. 


• The shares will be suspended, just as Pescanova’s shares 


were suspended. 


SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 


• Gowex’s actual Wireless revenues are at most 10% of what 


GOW reports in its financial statements. 


• GOW’s Hotspot network it owns or manages is ~5K in size. 


CEO told us 100K+ & JBCapitalMarkets estimates 35K. 


• GOW’s audit fee is €40,000, which makes sense if Gowex’s 


actual revenues are only 5%-10% of reported revenue. 


• 90% of Telecom revenue originated from undisclosed 


related parties, tied to GOW CFO & an early investor. We 


have evidence Gowex’s largest customer was really itself. 


• Gowex Telecom (i.e. Iber-x) website has not been updated 


in years. It appears to be no longer in business. 


• Gowex told some investors that New York City was paying 


them €7.5 million. GOW told us €2 million. The real 


number is <€200,000, according to New York City. 


• Gowex does not publicly disclose basic metrics, such as 


hotspot count or wireless revenue segment details. 


• The head of investor relations is the CEO’s wife. She signed 


off on GOW’s annual reports. 


• The June 5
th


 MallPlaza press release (in English) makes 


demonstrably false claims. The same press release in the 


native Spanish omits the false claims. 


• GOW lied to the European Union’s Transparency Register, 


claiming it spent over €50 mm in political contributions. 


• CEO Jenaro Garcia was a Director of Advanced Refractive 


Technologies, a penny stock fraud whose shares were 


revoked by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  


• GOW’s private market valuation is only €0.14 per share, 


based on Arqiva’s acquisition valuation.

INTRODUCTION 


Let’s Gowex is a very rare company. CEO Jenaro Garcia and GOW’s promoters would have you believe it 


is rare, just as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are rare. Gotham City Research initially found it to be 


rare as well, just for all the wrong reasons. The following initially concerned us: 


• GOW claims to generate double digit revenue growth & dougle digit profit margins, by providing 


free wifi, yet its publicly-traded peers (Boingo, iPass, Towerstream, etc) lose money.
1
   


• Even more puzzling, all prior for-profit attempts to provide free-wifi on mass scale have failed.
2
 


Even giants Starbucks/Mcdonald’s, who provide free wifi, and generate the traffic to potentially 


monetize, are believed to provide free wifi while incurring net costs.  


• Despite all this, Gowex’s revenue per employee exceeds Google’s, Facebook’s, and Microsoft’s, 


and its market value exceeds the sum of Boingo, iPass, & Towerstream’s market values. 


• Gowex does not disclose basic operating metrics, such as its hotspot count or a breakdown of 


revenues, in its public filings. Imagine a retailer, such as Carrefour, not disclosing store count. 


• Gowex came public on the Mercado Alternativo Bursatil (itself, a new concept in 2009). The 


MAB is similar to London’s AIM and the US pinksheet/OTC, both of which are rife with fraud. 


• Gowex originated in Spain, its shares are listed in France (in addition to Spain), and most of its 


revenue and operations are ‘international’. 


• Arqiva acquired a comparable company at a valuation that implies GOW is worth less than €1.
3
 


Gowex piqued our interest, so we decided to dig deeper.  After 8 months of diligence, we found Gowex 


is a lot worse than we initially thought. GOW is a zero. We specifically noticed 3 clear patterns. Firstly, 


GOW has a proven track record of making demonstrably false claims. Second, Gowex provides different 


answers, to different investors. Third, wireless industry experts are unable to make sense of GOW.  


Our due diligence, involved field research across several continents, speaking with industry 


operators/investors, speaking with the company, and constantly asking ourselves “what are we missing?” 


We are confident GOW is a charade & shares are worthless. Here are some highlights of our findings:  


• Gowex’s reported revenues are overstated by at least 10x, according to GCR calculations. In fact, 


90% of their reported revenues were suspect before it became a publicly traded company. 


• The actual # of hotspots they own/manage is 5% of what GOW told us (20% of JB’s estimate).  


• GOW paid its auditor around €50,000 (on average) in the last 3 years. That is between 1/10
th


 – 


1/20
th


 of what its peers pay. Its audit fee makes sense if their actual revenue is < €10 million. 


• Misleading (false) claims are made to English and French investors, but not to Spanish investors. 


• Many industry insiders and experts don’t understand Gowex’s alleged business model. They 


don’t understand how they are making money.  There are documented examples of the CEO 


making materially false statements.  


Were Gotham City Research or someone else not to have come along, the Gowex charade could have 


continued for few more years, costing investors several more billions of dollars. We believe the days of 


Gowex and Jenaro García Martín’s misrepresentations are coming to an end.

Over 90% of Gowex’s Reported Revenues are Suspect 


Let’s Gowex is a highly unusual company. If the numbers are to be believed, GOW is a 


breathtakingly good business, with truly exceptional revenue per employee metrics
1
: 





When we say ‘exceptional’ we mean not only far superior versus its peers, but far above nearly 


all other businesses in history. €1.0-€1.7 million in Revenue per employee handily exceeds those 


of Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. 


Gotham City Research does not trust Gowex’s reported revenues, and believes Gowex is too 


good to be true. In fact, the following sections in this report detail – segment by segment – why 


we believe over 90% of Gowex’s reported revenues are incorrect. We calculate GOW’s true 


2013 revenue to be ~€8 million
2
: 





€8 million revenues would better explain why GOW uses an unknown auditor, & pays so little
3
: 





It would also explain why the CEO’s wife is the head of Investor Relations, and signed off on the 2013 


annual report (very last page in the English version). Make no mistake: GOW is worth €0.00 per share.

Gowex Telecom & a History of Material Misrepresentations 


Gowex (formerly known as Iber-x) is largely the story of its CEO, Jenaro García Martín. Martín was once 


a Florida-based stockbroker who in the late 1990s decided to enter the land of telecom and 


entrepreneurship. He founded Iber-x in 1999 (or 1998; his linked profile says 1999, but the offering 


circular says 1998), and quickly attracted attention with some bold forecasts
1
:  


“The company [Gowex Telecom] expects to break even by the end of this year and make a profit 


of $500,000 by 2001, Mr. Garcia said. He estimates Iber-X will post a $100 million net profit by 


2005.” – September 26
th


, 2000 , WSJE: Iber-X Of Spain Prepares To Enter Markets In Americas 


Although a lot can happen in 5 years’ time, it seems Jenaro was insincere about his $100 million profit 


forecast (actual revenues were low single digits). Just 2 months later, he told the Wall Street Journal
2
:  





Whatever CEO Jenaro García Martín motivations were at the time, it’s evident that he and his business 


failed miserably after the dot com bubble crashed. Gotham City Research believes that what might have 


been occasional dishonesty in the past, soon became habitual for Jenaro García Martín
3
: 


“The company [Iber-x/Gowex] made a large profit on a €42.0 million turnover in 2002”, said 


CEO Jenaro Garcia. Wednesday, March 19 2003 


In fact, Gowex only generated €2.7 million turnover by 2003 according to its offering circular filing. 


After the early 2000s, his attempted expansion into China (via the acquisition of Ace Asia) evidently 


failed (see appendix C). We believe he kept a low profile and quietly ran a small business (funded, in part, 


by government grants) until the debut of the Mercado Alternativo Bursatil (“MAB”) in 2008. Gotham 


City Research believes 90% of Gowex Telecom’s reported revenues never existed in substance, & were 


booked so Gowex could go public and successfully issue shares. The following support our opinions:  


• Gowex Telecom (Iber-x) does not seem to exist in substance as a business.  Its websites have 


been inactive for years. Gowex.com shows no evidence of an active Gowex telecom business. 


• Gowex Telecom’s three largest customers (80%-90% of reported revenue) in 2007-2008 are 


actually undisclosed related parties tied to Gowex’s CFO and a former shareholder.  


• Reported revenue from Gowex Telecom remained flat 2008-2013. We are confident there are 


no new customers that magically replaced the 90% of the 2007-2008 fictitious revenues. 


• GOW told us that Telefonica is one of its largest Gowex Telecom customers. Based on our due 


diligence, this is false. In fact, we have evidence that Gowex is a customer of Telefonica. 


• When we recently asked the CEO about Gowex Telecom’s customers, Jenaro Garcia did not 


mention any of the three largest customers that accounted for 80%-90% 2007-2008 revenue.

Gowex Telecom’s Website and Portal Seem Abandoned, Not Updated in Many Years 


The Gowex Telecom portal, the Iber-X portal, has not been updated in many years
5
: 





In fact, http://iber-x.net/ , http://iber-x.com/ , http://www.iber-x.es/ do not work at all. According to 


who.is, http://iber-x.com/ is ‘inactive’. The http://www.Iberx.com domain no longer belongs to Gowex. 


It clearly used to belong to Gowex, as shown below: 





If you think the Gowex simply abandoned its iber-x.com domain, and replaced it with a gowex domain 


for its Gowex Telecom operation, we encourage you to visit http://www.gowex.com.  There are no signs 


of an on-going Gowex telecom business. There’s no place for a prospective customer to make a 


purchase or even review which products/services Gowex offers. Finally, if you visit the wayback machine 


and view http://www.iber-x.com , you find Iber-x has not actively updated its website in over 10 years
6

~50% of Gowex Telecom’s Reported Revenue Come from Seasuntel S.L., an Undisclosed Related Party 


Given that iber-x.com has not been updated in years, investors may wonder how Gowex reports any 


revenue from Gowex Telecom. Gowex’s offering circular filing offers a few hints, as it provides a 


breakdown of revenue by customer. The largest customers are shown below
7
: 





Seasuntel is clearly Gowex’s largest customer. We believe Gowex’s revenues from Seasuntel lack 


economic substance, as Seasuntel is: 


• Gowex’s largest customer  


• Gowex’s largest supplier  


• An undisclosed related party, secretly controlled by Gonzalez Javier Martin, through PJ Gris 


Inversiones (a Gowex shareholder at the time of GOW’s IPO) 


• Tied to REDSINFRONTERAS.ORG, a “foundation” owned by Gowex (which too happens to be a 


“customer”; more on this later). 


• Seasuntel’s website currently does not work. Old versions of the website (as saved by the 


waybackmachine) shows an unsophisticated website. 


• Seasuntel stopped filing financial statements after 2008.  


• There is evidence that Gowex is Seasuntel. (See Appendix B) 


Seasuntel is secretly controlled by Gonzalez Javier Martin, through PJ Gris Inversiones (a Gowex 


shareholder at the time of GOW’s IPO, as shown below)

Page 11 of 93 





Further Reason to Doubt the Economic Substance of Gowex’s Seasuntel Revenues  


In its offering circular (note 16 – short term payables), Gowex claims to have purchased over €15 million 


from Seasuntel, making Seasuntel Gowex’s largest ‘supplier’
11


: 











Gowex claims to have paid Seasuntel €15 million, and then claims to have earned €12 million from 


Seasuntel, while being secretly controlled by one of its shareholders. The Gowex/Seasuntel transactions 


resemble round-trip transactions (transactions that lack economic substance):  














Seasuntel "pays" 
Gowex Telecom 


€12 million


Gowex Telecom 
"pays" Seasuntel 


€15 million
Page 12 of 93 





Seasuntel’s website currently does not work. Old versions of the website (as saved by the 


waybackmachine) show a very simple (two tabs only) website
12


: 








Based on the above, Seasuntel does not appear to be much of a business. Furthermore, there are 


additional signs that the relationship between it and Gowex is even closer (from above): 


SEASUNTEL … está involucrado en el plan 4X4 Wi-Fi, colaborando con la Fundación 


REDSINFRONTERAS.ORG, para extender el conocimiento de la Sociedad de la Información a las 


zonas rurales. 


REDSINFRONTERAS.ORG, as we will show later, is a “foundation” owned by Gowex (which too happens 


to be a “customer”). Seasuntel stopped filing financial statements after 2008. Furthermore, there is 


evidence that suggests Gowex is Seasuntel, as detailed in Appendix B.
Page 13 of 93 





Gowex Telecom’s Next 2 Largest Customers are Secretly Tied to Gowex’s CFO 


Seasuntel accounted for ~50% of Gowex’s Telecom reported revenue. Panel Consulting and Line 


Informatica (i.e., Line Informatica Profesional) account for ~30% of reported revenue
13


: 








We believe Gowex’s reported revenue from Panel Consulting and Line Informatica lack economic 


substance for the following reasons (See Appendix A for additional details, including citations): 


• Panel Consulting and Line Informatica Professional (the correct name) are both secretly tied to 


Gowex’s CFO, Francisco Manuel Martinez Marugan. 


• Francisco Manuel Martinez Marugan’s past is quite suspect. There is very little information 


about the CFO from his Linkedin profile, gowex website biography, or the biography found in the 


offering circular. None of his biographies mention his history or ties with Panel or Line. 


• Given the CFO’s shady background, secret ties to Gowex’s largest customers, Gowex’s low audit 


fees, and CEO Jenaro Garcia’s Wife’s involvement with signing off on Gow’s financial 


statements… these are not ‘coincidences’. 


• Panel Consulting and Line Informatica Panel share a tie with a man named Antonio Salmeron 


Campos. 


• Line Informatica Profesional sl website doesn’t work: http://www.line-pro.es/ 


Please see the Appendix A for more information. In it we: 


• Detail the above findings, just as we detailed the relationship between Gowex and Seasuntel in 


prior pages. 


• Demonstrate how Gowex’s reported revenue from C. I. NETCOM TIC BROKER GROUP SL, AS TIC 


BROKER SL, and Fundcion Red Sin Fronteras are of doubtful substance as well. 


• Show how Gowex Telecom’s 2008 revenue does not even equal the sum of its revenues by 


customer. The numbers do not add. 





2013 Telecom Revenues are Just as Materially False as 2007-2008 Telecom Revenues 


Seasuntel, Panel Consulting, and Line Informatica accounted for 80%-90% of 2007-2008 telecom 


revenues. Since then, total telecom revenues have steadily remained between €20-€25 million

We asked Gowex who their largest Telecom customers are. The CEO listed: Jazztel, France Telecom, Colt, 


Telefonica (Jenaro specifically said Telefonica “one of our largest”), Level 3, Tata com, and Tiscali.
15





Strangely none of these companies are listed as Gowex’s largest customers in 2007-2008.  


We investigated the claim that Telefonica is one of their largest customers. This is what we found
16


: 


• Telefonica is not paying Gowex. 


• There is a contract between Gowex and Telefonica. 


• Gowex is paying Telefonica. Unclear for what purposes.  


Interestingly enough, it seems Tiscali may not be a customer either. Per Gowex’s circular Tiscali is a 


supplier, not customer
17


: 








GOW mentions Jazztel as a customer in its offering circular... just not as a large customer: 





Which is odd given how long they have (purportedly) had a relationship with Jazztel: 





Equally odd, Colt is mentioned as a 2000 “client reference” , yet it is not mentioned as a customer at all 


in the 2010’s offering circular. We are confident that Gowex did not magically replace 90% of its 


reported 2007-2008 revenues with any of these customers. All the evidence provided here, and in the 


remainder of the report, support our belief that over 90% of current Telecom revenues do not exist.
Page 15 of 93 





Hotspots: GOW says 100K, Analyst says 35K, We say 5K 


“History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme” – Mark Twain 


We recently spoke with Gowex and CEO Jenaro Garcia Martin and asked him 4 simple questions
1
: 


• “How many hotspots did Gowex have in 2013?” 


• “JB Analyst report says 17% of your 2013 revenue came from advertising. Is this correct?” 


• “How much is NYC paying you? How much is San Francisco paying you?” 


• “Who are your largest Gowex Telecom customers?” 


We found that all his answers were false or misleading. When asked about hotspots, he initially said 


Gowex does not disclose & explained why. When we pressured him, he answered “in the 100,000s.” He 


has privately told other investors similarly. According to Gowex’s hotspot map, the count is only 5,530
2
: 





When we indirectly asked him if the JB analyst report’s 2013 wireless revenue breakdown is correct, he 


claimed Gowex does not disclose Wireless revenue by segment. He justified their opaque policy with
3
: 


• “We don’t disclose revenue or gross margin details in order to prevent copycats.” (note we 


never asked for profit-level details). 


• “I’m not able / I don’t want to provide different communications to different analysts, investors” 


• “There’s a Harvard Business Review report saying that opaque businesses work better in the 


stock exchange than transparent ones.” 


Gotham City Research finds his rationale for not disclosing odd, given the fact Gowex used to provide 


Wireless revenue details (Jenaro conveniently did not tell us they used to disclose!)
4
: 





Gowex Hotspot Count


2013


Gowex told us 100,000s


Gowex told some investors 200,000


Gowex told other investors 100,000


JB Capital Analyst 35,000


Gowex's hotspot map* 5,530


* as of May 2014
Page 16 of 93 





In 2012 Gowex stopped disclosing the revenue components of its Wireless segment. Unfortunately for 


Jenaro Garcia, Gotham City Research is fully aware that he has provided some investors, with the 


wireless revenue detail. Jenaro must foolishly think investors do not speak amongst themselves (or with 


Wall Street analysts).  Therefore, as a matter of fact, Gowex has provided different communications to 


different investors. This directly contradicts his claim: “I’m not able / I don’t want to provide different 


communications to different analysts, investors.” 


We know that the JB analyst report’s wireless business revenue breakdown is consistent with what 


Jenaro has told other investors (but refuses to disclose in its public filings)
5
: 





Gotham City Research believes Gowex does not publicly disclose hotspot count or provide wireless 


revenue breakdown, ultimately because Wireless revenues, just like its Telecom revenues, are materially 


overstated (we think over 90%). The following lead us to distrust over 90% of Gowex Wireless revenues: 


• Owned/managed hotspots are only ~5,000, or less than 5% of what he’s told people privately. 


• Over 50% of Gowex hotspots are owned by Towerstream, who earned only $1 million in 2013, 


renting to Gowex & one other client.
6
 We doubt Gowex’s claim that it earned over €100 million 


in roaming/offloading and engineering revenues in 2013 when the supplier of over half of 


GOW’s network makes only $1 million in revenue. 


• Based on poor hotspot quality, traffic, and locations, there is no way Gowex can monetize on 


their hotspots as they claim. Reviews are poor, the app itself doesn’t work well, slow speed, etc. 


• CEO Garcia avoids meeting with wireless industry experts, but is happy to speak with retail 


investors and day traders. We think Garcia fears legitimate experts as they might expose his 


charade.
7
 


• China website doesn’t look like it’s been updated since it first launched, per wayback machine. 


The domain China.gowex.cn is for sale. Gowex conveniently omits that Gowex/Iber-x’s past 


forays into China failed miserably.  


• The MallPlaza deal press release (in english) claims 800 million potential users (which is 


impossible, as it would exceed the combined populations of those coountries). In the native 


Spanish version of the press release, they don’t mention that at all.

Gowex Hotspots – the True Count 


Given that one can count the number of Gowex Hotspots through its hotspot maps, we struggle to find a 


good reason why Gowex and CEO Garcia refuse to publicly disclose its hotspot count. We actually 


counted all the hotspots as disclosed on their map (both on website and app). The number is closer to 


5,000 as of April 2014, not 100,000 or 200,000 (see the next page for a more detailed table)
8
: 





This means that the company has to generate €28,427 per hotspot per year to meet its reported 2013 


wireless revenue of €157 million. 


Imagine if retailers (such as Walmart, Carrefour, Mercadona) refused to disclose their store count. It 


would be counterproductive for its investors and customers for a retailer not to disclose. Customers 


would be confused where stores are located (which would undermine potential sales). And investors 


would wonder what the company has to hide, leading to lower stock valuations. Analogously, Gowex’s 


refusal to disclose its hotspot count makes no business sense.

JB Capital Analyst Estimates 35,000 hotspots, 7x Actual hotspot count 


JB Capital Markets, in their initiation report, stated the following
9
: 


“GOWEX does not disclose at this time the number of hotspots available, although using previously 


available data offered by the company, we believe GOWEX manages over 35,000 of its own 


hotspots, with a global network made up of over 500,000 hotspots.”  


Note that JB Capital is the most legitimate brokerage firm covering Gowex. Despite its market value, 


Gowex has failed to attract a major Wall Street investment bank. We are confident this is because even 


amongst investment bankers, Gowex lacks credibility. 


Over 86% of Hotspots in Outdoor Areas, Severely Limiting Monetization Potential 


Not only is Gowex’s actual hotspot a fraction of what they convey to investors, over 86% of Gowex’s 


5,530 hotspots are located outdoors (in cities)
10


: 





Outdoor locations are notably poor quality, for the purpose of monetization (especially New York) 


Outdoor hotspots are much more difficult to monetize, as connection traffic tends to be low. Consider: 


• 42% of the 5,526 Gowex hotspots are in New York alone. 


• New York is known for its four seasons. New Yorkers do not stand around outside during the 


cold winter, and the colder parts of Spring and Fall. New Yorkers also do not stand around 


outside during the humid summers. They prefer wifi in a warm environment during the winter, 


or an air-conditioned environment during the hot and humid summers. 


• Given that Starbucks, Mcdonald’s, Panera, and others provide free wifi, with heat in the winter, 


and air conditioning in the summer, Gowex’s hotspots are comparatively of little economic value 


to would-be advertisers, telecom operators, etc.  


• In the hotspots near residential areas (and/or indoors), why would an operator pay Gowex for 


providing residents free wifi, when the operator makes money for providing internet access? 


• We believe that only 2,500-3,000 of 5,530 total hotspots are unique locations, which further 


limits Gowex’s financial potential for these locations.    


In addition to the reasons stated above, note that nearly all Gowex’s New York and San Francisco 


hotspots are owned by Towerstream. As Gowex rents from Towerstream, Gowex’s potential 


installation/maintenance revenues are limited, nearly non-existent. Half of Gowex’s hotspot (New York 


and San Francisco) belong to Towerstream, yet Towerstream reported less than $1 million in revenue.  


Gowex Hotspots by Location Type


Cities (mostly outdoors) 4,771 86.3%


Franchise (private vendors) 370 6.7%


Transport (Bus/transit) 385 7.0%


TOTAL 5,526 100.0%
Page 20 of 93 





Reviews for the Gowex App and Hotspots are Poor 


It seems the only people who have good things to say about Gowex is the company itself & day traders. 


We’ve found that consumers throughout the world rate Gowex’s free wifi app poorly. Take for example 


these Google Play /Android reviews (see Appendix D for more reviews and user commentary)
11


: 





Note the following (the above is actually representative of all the reviews we’ve encountered): 


• One of the three 5-star rated reviews appears to be fake 


• Two of them are suspiciously short, lack any descriptive detail, as to why the app is good. 


• The only 4-star rated review should be a 1-star rating, judging by the review comment. 


• Most of the 1-star ratings describe the app freezing, not working, and other specific grievances. 


The reviews on the iOS (Apple iPhone) are similarly poor. Here are some highlights:
12 


• The number of ratings and average ratings are not good. In fact, like Android, many of the good 


ratings are suspicious. So the true rating is probably lower. 


• More than half of the users say they can’t connect. 


Gotham City Research’s Hotspot Due Diligence – Gowex Wifi Is Irregular, Inconsistent, and Slow  


Rather than simply relying on all the review we read, Gotham City Research tested the mobile app and 


hotspots. Overall, we found that all complaints have merit. Highlights include: 


• The Gowex App Freezes regularly – The Gowex app regularly freezes. It freezed on us at least 


once per day. We regularly had to reboot smartphones. We are relatively “tech savvy”, so it 


wasn’t a big problem. We can see how this would be problem for many other people.
Page 21 of 93 





• Hotspots do not work 30%-50% of the time – We found that 30%-50% of the time, we had no 


wifi connection even though the app said so. Other times, the hotspot simply was not detected. 


It wasn’t clear to us if it’s the app’s fault (but the hotspot is fine), or if the hotspot was non-


existent/non-functional but the app was fine.  


• Slow speeds – When the app works, we were able to do all kinds of basic web surfing (e-mail, 


twitter, text websites). However, we were NEVER able to load a simple youtube clip. 


• In New York, Often Required to Login to Website – In New York, we regularly had to log-in to a 


portal website via the smartphone browser, even though we were already logged in via the app. 


This is clearly very annoying.  


• Gowex does not provide uninterrupted wifi service – We were never able to sustain a Gowex 


signal while in motion. We had to stand still. In fact, Gowex’s free wifi speed and reliability are 


far worse than Starbucks, Mcdonald’s, or Panera’s free wifi. 


Gowex’s Deceptive Mall Plaza Press Release: One for English Speakers, Another for Spanish Speakers 


Just weeks ago, Gowex announced an “agreement” with Mall Plaza, in which it claimed
13


: 


The objective of the partnership between GOWEX and Plaza is to reach each and every one of the 


chain’s shopping centres in Chile, Colombia and Peru in order to offer free WiFi to 840 million 


potential users per year. - 





Given that Chile, Peru, & Colombia’s combined population is 95 million, the above is difficult to believe
14


:
Page 22 of 93 








To make matters far worse, Gowex does not include that paragraph,nor those far-fetched claims, in the 


original Spanish version of the same press release (you must see it for yourself)

Is China Gowex Fake? China.Gowex.cn domain is for sale 


‘.com’ domains tend to belong to US-domiciled companies, whereas ‘.cn’ websites tend to belong to 


China-domiciled companies. Out of curiosity we checked the http://china.gowex.cn domain, as it would 


be a logical choice for Gowex if they are serious about their China ambitions. Here’s what we found: 





Please see Appendix C for information on Gowex’s past failures in China. We find that, like most other 


things, Gowex has misrepresented and omitted its China history. 





Gowex’s Recent Cisco “Announcement” 


Many traders became excited when Gowex recently announced “GOWEX and Cisco Announce Global 


Strategic Relationship to Boost Smart Wi-Fi Connectivity Solutions for Cities”. “GOWEX will become a 


Cisco® Smart+Connected Communities™ (S+CC) global strategic partner.” A more careful reading of the 


press releases, however, leads us to ask: Who is paying who?  From the language within the press 


release, it almost sounds as if Cisco is getting paid (perhaps by Gowex). 


Such promotional news releases (involving Cisco) are not new. We’ll leave readers with this past Iber-


x/Cisco “announcement”, which bears a resemblance to recent “news”:

2013 Engineering Revenue < €3 million 


“Minneapolis has had a free wifi deal with a local ISP, US Internet. It’s a 10 year contract worth 


$1.5 million per year for 10 years. This is the largest private/public partnership (in economic 


terms) in the United States. No one else is doing what Minneapolis is doing, citywide. The other 


stuff private operators do is more systems integration. Cities will pay for setup and 


maintenance, but that’s that. There’s not much money to be found there.” – Founder of 


Muniwireless, Esme Vos
1 


Thus far, Gotham City Research has asserted the following, regarding Gowex:  


• Gowex has engaged in a clear pattern of material misrepresentations, since the early 2000s. 


• Nearly all of Gowex’s legacy revenues (i.e. Gowex Telecom) exist, only in paper. 


• Gowex’s true owned/managed hotspot count is ~5% of what the company claims to investors. 


• Gowex’s claim that it earned over €100 million in roaming/offloading and engineering revenues 


in 2013 is too good to be true, given that the supplier of over half of GOW’s network, 


Towerstream, made only $1 million in revenue. Also Gowex’s mobile app freezes frequently, 


user ratings are poor, hotspot quality/speeds are low, and far better alternatives exist.  


In this section, we specifically delve deeply into the Engineering sub-segment
2
:  





We believe 2013 engineering revenues are no more than 10% of the €40 million JB analyst estimate, as:  


• We gathered dozens of municipal contracts (between cities & Gowex). The contracts capture 75% 


of the 5,530 Gowex hotspots, worldwide, and imply Engineering revenue  < €3 million.
Page 25 of 93 





• CEO Jenaro Garcia told us New York City paid Gowex €2 million, while telling other investors that 


NYC was paying Gowex €7.5mm to install free Wi-Fi throughout the city.
3
  


• NYC invested $900,000 in total, split between 5 vendors of (Gowex is 1 of the 5), according to 


NYC officials. We were unable to find any other contracts between New York City and Gowex.
4
 


• There is no free wifi hotspot contract in place between City of San Francisco and Gowex. San 


Francisco is not paying Gowex.
5
 


• Towerstream owns nearly all of Gowex’s US hotspots. Gowex rents these hotspots from 


Towerstream. This limits Gowex’s ability to monetize via wireless setup and installation (a.k.a. 


“systems integration”) as the property & infrastructure doesn’t below to Gowex.
6
 


• Towerstream reported 2013 less than $1 million revenue from its share wireless segment (of 


which only a fraction of that comes from Gowex). Gowex reported €157mm, yet Towerstream’s 


market value is $124 million, and Gowex’s is around $2 billion. 


• CEO Mr. Garcia told investors about a €10mm contract with a public transportation company 


involving Wi-Fi installation on ~1,000 buses. We believe their only relationship with Gowex was 


as part of a free trial in which Gowex had installed Wi-Fi on a handful of buses. We understand 


that the transportation company asked Gowex to withdraw the misleading press release.
7
 


Without revealing any of our evidence of Gowex’s material misrepresentations, we asked Esme Vos, 


Muniwireless industry expert: “What do you know about Gowex?”  


Here are highlights from our conversation: 


• “I don’t know how they make money. Their financials and disclosures are very strange.” 


• “Cities will pay for setup and maintenance of free wireless hotspots, but there’s not much 


money to be found here.”  


• “Gowex doesn’t want people to know they are working with Towerstream.”  


• “I tried to talk to them many times when they came to Silicon Valley last year. I tried to setup a 


meeting. Nothing came of it.”  (Gotham City Research believes CEO Garcia deliberately avoids 


meeting with her and other actual experts, but meets day traders with open arms) 


• “Minneapolis has had a free wifi deal with a local ISP, US Internet. It’s a 10 year contract worth 


$1.5 million per year for 10 years. This is the largest private/public partnership (in economic 


terms) in the United States. No one else is doing what Minneapolis is doing, citywide.” 


• “Philadelphia hired earthlink, for purpose of free wifi, but then they abandoned it. Earthlink 


then had contract negotiations with San Francisco, but abandoned it. Earthlink eventually closed 


down its municipal wireless business. MetroFi is went under after trying to make money from 


muni Wi-Fi networks. There simply has been no viable national free wifi business” 


Esme Vos has followed and chronicled the muniwireless industry, and its economics, longer than 


Gowex’s free wifi business has existed.  Gotham City Research believes her opinions, stated above, are 


very important. That being said, we are confident that even Esme Vos will be shocked (though not 


necessarily surprised) by our findings in this report. In the above-cited conversation, we specifically did 


not share our work or opinions with her, so as not to bias her.

Implied Average Revenue Engineering Revenue per Contract Too High 


Engineering revenue consists of fees cities pay Gowex for the installation and maintenance of free Wi-Fi 


hotspots (also euphemistically referred to as “systems integration”). Gowex claims most of their 


engineering revenue is paid by cities to offer free wifi. Gowex also announced that a handful of 


transportation-related contracts involving Wi-Fi hotspot installation and maintenance. Based on 


Gowex’s press releases, filings, and JB Capital estimates, we find that Gowex’s reported results imply 


that the average revenue per contract (with a city) is around €400,000 per contract
8
: 





Based on actual contracts the average annualized contract value is ~10%-20% of €400,000 (see Appendix 


E). 


While Gowex may sound visionary and noble in its statements regarding “Wireless Smart Cities” we find 


their statements highly manipulative and misleading, for the following reasons: 


• These cities do not belong to Gowex, nor does Gowex have any exclusive relationship with them 


(especially the larger cities, i.e. the ones that financially matter). 


• Gowex does not provide uninterrupted, city-wide free wireless connection.  


• Gowex does not publicly disclose its hotspot counts. We think the focus on “wireless smart cities” 


is a thinly-veiled attempt to distract investors from asking very basic questions.  


• Industry experts (such as Esme Vos) reveal that cities are simply not paying any company 


significant amounts of money to install Wi-Fi hotspots (recall Minnesota is the lone exception). 


And if they are, most payments are for one-off installations. 


Actual Contract-based Derivations Show Gowex’s Engineering Revenues <€3mm 


We gathered dozens of publicly available municipal contracts between cities and Gowex. In some cases, 


such as with San Francisco, we were unable to find a contract – it appears no contract exists. We believe 


our contract sample size covers 75% of Gowex’s 5,530 hotspots. We extrapolate our findings to Gowex’s 


entire hotspot network and conclude that Gowex’s entire revenue from their engineering segment is 


around €2.9mm in 2013 (see Appendix E for a more granular breakdown):

2013 Advertising Revenue no more than €2 million 


“No one has made money from advertising on wifi (specifically free wifi). That’s why Earthlink closed 


down its Muni Wi-Fi business, and why MetroFi went bankrupt after trying to make money from muni 


Wi-Fi networks. ” – Founder of MuniWireless, who has been following the wifi industry for 11+ years
1
  


So if cities are not paying Gowex (at least in the amounts they claim), who is? Advertisers? 





Gotham City Research believes Gowex’s claimed media/advertising revenues are demonstrably false and 


materially inaccurate. For example, if you simply compare Boingo versus Gowex, you find some comical 


results. Boingo has more hotspots, more airport hotspots (which advertisers pay up for), much better ad 


formats and higher prices, and much more traffic. Yet, Gowex generates 3.3x Boingo’s ad revenue?
2 














Is this Possible?


Boingo Gowex


Hotspots with Ads 12,000 5,530


Airport Hotspots with Ads 65 1


Landing Page Traffic Rank 42,227 894,546


App Downloads 451,152 182,848


Ad Revenue (in $ millions) € 9.1 € 30.4
Page 29 of 93 





We believe that actual revenue generated from advertising is no more than €2 million , less than 10% of 


what Gowex tells investors. The following support our belief: 


• Using Boingo’s operating metrics, we calculate Gowex’s advertising revenue in 2013 to be no 


more than €2 million, or less than 10% of the JB Capital Markets analyst’s estimate.  


• Gowex’s ads are of poor quality (static, print display ads). Advertisers pay far less for these. 


Based on market rates for print ads, Gowex’s Ad revenue is far less than our €2 million estimate. 


• We only saw three ads on the Gowex mobile app - H&M, Pepsi, M&M. None of the ‘success 


stories’ on Gowex’s website lists either of these three CPGs, nor any advertising agencies. 


• ‘Geolocalized coupons’ – the ‘coupons’ button on the Gowex app does not work. 


• Jenaro claims free wifi failed in the past because smartphones were not common, implying 


Gowex is successful because of smartphone adoption. His explanation is a ruse, as we show.  


• The Founder of MuniWireless, who has been following the space longer than Gowex has been in 


business said “No one has made money from advertising on wifi (specifically free wifi)”   


Gowex’s Advertising Revenues No More than €2 million Based on Boingo Metrics  


According to JB Capital Markets, Gowex’s Media 2013 revenue is around €30 million
3
: 





We don’t fault the JB Capital Markets analyst, as the €30 million estimate for 2013 is consistent with 


what CEO Jenaro Garcia Martin has privately told investors. We believe Gowex’s revenue from 


ads/media is no more than €2 million, using Boingo-related metrics: 





Gowex 2013 Ad Revenue - calculated with Boingo Metrics


Hotspots with Ads 5,530


Annual Foot Traffic per Hotspot 233,333


Annual Foot Traffic 1,290,333,333


Foot Traffic Conversion Rate 0.99%


Ad engagements 12,759,963


Price per ad engagement $0.21


Gowex 2013 Ad Revenue € 1,931,195
Page 30 of 93 





The ‘Annual Foot Traffic per Hotspot’, ‘Foot Traffic Conversion Rate’, and ‘Price per ad engagement’ 


metrics shown above are based on publicly available information provided by Boingo, as we show below. 


Boingo has 2.8 billion annual visitors, and 12,000+ locations supporting ads
4
: 





Boingo generates 33 million+ ad engagements at airports per year:  





Boingo generates ~60 million ad engagements, in total, per year: 





The non-airport ad engagement metrics above are provided on boingo’s website (see Appendix F for 


screenshots). 








Boingo's Ad Engagements / Year


Airports 33,000,000


hotel 13,000,000


sports bars 6,000,000


subways 3,500,000


Shopping Malls 1,300,000


Stadiums n.a.


City Centers 2,900,000


TOTAL 59,700,000
Page 31 of 93 





Putting all the Boingo operating metrics together, we calculate Boingo’s ‘Annual Foot Traffic per 


Hotspot’, ‘Foot Traffic Conversion Rate’, and ‘Price per ad engagement’ (same as ‘revenue per Ad 


Engagement): 





Note: Boingo’s annual non-airport foot traffic is calculated by subtracting airport foot traffic of 100 


million from total foot traffic of 2.8 billion. Both are available in the images above.  


Why We Believe Gowex’s 2013 Ad/Media Revenue is less than €2 million 


Airports, while small in number, drive over 50% of Boingo’s total ad engagements. According to data 


scraped from Gowex’s Wi-Fi map, Gowex has 1 airport lounge in Belgium. Boingo has 66. Because 


airports (rightfully) generate more ad engagements, they warrant a premium price per engagement. 


This means Gowex’s price per engagement is lower than Boingo’s, which means Gowex’s ad revenues 


are far less than €2 million. But there’s far more evidence to suggest Gowex’ price per engagement is 


not only lower than Boingo’s, it is far lower. 


A Closer Look at Ad Engagements per Revenue  


One way in which free Wi-Fi providers monetize is via advertising on their (1) landing pages (before the 


user is able to surf the web) and (2) mobile apps that they provide.  


Advertising can come in various forms:  


• Display ads,  


• Sponsored connections, (for example, “Free Wi-Fi, provided by Google”)  


• Incentivized app downloads  


• Videos 


As we already demonstrated, advertisers are willing to pay more for audiences in airports. Advertisers 


are also willing to pay more for certain formats (such as video). For example, when you see “Watch this 


video to connect for free” or “Download this app to unlock free Wi-Fi” , these are the more expensive ad

The Boingo website seeks to help advertisers understand the variety of ad formats: 


 
Each formats has a different rate. Passive print/banner ads are priced the lowest whereas others 


command far higher prices:

Note that the first three shown – ‘App Downloads/Email Collection’, ‘Video’ , and ‘Display Ads’ all 


guarantee some form of engagement. 


Gowex’s Ad Quality is Poor & Ad formats are Unsophisticated 


Gowex users access hotspots through either a landing page (Gowex’s advertising platform WILOC.com) 


or via Gowex’s mobile app. Here is a screenshot of the landing page. We never saw a single ad
7
: 











Ad Revenue per Engagement - by Category


App Downloads/Email Collection $1.5000


Video $1.2000


Display Ads $0.4000


Passive Display Ads $0.0002
Page 33 of 93 





We only see Ads, once we scrolled down: 





The only ads on the landing page, WILOC.com are at the bottom of the page.  Users have to scroll down.  


Display ads at the bottom of web pages have only a fraction of the value to advertisers compared to 


those found at the top. The display ads are also very simple print ads. 


If we look closely at the ads, two of them are in Spanish even though this is from a US hotspot. Ironically, 


WILOC stands for “Wi-Fi Location” and is supposed to be a geolocalized content platform (we were not 


in a Hispanic-heavy location).  





The other ad is a booking.com ad. It is likely an affiliate deal. Pricing on affiliate deals are even worse.  


Gowex only gets paid if a visitor successfully books a hotel. When you click the banner, it takes you to a 


booking.com page with affiliate branding on the header: 


(http://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=332146;sid=27ffb8111eadd98bb5e5e19dd4886eb4;dcid=1&l


ang=en-gb).
Page 34 of 93 





Our Observations Apply Equally to iPads, iPhones, PCs and Android Phones 


The ads shown via iPad browser are also of low quality except one display banner at the top: 





iPhone browser: 





We found that the iPhone browser and PC browser appear identical, with the same ads.
Page 35 of 93 





Let’s compare Gowex’s poor landing page ads with Boingo’s landing page ads. The Boingo ad captures 


the full page & requires users to watch the video ad before obtaining wifi access: 





Gowex’s landing page ads are passive display ads (which add least value to advertisers, and generate 


the lowest possible revenue) 





If we attempt to access free wifi through, Gowex’s mobile app, Users are greeted with a static H&M 


David Beckham ad, at the bottom (we found no “geolocalization” we have always been greeted with 


that same ad):
Page 36 of 93 





Once the app loads, we see an ambiguous M&Ms ad (again, no geolocalization. We see the same M&M 


cartoons each time): 





In fact, even after testing 100s of hotspots, we only saw three ads (repetitively): The H&M ad, the 


M&Ms ad, and a Pepsi ad. All were static display ads. 


Boingo’s mobile app, on the other hand, allows its clients to pose app download ads:
Page 37 of 93 





Gowex’s Web Presence and Reach are Very Low 


WILOC.com is so low in the traffic that Alexa does not even have historical data for it. Its global rank is 


894,546 and rank in Spain is only 41,275
8
: 





Boingo’s landing page platform, www.boingohotspot.net, on the other hand is ranked 20X 42,227 


globally: 





See Appendix F for: 


• Similarweb.com traffic rankings showing similar results  


• Finally, total app downloads (iOS + Android combined) since January 2013 for Boingo is around 


450,000, whereas it’s only around 180,000 for Gowex.
Page 38 of 93 





Geolocalized Coupons seem Doubtful 


On its website, Gowex claims

Zoomed in from the ‘Gowex Media’ section: 





We find the above claims untrue, as the ‘coupon’ button on the mobile app doesn’t work:

2013 Roaming and Offloading Revenue < €1 million 


The JB analyst estimates that Gowex generated €78 million of ‘Network’ revenue in 2013
1
: 





The JB analyst’s estimate of €78 million of 2013 ‘Network’ revenue is consistent with what Gowex has 


told other investors (recall, Gowex used to disclose revenues by all these segments up to 2011).  


‘Network’ revenue is equivalent to ‘Offloading’ + ‘Roaming’, per Gowex’s own presentations:
Page 41 of 93 





Gotham City Research believes that actual Gowex 2013 Network revenues are at most 10% of what the 


company claims for the following reasons: 


• iPass only managed to generate $2.4mm in 2013 revenue in their Open Mobile Exchange 


segment on a network of 2.2 million hotspots, or $1 per hotspot per year.  


• Even if Gowex were to monetize on a roaming network of 500,000 hotspots, Gowex’s revenue 


would amount to only ~$500,000 per year, per iPass’s results. 


• Gowex is believed to have 165 Wi-Fi roaming partners, yet there are only 90 companies listed on 


the Wireless Broadband Alliance. 


• Recall, over half of Gowex’s hotspots are owned by Towerstream, who earned just $1 million 


from their shared wireless segment. It’s difficult to believe that Gowex generates 80 revenues 


when the property/infrastructure supplier only earns ~1% of that amount. 


• Industry operators believe Gowex’s claimed 2013 Network Revenue amount exceeds the total 


financial activity in the world, the total market size. They also believe it is simply not possible for 


a Gowex to be monetizing third party networks in this form.
2
  


• Various roaming/offloading “Success story” executives have never heard of, or are mystified by 


Gowex’s revenue claims. Some of these executives said they are not aware of any contract 


between their company and Gowex.
3
 


• Boingo does not even list Gowex as a roaming partner, on their website. 





According to iPass Metrics, Gowex Roaming + Offloading Revenue <€1 million 


iPass is a well-established Wi-Fi aggregator with one of the largest Wi-Fi network footprints in the world. 


Its ‘Open Mobile Exchange’ segment is similar to Gowex’s roaming segment, and only generated 


$2.4mm of revenue in 2013
4
: 








With 2.2 million hotspots worldwide, this means iPass generated about $1 per hotspot per year. So even 


if Gowex was able to monetize on a roaming network of 500,000 hotspots (an estimate the JB analyst 


provide), their comparable revenue would amount to less than $500,000 per year: 





2011 2012 2013


iPass Open Mobile Exchange Revenue $678,000 $786,000 $2,362,000


Gowex Roaming Revenue, as Implied by iPass Metrics


iPass Open Mobile Exchange Revenue $2,362,000


Hotspot network 2,200,000


Revenue per hotspot $1.07


Gowex roaming hotspot count 500,000


Implied Gowex Roaming Revenue € 394,719
Page 42 of 93 





90 Operators Listed on the Wireless Broadband Exchange, yet Gowex Claims 165 Roaming Partners 


The jb analyst says (his language, if you read carefully, is definitive) Gowex has 165 Wi-fi roaming 


partners:
5 


“As of the end of 2013, GOWEX’s footprint includes 83 cities connected with Wireless Smart City 


services (more than 125m inhabitants), more than 20 transport agencies that carry 3.5bn 


passengers per year, 110 countries covered with 165 Wi-Fi roaming partners and 130 telecom 


operators that currently are signed to the offloading and Wi-Fi roaming services.” 


Based on prior precedents – namely, that Jenaro Garcia Martin has provided investors, privately, with a 


breakdown of wireless revenues that are in-line with the JB analyst’s wireless segment estimates – we 


believe all of the information JB analyst provides (that is not in public filings) ultimately originates from 


Gowex. Furthermore, the language the JB analyst uses to describe the ‘165 wi-fi roaming partners’ lacks 


the “I believe”, “we estimate” language. 


165 wifi roaming partners is difficult to believe, given the Wireless Broadband Exchange only lists 90
6
:
Page 43 of 93
Page 44 of 93 





If the # of partners is to be believed, Gowex generates nearly €500,000, per year, in roaming + 


offloading revenue, per partner: 








iPass recently disclosed it had signed up 30 carriers to their Open Mobile Exchange segment
7
. Given that 


iPass has been present in the market for many years we find it difficult to believe Gowex has anywhere 


close to 165 companies paying to access its network. 


Based on conversations with industry experts, €500,000 per partner is difficult to believe. €500,000 per 


partner, at 165 partners, is impossible. 


Ironically, if Gowex has fewer than 165 partners, the revenue per partner becomes even more incredible, 


and its claimed Roaming and Offloading revenue, even more difficult to believe: 








Boingo does not even list Gowex as a roaming partner, on their website 


Gowex lists Boingo as a roaming ‘success story’ on their website

Boingo does not list Gowex as a roaming and offload partner
9
: 








Possible reasons Boingo does not list Gowex as a roaming/offloading partner: 


• Boingo is not a Gowex roaming/offloading partner 


• Boingo is a Gowex roaming/offloading partner, but the wireless usage/activity level is small, and 


the revenues so small, it’s not worth mentioning 


In either case, it supports our belief that Gowex’s true roaming + offloading revenue is less than 10% of 


what the company has claimed it to be.
Page 46 of 93 





Other Serious Warning Signs 


In this section we discuss the softer qualities that support our belief that Gowex is largely a charade. We 


start with the laughable audit fees and Gowex’s auditor. 


Gowex’s Auditor, M&A Auditores S.L. 


Let’s Gowex’s auditor is a company called M&A Auditores, S.L out of Madrid. This company is largely 


unknown even within Spain. Gowex seems to be their only publicly-traded audit client. It is exceedingly 


rare for a $1-$2 billion market value company to choose an unknown auditor. In 2013, Gowex’s audit fee 


totaled €68,500. Boingo and iPass paid $1.7mm and $1.1mm respectively.
1 


We visited M&A Auditores, S.L. office, which was more of an apartment, within an apartment complex 


(in an area that did not seem like an affluent area). The auditor’s “office” was an 8x10 room. There were 


very old looking laptops. We obtained the auditor’s business card
2
: 





He did not have a business email address (which is very strange), so he wrote his gmail account on the 


back of his business card:
Page 47 of 93 





Gowex’s Audit Fee Implies a Business 5%-10% its Purported Size 


Though GOW’s €40,000-€70,000 audit fee does not pass the “smell test” (i.e. the absolute amount), it 


makes even lesser sense once you compare Gowex’s audit fees as a % of its revenues, versus its peers
3
: 





Is a €68,500 audit fee sensible for a company with €182,600,000 of revenue (majority of which is reported to 


be outside Spain), worldwide operations and dozens of subsidiaries? Of course it is not. The absurdly low 


audit fee is supportive of our thesis, that over 90% of Gowex’s overall revenues simply do not exist.  


Our findings and opinions are consistent with the following accounting industry averages
4
: 








According to CFO.com , Public companies with revenues between $25 million and $99 million 


pay an average $419,300 for an audit5 

















Audit Fee as a % of Revenues


2009 2010 2011 2012 2013


Boingo 1.80% 1.86% 1.57%


iPass 0.67% 0.84% 0.97%


Ruckus 0.50% 0.84% 0.48%


Gogo 0.00% 0.46% 0.44%

The Head of Investor Relations is CEO Jenaro Garcia’s Wife, and She Signs off on the Annual Reports 


As if matters cannot get murkier, we found that the CEO’s wife is the head of Investor Relations
6
: 





We found Florencia Mate’s signing off on the 2013 annual report (very last page in the English version):
Page 49 of 93 





If you don’t believe that she is the CEO’s wife, take a look at the Offering Circular filing: 





Gowex Flagrantly Lied to the European Union’s Transparency Register, about its Political Contributions  


GOWEX lied about to the EU’s Transparency Register, about its political spending . It claimed to have 


spent €50 million on political spending
7
: 











Gowex’s lie was so egregious, the Transparency Register commented on its behavior
8
: 


Others, like GOWEX, a telecommunications company  that reported only one client (a Spanish 


municipality), 90 lobbyists and 50 million euros lobby expenditure,  simply updated their entries 


to more realistic numbers (5000 euros and two lobbyists)
Page 50 of 93 





Jenaro Garcia Martin’s Ownership – Does he still own shares?  


The CEO controls Cash Devices SL and Biotelgy SA. Through these two vehicles, Garcia controlled more 


than 50% of the shares.  


It seems Biotelgy SA was dissolved in 2012
9
: 








Given that Biotelgy VC S.A. is a Luxembourg entity, and its status is unclear, we wonder if the CEO 


actually still owns the shares. Who knows, maybe he found a means of secretly selling his shares. 


Listing on the Mercado Alternativo Bursátil (MAB) 


Let’s Gowex was the third company to go public on the MAB, in 2010. MAB was created in 2008, and is 


similar to the United States’ Pink Sheets/OTC or London’s AIM exchanges. These latter exchanges tend 


to attract penny stock frauds, and serial white collar fraudsters. The MAB allows smaller companies to 


float shares, with a more “flexible” regulatory system than is applicable to the main market.
Page 51 of 93 





Jenaro Garcia’s Questionable Behavior via Twitter 


We believe CEO Garcia will have much bigger problems to worry about, but we wonder about the 


legality of saying the following on twitter
10


: 





The CEO boasts about Gowex’s “New York Office”, yet gowex’s website doesn’t list a New York office
11


:
Page 52 of 93 





Gowex’s website doesn’t list a New York office (they may share a New York office with Quindell plc)
12


: 








Based on our investigation, Gowex is likely renting office space from a company called Servcorp. 


Servcorp provides Virtual Office and Short Term Office Rental solutions.  


We think Gowex’s usage of Servcorp validates our belief that Gowex’s operations are only a tiny fraction 


as they report. Given how critical New York is to Gowex, why would the company not establish a more 


permanent New York presence? It makes no sense. 


Jenaro Garcia Martin’s Ties to Stock Fraud Advanced Refractive Technologies

Gowex Shares are Worth €0.00 per Share 


Gotham City Research believes GOW and ALGOW are worth €0.00 per share for the following reasons: 


• GOW’s total actual revenues, as we calculate, are no more than €10 million. There is no value in 


the business as a “going concern.” 





• The company’s debts outweight its cash. The liquidation of the company is a non-positive 


number. We don’t even calculate possible legal costs and liability for its misrepresentations. 


• Because the reported revenues are materially inaccurate (over 90% inaccurate), this means the 


company’s historical profits are inaccurate, and its entire financial statements are false. 


• The dividend is meaningless because it is such a small amount compared against how much 


capital Gowex has raised. 





Those who doubt our findings, should assign a value to the shares no greater than €1.00 per share  


Arqiva snapped up UK public WiFi hotspot operator Spectrum for £23 million
1
. Arqiva had 15,500 access 


points at time of transaction. This works out to value per hotspot of 1,657 euros. Based on this per 


hotspot valuation, GOW is worth between €0.13 and €0.81 per share:  





Even if you were to believe Gowex had 100,000 hotspots, shares would be worth €2.31 per share.

Given there’s precedent whereby Gowex recognized sales to itself (e.g. REDSINFRONTERAS.ORG), we

Appendix C: Gowex’s Past China Foray Failed 


Gowex Failed in China in the Past, and other China-related Findings 


According to the Telecompaper (and found elsewhere), “Iber-X buys ACE for Euro3 mil in cash, shares” : 


Asia Capacity Exchange (ACE) (Hong Kong) has been acquired by Iber-X (Spain), both telecoms 


capacity exchanges, for Euro3 mil in cash and shares. The move marks Iber-X's first foray into 


Asia. The company is especially attracted to the Chinese market, which is due to be liberalised in 


2006, according to Iber-X CEO Jenaro Garcia. Iber-X is considering forming a JV with China 


Telecom and the Chinese govt. The company made a large profit on a Euro42 mil turnover in 


2002, said Garcia. It has over 300 customer in the Iberian peninsula and Latin America who 


conducted Euro300 mil of business through its platform in 2002. – Wednesday 19 March 2003 |

The below circled in red (found in the offering circular), proves Gowex/Iber-x’s past foray into China (via 


their ACE Hong Kong acquisition) failed miserably. Gowex does not even mention, in the offering circular, 


that it was in China in the past, via asia-x.com , nor does it even mention Gowex acquired Ace Asia:
Page 71 of 93 








It gets stranger: Gowex actually names Ace-Asia as a competitor, in its offering circular (with no mention 


of the fact Gowex owns/owned Ace-Asia), with no mention of past ties: 








If you visit the link provided, http://www.ace-asia.com , It redirects to http://www.itquotes.com/ 


In fact, according to wayback machines archives, http://www.ace-asia.com did not exist in 2010 (the 


time of the offering circular):
Page 72 of 93 





The archives redirect to http://www.itquotes.com instead: 


https://web.archive.org/web/20110101134339/http://www.itquotes.com/ 


Archives of Asia-x.com (yes, named just like iber-x.com ) shows it too disappeared, and went in-active 


around the same time iber-x.co did (circa 2003): 


“Asia-X is a subsidiary of Iber-X to expand the business Iber-X has in Europe and Latinamerican 


markets, and is based in Hong Kong.” 





https://web.archive.org/web/20031229053739/http://www.asia-x.com/ 


all the archived versions of asia-x.com look abandoned after 2003 (the website looks as if it no 


longer was updated).

Appendix D: Poor Reviews and De Minimis Customer Service 


Comments from other mediums (e.g. media articles, blogs, etc): 


• “I can see it listed as a possible wifi but the app crashes my HTC a lot. Took about 5-10 min to 


show all the hot spots” http://www.slashgear.com/gowex-free-wifi-hits-nyc-yes-its-real-

Users Complain About Non-existent Customer Service   


A rather comical (but telling) twitter exchange between a Gowex app user and CEO Jenaro Garcia:

The following user also complained about even poorer service. Unfortunately, unlike Alan Peres, he 


didn’t hear back:

Appannie shows poor ratings and not much recognition:
Page 77 of 93 














We think the actual ratings are actually poorer. We suspect that many of the 5 star ratings are from the 


company. For example: 


• Nearly all the 5 star ratings are vague. Doesn’t sound like a user, but gowex employee:

Some actually read like a 1 star rating, but shows as a 5 star:

Estimate of Gowex's True Engineering Revenue

Total Addressable hotspots 4,121                 


Average revenue per hotspot € 522


Total Gowex hotspots per WiFi map 5,530                 


Implied total annual revenue € 2,886,347


Reported Engineering revenue € 40,500,000


Actual Revenue as % of Reported 7%
Page 84 of 93 





Assumptions and notes: 


a. Source: Respective municipal sources & Gowex hotspot map as of April 2, 2014. Gowex has added hotspots since April 


(specifically Chicago and Miami), however, these are Towerstream owned hotspots that Gowex rents. Therefore, as 


discussed in the report, the monetization potential for these hotspots is non-existent to low (especially from an 


‘engineering revenue’ perspective). 


b. For some of the contracts displayed in the prior page, contract duration is unknown. Most contracts are 1 to 4 years 


in duration.  This number is adjusted to assume that unknown contract terms have a period of three years. For 


example a $300,000 contract becomes a $100,000 contract on a yearly basis. 


c. In the ‘estimate of gowex’s true engineering revenue’ in the bottom right hand corner, the ‘Total annual value of all 


contracts found’ is the sum of the values in the column titled ‘Payment per year’ found in the larger table. 


d. ‘Total addressable hotspots’ are the hotspots where we were able to locate a contract. 


e. Average revenue per hotspot = ‘Total annual value of all contracts found’ divided by ‘Total addressable hotspots’ 


f. ‘Total Gowex hotspots’ per WiFi map is the sum of all hotspots. 


g. Implied total annual revenue is the product of ‘Average revenue per hotspot’ and ‘Total Gowex hotspots’ 





Table specific assumptions: 


*Based on our best estimate 


**When info not available we always assumed the value of the contract excluded VAT 


***Contract Terms include €29,000 upfront payment, and €4,000 per year in maintenance payments 


****New York estimated based on $900,000 split between 5 entities.  


*****We understand the prior Orense contract was worth €60,000 per year 


******Understand that this contract was actually awarded to Atlanteam 


Ɨ We tried to match hotspots with specific contracts, however we cannot be 100% certain that specific contracts correspond to 


specific hotspots as many contracts are missing salient information. Also we cannot be 100% certain that we are not missing 


incremental information for hotspots we have already correlated with specific contracts. 


As an illustrative example, see the following contract on the next page:
