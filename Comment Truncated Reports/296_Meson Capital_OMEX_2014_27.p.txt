UK FOIA Shows Odyssey Committed 4 Violations At HMS Victory

Summary


FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) just returned shows that UK Marine Management
Organization (MMO) found OMEX committed 4 violations, concluding its
investigation we reported earlier, issued official warning.


OMEX (nor MHF) appears to have still not submitted an application for a license at
the MMO for HMS Victory project announced 2 mos ago according to MMO website.


SEMARNAT Advisory Council rejects underwater mine: Major Mexican newspaper
this week. Oceanica still "SUSPENDIO" on SEMARNAT website.


Claims of Mexican Government Endorsement by Inapesca is misleading: not an
official statement and not based on any files or official technical opinion according to
updated Mexico FOIA-equivalent.


Cash balance approaching $0 with nearly $30mm debt + payables - will OMEX be
able to make Jan 1 scheduled debt repayment?


Shareholders have heard very little from Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)
lately as the news releases seem to have dried up since the HMS Victory project was
announced nearly 2 months ago with few details. The two biggest current projects for
OMEX are the HMS Victory and the undersea phosphate mine in Mexico, Oceanica. The
SS Central America is still tied up in appeals court after its salvage this past summer. Here
is a brief update on Victory and Oceanica.


One highly interesting new detail just uncovered via the UK Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) is a conclusion to the Marine Management Organization (MMO)'s official
investigation into OMEX which we reported on earlier this year. It was concluded with an
official warning letter to OMEX Dated November 7th, two weeks after the Oct 24
announcement that the HMS Victory was moving ahead by the MOD (Ministry of
Defense).

The full Nov 7, 2014 MMO Warning Letter can be found here


Most interesting is that OMEX was found to have violated the MMO's rules on 4 separate
items. As this was a first offense in the UK and the UK is unable (for jurisdictional reasons)
to use the non-UK evidence such as the Mercedes/Black Swan judgment against OMEX,
the sanction was to issue an official warning letter rather than to prosecute. In addition
according to the UK compliance and enforcement strategy this light sanction was used to
save the government costs of dealing with a further court case.


Importantly - this is now officially in OMEX's record and will make any future violations
MUCH riskier. Given the bull case for the HMS Victory is from selling artifacts that
belonged to passengers or other "trade goods" (a term not officially legally defined) which
appears to be in violation of the UNESCO Annex, this new official warning letter puts a
much higher level of scrutiny on OMEX if they tread around the edges of the rules. In fact,
a second FOIA indicates that OMEX will likely require an independent government
archeologist to monitor their conduct at the site.


According to searches on the MMO website, we still cannot find a license application
submitted yet by OMEX or the MHF for the HMS Victory work. We understand there is a 3
month public comment period once a license is applied for so the clock is still ticking on
that.

-The environmental impact statement contains misinformation and omissions
notes
-In no country has authorized a similar project
-Would jeopardize fishing in exchange for just 80 jobs
-Removal of the seabed cause heavy metal pollution


The state consultative body of SEMARNAT analyzed the environmental impact
statement Don Diego project, involving the removal of phosphate from the seafloor
of the Gulf, noting that principle 15 of theRio Declaration, adopted by the Conference
of United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, consecrated in
June 1992 the precautionary principle, which states that due to the magnitude of the
environmental damage that can cause this type of mining, has not been approved
anywhere in the world .


He warned that the exploitation of the seabed release mercury, cadmium, lead,
arsenic, nickel and zinc, which remain at sea for long periods and whose most toxic
forms are not metabolized.


...


He added that the MIA does not recognize the existence of endangered species and
contains misinformation and omissions, of which gets wrong conclusions, especially
with regard to the effects of noise from dredging and marine traffic in mammals.


According to the council, fishing is very important for local communities and
undermines seriously affect; also not promote sustainable development, as only
create 80 jobs and not just for locals.

Oceanica Government Support?


A recent article suggested that there was a key Mexican government support. This
referred to a Dec 1 article on a Mexican news site government fishing organization
Conapesca supposedly supporting the project. However, a subsequent Dec 3 article
below (the same that highlighted this 'support') provides more detailed information:


Despite the fear of fishermen, Conapesca has no information on marine mining in
Comond√∫

This initial "support" was challenged by an unhappy Mexican citizen who filed the
equivalent of a FOIA request (The System of Transparency Number 081970023414, the
liaison unit of CONAPESCA)


"To this date there are no files, computers or registries from DGOPA of official
letters, documents, emails, attachment or any kind, as well as general information,
through which SEMARNAT requested CONAPESCA its technical opinion, comments
or observations regarding the Don Diego project, and its environmental impact
(including its technical opinion), comments or observations on the Attachments of
such environmental impact. Derived from the aforementioned, I request it to be sent
to the Information Committee a response for a resolution on the lack of information
in this Office in item 1".


The article also notes that CEMDA has not yet sued the project (as would be its typical
tactic) as the laws currently do not even contemplate marine mining so would be
premature to do so. (CEMDA) urged the Mexican government to reform or adapt in order
to allow the appropriate authority to evaluate or punish effectively this extractive activity.


Bankruptcy or Equity Raise Coming in January for OMEX?

The low cash balance begs the question how OMEX could possibly have posted a cash
bond to complete the HMS Victory work that according to the UNESCO Annex is required
up front before work can begin?
