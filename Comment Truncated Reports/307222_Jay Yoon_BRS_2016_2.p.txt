Bristow	Group:	Q4	Results	Heighten	Concerns	Over	Bankruptcy	And
Misleading	Management	Behavior
Jun.	6,	2016	9:00	AM	ET9	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


BRS's	much	worse-than-expected	Q4	2016	results	significantly	increases	the
likelihood	that	it	will	file	bankruptcy	within	the	next	12	months.


Due	to	a	large	projected	decline	in	FY	2017	EBITDAR,	BRS	will	likely	violate	its
renegotiated	senior	secured	leverage	ratio	covenant	sometime	over	the	next	twelve
months.


It	appears	that	the	helicopter	resale	market	further	deteriorated	in	Q4	2016.	Recent
bankruptcy	by	CHC	will	have	a	significant	negative	impact	on	the	sale	leaseback
market.


Management	continues	to	make	seemingly	misleading	and	false	statements	about
various	aspects	of	their	business.


Recent	grounding	of	the	H225	helicopter	could	accelerate	BRS's	path	to	bankruptcy.


After	the	market	close	on	May	25th,	Bristow	Group	("BRS"	or	the	"Company")
(NYSE:BRS)	reported	its	Q4	2016	financial	results.	The	Company	missed	analyst
expectations	by	a	wide	margin	on	both	revenue	and	adjusted	EPS	basis.	Q4	2016
revenue	was	$382mm	(versus	$407mm	consensus)	while	adjusted	EPS	was	just	$0.13
(versus	$0.51	consensus).	The	disappointing	results	were	primarily	attributed	to	an
accelerated	decline	in	the	Company's	offshore	oil	&	gas	("O&G")	revenue	and	profitability.
As	a	result	of	the	worse-than-expected	results,	BRS's	share	price	has	fallen	17.6%	since
earnings	from	$15.48	per	share	(5/25/16)	to	$12.76	per	share	(6/2/16).	Concurrent	with
the	latest	earnings	release,	BRS	also	announced	that	it	had	renegotiated	its	financial
covenants	with	senior	lenders.


The	Company's	latest	earnings	release	confirmed	and	strengthened	many	of	the	key
points	of	my	short	thesis	(found	here).	For	example,	in	my	previous	article,	I	stated	that
the	decline	in	the	Company's	O&G	revenue	would	likely	accelerate	given	the	continued
deterioration	in	the	offshore	industry.	This	is	exactly	what	took	place	in	Q4	2016	as
quarterly	O&G	revenue	declined	15.5%	on	a	sequential	basis.	I	also	stated	that	the

Company's	Q3	2016	UK	SAR	margin	of	68%	was	inflated	and	would	likely	fall	to	a	level
closer	to	the	expected	margin	of	44%.	This	was	confirmed	by	the	Company's	FY	2017	UK
SAR	EBITDAR	margin	guidance	of	mid-to-high	40%.	Finally,	I	stated	that	the	Company
will	likely	struggle	to	raise	liquidity	via	asset	sales	due	to	an	oversupplied	helicopter
market.	This	proved	to	be	true	in	Q4	2016	as	the	Company	only	raised	$0.7mm	from
asset	sales	during	the	quarter.


In	this	article,	I	will	provide	my	revised	outlook	for	BRS's	business.	This	revised	outlook	is
based	on	the	Company's	latest	earnings	release,	as	well	as	other	recent	developments
related	to	the	Company.	To	begin	the	article,	I	will	discuss	why	BRS's	FY	2017	financial
performance	is	likely	to	decline	by	an	even	larger	amount	than	I	originally	anticipated.
Following	this	discussion,	I	will	show	why	the	Company	will	likely	violate	its	recently
renegotiated	covenants	over	the	coming	fiscal	year.	Next,	I	will	discuss	the	continued
deterioration	of	the	helicopter	aftermarket,	as	well	as	the	severe	negative	impact	of	CHC's
bankruptcy	on	the	sale	leaseback	market.	Finally,	to	close	the	article,	I	will	provide	further
evidence	of	misleading	behavior	by	management	and	discuss	why	the	recent	H225
grounding	could	accelerate	BRS's	path	towards	insolvency.


Decline	In	Oil	&	Gas	Revenue	To	Be	More	Severe	Than	Expected


In	my	initial	article	on	BRS,	I	estimated	that	the	Company's	O&G	revenue	in	FY	2017
would	decline	by	25%	relative	to	run-rate	Q3	2016.	In	Q3	2016,	run-rate	O&G	revenue
was	$1.2Bn.	Thus,	assuming	a	25%	decline	from	Q3	2016	run-rate,	I	initially	projected
O&G	revenue	to	decline	by	$300mm	to	$900mm	in	FY	2017.	Based	on	the	Company's	Q4
2016	results,	it	appears	that	my	initial	revenue	projection	for	the	O&G	business	was	overly
optimistic.	In	Q4	2016,	BRS	reported	total	O&G	revenue	of	$255.0mm.	This	represents
$1.0Bn	of	O&G	revenue	on	a	run-rate	basis.	In	just	one	quarter,	the	Company's	O&G	run-
rate	revenue	has	declined	$187mm	or	15.5%	from	$1.21Bn	in	Q3	2016	to	$1.02Bn	in	Q4
2016.	The	current	O&G	revenue	run-rate	of	$1.02Bn	is	just	$120mm	more	than	my	initial
projection	of	$900mm	of	O&G	revenue	in	FY	2017.


Given	the	large	decline	in	Q4	2016	O&G	revenue,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	O&G
revenue	in	FY	2017	will	be	even	less	than	I	initially	anticipated.	Further	supporting	this
assertion	is	the	fact	that	the	deterioration	in	the	offshore	industry	environment	is	expected
to	accelerate	going	forward.	As	mentioned	in	my	previous	article,	offshore	E&P	spending
is	projected	to	decline	at	a	faster	rate	in	2016	than	in	2015	(20-25%	decline	in	2016	vs.
16%	decline	in	2015).	As	I	also	mentioned	in	my	previous	article,	BRS's	top	two	O&G
customers	(Chevron	(NYSE:CVX),	ConocoPhillips	(NYSE:COP))	are	expected	to
dramatically	cut	their	offshore	capex	budgets	over	the	next	couple	years.	In	March	2016,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 3/16


Chevron	recently	announced	that	it	would	cut	offshore	spending	by	an	additional	36%	in
2017	and	2018	compared	to	2016.	Additionally,	in	October	2015,	ConocoPhillips
announced	that	it	planned	to	end	all	of	its	deepwater	exploration	activities	by	2017.


One	item	which	I	did	not	touch	upon	in	my	previous	article	is	the	Chapter	11	bankruptcy
filing	by	CHC	GROUP	("CHC")	(HELIF)	on	May	5th,	2016.	As	part	of	its	bankruptcy
proceedings,	CHC	provided	the	following	update	in	regards	to	the	current	environment	for
offshore	helicopter	operators:


"On	the	production	side…oil	and	gas	companies	have	been	targeting	operational
inefficiencies	in	their	supply	chains	to	reduce	costs.	Pricing	on	existing	contracts
and	new	tenders	has	declined	as	these	customers	have	implemented	cost
reduction	measures	and	have	demanded	significant	price	concessions.	Customers
also	have	started	utilizing	less	frequent	worker	rotations	and	service	patterns	to
increase	their	productivity	of	assets	and	employees,	resulting	in	a	reduction	in	the
number	of	aircraft	required	for	each	contract."


"Some	customers	have	even	started	taking	advantage	of	clauses	in	their	contracts
that	permit	termination	for	convenience	as	they	seek	out	new	contracts	on	the
lowest-price	principle	from	competitors.	CHC's	customers	have	been	able	to	extract
more	and	more	concessions	and	favorable	contract	terms	as	the	market	for	the
remaining	share	of	flight	hours	continues	to	shrink.	Unlike	exploration	revenue
that	may	come	back	as	the	oil	price	rebounds,	these	operational	efficiencies
on	the	production	side	are	margin	negative	for	helicopter	operators	and	will	likely
remain	in	the	supply	chain	even	as	market	conditions	improve."


In	the	past,	BRS	management	has	claimed	that	the	oil	industry	downturn	would	have	only
a	modest	impact	on	its	O&G	production	revenue.	However,	based	on	the	information
provided	in	the	above	quotes,	it	appears	that	this	assertion	by	management	has	proven	to
be	incorrect.	A	renewed	focus	by	O&G	companies	on	operational	efficiencies	has	resulted
in	a	meaningful	decline	in	demand	and	pricing	for	helicopter	services	to	production	sites.
In	FY	2016,	most	of	the	decline	in	BRS's	O&G	revenue	was	due	to	a	decline	in	exploration
&	development	demand.	However,	in	FY	2017,	it	appears	that	BRS's	O&G	revenue	will
come	under	increased	pressure	due	to	significant	declines	in	both	exploration	&
development	and	production	revenue.


I	project	that	the	Company's	FY	2017	O&G	revenue	will	be	20%	less	than	the	current
quarterly	run-rate.	I	believe	this	is	a	reasonable	assumption	given	the	projected	20-25%
decline	in	CY	2016	offshore	capex	and	the	increased	headwinds	that	BRS	faces	on	the

production	side.	Assuming	a	20%	decline	in	O&G	revenue	from	the	current	Q4	2016	run-
rate	of	$1.02Bn,	my	revised	estimate	for	FY	2017	O&G	revenue	is	$816mm.


Before	moving	onto	the	next	section,	it	is	also	worth	noting	that	CHC	management
believes	that	the	declines	in	demand	and	pricing	on	the	production	side	are	likely	to
persist	well	after	oil	prices	recover.	Therefore,	it	is	likely	that	BRS's	O&G	production
revenue	will	remain	depressed	for	several	years.	Given	that	O&G	production	revenue
accounts	for	over	50%	of	BRS's	total	revenue,	it	appears	that	a	recovery	in	BRS's
consolidated	financial	performance	is	also	many	years	away.


BRS	Will	Likely	Violate	Its	Renegotiated	Covenants	In	FY	2017


On	May	25th,	BRS	announced	that	it	had	successfully	renegotiated	its	bank	financial
covenants.	Under	the	terms	of	the	eighth	amendment	to	BRS's	credit	agreement,	the
Company's	existing	financial	covenants	were	replaced	with	two	new	covenants.	First,	the
maximum	leverage	ratio	covenant	was	replaced	with	a	maximum	senior	secured	leverage
ratio	covenant.	In	a	May	25th	8K	filing,	BRS	summarizes	the	key	terms	of	the	senior
secured	leverage	ratio	covenant	as	follows:


"…maximum	senior	secured	leverage	ratio,	defined	as	the	ratio	of	the	sum	of
senior	secured	debt	and	the	present	value	of	obligations	under	operating
leases	to	consolidated	EBITDA	for	the	most	recent	four	consecutive	fiscal
quarters,	which	ratio	may	not	be	greater	than	4.25:1.00	for	each	fiscal	quarter
ending	during	the	period	from	March	31,	2016	through	September	30,	2017,	and
4.00:1.00	for	each	fiscal	quarter	ending	thereafter…"


In	addition	to	replacing	the	leverage	ratio	covenant,	the	Company's	interest	charge
coverage	ratio	covenant	was	replaced	with	a	minimum	current	ratio	covenant.	In	the	same
May	25th	8K	referenced	above,	BRS	summarizes	the	key	terms	of	the	current	ratio
covenant	as	follows:


"…minimum	current	ratio,	defined	as	the	ratio	of	the	sum	of	consolidated	current
assets	minus	the	book	value	of	aircraft	held	for	sale	plus	the	unused	amount	of
aggregate	revolving	commitments	less	$25	million	to	consolidated	current	liabilities,
which	may	not	be	not	less	than	1.00:1.00	as	of	the	last	day	of	each	fiscal	quarter…"


Overall,	the	new	financial	covenants	provide	BRS	with	some	much-needed	covenant
cushion.	As	discussed	in	my	first	article,	the	Company	had	very	little	cushion	remaining
under	its	prior	leverage	ratio	and	interest	coverage	ratio	covenants.	The	following	table

from	slide	39	of	BRS's	Q4	2016	earnings	presentation	summarizes	the	Company's	current
covenant	position:


As	shown	above,	the	Company	currently	has	a	significant	amount	of	cushion	remaining
under	both	of	its	new	financial	covenant	ratios.	Unfortunately	for	BRS,	the	Company's
currently	comfortable	covenant	situation	is	likely	to	be	short-lived.


Due	to	a	large	projected	decline	in	FY	2017	EBITDAR,	I	believe	the	Company	will	likely
violate	its	senior	leverage	coverage	ratio	covenant	at	some	point	in	FY	2017.	In	my	initial
article	on	BRS,	I	estimated	that	FY	2017	EBITDAR	would	be	$317mm.	Based	on	Q4	2016
results,	it	appears	that	this	estimate	was	overly	optimistic.	To	calculate	my	revised
estimate	of	FY	2017	EBITDAR,	I	started	with	the	Company's	Q4	2016	run-rate	EBITDAR
as	a	baseline.	In	Q4	2016,	the	Company	reported	$86.6mm	of	EBITDAR	which	represents
$346.6mm	of	EBITDAR	on	a	run-rate	basis.	Provided	below	is	a	breakout	of	BRS's	Q4
2016	Adj.	EBITDAR	by	segment	on	both	a	quarterly	and	run-rate	basis:


In	their	latest	earnings	release,	the	Company	provided	FY	2017	EBITDAR	guidance	for	its
UK	SAR,	Airnorth	and	Eastern	business	segments.	BRS	did	not	provide	guidance	for	their
O&G	business	due	to	"highly	dynamic"	market	conditions	in	the	offshore	space.	The

following	breakdown	of	FY	2017	guidance	is	from	slide	9	of	the	Company's	Q4	2016
earnings	presentation:


BRS	is	projecting	FY	2017	EBITDAR	of	$95mm-$115mm,	$15mm-	$20mm	and	$15mm-
$20mm	for	the	UK	SAR,	Eastern	and	Airnorth	segments,	respectively.	To	calculate	my
estimate	of	FY	2017	EBITDAR,	I	have	assumed	the	midpoint	of	these	guidance	ranges.	In
regards	to	the	O&G	business,	I	have	assumed	that	FY	2017	O&G	revenue	will	decline
20%	or	$204mm	from	the	current	Q4	2016	run-rate.	In	my	previous	article	on	BRS,	I
estimated	that	the	amount	of	O&G	EBITDAR	decline	as	a	%	of	O&G	revenue	decline
would	be	40%	in	FY	2017.	Multiplying	a	projected	$204mm	decline	in	O&G	revenue	by
40%	results	in	a	projected	O&G	EBITDAR	decline	of	$81.6mm.	Putting	it	all	together,	I
have	provided	below	my	estimate	of	FY	2017	consolidated	EBITDAR:


As	shown	above,	I	estimate	that	BRS	will	generate	$267.4mm	of	consolidated	EBITDAR
in	FY	2017.	For	covenant	purposes,	the	Company	is	able	to	add	back	certain	items	to
EBITDAR.	Provided	below	is	the	Company's	calculation	of	its	Q4	2016	LTM	Covenant
EBITDAR:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 7/16


The	Company	categorizes	its	addbacks	to	Covenant	EBITDAR	into	four	buckets:	non-
cash	stock	compensation,	cash	proceeds	from	asset	sales,	non-cash	FX	impact	and	other
adjustments.	In	regards	to	non-cash	stock	compensation,	BRS	expensed	$4.5mm	in
stock-based	compensation	in	Q4	2016.	Thus,	I	have	assumed	non-cash	stock
compensation	of	$18.2mm	in	FY	2017	($4.5mm	*	4).	In	Q4	2016,	the	Company	sold	a
total	of	5	aircraft	for	total	proceeds	of	just	$0.7mm.	Assuming	$1mm	in	asset	sales	per
quarter,	I	estimate	that	cash	proceeds	from	asset	sales	will	be	$4mm	in	FY	2017.	In	terms
of	non-cash	FX	impact,	based	on	my	assumption	of	flat	exchange	rates,	I	have	projected
that	this	addback	will	be	zero	in	FY	2017.	Finally,	I	have	assumed	that	other	adjustments
will	remain	at	$22mm	in	FY	2017.	Provided	below	is	my	estimate	of	BRS's	FY	2017
Covenant	EBITDAR:


As	calculated	above,	I	estimate	that	BRS's	FY	2017	Covenant	EBITDAR	will	be
$311.5mm.	Assuming	$311.5mm	of	Covenant	EBITDAR,	I	calculated	the	amount	of
cushion	that	would	remain	under	the	Company's	senior	leverage	ratio	covenant:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 8/16


As	shown	above,	if	BRS's	senior	debt	remains	at	$1.28Bn,	I	estimate	that	the	Company
would	have	just	$39.4mm	of	remaining	covenant	cushion.	In	other	words,	if	BRS's	senior
debt	increases	by	more	than	$39.4mm	in	FY	2017,	the	Company	will	violate	its	senior
leverage	ratio	covenant.


It	is	likely	that	BRS's	senior	debt	balance	will	increase	by	much	more	than	$39.4mm	in	FY
2017.	Over	the	coming	fiscal	year,	BRS	is	on	the	hook	for	a	large	amount	of	capital
commitments	and	expenses.	For	example,	as	part	of	their	FY	2017	guidance,	the
Company	provided	the	following	estimates	for	rent	expense,	interest	expense	and	non-
aircraft	capex:


Based	on	the	midpoint	of	the	above	guidance	ranges,	BRS	projects	that	it	will	spend
~$310mm	($220mm	+	$40mm	+	$50mm)	on	rent	expense,	interest	expense	and	non-
aircraft	capex	in	FY	2017.	In	the	figure	below,	I	have	deducted	these	cash	expenses	from
FY	2017	Covenant	EBITDAR:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 9/16


After	deducting	rent	expense,	interest	expense	and	non-aircraft	capex	from	FY	2017
EBITDAR,	the	Company	has	just	$1.5mm	of	remaining	cash	flow.	Basically,	after
deducting	these	expenses,	BRS	has	virtually	zero	cash	left	over	to	pay	for	other	remaining
obligations.	The	Company's	remaining	obligations	include	aircraft	capex,	UK	SAR	capex,
pension	obligations,	letters	of	credit,	contingent	considerations	and	other	purchase
obligations.	To	pay	for	these	remaining	commitments,	BRS	will	have	to	draw	on	its
revolving	credit	facility.	In	FY	2017,	aircraft	capex	and	UK	SAR	capex	alone	are	expected
to	total	almost	$150mm.	This	is	well	in	excess	of	the	Company's	projected	covenant
cushion	of	$39.4mm.	Thus,	it	appears	likely	that	BRS	will	violate	its	senior	leverage	ratio
covenant	in	FY	2017.


Helicopter	Aftermarket	and	Sale	Leaseback	Market	Continue	To	Deteriorate


In	my	previous	article,	I	claimed	that	BRS	would	likely	struggle	to	raise	capital	from	the
helicopter	aftermarket.	Due	to	an	industry-wide	glut	of	unused	helicopter	capacity,	BRS
has	found	it	very	difficult	to	monetize	their	used	helicopters	at	a	decent	valuation.	For
example,	during	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2016,	BRS's	used	choppers	were	only
fetching	an	average	of	~$1mm	per	helicopter	in	the	aftermarket.


Unfortunately	for	BRS,	it	appears	that	the	helicopter	aftermarket	deteriorated	even	further
in	Q4	2016.	The	following	table	is	from	slide	24	of	the	Company's	Q4	2016	earnings
presentation:


As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	BRS	sold	5	helicopters	in	Q4	2016	for	a	measly	total
of	just	$0.7mm.	This	represents	an	average	sales	price	of	just	$140K	per	helicopter.	This
is	substantially	lower	than	the	~$1mm	average	sales	price	that	BRS	was	receiving	in	the
first	nine	months	of	FY	2016.	This	sharp	decline	in	resale	values	is	a	strong	indication	that
the	helicopter	aftermarket	further	deteriorated	in	Q4	2016.	Also,	as	discussed	earlier,	CHC
expects	helicopter	activity	at	production	sites	to	remain	depressed	even	after	oil	recovers.
If	true,	then	helicopter	resale	values	will	likely	remain	low	for	many	years	to	come.	Thus,
at	this	point,	it	appears	that	BRS	has	little	hope	of	raising	a	meaningful	amount	of	liquidity
via	the	aftermarket.

Unfortunately	for	BRS,	recent	developments	in	the	sale	leaseback	market	do	not	look	any
more	promising.	As	detailed	in	a	recent	Rotor	&	Wing	article,	a	US	bankruptcy	court
recently	approved	CHC's	request	to	reject/end	38	helicopter	leases.	In	total,	CHC	hopes
to	cancel	90	of	its	helicopter	leases	through	the	bankruptcy	process.	The	majority	of	the
proposed	lease	cancellations	are	for	large	helicopters	such	as	S-92s	and	H225s.


CHC's	bankruptcy	will	likely	have	a	dramatic	negative	impact	on	the	sale	leaseback
market.	Even	prior	to	CHC's	bankruptcy,	the	balance	sheets	of	lessors	were	already	under
pressure	due	to	idle	O&G	helicopter	capacity.	If	CHC	is	successful	in	returning	90	leased
helicopters	to	lessors,	this	could	push	many	already	distressed	lessors	to	the	brink	of
insolvency.	Consider	the	fact	that	there	are	a	total	of	~1,900	helicopters	serving	the	O&G
market.	If	35%	of	all	O&G	helicopters	are	assumed	to	be	leased	(roughly	in	line	with
BRS's	fleet),	there	would	be	a	total	of	665	leased	helicopters	serving	the	O&G	industry.	In
this	scenario,	the	90	helicopter	leases	that	CHC	is	cancelling	would	represent	13.5%	of
the	total	leased	aircraft	in	the	O&G	space.


Such	a	large	percentage	of	newly	idle	capacity	will	make	it	very	difficult	for	lessors	to	stay
solvent.	At	the	very	least,	even	if	helicopter	lessors	manage	to	stay	solvent,	their	appetite
for	sale	leaseback	transactions	will	be	greatly	diminished.	I	highly	doubt	that	financially
distressed	lessors	will	want	to	engage	in	sale	leaseback	transactions	with	overleveraged
O&G	helicopter	operators.	Thus,	going	forward,	it	is	unlikely	that	BRS	will	be	able	to	raise
a	significant	amount	of	liquidity	via	sale	leaseback	transactions.


Despite	all	of	this	escalating	turmoil	in	the	helicopter	leasing	market,	BRS	management
has	continued	to	make	bullish	comments	about	the	leasing	market	to	investors.	For
example,	during	their	Q4	2016	earnings	call,	BRS	management	stated	the	following
regarding	the	sale	leaseback	market:


"I	mean	the	leasing	market	--	look,	the	leasing	market	on	the	backdrop	of	what's
going	on	in	the	industry	is	an	ever	evolving	market…	We	are	in	regular	contact
with	the	lessors,	they	remain	very	interest	in	the	Bristow	credit	exposure	to
Bristow	and	they	take	really	--	I	mean,	they	tend	to	take	a	longer	term	view	kind	of
through	the	cycle."


"We	have	more	offers	right	now,	well	over	more	offers	to	do	leases	then	we	have
desire	to	do	leases.	And	those	pricing	and	the	rates	on	those	have	only	come
down	actually	as	the	down	manifest	itself	in	the	fourth	quarter.	There's	very	strategic
desire	by	many	of	the	lessors	on	our	U.K.	SAR	assets	and	then	other	assets	too."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 11/16


According	to	BRS	management,	the	leasing	market	for	helicopters	has	remained	strong
through	the	downturn.	Management	claims	that	it	has	received	numerous	offers	to	engage
in	sale	leaseback	transactions	but	has	voluntarily	chosen	not	to	pursue	them.
Management	also	stated	that	lease	rates	have	come	down	during	the	downturn.	These
positive	comments	by	management	about	the	leasing	market	contradict	the	information
provided	in	BRS's	public	filings	and	some	recent	news	articles.	For	example,	in	BRS's	FY
2016	10K,	the	following	disclosure	was	added	to	the	Risk	Factors	section:


"In	May	2015,	a	global	competitor	filed	for	Chapter	11	bankruptcy	protection	and
announced	its	intention	to	reject	leases	resulting	in	the	return	of	approximately	90
leased	helicopters	to	lessors.	This	significant	return	of	aircraft	into	an	already
oversupplied	market	could	undermine	our	ability	to	dispose	of	our	aircraft	and
could	have	a	material	adverse	effect	on	our	business,	financial	condition	and
results	of	operations."


Based	on	this	cautionary	disclosure,	management	does	not	appear	to	be	as	optimistic
about	the	sale	leaseback	market	as	they	have	portrayed	during	earnings	calls.	Also,	BRS
management's	claim	that	leasing	rates	are	declining	is	in	direct	contradiction	to	recent
comments	made	by	Ed	Washecka,	the	CEO	of	Waypoint	Leasing.	In	a	March	2016	article,
Mr.	Washecka	stated	the	following	about	leasing	rates:


"Rents	and	rates	are	also	going	up,	meaning	higher	lease	costs,	but	better
terms	are	still	available	for	the	best	customers…"


Based	on	the	above	examples,	it	appears	that	management	may	be	misleading	investors
regarding	the	true	state	of	the	helicopter	leasing	market.


Management	Continues	To	Misrepresent	Remaining	UK	SAR	Commitments


BRS's	most	recent	earnings	release	raised	additional	red	flags	regarding	the	conduct	of
management.	As	I	just	discussed,	during	their	Q4	2016	earnings	call,	management
provided	a	seemingly	misleading	assessment	of	the	helicopter	leasing	market.
Unfortunately,	management's	questionable	behavior	during	the	earnings	call	did	not	end
there.	When	an	analyst	asked	about	BRS's	remaining	UK	SAR	commitments	during	the
Q&A	session,	management	stated	the	following:

"…as	you	know,	in	terms	of	how	this	shows	up	on	the	either	of	the	cash	flow
statement	or	the	balance	sheet.	A	large	part	of	that	actually	flows	through	in	pre-
op	costs…So	as	you	could	see,	we	had	heavy	CapEx	there	or	heavy	capital
outlays	for	pre-op	costs	because	of	the	startup,	which	was	heavy	in	FY'	16.	You
don't	really	have	anything	in	'17	although	we	have	to	do	some	training	there…"


BRS	management	claims	that	the	Company	spent	a	large	amount	of	capital	on	pre-
operational	costs	in	FY	2016.	Based	on	information	available	in	the	company's	public
filings,	this	claim	by	management	does	not	appear	to	be	true.	UK	SAR	pre-operational
costs	are	capitalized	on	the	Company's	balance	sheet	as	either	a	Prepaid	Expense
(current	asset)	or	an	Other	Asset	(long-term	asset).	Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of	the
Company's	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	at	the	end	of	FY	2015	versus	FY	2016:


As	shown	above,	the	Company's	total	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	increased	just
$15.9mm	from	Q4	2015	to	Q4	2016.	In	FY	2016,	the	Company	amortized	$10.0mm	of
pre-operational	costs	as	an	expense	in	its	P&L.	Based	on	this	information,	I	estimate	that
BRS	spent	a	total	of	$25.9mm	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	in	FY	2016:


With	this	in	mind,	consider	the	fact	that	BRS	originally	estimated	it	would	have	to	spend	a
total	of	almost	$200mm	on	capitalized	UK	SAR	pre-operational	costs	by	the	end	of	CY
2015.	Provided	below	is	a	breakout	of	BRS's	projected	UK	SAR	commitments	(from
BRS's	2013	Analyst	Day	presentation):

As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	the	Company	estimated	that	it	would	have	to	spend	a
total	of	$195mm	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	(from	Dec.	2012	to	Dec.	2015).	By
comparison,	the	total	amount	of	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	on	BRS's	balance	sheet
was	just	$67.2mm	as	of	3/31/16.	Also,	in	the	table	above,	management	originally
projected	that	it	would	have	to	spend	$90mm	on	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	in	CY
2015.	However,	in	FY	2016	(roughly	equivalent	to	CY	2015)	I	estimate	that	BRS	only
spent	$25.9mm	in	capitalized	pre-operational	costs.	Based	on	this	low	amount	of	actual
pre-operational	costs	incurred,	management's	claim	that	BRS	had	"heavy	capital	outlays
for	pre-op	costs"	in	FY	2016	is	simply	not	true.


In	summary,	I	claimed	in	my	previous	article	that	management	was	understating	its
remaining	UK	SAR	commitments	by	almost	$200mm.	The	above	analysis	regarding
BRS's	capitalized	pre-operational	costs	provides	further	strong	support	for	this	claim.
Thus,	I	continue	to	believe	that	BRS's	capital	commitments	over	the	next	two	years	are
much	greater	than	what	management	has	portrayed	to	investors.


A	Few	Final	Thoughts	on	Q4	2016	Earnings


To	wrap	up	this	article,	I	will	touch	upon	a	few	additional	items	regarding	the	Company's
Q4	2016	results.	In	its	Q4	2016	earnings	release,	BRS	highlighted	that	it	achieved	a	20%
increase	in	liquidity	during	the	quarter.	However,	investors	should	note	that	this	increased
liquidity	was	primarily	driven	by	a	couple	of	things.	First,	the	Company	benefitted	from	a
large	sequential	decrease	in	net	working	capital	in	Q4	2016.	Boosting	liquidity	via	net
working	capital	decreases	is	one-time	in	nature	and	does	not	represent	a	sustainable
increase	in	cash	flow	generation.


In	addition	to	a	decrease	in	net	working	capital,	it	appears	that	BRS	also	boosted	its
liquidity	by	not	fulfilling	the	majority	of	its	other	purchase	obligations.	The	following	table	is
from	BRS's	Q3	2016	10Q:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 14/16


As	highlighted	above,	BRS	disclosed	that	it	had	$123.7mm	of	other	purchase	obligations
coming	due	in	Q4	2016.	Other	purchase	obligations	consist	of	misc.	capex	items	like
aircraft	parts,	facility	upgrades	and	power-by-the-hour	maintenance	commitments.	In	Q4
2016,	the	Company	spent	a	total	of	just	$29.0mm	on	capex.	This	is	far	less	than	the
$123.7mm	of	other	purchase	obligations	that	were	supposed	to	be	due	in	the	quarter.
Thus,	it	appears	that	BRS	did	not	pay	the	majority	of	its	projected	other	purchase
obligations	in	the	quarter.


I	am	not	exactly	sure	how	management	was	able	to	avoid	paying	most	of	its	other
purchase	obligations.	I	do	not	believe	these	obligations	were	cancelled,	given	that	there
was	no	announcement	from	the	Company.	Instead,	I	believe	that	BRS	will	have	to	pay	for
these	unpaid	obligations	at	some	point	in	the	near	future.	Therefore,	it	appears	that	BRS
may	have	significantly	more	other	purchase	obligations	coming	due	than	what	has	been
disclosed	to	investors.


One	other	point	of	concern	for	BRS	shareholders	is	the	recent	grounding	of	the
Company's	H225	helicopters.	BRS	was	ordered	to	suspend	operation	of	20	of	its	H225
helicopters	following	the	recent	crash	of	a	CHC	H225	helicopter	in	Norway.	Based	on
recent	news	reports,	it	appears	that	the	H225	model	may	be	inherently	flawed	and
helicopter	operators	may	be	forced	to	ground	the	H225s	permanently.	According	to	the
Company,	the	permanent	grounding	of	H225s	could	have	a	significant	negative	impact	on
BRS's	financial	performance.	Consider	the	following	disclosure	from	BRS's	FY	2016	10K:

7/18/2019 Bristow Group: Q4 Results Heighten Concerns Over Bankruptcy And Misleading Management Behavior - Bristow Group Inc. (NYSE:BRS) | Seeking …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3979939-bristow-group-q4-results-heighten-concerns-bankruptcy-misleading-management-behavior 15/16


"…on	April	29,	2016,	an	incident	occurred	with	an	Airbus	Helicopters	H225	Super
Puma	helicopter…This	incident	resulted	in…cessation	of	operations	of	a	total	of	20
large	Airbus	Helicopters…	If	other	operators	experience	accidents	with	aircraft
models	that	we	operate	or	lease,	obligating	us	to	take	such	aircraft	out	of	service
until	the	cause	of	the	accident	is	rectified,	we	would	lose	revenue	and	might	lose
clients.	In	addition,	safety	issues…could	result	in	clients	refusing	to	use	that
particular	aircraft	model	or	a	regulatory	body	grounding	that	particular	aircraft	model.
The	value	of	the	aircraft	model	might	also	be	permanently	reduced	in	the
market	if	the	model	were	to	be	considered	less	desirable	for	future	service	and
the	inventory	for	such	aircraft	may	be	impaired."


As	highlighted	in	the	quote	above,	it	appears	that	the	grounding	of	the	H225	could	result	in
a	loss	of	revenue	and	clients	for	BRS.	Also,	if	the	H225	is	permanently	grounded,	BRS
would	have	to	take	an	impairment	charge	on	the	value	of	its	fleet.	The	H225	is	a	large
helicopter	type,	so	the	reduction	in	BRS's	fleet	value	from	an	H225	grounding	would	likely
be	significant.	Given	BRS's	already	stressed	financial	position,	the	grounding	of	the	H225
could	prematurely	push	the	Company	into	bankruptcy.


Conclusion


At	this	point,	I	believe	that	there	is	little	hope	for	BRS's	equity	to	survive	this	downturn.
The	Company's	run-rate	EBITDAR	is	now	just	$347mm.	This	amount	of	EBITDAR	is
barely	enough	to	cover	BRS's	annual	rent,	interest	and	maintenance	capex	expenses.
Given	the	further	large	declines	projected	in	the	offshore	market	in	CY	2016	and	CY	2017,
it	is	likely	that	FY	2017	EBITDAR	will	be	well	below	$300mm.	To	make	matters	worse,	the
Company	faces	a	multitude	of	other	headwinds	(H225	grounding,	CHC	cancellation	of	90
leases)	which	will	likely	place	further	stress	on	its	financial	performance.	Therefore,	I	see
little	chance	that	BRS	can	meet	its	over	$1Bn	in	capital	commitments	over	the	next	2
years.	I	feel	even	more	strongly	that	BRS	will	eventually	file	for	bankruptcy.	Thus,	despite
the	large	decline	in	share	price,	I	believe	that	BRS	is	still	a	tremendous	short	opportunity.
