Francesca's: Investors In For Nasty Surprise Next Week
Aug. 28, 2013 9:30 AM ET33 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Investment overview


After releasing results that were actually in line with expectations last quarter, shares of
Francesca's Holdings (NASDAQ:FRAN) have now declined by around 25%. Following last
quarter, management had hoped that aggressive promotions and discounting were
coming to an end. But an analysis of these promotions shows that they have actually
accelerated rather than declined. Given the premium valuation, a "miss" at Francesca's is
likely to have a very dramatic effect on the share price. Francesca's comps Abercrombie &
Fitch (NYSE:ANF) along with Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO) both showed one-day drops of
around 20% based on very tiny misses announced in the past two weeks. As shown
below, a miss by Francesca's is now almost a certainty and will likely take the stock down
to the $16-19 level.


Background


For much of its life as a public company, Francesca's has been a Wall Street darling. The
stock has commanded a notably premium price due to the company's ability to
consistently deliver both blistering double digit growth along with dramatically outsized
margins of nearly 60%.


Heading into last quarter, the stock was clearly priced for continued perfection, trading up
to around $32.00. By this time, it was clear that delivering on high expectations was not
enough. Additional "surprises" had become fully expected, and this would be necessary to
support the share price.


In actuality, Francesca's did not even disappoint. Revenues were $79 million vs.
expectations of $79.6 million. Net income was $10.9 million, just in line with expectations.


Yet despite the "in line" performance, the share price quickly dropped by 10-15% in the
days that followed. Over the subsequent weeks, Francesca's has continued to drop and is
now down by around 25% from its pre-earnings levels.

Some of the more recent weakness has been due to the continued earnings
disappointments from Francesca's peer group.


General retailers such as Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have seen
moderate overall declines. Competitors such as the Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Express
(NYSE:EXPR) have seen declines of 7-10% despite strong results. Even Urban Outfitters
(NASDAQ:URBN) is down for the month, despite very strong results.

The sharpest decliners in the past week or so were Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale,
both of which showed one-day declines of 20% even though their earnings misses were
rather mild. These sharp drops followed the already significant declines which had
occurred over the past 60 days or so (which affected most retailers as a whole).


One thing that has continued to support Francesca's share price from further declines has
been the previous statements from management that:


As it relates to gross margin and the potential promotional cadence, clearly we will
be much less promotional as the weather dynamic subsidesâ€¦. And as a result, our
merchandise margins should be substantially similar to what they might have been
in the prior year quarter.


The ability to sell without heavy discounting has been of paramount importance in
justifying the lofty share price of Francesca's.


In a research note to investors, JPMorgan stated that the "Secret Sauce" for Francesca's
continues to be the fact that the markdown rate is "less than 10%." According to
JPMorgan, "This compares to other mall based retailers that have 3-6 month lead times
and buy much deeper and have markdown rates that are north of 30%."


But we can clearly see that this quarter has not been working out according to the hopes
of both management and JPMorgan.

Following the statements on the last conference call, I began making in person visits and
phone calls to a number of Francesca's stores so that I could personally monitor the
progression of the discounting activities.


We can see that management clearly did have every intention of winding down the
discounts.


In some cases, the promotional activities were originally being limited in their scope in a
combination of three ways:


- limited time frame (including 1 day "flash sales")


- limited availability (internet purchases only)


- limited items (discounts apply to select items such as shoes only)


But time has progressed, we can see that each of these limitations has fallen away.


- Short duration sales were repeatedly extended


- Internet only sales were expanded to all in-store locations


- Discounts were offered on all merchandise both via internet and in-stores

Finding an extensive list of these promotions is easy and only requires readers Google the
terms "Francesca's Discounts." They are listed everywhere. Alternatively, visiting a few
Francesca's stores will reveal the same thing.


We can now see that during the last quarter, there were significant sales underway at
almost every point in time.


With the majority of merchandise on sale and for the majority of days of the quarter, it now
becomes mathematically impossible for Francesca's results to deliver the "less than 10%
Secret Sauce" as described by JPMorgan. This is just a simple function of the math
involved.


In general, we can see that the most common sale is the BOGO ("buy one get one") for
50% off.


We can also see other substantial discounts of 30% on a wide variety of items.


In general, for any given purchase made through Francesca's, the discounts have now
accelerated to a point where customers can expect to get from 25-50% off the price.
These discounts have applied to most of the merchandise and on most of the days in the
quarter.


Overall, what we will almost certainly see this quarter is that the discount rate for
Francesca's is coming in at around 25% - right in line with all of the other retail
competitors. The fact that the "Secret Sauce" is no longer working will almost

automatically cause shares of Francesca's to trade more in line with its peers, which
implies a drop from current prices of at least 20-25%.


Christine Day, the former CEO of lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), once clarified the reason
why lululemon never entered the slippery slope of sales and discounts. Once you start
offering these discounts, you are effectively "training" your customers to expect them. It
does not take long before customers will walk in to a store to find items that they like, and
then walk right back out without purchasing them. They quickly learn to just wait for the
sales which they know will be just around the corner.


This is what has now happened to Francesca's. And it really only took one quarter for the
"training" to take full effect. In order to boost sales in Q1, Francesca's ended up "training"
customers to wait for discounts. It is now the case that the use of these discounts is
becoming more of a necessity in order to entice consumers to actually make a purchase.


Anyone who has been to a Francesca's store in the past 2-3 months will know that the
sale and discount signs are now what lure in the customers. There are typically 2-3 large
signs touting the deep discounts in all of the front store windows of any Francesca's. This
is notably different than the situation just 9-12 months ago.


Concerns over same-store sales


The jet fuel behind Francesca's valuation has consisted of two things: stellar margins and
exceptional growth.


The discounts are now having a visible impact on margins and that impact looks set to
worsen. Francesca's margins have a long way to fall before normalizing. Last quarter,
margins fell by 70 bps to around 52%. But margins for virtually every similar competitor sit
somewhere around 32-38% - as much as 20% lower than Francesca's. Francesca's
margins have declined from closer to 60% and continue to converge with those of the
competition.


But the second part of this equation (growth) has also been cause for concern. Last
quarter, Francesca's reported same-store sales growth of just 2%. Revenues showed a
slight decrease (around 10%) vs. the previous quarter, but that decline was in part due to
a 53 week accounting year which boosted Q4.


The real source of Francesca's growth continues to be the opening of new stores. In the
first quarter alone, Francesca opened 56 new boutiques. This takes their planned
boutique base up to 445, putting them at around 50% of their 900 store target.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1661052-francescas-investors-in-for-nasty-surprise-next-week 7/62


The reason for concern here is obvious. It should be expected that opening new stores will
add to revenues. But the complete stagnation of revenues from existing stores is highly
problematic. Investors are aware that many of these stores were the result of the recent
expansion and have been opened just recently. Yet within two years, they are already
showing same-store growth which is dwindling towards zero.


If we look closer, the tiny 2% growth in same-store sales actually now includes the "direct
sales" which come via the website. If we strip out those sales, then the performance of
existing stores is actually showing almost no growth whatsoever.


If the stock were on a more normalized valuation, the impact of this trend might not be too
severe. But with Francesca's still trading on a PE of around 22-24x, the stock could easily
come down by 20-25% just due to the downtick in same-store sales alone.


Management has already given guidance that same-store sales is set to decrease even
further to just 1-2%. Depending on the impact of direct sales, this could then actually be
implying slight declines in same-store sales. This is a very challenging result for investors
to digest for stores which have now only been open for around 2 years.


It is even more difficult to digest with Francesca's still trading on one of the highest
multiples in the space.


Now it becomes very clear what is happening. Management is trying to juggle margin
pressure vs. declining same-store sales growth. The only way to maintain any positive
growth in SSS is to continue offering deeper discounts to lure in the shoppers.


With SSS quickly approaching zero, there is clearly more wiggle room with margins. As a
result, the discounts and promotions have accelerated substantially.


Two years ago, same-store sales were hitting 15%. One year ago, they were still hitting
10%. Now they are basically hitting zero.


It is now becoming clear to investors that no one (including Francesca's) has a sustainable
"secret sauce" which allows them to a) sell with abnormally high margins while b) growing
sales at a lightening clip. In the end, investors are coming to terms with the fact that
Francesca's is just another retailer which must cut prices (and margins) in order to
maintain traffic.


With almost 450 stores, it is now the case that each store is only doing about $60,000 per
month in revenues - only about $2,000 per day. Francesca's continues to invest heavily in
new stores to grow revenues by this incremental $2,000 per day, but the existing stores

are flattening out so quickly that there is very little room for any meaningful organic growth
for the company.


Short interest reveals longer-term concerns over margins


Anyone who follows Francesca's is likely aware that it has been one of the most heavily
shorted stocks on any US exchange. Total short interest has typically ranged from 30-40%
of total shares outstanding. It is huge. At times, the value of the short bet has exceeded
$600 million, indicating that it's institutions that have taken a deeply held view to the
negative side.


Heading into earnings last quarter, the stock was rising strongly, briefly hitting $32.00. At
that time, the short bets increased dramatically to over 14 million shares. The large short
bets have paid off for those investors. With the stock now down by 25%, the short interest
has fallen off a bit. But even with the stock now down by around 25%, the short has
stayed stubbornly high. Despite the gains already banked, the shorts continue to bet on a
much steeper decline than the 20-25% expected by an earnings miss next week.


Some of the larger concerns have already been touched upon by various articles in both
Barron's, Seeking Alpha and other locations. But each of these articles only raised their
own general concerns without actually delivering a conclusion.


Underlying various short theories is the fact that Francesca's largest suppliers have been
owned by family members of the founding management of Francesca's. These suppliers
have supplied roughly 20-25% of total inventory. But Francesca's has declined to disclose
the purchase terms or margins of the products that it gets from these sources. It has
disclosed that its suppliers are responsible for the ability to generate Francesca's ultra fast
turnaround time of just 4-6 weeks.


The suppliers involved are KJK Trading and Stony Leather. In total, around 20-25% of
Francesca's purchases had come from these two suppliers. With KJK, it is clear that the
company does not even have a single other customer aside from Francesca's.


The supplier only does business with Francesca's and no one else. KJK even operates
out of the same building as Francesca's in Houston. Prior to the IPO, KJK did not even
pay rent to Francesca's for the space. Following the IPO, a token rent of $1,000 was set. If
we look further, we can see that Francesca's discloses that it does not even maintain
supply contracts with these suppliers.

KJK has been owned and run by Ki Juing Gu. Mr. Gu is the brother-in-law of Ms. Insuk
Koo, a founder of Francesca's as well as Kyong Gill, founder and former EVC of
Francesca's. Mr. Gu also owns KKGM,which also supplies to Francesca's. Like KJK,
KKGM does not have any other customers other than Francesca's. It is basically a captive
supplier.


These are the details which Barron's and other Seeking Alpha articles failed to
uncover.


So then KJK is owned by a relative. It does no business with anyone other than
Francesca's and it even operates out of the same building as Francesca's. The parties
see no need to maintain supply contracts.


Based on these facts, it feels very much like a de facto subsidiary.


Likewise, with Stony Leather, the company discloses that:


Chong Yi and Insuk Koo (two of the four Founders) own and operate Stony. Mr. Yi
and Ms. Koo are brother and sister. Mr. Yi and Ms. Koo along with their sister Ms.
Kyong Gill (our Executive Vice Chairperson and one of the four Founders) are
stockholders of Francesca's. Our relationship with Stony is that of an independent
third-party vendor.


(NOTE TO READERS: Gu and Koo are two different English ways of spelling the same
exact name in Korean. These different spellings refer to the same last name which
belongs to these members of the same family.)


For most businesses, such a contrived effort to maintain separate ownership would make
no sense. However, there are certain benefits and activities which are only possible via a
separate relationship (non subsidiary) such as this.


The shorts are well aware that this type of relationship persisted for a few years. During
this time, Francesca's commanded a premium valuation.


Given that management was less than half way into a massive expansion up to 900
stores, many have felt that it was notably odd timing for management to exit the company
in the past year.


Following their resignation from Francesca's, the family's involvement is now strictly with
the suppliers to Francesca's, rather than with Francesca's itself.

Theory number one is that this arrangement has allowed Francesca's to import goods
without declaring full value to customs. Francesca's could thereby obtain its goods at a
much lower cost, boosting margins.


For the past year, KJK has bought 100% of its goods from a single supplier, Shen Li
Wang. (Customs records are included as Appendix I).


Once again, Shen Li Wang appears to have almost no customers other than KJK and
KKGM. KKGM also supplies to Francesca's, and is also owned by brother-in-law Gu.


Again, KJK supplies to just one company, Francesca's. In addition, KJK itself has just a
single supplier, Shen Li Wang. And 95% of Shen Li Wang's business over the past two
years has been with just two customers, KJK and KKGM. Both of these companies supply
only to Francesca's and both are owned by Mr. Gu, the brother-in-law of the founder of
Francesca's (Kyong Gill).


Likewise, Stony is run by the brother and sister of Ms. Gill.


Given that ownership is held exclusively by the brother-in-law of Francesca's founder and
has no actual customers other than Francesca's, it raises the question of why this
company needs to give the appearance of operating as a freestanding company. Why not
just call them what they are - "subsidiaries?"


Clearly a publicly listed company such as Francesca's would never under-declare the
value of imported goods to customs. They would simply have too much to lose and the
consequences would be permanent.


But if its "separate" supplier were found to have under reported, there would be no
consequences to Francesca's. The supplier would simply shut down and then reopen
using a different name, continuing to supply to Francesca's. Since no one knows the
ultimate location of the factories in China, there would be no way for anyone to claim that
this was an identical company.


So far, this is just a theory among shorts and it is one of the reasons which explains the
huge and persistent short interest in Francesca's. The bet is either that the scheme will
unravel or else it will simply come to an end, now that the family members are no longer
part of Francesca's.


Some of this theory has been supported with the difficulty in actually finding a permanent
factory location for anything connected with ultimate sole supplier Shen Li Wang. It is also
supported by the fact that the name of the supplier to KJK seems to change dramatically

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1661052-francescas-investors-in-for-nasty-surprise-next-week 11/62


after 2 years. This can be seen in the customs records in Appendix I.


Theory number two is that the several suppliers from above (which are owned by family
members) have simply been passing the goods on to Francesca's without making a profit
themselves. This is clearly not sustainable.


The reason for engaging in this practice would be what is knows as "multiple arbitrage."
The suppliers are private companies. A profit of $1,000 is just that, a benefit of $1,000. But
Francesca's is a publicly traded company which trades on a high PE of 25-30x. As a
result, a incremental profit of $1,000 results in a real incremental benefit of
$25,000-$30,000.


By posting spectacular margins for the two years since coming public, founders of
Francesca's caused the stock to trade at a premium price. Now that several years have
passed as a public company, the founders are left owning little to no stock and have
resigned from their positions at the company.


Now that they are gone, margins have been coming steadily down and are approaching
those of other competitors in the business.


In the end, it doesn't really matter WHY Francesca's had constructed the contrived
"independent" relationship with its suppliers. What really matters to the shorts is that the
relationships are clearly controlled by family members who had every incentive to provide
Francesca's with unsustainable, non-market prices in order to help margins.


The real "secret sauce" for Francesca's has come from its ability to obtain goods at such a
low cost that it can maintain gross margins of 50-60% while obtaining 4-6 week
turnaround times. The suppliers are the actual secret sauce.


Yet in the years that followed the IPO (and while the founders were still involved at
Francesca's), these suppliers refused to do business with anyone other than Francesca's.
This was the case even though they had no supply contract with Francesca's to ensure
future business OR to prevent the suppliers from doing business elsewhere.


The founding family management has left Francesca's and no longer has any meaningful
equity stake in Francesca's. Instead, they now have a stake in the suppliers.


But what it really comes down to is the fact that Francesca's has somehow been able to
achieve spectacular margins of 50-60% in a business where every other competitor
seems to come in at a nearly identical 32-38%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1661052-francescas-investors-in-for-nasty-surprise-next-week 12/62


It is also the case that Francesca's has historically obtained a large portion of the goods it
sells from family members who engage in no other business other than selling to
Francesca's through their small private companies.


Now that the founding management family has left Francesca's, we have begun to see
consecutive quarters of margin contraction.


As shown above, this margin contraction is also suffering from the demand side of the
equation, with Francesca's cutting prices at an accelerating rate in order to maintain
same-store sales growth.


The factors all point to the same conclusion: that Francesca's does not have the "secret
sauce" to maintain huge margins and spectacular growth.


This is almost certain to make itself apparent on Francesca's earnings call next week and
the stock will almost certainly take note.


Meeting expectations last quarter led to a 25% decline in the stock price. The only thing
supporting the stock at current levels is the hope which was communicated by
management that the use of discounts would be declining in this quarter, helping to
support margins. But once we see that discounts have actually increased, we can be
almost assured that Francesca's will by default miss earnings.


Appendix I - Customs Records for Francesca's Suppliers


The following table shows all imports into the United States from Shen Li Wang Ltd over
the past two years. More than 95% of the imports are to just two companies (KJK and
KKGM) both of which are controlled by Mr. Gu, and both of which supply only to
Francesca's.
