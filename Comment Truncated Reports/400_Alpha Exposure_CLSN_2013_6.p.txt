Since we began publishing on Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLSN), we have highlighted
the many differences between what Celsion has been telling investors and the depressing
reality of its business.


First, it should be made clear that Celsion's Phase III HEAT trial was a complete failure,
both for the Company and for investors. After 5 years and over $95 million of losses, the
HEAT trial showed that using Thermodox was no different than a placebo as there was no
difference between the treatment and control populations. Investors took a bath.

Yet, in numerous press releases following the failed HEAT trial, Celsion has published
post-hoc results. When it published these results, Celsion chose data from trial
populations that were not pre-specified and are therefore statistically meaningless.
Historically, we have observed that when small biotechs engage in data mining, it is in an
effort to pump up their share prices. Unfortunately for Celsion, none of its post-hoc

analysis have been statistically significant. As we've explained in previous articles, post-
hoc analysis should be viewed with extreme skepticism (here). Essentially, post-hoc
analysis allows a company to data-mine for the best possible results. Therefore, it is pretty
shocking that Celsion has done this numerous times and still cannot find results that are
statistically significant.


We believe that every time Celsion publishes statistically insignificant results based on
data mining, they are hoping to get investors excited and to drive up the share price.
Celsion must do this because they need millions of dollars of funding in order to survive
and pursue another costly Phase 3 trial. Over the course of the original Phase 3 HEAT
trial, not only did Celsion burn over $95 million dollars, but they also had to dilute
shareholders more than three times - the share count increased from 10 million shares in
Q1 2008 to over 35 million at the end of 2012. There are over 60 million shares
outstanding today.


Today's Data is Not New


This morning's release of updated post-hoc results was supposed to be incremental;
however, we fail to see how today's press release sheds any new meaningful insight. It's
clear when comparing these results (here) with the previous update from September
(here), that there has been no meaningful change:

The most important point to take away is that the post-hoc analysis continues to fail to
show statistical significance.


Beware of Upcoming Dilution
