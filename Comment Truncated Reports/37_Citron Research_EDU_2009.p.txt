CITRON RESEARCH
REPORTS ON NEW
ORIENTAL EDUCATION
AND TECHNOLOGY
(NYSE:EDU)


 


One of the great challenges of investing in
companies in “emerging markets” is valuation. 
What is a fair price and what is overvalued?  Well
for many investors the answer comes too late.


Come on Down …. and get Acquainted with
New Oriental Education and Technology Group
(NYSE:EDU)


This company o�ers private education services in
China.  It runs classes for both schoolchildren and
adults, with a special emphasis on teaching English
to Chinese adults.


“Historically, our core businesses have been English
language training for adults and test preparation
courses for college and graduate students. “  EDU –
20-F  10/23/2008


Turning to the numbers, EDU’s backward facing PE
for 2008 is a jaw-dropping 40.  Its market cap of
1.85 billion has it valued at a price to sales of over
9:1.  This is number so stratospheric there are
virtually no cases in recorded �nancial history of it
being sustainable.


Yet, there is no doubt there is demand for
education, and in particular, teaching English in

China.  However, this is a sector with no discernable
barrier to entry — the company is not teaching for
degrees and therefore does not need accreditation.


In February of 2009, EDU lowered earnings
dramatically, and the share price took a 20% hit,
showing a slowdown in a business that probably
had bene�ted greatly from crush of business
leading up to the 2008 Olympics.


But now, only 2 months later we believe the story
has taken a turn for the worse. True valuation is
di�cult to pinpoint until a transaction occurs in the
space between two reliable parties at arms-length. 
Just yesterday, EDU’s  pre-eminent competitor was
bought, and now everything has changed.


In their �lings they state,


“We face competition for our “Elite English”
program primarily from Wall Street Institute and EF
English First, both of which o�er English training
courses for adults in many cities in China. Wall
Street Institute began providing high-end English
training courses to adults in major cities several
years before we entered this market and enjoys a
�rst-mover advantage.”


So here we see that Wall Street Institute is a
competitor with equal if not stronger brand
recognition.  Wall Street Institute’s seller was Carlyle
Group, not exactly naive investors who would sell a
property for a mistakenly low price. ”


The Envelope, Please

The transaction price was $145 million cash.


So let’s look at the valuation of this recent and
highly relevant transaction.

2009)


Price to sales

2:1 Greater than 9:1


It could also be argued that Pearson “paid up” for
Wall Street English, as they are going to add them
to an existing business and share all back o�ce
services.


Just as a reality check, if EDU were valued
at par with this transaction based on a
multiple of sales, it would be trading at a
share price below $14.25


It has to be noted that Wall Street Institute’s buyer,
Pearson, is a $5.5 billion dollar company.  They
made this acquisition for an obvious reason — to
compete in this market space.


Yet, analyst models, on which the company’s nose-
bleed price target depend, show the company’s net
pro�t margins actually rising steeply fro current
levels of 24% to over 32% by 2011.  China is the
world’s most price-competitive market space. 
Citron questions whether a valuation that depends
on sharply increasing margins as well as hugely
increased revenues makes any sense at all ….
especially when the barriers to entry in this
business are so low. 
Crystal Ball Says


EDU reports in a few days, and no doubt it will be a
tad better than its lowered guidance announced
February.  But for extra credit, what will the
analysts say about the valuation point on the Wall
Street Institute acquisition?


No doubt, they’ll claim it’s not an “apples to apples”
comparison.  After all, Wall Street Institute
4/20/2018 Citron Research Reports on New Oriental Education and Technology (NYSE:EDU) – Citron Research


https://citronresearch.com/citron-research-reports-on-new-oriental-education-and-technology-nyseedu/ 4/5


concentrates on teaching English to high-end
adults, while EDU’s business is broader.


The facts are that the “English to high-end adults”
business is the mainstay of EDU’s business – by
their own admission it’s been their core business
since founding, and is their highest margin sector. 
Describing in their own words their newer, more
diversi�ed o�erings:


“Some of these operations have not
generated signi�cant or any pro�t to date
and we have less experience responding
quickly to changes, competing successfully
and maintaining and expanding our brand in
these areas without jeopardizing our brand
in other areas. Consequently, there is limited
operating history on which you can base
your evaluation of the business and
prospects of these relatively more recent
operations. “  EDU – 20-F  10/23/2008


It is Citron’s opinion that the Wall Street Institute
valuation metric is indeed very ominous for EDU. 
We can debate what variety of apples are being
compared, but the di�erence between EDU’s 9x
sales and the 2x sales valuation of their primary
competitor is a reference point investors will ignore
at their own risk.


Conclusion:


In the good old days, a “China IPO” incubated by a
“prestigious” Wall Street investment brokerage �rm,
was a ticket to valuations completely detached from
reality.  New Oriental seems like a throwback to this
frothy era.


As an investment, the company could continue to
perform in stellar fashion for years to come, but
with limited metrics to distinguish “same store
sales” vs. “growth by acquisition”, not to mention
the uncertainties of overseas company �nancial
reporting, its fantasy-land valuation exposes
shareholders to the potential of extreme price
erosion, with nothing coming from the company
but a stream of good news met by a constantly
oozing share price.
