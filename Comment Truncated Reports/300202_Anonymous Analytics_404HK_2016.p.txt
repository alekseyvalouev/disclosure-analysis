We believe that Mr. Lin Zhuo Yan, the current non-Executive Chairman, is using Hsin Chong as his 
personal dumping ground for problematic and non-revenue generating development properties at the 
expense of minority shareholders. Since 2011, Hsin Chong has acquired a number of development 
properties that were either owned by Mr. Lin or his wife, or can be directly linked to Mr. Lin.  
 
This report will present the evidence – including site visit photos and satellite images – that lead us to 
believe that two of the Company’s biggest property acquisitions have languished for years while Hsin 
Chong continues to mislead investors about the commercial viability of these properties. Each year, Hsin 
Chong claims that monetization of these properties is just around the corner, but we can find no 
evidence that this is true. 
 
In one case, Hsin Chong spent ~HK$4 billion on the acquisition and construction of a property that sits 
empty as one of China’s notorious ghost towns in a location that Bloomberg calls “Ground Zero of 
China’s Slowdown.”  
 
In another case, Hsin Chong spent HK$5.9 billion on a property that has been sitting idle for years, 
having failed to attract international brands and commercial tenants. 
 
Relative to Hsin Chong’s HK$3.5 billion market cap, these acquisitions were substantial in scope. 
Furthermore, both of these properties were acquired from vendors that included Mr. Lin and his wife, at 
vastly inflated prices relative to their original purchase price. These acquisitions have burdened Hsin 
Chong with significant share dilution and increased debt which we believe have led to a host of other 
problems with the Company, including: 
 
 


 Based on Company disclosures, we estimate Hsin Chong will pay well over HK$700 million per 
year in cash interest expenses alone. As of the most recent reporting period, the Company only 
had HK$1.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet. 


 Hsin Chong has been both operating cash flow negative and investing cash flow negative in each 
of 2013, 2014, 2015, and interim 2016. 


 In order to preserve funds, Hsin Chong has suspended its long-standing dividend.  
 


 
Based on our research, we believe Hsin Chong is having serious problems monetizing its land bank. 
Furthermore, we have serious concerns over the Company’s substantial debt obligations.  
 
Considering the evidence and the analysis presented in this report, we value Hsin Chong at HK$0.12 per 
diluted share. With shares currently trading at HK$0.62, our valuation suggests a potential 81% 
downside. 
  
 
 
 
 


Executive Summary
3 
 


 
 
Hsin Chong is a construction and property development company listed on the Hong Kong stock 
exchange under the ticker 404.HK. For most of its 75+ year history, Hsin Chong was primarily a 
construction company, with contracts focused in Hong Kong. 
 
In 2011, Hsin Chong decided to expand into the property development business with its first major land 
acquisition. A number of other substantial acquisitions have since followed, transforming Hsin Chong 
from primarily a construction company to primarily a PRC-focused Property Development and 
Investment (“PDI”) company. In fact, Hsin Chong’s PDI business has so eclipsed its construction business 
that we consider the latter almost immaterial to its current HK$3.5 billion market cap. For example, a 
research report dated 26 January 2015 from Emperor Securities estimates that 93% of Hsin Chong’s 
market value is derived from its PDI business.

Unfortunately, we believe Hsin Chong has misled investors about the commercial viability of its 
properties. This report presents evidence that Hsin Chong’s new non-Executive Chairman has enriched 
himself and his associates by unloading problematic properties onto shareholders at vastly inflated 
prices, while burdening the Company with share dilution and increased debt.  Our research shows that 
most of these properties have languished for years and failed to attract tenants. 
 
Specifically, this report will focus on Tieling and Foshan, which are the Company’s two largest property 
acquisitions and account for nearly all of Hsin Chong’s land bank:

The Tieling acquisition was originally sold to investors as “a sustainable source of the Group’s revenue 
and profit over the next five to eight years.”


2
 In reality, we believe this acquisition paved the road for 


years of subsequent destruction of shareholder value at the hands of Mr. Lin and his associates. 
 
In November 2011, Hsin Chong acquired 17 parcels of undeveloped land covering approximately 1.8 
million square meters in Tieling, Liaoning Province.


3
 Total consideration paid for the acquisition was 


HK$1.8 billion.
4
  


 
Outrageously, the original vendors – which included a related party – had completed the acquisition of 
the land only five months prior for a mere RMB439 million (HK$575 million).

 More on this later. 


 
According to the 2011 annual report, Hsin Chong had ambitious plans for the land:

Hsin Chong even provided an image of what the 3 million square meter gross floor area Tieling project 
would look like on completion for investors who lacked the imagination to picture such a grandiose plan:

The Tieling development project, named ‘La Viva’, was Hsin Chong’s maiden foray into the property 
development business. Yet, after five years and billions of RMB spent on construction, the project has 
consistently missed deadlines and currently sits empty as one of China’s many notorious ghost towns. 
 
Since the beginning, Hsin Chong has tried to sell shareholders the idea that monetization of the property 
was just around the corner: 
 
 


A history of missed deadlines 
 
2012 interim report: “Construction of the first phase has commenced and sales of residential flats are 
expected to begin in mid-2013.” 
 
2012 annual report: “The Sales Centre of Phase 1 will open in June 2013, with sales and marketing 
programmes scheduled in August 2012… as of this report date, more than 20 anchor tenants have been 
secured with tenancy agreements signed.” 
 
2013 interim report: “The pre-sales campaign is being launched during the second half of 2013… The La 


Viva（星悅南 岸）project will start to produce revenue during the financial year ending 2014 once the 
Phase 1 residential units are handed over to buyers and also when the commercial space starts 
operations.” 
 
2013 annual report: “The residential sales launch will be tied with the phased opening of the outlets and 
water park in the second half of 2014.” 
 
2014 interim report: “The residential sales launch will be synchronized with phased opening of the 
outlets and water park in the first half of 2015.”  
 
2014 annual report: “The residential sales launch will be tied with the phase opening of the commercial 
development in the second half of 2015… we await the properties to deliver significant revenue 
contribution when La Viva launches its presale later in 2015.” 
 
2015 interim report: “The residential sales launch will be tied with the phased opening of the retail 
outlets and water park in the second half of 2015… The first phase of commercial development also 
consists of retail outlets with operation aimed to start in the second half of 2015 and the leasing is 
underway.” 
 
2015 annual report: “The residential sales launch will be tied with the phased opening of the retail 
outlets and water park in the second half of 2016.” 
 
2016 interim report: “The residential sales launch will be tied with the phased opening of the retail 
outlets and water park at the end of 2016.” 
 
 
And so we come to today – a development project that supposedly had tenancy agreements signed with 
“more than 20 anchor tenants” four years ago, and a planned pre-sales campaign as far back as three 
years ago, seems to have gone nowhere.

In fact, a recent site visit shows that the property is neither ready to be sold nor habitable. Worse still, 
the entire project seems stalled and commercially unviable. 
 
These curated pictures from the 2015 annual report show the exterior of the residential buildings, which 
appear complete: 
 


 
 
 
However, a site visit as recently as June 2016 shows incomplete construction work with overgrown grass 
and litter and debris everywhere:
7 
 


The 2015 annual report also shows the interior of the residential spaces as finished, presumably to 
suggest that the properties are move-in ready:  
 


 
 
 
However, the site visit found that no interior decoration work had been completed: 
 


 
 
 
From this site visit it’s painfully clear that the residential projects are neither complete, nor under 
construction. There were no construction workers, and no notable construction machinery (except for 
idle cranes).  
 
Everything simply looked abandoned.
8 
 


The commercial side of the project was much of the same, with unfinished construction and debris 
everywhere: 
 





 
 
 
 
We have serious doubts any tenants or businesses want to move into this development given its current 
state.
9 
 


Even the water park – considered the crown jewel of the Tieling development – leaves a lot to be 
desired. Here are pictures of the water park from the 2015 annual report: 
 


 
 
In its 2016 interim report, Hsin Chong refers to this water park as “one of the key components of the 
unparalleled La Viva experience” and claims that construction “is coming along smoothly”.


6
 However, an 


Al Jazeera article dated 19 September 2016 and titled “The End of the Chinese Dream?” published this 
picture of the inside of the water park: 
 


 
 
The article notes that the water park was scheduled to open in the summer of 2015, but construction 
has since stalled, calling it a victim of the economic slowdown. “Coming along smoothly”? We don’t 
think so.

Failed Pre-Sales Campaign and Stalled Construction 
 
The Tieling project has been plagued by a combination of a failed pre-sales campaign and stalled 
construction. Based on our research and industry interviews, we believe the Tieling property is not a 
commercially viable development. 
 
According to a local real estate expert, there was a pre-sales and marketing campaign for the residential 
units in 2015. However, due to insufficient demand, there was no official sales launch and deposits were 
refunded. 
 
Our own research suggests that a pre-sales campaign started as early as 2014. Here’s a screenshot of 
Tieling La Viva’s official Weibo account offering residential units in May 2014:  
 


 
 
 
And here is another offer for residential units in June 2015:
11 
 


As part of its anticipated opening, Hsin Chong even published a promotional article on its website dated 
25 May 2015 titled “La Viva Tieling to be Unveiled This Summer”. The article goes as far as to boast that 
lifeguards had already been hired for the local water park, as well as a number of frontline customer 
service staff: 
 


 
Source: http://www.hsinchong.com/en-us/Pages/what-new-details/214  


 
 
Unfortunately, the development project never opened and local sources explained that the lifeguard 
and staff that were recruited have since been let go.

Furthermore, we found what appears to be a complaint from a buyer to the Management Committee of 
Tieling Fanhe New Area claiming that they paid a deposit of RMB5,000 to buy a residential unit in La Viva 
Phase 1, but because of stalled construction wanted a refund. The deposit was subsequently returned:

As evidenced from the site visit, the Tieling development sits unfinished and all construction has 
stopped. According to industry sources, the unfinished construction is partly the result of payment 
disputes with its contractor. 
 
The original general contractor for the Tieling project was China Construction First Building (Group) 
Corporation Ltd. (“CCFBC”). Due to payment disputes, CCFBC pulled out and successfully sued Hsin 
Chong’s relevant subsidiaries in 2014, although based on the information we could find, the Company is 
appealing. 
 
A number of court orders describe the lawsuit:  
 
http://www.court.gov.cn/wenshu/xiangqing-5998.html 
http://courtapp.chinacourt.org/wenshu/xiangqing-6011.html 
http://courtapp.chinacourt.org/wenshu/xiangqing-5997.html 
http://courtapp.chinacourt.org/wenshu/xiangqing-4504.html 
 
 
According to a former engineer of China Railway International Group (“CRIG”), in 2014 Hsin Chong hired 
CRIG to replace CCFBC as the general contractor. However, in 2015 construction was suspended once 
more and CRIG pulled out.

We find these payment disputes and prolonged halts surreal. In 2013 and 2014 alone, HK$2 billion in 
cash was paid out for properties under development according to the Company’s 2014 cash flow 
statement. We attribute these payments to the Tieling project since it was the only development 
property owned by Hsin Chong at the time:

For all the money and time spent, it’s baffling that this project is simply sitting there, incomplete and 
neglected, while the Company disingenuously continues to assure shareholders that operational 
commencement is imminent. How does Hsin Chong plan to attract tenants to a property that looks like 
it was the set for an episode of The Walking Dead?  
 


 
(Artist’s impression – legal counsel advised us to put this disclaimer so there would be no misunderstanding that 


the picture has been altered and the undead are in fact not roaming Tieling. Seriously.)

Tieling, the Ghost Town 
 
Even if we assume the project is eventually completed, the question morphs into one of ‘who would 
actually want to live here?’ 
 
Hsin Chong’s Tieling La Viva project is a 10 minute drive from Tieling New Town in Liaoning Province. 
Tieling New Town itself is the result of urban planning by the Tieling local government to build a satellite 
city 6 miles from the traditional city centre: 
 


 
Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2011/0929/LTN20110929161.pdf pg. 41 


 
 
However, Tieling New Town has failed to attract businesses or residents, and proved to be a colossal 
failure of state planning. In a 2013 article, the Wall Street Journal described Tieling New Town as 
“virtually a ghost town” where: 
 


“Clean waterways weave among deserted residential and government buildings. 
Housing blocks that won recognition from the United Nations for providing good 
affordable homes are almost empty. The businesses that were supposed to create local 
employment haven't materialized. Without jobs, there is little incentive for anybody to 
move here.” 


 
 
In a 2015 follow-up article, the Wall Street Journal described Tieling New Town as having some signs of 
life, but still largely empty: 
 


“However, the busy areas were concentrated around the places where rural residents, 
moved off their land to make way for the city, had been relocated. The waves of new 
migrants – the ones who can afford the rows and rows of high rise apartments that still 
seem largely empty – had yet to materialize. Even more residential developments had 
been added since the Wall Street Journal last visited.” 



http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2011/0929/LTN20110929161.pdf

http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/05/13/banishing-ghosts-but-looking-for-life-a-chinese-ghost-city-two-years-on/
15 
 


The problem with Hsin Chong’s La Viva project is that it isn’t even located in Tieling New Town, but 
rather on the outskirts. How desirable can a development possibly be when it faces the double whammy 
of essentially being the suburbs of a virtual ghost town? 
 
Not very, as evidenced by the pre-sales campaign.  
 
According to one local expert, there are a number of contributing factors to La Viva’s failure, including: 
 


 The supporting facilities are incomplete 


 Merchant negotiation for the commercial center haven’t even started 


 A promised international school has not been built and there is no related construction ongoing 


 There are already many commercial and residential buildings available in Tieling New Town and 
people could just visit the water park without having to live there. 


 
 
Unbelievably, the failed pre-sales campaign and these other critical issues have not stopped Hsin Chong 
from continuously assuring investors that monetization is imminent. Recently, Hsin Chong claims in its 
2015 annual report that: 
 


“The residential sales launch will be tied with the phased opening of the retail outlets 
and water park in the second half of 2016.”


7
  


 
It further states that: 
 


“It is expected that our flagship La Viva projects in Tieling, Liaoning… will roll out, and 
will begin contributing revenue to the Group in 2016.”


8
 


 
 
These rosy statements are utter nonsense. Whatever window of opportunity Hsin Chong had to 
commercialize the Tieling property seems to have disappeared as the local economy collapsed. A recent 
Bloomberg article dated June 2016 calls Tieling “Ground Zero of China’s Slowdown” and describes 
Tieling as: 
 


“...the worst-performing city in the worst-performing province. Ads offering work visas 
abroad are peppered across hoardings, and billboards offer loans for people in "urgent 
need." Shuttered car-parts factories flank the highway to the high-speed train station. In 
the center, a closed wedding-photograph studio has a notice in the window that reads: 
‘Owner is going overseas. Shop for sale.’” 


 
 
Investors need to look no further than Detroit and other industrial cities to see how difficult it is to turn 
around failed rustbelt economies. We have serious doubts that shareholders will be able to extract any 
meaningful value from the Tieling property and fully expect Hsin Chong to continue its questionable 
tradition of pushing out the sales launch date into perpetuity.

Related Parties and Inflated Assets 
 
While the Tieling project has turned out to be a terrible investment for shareholders, the vendors that 
sold this property to Hsin Chong did incredibly well for themselves.  
 
In announcing the acquisition, Hsin Chong made it seem like shareholders were getting a fair deal paying 
HK$1.8 billion for the Tieling property. The Company even booked a special reserve of HK$332 million as 
the difference between the fair value of assets acquired and the consideration paid.


9
 


 
However, just five months before the acquisition, the vendors had themselves completed the purchase 
of the land for a mere RMB439 million (HK$575 million).


10
 It also appears that the vendors had not 


expended any additional costs on the bare land. This means that in just a few months the vendors made 
~HK$1.2 billion, or ~3x their purchase price.  
 
Often local governments will sell land parcels at steep discounts on condition that the property is 
developed. We believe the vendors took advantage of such an arbitrage and bought the property only to 
flip it to Hsin Chong. So, why would Hsin Chong buy the property from a middle-man instead of directly 
from the local government at a fraction of the cost? 
 
As is often the case with bad deals, there was a related-party transaction behind this acquisition. The 
vendor of the property was Neo Summit, a holding company ultimately owned by Mr. Wong., Ms. Ma, 
and Beijing Capital Co.:

A Brief Review of the Vendors 
 
 


 Mr. Wilfred Wong Ying Wai (35.55% ownership): At the time of the acquisition, Mr. Wong was 
the Executive Deputy Chairman of Hsin Chong. He would later be promoted to the CEO of Hsin 
Chong before eventually resigning in 2015. His position likely gave him significant influence in 
pushing through the Tieling acquisition. As part-owner of the property, he stood to gain 
personally from the transaction. 
 


 Ms. Ma Kwing, Pony (35.55% ownership): At the time of the acquisition, Ms. Ma was 
considered an independent third party. She was/is the wife of Mr. Lin who was at the time 
mostly an unknown figure to shareholders, but would go on to become the non-Executive 
Chairman of Hsin Chong in 2015. 
 


 Beijing Capital Co. (28.9% ownership): an SOE (state-owned enterprise) listed on the Shanghai 
Exchange, and a subsidiary of Beijing Capital Group. 


 
 
 
Mr. Wong’s involvement and benefit from the Tieling deal is straightforward: he owned 35.5% of the 
property. He was also the Executive Deputy Chairman of Hsin Chong at the time. Selling Tieling to Hsin 
Chong netted him a substantial return. 
 
As a key executive of Hsin Chong at all relevant times, Mr. Wong had a fiduciary duty to the Company 
and its shareholders. If the Tieling property was indeed such a great deal, Mr. Wong should have 
directed Hsin Chong to buy the land at the original price, instead of collaborating with associates to buy 
the land only to flip it to shareholders for personal gain. 
 
Mr. Wong also appears to have been a close business associate of Ms. Ma and her husband, Mr. Lin. This 
is evident from the fact that Mr. Wong and Ms. Ma jointly owned Summit View Holdings, as per the 
above organizational chart. At the time of the Tieling acquisition, Ms. Ma and Mr. Lin were considered 
independent parties. However, as we will see throughout this report, Mr. Lin would go on to be involved 
in a number of highly questionable deals with Hsin Chong and ultimately take over as its non-Executive 
Chairman. 
 
In fact, we believe Mr. Lin was a key figure behind the Tieling deal


11,12
 and subsequent other 


acquisitions. He will appear numerous times throughout this report and his role will become more 
apparent.

With all its outstanding issues, we would have expected Hsin Chong to focus on salvaging the Tieling 
project before setting its sights on new development properties. Yet, in January 2015, Hsin Chong 
completed another major acquisition – this time of semi-developed land in Foshan City, Guangdong at a 
consideration of HK$5.9 billion.


13
 


 
The story of the Foshan property follows the same narrative as the Tieling property, including inflated 
assets and missed deadlines. Furthermore, this property was bought directly from Mr. Lin at substantial 
personal gain to him. 
 
Without a stinging sense of irony, Hsin Chang justifies the Foshan acquisition as being:  
 


“relatively similar to the Group’s [Tieling] La Viva project, such that the Group can draw 
on relevant development and commercialization experience from its [Tieling] La Viva 
project for further planning and development of the Property, and can create possible 
brand synergy in the development and management of large scale composite property 
development projects in the future.”


14
 


 
 
LOL – whatever. 
 
Even with its short ownership history, commercialization plans for the Foshan property are already 
being pushed out: 
 
2014 annual report: “Phase 1 will be rolled out within the next 2 years and the existing retail outlet mall 
is intended to start the operation toward the end of 2015.” 
 
2015 annual report: “The residential sales launch will be tied with the phase opening of the retail 
outlets in the second half of 2016.” 
 
2016 interim report: “The residential sales will be launched after the phased opening of the retail 
outlets at the end of 2016.” 
 
Based on a recent site visit, we have serious doubts that these statements have any merit. 
 
When Hsin Chong acquired the Foshan property, one of the plots was already semi-developed with an 
existing retail complex, 25 blocks of low-density residential properties, and a clubhouse.


15
 These 


buildings comprise the “Phase 1” rollout.
16


 
 
Yet the glossy pictures Hsin Chong presents in its annual report belie the true state of these constructs.

Here are pictures from the 2015 annual report showing the landscaped residential units looking ready 
for primetime: 
 


    
 
 
 
However, a site visit shows the buildings in a neglected state with overgrown grass, unpaved roads, and 
unfinished construction:
20 
 


The interiors of the residential buildings look like an even bigger pit of despair, with weed overgrowth 
creeping into the property:
21 
 


Turning to the retail side, here is a picture from the 2015 annual report which shows the Disney-esque 
façade of the retail outlet: 
 


 
 
 
The good news here is that the retail complex is complete: 
 


 
 
The bad news is that the retail complex has been completed since 2013 and yet is still not operational. A 
recent site visit showed that no brands had entered the outlet yet. In fact, our team could find no sales 
or business development office anywhere on the Foshan property. There were only security guards and 
cleaners working the grounds. In casual conversation with two of them, neither knew when the retail 
complex would open or when the residential houses would start to sell.
22 
 


Stalled Project 
 
Through industry sources we learned that the entire Foshan project has been stalled for years. 
According to these sources, major construction started in 2009 and came to a halt in 2013 (save for the 
construction of an enclosure wall). Several reasons were given as to why the project has stalled, 
including:  
 


 When the government sold the parcels of land originally, it did so at very favorable prices in 
exchange for a requirement that the commercial center have tenants before the residential 
buildings launch pre-sales. This requirement adds to the financial pressures of the project. 


 There have been difficulties in attracting tier-1 international brands. 


 The project is in a remote area ~50km from the city center of Foshan and ~60km away from the 
city center of Guangzhou. 


 According to Baidu Maps, there are at least four other outlet stores within ~20km from the city 
centers of Foshan and Guangzhou, including the recently opened Florentia Village:

Using satellite images from Google Earth, we can confirm that the project has stalled since at least 2013 
and no notable work has been performed on the Phase 1 area since Hsin Chong acquired the property. 



http://www.florentiavillage.com/sh-en/news-10042.html
23 
 


Here is a satellite image of the Phase 1 area dated 10 October 2013 as a starting reference point. At this 
point, the property was owned by the vendor: 
 


 
 
 
Here is a satellite image one year later, dated 11 October 2014, around the time that Hsin Chong 
announced the acquisition and approximately 2.5 months before the deal was closed. There appears to 
have been no further work done on the area by the vendor in all this time:

And here is the most recently available satellite image dated 1 October 2015. By this point, Hsin Chong 
had had ownership of the property for 9 months, yet the area looks exactly the same, save for 
overgrown weeds around the residential properties: 
 


 
 
 
Given its static state, it seems clear from these pictures that the previous owners of the property saw 
little merit in the development. It also seems clear that Hsin Chong has put little effort into further 
developing the project since the acquisition, and has either been unwilling or unable to monetize the 
project. 
 
So, why spend shareholder money on such a substantial acquisition in the first place and who stood to 
benefit from this deal?

Inflated Assets, Part II 
 
Hsin Chong acquired the Foshan property at a consideration of HK$5.9 billion and immediately 
recognized a ‘gain on bargain purchase’ of HK$2 billion.


17
  


 
But for shareholders the Foshan acquisition was anything but a bargain.  
 
The Foshan property is comprised of 5 pieces of land: 
 


 
Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/1104/LTN20141104005.pdf pg. 37 


 
Each piece of land was held by a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (“WFOE”) of the same number. So 
for example, Land 1 was held by WFOE 1, Land 2 was held by WFOE 2, etc, etc. 
 
Of these, Land 1 is the only one to have been at least partly developed and is the site of the residential 
properties, the outlet mall and the club house. There was no construction on Lands 2-5.


18
 


 
Originally, Lands 1-4 were 50%, 60%, 60%, and 60% owned by Beijing Capital Land through WFOE 1-4, 
respectively. Beijing Capital Land is a HK-listed entity (2868.HK) controlled by Beijing Capital Group. 
Meanwhile, the remaining stakes of WFOE 1-4 were owned by a BVI holding company named Rich 
Century. Rich Century also wholly-owned Land 5 through WFOE 5. In turn, Rich Century was 100% 
owned by our favorite property-flipper, Mr. Lin.  
 
In April 2013, Beijing Capital Land sold its stakes in WFOE 1-4 to Rich Century, giving Rich Century 100% 
ownership of WFOE 1-5, and by extension, the entire Foshan property.

We can see from Beijing Capital Land’s annual report disclosures that it sold its stakes in WFOE 1-4 for 
RMB$521 million (HK$651 million): 
 


Beijing Capital 2013 Annual Report Disclosures 


 
Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/0209/LTN20140209015.pdf pg. 130 


 
 
Conservatively pro-rating the disposal price by 50% implies that WFOE 1-4 were valued at HK$1.3 billion.  
 
In addition, the Foshan acquisition circular states that WFOE 5 had net assets of HK$220 million as at 30 
June 2014.


20
 Combined, that gives us a value of ~HK$1.5 billion for the entirety of WFOEs 1-5. Yet, that is 


a far cry from the HK$5.9 billion that Hsin Chong paid for the WFOEs. 
 
Indeed, we can see from satellite images that no major construction had been undertaken on the 
property from the time shortly after Mr. Lin acquired the outstanding stake from Beijing Capital Land in 
2013 and when he flipped the property to Hsin Chong in 2015 to justify this glaring HK$4.4 billion value 
gap. 
 
It just seems that Mr. Lin made out like a bandit acting as a middle-man on this transaction, while Hsin 
Chong and its shareholders paid a grossly inflated price for a property that has seen de minimis progress 
over the years and whose original SOE owner seemed eager to dispose of.

27 
 


Notably, Hsin Chong discloses in its 2015 annual report that the Foshan acquisition includes deferred tax 
liabilities of HK$6.1 billion: 
 


    
   Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2016/0510/LTN20160510273.pdf pg. 188 


 
However, the Foshan property has never generated revenue. Therefore, we suspect that the deferred 
tax liability is, at least in part, the result of a write-up in the values of the assets pre-acquisition. We 
suspect that this nonsensical write-up was conceived to make an otherwise terrible deal more palatable 
to Hsin Chong’s shareholders.  
 
As a side note, while the Foshan deal ultimately closed in 2015, Mr. Lin had entered a Memorandum of 
Understanding with Hsin Chong to sell the property as early as 2013 – only months after he had 
acquired the outstanding stake from Beijing Capital Land. Furthermore, Mr. Lin had the gall to initially 
ask for as much as HK$10.6 billion for the Foshan property


21
 before the deal finalized for HK$5.9 billion. 


 
Curiously, a week after the 2013 Memorandum of Understanding was signed concerning the possible 
acquisition of Foshan, Mr. Mak Kwai Wing – an independent director and head of the audit committee – 
resigned. Hsin Chong did not have a replacement ready to fill the vacancy which suggests to us that this 
resignation was abrupt. In announcing his resignation, Mr. Mak explained that he would like to focus his 
time more on his own profession. 
 
However, at the time of his resignation, Mr. Mak was also an independent director, chairman of the 
investment committee, member of the audit committee, member of the remuneration committee and 
member of the nomination committee of Tianjin Development Holdings (0882.HK) – positions that he 
holds to this day. Apparently Mr. Mak lacked the same urgency to resign from these positions as he did 
from Hsin Chong. We wonder why.

Although we consider Mr. Lin a key figure behind the Tieling acquisition which was completed through 
his wife in 2011, he first took a more visible role in Hsin Chong’s murky acquisition spree when he sold 
the New Times Plaza to the Company in 2013. The New Times Plaza is a commercial property in Beijing 
which was acquired in a deal worth HK$965 million.


22
  Mr. Lin held a 60% interest in the property. 


 
In addition to the deal, Mr. Lin was revealed to have been on a generous consulting contract with a fixed 
monthly fee of HK$600,000 to “act as a consultant with respect to business opportunities in the PRC.”


23
 


We note that at the time of this acquisition and consulting contract, Mr. Wong was the Chairman and 
CEO of Hsin Chong. Recall from page 16 that Mr. Wong was a business associate of Ms. Ma (Mr. Lin’s 
wife), and both acted as vendors of the Tieling property. Clearly, having a CEO friend on the inside has 
its benefits. 
 
As we will see, Mr. Lin did indeed act as a consultant for Hsin Chong. Unfortunately, it seems that all the 
business opportunities he found for the Company benefited him and his associates at the expense of 
minority shareholders. 
 
For example, in 2015 alone, Hsin Chong spent HK$2.4 billion acquiring three more non-revenue 
generating properties:

14-Sep-15 Tianjin property HK$0.9 billion Undeveloped land 


    HK$2.4 billion   


Source: 2015 annual report 


 
 
Unbelievably, we found that all these acquisitions can be linked to Mr. Lin: 
 


 Tai’an property: Mr. Lin met the Tai’an local government in March 2012 to discuss the project.
24


 
He even gave a speech at the cornerstone laying ceremony that year.


25
  





 Guangzhou property: Mr. Lin is disclosed as a 1% owner of the property on acquisition.
26





 Tianjin property: One of the shareholders in this property is Tianjin Century Group. Mr. Lin and 
his wife appeared as guarantors on behalf of Tianjin Century Group in 2014.

This is like playing the game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon” except instead of six degrees it’s just one 
degree, and instead of Kevin Bacon it’s Mr. Lin. 
 
Given the outcome of the Tieling and Foshan acquisitions, we are skeptical that these Lin-connected 
projects will fare any better. In fact, it just seems that Mr. Lin is using Hsin Chong as his personal 
dumping ground for problematic and non-revenue generating development properties. Despite their 
recent acquisitions, there are already reported issues with these properties. 
 
For example, this article dated 10 August 2015 states that phase 1 of the Tai’an property, which was 
originally expected to be completed and begin a soft opening in 2014, is still incomplete. The reporter 
also notes that construction had stopped for six months at the time of visit. There were only a few 
security guards on site. 
 
Meanwhile, this AFP article dated 20 May 2015 notes that the area where Hsin Chong’s Tianjin property 
is located is considered a “ghost town” where: 
 


“more than three years after construction began, all but one of the buildings planned for 
the development in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin appear unfinished, alongside 
vacant spaces where others should stand.” 


 
 
In acquiring Tieling, Foshan, and all these other Lin-connected properties, Hsin Chong paid consideration 
of at least HK$11 billion in cash and stock.


 28
 That is 3x the Company’s current HK$3.5 billion market cap. 


 
These expenditures were financed through a series of debt and equity offers that substantially 
expanded Hsin Chong’s balance sheet and extensively diluted minority shareholders. In 2010, Hsin 
Chong had 673 million diluted shares outstanding. That was the year before the Company entered the 
PDI business with its acquisition of Tieling. By the end of the 2015, there was 11 billion diluted shares 
outstanding, representing a massive 15x increase:

By acting as vendors to Hsin Chong in various property deals, Mr. Lin, Ms. Ma, and Mr. Wong amassed 
underlying interest in 44% of the diluted shares of the Company by the end of 2015. In fact, in May 
2015, Mr. Lin was appointed as a non-Executive Director of Hsing Chong, and then one month later was 
appointed as its non-Executive Chairman

 which we believe effectively gave Mr. Lin reign of the 


Company at the expense of minority shareholders. That’s not a bad outcome for a guy who was paid as

process.   
 
If Hsin Chong was an individual, it would be a victim of Stockholm syndrome. But the abuse doesn’t end 
there. Outrageously, Hsin Chong has put deposits down on even more properties! 
 
At year-end 2014, an earnest deposit of HK$130 million was “paid in respect of a potential acquisition of 
a property project in the PRC.”

Likewise, at year-end 2015, an earnest deposit of HK$200 million was “paid in respect of a potential 
acquisition of a property project in the PRC.”


31
 


 
 
We cannot fathom why Hsin Chong is putting earnest deposits down on more acquisitions when it 
already has such a large portfolio of undeveloped properties that it has repeatedly failed to monetize.  
 
 
Notably, between 2010 and mid-2016, prepayment and deposits to third-parties ballooned on Hsin 
Chong’s balance sheet and currently represent ~1/3 of its market cap:

We do not know what happened in 2016 H1 to swell the deposits so dramatically as there are no 
accompanying notes to the financial statements. However, we find this growth incredibly suspicious 
considering it sheer magnitude. We would not be surprised if there were even more earnest deposits 
paid out for asinine land acquisitions.

Nearly all of Hsin Chong’s land bank is either in need of refurbishment or simply 
undeveloped/incomplete. The question of commercial viability aside, we wonder how the Company will 
be able to complete these projects given the additional capital requirements. Hsin Chong had 
approximately HK$1.1 billion


32
 in cash at the end of June 2016, but we believe the Company is burning 


through it at an unsustainable rate. 
 
In each of 2013, 2014, 2015 and interim 2016 Hsin Chong has been operating and investing cash flow 
negative. In fact, HK$8.8 billion exited the Company through CFO and CFI in the last four and a half fiscal 
years, with nearly 2/3 of that occurring in the last 18 months alone: 
 


Cash Flow Analysis

More concerning is that interest expenses are on the rise given the Company’s large debt obligations. 
According to its 2016 interim results, Hsin Chong paid cash interest of HK$352 million in the six months 
to June 2016 – most of which was capitalized:  
 


 
Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2016/0927/LTN20160927475.pdf  pg. 28 


 
On an annual basis, this means that Hsin Chong is paying HK$704 million in cash interest. Actually, this 
figure is likely understated because in January 2016 the Company issued US$150 million in senior notes 
bearing 8.5% interest. Due to the timing, these additional interest payments would not be reflected in 
the above cash flow statement.

Hsin Chong’s cash concerns are evident in the fact that it scraped its long-standing dividend payout for 
year-end 2015 and instead proposed issuing bonus shares to shareholders. 
 
Furthermore, Hsin Chong seems to acknowledge these issues more directly in its 2016 interim results:

One absurd novel strategy Hsin Chong is now exploring to generate cash and monetize assets is by 
repositioning parts of the Tieling and Foshan properties as homes and facilities for the elderly:

Ah yes – the old ‘Just-throw-some-elderly-folks-in-there’ real-estate strategy taught at Trump University.  
 
And just like Trump University, we believe this new strategy is destined for failure. Believe it or not, 
there is actually another development-turned-ghost town that was built as a retirement home for 
seniors.

 The development – a replica of Dubai’s Palm Island – was built on the outskirts of Jinzhou 


which is one of the biggest cities in Liaoning province and just 3.5 hours drive from Hsin Chong’s Tieling 
development!

The failure of this project is not very surprising. If there’s anything we know about old people it’s that 
they love 5PM early bird dinners and warm climates. Liaoning is one of the coldest provinces in China. 
Building retirement homes in a province where winter temperatures can drop to -11C is a terrible idea. 
 
We believe this new attempt at “repositioning” its property portfolio is a tacit admission by Hsin Chong 
that it is having serious problems monetizing its land bank.

We value Hsin Chong as the sum of its PDI book value and the P/E of its construction business. 
 


Book Value 
 
Taking its balance sheet as stated, Hsin Chong has a book value of HK$1.25 per diluted share. With 
shares currently trading at HK$0.62 per diluted share, this represents a 50% discount which is consistent 
with many similar-sized HK-listed property development companies. 
 
However, given everything presented in this report, we don’t put much weight in the stated value of the 
Hsin Chong’s property holdings. Accordingly, we apply a 60% haircut to Company’s PDI assets and take 
into account the full dilution of shares:

Valuation
35 
 


Why a 60% discount?  
 
From a high-level approach, recall that Tieling and Foshan were acquired for approximately 3x-4x the 
consideration that the vendors had originally paid for the properties. We are not going to give these 
properties much more value than what the vendors acquired them for. A reversion to the original 
valuation implies a ~67%-75% discount. 
 
In the case of Foshan, Hsin Chong appears to have put no major work into the property since its 
acquisition, so we see no reason to give it a valuation premium. 
 
On the other hand, we acknowledge that Hsin Chong poured more than HK$2 billion in construction 
costs to develop the Tieling property. Under normal circumstances, this additional work should clearly 
be considered in valuing the property. The problem is that in the time that the Tieling property was 
bought and the construction carried out, Tieling’s economy has nosedived. Accordingly, the property 
seems far less desirable now than it was even a few years ago. It’s hard to give much credit to the 
construction of empty residential and commercial buildings in a place that Bloomberg calls “Ground 
Zero of China’s Slowdown”.


34
 


 
On a more granular level, we can refer to the Foshan acquisition to support our 60% discount. The 
Foshan acquisition is unique because of its sheer size and because we can look at the accounts of Beijing 
Capital Land who was one of the original owners of the property. According to its 2013 accounts, Beijing 
Capital Land valued the consolidated assets of its Foshan property (WFOE 1-4) at RMB2.4 billion (HK$3 
billion) on disposal:

In addition, the Foshan acquisition circular states that WFOE 5 had total assets of HK$702 million.


35
 This 


gives us a combined asset value of $HK3.7 billion for WFOEs 1-5.

However, when Hsin Chong acquired the assets two years later from Mr. Lin, it capitalized HK$15.2 
billion worth of property on its balance sheet – HK$2.7 billion as investment properties and HK$12.5 
billion as properties under development:

Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2016/0510/LTN20160510273.pdf pg. 188 


 
This is 4x the value of the same property in the span of ~2 years. Recall from the satellite images that no 
major work had been carried out on the site from shortly after the time Beijing Capital Land disposed of 
the property and when Hsin Chong acquired it from Mr. Lin. Reverting to the original disposal value 
assumes a ~75% discount. Accordingly, we believe our 60% discount more than fair. 
 
Considering that Foshan and Tieling represent the vast majority of Hsin Chong’s land bank, and 
considering that all of the other acquisitions share links to Mr. Lin, we are comfortable applying our 60% 
discount to the entirety of Hsin Chong’s PDI assets. 
 
Furthermore, we are also giving a 10% discount to Hsin Chong’s prepayment account because at least 
HK$200 million of this amount is earnest deposits on more land acquisitions, which we have no reason 
to believe will perform any better than all the other non-revenue generating properties the Company 
has acquired. 
 
And finally, we are also nulling Hsin Chong’s tax indemnification assets and its deferred tax liabilities, 
because in practical terms we do not believe these assets/liabilities will be realized as they are 
associated with the write-up of the properties. We note that this adjustment benefits the Company 
significantly since its tax liabilities far outweigh its tax assets. 
 
Based on all of the above, we value Hsin Chong’s PDI assets at an adjusted book value per diluted share 
of HK$0.19.

Earnings Value 
 
While the majority of this report has focused on its PDI business, Hsin Chong also has a construction 
business. In fact, Hsin Chong has historically been known as a construction company, which we believe is 
a credible business with a notable presence in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, we do not believe the 
construction business is profitable enough to support Hsin Chong’s current valuation. 
 
Over the last three years, a large part of Hsin Chong’s reported profitability was the result of valuation 
gains and gains on bargain purchases. For example, in 2015, the Company’s reported HK$2.3 billion in 
gains of bargain purchase represented almost all of its HK$2.6 billion in pre-tax profits. Likewise, in the 
first half of 2016, fair value gains of HK$459 million represented nearly all of its HK$475 million in pre-
tax profits. 
 
This shouldn’t be entirely surprising because as we presented on page 31, Hsin Chong has been 
operating cash flow negative in each of 2013, 2014, 2015, and interim 2016. To get a more accurate 
picture of the construction business’ recurring earnings potential, we have adjusted Hsin Chong’s TTM 
income statement by stripping out the PDI business as presented below: 
 


Hsin Chong Normalized Income Statement – TTM

Construction multiple   
 


12x 


Value per diluted share (HK$)     0.04 


Source: Company filings, our analysis. Note: We normalized taxes at 16.5%. 
 


Applying a generous construction industry multiple of 12x to Hsin Chong’s TTM adjusted earnings 
implies a value of HK$0.04 per diluted share for the construction business.
38 
 


Summing the construction business value (HK$0.04) and PDI book value (HK$0.19) would, in theory, 
value Hsin Chong at HK$0.23 per diluted share. 
 
In theory. 
 
Unfortunately, there is often a distance between the theoretical valuation of a security and the practical 
application of investment logic which rarely fit neatly into an Excel spreadsheet. In reality, we believe 
shares of Hsin Chong are mostly worthless from the perspective of minority shareholders. Consider that: 
 


 In order to preserve funds, Hsin Chong has suspended its dividends and shareholders are no 
longer receiving any cash flow from this investment. 


 Based on Company disclosures, we estimate Hsin Chong will pay well over HK$700 million per 
year in interest expenses alone. Most of this interest expense is capitalized and doesn’t flow 
through the income statement. However, in cash terms, it seems that all the profit generated 
from the construction business will not be able to fully pay this interest expense. We note that 
Hsin Chong has consistently been operating cash flow negative in each of 2013, 2014, 2015 and 
interim 2016. 


 Management expects to meet Hsin Chong’s financial requirements by a combination new equity 
shares, debt securities, and bank borrowings – so look forward to more dilution. 


 The Company has shown very little ability or desire to actually monetize the properties it has 
acquired from Mr. Lin and his associates. Even if the Company had the desire, we don’t imagine 
many potential buyers sitting in their office thinking “my portfolio needs more ghost towns”. 


 Given the fact pattern, including the earnest deposits for more land acquisitions in the PRC, it 
appears that Hsin Chong’s new raison d'etre is simply to act as a dumping ground for Mr. Lin.  


 The large ownership interest of Mr. Lin and his associates, as well as his entrenchment as non-
Executive Chairman give Mr. Lin substantial reign over Hsin Chong, which makes a push for 
corrective action by minority shareholders incredibly difficult. 
 


In the end, it’s questionable what, if any potential value minority shareholders are getting when they 
buy into shares of Hsin Chong. In order to better capture these critical issues, we believe a discount of 
50% is appropriate in valuing Hsin Chong from a minority shareholder perspective: 
 


(in HK$)   


Property book value 0.19 


construction business value 0.04 


Theoretical value 0.23 


Minority shareholder discount -50% 


Value per diluted share 0.12 


 Source: our analysis and estimates 
 
Accordingly, we value Hsin Chong at HK$0.12 per diluted share. With shares currently trading at 
HK$0.62, our valuation suggests a potential 81% downside.
