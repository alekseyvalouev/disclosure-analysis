Financial Details of iRobot’s Recent 
Distributor Deals Not Making Sense


New research into iRobot’s recent distributor acquisitions further calls into question the reliability and accuracy of 
the Company’s financial guidance. If iRobot cannot give further clarity, we believe its guidance should be suspended.


Distributor acquisitions need to be heavily scrutinized given the related-party nature of the transactions. In the case of 
iRobot, we believe investors should be extremely concerned that:


 Its Japanese and European distributors act as exclusive agents for iRobot with nearly 100% of revenues from iRobot products


 IRBT paid >4x the sales multiple and 3x the book value for Robopolis (Europe) than Sales on Demand (SOD/Japan)


• Why should this be the case when Japan is supposedly growing much faster according to iRobot?


• Both entities sell a comparable product set – iRobot products!


• Our primary documents show nearly identical gross margins of 25% at SOD and approximately 20% at Robopolis


 However, based on iRobot’s own SEC financial disclosures it suggests that Robopolis gross margins are 45%
• These 45% margins are well above historical norms that are documented by Robopolis through French statutory filings


• Are significantly higher than any electronic hardware product we’re aware of


• Robopolis’ own financial figures advertised on its website also don’t reconcile with its French statutory filings


• The 2017E sales implied from Robopolis from iRobot’s incremental margin contribution forecast doesn’t make sense


 Further evidence of issues with the Japanese distributor acquisition emerge from our research


• Recall, iRobot already revised the financial contribution of SOD and amended its transcript to correct Q4’16 sales growth


• On the Q2 conference call iRobot admitted it hired additional finance and accounting staff in Japan


• Based on our proprietary research, we estimate that 2017E sales in Japan are down 35%-40% vs prior years

Why Is iRobot Now Buying Distributors?


Investors need to ask themselves “why now” is iRobot acquiring its distributors and using material capital resources to 
fund this expensive endeavor when it could have done this at any point in the past:


 $157m spent on acquiring two distributors (approximately 60% of its YTD average cash balance) 
 Alternative uses for the capital include:


1) More R&D to accelerate new product development where iRobot has traditionally failed (lawn mowers / telehealth)
2) Synergistic technology or product acquisitions 
3) Initiating a regular or special dividend to eliminate excess cash
4) Buying back more stock if iRobot viewed it as undervalued


iRobot has said acquiring distributors gives it more ability to maintain and accelerate its market position by gaining 
control over its distribution network and to give a consistent approach over sales, marketing, branding and service


 We had questioned in the past if iRobot had stuffed the channel by having its distributors acquire more product than it needed 
 This may explain why iRobot failed to meet sales and earnings forecasts for two years post our initial report criticisms in 2014


More likely explanations as to why iRobot is now acquiring its distributors are that:


1. Its distributors have a better view of end market demand, and want to get out of the business before competition increases 
further and profits materially decrease


2. Intense competition is already forcing margin compression, which is starting to creep into iRobot’s financial statements. By 
acquiring its distributors, iRobot can soften some of the immediate margin impact by eliminating the middleman


3. By acquiring its distributors’ inventory, iRobot can effectively re-sell product that it has already sold (effectively sell the same 
product twice)


4. iRobot is using the acquisitions to cover-up prior issues / problems with its distributors (Japan/SOD), and now this might explain 
why iRobot is paying an unusually high multiple for Robopolis

Why did it pay 3x for Robopolis?


iRobot’s distributors all sell its products on an exclusive basis, but to different regions. It concerns Spruce Point that 
iRobot paid substantially more for Robopolis and it tells investors that its gross margins are 44% - more than double the 


margins obtained in Japan. Furthermore, iRobot said that Japan would grow at 2x the rate of EMEA.

Close Look At Robopolis Guidance


The guidance of incremental revenue expected in Q4’17 from the Robopolis acquisition relates directly to the margin 
captured from eliminating the middle man distributor


Q2’17 Earnings Call: 


Mark Strouse: “Hi, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just wanted to start 
with the impact of the Robopolis acquisition, just trying to make sure I'm thinking about it right. So, when 
you say the 4Q revenue impact will be $25 million to $35 million, is that the total revenue that 
Robopolis will generate or is that the incremental revenue that you get from eliminating the 
distribution tier essentially capturing that gross margin?”


CFO Alison Dean: “Yes, that's the incremental revenue iRobot will record have to having acquire 
them. So, it is the delta of the increased price points we're seeing.”

iRobot – something doesn’t add up. Even if you assume 44% gross margins from Robopolis, the implied annual sales 


shows significant acceleration. IRBT has only called for “high teens” improvement from EMEA in 2017 (1)

IRBT said 2016 EMEA sales were $165.2 (25% of total) (press release). Thus “high teens” growth gets to ~$195m
2) Assumes one-third of sales happen in Q4 during holiday season, so the Q4’17 implied figures is multiplied by 3x

Recall that iRobot revised the full year contribution from its Japanese distributor acquisition from $20-$25m to 
$10-$12m from Q4’16 to Q1’17. This contribution should also be considered incremental margin contribution. Based 


on our research, which suggests SOD gross margins of 25%, SOD’s 2017E full year run-rate revenues are 
approximately $53 to $64m – a rate well below the $100m+ of sales historically reported

The previous few years SOD had been

Heed iRobot’s Warning Carefully


iRobot’s financial projections should be viewed skeptically. The Company is even signaling to investors that 
there might be problems by saying it had to hire additional finance and accounting staff “to implement 


policies, procedures and reporting consistent with those in the US”
How different can selling a Roomba in Japan vs. the US really be?


“As a result, we are adjusting our expectations regarding growth 
in full year 2017 China revenue. We now expect nominal full year 
2017 revenue growth following the decline in 2016. In Japan, 
where our integration efforts have been underway since early this 
year, we are progressing well against our short and long-term 
integration goals. We’ve hired additional finance accounting 
staff to implement policies, procedures and reporting 
consistent with those in the US and are on track to deliver 
very strong year-over-year revenue growth of 20 to 25%.”

Distributor Deals Deflect Attention From 
Core Roomba Issues


The core Roomba product remains under pressure. In Q2’17, iRobot reported 15.9% of sales from Amazon. We believe 
a majority of which came from Prime Day. Yet, a casual search for “Robotic Vacuum Cleaners” on Amazon shows that 


iRobot is not even the “Best Seller” or “Amazon Choice”

Distributor Deals Deflect Attention From 
Problems With New Growth Products


Spruce Point views iRobot as a one-trick pony reliant on its stagnant Roomba product. iRobot has had numerous other 
product failures (military, lawn mower bots, and telehealth). We think it is desperate to show it can offer upside to investors 


with its Braava brand, a wet product solution, which became available on its website in Q1’16, at US retail locations in Q2’16, 
and in China/Japan/EMEA in Q3’16. Recent commentary suggests Braava’s growth is already slowing (even from a low 


base), and management is obfuscating disclosures by no longer providing sales in geographic regions 


Q2’17 Conference Call: 


“While Roomba is driving overall revenue growth this year. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our wet floor care robot 
Braava and Braava Jet. We are seeing continued adoption of the category and expect high teen growth for the year versus 2016.”  


Unidentified Analyst


“Okay, great. Thank you. And then I just had one last thing, the Braava Jet, can you breakout maybe how it did versus the expectations 
both in US and internationally?


Alison Dean


What I can tell you is that what we did in Q2 for the category of Braava and Braava Jet was per our expectations. I don’t have specific 
international numbers in front of me here today but year-to-date that’s been performing as we had anticipated.


Q4’16 Conference Call: 


“In 2016, Braava and Braava Jet revenue grew roughly 75%. This is significant given that Braava jet was only introduced in Asia in the 
third quarter. As we have said, the predominantly hard floor surfaces in the region coupled with a need for daily mopping particularly 
in China makes the product ideal for these households.
Q1’17 Conference Call: 


“As we have previously said, the predominantly hard floor surfaces in Asian homes, coupled with the need for daily mopping, particularly in 
China, make the Braava robots ideal for those households. In Q1 of 2017, revenue from the sale of Braava robots comprised roughly 25% 
of our revenue in Japan, and 40% of our revenue in China, compared with 10% and 25% respectively for Q1, 2016. This growth as a 
percentage of revenue supports our enthusiasm for the potential of wet floor care in Asia”
