La Jolla Pharmaceutical: Lost Opportunity Should Chop Valuation By
Well Over Half
Jul. 14, 2015 9:30 AM ET9 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Though La Jolla had to shelve its most promising drug candidate, analysts haven’t
revised price targets to reflect the massive decline in market opportunity.


With La Jolla’s history of missed, terrible earnings, even bullish analysts anticipate
horrible earnings into the foreseeable future.


With little real institutional interest, anyway, more shares recently have been sold out
than new positions added.


Our calculations suggest the remaining market opportunity for La Jolla is a fraction
of analysts’ projections.


The market has recently blasted La Jolla Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: LJPC) shares to
mystifying levels.


But we believe issues facing this biotech stock make it worth far less than half its current
market valuation of nearly $500 million. The issues include:


*La Jolla was forced to shelve its most promising drug candidate, resulting in a massive
decline in market opportunity. Analysts haven't revised price targets to reflect any drop in
opportunity. But we believe the opportunity is ~$100 million, well below the old ~$300
million projection.


*With La Jolla's history of missed, terrible earnings, even bullish analysts anticipate
horrible earnings into the foreseeable future.


*With little real institutional interest, anyway, more La Jolla shares recently have been sold
out than new positions added.


The company hasn't responded to our request for comment but investors may find other
viewpoints here. Read our complete report on La Jolla here.


*Drug candidates pulled, but price targets ignore lost opportunity

La Jolla on May 7 pulled the plug on its two kidney disease candidates GCS-100 and
LJPC-1010, when the company couldn't address FDA's rigorous requirements (why was
the company caught off-guard to learn the products would be held to expensive FDA
standards?).


Both drug candidates were designed to inhibit a problematic protein in chronic kidney
disease in the case of GCS-100 - which was in Phase IIb testing; and in non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis in the case of LJPC-1010 - which was in the early, preclinical stage.


According to La Jolla's filing, the FDA wanted more chemical characterization before
GCS-100 could undergo further clinical development. The company considered the
product such a complex mixture that such level of analysis would have been prohibitively
expensive.


And La Jolla's star candidate was GCS-100. Interestingly, that is the product whose rights
La Jolla acquired in 2012 from director Kevin Tang's and CEO George Tidmarsh's former
company. So that boot must have been hard to swallow.


The SEC filing states that the end of these studies resulted in the company reprioritizing
its entire product development program.


So now La Jolla is hitched to its only clinical-stage product, LJPC-501, for hypotension or
very low blood pressure.


La Jolla is now recruiting patients for a phase III study to determine if LJPC-501 increases
blood pressure. The study is expected to be complete in September 2016.


But analysts haven't changed their price targets to reflect the loss of GCS-100.


In the chart below, also note there's likely little upside considering that La Jolla shares are
trading ~$31 - right in the middle target range of $28-$33.

The problem is that the analysts' price targets erroneously assume the former leading
candidate, GCS-100, is alive and well and likely to reach commercial success …not
booted to the curb.


An analyst report released to Jeffries clients at the end of March notes high commercial
potential for the booted product. And "limited commercial" potential for the remaining
product, LJPC-501.


An interesting side-note describes some limitations, noting mortality benefits or strong
cost/benefit rationale are key to doctors accepting the drugs - "particularly with effective,
cheap, generic hypotensive alternatives" available.


The Jeffries report states its $25 price target is based on $17 per share for LJPC-501 and
$8 per share for the shelved product.


So, what happens if the dropped product is erased from the equation?


La Jolla stock then winds up with a $17 price target - well below the current ~$31 per
share!


*Even $17 per share is too high - The potential market is just too small


Even a $17 share price assumes the drug will enter an overly optimistic vision of the
market and enjoy an unusual degree of success.


We believe the market is rather small for LJPC-501 because, if approved, the drug would
be useful only in special cases because there are so many cheap, effective alternatives.


Some analysts consider the peak sales opportunity in CRH (catecholamine-resistant
hypotension) at ~$280 million and higher.


But we see the peak CRH market opportunity at a fraction of that … $59 million.


Some analysts estimate 50 percent penetration - more reasonably 10 percent, we believe
- even a Jefferies report states "Overall, physicians view current armamentarium of
hypotension drugs as adequate in treating severe hypotensive patients." Yet some really
bullish analysts estimate 116,000 patients, while we're estimating 75,000 to 105,000 max.


Also, if it clears clinical trials, LJPC-501 might find some use in limited, special cases of
cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis patients can develop potentially fatal conditions such as
bleeding, sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome (NYSE:HRS), resulting in progressive kidney

failure and sometimes death. But we have to remember, this iffy HRS use is years away
because enrollment in the early Phase 1-2 study is just occurring.


Nevertheless, we're estimating 115,000 patients, 10 percent market penetration, a
$10,000 cost (an improbable guesstimate with all kinds of insurance questions) and 35
percent chance of success in this HRS application.


This puts the cirrhosis use market opportunity at about $40 million.


So combined, the real potential valuation of La Jolla's remaining drug is ~$100 million.


*Even without removing erroneous assumptions, terrible earnings estimates


Shareholders' earnings estimates look pathetic, even before accounting for the lost
candidates. Check out the estimates below:

Not surprisingly, those estimates are backed by an equally pathetic earnings history:

*Very limited established institutional interest


On top of lost market opportunity and the earnings issues, we believe the institutional
interest constitutes another concern. Though many Class A institutional funds have been
rushing to add biotechs to their portfolios, their interest in La Jolla has been scattered and
minimal - shown here.

While some small institutional types have bought recently, share-wise, there have been a
lot more positions sold out than new positions established in La Jolla.

Also, let's take a look at a NASDAQ stock consultant chart that summarizes … yikes! …
where La Jolla stock stands in regard to bullish and bearish trends.


(Source: NASDAQ)


*Looming conversion of 8.2 million shares of preferred stock into common stock
poses extreme dilution to today's shareholders.


When the company converts preferred stock and lucky insiders exercise it, the current
15.2 million shares available for trading would shoot to 23.4 million shares.


This means a ~35 percent dilution to today's shareholders. So the value of today's $31
stock would be diluted to ~$21.


And the company states it "may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions
or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or
future operating plans."


Thus swinging the ol' dilution hammer again.


Conclusion: Don't be Cinderella
