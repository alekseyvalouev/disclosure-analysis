FuelCell's Backlog Faces A Steep Cliff

Summary


FuelCell's largest customer (POSCO) is going away.


Order levels have been too low to offset the POSCO loss and FuelCell is at risk of
missing estimates.


Due to the POSCO loss, we believe FuelCell's cash burn will accelerate.


We believe FuelCell (NASDAQ:FCEL) is a compelling short due to the steep cliff the
company faces as POSCO, its dominant customer, transitions away from FuelCell. Since
signing large one-time contracts from POSCO and Dominion in late 2012 and early 2013,
FCEL has signed few orders of any size for additional fuel cells. With the POSCO order
book running out, FCEL is at risk of missing estimates and seeing declines in sales and
increased losses. Our price target for FCEL is $1.00/share, for a potential return of 60%.


POSCO is a major customer that is going away


Over the past three years, POSCO has accounted for 44%, 76%, and 54% of revenues,
as per the latest 10-K (here).


When viewed in dollars, the amount from POSCO is striking.

Furthermore, we understand that POSCO accounts for essentially all of FCEL's remaining
$144.6 million and 95MW of product backlog. Unfortunately, that's almost completely
going away. According to the terms of the contract signed in 2012 (here), POSCO is
building its own manufacturing facility in South Korea that is expected to be operational in
2015. Once open, POSCO will stop ordering from FCEL, start manufacturing its own fuel
cell kits, and pay only a 3% royalty. In other words, if POSCO continues its current rate,
FCEL's revenues from POSCO will go from $101 million today to only $3 million once
POSCO opens its manufacturing plant! That is a 52% drop in total revenue from current
levels!


Order trends are not encouraging


The only way FCEL can offset the steep decline from POSCO is through significant new
orders. However, the volume of new orders over the last 4 consecutive quarters has been
anemic, to say the least. As a result, product backlog (the lifeline of the company) has
fallen nearly 45% since 1Q 2013.


Even if the company starts booking new product orders, they would have to be incredibly
large in order to offset the looming POSCO declines. We think this is highly unlikely due to
the high cost of FCEL's technology, which has only been implemented in areas with

stringent renewable mandates. While sell-side analysts expect significant growth in
revenues, we believe FCEL is facing dramatic revenue declines. Its order book and recent
orders make this clear.


Negative cash flows will accelerate


To make matters worse is FCEL's consistent cash drain. As of January 31, 2014, FCEL
had $104.6 million of cash, or only $0.41 per share. However, FCEL's cash drain over the
last 3 years has averaged $32 million per year, or $0.13 per share.


During the most recent quarter, FCEL had negative Cash Flow from Operations of $5
million and spent another $1 million on capital expenditures for a total of $6 million in
negative Free Cash Flow. On an annualized basis, this is another $0.09 per share of cash
that FCEL will quickly burn from its $0.41 per share balance.


Once POSCO transitions to its own manufacturing plant, we expect FCEL's cash drain to
become even more significant and put further strain on FCEL's share price.


Conclusion: 60% risk to FCEL share price


We think FCEL faces a significant risk once POSCO's current order backlog run outs. With
no large orders added to its backlog, FCEL faces a steep drop in revenues, significant
cash drain, and potential financial distress. We generously value FCEL at a more than
100% premium to its current cash balance of $0.41 per share and therefore give the stock
a price target of $1.00 per share. This represents nearly 60% downside from today's price.
