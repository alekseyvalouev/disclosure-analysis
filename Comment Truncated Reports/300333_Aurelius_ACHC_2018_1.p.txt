 Summary


We are short Acadia Healthcare (NASDAQ: ACHC) because the
company has concealed widespread patient abuse and neglect that
results from pervasive understa�ng at its facilities. At Acadia,
cutting sta�ng costs to the bone is the “secret sauce” used by
management to in�ate short term pro�ts. Acadia’s existence makes
the world a worse place because its business model depends on
acquiring new facilities and then degrading care, a losing proposition
that victimizes patients. We believe the fundamental problem for
investors is that Acadia’s slash and burn approach to behavioral
healthcare is inherently unsustainable and increasingly at risk of
unraveling.


CEO Joey Jacobs and his management team �rst used this recipe at
Psychiatric Solutions (PSI) a decade ago, where investors sued for
fraud alleging that Jacobs had “downplayed the alarming incidents of
abuse, neglect, and even death” at company facilities, ultimately
winning a $65 million settlement. After selling PSI to competitor UHS
in 2010 amidst regulatory investigations, Jacobs reassembled his
PSI executive team at Acadia to replicate this approach.  Once again,
we believe Jacobs has misrepresented the true nature of his
company to investors.


Over several months, we gathered and reviewed thousands of pages
of public documents including over 600 state and federal inspection
reports as well as court records, media reports, lawsuits, and police
records. We found that numerous patients, including children and
teenagers, have died due to alleged negligence or malpractice at
Acadia facilities. We found recurring reports of sexual abuse and
physical assaults on vulnerable patients that have allegedly been

perpetrated by Acadia employees or unmonitored patients.  We
found repeated instances of patient neglect or de�cient care linked
directly to sta�ng problems at Acadia facilities.  We found a pattern
of whistleblower allegations made by former employees who say
Acadia retaliated against them after they reported fraud or
misconduct.


Acadia’s undisclosed problems are not isolated to just a few bad
facilities or a handful of rogue employees. We found indications of
understa�ng or de�cient care at over 75 Acadia facilities in 24
states. Not only did we uncover problems at the majority of Acadia’s
U.S. inpatient hospitals, which in aggregate generate 43% of the
company’s U.S. revenue, but we also �agged signi�cant issues within
Acadia’s national network of outpatient addiction facilities. We have
posted extensive source documents at www.acadiaexposed.com,
where we will individually pro�le 30 of Acadia’s most problematic
facilities in a series of additional releases. Some of these facilities
are also reportedly under government investigation, have received
patient referral holds, or are being permanently closed.


Acadia’s true business model is premised on borrowing billions of
dollars to acquire behavioral health facilities, then wringing out
pro�ts by cutting sta�ng expenditures while increasing beds.
Underspending on sta�ng temporarily juices pro�ts, because it’s the
company’s largest expense, but it leads to chaos, violence, and
de�cient care since many patients are vulnerable or dangerous and
need substantial direct attention. That’s why government inspections
have repeatedly attributed patient death and neglect at Acadia
facilities to problems with both the quantity and quality of staff.


Up until now, Acadia was able to conceal the extent of its problems
because most investors hadn’t connected the dots between the vast
number of disparate public documents and local news reports that
repeatedly detail deaths and assaults at problematic Acadia facilities
across the country.  Also, many of Acadia’s victims are young,
disabled, or suffer from serious disorders that makes it di�cult for
them to sue the company or publicize what happened to them. Now
that the truth has emerged, we anticipate that Jacobs will attempt to
falsely depict these problems as isolated and sensationalized or the

product of past issues or di�cult patients – this is exactly what he
tried to do after journalists exposed similar problems at PSI.


The truth coming out hurts Acadia because it contradicts Jacob’s
claims and leads to increased public scrutiny.  The stock price of
competitor American Addiction Centers has lost nearly 75% of its
value since a short seller reported that the company was covering up
patient deaths. Former employees, including that company’s
President, were criminally indicted by the State of California for
second degree murder in 2015 for the death of a patient (the murder
charge was later dismissed). At Acadia, not only are there
undisclosed criminal indictments and convictions of former
employees for the death or assault of patients, but we found
allegations that Acadia has:


Destroyed evidence


Falsi�ed documents


Duped regulators during audits


Covered up incidents of patient abuse


Submitted �ctitious billings to the government


Failed to disclose regulatory investigations involving certain
facilities


Retaliated against multiple whistleblowers


As undisclosed problems have mounted, Acadia’s four top o�cers
dumped over $40 million worth of stock last year—with Jacobs
divesting half of his stake and later purchasing a portion of the
Nashville Predators professional hockey team.  Acadia’s top �ve
o�cers have received more than $63 million in compensation over
the past three �scal years under the watch of a Compensation
Chairman, Wade Miquelon, who was charged by the SEC last month
for “misleading investors” during his tenure as Walgreens CFO.


We believe Acadia’s pro�ts are largely �eeting. History demonstrates
that roll-up business models like Acadia unravel when the underlying
�nancial engineering driving the reported �nancials loses
momentum. This is precisely what we see starting to happen.
Because Acadia’s costs have already been cut to the bone, the
company has exhausted its primary means of driving pro�ts from

existing facilities.  Acadia has missed earnings estimates two of the
past four quarters and same facility revenue growth is slowing while
facility expenses have started to increase. We believe sta�ng
expenses are likely to increase signi�cantly as scrutiny from the
public and regulators intensi�es because Acadia will face increased
pressure to improve patient care. But Acadia has over $3.2 Billion in
debt it needs to service, which leaves the company little room to
weather increased expenses or reduced revenues.  We therefore see
signi�cant downside potential in Acadia shares.


A video presentation on Acadia Healthcare can be found here.


Systemic Patient Abuse, Neglect, and Understa�ng Infects Acadia
Facilities Across the Country.


Acadia investors have been led to believe the company is isolated
from the fraud and patient care scandals that have historically
plagued other publicly traded behavioral health companies such as
Psychiatric Solutions (PSI), Universal Health Services (UHS), and
American Addiction Centers (AAC).  CEO Joey Jacobs has publicly
claimed that “everybody wants to be Acadia”, while the sell-side, for
example, has touted that “claims about understa�ng typically are
focused on ACHC’s competitors” and “fraud, abuse in behavioral
industry mainly limited to the addiction segment, where ACHC has a
small presence”. But this narrative is simply false.


Because sta�ng is Acadia’s single largest expense, currently
representing roughly 53% of total revenues, we believe that Jacobs
and his team have in�ated short-term reported pro�ts by cutting
sta�ng expenses at Acadia facilities to unsafe levels.  Yet having
appropriate sta�ng, in terms of both quantity and quality of people,
is critical because some patients are dangerous to themselves and
others, requiring intense supervision and precise administration of
treatment. A senior industry executive with over 20 years of
experience told us that “the way to think about it is that if you cut
sta�ng or hire the wrong people, you’re more likely to have an adverse
event”. This is exactly why we believe underspending on sta�ng
makes it so di�cult for many Acadia facilities to properly supervise
and protect vulnerable patients, much less treat them effectively.

The nexus between understa�ng and de�cient patient care at
Acadia is demonstrated by our analysis of Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (“CMS”) inspection reports. Although Acadia
operates 209 behavioral healthcare facilities nationwide, 43% of its
US revenue (over $775 million) comes from acute inpatient facilities.
CMS typically inspects hospitals at least every four years but will
conduct more frequent inspections in the event of complaints or
problems. We located CMS inspection reports for 31 of the 40 US
hospitals listed on Acadia’s website. Federal inspectors uncovered
sta�ng de�ciencies at 28 of the 31 Acadia hospitals we reviewed,
including repeated violations for not having enough nurses or
quali�ed practitioners on hand.  Of the 28 hospitals that had sta�ng
de�ciencies, 25 were also cited by inspectors for having de�ciencies
related to patient safety or care, including violations involving patient
deaths, suicides, elopements (escapes), improper or erroneous
administration of medications, improper use of restraints, and
physical or sexual assaults.  Inspectors also found managerial
de�ciencies at 27 of the 31 facilities we reviewed, which includes
failures to report incidents to law enforcement or even investigate
patient abuse allegations, and failures to provide proper oversight or
follow or establish appropriate patient safety protocols.


Our analysis indicates that Acadia’s hospitals are also measurably
worse than its publicly traded competitor UHS. We compared the
results of 70 CMS inspection reports of Acadia facilities from 2015-
2017 to 153 CMS inspection reports we found for 58 different UHS
behavioral hospitals over the same time period.  The Acadia facilities
averaged 4.8 violations per inspection, 60% higher than the 3
violations per inspection averaged by the UHS facilities. Our review
found that Acadia facilities also received more violations per
inspection involving patient safety or care de�ciencies (double) and
sta�ng problems (quadruple).  We consider this performance
especially poor since some UHS facilities have well known problems
that have attracted signi�cant media scrutiny as well as multiple
criminal and civil government investigations.

The conditions inside Acadia’s facilities claim real victims. Examples
of undisclosed incidents include:


Note: This report references numerous lawsuits, regulatory
documents, and criminal proceedings. You should assume that
Acadia or the referenced defendants deny all allegations. Some of the
referenced lawsuits have been settled, dismissed, or removed.


A �ve-year-old boy was killed in June 2017 at Acadia’s Ascent
Children’s, a chain of youth facilities in Arkansas. Staffers left
the boy inside a hot van with a disabled safety alarm,
resulting in felony manslaughter indictments of four former
Acadia employees. This month, the facility abruptly
announced it would permanently close all of its seven
facilities. State o�cials had launched an additional
investigation in December into incidents of alleged child
maltreatment at the center.


Police are investigating two recent patient deaths and a
sexual assault at Acadia’s Park Royal Hospital in Florida,
according to a February 2018 media report. Federal
inspectors have �agged patient safety issues at the hospital,
which has a pattern of patient abuse that has already seen
one former Acadia employee imprisoned for raping 11
patients.

Patient referrals to Acadia’s Ohio Hospital for Psychiatry
were temporarily halted in May 2018, after patient safety and
sta�ng issues were revealed on a website created by an area
rights group. A sexual assault allegedly perpetrated by an
Acadia nurse with a history of disciplinary actions is the
latest following what a local news outlet reported as “years
of complaints, state investigations and violations of safety
and care standards”.


Acadia staff members allegedly assaulted children and
“would encourage kids to �ght for their entertainment”
according to a February 2018 local news investigation into
Acadia’s Resource Residential youth facility in Indiana. The
Indiana Department of Child Services placed a referral hold at
the facility in April 2018, according to a local news report,
meaning that they will not send any more kids to the facility.


In June 2018, CMS inspectors declared Immediate Jeopardy,
commonly interpreted as a “crisis situation”, at Acadia’s
Lakeland Behavioral hospital after CMS directed an
unannounced inspection that found “the facility failed to
protect two patients from sexual misconduct”. Inspectors
had previously declared Immediate Jeopardy in 2017 after
�nding the facility failed to prevent patient assaults.


Federal inspectors last year discovered that 26 patient deaths
went unreported to the governing body of Acadia’s Rolling
Hills Hospital in Oklahoma in 2016 alone. According to a
lawsuit, reports of sexual assaults against young patients
triggered government investigations “which resulted in the
removal of all DHS [Oklahoma Department of Human
Services] children” from the premises.


At Acadia Montana, state inspectors documented “128
patient assaults” that occurred during a 13 week review
period in 2016. According to inspectors, “Staff reported the
facility is understaffed” and one resident reported that
staffers watch porn in front of the kids.


Multiple instances of child abuse by staff at Acadia’s
Capstone Academy in Michigan have been substantiated by
state child welfare investigators. We obtained a December
2017 letter (see page 41) to the facility from the Michigan
Department of Health and Human Services which demands,

plans have not obtained and maintained compliance for rules
found in repeat noncompliance”.


After a vulnerable child was assaulted by an Acadia staffer at
Sonora Behavioral in Arizona, federal inspectors found that
the facility failed to report the incident to the parents or
police in 2016. A string of young patients have died at the
facility and inspection reports detail numerous other
violations including understa�ng, medication errors, and
failures involving patient injuries.


Two patients died due to allegedly being improperly treated
with dangerous medications at Acadia’s Seven Hills Hospital
in Nevada, according to two wrongful death suits (here, here).
The doctor accused of the misconduct is still practicing at
the hospital.


Arkansas regulators reportedly opened an investigation into
Acadia’s Piney Ridge Treatment Center in 2016 after parents
and former patients told local reporters the facility actually
operates “more like a kid’s �ghting ring”. A former facility
staffer was arrested in April 2018 and charged with one
felony count of engaging children in sexually explicit
conduct.  Former employees told a local news stations that
Piney Ridge overlooked the misconduct and had attempted
to “sweep it under the rug”.


Undercover footage of patient brutality at an Acadia facility in
the UK was aired on Dispatches in February 2018 including
evidence of severe understa�ng and improper safety
practices.


A teenage girl was violently raped by another resident at
Acadia’s Valley Behavioral facility in Arkansas because of low
sta�ng at the facility, according to a negligence suit �led in
2016 against Acadia. A 10 year old patient was raped in the
presence of a van driver who has subsequently pleaded guilty
to a felony, according to a lawsuit �led against Acadia and
the van company that is reportedly headed to trial in late
2018.


A malpractice suit �led in 2017 states that “a detective
threatened to shut down the Longleaf Hospital”, an Acadia
facility in Louisiana, after an adolescent patient was

assaulted by Acadia representatives who then “obstructed
and prevented several law enforcement o�cers from
entering the facility”.


Violations surrounding a patient’s death and incidents of
abuse and neglect are highlighted in a series of recent
federal inspections of Acadia’s Cross Creek Hospital in
Texas.


Inspectors found that a patient who staff “failed to monitor”
died after a series of falls at Acadia’s StoneCrest Center.
Federal inspectors were told by a patient that “all the staff
were sleeping, even the nurse” and uncovered numerous
patient safety de�ciencies including “unmet care needs”.
They also found indications that patients were “coerced into
taking medications or receiving treatment that they did not
agree to” by the nurses.


Two patients committed suicide in a �ve day period last year
at Acadia’s Belmont Behavioral Hospital, according to a state
inspection and a lawsuit that blames understa�ng.


In addition to instances of abuse, federal inspectors report
that senior citizens failed to receive basic care such as baths
and wound treatment at Acadia’s Delta Medical Center.


Our investigation also found problems within Acadia’s national
network of addiction centers, treatment clinics, and residential
facilities. Acadia is soliciting taxpayer funds by promoting itself as a
solution to America’s Opioid addiction crisis. Jacobs has told
investors that “we have lobbyists in every state, working with states
and communicating our position on how we think this money [opiate
crisis funding] should be used”.  But our analysis of inspection
reports for outpatient facilities in various states indicates that
Acadia is providing de�cient care to many of these patients.  To
illustrate this point, we reviewed inspection reports for 36 Acadia
addiction facilities in Pennsylvania, which we chose to sample
because Acadia derives 7% of its total revenue from Pennsylvania,
more than any other state.  Pennsylvania inspectors uncovered 542
violations at these Acadia addiction centers since 2015 including
de�ciencies related to patient safety, treatment, and/or sta�ng at
97% the locations. Not only did inspectors �nd that patients often
lack basic treatment, but Acadia invests so little in some of these

facilities that that inspectors found locations infested with rodents,
mold, and even bullet holes in the windows.


 


Slash & Burn: The True Nature of Acadia’s Business Model


Acadia’s CEO Joey Jacobs and his management team previously ran
PSI which pursued a roll-up strategy focused on aggressively cutting
costs at acquired facilities. ProPublica and the LA Times published
an investigative series on PSI a decade ago which exposed patient
deaths, assaults, and how “poor patient supervision, understa�ng
and inadequate worker training have led to instances of chaos and
brutality”.


The Department of Justice and other regulators opened
investigations into PSI and at least four whistleblowers �led lawsuits
alleging misconduct or fraud at the company. PSI investors sued
Jacobs and the company for fraud in 2009 alleging that Jacobs had
“downplayed the alarming incidents of abuse, neglect, and even
death” at company facilities because PSI had become “addicted to
debt” and needed to cover up its operating problems:


Above:  Civil Action No. 3:09-cv-00882-WJH.  The suit was settled by
UHS for $65 million without admitting guilt, Jacobs and PSI denied


the allegations.


After selling PSI to UHS in 2010, Joey Jacobs founded Acadia in
2011 with �ve other former PSI executives.  Jacobs has replicated
PSI’s roll-up strategy at Acadia, thus far acquiring over $5 Billion
worth of behavioral healthcare facilities while hiring certain former

PSI lieutenants to run and oversee them. Like PSI, our research
demonstrates that cutting sta�ng expenses is the heart of Acadia’s
business model.


Acadia’s �nancials show that the company’s sta�ng expenditures
have declined sharply over the past eight years. Acadia’s reported
same-facility salary, wages, and bene�ts (“SWB”) expressed as a
percentage of revenue, essentially an “apples to apples” comparison
of facility level sta�ng expenditures, has declined from 62.1% of
sales in 2010 to 51.2% in in June 2018.  SWB expenses had declined
6 of the past 8 years, but began to increase slightly in 2017 and so
far this year.

Sta�ng problems at Acadia are consistently detailed in CMS
inspection reports. CMS requires sta�ng to be based on the needs,
or “acuity,” of the patient population. More staff per patient is
required when the facility has more patients requiring intense, at
times one-on-one, care than others.  For instance, the Behavioral
Health Executive explains that facility policies typically call for
checks on suicidal or dangerous patients at least every 15 minutes
and “the failure could be that you haven’t hired enough staff to do the
check”. Federal inspectors have repeatedly attributed patient deaths
to Acadia’s failures to properly perform such checks:

Inspectors have also repeatedly found that Acadia facilities simply
don’t have enough nurses or staff to properly care for patients. For
instance, after inspectors found Acadia’s Options Behavioral did not
come close to meeting the required 1:6 licensed nurse to patient
ratio in 2017, the Director of Nursing admitted that “she was aware of
the short staff and the management was also fully aware regarding
the short staff issue”.

During an April 2018 CMS inspection of Acadia’s Cedar Crest
Hospital in Texas, inspectors found that “units were not staffed to
facility sta�ng standards, often resulting in injuries to both patients
and staff as well as patient elopements”.  Staff members told the
inspectors that “it’s terrible here. There’s no staff. It’s not safe”, “we
have begged for help”, “there’s never enough staff to take care of the
patients”.  Another staff member explained that “it’s outrageous…
patients physically intervene because we don’t have enough staff on
the unit. Sometimes interns are used as subs for staff coverage…
sometimes we breakdown and cry… The CEO knows what is going on
in this hospital. He knows we are understaffed”.

Acadia also appears to increase pro�ts by crowding more beds into
facilities without adding enough staff. For example, the CEO of
Acadia’s Longleaf Hospital admitted to inspectors he “was aware of
the ‘broken system’ of the hospital”. Longleaf’s Medical Director told
inspectors that “it became di�cult to staff” the facility because
“since the current owners [Acadia] acquired the hospital, they have
grown and increased beds by 24. As soon as more beds became
available, there was more pressure to admit more patients”.  When
inspectors asked a nurse if patient safety incidents at the hospital
are connected to inadequate sta�ng, she stated “it’s absolutely
horrendous, they put people on the schedule they know won’t show up,

people who aren’t even there”.  Inspectors also found instances of
alleged patient abuse and wrote that Longleaf “provided the
opportunity for alleged perpetrators to continue to provide direct
patient care”.   When inspectors spoke with the facility’s risk
manager she “indicated she ‘could cry right now’…she had only been
in the position manager of Risk Manager for 5 months and had a 3 day
training with corporate staff”.

At Harbor Oaks, an Acadia facility in Michigan, former employees say
that Acadia deceived regulators by increasing sta�ng levels
immediately prior to audits before quickly reducing it again after the
inspectors left. A detailed recent investigation of Harbor Oaks aired
by WXYZ News in Detroit featured interviews with four former
employees who described how Acadia understaffed the facility to
maximize pro�ts. The WXYZ investigation detailed multiple alleged
instances of patient neglect and violence, including “scores” of
police reports regarding physical and sexual assaults as well as 76
OHSA reports of workplace violence.  One whistleblower says that
she was tasked with overseeing 32 patients by herself and sustained
severe injuries after being attacked by a large patient.

Inspections we reviewed also repeatedly suggest that Acadia has
limited the availability of medical professionals or hired unquali�ed
or improperly trained staff, further degrading patient care. This is a
serious issue because patients suffering from psychological
disorders or addiction often require skilled and personalized care to
get better. A former senior employee of CRC Healthcare we spoke
with explained that after Acadia acquired the company in 2015,
Jacobs and his team cut millions in costs by gutting successful
corporate programs speci�cally designed to track and improve
patient outcomes:


When Acadia acquired us, they dumped it all… In service
of the bottom line, they decided to let all the clinical
work that we had done go… Do I think the quality of care
has gone down in many of the facilities there? I
absolutely do. Do I think the outcomes aren’t as good as
they were? I absolutely do.

For example, after multiple young patients died at Acadia’s Sonora
Behavioral, inspectors found that the only Acadia staff person
working in the unit during one of these deaths “was not quali�ed” and
“his/her only documented prior employment was as a ‘driver’”
(below).  A local news investigation from May 2018 identi�ed other
sta�ng problems including “a nurse without a valid license to work in
Arizona, a behavioral health technician who assaulted a child patient,
and a nurse accused of being drunk on the job”.

In February, a former nurse at Acadia’s Resource Residential told a
local news outlet investigating problems at the youth facility that “the
majority of the employees are young and vastly underquali�ed”.  She
also said she was aware of misconduct including a “male staff
member who engaged in sexual activity with the female residents”:


Similarly, a whistleblower suit (here) �led in August 2017 by the
former Human Resources Director of Acadia’s Paci�c Grove
Hospital. The suit alleges that she was �red after reporting “unsafe
and illegal practices within the hospital” including staff operating
without requisite training, licensure, or background checks. We note
that federal inspectors declared an immediate jeopardy situation at
Paci�c Grove in 2016 after �nding problems impacting the “safety of
patients related to unsafe use of restraints and seclusion”.

Sta�ng was so thin at Acadia’s Fashion Valley Treatment Center in
California “that non-medical personnel such as the secretary were
making treatment decisions”, according to allegations made in a
different whistleblower suit �led in May 2018 by a former nurse
(here).  The nurse explains that serious problems began to surface
after Acadia began to slash the sta�ng at the facility while cutting
corners “because Acadia wanted to increase their total number of
patients and reach their quotas”. The suit also says that chaos
ensued causing patients to become increasingly frustrated and
violent while “Clinical and Regional Directors would make the nurses
back date patients intake and other forms”.  The nurse says she
reported her concerns to Acadia’s corporate o�ce, but the company
retaliated in “an attempt to silence” her before she was terminated.
 Similar allegations were made in an additional whistleblower suit
(here) �led in September by a former Fashion Valley counselor who
also says she was �red after reporting “unlawful and/or unethical
conduct with respect to patient treatment” as well as “practices to
in�ate the patient and/or billing �gures”.

At Acadia’s Vermillion Behavioral inspectors noted “psychiatrists
failing to participate in the patient’s treatment team as stipulated in
the by-laws”.  A psychiatrist told inspectors that even though
patients were being admitted under her name, in reality, “she had very
little oversight at this hospital”.  An Acadia nurse explained that
“patients are admitted under [the psychiatrist’s] services, but she [the
nurse] treats them”.

As previously mentioned, Federal inspectors last year discovered that
26 patient deaths went unreported to the governing body of Acadia’s
Rolling Hills Hospital in Oklahoma in 2016 alone. The Senior Industry
Executive told us this is “a huge problem, that’s mind-boggling”. The
inspectors also found that “the hospital failed to ensure a registered
nurse (RN) supervised and evaluated the nursing care for each
patient…this occurred in 28 of 28 open and closed medical records
reviewed”. In total, inspectors have documented 64 separate
violations at this facility since Acadia �rst acquired it in 2012,
including “failed practices” related to patient care, sta�ng, and even
failures to investigate allegations of patient abuse.

Two different lawsuits (here, here) were �led in December 2017
against Acadia by guardians of former Rolling Hills patients, one of
whom allegedly suffered permanent brain damage after being
violently assaulted at the hospital.  The other suit describes how a
boy was raped by another patient who had a history of alleged
assaults (and has subsequently pled guilty) at an a�liated group
home owned and operated by Acadia. The suit alleges that “Acadia
ordered its employees to remove security cameras and to destroy
video surveillance footage”, failed to report the incident to police, and
ejected a state case worker from the premises.  Also, according to
the lawsuit, additional reports of sexual assaults triggered
government investigations “which resulted in the removal of all DHS
[Oklahoma Department of Human Services] children” from the
premises. Area media reports con�rm that this Acadia facility has
indeed been closed.

Joshua Edwards vs Rolling Hills Hospital (2017)


Acadia facilities often treat children and teens, many of whom have
been placed under Acadia’s care after incidents of abuse by their
former caregivers. But we found evidence of violence, abuse, and
neglect at Acadia youth facilities driven by sta�ng problems,
including previously mentioned episodes at Ascent Children’s,
Capstone Academy (Detroit Behavioral), Piney Ridge, and Resource
Residential.  At Acadia Montana, state inspectors documented “128
patient assaults and 26 incidents of residents causing property
damage occurring during this 13 week review period” in 2016.  This
followed a 2015 “statement of de�ciency report citing the facility is
not providing a safe environment” issued by the department after
inspectors reported “the facility has had 132 patient assaults” during
that 13 week review period.  The inspectors wrote “the facility failed
to implement signi�cant changes in programming in order to ensure
patient safety and reduce the number of serious incidents as
indicated in the plan of correction”. According to inspectors “youth
reported not feeling safe in the facility due to physical assaults by
peers and lack of staff intervention” and “Staff reported the facility is
understaffed”. One resident reported that staff even watch porn in
front of the kids.

We also found indications that overtaxed Acadia medical providers
resort to using chemical restraints—i.e. deliberately overmedicating
patients for the convenience of Acadia’s staff.  For example, a state
inspection of Acadia’s Options Behavioral “determined that the on-
call physician wrote orders for chemical restraints in con�ict with the
facility policy that restricted this practice”.  Federal inspectors also
found that this facility “failed to have adequate numbers of licensed
registered nurses to provide nursing care”.

This practice appears to have been going on for some time. At
Acadia’s Red River Hospital in Texas, a whistleblower suit �led by a
former employee in 2012 alleges that patients were neglected and
references a recording of an elderly patient left strapped to a chair
for an entire 12-hour shift while being periodically injected with
sedatives by Acadia staff.  According to the suit, the neglect was the
product of an allegedly fraudulent campaign to get more elderly
Medicare patients in the door to increase revenues for Acadia even
though the facility didn’t have the resources to properly treat the
patients.

We See Substantial Downside Potential in Acadia Shares


Acadia’s business model is premised on borrowing billions of dollars
to acquire behavioral health facilities, then wringing out pro�ts by
cutting sta�ng and patient care expenditures while adding beds. The
fundamental problem, in our opinion, is that this model is inherently
unsustainable because it depends on degrading patient care- a
losing proposition. The consequences of Jacob’s slash and burn
approach to behavioral healthcare, which has caused many of the
problems we found at Acadia facilities across the country, now
appear to be spilling over into Acadia’s �nancials.


The true nature of Acadia’s business practices �nally coming to light
hurts the company because it contradicts management’s public

claims and increases public scrutiny. The former UHS facility CEO
told us that after Buzzfeed published articles exposing patient safety
issues at UHS, there was an “immediate impact” and “Once an article
like that goes out, �rst of all, any provider in the local market won’t
hardly dare send you a patient, because they don’t want to be
associated with it.”  Loved ones also become less likely to send
family members to facilities associated with patient safety scandals
or misconduct. This dynamic already appears to have begun at
Acadia’s Ohio Hospital of Psychiatry, where referrals were
temporarily halted earlier this year after an area rights group
released a report. Similarly, the Indiana Department of Child Services
placed a referral hold at Acadia’s Resource Residential youth facility
in April 2018, meaning that they will not send any more kids to the
facility.


Based on the recurring problems in inspection reports we reviewed,
we �nd it likely that state and federal regulators have already begun
to scrutinize Acadia’s business practices. The former UHS facility
CEO also explained that increased inspections, investigations, and
potential �nes or facility closures is why “It’s a painful sentence once
you’re on the [regulatory] radar. Plus, it’s worth the extra bodies [proper
sta�ng] to stay off the radar, it’s worth it.”  AAC’s stock price has lost
75% of its value since news of criminal indictments broke, while UHS
has closed over 20 facilities since 2011 amidst myriad government
investigations. Just this month, Acadia’s Ascent Children’s
announced that it would permanently close all seven of its facilities
after Arkansas regulators opened an investigation into child
maltreatment and four former employees were criminally indicted for
the death of a young boy.


Furthermore, the Department of Justice and other regulators have
historically charged operators for billing for de�cient care (here, here,
here), which strikes us as a particularly acute risk for Acadia given
that multiple whistleblowers have accused the company of
fraudulent practices.


We believe Acadia’s pro�ts are largely �eeting. Since Acadia’s costs
have already been cut to the bone, the company has exhausted its
primary means of driving pro�ts from existing facilities.  As scrutiny
from the public and regulators intensi�es, we believe Acadia will

likely be pressured to improve patient care, driving up operating
costs signi�cantly. This dynamic already appears to have started.


Acadia has missed earnings estimates two of the past four quarters
and same facility revenue growth is slowing while facility expenses
have started to increase. We estimate that Acadia will need to
increase sta�ng expenditures by at least 10-20% to improve patient
care, which would cost Acadia approximately $150 to $300 million in
incremental annual expenses and reduce reported EBITDA by 25-
50%.  For context, we spoke to the CEO of a privately-owned facility
who has over a decade of experience, including at UHS. The Private
Facility CEO estimates that his current facility has 40 to 50% more
staff relative to patients than the former PSI facility he managed at
UHS (which we believe approximates the sta�ng levels at Acadia). 
Unsurprisingly, he believes the patient care at his facility is much
improved and patient safety issues are now limited because he has
more staff than before.


Acadia has little room to weather increased expenses or reduced
revenues because it has over $3.2 billion in debt it needs to service. 
Leverage stands at more than 5x Debt/EBITDA, already at the high
end of Jacob’s stated objective of “operating not much higher than
the 5 times [Debt/EBITDA]”.  Acadia is also signi�cantly more levered
than PSI was, which was operating at approximately 3.7x
Debt/EBITDA in 2009 according to Bloomberg data.


We therefore see substantial downside potential in Acadia shares.
