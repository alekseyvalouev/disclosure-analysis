Concept:  
1.	
  The leading online student loan refinancing companies have launched student loan 
contributions as an employee benefit. Student loan contributions as an employee benefit should 
adversely affect SLM by increasing prepayments and loan refinancings in SLM’s portfolio. 
2. First Republic’s (FRC) December 2016 acquisition of Gradifi, a platform that enables student 
loan contributions as an employee benefit, should accelerate the trend of companies offering this 
benefit.  
3. Intuit announced a partnership with Earnest (December 2016) to use verified income data 
from TurboTax to streamline student loan refinancing. Out of TurboTax’s 28 mm users, over 5 
mm are said to have student loans. 
4. SLM’s disclosure surrounding the prepayment and refinancing of private student loans in its 
portfolio has been lacking, and, more recently, even disappearing. In an August 2016 comment 
letter, the SEC questioned SLM about its constant prepayment rate (CPR). 
 
Summary: SLM Corp. (SLM) is the largest originator of in-school private student 
loans (PSLs) in the US, with roughly 54% of the $9.1 B in annual originations.  
PSLs are marketed as a way for families to fill the financing gap between the cost 
of college and the financial aid packages, including federal student loans. PSLs are 
underwritten by private lenders and often require co-signers.  PSLs are unsecured 
debt, but since PSLs typically cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, PSLs should 
exhibit better default recoveries than other forms of consumer unsecured debt.  
 
 The private student loan market is still a relatively new asset class after 
emerging in the mid-1990s and after growing rapidly during the credit expansion 
and the for-profit school proliferation of the 2000s. PSL originations peaked in 
2008 at over $20 B, but, following the financial crisis and the shutdown of the PSL 
securitization market, PSL originations fell below $6 B in 2011, and three of the 
country’s largest banks began to exit the PSL origination business. 
 
 The exodus of the big banks from the PSL market led to an oligopoly with 
SLM, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Discover (DFS) funding over 90% of new PSL 
originations.  This oligopoly structure has resulted in very attractive margins for 
SLM’s PSL origination business, with its credit adjusted net interest margin (NIM) 
on PSLs well in excess of 500 bp, whereas many other lenders have credit adjusted 
NIMs closer to 300 bp.  While SLM is currently overearning on its loans, the 
student loan refinancing market appears to be at a critical inflection point, and we 
expect that SLM’s profitability will decline as new competitors refinance the better 
credit quality loans in SLM’s portfolio.   
 
 Three significant events have occurred in the last six months or so that 
indicate that loans in SLM’s portfolio will soon face both increased prepayments 
and more refinancing by competitors, thereby negatively impacting SLM’s 
economics as the average life of its loans decreases. SLM typically has 3% upfront 
origination expenses that it needs to recoup over the weighted average life of its 
loans, which it has previously stated to be 6 to 7 years.
3 


 
 When we previously issued a sell recommendation on SLM in July 2015, we 
highlighted that online student lenders such as SoFi, CommonBond, and Earnest 
had entered the student loan refinancing market. SoFi, in particular, was early to 
adopt a brilliant marketing strategy where it pitched student loan refinancing as an 
employee benefit to large corporations.  While such benefit programs have no cost 
to the employer, SoFi is able to leverage its sales and marketing efforts to target 
student loan refinancing candidates with verified employment.  CommonBond and 
Earnest both followed suit and began marketing student loan refinancing as a no 
cost employee benefit. 
 
 Starting in the Fall of 2016, all three of these companies (SoFi, 
CommonBond, and Earnest) launched services to administer payments platforms 
for employers to make student loan contributions on behalf of their employees, 
similar to how employers can make a 401 K contribution on behalf of their 
employees.  Currently only 4% of companies in the US offer such “student loan 
contribution benefits,” but according to a study by benefits consultant 
WillisTowersWatson, that penetration rate is expected to reach 20% by the end of 
2018. 
 
 Given that SLM’s PSL portfolio has an average interest rate above 8%, 
SLM’s PSLs are likely the highest cost student debt a borrower possesses (federal 
undergraduate student loan rates have averaged 4.67% the last 5 years) and any 
student loan contributions made by employers will likely be directed to pay down 
PSLs first before paying down federal student loans.  Additionally, federal student 
loans have advantageous features not common in PSLs, such as income based 
repayment (a borrower pays a certain percent of disposable income and the balance 
is forgiven after 10 years (if the borrower is a public service employee) to 25 years 
for private sector employees), so most financial advisors recommend paying down 
PSLs before federal student loan to retain such benefits. The standard $100 per 
month contribution being made by many employers participating in such student 
loan contribution programs would have the effect of shortening SLM’s average 
loan life by ~32% to 4.3 years from 6.4 years (with an 8% Constant Prepayment 
Rate, or CPR). 
 
 The second major recent negative event for SLM is First Republic’s (FRC) 
December 2016 acquisition of Gradifi, one of the leading administrators of student 
loan contribution benefits. Gradifi is considered one of the pioneers in 
administrating student loan contribution benefits, having signed up 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) in September 2015 (8,000 plus PWC employees 
currently on Gradifi platform), and more recently having signed Penguin Random 
House and Natixis Global Asset Management.  First Republic, which has a $77 B 
balance sheet and a $14.9 B market cap, had only recently entered student loan
4 


refinancing in 2015 and significantly grew its originations to over $700 mm in 
2016.  FRC has stated that it intends to offer student loan refinancing to Gradifi’s 
customers and has identified student lending as an area of focus so that it can 
identify its “next generation of clients” to whom it can sell mortgages and 
investment products in the future.  We have already found evidence of FRC 
dedicating resources to Gradifi by shifting FRC employees over to Gradifi in early 
2017 and by posting jobs to hire additional salespeople at Gradifi.    
 
 The third major negative development for SLM recently is the partnership 
that Intuit’s (INTU) TurboTax division announced with Earnest on December 13, 
2016 for student loan refinancing.  Given that student loan interest is tax deductible 
for single filers with $80 K or less in modified adjusted gross income ($160 K for 
married couples filing jointly), TurboTax can identify clients with student loans 
and claims that over 5 mm of its 28 mm users have student loans.  With its client’s 
consent, TurboTax will share client’s verified income data with Earnest to see if 
such clients are eligible to refinance their student loan.  TurboTax will receive a 
referral fee from Earnest if a refinancing loan is issued and Intuit has highlighted 
this program to its own investors as a strategic priority. 
 
 The verified income data (often from directly linked W-2s from an 
employer) housed in the TurboTax platform has the potential to greatly streamline 
the student loan refinancing process as well as reduce hard underwriting costs 
(excluding the referral fee paid to TurboTax).  Earnest, which has already 
refinanced over $1 B in student loans since launching its refinancing product in 
early 2015, is likely to become an even stronger competitor for SLM as result of 
this TurboTax partnership. 
 
 As the refinancing market for student loans has developed, SLM 
management’s disclosure regarding prepayments and the refinancing of loans in its 
portfolio has been inconsistent, and, at times, even disappearing. As we noted 
when we last covered SLM in 2015, the impact from prepayments and third party 
loan refinancing on SLM’s on-balance sheet portfolio was mitigated by SLM’s 
practice of selling more seasoned loans that are more prone to prepayment and 
refinancing into off-balance sheet securitizations whose performance would no 
longer be reported in its SEC filings. PSLs aren’t likely to be refinanced while a 
student is still in school, so the age, or seasoning, of the on-balance sheet loan 
portfolio is a key factor in assessing the impact of prepayments and loan 
refinancing by competitors. 
 
 SLM’s company line in its investor presentations regarding total 
prepayments (voluntary prepayments and defaults) previously was that “following 
the first year after disbursement, total prepayments have generally ranged about 
4%.”  That quote was a headline that was displayed above charts showing total
5 


prepayments for various loan vintages, i.e. 2014 Vintage, etc. in numerous SLM 
presentations from the time of the NAVI spin-off in May 2014 up until Q1 2016. 
Quite remarkably, SLM’s investor presentations continued including the “total 
prepayments have generally ranged about 4%” headline above charts that showed 
2011 vintage loans going from having a little over 4% total prepayments at 
12/31/14, to nearly 6% at 12/31/15.  2010 vintage loan data that were showing total 
prepayments of 7% as of 3/31/15 were conveniently removed from SLM’s 
presentations starting in Q415 due to “insufficient data” according to a footnote.  
SLM finally removed the “4% total prepayment” headline in its February/March 
2016 ABS Vegas presentation, and the previously released slides on total 
prepayments were removed entirely from SLM’s 1Q16 Investor Presentation for 
equity investors.   
 


According to SLM’s most recent loan data presentation showing total 
prepayment data at 3/31/17, the 2011 vintage loans’ total prepayments shoot up to 
over 8% at 6/30/16 and stay above 8% for the next two quarters through 12/31/16 
before reaching 9% at 3/31/17.  More concerning for SLM investors, however, is 
that every single one of SLM’s more recent loan vintages (2012 to 2015) have total 
prepayment rates that are trending noticeably higher than the 2011 vintage.  This 
accelerating prepayment and loan refinancing activity will increasingly start to 
negatively impact SLM’s earnings since SLM no longer sells loans into off-
balance sheet securitizations.  Below is a chart showing SLM’s most recent total 
prepayment data as of 3/31/17, (Source: SLM Smart Option Student Loan 
Historical Performance Data Period ended 3/31/17, slide 12):
6 


 
 
 SLM’s stock has risen over 76% to $12.53 from its $7.10 levels prior to the 
November 2016 election based on investors’ relief that Hilary Clinton’s proposed 
free college plan to households with less than $125 K in income wouldn’t be 
implemented, plus expectations for higher interest rates that might benefit SLM, 
and the potential opportunity for SLM if federal graduate student PLUS loans and 
parent PLUS loans are privatized during a Trump administration.   
 
 PLUS loans are federally issued student loans to either graduate students or 
parents that allow students to finance up to the total cost of their education (tuition, 
room, and board), whereas other federal loans have limits that often fall below the 
total cost of education.  Federal PLUS loans currently require very little 
underwriting other than that the borrower has no bankruptcy proceedings in the last 
5 years and does not have any recent 90 plus day delinquencies on debt.  PLUS 
loans are the student loan market’s version of a no-down payment mortgage, and 
as such, the addressable market of credit worthy PLUS borrowers is much smaller 
than the current size of the federal PLUS loan market. In an absolute best-case 
scenario, if graduate student PLUS loans are privatized by Fall 2018 / Spring 2019 
academic year, it adds a few pennies to SLM’s EPS in FY18 and 5 to 10 cents in 
FY19.
7 


 The “street” is almost unanimously bullish on SLM (with 10 Buys and 1 
Hold) and consensus FY18 EPS are projected to grow 27% to $0.90 from the $0.71 
midpoint of SLM management’s guidance ($0.70 - $0.72) for 2017.  Expectations 
for continued loan growth and for negligible competitor loan refinancing activity 
appears reflected in SLM’s valuation, as SLM is trading at 17.3x FY17 and 13.9x 
FY18 consensus EPS.  SLM management only recently acknowledged on its Q416 
results conference call that refinancing activity picked up in its portfolio, but has 
not commented on the potential impact of the 3 major recent events that form the 
basis of our short thesis.   
 


Due to accelerating prepayments and SLM’s loans being refinanced by 
competitors, we expect SLM’s FY18 EPS to fall short of consensus, at $0.85, and 
we expect that the investors will shift from the bullish thesis of loan growth to the 
realization that SLM’s excessive profitability is in secular decline.  We initiate 
coverage of SLM with a sell recommendation and an $8.50 price target, 32.2% 
below SLM’s current price.  Our $8.50 price target represents 10x our FY18 EPS 
of $0.85, a slight multiple premium to consumer lenders such as Capital One 
(COF) and Discover (DFS) that trade at 9.6x and 9.0x, respectively.  Our below 
consensus estimates are based on the expected increase in competition from online 
lenders offering student loan contribution employee benefits, from FRC’s strategic 
acquisition of Gradifi, and from Intuit’s recent partnership with Earnest to offer 
student loan refinancing to its 28 mm TurboTax users.

Background: 
 


SLM Corp’s history dates back to 1973 when the Student Loan Marketing 
Association (nicknamed “Sallie Mae”) was formed as a Government-Sponsored 
Enterprise (GSE) to support guaranteed federal student loans. SLM went public in 
1983 and benefitted from its GSE status by being able to issue GSE debt that was 
perceived to be guaranteed by the U.S. government. SLM began its privatization 
process from a GSE in 1997 and completed its privatization in 2004.   
 
 During the credit boom in the first part of the 2000s, SLM issued PSLs, in 
addition to its primary business of issuing federal student loans (Federal Family 
Education Loan Program, or “FFELP” loans), which were 97% guaranteed by the
8 


government.  At the height of the LBO boom in April, 2007, a consortium of J.C. 
Flowers, JPM and BAC offered to take SLM private in a $25 B transaction. The 
LBO of SLM fell apart in September, 2007 with the JC Flowers consortium 
claiming there was a Material Adverse Change (MAC) in SLM’s business due to 
new regulations (the College Cost Reduction and Access Act) that adversely 
impacted the economics of federal student loans.  
 
 Once issuance of FFELP loans was halted in 2010 and the US Treasury 
began directly funding all federal student loans, SLM’s business model lost one of 
its primary income streams. While the FFELP portfolio and servicing business 
would be in runoff, the PSL business, although dramatically smaller than its pre-
crisis levels, was profitable and growing, due to banks exiting the PSL market.  In 
order to highlight the value of its PSL business, SLM spun-off the legacy FFELP 
business, its servicing business for US Treasury funded federal student loans, and 
its pre-crisis PSL loan portfolio into a company called Navient (NAVI) on May 1, 
2014.   
  


After the financial crisis, three major banks stopped originating PSLs, likely 
because the small size of the market ($8 B to $9 B in annual originations) wasn’t 
worth the headache associated with the regulatory scrutiny and negative public 
opinion about student loans.  BAC stopped originating PSLs in 2009, Citi sold off 
its Student Loan Corp assets to SLM and DFS in 2010 and 2011, and JPM exited 
the PSL origination market in 2014.  The remaining in-school PSL origination 
market became an oligopoly, with SLM having over 50% share, WFC having 25% 
share, and DFS having 10% to 15% share.  This lack of competition has allowed 
SLM to earn a credit adjusted NIM over 500 bp, 2.3% ROAA, and a 16% ROE 
(23% ROE if leveraged at 10% equity/assets), but also has attracted new 
competition.   


 
Recognizing the lack of competition in the PSL market, CFG entered the 


market in 2009, and multiple venture-backed online lenders (SoFi, CommonBond, 
Earnest, Darien Rowayton Bank) launched products to exploit the attractive returns 
available in the PSL market.  CFG initially entered the in-school PSL market in 
2009 and launched its first refinancing loan product in early 2014, highlighting that 
the refinancing market for student loans is still in its early stages of growth.  CFG, 
which has a 1,200-branch network, has set the explicit goal to grow its PSL market 
share to 10% from less than 5% currently.  


 
OWS previously issued a sell recommendation on SLM on July 15, 2015 at 


$9.74 based on a short thesis centered on the emergence of the online refinancing 
lenders cherry picking SLM’s loan portfolio and CFG aggressively growing both 
its in-school originations and refinancing portfolio.  Investor sentiment on SLM 
turned very negative on SLM shortly after OWS’ initiation primarily due to Hillary
9 


Clinton campaigning to make public universities free for families earning less than 
$125 K, and because increased volatility in the legacy federal student loan ABS 
market related to the delayed repayment was causing spreads to widen for SLM’s 
PSL ABS, and due to news reports in August 2015 that SoFi was raising a massive 
$1B financing round at $4B valuation. SLM’s market cap at that time was about 
$3.5B, so SoFi’s $1B capital raise (closed 9/30/15) at a $4 B valuation proved that 
SoFi was no longer a start-up competitor to be dismissed.  OWS closed its Sell 
Recommendation on SLM at $6.94 in early October 2015 for a 29% gain in less 
than 3 months.   


 
While likely unbeknownst to most equity market investors, in October 2015 


SLM quietly restated the publicly disclosed Constant Prepayment Rates (CPRs) 
contained in the monthly servicer reports given to the ABS investors in its 
securitizations.  There was no disclosure in any of SLM’s SEC filings or equity 
investor presentations regarding this restatement. The CPRs for the three 
securitizations issued since the May 2014 NAVI spin-off are restated significantly 
lower than originally reported due to loans that prepaid that were then removed 
from the securitization pool.  The “since issued CPRs” for the three securitizations 
are restated downward by an average of 2.78 percent points, with the 2014-A 
deal’s CPR restated from 6.34% to 5.44%, the 2015-A deal’s CPR restated from 
7.23% to 5.08%, and the 2015-B deal’s CPR restated from 9.28% to 3.99%.  
Higher prepayment rates are evidence that borrowers are either refinancing their 
loans with other lenders or making additional payments beyond what is 
contractually due. 


 
In early 2016, a regulatory agreement limiting SLM’s balance sheet growth 


to 20% per year was lifted, paving the way for a shift in securitization strategy for 
SLM that would allow it to retain more of the loans it originates on its balance 
sheet.  Prior to the 20% growth limit being lifted, three of the first four 
securitizations that SLM completed since the NAVI spin-off were accounted for as 
“sales” where the loans were removed from the balance sheet and the equity 
tranches in the securitizations were sold to third party investors at a premium 
above par (typically 8% to 10% premiums), allowing SLM to book “gains on sales 
of loans” into its earnings.  Beginning in 2016, SLM would still access the 
securitization market as a source of low-cost term financing, but would structure 
the deals as “financings” where the loans remained on balance sheet and SLM 
would own the equity tranches in the securitizations. 


  
Due to the elimination of gain on sale income, which essentially pulls 


forward income, SLM’s EPS declined 10% from $0.59 in 2015 to $0.53 in 2016.  
While the change in securitization strategy had a near term earnings hit from the 
loss of gain on sale income, higher balance sheet growth for SLM longer term has 
the potential to be accretive, assuming, of course, that the loans SLM retains don’t
10 


prepay or get refinanced too quickly or default.  When SLM previously structured 
its securitizations as sales, it would receive an 8% to 10% premium relative to the 
loans’ principal amount at the time of sale, which was recognized as the gain on 
sale.  Now, with securitizations structured as financings, SLM earns its profit 
through its credit adjusted NIM of roughly 550 bp on declining loan principal 
balances that are amortizing.  The speed of such loan amortization, measured by 
CPRs and weighted average loan lives, are critical to SLM’s profitability, 
especially under SLM’s new strategy to retain loans and grow its balance sheet. 


 
While OWS’ 2015 short thesis on loan refinancing competition is being 


proved correct for both loans kept on-balance sheet and sold off balance sheet into 
securitizations, the competition for in-school undergraduate PSLs hasn’t 
materialized as quickly as we expected.  Over the last several years, SLM grew its 
market share of the undergraduate in-school PSL market to 54% from 50% in 
2014.  Most of SLM’s market share gains came from smaller competitors outside 
of the #2 to #4 competitors (WFC, DFS, and CFG).  The online lenders (SoFi, 
CommonBond, Earnest) had initially focused on refinancing both graduate and 
undergraduate loans as well as issuing in-school graduate loans, but haven’t 
heavily targeted the in-school undergraduate PSL market yet.   


 
SLM’s competition for in-school originations should now increase, however, 


as CommonBond announced on April 25, 2017 that it would start originating both 
undergraduate and graduate student in-school loans. CommonBond previously 
only made in-school loans to MBA graduate students.  Additionally, NAVI has 
publicly stated in its investor presentations that it views PSL origination as a 
growth opportunity once its non-compete with SLM ends on 12/31/18.   NAVI, 
which is permitted by its SLM non-compete to purchase PSLs in the secondary 
market, has already purchased $225 mm in PSL refinancing loans in 2016 and 
announced a deal on April 18, 2017 to buy $3.2 B in older PSLs from JPM. 
 


One newer online lender, College Ave, was founded in August 2014 to focus 
primarily on in-school PSLs, although it also offers refinancing loans and parent 
loans.  College Ave was co-founded by Joseph DePaulo, formerly SLM’s EVP of 
Banking from 2009 to 2014, who was listed as one of SLM’s top 3 executives in 
SLM investor presentations at the time of the NAVI spinoff.  College Ave 
announced a $30 mm financing round from Comcast Ventures on April 13, 2017, 
bringing its total equity capital raised to date to $70 mm, indicating that College 
Ave should have the resources to grow its in-school undergraduate PSL market 
share.  College Ave, headquartered in Delaware, appears to have already put some 
of its recent financing round to work, having hired, in March 2017, sales people in 
California with titles such as “Campus Development – West Region.”
11 


To achieve its recent market share growth, SLM has lowered its 
underwriting standards.  SLM’s investor presentations from the time of the NAVI 
spin-off up until the 1Q16 state that SLM receives approximately 1.3 mm loan 
applications per year and that its approval rate is about 35%.  In its 2Q16 investor 
presentation, SLM states that it still receives approximately 1.3 mm loan 
applications, but its approval rate is now 40%, implying that SLM’s approved loan 
applications grew by 65 K loans, or 14.3%, in 2016 to 520 K from 455 K.  All 
three of the underwriting credit metrics that SLM discloses for its originations 
(FICO scores, % cosigned, % making an in-school payment) likewise declined 
slightly in 2016 from 2015 levels. 2016 originations had an average FICO of 748, 
89% were cosigned, and 55% were making an in-school payments, down from 
749, 90%, and 56% in 2015, respectively.  Given the delayed seasoning 
characteristics of student loans, where full principal and interest payments aren’t 
due until after a 6 month grace period following a student’s graduation, the impact 
of looser credit standards by SLM may not be visible for several years. 
 


In April 2017, NY State approved legislation to offer free tuition at public 
universities for families making less than $125 k per year.  The plan goes into 
effect for the fall 2017 school year and starts with qualifying income level caps of 
$100 K in 2017, $110 K in 2018, and $125 k in 2019.  942 K families, or 75.7% of 
the total families with college age students in NY State, are expected to qualify for 
the $125 K income cap. NY is SLM’s largest market, representing 10.3% total 
education loans (both PSLs and FFELP loans) on SLM’s balance sheet at 12/31/16. 
 
Discussion: 
	
  
1.	
  The leading online student loan refinancing companies have all launched student 
loan contributions as an employee benefit. Student loan contributions as an 
employee benefit should adversely affect SLM by increasing prepayments and loan 
refinancings in SLM’s portfolio. 
 
 When OWS last had a sell recommendation on SLM in the summer of 2015, 
we noted that salespeople at SoFi were highlighting on their LinkedIN profiles that 
SoFi offered “student loan refinancing as an employee benefit.”  Such programs, 
which have no cost to the employer, typically involve either onsite presentations at 
an employer’s office by refinance lenders or an employer’s HR department 
informing employees of such refinancing programs. We admired SoFi’s marketing 
strategy that leverages sales and marketing spending at the same time as 
identifying large numbers of potential borrowers with verified employment. The 
other major online student loan (SL) refinancing lenders, such as CommonBond 
and Earnest, have started similar programs.
12 


 Such SL refinancing employee benefit programs typically involve no cost to 
the employer, but employers can choose to subsidize part of the interest rate 
reduction that employees receive on their refinanced loan.  Apple announced in the 
Fall 2014 a subsidized SL refinancing program for both employees with SLs and 
employees’ children with SLs, where Apple pays part of the interest rate 
deduction.  One of SoFi’s corporate customers, Meredith Corporation, also allows 
its employees whose children have SLs to participate in its refinancing program.  
An HR representative from Meredith stated in a Crains Chicago Business article 
that 200 Meredith employees were approved for SL refinancing loans within the 
first 60 days of the August 2016 launch.   
 
 Separate from offering SL refinancing as an employee benefit, the major 
new development that was ramping up in 2H16 is that companies have also started 
offering SL contributions as an employee benefit, similar to how companies can 
make contributions to their employees’ 401 K plans.  The adoption of such SL 
contribution plans started to emerge when Gradifi (acquired by First Republic 
(FRC) in Dec 2016) signed up Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) in September 
2015 for a contribution plan that began in the summer of 2016.  PWC, which hires 
11,000 new graduates in the US per year, is offering to make SL contributions of 
$100 per month for up to six years for employees. The typical contribution by 
employers that have signed up to offer such benefits seems to be $1,200 per year, 
although the range of announced plans we have found is $500 to $6,000 per year, 
as shown in Table 1 below.

 Given PSLs usually are variable rate loans and have interest rates much 
higher than federally issued SLs, employees receiving SL contribution payments
13 


from their employers are likely to use the contributions to pay down their high 
interest rate PSL debt.  The average yield of PSL loans on SLM’s balance sheet 
during the 1Q17 is 8.26% (with 82% variable rate/18% fixed rate) versus the 
4.67% average fixed rate for federally issued undergraduate loans the last five 
years.  The interest rates for federal direct unsubsidized loans for undergraduates 
have fallen dramatically over the last five years (2012 – 6.8%, 2013 – 3.86%, 2014 
– 4.66%, 2015 – 4.29%, and 2016 – 3.76%), indicating that the PSLs currently on 
SLM’s balance sheet (2.1 year average age at 12/31/16) have an interest rate 
roughly 400 bp higher than the federal SL fixed interest rate for the same vintage 
year. Additionally, given federal SLs have favorable forbearance protection 
features relative to PSLs (such as income driven repayment which can lead to loan 
forgiveness after 10 to 25 years), borrowers logically should pay down PSLs prior 
to paying down lower interest rate federal loans to preserve their loan forgiveness 
optionality on their federal SLs. 
 
 The negative impact to the unit economics of SLM’s PSL business from 
employers adopting SL contribution employee benefits is rather significant.  As 
Table 2 below shows, if the standard $100/month employer contribution is made to 
SLM’s average original loan balance of $10 K, a typical 10 year payback period 
loan (after graduation and 6-month grace period) would be completely paid off in 
4.5 years.  Given that employer contributions will likely be used to pay down 
principal, the amount of principal amortization would increase by over 187% 
during each of the loan’s first 4 years, meaningfully reducing SLM’s interest 
income. SLM’s interest income from the loan would rapidly decline as more 
principal is paid down sooner, with interest income dropping 8.9%, 23.5%, 42.2%, 
66.7%, and 95.1% in years 1 through 5, respectively, relative to the contractual 
interest income if the loan had stayed outstanding for its full 10-year maturity. The 
economic impact would be even worse for SLM if a borrower started receiving SL 
contribution benefits upon beginning employment during the 6-month grace period 
following graduation.

Perhaps the even greater competitive threat to SLM’s business from this 
trend of employers offering SL contribution benefits is that SL refinancing lenders 
are also the largest administrators or processors of these benefits. When SoFi, 
CommonBond, Earnest, and Gradifi (now with FRC’s balance sheet) make sales 
presentations to a corporation’s employees, they are offering to both refinance 
employees loans in addition to administering the employer contributions.  From 
these refinance lenders’ underwriting standpoint, the employee refinancing a loan 
may also be a lower risk borrower given the average $1,200 per year in employer 
contributions being made to pay down such loan.  The negative impact to SLM’s 
unit economics if SLMs loans are refinanced in the first or second year after a 
borrower graduates could be meaningful, given SLM typically incurs origination 
costs equal to 3% of the loan’s principal. 
 
 SoFi, which is the largest online student lender and has funded over $18 B in 
SLs, personal loans, and mortgages since its founding in August 2011, only 
formally launched its “SoFi at Work” program to also include SL contribution 
employee benefits in addition to refinancing benefits on September 19, 2016, so 
the marketing of contribution benefits is still in the early stages.  SoFi states in its 
press release announcing “SoFi at Work” that it has signed up more than 600 
companies, including 7 of the top 10 tech firms in the Fortune 500, 58 of the Vault 
Law Top 100 law firms, and 11 of the top 50 Banking firms.  As the purpose of the 
press release was to announce the launch of the SL contribution benefit product, 
many of those 600 existing clients likely hadn’t yet adopted contribution benefits.
15 


As part of the announcement of “SoFi at Work,” SoFi also announced that it had 
recently signed Meredith and Northrup Grumman to its platform. 
 
 CommonBond entered the SL contribution administration market through its 
July 16, 2016 acquisition of Gradible, which had been developing a payments 
administration platform for contribution benefits.  In its press release announcing 
the acquisition, CommonBond stated that it planned to launch its SL contribution 
platform by the end of 2016.  CommonBond’s offering to employers would include 
three elements: SL refinancing, SL contribution benefits, as well as SL advisory 
services (explaining income driven repayment for federal loans or making extra 
payments to high interest PSLs).  CommonBond stated it had nearly 100 corporate 
clients as of July 2016, including Mercer, Skadden Arps, Dentons, Betterment, and 
WeWork.   
 
 Earnest, which has originated over $1 B in SL refinancing loans since 
entering that market in January 2015, is poised to become an even more significant 
competitor in the SL refinancing market due to its partnership with Intuit’s 
TurboTax announced in December 2016.  Earnest currently offers both SL 
refinancing and contribution employee benefits to corporate customers.  Earnest 
appears to have adequate access funding to meet its expected increase in loan 
volumes, having issued 4 securitizations in 2016 alone for over $700 mm and 
having lined up $200 mm in lending capital from NY Life and other insurance 
companies.   
 
 In addition to the SL refinance lenders serving as administrators for SL 
contribution benefits, there are several pure-play administrators of contribution 
benefits, the most notable of which is cleverly named Tuition.io.  Tuition.io has 
already landed some very large corporate clients, such as Fidelity, Staples, HP, and 
Live Nation. MassMutual Ventures led Tuition.io’s last venture capital round of $5 
mm in November 2015.  According to the press release announcing the investment, 
MassMutual’s investment appears to serve strategic goals as well as financial ones, 
since the “crushing burden of student loan debt…can delay important choices, like 
saving for the future” and buying MassMutual’s financial and insurance products.  
We expect that other SL refinance lenders, such as CFG or Darien Rowayton Bank 
(DRB), or payroll processors such as ADP or Paychex, may express strategic 
interest in buying Tution.io, given that several other parties are said to have 
expressed interest in acquiring Gradifi before its sale to First Republic. 
 
 Other SL contribution administrators include EdAssist (owned by Bright 
Horizons, BFAM), which already administers employee tuition reimbursement 
plans for corporations and has signed up Aetna and Nvidia for SL contribution 
benefits, as well as several earlier stage startups such as Student Loan Genius, 
FutureFuel.io, Peanut Butter, and PeopleJoy.  Millennials with student debt
16 


apparently like these catchy company names.  Student Loan Genius, appears to 
have the most traction of the earlier stage SL contribution benefit startups, having 
raised $3 mm in financing in February 2016 from the venture capital arms of two 
insurance companies, Prudential and Manulife.  Shortly after the financing round, 
Student Loan Genius formed a partnership with Prudential Retirement to offer 
Student Loan Genius’ SL contribution benefits product to Prudential Retirement’s 
defined contribution (401 K) and defined benefit clients.  The partnership 
announced its first client win in November 2016 when it signed one of Prudential’s 
existing clients, a small publicly traded HVAC manufacturer called Mestek 
(MCCK). 
 
2. First Republic’s (FRC) December 2016 acquisition of Gradifi, a platform that 
enables student loan contributions as an employee benefit, should accelerate the 
trend of companies offering such benefit. Leading benefits consultants expect 
numbers of US employers offering student loan contribution benefits to increase 
meaningfully. 
 
 While SoFi, CommonBond, and Earnest have all only recently started 
marketing SL contribution benefits in 2H16, First Republic’s (FRC) December 12, 
2016 acquisition of the Gradifi is by itself a noteworthy event, given FRC’s scale 
($77 B balance sheet, $14.9 B market cap), FRC’s portfolio of business banking 
customers, and because SL refinancing has recently become one of FRC’s strategic 
priorities to build a pipeline of future customers.   
 
 Gradifi was founded in 2014 and announced its Student Loan Paydown 
(SLP) product on September 30, 2015 when it signed PWC as a client.  
Implementation of PWC’s SL contribution program only began in July 2016, so 
2017 will be the first full year that PWC employees will be on Gradifi’s platform.  
8,200 PWC employees were said to have signed up for the benefit as of December 
2016.  Gradifi’s other major corporate customers include Natixis Global Asset 
Management and Penguin Random House.   
 
 FRC was initially a Gradifi customer, having announced it was offering SL 
contribution benefits on November 3, 2016, whereby employees will receive 
$100/month during their first year of employment, $150/month during the 2nd year, 
and $200/month in their 3rd year and thereafter until the SL is repaid.  The SL 
contribution benefit is also available to part-time employees that work at least 20 
hours per week and to FRC employees that have taken out educational loans on 
behalf of their children.  Recall that ~89% of SLM’s PSL are co-signed, typically 
by a parent, and that SLM launched a Parent Loan product in 2016.   
 
 According to FRC’s CAO and Chief People Officer, Mollie Richardson, on 
FRC’s 4Q16 conference call, 300 FRC employees signed up for the SL
17 


contribution benefit on the first day it was offered.  FRC was so impressed by the 
“overwhelmingly positive experience” that its own employees had with Gradifi 
that it decided to acquire Gradifi, with the deal announced 6 weeks after FRC 
originally announced it was a Gradifi customer.  600 of FRC’s own employees 
were said to be using the Gradifi service as of FRC’s 1Q17 conference call.  Other 
suitors likewise apparently recognized that SL contributions benefits are on the 
verge of dramatic growth, as Gradifi’s CEO reported in an interview in Banking 
New England that two other companies besides FRC approached Gradifi about an 
acquisition.  
 


FRC ramped up its SL refinancing portfolio meaningfully last year, 
refinancing $728 mm of loans in 2016 to bring the total on its balance sheet to 
$834 mm at 12/31/16, up from $174 mm at 12/31/15.   FRC views its entry into SL 
refinancing as a strategic move, allowing it to build relationships with its “next 
generation of clients” to which it can sell mortgage and wealth management 
products.  FRC has said that in 2016 more than half of FRC’s total growth in 
lending relationships came through its SL refinancing product.  The acquisition of 
Gradifi bolsters FRC’s role in identifying employed, credit worthy SL refinancing 
candidates and helps FRC participate in the “once in a generation opportunity to 
address the student debt challenge” according to FRC’s COO, Jason Bender, on 
FRC’s 1Q17 conference call on April 13, 2017. 
 


FRC management spoke positively about Gradifi’s progress on FRC’s 1Q17 
call, noting “Gradifi continues to add new employers and their employees each 
week.”  FRC is already receiving positive feedback from its business banking 
clients, with FRC’s CEO, James Herbert, commenting that he is “delighted in 
terms of our relationships with businesses that might use our service.”  While 
SLM’s prepayments will increase and its unit economics will worsen dramatically 
as more of SLM’s borrowers receive SL contribution benefits from their 
employers, as we noted in the first discussion point of this report, the even more 
negative impact to SLM is when the administrators of SL contribution benefits, 
such as Gradifi, simultaneously offer to refinance SLs.  On the potential for 
synergy between Gradifi and FRC’s SL refinancing business, FRC’s CEO stated 
that “the thing I think is possibly underappreciated, it [Gradifi] is clearly a 
potentially major feeder for our all-in-one student loan refinance business and we 
have not even tried to do that yet.”   


 
FRC’s growth plans for Gradifi over the near term are significant. Gradifi’s 


CEO has stated that under FRC’s ownership, management plans to increase 
Gradifi’s 27 person workforce by 30% to 40% over the next 18 months and will 
expand from Gradifi’s Boston HQ by opening offices in many of FRC’s markets, 
such as NY, SF, Palo Alto, and LA.  We have already found evidence that FRC is 
devoting internal resources to growing Gradifi after only acquiring it four months
18 


ago.  Based on LinkedIn profiles, it appears that FRC has moved three of its own 
salespeople in Boston over to sales roles at Gradifi in February and March of 2017.   
An additional FRC salesperson in LA was moved into a sales role at Gradifi in 
April 2017.  FRC also moved two of its finance/operations employees at its SF HQ 
over to Gradifi in March and April of 2017.  Additionally, we have seen Gradifi 
posting jobs online for salespeople starting in February 2017, so all evidence 
suggests that FRC is gearing up to grow Gradifi’s SL contribution benefits 
platform. 


 
FRC’s relationships in the banking industry overall also appear to be 


benefitting Gradifi.  On February 1, 2017, the American Bankers Association 
(ABA) endorsed Gradifi, noting that the ABA’s own due diligence found that 
Gradifi has a “secure and seamless onboarding process” for employers to join its 
Gradifi’s SL payment platform. An editorial in the ABA Banking Journal on May 
1, 2017 encouraged ABA member banks to not only consider offering SL 
contribution benefits to their own employees but to also encourage their business 
banking clients to offer such benefits to their employees.  The 20% discount on 
participant fees and the waived implementation and annual fees that Gradify 
currently offers ABA member banks would also be offered to any business 
banking clients referred by ABA member banks.  Banks, as well as insurance 
companies and asset managers, are legitimately concerned that if consumers are 
too burdened with student debt, consumers will not have the resources to 
eventually purchase mortgage, investment, or insurance products.     


 
 As the penetration of SL contribution benefits by US employers is still 
currently very low, the negative impact on SLM should accelerate in the coming 
years.  The percentage of US employers that have SL contribution programs was 
estimated to be 4% by a Willis Towers Watson (WTW) survey in November 2015 
of 317 employers representing 9.2 mm employees. WTW later estimated in May 
2016 that the SL contribution penetration rate would reach 20% of employers by 
the end of 2018.  Likewise, a survey by Fidelity of employer-sponsored health and 
wellness programs found that only 13% of the 129 companies that participated in 
the survey offered SL contribution benefits in 2016, but that 21% said they were 
considering offering such benefits in 2017.  Legislation (H.R. 795) was introduced 
on February 1, 2017 that would make up to $5,250 in annual SL contribution 
benefits tax-free for employees.  Benefit consultants expect that adoption of SL 
contribution programs by employers will accelerate even more meaningfully if the 
tax-free treatment of SL contribution benefits is passed.   
	
  
3. Intuit announced a partnership with Earnest (December 2016) to use verified 
income data from TurboTax to streamline student loan refinancing. Out of 
TurboTax’s 28 mm users, over 5 mm are said to have student loans.
19 


At its September 21, 2016 Investor Day, INTU highlighted a new strategy 
that would turn its TurboTax product into a “platform” where verified income data 
(often through electronically linked W-2s) and financial data (interest paid for 
mortgages and SLs) can be used to offer TurboTax users refinancing loan products.  
INTU noted that it has 1 mm to 2 mm users per month logon to TurboTax outside 
of tax season in order to access their tax returns to apply for mortgages, SL 
refinancing, or apartment rentals.   
 


On December 13, 2016, INTU formally announced a partnership with 
Earnest where a TurboTax user’s data (with the user’s permission) can be shared 
with Earnest to see if such users are eligible for SL refinancing.  Given that SL 
interest is tax deductible for single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross 
income of $80 K or less ($160 K for married couples filing jointly), TurboTax 
users already input their SL interest paid as part of the standard tax filing process.  
Based on the SL interest logged by users into TurboTax, INTU estimates that more 
than 5 mm of TurboTax’s total 28 mm users currently have student loans.   
 
 INTU studied the SL refinancing opportunity carefully prior to announcing 
the Earnest partnership.  At an investor conference on November 30, 2016, INTU’s 
General Manager of the Consumer Tax Group, Dan Wernikoff, elaborated on 
INTU’s analytical approach to SL refinancing: 
 


In TurboTax, there’s about $2 trillion of verified income with W-2s 
associated with it.  There’s about $60 B of interest expense stored within it.  
There’s about $5 B of student loan interest stored.  And we can actually 
interpolate the exact rate people are paying.  Anonymously, we can find a 
solution provider that can offer a better rate.  We can propose that they 
potentially refinance with their consent.  [Emphasis added by OWS] 


 
 The ability to interpolate the current interest rate a borrower is paying on a 
loan is an incredibly powerful underwriting data point to a lender looking to 
successfully refinance that borrower’s loan.  Knowing the borrower’s current 
interest rate should not only enable Earnest to increase its success rate for its 
refinancing offers, but should also allow INTU to better target its marketing to 
TurboTax users whose current income and SL interest rate levels suggest a 
refinancing may be possible in the first place.    
 
 Earnest has been an innovator in using data analytics in its underwriting 
process and in offering borrowers customizable loan terms across the maturity 
curve, such as hypothetically offering 6.1 year loan at a 4.1% interest rate as well 
as a standard 10 year loan at 5.2% interest rate.  Earnest has utilized “read only” 
access to loan applicants’ linked bank accounts, credit cards, and retirement 
accounts in order to find data points that suggest responsible or irresponsible
20 


borrower behavior that may not be reflected solely in a credit score.  For instance, 
a borrower with a relatively low income, such as a librarian, but who has never 
paid late fees or overdraft fees and who regularly contributes to a 401 K or a 
savings account, may be a better credit risk than a higher income borrower who 
spends his/her salary quickly and frequently pays overdraft fees.  By using such 
data analytics, Earnest does not require a minimum credit score for borrowers and 
is able to expand its pool of eligible borrowers.  Once Earnest is armed with the 
time series of verified income data and interpolated SL interest rates from the 
TurboTax platform, Earnest’s innovative underwriting approach potentially could 
refinance a large number of SLs for TurboTax users. 
 
 INTU will receive a referral fee from Earnest for successfully refinanced 
loans and has described this partnership as part of its strategy to both increase its 
roughly $50 average revenue per user (ARPU) and to offer TurboTax users 
beneficial financial products.  While the referral fees Earnest will pay to TurboTax 
have not been disclosed, several of Earnest’s competitors (SoFi and 
CommonBond) currently have referral programs for their existing borrowers that 
pay $100 to $200 per referral.  As such referral fee levels are material relative to 
INTU’s ~$50 ARPU, INTU should be highly incentivized to devote marketing 
resources to the Earnest partnership.   
 


From a TurboTax user’s standpoint, the amount of time and effort that needs 
to be spent to fill out an SL refinancing application will also be greatly reduced, 
given much of the required data is already stored in TurboTax.  Likewise, 
Earnest’s hard underwriting costs (other than the referral fee it pays INTU) should 
be reduced, since TurboTax users are incentivized to enter their income data 
correctly and on time in order to receive refunds and avoid IRS penalties, thereby 
potentially reducing the customer service assistance required on loan applications. 
 
 INTU has said the impact on its earnings from the Earnest partnership will 
be small in its FY17 (July), but will increase into FY18 as the partnership ramps up 
and as the two companies optimize their marketing and underwriting.  INTU has 
indicated that the ~5 mm TurboTax users currently have about $135 B in student 
debt ($27 K per user), which represents about 10% of the total $1.4 Trillion of both 
federal and private student loan debt currently owed by in-school students, 
dropouts, and graduates in the US.  TurboTax users’ average income of $71.4 K 
($2 Trillion income divided by 28 mm users) is higher than the US median 
household income of roughly $55 K, suggesting that TurboTax users may be more 
suitable SL refinancing candidates than other SL borrowers with lower income. 
 
 In Table 3 below, we model the potential impact on SLM from the 
TurboTax/Earnest SL refinancing partnership.  By INTU’s FY19 (July 2019), we 
estimate that if 12% of TurboTax users with SLs refinance (613 K of 5.1 mm users
21 


with SLs) and if 7.5% of those users refinancing have PSLs owned by SLM on 
balance sheet, then 46 K of SLM’s PSL borrowers will refinance.  At an estimated 
average PSL balance of $7 K per refinanced PSL owned by SLM (assumes some 
principal has been paid down from the $10 K average original balance) and SLM’s 
borrowers having an average of 1.25 PSLs from SLM, these 46 K in refinanced 
accounts alone will result in $402 mm in SLM’s loans being refinanced and a 
$0.03 EPS hit over a twelve-month period.  SLM had $103 mm of on-balance 
sheet loans refinanced in the 1Q17 ($412 mm annualized), so an incremental $402 
mm loans refinanced would be an annual increase of 98% and would make it very 
difficult for SLM to continue to post the balance sheet growth the “street” expects 
without noticeably lowering its underwriting standards.

 The TurboTax/Earnest SL refinancing partnership will likely create greater 
consumer awareness about SL refinancing among all TurboTax users, such as 
cosigners of SLM’s loans (~90% of all SLM PSLs) that aren’t the primary 
borrowers on the loans.  One of our colleagues, who doesn’t have any SLs
22 


outstanding, was shown the following messages while filing his taxes through 
TurboTax: 
 
Save up to $21,810* by refinancing your student loans: 1 in 4 are overpaying on 
their student loans**, are you one of them? **Average savings over life of loan for 
all clients of our partner Earnest who refinanced between 1/1/15 and 6/10/16  
 
Checking this box allows TurboTax to use your student loan, contact, income, and 
employment information, and information about our communications, so you can 
find and obtain student loan refinancing options, communicate with you about the 
options, and customize your experience. 
 
 While it is too soon to quantify, a popular personal financial advice site 
called Credit Karma (CK) began offering free tax filings in 2017 that could also 
potentially lead to increased levels of SL refinancing.  CK is offering its free tax 
filing with “no hidden fees” and “no upsells” to paid tax-filings, but CK does make 
money from referral fees paid by lenders.  CK’s core business model is to offer 
consumers free credit reports and to analyze such credit report data to see if the 
consumer is eligible for lower rates on auto loans, personal loans, SLs, or credit 
cards.  CK then earns referral fee revenue if the consumer purchases a loan or 
credit card from one of CK’s partnering lenders. CK’s SL refinancing tool on its 
website currently displays offers from Earnest, SoFi, CommonBond, Lendkey, and 
Citizens.   If CK utilizes the loan referral fee strategy with its free tax filing service 
in 2017, some qualified SL refinancing candidates may be referred to partnering 
lenders, thereby further increasing SL refinancing activity. 
 
4. SLM’s disclosure surrounding the prepayment and refinancing of private student 
loans in its portfolio has been lacking, and, more recently, disappearing. In an 
August 2016 comment letter, the SEC questioned SLM about its constant 
prepayment rate (CPR). 
 


The weighted average life (WAL) of SLM’s loans is a key metric for SLM’s 
profitability given that SLM incurs origination costs equal to 3% of principal that 
need to be recouped and since the undergraduate in-school origination business is 
not likely to be as excessively profitable (550 bp + credit adjusted NIM) in the 
future due to increasing competition from College Ave, CommonBond, and from 
Navient when the non-compete ends on 12/31/18.  The decreasing WAL of SLM’s 
PSLs has been obscured by SLM selling three securitizations with $1.8 B in PSLs 
that contained more seasoned loans off balance sheet from 2014 to 2015, leaving 
the loans on-balance made up mostly of in-school loans that haven’t fully seasoned 
(2.1 year weighted average age at 3/31/17), or reached the period when full 
principal and interest payments are due after the borrower graduates.  To be fair to 
SLM, one of the main reasons it undertook the off-balance sheet securitizations
23 


was to comply with a previous regulatory limit that capped its balance sheet 
growth to 20% per year.  But, as SLM is now retaining all originated loans in order 
to grow its balance sheet, it will no longer be able to sell off more seasoned loans 
that are prime refinancing candidates. 


 
Since its spinoff of Navient in May 2014, SLM’s management has often 


referred to its PSLs having a WAL of seven years. While SLM’s CEO, Ray 
Quinlan, has continued to reference a WAL of seven years (11/30/16 investor 
conference), starting in October 2016 SLM’s CFO, Steve McGarry, has 
contradicted the historical company line and referred to SLM’s PSL WAL as being 
“six years” (10/20/16 3Q16 conference call) or “six and a half years” (2/7/17 
investor conference).  The shortening WAL of SLM’s PSLs is consistent with the 
material increase in SLM’s Total Prepayments over the last several years, 
including those sold off-balance sheet into securitizations that are no longer 
reflected on the income statement.  Total prepayments, which are technically called 
the “Since Issued Constant Prepayment Rate (CPR)” by SLM, were for a long time 
described by SLM management as being generally in the 4% range, while actual 
prepayment data from SLM’s eight securitizations since the Navient spinoff have 
continually increased to the point that April 2017 data now shows a Since Issued 
Total CPRs average of 7.55% (range 6.85% to 8.42%).   The Since Issued Total 
CPRs disclosed by SLM are defined as Total Prepayments, which include 
Voluntary Prepayments (extra principal payments and refinancing to third party 
lenders) as well as defaults.   
 


In addition to SLM’s PSL borrowers refinancing their loans with the much 
publicized online lenders (SoFi, CommonBond, etc.) and with Citizens, SLM’s 
increase in CPRs is also due to the less publicized trend of SLM borrowers making 
extra principal payments on their loans, known as curtailments or partial 
prepayments.  Given that SLM’s average on balance sheet PSL currently yields 
8.26%, nearly twice the rate of recently issued federal SLs, it is financially logical 
that borrowers are trying to pay down their SLM PSLs as quickly as possible to 
start to build net worth.  


 
Table 4 below shows the general relationship between the CPR and the 


WAL for a 10-year PSL once it enters full principal and interest repayment.   For a 
student borrower that graduates, a PSL typically has three repayment stages.  The 
first stage, the in-school period, allows borrowers to either defer interest, to make 
interest only payments, or to make small fixed payments, such as $25 month.  The 
second stage, known as the grace period, lasts for six months after the borrower 
graduates and allows the borrower the same three payment options as when in-
school, including deferring payment.  The last stage is full principal and interest 
(P&I) repayment, which is the time period when the borrower has graduated,
24 


hopefully is employed, and potentially is looking to refinance their SLM PSL or 
make additional principal payments to pay off the loan as quickly as possible.   


 
Adding together the weighted average years of each stage, with 2 years for 


the in-school period (weighted average of loans distributed evenly during a 4 year 
undergraduate degree), 0.5 years for the grace period, and 5 years for the full P&I 
period (5 year WAL for a 10 year loan at 4% CPR) gives roughly the 7 year WAL 
that SLM management has historically referenced.   As Table 4 below shows, a 
change in SLM’s loan portfolio from a 4% CPR to a 10% CPR, reduces the WAL 
of the loans in full P&I by 0.87 years from 5 years to 4.13 years.  Borrowers that 
receive SL contribution benefits from their employer would have their WAL in full 
P&I shortened even further, with a $100/month contribution having 2.34 year 
WAL and a $200/month contribution leading to a 1.56 year WAL.

As SLM’s WAL and CPR metrics have worsened, SLM management’s 


disclosures regarding such metrics have been contradicting, lacking, and, at times, 
disappearing.  The best way to highlight SLM management’s changing disclosure 
regarding their WALs, CPRs, and credit approval rates is to quote SLM 
management directly from SLM conference calls, investor conference transcripts, 
investor presentations, SEC filings and correspondence with the SEC.   Below is 
the timeline of SLM’s disclosures on its WALs and CPRs:  


 
September 2014 Investor Presentation for Asset Backed Securities (ABS) 
investors (on SLM’s website, 
https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/webcasts/):  Slide 16 of this 
presentation shows that SLM’s first securitization post the spin-off, 2014-A, was 
priced with a 4% prepayment assumption.  
 
1Q15 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as an 8-K on 1/27/15):  
The young age of SLM’s PSL portfolio that is not yet seasoned for prepayments 
and refinancing to third parties is highlighted by several slides in this presentation.
25 


Slide 12 states that “Only 3% of our portfolio has been in full principal and interest 
payment for more than 2 years.”  Slide 14 states that the “Weighted Average Age 
of Loan: ~1.6 years.”  
 
April 2015 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as an 8-K on 
4/3/15):  Slide 14 shows Voluntary CPR by Origination Vintage for 2011, 2012, 
and 2013 Vintages.  A headline on the slide reads “Following the first year after 
disbursement, total prepayments [voluntary prepayments and defaults] have 
generally ranged around 4%.” A footnote on the slide reads that data is as of 
January 31, 2015.  [OWS emphasis added] 
   
July 2015 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as an 8-K on 
7/16/15):  There is a separate slide for Voluntary Prepayments (slide 32) that 
shows Voluntary Prepayments for the 2010 vintage loans accelerated meaningfully 
from about 4% as of March 31, 2014 (13 quarters after the loans’ disbursement) to 
about 6.5% at March 31, 2015 (17 quarters following disbursement).  The 
following slide (slide 33) shows Total Prepayments (Voluntary Prepayments & 
Defaults) with the following headline “Following the first year after disbursement, 
total prepayments generally ranged around 4%.”  Total prepayments for the 2010 
Vintage visually appear to be about 7%, as shown in the slide below: 
 


 
 
SLM 3Q15 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as an 8-K on 
8/21/15):  There is a slide on Total Prepayments (slide 28) similar to the one in the 
July 2015 Investor Presentation (slide 33), except that the 2010 Vintage loan data 
that was showing rapidly increasing prepayments in the July presentation is not 
updated to include June 30, 2015 data (17 quarters from the disbursement date for
26 


2010 Vintage is shown in in both presentations, whereas the 2011 Vintage is 
marked at 13 quarters (March 31, 2015 data) since disbursement in the July 2015 
presentation and marked at 14 quarters (June 30, 2015 data) in the 3Q15 
presentation).  All of the other Vintages, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 are updated 
with June 30, 2015 data.   Below is a screenshot of Total Prepayments from the 
presentation: 
 


 
 
 
September 2015 Investor Presentation to ABS Investors (on SLM’s website, 
https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/webcasts/):  Slide 13 shows that 
SLM’s Prepayment Speed assumptions for both the $704 mm 2015-A 
securitization and the $714 mm 2015-B securitization were 4%.   
 
October 2015 Servicer Reports to ABS Investors (on SLM’s IR website for 
ABS investors, https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/asset-backed-
securities/):  SLM restates its Since Issued CPR data in three of its securitization 
trusts (2014-A, 2015-A, and 2015-B) in a footnote in its servicer reports to ABS 
investors.  There is no mention of this CPR restatement in any of financial 
documents typically reviewed by equity investors, such as SLM’s SEC documents, 
investor presentations for equity investors filed as 8-Ks with the SEC, press 
releases or earnings conference calls.  Prior to the restatement, the Since Issued 
CPRs (Total Prepayments = Voluntary Prepayments + Defaults) in all three of 
SLM’s restated securitizations were much higher than the 4% level that SLM 
management advertises for total prepayments.  The footnote in SLM’s October 
2015 securitization servicer reports (slide 11) explaining the restatement reads:  
  
Since issued Total CPR calculations found in monthly servicer reports issued on or 
prior to September 15, 2015 included as prepayments… [$5 mm for 2014-A, $10.6
27 


mm for 2015-A, and $10.7 mm for 2015-B]…of loans that were removed from the 
pool by the sponsor [SLM] because they became ineligible for the pool between the 
cut-off date and settlement date.  On October 5, 2015, Since Issued CPR 
calculations were revised to exclude these loans and all prior monthly servicing 
reports were restated. 
 
The size of the reduction of the Since Issued CPR due to the restatement was 
sizable for each of the three affected securitizations.  The Since Issued CPRs for 
the 2014-A, 2015-A, and 2015-B securitization were restated from 6.34%, 7.23%, 
and 9.28% at 8/31/15 down to 5.44%, 5.08%, and 3.99%, respectively.  Below is a 
graph of Since Issued CPR data for SLM’s securitizations as of April 2017, 
including the restated periods prior to September 2015.  Notice how the data for 
the 3 restated securitizations (2014-A, 2015-A, and 2015-B) ends in September 
2015 and is changed to much lower levels.

4Q15 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as an 8-K on 10/30/15):  
SLM removed 2010 Vintage loan data, which had total prepayments at 7% as of 
3/31/15, entirely from its slide on Voluntary CPRs (slide 27).  A footnote claims 
the removal of the 2010 Vintage loans from the graph is due to “insufficient data.”
28 


Voluntary CPR data for the 2011 to 2014 Vintages does not appear to be updated 
with September 30, 2015 data, since 2011 Vintage data is 14 quarters from 
disbursement in both the 3Q15 presentation (using 6/30/15 data) and the 4Q15 
presentation (claims to be using 9/30/15 data).  The next slide (slide 28) on Total 
Prepayments (Voluntary Prepayments & Defaults) shows 2011 Vintage loans at 
6%, 2012 Vintage loans at over 5%, and 2013 Vintage loans at over 4% despite the 
headline on the slide still reading “Following the first year after disbursement, total 
prepayments have generally ranged around 4%.”  
 
SLM 4Q15 Conference Call on January 21, 2016:  SLM CEO, Ray Quinlan, 
states that SLM’s business is “built upon assets that have on average a seven-year 
life [OWS emphasis added].”  Mr. Quinlan goes on to state “the number [of SLM’s 
loans being refinanced] has been, and is, de minimus, from what we can see.  
When we think about market share, we think about originations, primarily, but we 
are protective of the assets that we have, we expect them to go for seven years.”  
As three of the first four securitizations SLM issued after the Navient spinoff that 
contained SLM’s more seasoned loans were sold off-balance sheet, the trend of 
higher total prepayments we have been highlighting was not yet showing up fully 
in SLM’s earnings since SLM no longer owned the equity of such securitizations. 
   
SLM 1Q16 Investor Presentation (filed as an 8-K on 1/29/16):  SLM has a slide 
titled “Analytical Approach to Credit” (Slide 10) that states it receives “~1.3 mm 
annual applications” and has a “~35% approval rate,” implying that about 455 K 
loan applications per year are approved.   This is the same approval rate disclosed 
in all of SLM’s presentations since the Navient spinoff.  There are no slides 
whatsoever discussing the Total Prepayment rate, unlike in previous presentations 
to equity investors, such as the 4Q15 Investor Presentation.  Apparently 
prepayments are no longer a talking point that SLM management wants to 
highlight when presenting to equity investors. 
 
SLM ABS Vegas Presentation to ABS Investors on February 28 to March 2, 
2016 (on SLM’s website, 
https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/webcasts/):  The typical slide 
showing Voluntary Prepayments is completely removed from the presentation. 
This is particularly unusual since ABS investors are normally more concerned with 
prepayment speeds than are equity investors.  There is now only a slide showing 
Total Prepayments (slide 18) with data as of 12/31/15.  The 2010 Vintage loan data 
that was removed from the 4Q15 Equity Investor Presentation is likewise not 
contained in this presentation.  Total Prepayments look to be down slightly from 
6% at 9/30/15 for the 2011 Vintage loans, but increased sequentially for both the 
2012 Vintage loans (approaching 6%) and the 2013 Vintage loans (approaching 
5%).  SLM also removed completely the headline that was typically in past 
presentations that read  “Following the first year after disbursement, total
29 


prepayments have generally ranged around 4%.”  There is a slide (slide 22) 
showing that the third securitization that it completed in 2015, the $701 mm 2015-
C securitization, was modeled by SLM with a 4% pricing prepayment speed, 
similar to the first two securitizations that SLM did in 2015. 
 
SLM 2Q16 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as 8-K on 
4/27/16): SLM has the same slide titled “Analytical Approach to Credit” (Slide 10) 
that was in its 1Q16 Investor presentation, but now states SLM receives “~1.3 mm 
annual applications” and has a “~40% approval rate” up from the 35% approval 
rate disclosed in the 1Q16 presentation and every investor presentation since the 
2014 spin-off. This 40% loan approval rate suggests that SLM is approving 520 K 
loan applications per year, up from the 455 K implied by the previously disclosed 
35% approval rate.  As we outlined in the Background section of this report, 
SLM’s borrower FICO scores and co-signer rates declined marginally in 2016 to 
748 and 89% from 749 and 90% in 2015, which is consistent with SLM increasing 
its loan application approval rate. 
 
SLM Smart Option SL Historical Performance Data Period ended 3/31/16 (on 
SLM’s website on 5/11/16, 
https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/webcasts/): 
This presentation contains historical performance data related to SLM PSL’s loan 
defaults and prepayments, including the prepayment data slides that SLM had 
removed from its 1Q16 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors.  As of April 
2017, SLM has not included any prepayment data in any general Investor 
Presentations for Equity Investors since the 4Q15.  As can be seen in the slide on 
total prepayments below (slide 12), 2011 vintage loans have total prepayments 
running at 6% and 2012 and 2013 loan vintages are trending at noticeably higher 
CPRs than the 2011 loan vintage.  The 2010 Vintage loan data that had 7% CPRs 
as of 3/31/15 is still not shown.  The headline the on this slide that previously said 
total prepayments were generally around 4% now has been changed to read 
“following the first year after disbursement, total prepayments have generally 
ranged round 5%-6%.”
30 


 
 
SLM 3Q16 Investor Presentation for Equity Investors (filed as 8-K on 8/2/16):  
SLM presents a slide titled “Sallie Mae Bank ABS Structures” (slide 20) that 
discloses that while its third securitization in 2015, the 2015-C deal priced on 
10/19/15, was priced with a 4% prepayment speed assumption, its first 
securitization deal in 2016, the 2016-A priced on 5/18/16, was priced with a 6% 
prepayment speed assumption. 
 
SEC Comment Letter to SLM dated 8/26/16:  The SEC sent SLM a comment 
letter regarding SLM’s Non-GAAP efficiency ratio, SLM’s changing interest rate 
sensitivity disclosure, and SLM’s assumptions regarding its prepayment speeds.  
Specifically, as it relates to prepayment speeds, the SEC clearly asked SLM:  “Tell 
us the level at which you estimate the prepayment assumptions for your loans.”   
 
SLM’s Response on 9/9/16 to the 8/26/16 SEC Comment letter:  SLM does not 
answer the SEC’s question regarding the prepayment assumptions for SLM’s loans 
with any actual, hard data on SLM’s CPR or the assumptions underlying the CPR.  
Instead of providing hard data, SLM tells the SEC that the “Company considers the 
CPR a significant accounting assumption and on a quarterly basis the Company’s 
critical accounting assumption working group reviews all critical and significant 
accounting assumptions, including the CPR estimates.  All significant assumptions 
reviewed by the working group are updated, as needed, at least annually.”   
 
SLM 3Q16 Conference Call on 10/20/16:  SLM’s CFO, Steve McGarry, refers to 
SLM’s PSLs during the unscripted Q&A segment of the call as “an asset that has 
an average life out of the chute of six years.”  This potential Freudian slip by Mr. 
McGarry, mentioning that PSLs now have a six-year average life, contradicts the 
claims of a seven-year average life touted by SLM’s CEO at a “street” investor 
conference the following month.
31 


SLM Smart Option SL Historical Performance Data Period ended 9/30/16 (on 
SLM’s website on 11/8/16, 
https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/webcasts/): 
SLM contains a slide on Voluntary Prepayments (slide 11) with the headline 
“Voluntary prepay speeds trending up as more loans enter P&I [Principal & 
Interest] repayment.”  The slide on Total Prepayments (slide 12), shown below, 
indicates that the 2011 vintage has had total prepayments running above 8% for the 
last two quarters and that the 2012, 2013, and 2014 loan vintages all have CPRs 
materially higher than the 2011 loan vintage.  SLM has removed headline from this 
slide that previously stated “following the first year after disbursement, total 
prepayments have generally ranged round 5%-6%” and has replaced it with the 
headline “following the initial few years after disbursement, total prepayments 
begin to rise more quickly as loans begin to default.”  Notice that the CPR for the 
2011 loan vintage for the 17th quarter following disbursement is clearly noticeably 
above 6% in the chart below from the 3Q16 data presentation whereas the 17th 
quarter for the 2011 loan vintage data for the 17th quarter is at 6% in the chart from 
SLM 1Q16 loan data presentation that we presented on page 30 of this report.     
 


 
 
 
SLM’s 2nd Response to the 8/26/16 SEC Comment letter dated 11/22/16:  After 
2.5 months had gone by since SLM filed its first response to the SEC’s comment 
letter, SLM starts the letter by saying “Thank you for your consideration regarding 
our comment letter response, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on September 9, 2016,” indicating that there were behind the scenes 
conversations between SLM and the SEC.   While there was a non-material, $141 
K upward adjustment to loan interest income related to estimates of education loan 
defaults, the major information disclosed was related to the SEC’s previous 
questions regarding SLM’s CPR.  SLM stated that its CPR estimates are based
32 


partly on the “prepayment curve’s tendency to follow a ramp pattern (i.e., the 
prepayment rate typically increases during the in-school and early repayment 
periods, then stabilizes.)”  SLM released that its CPR estimates for FY16 are 
5.00%, compared with a CPR of 5.12% for FY15.   Recall from the chart on page 
27 above that as of November 2016 when this response was made, the six 
securitizations issued by SLM post Navient spinoff had an average Since Issued 
CPR of 6.32% (range of 5.6% to 7.16%).  In other words, every single 
securitization had a CPR higher than SLM’s 5% estimate.  Three of these six 
securitizations also had their CPR restated lower by SLM since ineligible (prepaid) 
loans were removed from the deals.  The only reason that SLM could employ to 
justify using a 5% CPR estimate is that the majority of the on-balance sheet PSL 
portfolio was unseasoned (1.7 year average loan age 12/31/15) and not yet primed 
for prepayments or refinancing because the majority of the borrowers were still in 
school.   
 
SLM at a “street” Investor Conference on 11/30/16:  SLM’s CEO, Ray Quinlan, 
while discussing SLM’s PSLs boasted about “the long life of those vintages, seven 
years” and goes on to say “and when we look at the projections for our balance 
sheet and our income statement, out five, six, seven years, those non-sales, which 
have a life on them of seven years once they’re in principal and interest and before 
that while they’re in college greatly amplifies our EPS and their trajectory 
associated with that.” 
 
SLM at a “street” Investor Conference on 12/6/16:  In response to a question 
about refinancing competition, SLM’s CFO responded that SLM doesn’t “see the 
consolidators targeting our portfolio, but what does happen is some of our loans 
get swept up in the net as they’re targeting federal consolidation loans.  It is a very 
small percentage of our book.  It’s something that we monitor carefully, but at this 
point in time it’s not really having an impact on our profitability.”  Remember Mr. 
McGarry’s statements here relative to what he says next month on SLM’s 4Q16 
conference call. 
 
SLM 4Q16 Conference Call on 1/19/17:  SLM’s CFO, Steve McGarry, discussed 
loans refinanced by third parties by saying “Ending loans in full P&I [Principal & 
Interest] totaled $5.1 B, and this includes the $1.6 B of loans that entered full P&I 
in the quarter.  And associated with this increase in loans going into full P&I, some 
analysts have noted, as did we, that – we saw a pop of loans being consolidated to 
third parties.  This is something that we obviously watch very closely here at the 
Company and we are certainly not alarmed in the pattern [OWS emphasis added].” 
 
SLM 1Q17 Conference Call on 4/20/17:  While SLM said on its 4Q16 
conference call on 1/19/17 that it was “not alarmed in the pattern” of its loans 
being refinanced by third parties, three months later SLM’s CFO, Steve McGarry,
33 


said on the 1Q17 conference call that SLM is “carefully assessing the types of 
loans that we’re seeing consolidated away based on pricing, school type, et cetera, 
to see if there are some preemptive actions that we can take on that front.”  Mr. 
McGarry cautioned investors that in order “to prevent those loans from going away 
[being refinanced by third parties], we would have to take some pretty radical steps 
in pricing.”  We likewise caution investors that if SLM is going to start 
cannibalizing its loan interest income by offering existing borrowers lower interest 
rates, SLM better hope it doesn’t encourage even more borrowers to refinance by 
putting the idea in their heads.  
 
SLM Smart Option SL Historical Performance Data Period ended 3/31/17 (on 
SLM’s website on 4/25/17, 
https://www.salliemae.com/about/investors/webcasts/):  SLM quarterly loan 
performance presentation contains a slide labeled Total Prepayments (slide 12) 
shown below.  Notice how the 2011 vintage total prepayments have surpassed 9% 
and the later vintages (2012 – 2015) continue to have total prepayments trending 
much higher than the 2011 vintage.  Recall from Table 4 on page 24 that we 
showed that a 10% CPR shaves 0.87 years off the weighted average life (WAL) of 
a 10 year loan versus a 4% CPR, while a 12% CPR cuts the WAL by 1.1 years 
relative to a 4% CPR.   Similar to how SLM removed all slides on prepayments in 
its general presentations geared to equity investors, we expect SLM management’s 
commentary on conference calls regarding its WAL will likewise disappear. 
 
 


 
 
 
Recent Results:  
  
 SLM reported 1Q17 revenue (net interest income and non-interest income) 
of $274 mm that beat consensus of $265.7.  The revenue beat was mostly due to
34 


SLM’s assets re-pricing more quickly than its liabilities following the December 
2016 Fed rate hike, causing SLM’s net interest margin (NIM) to come in at 5.96% 
vs. 5.77% in the prior year.  SLM management cautioned that while it doesn’t 
expect the full year 2017 NIM to stay at the 1Q17 level, it does anticipate that it 
could come in a few basis points better than the 5.68% reported in 2016.   SLM’s 
reported adjusted EPS of $0.21 beat consensus of $0.15 by $0.06, but after backing 
out non-recurring items related to allowance for loan loss adjustments ($0.02) and 
a lower tax rate ($0.01), the clean beat was about $0.03.    
 
 SLM’s 1Q17 PSL originations (and loan acquisitions) of $1.848 B were up 
2.3% Y/Y, which is below the 4.6% full year growth rate implied by SLM 
management’s 2017 origination guidance of $4.9 B.  SLM management attributed 
the lower growth in PSL originations to its reduction in lending to for-profit 
schools, which saw originations down Y/Y as SLM deemphasizes these schools.  
For-profit schools represented 9% ($419 mm) of SLM’s total originations in 2016 
and 10% ($430 mm) in 2015.  As SLM’s originations are seasonally strong in the 
1Q (38% to 39% of full year originations in FY15 and FY16), in order for SLM to 
meet its 4.6% origination FY17 growth target there would need to be 6% 
origination growth in the remaining three quarters in FY17.   Consistent with how 
SLM slightly lowered its average FICO and co-signer rates in 2016, we expect that 
SLM may lower its underwriting standards for the remainder of 2017 in order to 
meet its origination target. 
 
 Credit quality during the quarter, which is a reflection on underwriting 
standards several years ago, came in better than expected even when backing out 
several one-time items.   SLM’s allowance for loan losses (ALL) is designed to 
cover all charge offs during the next year plus life-of-loan losses on Troubled Debt 
Restructuring (TDRs).   When looking at credit metrics on SLM’s PSL portfolio 
and excluding FFELP loans (97% credit guarantee by US Government) and a tiny 
personal loan portfolio ($56 mm), SLM’s $15.6 B PSL portfolio ended the 1Q17 
with ALL at 3.61% of PSLs in full principal and interest payment ($5.1 B), versus 
3.59% in the 4Q16 and 3.64% in the 1Q16.   
 


SLM’s provision for loan losses (PLL) for the PSL portfolio declined 
substantially in the 1Q17 to $26.8 mm (0.52% full P&I PSLs) from $42.8 mm 
(0.84% full P&I) in 4Q16 and $33.8 mm (1.01% full P&I) in 1Q16 due to two 
revisions SLM made to its modeling assumptions for its TDR loans that together 
lowered its PLL by $12 mm in 1Q17.  The first modeling assumption change, 
which lowered SLM’s PLL by $8 mm, should be non-recurring, as SLM pushed 
back the timing of defaults in its TDR loans and lowered the amount it estimated 
for incremental defaults resulting from shortening the charge-off period for loans 
to 120 days from 210 days at the time of the Navient spinoff.   The second item 
that lowered SLM’s PLL by $4 mm was related to the March 2017 Fed rate
35 


increase and the resulting increase in 1-month Libor that has led to higher expected 
interest income from loans in SLM’s TDR portfolio that continue to pay interest 
and don’t default.  Net Charge Offs (NCOs) plus loan sales as a percentage of full 
P&I PSLs came in at 0.47% in 1Q17 up slightly from 0.45% in the 4Q16, but 
down substantially from 0.60% on the 1Q16.   


 
 Total expenses in 1Q17 were up 10.4% Y/Y, below the 18.9% growth in 
revenue (net interest income and non-interest income), demonstrating that SLM 
has some operating leverage as it grows its balance sheet.   SLM’s non-GAAP 
operating efficiency ratio came in at 36.8% for 1Q17 vs. 40.2% for 1Q16.  SLM 
management has guided a full year 2017 non-GAAP efficiency ratio of 38% to 
39%.  The “street” bulls on SLM are excited by this operating leverage, but SLM’s 
servicing costs, which are a function of the age of its PSL portfolio, have not yet 
fully seasoned, given that only 33% of SLM’s PSLs are in full P&I repayment as 
of 3/31/17.  As loans enter full P&I, SLM’s servicing costs typically increase, as 
the company has to send out monthly statements and its call centers have to field 
more calls from borrowers.  SLM management commented on the 4Q16 
conference call that if it hypothetically cost $1 to service an account before it 
enters full P&I, it costs $8 to service an account, on average, once its in full P&I 
repayment, and it costs “many, many multiples of that $8” to service a loan that is 
delinquent.  
  


A change in the GAAP tax treatment of stock compensation expense 
reduced the amount of taxes SLM paid in 1Q17 by $6 mm, resulting in a 35% tax 
rate versus the 37.1% tax rate in 1Q16 and the full year 2016 tax rate of 39.6%.   
 
Financial Assumptions: 
 


SLM’s Private Education Loan Y/Y origination growth projected to be 6.1% in 
2Q17, 3Q17, and 4Q17, resulting in total FY17 originations of $4.9 B, which is 
4.63% Y/Y growth for FY17, in line with SLM management guidance.  FY18 
Private Education Loan origination growth is 5%, resulting in total FY18 
originations of $5.146 B.  


 
Private Education Loans - Loan consolidations to third parties is a line item 


disclosed in SLM’s 10-K (2016 10-K, p 56) in a table titled Education Loan 
Activity.  It represents third party loan refinancings that are separate from 
contractual repayments and voluntary prepayments by borrowers for the on-
balance sheet portfolio.  Loan consolidations to third parties are modeled to be 
$150 mm, $175 mm, and $200 mm in 2Q17, 3Q17, and 4Q17, for a FY17 total of 
$628.7 mm.  For FY18, loan consolidations to third parties are modeled to be $225 
mm, $275 mm, $285 mm, and $300 mm in 1Q18, 2Q18, 3Q18, and 4Q18, for a 
full year FY18 total of $1.085 B.
36 


 
Private Education Loans - Repayments & Other is a line item disclosed in 


SLM’s 10-K (2016 10-K, p 56) in a table titled Education Loan Activity.  
Repayments & other is modeled to be $475 mm, $500 mm, and $525 mm in 2Q17, 
3Q17, and 4Q17, for a FY17 total of $1.910 B.  For FY18, repayments & other are 
modeled to $575 mm, $590 mm, $610 mm, and $625 mm in 1Q18, 2Q18, 3Q18, 
and 4Q18, for a full year FY18 total of $2.4 B. 


 
The FFELP loan portfolio continues to amortize and there are no acquisitions of 


FFELP loans.  The period end FFELP loan balances for 2Q17, 3Q17, 4Q17, 1Q18, 
2Q18, 3Q18 and 4Q18 are $968 mm, $946 mm, $925 mm, $905 mm, $884 mm, $ 
864 mm, and $843 mm. 


 
The personal loan portfolio is modeled to be $100 mm at the end of 2Q17 and 


then increase by $50 mm per quarter through the end of 2018. 
 
The yields on the Private Education Loan portfolio for 2Q17, 3Q17, and the 


4Q17 are estimated to be 8.10%, 8.05%, and 8.08%, while the yield is modeled to 
be 8.30% throughout 2018.  The yield on the FFELP loan portfolio, taxable 
securities, and personal loans are modeled to stay constant from 2Q17 to the 4Q18 
at 3.69%, 2.50%, and 9.05%, respectively.  The yield on cash and other short-term 
investments is modeled at 0.80%, 0.85%, 0.90% in the 2Q17, 3Q17, and 4Q17, 
respectively, and is estimated to stay at 0.90% throughout 2018. 


 
The interest rates paid on Brokered Deposits go up 5 bp per quarter from 1.55% 


in the 2Q17 to 1.65% in the 4Q17 and then stay at 1.65% throughout 2018.  The 
interest rates paid on Retail & Other deposits also increase by 5 bp per quarter 
from 1.31% in the 2Q17 to 1.41% in the 4Q117 and then stay at 1.41% throughout 
2018.  The interest rate paid on Other interest-bearing liabilities, which is 
predominantly SLM’s on-balance sheet securitization financing, increases by 5 bp 
per quarter from 2.71% in the 2Q17 to 2.81% in 4Q17 and then stays at 2.81% 
throughout 2018.  SLM issued $200 mm of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022 on 
April 5, 2017, which are included in SLM’s interest expense and net interest 
income starting in the 2Q17.  The proceeds from these Senior Notes were partly 
used to redeem SLM’s 6.97% Preferred stock, as described below. 


 
SLM’s Net Interest Margin (NIM) is modeled at 5.90%, 5.80%, and 5.44% in 


2Q17, 3Q17, and 4Q17.  The 4Q NIM is seasonally lower due to SLM’s need to 
build cash balances in the 4Q ahead of its seasonally strong loan disbursements in 
January for spring semesters.  SLM’s NIM for 2018 is estimated to be 5.86%, 
5.94%, 5.72%, and 5.63% for the 1Q18, 2Q18, 3Q18, and 4Q18.
37 


Provision for Loan Losses (PLL) are $42.9 mm, $42 mm, and $41 mm for 
2Q17, 3Q17, 4Q17, and $151.2 mm for full year FY17.  For FY18, Provision for 
Loan Losses are $46 mm, $45 mm, $43 mm, and $43 mm in the 1Q18, 2Q18, 
3Q18, and 4Q18, for full year FY18 of $177 mm.  In addition to taking PLL for 
SLM’s private education loans and FFELP loan portfolio, our PLL estimates for 
SLM also include a PLL for the growing personal loan portfolio equal to 2% of 
personal loan originations. 


 
There are no gains on sales of loans modeled since SLM’s strategy since early 


2016 has been to retain all loans on balance sheet, although it still uses 
securitizations as a form of term financing but it retains the equity tranches in such 
deals. 


 
Other Income, which is primarily Upromise, is modeled to be $14.5 mm, $14 


mm, and $14 mm for 2Q17, 3Q17, and 4Q17, for a full year FY17 of $53.8 mm.   
For FY18, Other Income is modeled to be $12 mm, $15 mm, $14.8 mm, and $14.8 
mm for 1Q18, 2Q18, 3Q18, and 4Q18, for full year FY18 of $56.6mm. 


 
 Total operating expense is modeled to be $107.4 mm, $112.1 mm, and $113.3 


mm for 2Q17, 3Q17, and 4Q17, for a full year FY17 total of $435.5 mm. For 
FY18, total operating expenses are modeled to be $118.6 mm, $120 mm, $125.1 
mm, and $124.2 mm for 1Q18, 2Q18, 3Q18, and 4Q18, for a full year FY18 total 
of $487.9mm. 


 
Acquired intangible asset amortization expense is modeled to run at $0.115 mm 


per quarter from the 2Q17 to the 4Q18 
 
The tax rate is assumed to be 39% in the 2Q17 to the 4Q17, in line with SLM 


management guidance.  SLM’s tax rate in 2018 is modeled to be 37% in 1Q18 and 
39% from 2Q18 to 4Q18. 


 
SLM redeemed its 6.97% Preferred stock on 4/24/17 so there is $0.7 mm of 


dividends from such securities included in the 2Q17.  There is still $400 mm of 
preferred stock outstanding with dividends based on 3 month Libor plus 170 bp.  
Preferred stock dividends are modeled at $3.6 mm in the 2Q17 and $3 mm per 
quarter from the 3Q17 to the 4Q18. 


 
The diluted share count is modeled to increase by 1 mm shares per quarter from 


439.7 mm shares in the 2Q17 to 445.7 mm shares in the 4Q18.

Risks: 
 
 If the US corporate tax rate were lowered to the 15% to 20% range being 
discussed, SLM would benefit since it currently has a 39% tax rate.  Several 
factors could reduce the overall benefit SLM receives from tax reform if other 
elements of the tax code are changed. First, if personal income tax rates are 
reduced, SLM’s borrowers may use their incremental tax savings to accelerate 
prepayment of their PSLs that have interest rates significantly higher than federal 
SLs.  Second, legislation (H.R. 795) has been introduced in early 2017 that would 
make up to $5,250 in annual employer paid SL contributions tax-free to the 
employee.  Such tax-related legislation may logically be included in overall tax 
reform.  Adoption by employers of SL contribution benefits is expected to 
accelerate if legislation makes the benefits tax-free to employees. 
 
 If Graduate student PLUS or Parent PLUS loans are privatized, it could be 
an opportunity to for SLM to grow its balance sheet and earnings.  The rationale 
for privatizing PLUS loans is that, given there is very little underwriting for such 
loans by the US government, there would be sizable credit losses due to both 
outright defaults and from borrowers entering income driven repayment plans 
where principal is forgiven after 10 years (if the borrower worked in a public 
service job) to 25 years (if the borrower has paid 20% of his/her discretionary 
income during the repayment period).  Any privatization of either of the two PLUS 
programs would result in substantial number of less credit worthy borrowers 
(students) not receiving financing from the private sector, and thus is likely to face 
opposition from advocates for expanded education access.  SLM management has 
stated that student loan reform appears to be behind tax and healthcare reform on 
the Trump administration’s list of priorities.   
 


In an absolute best-case scenario, if Graduate PLUS loans are privatized in 
time for the Fall 2018 / Spring 2019 academic year, it might add a few pennies to 
SLM’s EPS in FY18 and 5 to 10 cents in 2019.  We expect that loans to credit 
worthy graduate school borrowers would be at lower margins than SLM currently 
makes on undergraduate PSLs, given the increasing competition from online 
lenders (SoFi and CommonBond) as well as from Navient, which has indicated it 
plans to originate PSLs once its non-compete with SLM ends on 12/31/18.  
Additionally, SLM has noted that it would likely need to raise equity capital in 
order to take advantage of any meaningful amount of Graduate PLUS originations. 
 


Private student loan demand is tied to the availability of other financing 
alternatives, such as more advantageously priced federal student loans.  If federal 
student loan limits were to decline or grow slower than college tuition costs, there 
could be increased demand for PSLs.  Similarly if college tuition costs were to
39 


grow faster than federal loan limits, scholarships, grants, and work-study limits, the 
residual funding needs could result in increased demand for PSLs. 
 


If banking regulation is revised to allow SLM to operate with less equity 
capital, SLM could return capital to shareholders.  SLM currently has 12.3% Tier 1 
Capital to Risk Weighted Assets vs. the 8.0% required to be “Well Capitalized.”  
SLM would likely return capital through a dividend, unless SLM wanted to buy its 
stock back at its current 2.9x tangible book valuation (tangible book value to 
common is $4.26 at 3/31/17).  Currently, SLM only buys back a small amount of 
stock to offset employee stock dilution.  If Graduate student PLUS loans are 
privatized, SLM would likely have to retain capital for such loan growth. 
 


Wells Fargo, which is the #2 competitor in PSLs with a 25% market share, 
has suffered negative publicity over creating accounts for customers without their 
permission.  If such negative publicity continues for WFC, this could lead to 
market share gains for SLM.  While WFC reported PSL originations were down 
4% Y/Y in 1Q17, SLM’s origination growth of 2.3% Y/Y in 1Q17 was below its 
full year 4.6% target due to a reduction in lending to for-profit schools.  College 
Ave, a SL lender founded by a former SLM executive in 2014, recently hired a 
sales person in California to focus on in-school PSLs at west coast universities, 
indicating that other competitors besides SLM may be going after WFC’s sales as 
well.
