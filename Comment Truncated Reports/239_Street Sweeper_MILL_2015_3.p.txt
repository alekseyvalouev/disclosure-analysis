Miller Energy: Alaska Debates Vital Tax Credit Handouts

Summary


Miller Energy Resources has been struggling recently from panic selling prompted
by a chairman’s margin call, enormous debt, huge earnings/revenue misses and low
oil prices. More trouble looms ahead.


Miller’s oil and gas exploration focuses on Alaska, where millions of dollars from tax
credits provide a major portion of the company’s operating budget. Those tax credits
appear at risk.


Alaska’s governor penned a fiery opinion piece questioning the wisdom of paying
millions in tax credits when production taxes to the state fall far short of tax credits
handed out.


Miller could find its tax credit money cut short by legislation. A legislative report
examines the issue. And, now a House Finance Committee co-chairman is taking a
closer look.

THESTREETSWEEPER QUICK HIT - Terrible, cash-eating news from Alaska threatens to
drive another stake into Miller Energy Resources (NYSE:MILL). The bleeding Knoxville,
Tenn. company is already struggling beneath a recent executive chairman's margin call
that led to panic selling, plus enormous debt, big earnings/revenue misses and low oil
prices.


The last thing the company needs is a hit to its tax credit receipts.


That's because tax credits tied to Miller's exploration in Alaska have meant millions to the
oil and gas company each year. Miller anticipates receiving about $72 million in Alaska tax
credit receipts in 2015.


Alaska issues tax credits to oil producers to encourage exploration in the state. The
company applies for these credits each quarter and frequently notes that operations
depend heavily on tax credit money.


Every spare dime is coveted, as new CEO Carl Giesler told analysts in December:

From both the financial and operational perspective the quarter was disappointing to
put it mildly.


But now it's obvious that Alaska Gov. Bill Walker is having second thoughts about the very
tax credits that keep Miller pumping.


Recently sworn into office, Gov. Walker wrote an opinion piece and made public
comments about some $100 million more going out in oil tax credits than the state will
receive in production taxes. The state's revenue commissioner specifically called out small
explorers and developers in the North Slope and Miller stronghold Cook Inlet.


Gov. Walker's opinion piece stated,


But giving away more in tax breaks than we collect is irresponsible, and it's
unsustainable.


He didn't specifically propose legislation cutting the tax credits. But he alluded to that,
writing:


I look forward to working with the Legislature and all Alaskans to stabilize our
financial health and secure our future.


Working from a recent legislative report examining indirect expenses, Alaska Rep. Steve
Thompson, co-chairman of the House Finance Committee, is taking a closer look at the
issue.


So, the tax credit issue is boiling and presents the possibility of legislative action limiting
those tax credits so critical to Miller's financial core. The ramifications for investors?
Daunting.


TheStreetSweeper has warned investors about Miller previously; shareholders may find
