On January 28, 2013, we released our initial report on China Metal Recycling Holdings Ltd. (“CMR” or 
the “Company”), available here, in which we presented publicly accessible import data from the Chinese 
government suggesting that CMR is engaging in securities fraud and has deceived the market about the 
size of its business.  


As has been noted by several commentators in the media, CMR has failed to issue a detailed response to 
our report, although the Chairman and founder of the Company has broken his silence on two occasions,
first on a conference call hosted by UBS on January 28, 2013, immediately after the issuance of our report 
(the “UBS Conference Call”) and second in an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Times which 
was published on February 26, 2013.  In both instances, the Chairman’s response was evasive and 
contradictory and failed to address in any meaningful way the issues we raised in our report.  


IMPORT QUOTAS REMAIN EVIDENCE OF CMR’S FRAUD


In our report, we highlighted publicly accessible import data from the Chinese government which show 
that CMR could not be legally sourcing anywhere close to the volume of scrap necessary to produce its 
reported volume of processed metals.


Specifically, we cited publicly available data from the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection 
(MEP) that indicates that CMR has never been legally allowed to import more than 87,500 tons of non-
ferrous scrap metal in any year, even though we calculated that the Company would have to import 
an average of ~120,000 tons of non-ferrous scrap per month in 2011-2012 (~ 1,440,000 tons per year) 
to produce its reported output.


It is important to note that on the UBS Conference Call, CMR NEVER refuted our assertion that for the 
Company’s reported production to be true, CMR would have had to import significantly more non-ferrous 
scrap than its quotas allowed.  Instead, CMR’s Chairman and founder, Chun Chi Wai, said that CMR’s 
customers (and not the Company) applied for and used their own import quotas to bring scrap metal into 
China.  Similarly, Chairman Chun told the Hong Kong Economic Times:1


“[秦志威表示]，公司大部分进口废金属都经客户报关，所以不能单从报关数字推算销量”


This explanation is without merit for two reasons: 1) independent data confirms that CMR’s major 
customers do not have the quotas to import the necessary volume of scrap, and 2) it directly contradicts 
CMR’s statements in its securities filings with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

We went back to the Ministry of Environmental Protection (“MEP”) database and checked each 
subsidiary of the GISE Group, CMR’s largest customer since 2006.  According to the MEP database, it 
appears that the GISE Group’s quotas are far smaller than the reported volume of metal that GISE claims 
to sell. 


The only logical explanation is that the GISE Group relies on the quotas of its suppliers to import scrap 
metal.   


Furthermore, CMR’s reported sales volume of non-ferrous metals to GISE vastly exceeds GISE’s
import quotas, as shown in the chart below.


The data is clear: the GISE Group, CMR’s biggest customer, does not have the necessary quotas to import 
the required volume of scrap for the reported sales from CMR to be true. Therefore, CMR’s explanation 
that it relies on its customers’ quotas to import scrap seems implausible.  


Furthermore, CMR’s explanation that it relies on its customers’ import quotas directly contradicts the 
public statements that the Company has made about its business. For example, on Page 40 of the 
Company’s Global Prospectus, it states that:


“Our import license for scrap metal and other licenses are subject to renewal from time to
time or inspection by the PRC Government.


Under current PRC laws and regulations, our import licenses for scrap metal have a term of no 
more than one year and are for a fixed quantity and category of imported waste. Since the 
quantity and category of imported waste in each import license is fixed, we need to apply for 


import licenses from time to time based on the requirements of our operations. To apply for an 
import license, we are required to submit relevant documents to the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection. For additional information, see the section headed “Business — Regulation” in this 
prospectus. We cannot assure you that we will not encounter difficulties in obtaining additional 
import licenses for scrap metal or other required licenses in the future, or that we can obtain 
adequate import licenses in a timely manner to satisfy our production requirements. Any failure 
or difficulty in obtaining such import licenses may adversely impact the volume of our 


imported scrap metal, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results 


of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that the PRC Government will not adopt stricter 
standards (such as environmental requirements) in handling such licenses in the future or that we 
will be able to meet such standards in a timely manner or at all.” (Emphasis added)

CMR states unequivocally that the Company, and not its customers, applies for import licenses “based on 
the requirements of its operations.”   CMR goes on to say that “any failure or difficulty in obtaining such 
import licenses may adversely impact the volume of our imported scrap metal”, which would not be 
the case if the Company could merely circumvent China’s import quotas by having its customers import 
scrap directly. 


Further, if, as the Company now claims, CMR's business relied almost exclusively on import quotas that 
its customers owned and controlled, it would have necessarily been stated in the risk factors section of its 
global prospectus.  Yet, there is no mention of this key risk factor.  So even if the Company’s most recent 
explanation is true, CMR has omitted material facts necessary to make its public statements and filings 
not misleading.  


Not only does CMR’s response directly contradict everything the Company has told the market about 
how it imports raw materials, but more importantly, the MEP database shows that CMR’s customers do 
not have the quotas to import the required volume of scrap for CMR’s sales figures to be true. The 
Company simply appears to be changing its story when presented with contradictory evidence.  


IMPLIED MARKET SHARE NOT CREDIBLE


In our report, we calculated that in order for CMR to produce the Company’s publicly reported volume of 
processed copper, CMR would have to account for 34% of all imported scrap copper and over 50% of the 
Chinese domestic scrap copper market in 2012.  Such a market share is not plausible.


On the UBS Conference Call, CMR replied that its market share was only 6% in 2011, because it
imported 280,000 tons of high quality copper, which it claims was 6% of the total volume of scrap 
imported into China (4.6 million tons) in 2011. Similarly, Chairman Chun told the Hong Kong Economic 
Times:2


“秦志威表示，公司的废金属海外采购量实际上仅 20 多万吨，Glaucus 高估每年需要进口约 144 万
吨”


As we explained in our initial report, the key to understanding the scrap metal recycling business is to 
understand the concept (of what we called) the ‘yield.’   We refer to the yield as the ratio of usable metal 
(i.e. finished product) to raw scrap intake (i.e. the input).  According to Minmetals Futures (a futures 
broking firm owned by China Minmetals Corporation),3 the average yield for scrap imported into China is 
30%.  In other words, for every ten tons of scrap copper imported into China, on average a business like 
CMR strips out three tons of usable copper.  


On the UBS Conference Call, CMR attempted to explain that it imported high quality copper and that our 
yield assumption of 30% was mistaken.  Instead, Chairman Chun told the Hong Kong Economic 
Times that CMR’s yield was at or near 90%,4 which we believe is highly unlikely because it would 
mean that the Company is buying pure copper on the scrap market.  If the Company was importing pure 
copper, it is not a scrap metal recycler but a commodities broker and it should choose a name other than 
China Metal Recycling.


“[秦志威表示]，公司进口的废金属含金属量高达 90%，而非报告所指的 30%”

But even if you assume that CMR’s yield on imported scrap copper is 90%, the Company’s implied 
market share is not credible for the following reasons.


If you take CMR’s new explanation at face value and assume a yield of 90%, then the Company by its 
own admission imported 280,000 tons of scrap in 2011, from which it produced 252,000 tons of ‘pure’ 
copper.  But we know from independent sources that China only imported 4.6 million tons of raw scrap 
in 2011.  The average yield for this scrap was 30%, so according to the China Nonferrous Metals Industry 
Association, the volume of processed copper imported into China in 2011 was only 1.4 million tons.  


If CMR in fact imported 252,000 tons of pure copper in 2011, CMR would account for 18% of the 
copper import market (252,0000 / 1,400,000).  This market share is not plausible, and contradicts the 
Chairman’s own statements that CMR’s market share of imports is closer to 6%.  


Nor is CMR’s implied market share of domestically sourced copper even remotely credible.  The 
Company’s 2011 Annual Report states that CMR sold 668,000 tons of non-ferrous metal that year. If the 
Company sourced 252,000 tons of copper from imports, it would have had to acquire 416,000 tons of 
non-ferrous metals via China’s domestic market.  


As we have shown on page 14 of our report, the total supply of copper from the domestic scrap market 
was only approximately 800,000 tons in 2011.  Therefore, based on the Company’s own words, CMR 
would have to account for 52% of China’s domestic scrap copper supply in 2011, which we believe is 
extremely unlikely.  


We reiterate our conclusion that there is simply not enough scrap copper sold in China for CMR’s 
reported volume to be true, and therefore we conclude that the Company has been making materially 
misleading and false statements to the market.  


GISE SALES APPEAR EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS


In our report, we calculated that for the Company’s financials to be believed, CMR would have to account 
for 84% of the non-ferrous metals supplied to its largest customer (the GISE Group) in 2011, a level of 
supplier concentration we find highly improbable.


Strangely, the Company admitted during the UBS Conference Call that they sold 75,000 tons of non-
ferrous metals to the GISE Group in 2011. This is materially higher than our estimate of 68,786 tons 
(which can be found on page 16 of our report).  


The GISE Group only produced 81,800 tons of non-ferrous metals in 2011, according to figures published 
in the 2012 Guangzhou Yearbook (which we source on page 16 of our report). Therefore, the 75,000 tons

sold to GISE Group would suggest that CMR supplied 92% of GISE’s non-ferrous production in 2011. 
We reiterate our view that such a high level of supplier concentration is very unlikely. This is yet another 
data point suggesting that the Company is vastly exaggerating the size of its business and the amount of 
its sales. 


Chairman Chun told the Hong Kong Economic Times that our analysis was incorrect because GISE was 
not CMR’s largest customer in 2011:5  


“中金再生 09 年上市时，广州钢铁是最大客户，但 2011 年广钢占公司营业额已降至约 10%，再非
最大客户。[秦志威]解释，由于公司业务扩充至华北等地，故客户已逐步分散，广钢占比亦相应
下降，所以公司不存在客户集中度过高的问题”


First, it is important to note that the Company states in its own filings that GISE has been CMR’s largest 
customer from 2006-2011, as shown in the following table. 


Second, Chairman Chun misses the point entirely.  


We highlighted the reported sales from CMR to GISE because it is highly unlikely that a state owned 
enterprise would source 92% of its non-ferrous metal from one supplier, and thus we concluded that 
the Company’s reported sales are not accurate.  Such a level of supplier concentration would be very 
unusual, and we see it as another major red flag in CMR’s reported financials.  


TAX ISSUES


There is additional evidence that we did not cover in our initial report that further suggests CMR has been 
materially misrepresenting the size of its business: namely, CMR’s tax profile.  The Company reports 
paying an effective tax rate of 5%, that is five times less than the effective tax rate paid by Chinese 
competitors and five times less than the stated PRC corporate tax rate (25%).  We believe that this is a 
significant red flag that warrants a closer examination.


The chart below compares the Company’s tax profile to Chiho Tiande (HK: 976), its domestic 
competitor.

In its prospectus, CMR explains that the Company’s “effective tax rate … benefited from the fact that a 
significant portion of our sales was by our Macau subsidiary, which in accordance with Macau Law is not 
subject to income tax for sales made to customers outside of Macau.”  


We have analyzed CMR’s wholly-owned Macau subsidiary, Central Steel (Macao Commercial Offshore) 
Limited (“Central Steel Macau”), to determine whether this so-called ‘Macau Exemption’ would permit 
the Company to so dramatically reduce its taxable income.     


In the table below we set out the purported tax impact of the Company’s Macau subsidiary.   


According to our research and analysis of relevant tax law in Macau, Central Steel Macau is only eligible 
to receive a tax exemption if it “bears” the taxable profit.  Therefore, in 2008, the only way that CMR 
could invoke the Macau Exemption and thereby write off HKD 95 million in taxable income is if the 
Company booked all of its profits before taxation (HKD 331 million) through Central Steel Macau and 
booked zero profits at its PRC based subsidiaries.  


Yet this seems unlikely, because according to CMR’s prospectus, “Sales by Central Steel Macau to 
external customers in 2006, 2007 and 2008 accounted for approximately 32.9%, 53.3% and 44.7%, 
respectively, of the Group’s total revenue and approximately 3.2%, 5.7% and 8.0%, respectively, of the 
Group’s total sales by volume.”6


CMR’s tax profile implies that in 2008, Central Steel Macau accounted for 50% of the total revenue but 
100% of taxable profit, which would mean that CMR’s PRC based operations produced no taxable 
profits.  Zero. 
                                               
6 CMR Annual Report 2011, page 121.

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA METAL RECYCLING HOLDINGS LTD | HK: 0773


However, this explanation seems highly unlikely and it contradicts the Company’s public statements 
about the profitable performance of its PRC-based business.      


While the Company no longer publicly discloses the percentage of total revenues attributed to Central 
Steel Macau, CMR’s 2011 Annual Report states that the Company’s total profit before taxation was HKD 
~2 billion and the tax effect of the Macau exemption grew to HKD 478 million.7  


According to our research and analysis, CMR would have had to book the entire 2011 taxable profit 
(HKD 2 billion) through its Macau subsidiary in order to write off HKD 478 million under the Macau 
exemption to achieve this result.  Again, this seems highly unlikely. 


In our view, it is highly unlikely that the Macau Exemption can explain the red flags in CMR’s tax 
profile.  The stark difference in effective tax rates between CMR and its domestic competitor suggests 
that the Company is either evading taxes, or, as we believe, its taxable profit is much smaller than 
reported (which is supported by the other evidence and analysis set out in our original report).


LOANS FROM CHAIRMAN TO THE COMPANY


Another significant red flag in CMR’s corporate filings is that the Company has regularly obtained 
advances from Chun Chi Wai, its founder, CEO, Chairman and controlling shareholder.


CMR’s claims in its 2011 Annual Report that its “liquidity position remains strong and the Group 
possesses sufficient cash and available banking facilities to meet its commitments and working capital 
requirements.”8  If this is a true statement, why does CMR keep taking loans from Chairman Chun?


CMR obtained an advance from Chairman Chun of HKD 450 million (at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 
2.25%) and HKD 234 million (at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.75%) in 2011 and 2010, respectively.9  
The advances were presumably settled in the same year as they were made.  


In the first half of 2012, the Company obtained an advance of HKD 242 million (at an interest rate of 
LIBOR plus 2.25%).10  The advance was ostensibly settled in the same period. 


Why does it require advances from Chairman Chun if CMR’s liquidity position if it is as strong a 
financial position as the Company claims it to be? This is highly unusual and another significant red flag.   
We believe that either the Company’s public statements about its liquidity position are not true, or CMR 
is in possession of material non-public information that should be disclosed to the markets so that its 
financial statements are not materially misleading.

CONCLUSION


In conclusion, we believe that CMR has failed to adequately or credibly address the evidence and 
arguments we have raised in our report, which taken together, strongly suggested that the Company’s 
public filings and statements contain materially false and misleading statements.  It is our opinion that the 
Company is engaging in securities fraud and has deceived the public market about the size of its business 
and CMR’s true value.

Appendix I


We sourced GISE non-ferrous production figures from the following sources: 


The Ministry of Environmental Protection (“MEP”) tightly regulates scrap metal imports into 
China. Each year, the MEP publishes a list of companies authorized to import non-ferrous scrap 
into the country.  The MEP also maintains a separate public database containing the authorized 
import quotas for each such entity, which can be found at this website (datacenter.mep.gov.cn) 
and accessed by any investor or regulator.  We included a screen shot of the database in our 
original report.  


We checked the MEP database for the import licenses of each GISE subsidiary.  According to 
the MEP database, it appears that only the following GISE subsidiaries are permitted to import 
non-ferrous scrap and only in amounts not to exceed the following quotas:
