Celadon	Group:	Management	Digs	Itself	A	Deeper	Hole
Nov.	1,	2016	10:00	AM	ET3	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


Management’s	response	letter	contains	numerous	red	flags	which	have	only
increased	my	concerns	over	the	Company’s	financial	reporting	practices.


In	FY	2016,	fees	paid	by	CGI	to	BKD	increased	63%	to	$693K.	This	large	and
continued	increase	in	auditor	fees	is	both	highly	concerning	and	unusual.


The	troubling	incentive	structure	of	19th	Capital	further	calls	into	question	the
credibility	of	management.


Also	damaging	to	management’s	credibility	is	its	puzzling	decision	to	increase	the
useful	life	and	salvage	values	of	CGI’s	equipment.


CGI’s	reported	tangible	book	value	is	inflated.	When	off-balance	sheet	liabilities	and
write-downs	are	properly	deducted,	tangible	book	value	is	~$2	or	less	per	share.


On	October	19th,	Celadon	Group	("CGI"	or	the	"Company")	(NYSE:CGI)	issued	a
response	letter	in	an	8K	filing	with	the	SEC.	In	its	response	letter,	management	provided
answers	to	twelve	questions	that	I	had	previously	sent	to	the	Company	via	email.	Although
I	applaud	management	for	publicly	issuing	a	response	letter,	I	did	not	find	it	to	be	very
convincing.	In	fact,	the	numerous	red	flags	contained	in	this	letter	have	only
increased	my	concerns	over	the	Company's	business	and	financial	reporting
practices.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 2/24


In	this	article,	I	will	provide	a	detailed	analysis	of	management's	response	letter.	As	I	will
soon	illustrate,	the	vast	majority	of	the	answers	in	the	letter	either	raised	additional
concerns	about	the	business	or	simply	did	not	answer	the	question	at	hand.	Also,	some	of
management's	responses	directly	contradict	previous	disclosures	and	statements
provided	by	the	Company.	Given	all	of	the	contradictions	and	illogical	statements
contained	in	the	letter,	I	am	surprised	that	management	decided	to	officially	file	it	with	the
SEC.	By	doing	so,	the	Company	may	have	self-implicated	itself	for	misleading
investors.


In	summary,	the	response	letter	is	terrible	news	for	shareholders.	The	fact	that
management	cannot	answer	such	simple	questions	about	its	business	is	highly
concerning.	In	my	previous	articles,	I	stated	that	the	Company	was	likely	using	irregular
accounting	methods	to	inflate	its	profits.	Management's	inability	to	logically	explain	the
numerous	discrepancies	in	its	financial	reports	has	only	increased	this	concern.
Also,	I	argued	that	the	SEC	was	likely	to	investigate	the	Company	given	its	highly	irregular
and	confusing	accounting	practices.	Today,	it	appears	that	an	SEC	investigation	is
even	more	likely	given	that	the	answers	in	the	response	letter	have	only	created
more	confusion.


Although	most	of	this	article	will	be	dedicated	to	discussing	management's	response	letter,
I	will	close	this	article	by	discussing	a	few	additional	items.	First,	I	will	provide	further
examples	of	management's	highly	questionable	behavior.	For	instance,	management
currently	owns	a	significant	amount	of	Class	B	shares	in	19th	Capital.	This	has	created	a
troubling	conflict	of	interest	where	management	is	incentivized	to	maximize	profits	at	19th
Capital	at	the	expense	of	CGI	shareholders.	The	highly	conflicted	ownership	structure
of	19 	Capital	indicates	that	management	may	be	more	interested	in	lining	its
pockets	than	maximizing	value	for	shareholders.


Another	example	of	questionable	management	behavior	is	its	recent	decision	to	increase
the	useful	life	and	salvage	values	of	CGI's	equipment.	Due	to	what	is	expected	to	be	a
multi-year	slump	in	the	used	truck	market,	this	decision	by	management	to	increase
the	residual	value	of	its	equipment	makes	no	sense.	In	fact,	just	a	couple	weeks	ago,
Covenant	Transportation	(NASDAQ:CVTI)	wrote	down	the	value	of	its	equipment	by
lowering	its	salvage	values.	I	am	not	sure	why	management	decided	to	take	this	action,
but	it	does	not	reflect	well	on	its	credibility.


Finally,	following	my	analysis	of	management's	questionable	behavior,	I	will	discuss	the
misleading	nature	of	CGI's	reported	tangible	book	value.	Some	research	analysts	have
cited	CGI's	over	$11	per	share	of	tangible	book	value	as	evidence	that	its	shares	are

undervalued.	However,	as	I	will	demonstrate,	this	is	a	flawed	assertion.


The	reason	is	because	reported	tangible	book	value	does	not	take	into	account	a
significant	amount	of	off-balance	sheet	liabilities	(i.e.	operating	leases,	reserve	account
liabilities)	and	equipment	write-downs.	When	these	items	are	properly	deducted,
adjusted	tangible	book	value	falls	to	around	$2	or	less	per	share.	Thus,	investors
should	not	rely	on	tangible	book	value	as	a	margin	of	safety.


Overall,	based	on	management's	underwhelming	response	letter	and	the	additional
concerns	highlighted	in	this	article,	I	believe	CGI	remains	a	tremendous	short	opportunity.


Section	1:	Management's	Response	Letter	Has	Raised	Additional	Red	Flags


In	the	next	section,	I	will	provide	a	detailed	analysis	of	each	of	the	twelve	answers
provided	by	management	in	its	response	letter.	However,	before	doing	so,	I	think	it	would
be	helpful	to	first	provide	my	summary	thoughts	on	the	letter.


Overall,	I	believe	the	response	letter	has	done	little	to	ease	the	concerns	of	investors.	If
anything,	it	has	likely	had	the	opposite	effect.	Most	of	the	answers	in	the	letter	either	(1)
raised	additional	concerns	over	CGI's	financial	reporting	methods	or	(2)	did	not
sufficiently	address	the	question	at	hand.	Key	takeaways	from	my	analysis	of	the
response	letter	are	as	follows:


The	continued	purchase	of	trucks	by	Quality	remains	puzzling


In	answer	#9	of	the	letter,	management	stated	that	Quality's	continued	purchase	of	large
amounts	of	trucks	in	2H	2016	was	due	to	$83.5mm	of	purchase	commitments	as	of
12/31/15.	Unfortunately,	this	explanation	makes	little	sense.	In	past	filings	and
correspondences	with	the	SEC,	the	Company	clearly	stated	that	its	purchase
commitments	were	not	firm	obligations	and	could	be	readily	canceled.


Given	that	it	is	such	a	simple	question,	I	am	puzzled	by	management's	inability	to	provide
a	logical	answer	for	its	continued	truck	purchases.	I	believe	this	further	indicates	that
something	may	be	seriously	amiss	with	CGI's	financial	reporting.	Also	concerning	is	the
fact	that	management's	statements	about	its	purchase	commitments	in	the	response	letter
directly	contradict	past	SEC	filings.	By	providing	contradictory	information	to	the	SEC,
management	appears	to	have	self-implicated	itself	for	misleading	shareholders.


The	response	letter	has	increased	concerns	over	CGI's	accounting	methods
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: Management Digs Itself A Deeper Hole - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 4/24


In	my	previous	articles,	I	pointed	out	unusual	mismatches	in	the	changes	in	certain
working	capital	items	on	CGI's	balance	sheet	versus	its	cash	flow	statement.	I	also
highlighted	how	its	actual	Q3	PP&E	balance	was	over	$22mm	higher	than	what	was
implied	by	its	capex,	depreciation	and	proceeds	from	asset	sales.


In	answers	#1	and	#4	of	the	response	letter,	management	provided	an	explanation	for
some	of	these	major	accounting	discrepancies.	Management	claimed	that	its	working
capital	mismatches	and	seemingly	inflated	PP&E	balance	were	largely	due	to	accrued
liabilities	where	an	item	was	received	but	cash	had	not	yet	been	paid.	However,	an
analysis	of	CGI's	financial	statements	reveals	that	this	explanation	makes	little	sense.


For	example,	in	Q3	2016,	CGI's	accrued	liabilities	for	equipment	purchases	was	just
$464K.	Thus,	accrued	liabilities	cannot	explain	the	$22mm	difference	between	CGI's
implied	and	actual	Q3	2016	PP&E	balance.


Management	also	claimed	that	acquisitions	and	currency	fluctuations	were	major
contributors	to	its	recent	accounting	discrepancies.	Unfortunately,	these	claims	also	make
little	sense.	In	2H	2016,	CGI	spent	only	$531K	on	acquisitions,	and	its	gains	from	foreign
currency	translations	were	just	$3.4mm.	Thus,	acquisitions	and	currency	fluctuations
could	not	have	caused	such	large	accounting	discrepancies.


Overall,	management's	explanation	for	these	unusual	discrepancies	in	its	financial
statements	made	little	sense.	Thus,	I	continue	to	be	highly	skeptical	of	the	accuracy	and
integrity	of	CGI's	accounting	methods.


Management's	statements	about	its	reserve	liabilities	also	make	little	sense


In	answer	#8	of	its	response	letter,	management	states	that	its	reserve	account	liabilities
are	reflected	as	deferred	leasing	revenue	liabilities	on	its	balance	sheet.	Management	also
claims	that,	as	of	the	end	of	FY	2016,	the	Company	had	entirely	paid	off	the	$74mm	of
reserve	account	liabilities	owed	to	Element.


The	claim	by	management	that	reserve	account	liabilities	are	included	in	deferred	leasing
revenue	liabilities	does	not	add	up.	For	example,	in	Q1	2016,	the	Company	had	$40.7mm
of	deferred	leasing	revenue	liabilities	on	its	balance	sheet.	At	the	same	time,	in	Q1	2016,
CGI	made	$2.9mm	of	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	directly	to	Element	(reflected	in
other	assets).


The	fact	that	the	Company	was	making	direct	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	to
Element	in	Q1	2016	while	still	having	$40.7mm	of	unpaid	reserve	liabilities	makes	little
sense.	According	to	disclosures	in	its	FY	2016	10K,	direct	lease	shortfall	advance

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 5/24


payments	are	made	only	after	the	unpaid	reserve	account	liabilities	are	fully	paid	off.
Given	this	unusual	contradiction,	it	is	hard	to	have	any	confidence	that	the	$74mm	of
reserve	account	liabilities	have	been	properly	accounted	for.


Further	increase	in	fees	paid	to	BKD	in	FY	2016	debunks	management's	explanation
for	increase	in	FY	2015	fees


In	answer	#10	of	the	letter,	management	provided	an	explanation	for	the	over	70%
increase	in	the	fees	it	paid	to	BKD	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015.	Management	attributed	this
large	increase	in	fees	to	acquisitions,	a	secondary	equity	offering	and	Quality-related
accounting	work.	However,	this	explanation	does	not	add	up	based	on	the	Company's
latest	proxy	filing	which	was	just	released	a	few	days	ago.


In	the	latest	proxy	filing,	it	was	revealed	that	the	fees	CGI	paid	to	BKD	increased	in	FY
2016	by	another	63%	relative	to	FY	2015.	This	does	not	make	sense	given	that	the
Company	significantly	scaled	back	its	acquisition	activity	and	did	not	complete	a
secondary	offering	in	FY	2016.	Based	on	management's	explanation	for	the	increase	in
FY	2015	fees,	it	would	stand	to	reason	that	the	fees	paid	to	BKD	in	FY	2016	should	have
declined.


Putting	aside	the	fact	that	the	increase	in	fees	makes	little	sense,	the	almost	$700K	that
CGI	is	now	paying	to	BKD	on	an	annual	basis	is	simply	absurd.	This	is	almost	180%
higher	than	what	CGI	had	paid	to	BKD	in	FY	2014.	Thus,	I	continue	to	remain	skeptical	of
CGI's	relationship	with	its	auditor.


The	claim	that	CGI's	safety	violations	are	common	is	simply	not	true


In	response	to	my	question	about	its	recent	safety	violations,	management	simply	stated
that	these	violations	were	common	amongst	its	competitors.	However,	a	review	of	the
latest	filings	of	companies	in	the	trucking	space	reveals	that	this	is	simply	not	true.	I	am
not	sure	why	management	is	claiming	otherwise.


Many	answers	in	the	letter	did	not	properly	address	my	question


In	some	of	its	answers,	management	simply	dodged	the	question	that	was	being	asked.	I
believe	that	answers	#2,	#5	and	#11	of	the	response	letter	fall	into	this	category


To	be	honest,	I	am	quite	surprised	that	management	decided	to	submit	its	response	letter
in	an	8K	filing.	As	shown	from	the	above	summary,	the	letter	contains	numerous
contradictions	and	illogical	statements	which	only	seem	to	further	raise	suspicions	over	its

financial	reporting.	As	I	discussed	in	my	prior	article,	CGI	already	appears	to	be	on	the
SEC's	radar.	Given	this	fact,	it	is	likely	that	these	numerous	red	flags	in	the	response
letter	will	not	go	unnoticed	by	the	SEC.


Section	2:	A	More	Detailed	Analysis	of	the	Response	Letter


In	this	section,	I	have	provided	a	detailed	analysis	of	each	of	the	twelve	answers	in
management's	response	letter.	Although	I	believe	the	previous	section	captures	most	of
my	key	thoughts	on	the	letter,	I	think	providing	investors	with	a	more	in-depth	analysis	is
also	helpful.


Answer	#1


In	response	to	my	question	about	why	the	changes	in	certain	working	capital	items	did	not
match	between	the	balance	sheet	and	cash	flow	statement,	management	provided	the
following	three	reasons:


1.	The	balance	sheet	includes	items	where	a	liability	has	been	accrued	but	the	cash	has
not	yet	been	paid


2.	Acquisitions
3.	Currency	fluctuations


Unfortunately,	these	three	items	cannot	explain	the	large	working	capital	discrepancies
which	I	have	previously	pointed	out.


For	example,	consider	the	following	comparison	of	the	change	in	equipment	held	for	sale
on	the	balance	sheet	versus	cash	flow	statement	in	Q4	2016:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/10/9036121_14778702558292_rId7.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 7/24


In	Q4	2016,	the	quarter-over-quarter	increase	in	equipment	held	for	sale	on	the	balance
sheet	was	$21.9mm	higher	than	the	change	reflected	in	the	cash	flow	statement.	As	I	will
walk	through	below,	none	of	the	reasons	cited	by	management	can	possibly	explain	this
large	disparity	of	$21.9mm.


In	terms	of	acquisitions	(bullet	point	#2	above),	the	Company	did	not	make	any
acquisitions	in	Q4	2016.	Therefore,	acquisitions	cannot	explain	this	large	difference	in	the
change	in	equipment	held	for	sale.


The	same	goes	for	currency	fluctuations	(bullet	point	#3).	In	Q4	2016,	the	Company
reported	a	loss	on	foreign	currency	translation	of	$1.9mm.	For	obvious	reasons,	a	loss	of
$1.9mm	on	foreign	currency	translations	cannot	cause	the	$21.9mm	disparity	calculated
above.


That	leaves	accrued	liabilities	(bullet	point	#1)	as	the	only	remaining	possible	explanation.
However,	an	analysis	of	CGI's	balance	sheet	reveals	that	accrued	liabilities	could	not	have
caused	this	disparity	either.	Provided	below	is	the	current	liabilities	section	of	the
Company's	year-end	FY	2016	balance	sheet	(as	per	its	FY	2016	10K):


CGI's	accrued	equipment	purchase	liabilities	are	shown	as	"accrued	equipment
purchases"	in	the	current	liabilities	section	of	its	balance	sheet.	As	highlighted	in	the	red
box	above,	at	the	end	of	FY	2016,	the	Company	did	not	have	any	accrued	equipment
purchases.


The	fact	that	accrued	equipment	purchases	were	zero	at	the	end	of	Q4	2016	means	that
accrued	liabilities	cannot	explain	the	large	disparity	in	the	change	in	equipment	held	for
sale.	According	to	management,	the	$21.9mm	difference	between	the	balance	sheet	and
cash	flow	statement	reflects	equipment	that	has	been	received	but	not	yet	paid	for.


To	account	for	this	future	cash	payment	liability,	the	Company's	accrued	equipment
purchases	at	the	end	of	Q4	2016	should	have	also	been	at	least	$21.9mm.	Yet,	this	was
clearly	not	the	case	as	CGI	did	not	have	any	accrued	equipment	purchases	at	the	end	of

the	year.


From	the	above	analysis,	it	should	be	clear	that	management's	explanation	for	its	working
capital	irregularities	makes	little	sense.	The	fact	management	cannot	explain	these
discrepancies	only	heightens	my	suspicions	over	its	accounting	methods.	Thus,
instead	of	helping	to	ease	the	confusion	and	concerns	of	investors,	management's
response	to	my	working	capital	question	has	had	the	opposite	effect.


Answer	#2


On	pg.	38	of	CGI's	FY	2016	10K,	the	following	is	stated:


"Included	in	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities	is	the	change	in	leased	and
revenue	equipment	held	for	sale.	The	change	in	the	account	is	made	up	of	the	net
purchases	and	sales	of	equipment	purchased	only	for	the	benefit	of	our
equipment	leasing	and	services	segment."


In	the	above	quote,	it	is	clearly	stated	that	equipment	held	for	sale	represents	equipment
purchased	for	its	Quality	business	(equipment	leasing	and	services	segment).	However,
on	pg.	52	of	its	FY	2016	10K,	CGI	contradicts	itself	by	stating	the	following:


"The	majority	of	the	assets	included	in	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	were
acquired	to	be	resold	and	those	assets	have	been	recorded	at	cost.	As	of	June	30,
2016,	33%	of	the	units	held	for	sale	was	comprised	of	old	Celadon	fleet
equipment	no	longer	in	service	versus	newly	purchased	equipment."


In	this	disclosure,	the	Company	states	that	33%	of	its	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	is
comprised	of	equipment	used	in	CGI's	fleet.	This	directly	contradicts	its	previous
disclosure	on	pg.	38	that	equipment	held	for	sale	was	comprised	only	of	equipment
purchased	by	its	Quality	business.


I	asked	management	to	explain	this	odd	contradiction.	However,	as	can	be	seen	from	its
response	above,	management's	very	brief	answer	did	little	to	clear	up	this	confusion.


Answer	#3

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 9/24


In	response	to	my	question	about	why	sale	proceeds	from	PP&E	were	negative	in	Q2
2016,	management	explained	that	it	was	due	to	the	reclassification	of	sale	proceeds	from
investing	activities	to	operating	activities.	I	do	not	have	a	meaningful	rebuttal	to	this
answer.	However,	the	fact	that	management	had	to	reclassify	its	PP&E	accounting	from
prior	periods	does	little	to	inspire	confidence	in	the	accuracy	of	its	financial	reports.


Answer	#4


Another	accounting	irregularity	that	I	asked	management	to	address	was	its	seemingly
inflated	PP&E	balance.	For	example,	in	Q3	2016,	the	quarter-over-quarter	change	in
CGI's	PP&E	balance	did	not	match	what	was	implied	by	its	capex,	depreciation	and	asset
sales:


As	shown	above,	in	Q3	2016,	the	Company's	actual	PP&E	balance	was	$22.3mm	higher
than	what	was	implied	by	its	reported	capex,	depreciation	and	proceeds	from	asset	sales.
In	its	response	to	my	question,	management	provided	the	following	three	reasons	for	this

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 10/24


discrepancy:


1.	The	balance	sheet	includes	accrued	liabilities	for	PP&E	that	CGI	has	received	but	not
yet	paid	cash	for


2.	PP&E	is	reduced	by	equipment	moved	from	PP&E	into	equipment	held	for	sale
3.	Currency	fluctuations


Once	again,	similar	to	its	response	to	my	working	capital	question,	management's
explanation	of	its	seemingly	inflated	PP&E	balance	makes	little	sense.	For	starters,	in
regards	to	bullet	point	#1	above,	a	quick	glance	at	CGI's	Q3	2016	balance	sheet	reveals
that	accrued	liabilities	cannot	explain	this	$22.3mm	difference.	Provided	below	is	the
current	liabilities	section	of	its	Q3	2016	balance	sheet	(as	per	its	Q3	2016	10Q:


According	to	management,	the	$22.3mm	mismatch	between	the	implied	and	actual	Q3
2016	PP&E	balance	was	largely	due	to	equipment	that	it	had	received	but	not	yet	paid	for.
To	account	for	this	future	payment	liability,	the	Company	should	have	accrued	a
meaningful	amount	of	accrued	equipment	purchases	on	its	balance	sheet.	However,	as
highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	its	accrued	equipment	purchases	balance	was	less	than
$1mm	at	the	end	of	Q3	2016.


The	movement	of	equipment	from	PP&E	to	equipment	held	for	sale	(bullet	point	#2)	also
cannot	explain	this	discrepancy.	The	movement	of	PP&E	into	equipment	held	for	sale
would	have	made	its	actual	PP&E	balance	lower	than	its	implied	PP&E	balance.	However,
CGI's	actual	Q3	2016	PP&E	balance	was	$22.3mm	higher	than	its	implied	PP&E	balance.


Finally,	currency	fluctuations	(bullet	point	#3)	also	cannot	explain	its	inflated	PP&E
balance.	In	Q3	2016,	the	Company	reported	a	gain	of	$5.3mm	from	foreign	currency
translations.	This	is	far	less	than	the	$22.3mm	disparity	in	its	actual	versus	implied	Q3
2016	PP&E	balance.


Thus,	once	again,	management	was	unable	to	provide	a	logical	answer	to	one	of	my
key	accounting	questions.	This	provides	further	strong	evidence	that	the	Company's
financial	reports	simply	cannot	be	trusted.

Answer	#5


On	pg.	67	of	its	FY	2016	10K,	CGI	disclosed	the	following	in	regards	to	the	amount	of	net
proceeds	it	received	from	equipment	sales	in	FY	2016:


"Total	net	proceeds	and	net	gain	as	a	result	of	these	transactions	during	the	year
ended	June	30,	2016	was	$328.6	million	and	$22.4	million,	respectively"


"Total	net	proceeds	and	net	gains	are	inclusive	of	the	amounts	recorded	from	19th
Capital"


As	described	in	the	above	quotes,	in	FY	2016,	the	Company	received	total	net	proceeds
of	$328.6mm	from	equipment	sales.	The	total	net	proceeds	in	FY	2016	included	$30mm
of	proceeds	received	in	Q4	2016	from	19th	Capital.


By	subtracting	the	$30mm	of	proceeds	received	in	Q4	2016	from	$328.6mm	of	total	FY
2016	net	proceeds,	it	can	be	calculated	that	CGI	should	have	reported	total	YTD	net
proceeds	of	$298.6mm	in	the	prior	quarter.	However,	as	disclosed	on	pg.	13	of	its	Q3
2016	10Q,	its	actual	YTD	Q3	2016	equipment	sale	proceeds	were	$20mm	higher	at
$318.6mm:


"Total	net	proceeds	of	units	during	the	three	and	nine	months	ended	March	31,	2016
was	$30.4	million	and$318.6	million,	respectively."


I	asked	management	to	explain	why	this	discrepancy	exists.	However,	as	can	be	seen
from	its	response	above,	the	answer	it	provided	has	no	relevance	to	my	question.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 12/24


Management's	justification	for	the	continuous	changing	of	its	equipment	held	for	sale
reporting	is	that	it	wants	to	provide	more	clarity	to	investors.	However,	if	this	is	the	case,
then	how	does	it	explain	the	following	statement	from	its	Q4	2016	earnings	release?


"At	June	30,	2016,	leased	assets	held	for	sale,	were	approximately	$24.9	million	and
revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	was	approximately	$45.0	million,	compared	to
$52.6	million	and	$49.9	million	at	June	30,	2015."


The	above	disclosure	makes	it	appear	as	if	CGI's	equipment	held	for	sale	actually
declined	in	FY	2016.	The	reason	is	because	management	excluded	$99.3mm	of	leased
assets	(which	are	a	part	of	equipment	held	for	sale)	from	this	disclosure.	When	leased
assets	are	properly	included,	equipment	held	for	sale	actually	increased	by	$66.3mm	from
$102.8mm	at	the	end	of	FY	2015	to	$169.1mm	at	the	end	of	FY	2016.


Thus,	the	misleading	manner	in	which	management	reports	equipment	held	for	sale
directly	contradicts	its	claim	that	it	is	trying	to	provide	more	clarity	to	investors.


Answer	#7	and	#8


I	have	grouped	together	my	rebuttal	to	answers	#7	and	#8	since	both	pertain	to	the	same
general	topic.


As	I	discussed	in	my	previous	article	on	CGI,	the	Company	appears	to	have	$74mm	of
reserve	account	liabilities	that	it	is	not	accounting	for	in	its	balance	sheet.	In	response	to
my	question	about	why	this	liability	was	not	included	on	its	balance	sheet,	management
claimed	that	this	had	been	reflected	in	its	liabilities	as	deferred	leasing	revenue.	It	also
claimed	that	the	entire	$74mm	of	reserve	account	liabilities	had	been	paid	off	as	of	the
end	of	FY	2016.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 13/24


Unfortunately,	yet	again,	management's	response	does	not	add	up.	Provided	below	is	the
current	liabilities	section	of	CGI's	Q1	2016	balance	sheet	(as	per	its	Q1	2016	10Q:


As	highlighted	above,	at	the	end	of	Q1	2016,	the	Company	had	$40.7mm	of	deferred
leasing	revenue	liabilities	outstanding.	Thus,	based	on	management's	response,	CGI	still
had	$40.7mm	of	unpaid	reserve	account	liabilities	at	the	end	of	Q1.


With	this	in	mind,	I	have	provided	below	CGI's	Q1	2016	operating	cash	flow	statement:


The	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	made	by	CGI	to	Element	are	reflected	in	other
assets.	As	shown	above,	in	Q1	2016,	it	appears	that	CGI	made	$2.9mm	of	lease	shortfall
advance	payments	to	Element.	Now,	consider	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	24	of
CGI's	FY	2016	10K:


"Lease	Shortfall	Advances…initially	were	subject	to	satisfaction	from	a	reserve	fund
that	amounted	to	approximately	$74	million.	This	fund	has	been	exhausted.	We	are
required	to	fund	the	Lease	Shortfall	Advances	directly	after	the	fund	is	exhausted.
As	of	June	30,	2016,	we	have	advanced	approximately	$31.9	million…"


According	to	the	above	disclosure,	CGI	initially	funds	any	lease	shortfall	with	its	$74mm
reserve	account.	It	is	only	after	this	reserve	is	fully	exhausted	that	the	Company	begins	to
make	lease	shortfall	advance	payments	directly	to	Element	(as	reflected	in	other	assets).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 14/24


Based	on	this	information,	it	should	be	clear	why	management's	claim	that	reserve
account	liabilities	are	included	in	deferred	leasing	revenue	makes	little	sense.	In	Q1	2016,
the	Company	directly	paid	$2.9mm	of	lease	shortfall	advances	despite	still	having
$40.7mm	of	deferred	leasing	revenue	liabilities	(aka	reserve	account	liabilities).	Why
was	the	Company	directly	paying	lease	shortfall	advances	when	it	still	had	such	a	large
amount	of	unpaid	reserve	liabilities?	This	does	not	add	up.


I	believe	management	needs	to	further	clarify	its	accounting	methods	for	CGI's	lease
shortfall	advance	payments	and	reserve	liabilities.	Until	it	does,	it	is	hard	to	have	any
confidence	that	its	$74mm	reserve	liability	has	been	properly	accounted	for.


Answer	#9


As	I	detailed	in	my	previous	article,	in	2H	2016,	CGI	spent	almost	$48.8mm	of	net	cash	on
truck	purchases	for	the	Quality	business.	This	continued	purchase	of	trucks	by	Quality
made	little	sense	given	the	increasingly	soft	used	truck	market,	as	well	as	management's
stated	intention	to	completely	liquidate	its	Quality	truck	inventory	by	the	end	of	FY	2016.


In	response	to	my	question	about	why	it	continued	to	purchase	large	amounts	of	trucks
despite	stating	its	intentions	to	completely	liquidate	Quality's	inventory,	management	made
the	following	two	claims:


1.	It	never	stated	that	it	expected	Quality's	inventory	to	be	completely	liquidated	by	the
end	of	the	year.	Instead,	it	expected	to	liquidate	Quality's	current	inventory	held	for
sale,	but	still	continue	to	purchase	trucks	in	2H	2016


2.	The	reason	for	the	continued	purchasing	of	equipment	by	Quality	in	2H	2016	can	be
attributed	to	CGI's	$83.5mm	of	equipment	purchase	commitments	as	of	12/31/15	(end
of	Q2	2016)


Based	on	past	disclosures	and	statements	provided	by	the	Company	and	management,
both	of	these	claims	do	not	appear	to	be	true.


In	regards	to	the	first	claim	listed	above,	management	clearly	communicated	that	it
expected	Quality's	inventory	to	be	completely	liquidated	by	the	end	of	FY	2016.	Consider
the	following	exchange	between	CGI's	CEO	Paul	Will	and	a	research	analyst	during	the
Q2	2016	earnings	call:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 15/24


Analyst:	"So	in	about	six	months,	we	should	expect	the	assets	held	for	-	equipment
held	for	sale	to	be	zero	basically?"


Mr.	Will:	"Basically,	I	mean,	could	there	be	some	assets	that	on	the	Celadon	side	as
we	disposed,	could	there	be	balance	of	$5	million,	$10	million,	$15	million	or	some
nominal	number	on	a	relative	basis	to	our	users	today,	yes.	But	for	most	part,	the
answer	is	yes.	So	it	will	be	our	expectation	is	that	should	go	to	zero."


In	the	above	exchange,	Mr.	Will	clearly	states	that	he	expects	Quality's	inventory	will	be
liquidated	to	zero	by	the	end	of	FY	2016.	Thus,	I	am	puzzled	as	to	why	management	now
claims	it	never	communicated	this	to	shareholders.


Management's	claim	that	Quality's	truck	purchases	in	2H	2016	were	due	to	equipment
purchase	commitments	(second	bullet	point	above)	also	makes	little	sense.	Consider	the
following	disclosure	from	pg.	24	of	CGI's	Q2	2016	10Q:


"In	general,	Quality's	tractor	purchase	orders	do	not	become	"firm
commitment"	orders	for	which	we	are	irrevocably	obligated	until	shortly	before
purchase.	However,	failure	to	consummate	these	orders	could	have	a	material
adverse	effect	on	Quality's	growth	prospects."


In	its	Q2	2016	10Q,	the	Company	disclosed	that	Quality's	equipment	purchase
commitments	did	not	become	"firm	commitment"	orders	until	shortly	before	purchase.	CGI
further	confirmed	this	fact	in	its	direct	correspondences	with	the	SEC.	The	following
disclosures	are	from	CGI's	April	2016	letter	to	the	SEC:


"Generally,	our	purchase	orders	do	not	become	firm	commitment	orders	for
which	we	are	irrevocably	obligated	until	shortly	before	purchase.	We	may	also
choose	to	time	our	purchases	based	on	performance	of	existing	equipment
throughout	the	year."


"In	future	filings	we	will	improve	our	disclosures	of	planned	material	commitments	as
well	as	disclose	our	ability	to	readily	manipulate	our	plans	on	relatively	short
notice."


Based	on	the	above	disclosures	(in	both	its	SEC	correspondence	letter	and	10Q),	the
Company	has	made	it	very	clear	that	equipment	purchase	commitments	are	not	firm
orders.	Thus,	it	appears	that	purchase	commitments	cannot	be	the	reason	for	the	large
amount	of	truck	purchases	by	Quality	in	2H	2016.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 16/24


Further	supporting	this	assertion	is	the	following	statement	provided	by	management
during	its	Q2	2016	earnings	call:


"We	do	not	anticipate	having	any	significant	net	capital	expenditure	needs	for	the
next	12	to	18	months,	so	we	will	continue	to	focus	on	paying	down	debt	and
reducing	our	leverage."


Management	clearly	states	that	it	does	not	expect	to	have	any	significant	capex	needs	for
the	next	12	to	18	months.	This	strongly	indicates	that	the	Company's	$83.5mm	of
purchase	commitments	at	the	end	of	Q2	2016	were	/	are	not	firm	obligations.


Overall,	management's	response	regarding	Quality	makes	little	sense.	The	fact	that
management	cannot	logically	explain	Quality's	continued	truck	purchases	in	2H
2016	should	be	of	great	concern	for	shareholders.	In	my	opinion,	its	inability	to	answer
such	a	simple	question	is	yet	another	indication	that	something	is	seriously	amiss	with
CGI's	financial	reporting.


Also	concerning	is	the	fact	that	CGI	has	clearly	provided	contradictory	information
in	its	filings.	In	its	response	letter,	management	has	indicated	that	purchase
commitments	are	firm	commitments,	while	in	its	10K	and	SEC	correspondences	it	has
indicated	the	opposite.	Such	glaring	inconsistencies	could	set	off	red	flags	within	the
SEC.


Answer	#10


In	regards	to	audit	fees,	management	attributed	the	over	70%	increase	in	fees	paid	to
BKD	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015	on	three	things:	acquisitions,	a	secondary	equity	offering
and	Quality-related	accounting	work.	However,	this	explanation	does	not	add	up	based	on
the	Company's	latest	proxy	filing	which	was	released	just	a	few	days	ago	on	October	28th.


On	pg.	46	of	its	proxy	filing,	CGI	provided	the	following	breakdown	of	the	fees	it	paid	to
BKD	in	FY	2016:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 17/24


In	FY	2016,	the	fees	CGI	paid	to	BKD	increased	by	another	63%	from	$426K	in	FY	2015
to	$693K	in	FY	2016.	This	large	increase	in	fees	does	not	make	sense	given	that	the
Company	significantly	scaled	back	its	acquisition	activity	and	did	not	complete	a
secondary	offering	in	FY	2016.	Based	on	management's	explanation	for	the	increase	in
FY	2015	fees,	it	would	stand	to	reason	that	the	fees	paid	to	BKD	in	FY	2016	should	have
declined.


Putting	aside	the	fact	that	the	continued	increase	in	fees	makes	little	sense,	the	almost
$700K	that	CGI	is	now	paying	to	BKD	on	an	annual	basis	is	simply	absurd.	Such	a	large
amount	of	auditor	fees	is	unusual	for	a	relatively	small	company	like	CGI.


Thus,	based	on	the	large	and	increasing	amount	of	fees	paid	to	BKD	in	FY	2016,	I
continue	to	remain	highly	skeptical	of	CGI's	relationship	with	its	auditor.


Answer	#11


I	asked	management	why	it	took	out	an	expensive	$30mm	loan	from	19th	Capital	rather
than	draw	on	its	much	cheaper	revolver.	I	also	asked	it	whether	it	took	out	this	loan	from
19th	Capital	due	to	CGI's	tight	covenant	situation.	As	can	be	seen	from	its	response,
management	basically	dodged	these	questions	and	provided	a	boilerplate	description	of
its	loan	from	19th	Capital.


Answer	#12


In	response	to	my	question	about	CGI's	multiple	CSA	safety	violations,	management
simply	stated	that	these	violations	are	common	amongst	its	competitors.	However,	a

reveals	that	such	safety	violations	are	not	common.	I	am	not	sure	why	management	is
claiming	otherwise.


Section	3:	Further	Evidence	of	Questionable	Management	Behavior


In	this	section,	I	will	touch	upon	a	couple	of	items	which	further	call	into	question	the
credibility	of	management.	At	this	point,	I	think	that	my	analysis	of	CGI's	response	letter,
as	well	as	my	prior	articles,	have	clearly	illustrated	that	management	cannot	be	trusted.
However,	for	the	sake	of	really	driving	home	this	point,	I	will	highlight	some	more
examples	of	management's	questionable	behavior.


The	first	item	that	I	will	discuss	is	the	concerning	ownership	/	incentive	structure	of	19th
Capital.	As	I	briefly	touched	upon	in	my	previous	articles,	19th	Capital	is	a	joint	venture
formed	in	September	2015	by	CGI	and	Larsen	MacColl	Partners,	a	private	equity	firm
based	in	Philadelphia.	19th	Capital	was	formed	for	the	primary	purpose	of	providing
Quality	with	another	dedicated	buyer	for	its	equipment.


Larsen	MacColl	is	the	majority	owner	of	the	JV	at	67%,	while	CGI	owns	the	remaining
33%.	The	fact	CGI	is	part-owner	of	19th	Capital	is	somewhat	concerning.	By	selling
trucks	to	an	entity	that	it	partly	owns,	CGI	/	Quality	is,	to	some	degree,	selling
trucks	to	itself.


That	being	said,	the	bigger	issue	with	19th	Capital	is	its	highly	unusual	incentive	structure.
The	following	table	is	from	pg.	20	of	CGI's	October	2015	proxy	filing:


When	19th	Capital	was	formed,	certain	members	of	CGI	/	Quality's	senior	management
team	received	profit	interests	in	the	JV.	These	profit	interests	were	distributed	in	the	form
of	Class	B	shares.	As	shown	in	the	table	above,	on	a	combined	basis,	four	members	of
management	received	a	14.5%	interest	in	the	Class	B	shares.


Class	B	shares	are	entitled	to	a	portion	of	19th	Capital's	profits.	The	specific	manner	in
which	the	Class	B	shareholders	are	compensated	is	described	in	the	following	disclosure
from	pg.	19	of	the	proxy:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 19/24


"Generally,	any	distributions	are	paid	first	to	the	Class	A	members	up	to	an
amount	equal	to	their	respective	capital	contributions,	plus	a	Class	A	preferred
return	of	12%	per	annum	of	their	respective	capital	contributions,	then	to	the
Class	B	members	in	accordance	with	their	percentage	interests."


Basically,	Class	A	shareholders	(Larsen	MacColl	-	67%,	CGI	-	33%)	are	entitled	to	any
capital	distributions	up	to	a	12%	return	threshold.	Any	amount	of	19th	Capital's	profits
above	the	12%	threshold	is	then	distributed	to	Class	B	shareholders.	As	an	example,	if
19th	Capital	purchased	$100	worth	of	trucks	and	received	$150	of	total	distributions,	$112
would	go	to	Class	A	shareholders	while	the	remaining	$38	would	be	split	amongst	the
Class	B	shareholders.


For	what	are	fairly	obvious	reasons,	this	incentive	structure	represents	a	significant	and
concerning	conflict	of	interest.	Because	management	owns	a	large	amount	of	profit
interests	in	19 	Capital,	it	is	incentivized	to	maximize	profits	at	19 	Capital	at	the
expense	of	CGI	/	Quality.	In	other	words,	it	is	incentivized	to	sell	Quality's	trucks	at	a
lower	price	in	order	to	increase	returns	and	its	profits	at	19th	Capital.


The	fact	that	management	would	structure	19th	Capital	in	such	a	conflicted	manner	is
irresponsible	and	highly	concerning.	It	indicates	that	management	may	be	more	interested
in	lining	its	own	pockets	rather	than	maximizing	value	for	CGI	shareholders.


Another	example	of	questionable	behavior	by	management	is	its	recent	decision	to
increase	the	salvage	values	and	useful	life	of	CGI's	equipment.	For	reasons	which	I	will
discuss	below,	these	accounting	changes	make	no	sense	in	the	context	of	the	current
industry	environment.


Due	to	the	ongoing	downturn	in	the	trucking	industry,	prices	for	used	trucks	have	been	in
free	fall	over	the	past	year.	Based	on	recent	comments	by	industry	insiders,	the	condition
of	the	used	truck	market	is	not	likely	to	improve	anytime	soon.


For	example,	during	its	most	recent	earnings	call	on	October	20th,	CVTI's	management
team	stated	the	following	about	the	used	truck	market:


"…experts	started	saying,	you	know	what,	I	just	don't	think	this	thing	is	going	to	heal.
There	is	too	much	inventory…	this	thing	might	not	heal	for	2,	3,	4	years."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 20/24


Based	on	the	above	statements,	it	appears	that	industry	insiders	now	believe	the	used
truck	market	will	not	recover	for	another	2	to	4	years.	Current	expectations	of	a	multi-
year	slump	in	the	used	truck	market	led	CVTI	to	announce	on	October	13th	that	it	had
lowered	the	salvage	values	of	its	equipment:


"…for	the	third	quarter	of	2016...depreciation	increased	$4.6	million,	or	$0.15	per
diluted	share,	to	$19.3	million,	primarily	as	a	result	of	lowering	the	salvage	values
effectively	increasing	the	rate	of	depreciation	on	a	significant	percentage	of	our
tractors	due	to	the	expectation	that	the	soft	used	truck	market	could	continue	for	an
extended	period."


While	CVTI	has	recently	written	down	the	value	of	its	equipment,	CGI	has
inexplicably	done	the	exact	opposite.	In	Q2	2016,	CGI	increased	the	useful	life	of	its
tractors	by	33%	(from	3	years	to	4	years)	and	its	trailers	by	43%	(from	7	years	to	10
years).	In	addition	to	increasing	the	useful	life	of	its	equipment,	the	Company	also
increased	the	salvage	values	of	its	tractors	and	trailers	from	35%	-	58%	to	40%	-	60%.	In
total,	these	changes	lowered	CGI's	depreciation	expense	by	$7.0mm	in	FY	2016.


Management's	decision	to	increase	the	residual	value	of	its	equipment	makes	no	sense
given	the	expectations	of	a	prolonged	slump	in	the	used	truck	market.	So,	why	did
management	increase	the	residual	value	of	its	equipment	when	competitors	like	CVTI	are
taking	write-downs?	I	can	think	of	two	possible	explanations.	Either	(1)	management	is
highly	incompetent	or	(2)	management	made	this	change	in	order	to	inflate	its
profits	and	book	value.	I	believe	the	second	scenario	is	more	likely.	That	being	said,
either	way,	it	does	not	reflect	well	on	the	credibility	of	management.


Section	4:	CGI's	Reported	Book	Value	Is	Highly	Inflated


Some	investors	and	research	analysts	have	pointed	to	CGI's	book	value	as	evidence	that
its	shares	are	undervalued.	For	example,	on	August	31st,	Avondale	Partners	upgraded
CGI	to	a	Market	Outperform	rating	and	set	a	price	target	of	$11.30	per	share.	In	its	report,
Avondale	justified	its	lofty	price	target	by	stating	the	following:


"We	believe	profitable	carriers	are	at	minimum	worth	at	least	tangible	book	value	or
~$11.30/share."


Avondale	believes	CGI	should	trade	in-line	with	its	tangible	book	value	per	share.	As	of
Q3	2016,	it	calculated	that	CGI's	tangible	book	value	was	$11.30	per	share.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 21/24


Unfortunately,	I	believe	Avondale's	valuation	methodology	is	inherently	flawed	for	a
couple	reasons.	First,	it	has	not	written	down	any	of	the	$169.1mm	of	equipment	held	for
sale	and	$636.7mm	of	net	PP&E	on	the	Company's	balance	sheet.	As	I	discussed	in	the
previous	section,	given	the	severe	and	likely	prolonged	slump	in	the	used	truck	market,
CGI	will	likely	have	to	write	down	its	equipment	by	a	considerable	amount.


In	addition	to	this,	Avondale	has	also	not	taken	into	account	its	considerable	off-balance
sheet	liabilities	(i.e.	$59.8mm	of	operating	leases	at	PV	and	$74mm	of	reserve	account
liabilities).	These	are	real	liabilities	for	the	business	and	should	be	deducted	from	book
value.


When	write-downs	and	off-balance	liabilities	are	taken	into	account,	tangible	book	value
drops	by	a	considerable	amount.	Provided	in	the	table	below	is	my	calculation	of	the
Company's	adjusted	book	value	at	the	end	of	FY	2016:


In	the	above	table,	I	have	calculated	CGI's	adjusted	book	value	both	with	(left	column)	and
without	(right	column)	its	$74mm	reserve	account	liability.	I	felt	that	this	was	appropriate
given	the	ongoing	uncertainty	over	whether	the	Company	has	paid	off	its	reserve	liability.
In	regards	to	my	assumption	of	a	25%	write-down,	a	detailed	description	of	how	I	arrived
at	this	estimate	is	provided	in	the	Appendix.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 22/24


When	write-downs	and	off-balance	sheet	liabilities	are	properly	taken	into	account,	I
estimate	that	CGI's	tangible	book	value	per	share	is	between	($0.58)	and	$2.00.	This
is	significantly	lower	than	the	current	share	price	of	$6.61.	Thus,	from	my	adjusted	book
value	calculation,	I	believe	it	is	clear	that	Avondale's	use	of	reported	book	value	as	a
valuation	metric	is	very	misguided.


My	Interaction	with	the	Company


I	would	like	to	note	that	Bobby	Peavler,	the	CFO	of	CGI,	directly	sent	me	a	copy	of	the
response	letter	via	email	on	October	19th.	One	day	later	on	October	20th,	I	sent	Mr.
Peavler	a	follow-up	email	asking	for	further	clarification	on	CGI's	accounting	methods.	I
have	yet	to	receive	a	reply	from	him	or	anyone	at	the	Company.


Conclusion


Overall,	management's	response	letter	as	well	as	other	recent	developments	have	only
strengthened	my	conviction	in	my	short	thesis.	The	fact	that	management	cannot	provide
logical	answers	to	simple	questions	about	its	financial	reporting	methods	does	not	bode
well	for	shareholders.	Given	management's	track	record	of	highly	questionable	behavior,	I
do	not	believe	that	it	deserves	the	benefit	of	the	doubt.


Even	after	the	recent	sharp	decline	in	share	price,	I	believe	that	CGI	shares	remain
significantly	overvalued.	As	I	just	demonstrated,	after	properly	taking	into	account	off-
balance	sheet	liabilities	and	equipment	write-downs,	the	Company's	tangible	book	value	is
around	$2	or	less	per	share.	This	is	significantly	lower	than	the	current	share	price	of
$6.61.	Thus,	I	recommend	shorting	CGI	shares	or	selling	shares	if	you	are	an	existing
shareholder.


Appendix


My	assumption	of	a	25%	write-down	of	CGI's	equipment	held	for	sale	and	net	PP&E	is
based	on	a	couple	of	key	data	points.	First,	consider	the	following	comments	about	used
truck	prices	made	by	CVTI	management	during	its	most	recent	earnings	call:


"…we	felt	like	it	was	prudent	and	correct	to	look	at	all	of	our	trucks	in	our	fleet,	which
will	have	lives	all	the	way	up	3	and	4	years	now	and	look	at	what	we	are	selling	the
trucks	for."


"That	same	truck	that	was	selling	for	$15,000,	$16,000	less,	by	the	end	of
September,	it	was	really	selling	for	almost	$19,000,	$20,000	less	than	what	it	sold	for
previously	back	in	June	of	'15."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4017463-celadon-group-management-digs-deeper-hole 23/24


When	discussing	why	it	had	lowered	its	salvage	values,	CVTI	management	stated	that
prices	for	three	to	four-year-old	used	trucks	were	$19,000	to	$20,000	lower	than	what	they
were	in	June	2015.	With	this	in	mind,	consider	the	following	table	which	was	provided	in	a
March	2015	presentation	discussing	the	terms	of	the	Element	/	Quality	arrangement:


Given	that	this	presentation	was	created	in	March	2015,	three	to	four-year-old	trucks	at
the	time	were	from	the	2011	and	2012	model	year.	As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,
Element	was	purchasing	three	to	four-year-old	used	trucks	from	Quality	at	a	price	ranging
from	$68K	(three	years	old)	to	$80K	(four	years	old).


Putting	it	all	together,	based	on	CVTI's	comments	about	current	used	truck	prices	and	the
above	table,	my	calculation	of	CGI's	estimated	write-down	is	provided	below:


Disclosure:	I	am/we	are	short	CGI.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving
compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is
mentioned	in	this	article.
