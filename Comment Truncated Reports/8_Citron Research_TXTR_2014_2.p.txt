Citron Goes Deeper in Exposing the Dirty Dealings of TXTR CEO 
Patrick Allin.  There is NOTHING an analyst can say here except 


Mea Culpa.  
 


 Textura CEO Patrick Allin’s bio is Highly Material to All Potential and 
Actual Textura Investors 


 IPO Investment Bank Analysts are Pro-Actively Complicit  
 Company Expenses are Beyond Analysts Worst Nightmare, 
Profitability is Mission Impossible 


 Citron Reaffirms Generous $4 Target 
 


The US stock market is a market based on trust.  Companies make financial projections 
for the future and raise guidance and issue equity all based on trust.   Investors are 
supposed to be able to trust research firms that all analysis is based on a wall between 
banking and research and the analysis are done with best possible intentions.  When a 
company with a history of losses of 10 years goes public and the CEO sells as much stock 
in the secondary as the cumulative salary of every President of the United States back to 
Reagan and does it based on his “promise” of future earnings, than this CEO’s 
background and integrity should be of paramount importance to Wall St.  And when the 
research firms involved have undisclosed ownership of said companies, that negligence 
turns to collusion.  PLEASE SUE US SO WE CAN SEE IN COURT WHAT YOU REALLY KNEW 
ABOUT TEXTURA. 





    Patrick Allin’s Grants Stock to the REAL Wolf of Wall Street 
 
In a recent well-distributed article from the Huffington Post, as originally posted in LA 
WEEKLY, we read a truly sad tale of collateral damage at the hands of one of the real 
principal conspirators of Jordan Belfort’s “The Wolf of Wall Street” operation.  His name 
is Thomas Prousalis, and he was the chief legal architect of all the fraudulent reverse 
merger deals sold by Stratton Oakmont.  Apparently unhesitant to trash even his own 
family in the process, here’s how the Washington Post covered his works – in mid 2004.  
Needless to say he has also found himself in “federal housing”.  (Note: He was not 
discussed in our initial report.)   
 
Sure enough, during the time of Mr. Allin’s  tenure at Patron Systems, he issued 1.5 
million shares to Mr. Prousalis for “Legal Services”.

So adding Prousalis, that brings to three the number of named market participants in 
Patron Systems from Allin’s tenure that have gone to prison for stock fraud activities.

    Patrick Allin’s Long History of Overpromising and 
Underdelivering:  In Wall Street Language, that is Called “Lying” 
 


Analysts defended Textura as if we could trust Pat Allin and he had no knowledge of 
misdoings at Patron. Meanwhile, let’s look at the communications from Mr. Allin during 
his tenure at Patron Systems, immediately prior to his co-founding Textura, according to 
SEC filings.  Patron had years of Press Releases and 8-K events claiming future revenue, 
funding, and profitability that cost shareholders millions in broken promises.  
First, here are two examples of Patrick Allin bullshit, separated by over an 8 month span 
during his 16 month tenure at Patron Systems. 
 


 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075043/000095013703000386/c74246exv99w2.txt 





"The management team of Patron is committed to open communication with its 
shareholders and are pleased to confirm that the transactions with TrustWave and 
Entelagent are proceeding according to our strategy," … "With our committed group 
of private investors contributing up to $40 million in funding, we are in a position to 
not only close these transactions this quarter, but to pursue worldwide acquisitions 
and growth opportunities such as the wireless security agreement announced 
yesterday."

None of this Ever Consummated! 
 
 


    Don’t believe Citron -- Believe Patrick Allin’s Former Auditor 
About His Trustworthiness.   
 


Allin spent a solid 16 months as Patron’s puppet master, proclaiming false promise after 
false promise, before it “hits the fan”.  Finally, on Jan 26, 2004, Patron filed an 8-K 
containing a resignation letter from Patrick Allin, effective immediately.   
 
Grant Thornton’s resignation letter certainly suggests that Patrick Allin had 
systematically lied to them about numerous items.  In reality, during  that timespan, Mr. 
Allin was the company.   
 
Where is the track record of presenting truthful and accurate information to investors, 
regulators, auditors and the public?   Read Grant Thornton’s Resignation Statement:  





Patron Finalizes $50 to $100 Million in Funding 
 
Chicago – (Business Wire)   Sept. 29, 2003 -- Patron Systems, Inc. (OTCBB: PTRS) 
announces that it has finalized the terms of a $50 million private placement in stock. 
The terms of the agreement include: 
-- $15 million in common stock, at a price of $0.50 per share, or 30,000,000 shares, and 
-- $35 million in convertible preferred stock, with a 5% dividend and convertible into 
shares of common stock at a price of $0.50."

   Oh No!  Not the old “Bogus Address” trick… 
Note: one thing that really caught our attention was the official address of Patron 
Systems in a whole string of SEC filings.  (Note: this can only have been done before the 
days of real estate Google searches.) 





 
 
The Patron Systems address was nothing other than Mr. Allin’s home.  By use of a 
“Suite 150” he was trying to deceive investors into thinking this was a real business 
address.  Citron has decided “Suite 150” must have been his bathroom because the deal 
has nothing but shit all over it.

In its letter of resignation, Grant Thornton concluded based on background 
information related to the investor it had independently obtained and later had 
been brought to its attention by management through subsequent discussions, that 
this background information had not been brought to Grant Thornton's attention on 
a timely basis. In its resignation letter, Grant Thornton indicated that it believed a 
representation made by the Company that Hogan & Hartson LLP ("Hogan") had 
agreed to be re-engaged as the Company's legal counsel upon payment of 


outstanding fees was not factual based upon its on inquires made to Hogan. In 
addition, Grant Thornton also indicated that the Company had not been 
forthcoming with contact information requested from the Company for 
an official reference regarding the background of the investor. These factors, 
coupled with newly found information concerning the investor's background, and 
the fact that the funding had never occurred as promised by the investor, led Grant 


Thornton to conclude that it could no longer rely on Patron's 
representations and, as a result, Grant Thornton is unwilling to be 
associated with the financial statements prepared by Patron, and 
accordingly, advised us that Grant Thornton was withdrawing its 
audit reports and those audit reports could no longer be relied upon.

   Even more Fraudulent Disclosures with the SEC on 
Behalf of Allin   
 


The Textura filings not only fail to disclose Allin’s leadership role with Patron Systems, 
they also fail to mention his work at Encore Development.  In Patron Systems Proxy 
Statement we read:  





 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075043/000095013703001139/c75014prem14c.txt 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075043/000095013703001335/c75246ddefm14c.txt 





Now let’s compare Mr. Allin’s purported “accomplishment” while at Encore to his quote 
below.  See if you can spot a familiar pattern:   
 





Not only has Patrick Allin lied to the SEC about the profitability of Encore in his bio, but 
more importantly he makes bold claims to the media about the potential financials of 
his own then-current company.  Consider the last line:  “plans to go public”.  As we 
stated in our first report, it seems like Mr. Allin likes the business of being public – this 
has been his goal all along -- and he seems disinclined to let the truth stand in his way.  


Founded five years ago by brothers Tom and Bob Leonard, Encore has 170 employees, 
with headquarters in Jacksonville and offices in Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Chicago and 
New York. The company expects to open overseas offices next year. Clients include 
UPS, Southeast Toyota and CSX railroad. Last year, Encore had revenues of $7.5 
million. It projects to reach about $17 million this year and $150 million by 2002. 


Pat Allin, the former global chief operating officer of PricewaterhouseCooper's 
management-consulting business who was hired as Encore's chief executive officer, 
says it's likely that within five years Encore will be a $500-million to $1-billion 


company with 2,500 to 5,000 employees. The company plans to go public 
within the next year.

Needless to say nothing of the sort became of Encore; Citron cannot even validate that 
it is even still in business.  And the cherry on top of this Wolf is this ridiculous claim 
that is consistently placed in Patron System filings on Allin (claims that are omitted 
from Textura filings) :

Really?  Too many to name them or even count them?  Where are they?  Is he Meg 
Whitman in disguise?  He signed off on this nonsense all before the word “Google” was 
a part of our vernacular.  This demonstrates the absence of integrity at Textura’s helm. 
 
It is abundantly clear that Allin was an active perpetrator in the Patron Systems promo, 
and just as clear that after it blew up, he did nothing to make himself accountable to 
investors or the public.   
 


   Analyst Defense #1: William Blair “Believes” we should trust 
them 
 


In response to our first piece, William Blair published a defense piece of Mr. Allin that is 
factually incorrect and nothing short of fraudulent.  Don’t forget the context of their 
comments:  William Blair principals have incestuously conflicted and improperly 
disclosed relationships with Textura.  Consider the defense of William Blair, who states 
that Mr. Allin was nothing more than an honest CEO of a startup company, who was 
nothing but forthright with investors.  








Over the course of a year, during which the stock (PTRN) continued to decline, the 
company announced several potential mergers, partnerships, and acquisitions 
(including Entelagent Software, Trustwave, and Telesecure) and the entry to a 
potential term sheet with investors. The funding did not come together and Mr. Allin 


resigned effective January 21, 2004. We do not believe that Mr. Allin knew of the 
history of the CPFS before the merger with Patron.

Link to William Blair defense piece 
 
So if we are to take William Blair’s words as guidance, this was not a fraud but instead 
just one big oops, which Mr. Allin tried valiantly to clean up before he left. Yet, it is 
important to note that there is no excuse even given for CEO Allin’s complete omission 
to disclose Patron Systems in Textura’s registration filings, which is clearly intent to 
deceive.  It is missing from his bio, and his actions in the two years immediately prior to 
his co-founding Textura remain officially unaccounted for.   
 
Note that this omission occurs in the very filings by which Mr. Allin personally sells $8.75 
million in Textura stock.  
 


   Analyst Defense II:  Credit Suisse:  Ethically and 
Intellectually Bankrupt  
 


 
http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/12/30/textura-rising-citron-note-completely-without-

Citron strongly recommends that every investor, whether or not in agreement with the 
opinions of Citron, regarding Textura or any other stock, consider this statement 
carefully.  It asserts that information derived from public sources available to anyone 
especially using Google or any other search tool, is irrelevant to investment decisions 
and should be disregarded.  
 


So what does that leave?  Getting insider information from management?  What exactly 
is wrong with information that’s available on the internet?  What publicly available 
information about a company on which to base investment decisions isn’t on the 
internet?  Should we now disregard SEC filings because they are on the internet – you 
friggin’ moron.  
 
This is truly an appalling example of intellectual bankruptcy – if Citron could find this 
information, why did Textura’s fine underwriting firms, which clearly have legions 


more staff and research resources than Citron, manage to fail to get this 
information into the company’s IPO or follow-on prospectuses? 


“We base our opinion on our own research, performed over the last few days, as 
much of the innuendo that suggests impropriety is based on publicly available 
information that anyone can find using Google," Nemeoff writes.

Now as a co-bookrunner for Textura’s stock sales, we would hardly expect CSFB to be 
objective or to admit, heaven forbid, that Textura might have some issues as an 
investment-grade security.

And the underwriters’ failure to include any reference to Patron Systems in Patrick 
Allin’s bio in IPO and follow-on prospectus, in which your firms are legally bound to full 
disclosure of all material information, is not intentionally misleading?  According to 
CSFB, the public has no right to know this information to support making informed 
investment decisions?   
 


Citron has been publishing for 13 years, covering over 50 stocks during that span that 
have been subject to regulatory intervention that devastated shareholder equity.  Our 
complete track record, including the winners and the losers, is available at our website, 
and is a lot more transparent than Credit Suisse’s.

Credit Suisse attempted to discredit our research because of our use of loose language.

( Wed Dec 18, 2013 ) 


 
So let’s get this straight:  You object to Citron’s use of the word “bullshit”, 
but your firm has no problem “allegedly” fucking investors out of $10 
billion… ?    
  


“After thoroughly reviewing the profanity-laced report, we see no merits to any of 
the ‘work’ and advise investors to continue to purchase shares of TXTR. We believe 
the report alluded to incorrect innuendo and false assumptions that suggest TXTR 
management misled investors, which we believe to be untrue.”

   Analyst Defense III:  Barrington’s “Best Idea”  
 
Completing the analyst defense trifecta, Barrington weighed in yesterday, anointing 
Textura as one of its “Best Ideas List” for 2014.  
 
In their research we read "Before Textura, solutions were mostly manual paper-based, 
and inefficient." Either this analyst is ignorant or negligent, and we believe that latter 
(although he also recommended Angie’s List).   
 
Construction services software is a multi-billion industry with a variety of players – and 
Textura is not even one of them.   Here is a 2014 list of Construction management 
software solutions and look who does not even make the list.   
http://www.softwareadvice.com/market_category_page.php?industry_id=1&guide_id=
0&more=true&segment_id=0&size_id= 
 
Clearly, the Barrington analyst has never even heard of Oracle.   
 
Needless to say Barrington also had a member who was a selling shareholder on the 
secondary.     
 


Someone please sue us so we can expose this collusion in court.

   Meanwhile, the Analysts Reaffirm Despite a 
Disastrous Trajectory of Above-Plan Expenses and Losses 
 
Citron is just amazed to see the operating results of Textura’s fiscal year 2013 posted.  
The analysts had already conditioned the investing public to expect marginal losses of 
about 50%, but the expenses ballooned far worse than even that.  In fact, Textura’s 
fiscal year brought losses in excess of 100% of revenues.   And none of these clowns 
has even bothered to revise their model!  
 
Let’s make clear how bad this is.  The company’s expense spending for 2013 is now at 
the levels the analysts expected them to spend, not in 2014, but in 2015.  (2015 is the 
first year the analysts promise the company will break into the promised land of 
profitability.)  So to stop losing investor money, they would have to grow their 
revenue to 246% of 2013 revenue levels, while not increasing any expenses.  Really?  
Really?   
 
They “made revenue” of $35.5 million, OK, but look what they did to expenses!  The 
company booked 39.6 million in losses on 35.5 million in revenue: 
  


FY 2013 Blair Credit 
Suisse 


Actuals Beyond

Model

Credit

Revenues 35.5 35.5 35.5 
  


      Costs 
     Cost of Revenue 7.8 8.5 11.8 51.28% 38.82% 


G&A 16.4 18.4 23.5 43.29% 27.72% 


Sales and Mktg 10.1 10.5 12.7 25.74% 20.95% 


Tech and Dev 14.0 14.8 18.1 29.29% 22.30% 


Depreciation and Amort 4.6 4.5 4.5 -2.17% 0.00% 


Totals 52.9 45.3 70.6 33.46% 55.85% 


 
Now the IPO was just in June, and these costs don’t even include the explicitly booked 
one-time expenses related to the company’s IPO.  Meanwhile, not a single word from 
the analysts on the trajectory that proves that even in 2015, Textura’s spending is far 
too high, and generating losses far too steep, to make it to breakeven.
Citron Research Follow Up on Textura Corp.        January 7, 2014 Page 11 of 13 
 


   Why the “Client-reported construction value added” 
Number is Just Noise  
 
Benchmarking against the value of “Client-reported construction value added” is highly 
misleading.  For a real-life example, consider Textura’s announcement on December 10, 
2013 that Ryder, a large construction management firm, had adopted CPM for 
payments, integrating it with SAGE’s Timberline (Ryder’s enterprise software solution). 
http://www.texturacorp.com/news-events/Ryder%20Construction%20NR%20Draft%20V2a%20-%20CLIENT%20APPROVED.pdf 


 
As usual with Textura’s hype-laced announcements, what they don’t say is pivotal for 
investors to understand.  Here’s why: 
 


 
The big but meaningless topline number is “client-reported construction value”, but 


no guarantee of implementation down to the actual subs who do the work. 
 
On big construction projects, a construction manager such as Ryder, hires master 
subcontractors with major chunks of supervisory responsibility for the project at hand.  
The master sub typically hires specialty subcontractors who perform the actual detailed 
work, installing light fixtures, door locks, heating ducts, etc.  
 
So when a company like Ryder adopts CPM-Enterprise, it can impose the CPM solution 
on its relationships with the master subcontractors, but that doesn’t mean that it gets 
used for the vast number of contractor relationships down the project’s food chain.

This exact scenario lets Textura claim the entire project construction value is “on its 
system”, but obviously the number of revenue-generating participants is far less than 
implied.  For this reason alone, the data point on “construction value as reported by our 
clients” is meaningless at best, and probably misleading.   Just a handful of 
implementations like this, for the “top of the pyramid” high-end construction managers, 
skews all the “construction value” statistics into total meaninglessness.   
 
 
 
 





Certainly the analysts noise and Patrick Allin’s past misconduct are disturbing, but 
investors could overlook all that if the real Textura was in fact a rapidly growing SaaS 
outfit, gobbling up substantial market share in a huge addressable market, by offering 
an integrated suite of software poised to rapidly that market at very low cost of sales. 
 
But the current company is the opposite of a real SAAS company:  It offers only one 
narrow solution (CPS, the lien waiver / payment solution), plus a hodgepodge of small 
software acquisitions that don’t integrate well, if at all.    
 
Wall Street is all too willing to provide certain companies mountains of the public’s 
money to burn, in a losing strategy of hiring telesales sales teams to drive tiny 
revenues to large, unsustainable percentage increases … temporarily.   
 
This only works while Wall Street is willing to pay insane multiples like 25x revenues for 
companies that aren’t real SaaS companies.  Similarly, Citron had success in 2013 
explaining why Angie’s List was not a social networking company. 
 
To justify a lofty SaaS valuation, a software company should at the very least be able to 
demonstrate and document convincingly: 
 
 Organically generated revenue growth – aside from acquisitions  
 Low cost / low friction customer acquisition -- without dependence on telesales 
 Extremely high retention rates 
 Rapid integration of acquired technologies 
 Rapid adoption of acquired technologies by existing installed base  
 Low-friction sales cycle  
 Ultra-high customer value delivery

10 Reasons why Textura is only a pretender in the SaaS space: 
 


 Company paid for referrals with stock – non-arms-length revenue from related-
party is undisclosed  


 Organic growth is undisclosed and impossible to determine from financials 
 False/misleading statistics on market penetration:  “55 billion in construction 


value on its system” (see above section) for a company with just $35 million in 
revenues 


 Headcount rising faster than revenues 
 Direct expenses rising faster than revenues 
 Dependent on expanding telesales force to drive revenues 
 Long and difficult sales cycle 
 Contractors are a notoriously difficult market to sell technology solutions into 
 Poor track record of integrating acquired software product into a seamless 


platform 
o (Even “partial integration” of Gradebeam took more than 2 years; even 


Textura’s largest CPM customer doesn’t even use Gradebeam)  
 Company does not disclose real metrics on customer / subscriber retention 


 
The game of acquiring disparate software products for 3x sales while selling stock at 25x 
revenues is simply not sustainable, especially in light of Textura’s poor track record of 
integrating the software of companies it has already acquired. 
 
Market multiples for “gold-standard” software providers in the construction industry is 
3.2 x Sales.  Assuming Textura can legitimately grow its way into profitability (an 
assumption which would first require reversing its ten-year tsunami of red ink) still puts 
the stock in single digits.   





     Conclusion 
Any honest analysis of the Textura results to date – both in terms of its actual 
technology’s impact on the construction industry, and its financial results, points to the 
same inescapable conclusion:  Textura is unable to ever grow into even a fraction of its 
current valuation.   
 
Note to Long Term Investors:  You have been taken.  This company will never show a 
profit and management will continue to deceive the public.  This is “The Wolf Of Wall 
Street” Meets “American Hustle” Meets “The Sting”.  But Pat Allin isn’t as good looking 
as DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, or Paul Newman -- if he were, he might try to kiss you 
before he F%&$ You. 
 


Allin is a Wolf:  Are you his sheep?  $4 price target reaffirmed.   
 


     Cautious Investing to All.
