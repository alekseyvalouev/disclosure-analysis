LDK to Supply Polysilicon to


One of Its Polysilicon


Suppliers?


LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK) continues to impress


investors with unbelievable production expectations. On


December 10, LDK announced a new agreement with Q-Cells


AG promising to provide the German company with as much


as 43,000 tons of polysilicon over 10 years.


LDK has no polysilicon production capacity. LDK has never


produced polysilicon or any other chemical product.


Polysilicon has been produced in commercial quantities


since the 1950s.


Q-Cells AG con�rmed the contract in a press statement of its


own, claiming that “LDK shall supply the silicon from their


current polysilicon plant being constructed or from volumes


which will be covered by LDK’s other supply sources.”


These “other supply sources” include LDK’s customers. Q-


Cells is one of LDK’s polysilicon suppliers.


It is also di�cult to understand what Q-Cells means by


“current polysilicon plant.” LDK recently announced that it


had �nished clearing the ground for its new plant, but so far


no plant has been built. This minor detail does not prevent


LDK from issuing wild predictions about future production

capacities. LDK expects to start and complete construction


so quickly that it will be able to produce “6,000 metric tons of


polysilicon by the fourth quarter of 2008.”


To put LDK’s remarkable expectations into perspective, in


2006, MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc., a 50-year-old


producer of polysilicon with two existing plants, plans to


increase its polysilicon capacity from 4,000 metric tons per


year to 8,000 metric tons over a two-year period.


Should LDK’s new plant produce 6,000 metric tons of


polysilicon by the fourth quarter of 2008, LDK will suddenly


metamorphose into one of the largest producers of


polysilicon in the world. Not bad for a company that claimed


the majority of its “polysilicon feedstock came from scraps


and recyclable polysilicon” only 6 months ago.
