Blowing The Whistle On Cyberonics
Jan. 23, 2013 3:01 PM ET30 comments

Introduction


We are Infitialis, a research collective that systematically exposes fraud and folly in
financial markets. Since August 2012, we have published ten meticulously researched
exposés on companies that we believed had engaged in unscrupulous behavior or
exhibited unsustainable market valuations. Below you will find our track record disclosing
each of our exposes, the date of publication, and the subsequent price action following the
publication of our research.


Each and every one of our reports has contributed to a profit with an average decline of
71% from the time of publication. Today, we present our highest conviction exposé yet
highlighting folly in the form of a significant valuation bubble. More importantly, we present
with the help of a whistleblower - very serious allegations of unscrupulous and
potentially fraudulent activity on the part NASDAQ listed: Cyberonics, Inc.
("Cyberonics" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: CYBX). These detailed allegations have
been documented in an amended complaint filed by the whistleblower in
Massachusetts Federal Court just five days ago on January 16, 2013.


This is the first time these allegations and this lawsuit are being disclosed to the
investing public as the Company failed to so even as the original complaint was filed on
August 8, 2012 well within the disclosure period of the last 10Q.


CYBX: Our Highest Conviction and Most Asymmetric Expose Yet


In this report, we present the culmination of nearly two months of research into
Cyberonics, Inc. which resulted in our belief that the Company will never grow into its
current $1.5 billion valuation in the Bull case and may decline by 80% in the Bear case

should any of the allegations in the whistleblower suit be proven in federal court.


We will start by objectively reviewing the science behind the CYBX device in an effort to
understand whether the device actually works or is simply being marketed by the
Company as the end all treatment for various medical conditions.


Next, we will provide an analysis on the effectiveness of the treatment for depression (a
new frontier the Company has been touting for years). This analysis is important as the
analyst community is currently relying on growth in the depression market to rationalize a
mathematically irreconcilable share valuation.


Finally, we will unveil the very serious whistleblower allegations which we believe reveal
the missing piece in the puzzle of the CYBX business model: Cyberonics management
team incentivizes its sales organization to engage in unscrupulous and potentially deadly
behavior all in an effort to juice its top line revenue while insiders sell unprecedented
amount of stock into the market.


We will end the report with three valuation assumptions for : Bull, Base, and Bear that
incorporate all the qualitative and quantitative data in this report.


Company Description


Cyberonics, Inc. is a Houston, Texas based firm that is engaged in the design,
development, and marketing of an implantable medical device that stimulates the vagus
nerve. It is with this device that the firm markets a therapy for the treatment of refractory
epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The treatment is aptly named
"Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy" and is trademarked by the firm.


The VNS Therapy System consists of the implantable VNS Therapy Pulse Generator, the
VNS Therapy Lead and the external programming system used to change stimulation
settings. The lead and the pulse generator make up the implantable portion of the VNS
Therapy System. Once implanted the device continually sends an electrical pulse up a
wire into the vagus nerve in the neck at the base of the brain. The pulses usually last thirty
seconds and occur every three to five minutes.

Valuation is a Bubble, Even With Whistleblower Allegations Aside


Before we get into any of the serious allegations brought on by the Whistleblower, we are
going to make the case that isn't worth anywhere near $54 a share. In our view, the
analysis leading up to the whistleblower revelations highlights the current asymmetry to
the downside in the valuation of Cyberonics.

and 30x earnings respectively. When comparing to peers such as Medtronic (NYSE:MDT)
and St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) which trade at an average multiple of 12x (CYBX)
trades at a premium of over 240%. Adding insult to injury, quarterly revenues total in the
millions while and quarterly revenues total in the billions.


PART I - Overview of Science behind CYBX Device The Science behind Vagus Nerve
Stimulation (VNS) Is Inconclusive At Best In Our View


The science underlying the CYBX device is based on the hypothesis that stimulating the
brain via the vagus nerve with electric pulses from a battery will prevent or reduce
epileptic seizures and even depression. After spending nearly two months speaking with

VNS experts, we were genuinely surprised that nobody had been able to explain how
this all worked and whether it even did.


The more we dug the more we found red flags and skepticism in the scientific community
as to the efficacy of VNS. Below are 11 well researched papers that discuss VNS and
were sourced from academia, government, and private enterprise:

"Studies have yielded inconclusive results regarding short and

Following the plethora of skepticism we uncovered above we decided to study the actual
FDA clinical trials that led to the approval of VNS as a viable treatment in humans. Our
goal was to understand what the FDA was thinking when approving the device and
whether was accurately representing the efficacy of the treatment to its patients and the
investment community.


What we found was troubling. The efficacy of VNS therapy as measured scientifically in
randomized trials was very weak and its approval as a treatment was met with unusual
controversy. What we discovered on our own (no thanks to CYBX investor marketing
material) was that VNS Treatment approval was limited only to the rarest cases of
epilepsy (Refractory Epilepsy) and depression (Treatment Resistant Depression)
representing a much smaller market opportunity than what the Company and Wall Street
analysts tout.


FDA Clinical Trials For Epilepsy Confirm Limited Efficacy


Two multi-center, double blind, randomized trials (EO3 & EO5) evaluated the efficacy of
VNS in refractory partial epilepsy, all patients were implanted with the device, and then
randomized to high intensity or low-intensity treatment arms. The primary endpoint was
change in seizure frequency after 12 weeks. The secondary endpoint was the percentage
of patients who experienced a 50% reduction in seizure frequency, the "responder rate," a
commonly used yardstick in epilepsy trials.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 6/36


Both studies demonstrated statistically significant differences in efficacy between the high-
and low intensity treatment arms. In EO3 (114 patients), the mean reduction in seizure
frequency was 24.5% for the high-intensity group vs. 6.1% for the low-intensity group. The
responder rate for the high-intensity group was 31%. In EO5 (196 patients), the high-
intensity arm had a mean seizure reduction of 28% vs. 15% for the low-intensity arm.


Averaging out the two studies, we see that EO3 and EO5 studies demonstrated 23-31% of
patients had >50% reduction in seizure number. Put differently, 70% of all patients
experienced no change at all with only a quarter of the patients (75 out of 310 patients in
the study) still having experienced a seizure but claiming that the seizure was about half
as strong as what they remembered the seizures being prior to being surgically implanted
with an electronic stimulator that shocked their brain for thirty seconds every three
minutes. Needless to say, we are not talking about earth shattering science here which
explains why the scientific community is so skeptical when it comes to VNS.


It's important to note that these already weak results were produced on the rarest subset
of the epilepsy population (refractory epilepsy) which affects a total of 250,000 people as
opposed to the general epilepsy population which is numbered in the millions and which
the Company and Wall Street analysts tout as their target market in their regulatory filings.


We wonder why CYBX does not disclose the true size of its target market? Could it be that
when applying the actual efficacy statistics on the true target population (25% x 250,000)
we are left with only 62,500 potential patients who would actually benefit from the
treatment based on the Company's own clinical trials? The Company currently has the
VNS device installed in over 70,000 patients who might explain why have found dozens
upon dozens of VNS patients complaining about lack of improvement and desire to
remove the device from their body. This would also explain the rationale behind the
allegations made by the Whistleblower and which we will expand on later in the report.


FDA Trials for Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) Scientifically Inconclusive


We were even more disappointed when we learned of the TRD results. Quoting from
award winning mental health journalist John Mcmanamy's view of the trials and
subsequent FDA approval:



http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1185635-overview

http://www.vnsmessageboard.com/index.php?topic=4110.0

http://www.vnsmessageboard.com/index.php?topic=4110.0

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 7/36


In 2001, Cyberonics enlisted 235 patients in a 12-week double-blind clinical trial (in
which half of the devices were switched on and the other half left off), along with
their current meds. Subjects had failed at least two and up to six different types of
antidepressant treatments in their current episodes, had been in their current
depression two or more years or had experienced recurring depression four or more
times, with Hamilton depression scores of at least 20.


Said Cyberonics CEO Skip Cummins on a June 2004 conference call: "These were
hopeless, desperate, suicidal patients, not expected to respond."


Unfortunately, the patients lived up to expectations. Trial results in early 2002
turned out to be a major disappointment, delaying indefinitely what had been
considered imminent FDA approval (which had been granted fast track review).
Undaunted, Cyberonics continued with the study with 205 patients, this time
switching on all the devices. At the same time, the company enrolled 124 similarly
depressed patients for treatment as usual without VNS. After 12 months, response
rates for the VNS group on two different depression scales were 21 percent and 30
percent, respectively vs. 12 and 13 percent in the treatment as usual group.
Remission rates were 16 and 17 percent for the VNS group vs. five and seven
percent for those on treatment as usual.


Ordinarily, a study with this design and these results never would have made
it past the FDA door man. Two randomized double-blind controlled studies with at
least a 50 percent response is generally what it takes to get a panel to review a
manufacturer's submission. This was but a single open trial, effectively comparing
apples to oranges, with a mere 30 percent success rate (or putting it another way, a
70 percent failure rate), and the statistician and others on the panel reacted to the
data in a matter akin to the membership committee at the Augusta National Country
Club hearing of someone with a skirt on the premises.


Clearly this was not a normal FDA approval process as will be evidenced in our next
section and the section entitled "Red Flags with CYBX Marketing to Patients".
Nevertheless the Company continues to tout its VNS treatment as a legitimate
therapy for depression. Even worst is the fact that Wall Street analysts have been
touting CYBX as an entrant to the field while being completely oblivious to how
inconclusive the science is.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 8/36


Thus, it is our belief that VNS will never be viewed as a legitimate treatment for
depression as the scientific data has proven its lack of efficacy. This is yet another
argument in favor of the asymmetry to the downside in the valuation of as most market
participants believe the company is about to embark on this new frontier and have already
factored that prediction into the valuation.


Weak Results Mean FDA Approves VNS Treatment For ONLY Rarest Cases of
Epilepsy and Depression Known As Treatment Resistant Depression and Refractory
Epilepsy


At the end of the day what CYBX shrewdly pursued and subsequently obtained approval
for was the ability to offer this esoteric treatment to the smallest and rarest cases of what
are two of the most well known disorders.


Herein lies the crux of what actually is. Contrary to the way in which the Company
presents itself to investors, CYBX devices are not approved by the FDA for the treatment
of depression or epilepsy. Rather, CYBX devices are approved only for the rarest cases of
untreatable epilepsy known as "refractory epilepsy" or the rarest cases of depression
known as "Treatment Resistant Depression" or "TRD.


From a business perspective this represents a huge difference as we have demonstrated
with epilepsy (250k refractory population vs. 2-3 million with general epilepsy).


We believe that CYBX purposely excludes these terms from its marketing material in order
to confuse the investing public. When using the words "FDA Approved" and "Depression"
or "Epilepsy" (as we will prove the Company consistently does when presenting to
investors) the majority fail to grasp that the Company is only approved to treat the rarest,
untreatable, forms of those disorders.


Put differently, when every other FDA approved treatment fails for depression or epilepsy,
only then should patients begin to entertain the idea of implanting a VNS device.
Unfortunately as CYBX's own FDA trials confirmed even for that tiny segment of the
overall population the device will only be effective on roughly 25%. And in this case the
word "effective" is highly subjective as it means they will continue to have seizures that will
feel about half as strong post implantation of an electronic device that "stimulates" their
brain every three minutes.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 9/36


In our view, slide #5 from the most recent CYBX investor presentation


is troubling and in direct violation of securities laws. The same


descriptions can be found in the most recent 10K filed with the SEC.


Note the way in which the Company describes itself using the umbrella


terms "Epilepsy" and "Depression" to describe the target market for its


VNS Therapy.


The Company should be explicitly stating that the VNS Treatment has


been only approved for "Refractory Epilepsy" and "Treatment Resistant


Depression".


What is apparent to us is that a majority of investors in CYBX are unaware that the target
markets for VNS are a very small subset of the overall epilepsy and depression
populations.


Actual Patient Testimonials Highlight Additional Red Flags


At this stage of our investigation we began to uncover dozens of patients that were
disappointed with the VNS treatment and attempted to remove the device from their body.
This revelation led to our internalization of a thesis that from a scientifically proved efficacy
perspective CYBX had already reached every potential person in the US that it could
impact. This is again based on the results of efficacy from the clinical trial multiplied by
the actual target market. Our readers may remember that we completed a similar analysis
on (NASDAQ:MLNX) when we published our exposé in September 2012.

By way of background, last November I had my pulse generator and a portion of the
lead removed (it was originally put in for treatment resistant depression). It was
partially removed because (1) the device didn't help; and (2) one of the plastic
clamps holding the lead in place was protruding out from my neck and was
about to rupture. Ever since the surgery I have experienced plugged ears and
constant and painful headaches. None of the doctors had any idea why this was
happening so we thought there might be an off chance that the remaining part of the
device still implanted was the cause.


So this past June I made the decision to have the remainder of my VNS device
(i.e. the coil wrapped around the nerve and a portion of the lead) removed.
After the surgery, the surgeon told me it was a complete success--that there hadn't
been any complications and that the nerve was completely intact. Despite this, my
voice is a raspy whisper (the doctor did warn that there was a 5% chance of
this happening). I have now had two EMG tests and both have determined that my
left vocal cord is paralyzed--meaning there is no nerve communication with the left
vocal fold. However, it seemed like the risk of voice loss would only happen if the
vagus nerve was severed or cut during the operation. But my surgeon specifically
said this didn't happen. So I guess my question is: why do I not have a voice


But I would have to say that the worst part of all this is not the voice loss but the fact
my headaches are still there and are getting worse. They are constant, painful and
make normal activities difficult and unenjoyable--and getting rid of them was the only
reason I had the remainder of the device removed in the first place.

Patient #2 Nancy B.


Hi Carol! I'm here for the exact same reason that you are. Although I have epilepsy, I
never got the vns device, my younger sister did, and it almost killed her. She had
hers implanted in 2008 and although it has been taken out she is still suffering
from the side effects. She, unfortunately, developed a psychosis after the implant
and had to spend almost a year in a psychiatric hospital because none of her
doctors believed that it was caused by the device. We have no history of
psychosis in our family and she was a registered nurse before the implant, so I think
if she was psychotic beforehand someone at the hospital would have noticed.

Patient #3 Dennis


As of 9/30/08 there have been a total of 8442 adverse events reported to the FDA
dealing with the VNS. That sure seems like an awful lot of reports when you
consider that there are approx 40,000 implants worldwide. Keep in mind that a
large number of events go unreported.


I found some interesting information while searching the MAUDE reports. What
stands out most is the number of unexplained deaths. Out of the 763 reported
deaths, 254 list the cause as "Unknown" and there are 73 listed as "SUDEP". That's
327 deaths without a decent explanation. It doesn't take an Einstein to realize that
something ain't right with that picture. How can the FDA be letting this go on? I
was nearly killed by the damn thing. I wonder if my death would have been listed
as "Unknown" or "SUDEP"


Source: VNS Patient Board


These are only a few of the examples we have encountered. We cannot think of another
FDA approved device that has had so many negative reviews by its patients. We suggest
readers don't just take our word for it and review these postings for themselves. A simple
Google search for "how to remove VNS" will produce dozens of more entries by
disappointed patients who were duped into getting the device surgically implanted under
the belief that it could be easily removed.


After reading several of these entries we began to wonder whether this VNS device is
much more dangerous than being marketed by CYBX and we were surprised to uncover
the following information.


VNS Device Linked To More Than 900 Deaths


As part of our research into the VNS Device, we discovered this investigative article from
the British Medical Journal written by Jeanne Lenzer and Shannon Brownlee. The piece
entitled "Medical Devices That Can Kill" went on to document that over 900 deaths had
been linked to the VNS device representing a relatively high nominal mortality rate given
the device was only implanted in roughly 50,000 patients at the time.


The piece went on to make some serious accusations about CYBX, such as:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 12/36


"Although Cyberonics conducted post-approval studies, none of the studies
submitted to the FDA included mortality data. The FDA did not specifically
require Cyberonics to submit mortality data as part of the follow-up study, merely to
'characterize morbidity and mortality"


As a follow-up to this 2008 article, we searched the FDA s MAUDE database for
"manufacturer: Cyberonics" and selected "Death" from the drop-down menu and found
1,296 reported incidents of death associated with the VNS device as of 01/18/13 with 13
deaths in December 2012.


At this stage it should be apparent that VNS treatment carries serious potential risks to
patients. This is yet another point that we believe has been completely ignored by market
participants that have irresponsibly bid up the valuation to 41x last year's net income. This
is especially true when considering that the majority of implants occurred in the last two
years meaning that any potential backlash by patients as a class would only become a
relevant event in the future.


Aside from patient complaints and independent investigative reports, we found yet another
red flag that pertained to the marketing of the VNS device by Cyberonics. As part of this
discovery, we also came across CYBX's staunchest critic: Consumer Advocacy Group
Public Citizen, who actually petitioned the FDA to revoke approval of VNS Treatment
and called the treatment "A Cruel Hoax".


VNS Treatment A "Cruel Hoax"


The more we dug into CYBX's past, the more disappointed we were as to how many red
flags were buried in this Company's past. In September 2006 the consumer advocacy
Public Citizen in what was an unusual step sent a 24 page letter to the FDA petitioning for
the immediate revocation of VNS Treatment for TRD.


The key takeaways from the letter were that the FDA in approving VNS for TRD overruled
more than 20 FDA officials who had reviewed the data and recommended against FDA
approval. Quoting from the letter:



http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 13/36


"The facts and circumstances...raise legitimate questions about the FDA's
decision to approve that device for treatment of TRD."


"Instead of relying on comprehensive scientific evaluation of its scientists and
medical officers, it appears that the FDA lowered its threshold for evidence of
effectiveness"


These are very serious allegations brought on by one of the most reputable consumer
advocacy groups in the United States. The letter goes on to disqualify VNS as a valid
scientific treatment. Below find another paragraph from the letter which we recommend be
read in its entirety:


Given these highly irregular aspects of the approval process at the FDA, it is
appropriate that the FDA revisit its ill-advised decision to approve VNS for TRD. To
have an ineffective device on the market (and an expensive, surgically implanted
one at that) does no favors for those suffering from TRD. To allow the continued
marketing of this device is to perpetrate a cruel hoax on those patients.


Quoting from this article written by the Examiner which covered the Public Citizen saga we
see that even FDA staff described Cyberonics behavior as "abusive":


Cyberonics was so aggressive in promoting vagus nerve stimulation that FDA staff
described their behavior as "abusive"; at one point, Cyberonics told the FDA that
withholding approvalcould leave patients feeling like they had no option but suicide.
The campaign included, according to Public Citizen, a "full-court press of misleading
advertising, training sessions in its use for physicians, presentations at the American
Psychiatric Association annual meeting, case managers to help secure
reimbursement for individual patients, abuse of FDA employees, misleading clinical
trial write-ups, ghost-written review articles and company-generated favorable local
media coverage."It was a superior sales pitch for an entirely unproven device.
Unfortunately, many people still believe it."


At this stage of our research we are beginning to see overwhelming evidence that VNS is
not only inconclusive as a treatment option but that its entire route to market was filled
with provocative events and met with significant resistance.. For further reading we also
recommend this article which goes on to describe the VNS advertisement as misleading.

Based on the evidence we have presented in this section we believe the science
underlying VNS is at best inconclusive. One of us has a background in psychology and we
can't help but think of the analogies to a placebo (sugar pill) as the effects of a constant
barrage of electric shocks to the brain (30 seconds long and every 3 minutes) are so
difficult to gauge. Clearly VNS is no stent or pacemaker as evidenced by the lack of
efficacy but also the difficulty in explaining exactly how it works. On that note we are
reminded of one of our favorite quotes by Albert Einstein:


"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself."


As we conclude Part I investors should be questioning whether CYBX is even viable as a
business given the shaky science its one trick pony device is based on and the plethora of
red flags we highlighted.


In the next section of the report, we will delve into the business model of CYBX and
quantify why we believe that under no circumstance will the Company ever grow into its
current valuation of $1.5 Billion.


Again it is important to remember that our efforts in Part I and Part II of this report are
solely for the purpose of highlighting the asymmetry to the downside of this idea. Should
the allegations in the whistleblower lawsuit we will be unveiling in Part III be proven as
true then the entire company may be sued into oblivion.


PART II: CYBX The Business


CYBX employs a relatively simple business model. The Company acquired the intellectual
property associated with the VNS treatment from its founder, Mr. Jacob Zabara, for a 3%
annual royalty fee and produces the devices in its relatively "low tech" manufacturing
facility in Houston Texas. The device costs just under $2,000 per unit to produce and is
sold to patients for between $10,000-$15,000. This explains how CYBX is able to report
90%+ gross margins.


As far as we are concerned the crux of the business model is the direct sales organization
which is compensated in a manner that is highly dependent on meeting sales goals. Our
research uncovered a sales organization populated by individuals with little to no
experience in the medical industry. But what the Cyberonics sales team lacks in formal
medical education they make up with steak house dinners and fine wine (further
documented in Part III) while they voraciously pitch surgeons on implanting as many VNS
devices as possible in their respective sales areas.


Patent Expiration Means Guaranteed Competition and Pricing Pressure

Infitialis spent over two months researching this idea and in the process read nearly every
sell-side report. since 2008. In our view sell-side analysts have done a terrible job at
communicating to market participants the current state of CYBX's intellectual property.
Specifically, on July 16, 2011 the Zabara Patents which covered VNS treatment for
epilepsy expired. Quoting from the CYBX 10K:


The epilepsy patent expired on July 16, 2011 in the U.S. and, as a result, we
discontinued paying this royalty. Also, as a result of the epilepsy patent
expiration, competitors may enter this market. For instance, a company based
in Europe, Neurotech, SA, has obtained CE Mark approval for a device capable
of vagus nerve stimulation, however the device is not yet marketed. Another
company, CerebralRx Ltd. based in Israel, developed an implantable device
capable of vagus nerve stimulation and has CE Mark approval. CerebralRx has
initiated commercialization efforts in several European countries.


It took little time to find several other examples of formidable competition facing CYBX.
For example Medtronic Inc. has submitted an FDA pre-market approval application for its
Activa Neurostimulator for the treatment of epilepsy. As for depression a Bloomberg
Businessweek article published just yesterday discussed a competitor Brainsway Ltd. as
expecting to reach an agreement this quarter with a medical device company to market its
non-evasive stimulation therapy device.


As we previously discussed, our view is that the science has proven VNS lacks efficacy as
a valid treatment option for depression. That being said, in a world where patients believe
this stuff works a strong argument can be made that the non-evasive devices will be the
favored choice given the lack of potential side effects and no need to undergo
surgery.


The expiration of patents coupled with increased competition are two serious events that
CYBX investors are not appropriately discounting. With over 90% of sales being derived
from refractory epilepsy patients the current market valuation of $1.5 Billion foolishly
assumes that CYBX will continue to gain a 90% market share in 40 years. We can't help
but think of the analogies to the scenario and how that ended for investors. As noted
economist Robert Shiller has highlighted rarely does investing at 40x earnings result in
positive returns over time. This is most certainly true for companies that do not even retain
protection of their intellectual property.


VNS Treatment Has Already Reached Its Target Market While Performance
Indicators Lack Adequate Transparency

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 16/36


By more accurately presenting the target market for refractory epilepsy (contrary to the
CYBX 10K disclosure of 3 million patients) we have established that CYBX is no St. Jude
nor will it ever be as a one product company.


But we believe there is more to this story than meets the eye. As we previously alluded,
the VNS treatment simply doesn't work for TRD while it showed a 25% success rate
(subjectively defined as having a seizure that was weaker) on epilepsy patients. If there
ever was a place for VNS it is (until the non-evasive devices enter the market) in the
epilepsy market and not in the TRD market. Herein lies the predicament: with 70,000
patients CYBX has essentially exceeded its target market and we believe there is
little room for organic growth in new patients going forward.


We believe that CYBX and its management team are well aware of this fact and as a
result led by Chief Executive Officer Daniel Moore have reinvented the Company.
Specifically, CYBX has been able to convince Wall Street analysts that it has magically
transformed into a razor/razor blade business model by prominently featuring the following
paragraph in its 10K (the third paragraph under General Business description)


The VNS Therapy pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted into patients
generally during an outpatient procedure. The battery contained in the generator has
a finite life, which varies according to the model as well as the stimulation
parameters for each patient. At or near the end of the useful life of a battery, a
patient may, with the advice of a physician, choose to implant a new
generator, which may be done with or without replacing the original lead.


As we will demonstrate in our valuation models we believe this shift amounts to nothing
more than a "spin" on the story of Cyberonics in order to rationalize its irrational valuation.


After carefully reviewing the business for nearly two months we are confident that the
business model is now at the stage where it is more reliant on Battery Replacements
than new implants of devices. This point is very important as it begins to tie in with the
Whistle Blower allegations in Part III.


Figuring this out was not easy as CYBX management has been unusually opaque with
their discloser of unit sales. Specifically the company does not disclose what
percentage of unit sales are battery replacements vs. new installations. Fortunately,
management has included two figures in their investor presentations through which we
were able to reconstruct what we believe are the actual figures.



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/864683/000086468312000019/form10-k.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 17/36


Sifting through historical presentations over the last two years we found that CYBX
continually tallies both its patients and total device implants on slide 4 of its presentations
to hedge funds and institutional investors. By comparing the two figures over time we
could subtract the patient number from total unit sales with the difference either being
battery replacements or churn. Either way this would finally highlight what percentage of
unit sales were derived organically. It is important to note that this information is not
disclosed in the Company's 10K. Investors reading the 10K would see the following
opaque disclosure for unit sales:


As you can see CYBX treats both newly implanted devices and battery replacements as
the same unit sale via a simple aggregation of Unit Sales. We wanted to know whether
our theory was correct which was that the majority of unit sales are now being derived
from battery replacements as opposed to newly implanted devices. Using those two
figures we have been able to reconstruct what percentage of sales were battery
replacements vs. new implanted device. The results are as follows:

September 2012 Investor Presentation February 2012 Investor Presentation


As the investor presentations prove from February 2012 to January 2013 (11 months)
CYBX patients grew by only 8,000 while device implants grew by 17,000! Thus
Infitialis estimates that as much as 50% of all sales are now being derived from
battery replacements!


Insider Sales Confirm Bubble

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 19/36


As our readers know we believe that insider activity on a company is often the best gauge
when determining whether a company is overvalued. On that front CYBX insiders did not
disappoint. Remember, these are the people that walk into work every day and have the
best view towards whether the market valuation correlates to that of the actual business.


For the year ended 2012 CYBX insiders sold over $34.4 million worth of stock. This
shocking amount matches the company's entire net income last year. It is our opinion
that when Company insiders who together own less than 5% of the Company sell stock
worth approximately 100% of the Company's profits in a given year that is a "heads I win
tails you lose" proposition and is yet another significant red flag which bodes negatively for
CYBX investors.


Had insiders owned a meaningful stake in the business one might understand the need for
diversification, but with CYBX there appears to be a sense of urgency on the part of
management to get rid of their stock as quickly as it vests. Take this transaction reported
on the day the amended whistleblower complaint was filed:


In this transaction CEO Daniel Moore unloads 7,000 shares for total proceeds of
$369,000. This amount was not included in our 2012 tally but may be something
regulators look into when they decide whether the company had a duty to disclose the
whistleblower lawsuit to its investors.


Part II Conclusion


By now readers should be questioning not only the science behind VNS but also the
business model of Cyberonics and whether it warrants a $1.5 Billion valuation.


For us the key takeaways from Part II are that CYBX is not the high growth, high margin,
medical company it purports to be as the business model has shifted from tapping a new
market to managing churn and re-monetizing the existing base of patients. It is with this
takeaway that we present Part III of this report which will for the first time unveil the
allegations made by Andrew Hagerty, a former Cyberonics employee who sued the
company in Massachusetts Federal Court.


PART III: Andrew Hagerty vs. Cyberonics - The Whistleblower Event That Could Cut
CYBX by 80%



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/1/4165661_13589100343663_13.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 20/36


We will now describe the details surrounding the Whistleblower allegations as
documented in this amended complaint filed on Wednesday, January 16, 2013 in
Massachusetts Federal Court. As far as we know this is the first time the whistleblower
event is being made public. We ask each of our readers to read the complaint in its
entirety as it goes into great detail and does a better job of explaining the allegations.


As readers will recall from Parts I and II of this report these are the primary risks to the
CYBX business:


1. The Target market appears to have been saturated at 74,000 installs while we believe
the device does not work for TRD and the market opportunity for refractory epilepsy is
50-60,000 installs based on the science.


2. Based on our reconstruction of the company's top line the business model has
completely shifted with up to 50% of the company's revenues being battery
replacements in existing patients vs. unit sales to new patients.


Enter Andrew J. Hagerty (38) a former Cyberonics employee and top sales salesperson
who claims in a lawsuit filed first on August 8, 2012, and in an amended complaint filed
last week that:


Cyberonics employees are engaging in outright fraud and misrepresentation by
coercing surgeons to prematurely schedule battery replacements as part of a
directive to accelerate battery replacement revenue by upper management
formally implemented in 2007. PRIOR TO 2007 CYBERONICS DID NOT
COMPENATE SALESPEOPLE FOR BATTERY REPLACEMENT SALES IN
EXISTING PATIENTS.


Hagerty presents a convincing account of how Cyberonics salespeople directed
surgeons to replace all batteries that were five years old regardless of their
remaining lifespan in direct violation of FDA standards which required each
battery to be tested by a physician.


Hagerty claims that certain salespeople within Cyberonics personally called
patients who had VNS treatment and scared them into replacing their batteries
prematurely. As a result Physicians called Cyberonics asking why they were
receiving random calls from scared patients.


Hagerty documents a luxurious steak house dinner he attended where a
surgeon (Dr. Ahmed Khan) complains to Hagerty's Manager Craig Yannuzzi that
a Cyberonics salesperson had instructed the back office at Dr. Khan's practice

to prematurely schedule battery replacement examinations for VNS Patients.
Khan who was disgusted and outraged by the practice subsequently halted
these cold calls to patients.


Worst of All Allegations: Hagerty backed by yet another Cyberonics employee
Janet Holland alleges that Cyberonics salespeople were present and illegally
participated in the battery life examination process and REMOVED THE
BATTERY FROM THE WAND COMPONENT OF THE TESTING DEVICE IN A
MANNER THAT DID NOT RAISE SUSPICION BUT RESULTED IN AN INDICATION
OF A WEAK BATTERY SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSING AN IMMEDIATE SCHEDULING
OF A BATTERY REPLACEMENT SURGERY AND RESULTING IN A COMMISSION
TO THE SALESPERSON.


Steak and Lead


One of the worst allegations in the lawsuit takes place at a luxurious steak dinner attended
by Dr. Ahmed Khan a Neurosurgeon who specializes in implanting VNS devices, Andrew
Hagerty and Craig Yannuzzi a regional manager for Cyberonics.


Over a bottle of the finest cabernet sauvignon and the porcini dusted steaks Dr. Khan
alerts Craig Yannuzzi that Gary Muenzen (one of the highest grossing sales associates at
CYBX) had instructed Dr. Khans office staff to make calls to patients scheduling battery

replacements. When Dr. Khan was made aware of Gary Muenzen's actions he indicated
that he had become "humiliated and disgusted." Quoting directly from Mr. Hagerty's
Whistleblower lawsuit:


These are shocking allegations. But what is more troubling about this whole setup is how
CYBX sales people are dining with surgeons at five star restaurants. We believe this
incident highlights the type of reckless behavior that ultimately leads to patients being
unnecessarily implanted with VNS devices. Using Google we found that Cyberonics sales
people frequently host and pay for dinners while pitching VNS. In this press clipping from
2005 we found Craig Yannuzzi's name again in connection with a dinner sponsored by
Cyberonics for the Developmental Disabilities Nurses Association (NJDDNA):

We have only highlighted a small portion of the allegations in the lawsuit. We urge
everyone to read the complaint in its entirety in order to fully understand the severity of
these allegations.

Infitialis Believes The Andrew Hagerty Allegations As They Reconcile With Red
Flags We Uncovered


Our track record is very important to us and when we publish a report we leave no stone
unturned. Upon encountering the whistleblower Andrew Hagerty we immediately initiated
an all encompassing background check. We found no infractions that would in any way
impede on his credibility.


Hagerty the father of a child who had refractory epilepsy took a job as a sales associate
with Cyberonics in May of 2010. After excelling at the company Hagerty was promoted to
salesperson and was eventually in charge of sales for the areas of: Rhode Island,
Vermont, and Massachusetts. As the lawsuit reads, once Hagerty discovered CYBX
employees were engaging in these practices he immediately brought it to the attention of
his superiors. Not only did they refuse to act but they fired Hagerty once he didn't meet his
sales figures which he explains could not be met unless he engaged in the unethical
practice of scaring existing patients into prematurely replacing batteries.


We initiated our own investigation into Cyberonics and it was only after encountering
aspects of the business that were consistent with these allegations that we decided to
publish this piece. It was important for us to establish that CYBX sported both a bubble
valuation as well as a sketchy business model that was relying on controversial science
and misrepresentations to the market. Ultimately what convinced us that these claims
might be valid was how well they reconciled with the various red flags we highlighted in
Part I and II of this report.


The claims in Andrew Hagerty's lawsuits could prove terminal to CYBX because they
allege that over the last 5 years a large portion of battery replacements were done
prematurely in order to increase the velocity of sales at Cyberonics. These claims would
be fairly easy to prove in court as there are several ways to confirm whether battery
replacements occurred prematurely with the easiest one being a simple analysis of the

date of initial implantation vs. date of battery replacement. Another way that Hagerty
himself suggests in the suit would involve testing the old batteries which must be stored by
Cyberonics as part of FDA guidelines.


Once this story gains enough publicity patients will organize in a class and sue
Cyberonics. Such an event would severely impact the business given the uber generous
valuation that has been bid up to by market participants. In the next section we will explore
what a relatively conservative settlement with patients would translate into as far as the
share price is concerned.


CYBX Valuation Scenarios


Ultimately we are security analysts and our job is to incorporate both the qualitative and
quantitative data in this report in a manner that provides a range for intrinsic value. As we
approach the end of the report it is now time to provide our valuation scenarios for CYBX.


We believe there are three possible scenarios that need to be modeled in order to project
intrinsic value for CYBX. We have split them up into Bull, Base, Bear:


BULL CASE:


Under the bull case we completely disregard any of the whistleblower allegations. We also
assume that VNS treatment for refractory epilepsy will remain a valid option for this rarest
subset of the population with epilepsy. Being the bull case we continue to project that
CYBX will grow its top line at a rate of 15% per annum while adjusting net income margins
to last year's 17% reflecting what we believe is a permanent shift in the model to lower
margin battery replacements (up to 47% of the business by our estimates) due to the fact
that the installed base has already reached the maximum point of scientific efficacy. In
keeping with the spirit of the bulls we even project that CYBX shares outstanding will
decline by 1.5 million shares reflecting over $75 million in buybacks an amount that would
equate to the majority of the company's cash. Finally we apply a rather generous 15x
multiple which is roughly 3x more than that awarded to Medtronic and St. Jude .
5/20/2018 Blowing The Whistle On Cyberonics - Cyberonics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CYBX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 25/36


It is truly amazing to see just how overvalued is. Even when modeling the business under
the rosiest scenarios that project an installed base of 95,000 in 2015 (a figure we believe
defies logic as it would represent nearly 50% of the entire refractory epilepsy population)
we still cannot arrive at a valuation which is anywhere near $50 a share for CYBX. Instead
when incorporating 3 monster 15% growth years, substantial share buybacks, and a very
rich 15x forward earnings multiple we are left with a range of between $23-$31 a share
that the company would only achieve between 12 and 36 months. In other words even
when incorporating these incredibly rosy inputs investors will have to wait between 1 and
3 years for CYBX to have a fair value of $23-30 a share. How any responsible analyst
could arrive at a price target exceeding $35-40 is beyond us. Once again this scenario is
very reminiscent to the one which plagued in the fall of 2012. Since then the company has
had to guide down and analyst targets were reduced by 30-50% and the shares have
declined by nearly 60%.


BASE CASE:


Under the base case we assume as evidenced by our qualitative research that the lack of
scientific efficacy of the VNS treatment leads to a more realistic growth trajectory for
CYBX. We peg that rate at a generous 10% a year. Moreover we incorporate the
whistleblower event in a very muted way projecting that as a result of the allegations the
company will have to reserve only several million dollars in legal fees however in the
process no share buy backs will be implemented given the defensive way in which
management will need to treat capital.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 26/36


Once again it is amazing to see how changing only two inputs affects the valuation so
much. This confirms the asymmetry to the downside that is built into CYBX and how
irreconcilable the current $1.5 Billion valuation is. What we see is that even when growing
at an impressive 10% a year and keeping the share count at 28 million (incorporating yet
another naive assumption that there will be no stock/option grants in 3 years) CYBX
should only be worth between $21-$25 in the next 12-36 months. Again, even in the base
case we assume that the whistleblower allegations how no true impact on the business
and dismiss the event as a short-term nuisance.


BEAR CASE:


The allegations brought on by Andrew Hagerty amount to nothing short of a monumental
negative event for CYBX. These game changing allegations have until today been
unknown to the analyst community and market participants. These allegations as
evidence by our work make a lot of sense and corroborate with both the weak science
underlying VNS as well as battery replacements forming a larger component of sales.


We believe that responsible long investors in this name will now have to incorporate these
allegations into their valuation models in a manner that provides sufficient margin of
safety. As for our model we decided the best way to incorporate such allegations would be
in the form of an easily modeled onetime cash settlement with the class of patients that
were duped into early battery replacement. We have conservatively estimated this class at
$100 million or $3.57 per share. We also reduce growth rates to just 5% reflecting once
again an ultra conservative view that once these allegations are publicized there will be
significant backlash to VNS contributing to muted growth as opposed to the complete
demise of the Company. Finally we reduce the multiple awarded to CYBX from 15x net
income to that of Medtronic and St. Jude (12x).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1128101-blowing-the-whistle-on-cyberonics 27/36


The results indicate that under the bear case CYBX will only be worth between $12.65
and $14.32 over the next 12-36 months. Averaging out all three valuation scenarios we
are left with an intrinsic value estimate of between $13.48-$26.72.


Finally, when weighing all three valuation scenarios equally at 33.3% probability we are
left with a fair value estimate of $21.21 for CYBX representing roughly 60% downside
risk from current levels


Conclusion


As evidenced in this exhaustive report we believe that long investors should stay away
from Cyberonics, Inc. as there are significant risks to the downside. Speculative investors
should consider shorting shares of as we estimate 2015 fair value at $21.21 a share vs.
the current market price of $50.


Make no mistake about it - The whistleblower lawsuit we highlighted today
represents a major event. Any responsible investor in CYBX will have to take a
serious look at these allegations and how they incorporate into their overall thesis
on the company.


We have presented enough data to establish that CYBX had significant downside risks
associated with its valuation even before the whistleblower allegations. It is only on the
merit of this data that we are comfortable saying that is our highest conviction idea ever.


Finally, we leave you with the Top Reasons to Sell/Short :
