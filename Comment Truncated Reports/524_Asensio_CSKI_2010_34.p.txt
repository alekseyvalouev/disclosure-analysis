CSKI’s History of Touting Government “Awards”
while Omitting Violations


Posted on February 19, 2010 by Asensio.com


Today asensio.com released a report on China Sky One Medical, Inc.


(NASDAQ: CSKI), titled “CSKI Products on Government List of


‘Counterfeit Drug Products,’ Pharmacies Ordered to Stop Selling.”


As shown in the report, eight of CSKI’s products appear on a list of


“counterfeit drug products” in a notice from China’s Ministry of


Public Health. The notice also contains an order for pharmacies to


stop selling products on the list.


Two of the products on the list, the Coryza Spray and the Tinea


Pedis Spray, are touted by CSKI in its 10K as having obtained “High


Technology products certificates by Heilongjiang Technology


Products Committee.” CSKI also touts other “awards and grants


from the government of the PRC” in its 10K.


These and other disclosures by CSKI (including numerous press


releases) stand at odds with CSKI’s history of garnering government


citations for deceptive marketing claims and advertising violations.


The asensio.com report released today shows that CSKI products


and advertising were cited for violation by government agencies in


in three other instances in 2009, while a further history of


violations stretches back to 2003.


Investors should rightfully ask if CSKI is distorting government


involvement in its business in disclosures to U.S. investors by


omitting all negative, though potentially material, citations by the


Chinese government.
