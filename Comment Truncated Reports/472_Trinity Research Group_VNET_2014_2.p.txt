Missing Pictures Of 21Vianet Group's MNS Ghost Offices

Summary


A recent article used photos that we mistakenly uploaded in a clerical error to
attempt to discredit our evidence.


As you can see below, the photos we actually took are of the exact same locations
as those erroneously uploaded and are easy to confuse due to their similarity.


Meanwhile, VNET is already tampering with the evidence within their control, such
as their list of data centers on their website.


Attempts to discredit the copious evidence we produced by singling out a couple of
pictures we allegedly never took smacks of an attempt to divert attention from the
substantial issues.


Those issues include iJoy's inexplicable financials and related party transactions, the
major discrepancy between MNS Entities' financials and their SAIC filings, illegal
MNS operations, serious balance sheet issues, etc.


This article published in response to our first report on 21Vianet Group ("VNET")
attempted to discredit over 100 exhibits and an attached 77-page appendix with more
exhibits that we published. PDF versions of those reports can be found on our website or
on Scribd.com (report here and appendix here).


Despite the author's attempt to divert attention from the key issues, the key issues remain
unresolved despite a conference call the company held in response to our report on
September 11, 2014. As we expected, the company, as well as the author of the short
article that tried to discredit us, failed to address any of the key issues, which include but
are not limited to the following.


1. iJoy's inexplicable financials and ridiculous near 100% profit margins (as disclosed in
the 2013 20-F, page F-39) after years of miserably unprofitable financial performance
as disclosed in SAIC filings (see section beginning on page 40 of our first report)


2. The trail of events that strongly suggests iJoy's acquisition was orchestrated to
roundtrip acquisition proceeds and cash balances into VNET by pumping the
company's cash balances up through a loan to the seller and the purchase of

equipment shortly after the acquisition (see pages 46-50 of our first report). The receipt
we showed of a transaction with one of China's five largest iron ore importers suggests
fake contracts were used to roundtrip the cash in as software revenue (see page 57)


3. The long list of red flags from a review of MNS acquired subsidiaries' SAIC filings, not
the least of which include ghost office registrations with the SAIC for all MNS
acquisitions and a 51% overstatement of consolidated revenue reported to the SEC
when compared to revenue reported to the SAIC (see pages 63-64 of our first report)


4. The fact that per China's telecom regulations and China Telecom's internal policies,
VNET's MNS subsidiaries are operating illegally (see pages 94-99 of our first report)
and are not appropriately licensed (see pages 82-84 and 100-101) and VNET remains
on China Telecom's blacklist of illegal bandwidth reselling as recently as August 6,
2014 (see page 94)


5. The fact that over half of VNET's reported partnered data centers (the list of 60 we
investigated was taken from VNET's own corporate website, as noted in Appendix A of
our report) had contracts that were already terminated some time ago or were never
partnered to begin with. Interestingly, VNET's website has begun making some
changes to their data center list, omitting certain data centers listed before our article
was published and including certain others. We have screen shots of the original
website contents and will publish the "before and after" screen shots once VNET is
done tampering with their previously disclosed data center list.


6. Clear evidence that all the issues mentioned above are only getting worse over time as
VNET acquires highly suspicious and troubled non-core businesses at larger and
larger valuations to continue its modus operandi of consolidating acquired revenue to
generate financials that cannot be explained by fundamentals. The last of these
transactions is Aipu, which has been banned in three cities, was investigated by the
SAIC and China's state-owned CCTV for consumer fraud, was denied a listing in
China's A-share stock market and was acquired at a 20x multiple to the valuation at
which the #2 insider sold (see pages 108-155 of our first report).


Of course, we are purposely not mentioning dozens of other red flags that abound for the
sake of brevity, but the list is very long.


Instead of addressing these substantial issues, all the author of the "Bogus Exhibit" article
can point to at the moment are three pictures that were uploaded in a clerical error for
which we have matching pictures we took. See below for yourself.

The dozens of locations we visited to verify the existence of VNET's many acquisitions
(we were unable to verify any MNS acquisitions or iJoy, among others we have yet to write
about) were generally difficult to find. The Fujian and Jiujiang's offices were particularly
challenging to locate exactly, and it took our ground team two days to finally be able to
take pictures. Taxi drivers or our own personal drivers were not able to find them from the
streets, so we mapped their location through Baidu, collecting pictures from the Web

whenever available to help our ground team pinpoint the offices. When we tagged these
pictures, of which we have over 200 for the MNS subsidiaries alone, the pictures above
were tagged improperly. When we uploaded our substantial over 120-pager, the document
we submitted to SA contained three incorrect pictures, which we have rectified above.


Contrary to what the "Bogus Exhibits" author suggests, all these pictures were taken in
good faith and reported as is, with no modifications. All one has to do is log in to the SAIC
site themselves, pull the same records we did and go verify that our pictures are 100%
real in person. We encourage investors to check the latest SAIC filing documents from
their official website http://www.saic.gov.cn/ywbl/zxcx/djqyxxcx/ and pay an in-person visit
to all the MNS subsidiaries and iJoy offices.


For those not wanting to do that, we provided screen shots of all registered office locations
in our report. Even the company admitted to investors that the office locations were
accurate and in their conference call, only challenged the number of employees that iJoy
has, which apparently is between 30-40 as opposed to the 5-8 we reported from SAIC
filings. The company may very well have hired more people into iJoy or shifted Fastweb's
employees or otherwise reorganized since the 2013 acquisition, but the facts remain that
upon time of acquisition, the SAIC reported a smaller number of employees and financials
that do not even remotely resemble the post-acquisition performance of iJoy.


We leave you with some more pictures of the areas surrounding the locations where ZYTL
and YJHT should be per SAIC registration as well as the promise that very shortly, we will
disclose more evidence of VNET's highly suspicious transactions (we have yet to discuss
related party transactions in detail) as well as poor corporate governance. Expect an
article with those details shortly, as soon as we are able to submit it to SA's editorial team.
