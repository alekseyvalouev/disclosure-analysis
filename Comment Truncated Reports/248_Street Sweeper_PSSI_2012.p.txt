PSS World Medical: Prognosis Undetermined
Oct. 3, 2012 4:44 PM ET
by: The Street Sweeper


PSS World Medical (NASDAQ:PSSI) is a shopaholic with more than 100 acquired
companies under its belt and a recurring need to reinvent itself to try to keep up with the
competition.


The distributor of bed pans, medicine and similar items is lugging around heavy debt - and
the torment of posting its lowest net income in 25 straight quarters.


A forensic accountant who reviewed some of the Jacksonville, Fla.-based company's
documents also pointed out some scars in its finances.


"It wouldn't surprise me if the company was trying to hide something," said Keith Mautner,
a San Diego, Calif.-based forensic accountant.


"They're doing things companies that engage in fraud also do, but that doesn't necessarily
mean they are engaging in fraud themselves," Mautner added.


PSSI, market cap $1.1 billion, distributes medical products primarily to doctors' offices, but
also long-term care and assisted living facilities, and home health-care and hospice
providers.


PSSI management did not return telephone calls requesting an interview with
TheStreetSweeper.


Some PSSI issues that deserve closer examination:


* Falling profits; history of missed estimates


* Failed buy-out shears shareholders, fires up concerns


* Heavy debt


* Restructuring bothers analysts


* Some analysts downgrade


* Losing out to big competitors


* Inadequate hospital distribution

Falling Net Income and Long History of Missed Estimates


It's been a long, long time - 25 quarters - since PSSI has reported such dismal net income.
The company's income fell to $10.7 million this past quarter. That profit - damaged by
increased general and selling expenses, plus new acquisitions - compares with about $20
million in each of the previous three quarters.


Investors have to look way back to the restated results of June 2008 to find income that
dipped as low. The income dropped to $9.4 million then.


And PSSI continues to fall short of Wall Street expectations again and again. The
company has missed revenue estimates for the last five quarters in a row and missed on
earnings per share for the past three quarters, recently posting 18 cents actual versus 21
cents expected.


In an email to TheStreetSweeper from Goldman Sachs, it's clear that one of the world's
largest investment banks does not like the direction PSS is headed, either. Goldman
maintained its "sell" rating recently and lowered its estimates of the company's future
performance.


"After reporting both a top-and bottom-line miss, it is difficult to gain increased conviction
in the company's ability to meet both its near and long-term goals in a clearly still difficult
environment," analyst Robert Jones wrote in the research report emailed to
TheStreetSweeper.


"Although management made no changes to the long-term outlook for the company, we
believe investors will be looking for several quarters of positive performance before better
understanding the growth trajectory."


Goldman lowered 2013 earnings estimates from $1.14 down to $1.05. The 2014 estimate
dropped to $1.30 from $1.55, and the 2015 expectation dropped to $1.37 from $1.65.


"We make no change to our Sell rating, as the quarter does little to change our
fundamental view of the company and industry at this point," Jones continued.


Other analysts are also debating whether PSSI can really pull off the $1.11 to $1.15
earnings per share that management has guided them to expect for its fiscal year 2013.

"The continuing operations earnings number was 18 cents ..." Larry Marsh, Barclays
Capital analyst said during a recent conference call. "Obviously, if you back out the first
quarter (looking at $1.11 to $1.15 earnings) … that would imply you got to do $0.30 to
$0.35 a quarter for the next three quarters. You are confirming that that's very much
doable based on results today?"


"Yes," PSSI chief financial officer David Bronson said.


He also conceded that there will likely be some "choppiness" in results over the next few
quarters as the company completes divestitures, reorganizes, adds to sales efforts and
restructures its shared service support.


A New York City doctor who views PSS from the customer's standpoint sums up his take
on the situation more bluntly.


"This is a desperate company," said the urologist, who wants to remain anonymous and is
short PSSI.


Is PSSI Desperate?


Perhaps the most recent act of hope or - in the doctor's opinion - desperation occurred on
May 10, when PSSI announced a reinvention plan that includes putting its skilled nursing
segment and specialty dental segment up for sale. In fact, the company announced Sept.
27 that it agreed to sell the dental segment for $68 million to Chicago private equity firm
Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Co. Shares slid less than a quarter to close down at $23.05.


Unloading those businesses seems a bit confounding since skilled nursing accounts for up
to $500 million in revenue, while dental accounts for about $45 million. That's about a
quarter of PSSI's $2.1 billion annual revenue. But when a shopaholic counts its dollars
and discovers a significant drop in free cash flow - cash available to buy more businesses
- the frantic search for more money begins. Indeed, a graph shows PSS's free cash flow
has dropped to $18.85 million, down from $55.97 million in March.


PSSI's reinvention also involves recent acquisitions: two lab businesses (InfoLab and
ProLabs), and a physician in-office distributing business (Physician Partners) announced
in May. And in January, the company acquired Blue Medical Supply and Equipment, a
transaction PSSI's founder arranged with the company he invested in following his
resignation from PSSI, according to the Jacksonville Business Journal.

So here's what PSSI's horse trading looks like: It has bought four businesses with roughly
$138 million expected in annual sales, which is nearly four times smaller than the roughly
$545 million in sales made by the two segments that PSSI has been so anxious to get rid
of.


Earlier Failed Buy-Out at "Animal House" Could Jinx Any Would-be Buy-outs;
Successful Buy-out Could Batter PSSI Shares


Buy-out rumors surfaced this summer - and helped bump up the stock - as PSSI began
reinventing itself in a situation reminiscent of a summer over a decade ago.


One rumor sprang up in July when the company announced plans to sell skilled nursing
and dental, and filed corporate papers with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
detailing executive termination payments under any change in the control of the company
(the chief executive, Gary Corless, would get about $1.6 million or two times base pay if
his exit is his idea and $2.4 million or three times base pay if it's the company's idea, plus
a target bonus).


Speculation arose again in August when PSSI cancelled a road show with financial
services group UBS, though PSSI said it was due to a scheduling conflict.


Despite the speculation, PSSI World Medical's only real attractive feature would seem to
be its salesforce because potential buyers likely wouldn't need to duplicate the
warehouses, inventory, branded products or laboratory equipment.


And shareholders certainly wouldn't want to duplicate the buy-out experience they
endured back in the summer of 2000.


PSSI was road-weary and deep in debt from its efforts to re-invent itself. By the time its
seven-year buying frenzy ended that year, it had acquired more than 100 small
companies.


PSSI really became the poster child for the "roll-up" tactic in which a company is
essentially built on a series of acquisitions.


The strategy is legal and enjoyed marked popularity a few years ago. But it's also fairly
easy for someone to overpay for an acquisition, then pocket the difference or prop up
earnings. Insiders say it's a common form of accounting fraud among Chinese rollups.

TheStreetSweeper has exposed the roll-up strategies of American companies such as
Swisher Hygiene, a bathroom-cleaning business that recently announced its chief
executive's resignation, as well as its chief financial officer's resignation and the
company's risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq amid an accounting investigation.
Swisher was running more than $8 per share before diving to more than $6 the day of
TheStreetSweeper story. Swisher is under $2 now.


In PSSI's case, the company found itself aching to be bought out in 2000 as it carried
some $250 million in debt and some of its businesses struggled, according to The Wall
Street Journal. Five months of waiting finally seemed to be paying off in June that year,
when Fisher Scientific International, now a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.
(NYSE:TMO) announced plans to acquire PSSI in a stock deal worth about $840 million.


Indeed, the financial problems were so significant that Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger
picked up on all the signs and said that PSSI "operating problems are deeper than
expected and the financials are much messier than expected."


Investors felt the same way and quickly showed what they thought of the whole deal.
Fisher and PSSI stock fell, with investors trouncing PSS more than $2 to send the share
price tumbling to about $7.


Then the warm, gloomy day of Sept. 1, 2000 brought a smattering of rain to Wall Street
and the dreary news that the merger had fallen apart. Both bedraggled companies stated
that "the transaction is not in the best interest of their respective shareholders." The value
of PSSI shares dropped by $1.53 over that Labor Day weekend to just $4.81.


Bad news was steamrolling PSSI and it looked like it would never let up. The stock
continued its death-spiral when the company announced that earnings would likely falter
significantly below expectations. The stock that sold for a high of $33.75 in 1996 careened
downward to hit a record low of $2.69 on Oct. 3, 2000. The same day, the company
announced the resignation of founder and then-chief executive Patrick Kelly, a colorful
college flunk-out and Vietnam veteran who wrote a book on how he built the company
dubbed "a cross between the U.S. Marines and Animal House." The next week the chief
operations officer followed Kelly out the door.


The failed Fisher Scientific merger hatched a class action lawsuit that PSSI settled for
$6.75 million in 2004. The lawsuit alleged Kelly, two other executives and the company
misrepresented earnings, "cooked its books" and artificially inflated the stock price, though

didn't claim the executives personally profited. The executives departed but one of them,
David A. Smith, remained with the company as chairman and chief executive officer for
half a decade after the lawsuit was settled.


"No one in their right mind would buy this company," the New York doctor grumbled.


Debt Decision Gyrates Stock


Even retail therapy couldn't help the exhausted Florida shopaholic after its best shot at
getting bought out collapsed in that embarrassing public drama in the fall of 2000.


PSSI needed some real CPR. It arrived in the form of $150 million worth of convertible
bonds.


Goldman Sachs - the same investment bank that has lost so much confidence in the
company that it's now rating PSSI a sell - talked to Smith about issuing the low-interest
bonds, according to The Wall Street Journal. These bonds would allow a company to pay
off higher-interest debt like the $115 million floating interest rate bank debt hanging around
PSSI's neck. The bonds provide alluring low-interest financing but Goldman bankers said
the hitch is that the primary investors would be hedge funds more interested in short-term
profits rather than a company's long-term health.


Smith and other execs bit. But they were shocked at how fascinating PSSI suddenly
became as trading volume virtually tripled to about 1 million on several occasions after the
March 16, 2004 sale. The company and most investors didn't know it, but at least 10
hedge funds had begun rapidly trading PSSI shares, sources told The Wall Street Journal.


The hedge funds typically short the stock in order to protect their investment from a
possible stock price decline. While the hedge funds made money from small share price
changes, the average investor didn't see much benefit. PSSI shares were around $12 just
before the bonds were issued and moved only slightly in the next weeks before closing
May 11 at $11.07.


"Every penny we gained we lost," PSSI investment relations head Robert Weiner said at
one point.


As often happens, the average investors apparently were put off by those unpredictable
stock swings.


"We can't have volatility in our stock like this - it drives away long-term shareholders,"
Smith said at the time.

The scenario ultimately happened much as Goldman Sachs bankers had explained it:
trading rose in the six months after the bonds were issued and then fell dramatically a
year later after the big money had moved on.


The uproar was far from over, as Smith suddenly moved on, too.


On Jan. 27, 2010, the company released its FY 2010 third quarter results showing lower
sales and Smith said, "Our results are ahead of plan and demonstrate solid momentum in
our strategic initiatives…" A week later, the company filed a notice saying Smith - the chief
architect of that earlier restructuring - and the company "mutually agreed" his employment
would end that day. Painful though the departure might have been, Smith's lucrative
separation agreement lobbed $2.7 million into his wallet. Chief operating officer Gary
Corless took his seat as president and chief executive, and got a pay raise to $600,000
from $450,000.


With three of the more than 100 acquisitions occurring in the last few months and PSSI's
plans for more ahead, shareholders still have to worry about similar financial doings and
unhappy consequences. The company is rapidly sucking up cash and feeding its
borrowing habit virtually every time its wallet feels a little light.


In fact, the company had about $455 million in consolidated debt as of March 30, 2012.


PSSI also recently closed on $250 million worth of senior notes planned primarily for
paying off older debt and possibly buying more companies, records show. The company
also purchased convertible hedge notes to keep converted shares from diluting share
value.


Gulf South Merger: Previous Restructuring Worries Linger


PSSI became unfortunately familiar with spending wads of money - ultimately sometimes
threatening shareholders' investments - to get itself out of scraps beginning in 1998, about
a decade after it was incorporated under the name Physician Sales and Service, Inc., a
company formed from 33 acquisitions.


PSSI acquired Gulf South Medical Supply in March 1998 in a stock swap worth about
$661 million. The merged company was renamed PSS World Medical and three directors
were retained, including Melvin Hecktman, who even today remains on the PSS audit
committee.


At the time, PSSI founder Kelly called it "one of the most compelling transactions we have
ever completed."

But two months later, accounting issues related to the merger forced PSSI to issue
guidance well below Street estimates, sending PSSI shares falling to $14 from $23.


Just when it seemed the merger surely couldn't hurt investors much more, they got
bashed again. On Oct. 26, 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission began an
informal review of the Gulf acquisition that was later dropped. PSSI shares continued the
decline, closing at just $6.72. So, if a stockholder had bought 1,000 shares at $23 on the
day of the deal, those $23,000-worth of shares would have fizzled to about $6,700 on the
date of the SEC review announcement.


Ultimately, PSSI's acquisition of Gulf South launched a securities class action case filed in
1998. Shares were already in the pits at around $13 and dropped to the high $12 range in
the days after the case was settled six years later for $16.5 million.


After that reinvention that so pained investors, they've got to be wondering if this
restructuring will ultimately be so painful.


Mautner looked at the restructuring plan through the forensic accountant's spectacles and
spotted some potential issues.


"This change in operating segments may be a better way to run the company, it may
improve profitability and it may be in the best interest of shareholders," he said.


"Or it may be a smokescreen," Mautner said.


As some segments disappear from the next financial filings, he said it will become much
more difficult to follow the money and figure out just how management is allocating
resources.


Analysts Say Reinvention Confusing


Likewise, analysts' sharp grilling during the May 10 conference call indicates they may
have some uncertainties about the restructuring, too.


They generally pointed with apparent skepticism to issues surrounding the potential
profitability and problems with in-office dispensing, the relatively new laboratory business
and looming issues in home healthcare and hospice.


"To me, the first glance of all these changes seem very confusing," commented Marsh,
with Barclays Capital.

"Sounds like you're getting into the lab services business," he said referring to ProLabs
and InfoLab, which were most recently acquired along with in-office dispensing company
Physician Partners.


Marsh asked what fiscal 2013 looks like and how the company would manage running the
four businesses.


CEO Corless talked about leadership among the segments and said that elder care would
begin getting more of the time, talent and money that were going to skilled nursing when
the elder care and skilled nursing segments were together.


"So I don't know if that answered your question or not but you can tell me if it did," Corless
said.


"Okay, I'll just defer," Marsh said before forging on.


Credit Suisse's Glen Santangelo reiterated the confusion felt by analysts who are paid to
understand companies and pitch them to investors.


"Gary and David, it's a little bit unclear to me, exactly. As part of the transformation … do
you expect to spend a lot of incremental amount of money? I get it you're divesting a
couple businesses and you bought a couple of incremental lab businesses, but is there a
lot of incremental expenses attached to this transformation above and beyond that?"
Santangelo asked.


"There may be some restructuring type costs as we redesign both our distribution
infrastructure to support all four verticals and redesign our shared services function. But
it's important also to understand that we are expecting a much higher organic growth rate
and growth rate from acquisition in these four verticals, so is this a net cost down or up? I
think we'll have to wait and see," CFO Bronson said.


Another analyst asked why the company plans to focus on home healthcare.


"I just wonder if we're looking at this industry wrong … if you're betting against one of the
cyclical government-engineered capacity crunches coming," said Raymond James analyst
John Ransom.


"Look, it's a good question and we're aware of all of the challenges that the caregivers in
the home care and the hospice are dealing with. What I'll tell you is this, as you know, one
of the reasons that the government has paid significant attention to the customers there is

because of the significant profitability in each of those caregivers," Bronson said, adding
that opportunity exists for companies that can help caregivers.


Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Robert Willoughby questioned the wisdom of
focusing on the in-office dispensing business.


"Can you (remind) me why that business is going to fly?" he asked.


Bronson said it's an emerging market but offers convenience and better care for the
patient while providing a revenue source for the doctor.


However, in an interview with TheStreetSweeper, Dr. Mike Ritze, a Broken Arrow, Okla.
family doctor who belonged to a larger group practice several years ago, said he found
that a PSS competitor's medicine cabinet at the heart of the in-office dispensing didn't
really make money for the doctors, though it was convenient for patients.


Analyst Pessimism, Downgrades Persist


The restructuring announcement and explanations failed to spread joy among many
analysts.


In maintaining its sell rating on PSS at a 12-month $18 price target, Goldman Sachs
analyst Jones wrote: "While it is only one quarter into the company's strategic
transformation, the results do little to instill confidence that PSSI's new, more focused
direction will allow the company to better navigate still-challenging industry headwinds
(i.e., customer consolidation, stagnant utilization)."


Robert W. Baird downgraded the stock from outperform to neutral from outperform while
dropping the price target from $29 to $21. And Raymond James cut it to market perform
from outperform. However, UBS initiated coverage of PSS with a buy and a price target of
$26 soon after.


In late July, the stock also suffered another downgrade from buy to hold by TheStreet
Ratings. Deteriorating net income, declining revenues and disappointing stock
performance were among the reasons for the decline.


More recently, Credit Suisse reiterated its outperform rating but bumped up the price
target a buck to $26, apparently helping to push PSS shares to close at $23.06.


Overall, analysts have put the price target at $18 to $26, with a mean price target of
$21.69.

"Fraught with Land Mines"


A couple of New York City urologists, including the one who is short the stock, put the
stock value at someplace around $11 to $13.


The doctor who's shorting the stock recently decided to buy most of his medical supplies
from McKesson Medical-Surgical when the leading medical equipment supplier offered
him 20 percent off its products.


"McKesson and Cardinal are knocking out the small players," the doctor said of two huge
PSS competitors.


"It was a no-brainer," he said. "I go with the least cost one. Why would I use PSSI? It's the
most expensive company out there. They also have the most archaic delivery system,
using their own drivers while everyone else uses FedEx or UPS."


These are the truck drivers, incidentally, that company founder Kelly supplied with
business cards identifying them as the chief executive officer, according to his book,
"Faster Company: Building the World's Nuttiest, Turn-on-a-Dime, Home-Grown, Billion-
Dollar Business."


PSSI's in-office dispensing offers a cabinet stocked with drugs that allows doctors to
dispense pre-packaged medications straight from their office. The New York urologist and
another New York physician in private practice call the medicine cabinet a terrible idea.


"It's impractical. I don't have the interest in getting involved in that … and there's the
liability issue. People could break in and steal your drugs," the first doctor said.


"It's fraught with land mines from stem to stern," said the other urologist.


The cost of convenience under the physician dispensing model can be high. The
heartburn drug Zantac fetches about 35 cents at the pharmacy but could be hiked nearly
10 times to $3.25 a pill for those stocked in doctors' medicine cabinets, according to a
recent New York Times article.


Now under national debate, loopholes in some states' workers' compensation insurance
programs allow this controversial practice of doctors selling medicine that experts say
costs taxpayers, insurance companies and employers additional hundreds of millions of
dollars each year.


"It is outlawed in New York. Nobody does it," said a New York City gastroenterologist.

He said, with the exception of nutritional agents prescribed by diet doctors, physicians
haven't sold drugs in the state of New York in the past decade or so.


If thousands of doctors are prohibited from selling medicine, of course, this narrows the
market for PSS. Other states that prohibit doctors from dispensing drugs, include Utah,
Montana, Massachusetts and Texas, according to a report.


Hospital Distribution Needs Improvement


One doctor said it is critical for the PSSIs of the world to sell products to hospitals rather
than focusing on doctor's offices because hospitals are gobbling up doctors' practices in
New York and elsewhere.


"That's why PSSI is trying to get bought out. PSSI needs the hospital player. But the
hospital player doesn't really need PSSI," the urologist said.


In the past few years, hospitals have shown a renewed interest in buying physician
practices, according to a 2009 paper presented at the 10th Annual Conference on
Emerging Issues in Healthcare Law. This resurgence follows a 1990s hospital buying
spree. A 1996 study showed that about 40 percent of doctors planned to sell their
practices to a management group or hospital.


A second urologist told TheStreetSweeper that PSSI seems to be behind the times,
missing out as the medical community moves toward these hospital buy-outs or hospital
affiliations, along with the formation of bigger practices or big buying groups that can take
advantage of economies of scale.


CEO Corless recently told investors that the company conducts business with hundreds of
hospital systems. But that's merely a fraction of the 5,000 hospitals that work with
McKesson, according to its website.


A physician practice bought by a hospital isn't typically shut down and therefore isn't a lost
opportunity for physician office distributors such as PSSI, Corless added during a recent
conference with William Blair and Co.


PSSI also sells products with its own brand on them and testing equipment that allows
doctors to conduct simple analysis such as pregnancy testing in the office rather than
sending samples to outside laboratories.


But a New York gastroenterologist told TheStreetSweeper that insurance companies and
New York State's health department frown on in-office testing.

"You can't bill the patient for it because the insurance company won't pay you back for it
unless you're a licensed laboratory in the state of New York," he said.


When he asked the health department why he couldn't conduct simple tests, he said he
was told, "How do we know you're not color-blind and will read these things wrong?"


Meanwhile, Ritze, the Oklahoma doctor and state House of Representatives member said
he has read the Affordable Care Act twice. Ritze likes PSS but under healthcare reform,
good companies like PSSI will definitely have to scramble, he said.


"You're going to see a lot more burden put on these companies with taxes. A lot of your
orthotics - crutches, knee braces, ankle braces - they've increased the taxes. There's
about a 10 percent tax on all those to pay for Obamacare," Ritze said.


He said PSSI and other companies will likely have to turn more to products made in China
and other foreign countries that tend to lack the quality of U.S. products.


"There could be a real problem with their company, as well as others that are trying to
compete," Ritze said.


PSSI seems to be falling behind the competition in some respects. PSSI is trading at a
multiple of nearly 17, close to the average for the industry. The company appears to be
overvalued compared to its competitors in light of that falling net income - about 25
percent in the most recent quarter ($10.7 million) below the same quarter prior year ($14.2
million). Yet both Henry Schein and Owens & Minor Inc. grew 3 percent and McKesson
gained 24 percent.


Recent Insider Trading


Insiders have sold heavily since May. Possibly indicating that they think the share price
may be ready to decline, they've sold about 66,000 shares on the open market worth
about $1.5 million at prices ranging from about $21-$24 apiece, compared with purchases
of only 5,000 shares for about $101,000 in that time period.


Strangely coinciding with the day of PSS's restructuring announcement, chief marketing
officer John Sasen sold 45,000 PSSI shares for $990,000, leaving him with a little over
69,000 shares. This automatic sale at $22 per share was pre-set two months earlier,
records show, so there's no pattern that might help investors understand the significance
of the sale. Since the beginning of the year, PSSI shares had been trading in the $22 to
$25 range until Sasen sold the shares on the day the stock hit its lowest price to that point
