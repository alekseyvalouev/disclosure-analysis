China Sky, Takasima, and Massage Chairs: A
Tangled Web of Coincidences or Related Parties?


Posted on May 26, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) reported in its 2006 10-


K that in March 2007 it entered into an agreement with a Malaysian


company called Takasima Industries for the distribution in


Malaysia of China Sky’s Slim Patch product. Under the terms of the


agreement, Takasima was required to generate sales revenue of


US$1 million per month. The 2006 10-K also states, “Management


anticipates that this strategic agreement could result in up to US$12


million in additional annual sales revenue in 2007, with a net profit


margin of 20%.” This was an amount equal to 60% of CSKI’s 2006


revenue.


There is an apparent conflict on the date of the agreement in China


Sky’s disclosures. The 10-K states that the agreement was entered


into March 2007. A press release dated February 20, 2007, states


that the agreement with Takasima was made “early this year.”


Neither the press release nor the 10-K refers to the full legal name


of Takasima Industries.


Neither the 2008 10-K nor the 2007 10-K provides any new


disclosures concerning the term of the Takasima agreement, and


for what period Takasima agreed to have minimum sales of $1


million per month.


The Takasima story was instrumental in China Sky claiming to have


revenues grow from $19 million in 2006 to $49 million in 2007.


China Sky’s reported revenues from Malaysia in 2007 were more


than $13 million. In 2008, however, China Sky’s Malaysia sales were


only $8.8 million.


Information was gained by asensio.com that puts into question the


nature of the relationship between China Sky and Takasima, and


Manuel Asensio
doesn’t bet
often. But when
he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

implies the transactions between the two might have been done at


much less than arm’s-length.


California corporate registration records show an entity called


Takasima Sporting Goods, Inc. at an address in City of Industry,


California. A company called Lailai Capital Corporation has the


same address under California records. What makes this interesting


is a connection with the principal of American Eastern Securities,


Inc., the group that arranged China Sky’s reverse merger and first


subsequent PIPE offering, and that was a major shareholder as of


April 2008.


Charles Trang Chong Hung is American Eastern’s principal. Hung is


listed as Registered Principal in a FINRA sanction against himself


and American Eastern. Hung is also listed as the secretary of Lailai


Capital Corporation in a lawsuit filed against Lailai by Union Oil


BREA Federal Credit Union. See attached “Complaint for Money,


Fraud, Constructive Trust and for Conspiracy.”


Hung was issued stock in CSKI as part of CSKI’s reverse merger in


2006. In CSKI’s 8-K filed May 15, 2006, Hung appears as having


87,685 shares. American Eastern Group, Inc. appears owning the


same number of shares, and another entity, American Eastern


Securities, Inc. appears owning 54,803 shares. EIC Investments, LLC,


whose principal is Hung’s son, Charles Hung, Jr., also received


54,803 shares in the reverse merger. China Sky’s Form S-1 filed


April 11, 2008 shows American Eastern Group also having warrants


to purchase 500,000 shares at $2 per share, expiring July 2009.


California records for Lailai Capital also show Kirk G. Downing as a


former registered agent. Downing is an attorney based in City of


Industry, CA who sits on the board of American Dairy, Inc. (NYSE:


ADY). American Dairy was another Chinese reverse merger


arranged by Hung and American Eastern Securities. In 2007,


American Dairy was the subject of an informal SEC probe due to the


practices of its auditor Murrell Hall McIntosh, an Oklahoma-based


firm that also served as auditor to China Sky.


An internet search shows Downing’s office in City of Industry, CA is


located in a building where Hung’s American Eastern Group and e-


Fang Accountancy Corp. also have offices. E-Fang Accountancy was


China Sky’s first auditor following the reverse merger in 2006. After


e-Fang audited CSKI’s 2006 10-K, the 10-K had to be amended twice,


and the earnings had to be restated. Net income went from $4.3


million to $624,415 following the restatement.


The connection between China Sky, Hung of American Eastern,


Takasima Sporting Goods, and Lailai Capital may seem tentative at


first glance. But there are some facts that make the connection look


rather too coincidental.

The China Sky fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call


transcript states, “…we’ve now expanded sales of Slim Patch into
South Korea and Sudan after engaging PAX-Medicare and Lai Li


Investment Company as exclusive sales agents.” Lai Li Investment


Company, of course, sounds very similar to Lailai Capital


Corporation. (Why any company would be marketing a weight-loss


product in the war-torn Sudan, where there have been recent


reports of extreme famine, is another discussion entirely.)


If you visit the physical address in California where Lailai Capital


and Takasima Sporting Goods have been registered, you will find


that the building is now occupied by a business called Sunpentown. 


Going to the Sunpentown website reveals that the company sells


massage chairs, among other items. Searching for “Sunpentown


Takasima” reveals massage chairs marketed under both the


Sunpentown and Takasima brand names. Going to the website of


the Malyasian Takasima Industries, the company touted as selling


China Sky products, shows that the company lists fitness equipment


as its products, but has advertisements offering massage chairs.


It seems there may be a more than coincidental link between


Takasima Industries, the Malaysian company claimed to be


distributing China Sky products, and Takasima Sporting Goods, the


California business. Given Takasima Sporting Good’s connection


with Hung, and Hung’s deep involvement with China Sky, there is


reason to suspect that China Sky’s reported sales agent in Malaysia


may actually be a related party. If China Sky’s agreement with


Takasima was not made at arm’s-length, it would be cause to doubt


the reliability of China Sky’s reported sales made through Takasima.


Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that China Sky’s new sales


agent for the Sudan, Lai Li Investment Company, may be a related


party as well, given Hung’s involvement with Lailai Capital


Corporation.


Beyond the issue of potentially related parties, there may be reason


to doubt whether the Malaysian company that CSKI refers to as


Takasima Industries could support the level of sales claimed. In


2007, CSKI reported that Takasima’s sales of the Slim Patch were at


least $1 million per month, and more than $12 million for the year,


though the agreement was only signed in March of 2007 (according


to the 10-K), or in February of 2007 or before (according to the press


release).


Financial statements filed with the Malaysian government for


Takasima Industries (M) SDN BHD show that for the twelve months


ended May 31, 2007, Takasima’s revenues were approximately


US$4.0 million and current assets were only $1.8 million (converted


from Malaysian ringgits at 3.40 MYR / USD, current at May 31, 2007).

If Takasima had been meeting the terms of the reported sales


agreement with China Sky, then Takasima should have had at least


US$3 million in sales from March, April, and May of 2007 alone.


Additionally, China Sky’s press release from February 2007 states


that Takasima has “sister companies,” operating under the names


“Takasima Health-Mar, Blueway International and Osiwa (M) Sdn.


Bhd. of Pinway Industries.” Financial statements filed with the


Malaysian government indicate that these “sister” companies were


all dormant in 2007, except Takasima Health-Mar.


In the case of a legitimate company with legitimate auditors, related


party transactions are vetted during the audit. Given CSKI’s


revolving-door audit style (see previous asensio.com report), it is


entirely possible that such vetting was never accomplished or


initiated.
