Initiation of Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) with a Price Target of $14.50 


GlassHouse Research focuses on the target company Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), where 


management has taken significant advantage of its PoC accounting and recognized revenue 


prematurely in their respective long-term contracts. Furthermore, in order to mask true 


economic earnings which have faltered in recent periods, we believe management has 


underfunded some of its key reserves and capitalized recurring expenses.  


• Aerojet’s already anemic backlog suffers a material hit due to adoption of ASU 606: 


o AJRD’s backlog suffered a recent $578 million extraction as the firm needed to 


recognize sales in prior periods due to the ASU 606. We believe sell-side analysts have 


not fully grasped this material headwind to future sales based on their respective 


models.  





• We believe missed milestones and delays have accelerated in the last two years as unbilled 


receivables have skyrocketed and advanced payments have plummeted:  


o Both total and unbilled receivable diagnostics imply that management has been 


recognizing revenue prematurely as clients are not being invoiced at historical rates. 


While management has the subjectivity regarding when to recognize revenue, they do 


not have that same subjectivity when invoicing clients or asking them for cash 


payment. Based on our experience after analyzing Aerojet’s accounting, we believe 


many projects are behind schedule and have missed milestones.  


o Conversely, advanced payments from clients have plummeted over that same time 


period. This suggests that the company’s backlog is of poor quality and is a threat to the 


persistence of earnings going forward.  





• Key reserve accounts have been underfunded, artificially enhancing earnings by over $30 


million (27% of total operating income) over 2017: 


o Deep within the footnotes, we find that two key reserve accounts “reserve for 


overhead rate disallowance” and “contract loss provisions” have been materially 


underfunded over the last two years. Thus, this action artificially enhanced Aerojet’s 


earnings by millions of dollars.  


o Furthermore, AJRD’s expense account has climbed sharply in recent periods 


suggesting a capitalization of normalized expenses.  





• Premium valuation erroneously based on faux earnings is unwarranted given the material 


long-term structural issues and near-term accounting risk: Using a sustainable earnings 


figure detailed in this report, GHR will show why we believe an approximate 53.0% downside 


to AJRD’s current share price is in its future.

Backlog Composition and Organic Growth at Risk Over NTM 


When first looking at Aerojet’s financials, many would see a breakout quarter for the 


company with the firm growing the top line by 21.4% YOY. However, digging deeper into 


the firm’s financials, we have found many unsustainable items that we believe the analyst 


community has missed.  


CEO Elieen Drake discussed the firm’s sales trends in its 05/01/18 Press Release stating, 


“Sales of $492 million grew 21% on a reported basis. Excluding the effects of adopting the 


new revenue recognition guidance, sales growth was 16% in the first quarter, including 14 


points of organic growth after adjusting for the Coleman Aerospace acquisition.”  


Reading further into the recent change in revenue recognition, we find that the firm adopted 


ASU 606’s revenue recognition policy as of 01/01/18. Within this change in accounting policy, 


we believe there are many items that will impact future revenues and earnings that the sell-


side has missed. Below we detail the impacts of this accounting change: 


• Aerojet selected the “Modified Retrospective Method” (over the Full Retrospective 


Method) when adopting ASU 606. The impact will be that new standards and 


contracts initiated after the effective date (01/01/18), and for contracts that have 


remaining performance obligations as of that date, the company will enter an 


adjustment to the opening balance of their retained earnings account. Additionally, 


under this method the firm will not restate comparative periods of its financial 


statements.  





• While this method is easier for companies to adopt, overall this obfuscates true 


comparability metrics as there will be no recast revenue and expenses for all prior 


periods presented in the year of the adoption of the new standard (as in the Full 


Retrospective Method).  





• Furthermore, Aerojet reclassified many of its balance sheet items into “Contract 


Assets” and “Contract Liabilities” which we discuss later in this report. 





• AJRD discontinued the unit-of-delivery revenue recognition method on certain 


customer contracts and re-measured the performance obligations using the cost-to-


cost method. The cumulative favorable impact of the adoption was $37.6 million in 


earnings that was credited to Stockholders Equity.
5 | P a g e  
 


• One area where we believe the sell-side has missed is that, effective on 01/01/18, 


AJRD recognized $578 million of cumulative net sales and correspondingly impacted 


AJRD’s backlog by –$578 million. Therefore, the firm has, in essence, lost $578 


million in revenue to prior periods. While the few sell-side analysts who follow this 


company have adjusted their backlog figures to show this, they have not reduced their 


future sales outlook accordingly.  





• For example, the analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey detailed the following 


regarding AJRD’s outlook, “For 2018/2019 we are now modeling revenue /adj EPS / 


adj EBITDAP of $1.956B / $0.89 / $228.6M and $2.03B / $1.09 / $259.4M, 


respectively, compared to our prior respective estimates of $1.93B / $0.96 / $ 225.4M 


and $2.028B / $1.14 / $251.5M. Jefferies also predicted a modest growth of 1% over 


2018 regarding revenues.  





Backlog Figures Show Anemic Growth Lies Ahead for AJRD:  


While the few sell-side analysts who follow AJRD expected single-digit growth the for next 


two years, our analysis points to a material sales decline. Factors why we believe will cause 


Aerojet’s sales to fall over the next year stem from the following: 


1) Our analysis shows that a depleted backlog that even when excluding the ASU 


606 impact, the firm’s backlog fell 3% sequentially on weak bookings in the period 


of only $370 million (versus $828.2 million in the previous quarter). When 


including the impact of ASU 606, which we believe should be accounted for, this 


caused bookings to be a negative $208.0 million in the period! Again, this means 


$578 million of future sales the company was expected to recognize on the income 


statement over the next year is now gone.  





2) The firm’s 12M book-to-bill ratio has now decreased in six straight YOY periods, 


signaling a decline in contractual support for future revenues (see Table 1).  


Currently this ratio stands at 1.14x, down from 1.17x and 1.40x in Q1 2017 and 


Q1 2016, respectively.
6 | P a g e  
 


3) When focusing in to AJRD’s funded backlog2 (which is a more telling harbinger of 


future revenue versus unfunded), we find that this figure has fallen by 27.3% 


YOY to only $1.6 billion, its lowest value in four years. Relative to total backlog, 


we find the ratio of 41% also to be nearing historical lows. Even when adding back 


the $578 million in recognized revenue, we still find that the funded backlog has 


declined in 9 consecutive YOY periods.   





4) The firm’s contract liabilities continue to dwindle in absolute terms and relative to 


total backlog. These contract liabilities serve as a “down payment” for future 


projects with AJRD. Therefore, as this ratio continues to fall, we would expect to 


see an inverse correlation with AJRD’s cancellation rates with its projects. Here 


we see that this ratio has fallen in 9 of the last 10 periods. In the most recent 


period, this ratio (contract liabilities-to-total backlog) has fallen by 111 bps YOY 


to 4.7%, representing a five-year low and a negative trend in the quality of 


AJRD’s backlog.  





5) Lastly, Aerojet’s spiking unbilled receivables and depleted deferred revenue 


balances suggest delays and missed milestones will cause material top line pressure 


in future quarters (discussed in the next section). 





























                                                           
2 Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and 
contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been 
appropriated).

AJRD’s Percentage-of-Completion Accounting Infers Missed Milestones and Delays 


When analyzing Aerojet’s financials, a key harbinger that accountants/analysts can use in 


order to portend a future sales shortfall lies within its percentage-of-completion (PoC) 


accounting. As a result, we find that AJRD’s receivables (both billed, but mostly unbilled), 


inventories, progress payments, and contract liabilities4 all suggest that the company has 


been less than forthcoming regarding its future outlook. Therefore, GHR’s analysis below 


will elucidate Aerojet’s PoC accounting as we go through salient line items step by step.  





Taking a look at an excerpt from AJRD’s annual report, we highlight the following which 


pertains to our thesis: 





Recognition of revenue and profit on long-term contracts requires the use of 


assumptions and estimates related to the total contract value, the total cost at 


completion, and the measurement of progress towards completion for each 


performance obligation. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated 


total contract value and total cost at completion for each performance obligation 


requires the use of significant judgment. 





                                                           
4 These accounts have been reclassified as “Contract Assets” and “Contract Liabilities” in Q1 2018 related to ASU 
606. 


Consider the software company Transaction Systems Architects, 


which became increasingly aggressive at picking up ever larger 


portions of its revenue at the front end and smaller portions at the 


back end. One sign that helped me discover this behavior was that 


new accounts began appearing on the balance sheet. The is not a 


good sign. Such accounts as unbilled receivables show up on the 


balance sheet… a telltale sign of accounting tricks.

In the Company’s Aerospace and Defense segment, recognition of profit on long-


term contracts requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to total 


contract revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress 


towards completion. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total 


contract revenue and cost at completion requires the use of significant judgment. 


Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised as necessary.  





Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed include, 


but are not limited to: labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the 


work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and 


vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated labor 


agreements, inflationary trends, schedule delays, availability of funding from the 


customer, and the recoverability of costs incurred outside the original contract included 


in any estimates to complete. The Company reviews contract performance and cost 


estimates at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances significantly 


change. When a change in estimate is determined to have an impact on contract 


profit, the Company will record a positive or negative adjustment to the 


statement of operations. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to the 


status of certain long-term contracts may have a material effect on the 


Company’s operating results. [AJRD 2017 10K] 





Reviewing these statements, we understand 100% that these excerpts are fairly boilerplate 


for firms that have long-term contracts. However, where AJRD differs from its peers is with 


respects to its unfavorable trends within its percentage-of-completion accounting. The word 


“subjectivity” is key in the excerpts above as it allows managers (not auditors) within the 


firm to determine its own revenues and profits for each period based on their own estimates. 


Thus, we intend to show in our analysis why we believe managers at AJRD have been 


overly-optimistic in recognizing recent revenues and profits, all at the expense of future 


earnings.  





AJRD’s Changes in Estimates and Assumptions Turn Negative in Q1 2018:  


According to Aerojet, the firm evaluates its contract value and cost estimates for 


performance obligations at least quarterly and more frequently when circumstances 


significantly change. Based on our accounting analysis below, we believe that AJRD is facing 


an ominous period regarding its contracts and performance obligations.  


Confirming this thesis in Q1, we note that for the first time in two years, AJRD management 


chose to reduce their estimates for sales, EBIT and EPS by $7.4 million, $7.9 million and
10 | P a g e  
 


$0.08 per share, respectively. We believe this is just the beginning of unfavorable changes to 


their financials as the firm will face substantial headwinds stemming from its bloated balance 


sheet. Aerojet disclosed that the unfavorable adjustment was due to the following in its Q1 


2018 10Q footnotes: 


The three months ended March 31, 2018, unfavorable changes in contract 


estimates were primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the 


Commercial Crew Development program partially offset by improved 


performance on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (“THAAD”), RS-68, 


and RL-10 programs. 





In the Company’s Aerospace and Defense segment, the timing of revenue 


recognition, customer invoicing, and collections produces accounts receivable, 


contract assets, and contract liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance 


Sheet. The Company invoices in accordance with contract payment terms either 


based upon a recurring contract payment schedule, or as contract milestones are 


achieved. Customer invoices, net of reserves, represent an unconditional right of 


consideration. When revenue is recognized in advance of customer invoicing a 


contract asset is recorded. Conversely, when customers are invoiced in advance of 


revenue recognition, a contract liability is recorded. Unpaid customer invoices are 


reflected as accounts receivable. 





As we can see above, the company records unfavorable estimates based on labor 


productivity, the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed, availability 


and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, etc., but most 


importantly schedule and performance delays. Therefore, through the use of PoC accounting, we 


can analyze if AJRD is staying ahead of its performance obligations or falling behind, which 


we find the veracity of the latter to be true. One significant point GHR needs to convey to the 


reader when looking at our analysis is that AJRD’s problems do not stem from collection 


issues. Instead, their problems revolve around recognizing revenue too early in their respective 


contracts. The end result will be a significant reversal of sales and earnings in future periods, 


where this period may just be the tip of the iceberg.

Unusual Growth in Receivables Poses Significant Risk to Future Earnings:  


• Accounts receivable increased 58.0% YOY to $215.5 million at the end of 2017. This 


was in contrast with the decline of 0.8% in 3M sales (see Table 2). Even when looking at 


the firm’s 12M sales increase of 6.6%, this growth was dwarfed by the over 50% 


increase in AR.  





• As a result, the company’s AR-to-3M sales percentage jumped from just 25.6% at the 


end of 2016 to 40.8% at the end of 2017 (and even more concerning 73.6% in the latest 


period). For additional context, the firm’s ratio stood at 25.6%, 34.8% and 38.4% in 


2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 





• Three-month days-sales-outstanding (DSO)5 also has trended unfavorably, rising 77.1% 


YOY to 43 days, representing a rise of 19 days from the prior year. Furthermore, 


longer-term trends show similar results with 12M DSOs spiking 23.9% to 42 days for 


the company. We cannot stress enough that an increase of this magnitude is extremely 


unusual for a company in this industry based on our experience.  





• Looking into the subcomponents of total AR, we find that the majority of the increase 


in AR was due to double-digit increases in the more concerning “unbilled” receivables 


balance, as discussed in the next section.

12 | P a g e  
 


Net Unbilled Receivables Spike 91.8% YOY in 2017:  


Digging deeper into AJRD’s receivables balance, we find that the greater part of the increase 


was due to a spike in unbilled receivables. Overall, we view the significant increase in 


unbilled receivables relative to revenues as a risk to the persistence of earnings, as 


management uses estimates/subjectivity to determine revenues recognized within the period. 


Moreover, clients that have not yet been invoiced for work/scope may dispute or have claims 


regarding the long-term contract with Aerojet. Thus, the amounts that may end up being 


disputed by clients have already been recorded as revenue by AJRD, but may or may not be 


accepted and paid by the client.  


• Net unbilled receivables (unbilleds) have now increased in six consecutive YOY periods 


and have reached their highest value in any period going back over five years. 


Specifically, net unbilled receivables have increased 91.8% to $152.7 million at the end 


of 2017. As of 12/31/17, unbilleds now accounted for 70.9% of total receivables, again 


another five-year high for the firm. 





• Relative to sales, the trend even looks worse for AJRD. Here, we calculate that net 


unbilleds-to-3M sales have increased 1,395 bps to 28.9% at the end of 2017, or almost 


double the 2016 value of 15.0% (see Chart 1). Long-term figures also exhibit a parallel 


trend growing by 362 bps to 8.1% of 12M sales.  





• Thus, from these ratios, we can estimate7 that due to management’s subjectivity 


regarding its revenue recognition, $67.9 million of revenues were recognized in 2017 


from spikes in net unbilled receivables. Although, this type of financial engineering can 


provide short-term boosts to revenues and earnings, these type of accounting tactics 


ALWAYS reverse badly for companies that employ these shenanigans.  





• Exacerbating AJRD’s revenue recognition issue, GHR also analyzed the firm’s 


“Reserve for Overhead Rate Disallowance”, which serves as a contra-asset to the 


unbilled receivables located deep within the footnotes. Herein, we found that AJRD’s 


reserve for this account has fallen off a cliff relative to unbilled receivables. Relative to 


gross unbilled receivables, we calculate that the reserve fell 1,397 bps YOY to only 


21.9% at the end of 2017. This is down from the 35.9% value reported at the end of 


2016. And as a reference point, this ratio has not stood this low since Q3 2014.  





                                                           
7 This uses the prior year’s baseline of 4.5% unbilled-to-12M sales ratio in our calculation.
13 | P a g e  
 


• If we calculate our own reserve value using last year’s 35.9% as our baseline, we 


calculate that the true reserve balance should stand at $70.1 million, or a $27.3 million 


difference. Thus, by not accurately accruing for its overhead rate disallowance, AJRD 


was able to aid EPS by $0.28 in 2017, or 38% of non-GAAP EPS!  





• We find the deteriorating reserve at a time when DSOs and unbilleds are dramatically 


rising to be highly irregular as we would expect the inverse to be true at Aerojet. With 


the heightened subjectivity revolved around Aerojet’s revenue recognition and 


adjoining reserve, we cannot see conceptually why management would choose to 


decrease the reserve relative to receivables if not to conceal deteriorating financials, 


although we will leave the judgement up to the reader.

Management’s Explanation for Growth in Net Contract Assets Conceal Magnitude of 


Accounting Issues: 


According to management representations and disclosures, the recent $95.4 million 


consumption of cash in Q1 2018 was attributable to 1) and increase of $76.2 million in AR 


due to the timing of net sales, 2) $51.2 million of net cash used on contract assets/liabilities 


primarily due to a decrease in cash advances on long-term contracts and 3) an increase of 


$17.4 million in other current assets primarily related to increases in prepaid expenses and 


cost-share receivables (partially offset by tax items). While this statement is fairly boilerplate 


for the liquidity section of the Q1 2018 10Q, every item discussed in the last excerpt is a 


threat to AJRD’s persistence of earnings, just worded nicely.  


Delving first into the contract asset issues, here is where we believe AJRD will suffer the 


most in the future periods. Also stated in the firm’s filings: 


The three months ended March 31, 2018, unfavorable changes in contract 


estimates were primarily driven by cost growth and performance issues on the 


[NASA] Commercial Crew Development program partially offset by improved 


performance on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD"), RS-68, 


and RL-10 programs. 





While it appears that the delays and performance issues were relegated to only Aerojet’s 


Commercial Crew program, we find it highly peculiar that this was the first time performance 


issues were disclosed within that program; as well as taking an unfavorable adjustment for 


the first time in two years. This is because based on net current asset trends, we believe these 


issues have been prevalent at Aerojet and not just siloed within the Commercial Crew 


program in only the latest period.  


The concurrent rise of unbilled receivables and fall of billings in excess of costs over the last 


two years suggest to GHR that Aerojet has not been reaching its milestones regarding the 


projects they have been working on. Otherwise, their respective client would be invoiced 


(billed) or pay their bill. This would then show up on Aerojet’s balance sheet as a debit to 


cash and a credit to AR, thus bringing their receivable metrics to within historical norms. 


This has obviously not happened at AJRD, in fact the opposite has occurred drawing our 


scrutiny of their future revenues. Thus, the further net current assets trend positively, we can 


ascertain that the respective projects Aerojet are working on will continue to have 


performance issues.
15 | P a g e  
 


We also believe that management has been less than forthcoming with these milestone issues 


as the balance sheet continues to bloat. While management does not give guidance nor have 


quarterly conference calls, on its Investor Day on 05/08/18, the Commercial Crew program 


issues were not discussed, nor any issues regarding their decreased free-cash-flow in Q1 2018 


(AJRD burned through $99.5 million in FCF while only spending $4.1 million in CapEx in 


Q1 2018).  


GHR cautions that the delays encountered with the Commercial Crew project (and suspected 


others) exacerbated our concerns regarding the rise in unbilled AR and decline in deferred 


revenues. Such delays can foreshadow increased costs and lower profits, as well as a higher 


risk of disputed billings. And with the firm already reducing its estimates for the first time in 


two years in Q1 2018, this may be an adverse harbinger of things to come in 2018. 








Change in Accounting Classification Obfuscates True Balance Sheet Line-Items:  


At the start of 2018, AJRD adopted new revenue recognition guidance (related to ASC 606), 


where the company made certain reclassifications to its balance sheet to conform to the new 


guidance. As a result, the firm reclassified $151 million of net unbilled receivables and $117.1 


million of inventories into a new line-item called “Contract Assets”. However, now 


obfuscating AJRD’s financials, unbilled receivables will now no longer be separated out from 


inventories in the footnotes. For completeness, we note that billed AR would still be held as a 


separate line item on the balance sheet.  


Another new line-item added to the balance sheet is the inverse “Contract Liabilities”, which 


is made up primarily of AJRD’s old “advanced payments” and “contract related liabilities” 


line-items. The firm’s billings in excess of cost and estimating earnings (AKA advanced 


payments) represent advances from customers, which may exceed costs incurred on certain 


contracts. This payment is important because just like a down payment on a house, this 


payment locks in the client for future revenues depending on the size.  


Below we can see from our analysis, that in the first period of 2018 many of our 


aforementioned concerns continued to deteriorate at the company. In fact, we believe over 


the next three periods, AJRD will continue to have substantial negative estimates to 


earnings as they work through many of their delays and missed milestones. 


• When analyzing AJRD’s contract assets (CA), we find that this line item (made up 


mostly of unbilled receivables and inventories) has increased in six consecutive YOY
16 | P a g e  
 


periods by an average of 26.3% YOY. Specifically, this account has ballooned to $266.0 


million (see Chart 2), although this might not be entirely noticeable to the novice 


analyst as this is a new line-item on the balance sheet.  





• On the other side of the balance sheet, we even find further discord with the firm’s 


dwindling contract liabilities (CL), or advanced payments. Concern regarding quality of 


revenues comes from a 13.6% YOY (23.2% QOQ) decline in contract liabilities at 


03/31/18. This stands in contrast with recognized revenues, which increased by 21.4% 


YOY in Q1. As a result, CL-to-3M sales plummeted by 1,751 bps YOY (919 bps QOQ) 


to only 43.2%, representing a five-year low for the company.  





• Finally, when analyzing net contract assets (NCA), which is calculated as CA – CL, we 


calculate that NCAs turned positive (an unfavorable trend) in Q1 to $53.4 million. 


Ceteris peribus, a company that has negative NCAs (or a positive current liability 


balance) suggests its persistence of future revenues and earnings remain strong. Also, 


these companies will have strong free-cash-flow generation. Here, with AJRD we find 


the opposite to be true.  





• At the end of Q4 2015, we calculate that AJRD reported a net contract asset balance of 


–$81.0 million. However, since this time we find these balance sheet items to be 


trending unfavorably over time to reach its current balance of +$53.4 million (see Chart 


2). 





• Relative to sales, we find the situation to be more ominous at the company. To 


illustrate this, we calculate NCA-to-3M sales increased by 996 bps to 10.9%, 


representing the highest ratio reported in the last five-years (an unfavorable trend).  





• Finally, deep within the footnotes, GHR finds that AJRD has consistently been 


drawing down its “Contract Loss Provision”, which is a sub-component of Other 


Current Liabilities. Analyzing this data dating back to 2014, we find this provision had 


a robust value of $15.0 million. Since this time, AJRD managers have been drawing 


down this reserve account to a five-year low of $3.8 million as of 12/31/17. 





• Relative to advanced payments, we find that this ratio also hit a five-year low of 1.6%, 


again substantially down from the 12.3% percentage reached in 2014. To elucidate on 


the subject conceptually, this provision is needed to reserve against losses in contracts 


related to advanced payments. Therefore, with contract liabilities taking a tumble over
17 | P a g e  
 


the last two years, we would expect this provision to increase, not to materially decline 


as it has.  





• Its overall decline is a transitory reduction of expenses on the income statement that we 


view as unsustainable. Our own calculations, using the prior year’s provision-to-


advanced payments ratio of 3.1% as a baseline suggest the firm reduced its expenses by 


$3.5 million in 2017. Or in other words, management artificially inflated its EPS by 


$0.04 (5.0% of non-GAAP EPS) over 2017 just by using this accounting gimmick!

Unusual Growth in Prepaid Expenses Insinuate Future Margin Compression  





In general, we view growth of prepaid expenses and other current assets ahead of revenue 


and/or total operating expenses as a potential indicator of excess costs stored on the balance 


sheet (i.e., excess relative to their expected future benefits). Regardless of whether the build-


up occurred as a result of deterioration in (macro or micro) economic circumstances or a 


relatively higher rate of capitalization (slower amortization) than in prior periods, the end 


result is the same. Absent similar growth in revenues, margins will decline as these costs 


must ultimately be amortized against earnings.  











• GHR has observed a consistent rise in prepaid expenses (prepaids) located in the 


“other current assets” footnotes in AJRD filings. In Q4 2015, the company reported a 


balance of only $11.9 million, however since then, this balance has increased in a stair-


step fashion up to $31.3 million in the latest period (see Chart 3). In Aerojet’s 


footnotes, the firm reported an astonishing 84.1% YOY jump to its current balance 


with no explanations given in the latest 10Q. An increase of this magnitude with no 


clarifications we find to be highly peculiar, especially with a blessing from Aerojet’s 


auditor.  





• More importantly, prepaids have outpaced both 3M and 12M sales on a YOY basis in 


seven consecutive periods. As a result of the recent growth in this account, prepaid 


expenses are up 217 bps (65 bps) YOY to 6.4% (1.6%) relative to 3M sales (12M 


Capitalizing expenses is the easiest way for CEOs and 


CFOs to create faux earnings in any given period. 


Prepaid expenses never get discussed on conference 


calls as analysts are too busy digesting 


management’s guidance and updating their models.  





In our experience, it is the perfect account that no 


one looks at to manipulate.
19 | P a g e  
 


sales). Both these ratios are at their respective five-year high showing the severity of 


this unusual increase. 





• We find similar results when the level of prepaids is measured against total operating 


expenses (rather than revenues). For instance, prepaids jumped 74 bps YOY to 1.8% 


of 12M operating expenses (a five-year high). Again, analyzing shorter-term patterns, 


prepaids also increased 241 bps YOY to 7.0% (a five-year high), of total three-month 


operating expenses.  





• To quantify the rise in prepaid expenses relative to earnings, we calculate that if 


Aerojet would have kept the prepaid-to-12M sales ratio constant at its Q1 2017 


percentage of 0.9%, the company would have to reduce its EPS by $0.13 over the 


TTM. This EPS value also equates to 16.0% of TTM non-GAAP EPS.

Subjective Short-Term Performance Incentives Drive Motivation to Manage Earnings: 


After analyzing the firm’s Proxy Statements, Summary Compensation Table & Performance 


Goals, we find that AJRD uses a combination of EBITDAP, cash flow from operations and 


bookings as measures for the Named Executive Officers (NEOs) annual incentive plan. This 


is what we believe drives a high motivation to manage earnings to the upside. Especially, 


when the bonuses are based on easily manipulated EBITDAP.   





• According to AJRD’s 2017 Proxy Statement, CEO Eileen Drake derives approximately 


79% of her salary from stock awards, options, and non-equity incentive plan 


compensation. Thus, a material portion of Ms. Drake’s salary depends upon the 


performance goals given by Aerojet. The same is true for COO Mark Tucker (71.6% of 


salary is performance driven), and CFO Paul Lundstrom (70.7% of salary is 


performance driven) who does not appear to be a CPA or has obtained a license in his 


career.  





• We find this telling that a company that must deal with many complex accounting 


issues in this industry would not have more experienced accounting professionals in key 


positions. Searching through the firm’s proxy, we find that the only CPA in a key 


position is director James Perry, who is also the head of the Audit Committee. 


However, overall, we would hope to find more experienced accountants at this 


company due to the complex nature of percentage-of-completion accounting.  





• Below is Aerojet’s annual incentive excerpt from its 2017 Proxy: 








• As we can see, large percentages of each NEOs pay comes from these short-term 


incentive goals that focus on EBITDAP, CFOA, and bookings. Zeroing in on
21 | P a g e  
 


EBITDAP, we see that in 2017, Aerojet’s NEOs had a threshold, target, and maximum 


performance goals of $192.5 million, $213.9 million, and $256.7 million, respectively.  





• Actual performance was reported as $232.7 million in EBITDAP for 2017. This eclipsed 


their target amount of $213.9 million by 8.8% for the year. However, when taking into 


account many of the easily manipulated reserves such as the unbilled AR overhead rate 


allowance, contract loss provision, and the unusual rise in prepaid expenses, this figure 


falls well below its intended target. When accounting for our adjustments, we find that 


this value plunges to only $187.7 million in 2017.  This even falls below the firm’s stated 


threshold value of only $192.5 million. Again, we point out throughout this report how 


easy it is for managers in these highly subjective accounts to veer them to benefit the 


company’s financials in the short-term (as well as benefits the NEOs bonuses).  











• We find a similar situation in FY2016, where managers had incentive EBITDAP goals 


of $244.9 million (threshold), $272.1 million (target), and $326.5 million (maximum), 


respectively. Luckily, for Aerojet managers that year, they were just able to be out 


their target goal with reported EBITDAP of $273.1 million.  





• When factoring in the same three accounts discussed above, we find that Aerojet would 


again miss its target EBITDAP with our calculated amount coming in at $261.6 


million.8 Thus, AJRD’s managers would have suffered a material decrease in incentive 


pay as a result of normalizing these accounts to historical standards.  





• Overall, we believe that when a company offers such short-term performance goals, it 


leads to the cutting of many corners and is counter-intuitive to the long-term health of 


the firm. Plus, many of these accounts that have deviated from historical norms, will 


now reverse violently as a headwind to the firm’s financials going forward. 


                                                           
8 This adjusts for AJRD’s unbilled AR overhead rate allowance of –$5.4 million, prepaid expenses of –$4.2 million, 
and contract loss provision of –$1.9 million.

AJRD’s Share Price Premium is Based on Unsustainable Earnings  


Based on the aforementioned EPS adjustments, we believe that our changes to Aerojet’s EPS 


figures create a more sustainable form or true economic earnings figure that investors should 


rely upon. Additionally, we used our adjustments to come to a sustainable EBITDAP figure as 


well. Below, the reader can see the EPS and EBITDAP adjustments made that were detailed 


throughout the report. 





Table 3: Calculating 2018 Sustainable EPS and EBITDAP  








Again, while the sell-side community continues to value AJRD by the company’s stated 


measure of non-GAAP earnings and “adjusted EBITDAP,” we at GHR believes the 


company’s true economic earnings can be better estimated using our sustainable adjustments 


detailed in our report. We believe these accounting reversals are not well understood by the 


sell-side and material headwinds to revenues and earnings will be the end result. Basing our 


valuation on our sustainable forward EPS of $0.60 and EBITDAP of $187.7 million for 2018, 


we believe a fair share-price for the firm stands currently at $14.50, which represents a 53% 


downside to the current share-price.  





In light of our concerns regarding a bloated balance sheet that has spiking unbilled receivables 


and prepaid expenses, diminishing advanced payments, and vastly underfunded reserves, GHR 


finds the current stock price to be highly egregious. Furthermore, we see added risk regarding 


the company’s depleted backlog and organic growth figures. Accordingly, we are initiating 


coverage on Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc., with a target price of $14.50.
