CITRON COMMENTS ON
MOBI CALL AND PIPER
NOTE — AND REITERATES
PRICE TARGET OF $3.


Update:  May 4, 2011: post-
Conference Call Comments:
 


.


In its research note this morning, Piper Jaffray
raised their target for MOBI from 12 to 15, stating
concerns for its fundamentals are “overblown”. 
 Citron calls Piper liars and challenges them on this
issue.


What is the truthful Company Description?


(We removed the Piper commentary — as
expected Piper required that we take down their
research page.  )


Piper’s note repeats MOBI’s claim that “It
operates the leading mobile app store in
China.”


This statement is not true.  The company CFO
claimed it was based on “independent” research,
but on today's conference call, admitted it was a
2009 study commissioned and paid for by the
company.

If Piper cannot describe the company accurately,
they have no business claiming to publish analysis
of it, much less raise multiples or targets.


As the links on the Citron report (below)
demonstrated yesterday, this claim by MOBI is
100% FALSE.   Even the company has
backed off that language in its company
description in today’s PR.  Citron challenges MOBI,
or Piper for that matter, to show a single credible
and independent source verifying that MOBI’s app
store is in fact the “top mobile app store in China”
– or in the top 10, for that matter.


If in fact the they were the #1 mobile app store in
China, it would only prove the obvious – that they
are doing a very bad job of monetizing it! 
 If they were what they say, their revenues
would be ramping sharply through the roof
right now, while the cheap feature phone market
is at its peak.


Instead, revenues were flat to lower last quarter,
and will apparently not materially improve this
quarter.   Meanwhile, it's their expenses that are
ramping sharply higher as they add headcount to
service their patchwork “payments network”.


In light of these obvious facts, Piper’s justification
for raising its target is to …. (drum roll) …
increase the multiple?!?  Talk about "nothing
new"…!  Not on Wall Street.   


  Piper says "Nothing new"  and Citron agrees


Piper says there is "nothing new" …  A statement
we agree with.  It is the same company that
couldn’t make payroll just eight months ago until
its IPO got done at $8, and traded thereafter at $6
per share.  Its not generating new revenue or
profits either.  Its competitive position with regard
to the China mobile handset market isn't new since
then. 


We challenge anyone to argue that the future
penetration of feature phones is going to be
greater than that of smart phones in China.

Citron has great respect for Gene Munster.  We are
surprised and disappointed that this piece of
sloppy research would go out with his name under
it.


 


  MOBI’s market in their own words


MOBI states that their market is composed of
“young, uneducated and poor” Chinese youth.  The
CFO got excited describing his market buying
"virtual homes and virtual furniture".


Wake up people!  Their market can’t buy real
furniture, but they’re going to spend increasing
millions in MOBI’s virtual fantasy world? 


The CFO also commented people don’t like to pay
for game apps on Android – they like the free ones
– but still claims they’ll be paying up for games on
Maopao – real soon now!


 


  Future of mobile phone business in China


This is the future of mobile phones in China,
and it is foolish to pretend otherwise:

It is obviously the platform that developers are
clamoring to make their hot new games for — a
large, worldwide market, not a niche market held
captive between China wireless operators and
certain handset manufacturers.


  MOBI claims it is a technology company


Look at their R&D spend last quarter and the last
year.


Citron sticks to its opinion that MOBI addresses a
low-spending niche market in China, with a rapidly

obsolescing technology platform which has already
seen its best days, and reiterates its generous $3
target.


Citron asks Piper – what is the expression for
“buggy whip” in Chinese?


  Cautious investing to all….. and be
particularly skeptical of pied pipers!


 


Original report:


Citron Reports on Sky-Mobi
Limited (NASDAQ:MOBI) With a
Price Target of $3….read to
understand.
 


Citron Research understands and respects the
recent surge in pre-eminent Chinese internet
stocks.  While the financials of many of these
companies might not be compelling today, some
offer unique business models and the potential to
establish their dominant competitive positions in
their spaces, driven by China’s rapidly growing
internet user base.  Whenever you get these
manias, many companies “ride along on the
coattails”.   In the case of Sky-Mobi  Limited
(NASDAQ:MOBI) the company has manipulated
the truth to hide their dying business model.


What MOBI Is:


Sky-Mobi sells games and other applications for
low-end “feature phones” (i.e NON-smart-phones)
in China.  Their non-game products include chat
applications for several social network websites.


The company currently has no position in the
smart phone or high-end cell phone business.  The
company operates an application store, but so
does every major cell phone manufacturer.   


Nokia and Android-based phones are garnering
major market shares in the high-end and smart-

http://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-sky-mobi-limited-nasdaqmobi-with-a-price-target-of-read-to-understand/ 5/15


phone markets, where MOBI does not compete…
and leaves it facing irrelevance.


What MOBI Is Not


MOBI is not a leading application store in China. 
Even more important, MOBI is not a play on the
Chinese mobile internet / social networking
market.  MOBI is not a tech company and does
not have market share or disruptive technology. 


The stark reality is that “feature phones”, which
MOBI's business addresses, are inexpensive
phones that DO NOT browse the internet, DO
NOT have maps, GPS  or local search, and are
not capable of forming social networks, or
participate in locally targeted crowd marketing
apps like Groupon.  They enable Chinese feature-
phone users to text-chat with one another while
playing simple graphical games on small screens. 
Users can also post text messages onto certain
social network platforms like Facebook and Twitter.


Within the next couple of years, a new and
cheaper generation of larger screen touch-screen
Android-based smart-phones will sweep into the
China cell marketplace, delivering this
functionality.  MOBI is just another wannabe in this
market.  There is no investment thesis in MOBI
gaining a foothold in this new market against
many better-capitalized competitors from its
current business model.


IPO or Bust – (It was the bust)


The first sign of trouble with MOBI was evident as
its IPO date approached.  In the same week that
YOKU and DANG represented some of the hottest
IPOS of 2010, the Sky-Mobi IPO was a total dud.


First, the IPO, which attempted to raise $150
million
[http://www.avcj.com/avcj/news/1899843/sequoi
backed-sky-mobi-files-usd150-million-
nasdaq-ipo] had to settle for $58 million (gross)
due to lack of demand , but even so, pricing had to
be set at the low end

[http://seekingalpha.com/article/241194-

12-11/china-s-sky-mobi-bona-post-biggest-
1st-day-u-s-slumps-of-2010.html] ,
contending for the record of the worst IPO first day
performance of 2010.  Then, it fell a further 20%
in the following days (during the extremely strong
December 2010 rally).   There was just no demand
for this stock, and it bottomed around $5 a share. 
 


The problems at MOBI were evident as stated in
this article from a China Tech Journal, which stated
that MOBI better go public now and raise money
because their business was about to be made
obsolete.

"Sky's not a good time, Song Tao said that
the company unable to pay wages for
several months, has been exhausted state."
— translation courtesy of Google Translate


(Song Tao is MOBI's Founder, Chairman, Chief
Exec. Officer, Member of Audit Committee and Member
of Corp. Governance & Nominating Committee) 


Conclusion:  Some companies go public to thrive,
but Sky-Mobi went public to survive.  This was just
five months ago….has anything really changed?


 
How the Company is Lying to Investors


MOBI claims to be the “largest App store” in
China.  THIS IS A LIE – It is not even close to
the truth.   Here is the real list of top App
stores in China:

MOBI also claims that it is a leading mobile
social network in China….another lie.  Here’s
the list of top social networking sites in China …

Or even among the top 15 here:

Here’s what they say in their own filings about
their nascent attempt to stimulate social network-
based business:


“We anticipate that community-based applications with
social network functions, such as mobile social games,
will generate an increasing percentage of our revenues
in the foreseeable future. However, we began
operating pilot test mobile social games in 2008 and
only have limited experience in this area.” 
(emphasis is Citron’s)


 


Metrics Show Lies … and Doom


"Figures don’t lie, but liars figure." – Samuel
Clemens


In MOBI's most recent fiscal quarter, ending March
2011, it claims its registered members roll has
grown from 12.5m to 58.6m — a stunning
increasing of 368.8% year over year. Is it too good
to be true?   Sorry, it is.


The problem with its “registered members” is that
the number of inactive members is growing even

http://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-sky-mobi-limited-nasdaqmobi-with-a-price-target-of-read-to-understand/ 8/15


faster.   MOBI’s filings don’t compute the number
of inactive members, but it does count “active
members”, using a very weak definition.  To be
counted as “active”, a member has to visit their
app store just two times during the same month
– and ONLY FOR ONE MONTH in a three month
reporting period.    Nevertheless, while their active
user count grew 10.64% q over q, their
“inactive” (or staled out) members grew
35.2%, to a whopping 47.6 million.  Yes folks,
the little number they don’t disclose is that 83%
of their “registered members” are inactive,
even by their own weak definition of “active
membership”. 


This demonstrates that “membership doesn’t have
its rewards” when it comes to MOBI.  The notion
that members somehow comprise a nascent pool
of monetizable online community is an
intentionally created mis-perception.  In English
we call that a lie.


Not to mention that cell phone sales in China grew
57% in 2010, mostly smart-phones.   It is tough to
believe that MOBI during that time could grow
members 400% — exclusively from non-smart
phone users.

As we saw this week with the restated Renren user
numbers, it is not uncommon for Chinese internet
statistics to exaggerate membership numbers.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/business/global/02


The disconnect between perception and reality is
clearly outlined in MOBI’s reported numbers.   For
example, the company typically makes headlines
out of huge percentage gains in non-monetizable
(and notoriously unreliable) numbers such as
numbers of downloads.   But they don’t mention
that average revenue per download has

The company has become a financial disaster since
IPO — and it wasn’t so great beforehand.


The most charitable way to spin these changes is
that the company is already experiencing “the law
of large numbers”, in a sector subject to brutal
competition, short-lived fads, and a roar of
competitive “noise”.   Its most profitable days were
when it was operating on a shoestring with very
limited capital, with a couple of hot game titles. 


More likely, it was a very poor candidate for IPO,
and is now relegated to a small niche in the cell
phone add-on space which has already seen its
best days.   Even after doubling headcount over
the last year, they have been unable to ramp
revenues; while they face plateau'd revenues,
they're absorbing declining margins on every front.


Financials are terrible compared to KONG


At its peak last week, MOBI sported a market
valuation north of $700 million dollars with $79
million dollars in cash, and no long term debt.
  KONG had a market valuation of around $325
million dollar with $157 million dollars in cash and
3.5 million USD long term debt.   MOBI and

KONG’s respective enterprise values are $621
million and $172 million. Even though MOBI
commands a hefty valuation when compared to
KONG, it doesn’t appear MOBI has a substantially
different business model from KONG

MOBI sports an enterprise value more than twice
that of KONG, but KONG shows it is a better
value by every metric of revenue and profit, both
for the most recent quarter and year.    In fact,
KONG is valued at 1.14 times its 2010
revenue while MOBI is valued at 7.7 times its
2010 revenue – over 6 times higher!


EVEN though Kong is a better business, (it
sells some iPhone games) if we were
generous to MOBI and gave it the same
valuation as KONG at 1x revenue, the stock
price would be $3  – Hence our target.


Risks all over the business …read for
yourself.


Citron knows what normal risk factors look like. 
Most companies state the boiler plate language
that we see over and over.  But not MOBI — at
least they were honest about the risks.  If you
read the prospectus you see a company that is
being attacked on all sides of their business model.

Squeezed by the Cell Phone Companies:


“Such measures make it more burdensome for users to
purchase applications and content through our
application store. As a result, some users purchased
fewer applications and less content through Maopao or
even ceased purchasing. In addition, when more SMSs
need to be transmitted to effect the same volume of
transactions, we face more billing and transmission
failures. All these adversely affected our revenues. In
addition, in September 2010, China Mobile began
implementing another set of new measures which
require users to send triple confirmation SMSs before a
transaction can be effected.”


Hurt by the handset manufacturers:


 “Handset companies often pre-install other mobile
application stores in addition to Maopao, which could
adversely affect purchases of applications and content
on Maopao, resulting in a decrease in our revenues. In
addition, certain handset companies may consider
entering the mobile application store market, and our
relationships with such handset companies may be
adversely affected as a result.”


Problems with billing:


“These situations are known in the industry as billing
and transmission failures. In the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2010 and the six-month period ended
September 30, 2010, the monthly MR amounts we
received from mobile network operators were
approximately 20% to 30% lower than the monthly MO
amounts recorded on Maopao …”


Competition they can’t overcome:


“New technologies in our industry could render the
technologies and product offerings that we are
developing or expect to develop in the future obsolete
or uncompetitive, thereby potentially resulting in a
decline in our revenues and market share.”


Then on April 27, Nokia invaded their space:

http://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-sky-mobi-limited-nasdaqmobi-with-a-price-target-of-read-to-understand/ 14/15


http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/226
[http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/22


Which all leads to the key statement:


“Our failure to anticipate or successfully implement
new technologies could render Maopao uncompetitive
or obsolete, and reduce our revenues and market share.”


If this it wasn’t onerous enough, MOBI is in the
shadow of the PRC government regulators too.   To
create an alternative to being dependent on billers
to collect user fees, MOBI created its own form of
payment, called “K-Currency”.


“Our item-based revenue model may cause additional
concerns with PRC regulators who have been
implementing regulations intended to limit the total
amount of virtual currency issued by online game
operators and the amount of purchase by an individual
game player. The restrictions imposed by the above
rules may result in lower sales of our virtual currency,
and could have an adverse effect on our revenues from
games. If our operations or the applications and content
on Maopao are deemed to have violated any of these
rules and regulations, we may be subject to penalties
and our results of operations may be materially and
adversely affected.”


Conclusion


The company reports just one more time – next
week – before expiration of MOBI’s (six month)
stock lockup looming just next month. 


Citron believes that this company is doomed and
will eventually trade below whatever cash they
might have left.  This is a terminal business
model.  How does one say buggy whip in Chinese?
