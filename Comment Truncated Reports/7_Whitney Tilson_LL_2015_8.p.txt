Lumber Liquidators Is Evil
Mar. 23, 2015 8:50 AM ET246 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Lumber Liquidators is knowingly endangering the health and safety of its customers,
especially children, by continuing to sell toxic Chinese-made laminate.


The only word to describe this is evil.


Please sign a petition calling on the company to stop selling this laminate.


On its web site, it’s falsely assuring its customers that this laminate is “100% safe”.


The Chinese mills that are providing Lumber Liquidators with toxic laminate are very
open about it – and to get safe laminate only costs ~10-15% more.


As I've written in my five prior articles, I've believed for nearly a year that Lumber
Liquidators was selling its American customers hundreds of millions of square feet of
laminate flooring sourced in China that contained high levels of formaldehyde, a
dangerous chemical and known carcinogen - and that senior executives knew (or should
have known) this.


But until recently, I viewed this as run-of-the-mill bad behavior - the kind of thing I've seen
dozens (if not hundreds) of times in my dozen years of short selling. Maybe the board and
senior executives at Lumber Liquidators were foolish, naïve, and/or willfully ignorant
enough that they could plausibly claim not to know what was going on right under their
noses.


No longer. Their behavior since the 60 Minutes story aired on March 1st has led me to the
inescapable conclusion that Lumber Liquidators is evil.


No, I didn't check with my lawyer before publishing this and, yes, I'm sure he's cringing as
he reads it because it increases the odds that the company sues me for libel. But to be
libel "a claim must generally be false" - and my statement isn't, as there's simply no other
word than evil for a company that continues to sell a product that it now knows with
certainty is violating California Air Resources Board (CARB) standards and is threatening
the health and safety of its customers, especially children.

Here's what Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the world's leading experts on exposure to toxic
chemicals, said when 60 Minutes showed him test results regarding the formaldehyde
level in a typical home with Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate flooring:


I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky because it would
increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a person's lung function,
increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce symptoms in everyone but
children will be the people most likely to show symptoms at that sort of level.


Moving from the theoretical to the actual, here are some of the awful symptoms that have
been reported just in the last nine days on a single web site by Lumber Liquidators’
customers:


…our dogs have developed allergies and my youngest daughter who will be 4 in
August has been running fever like an off and on switch every few weeks she runs a
high fever for a couple of days then she's OK until the next episode. I'm not sure if this
has to do with the flooring. I'm almost speechless on one hand I want to rip the floor
out on the other we don't have the money to put flooring back in...So at this point I'm
not sure what to do.
I had head and chest congestion the whole time we were installing the floor. My friends
teased me that maybe I was allergic to the floor. I was at the doctors so many times
that he sent me to an allergist. Severe symptoms subsided when we finished putting
down the floor. But I still use an inhaler when I exercise.
My symptoms are burning eyes and nose and coughing up phlem at night. Also have
itchy skin. My two dogs also cough. I thought they had kennel cough, but now think it is
the flooring… Open your windows and air the place out frequently, especially before
bed. Then pray this gets settled soon as I read that the off gassing can last 10 years.
I was doing some reading of scientific papers on this formaldehyde effects, wondering
two things. 1. Could my tremors that I have had for the past few month be related to
this? Sadly, yes. It also cause neurological damage. 2. How long does outgasing go on
with a product like laminate flooring. Bad news again. It was estimated to be in the 10
year range.
…we have had boughts of sore throays, burning eyes and my son and I always have
stuffy, runny noses.
…the itching was so sever I literally had scratches all over my body - it was insane…
…my husband…has had MAJOR skin issues…
…our children and dogs and I have had multiple issues…
My husband has had major skin issues since installation (he installed it).

Price Slashing and Lies to Lure Customers to Buy Its Laminate 


Lumber Liquidators has a big problem: it has bloated inventory levels overall – $314
million as of the end of 2014, equal to six months of sales – and I estimate that at least
10% of this, or $31 million, is Chinese-made laminate, for which demand has surely
declined dramatically. As discussed earlier, rather than doing the right thing and halting
sales of this toxic product, the company is determined to keep selling it, so it’s adopted a
dual strategy. First, it’s slashed prices, with a focus on its laminate flooring, as you can see
by comparing the company’s home page 10 days ago vs. today (I’ve posted both here;
one can’t tell which laminates are Chinese-made, as Lumber Liquidators – surprise! –
doesn’t disclose this, but I suspect most are). Here are two screenshots of the laminate
sections of the current web page:

Lumber Liquidators’ second strategy to move its toxic laminate is to lie to its customers by
telling them “our laminate products, all of our products, are 100% safe.” As part of this, the
company has added the following in the past week to every page on its web site on which
laminate is sold (click here for one example):


It is unbelievably foolish of Lumber Liquidators to do this because it's provably false (CEO
Rob Lynch on the company's recent conference call admitted that "We know that [CARB's]
tests on some deconstructed samples have had elevated levels [of formaldehyde]…"), and
thus it dramatically increases the company's legal liability and reputational damage. So
why is Lumber Liquidators doing this? It can only be the result of pure desperation.
They're violating the first rule of holes: when you're in one, stop digging! But nooooo,
they're digging themselves deeper and deeper with reckless decisions like this. From the
perspective of a short seller, this management team is the gift that keeps on giving.


Chinese Mills Openly Sell Non-CARB-Compliant Laminate


With all the debate over testing methodologies/deconstruction, whether CARB will take
action, how much formaldehyde are Lumber Liquidators' customers actually being
exposed to, what harm has resulted, etc., I think the single most important thing in the 60
Minutes story is being overlooked: that at all three mills 60 Minutes' undercover
investigators visited:

Employees at the mills openly admitted that they use core boards with higher levels
of formaldehyde to make Lumber Liquidators laminates, saving the company 10-15
percent on the price. At all three mills they also admitted falsely labeling the
company's laminate flooring as CARB 2…


This is the elephant in the room. In light of this (and the company's lack of any sensible
alternative explanation), how can anyone doubt even for a moment that Lumber
Liquidators has been selling non-CARB 2-compliant laminate for quite some time - and,
shockingly, continues to sell it this very day!


Chinese mills producing non-CARB 2-compliant laminate shouldn't be a surprise to
anyone because the mills are completely open about it. In fact, someone who reached out
to me after the 60 Minutes story aired, who's very credible and knowledgeable about the
industry, shared with me an email he received from one of his suppliers (which happens to
be one of the mills shown on the 60 Minutes segment), in which the Vice President of the
mill offers to sell him laminate and gives two prices: one for safe laminate with
formaldehyde levels below the limit set by CARB and one for toxic laminate that doesn't
comply (for a lower price of course). Here is the key part of the email:


I think it will be good manner to solve this problem of the carb2 boards.


When u be here we can talk about it, ok?


Now customers need the carb2 need to add 0.5usd/Sqm.


Here's what really boggles my mind: this email was sent seven days after the 60 Minutes
story exposed that the mill was selling non-CARB 2-compliant laminate - they're not
ashamed of it; rather, they're perfectly open about it.


It's also powerful evidence that, while Lumber Liquidators can show lots of paperwork from
the Chinese mills and testing facilities attesting to CARB 2 compliance, the company in
fact knew exactly what it was buying in China - and, in turn, selling its customers.


Here's the extended excerpt from the 60 Minutes transcript:

Employees at the mills openly admitted that they use core boards with higher levels
of formaldehyde to make Lumber Liquidators laminates, saving the company 10-15
percent on the price. At all three mills they also admitted falsely labeling the
company's laminate flooring as CARB 2, meaning it meets California formaldehyde
emissions standards, and the new U.S. federal law.


At this factory, the general manager told investigators Lumber Liquidators is one of
their biggest customers.


[Manager: This is a best-seller for Lumber Liquidators.


Investigator: For Lumber Liquidators?


Manager: Yeah.


Investigator: How long have you been selling this?


Manager: From last year.


Investigator: Is this CARB 2?]


CARB 2 means it's compliant with California law. But listen to what the general
manager told us.


[Manager: No, no, no... I have to be honest with you. It's not CARB 2.


Investigator: Can I get CARB 2?


Manager: Yes, you can. It's just the price issue. We can make CARB 2 but it would
be very expensive.]


And that's the same thing the undercover team was told at all three mills they visited.


[Investigator: All this stuff here, Lumber Liquidators... All their labeling is CARB 2
right? But it's not CARB 2?


Employee: Not CARB 2.]


Conclusion


What Lumber Liquidators is doing is obvious, it's evil, and must stop immediately.
