The Tile Shop: Poisoned Tile, Bad Actors, Unsustainable Margins, And
A Stock Ready To Crack
Oct. 21, 2013 10:15 AM ET56 comments
by: Infitialis


Acting on a whistleblower tip, the Infitialis Research Collective has invested several
months' time investigating The Tile Shop's (NASDAQ:TTS) business operations and
miraculous stock market rise. Frankly, we were shocked at the extent of management
malfeasance uncovered and the clear and present danger this company represents to the
public at large.


1. After listing via a SPAC a little over a year ago at $10.00/share, Tile Shop's share price
has increased more than 2.5x to all-time highs on the back of the Company's suspiciously
high EBITDA margins, aggressive growth plan to more than triple its store count, and
heavy cheerleading from sell-side analysts


2. However, independent laboratory testing results indicate a significant number of The
Tile Shop products have DANGEROUS lead contaminations, up to 13,900% greater than
the United States' Consumer Product Safety Commission limits for products that come in
contact with children


3. The Tile Shop's lead contaminated products represent a clear and present danger to
consumer safety as the tiles are recommended for kitchen and bath installation in close
proximity to food prep and shower areas, significantly increasing the probability of lead
transmission to children


4. In addition to consumers abandoning The Tile Shop due to significant concerns about
product safety, the liabilities associated with any potential product recalls, regulatory
investigations, and class action litigation could swamp the company's very limited liquidity
and less than $3.8mm in available cash


5. The company's current management team is wholly unfit for public company
stewardship with a Founder/CEO convicted of FRAUD and the SVP of Operations is
presently out on PROBATION.


6. The Tile Shop's LTM EBITDA margins of 27.0% is more than 2x its peer comparables
and will compress due to its reliance on mickey-mouse Chinese suppliers and increasing
overhead costs

7. The Tile Shop's plan to more than double the historical store expansion rate appears
nothing more than a scheme to jack the share price based on the false mirage of growth
as opposed to creating long-term value for all public shareholders


8. The Chan Brothers, with their dubious and notorious lineage in Hong Kong real estate,
have been selling down their ~30% ownership stake in The Tile Shop acquired for $12mm
at $10.00/15.00/24.25 per share and will likely dump more on the market when their
current 150 day lock-up agreement expires at the end of the month


Long investors in The Tile Shop should consider immediately reducing the position as
public dissemination of these dangerous lead concerns will likely lead to a massive
correction in the company's stock price. Speculative investors should consider a short
position in The Tile Shop as it appears overvalued on a fundamental basis at 23.9x
FV/EBITDA and 55.8x P/E consensus FY13 sell-side estimates and the issues uncovered
in this report will likely accelerate a pricing correction.


The Tile Shop Business Introduction


Founded in 1985 by current CEO Mr. Robert Rucker with a single store in Rochester,
Minnesota, The Tile Shop ("Tile Shop" or the "company") is currently one of the largest
specialty retailers of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance
materials, and related accessories in the United States. As of June 30, 2013, the
Company had 75 stores in 25 states with an average footprint of 23,000 square feet.


After going public via a SPAC on only 08/22/12 at $10.00/share (it never would have
passed a convention IPO due diligence process), Tile Shop's share price has increased
more than 2.5x to all time highs on the back of the company's aggressive growth plan to
more than triple its store count, shockingly high EBITDA margins relative to its
comparables, and heavy cheerleading from sell-side analysts, including Credit Suisse
adding the company to its "Top U.S. Investment Ideas List" on 09/05/13 with $31 PT. With
equity investors blindly bidding up all stocks related to the United States residential

housing "recovery," The Tile Shop shareholders have ignored critical questions about the
history of the business operation and the safety of the products that have allowed the
Company to earn shockingly fat margins.


Currently trading at 23.9x FV/EBITDA, and 55.8x P/E consensus FY13 sell-side
estimates, The Tile Shop's market valuation is egregiously rich before even considering
the significant business issues discussed in this report. Moreover, the current consensus
sell-side financial estimates will become unreliable once consumers abandon The Tile
Shop in droves due to very serious health and safety concerns about the company's core
tile products.


DANGEROUS Levels of Lead Contamination in The Tile Shop Products - Significant
Recall, Remediation, and Class Action Risks


The Tile Shop claims to be able to earn sustainable EBITDA margins of >25%, more than
2x its similar big-box home improvement competitors, because its "Vertically Integrated
Value Chain" allows it to "minimize cost, maintain quality, and reduce risk." Specifically,
approximately 58% of The Tile Shop's purchased products are sourced from Asia, and
primarily from three Chinese suppliers of dubious lineage based on PIERS U.S. customs
import data.

Moreover, as part of its consumer advertising campaigns, The Tile Shop repeatedly
stresses that its unique sourcing process allows it to guarantee "the finished product is
inspected to ensure quality control" and "always made to our high standards, at every
stage of production." However, the Company's boisterous claims appear to be nothing
more than a dangerous form of unsubstantiated puffery because independent laboratory
testing of The Tile Shop products raises serious concerns about significant lead
contamination of the tiles sold in its stores throughout the United States.


Independent Lab Tests Indicate DANGEROUS Lead Contamination In Tiles

We recently acquired a variety of tile samples from the company's retail locations in the
critical East Coast, Midwest, and Western regions of The Tile Shop's geographic footprint.
After the tiles were individually logged/ tagged, split-sampled, , and bagged, the samples
were dispatched to a United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and
ISO/IEC 17025 accredited independent laboratory for lead concentration testing utilizing
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved methodologies. The independent
laboratory testing results are simply shocking and indicate a significant number of The Tile
Shop tile products currently being sold to consumers and installed in homes have
dangerous lead concentrations significantly higher than the CPSC total lead content limit
as of 08/14/11 of 100 parts per million (ppm) for products that come in contact with
children.


Selected Independent Laboratory Lead Testing Results


Significance of Lead Contamination in Tiles


The Tile Shop's products appear to present a significant health risk for multiple reasons.
First, as a reminder of basic high school chemistry, lead is a heavy metal that is toxic for
humans, and is associated with lowered levels of learning, impaired hearing, brain
damage and, at high levels, fatalities in children. Second, The Tile Shop specifically
advertises its products for kitchen and bath applications, dramatically increasing the
probability of lead transmission to humans, and specifically children, once the tile is
installed because of the direct contact with food preparation areas in kitchens and with
bare skin in bathrooms via floors, shower-stalls, etc. Finally, as The Tile Shop encourages
DIY installations, there is a significantly greater probability the homeowner will create
excessive amounts of lead-contaminated dust and spread these dangerous lead
contaminations throughout their home as part of the tile fitting, cutting and installation
process due to a lack of hazardous materials handling training and experience.

Business and Liability Implications of The Tile Shop's Lead Contamination


As DIY customers become aware of the significant potential health and safety risks of
installing lead contaminated tiles from The Tile Shop in their homes, the economic
consequences for The Tile Shop will be catastrophic. Customers will simply purchase tiles,
a fungible commodity product, at other established retailers, such as Home Depot and
Lowe's, which utilize robust sourcing processes and procedures to ensure the safety of
products on their shelves, which will kill The Tile Shop's future revenue, cash flow, and
store expansion plans.


In addition to the catastrophic effect on The Tile Shop's future earnings potential, the
company will face a potentially paralyzing drain on its liquidity as it resolves the effects of
the lead-contaminated tiles already in its inventory and installed in customers' homes. As
of 06/30/13, The Tile Shop reported $58.7mm of inventories, or more than 25% of its total
assets, all of which should be tested for lead contaminants, and the contaminated product
will have to be responsibly disposed. More significantly, as of 06/30/13, The Tile Shop had
only $3.8mm in cash and equivalents available, yet is burdened by $98.6mm in debt,
capital leases, and deferred rent obligations. A product recall and replacement inventory
expenses could quickly swamp The Tile Shop's already stretched liquidity and put it in
violation of its debt covenants, quickly precipitating a bankruptcy filing.

Even more serious than the lead-contaminated inventory issue, The Tile Shop faces
potentially crippling liabilities from regulatory actions and class-action lawsuits regarding
damages associated with its sale of lead contaminated products. For example, The Tile
Shop may be liable for the removal, remediation, and replacement of lead-contaminated
tiles sold during its 28 years of sourcing tile from China. Previous class-action cases for
China sourced and other lead-contaminated products have been for tens to hundreds of
millions of dollars, including Mattel's lead contaminated toys, $80mm for sulfurous drywall
installed in homes in Florida, and the $200mm suit against WASA for lead contamination
in drinking water.


Bad Actors - Founder/CEO Convicted of FRAUD, SVP Currently on PROBATION


The Tile Shop currently has a very thin management bench as it is still undergoing the
painful transition to overcome its prior "material weaknesses" on internal controls as a
family operated business to a publicly-traded corporation. Moreover, the prior history of
the current management team should raise significant concerns for investors based on
their track record of fraud, criminal behavior, and business failures.

CEO/Founder Convicted of FRAUD


On 09/26/05, Mr. Robert Rucker, Founder/CEO, was convicted of fraud in a civil case with
his ex-wife for misrepresenting and failing to disclose information relating to the financial
condition of The Tile Shop to a neutral business appraiser retained to value the Company

as part of their divorce proceedings. In the fiery post-trial ruling, Judge Kaman of the
Minnesota Civil Court awarded Katherine Rucker pre-judgment interest, costs, and
disbursements of an additional $4.2mm (vs. the original $2.4mm divorce settlement) in
light of Robert Rucker's fraudulent behavior and disingenuous scheming in a ham-fisted
scheme attempting to minimize the compensation paid to the mother of his child.


To fully understand the fraud conviction against Mr. Robert Rucker, Founder/CEO, it is
useful to review the dramatic saga of The Tile Shop business. Founded in 1985 with a
single store in Rochester, Minnesota, Mr. Robert Rucker had a 50% equity interest along
with his partner and CFO, Mr. Rodney Sill, who owned the other 50% equity interest. On
04/06/00, Mr. Robert Rucker filed for divorce from his wife of 24 years, Ms. Katherine
Rucker, and a neutral business appraiser was jointly retained to value their marital assets,
including the 50% equity ownership of The Tile Shop, as of 12/31/00, when the Company
had 14 stores in the upper Midwest.


As part of purportedly neutral business appraisal process, Mr. Robert Rucker "provided
false and misleading information as well as financial records that were intentionally and
fraudulently altered to cause The Tile Shop's appraised value to be grossly understated
for the purpose of the divorce." Mr. Robert Rucker supervised his attorney and employees
as they created a "doom and gloom" financial forecast that in his own words was the
"worst possible damn scenario" to be shared with the neutral business appraiser.
Specifically, The Tile Shop financial forecast Mr. Robert Rucker represented as accurate
for FY01-FY03 had the store count remaining static at 14, annual revenue barely growing
from $46.9mm to only $49.6mm, gross margins shrinking a dreadful 710bps from 61.2% in
FY01 to 54.0% in FY03, and net income before tax dropping from $2.9mm in FY01 to
$2.3mm in 2003. Based on the financial forecast Mr. Robert Rucker represented as being
truthful and accurate, the 50% equity interest in The Tile Shop was valued at $7.125mm,
or $1.02mm per store on an enterprise value basis.


As the neutral business appraisal process was being completed for the divorce, Mr.
Robert Rucker was simultaneously utilizing for business planning a second set of
significantly more bullish financial forecast that were not shared with his wife, which
forecast $6.9 mm of net income in FY01 while also engaging in lease discussions to open
as many as 6 new stores the instant the divorce was finalized. According to The Tile
Shop's FY01 audited financial statements, the company generated $51.8mm in revenue
and $6.7mm in net income before taxes. In other words, the internal financial forecast that
Mr. Robert Rucker possessed and utilized, but fraudulently withheld from the neutral
business appraiser, were almost perfectly accurate.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1757132-the-tile-shop-poisoned-tile-bad-actors-unsustainable-margins-and-a-stock-ready-to-crack 8/31


Almost two years after the divorce was finalized, Ms. Katherine Rucker became aware of
her ex-husband's skullduggery regarding The Tile Shop's financial forecast and filed a
fraud upon the court civil action in the Hennepin County District Court in Minnesota. After
a bench trial in March 2005, Judge Kaman found Mr. Robert Rucker guilty of fraud by
misrepresenting or failing to disclose information relating to the financial condition of The
Tile Shop to the neutral business appraiser as part of the state court supervised the
divorce proceedings. Judge Kaman thereafter redistributed the value of The Tile Shop as
a marital asset and awarded Ms. Katherine Rucker an additional $4.2mm in pre-judgment
interest, costs, and penalties based on the revised appraisal utilizing the correct financial
forecast, for $30.7mm enterprise valuation or an implied $2.2mm per store (including
penalties and interest due).


In summary, it is shocking to see the CEO of a $1.5bn Nasdaq company was convicted of
fraud just a few years ago for intentionally mis-marking The Tile Shop financials in a ham-
fisted scheme attempting to minimize the lawful compensation paid to the mother of his
child. Moreover, even under the revised valuation of The Tile Shop imposed by the court
after the fraud conviction of Mr. Robert Rucker, each store was valued at only
approximately $2.2mm including penalties and interest due, versus the $19.1mm valuation
the equity market currently ascribes to each of the Company's stores and the $1.4mm new
store opening cost described by the current Tile Shop management team.


Senior VP of Operations Currently on PROBATION


After Founder & CEO Mr. Robert Rucker, the second-highest compensated executive in
FY12 was Mr. Joseph Andrew Kinder, the Senior Vice President - Operations, who took
home $1.96mm in total compensation, including base salary, bonus, and options awards.
Starting as a Sales Associate in one of the original Tile Shop locations in 1993, Mr. Kinder
rose through the ranks to become Mr. Robert Rucker's right-hand man, overseeing all
distribution/manufacturing and managing the international purchasing reportedly critical to
The Tile Shop's outsized margins. However, Mr. Kinder's failure in oversight to prevent the
significant lead contamination in The Tile Shop's products sold to consumers is not
exceedingly shocking considering he is currently out on PROBATION until next year after
getting involved in a domestic dispute and altercation with responding police officers. After
screaming "F*CK YOU, I can't believe you called the cops" at his wife in front of their two
young children upon the arrival of the police, Mr. Kinder was arrested and charged with
two gross misdemeanors (a felony charge, for Domestic Assault - By Strangulation, was

eventually dropped). In addition, Mr. Kinder appears to have been previously indicted for a
DUI in Minnesota in 1993, which provides further evidence of his criminal behavior, poor
decision making, and general lack of self-control.


If Mr. Kinder has a similar behavioral outburst over the next few months and gets his
probation revoked, he will be returned to Culver County Jail (where he has already served
three days as part of his conviction) to complete the remainder of his sentence, making it
nearly impossible for The Tile Shop's "vertically integrated value chain" to continue to
operate after losing this key-man.


Finally, although on 10/01/13 The Tile Shop announced it had hired Mr. Chris Homeister,
age 44, as Chief Operating Officer for an annual base salary of $300k, his previous
experience at the failing retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) does not inspire much confidence
in his ability to effectively manage a retail growth strategy or effectively supervise Mr.
Joseph Kinder. Moreover, the hiring of Mr. Chris Homeister appears to have effectively
demoted Mr. Carl Randazzo, the current Senior Vice President - Retail, who has been with
the company for more than 20 years and previously reported directly to Founder/CEO Mr.
Robert Rucker. While at Best Buy, Mr. Chris Homesiter spearheaded their disastrous
venture into the pawnshop industry to buy/sell used video games like GameStop
(NYSE:GME) and attempted restructuring of the Rhapsody RealNetworks Best Buy Digital
Music Store (a purported iTunes competitor). Neither of these unsuccessful ventures
appears remotely applicable to a DIY tile retailer. Moreover, this announcement may be
indicative the Company's Founder/CEO, Mr. Robert Rucker, is looking to spend more time
at his Hawaii beach-house with his new wife, Ms. Lee Shoon, and less time continuing to
nurture growth at the Company as a hands-on manager.

Unsustainable Margins for a Commodity Product: Significant Near Term Pricing and
Cost Pressures


Tile is a classic fungible commodity product (assuming it is not contaminated with
dangerous amounts of lead). Once purchased or installed, it is virtually impossible to
determine if a tile was sourced from a commercial flooring supplier, big-box home
improvement supplier, or a DIY consumer retailer like The Tile Shop. The Home Depot
(NYSE:HD) continues to roll out its "Expo" format stores and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is
making significant investments in store refurbishments, both of which features full room
vignettes similar to The Tile Shop. More importantly, The Home Depot and Lowe's, despite
their significantly larger economies of scale in sourcing and existing nation-wide
geographic footprint, are happy to earn 13.2% and 10.6% EBITDA margins, respectively,
versus The Tile Shop's 27.0% LTM EBITDA margins. The consumer tile sector is
becoming more price-competitive as more price discovery occurs on-line and the

Company's margins will dramatically compress if they continue to attempt to gain market
share. In summary, The Tile Shop is not selling stretchy yoga pants or iPads à la $LULU
or $AAPL; it's colored tile.  


In addition to revenue pricing pressure from larger-scale and better capitalized nation-wide
incumbent home improvement retailers, The Tile Shop is also facing significant margin
pressure on the cost side. In the last quarter alone, it hired an additional 22 people as
corporate staff (which is expected to adversely affect margins by 200bps going forward) to
help complete its corporate infrastructure after the prior "material weakness" issues with
financial reporting. In addition, The Tile Shop recently announced a $1.0mm advertising
venture (~17% of FY12A net cash flow) with Pocket Hercules. Shareholders should review
the sample "Naked Guy in Shower Advertisements" developed by The Tile Shop
management team to determine if they believe this venture to be the best use of the
Company's limited funds and if it will be accretive to net margins.


Finally, in an apparent attempt to pull forward sales to hit its 3q13 revenue and same-store
sales growth numbers for sell-side expectations, The Tile Shop ran, in quick succession,
several heavily promoted discount sales at the end of last month. On September 22-23, all
floor and wall tiles were 15% off in all stores for a "Fall is Beautiful Sale" and on
September 26, an flash sale offered 25% off on all online purchases. This margin dilutive
cannibalization of future quarters sales is extremely toxic to the business prospects of the
Tile Shop and should give current shareholders significant concern about the long-term
earnings potential of the business.

Unsustainable and Unachievable Store Expansion Plans


Much of the current investor excitement regarding The Tile Shop revolves around Wall
Street expectations of the Company rapidly increasing its store count. Since its founding in
1985, The Tile Shop has generally funded its annual single-digit store expansion to
adjacent geographic areas by utilizing organically generated internal cash flow. This
historical rate of expansion has allowed it to optimize the capacity of its regional
distribution centers (critical for the significant transportation costs of heavy tile) and
perform adequate site diligence on potential retail locations demographics and potential
tile demand to ensure the long-term business success of the store.

However, since going public, The Tile Shop management team has turbocharged Wall
Street expectations to expanding to 140-150 stores as a "near term opportunity" over the
next few years and reaching >400 stores thereafter. Rapidly increasing the rate of its
geographic footprint expansion will likely be dilutive to the Company's business operations
as it 1) expands into marginal locations with lower annual earnings potential, 2) in-fill
stores will cannibalize existing store sales (for example, the new stores opening this fall in
Norwalk and Danbury CT, respectively, are less than 30 miles apart and are also very
close to the existing store in Scarsdale, NY, and 3) the dramatic increase in store
openings is outstripping the supply of its experienced Assistant & Head Store Managers
ready to move to a new location and handle the start-up a new store, which will
dramatically decrease customer satisfaction and critical repeat and referral sales.


After reviewing The Tile Shop saga and management's turbo-charged store expansion
plans, investors would be wise to review the trajectory of a similar SPAC-funded disaster:
American Apparel. After completing a SPAC listing in December 2006 with Endeavor
Acquisition Corp (which ironically utilized the same IR firm as The Tile Shop: ICR Inc.),
shares initially popped on investors excitement of management's promise to open >800
stores worldwide , but slowing SSS growth and management issues precipitated a
dramatic decline in the share price and multiple near-bankruptcy rescue financings.
Moreover, store count has actually declined over the last few years and is now below 250.


Moreover, prudent investors should not rely upon The Tile Shop's store expansion plans at
face value based on the prior history of broken promises and fraudulent
misrepresentations by CEO/Founder Mr. Robert Rucker. For example, on 03/06/01 and

04/07/01, despite operating only 20 stores at the time, The Tile Shop indicated, in order to
increase its working capital facility, with Wells Fargo, the Company's primary bank, it
planned to operate 50 stores by no later than January 1, 2005. In actuality, it took The Tile
Shop until the end 2011, nearly 6 years after its original bank forecast, and despite
purportedly robust financial results between 2005 and 2011, to open its 50th store. Based
on The Tile Shop's management team's prior track of providing fraudulent and misleading
financial forecasts in an attempt maliciously achieve its internal goals, it seems prudent for
investors to heavily discount The Tile Shop's purported store expansion plans currently
built into the share price.


Landmines Abound: Dubious SPAC History with $450mm Valuation, Material
Weaknesses, and Chan Brothers'/Nabron Lock-Up Expiration


First, because The Tile Shop elected to access the public equity markets via a SPAC
transaction on 08/22/12 at $10.00/share as opposed to a traditional IPO listing process, it
is important for current investors to contemplate the structural considerations of this
alternative financial product. Because of the relatively short and defined time period
available for a SPAC to source and execute a transaction or face liquidation, the
management teams are often rushed to complete any potential acquisition by a drop-dead
date, despite whatever last minute due diligence concerns arise during closing. As a result
of this adverse selection bias for acquisitions, the average return for the 111 SPACs
between 2004 and 2013 which successfully acquired a company was -14.4%, according
to SPAC Analytics. By contrast, the Russell 3000-stock index returned +5.9% in that same
period. It's not just that SPAC returns are terrible. There have been some spectacular
failures and frauds, which have completely wiped out equity holders, as SPACs have
rushed into market fads like energy, water, and China.


For The Tile Shop, the SPAC due diligence process appears extremely rushed and the
sellers valuation range is extremely concerning relative to the current market price.
Between 05/08/12 and 06/27/12, less than 50 calendar days, the entire transaction
structure was negotiated, due diligence was purportedly completed, and the merger
agreement was executed. More concerning for current Tile Shop stockholders, the sellers
of the company, including Mr. Robert Rucker, were willing to entertain merger discussions
as low as $450mm in enterprise valuation (9.0x expected EBITDA for 2012) versus the
current $1,431.8mm market enterprise price (23.9x street EBITDA expectations for 2013).
Moreover, The Tile Shop was adequately capitalized at the time of the merger to allow Mr.
Robert Rucker to continue the historical organic store expansion rate of 5-8 new stores

per year and no other stockholders had an apparent rushing need to monetize their
investment in the company. What does Mr. Robert Rucker know that the market is
currently not considering?


Next, during 2012, The Tile Shop's auditors identified several material weaknesses in their
financial reporting, including, but not limited to, a lack of sufficiently competent personnel,
a lack of financial close processes, and deficient financial reporting systems to ensure the
accurate and timely reporting of the Company's financial results. While The Tile Shop has
supposedly remediated these issues after hiring Mr. Tim Clayton as CFO, investors would
still be prudent to review the Company's reported financials with appropriate skepticism in
light of the management team's limited public company experience, rapid business
expansion, and historical issues. For example, since The Tile Shop allows unlimited
product returns without any restocking fees (unlike any of its peers and potentially allows
the Company to pull forward phantom revenue and SSS growth metrics), can investors
really have robust confidence that the $58.7mm in purported inventories (~25% of total
assets and growing faster than sales) as of 06/30/13 is ready to be sold to customers,
instead of being contaminated with lead and/or consisting of boxes of broken, chipped, or
discolored returned tiles from previous failed renovation projects?


Lastly, the Ronnie and Gerald Chan brothers of Hong Kong currently control ~22.5% of
The Tile Shop's equity via their Bahamian shell company Nabron International, Inc. After
acquiring an original 30% equity interest in The Tile Shop for only $12.0mm in total
consideration in October 2002 (for an approximately $2.2mm per store enterprise
valuation versus the current market valuation of $19.1mm per store), they have been
highly motivated sellers at $15.00/share and $24.25/share of the Company since going
public via the SPAC at $10.00/share. As their 150-day lockup from the most recent
secondary share sell-down expires at the end of this month, it would not be surprising if
they dumped a significant portion of their remaining $360mm equity value ownership stake
on the market (~60 days trading volume) at these current stratospheric valuation levels. In
addition to the share overhang, the Chan Brothers' intertwined involvement in the situation
raises further questions about the Company's lead contaminated tile product sourcing
relationships in China in light of the numerous accusations of their involvement in
significant corruption and fraud throughout Asia. Overall, this situation appears
disturbingly similar to Enron Corporation, where Mr. Ronnie Chan served as a Board of
Directors and Audit Committee member leading up to its infamous Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing and was selling shares for his personal account up to the firm's sordid collapse.

Directors and management team members have been selling shares and indicating more
shares are forthcoming over the next 90 days via multiple form 144 registrations.

Valuation: The Tile Shop Trades at an Unsustainable Premium to its Comparables
and Intrinsic Value


Currently trading at 23.9x FV/EBITDA and 55.8x P/E consensus FY13 sell-side estimates,
The Tile Shop's market valuation appears egregiously rich relative to its public
comparables in the home improvement retailer, "best-in-class" consumer product retailers,
and high-growth retailer sectors, which trade at a median of 11.0x FV EBITDA and 20.5x
P/E consensus FY13 estimates. In light of all the serious business issues identified earlier
in this report, The Tile Shop's current premium valuation appears completely
unsustainable.


The Tile Shop Trading Comparables


In addition to the significant trading multiple premium to comparable peers, The Tile Shop
is also trading at a significant premium to its DCF intrinsic value. For example, even under
exceedingly bullish scenarios of continued double-digit annual revenue growth with
