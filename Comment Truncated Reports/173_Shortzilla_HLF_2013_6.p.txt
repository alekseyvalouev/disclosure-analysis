Robert Walter, an attorney we respect, provided a very thought provoking comment on our
Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) report titled "Did Herbalife Repurchase Shares While in Possession
of Material Non-Public Information".


Based upon Robert's comments, we realize that providing further information, to
supplement our report, is necessary.


Robert's comment included:


Your post may not be correct. It is not clear whether HLF used a 10b5-1(C)
plan to engage in the repurchases…. If HLF did use a 10b5-1 plan, the only
requirement concerning non-public information is that HLF cannot have had
possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan was
adopted (July 30, 2012).


Robert's observations hit the nail on the head, especially as they pertain to the possibility
that Herbalife repurchased its shares pursuant to a 10b5-1 Trading Plan.


In an effort to better inform our readers, we present the following.


Note: Source for the following is the Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC").


10b5-1 Trading Plans: As adopted, paragraph (1)(I) sets forth an affirmative defense from
the general rule, which applies both to individuals and entities that trade. To satisfy this
provision, a person must establish several factors.

· First, the person must demonstrate that before becoming aware of the
[material non-public information] information, he or she had entered into a
binding contract to purchase or sell the security, provided instructions to
another person to execute the trade for the instructing person's account, or
adopted a written plan for trading securities.  
 


· Second, the person must demonstrate that, with respect to the purchase or
sale, the contract, instructions, or plan either: (1) expressly specified the
amount, price, and date; (2) provided a written formula or algorithm, or
computer program, for determining amounts, prices, and dates; or (3) did not
permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when,
or whether to effect purchases or sales; provided, in addition, that any
other person who did exercise such influence was not aware of the
material nonpublic information when doing so.  
 


· Third, the person must demonstrate that the purchase or sale that occurred
was pursuant to the prior contract, instruction, or plan. A purchase or sale
is not pursuant to a contract, instruction, or plan if, among other things, the
person who entered into the contract, instruction, or plan altered or deviated
from the contract, instruction, or plan or entered into or altered a
corresponding or hedging transaction or position with respect to those
securities.


Section of Rule 10b5-1 can be used by a company to defend against allegations of
repurchasing shares while in possession of material non-public information, but only if the
company can prove:


(1) that it established the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (governing the repurchase of its
shares) at a time when it was not in possession of material non-public information; and,


(2) that the Rule 10b5-1 Plan met all the requisite requirements above, including, but not
limited to, the second provision above which provides that the Rule 10b5-1 plan


"did not permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over
how, when, or whether to effect purchases or sales".
