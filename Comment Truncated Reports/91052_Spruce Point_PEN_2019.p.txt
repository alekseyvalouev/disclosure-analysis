iRobot / IRBT Maxar / MAXR BazaarVoice / BV


Report Nov 2018, Mar 2019 Aug 2018 May 2012


Enterprise Value $2.0 billion $6.3 billion $1.2 billion


Company 
Promotion / 


Situation 
Overview


Premium robot vacuum protected against 
cheap, low-end competition. New revenue 


streams from robotic mop and robotic 
lawnmower will continue to drive high-teens 


sales growth.


Satellite cycle expected to improve in H2 FY18 
while $60-120M of M&A synergies provide 
tailwind. Expanding commercial business 


opportunity combined with increasing ability to 
compete for U.S. government business.


Disruptive provider of social commerce solutions 
that help clients capture, display and analyze 
online word-of-mouth, including consumer-


generated ratings and reviews


Our Criticism Increasingly high-end competitors taking share 
in robot vacuum space and pressuring ASPs. 
History of failures in non-vacuum products 


suggests inability to grow mop sales or 
successfully launch lawnmower. Rising DSIs 


suggest financial strain. Distributor 
acquisitions obscure underlying sales declines.


MDA’s acquisition of DigitalGlobe driven by need 
to cover problems in satellite business. Brazen 


accounting scheme including inflation of 
intangible assets and overstatement of non-FIRS 


EPS. Dangerously levered at 5.8x when off-
balance sheet liabilities are taken into account. 


Impending asset impairments.


Our research revealed that BV’s solution was 
nothing more than a money losing, rapidly 


commoditized service that would not scale. Its 
IPO prospectus was littered with social media 


buzz words at a time when Facebook was being 
taken public, and $25 analyst price targets would 


prove unrealistic.


Successful 
Outcome


Disappointing sales growth due to slower-
than-projected robotic mop sales. Gross 


margins continue to decline due to increasing 
competition at both the low and high end of 


the market. FY outlook lowered.


Maxar made several attempts to “refute” our 
conclusions, yet share prices have fallen 90% 


since our report on impairment losses (validating 
our concerns), significant revenue misses, and 


dividend cuts. 


BV’s CFO and CEO eventually resigned and its 
share price fizzled to low single digits before


ultimately being acquired for just $5.50/sh, 54% 
below its $12 IPO price and 70% below our 


initiation price.

Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Sees 40-55% Downside Risk
($85-$110 Per Share) In Penumbra (PEN) Shares


• Wave Of Competition Entering Penumbra’s Vertical For The First Time: Penumbra was the first to market with an AC cleared by the FDA for treatment of acute ischemic 
stroke. Major medical device companies left the space alone for most of the 2010s, instead focusing their efforts on stent retrievers – the standard of care in mechanical 
thrombectomy until recently. However, now that aspiration thrombectomy for ischemic stroke has gained wider acceptance as a cheaper (by 30-50%) and sufficiently-
effective approach, four major device companies have entered the space within the last two quarters. 


• Rapid Pace Of Market Share Loss Deeply Misunderstood By Market: Analysts have grown to understand Penumbra as a dominant player in its vertical, with ~90% share. 
While they recognize that competition is coming, they have no historical basis for modeling the pace of market share loss, and appear to assume only low-to-mid single-
digit annual losses through the coming years. IQVIA Medical Device and Supply Audit (MDSA) data, which project nation-wide sales for individual medical devices from a 
panel of 650 U.S. hospitals, indicate that, even as the mechanical thrombectomy market grows, Penumbra is losing U.S. share so rapidly that monthly unit sales have been 
DOWN through 5 of the last 6 months, with monthly declines of up to 28%. Our conversations with doctors corroborate this data, with many neurosurgeons indicating 
that, over just the last 6 to 9 months, they have shifted from using Penumbra in 70-90% of neuro aspiration therapy procedures to just 10-30% of these procedures.


• Penumbra’s Core “Device” A Commoditized Plastic Consumable Sold Cheaply By Competitors: While Penumbra has had the only AC approved for acute ischemic stroke 
treatment through most of the 2010s, ACs are functionally little different from intermediate guide catheters, mechanical thrombectomy accessories priced 75% or more 
below ACs. Many doctors have used these catheters as “off-label” ACs due to price differences or product preferences. Large medical device companies will have, and 
have had, little trouble entering the market with products already equivalent or superior to Penumbra’s. They also sell their ACs in bundles with SRs and other adjacent 
products, which support per-item savings of up to 33%. Penumbra – an almost purely AC-driven company with a poorly-rated “3D separator” SR and few other products –
cannot offer similar bundles and is likely to experience significant pricing pressure as the sector migrates to this purchasing model.


• Promotional And Aggressive Management Playing Defense Against Slowing Growth?: Industry contacts indicate that management is highly promotional and liberal in 
their spending on medical professionals. Open Payments data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reveal that Company spending on doctor travel 
reimbursement – often to sites like Las Vegas and Miami – is unusually high. They have also granted an unusually large quantity of stock to non-employee doctors, which 
we find suspicious for a young medical device company which has been eager to find clinical support for its products. Further, we observe hallmark executive actions 
which may signal a coming sales slowdown: rising DSOs, non-core M&A / distributor acquisitions, hyping up secondary businesses, and aggressive stock sales.


• A Commoditized, One-Product Company Valued As A Growth Story: PEN is valued on par with high-tech medical device companies with significant IP protection. PEN’s 
products are far more commoditized and subject to competition, which it is now experiencing for the first time. Valuing PEN in-line with a more appropriate peer universe 
of commodity producers would reduce PEN’s multiple from 10x to 5-6.5x FY20 sales. Even bullish sell-side analysts have an average price target 7% below current levels as 
valuations have climbed to nosebleed levels through the past several weeks. Spruce Point sees 40-55% downside ($85-$110) in the stock after adjusting future sales 
growth to reflect the onset of competition and applying a more reasonable 5-6.5x FY20 sales multiple.


Penumbra, Inc. (“PEN” or “the Company”) is a one-trick-pony surgical instrument company which, in our opinion, produces a low-tech and 
undifferentiated product in an increasingly competitive space. Penumbra was first to market with an aspiration catheter (“AC”) FDA-approved to 
treat acute ischemic stroke (“AIS”). Major medtech companies have entered the space within the last 9 months and, per the medical community, 
offer neurovascular ACs at least as good as Penumbra’s at far superior economic terms, often as part of discounted bundles. While analysts are 
aware of the new competition, they seem blind to the pace of Penumbra’s market share losses: IQVIA transaction data reveals that its U.S. neuro 
AC sales growth has contracted in recent months. Heavy competition and a limited TAM will also curtail peripheral AC sales – a revenue stream 


which analysts see as a major growth engine for Penumbra. Non-core M&A, distributor acquisitions, and rising DSOs suggest that management –
which has a history of promotional activity – may be reaching to defend its medtech hype train as competitors eat at Penumbra market share. We 


believe that underestimated competition could cut Penumbra’s expected sales growth by nearly half in FY20, from 20% to close to 10%.

IQVIA: Evaluating Shifting Market Share With 
Hospital Transaction Data


In order to evaluate recent changes in aspiration catheter market share, Spruce Point obtained recent hospital transaction data from IQVIA. IQVIA 
– formerly IMS Health and Quintiles – is a publicly-traded healthcare data analytics and technology services company which serves the life 


sciences sector. It collects and analyzes data on pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electronic medical records, and a wide range of other life 
sciences topics to provide medical professionals, researchers, salespeople, executives, and others with relevant insights on healthcare-related 


topics. Using IQVIA’s Medical Device and Supply Audit (MDSA), we were able to evaluate sales trends for all neurovascular mechanical 
thrombectomy devices through May 2019. The MDSA records 100% of medical device purchases by 650 non-federal, short-term acute care 


hospitals in the U.S. and, from this, projects nation-wide sales (in both units and dollars) on a SKU-level basis for nearly 3,000 medical device 
companies. This allowed us to study shifts in aspiration catheter market share on just a two-month lag.


It is important to note that, to our knowledge, this data is known to very few market participants: it is designed for and provided primarily to the 
health care industry. Our understanding is that it is known to few, if any, sell-side brokerage firms. It is also priced to a corporate end market and, 
as such, is likely too expensive for all but the largest of buy-side firms. We believe that the market is generally blind to this data, and that prices 


of Penumbra shares must adjust to reflect this powerful, credible, and compelling information.

Year-over-Year Growth in Monthly Units Sold


Market Data Corroborates Penumbra’s 
Dramatic Market Share Loss


Spruce Point’s analysis of recent market data confirms that Penumbra is, in fact, rapidly losing share in real time. IQVIA MDSA data show that, as 
of May – the last month for which data is currently available – monthly sales of Penumbra’s neurovascular aspiration catheters have declined 


year-over-year for five of the last six months. Penumbra’s growth trajectory appears to be losing steam so rapidly that its rate of growth has not 
only slowed, but has turned negative in a neurovascular mechanical thrombectomy market which is itself growing at 20-40% per year.

Neurovascular Mechanical Thrombectomy Treatments (U.S.)
Year-over-Year Growth


We find it striking that Penumbra’s 
apparent unit sales growth in the 


neurovascular aspirator vertical has been 
negative even as the mechanical 


thrombectomy market grows at a brisk rate


While prior declines indicated by IQVIA did not translate into negative sales growth, it does appear to reflect recent sales growth decelerations 
directionally, and could provide context for the recent pickup in DSOs. Do stretched receivables suggest that the indicated decline in AC 


transactions could translate to observable trends in Penumbra’s financial statements on a lag? Did international sales cover up U.S. declines?

Apparent Sales Decline Coincides With Wave Of 
Competitive Entry


We note that the sales decline indicated by the transaction data coincides with the H2 2018 FDA approval of multiple neurovascular aspiration 
catheters by competitors. Importantly, the accompanying onset of new competition is also visible in the transaction data. IQVIA began to capture 
sales of Medtronic’s React 68 neurovascular aspiration catheter in Sep 2018, the first quarter during which Penumbra sales began to show hints 


of slowing down in the data set. This strengthens our belief that the observed slowdown in Penumbra sales in the transaction data is in fact a 
realistic representation of real-time market dynamics, and makes us more confident that the onset of new competition will continue to eat away at 


Penumbra sales.

Importantly, note that Medtronic’s React 71 – its newest and, per doctors with whom we’ve spoken, most popular neurovascular aspiration 
catheter – is not yet captured in the IQVIA data. Therefore, the above data represents Medtronic’s minimum relative incremental market share vs. 


Penumbra. From our conversation with doctors, we are confident that the recent decline in React 68 sales reflects cannibalization by the React 71.


IQVIA has informed us that sales data for the React 71 will be available as of mid-August, in just several weeks. We anticipate that the data could 
show sales of over 1,600 React 71 catheters since Sep 2018, which would put Medtronic’s cumulative relative incremental share at 15%, where 


management claimed it to be.

In the course of our research, we spoke with numerous neurosurgeons at institutions of a wide range of sizes, including practices which conduct 
anywhere from 60 to 200 mechanical thrombectomies per year. The trend among them was almost universal: whereas most used Penumbra 


almost exclusively until only recently, they now purchase only 0-30% of their neurovascular aspiration catheters from Penumbra. This shift among 
neurosurgeons from ~100% to 0-30% reliance on Penumbra has occurred over the course of just six to nine months.


Tracking Data Corroborated By Doctors


“I am 70% Sofia [Terumo], probably 15% Medtronic React 71, and 15% 
Penumbra. It used to be that we were 100% Penumbra when they were the 
only thing out there. In 2017, I got a partner who had in his training, had used 
Sofia for this purpose even though it did not have an indication for 
thrombectomy… And then Medtronic came out, and then Vecta [Stryker] came 
out. Sofia was way better than Penumbra's and so we pretty much switched.
It took me a month or two to agree to that, but we switched… Their Jet7 catheter 
sucks and they know it.”

“Penumbra used to always beat itself. Once something new came out, Penumbra 
would come out with something better. But now Medtronic has the React 71, 
and that is kicking ass. In our shop, we have shifted 40-50% of our business 
from the Penumbra Jet to Medtronic – and now it is backordered. Medtronic 
never expected it to be this successful. And Cerenovus [Johnson & Johnson] 
is coming out with some interesting stuff too in the next six months. I think 
they are going to be even bigger than the React 71.”
- Neurosurgeon


Between the transaction data and our conversations with doctors and other industry experts, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that 
Penumbra is losing tremendous market share at an extremely rapid pace.

We estimate that, even if it were to give its stent retrievers away for free as part of its mechanical thrombectomy bundles, Medtronic would be able 
to grow its mechanical thrombectomy profit dollars through 2019, even when assuming no stent retriever share gains.

With the market-leading stent 
retriever and well-received 


aspiration catheters, Medtronic 
could likely take aspiration share 
extremely rapidly (as it has been) 


by temporarily giving away its 
aspiration catheters for free, or 
selling it at a steep discount. It 
would not sacrifice near-term 


gross profit growth by doing so, 
and could position itself for 


longer-term segment growth by 
establishing itself as the dominant 


player in neurovascular 
mechanical thrombectomy.


With limited ability to bundle on its 
own, Penumbra could face 


significant price compression in 
its core aspiration vertical without 
an opportunity to compensate by 


growing share in its relatively 
underpenetrated stent retriever 


vertical.

VTE PAD Vascular Access


Diverting Attention Away From Bad News? 
Management Promoting A New Growth Engine 
Just As The Old One Is Set To Peter Out


Management has recently begun to promote its peripheral thrombectomy business, which sells catheters and accessories for use in treating clots 
outside of the brain and heart. We find it interesting that management has chosen to promote this business just as we observe the Company 


experience serious competitive pressure in its core neurovascular business. We also believe that sell-side growth expectations are excessive for 
this segment: many analysts include “vascular access” patients as part of Penumbra’s vascular TAM, but doctors have told us that the TAM for 
Penumbra’s vascular Indigo System is likely restricted to peripheral artery disease (PTE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients, among 


whom there were ~110K thrombectomies in 2018. A fraction of these patients are also on Medicare and not candidates for a more expensive 
thrombectomy procedure. Spruce Point estimates that, in FY18, Penumbra achieved ~25% penetration among this universe of thrombectomy 


patients. While procedures are expected to continue to grow at a high single-digit rate, we do not expect Penumbra to be able to take significantly 
more share than it already has in what is a highly competitive market – already more competitive than the neuro vertical.

we believe that the TAM for Penumbra’s peripheral thrombectomy 


business is 33% lower than the Street believes


As of FYE 2018, we believe that Penumbra is 10% more penetrated 
than the sell side believes


With Penumbra more penetrated than the sell side believes in the peripheral thrombectomy market – a market which is already more crowded 
and competitive than the neuro market – we believe the Company’s runway for growth is far more limited than is generally perceived.

Summarizing The Sales Decline:
Sales Growth Set To Be Cut Almost In Half


Spruce Point believes that, with Penumbra U.S. Stroke revenue growth set to slow in the face of heavy competition, and with consensus 
peripheral thrombectomy sales expectations far too aggressive, company-wide sales growth is set to be cut almost in half from Street estimates, 


from FY19 through FY21.

Medtech companies which produce devices cleared under PMAs (as opposed to the 510(k) pathway) are generally deemed to be protected from 
competition by stronger barriers to entry and, naturally, tend to trade at relatively higher multiples. So why does Penumbra trade in line with 


producers of devices cleared under the PMA pathway?

Background On Thrombosis


Penumbra develops and produces devices designed to treat thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot obstructing blood flow through the 
circulatory system. Thrombosis includes both ischemic strokes and various types “peripheral” or “vascular” clots. Ischemic strokes occur when 


a clot blocks blood flow through a vein or artery in the brain. Peripheral or vascular clots, meanwhile, occur elsewhere throughout the body.


Acute Ischemic Stroke Peripheral Vascular Thrombosis
17


Mechanical Thrombectomy: A Novel Treatment 
For Blood Clots


Until recently, acute ischemic strokes (AISs) were most commonly treated with the intravenous (IV) application of tissue plasminogen activator 
(tPA) (or “alteplase”), a blood-thinning agent. This treatment, however, has a number of major shortcomings. tPA must be administered within 3 
to 4.5 hours of the stroke to be effective, yet many patients fail to make it to the hospital within this timeframe, whether due to a failure to detect 
stroke symptoms (in the case of a mild stroke) or other logistical constraints. Further, tPA interferes with the natural formation of clots, which 
can cause intracranial hemorrhage or secondary bleeding, or otherwise inhibit blood flow restoration. Since the late 2000s, this treatment has 


increasingly been replaced by endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, a set of minimally-invasive procedures using tools designed to remove 
clots. One such tool is the stent retriever (“SR”), which traps the clot within a small wire device and removes it into a microcatheter at the base of 
the wire. Aspiration catheters (“ACs“), meanwhile, remove the clot using suction, “vacuuming” the clot into a “reperfusion catheter.” Penumbra 
was the commercial pioneer behind the neurovascular AC and was the first to launch an AC cleared by the FDA for ischemic stroke treatment.

Early Clinical Support For Mechanical 
Thrombectomy Favors Stent Retrievers


While both the stent retriever and aspiration catheter won support from – and adoption by – physicians through the 2010s, the stent retriever saw 
stronger support from early clinical trials. The first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to show superior outcomes among stroke patients treated 


with mechanical thrombectomy versus the established standard of care was the landmark MR CLEAN study, published Jan 2015.1 While formally 
providing support for mechanical thrombectomy in general (when used in conjunction with tPA), the study itself focused primarily on stent 


retrievers, which were used on 190 of the 195 subjects treated with mechanical thrombectomy.1 Just one was treated with thromboaspiration 
alone.2 With early trials focused on the stent retriever method, this treatment gained traction among neurosurgeons more quickly than did 


thromboaspiration, leading medical device companies in the space to concentrate their R&D and marketing efforts on stent retrievers.

While helping to establish mechanical thrombectomy as the new standard of care for acute ischemic stroke, the MR CLEAN study did much more 
to justify the use of stent retrievers than it did any other method of intraarterial acute ischemic stroke treatment.

Clinical Studies Encourage Adoption Of Stent 
Retrievers By Neurosurgeons


Including the MR CLEAN study, a total of five major trials studying the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of acute 
ischemic stroke were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. Each of them focused either primarily or exclusively on stent 


retrievers over thromboaspiration.


ESCAPE Study (Mar 2015)


EXTEND-IA Study (Mar 2015)


SWIFT PRIME Study (Jun 2015)


REVASCAT Study (Jun 2015)


Initial clinical trials were overwhelmingly centered on stent retrievers over aspiration catheters for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, driving 
faster adoption of the stent retrievers among neurosurgeons.

Aspiration Thrombectomy Studies Produce 
Fewer Resounding Successes


While numerous studies provided evidence that the stent retriever method was safe, effective, and superior to the prevailing standard of care, 
concurrent studies which focused on aspiration thrombectomy were less successful. Concurrent with the MR CLEAN study, another group of 
researchers conducted the THERAPY study, an RCT designed to examine the safety and efficacy of aspiration thrombectomy. On a truncated 
sample,1 the THERAPY study found that treating acute ischemic stroke with aspiration thrombectomy plus tPA was neither more effective nor 


safer than tPA alone. A year later, the ASTER study – another RCT – failed to show that aspiration thrombectomy was more effective in inducing 
revascularization than the stent retriever method. Not until the COMPASS trial, the results of which were first presented in 2018, was there RCT-


supported evidence for the “non-inferiority” of aspiration thrombectomy to the stent retriever method.


1. The THERAPY study was cut short after the MR CLEAN study concluded that treating acute ischemic stroke with tPA alone – the control treatment in both studies – was inferior to tPA plus mechanical thrombectomy 
and, therefore, unethical.

Aspiration Thrombectomy Studies Produce 
Fewer Resounding Successes


Thromboaspiration as a treatment option for acute ischemic stroke has gained increasing interest with more recent clinical successes. 
Importantly, the aspiration method costs approximately 30-50% less per procedure than the stent retriever method. Further, “solumbra” – a 


treatment method which combines stent retrievers with aspiration – is already estimated to be the most popular first-line approach to 
neurovascular mechanical thrombectomy, and continues to be the fastest-growing. Thromboaspiration may also be employed in the case that a 
first-pass stent retriever attempt fails (just as a stent retriever may be employed if a first-pass thromboaspiration attempt – or “ADAPT” – fails).

Solumbra has been the fastest-growing category of first-pass mechanical thrombectomy techniques, and it is currently the largest. Accordingly, 
most neurovascular thrombectomies which include aspiration also include stent retrievers, meaning that doctors and purchasing officers may 


prefer to source from vendors which can supply both high-quality aspiration catheters AND high-quality stent-retrievers.

Major Medical Device Players Finally Enter The 
Aspiration Catheter Market


With aspiration thrombectomy now gaining traction as a clinically-proven approach to acute ischemic stroke treatment – and one which is 
cheaper than the stent retriever method – major medical device players outside of Penumbra have finally entered the space with their own 


aspiration catheters FDA-approved for acute ischemic stroke treatment.1 While Penumbra was the only player with an FDA-approved aspiration 
catheter through much of the 2010s, others have rapidly entered the space through the past twelve months, and the Company now competes with 


large-scale medical device companies in a space which it had to itself for almost ten years. Analysts and investors are both well-aware of the 
recent influx of competition and generally remain bullish nonetheless. However, we believe – and will demonstrate – that the Street is severely 


underestimating the pace with which competitors are taking share from Penumbra.

1. As discussed later in this report, while only Penumbra offered catheters approved by the FDA for use in aspiration thrombectomy until recently, many neurosurgeons frequently used other companies’ guide catheters 
“off label” as aspiration catheters. This perhaps contributed to competitors’ delayed entry into the “FDA-approved” aspiration catheter space.

Consensus Estimates Imply Sustained Market 
Share Dominance By Penumbra


As the first player to come to market with an FDA-approved aspiration catheter for the treatment of acute ischemic strokes, Penumbra has 
maintained commanding market share through its brief history as a public company. Spruce Point observes that, while the sell side does appear 
to assume some level of market share attrition with increasing competition, some analysts appear to believe that the Company can continue to 
dominate the neurovascular aspiration catheter space across each of its geographic markets for years to come. Is this assumption realistic?

Market Share Estimates Out Of Thin Air


Spruce Point believes that analysts have taken a relatively unsophisticated and naïve approach to estimating Penumbra’s neurovascular 
aspiration catheter sales in future years: they appear simply to project 2-3% market share loss per year in each of its major markets due to rising 
competition, and derive annual aspiration catheter sales from the resulting output, assuming ~3% growth in acute ischemic strokes per year and 
an ongoing shift away from legacy treatments in favor of mechanical thrombectomy. While the latter two market sizing assumptions are perhaps 
not unreasonable, we find neither an analytical nor historical basis for the 2-3% annual share loss assumption: it is simply introduced as a simple 


way to project future sales while acknowledging increasing competition, and is probably built around Company guidance.


Spruce Point believes that consensus estimates for future aspiration catheter revenues are not analytically robust. Yet, as with most companies, 
the market interprets these estimates as a good indicator of future sales, and as perhaps the most educated, rigorous, and analytically complete 


assessment of future performance. Accordingly, we believe that Penumbra shares are currently valued according to estimates which likely 
feature a high degree of error.

Street Market Share Estimates Conflict With 
Competitor Statements


Market analysts believe that, as of fiscal year end 2018, Penumbra held 89% share of the U.S. aspiration catheter market. Yet, on its May 23 
earnings call, Medtronic claimed to have 15% of this market already, ahead of schedule. Management expects to achieve 25% share by the end of 


its fiscal year and “eventually” 50%. With just one of Penumbra’s four major competitors claiming 15% share, how could Penumbra’s current 
share possibly be 89%? Medtronic’s projection also flies in the face of analyst forecasts, which put Penumbra’s U.S. aspiration share at 88% by 


the end of FY19, and which don’t see Penumbra’s share falling beneath 75% until after 2023.


“Yes, sure. So first of all, in neurovascular, we have -- at Medtronic, we've a broad portfolio playing in every segment, and 
that is our strategy. And we're on number one positions in both ischemic and overall hemorrhagic, and we've recently 
refreshed that entire portfolio. Nobody else can say this. So it's a very strong market. We're very well positioned across 
every segment.


Now, what's driving our growth in the near term is the -- first of all, entering the aspiration market, where we launched the 
068 and now the 071 Riptide systems or catheters, and we've got -- we’re getting really, really positive feedback on both. 
The 068 started out a little slow because we had to make some adjustments to it. We had a soft launch. Made some 
adjustments to the product, and now it's picking up. The 071 hit the ground running and we're getting great feedback. 
And we estimate that we're somewhere around 15% of this market already, well ahead of our plans in the aspiration 
segment, well ahead of our plans. We see ourselves getting to 25% by the end of the fiscal year and we think we'll 
eventually get to 50% of this aspiration market. And on top of that, we just launched our next-gen stent retriever to 
maintain and extend our lead in that segment. So those are some of the things that are driving it. And I'd say the other big 
driver is just the global nature. We are just growing very fast in China. And so the fact that we're global is also helping, 
especially in China. So it's a global and broad and refreshed product portfolio.”


- Geoffrey Martha – Executive Vice President and President of Restorative Therapies Group, Medtronic


“And then just wanted to ask one question on neuro. So, the neurovascular growth is very 
strong, could you talk about some of the components of that and whether you're seeing a 
stronger market there, are there any product launches that help you this quarter?”

Medtronic Q4 FY19 Conference Call (05/23/19)


If Medtronic’s claims regarding its current share and share trajectory are at all credible – and we have no reason to believe that they are not –
then sell-side market share estimates for Penumbra, and sales growth estimates by extension, are off by a tremendous margin.

Street Market Share Estimates Conflict With 
Competitor Statements


If we assume that all neurovascular aspiration catheter players outside of Penumbra and Medtronic collectively control 10% of the market –
generally in-line with market estimates and our own diligence – and conservatively assume that this share remains constant into the future, 


Medtronic’s market share projections would imply that Penumbra currently controls just 75% share, falling to 65% by Medtronic’s fiscal year end 
and to 40% into the future. Blended sell-side estimates, meanwhile, would imply that Medtronic currently has less than 1% share, growing to only 


2% by its fiscal year end. This conflicts significantly with our own diligence and, we believe, is likely incorrect.


While these inconsistencies suggest that there may be discrepancies in the sell side’s view of the base of the market, we are intrigued most by 
the fact that, regardless of how analysts identify and measure the market, they appear to significantly underestimate the pace of competitive 


market share gains: again, the sell side appears to assume that Penumbra will lose 2-3% market share per year, while Medtronic claims to have 
gained 15% in under a year and to be on pace to capture another 10% this year.

IQVIA: Evaluating Shifting Market Share With 
Hospital Transaction Data


In order to evaluate conflicting claims about aspiration catheter market share, Spruce Point obtained recent hospital transaction data from IQVIA. 
IQVIA – formerly IMS Health and Quintiles – is a publicly-traded healthcare data analytics and technology services company which serves the life 
sciences sector. It collects and analyzes data on pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electronic medical records, and a wide range of other life 
sciences topics to provide medical professionals, researchers, salespeople, executives, and others with relevant insights on healthcare-related 


topics. Using IQVIA’s Medical Device and Supply Audit (MDSA), we were able to evaluate sales trends for all neurovascular mechanical 
thrombectomy devices through May 2019. The MDSA records 100% of medical device purchases by 650 non-federal, short-term acute care 


hospitals in the U.S. and, from this, projects nation-wide sales (in both units and dollars) on a SKU-level basis for nearly 3,000 medical product 
manufacturers. This allowed us to study shifts in aspiration catheter market share on just a two-month lag.


It is important to note that, to our knowledge, this data is known to very few market participants: it is designed for and provided primarily to the 
health care industry. Our understanding is that it is known to few, if any, sell-side brokerage firms. It is also priced to a corporate end market and, 
as such, is likely too expensive for all but the largest of buy-side firms. We believe that the market is generally blind to this data, and that prices 


of Penumbra shares must adjust to reflect this powerful, credible, and compelling information.

Market Data Corroborates Penumbra’s 
Dramatic Market Share Loss


Spruce Point’s analysis of recent market data confirms that Penumbra is, in fact, rapidly losing share in real time. IQVIA MDSA data show that, as 
of May – the last month for which data is currently available – monthly sales of Penumbra’s neurovascular aspiration catheters have declined 


year-over-year for five of the last six months. Penumbra’s growth trajectory appears to be losing steam so rapidly that its rate of growth has not 
only slowed, but has turned negative in a neurovascular mechanical thrombectomy market which is itself growing at 20-40% per year.

While prior declines indicated by IQVIA did not translate into negative sales growth, it does appear to reflect recent sales growth decelerations 
directionally, and could provide context for the recent pickup in DSOs. Do stretched receivables suggest that the indicated decline in AC 


transactions could translate to observable trends in Penumbra’s financial statements on a lag? Did international sales cover up U.S. declines?
30


Apparent Sales Decline Coincides With Wave Of 
Competitive Entry


We note that the sales decline indicated by the transaction data coincides with the H2 2018 FDA approval of multiple neurovascular aspiration 
catheters by competitors. Importantly, the accompanying onset of new competition is also visible in the transaction data. IQVIA began to capture 
sales of Medtronic’s React 68 neurovascular aspiration catheter in Sep 2018, the first quarter during which Penumbra sales began to show hints 


of slowing down in the data set. This strengthens our belief that the observed slowdown in Penumbra sales in the transaction data is in fact a 
realistic representation of real-time market dynamics, and makes us more confident that the onset of new competition will continue to eat away at 


Penumbra sales.

Importantly, note that Medtronic’s React 71 – its newest and, per doctors with whom we’ve spoken, most popular neurovascular aspiration 
catheter – is not yet captured in the IQVIA data. Therefore, the above data represents Medtronic’s minimum relative incremental market share vs. 


Penumbra. From our conversation with doctors, we are confident that the recent decline in React 68 sales reflects cannibalization by the React 71.


IQVIA has informed us that sales data for the React 71 will be available as of mid-August, in just several weeks. We anticipate that the data could 
show sales of over 1,600 React 71 catheters since Sep 2018, which would put Medtronic’s cumulative relative incremental share at 15%, where 


management claimed it to be.

IQVIA Data Appears Increasingly Credible,
Both Directionally And In Absolute Terms


Our analysis of IQVIA’s sales data suggests that it is becoming an increasingly accurate and reliable indicator of Penumbra revenue. While 
Penumbra’s reported U.S. sales differed from U.S. sales of Penumbra SKUs captured by IQVIA by 33% in 2014 – perhaps because Penumbra’s 


narrower customer base introduced bias into the data – IQVIA’s Penumbra sales data came within 2% of Penumbra’s reported U.S. sales in 2018. 
IQVIA has also successfully captured inflections in Penumbra’s U.S. sales trajectory through the past two years, reflecting both the step-down in 


growth in 2017 and the slight increase in growth in 2018.

In the course of our research, we spoke with numerous neurosurgeons at institutions of a wide range of sizes, including practices which conduct 
anywhere from 60 to 200 mechanical thrombectomies per year. The trend among them was almost universal: whereas most used Penumbra 


almost exclusively until only recently, they now purchase only 0-30% of their neurovascular aspiration catheters from Penumbra. This shift among 
neurosurgeons from ~100% to 0-30% reliance on Penumbra has occurred over the course of just six to nine months.


Tracking Data Corroborated By Doctors


“I am 70% Sofia [Terumo], probably 15% Medtronic React 71, and 15% 
Penumbra. It used to be that we were 100% Penumbra when they were the 
only thing out there. In 2017, I got a partner who had in his training, had used 
Sofia for this purpose even though it did not have an indication for 
thrombectomy… And then Medtronic came out, and then Vecta [Stryker] came 
out. Sofia was way better than Penumbra's and so we pretty much switched.
It took me a month or two to agree to that, but we switched… Their Jet7 catheter 
sucks and they know it.”

“Penumbra used to always beat itself. Once something new came out, Penumbra 
would come out with something better. But now Medtronic has the React 71, 
and that is kicking ass. In our shop, we have shifted 40-50% of our business 
from the Penumbra Jet to Medtronic – and now it is backordered. Medtronic 
never expected it to be this successful. And Cerenovus [Johnson & Johnson] 
is coming out with some interesting stuff too in the next six months. I think 
they are going to be even bigger than the React 71.”
- Neurosurgeon


Between the transaction data and our conversations with doctors and other industry experts, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that 
Penumbra is losing tremendous market share at an extremely rapid pace.
33


As one would expect, management has historically been most likely to raise revenue guidance when achieving relatively larger quarterly revenue 
beats. While Penumbra has beaten analyst estimates every quarter since Q3 FY15, its last two beats were relatively slim – and, in Q1, management 


declined to raise full-year revenue guidance for the first time in almost two years. We are concerned by the fact that Penumbra is achieving 
slimmer revenue beats and declining to raise guidance just as IQVIA data indicates that its neurovascular aspiration catheter sales are slowing in 


the U.S. Could management be preparing the market for a near-term revenue miss?


Management Gearing Up For A Miss?


Slimmest quarterly revenue beat 
since Q1 FY17


No full-year revenue guidance raise


First failure to raise guidance since Q2 FY17


With Penumbra now facing significant on-label competition from large medical device manufacturers for the first time in its history, the 
competitive environment in which Penumbra has historically produced constant beats has radically changed through the last ~6 months. 


Investors and analysts may be expecting more of the same while transaction data reveals – in real time – that the world in which Penumbra could 
consistently grow neurovascular sales at double-digit rates simply no longer exists.

While Penumbra was until recently the only company to offer an aspiration catheter approved by the FDA for thrombus aspiration in cases of 
acute ischemic stroke, doctors report that many of their peers use guide catheters “off-label” for the same purpose. Guide catheters are 


accessories used during mechanical thrombectomies “as a conduit for retrievers.” Though they are not cleared by the FDA for neurovascular 
aspiration thrombectomy, they are physically capable of serving the same purpose when paired with an aspiration catheter vacuum pump. For 
reasons such as cost or product preference, doctors may choose to use a guide catheter “off-label” rather than an FDA-approved aspiration 
catheter when performing aspiration thrombectomies to treat ischemic stroke. This practice was so widespread that, in March 2017, the FDA 


issued a letter warning against this practice after receiving complaints – reportedly from Penumbra itself, per industry experts.


Don’t Let The “Med Tech” Label Fool You:
Aspiration Catheters Are Disposable 
Commodities


If the aspiration catheter is so low-tech that its role can be satisfied by cheaper existing products, why should Penumbra expect to maintain a 
premium price as neurovascular aspiration thrombectomies become more commonplace?


Why should Penumbra expect to maintain its historical market dominance as established med tech companies rapidly enter the “on-label” space 
without having to develop any new technology?


Why would you invest in a (nearly) one-product company whose “regulated” headline product is exists in a vertical which the FDA has failed to 
effectively police – and which has now seen a flood of FDA-approved competitors in any case?

Some Penumbra bulls see the “off-label” phenomenon as a positive for the stock: whereas the Company’s “headline” market share of the 
neurovascular aspiration catheter space is thought to be ~90%, its “effective” market share could really be ~70% due to the use of off-label 


catheters not captured in market data, thus inflating the apparent downside to existing share levels. Spruce Point, however, believes that rampant 
“off-label” catheter use is clear evidence that Penumbra’s neurovascular aspiration catheter is a commodity product at high risk to substitutes 


and competitive threats: these devices are so basic that catheters designed for other purposes could be used in their place, and we have evidence 
of doctors preferring even these non-dedicated catheters over Penumbra’s aspiration thrombectomy-specific catheters.


Off-Label Catheter Usage Suggests Doctor 
Readiness To Adopt Competitors


If Penumbra’s market share has until now been protected by only the FDA’s relatively weak 510(k) approval process, which can be satisfied in just 
30-90 days, investors should not be confident that it can maintain its share or price levels now that competitors have finally entered the market 


“on-label.”


If some doctors have such a strong preference for non-Penumbra catheters – whether due to price or product quality – that they were willing to 
skirt FDA regulations to use non-approved catheters in neurovascular aspiration thrombectomy, we would expect the recent FDA approvals of a 
swath of competitors to serve as a catalyst for significant migration among doctors who might have wanted to switch, but who felt pressured to 


adhere to FDA regulations.

“I am a 70% Sofia, probably 15% Medtronic React 71 and 15% Penumbra. It used to be that we 
were 100% Penumbra when they were the only thing out there. In 2017, I got a partner who 
had, in his training, used Sofia for this purpose even though it did not have an indication 
for thrombectomy. [Sofia's] original indication was as a distal access catheter which means that 
there is something in the head [of the catheter] that allows you to deliver something else into the 
head…. If you don't have an indication, you can't send your salesforce out to sell the Sofia as an 
aspiration catheter for mechanical thrombectomy. We switched to Sofia before there was an 
indication for mechanical thrombectomy. You can use anything off label, but the 
salesperson can't sell an off-label indication – that is against FDA regulation. If you ask 
them about an off-label use, they can say, ‘That is off label and I can't speak to that, but I 
have had some clients who use it off label and I can get them in touch with you.'”

“Penumbra went around to and made a very big deal about 
physicians using Medtronic, Terumo and Stryker aspiration 
catheters that previously did not have the stroke label 
indication. They freaked out a lot of doctors. This annoyed the 
doctors a lot because [the Penumbra salesman] should not be 
telling the doctors how they should be treating their patients. This 
also swayed some doctors to use Penumbra.”

Aspiration catheters designed for acute ischemic stroke treatment are cleared for clinical use by the FDA under the “510(k) pathway.” All medical 
devices must be cleared by the FDA through either a Premarket Approval (PMA) or Premarket Notification (PMN) before they can be used in the 
U.S. Class III devices – those which sustain life or are otherwise deemed high-risk – must be cleared through the more demanding PMA route, 


which requires that the device’s safety and efficacy be demonstrated through clinical trials. Class I and II devices – which present “low to 
moderate risk” or “moderate to high risk,” respectively – need only be cleared through a PMN under section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, 


and Cosmetic Act, which requires only evidence of “substantial equivalency” with existing devices and can be processed in just 30-90 days. As 
competitors already appear to have had all the necessary technology in their intermediate catheters to go to market with aspiration catheters of 
their own, it is no surprise that they were able to enter the space so quickly, highlighting the low barriers to entry in this vertical going forward.


510(k) Pathway Reduces Barriers To Entry


Medtronic React 68 FDA Approval


FDA clearance through the 510(k) pathway requires only evidence of “substantial equivalency” with a “predicate device” already on the market. 
That these aspiration catheters were cleared through direct comparison with Penumbra reinforces the commoditization of the industry and the 


ease with which competitors can enter the neurovascular aspiration catheter market.

According to doctors with whom we spoke throughout our diligence, product bundling has grown increasingly common in the mechanical 
thrombectomy space as large medical device companies continue to cross over into the aspiration catheter market from the stent retriever 


vertical. On top of whatever discounts they offer vs. Penumbra on a per product basis at face value, large medical device companies are beginning 
to offer discounted mechanical thrombectomy packages which include a broad set of relevant tools, including both stent retrievers and aspiration 
catheters. Doctors with whom we spoke reported discounts on bundled items of between 10-20%. Discounted bundling by deep-pocketed medical 


device companies poses a powerful risk to industry pricing: assuming that its near-term stent retriever market share projections are correct, 
Medtronic, whose stent retriever has dominant share, and which is widely regarded as the industry’s gold standard, can effectively give away its 


aspiration catheters for free and still grow profit dollars into FY19, without even assuming any market share gains in the stent retriever space.


Discounted Bundling By Deep-Pocketed Mega-
Cap Competitors Threatens Industry Pricing


“[Medtronic] is saying – the intermediate aspiration catheter, the React – the 
microcatheter, the Phenom 27 – and then the stent retriever, and the wire, the 
Asahi wire…let’s bundle all of this. The list price of all of this when you put it 
all together is $14,000 or $15,000. ‘So we’re going to give you a bundling 
discount, and let’s now bring it down to $12,000. So if you use all of this 
together, and we’re going to give you a discount to $12,000.’ Well, if the doctors 
are using it already and like their products, then that’s attractive to the hospital –
it becomes very palatable to use this combination of bundling and so forth. So I 
think that it’s a sales tactic – it’s a tactic of ‘you win, we win.’”


- Neurosurgeon
75 mechanical thrombectomies per year


“The primary competitive advantage that Medtronic has over Penumbra is 
its company size and its ability to bundle its products across service lines 
and offer volume discounts to hospitals. From a pricing standpoint, 
Medtronic can be more aggressive than Penumbra or Terumo. Penumbra 
shouldn't rest on its laurels. It should make them nervous if Medtronic has 
painted a bulls-eye on them. Medtronic is a behemoth of a company that can 
flex its economic muscles -- it can bundle product and give rebates. Medtronic 
has great ways to encourage hospitals to use their products. Our hospital has a 
contract with Medtronic. [Us doctors] are always being pushed by hospital 
administration to use more Medtronic because of the greater rebates being 
offered. As more companies develop aspiration technology there will be 
more price competition.”
- Surgeon


“Penumbra’s stent retriever is definitely inferior. And its strategy of 
bundling a low-cost stent retriever with its aspiration catheters is not 
working. Others are already at price parity, so it doesn’t really matter anyways.”
- Neurosurgeon


Penumbra, meanwhile, would not be able to analogously take stent retriever share by lowering its stent retriever prices due to widespread disdain 
for its stent retrievers.


“From a cost perspective, it is cheaper for us to use Medtronic. To go back 
to Penumbra, I would have to see a significant improvement in 
performance. I really don't think the pump is the distinguishing feature. Each 
company will now give you their pump for free. A few years ago when there was 
no competition, you had to buy the pump from Penumbra.”

We estimate that, even if it were to give its stent retrievers away for free as part of its mechanical thrombectomy bundles, Medtronic would be able 
to grow its mechanical thrombectomy profit dollars through 2019, even when assuming no stent retriever share gains.


Discounted Bundling By Deep-Pocketed Mega-
Cap Competitors Threatens Industry Pricing


With the market-leading stent 
retriever and well-received 


aspiration catheters, Medtronic 
could likely take aspiration share 
extremely rapidly (as it has been) 


by temporarily giving away its 
aspiration catheters for free, or 
selling it at a steep discount. It 
would not sacrifice near-term 


gross profit growth by doing so, 
and could position itself for 


longer-term segment growth by 
establishing itself as the dominant 


player in neurovascular 
mechanical thrombectomy.


With limited ability to bundle on its 
own, Penumbra could face 


significant price compression in 
its core aspiration vertical without 
an opportunity to compensate by 


growing share in its relatively 
underpenetrated stent retriever 


vertical.

Even as aspiration catheters grow increasingly popular in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, industry trends continue to favor vendors which 
can provide high-quality stent retrievers. As stent retrievers are more R&D-intensive and not as commoditized as aspiration catheters, 


neurosurgeons will be more likely to source their bundles from experienced manufacturers of stent retrievers than from established aspiration 
catheter providers like Penumbra (all else equal). The growing popularity of the “solumbra” technique (combined thromboaspiration / stent 


retriever thrombectomy) will only reinforce this trend: even as thromboaspiration becomes more popular, its growth will not necessarily come at 
the expense of the use of stent retrievers, which, again, as the more IP-intensive device, will be more likely to drive the purchase decision. 
Penumbra does, in fact, offer a stent retriever, but the doctors with whom we spoke were unanimous in their disdain for it, and there is no 


evidence that the Company is capable of developing a stent retriever on par with those of deep-pocketed mega-cap medical device companies.


Low-Quality Stent Retriever Puts Penumbra At A 
Disadvantage Amidst Industry Trends


“Penumbra has offered a similar kind of [bundling] arrangement [as Medtronic], but I told 
them that I am not interested because I have used their stent retriever and I don't think it is 
as good as the Solitaire [Medtronic]. And the discount that they are going to offer –
truthfully, they could even offer it for me for free and this would not convince me to use it.
The arrangement with Penumbra that they were offering was that if they tried first with aspiration 
and its not successful, then if we use their stent retriever then we could use that for free as a bailout 
strategy. I don't want to use their stent retriever because it is just going to take me extra time and I 
won't get the vessel open and then I will have to switch to the Solitaire anyway. I am not interested 
in using Penumbra's stent retriever even if its severely discounted in price for me.”
- Neurosurgeon
Individually: 25-35 mechanical thrombectomies per year
Practice: ~120 mechanical thrombectomies per year


“Medtronic has the Solitaire – it’s a great stent retriever. And you compare that to the Penumbra stent retriever, which is this 3D separator – in my opinion, it wasn’t as 
good. They actually had a trial with the 3D separator and it didn’t perform too well. So what ended up happening at that point in time was that Penumbra said, ‘Ok, 
well, we need to come up with some other way of gaining the market. Let’s just tag on into this only aspiration thing – we have the great catheter, let’s just jump on 
that.’ But one thing with Penumbra is that they still need a better stent retriever than what they have…. I think the person who has the better stent retriever [will be the 
winner in solumbra]. The reason for that is because we need a stent retriever that decreases the amount of distal embolization.”
- Neurosurgeon
Individually: 75 mechanical thrombectomies per year
Practice: 75 mechanical thrombectomies per year


“It is widely recognized that doctors hate Penumbra's stent 
retriever…. Penumbra is trying to get into stent retrievers and has 
fallen flat on their face. Penumbra has not gotten any traction 
with their stent retriever. The development of a stent retriever 
is not easy at all. Medtronic and Stryker are on their 2nd or 3rd
generation of their stent retrievers and have really optimized the 
performance of their technology. Aspiration on the other hand is not 
rocket science. These are the same tubes that are used for other 
procedures in the brain. The regulatory process for aspiration 
catheters are all 510K which is simple and don't need clinical data. 
The stent retriever is a much more complex system.”
- Neurovascular Products Sales Director


If the trend towards bundling continues to dominate the space, and if bundle purchasing decisions are driven by a combination of price 
considerations and the quality of the stent retriever, we should expect 1) large medical device companies with significant scale for bundling and 


2) companies with the best stent retrievers to win out.


Penumbra is a laggard in BOTH 1) scale and 2) stent retriever quality. The simultaneous growth of bundling and the solumbra technique – even 
as solumbra expands the market for aspiration catheters – will put Penumbra at a significant competitive disadvantage to larger peers.

In failing to account for the changing dynamics within neurovascular thrombectomy, analysts once again overestimate Penumbra’s neurovascular 
sales due to oversimplification of the market. Analysts appear to calculate Penumbra’s U.S. neurovascular sales by projecting the total number of 


mechanical thrombectomies to be performed – through both stent retriever and aspiration – and applying a forecasted market share to each 
subsegment of the market. However, most industry experts agree that the combined “solumbra” method will account for a significant share of the 


growth of the neurovascular thrombectomy market. From our conversations with doctors, we expect Penumbra to lose share at a particularly 
rapid rate in this subsegment: bundling among larger competitors, along with the importance of the quality of the stent retriever, will encourage 


migration to Medtronic and other competitors. Due to the weakness of its stent retriever and its inability to bundle effectively, Penumbra is 
positioned to perform relatively weakly in the largest and historically fastest-growing segment of the neurovascular thrombectomy market.


Failure To Model Market More Granularly Leads 
To Misestimation


Not only are analysts overestimating Penumbra’s future blended market share across neurovascular aspiration thrombectomy types, but they are 
failing to account for the sub-segment dynamics within aspiration.


Spruce Point believes that Penumbra’s major point of weakness will be in the solumbra subsegment, in which bundles will become increasingly 
common, and in which the quality of the stent retriever is of utmost importance.

A Promotional Management Team With A 
History Of Empty Projections


Management has a history of promotional behavior, particularly in the face of past failures. Industry experts report, for example, that management 
promoted its neuro embolization business heavily in the mid-2010s following the launch of its smart coils. However, the smart coil has thus far 


been a disappointment, and the neuro embolization business has been largely flat through the past several years. Interestingly, management has 
also apparently been making visits to doctors to promote its new lines of catheters and USB-enabled pump (the purpose of which nobody can 


quite figure out).


“Their Jet7 catheter sucks and they know it… [Penumbra's] CEO was just 
on a goodwill tour trying to make sure -- his last words for us as we all shook 
hands goodbye was ‘Don't give up on us.’


They rolled out this new pump for everybody. We were told that it has higher 
aspiration force than the one they had before… They replaced the old one with 
the new one for free. This new pump has a USB port on the back of it. And 
Adam's words were 'I think you know me well enough that I didn't design this 
pump with a USB port to charge your phone.‘ So there is something to new 
technology that will be related to power that [Adam] thinks is going to 
revolutionize aspiration. And I don't know what that is that they are trying 
to.”

“[Penumbra] launched their smart coils with a lot of fanfare, but it has not 
come through in the way they said it would. It did not surpass the 
technology of Target, Stryker's Coil, which is #1 in the in the US and World 
Market.”

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act of 2010) requires medical product manufacturers to disclose to 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) any payments or other transfers of value made to physicians or teaching hospitals. Spruce 


Point analyzed over 28,000 transactions made by Penumbra to doctors from 2013-18. We found that Penumbra paid seven doctors $2.9M of 
consulting fees in the form of stock between Feb 9, 2016 and Dec 31, 2018, none of which has been disclosed in public filings. Stock payments to 


non-director and non-employee doctors of this magnitude are very rare in the CMS Open Payments Database. We also found that $4.4M of 
Penumbra stock was repurchased from 11 doctors in the year preceding the Company’s IPO. We find this concerning for a relatively young 


medical device company which has been funding studies for years in an attempt to gain clinical support for its core products.

The Open Payments database also reveals that Penumbra has issued an unusually large quantity of travel and lodging reimbursements to 
doctors, with the most popular destination being Las Vegas (just ahead of Penumbra’s own headquarters in Alameda). After cross-checking the 
dates and locations of these reimbursements with the dates and locations of relevant medical conferences and industry conferences, it appears 


that most of these trips were not related to conferences. Our conversations with industry participants confirm that Penumbra has a reputation for

Just as rising competition has put pressure on Penumbra sales, management appears to be acting aggressively to maintain growth. In particular, 
DSOs have grown steadily and consistently since Penumbra first went public, and are now at an all-time high by a wide margin. This growth has 


accelerated through the last two quarters, during which time, we believe, competition became even fiercer with the release of new aspiration 
catheters from Medtronic and Stryker. These trends suggest that Penumbra sales and earnings may be artificially inflated by aggressive 


accounting or business practices.

Non-Core M&A Unrelated To Company

In Jan 2018, Penumbra announced the launch of MVI Health, a 50/50 joint venture formed with virtual reality technology developer Sixense 
Enterprises. Management later acquired another 40% of MVI from Sixense for $20M on Aug 31, giving it a 90% controlling interest in the entity. 
Though management is vague regarding its plans for this business, industry experts believe that Penumbra intends to develop virtual reality 


technology designed to assist stroke patients in the recovery process. Why should Penumbra – a young medical device company with effectively 
one vertical – commit resources to the development of highly-speculative virtual reality technology when it has no experience developing 
software or products outside of its thrombectomy tools? We fear that management is simply looking to move into a sexy and easily-hyped 


business line to continue to promote the Company, and we have little confidence that MVI will amount to anything but a waste of cash.

Other International Revenue - Quarter-over-Quarter Change


Acquisition Of Distributor Coincides With 
Concerning Financial Patterns


In Q3 FY17, Penumbra acquired Crossmed S.p.A., its Italian distributor, for a total purchase price of $18.7M (3.0x FY17 sales of $6.2M). In Spruce 
Point’s experience, distributor acquisitions are a common tactic used by companies looking for a quick sales boost. Might Penumbra have 


acquired its Italian distributor to aggressively move Penumbra product? Interestingly, we note that, after Penumbra DSI spiked in Q3 FY17 – as we 
would expect – this metric immediately corrected to historical levels in the subsequent two quarters. Meanwhile, Penumbra’s “Other International” 
sales (which include Europe) increased by an abnormal amount in the subsequent quarter. Could the effects of the acquisition have papered over 


slower or negative QoQ rest-of-world growth? Might future acquisitions of foreign distributors have the same effect?


DSIs peak in Q3 FY17, the quarter during which Penumbra 
acquired Crossmed, before rapidly correcting through 


subsequent quarters


Other International revenue rises by ~5x the average quarter-over-
quarter increase in the quarter following the Crossmed 


acquisition

Distributor Acquisitions Are Hallmark Warning 
Signs Of Financial Trouble


We note that distributor acquisitions are a common signal of managerial aggressiveness in the face of financial strain, and a sign that 
management may be looking to paper over underlying weaknesses. Spruce Point has a highly successful track record of identifying struggling 


companies by monitoring notable distributor acquisitions and unearthing broader fundamental weaknesses at the acquiring business.

Management Resorting To Bully Tactics To 
Protect Market Share?


In 2017, as the practice of using intermediate catheters for aspiration thrombectomy was becoming increasingly widespread, the FDA received a 
complaint about, and subsequently issued a warning against, the use of off-label catheters as aspirators in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. 


Several doctors and industry experts with whom we spoke saw this as an aggressive attempt by Penumbra to preserve market share. They 
acknowledge that, for the time being, it likely succeeded in scaring many purchase officers into buying only on-label aspiration catheters for 
neurovascular thrombus removal. However, they also note that most doctors saw through this tactic, and that it rubbed many the wrong way: 
neurologists apparently do not like being told how to treat their patients. Penumbra has since communicated warnings to doctors that their 


aspiration catheters are cleared by the FDA for use only with Penumbra accessories and vacuum pumps, even though, according to doctors, 
these items are entirely interchangeable. Is management resorting to policing its doctors to protect its commodity products from competition?


“Part of the commodity here is that…it’s hard to have IP around a plastic tube. Especially if you 
argue that you can put any suction on it. Just to give you a bit of context, there have been some 
companies engaging in a somewhat nefarious game of trying to sell supply chain 
departments that their aspiration catheters can only be used with their aspiration pump or 
their aspiration tubing, because that’s the way that it is approved by the FDA. I mean – that’s 
great, right? But obviously that is also a very hollow argument because I could hook these things 
up to a wall suction and they would work just the same way. And everyone knows that. So, it 
is things like – some things they’ve been trying to do by essentially putting fear of human 
destruction into the hands of people who are not clinical, and they don’t know how to 
respond to that.”
- Neurosurgeon
Individually: 30 mechanical thrombectomies per year
Practice: ~150-180 mechanical thrombectomies per year


“Penumbra went around to, and made a very big deal about, 
physicians using Medtronic, Terumo and Stryker aspiration 
catheters that previously did not have the stroke label 
indication. They freaked out a lot of doctors. This annoyed the 
doctors a lot because [the Penumbra salesman] should not be 
telling the doctors how they should be treating their patients. This 
also swayed some doctors to use Penumbra.”
- Neurovascular Products Sales Director


“The FDA label matters more to less-sophisticated doctors, like 
radiologists. People like me do whatever I think is best.”

Diverting Attention Away From Bad News? 
Management Promoting A New Growth Engine 
Just As The Old One Is Set To Peter Out


Management has recently begun to promote its peripheral thrombectomy business, which sells catheters and accessories for use in treating clots 
outside of the brain and heart. We find it interesting that management has chosen to promote this business just as it begins to experience serious 
competitive pressure in its core neurovascular business. We also believe that sell-side growth expectations are excessive for this segment: many 
analysts include “vascular access” patients as part of Penumbra’s vascular TAM, but doctors have told us that the TAM for Penumbra’s vascular 
Indigo System is likely restricted to peripheral artery disease (PTE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients, among whom there were ~110K 


thrombectomies in 2018. A fraction of these patients are also on Medicare and not candidates for a more expensive thrombectomy procedure. 
Spruce Point estimates that, in FY18, Penumbra achieved ~25% penetration among this universe of thrombectomy patients. While procedures are 
expected to continue to grow at a high single-digit rate, we do not expect Penumbra to be able to take significantly more share than it already has 


in what is a highly competitive market – already more competitive than the neuro vertical.

With Penumbra more penetrated than the sell side believes in the peripheral thrombectomy market – a market which is already more crowded 
and competitive than the neuro market – we believe the Company’s runway for growth is far more limited than is generally perceived.


By ruling vascular access patients out of Penumbra’s target market, 
we believe that the U.S. TAM for Penumbra’s peripheral 


thrombectomy business is 33% lower than the Street believes

Valuation Exceeds Appropriate Peer Group


Medtech companies which produce devices cleared under PMAs (as opposed to the 510(k) pathway) are generally deemed to be protected from 
competition by stronger barriers to entry and, naturally, tend to trade at relatively higher multiples. So why does Penumbra trade in line with 


producers of devices cleared under the PMA pathway?

PEN Improperly Trading In Line With Higher-
Quality Peers


PEN trades in line with more advanced and R&D-intensive medical device companies despite its weak IP, relatively low gross margins (even by 
the standard of 510(k) companies) and increasingly competitive landscape. We believe that investors must reevaluate Penumbra’s current 


valuation in light of its growing fundamental headwinds and low business quality.

Insiders Selling Aggressively As The Stock Climbs


Insiders owned 24.8% of PEN shares prior to the Company’s IPO in Sep 2015. Today, just four years later, they own only 9.6% of shares. Insiders 
appear to sell at almost every significant uptick in PEN shares. We find this particularly concerning in light of new fundamental challenges to the 


business.

Widespread Bullishness Despite No Upside 
Represented By Sellside Price Targets


Despite almost unanimous bullishness among analysts, the average sell-side price target is currently 16% below current price levels. Penumbra 
shares currently trade above even the highest price target of $180. We note that Penumbra is a relatively small player in the medical device 
universe, and that most of the med-tech analysts responsible for covering the Company cover relatively large universes of stocks. It is not 


surprising to us that analyst recommendations appear out of sync with their price targets, nor that analysts appear to be missing the ongoing 
inflection in Penumbra’s market share. Regardless, we believe that market expectations must be updated for the competitive headwinds revealed 


in this report.

Spruce Point Sees 40-55% Downside ($85-$110)
In PEN Shares


Spruce Point believes that rising competition in Penumbra’s U.S. ischemic stroke business is driving pricing pressure and market share losses 
which will soon translate into significantly reduced segment sales growth. We also believe that forecasted growth rates in its U.S. peripheral 
thrombectomy business are not sustainable given a more realistic view of market penetration. As company-wide sales growth falls by nearly 
half, we expect that PEN’s revenue multiple will adjust downwards as investors adjust their growth expectations to be more in line with our 


own, more realistic estimates. Spruce Point sees 40-55% downside in PEN shares as sales growth adjusts downwards and investors adjust their 
own projections.
