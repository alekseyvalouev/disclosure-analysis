Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA, OTC: BVNRY) is a $1.3B Danish vaccine-maker whose 


stock price has recently surged (up 63% YTD) thanks to excitement over its putative prostate- 


cancer treatment, Prostvac-VF, a therapeutic vaccine currently undergoing a Phase III clinical 


trial. Bavarian Nordic touts its earlier Phase II study of Prostvac as showing the “most 


pronounced survival to date in prostate cancer,” with an 8.5-month improvement in median 


overall survival, handily outperforming blockbuster drugs like Zytiga and Xtandi. The 


announcement in March that Bristol-Myers Squibb was paying $60mm upfront for an exclusive 


option to license and commercialize the vaccine gave investors great confidence that, despite 


the uncertainty surrounding any clinical trial, Prostvac is likely to succeed. 





This confidence is misplaced. The often cited 8.5-month improvement is an illusion: treatment- 


arm survival was unexceptional relative to the results of other trials in similar patient 


populations, while placebo-arm survival was anomalously poor. This strikingly bad placebo 


performance likely had several causes, but one important one was age: relative to men who 


received Prostvac, those who received a placebo were much older – indeed, older than any 


group we have come across in any prostate-cancer clinical trial. Researchers have clearly and 


consistently found – as common sense would suggest – that elderly men with prostate cancer, 


compared to their younger counterparts, do in fact live substantially less long. Comparing an 


unexceptional treatment group to an anomalously bad placebo group is a good way to show a 


strong benefit where none truly exists. 





More recent efforts to demonstrate improved survival in patients receiving both Prostvac and the 


cancer drug Yervoy only further underscore Prostvac’s inefficacy. In a 30-patient trial with no 


control group, across a range of Yervoy dose levels, median survival was 31.6 months – 


compared to the ~30-month survival seen over and over again in the control groups of other 


late-stage prostate-cancer studies, a negligible “improvement.” Given that Yervoy itself clearly 


has some standalone anti-tumor activity and has been shown to extend survival by (a non–


statistically significant) 1.2 months even in post-chemo prostate-cancer patients, Prostvac’s 


combination-therapy data look even less impressive. The natural conclusion is that any 


apparent benefit comes from Yervoy; Prostvac itself accomplishes nothing. 





This finding should come as no surprise: the history of therapeutic cancer vaccines is two 


decades of unmitigated failure. We expect nothing different from Bavarian Nordic.

I. Investment Highlights 





 Prostvac’s purported 8.5-month survival benefit is an artifact of a bad control. In 


Prostvac’s Phase II study, which began in late 2003, the Prostvac group lived for 25.1 


months; the placebo group lived for 16.6 months. For the relevant subset of patients – 


men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are minimally 


symptomatic or asymptomatic – 25.1 months is an unremarkable outcome. For instance, 


in the TAX-327 study, initiated back in March 2000, men with minimal symptoms had 


median survival of 25.6 months (1). More recent studies have yielded even better 


results: the control groups in trials for tasquinimod (2), abiraterone (3), enzalutamide (4), 


and orteronel (5), with enrollment start dates ranging from 2007 to 2010, survived 30.4, 


30.3, 30.2, and 29.5 months in trials, respectively. 





Since there is nothing special about Prostvac’s treatment-group performance, the 


purported benefit comes entirely from the anomalously bad performance of the placebo 


group. The original paper conceded that, applying a popular predictive model to a set of 


baseline prognostic factors, the treatment group had a 2.1-month survival “head start” 


(6), and an accompanying editorial (7) further noted (emphasis added): 





[I]t is of concern that the control group had a median overall survival lower than 


that predicted by the Halabi et al. model (16.6 months actual compared with 20.4 


months predicted). The reasons for this discrepancy are not at all clear, 


particularly given the eligibility criteria designed to select lower-risk patients. 





We hypothesize that an important source for this discrepancy is age: the median age in 


the Prostvac group was 71.5 years, while in the placebo group it was 79. We have found 


no group in any other prostate-cancer trial with an age distribution skewed so far to the 


right. The original paper’s authors dismiss this massive imbalance (favoring the Prostvac 


group) with the claim that “age is not a significant prognostic factor in prostate cancer,” 


citing the predictive model published in 2003 by Susan Halabi et al. (8), but this claim is 


wrong. Halabi’s model was based on data from men with a relatively narrow range of 


ages, over which small differences may not matter.  





By contrast, a study focusing specifically on elderly mCRPC patients (aged 75 years and 


older) showed that those in relatively good condition experience median survival of 17.5 


months (9) – very similar to the outcome for the Prostvac placebo group and 


approximately 10 months worse than that for younger men with similar disease 


characteristics (1) (10). Another publication showed that mCRPC patients aged 85 years 


or older have 5-year survival rates that are less than a third of those for younger men 


aged 65-74 (9), while a 2006 study by Halabi et al. noted that 60-to-69-year-olds 


experienced survival similar to that of 70-to-79-year-olds but lived almost twice as long
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 4 





as 80-to-89-year-olds, who constituted roughly half of the Prostvac Phase II placebo 


group (10). 





In short, age does affect overall survival even for men with late-stage prostate cancer, 


likely explaining, at least in part, the Prostvac placebo group’s unusually bad 


performance. Regardless of the cause, though, there is no reason to expect such a bad 


control to recur in the larger Phase III study, set to finish in late 2016 or beyond; thus, 


there is no reason to expect Prostvac to show any benefit. The treatment will fail. 





 Early combination-therapy data confirm the absence of a meaningful survival 


benefit. Although Prostvac’s Phase II study is inarguably the centerpiece of Bavarian 


Nordic’s case for the treatment’s efficacy, the company has recently touted a second, 


more recent study as demonstrating even greater potential benefits. In this Phase I trial 


– which had no control group – patients received the same dose of Prostvac and a range 


of doses of Yervoy (ipilimumab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor produced by Bristol-


Myers (11) (12). Across all doses, median overall survival was 31.6 months. Bavarian 


Nordic likes to portray this as a marked improvement over the Phase II trial’s 25.1-month 


survival, but in reality all comparable mCRPC trials have produced similar results for 


many years, even in placebo groups, stemming from better overall medical care and the 


wide range of other life-extending drugs available to trial participants once their condition 


deteriorates. Bavarian Nordic also likes to benchmark this survival result to the 


aforementioned Halabi 2003 predictive model, but this model, drawing on 15-year-old 


data, is now badly out of line with current clinical outcomes; indeed, it has since been 


superseded by an updated version that gives more optimistic predictions (13). 





One striking illustration of both the inaccuracy of the Halabi 2003 predictive model and 


the mediocrity of the Prostvac/Yervoy data comes from a 2013 paper by Omlin et al. 


examining overall survival for all men with mCRPC participating in any clinical trial from 


2003 to 2011 at one particular healthcare institution: the UK’s Royal Marsden Hospital 


(14). Men with no prior history of chemotherapy (termed “chemotherapy-naïve”) 


experienced median overall survival of 30.6 months, almost identical to the 


Prostvac/Yervoy result; meanwhile, the Halabi model predicted median survival of only 


21 months, 31% worse than the actual outcome. 





Below we take a graph from the Omlin paper, plotting percentage survival against time 


from referral (measured in months) for chemo-naïve Royal Marsden mCRPC patients, 


and superimpose a graph from Bavarian Nordic, plotting the same metrics for 


Prostvac/Yervoy combination-therapy patients. The survival curves are stunningly 


similar, especially considering the small size of the combination trial. Thus, using the 


Royal Marsden data as a surrogate “control” shows that the Prostvac recipients exhibit 


no advantage whatsoever. Consistent with the Phase II trial when taking into account 


age and other prognostic factors, Prostvac, even in combination with Yervoy, appears to 


accomplish nothing. Moreover, as the dark blue curve toward the left shows, the Halabi 


2003 model is simply not a relevant reference point anymore: it badly underestimates

expected survival, especially beyond the first year. It’s ludicrous for Bavarian Nordic to 


congratulate itself for clearing such a low bar.

Another relevant point of comparison is tasquinimod, a drug previously under 


development for mCRPC by Active Biotech and Ipsen. In a 201-patient Phase II trial, 


median overall survival was 33.4 months in the treatment group and 30.4 months in the 


placebo group, a statistically significant difference (2). In April, however, tasquinimod 


development was suspended when a 1,200-patient Phase III trial failed to show any 


survival benefit over placebo. If tasquinimod, despite its track record of 33.4 months of 


expected survival, can’t reliably outperform placebo, then Prostvac, with markedly less 


impressive results under its belt heading into Phase III, is bound to fail. 





 The Prostvac goalposts keep moving. Back in 1999 when researchers conducted the 


first human trial of Prostvac, they highlighted that one of the six subjects saw his serum 


prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a widely used marker of prostate-cancer progression, 


plateau at a low level for months (15). In a 2000 follow-up, the highlight again was stable 


PSA levels and an apparent absence of disease progression in some patients (16). Thus 


the 125-patient Phase II trial had as its primary end point “progression-free survival,” i.e. 


time elapsed without the cancer becoming significantly worse. But these observations of 


supposedly improved disease progression – made without reference to any control 


group – disappeared with larger sample size, and Prostvac failed to deliver the benefit it 


was supposed to. Overall, Prostvac has shown no ability to shrink tumors or prevent 


PSA increases. The strange theory that Prostvac improves overall survival but not

progression-free survival (or any other tangible measure of disease) was only cobbled 


together after the study was over.  





Though some advocates suggest that an absence of progression benefit coupled with a 


real overall-survival benefit is typical of immunotherapy in general, this is false. The 


immune-checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab, for instance – which failed to demonstrate a 


significant overall-survival increase in a large Phase III prostate-cancer study – did show 


a statistically significant 30% reduction in progression risk, and large PSA declines were 


2.5x more frequent for ipilimumab patients than for placebo patients (17). To be sure, 


Dendreon’s prostate-cancer vaccine Provenge has a profile similar to Prostvac’s: a 


purported small survival benefit with no improvement in progression or other indicators 


of disease. But Provenge is not a happy precedent: despite its FDA approval in 2010, 


many clinicians harbored serious doubts about the evidence of its efficacy, and this 


pervasive skepticism (which continues to this day) was a key factor in Provenge’s 


commercial failure and Dendreon’s 2014 bankruptcy filing. 





 Therapeutic cancer vaccines have a long history of failure. Harnessing the immune 


system to battle cancer is an exciting approach that, for certain patient populations, is 


finally starting to bear fruit. Sophisticated immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors and 


adoptive cell transfer have enjoyed some dramatic clinical successes. But simplistic 


therapeutic vaccines like Prostvac are another matter entirely; time and again, they have 


been tremendous disappointments. One review, published in 2004, compiled results 


from many different studies involving different cancers and different types of vaccines 


and concluded that “the overwhelming majority (>96%) of patients in the studies 


evaluated who received vaccine therapy for their underlying cancer did not exhibit 


objective evidence of cancer regression.” An updated review, published in 2011 under 


the title, “Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines: Are We There Yet?" looked at studies released 


in the intervening years and found the same 96% failure rate (18). A review by different 


authors, published in 2014 and focusing specifically on prostate-cancer vaccines, 


compiled 41 studies performed from 2000 to 2012 using a wide range of vaccine 


approaches, from viral vectors to plasmids to peptides, and including 1,100 patients in 


the aggregate – of whom only four enjoyed any tangible improvement in tumor burden. 


The authors summarize: “Vaccinations yielded immunological responses, but no study 


showed evidence for clinically relevant therapeutic improvement” (19). (In the case of 


Prostvac, the data are even less impressive, since even the immunological responses 


have been modest and inconsistent (20).) 





Companies large and small have attempted to defy this track record of failure, only to fall 


flat on their faces: 





 In 2008, Cell Genesys had to terminate two Phase III trials for its GVAX prostate-


cancer vaccine when it became clear that the treatment conferred no survival benefit; 


after its stock price collapsed, the company was forced to sell itself.

 In 2012, Oxford BioMedica abandoned its TroVax prostate-cancer vaccine as a 


result of several factors: difficulties enrolling trial participants; a vast increase in the 


number of life-extending treatment options (like enzalutamide, abiraterone, and 


radium-223) available to men with late-stage prostate cancer; and early results for 


TroVax that gave no sign of meaningful efficacy (21). 


 In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline announced that its Phase III trial of a melanoma vaccine 


had failed to extend disease-free survival in its targeted patient population. 


 In 2014: 


o Merck discontinued development of its non–small-cell lung-cancer vaccine 


tecemotide after it repeatedly failed to show any beneficial effect on overall 


survival or disease progression. 


o GlaxoSmithKline abandoned the Phase III trial of its non–small-cell lung-


cancer vaccine after it failed to show any benefit. 





While Bristol-Myers’ willingness to pay $60mm upfront for an exclusive option on 


Prostvac was undoubtedly a vote of confidence – albeit on a very small scale, and with 


overall deal economics that imply a low probability of success – it would certainly not be 


the first time a large pharmaceutical company stumbled in this field. Moreover, the 


Bristol-Myers deal serves to cap any potential upside for Bavarian Nordic, since, in 


exchange for a series of additional payments that could total $915mm (but are likely to 


be substantially lower even if Prostvac succeeds), it has already traded away the vast 


majority of any future Prostvac revenue. 





There is nothing special or innovative about Prostvac that would enable it to break the 


consistent pattern of failed cancer vaccines; to the contrary, the Prostvac concept is 20 


years old. The entire approach of simply administering tumor-associated antigens and 


hoping for an effective immune response is a dead end. 





 The scientific literature furnishes a multitude of convincing explanations for the 


failure of cancer vaccines. Why do therapeutic cancer vaccines fail to help patients 


even though they sometimes trigger a measurable immune response? One key factor is 


tolerance: the immune system has several mechanisms designed to prevent 


autoimmune attacks on self antigens like PSA, and the vast majority of nascent T cells 


targeting such antigens are killed before they ever exit the thymus. Another important 


factor is what scientists call the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Tumors 


(and the immune system itself via negative-feedback mechanisms (22)) blunt incipient T-


cell attacks in myriad ways. One paper provided the following head-spinning overview 


(23): 





Multiple layers of immune suppression are operational in the tumor environment, 


including other co-inhibitory molecules expressed on T cells such as PD-1/PD-


L1, Tim-3, and LAG-3, Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and soluble 


immunosuppressive mediators such as IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase),

arginase, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, IL-10, VEGF, and other cytokines and 


chemokines. 





This list does not even include the possibility of “immune escape” as tumors evolve to 


downregulate the antigens that T cells have targeted. For example, even if Prostvac 


were to spark an initially effective immune response keyed on cells expressing PSA, the 


cancer might simply stop expressing PSA over time. This effect has been directly 


observed in a murine model of prostate cancer: researchers injected antigen-specific T 


cells into the mice and observed them killing off antigen-positive tumor cells, but this only 


led to the outgrowth of antigen-negative tumor cells and had no impact on the overall 


progression of the tumor (24). 





Even the formidable challenges of immunosuppression and immune escape – which 


have foiled treatments far more robust than Prostvac – presuppose that T cells actually 


manage to traffic into the tumor, another major difficulty. They also presuppose that the 


immune system targets the desired recombinant antigen rather than simply focusing on 


the viral vector itself. Yet research suggests that T-cell responses to recombinant viral 


vectors – i.e. the viruses themselves, not their payload of foreign antigens (PSA in the 


case of Prostvac) – can be 20 to 30 times more intense than responses to the foreign 


antigens (25). This finding, an instance of the broader phenomenon of 


“immunodominance,” is consistent with Prostvac data showing derisory PSA-specific T-


cell responses in vaccinated patients (22); by contrast, typical responses to the vaccinia 


virus itself, one of the vectors for Prostvac, are an order of magnitude stronger. The 


immune system is fighting the vaccine far more diligently than it is attempting to fight the 


cancer. 





Finally, since prostate cancer is primarily a disease of older men, Prostvac also faces 


the problem of “immunosenescence”: immune responses across the board tend to 


deteriorate with age. Indeed, even conventional prophylactic vaccines like the flu vaccine 


are much less effective in elderly populations (26). Therapeutic cancer vaccines 


attempting to overcome strong barriers to autoimmunity and target “self” antigens like 


PSA are unlikely to fare any better. 





In short, a wide array of mechanisms limits the potential effectiveness of therapeutic 


cancer vaccines, including tolerance, immunosuppression, immunodominance, and, for 


prostate cancer, immunosenescence. Prostvac is a weak agent that fails to address 


these daunting challenges, so it should be no surprise that it can’t. 





 Bavarian Nordic’s core business is at risk. While market enthusiasm for Bavarian 


Nordic centers on Prostvac, the company’s only material revenue source in the past 


several years has been the sale of Imvamune, a weaker form of the conventional 


smallpox vaccine intended for people with compromised immune systems, to the US 


government for its “strategic national stockpile.” Notwithstanding the vaccine’s high cost 


and unknown efficacy – the objects of criticism from some of the world’s leading
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 9 





smallpox experts, including the World Health Organization – the government appears 


committed to working with Bavarian Nordic to finalize a new, longer-lasting freeze-dried 


version. But given the likely dramatic increase in shelf life and thus dramatic decline in 


the need for future replenishment, revenue from the freeze-dried vaccine will effectively 


be non-recurring, putting this business’s sustainability in doubt. Moreover, recently 


published research not only demonstrated the similarity of the liquid and freeze-dried 


formulations but also showed that, with a different route of administration (intradermal 


rather than subcutaneous), only 20% of the conventional dose could achieve the same 


level of protection, implying that the Strategic National Stockpile could purchase 5x less 


material from Bavarian Nordic yet cover the same target population (63). At best, this 


discovery will damage the company’s bargaining position; at worst, it will decimate its 


future revenue. 





Investors have come to view Bavarian Nordic as a de-risked bet on a very promising agent, with 


the purported 8.5-month survival improvement at the heart of the long thesis. One sell-side firm 


has gushed, “A significant Phase II survival benefit suggests PROSTVAC immunotherapy has 


the potential to revolutionise prostate cancer treatment.” But Prostvac will revolutionize nothing. 


After taking into account the profound flaws of the Phase II trial as well as the weakness of the 


early combination-therapy results, it’s clear that Prostvac is just as ineffective as every other 


failed cancer vaccine. Bavarian Nordic did not stumble onto the magical key to making this 


doomed approach work; it merely got lucky with a statistical fluke.

Bavarian Nordic is a small vaccine manufacturer based in Kvistgård, Denmark. Founded in 


1994 and taken public in 1998 at a price of DKK 235 per share, Bavarian Nordic was the second 


biotechnology company created by the Danish businessman Asger Aamund. (The first, 


NeuroSearch A/S, founded in 1989, never brought a single product to market, lost almost 100% 


of its equity value, and in 2012 commenced self-liquidation. Aamund has since called it “a 


smoking ruin.”) Originally focused on using the attenuated viral strain called modified vaccinia 


Ankara (MVA) as a delivery vector in treatments for pancreatic cancer, melanoma, breast 


cancer, and HIV, Bavarian Nordic shifted its R&D in the wake of the September 11 attacks 


toward marketing MVA (under the name Imvamune) as a gentler version of the conventional

virus that causes smallpox, is not actually used in the modern smallpox vaccine; its less 


dangerous cousin vaccinia is. But even vaccinia can cause adverse reactions.) Ultimately the 


US government enlisted Bavarian Nordic to supply the Strategic National Stockpile with 28 


million doses of Imvamune (a fraction of the Stockpile’s holdings of the conventional smallpox 


vaccine) under a set of contracts that expired at the end of 2014. These contracts have been 


the company’s only material source of revenue to date. (While Imvamune is Bavarian Nordic’s 


sole commercial success, it may remain forever unknown if it’s actually a clinical success; as 


the Centers for Disease Control explained in a recent set of guidelines “for smallpox vaccine 


use in a postevent vaccination program,” “The efficacy of Imvamune against smallpox is 


unproven and cannot be tested clinically because of the global eradication of the disease in 


humans.”) 





Since inception, Bavarian Nordic had hoped to use its version of MVA as a vehicle for 


therapeutic cancer vaccines but made little progress on its own. In 2008, however, it announced 


a partnership with the US National Cancer Institute under which it acquired the rights to a 


prostate cancer vaccine candidate: Prostvac. In 2011, it also acquired a related experimental 


agent, CVAC-301 (previously known as Panvac). Both vaccines use regular vaccinia (along with 


fowlpox booster shots), not MVA, and trace their roots to Therion Biologics, a defunct 


Massachusetts-based firm that filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2006 after announcing two 


major failures back to back. First, Therion said, Prostvac “did not meet its primary efficacy 


endpoint of improving progression-free survival” in its Phase II trial; then, Panvac, in a Phase III 


trial for advanced pancreatic cancer, “did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of improving 


overall survival compared with palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care.” Therion put 


itself up for sale but found no buyers. In February 2007, the National Cancer Institute took back 


the rights to the vaccines before re-licensing Prostvac to Bavarian Nordic a year later. 





Upon licensing Prostvac, BAVA quickly announced that, despite the vaccine’s failure to meet its 


primary endpoint of progression-free survival, “mature” data showed “a statistically significant 


longer median overall survival,” so it was moving forward to Phase III. In 2010, Bavarian Nordic 


indicated that it was in discussions to find a large partner to help fund the development of 


Prostvac, but in March 2011 management announced that it had judged all of its offers 


unattractive and would go it alone by raising additional capital. By the end of the year, the 


company’s stock price had declined 85% from where it started. Danish newspapers frequently 


reported on the dire financial condition of Asger Aamund, the company’s founder and chairman, 


especially when the leveraged investment vehicle through which he owned a large stake 


reported negative equity starting in 2011, surviving only via the forbearance of Aamund’s 


bankers. (As the stock price recovered Aamund stepped down from the chairman role and, in 


January 2015 – prior to the Bristol-Myers announcement – his vehicle sold all of its shares.) 





Despite this checkered history, Bavarian Nordic got a new lease on life in late 2014 when it 


announced a deal with Johnson & Johnson to supply an MVA-based boost to complement the 


experimental adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine that a J&J unit had been developing. The deal 


included $45mm in license and milestone payments, approximately $100mm in exchange for

millions of doses to be delivered in 2015, and a $43 million equity investment to replenish 


Bavarian Nordic’s coffers. But while this Ebola transaction has helped keep Bavarian Nordic 


afloat despite the temporary lapsing of its crucial US smallpox contract in 2015 (since restored 


by a recently announced new order for deliveries in 2016-17), it is unlikely to contribute much to 


Bavarian Nordic’s long-term value. After all, the West African Ebola outbreak, while not 


completely resolved, has already subsided dramatically, raising questions about whether 


ongoing Phase III trials of the two most promising vaccine candidates, which have substantial 


development head starts over J&J’s candidate and do not require the complexities of a 


secondary boost, can even be completed. Moreover, Bavarian Nordic is not even the only small 


company offering MVA-based Ebola-vaccine boosts: Emergent BioSolutions is already working 


with GlaxoSmithKline on a similar project using its own version of MVA, which might be easier 


to manufacture than Bavarian Nordic’s. Thus, the notion that Bavarian Nordic will get rich off of 


mass Ebola vaccinations is now looking less realistic than ever. 





But before the Ebola hype could fizzle (though after Bavarian Nordic’s founder, ex-chairman, 


and former largest shareholder sold a massive stake), Bavarian Nordic announced its 


partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, putting the spotlight squarely on the putative prostate-


cancer treatment Prostvac. Shareholders have benefited from undiscriminating market 


enthusiasm for anything related to cancer immunotherapy. But “immunotherapy” is a broad term 


that encompasses both highly effective agents, like checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma, and 


totally ineffective agents, like simplistic therapeutic vaccines that have never had a meaningful 


clinical impact on any cancer over decades of research. Prostvac belongs to the latter category. 


As we will demonstrate, its vaunted Phase II survival benefit is meaningless, and other small-


scale trials confirm Prostvac’s inefficacy.

III. Prostvac’s Clinical Trial Results Are Weak 





Bavarian Nordic typically presents its Prostvac results to investors in the following way: 





 
Source: Bavarian Nordic April 2015 presentation, slide 22 





Both graphs plot overall survival against time: the percentage of patients still alive a given 


number of months after the commencement of the trial. In the graph on the left, the red line 


shows overall survival (OS) for the Prostvac treatment group, with a median OS of 25.1 months; 


the light blue line shows OS for the placebo group, which initially received “empty” (non-


recombinant) vaccinia and fowlpox injections, with a median OS of 16.6 months. The difference 


in median OS, a standard measure of treatment efficacy, is 8.5 months, although the survival 


curves only begin to separate a year after randomization. The graph on the right, based on a 


more recent study, shows OS for patients who received both Prostvac and a range of doses of 


the checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab; there was no control group, but the implied message is that 


the Prostvac/ipi combination is 6.5 months (31.6 – 25.1) better than Prostvac alone, which is 


itself supposedly 8.5 months better than placebo.  





But there is less to these results than meets the eye. Compared to similar patients in a host of 


other prostate-cancer trials, neither the Prostvac group in the Phase II study nor the Prostvac/ipi 


recipients in the Phase I study survived particularly long. (Moreover, there was no sign of a 


clinical benefit other than the purported survival advantage.) The OS figures only look good in 


comparison to the Phase II placebo group, which was substantially sicker and older and 


sustained a surprisingly high death rate. Setting aside this uninformative and misleading 


benchmark, there is no evidence that Prostvac helps patients.

The Phase II Trial Was Flawed and Shows No Meaningful Benefit 





The core idea of Prostvac is to expose the patient’s immune system to prostate-specific antigen 


(PSA) – a protein almost exclusively expressed by prostate cells and used as a biomarker of 


prostate cancer – in conjunction with a mild viral infection. Initial efforts (15) involved only the 


vaccinia virus, engineered to carry the gene for PSA, but by the time of the Phase II trial 


researchers had made several additions: 


 a series of follow-up boosts using a different recombinant virus, fowlpox, also 


engineered to express PSA; 


 for both the vaccinia and fowlpox vectors, genes encoding a grab bag of proteins 


(dubbed “TRICOM”) intended to further stimulate immune responses, including the 


CD28 (costimulatory) and CTLA-4 (co-inhibitory) ligand B7-1 and the adhesion 


molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3; and 


 an adjuvant, granulocyte macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thought 


to provide yet more immune stimulation. 





The hope is that these components will combine to generate an effective T-cell response aimed 


specifically at PSA-expressing tumor cells.* (With a treatment this complex – vaccinia-PSA-


TRICOM + fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM + GM-CSF – the trial was bound to be difficult to interpret, 


since any effect identified might stem from PSA, TRICOM, GM-CSF, or any combination 


thereof, not just the preferred causal pathway of PSA.) A natural hypothesis is that the sought-


after T-cell response, even if it fell short of eliminating tumors, might at least slow down the 


progression of the disease, and that is indeed what the Prostvac Phase II trial, initiated in 2003, 


was designed to assess (6): 





The planned primary end point was PFS [progression-free survival] defined as 


identification of two or more new sites of bone metastasis on the bone scan compared 


with the baseline scan, or an increase in the sum of measurable target lymph node 


metastasis on CT scan by >20% according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 


Tumors (RECIST) criteria compared with baseline. Patients who developed clinical signs 


or symptoms of progression but who did not meet the radiologic criteria were also 


considered to have progressed at the discretion of the investigator. 





But Prostvac did not meaningfully improve progression-free survival: median PFS in the 


treatment arm was 3.8 months, essentially identical to the placebo arm’s 3.7 months, and by six 


months the percentage of the treatment arm that had progressed was actually slightly higher 


(worse) than that of the placebo arm. These results, analyzed under the aegis of Prostvac’s 


“initial industrial sponsor” Therion, helped drive the company into bankruptcy, but, many months 


later, Prostvac rose from the ashes, as a 2008 newspaper article explained: 








* There is an additional hope that initial success in killing PSA-expressing cells will lead to the release of 


other tumor-associated antigens that will in turn generate their own immune responses, leading to so-


called antigen spread beyond PSA alone.

Therion shut down in 2006 after disappointing clinical trial results from a cancer vaccine 


that didn’t pass late-stage clinical trials. 





Investors pulled the plug. But Prostvac’s Phase II trial results were still pending. Much of 


its technology was developed by both Therion and the National Cancer Institute, to 


which the Prostvac rights reverted after NCI sued Therion’s investors. Danish company 


Bavarian Nordic got to claim all the glory instead. Financial details weren’t disclosed, but 


Bavarian Nordic licensed the drug not too long ago from the National Cancer Institute. 





Bavarian Nordic took the initial study results and called patients from the trial to see who 


had survived over the past four years. That data follow-up led to the good news 


announced earlier this month. 





As a result of the trial’s disjointed management, researchers had no information about 


treatments received by the patients after they went “off study”; an imbalance in those 


treatments, like a greater fraction of Prostvac-group members than placebo-group members 


going on to take the life-extending chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel, could easily have 


distorted overall-survival comparisons. Moreover, once study participants saw their disease 


progress, they were unblinded with respect to group membership, after which 19 of the 40 


patients in the placebo group opted to try Prostvac. Thus, while the original progression-free-


survival criterion used a “clean” comparison of Prostvac to no Prostvac, the overall-survival 


analysis compared a treatment group, all of which received Prostvac, to a “placebo” group, half 


of which had also received the treatment. If Prostvac did indeed enhance survival, the 


anomalously bad survival of the placebo arm would be even more mysterious, since half of its 


members actually received the treatment only a few months later than their peers in the other 


arm. 





In reality, though, Prostvac’s OS results were not impressive. The trial only enrolled men with 


mCRPC who were minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, meaning, among other things, that 


they had not previously received chemotherapy, had no visceral metastases, had Gleason 


scores (a histological measure of cancer severity) less than 8, and so on; in short, they were in 


relatively good condition. Below we take the survival results from another trial in a similar 


population – the Phase III, placebo-controlled study of abiraterone (Zytiga) in “asymptomatic or 


mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naive prostate cancer” (3) – and superimpose 


them over the OS graph from the Prostvac Phase II paper. Not only does the abiraterone arm, 


with median OS of 34.7 months, dramatically and consistently outperform the Prostvac arm; so 


too does the abiraterone study’s placebo arm, with median OS of 30.3 months. Meanwhile, the 


Prostvac-trial placebo group looks terrible relative to the corresponding group in the abiraterone, 


dying off at a much higher rate.

Overall Survival: Abiraterone & Control vs. Prostvac & Control 


 
Source: Ryan et al. 2015 (3), Kantoff et al. 2010 (6), Kerrisdale analysis 





But it’s not just abiraterone (and its placebo group) that makes Prostvac look bad. Below we 


compile survival data from a range of major studies involving minimally symptomatic, primarily 


chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC. The Prostvac treatment arm is clearly nothing special, 


even relative to older studies. For example, minimally symptomatic men enrolled in the TAX-327 


study of docetaxel (initiated back in 2000) had median OS of 25.6 months, while even placebo 


groups in somewhat more recent studies of tasquinimod, orteronel, and enzalutamide had 


median OS of ~30 months. Without an anomalously bad control group to make it look better, 


Prostvac on its own would appear no better than a typical placebo (and perhaps slightly worse). 


Even worse, several of the treatments that outperformed Prostvac in comparable minimally 


symptomatic populations – GVAX, tasquinimod, and orteronel – failed to meet OS endpoints in 


Phase III trials, while Provenge is a controversial commercial flop. Prostvac’s failure to outshine 


treatments that themselves have been abandoned as failures is obviously a bad omen for its 


own Phase III success. 





With respect to Provenge, while the headline performance of the sipuleucel-T (Provenge) 


placebo group – median OS of 21.7 months – is somewhat worse than that of the Prostvac 


treatment group, the Provenge data are themselves still hotly debated, and some have argued 


that the “placebo” regimen (which entailed the removal of white blood cells from circulation) 


actually harmed patients, reducing their overall survival (27). If so, the Provenge “placebo” 


group would clearly be an inappropriate benchmark since it would be easy to beat. Even setting 


aside that hypothesis, the Provenge trial participants had worse baseline disease characteristics 


than the Prostvac trial participants. For instance, 18% had previously gone through 


chemotherapy (0% for Prostvac), implying a more advanced disease state, and 25% had

Gleason scores greater than 7 (0% for Prostvac), implying more aggressive tumors (27). Thus, 


the fact that the Prostvac treatment group’s median OS was slightly higher than the Provenge 


placebo group’s says very little, given that the former was clearly in better health to begin with. 





Similarly, the headline results for GVAX showed 20.7 months of median OS for the treatment 


group and 21.7 months for the docetaxel control, worse than the results for the Prostvac 


treatment group. However, 47% of these patients had Gleason scores of 8 or higher, and 13% 


had visceral metastases, both of which predict poor survival. When researchers looked only at 


men with relatively good prognoses (predicted survival greater than 18 months based on the 


Halabi 2003 model), median OS for GVAX approached 30 months, and even the placebo group 


enjoyed median OS of 27.1 months. As with the Provenge data, while the headline figures for 


GVAX may appear to put Prostvac in a positive light, closer scrutiny and proper apples-to-


apples comparisons reveal a consistent story: patients treated with Prostvac experience 


unremarkable outcomes, little different from similar patients treated with placebo.

Prostvac, and it can be a useful summary of key prognostic factors; patients with lower Halabi-


predicted survival do in fact tend to die sooner. But it’s a flawed and out-of-date benchmark, as 


its creators readily admit (13), and in real-world patient groups, survival typically exceeds what 


the model forecasts, sometimes by a large margin. Below we highlight the difference between 


forecasted and actual median OS in several mCRPC studies that provide these data: 





Predicted and Actual Survival in mCRPC 





Source: Kantoff et al. 2010 (6), Kantoff et al. 2010 (28), Higano et al. 2009 (29), Omlin et al. 2013 (14), Kerrisdale 


analysis 





For patients treated in clinical trials at the Royal Marsden Hospital, including many who received 


experimental agents that proved to be ineffective, median OS exceeded the Halabi 2003 


forecast by 9.5 months. By contrast, the Prostvac treatment group only outperformed the model 


by 2.6 months – the worst of any treatment group. Both the GVAX treatment and placebo 


groups enjoyed substantially better relative performance compared to Prostvac – yet the GVAX 


trial was a complete failure.  





What stands out from this table once more is the unusually bad outcome in the Prostvac 


placebo group – the only one that actually did worse than the otherwise overly conservative 


Halabi 2003 model predicted. Ordinarily, randomization alone is supposed to roughly equalize 


the baseline patient characteristics in a well-run clinical trial, leaving no important imbalances 


between arms. In the Prostvac trial, however, randomization apparently didn’t do the trick, 


resulting in a “head start” for the treatment group, according to the Halabi 2003 model, of 2.1 


months. However, this model understates the true magnitude of the “head start,” because it 


neglects a key element: age. 





Below we return to the same set of mCRPC studies already reviewed and compile median ages 


for the treatment and control groups. (When sub-group ages are not available, we show the 


figures for the overall populations.) Across all non-Prostvac studies, the median of the median 


ages is 71 years, right in line with the median age in the Prostvac treatment group. However, 


the Prostvac control group is a major outlier at 79 years old. No other group is anywhere close, 


and no other study has anything like the 7.5-year discrepancy in median age between treatment 


and control arms seen in the Prostvac study; the second-largest gap, in the sipuleucel-T trial, is 


only 2 years, and it favors the placebo arm, not the treatment arm. The opposite is true for 


Prostvac: younger patients disproportionately received the vaccine.

The Prostvac Phase II paper acknowledges the age imbalance but dismisses its importance 


with a brief phrase – “age is not a significant prognostic factor in prostate cancer” – and a 


citation to the Halabi 2003 model. To be sure, this model does not make use of age in order to 


predict survival. However, as we have already seen, the Halabi 2003 model is outdated, 


drawing on clinical trials conducted between 1992 and 1998, and, like any model, it does not 


capture all the relevant factors. Furthermore, the learning sample used to construct the model 


suffers from a fairly narrow age range, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 65 to 75. This is 


similar to (albeit younger than) the Prostvac treatment group’s IQR of 67 to 79 but looks quite 


different from the control group’s IQR of 72 to 83, with a 7-to-8-year shift in the elderly direction. 


In other words, the data on which the Halabi 2003 model was built come from a substantially 


younger population than the Prostvac control group, making it hazardous to extrapolate from 


one to the other.

Although there aren’t many studies that specifically examine the relationship between age and 


survival in mCRPC, the available evidence makes it clear that, as common sense would dictate, 


elderly men with mCRPC tend to have fewer years ahead of them than their younger 


counterparts. One of the most direct illustrations comes from a retrospective study reviewing 


“the clinical files of 175 patients aged ≥ 75 yr with CRPC treated with first-line docetaxel in nine 


French tertiary care cancer centres from 2000 to 2007” (30). Median age was 78 years; notably, 


then, a study specifically focused on “elderly patients” actually had a median age one year 


younger than that of the Prostvac control group. Median OS among these elderly patients on 


docetaxel was 15 months – very different from the ~25 to 30 months seen in mainstream 


studies but similar to the 16.6 months seen in the Prostvac control group. Better still, when 


researchers disaggregated survival based on “performance status” – a simple measure of 


patient health in which 0 means “fully active,” 1 indicates restrictions on “physically strenuous” 


activity only, 2 and 3 indicate wider-ranging restrictions, and 4 means death – they found that 


elderly patients with performance statuses of 0 or 1 had median OS of 17.5 months, slightly 


higher than the Prostvac control group, 100% of which had a performance status of 0 or 1. 


Similarly, elderly patients without visceral disease had median OS of 16.4 months, almost 


identical to the Prostvac control group, 100% of which likewise lacked visceral disease. Below 


we combine the survival curve from the Prostvac control group (in blue) with the survival curve 


from the retrospective French study for men 75 and older with performance status of 0 or 1 (in 


red-orange). The curves are effectively indistinguishable.

These data are consistent with other lines of evidence clearly demonstrating that age is, in fact, 


a prognostic factor in mCRPC. One recent publication, based on detailed registry data from 


2000 to 2009, showed that survival rates for men with metastatic prostate cancer clearly do 


differ by age; for instance, comparing men 85 or older with those aged 65-74 and looking out 


five years from diagnosis, the older men are less than a third as likely to still be alive (9).  





Metastatic Prostate Cancer: 5-Year Survival Probability by Age Group

A 2006 study by Halabi et al. came to a similar conclusion (10), noting that “[t]he results of this 


analysis support the hypothesis that older men [with mCRPC] have a worse prognosis than their 


younger counterparts,” with 60-to-69-year-olds enjoying similar survival to 70-79-year-olds – 


likely accounting for the misperception in other studies that age doesn’t matter – but surviving 


almost twice as long as 80-89-year-olds (who constituted roughly half of the Prostvac Phase II 


placebo group). Below we summarize additional data points on median OS among elderly men 


with mCRPC. While each study has its limitations, together they paint a fairly consistent picture, 


especially the older studies: median OS in the mid-teens, with a potential improvement indicated 


in the large-scale abiraterone trial.

Median Overall Survival in Elderly Men with mCRPC 





 
Source: studies noted in “Ref” column, Kerrisdale analysis 





In sum, the results of the Prostvac Phase II study are badly confounded by age differences, and 


the likely magnitude of the age impact could well be so large as to eliminate any apparent 


benefit of Prostvac over placebo. Rather than measure the efficacy of Prostvac, the study 


actually measured the survival advantage of being younger rather than older. In the COU-AA-


302 trial for abiraterone, for instance, younger (<75 years old) men on abiraterone experienced 


median OS 6.7 months higher than their older counterparts, while men on placebo saw a 5.3-


month benefit from age alone. Alternatively, consider again the results of the subgroup analysis 


from the main Provenge Phase III study, initiated around the same time as the Prostvac Phase 


II study: placebo recipients who went on take docetaxel had median OS of 27.1 months. 


Meanwhile, based on the French study, elderly men in good condition taking docetaxel have 


median OS of only 17.5 months. This implies an almost 10-month advantage in median 


overall survival based purely on an age difference comparable to that observed in the 


Prostvac Phase II study. Thus Prostvac’s apparent 8.5-month survival benefit plausibly stems 


entirely from the age imbalance, with no room left over for Prostvac itself to have any benefit. 





While this age-based hypothesis is compelling and makes sense of the otherwise bizarre 


underperformance of the Prostvac control group, the explanation for this underperformance is 


less important than the indisputable fact that the control group represents an uninformative 


benchmark. Beating such an anomalously bad result is not much of an achievement. If the 


treatment group’s overall survival were itself more impressive, standing out relative to other 


comparable studies, then the weakness of the control group might not matter; in reality, though, 


the treatment group shows no meaningful advantage over other studies’ placebo arms, let alone 


patients who received clearly beneficial drugs like abiraterone and enzalutamide. There is 


simply nothing there to see. Prostvac does not enhance survival. 





Early-Stage Combination-Therapy Data Further Demonstrate Prostvac’s Inefficacy 





Though Prostvac’s Phase III results will only be available in late 2016 or 2017, we already have 


additional confirmation of its inefficacy via the very combination study that Bavarian Nordic touts

as demonstrating its promise. In that study, 30 patients received both Prostvac and the 


checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab (Yervoy), with different sub-groups receiving 1, 3, 5, and 10 


mg/kg doses of ipilimumab. There was no placebo or other comparison group, and, given the 


small sample size, “[t]here was no significant difference in overall survival on the basis of dose” 


(13), although Bavarian Nordic likes to ignore such statistical niceties and highlight the 37.2-


month median OS in the 15-person cohort receiving the highest ipilimumab dose. Across all 


doses, however, the median OS was only 31.6 months, a result that, while superior to the 


Prostvac-only Phase II study, looks pedestrian relative to the other large mCRPC trials already 


reviewed and is worse, for example, than what tasquinimod achieved in a much larger Phase II 


study. (Tasquinimod’s developer has since announced that the drug failed to outperform 


placebo in an even larger Phase III.) 





Below we superimpose the survival curve from the Prostvac/ipilimumab trial over the data 


generated by all clinical-trial participants at the UK’s Royal Marsden Hospital from 2003 to 2011. 


Relative to this historical control, the Prostvac combination data have nothing to recommend 


them. Moreover, the graph again underscores the irrelevance of the Halabi 2003 model as a 


baseline for expected survival since it badly underestimates real-world outcomes. 








Prostvac/Ipilimumab Survival Data Compared to Royal Marsden Historical Control

Even if the combination trial had produced better results, the obvious question would be to what 


degree those results were attributable to Prostvac or to ipilimumab. While ipilimumab has so far 


produced disappointing survival outcomes in post-chemotherapy mCRPC (19), the drug is 


indisputably biologically active (leading to immune-related adverse effects) and has well-


established efficacy in melanoma; many prostate-cancer researchers and clinicians continue to

hold out hope that it will prove to increase survival in the right patient subset, such as men with 


earlier-stage disease or no visceral metastases. (Among those with “favourable prognostic 


features” in the post-chemotherapy ipilimumab-monotherapy trial, median OS for the treatment 


group exceeded that for the placebo group by 6.9 months.) Thus Prostvac/ipilimumab 


combination therapy might ultimately work simply because ipilimumab might work in prostate 


cancer, not because Prostvac itself has any effect. Indeed, not only was median OS 


unimpressive; the combination therapy also failed to elicit a meaningful immune response to 


Prostvac’s targeted antigen, PSA. Of nine evaluable patients, only two demonstrated any 


detectable increase in their T-cell immune response to PSA, of which one was close to the 


lower bound of detectability. In fact, one patient who showed a T-cell response to PSA prior to 


vaccination saw a decline in the magnitude of his response after vaccination (13). As we will 


detail further, numerous other Prostvac studies reveal the same type of negligible and 


inconsistent immune response to PSA, calling into question Prostvac’s entire raison d'être. Even 


if Prostvac performed as intended, it would likely still fail to help patients, but it appears to fall 


short of even that low standard.  





Interestingly, there is a clear precedent for the failure of a vaccine to add any value in 


combination with a checkpoint inhibitor: the Phase III trial of ipilimumab for melanoma (32). That 


study contained three arms: 1) ipilimumab plus gp100, a peptide vaccine targeted at a 


melanoma-associated glycoprotein; 2) ipilimumab alone; and 3) gp100 alone. While vaccine-


only patients experienced median OS of 6.4 months, ipilimumab-only patients saw 10.1 months, 


while ipilimumab/vaccine combination patients saw an almost identical 10.0 months. In short, 


the vaccine contributed nothing whatsoever to the efficacy of ipilimumab in melanoma, just as 


Prostvac appears to contribute nothing in prostate cancer. 





Prostvac Does Not Slow Disease Progression or Elicit Significant Immune 


Responses 





Since the purpose of Prostvac is to trigger an immune response to the patient’s cancer, 


centered (at least initially) on the tumor-associated antigen PSA, it would seem logical to expect 


the treatment to slow down disease progression. However, as previously discussed, the Phase 


II study failed to show any improvement in progression-free survival. A smaller Phase II study, 


pairing Prostvac with docetaxel, produced similar results: the 14 patients in the Prostvac-only 


group saw median time to progression of 1.8 months, while the 14 patients in the 


Prostvac/docetaxel combination group saw median time to progression of 3.2 months, almost 


identical to the 3.7 months experienced by a historical control using docetaxel only on the same 


dose and schedule and in a similar patient population at the same institution where the trial was 


conducted (33). In other words, Prostvac plus docetaxel led to the same time to progression as 


would be expected for docetaxel alone, consistent with Prostvac’s failure to improve 


progression-free survival in the larger Phase II study. Moreover, in a 2011 review of several 


different prostate-cancer treatments that analyzed changes in the growth rate of circulating PSA 


levels, under the theory that effective treatments would tend to cause PSA measurements to

increase more slowly (even if they didn’t cause PSA to actually decline), researchers found that 


Prostvac again failed to have any measurable impact (34) (bold added): 





Thus, the data...show that successive chemotherapy regimens have achieved greater 


efficacy as evidenced by both greater reductions in g [PSA growth rate], and a greater 


number of patients achieving a complete PSA response. Such an effect, however, was 


not observed with the PSA-TRICOM vaccine where on-study g values were not 


statistically different (t-test, P = 0.46), from pre-enrollment g values for patients 


receiving vaccine. 





Not only was the change in PSA growth rate induced by Prostvac not statistically significant; it 


was indistinguishable from zero, with the log daily growth rate going from -2.0 to -2.1. While the 


authors, taking Prostvac’s putative 8.5-month survival benefit at face value, cast about for some 


plausible explanation of the inconsistency between, on the one hand, the vaccine’s strange 


inability to at least slow down increases in PSA levels and, on the other hand, its apparent 


clinical efficacy, Occam’s razor dictates a simpler conclusion: Prostvac is ineffective across the 


board. It doesn’t slow down PSA growth, just like it doesn’t slow down other measures of 


disease progression, just like it doesn’t actually enhance overall survival outside of one distorted 


and misleading Phase II study. 





Furthermore, notwithstanding strained rhetoric to the contrary, Prostvac barely elicits any 


measurable immune responses. This runs counter to its entire proposed mechanism of action: 


in the words of one study, Prostvac “is a novel vector-based vaccine designed to generate a 


robust immune response against prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing tumor cells” (22). 


Prostvac advocates readily admit that the vaccine does not induce a humoral immune response 


to PSA, with almost no patients generating anti-PSA antibodies. (This is itself somewhat 


peculiar: even Provenge, a dendritic-cell vaccine that targets prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), 


not PSA, has been shown to cause a two-fold or greater increase in PSA-specific antibodies in 


39% of patients (35).) However, they argue that there is “clear evidence of immune responses 


to PSA in the majority of patients post-vaccination” – specifically, T-cell responses. 





But on closer inspection, those responses amount to very little. Below we show the key table 


from a recent review paper summarizing T-cell responses to Prostvac across a number of 


different small studies (22).
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 26 








First, consider the “percentage of patients with PSA+ ELISPOT,” which refers to the fraction of 


evaluated patients who demonstrate a meaningful level of PSA-specific T cells post-vaccination. 


(Requiring at least a 2-fold increase in the ELISPOT assay is fairly conventional, although some 


researchers argue for stricter and more rigorous rules (36) (37).) Across six different patient 


groups, the fraction of individuals who experienced any PSA-specific T-cell response ranged 


from 11% to 74%, averaging just 57% in aggregate; equivalently, 43% experienced no change 


in PSA-specific T-cell levels. By the standards of ordinary prophylactic vaccines, this is a 


stunningly weak result. 





Even for the patients who did record an increase in PSA-specific T cells, the absolute 


magnitude of the response was tiny. While the table draws attention to the five-fold median 


increase in PSA-specific T cells (among the slender majority of patients experiencing an 


increase), which might sound impressive, it is a large increase off of a very low baseline. The 


median level of post-vaccine PSA-specific T cells is only 30 per million PBMCs (peripheral blood 


mononuclear cells). For reference, the following chart depicts the T-cell responses that were 


obtained by unsuccessful viral-vector vaccines for several major infectious diseases (38). The 


figures range from a low of 195 per million to a high of 5,090 per million, one to two orders of 


magnitude higher than the PSA-specific response elicited by Prostvac (in the fraction of patients 


who experienced any meaningful response at all).

Immunogenicity of Prostvac vs. Other T-Cell-Inducing Vaccines 








Source: Gilbert 2011 (38), Kerrisdale analysis 


Includes all viral-vector vaccines from Gilbert 2011 Table 1 (and thus excludes DNA and BCG vaccines and sip-T). 





Indeed, analysts looking at ELISPOT results to assess T-cell-based treatments typically expect 


hundreds or thousands of spots per million PBMCs, not the minuscule 30 seen with Prostvac; in 


fact, some researchers regard 25 per million as the lower limit of detection, and others require 


more than 50 or 55 spots before regarding responses as meaningful (36) (37). When used as a 


smallpox vaccine, vaccinia virus itself – the vector for the Prostvac prime injection – causes a 


median specific T-cell response of ~300 per million PBMCs (39). Thus, the typical vaccinia-


specific T-cell response is at least 10x larger than the typical PSA-specific T-cell response 


caused by Prostvac. It is counterintuitive, to say the least, to suggest that such a tiny immune 


response, 10 or 100 times weaker than what typical vaccines produce, could overcome the 


manifold immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with cancer and confer any clinical 


benefit.

This phenomenon has not escaped the notice of other researchers. A recent review paper on 


cancer vaccines made the same point using a slightly different metric, explicitly calling out 


Prostvac along the way and dubbing results of its ilk “disheartening” (emphasis added) (69): 





Two of the most effective human viral vaccines, YF-vax for yellow fever and Dryvax for 


small pox induce a CD8 T-cell population of around 5-30% of the entire CD8 


population in the peripheral blood....In comparison to these viral vaccine regimes in 


healthy hosts, current cancer vaccines only induce around a 2-fold to 10-fold increase in 


antigen specific T-cells. Prostvac...increased the number of PSA specific T-cells in 


patients by on average 5-fold to produce 30 vaccine specific cells per million PBMCs. 


This number is around 0.03% of the total CD8 T-cell population. 





Consider another data point from a recent study published in Science: a single non–small-cell–


lung-cancer (NSCLC) patient who enjoyed an “exceptional response” to pembrolizumab, an 


anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. Trying to determine what drove this response, researchers 


discovered a large increase in CD8+ T cells targeting a particular patient-specific mutation in the 


HERC1 gene. After administration of pembrolizumab, these mutation-targeting T cells expanded 


to 400-440 per million PBMCs within the first several weeks of treatment – 13 to 15 times higher 


than the maximum PSA-specific immune response generated by Prostvac. 256 days after 


treatment, the researchers wrote, “this T cell response returned to levels just above 


background” (40). But the minimum magnitude of this T-cell response, characterized as “just 


above background,” was equal to the maximum T-cell response seen with Prostvac (30 per 


million). This case study reveals the hollowness of some of the excuses made for Prostvac’s 


derisory immunogenicity, like the notion that perhaps the sought-after PSA-specific T cells 


migrate into tumors and thus evade detection in the peripheral blood. This NSCLC patient 


clearly benefited from pembrolizumab and clearly mounted a tumor-specific T-cell response, 


and this response was fully detectable in multiple blood samples.

All of this evidence is consistent: 


 Prostvac does not improve progression-free survival. 


 Prostvac does not cause PSA levels to decline. 


 Prostvac does not reduce the rate of increase in PSA levels. 


 Prostvac does not trigger the production of PSA-specific antibodies. 


 Prostvac fails to elicit any measurable PSA-specific T-cell response in a large fraction of 


patients and only elicits a minuscule immune response in the others. 


 Prostvac does not produce noticeably better overall survival than what’s seen with 


placebo in numerous other mCRPC trials. 


 Prostvac only appears to enhance overall survival when compared with an anomalously 


poor placebo group, likely because of imbalances in age and other prognostic factors. 





In short, Prostvac is ineffective across the board. It’s worthless. 





There’s nothing remarkable about this conclusion: time after time, similar approaches to 


therapeutic vaccines for cancer have failed. Simply loading up a viral vector with a tumor-


associated antigen – in particular, a normal self-antigen that the immune system has spent 


decades “learning” to tolerate, unlike the mutated, often patient-specific tumor neoantigens to 


which checkpoint inhibitors appear to unleash responses – has never worked, and scientists 


now understand the many reasons why such approaches cannot succeed. There is no good 


reason to believe that Prostvac will be an exception to this pattern.

IV. Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines Have a Long History of 


Failure 





Eleven years ago, Steven A. Rosenberg and two co-authors took stock of cancer 


immunotherapy research and noted that the vaccine approach, which had initially generated a 


lot of excitement, did not seem to be panning out (41): 





Great progress has been made in the field of tumor immunology in the past decade, but 


optimism about the clinical application of currently available cancer vaccine approaches 


is based more on surrogate endpoints than on clinical tumor regression. In our cancer 


vaccine trials of 440 patients, the objective response rate was low (2.6%), and 


comparable to the results obtained by others.  





... In the field of cancer immunotherapy, most enthusiasm has been directed at the use 


of cancer vaccines—active immunizations designed to treat growing tumors. A recent 


review of dendritic cell vaccines mentioned 98 published studies involving over 1,000 


patients. A tabulation in 2003 listed 216 ongoing vaccine clinical trials in cancer patients. 


These studies were conducted, and others are underway, despite the absence of 


convincing animal data that cancer vaccines used alone can affect invasive, 


vascularized tumors. 





...[I]nvestigators have been enthusiastic about the use of active immunization for 


patients with solid tumors because of an over-reliance on surrogate and subjective 


endpoints, such as histologic evidence of tumor necrosis or lymphocyte infiltration, rather 


than objective cancer regressions. Thus, despite the absence of any significant 


proportion of patients who achieved clinical responses, many cancer vaccine trials have 


been optimistically reported because surrogate or subjective endpoints were achieved. 





In light of these very large numbers of patients treated with vaccines and the 


exceedingly low objective response rates reported for the cancer types included in Table 


5, a reevaluation of future directions for cancer immunotherapy trials would be valuable. 





Rosenberg is today regarded as one of the great pioneers of effective cancer immunotherapy, 


and he and his collaborators have achieved stunning clinical results, including apparent cures, 


using non-vaccine immunotherapies like adoptive cell transfers. In stark contrast, the vaccine 


approach has continued to flounder. In 2011, Rosenberg’s group reviewed post-2004 vaccine 


data and again found them lacking. Below we reproduce a key table showing the paucity of 


objective responses (i.e. tumor shrinkage or elimination) across a wide array of vaccine types 


(peptide, dendritic cell, virus, protein, tumor cell, and plasmid DNA) and a wide range of cancer 


types (melanoma, prostate, kidney, lung, breast, brain, esophagus, urothelial, gynecologic, 


thyroid, prostate, colorectal, mesothelioma, and head and neck):

Evidence of improvement in overall survival was also difficult to find, with no results in 


melanoma, kidney, or lung cancer and questionable results in prostate cancer: 





 
Source: Klebanoff 2011 (20) 





As the authors argue, the apparent success of sipuleucel-T (Provenge) may be illusory: 





This pattern of increased survival in the absence of objective responses or a delay in 


time to progression runs counter to previous experience with conventional cytotoxic 


chemotherapies where either disease regression or stabilization of disease was 


correlated with improvements in overall survival. As such, these findings have been met 


with caution and reserve among some investigators.

They point out that sipuleucel-T patients tended to receive docetaxel earlier and more frequently 


than placebo patients and that, relative to the TAX-327 median OS for minimally symptomatic 


men of 25.6 months, the 25.8 months achieved by sipuleucel-T does not look like an 


improvement. They go on to criticize the Prostvac trial on similar grounds: 





In a separate prostate cancer vaccine trial using a heterologous prime-boost regimen 


with recombinant pox-viruses encoding PSA, a significant improvement in overall 


survival was also observed, although the study’s primary end-point of improved time to 


progression was not met. However, several confounding factors with this trial have been 


brought to attention. Specifically, there were apparent imbalances between the two 


groups such that survival in the control arm was far less than would be predicted based 


on established nomograms. Additionally, no information regarding subsequent therapies 


such as docetaxel was reported, limiting the ability to determine the extent to which 


differences in outcome may be attributed to the effects of the experimental vaccines 


versus those of established therapies. 





This skepticism toward simplistic therapeutic cancer vaccines like Prostvac is not some fringe 


viewpoint; it’s widely shared. In a recent review entitled “Vaccines and Melanoma,” the authors 


summarize the history of the field with the phrase, “Previous vaccine approaches in melanoma: 


some promise, but limited clinical activity,” noting that “vaccines have resulted in the induction of 


immune responses, although clinical benefit has not been clearly documented” (42). In another 


influential publication, entitled “Oncology Meets Immunology: The Cancer-Immunity Cycle,” the 


authors write (59): 





Attempts to activate or introduce cancer antigen-specific T cells, as well as stimulate the 


proliferation of these cells over the last 20 years, have led to mostly no, minimal or 


modest appreciable anticancer immune responses. The majority of these efforts involved 


the use of therapeutic vaccines...[T]he prospects for vaccine-based approaches used 


alone are likely to be limited. 





The authors held out hope for new data, noting that “[a] large, monovalent antigen trial (using 


the C-T antigen MAGE-A3) is currently under way, yet it is not clear that any one candidate will 


necessarily generate robust T cell responses in all patients.” This caution was justified: that 


MAGE-A3 trial, conducted by GlaxoSmithKline, was ultimately ended in 2014 when it became 


clear that the vaccine didn’t outperform placebo on any of three co-primary endpoints.   





The failure of vaccines has extended to prostate cancer just as it has to other cancer types. A 


2014 review entitled “Inefficacy of Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines and Proposed Improvements: 


Casus of Prostate Cancer” explained that, in the aggregate, “therapeutic vaccines trigger 


anticancer immune response” (although Prostvac is an outlier in that regard) yet “therapeutic 


vaccination yields no clinically relevant anticancer effect” (21). Below we reproduce the authors’ 


summary of the therapeutic results from a host of different prostate-cancer vaccines targeting a 


number of different antigens; in short, there were almost no objective responses, consistent with 


the results in other cancers.

Source: Jacobs 2014 (21) 





Against this highly consistent backdrop of failure, the inefficacy of Prostvac makes perfect 


sense; after all, the treatment dates back to at least 1995 and in no way improves on the highly 


similar failed approaches reviewed above. It was part of the same wave of (in retrospect) 


unjustified enthusiasm that Rosenberg et al. were sharply and publicly criticizing by 2004. 


Indeed, Therion Biologics, the company driven into bankruptcy by the failure of Prostvac and its 


sister therapy Panvac, initially planned to treat a wide range of cancers. In 1998 it announced a 


partnership with the large vaccine-maker Pasteur Mérieux Connaught (now part of Sanofi) “to 


develop and market vaccines for colorectal [and] lung cancers and melanoma”; Therion also 


worked on a prophylactic HIV vaccine. None of these lines of research yielded anything 


valuable. Similarly, Bavarian Nordic’s cancer immunotherapy work beginning in the late 1990s 


initially focused on using the MVA vector in vaccines for melanoma and breast cancer; again, 


these efforts never bore fruit. Bavarian Nordic and Therion never had any special insight into 


prostate cancer that would logically allow Prostvac to succeed where so many other vaccines 


failed; to the contrary, prostate cancer was just one of several cancers they hoped to address 


with the same basic, misguided strategy.  





Tolerance and Immunosuppression Impede Vaccine Efficacy 





Why have vaccines failed to live up to ’90s-era expectations? As researchers now understand in 


ever greater detail, the ability of cancer to outmaneuver the immune system is not incidental; 


indeed, “evading immune destruction” is now regarded as an “emerging hallmark of cancer” 


(43). A popular immunology textbook gives a useful basic overview (44):

Immune responses frequently fail to prevent the growth of tumors. There may be 


several reasons that anti-tumor immunity is unable to eradicate transformed cells. First, 


many tumors have specialized mechanisms for evading host immune responses. ... 


Second, tumor cells are derived from host cells and resemble normal cells in many 


respects. Therefore, many tumors tend to be weakly immunogenic. ... Many 


spontaneous tumors induce weak or even undetectable immunity. This may be because 


the tumors that grow have undergone mutations that reduce their ability to stimulate 


strong immune responses. ... Third, the rapid growth and spread of a tumor may 


overwhelm the capacity of the immune system to effectively control the tumor, which 


requires that all the malignant cells be eliminated. 





In the case of Prostvac, tolerance to PSA is likely a major hurdle. The immune system has 


several mechanisms to prevent potentially dangerous self-reactive T cells from proliferating, 


including central deletion within the thymus and peripheral policing via regulatory T cells (Tregs). 


Furthermore, any surviving PSA-specific T cells presented with PSA by dendritic cells prior to 


vaccination likely received no co-stimulation, potentially putting them into the unresponsive, 


non-functional state of anergy. This tolerizing process, playing out over a period of decades, is 


unlikely to be reversed in a period of weeks by a small injection of PSA-expressing poxvirus. 





Even if Prostvac did elicit a strong response from functional T cells – which the data do not 


suggest it does – it would have to contend with the formidable challenges of the 


immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The diagram below, taken from a review of the 


“mechanisms of T cell dysfunction” in chronic infections and cancer summarizes some of the 


key barriers to successful T-cell responses, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Tregs, 


inhibitory cytokines like interleukin-10 and TGF-β, unusual physiological conditions like hypoxia 


and low pH, and immunosuppressive signaling pathways involving inhibitory receptors like PD-


1, TIM-3, CTLA-4, and LAG-3 (45). Furthermore, recent research suggests that at least some of 


these immunosuppressive mechanisms are themselves driven by the influx of T cells into the 


tumor as part of a self-regulatory negative feedback loop (24). Prostvac has no means of 


overcoming all of these problems, which have bested far more robust therapies, including far 


more immunogenic vaccines. In the words of the title of one 2005 paper by Rosenberg et al., 


“Tumor progression can occur despite the induction of very high levels of self/tumor antigen-


specific CD8+ T cells in patients with melanoma” (46). Prostvac does not even induce high 


levels of antigen-specific T cells, so its ability to positively impact tumor progression is even 


more dubious.

Even if Prostvac were to trigger PSA-targeted tumor-cell killing, it would likely still fail to have a 


major clinical benefit. Such killing would in effect be “artificial selection” for tumor cells 


expressing little or no PSA, as well as tumor cells downregulating the MHC class I molecules 


that serve to present intracellular antigens to T cells. For Prostvac, this “antigen drift” – i.e. 


tumor evolution toward reduced presentation of specific antigens targeted by T cells, enabling 


malignant cells to “hide” from the immune system – would be an especially attractive 


evolutionary strategy since PSA, the antigen in question, is not functionally important to tumor 


growth; indeed, some evidence suggests that PSA expression is lower in more aggressive 


tumors compared to less aggressive ones (70). However, since Prostvac has no impact on 


circulating PSA levels, it appears that the treatment never gets to the point of causing the death 


of enough PSA-expressing tumor cells to promote the outgrowth of non-PSA-expressing 


mutants, so this potential barrier to Prostvac’s efficacy is likely purely hypothetical. The 


treatment is so weak that it fails at a much earlier stage. 





Checkpoint Inhibitors Will Not Be Prostvac’s Salvation 





Perhaps tacitly recognizing the inefficacy of Prostvac as a standalone agent, Bavarian Nordic 


and its supporters talk up the potential of pairing Prostvac with checkpoint inhibitors like 


ipilimumab. While the metaphor of checkpoint inhibitors “taking your foot off the brake” and 


vaccines like Prostvac “putting your foot on the gas” is intuitively appealing, an accumulating 


body of evidence strongly suggests that these approaches have no real synergies. (Recall the 


ipilimumab melanoma trial, in which ipilimumab coupled with a peptide vaccine performed
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 37 





identically to ipilimumab alone.) Indeed, as already discussed, the survival data from the 


Prostvac/ipilimumab Phase I study show no clear benefit. 





Why don’t checkpoint inhibitors gain strength from simple vaccines? The reason appears to be 


that the T-cell responses unleashed by these drugs target unusual “neoantigens” – proteins 


expressed by tumor cells but not by normal cells, resulting from mutations within the tumor that 


are often unique to individual patients; they do not target antigens like PSA, which may be 


specific to a certain cell type but are normal, non-mutated proteins to which the immune system 


has built up a strong tolerance. Indeed, patients whose tumors bear higher mutational loads 


tend to respond better to checkpoint inhibitors than those with less mutated tumors, and 


researchers have developed advanced techniques for predicting the mutant proteins mostly 


likely to trigger robust T-cell responses (47) (48) (49) (50) (51). A therapeutic vaccine based on 


particular patient-specific neoantigens (ideally multiple in order to make it more difficult for the 


tumor to “escape” by evolving lower expression or presentation of a single targeted antigen) 


could perhaps work well with checkpoint inhibitors; future research will shed light on this 


possibility. But given the increasingly clear-cut evidence that checkpoint inhibitors achieve their 


effects by easing the restraints on T cells targeting unique, mutated neoantigens – not normal, 


non-mutated antigens like PSA, viewed by the immune system as “self” and protected from 


attack by multiple tolerance mechanisms – there is no reason to expect that a first-generation 


vaccine like Prostvac will add value to the likes of Yervoy or Keytruda. Putting your foot on the 


gas in a parked car doesn’t get you anywhere. 





Vector Immunodominance Likely Contributes to Prostvac’s Weak Immunogenicity 





As previously noted, while tolerance and various forms of immunosuppression would badly blunt 


the impact of even a more successful version of Prostvac, Prostvac actually induces a 


detectable T-cell response in only about half of patients. And when a response is induced, it’s, 


charitably speaking, modest. We suspect that one reason for this feeble and inconsistent 


response is immunodominance, a phenomenon in which the immune system selectively focuses 


its anti-pathogen efforts on a very narrow subset of possible antigens (and possible epitopes of 


those antigens). When Prostvac’s recombinant poxviruses infect patients’ antigen-presenting 


cells, those cells will process and display many different viral antigens, not just the PSA that the 


vaccine is intended to elicit a response to. The immune system may likely end up targeting 


vaccinia or fowlpox components to the exclusion or near exclusion of PSA. 





Since available data on Prostvac don’t compare responses to PSA with responses to the viral 


vectors themselves, we don’t know to what degree vector immunodominance affects vaccine 


efficacy in this instance. But the literature furnishes a number of informative precedents. In one 


study using a mouse model, researchers modified the vaccinia virus to express a particular 


foreign gene, then quantified the immune responses to the virus relative to the protein encoded 


by the inserted gene. As the authors wrote, “The total number of CD8 T cells responding to [the 


foreign protein] were approximately 20- to 30-fold lower than the number responding to the 


[vaccinia virus] vector. … These data bring to light the impressive magnitude of the specific

immune response elicited by the [recombinant vaccinia] backbone compared to that directed 


against the inserted gene” (Harrington, 2002). A human study using modified vaccinia Ankara 


(MVA), a weakened form of vaccinia, came to a similar conclusion, finding that “the vaccine-


driven CTL [cytotoxic T lymphocyte] hierarchy is dominated by poxviral-specific responses” – 


that is, responses to the poxvirus vector, not to the products of the inserted foreign gene that the 


vaccine was intended to mobilize the immune system against. “Ultimately,” conclude the 


researchers, “the efficiency with which vaccinia and other large viruses (such as adenoviruses) 


generate CTL responses” – i.e. responses to the viruses themselves – “may limit their success 


as backbone delivery vectors in recombinant vaccine strategies” (Smith, 2005). Summarizing 


these and other results, a 2014 paper explains (Bell, 2014): 





Live virus vaccines have proven to be effective for driving CD8 + T-cell responses for 


therapy to treat a variety of diseases, making them appealing as vectors for antigen-


specific immunotherapy. One of the major limitations to their efficacy, however, is the 


induction of immunity to vector antigens rather than recombinant target antigens. 


Competition between embedded and endogenous virus antigens limits the effectiveness 


of the vaccine response, decreasing their potential as antigen-specific therapy. 





For many patients, therefore, Prostvac likely functions more as an accidental smallpox vaccine 


than a prostate-cancer vaccine, inducing immunity to endogenous vaccinia and fowlpox 


antigens, not PSA. It has no way of circumventing the challenge of immunodominance. 





Age Degrades the Capabilities of the Immune System 





The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment poses a major challenge to any therapeutic 


cancer vaccine, while immunodominance affects those that employ viral vectors. But prostate 


cancer is a disease of older men (the average age at diagnosis is 66), which brings an 


additional problem to bear: immunosenescence. Simply put, the elderly tend to have less 


functional immune systems than the young. In particular, as one review notes, “In the older 


adult, the benefits of vaccination to prevent infectious diseases are limited, because of the 


adaptive immune system’s inability to generate protective immunity” (28). Aging is associated 


with a higher threshold for T-cell responsiveness, greater expression of inhibitory T-cell 


receptors, lower expression of co-stimulatory molecules, and reduced antigen presentation and 


T-cell proliferation; as one consequence, according to another review, “Even in years in which 


the influenza vaccine is well matched and efficacious in young people, efficacy in the elderly can 


be <20%” (54). Meanwhile, key populations of regulatory T cells, which suppress immune 


responses to their specific antigen targets, accumulate with age (55). 





Given all the deficits of immune-system functionality that build up with age, a therapeutic cancer 


vaccine aimed at older men automatically faces an unusually slim chance of success. Such 


vaccines already struggle to induce clinically beneficial T-cell responses; more Tregs, stronger 


negative feedback loops, and reduced proliferative capacity can’t help.

Prostvac’s Numerous Flaws Easily Explain Its Weak Clinical Results 





In multiple ways, Prostvac is a profoundly suboptimal candidate for a therapeutic cancer 


vaccine: 


 It targets a normal, non-mutated “self” antigen, continuously secreted into the circulation 


for decades of patients’ lives, and thus can’t have an impact unless it breaks pre-existing 


tolerance; 


 It uses large, complex viruses as vectors, raising the likelihood that the immune 


response elicited focuses on components of the viruses and largely ignores the inserted 


antigen; and 


 It aims to treat older men, whose immune systems tend to be compromised in ways that 


specifically reduce the probability of a meaningful T-cell response to a “self” antigen 


(likely subject to protection from regulatory T cells). 





Given the abysmal track record of therapeutic cancer vaccines that didn’t suffer from all of these 


disadvantages, it should be no surprise whatsoever that the available data on Prostvac, when 


interpreted rationally rather than optimistically, indicate no clinical benefit. While Bristol-Myers 


Squibb’s apparent support for Prostvac may seem to validate its approach, this would hardly be 


the first time in recent history that a large pharmaceutical company failed to beat the odds in the 


field of cancer vaccines. As an April 2015 review on “T cell exclusion, immune privilege, and the 


tumor microenvironment” gently points out, GlaxoSmithKline should have known better than to 


expect success from its lung-cancer vaccine program (56): 





Unambiguous evidence for the inability in humans of a systemic immune response to 


eliminate immunogenic cancer cells was provided by Boon’s studies [published in 


1991]…of the antigens that elicit specific CD8+ T cell responses in melanoma patients. 


Cloned CD8+ T cells from a melanoma patient were used to identify the antigen 


expressed by that patient’s cancer: MAGE-A1. The explicit demonstration of the 


coexistence of a progressing melanoma with melanoma-specific T cells in this patient 


implicitly raised the question of why the T cells did not control the growth of the cancer. 


Immunoediting, or the elimination of immunogenic cancer cells, could be excluded, 


which left the possibility of immune suppression by the tumor microenvironment (TME). 


Despite this evidence that the presence of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells alone may not 


be sufficient for the control of cancer, a major pharmaceutical company recently 


conducted phase III trials in patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of the 


clinical efficacy of vaccination with the MAGE-A3 antigen (MAGRIT, NCT00480025). 


The study did not meet its primary end point of extending disease-free survival and was 


discontinued in 2014. 





We expect the same failure and disappointment from Prostvac.

V. Even If Prostvac Succeeds, It Has Limited Commercial 


Potential 





While the scientific evidence and clinical data strongly establish Prostvac’s inefficacy, it’s worth 


noting that the deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb has already removed much of the possible upside 


for Bavarian Nordic even if Prostvac were to succeed. The product on the market most similar to 


Prostvac – a therapeutic vaccine targeting a prostate cancer-associated antigen – is Provenge, 


owned by Dendreon prior to its bankruptcy and now owned by Valeant. Since receiving FDA 


approval in 2010, Provenge peaked at $325mm of revenue in 2012 and now generates 


approximately $300mm: 





Provenge Sales, 2010-2015 








Source: company filings, Kerrisdale analysis 





To be sure, Provenge had problems that Prostvac doesn’t share, in particular the need for the 


complex and costly leukapheresis required to create each “personalized” dose. But Prostvac 


has its own logistical headache: its use of live viral vectors could be difficult to manage at 


oncology clinics treating old and immunosuppressed patients (like those on chemotherapy). 


Furthermore, Provenge’s practical shortcomings are just one factor behind its disappointing 


sales; many doctors also simply doubted whether the concept of a treatment that modestly 


extended overall survival without having any other tangible effect on conventional markers of 


disease really made sense. Prostvac would suffer from the exact same problem. In light of the 


availability of proven, effective oral drugs like Zytiga and Xtandi, which both prolong survival and 


clearly impact disease progression, Prostvac has little appeal. Thus, while a single dose of 


Prostvac would certainly be cheaper than one of Provenge, Prostvac’s revenue in the aggregate 


should at best be similar to Provenge’s.  





Under the Bristol-Myers deal, however, Bavarian Nordic will only receive “double-digit” 


percentage royalties on future Prostvac sales, typically estimated at 15-25%. The deal also 


includes a complex set of contingent milestone payments, with a headline maximum value of 


$975mm. However, the likely payout even if Prostvac succeeds is far lower, as the company 


and sell-side analysts acknowledge. The $975mm figure includes $60 upfront, $80mm upon 


Bristol-Myers’ exercise of its licensing option, $50mm for positive Phase III data, an additional 


variable payment based on the Phase III survival results ($180mm if they replicate the Phase II 


8.5-month median-OS difference), up to $110mm based on regulatory approvals across multiple 


jurisdictions, and up to $495mm in sales-based milestones based on a series of revenue

targets. But even most Prostvac believers don’t expect Phase III results as (superficially) good 


as the Phase II results, so the actual data-driven payment would be less than $180mm. 


Similarly, while Bavarian Nordic hasn’t disclosed what is required to achieve the maximum 


$495mm sales-based milestone payment, similar licensing deals reserve these maximum 


payments for blockbuster outcomes that, again, even company supporters don’t expect. 


Approval-driven milestones may also fall short of the maximum depending on the pace at which 


foreign regulators move and the possibility that a full payout would require label expansion 


beyond mCRPC. 





As a result, and in line with standard sell-side estimates, we assume realistic milestone totals of 


$400 to $500mm conditional on Prostvac success. In total, using generous price-to-peak-sales 


multiples of 5-7x, we find that the value of Prostvac even if it succeeds cannot justify Bavarian 


Nordic’s current market cap, much less offer meaningful upside:

From Bristol-Myers’s perspective, the company is paying $60mm upfront; if Prostvac succeeds, 


it will (based on the arithmetic above) acquire an asset worth $1.1 to $3.0B (75%-85% of peak 


sales of $300-500mm capitalized at sales multiples of 5-7x) less $400-500mm of milestone 


payments owed to Bavarian Nordic. For that net value, conditional on success, of $0.7B to 


$2.5B – obviously a wide range – Bristol-Myers has paid just $60mm. This “option premium” in 


effect implies a break-even probability of success of just 2-8%. Applying those same success 


probabilities to Bavarian Nordic would result in expected Prostvac values of at most $110mm – 


a factor of 12 less than the company’s current market cap.

In today’s crowded, highly competitive prostate-cancer market, even a successful version of

situation is even worse: Prostvac is not a mildly effective treatment that will face stiff competition 


but an ineffective treatment that likely won’t make it past Phase III.

VI. Bavarian Nordic’s Core Smallpox-Vaccine Business Is at 


Risk 





Although the exuberance surrounding Bavarian Nordic clearly centers on Prostvac, the 


company’s core business – selling its form of modified vaccinia Ankara as a smallpox vaccine 


for immunocompromised populations to the US’s Strategic National Stockpile – has served as a 


key source of cash and perceived value floor. Today, Bavarian Nordic’s long-term contract with 


the US government has lapsed, but the company recently received a $133mm order that could 


serve as the first step toward a new contract for a freeze-dried (lyophilized) version of the same 


vaccine with an extended shelf life of ~10 or more years, far higher than the ~2-year shelf life of 


the existing ~20-million dose stockpile. This extension in shelf life, though necessary for 


Bavarian Nordic to keep the overseers of the Strategic National Stockpile happy, would 


obviously have a major negative effect on the value of this contract and makes the resulting 


revenue far less “recurring.” Furthermore, while some analysts dream of higher prices and more 


doses under a new contract, a recent Department of Health and Human Services budget 


document indicates that the government is only planning to spend $132mm per year on 3 to 5 


million doses of freeze-dried vaccine going forward, no better than historical levels and 


consistent with the size of the new order, and there is no indication of any interest in a larger 


stockpile. Below we show an illustrative analysis of the vaccine’s overall value based on the 


following simple assumptions: 


 A 20-million dose stockpile maintained via five-year cycles of four million doses per year, 


with the first cycle starting in 2016, then next in 2026, etc., out to 2100;  


 3% annual inflation in the price per dose; 


 A 35% EBIT margin, equal to Bavarian Nordic’s 2014 EBIT margin excluding the drag 


from the money-losing Cancer Immunotherapy segment; 


 A 22% Danish corporate tax rate; and 


 An 8% discount rate. 





Under these assumptions, the value of Imvamune is only $397mm, just 30% of Bavarian 


Nordic’s market cap. Thus, while Imvamune does arguably establish a floor for Bavarian 


Nordic’s value, it is 70% below the current stock price.

Illustrative Analysis of Imvamune (Smallpox Vaccine) Value 








Source: Kerrisdale analysis 





In addition, while Bavarian Nordic appears to be entrenched as an alternative smallpox-vaccine 


provider today, Imvamune is in fact a controversial product in the biosecurity community. In 


2014, two highly respected authorities on smallpox who had served as directors of the World 


Health Organization Global Smallpox Eradication Program wrote critically of the wastefulness 


and riskiness of Imvamune (57) (emphasis added): 





Which vaccines should be available for emergency use? The WHO Scientific Advisory 
Group of Experts (SAGE) met in November 2013 to provide advice to member countries 
as to which smallpox vaccines should be included in a stockpile and how they should be 
used in case of an outbreak. SAGE recommended that the vaccines should be 
lyophilized (to maximize shelf-life of stockpiles), they should be capable of being 
administered by bifurcated needles (to allow reduction of the dose needed for traditional 
scratch vaccination), and they should produce a visible major cutaneous reaction as a 
correlate of protection. Only the 2 licensed vaccines, ACAM2000 and LC16m8, meet 
these stipulations. SAGE recommended that if neither of these vaccines was available, 
countries should use locally produced vaccines like those used during eradication, which 
met WHO standards of potency, purity, and stability. 
 
SAGE observed, in passing, that a recently developed vaccine, Imvamune (known 
as Imvanex in Europe), is not recommended until more information is available 
regarding its efficacy and safety and until it is produced as a lyophilized product. 
 
...[Imvamune] is substantially more expensive and requires the administration of 2 doses 
of vaccine by syringe and needle. Full protection is not obtained until 14 days after the 
second dose. The vaccine is stable for only 2 years at –20°C. More concerning is the 
fact that fewer than 7,000 people have been vaccinated. Reported adverse reactions are 
few, but, even so, incomplete studies indicate possible risks of myocardial effects. There 
is no apparent programmatic use for the vaccine at this time. 


 
The authors conclude that, given the availability of “2 excellent replicating strains of freeze-dried 
vaccine virus that are highly protective, whose shelf life is 10 years or more, and whose cost is

about $3 per dose” – one of which, produced by the Japanese firm Kaketsuken, is a “gentler” 
attenuated version likely suitable for immunocompromised patients (58) – there is no reason to 
fund less proven, more speculative products like Bavarian Nordic’s Imvamune. 


 
Not only is Kaketsuken’s attenuated strain, which is ~10 times cheaper than Bavarian Nordic’s, 
a threat to Imvamune’s long-term role in the Strategic National Stockpile; so too is the MVA 
variant produced by Emergent BioSolutions, a company with strong relationships in biodefense 
and large existing contracts for stockpiled anthrax countermeasures. Earlier in the year, 
Emergent announced an agreement to use its strain of MVA as an experimental boost for 
GlaxoSmithKline’s candidate Ebola vaccine. While Emergent had previously hoped to use MVA 
as a vector for a tuberculosis vaccine (which failed), there is no reason why it can’t respond to 
any future government RFPs for attenuated smallpox vaccines, threatening Bavarian Nordic’s 
franchise. 
 
Finally, based on a recently published paper (whose authors include Bavarian Nordic’s CEO) – 
the same paper used to demonstrate the equivalence of the freeze-dried and liquid formulations 
– the Strategic National Stockpile already possesses far more effective doses than ever 
envisioned, because it turns out that intradermal administration requires at most one-fifth the 
quantity of virus as subcutaneous administration to induce the same immune response (63). 
The paper’s abstract makes the point very clearly: “ID [intradermal] vaccination could be used, 
increasing the number of available doses in the SNS 5-fold (i.e., from 20 million to 100 million 
doses).” The logical conclusion is that, if the government previously believed 20 million “doses” 
were adequate, it can now achieve the same desired population coverage at one-fifth the price. 
It will be difficult for Bavarian Nordic to sustain its revenue in light of this new information; if one 
discovered that one-fifth the usual amount of sunscreen conferred the same degree of 
protection, one would not keep buying the same volume of sunscreen. 
 
Overall, Imvamune has only modest value and faces economic risks from shelf-life extension 
and reduced order sizes and competitive risks from comparable or superior alternative vaccines. 
Bavarian Nordic’s only successful product in its 20-year history is low in innovation, high in cost, 
unknown in efficacy, and unlikely ever to be used in real life.

VII. Conclusion 





Bavarian Nordic’s stock price has appreciated dramatically thanks to widespread excitement 


about cancer immunotherapy compounded by a succession of thrilling headlines following the 


Bristol-Myers Squibb announcement. But Prostvac is a failed, 20-year-old product that has only 


managed to look promising thanks to a misleading statistical fluke in its Phase II data coupled 


with the absence of any meaningful point of reference in its combination trial with ipilimumab. An 


abundance of scientific literature clearly shows that treatments like Prostvac have never worked, 


and Prostvac itself is an unusually ineffective agent even within the profoundly futile category of 


therapeutic cancer vaccines. It will join the likes of GVAX, Stimuvax, and MAGE-A3 in the 


annals of predictable clinical disappointment. Meanwhile, Bavarian Nordic’s smallpox vaccine 


can justify only a small fraction of the company’s current valuation, and BAVA has no track 


record of productive R&D to fall back on. Current shareholders will come to envy Bavarian 


Nordic’s founder and former chairman, who sold out before the current hype had a chance to 


evaporate.
