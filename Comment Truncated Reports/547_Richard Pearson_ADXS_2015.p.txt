Advaxis: Heavily Promoted And Misleading Investors
Jan. 21, 2015 9:30 AM ET165 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Advaxis stock has recently quadrupled from $3 to as high as $13.


Management has a history of promotional and misleading activities, including heavy
use of the Dream Team Group.


Tumor response data for its lead candidate has been mis-presented to overstate
effectiveness.


ADXS-HPV has demonstrated notably inferior survival rates vs. alternatives.


Over 3 million warrant shares are set to hit the market following registration by
Advaxis.


We are just a few weeks into the year, and already shares of Advaxis (NASDAQ:ADXS)
are up by more than 60%. But that's nothing. The shares have fully quadrupled since their
November lows.


Advaxis stock has suddenly become extremely liquid, trading 2-4 million shares per day. It
also has liquid calls and puts.

There are a number of factors driving Advaxis' share price recently. Part of the rise is due
to the rise in other biotechs, such as Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) and Juno
(NASDAQ:JUNO), with Advaxis rising in sympathy.


Kite and Juno were both recent IPOs which have been very well received due to their
apparent prospects in immuno-oncology therapies. Those who promote Advaxis do so by
claiming that tiny Advaxis is also on the way to a multibillion dollar market cap along with
Kite and Juno.


But Advaxis is not Kite, nor is it Juno. The underlying technology is fundamentally
different, although this has clearly been lost on the mostly retail investor base.


Advaxis has been around for 13 years and yet has only completed a single Phase 2 trial.
That trial had to be run in India, in just a single site. Despite the obvious problems with the
Phase 2 study (described below), Advaxis has made the questionable decision to take it
into Phase 3 trials. This "decision" has also served to boost the stock. But in Phase 3,
Advaxis is actually using an entirely different study design - meaning that it cannot even
guess what the results might be. It is pure nonsense.

This is why Advaxis had previously spent much of its life as a 10 cent busted reverse
merger biotech. In 2013, the company did a massive 1:125 reverse split to get the stock
above $3 so that it could list on NASDAQ. However, the stock frequently continued to
languish below $3.00 even after its uplisting. Even after completion of its only Phase 2
study, Advaxis was still sitting at well below $3.00.


It is clear that it is not some major clinical progress that has driven Advaxis to quadruple.
Instead, much of it has been simply heavy promotion. Well designed stock promotions can
easily have an explosive effect on micro caps, causing them to briefly surge by hundreds
of percent before giving up all of their gains. Examples are shown below.


If history is any guide, we will see a sharp decline in Advaxis very quickly, taking the stock
back to around $4-5 where it was in December. This is simply another heavily promoted,
retail driven microcap stock being traded by technical day traders for the moment. Advaxis
is held more than 70% by retail investors such that it is often subject to much wilder
swings on sentiment than stocks which have broad institutional holdings.


Yet despite the obvious problems with Advaxis, it is unlikely to fall to zero any time soon.
There is enough positive sentiment for immuno-oncology stocks that Advaxis will continue
to be able to issue more stock in equity offerings as long as the offering price is low
enough. This is why we will see prices around $4-5 and not prices of $1-2.


The recent registration of over 3 million warrant shares may be the catalyst for the decline
when those shares hit the market. The company raised $17 million in December at $4.25.
But since then the share price has tripled and volume has surged. As a result, I fully
expect the company to undertake an even larger equity offering very quickly. This will
further pressure the share price back down to $4-5. I expect that such an offering
could already be in the works and could come any day now.


Advaxis and its management have a visible history of promotional activities and
misleading investors which should be of concern to those who are buying the stock
at such lofty current levels.


Former Advaxis CEO Thomas Moore was charged by the SEC with misleading and
defrauding investors in his previous company, Biopure. He had the company issue
promotional statements which caused the stock to jump above $7.00 per share. He then
used the spike in price and volume to raise $35 million in an equity offering. As the
negative truth eventually filtered out, the stock plunged by 60% - initially. Biopure
eventually filed for bankruptcy without ever receiving FDA approval for its products.

From the SEC complaint:


In 2003, Biopure Corporation ("Biopure"), and its chief executive officer, head of
regulatory affairs and general counsel engaged in a fraudulent scheme to
misrepresent and conceal from investors the truth about its applications for Food
and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval of Hemopure….two days after receiving
the complete response letter from the FDA, Biopure issued a fraudulent and
misleading press release that gave the false impression the company had received
positive news from the FDA. That day, Biopure's stock closed at $7.30 per share,
a 22% increase over its previous day close. For four additional months from August
until December 1 1,2003, Biopure continued to conceal from investors that it had
received a complete response letter from the FDA, continued to make false
statements about its dealings with the FDA and failed to disclose the true scope
and nature of the deficiencies with the BLA identified by the FDA. Indeed, on one
occasion in September 2003, Biopure disclosed in a prospectus filed with the
Commission that the July 30 letter it received was a complete response letter. When
Biopure's stock price dropped on heavy trading, the company told investors that the
reference to the letter as a complete response letter was a "mistake" by a "junior
lawyer at a law firm" retained by the company. The disclosure was quickly "fixed"
with the filing of an amended prospectus that omitted the reference to the letter as a
"complete response letter." As the truth about Biopure's applications for FDA
approval gradually became public, through a series of incomplete disclosures, the
market reacted. As of year-end 2003, Biopure stock was trading below $3.00 per
share.


Moore was replaced as Advaxis' CEO by current CEO Daniel O' Connor in 2013.
However, he did not immediately leave the company. Instead, Moore stayed on as a
"consultant." With O'Connor at the helm as new CEO and Moore as its consultant,
Advaxis began making use of stock promotion firm "the Dream Team Group."


For those who are not familiar with the Dream Team, it is a stock promotion firm that was
responsible for publishing hundreds of articles on a wide variety of investment sites
promoting various biotech stocks using impressive sounding authors. However, all of the
articles were bought and paid for by the client companies and the supposed medical
expert "authors" were simply fabricated identities.


Fake posters were also used to infiltrate message boards and social media sites such as
Twitter to create the appearance of broad support for companies.

I first exposed the activities of this group in an article last year entitled "Behind The
Scenes With Dream Team, CytRx And Galena". Following that article, hundreds of their
articles were removed from a wide variety of investment web sites. For those who wish to
understand how powerful stock promotions can fuel stock prices, I strongly recommend
reading that article.


Like Advaxis, shares of heavily promoted biotechs CytRx (NASDAQ:CYTR) and
Galena (GALE) had quickly soared by hundreds of percent. Following my exposé of
the promotion scheme they quickly crashed by 60-80%. I expect that Advaxis will do
the same. The graphs below illustrate what we will see with Advaxis: first the
promoted quadruple, then the rapid implosion as day traders rush to exit.


A screenshot showing the disclosure of payment of $45,000 from Advaxis can be found
here for one campaign.


From a separate campaign (shown below) DTG received $25,000 and 15,000 shares of
stock. The disclosure noted that:


Meanwhile, the Dream Team and its Mission IR subsidiary made Advaxis the focus of a
successful case study on stock promotion for their marketing materials, boasting about:

The most recent spark which lit up the stock was an investment in December by Adage
Capital, upping their stake to over $20 million in Advaxis. Retail investors therefore take
the view that Adage has done deep due diligence and is making a concentrated bet on
Advaxis. The reality is that Adage manages over $25 billion such that this position
represents less than 0.001 of their holdings. The point is that what looks like a large
position to retail investors is actually a miniscule position to Adage. The strategy that firms
like Adage take is to hold numerous highly volatile small cap stocks based on a sector
allocation (such as immuno-oncology) and then buy in at rock bottom prices. Some of
them are bound to be doubles and triples just like Advaxis has already been since Adage
last bought at $4.25.


But the risk / reward proposition is entirely different for retail investors who are chasing it
higher at prices north of $13.00. Investors need to keep in mind that even when the stock
falls to $5.00, Adage will still be making a very attractive return on its overall investment.
The same will not be true for those who are buying at current levels.


Ultimately what matters for Advaxis will be the fundamentals. And with Advaxis, there are
major fundamental problems.

How is Advaxis misleading investors?


The most important point to view with Advaxis comes from their recent corporate
presentation. In it is a slide that highlights "tumor response data" for its ADXS-HPV. The
data has been mis-presented to overstate how effective the drug is in shrinking tumors.


ADXS-HPV is Advaxis' lead compound and is currently being pushed into Phase 3 trials
based on this information. The chart highlights each patient and the height / direction of
the bar on the graph illustrates the tumor response rate.


The overwhelming standard for displaying such information is to display it in percentage
terms so that we can compare the response across tumor sizes between patients. Here
are 3 examples from the New England Journal of Medicine which demonstrate this
standard:


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1314583 (figure 1)


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1302369 (figure 1)


http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1006448 (figure 2)


This is how example #1 looks. Notice it is measured in percentage terms. Notice also the
massive "skew" to the right. This shows that in most cases there is heavy percentage
shrinkage of the tumor. That is what these studies are hoping to achieve.


But what we see with Advaxis is entirely different. In fact, it is almost meaningless.

Advaxis displays their information in millimeters rather than percent. But (more
importantly) they also conveniently cut off the data at minus 100 millimeters. This clearly
gives the impression that the "minus 100's" are all minus 100%, indicating a complete
response. So in other words, they created a chart which is meant to look like the standard
chart, but which overstates their results.


If a 100 mm tumor shrinks by 100 mm, then that is a fantastic result. But if the tumor size
was 1,500 mm then a 100 mm shrink is nearly irrelevant. This is why the data is virtually
meaningless.


Notice also the skew is to the left, meaning that more of the tumors tend to increase in
size rather than decrease.


Once we realize that this data is displayed in millimeters and not in percent, the problem
becomes evident. Many of the patients who would have otherwise been classified as
"partial response" or "complete response" are in fact not categorized with any response at
all. We can see that this is a transparent attempt to massage the data into making ADXS-
HPV look more effective than it really is. (Author's Note: I took a screen shot of Advaxis'

presentation just prior to publication of my article. Since publication of the article it appears
that the company has updated the presentation to reflect tumor shrinkage data in %, not
millimeters.)


Overall, just 6 patients out of 110 generated any response (complete or partial)
whatsoever. That is less than a 6% response rate. Yet based on this, Advaxis has made
the "decision" to go into Phase 3 trials. It is nonsense.


Why does this matter?


In an older copy of their corporate presentation, we can see a page which highlights the
overall survival statistics for ADXS-HPV. This page was then quietly removed from the
presentation, but I made sure to save a copy. The reason Advaxis removed the page
should be obvious when reading below. The newly revised corporate presentation can be
found here.


The problem is that after 12 months we can see a survival rate of just 29-35% in the two
arms of the study. This is less than half of what was reported in a 2014 study using
Avastin (bevacizumab) as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (see Figure
3c below.)

Using some common sense on clinical trials


Many retail investors think that they understand the clinical trial process, but oftentimes
they clearly do not. A great detailed explanation can be found in the report "Why Do So
Many Phase 3 Clinical Trials Fail?"


One thing that retail investors routinely fail to understand is that drugs do not "pass"
Phase 2 trials. Instead, companies gather data and then decide for themselves whether or
not to proceed into Phase 3.


So why do so many expensive phase 3 trials fail ? It is because many companies will
proceed into Phase 3 even when their prospects are marginal because it provides a much
needed boost to the stock price. The companies can then raise enough money that they
can attempt to proceed with other drugs even if the main drug fails in Phase 3. This
happens very commonly in small cap biotech.


Investors need to keep in mind that most clinical trials for new drugs make use of multiple
trial sites in reliable test markets such as the US or Western Europe. But with Advaxis, the
company made use of just a single trial site located in India. It is very often the case that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 12/48


such results cannot be reproduced once actual rigor is added into the equation in a real
Phase 3 trial. Inability to replicate seemingly strong Phase 2 data is why a very large
number of drugs end up handily completing phase 2 trials only to fail phase 3 trials.


Adam Feuerstein of TheStreet.com highlighted several other problems with the Phase 2
trial. The study did not have a true control arm and there was no difference in overall
survival between the two arms of the study.


Feuerstein noted that:


An objective comparison between these two studies doesn't exactly justify the
optimism which Advaxis claims to see in the ADXS-HPV data. If the vaccine were
truly effective, we should be seeing a stronger synergistic effect between ADXS-HPV
and cisplatin. Instead, we see a median overall survival of 8.5 months for ADXS-
HPV plus cisplatin in the Advaxis study compared to 8.9 months for cisplatin
alone in the Moore study. Not exactly confidence inspiring…Unfortunately, I'm
not sure Advaxis' next step with ADXS-HPV will tell us much more about the
vaccine's efficacy. An ongoing, U.S.-based phase II study is set up to enroll only 67
patients with recurrent cervical cancer. The study isn't randomized and has no
control arm.


Complicating matters further, the structure of the Phase 3 trial has been radically changed
from that of the Phase 2 trial.


From the presentation, we can see the following description of the Phase 2 design.
Basically it was a comparison of ADXS-HPV alone vs. ADXS-HPV + Cisplatin.


Yet from a recent press release, Advaxis states:


Under the proposed collaboration, the GOG Foundation and Advaxis will conduct an
adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of concurrent chemotherapy and
radiation therapy (CCRT) compared to CCRT combined with ADXS-HPV in women
diagnosed with high-risk, locally advanced cervical cancer. Prior to commencing this
study, Advaxis will discuss the proposed Phase 3 program with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and will update its investigational new drug (IND)
submission. FDA may request additional information at that time, and Advaxis will
work expeditiously to respond to any such requests.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 13/48


So Advaxis is now comparing ADXS-HPV with chemo and radiotherapy (CCRT) to CCRT
alone. This is entirely different than what was done in the Phase 2 trial in India which
simply compared ADXS-HPV with and without Cisplatin. This means that Advaxis (and
investors) have no idea what results to expect from the new study.


Such an approach is quite literally preposterous. Basically Advaxis is proceeding
into a Phase 3 trial without having even performed a comparable Phase 2 trial first !!


Conclusion


Shares of Advaxis have soared due to excess hype and promotion. But there is a very
clear reason why this stock has spent most of its 13 year life being valued at less than
$100 million in market cap.


The only reason that Advaxis is drawing investors is that the hype surrounding immuno-
oncology is so strong in companies such as Kite and Juno. In order to keep hope alive,
Advaxis is pursuing combo studies with drugs from other pharmas such as Merck and
Medimmune. However these are simply Phase 1/2 studies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2836026-advaxis-heavily-promoted-and-misleading-investors 14/48


With its lead compound ADXS-HPV, we can see that Advaxis appears to be manipulating
information to puff up an otherwise inferior drug. Studies of alternate cervical cancer drugs
have produced far better results as recently as 2014.


The structure of Advaxis' Phase 2 clinical trial in India is highly problematic. This is further
illustrated by the attempt to change the trial design to something new and untested in
Phase 3.


These problems are so absurd that there is clearly no reason for Advaxis' stock to be
surging - aside from heavy promotion and a huge contingent of technical driven retail
traders.


As shown above, management has a history of fraudulent dealings and use of stock
promotion firms including the Dream Team Group.


The run up in the stock from $3 to over $13 is quite clearly artificial and unsustainable and
it will quickly reverse itself. On January 6th, (just as the stock was really starting to run)
Advaxis filed a post effective amendment to its S3 filing allowing for the sale of over 3
million shares underlying previously issued warrants. This represents nearly 15% of
shares outstanding. As these shares begin to hit the market, they will be the catalyst
which breaks the momentum on the stock and sends it back to around $4-5 where it
began. A second catalyst will be a very predictable second equity offering from Advaxis,
taking full advantage of the spike in price and volume.
