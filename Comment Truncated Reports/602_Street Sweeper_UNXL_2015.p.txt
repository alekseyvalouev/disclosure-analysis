Summary


The touchscreen market has shifted, battering huge, established, cost-efficient
companies.


Many smaller competitors have rushed in, and established companies have watched
low gross margins drop even to 8 percent. With the market shift, TPK's stock price
has plunged 65%.


Smartphone opportunities will evade Uni-Pixel, and the company is running out of
other good, viable markets to go after.


The company is overvalued. Competitors enjoying both profitability and scalability
trade at lower enterprise value to sales multiples than Uni-Pixel.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Editor


Many of today's investors, one sage noted, seem to be picking up pennies in front of a
steamroller. Specifically, Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) is gunning its engine, and we think
that big machine is just about to flatten unfortunate investors - again.


The Woodlands, Texas company makes touchscreen film for electronic devices and a
hard-coat protective film for various uses. The stock just recently emerged from a two-
year-long drop from about $40 to the recent ~$6.77.

The initial run-up two years ago escalated on news of a Uni-Pixel/Kodak (NYSE:KODK)
partnership announcement that April, targeting year-end 2013 to begin reeling out rolls of
film to make touchscreens respond to touch. This seemed to validate the technology.
Never mind that Kodak and Kingsbury Corp. released a very similar announcement two
months later about their partnership that, apparently unlike the Uni-Pixel deal, has landed
a sale. And no one knew then that the Uni-Pixel/Kodak roll-out would hit multiple delays
and not happen until … well, everyone's still waiting two years later. Regardless, the stock
lingered in the $30-$40 range.


Later in 2013, the stock began cratering amid a pile of reports suggesting problems,
including excessive promotions, misallocation of capital, repeated delays, heavy
competition, disappointing technology, questionable insiders (see a bull's interesting
response here), along with class-action lawsuits, including one later dismissed and others
settled.


And it was all capped off by the Securities and Exchange Commission issuing subpoenas
on Nov. 19, 2013, in connection with some Uni-Pixel sensor agreements, hurtling the
stock down to around $12 and gradually trailing downward.


But recently, the market has forgotten about Uni-Pixel's problems and its zero revenue in
each quarter of 2014 and its missed earnings. Indeed, investors sent the stock rocketing
to about $6 on hopes the company may be able this quarter to begin commercial
production of a hard-coat resin and a sensor product.


TheStreetSweeper has not yet received a response to requests to Uni-Pixel for an
interview.


Check out other viewpoints here and we'll lay out the top reasons we think it's time to drop
the pennies and run like crazy.


Dangerous, shifting market


Even low-cost companies in Taiwan have found the touchscreen market can range from
brutal to deadly. The market has battered both of Taiwan's biggest and second-biggest
touchscreen companies. Wintek Corp. (OTC:WNTKF), the second-largest touchscreen
manufacturer, had the world on a string just three years ago, according to a number of
articles. Revenue had quadrupled from 2009 to $3.5 billion in 2012, driven primarily by
juicy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) contracts for iPhone 4 and iPad touchscreens.

But Wintek poured $630 million into expanding capacity to address an anticipated market
for larger touchscreens for non-Apple devices - a market that failed to live up to
expectations.


Yet, another blow occurred when Wintek lost 75 percent of its Apple orders, because
Wintek couldn't provide the needed technology for the iPhone 5. Meanwhile, Wintek and
others watched Chinese competitors enter the market, worsening the oversupply of
touchscreens and increasing market concerns about the industry.


Focus Taiwan wrote in October:


"Wintek's financial woes are making many investors nervous that other touch panel
suppliers will encounter similar financial difficulties under the current unfavorable
circumstances."


Wintek fired 14,000 employees, shuttered three plants and filed for bankruptcy protection
in October 2014.


More small competitors, lower margins hurt


Such incidents are common within the industry, experts say.


"It mostly has to do with the growing competition and lower margins," Jerry Chen of
Laibao Hi-Tech told iPhoneinCanada. "Before, there used to be two to three companies
sharing a single order and now there may be as many as 10."


Taiwan's largest touchscreen maker, TPK Holding Co. (OTC:TPKCF), has the benefit of
yield and scale as the market leader. Yet, it has watched its margins fall from about 22
percent in 2009 to just 8 percent gross margin in 2014, even as its working capital
becomes even more negative … dropping last year to minus $665 million US dollars and
operating income sliced to 1 percent of the year before.


Indeed, TPK, has suffered a stock decline of about 65 percent since 2013.

Uni-Pixel itself notes the falling price risk in this market, as shown in this snapshot from its
corporate presentation:

Uni-Pixel's model is inherently less efficient


While touchscreen giants face troubles, too, at least they had an advantage over Uni-Pixel
from the get-go. Those companies' labor costs are much lower, because they have based
production in Taiwan or mainland China, close to panel makers. But consider the case of
Atmel Corp. (NASDAQ:ATML). Like Uni-Pixel, Atmel set up its touchscreen product plant
in the United States.


Atmel launched production of its XSense line in Colorado Springs amid great hopes late in
2013. In February 2015, just 15 months later, it decided to shut down the plant.
Apparently, its metal mesh sensors for 10.1-inch HP tablets were not cost competitive,
according to one expert.


Atmel's chief financial officer said during the recent quarterly earnings call that his
company "recently completed a strategic review and decided to exit this business."


No really viable product markets to chase


Uni-Pixel went after a 7-inch tablet opportunity, failed to get an order and then proceeded
to chase the customer's 10-inch table opportunity, according to CEO Jeff Hawthorne's
response to questions following his Jan. 14, 2015 presentation at the Needham
conference. The referenced comments are in the last couple of minutes of the webcast
here.

"At the time that we decided to develop the 7-inch, there was a pretty reasonable market
for it. What's happened since is that the 7-inch market has really been going into
oversupply, so our customer asked us to focus on 10-inch instead of 7-inch," said Mr.
Hawthorne.


But the tablet market has been losing share to smartphones. Retailers have tried to push
discounted tablets for months and months, locally, offering tablets as cheap as $49.99 in
stores and online. When we checked in stores, shoppers milled around the counters
displaying smartphones, particularly large-display or phablets, but showed little interest in
tablet displays. Worldwide statistics verify that preference.


Global tablet shipments are on the way down and have already dropped 30 percent this
quarter, according to Digitimes Research.


Smartphone market opportunities will evade Uni-Pixel


When Henry Ford created his daring and dastardly horseless carriage, the buggy-whip
makers must have been shaking in their boots. Consumers climbed into Ford's (NYSE:F)
machines and, no matter how beautifully polished the horse-drawn carriages, no matter
how exquisitely groomed and shod the horses, new technology sent even the best of
buggy whips to the wood pile.


Likewise, we've seen the recently reversed fortunes of touchscreen makers Wintek and
TPK. Like Uni-Pixel, those companies' business plans revolved around transparent rolls of
film that were laminated on top of touchscreens. Using a touch sensor from the vendor,
plus an LCD from another vendor, the manufacturer would put the two layers of film
together.


Recent iPhone screens are different. Apple eliminated the double thickness of film to
make the phones thinner. Now, rather than encased inside a touch sensor, the sensing
element goes inside the liquid crystal display or "cell." The technology is called in-cell.


The Galaxy S screens use a similar technology. But the on-cell approach involves multiple
layers: top and bottom glasses, electrodes, liquid crystal display or LCD layer and a color
filter. Like in-cell, it's all part of the panel assembly.


Though embedded sensors were initially only for smartphones, they have now reached
the 10-inch size, according to Seeking Alpha author Richard X Roe, who goes by a
pseudonym and is short the stock.

"And they (embedded sensors) are effectively free - or very close to free," he told
TheStreetSweeper. "They are embedded in the display by the display manufacturer with
only one or two extra steps."


So, manufacturers have discovered they can cut costs using in-cell or on-cell, as they
bypass Uni-Pixel and other sensor vendors.


"That's a dramatic shift in technology that hurts their business," an analyst told
TheStreetSweeper.


Suddenly, like the buggy-whip maker of yesteryear, the sensor maker - no matter how
good, no matter how competitively priced - gets sent to the wood shed. And a smartphone
opportunity isn't even a topic of discussion for Uni-Pixel, according to Mr. Hawthorne's
comments during his Needham conference presentation. (Listen to the webcast here).


"We are addressing tablets, notebooks, 2-in-ones and all-in ones," said Mr. Hawthorne.
"We are not addressing the cell phone market."


Unprofitable Uni-Pixel looks overvalued compared to profitable peers


Company EV/Sales ('16) Est. 2015 Rev. Est. 2016 Rev.


Uni-Pixel 1.17 x $10.95 m $52.75 m


TPK 0.58 x $4.89 b $5.44 b


O-film Tech 0.94 x $4.19 b $5.21 b


(Source: Bloomberg)


Established touch sensor companies TPK and Shenzhen O-film Tech trade at low
enterprise value to sales multiples, as indicated in the chart above. They are both
profitable and have significant scale.


But look at Uni-Pixel. Lacking both profit and scale, the company is currently valued as if
full-scale production in 2016 were a certainty. Those Wall Street expectations look ripe for
revision. Uni-Pixel sales are expected to go from zero in 2014 to $11 million in 2015, then
take a nearly 5-fold leap to $53 million in 2016, then $105 million in 2017. So the valuation
and consensus forecast for Uni-Pixel seem completely out of synch.

Meanwhile, O-film, unfortunately for Uni-Pixel, is making quite a name for itself, as
indicated by this snippet from material comparing sensor suppliers and various
alternatives to indium tin oxide such as Uni-Pixel's arena - metal mesh. This is from a
tutorial presented by Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) senior touch technologist Geoff Walker:


O-film is the "800-pound gorilla" of metal mesh!


Bull thesis


Bulls assert that quality issues and delays are expected to be resolved, leading to some
commercial roll-out in coming months, including the Kodak deal that is two years behind
the target date. They presume Uni-Pixel film is cheaper and better than indium tin oxide,
so it will find uses.


Though recognizing that scaling issues may raise their ugly heads, bulls believe the hard-
coat protective film and sensor product will produce meaningful revenue and some sales
will begin in 2015. Though the CEO recently said he thinks there's enough cash for capital
expenditures in 2015, some bulls admit that, if Uni-Pixel does finally produce a
commercial product, it may need an equity raise.


In fact, company filings state:


"…our long-term viability is dependent upon our ability to successfully operate our
business, develop our manufacturing process, sign licensing, development and
distribution agreements, develop our products and raise additional capital through
offerings of our debt or equity securities to meet our business objectives."


Conclusion


Ah, if only Uni-Pixel's products and opportunities could be half as exciting as the piles of
teeth-gnashing and cheer-leading articles written about the company.


But, unfortunately, while Uni-Pixel was trying to pull itself together, a once-welcoming
market was growing rough and tumble, piling up injured competitors who'd been furiously
scraping up slim margins and even slimmer operating income. And if Uni-Pixel gets past
production issues plus that SEC investigation and actually begins commercialization, it will
still have undifferentiated, non-price-competitive products, we believe. In fact, we agree
with analysts who say it will likely need a potentially dilutive equity raise to even achieve
commercialization.
