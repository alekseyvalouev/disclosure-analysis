Financials at WRLD are worse than they appear


>>> Return to Part I


Americans know that they have a responsibility to live within their means and pay
what they owe. But they also have a right to not get ripped off by the sudden rate
hikes, unfair penalties, and hidden fees. President Barack Obama (May 10, 2009)


While President Obama was referring specifically to
usurious credit card practices, those are tame and civil
compared to how World Acceptance (NASDAQ:WRLD)
does business. Citron believes in the New America, it is
only time before either legislatures, the courts, or its own
debt/receivables collapse the “shady” business of World
Acceptance. This report clarifies the pivotal difference
that makes World’s business model much vulnerable
than the payday lending industry.


In this report, Citron will first expose an accounting artifice used by World Acceptance
and then will address the judicial risk the company and its shareholders bear. Citron still
believes that the headwinds this company faces are too great, and will eventually force
exposure of the farce that its book of receivables and business model really is.

Citron wishes to draw particular attention to World’s reliance upon the arcane “Rule of
78s” in its revenue stream. To our knowledge, it is the only publicly traded company
whose main revenue stream is derived directly from the rule of 78s. Simply put, the rule
of 78s allows the lender to frontload all of the interest in the beginning of the loan. And
for customers of WRLD and investors who want to understand the income statement, it
is a lesson in subterfuge, because WRLD’s loans so rarely go to maturity.  


This method is well known to be grossly unfair to borrowers, however — so much so
that it is illegal in at least 16 states, and illegal for longer term loans in many others.


Note these effects of the Rule of 78s, both of which are central to WRLD’s business:


“1. The higher the interest rate, the greater the penalty amount to the borrower.” 
“2. The earlier the prepayment in relation to the term, the greater the penalty amount
for the borrower.”


Note how the Rule of 78s works hand in glove to extort money from borrowers caught in
serial loan flipping schemes exemplified by WRLD. These consumers are always paying
the first and second month payments of a new amortization schedule - which have the
highest front-loaded interest - compared to amortization schedules calculated
actuarially. The company thereby continues to collect a higher effective interest rate than
it discloses to its borrowers.


But much of this money is not real; it just accumulates as a near half-billion
receivable of dubious collectability on its books.


WRLD’s $460.4 million net loan book is the least collectible, lowest quality asset of any
public company we know. It is our opinion that the book is worth not even 10 cents on
the dollar if put into runoff, while new legislative initiatives and judicial challenges bring
that risk much closer to reality.


When a borrower fails to make scheduled loan payments to a normal bank, the bank is
required by regulations to categorize the loan as impaired. With World, it just gets
flipped to a new loan with a higher principal. According to the company’s own
disclosures, the average loan has been flipped 4 to 5 times. Presumptively, the main
reason for flipping a loan is the borrower couldn’t pay it off.

Consider as an example a recent lawsuit in Texas by Mrs. Subrina Parker. This case
was brought after fell behind on her payments and was harassed by WRLD employees.
She was paying $50 a month on a $250 loan, on terms which the suit alleges violate the
Texas Finance Code. After WRLD called her co- workers, supervisor, and children, the
she filed suit. The suit eventually went to arbitration; it is the company’s main defense
tactic.


Texas and WRLD (.pdf)


A landmark ruling just issued by the New Mexico Supreme Court this month, however,
held that World’s arbitration clause, which is a part of every single one of its loan
documents, is unenforceable due to being “unconscionable” (so one-sidedly unfair that it
isn’t a legal agreement). This opens the door to a borrower’s suit challenging World’s
business practices being granted class action status in the courts.


When the first of these cases is in fact granted class action status, very important
consequences begin to fall on World. For one, every current and recent borrower in the
state receives official notice that a legal challenge is in progress, which will itself impair
their collections. Second, class action status provides substantial economic incentive
which levels the legal playing field. A loss in such a case could impair World’s
operations in at least the state where it is located, and potentially expose it to a large
adverse judgment.


In addition to the suits mentioned above, a newly filed Illinois suit (Dean vs World
Finance) alleges that all of World’s loans violate the Federal Truth in Lending law as well
as Illinois consumer lending laws. Because of the recent New Mexico ruling, there is
greatly increased risk that this suit will be litigated as a Federal class action case.


Dean Complaint Illinois (.pdf)


Finally, World’s litigation risk disclosure states:


From time to time the Company is involved in routine litigation relating to claims
arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The Company
believes that it is not presently a party to any such pending legal proceedings that
would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

World Acceptance vs. Payday Lenders - Apples and Oranges


In light of the claims in the above mentioned lawsuits, Citron believes this language is so
inadequate it is a joke, except as an invitation to a future shareholder class action suit
against management.


Imagine you had a maxed out credit card with Capital One (COF). You notify them that
you cannot not pay your minimum - and the next thing you know, they increase your
limit, give you a cash advance on your new credit to make your minimum payment, and
charge you a fat fee to extend your credit, taking up most of the new higher credit line. Is
this even remotely sustainable business practice in the current economic climate? Is this
a book of receivables that you want to own?


This explains how installment loan borrowers such as John Gilbert in Oklahoma,
Subrina Parker in Texas, Mr. Webb in Illinois and Ms. Cordova in New Mexico wind up
paying “$2,000 just to borrow $250", or “well over 100%” and get trapped in debt by their
installment loans extended by WRLD.


They’re not exceptions, they’re representative examples. Citron is confident that real
court tests of these practices will be ominous for World as they get shut out of the
loophole of arbitration.


After reading part I, some of Citron’s readers confused WRLD with a payday lender. The
business models are very starkly different and when you compare the financials, you will
understand that World Acceptance makes any payday lender look like Goldman Sachs
(GS). For this we take as an example the largest publicly traded payday lender :
Advance America (AEA), and also EZ Corp (EZPW), the largest pawnbroker.

Conclusion


receivables


Citron believes that a half-billion dollar book of unsecured loans, flipped multiple times,
has a huge undisclosed risk of collection. This asset just doesn’t pass the reasonable
man test. While a payday loan is essentially secured by a known upcoming payroll
check expected within the next two weeks, WRLD’s loans are for terms stretching
months, and are secured by nothing


Right out of the Guilty Playbook


Just Tuesday, WRLD filed an 8-K, announcing their plan to increase a current $10
million stock buyback plan (which is currently unexecuted) to $15 million stock buyback
— all of this with only $6.2 million in the bank. (Maybe they can get an installment loan).
Why a stock buyback now? Is it because Citron has exposed the company for what it is
and this is a way to respond? The stock is still currently trading above its 50 day moving
average. What is the urgency to burn its scant cash to buy its own stock? This reminds
us of the last two companies over the past two years who have tried the same tactic in
response to skeptical questions raised by Citron.


Bidz.com - Citron Report- Company announced stock buyback- SEC Investigation,
Stock 80% lower


Arthrocare- Citron Report- Stock Buyback - SEC Investigation, Stock 80% lower


World Acceptance- Citron Report- Stock Buyback - ???


As a business model, WRLD has been the master of loopholes. Loan flipping, tacked-on
renewal fees, single-premium “credit insurance” plus Rule of 78-calculated interest, all
exist only because of loopholes in states’ various usury laws, and specifically the 11
states that haven’t closed them. The financial effect of this crazy business is
unsustainable revenues flowing to current income, while the toxic impairments are
swept into the loan portfolio, where the company can shield the hidden risk to investors
….. for a while.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
Join the next boom » 


In Part 3, Citron will explore how likely government reform of consumer lending could
soon restrict or totally halt the company from indulging in these predatory lending
practices. If WRLD’s operations in even a single state are shut down, it will be forced to
put that state’s portfolio into runoff, exposing its uncollectability. That is why Citron
believes the potential risk of drastically interrupted operations has to be priced into
WRLD’s stock.
