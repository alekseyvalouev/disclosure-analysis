In keeping with the recent trend of picking on good businesses with very ugly valuations,
today we would like to focus on what we consider to be the biggest bubble in the entire
Software as a Service ((SaaS))/Cloud space. For those wondering, we define biggest
bubble by the degree of certainty with which a company will lose over 50% of its current
market value in fewer than 12 months. In this case, we see a less than 5% chance of that
not happening. That makes this a more appealing short than many broken business

models and the traditionally overvalued companies (the list is endless). Like many
companies we have looked at as of late, it is a recent IPO. That means that while many
people may think they understand the business and the stock; they actually do not.
Instead, they tend to toss around buzz-words, and focus on headlines that reaffirm what
appears to be the popular view of the name. This lazy man's approach to analysis is
typical of what happens when a bubble starts to form in a space. As you will see in this
report, the people that are supposed to be providing the objective analysis are in fact back
to their old bubblicious ways of making stuff up to justify the unjustifiable. Of course with
the amount of IPO's these days this is no surprise. The net result of this approach is an
environment where investors simply can't keep up and are in fact being fed blatantly
inaccurate information. This is naturally where we have been finding opportunity.


To provide you with some context for this piece, we will begin by looking at a recent
Forbes article on Veeva (VEEV) Systems. The article is quite short, but at the same time
quite illustrative of just exactly what is going on in markets and specifically in this space
recently. (As far as we're concerned is an ideal way to set the tone for the entire
investment thesis detailed below)


The article opens with this:


"Veeva Systems is at the heart of two explosive megatrends: the cloud
and life sciences. So it should be no surprise that the company had little
trouble with its IPO. In today's trading, the shares are up a sizzling 80%."


This is how momentum buzz-word investing works. Cloud is hot. Life sciences is hot. This
company has exposure to both. So, it is 'sizzling'.


The article continues with this:


"Yet Veeva has done something else that is remarkable: the company is
not only growing quickly but is also profitable. In fact, the company has
generated more operating cash flows - in the past year - then it has
raised in overall funding. But to pull this off, Veeva had to take a unique
approach; that is, the company pioneered something it calls the
"industry cloud." It essentially means having a laser-focus on a massive
industry vertical."

Now pay very close attention to this paragraph, because it is basically what drew us to this
stock. In a nutshell, fast growing successful SaaS companies tend to run significant
operating losses. The initial infrastructure investment, which is the crux of the value
proposition behind moving away from on-premise solutions; combined with the front-
loaded acquisition costs (sales commissions and marketing spend), needed to acquire
and grow a subscription customer base guarantee that a new SaaS entrant should be
losing money in its early high-growth years. Veeva is unique in the space because it is a
profitable SaaS company, but instead of delving into why or how they were able to achieve
this; the takeaway from the article is that Veeva is an even better buy and deserves a
premium to everyone else. (This SA article also reaches the same conclusion.) The other
interesting point to pay attention to here is the creation of a new buzz-phrase that Veeva
supposedly pioneered. We can assure you that Veeva, which was founded in 2007, did
not pioneer being a laser-focused SaaS provider to an industry vertical. (Blackboard
(NASDAQ:BBBB) in Education and Dealertrack (NASDAQ:TRAK) in Automotive are two
that come to mind as well as Medidata (NASDAQ:MDSO) in the life sciences vertical.)
They are however the first to stick the phrase in an S-1 which seems to go a long way
these days.


Anyway, let's move on to another very telling paragraph.


"The CRM offering was a big hit. But for Peter, it was just the start. "We
looked at where we could replace client-server systems and where there
was lots of customer dissatisfaction," he said. "I always like to say:
'Customer dissatisfaction is my opportunity.'"


And Peter found the opportunity in content management. Let's face it, the
life sciences industry involves dealing with huge amounts of documents.
There are also mind-numbing regulations. In other words, it was an ideal
target for the cloud.


But of course, Peter did not stop here either. He then went on to create
Veeva Network, which creates a rich master record of customers."


Ahh, this is an innovative and very diversified product offering company. The interesting
thing here is that CRM is presently 95% of Veeva's subscriber revenues. More on that
later, but for now you should get where we are going with this.

Veeva has done very well for itself over the past five years, but for the most part this
author and most investors in the stock don't realize what they are dealing with. This is a
vertically focused CRM provider that has been basically incubated by Salesforce.com. It is
for all intents and purposes a white-labeled CRM SaaS provider. This is how the company
has grown so quickly and with such capital efficiency. It skipped the investment cycle and
outsourced to Salesforce.com in exchange for 20% of its subscription revenue, and at IPO
it has already achieved a very high penetration in its addressable market. Common sense
would dictate that such a model would trade at a steep discount to a horizontal proprietary
SaaS platform, and not at the significant premium this stock commands. Moving forward
there are obviously a lot of question marks regarding how their relationship with
Salesforce.com will evolve (if you were CRM and had incubated Veeva what % of sub
revenues would you demand when it has achieved a commanding market share?), and
what additional product offerings can generate meaningful revenue growth beyond CRM.


Background


Veeva is a cloud-based CRM provider for the life sciences industry. This means their
software utilizes multi-tenant architecture that allows them to provide upgrades to all
customers simultaneously. The main competitors in the space are Oracle-Siebel and a
French company called Cegedim (OTC:CGMJF). Veeva was founded in 2007 by ex-
Salesforce.com early-stage employee Peter Gassner, and ex-Siebel life sciences
employee Matt Wallach. (The firm was largely funded by $3 million in angel money and a
$4 million investment from VC Emergence Capital.) The company was quick to embrace
the iPad as a pharma Salesforce tool, and its flagship product Veeva "Irep" provides
multiple channels. These include both industry closed looped marketing capabilities as
well as traditional CRM functionality through a cloud-based platform. It also has a Veeva
"Vault" offering for enterprise document management, and recently launched a master
data management of customer data solution called "Veeva Network".


Now, before we get into our bear case against the stock, let's just reiterate that what these
guys have accomplished is pure genius. They spotted a gap in the market and found the
fastest, most capital-efficient way to fill that gap. Rest assured there are a lot of people in
the CRM Life Sciences space who are probably kicking themselves for not trying the same
thing, and plenty of VCs wondering how they missed out on 300x+ return over 5 years
(Interesting side note, the original name on the certificate of incorporation for Veeva in
2007 was Rags2Riches Incâ€¦ so mission accomplished and then some). Honestly, how
many people on planet earth will ever turn $7 million into $1.2 billion we think Veeva is
worth? We point this out because there are going to be some people who view this robust

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 5/55


short-thesis as an attack on the company when in reality it is nothing more than a very
systematically driven critique of the wildly mispriced stock of a well-run business. The
recent flood of IPOs, cheap money, irresponsible analysis, press, and buzz-word chasing
investors are where you should be placing the blame for conditions which have allowed
such an investment thesis to exist.


Veeva's relationship with Salesforce.com comes with inherent growth limitations
that are not even being considered let alone discounted by the current stock price.


The strategic move to build their Veeva CRM on top of the Salesforce.com platform
combined with a highly specialized industry focus is what has allowed Veeva to grow as
quickly and profitably as it has. They managed to sidestep the significant capital
requirements and huge sales/marketing investments (by focusing vertically you can
significantly drive down customer acquisition costs) that are typical of a SaaS startup.
That's the good news, which has been covered extensively by the main-stream financial
media. Now for the bad news; this business model approach does not lend itself to an
ultra-high multiple company valuation. Veeva is currently paying Salesforce.com what we
have worked out to be roughly 20% of their subscription revenue. This is a pretty
generous split considering what Salesforce.com has brought to the table in terms of
infrastructure, resources and instant CRM credibility. Yet we're confident Salesforce.com
had no problem with this as they would be driven to acquire as much market share as
possible. However now that Veeva is the market leader in the US CRM life science space,
we fully expect that Salesforce.com will be looking for a more favorable split.


To better comprehend these inherent limitations below is an excerpt from Veeva's S-1:

"Our agreement allows us to provide our customers with rights to the
Salesforce Platform Unlimited Edition for use as combined with the
proprietary aspects of our Veeva CRM solution. Under our agreement,
salesforce.com provides the hosting infrastructure and data center for
portions of the Veeva CRM solution, as well as the system
administration, configuration, reporting and other platform level
functionality. In exchange, we pay salesforce.com a fee. Our current
agreement with salesforce.com expires in September 2015 and is
renewable for five-year periods upon mutual agreement. If either party
elects not to renew, the agreement provides for a five-year wind-down
period in which we would be able to continue providing the Salesforce
Platform as combined with the proprietary aspects of our Veeva CRM
solution to our existing customers but would be limited with respect to
the number of additional subscriptions we could sell to our existing
customers. We believe that we have a mutually beneficial strategic
relationship with salesforce.com."

"Our agreement with salesforce.com also provides that we can use the
Salesforce Platform as combined with our proprietary technology to sell
sales automation solutions only to drug makers in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries, which does not include the medical
devices industry or products for non-drug departments of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Use of the Salesforce
Platform to sell to additional industries would require the consent of
salesforce.com. While our agreement with salesforce.com provides that
salesforce.com will not position, develop, promote, invest in or acquire
applications directly competitive to the Veeva CRM solution for sales
automation that directly target drug makers in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology markets, our remedy for a breach of this commitment by
salesforce.com would be to terminate the agreement, or continue the
agreement but be released from certain minimum payment commitments
to salesforce.com. Our agreement with salesforce.com also does not
restrict a salesforce.com customer's ability (or the ability of
salesforce.com on behalf of a specific salesforce.com customer) to
customize or configure the Salesforce Platform in any way. Our inability
to freely sell our Veeva CRM solution for sales automation outside of
drug makers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may
adversely impact our growth."


Veeva is limited by contract to offering sales automation solutions in the big
pharmaceutical and biotechnology space. That is the price you pay when you bypass
building your own CRM SaaS infrastructure by partnering with the Cloud CRM leader. The
implications of this for any long-term investor and company are significant. For example, if
the lunar orbit valuation was not such a glaring issue, a potential strategic acquirer would
need to overcome the Salesforce.com hurdle in any transaction. This leaves
Salesforce.com as the most likely natural future acquirer of this business. Then you have
to ask yourself what is the 60-70% of subscription revenue that they can't collect as a fee
worth to them knowing Veeva's dependence on their platform? It is nowhere near what the
bulls in this stock will be thinking when they get around to making this argument (after the
first major drop in the share price of course). See, the problem here is that if anyone else
gets strategically interested in this business, Salesforce.com becomes an instant
competitor. They have the scale and infrastructure to make your life hell if you are a niche
focused CRM provider. So, as far as we're concerned Veeva will be sticking to

Salesforce.com, and gradually conditioning the market to expect its down the road growth
prospects to come from outside of the core Sales Force Automation (SFA) CRM space.
No big deal, until you factor in where the stock is presently trading.


We'd also point out that we found the 'coverage' of its model to be misleading as far as it
paying Salesforce for 'infrastructure costs'. This would imply something more along the
lines of an outsourced infrastructure relationship when in fact what we have here is
basically a white-labeled offering. This is why it pays Salesforce a direct percentage of
subscription revenue, and why it is likely going to have no problem paying an even higher
split in 20 months.


Also, if you were wondering how Salesforce views this relationship, just take a look at this
exchange.

Following on that on the Veeva side, if Veeva or somebody like them to
decide they were going to go off the platform, and go onto AWS or
something else. How difficult is that transition? 
 


Parker Harris - Salesforce.com - Co-Founder, EVP


Well for Veeva, it would be very hard. They've deeply embedded in us,
and they use a lot of our core functionality. So it's not like they're using
us for an app server and a language, and structure service kind of layer.
They're using us for our cores here and capabilities, our analytical
capabilities, our APIs, all of that tied together you'd have to replace in
another environment. So if you went to AWS, you could rebuild all that,
but it would take you -- you would have to take all the IP that we've been
building for 14 years, and rebuild, not all of it, obviously, but pieces of it
to complete the Veeva offering."


Total Addressable Market


Veeva's current market capitalization already dwarfs its total addressable market
opportunity reported in the S-1. And this Total Addressable Market (TAM) is flat out
massively overstated and we can prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 9/55


Veeva Share Capital Shares Millions


Shares Outstanding post IPO 124


2012 Plan Options avg strike $3.98 16.5


2007 Plan Options avg strike $.58 8.9


2012 Plan Options avg strike $12.58 0.9


Fully Diluted Share Count 150.3


Using this table you can quickly calculate that Veeva's fully diluted market capitalization is
$6.1 billion (closing price of $40.54). That puts it at almost 1/5th of Salesforce.com, but
more on that later. For now, we want to go back to the S-1 and call your attention to
Veeva's comments regarding their TAM.


From the S-1:


"For the market segments within the life sciences industry that we believe are
relevant to our solutions, based on our internal analysis and industry
experience, we estimate the total addressable market, including the market
segments for sales and marketing automation and related solutions for life
sciences sales representatives, regulated content management solutions for
life sciences companies, customer master solutions for life sciences
companies, and healthcare professional, organization, affiliation and reference
data, to be at least $5 billion."


At least $5 billion for a $6.1 billion market value company? Remember this includes what
they hope to penetrate with 'Veeva Vault' in regulated content management, and 'Veeva
Network' in Master Data Management. This type of disclosure is always a red flag for us
when we are looking at a hot new IPO. Now, to be clear this $5 billion number is VERY
misleading (that's us being polite) for current investors, because with respect to the life
sciences Salesforce automation software that Veeva presently derives 95% of its
subscription revenue from the actual total revenue opportunity is much smaller. Based on
public disclosures from Cegedim and Veeva, IDC and Gartner data, conversations with
ex- life sciences CRM employees as well as life sciences SFA consultants, and general



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393052/000119312513400469/d541293d424b4.htmhttp%3a/www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393052/000095012313004118/filename1.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 10/55


market research; we would estimate the total current life sciences SFA annual revenue pie
at somewhere between $500-$1,000 million. So, either the rest of the revenue opportunity
is $4.0-$4.5 billion, or there has to be some inherent massive expansion of the pie
assumption embedded in this $5 billion number. Well, we didn't have to investigate too
long to understand this gap.


The $5 billion TAM breakdown is provided in detail within the launch report of co-lead
underwriter #1 of the Veeva IPO (We are going to reference this report a few times, but
just to be tactful we will not point out the firm's name here). The number is...


$2 billion CRM +


$2 billion Enterprise Content Management (ECM) +


$1 billion Master Data Management (MDM) Customer Data= $5 billion


So, its core SFA business is a $2 billion TAM. That's 2-4x what the actual total revenue
opportunity our own research indicated currently exists in this space. So this begs the
question of how did it come up with this $2 billion number? On page four of co-lead
underwriter #1's initiation report, there is a nice little table that shows you the CRM TAM
assumptions. They are based on a global pharmaceutical sales rep head count of 450,000
and annual dollar per seat count of $4,500. Multiply those two numbers together and you
get $2 billion. (To be clear, we found this to be quite amusing because we spent a whole
hell of a lot of time trying to get that $500-$1,000 million number).


So, who is right?


Well, you can decide for yourself.


The current market share leader in the life sciences SFA space does an annual audit of
the global pharma sales rep count number. At the end of 2011 that audit had the global
pharma rep count at 413,565 (-1.8% over 2010). That count declined by 2.5% in 2012 to
403,225 reps. (Cegedim 2012 Annual Report pg. 9) To be clear the rep market continues
to shrink globally. This makes us wonder how responsible using 450k as the number in
your calculation is when inside the same report you state that the global rep market is
between 400-450k (some state over 450k without citing to anything). Anyway, no big deal,
we just wanted to show that the audited numbers are readily available and accessible, yet
surprisingly nowhere to be found in 30+ page launch reports on Veeva. Furthermore,
Cegedim tends to break out their CRM market share data in their public filing.


Here is what the breakdown looked like at the end of 2011:



http://hugin.info/141732/R/1599623/504814.pdf

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 11/55


You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out who number two and three are. Now,
in their most recent quarterly disclosure, Cegedim reports its share at 36%. Based on
these disclosures, you can conclude that Cegedim's CRM user count has gone from
slightly over 150k to slightly above 140k today. Now factoring in Veeva's quarterly
subscription revenue numbers we were able to estimate a user count for the quarter
ending April 2013 of 98k. We can confirm through our own due diligence that Veeva's
CEO put this number at 100k in his address at their user summit on May 7th of this year.
(This Philly Tech News article covering the Summit is a nice secondary source that also
supports our finding.) Thus, you can estimate that Veeva's Q2 exit CRM user count was
somewhere between 115-120k users. That would put their global life sciences CRM
market share at the end of Q2 at 30%. So basically Cegedim+Veeva have just below 70%
of the market share in this space.


Here is what the life sciences CRM market share breakdown looks like based on our
extensive research:


Here are our estimates of Veeva's CRM user count:

Now onto the BIG DEAL... (Yes, there is more!)


While we can overcome a 12.5% overstatement of the secularly declining global pharma
rep count, we can't overlook a 300% overstatement of the current revenue per seat
number. Yes, the TAM is calculated using $4,500/seat annual revenue number. This is
remarkable considering the fact that the current CRM subscription cost being charged per
rep works out to $99 a month or roughly $1,188 a year based on our estimated Veeva
user count. As IDC's latest vendor assessment report had Veeva at "more than 115k users
live" (and our math from earlier is within a hair of that), our subscription dollar per seat
estimate is in the right neighborhood. This basically means that the TAM being used is 4x
the actual current annual subscription revenue run rate opportunity of $475 million that
their 'low entry point' pricing strategy implies.


Now, this is right about the point where you get very irritated with the analysis being put
out by the co-lead underwriter, and start to wonder whether the $5bln TAM was actually
their idea. (Note, the original S-1 filed on June 26 does not include this number and
instead simply references broader life sciences IT spend and Cloud Software data. It was
not until a July 23rd SEC letter request raised the matter that a specific TAM was
provided. Thus, this math analysis/math for their TAM was likely done well into the IPO
process.) This view was reinforced for us when we read how the other co-lead underwriter
sized Veeva's market.


From co-lead underwriter #2's report (pg 21):


"Veeva targets the Life Sciences vertical with its products catering to Life Sciences-
specific CRM, content management and master data solution. Life Sciences
software spend is ~8.8% of total software spend. We believe Life Sciences CRM,
content management and MDM spend will have similar shares out of the total spend
on CRM, MDM or content management. We estimate Veeva's TAM to reach $ 8.6
billion by 2020 from ~$5 billion in 2013, an 8% CAGR. We expect the company to
have a 10% penetration in the Life sciences CRM market, 4% penetration in the life
sciences content management market and 12% penetration in the life sciences
MDM market on account of Veeva's leadership position in this vertical. On account of
growing TAM size and increasing penetration, we believe VEEV will achieve revenue
of ~$620 million by 2020, an 18% CAGR. We believe these estimates are quite
conservative."


To be honest we skipped over this the first time, and went straight to their approximate
numbers for CRM life sciences spend.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 13/55


We spent a good deal of time staring at these numbers because we did not understand
how they were growing at 7.7% a year for the past few years. If global reps are shrinking
and the high-priced legacy CRM providers are being displaced by a low-price Veeva
offering, how can the aggregate life sciences CRM spend dollar value be going up? Veeva
taking market share is a given, but to see the CRM life sciences total spend number rising
steadily over the past several years defied all human logic. We know for a fact that
Oracle's Siebel revenues here have steeply declined, we know for a fact that Cegedim's
have come under a little pressure, and we know what Veeva has been generating. Put
these three players' revenue numbers together and you have almost the whole CRM life
sciences market. (It is not rocket science.) Yet, the co-lead underwriters decide to slap an
8.8% number across each horizontal market to get their TAM for each space? This TAM
analysis honestly couldn't have taken more than five minutes and some excel 'drag down
and to the right' skills. We say this with conviction as their 2017 total CRM market size
number of $36.5 billion is based on 39% increase over 2016's $26.3 billion. How does that
happen and do you now understand why we spent so much time staring at these
numbers? Well, in Q2 Gartner revised their CRM 2012-2017 CAGR from 10% to 15%. The
model was adjusted for 2017's approximate $36.5 billion Gartner estimate, but as you can
see the CAGR maintained at 10%. Thus, whoever put this model together was simply too
lazy to go back and make all the requisite revisions to the 2013-2016 numbers. (For what
it's worth we'd also like to point out that this whole Gartner CRM market share/size report
has stirred a good deal of controversy on the web.)


This is a simply priceless quote:


"We believe life sciences CRM, content management and MDM spend will
have similar shares out of the total spend on CRM, content management
or MDM."


Why are 'We' resorting to 'believing' when the actual numbers are out there? We are going
to go off track here a bit to show just why this irritated us so much. When you top-down
size a market for a financial model, the first thing you do is work to proof that number with
a bottom-up sizing. You do this because being slightly off on a small slice of HUGE
number can lead to being WILDLY wrong about the size of a niche vertical. Of course the
problem with bottom-up proofing is that getting the necessary data on so many players
can take a lot of time or in some cases be next to impossible due to lack of access. Thus,
more often than not you just double check against the market share leaders (usually they
are public) to make sure the top-down number is in the ballpark. As we know in life
sciences CRM, 60%+ of the active users belong to two public companies that are largely

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 14/55


life science vertically focused. (Cegedim CRM/Sales & Distribution (SD) division is roughly
50% of total Cegedim group revenue with CRM making up 40% of that division's slice.) A
little due diligence and you have something close to an actual size of the market based on
real values. There is no 'believing' required. We would also add that if you take their
$1.776 billion 2012 actual size of the life sciences CRM market, and check it against
Cegedim's disclosed CRM/SD total revenue and reported market share you get an
approximate match. Meaning they divided EUR 488 million by 37% to get that number!
Had they taken the correct 40% CRM share of the CRM/SD division number they'd have
ended up with a life sciences CRM TAM of $700 million in 2012. That works out to a 65%
overstatement of the annual revenue opportunity in the market from which Veeva
presently derives greater than 95% of their revenue. We'd also like to point out that if you
take the Gartner $396 billion total software spend number and the $28 billion IDC Life
Sciences software spend number cited in the S-1 that you get a 7% LS total software
market share. Now normally a 1.8% difference is no big deal, especially when you are
approximating, but in this particular case that equates to $7.1 billion or 142% of their
disclosed TAM. In fact, the only way you get to an 8.8% share is if you work back off of
Cegedim's CRM/SD total revenue number and apply it to the Gartner total CRM market
estimate. Based on all of this, we can reasonably infer that the incorrect Cegedim
CRM revenue was the MAIN DRIVER behind the entire TAM analysis. (We can only
imagine the potential legal headaches this one little mistake is going to produce when
someone finally loses a lot of money on the stock.)


And to be clear co-lead underwriter #1's report is just as irritating.


From the launch report page 1:


"Veeva's growth to date has largely come from displacement of Siebel
and Cegedim CRM for biotech and pharma sales reps, but we believe
Veeva's penetration of this $2b rev oppy remains single-digits, with room
for growth via both seat adds and add on modules."


Now turn over to page 2:


"Investment thesis: Veeva provides SaaS solutions for the life sciences
industry targeting $5 billion in spend today."


Well, which is it? spend today or a future opportunity?
5/23/2018 Veeva Systems: SaaS's Biggest Bubble And Tech's Best Short - Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 15/55


If it is 'spend today' we know Veeva's penetration as of Q2 financials was at 30%+ in
CRM/SFA; that is clearly verifiable. However, by page 8 of this report this conundrum is
clearly resolved as they use the $5 billion for their 2013 year-end market assumption. (IDC
and Gartner should not be too happy about being lumped in as a source here even if they
only used them to pull the aggregate IT spend number.) Their bull case is based on
doubling this market size by 2028 amongst other things. We'd also like to point out that,
based on one 3rd party consultant we spoke with, when Veeva's current implementations
are completed they could have 35% of all global reps using their SFA product already.
Single digits huh? This is just careless work, and goes to show just how loose things have
become in the IPO underwriting environment. For the record, we don't doubt this number
could increase over time and possibly approach about $2,000 per seat a year (implying a
$800 million TAM size for life sciences SFA today). However, we will point out that such an
assumption doesn't jive with what has worked for Veeva so far.


The bulk of Veeva's success thus far has come from displacing the Siebel Life Sciences
CRM product (this can be reasonably inferred from Cegedim's stable user count
disclosures and North American market revenue disclosures combined with Veeva's S-1
disclosures) that was extremely overpriced and simply technologically outdated. They
have killed it with pharma companies who want a very cheap on-demand CRM product
(when your rep count is shrinking the way it has in this industry, clearly on-demand is
critical for CRM ROI). These guys would have been switching to Salesforce.com or
another horizontal player at the custom enterprise SFA price of $125 per seat per month.
If that was not the case, Cegedim's rep market share would have collapsed by now. Thus,
assuming that these customers are going to allow their costs to double or quadruple is
illogical. The Salesforce.comPro and Microsoft Dynamics offerings are now at $65. There
are life sciences industry cloud startups out there like German based Ysura that are
offering a fully transparent $75 a month. Then there are the ultra cheap CRM companies
like Zoho which are growing like a weed amongst small to medium sized businesses on
the back of commodity CRM pricing (free for first 3 users... $12 for standard... and a
whopping $35 for their enterprise edition.) The trend in pricing here is clear, and the irony
of all of this is that Veeva's 'disruption' is a part of this.


Just look at its white paper financial model from two years ago on why an on-premise life
sciences customer should switch to a SaaS CRM. (click to enlarge)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 16/55


These numbers work out to an average total cost of $146 per seat a month ($1,750 per
annum) over five years. Multiply this by the entire year end 2012 global rep count of 403k
and you get $700 million TAM. Now take Veeva's Q2 revenue and annualize that number
and then divide by 115,000 users. What you get is a spot on match as far as total revenue
per seat. The only difference here is that the subscriber break-out is 20% lower which
would match with the high volume discount under $100 subscription seat pricing strategy
they have used to land the big-pharma top 20.


If Veeva does everything right on its offering by providing ultra-premium options maybe it
can get to an average blend in the $150-$175 a month revenue per seat range, but that
has not been its typical customer. If you take Cegedim's 140,000 CRM users and divide
that into TTM CRM revenue of $240-250 million (40% of CRM/SD division TTM revenue)
you get $150 per CRM user in total revenue a month.


Understanding what is implied here is very important for anyone looking at this stock.
Veeva's on-premise CRM displacement has been driven by annual savings of 40%+ early
on. As competitors have reacted and shifted towards on-demand, the entire average
selling price per seat has been driven down. This means the co-lead underwriters TAM
dollar target of $4,500 would work out to a 60% increase over the legacy on-premise CRM
solution average annual price of $2,840 that they have 'displaced'. Interestingly enough
if you work back from this number you have a life sciences SFA TAM of $1.1 billion
or 45% below what is being suggested.


Does this make sense to anyone?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 17/55


Did the top 20 pharma companies in the world switch to on-demand so that "add-ons"
would take them 60% above what they were paying before for on-premise? We don't think
so!


As we have already pointed out, what we think happened here is that the top down "8.8%"
share of all CRM spend 'believe' number for the CRM life sciences market poisoned every
model. Despite all evidence to the contrary regarding industry dynamics, nobody proofed
this number. Consequently, all the analysis being done by research analysts is in fact an
attempt to validate one unbelievably wrong assumption. (Not that any of this matters
because at $400 a seat you still 50%+ downside in the stock with even generous margin
assumptions and further market share gains in CRM.)


Would it surprise you to hear that when we walked one industry expert through this math
that they replied, "You gotta be s**ting me."


When we asked a CRM life sciences consultant about the possibility of reaching $4,500 a
seat they answered, "That's impossible. And even if it was remotely possible, it
would be impossible because the horizontals would then immediately target the
entire the market."


See that's the thing about focusing on a niche, it's a niche because it doesn't move the
needle for the horizontals. If it did, they would want to come after the whole pie.


Now on to the rest of the TAM.....


We could have, based on our CRM findings, simply assumed this type of 'flawed analysis'
is being employed to get the addressable market sizes for enterprise content management
and MDM customer data. (Just to be thorough we actually checked this data as well.)


Total revenue for the entire ECM market across all verticals in 2012 was $4.7 billion (pg.
27). We spoke to several ECM experts and they pegged the life sciences vertical at 15-
20% of that in this category. That means the whole market is worth between $700
million-$1 billion annually. Isn't this better than taking 8.8% of $30 billion plus in global
content management spend? You mean to tell us that nobody had the time to call two or
three ECM executives in life sciences to make sure this ball-parked out?


Veeva Network is forecast to account for $1 billion of the $5 billion TAM pie. The product
targets the MDM of customer data market. This market generated $527 million in software
license revenue for all existing vendors across all verticals in 2012. Informatica, the life
sciences leader by market share, did a total $70 million in license revenue across all
verticals in this space. Using the same 15-20% vertical share, (it was pegged lower here,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 18/55


but since standardization is en vogue we'll use the higher number) you get what looks like
$75-$100 million annual license revenue opportunity in life sciences. To be generous let's
call it $350 million across the board today since MDM license revenue is pegged at 35%
of total MDM spend. We can also work bottom-up here and take Cegedim's Onekey
database revenue, which we'd consider a better comparable versus a MDM offering from
Informatica at this juncture, of $120 million (20% of CRM/SD division revenue) and their
reported market share of 44% (the company claims to have never lost a OneKey client so
you can infer what peak asp's look like here) to get a $272 million market size to proof this
out.


Add all these numbers up and you will see that the total addressable market for all three
Veeva products is currently somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion. The market cap
of Veeva is now 3x-6x the entire annual revenue opportunity of its industry! That
means at 50% market share annual revenue would be $500-$1,000 million. That would
imply the stock is trading at 6x-12x peak sales of the current pie. (Needless to say that is
plain ridiculous.)


To top this all off we give you this from page 1 of underwriter #1's launch report:


"Our $36 base case assumes that Veeva can grow revenue at 25% CAGR
through FY2028 and capture 4% of all life sciences IT spend."


Now, we will simply say no comment here on using 15 years of 25% CAGR as our 'base
case' for a vertical solution provider relying on the horizontal leader's entire platform
infrastructure. That is not what we want to focus on. The 4% number assumes the life
sciences IT market will grow from $44 billion today to $65 billion by 2028. This caught our
eye because it shows that even the analysts covering this stuff in detail don't understand
the very basic nature of what is going on here as far as displacement and substitution.
The vast majority of that $44 billion number is replaceable hardware and infrastructure
that the SaaS model is completely displacing. Basically, this pie should start to shrink
drastically in dollar value but also improve in margin profile as SaaS continues to grow.
Common sense really, but we would guess that when you are engaged in financial
alchemy those senses are numbed.


If you don't believe us just look at the data on total life sciences software license revenue
in 2012. Total license revenue was $3.2 billion. That's ERP, CRM, Human Resource
Management System (HRMS), and everything else you can think of. That means if you
assume a 40/60 split between license and services you are looking at a total market for
software and services in life sciences that is 'at least' $8 billion. If the market is that size,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 19/55


even if it's double that, the aggregate IT spend number should start to really come down
as the hardware equipment spend is displaced by more cloud hosted services. In a nut
shell, the dollar spend on hardware infrastructure is moving to the datacenter and platform
providers, and at the same time substitution is eliminating another portion of the pie. Isn't
this better than going nuts on an unreasonable top-down if you are targeting a vertical?
Wouldn't you at least agree that proofing here would have at the minimum 'helped'?


In this case even the top-down numbers used to get at this TAM don't require anything
more than a glance to force you to check your own numbers. Gartner's April report for
CRM Software sized the market at $18 billion; $2 billion is 11% of that. If the market is that
big and VEEV/Cegedim are 60-75% of global life sciences CRM users, they should crack
the top ten here. They don't.


(click to enlarge)


If you go to same report from the previous year, you can see Gartner has Cegedim in at
number nine with CRM revenues that comps to a 30-40% share of the disclosed CRM/SD
division number (which we took the time to verify).

What is happening here is low price CRM for call centers and other parts of the less
penetrated CRM market are growing very fast. (We're talking the $20/month solutions.)
So, the 'analysts' get this pie that they keep growing and then go back to the 8.8% life
sciences total software share and apply that on this enlarged pie. It simply doesn't add up
because life sciences CRM is a mature sector with already complete CRM SFA
penetration that is also dealing with very challenging industry dynamics. The global
pharma sales force has been shrinking and thus there are fewer seats to sell into, and the
move to on-demand has pressured overall ASP's. The vertical is without a doubt a major
exception to the rest of the CRM market, and despite ample evidence to warrant closer
investigation; nobody has bothered to take a look.


Anyway, we would like to emphasize that the CRM TAM number is the one you should
focus on here because it is clearly wrong, and also provides ample evidence of faulty logic
regardless of the math involved. Declining global reps combined with a shift to the cloud
CANNOT result in rising SFA life sciences industry revenue. That is impossible regardless
of the 'add on' possibilities you throw out there, and should speak volumes to the relative
level of work done here. The other two Veeva offerings TAM sizes are also likely
overstated, but we will concede that they are at least open to some further degree of
debate. (But at less than $5 million in revenue in 3 years that shouldn't matter much to
anyone valuing the stock today.)


Now that that's behind us. We provide the following exchange between the SEC and
Veeva with respect to TAM and Industry Data.

Does the fact that Veeva initially sought to use the best possible language to shield
it from accountability regarding industry data it used related to sizing its own
market jump out at you now? In fact, its first submission left that number out altogether.
Something that struck us as odd for an 'industry focused' cloud software provider filing to
go public.


Thus, to sum this CRM TAM argument up, by our math, 66% of the life sciences CRM
user market is worth $440 million in revenue ($250 million Cegedim + Veeva's annualized
Q2 CRM revenue which works out to $190 million). Do you 'believe' the remaining 34% is
worth $1.56 billion?


We would argue that based on the questions raised here with respect to SFA life sciences
and on the fact that Veeva's TAM was a material disclosure in their S-1 that ALL sell-side
coverage of Veeva should be suspended immediately pending further review. Investors
deserve a more thorough explanation of how these assumptions with respect to Veeva's
core life sciences CRM market size/dollar penetration can be reconciled with their current
business model and the present state of the entire life sciences CRM industry. If all we
end up accomplishing through this report is forcing a more detailed analysis of the SFA life
sciences market, we know we will have done our job well.


Market Penetration


Veeva's core target SFA market is dominated by large life sciences companies
amongst which they have already achieved significant penetration. Basically, they
have already managed to successfully grab all the low hanging fruit.


According to Veeva's public disclosures, as of August, the company had 170 life sciences
customers, including 33 of the 50 largest global pharmaceutical companies. To put this in
perspective, the top ten customers accounted for 54% of total revenues in 2012 with two

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 24/55


large pharma players each accounting for at least 10% of total revenues. Now, we are not
raising this issue from a customer concentration risk standpoint because frankly that is the
nature of this industry. If you are doing a good job, you should be cleaning house at the
big boys in the way that Veeva has over the past few years. On the contrary, we bring it up
because an industry that is skewed to such large players can make for difficult organic
growth if you have already achieved high penetration amongst them. The residual revenue
opportunities at smaller life sciences companies simply become insufficient as they don't
move the needle anywhere close to what they need to for the current valuation to make
any sense. Furthermore, the competition over remaining large pharma accounts that
Veeva has not acquired should become quite fierce as these revenue opportunities
become increasingly critical to the survival of their competitors. Of course, Veeva is quite
aware of all of this, and has disclosed this as a risk factor.


From the S-1:


"To date, we have derived more than 95% of our subscription services
revenues from our Veeva CRM solution, and our Veeva CRM solution has
achieved substantial penetration within the U.S.-based sales teams of
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If our efforts to further increase
the use and adoption of our Veeva CRM solution do not succeed, the growth
rate of our revenues may decline."


Now, this is where digging around a bit pays off. Two years ago, Oracle was the US leader
in life sciences CRM, and the reported overall global leader in the space. Last year, Veeva
passed them in the US. This year, based on a recent IDC report, they passed both Oracle
and Cegedim worldwide. (The former is true, but we can't confirm the latter even though it
would only bolster our thesis, as our research has Cegedim with a slight lead in rep seats
and with a more sizeable lead in revenue per seat even though Veeva's priced to grab
share approach seems to be the driver of that.)


Here is the market share IDC table from the most recent vendor assessment. (Bubble size
indicates market share.)

As you can see, Veeva has already achieved substantial penetration in its core market.


So, what exactly is substantial penetration?


Well, despite it being the most important metric to break out for a life sciences CRM
company going public, Veeva does not disclose active user count. Open the S-1, click find
'active users', and you get nothing in the 131 page prospectus.


The SEC asked for more information regarding CRM customers, but Veeva did a good job
of cleverly dodging this question.

We reissue comment 15 insofar as you have not quantified the portion of your total revenues


from Veeva CRM, nor have you provided the number of Veeva CRM customers. Please


consider including this information, as well as the corresponding information for Veeva Vault.


"In response to the Staff's comment, the Company has revised its disclosure
on page 6, 14, 45 and 48 of Draft Registration Statement No. 4 relating to the
percentage of subscription services revenues that can be attributed to Veeva
CRM. The Company respectfully submits that it believes that disclosing the
number of Veeva CRM and Veeva Vault customers is not meaningful
disclosure and may be misleading by drawing the attention of investors to a
measure that management does not consider a reliable indicator of the
strength of the Company's business. For example, new sales orders for the
Company's subscription services very often are the result of the deployment of
additional users of its solutions or the deployment of additional solutions by its
existing customers and not necessarily the addition of a new customer. The
Company's sales to its customers are almost always incremental in nature in
that customers frequently purchase a limited number of users or only one of
the Company's solutions and then place new orders for additional users or
solutions in subsequent orders. The Company's revenues may therefore
increase significantly without a corresponding increase in the number of
customers."


Ahh, if only the SEC had worded their question a bit more clearly maybe would have
gotten a decent disclosure on CRM users. After all you've read so far, don't you now think
disclosing the active user count number before the IPO would have seriously helped every
investor better evaluate this company's value? Are you now irritated that it was publicly
disclosed by the CEO one month before they filed their registration statement and that
anyone with Google Search can confirm this on the internet? Should the SEC feel
embarrassed here? Also, the case for keeping such a number private for 'competitive
purposes' kind of falls apart in such a concentrated market share situation. (Clearly the
three main players all know who has the other users...) Anyway, no big deal because as
we have shown there is plenty of data out there that allows us to get at this number.

These are the pharma sales rep counts in the US and top five European countries at the
end of 2012. These numbers speak for themselves. Over the last six years, the rep count
in the US is down 37%. As an investor in Veeva shares, this data should seriously concern
you.


From the S-1:


"Subscription services revenues from North America, as measured by
the location of the end users, made up 63% of subscription services
revenues in the six months ended July 31, 2013, as compared to 77% in
the prior year period."


If 63% of sub revenue is coming from reps located in North America, then our estimated
H1 2013 average rep count of 101k will allow us to calculate penetration. This works out to
63k users in North America. However, let's assume (note this is all we can do because this
critical metric is not disclosed) that this user is probably generating 10% more revenue per
seat than the implied blended global average. Doing that gets you to 57k+ live CRM users
in North America. That would work out to 85%. This is not 'substantial' penetration. It is
outright saturation.


We also think the slowing rate of professional services revenue growth supports the IDC
survey data. As large implementation opportunities dwindle and the partner network
ramps, professional services revenue growth rates should markedly drop. (Note this is a
place where we agree with the street as every model has 2013 professional services
revenue basically flat yr/yr.) At the same time, the overall revenue growth rate in the US
vs. the rest of the world should start to significantly diverge. Both these things are
happening already. Professional services revenue has been flat for the past four quarters,
and the US revenue growth over the past six months is down to 48% versus a total

revenue growth rate of 74%. These are quite impressive numbers, but still largely
immaterial when compared to the current share price and remaining unpenetrated market
opportunity.


Comparables & Valuation


The Valuation case against Veeva based on a direct comparable with French
publicly listed competitor Cegedim or Horizontal CRM leader and partner
Salesforce.com is overwhelming.


Cegedim, Veeva's French listed industry focused competitor, has a current market value of
EUR 275 million, and a total enterprise value of EUR 775 million. In 2012, they generated
EUR 922 million of revenue and EUR 154 million of EBITDA. So, they trade at an
EV/Sales multiples of .8x and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 5x. (Note that the CRM &
Strategic Data division, which competes directly with Veeva , accounted for 53% of total
2012 revenues and 40% of total 2012 EBITDA. So, it's likely implied EV is probably EUR
350-375 million range.) Now there is no doubt that Cegedim has lost some market share
to Veeva. You can see that in CRM/SD division revenue numbers (down 3-5% on avg for
past 2.5 years) and EBIT margins (down 300bps between 2010-2012) both of which have
been steadily declining over the past 2.5 years. Do these minimal market share losses
justify anything close to the size of market value differential?


Veeva trades at 35x ttm EV/Sales and 157x ttm EV/EBITDA. The disparity is ridiculous.
Based on this gap, we would argue that Veeva could afford to pay up to 3x the
implied current value of all of Cegedim, and then simply shut it down. This would be
a better strategic move than actually trying to continue to chip away at their
customer base, and they would get their Onekey master database in the process (as
well as the Healthcare Professionals and Insurance and Services divisions that generate
47% of total revenue and 63% of EBIT).


Note, that co-lead underwriter #1's report does not provide a comparable to Cegedim.
They only mention the name to point out that Veeva has taken CRM/SFA market share
from them. The other co-lead underwriter does thoroughly cover Cegedim's business
(sans valuation comparisons of course), but makes several glaring mistakes.


From co-lead underwriter #2's launch report:
5/23/2018 Veeva Systems: SaaS's Biggest Bubble And Tech's Best Short - Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 29/55


"Cegedim is a Paris based company that has been in the business since
1969. It primarily caters to three sectors - life science, Healthcare
professionals and Healthcare insurance. Cegedim develops and markets
CRM solutions for healthcare and life science companies; it also
produces medical and paramedical management solutions for health
care insurance providers. With subsidiaries in over 80 countries across
the world, Cegedim serves around 550 Life Science companies and over
200k users. 40% of their revenues come from the CRM product, and 10%
of revenues comes from the OneKey database (MDM product)."


This description is flat out wrong. Cegedim has three divisions. The one that competes
with Veeva is the CRM & Strategic Data division. This division is roughly 50% of group
revenue. In this division, the CRM product currently accounts for roughly 40% of revenue
(putting CRM at roughly 20% of Cegedim total revenue). The other 60% largely comes
from the Compliance product, Market Research product and the Onekey database
offering. Furthermore, the 200,000 users which are cited in the report (and likely played
into their overstated current global rep count assumption) as a CRM user count number is
actually a total touch number. This means they have roughly 60k users just using Onekey
that do not use the CRM product.


To prove the mistake again, one paragraph down on the same page:


As you can clearly see they are labeling all CRM/SD group revenue as CRM revenue.
(We'd also like to add that they drastically overstated Cegedim's Q2 drop in 'CRM'
revenue as the timing of market research related revenue is what was largely at work

here, and can be heard on the conference call discussion and re-confirmed by Cegedim's
prelim Q3 revenue numbers..further evidence of the caliber of analysis performed here.)


This is a bit shocking when you consider the company is listed and according to some
surveys still has the most active users at 150,000 (Frost & Sullivan Report...though our
research indicates that the actual count now is closer to the 140k we used earlier) and a
claimed market share lead at 37% (pg 18). The CRM/SD division of Cegedim is effectively
what Veeva (we can nickname it Dendrite 2.0) wants to morph into: a mutli-solution
providing technology company with $600-700 million per annum in revenue that is focused
on the life sciences industry. The problem is that this business is currently getting an
implied enterprise valuation of $400-$450 million and if we adjust proportionally for EBIT
probably being valued at a lot less by the market; you can't ignore the magnitude of that
gap.


Does that make any sense?


At trailing twelve month CRM revenue of roughly $240 million with 140k+ current users
(We can also tell you based on conversations with some investors long Veeva who have
taken the time to look at Cegedim that they are comparing Veeva and CRM annual
revenue per seat by using all of Cegedim's CRM/SD ttm revenue of $625 million and a
user count closer to 100k based on IDC bubble sizing or 200k based on failure to back-out
Onekey which are both very wrong... but we've dealt with that already), Cegedim's 36%
life sciences SFA market share is basically being given away by the market. By our
estimate, the same piece of pie in Veeva's hands is worth 35x more. Now you know why
Cegedim doesn't make it into any launch report comparable tables even though its
reported revenues were used to determine Veeva's entire TAM.


The bottom line is anyone holding Veeva shares or even looking at them should be
leveraging up like mad to acquire all the Cegedim stock and paper they can get their
hands on. The way we see it, in this dodo market, all Cegedim needs to do is spin off
CRM/SD as a life sciences 'industry cloud' pure play and their stock price should
quadruple.


This is Aol/Time Warner type stuff going on here folks. The comparisons don't get much
better when you look at the horizontal CRM peers.


Here is what Veeva looks like when it is compared to CRM subscription revenue king
Salesforce.com (CRM).

Key Metrics Veeva Salesforce.com


TTM Revenue $168 million $3.47 billion


TTM Subscription Revenue $106 million $3.27 billion


Enterprise Value $5.8 billion $34.8 billion


EV/Rev 35x 10x


EV/Sub Rev 55x 11x


This valuation gap can only be explained by one word.


BUBBLE!


And here is what they look like when compared to the whole SaaS space on EV/2015E
SALES basis.


A company like Veeva should be trading at a discount to Salesforce.com's and other
leading cloud horizontal players multiples and not at a crazy premium. Also, consider that
when you back out Salesforce.com's 20% cut of subscription revenue that you are really
paying 68x ttm sub revenue for Veeva versus the same 11x (10.6x to 10.77x is the actual
adjusted Salesforce.com multiple). We'd argue that based on everything we have shown
so far a 'fair' growth story valuation of Veeva at this point would entail slapping a 1x
multiple on trailing professional services revenue, and a 10x multiple on subscription
revenue. This works out to a $1.1 billion enterprise value. That's the max we would be

willing to pay to acquire the business today. When we account for the fact that the
business is presently trading at 5.3x that number, you can appreciate why we titled this
article the way we did. Even if you wanted to get really generous and pay 20x current
subscription revenue and 2x professional services revenues; the stock has
approximately 53% downside from recent levels.


Then you have the comparable to Veeva Twitter buddy (these industry cloud companies
love to tweet each other) and partner Medidata. We could do a whole report on this
company, but saying we have been long it before should be sufficient for these purposes
(though definitely nowhere near these levels). If we wanted to sum up our view on the
name, we'd say clinical trial management software is obviously a lot more interesting to us
from a life sciences niche defensibility standpoint than a CRM focused provider in the
space. Anyway, these guys are clearly enjoying the Veeva euphoria too. Just have a look
at their CEO's opening remarks from its most recent quarterly result conference call...


"Thank you, Hulus. And good morning, everyone. Before I get into my
prepared remarks, I'd like to take a minute to congratulate one of our business
partners, Veeva Systems, their CEO Peter Gassner and the entire staff on last
week's successful IPO. The success of Veeva's IPO is a testament to their
strength as a company. It's also great confirmation of the life sciences
opportunity and of the power of the vertical cloud-based business model.
Obviously, we're big fans of that model."- Tarik Sherif, CEO


Yep, we love what Veeva is doing for our share price. Anyway, to sum this comparable up
for you, MDSO generates 70% more life sciences subscription revenue than Veeva and
yet is trading at approximately a $2.8 billion EV. That's a 51% discount to Veeva! Our
conclusion on this disparity is that Medidata needs a better PR team. Maybe if it tweets
Veeva enough, some IB will find an addressable market in which they have no products or
expertise to find future revenue in. You think SaaS clinical management software can be
used by Tesla to make the Model E a few years from now? We would also point out that
all you SaaS life sciences investing junkies should think about something here which
jumped out at us. The vast majority of life sciences companies (count wise) are still in
development stage. In fact, we are in the midst of what two very well respected life
sciences VC's we talked to referred to as a massive biotech IPO bubble. Using basic logic
you can conclude that the one piece of SaaS software these companies need more than
anything else is on-demand clinical trial management software. The one thing they have
zero need for is SFA software as they have no approved drugs to sell. By this logic,
Medidata is far and away the more deserving of a premium multiple industry cloud

company, as their organic growth opportunity is much more believable. At present that
growth rate in revenues was 3% sequentially and 32% year over year. Not as impressive
as Veeva's trailing number, but then again not about to fall off a cliff either because of the
'substantial' penetration into the spend thrift big pharma sales divisions. This is the
GROWTH TRAP that every sucker who has not done adequate due diligence is running
(walking would be putting it too mildly) into.


What about co-lead underwriter #1's financial model?


We can't finish this valuation section without at least commenting on that. Its base-case
scenario has Veeva getting to $3.7 billion in revenue by FY2028. The breakdown is CRM
$1.2 billion (60% of a $2 billion market in 2028 at a zero CAGR on its current size of this
TAM of $2 billion which has clearly been proven as extremely wrong), Vault/MDM $900
million (15% of $6 billion market in 2028 which means it doubles from the $3 billion they
have it at today), Other Life Science $650 million (The pie grows from $39 billion to $65
billion despite the SaaS trend and they get 1% of this), and Other Verticals $945 million
($1 trillion pie becomes $1.8 and they get .06% of it).


Yes, other verticals. Veeva Systems is being sold on the 'rise of the industry cloud' story,
and yet multiple times in several reports we read all we could see is analysts reaching for
the clouds (more like stars) to find non-industry cloud revenue to just get their neutral
rating out the door. $945 million is more than all of the revenue expected from two markets
they have a 'product offering' in, and which is not currently providing a meaningful revenue
contribution. Now as their current business model doesn't allow them to sell their CRM
offerings into any other vertical, we are guessing these guys think investors are buying a
horizontal ECM company (look out EMC and Opentext).


Does the fact that 70% of FY2028 revenue needs to come from places in which they have
virtually no revenue or new offerings yet not concern you? If we gave Veeva CRM a $1
billion market cap, would you really be willing to pay $5 billion today for the revenue Vault
has generated so far and what the just launched Network today might generate? Does it
also not bother you that this is being marketed as an 'industry cloud' life sciences
company and the financial models being put together to justify the share price require
suspending that 'business model' assumption.


What if we told that after all of this the intrinsic value that its DCF produced was $32
($36 a year from now).

Yes, 20% below the current share price after finding 70% of the company's revenue
in markets it has no revenue in today, and with all their completely wrong
assumptions regarding the CRM life sciences TAM.


In fact, we were impressed that they managed to resist the temptation to claim Veeva
might just start developing their drugs and have a blockbuster or two in the works!


The reality suspension going on here is stunning and reminded of Thornton Mellon's first
finance lecture in Back to School.


"What's a widget?"-Mellon


"It's a fictional item, it doesn't matter"-Professor


"Doesn't matter... tell that to the bank"- Mellon


The long investment thesis here is like someone coming to you and asking for a $1 billion
for his Falafel chain because by 2028 it will be the leading Burger joint as well as deriving
25% of sales from a thriving construction business.


Where Could we go Wrong?


"Veeva (an Emergence portfolio company) has mastered this layer-cake
approach, taking a slice of a number of horizontal solutions (i.e. CRM, content
management, marketing automation), and focusing them specifically for the
deep regulatory issues of the life sciences industry. In fact, in just one year,
the company has twice rolled out entirely new functionality that entire
companies were once built upon. Its Veeva Vault content management
solution was quickly followed by its Veeva Network marketing and data
platform-all built from scratch and deployed in the span of just 18 months." -
Gordon Ritter, Vertical is the New Horizontal


We didn't get into a more detailed discussion of enterprise document management and
master data management products in the TAM section because we believe they should be
looked at alone, and wanted to make some comments on the product offering that are
more relevant than the numbers being thrown around. An investor in Veeva today is
buying into their track record in sales force automation CRM, and not into what they hope
to accomplish in ECM and MDM. The ECM market is dominated by some large players
like EMC, Open Text, IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. In the life sciences vertical, the

dominant players are EMC Documentum and Computer Sciences' Documentum based
FirstDoc. Right behind these guys you have the Alfresco open source partners like TSG
group. Also, to be clear, there already is a young 'fast growing disruptive' company in this
space, it is called NextDocs. Their Sharepoint based ECM offering came up in several
conversations with industry professionals as an up and coming life sciences ECM solution
out there.


Furthermore, Cegedim's Onekey database has a commanding market share in the HCP
database offering space. In either of these markets, Veeva's solutions need to be built
from the ground up or acquired as they were with the AdvantageMS database. The
challenges are obviously quite significant, and the path to success very different from the
one taken in SFA. Veeva's SFA product is basically a thin offering built on top of Chatter
and a mobile app. The products fast penetration was largely driven by cost saving. Both
initially by being a pure SaaS offering (no more wasted dollars on rep seats that go
unused... This has definitely been a major issue with the rapidly shrinking rep count) that
allows for optimal pharma rep IT spend, and on an absolute dollar basis by being able to
undercut the competition because of their Salesforce.com relationship. Cost saving on
reps has been a major focus of pharma companies, but in terms of new drug submissions
and compliance related offerings the game is very different. Veeva's approach with Vault
has been to focus on competitors 'feature bloat' and position their offering as simple and
all about easy and quick document location. Is this surprising? If your first hit was a 'thin'
application you dropped on top of Chatter and an iPad application, then our guess is your
view of the world is that complex 'products' that have been built over time are all bloated.
Like we said before, drug approval and development are not exactly an area where going
light is a proper sell. So far what we have heard from consultants and professionals in the
space reflects this. Basically, a 'salesy' product culture doesn't exactly port over into
compliance, regulatory data, and clinical data management. Getting life sciences
companies to just upgrade current systems is hard work (EMC just acquired Sitrof
Technologies, a 50 consultant strong Life Sciences ECM consultant group, to better help it
sell its offering) because generally speaking this is a critical process nobody wants to
mess with. If existing dominant vendors have a hard time selling slight change, you can
imagine the challenges faced by a vendor seeking to get a life sciences company to
switch their entire ECM system. Furthermore, when you are dealing with millions of
documents spanning several years of development, standardization doesn't work. This
process is at the core of what sets the life sciences companies apart from one another,
and thus not suited for a one size fits all product strategy. Does one really need to dig as
deep as we did to understand this? Common sense would dictate that the measuring stick

for an iPad SFA app that a rep needs to be able to use in his 2 minute sit-down with a
Doctor is very different from the tools being used by the Phd's living in a lab developing
the next multi-billion dollar blockbuster drug.


Now go back to the Forbes Article:


"And Peter found the opportunity in content management. Let's face it,
the life sciences industry involves dealing with huge amounts of
documents. There are also mind-numbing regulations. In other words, it
was an ideal target for the cloud."


Does this statement sound as robust now? Do GSK, Pfizer, Roche, and Novartis want
their critical document management applications updated at the same time? Is a multi-
tenant architecture solution ideal for them? Doesn't each one of these companies have
unique (i.e. competitive advantage) ways for dealing with these 'mind-numbing
regulations'? There are plenty of people who say the Vault offering is still a de minimis
portion of Veeva's revenue because clearly the whole product strategy doesn't work for big
pharma. They will however concede that it could take some share amongst smaller life
sciences companies, but then you run into the issue of how the product is priced for that
segment.(it's expensive) Does spending the majority of your annual R&D budget pursuing
such a strategy, and getting this type of return make much sense? These are all questions
that should be asked and can be answered by doing the type of due diligence we have
done on this space.


What about Veeva Network? At a Veeva user conference in May of 2012, Veeva Network
was introduced as a cloud based customer interaction repository (CIR). (You can read
about it here as the PR disappeared from Veeva's website.) The product seemed like an
interesting idea as far as real-time information exchange between the multi-channel
marketing companies and the pharma big boys. That was until Pfizer came out at the
conference and said they have no intention of sharing their customer data with
anyone. What do you do when one of your largest CRM customers comes out and
shoots down your new product strategy at a public user conference? Well, as you
can guess Network disappeared and the project was shutdown. Surprisingly a month
before Veeva announced it was going public Network was re-launched as a MDM of
customer data solution. (This PR can be found on the Veeva website) This was followed
by the AdvantageMS HCP database acquisition two days before the original confidential
S-1 filing. So, is it a coincidence that we didn't hear anything about Network again until the
IPO process got going?

Very doubtful, and to be clear this new version of Network is not some core life sciences
MDM game changer.


Veeva's MDM solution is not 'true' MDM. It's more of a data service that's built specifically
to address GPs, and doesn't cover specialists. It does fine for that specific application
where it supports sales & marketing, but to be clear it doesn't support the broader
enterprise. According to one industry expert we spoke with, any large enterprise looking
for a robust MDM solution wouldn't take Veeva's Network offering seriously. They cited a
top five market cap biotech company, and Veeva SFA customer, which Veeva had been
reportedly lobbying to switch to Network. This biotech company passed on Network
despite it being offered to them for free. The rationale being that they needed something
that covered all the segments they sold into (not just GP's), and that related throughout
the entire enterprise. The expert we spoke with pointed out that Veeva's often cited top 20
pharma win for Network should be taken with a grain of salt. As a rather small competitor
had originally won on the merits of their MDM offering, but that all changed once Veeva
acquired the AdvantageMS physician database that had teamed up with this competitor
on this pharma account. They also mentioned that 2013 was a big patent expiry year for
this particular pharma company, and that there are severe internal budgetary pressures
driving all decisions there. Basically, cost saving rules the day as 'they are not thinking
strategically'. Thus, Veeva's aggressive pricing strategy and desire to show an immediate
big name customer win post-IPO was the driver here. Also, from a technical perspective,
an argument can be made that the Force.com has some inherent scalability issues that
will interfere with a large MDM platform. So, those seeking optimal functionality would
most likely choose to build their MDM externally. Despite this one conversation standing
out, the general theme across several people we spoke to in MDM was that this was a
highly competitive market in which Veeva was far behind and would need to spend heavily
without the ability to rely on major disruptive landscape shifting forces. The logic being that
launching a cloud MDM product in the middle of 2013 is very different from coming into
the CRM market as an on demand player in 2007. The major players have been
responding to the shifting landscape for several years now, and thus much better
positioned as far as the cloud.


Suffice to say after all the research we did on these products and segments we had a hard
time understanding where the co-lead underwriter's "broadly positive" customer feedback
on new offerings characterization came from. Veeva's experience with the Vault offering
thus far says a lot about the inherent limitations of the vertically focused cloud model. We
are approaching the three year anniversary of the Vault unveiling, and the product is still
generating minimal revenue. This is a reminder that unlike a horizontal/scale focused

business model; a vertically focused provider can't just flip a switch to a new revenue
stream. Veeva's amazing success providing a low cost highly functional CRM tool for
sales reps at the world's largest life sciences companies is not translating into the follow
through ECM momentum you would expect at this point. With the recent launch of
Network (which the company supposedly can't even give away to some of its top SFA
customersâ€¦ not that there is anything wrong with that strategy when you just launched a
product... but its just that who pays $1 billion for that today when the other big new product
is 3 years old and still generating de minimis revenue), we are expected to give them the
benefit of the doubt in another segment (we are referring to the real world business here
as the stock market has declared victory in all three product segments as well as other
future unknown segments and even more unknown non-life sciences verticals from day
one). We raise these issues because to some this all looks like IPO window dressing.


To make our point we call your attention back to SEC/Veeva IPO exchange:


Veeva's October 3rd, 2013 SEC Letter Response:


"1. We note that within your common stock valuations, particularly your May 2013 and July 2013


valuations discussed on page 71, you identify the introduction of your Veeva CRM Approved


Email solution as one of the factors that caused the valuation of your common stock to


increase. In light of this solution impacting your common stock valuation, please explain why


revenue recognized from this solution is not similarly identified and quantified as impacting


revenues for the six months ended July 31, 2013.


In response to the Staff's comment, the Company advises the Staff that it did
not recognize revenues from the sale of Veeva CRM Approved Email during
the six months ended July 31, 2013 and therefore did not identify and quantify
revenue from Veeva CRM Approved Email as a factor affecting revenue
growth."


And some more from Veeva on how a product announcement boosts valuation:

5/23/2018 Veeva Systems: SaaS's Biggest Bubble And Tech's Best Short - Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 39/55


"The actual revenues used for the April 30, 2013 and June 30, 2013 valuations
were also not impacted by actual revenues from Veeva CRM Approved Email
[***]. In addition, forecasted revenues used for the April 30, 2013 and June 30,
2013 valuations were not impacted by forecasted revenues for Veeva CRM
Approved Email. Rather, the impact of potential sales of Veeva CRM Approved
Email over the longer term was a subjective factor considered as part of the
April 30, 2013 and June 30, 2013 valuations. The Company believes that while
the introduction of the new solution did not affect the April 30, 2013 and June
30, 2013 interim period results, it believes that it was appropriate to consider
this new product introduction as a factor that contributed to an increase in the
valuation from January 2013 to May 2013."


This exchange is notable with respect to Network because strategic moves made with an
eye towards being able to show an 'addressable' future market for an IPO can become a
headache down the road. Going back to Mr. Ritter's quote, launching two new products in
18 months is not a good thing if you have to abandon one immediately and the other is still
struggling to generate revenue after several years. That's why we prefer this quote from
Intuit founder Scott Cook:


"For everyone one of our failures, we had spreadsheets that looked
awesome."


This is why we believe Veeva's laser focused approach in CRM as well as low-risk leading
platform partner strategy are nowhere to be found in this Network offering.


These views notwithstanding, significant expansion over time into these two related areas
could provide a decent revenue boost. However, by accounting for the diversified nature of
Cegedim's CRM/SD division, (Cegedim claims 44% global market share in HCP master
database) that is currently being valued at 6-7% of Veeva's EV, you must realize that this
is not exactly a 'move the needle' revenue opportunity (or again that you should be buying
Cegedim shares like they are going out of style). This exemplifies the beauty of a
bubble. Even if Veeva achieves very meaningful penetration with their offerings in
all these categories, the stock is still extremely overvalued today. So, this is that very
rare moment where we don't believe you can go wrong being short the stock here.


In fact our expectation is that if Veeva management plays their cards right, they will be all
about inorganic growth from here on out. They will probably boost CLM, acquire related BI
offerings that can be cross-sold as analytical tools for their CRM, and most likely pick-

off/consolidate some of the smaller SFA players out there at some point. This is of course
dependent on their currency remaining obscenely overvalued, but in any event this seems
like the no-brainer roadmap for where future 'growth' will come from.


Veeva Valuation Conundrum (How is it trading here?)


After reading all this, one wonders how the stock is trading where it is trading. This is
where we can share some added market insight. Some very smart investors have gotten
killed shorting certain SaaS stocks in the last year. We'd argue some have not understood
certain models, and others who did just had very bad timing. Either way if the 'smart'
money got killed shorting SaaS companies that are losing money, we can conclude that
when one came along that was profitable they simply determined taking a close look
would be a waste of their time.


YES, THE EXPLANATION IS THAT SIMPLE.


As one very smart investor we know put it, "if I can't make money shorting the one's
with no earnings, why would I even look at the one generating a profit". Yet, had they
really looked they would have found something seen time and time again throughout
history: A vertically focused software company with tremendous success and penetration
in their core market, talking about how they are making progress entering new segments.
They would have remembered how consistently the market valued these companies at
large (we've been long a few in our careers) discounts to horizontals, and how quickly they
moved on from them. It is at this point that they would have ultimately reached the same
conclusions we did here. Namely, that this stock and this business are now so divorced
from each other that there is only one possible future outcome and that is a very steep
decline in the share price.


How to Play This


This is what we would describe as a dream short. All the good news in the world
still equates to 65%-80% downside in the share price. Our fair value is $8 (and in a
sane world we'd say $4...yes an EV $300 million would be what reality would look like) as
we are giving them the benefit of the doubt as far as their growth strategy goes. Our
strategy would be simply short this stock in size and wait for more people to start focusing
on everything we have raised in this piece versus the puff coverage that is out there now.
It is such a good short that you actually want it to stay elevated at these levels or go even
higher so that you can increase exposure. If you are really cautious and worried that this
bubble somehow won't pop, you can always pair it with a Salesforce.com long position or
a ridiculously priced Cegedim to hedge market risk. There is no way Veeva's market

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1873601-veeva-systems-saass-biggest-bubble-and-techs-best-short 41/55


valuation can continue to maintain its relative value versus Salesforce.com,
Medidata or Cegedim without drawing a lot more eyeballs. We are 100% certain of
that, and in the market you can very rarely make such a statement!


But for the more short-term orientedâ€¦


Look at how Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL) (whose scalable model we are a fan of) and
Tableau (NYSE:DATA) have performed on 'huge beat' earnings, and the overall deflating
sentiment that seems to be seeping into SaaS land. Anyone notice that Netsuite and
ServiceNow have done since they beat big? Are you paying attention to Workday shares
as the market notches new high after new high? Did Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and
LinkedIn (LNKD) just quietly drop 18-20%? If there is no shortage of people downgrading
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)... what will the view of Veeva be once its put under the
microscope?


Also consider that despite our criticism of Tableau, we can still not 100% guarantee that
these guys cannot grow their product offering into a mass market like a mini-Excel. They
have built it from the ground up, and it's conceivable (though highly unlikely) that a mega-
cap company might one day be willing to overpay in an Instagram fashion for a company
like this. Workday (NYSE:WDAY) can and is expanding beyond HRMS. Netsuite could
become a bigger and bigger nightmare for SAP. When it comes to Veeva, you can't make
any of these arguments. Complete market domination still provides an excellent
opportunity for anyone shorting the stock from these levels. It doesn't get more perfect
than that. So, yes while we may think Chegg's (NYSE:CHGG) business model doesn't
work or that Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) is nothing but a money pit, neither of those
names is nearly as appealing to short here as the profitable Veeva.


We'd also like to point out that this Veeva deep dive got us thinking about something very
general as far as SaaS. Basically, that all sell-side models are probably running on some
very faulty assumptions with respect to TAM's for these companies. The trend of moving
to the cloud is being driven by 40-60% annual savings in many areas versus legacy on-
premise. There is a substitution effect going on here that is commoditizing software and it
is a function of both higher efficiency thanks to on-demand as well as the cloud enabled
pricing model. Basically, every new SaaS dollar eliminates a few dollars in spend
elsewhere. Yet every SaaS model we have looked at over the past year is dominated by
the largely on-premise software market dollar size and using historical CAGR's going
forward. This makes no sense. In the short term, the whole planet is still thinking the pie
will grow, when in fact there is a deflationary storm building here courtesy of SaaS.

Hardware came first, now it is software's turn. In the very long run this is great for SaaS,
but over the short to immediate term it probably means the market is going to experience
some serious SaaS related indigestion as valuations are reassessed.


But who cares about all this... according to Mad Money this is a buy here...


"Veeva makes software that keeps track of pharmaceutical salespeople's
comings and goings with physicians," Cramer explained. Although the
Mad Money host hates to see anyone lose a job, the software could
become quite popular with drug companies. "Who knows how many
high-priced non-revenue producing positions that can replace?"


Does Cramer even understand this product is a utility for the reps i.e. fewer reps is not the
best thing? And the 'software could become quite popular'? You think he has any idea of
their current rep penetration? Did this blurb just make our entire investment case for us?


How about this Bloomberg interview with Emergence Capital's Gordon Ritter. Just to show
how clueless everyone who thinks this was a 'great IPO' is on Veeva, watch from 1:45 of
the 3 minute interview.


"Am I right to think of this company as essentially a company whose software
manages drug trials and that's it?"-Bloomberg Interviewer


Is there really much more to say? We'd also point out that Mr. Ritter does not bother
shooting him down (can you blame him with all the love they are getting), and instead
focuses on shooting down the 'that's it' part of the question by talking about how they are a
multi-product company. You'd guess saying we have nothing to do with life sciences
development software, (that is our close Twitter buddy Medidata's market) and that we get
95% of our sub revenue from an iPad App for drug reps would have been too much ask.


Anyway, thanks to the mania in this space, there are solid businesses that clearly offer
more downside than broken businesses. Yes, it is the slow knife that cuts the deepest.


P.S. We've spent the better part of the past month researching and developing this thesis.
This write up went through all kinds of revisions as the commitment to providing
something substantive on the name overshadowed our desire to just run with a 'view' that
we figured was right within two days of work. It is not perfect. If we took more time we
could find several more people to talk to and issues to cover, however, at this juncture
we'd welcome other inquiring minds take as close a look at it as we have. To be quite

frank, after four weeks of watching the press coverage this gets on CNBC and reading
what is considered research on the name; we have started to feel that there is some sort
of bizarre Veeva delusional disorder out there. We needed to rid ourselves of this
temporary obsession, and let Mr. Market resolve this as only he can.


On a more positive note, we'd like to thank all the people whose contributions made this
possible. As for those who are not going to be happy with criticism of their work, well, if
you are looking for someone to blame you only need to look in the mirror.


P.P.S. Mr. Bernanke this is what happens when you dope the entire financial system.
Underwriters get careless, investment professionals stop doing analysis and the financial
media reinforces all of this. It's called a BUBBLE. Nice work!
