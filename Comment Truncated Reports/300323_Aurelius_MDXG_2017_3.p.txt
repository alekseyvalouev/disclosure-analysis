October 18, 2017


 


The Honorable Johnny Isakson


131 Russell Senate O�ce Building


Washington DC 20510


 


Dear Senator Isakson,


We are an investment research group that has established a shortshort
position in MiMedx and believe the company is attempting to

conceal its misconduct at the VA.


We are writing you to express our concerns about your role in the
Department of Veterans Affairs O�ce of Inspector General’s (VA
OIG) investigation as it relates to your large donors, MiMedx Group,
and your longtime personal friend, MiMedx CEO Parker “Pete” Petit.


As evidence of MiMedx’s malfeasance has emerged, Mr. Petit has
embarked on a campaign to intimidate whistleblowers and silence
critics.  We fear that he is also attempting to use his purported
political in�uence to interfere in regulatory investigations.


Given your position as Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Veterans Affairs, the con�icts of interest are self-evident. Yet Mr.
Petit has recently told investors that you have become involved with
the VA OIG investigation on behalf of MiMedx.


We believe you should immediately recuse yourself from the VA’s
investigation and cease any efforts to intervene on behalf of Mr.
Petit or MiMedx.


In addition to an ongoing SEC investigation into accounting fraud
allegations, MiMedx has disclosed that it received a subpoena from
the VA OIG pursuant to an investigation that Mr. Petit claims to be
assisting.


Yet MiMedx has admitted that one former employee recently pled
“the �fth amendment rather than answer questions related to dinners
provided to doctors” and that other former employees “provided gifts
and meals to employees of the VA that potentially result in violations
of federal law”.


Whistleblowers �rst emerged in December 2016 alleging that
MiMedx engaged in a fraudulent scheme involving VA hospitals.  Mr.
Petit has told investors that he subsequently met with you and that
you facilitated discussions with the VA OIG on behalf of MiMedx. Mr.
Petit also said that:

With these investigations ongoing, we �nd it troubling that Mr. Petit
has separately bragged to investors about his political clout.


Campaign �nance records show that you have received more than
$47,000 from Mr. Petit, his family, and MiMedx.  Ethics disclosures
show that you previously were a shareholder of Matria, a company
previously led by Mr. Petit that paid $9 million to settle Medicare
fraud allegations. Furthermore, the Atlanta Journal Constitution has
quoted you as stating that:


In addition to obvious con�icts of interest, the Senate Select
Committee on Ethics (which you Chair) dictates that providing
assistance to constituents “may not be made on the basis of
contributions” and there should be “no special treatment”.  Also, “the
committee has recommended that members not intervene if an
executive branch agency is engaged in an ongoing enforcement,
investigative, or other quasi-judicial proceeding”.


We applaud your recent passage of the VA Accountability and
Whistleblower Protection Act and agree with your statement that
“Too often, the VA’s inability to hold bad actors accountable has
undermined its mission to deliver on this promise to our nation’s
veterans”.


But unfortunately, Mr. Petit and MiMedx have chosen to hire a
signi�cant number of employees from Advanced BioHealing (ABH), a
company responsible for a record-breaking $350 million settlement


Now, will an agency like that do the
proper investigation? I would say absolutely,
particularly since a senior senator, who has oversight
over the whole organization, has asked them to. So I
don’t need to say much more than that.

“I’ve known him [Pete Petit] for going on 45 years and
I’ve never known a �ner guy”

for an alleged kickback scheme that defrauded the VA.  Current and
former MiMedx sales employees were alleged in Qui Tam suits to
have engaged in illegal conduct during their time at ABH including
bribing VA doctors to �ush product down toilets, payments in Gold
Kruggerands, and luxurious gifts.


Now that evidence of MiMedx’s malfeasance at the VA has emerged,
Mr. Petit should not be able to use his political in�uence to receive
favorable treatment.


We know you care about Veterans and this is precisely why you
should immediately recuse yourself from the VA’s investigation and
cease any efforts to intervene on behalf of Mr. Petit or MiMedx.


Respectfully,


 


Aurelius Value
