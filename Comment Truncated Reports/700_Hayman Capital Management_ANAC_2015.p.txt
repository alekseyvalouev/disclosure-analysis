1 
 


 Coalition For Affordable Drugs X LLC (“CFAD”) respectfully submits this 


Second Petition for Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) of all claims of U.S. Patent No. 


7,767,657 (“the ‘657 Patent”) (Ex. 1001) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §§ 311-319 and 37 


C.F.R. § 42.100 et seq.   


I. INTRODUCTION 


 The ‘657 Patent claims formulations for treating fungal infections of the 


nails and skin, including onychomycosis, with 1,3-dihydro-5-fluoro-1-hydroxy-


2,1-benzoxaborole, the structure of which is: 


O


B


OH


F  


The claims of the ‘657 Patent are obvious because the claimed compound 


was disclosed in WO 1995/033754 to Austin et al. (“Austin”) as a preferred 


fungicide effective against Candida albicans – which is a fungal pathogen known 


to cause onychomycosis. 


During prosecution of the ‘657 Patent and its parent application, the Patent 


Owner overcame obviousness rejections by arguing that a general interest, non-


scientific internet website called Answers.com taught away from human treatment 


with an industrial fungicide because it stated that some fungicides were harmful to 


humans. The Examiner accepted these arguments and allowed the patents to issue.
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


2 
 


The fallacy of the Patent Owner’s “teaching away” argument is exposed in 


view of how drugs are developed in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug candidates 


are screened through routine efficacy and safety protocols before application to 


humans, thus avoiding the safety fears that the Patent Owner argued to the 


Examiner. Additionally, WO 2003/009689 to Freeman et al. (“Freeman”) 


describes phenyl boronic acid derivatives for treating fungal infections in humans 


and plants, including dermatophytoses or onychomycosis.  


Claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16, and 18-24 of the ‘657 Patent are thus obvious 


because a person of ordinary skill in the art (“POSITA”) would have known that 


the preferred industrial fungicide disclosed in Austin, which was effective against a 


known cause of onychomycosis, would have been an obvious candidate for 


potential therapeutic use in humans in view of Freeman, which discloses topical 


formulations of similar boron-based compounds for treating onychomycosis. 


Claims 3 and 6-9 of ‘657 Patent, claiming certain formulations, are obvious 


over Austin in view of Freeman and one or more of Chaudhuri, Samour, Friedman 


and Atlas, which disclose certain formulations, the preparation of which the ‘657 


Patent admits was well known in the art. 


Lastly, claim 17 is obvious over Austin in view of Freeman and Shapiro, the 


latter disclosing pharmaceuticals to treat onychomycosis and other related diseases.

Petitioner hereby certifies that the ‘657 Patent is available for IPR and that
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


6 
 


neither Petitioner nor any RPI is barred or estopped from requesting IPR of the 


‘657 Patent because: (1) neither Petitioner nor any RPI are the patent owner; (2) 


neither Petitioner nor any RPI has filed a civil action challenging the validity of a 


claim in the ‘657 Patent; (3) neither Petitioner nor any RPI has been served with a 


complaint alleging infringement of the patent; (4) the estoppel provisions of 35 


U.S.C. § 315(e)(1) do not prohibit this IPR; and (5) the patent is not described in 


Section 3(n)(1) of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act and so is available for 


IPR pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 42.102(a)(2). 


B. Identification of Challenge Under 37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b) and 
 Relief Requested 


Petitioner requests the cancellation of claims 1-24 of the ‘657 Patent as 


unpatentable over the prior art for the reasons given herein. 


1. Claims for Which IPR Is Requested Under 37 C.F.R. 
§ 42.104(b)(1) 


Petitioner requests IPR of claims 1-24 of the ‘657 Patent.  


2. Specific Art and Statutory Grounds on Which the Challenge Is 
Based Under 37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2) 


IPR of the ‘657 Patent is requested in view of the following seven 


publications: (1) WO 1995/033754 (“Austin”) (Ex. 1002); (2) WO 2003/009689 


(“Freeman”) (Ex. 1003); (3) U.S. Patent No. 6,143,794 (“Chaudhuri”) (Ex. 1004); 


(4) U.S. Patent No. 6,224,887 (“Samour”) (Ex. 1005); (5) U.S. Patent No. 


7,074,392 (“Friedman”) (Ex. 1006); (6) U.S. Patent No. 5,498,407 (“Atlas”) (Ex.
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


7 
 


1007); and (7) U.S. Patent No. 3,816,472 (“Shapiro”) (Ex. 1008). None of Austin, 


Freeman, Chaudhuri, Samour, Friedman, Atlas or Shapiro was made of record 


during prosecution of the ‘657 Patent. 


a. Qualifying Prior Art Under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) 


The following publications are prior art against the ‘657 Patent under pre-


AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as each published more than one year before February 16, 


2005, the date of the earliest provisional application to which the ‘657 Patent 


claims priority. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 39.) Austin published December 14, 1995; Freeman 


published February 6, 2003; Chaudhuri published November 7, 2000; Samour 


published May 1, 2001; Atlas published March 12, 1996; and Shapiro published 


June 11, 1974. 


b. Qualifying Prior Art Under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) 


Friedman is prior art against the ‘657 Patent under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 


§ 102(e)1 because it was filed on March 27, 2000—almost five years prior to the 


February 16, 2005 presumed priority date of the ‘657 Patent.  


The following combinations of the above-listed publications render claims 


1-24 of the ‘657 Patent obvious under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 103(a): 
                                                 
1 A person shall be entitled to a patent unless “(e) the invention was described in 


. . . (2) a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United 


States before the invention by the application for patent.” 35 U.S.C. § 102(e).

herewith. The grounds for unpatentability are supported by the Declarations of 


Stephen Kahl, Ph.D. (“Kahl Decl.”) (Ex. 1009) and S. Narasimha Murthy, Ph.D. 


(“Murthy Decl.”) (Ex. 1011) filed herewith. 


3. The Construction of the Challenged Claims Under 37 C.F.R. 
§ 42.104(b)(3) 


The terms of the ‘657 Patent claims are given their broadest reasonable 


interpretation in light of the specification, as understood by a POSITA. 37 C.F.R. 


§ 42.100(b). Petitioner submits its claim constructions in Section V.C below. Any 


undiscussed claim terms should be given their “ordinary meaning” under the

“broadest reasonable construction” standard of § 42.100(b). 


4. How the Construed Claims Are Unpatentable Under 37 C.F.R. 
§ 42.104(b)(4) 


Section VI below contains a detailed explanation of how the construed 


claims 1-24 of the ‘657 Patent are unpatentable, including an identification of 


where each element is found in the prior art. 


5. Supporting Evidence Under 37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(5) 


Section VI also cites the exhibits and evidence relied upon to support the 


petition, and addresses the relevance of the specific portions of the evidence to the 


unpatentability arguments. This includes Exhibit 1009, which is a Declaration of 


Stephen Kahl, Ph.D. under 37 C.F.R. § 42.63(a) attesting to, among other issues, 


the safety of boron-based compounds and that it would have been obvious to try 


1,3-dihydro-5-fluoro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole to treat onychomycosis. 


Exhibit 1011 is a Declaration of S. Narasimha Murthy, Ph.D. under 37 C.F.R. 


§ 42.63(a) attesting to, among other issues, the obviousness of claims 1-24, the 


reasons for combining the references, and the reasons to pharmaceutically 


formulate and topically apply the claimed compound. 


V.  SUMMARY OF THE ‘657 PATENT 


A. Lineage of the ‘657 Patent 


The ‘657 Patent issued August 3, 2010, from U.S. Application No. 


11/505,591, filed August 16, 2006, (Ex. 1001), which is a continuation-in-part
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657

(CIP) of U.S. Application No. 11/357,687 (now U.S. Patent No. 7,582,621), (Ex. 


1018), filed February 16, 2006, and claiming priority to U.S. Provisional 


Application Nos. 60/654,060, 60/755,227, and 60/746,361, filed February 16, 2005, 


December 30, 2005 and May 3, 2006, respectively. 2 


B. Description of the Alleged Invention of the ‘657 Patent 


The ‘657 Patent claims topical formulations of a single boron-based 


compound to treat onychomycosis and other related diseases. (Ex. 1001, Title, 


Abstract, cols. 323:1-324:49; Ex. 1009, ¶ 23; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 38, 40-42.) Specifically, 


the ‘657 Patent claims a pharmaceutical formulation of 1,3-dihydro-5-fluoro-l-


hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole, or a salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable 


excipient for topical administration to an animal suffering from an infection by a 


microorganism. (Ex. 1001, col. 323:2-8; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 43-45.) The ‘657 Patent 


admits that formulation of pharmaceutically effective carriers was well known in 


the art. (See Ex. 1001, cols. 11:21-12:10; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 49, 194.) 


C. Construction of Key Terms in the ‘657 Claims 


 Claims 1 and 6-11 of the ‘657 Patent recite the following compound: “1,3-


dihydro-5-fluoro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole.” (Ex. 1001, col. 323:2-8, col. 


323:24-48; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 50, 55-60, 115.) Austin also discloses 5-fluoro-1,3 dihydro-
                                                 
2 The extent to which the claims of the ‘657 Patent, which is a CIP application, are 


supported by the U.S. Provisional Applications has not been considered herein.

1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole, which has the following structure: 


O


B


OH


F  


(Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 24-25; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 42-44, 50, 75, 82-83, 115; see also Ex. 1044, at 


3.) The ‘657 Patent discloses this chemical structure, and its formula of C7H6BFO2 


and molecular weight of 151.93 Daltons. (Ex. 1001, col. 138:10-25; Ex. 1011, ¶ 


115.) A short name for 1,3-dihydro-5-fluoro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole is 5-


fluoro benzoxaborole. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 50.)   


Claims 2 and 3 recite a “lacquer.” (Id. ¶¶ 51-52.) While the ‘657 Patent does 


not define the term “lacquer,” it means a “solution of a solvent and a film-forming 


polymer containing an active ingredient.” (Id. ¶¶ 51-52, 118; see Ex. 1032, at 19.)  


Claim 4 recites the term “emollient,” which means a “material[] used for the 


prevention or relief of dryness, as well as for the protection of the skin, nail, hair, 


claw or hoof.” (Ex. 1001, col. 169:64-66; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 53, 119, 164.)  


Claim 4 recites the term “nail penetration enhancer,” which means “an agent 


that acts to increase the permeability of the skin, nail, hair or hoof to a drug.” (Ex. 


1011, ¶ 120; see id. ¶ 53; Ex. 1001, cols. 11:63-12:10.)
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


12 
 


Claims 6-10 recite the term “about,” which is not defined by the ‘657 Patent. 


(Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 19-20, 121-31.) The term “about” when used with a specified 


parameter “avoids a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter,” but 


suggests a “range [that is] interpreted [based on] its technologic and stylistic 


context.” Pall Corp. v. Micron Separations, Inc., 66 F.3d 1211, 1217 (Fed. Cir. 


1995). When construing “about,” it is appropriate to consider the specification, 


prosecution history, and other claims. See id. It is also appropriate to consider the 


effects of varying the specified parameter and extrinsic evidence of meaning and 


usage in the art. See id.; see also Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1318-19 


(Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc). Case law further provides: (1) “about” does not have a 


universal meaning3 and may be construed differently in different claims4; (2) the 


term “about” may extend the claimed range to include values that serve the 


functional purpose of the limitation5; (3) “about” has been construed to include a 


full range of acceptable values when no importance was attributed to the claimed 


                                                 
3 See Cohesive Techs., Inc. v. Waters Corp., 543 F.3d 1351, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2008). 


4 See Abbott Labs. v. Lupin Ltd., 753 F. Supp. 2d 382, 418 (D. Del. 2010). 


5 Cohesive Techs., 543 F.3d at 1370 (“Absent [specification] guidance, we neither 


can nor should draw a hard and fast numeric line. Rather, we construe ‘about 


[numeric value]’ to accomplish the function of the [limitation] . . . .”).
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657

quantities and the claimed quantities were not added to avoid prior art6; (4) when 


construing “about” it is appropriate to consider acceptable tolerances or quantities 


based on intrinsic or extrinsic evidence7; and (5) in the absence of expert analysis 


of the specification and comparison to other claims, “about” has been construed 


according to its plain and ordinary meaning as “approximately” or “reasonably 


close to.”8 


Here, the ‘657 Patent is silent regarding why the particular claimed 


formulations were chosen, but instead states that the formulations were “well 


known in the art.” (Ex. 1001, col. 188:29-51; see also id. at col. 11:27-35, col. 


163:34-43, col. 173:7-9; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 49, 123, 130, 194, 212, 226, 230, 252, 256.) 


Indeed, the prior art discloses numerous topical formulations for effective 


treatment of onychomycosis that combine different amounts of various excipients 


and active agents. The ‘657 Patent does not attribute any importance or unexpected 


                                                 
6 Schreiber Foods, Inc. v. Saputo Cheese USA, 83 F. Supp. 2d 942, 950 (N.D. Ill. 


2000) (construing “about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes” to include 30 seconds to 


ten minutes, and “about 190 [°] F. to about 205 [°] F.” to include 150° F to 300° F). 


7 Abbott Labs., 753 F. Supp. 2d at 418 (relying on general tolerances of +/-15%). 


8 See Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. v. Abbott Diabetes Care, 667 F. Supp. 2d 


429, 441 (D. Del. 2009).

results to the claimed quantities of excipients or active agents in the formulations, 


nor were the claimed quantities added or limited to avoid prior art. The ‘657 Patent 


identifies the purpose of a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as “any 


formulation or carrier medium that provides the appropriate delivery of an 


effective amount of a[n] active agent[,] . . . does not interfere with the effectiveness 


of the biological activity of the active agent, and . . . is sufficiently non-toxic to the 


host or patient.” (Ex. 1001, col. 11:21-27; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 116, 122, 194, 227.) 


Accordingly, the term “about” when used in conjunction with an excipient or 


active agent should be construed to include a range of acceptable values such that 


the excipient or active agent serves the functional purpose of the limitation, where 


the range of acceptable values is determined based on the specification, 


prosecution history, and prior art. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 121-31.) 


 Claim 6 recites the unit designation “1:10 wt/volume,” which is not defined, 


but means 1 gram solute dissolved in sufficient solvent to form 10 milliliters (mL) 


of a solution (or composition). (Id. ¶¶ 55, 132; see Ex. 1037, at 119.)   


Claim 10 recites the unit designation “% w/v,” which is not defined, but 


means the percent by weight in grams (g) of a solute in 100 milliliters (mL) of a 


solution (or composition). (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 59, 132, 166-69, 189; Ex. 1037, at 119.) 


Claim 12 recites a “cosmetically effective amount,” and claim 24 recites a 


“therapeutically effective amount,” which both mean “an amount of the claimed
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


15 
 


compound needed to reach the desired therapeutic result.” (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 61, 73, 


133, 160, 171, 182; see Ex. 1001, col. 10:4-9.) 


Claims 14-19 recite “fungus,” “yeast,” and/or “dermatophyte,” as well as a 


number of specific genera and/or species of the same. “Fungi” encompasses both 


yeasts and dermatophytes. Dermatophytes refer to the following three genera: 


Microsporum, Epidermophyton, and Trichophyton. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 63-68, 173-77.) 


Onychomycosis that is caused by a dermatophyte, usually Trichophyton rubrum 


and/or Trichophyton mentagrophytes, is referred to as Tinea unguium. (Ex. 1001, 


col. 132:8-11, col. 139:11-23; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 68, 175-77.) Candida albicans is a 


yeast species commonly associated with onychomycosis. (Ex. 1006, col. 1:27-31; 


Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 87-88, 173-78.) 


Claim 20 recites a “cutaneous infection,” which is not defined in the ‘657 


Patent, but means an “infection of the skin.” (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 69, 134, 178.) 


Claim 21 recites an “ungual, periungual and subungual infection,” which is 


an “infection of an animal’s nail, hoof, or claw.” (Id. ¶¶ 70, 135, 179; Ex. 1001, 


col. 1:18-23.) 


Claim 22 recites “onychomycosis,” which is “an infection of the nail often 


caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and non-dermatophyte molds.” (Ex. 1001, col. 


132:2-20, col. 139:11-23; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 45, 71, 180.) 


D. Summary of the Original Prosecution of the ‘657 Patent
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


16 
 


The ‘657 Patent, filed August 16, 2006, is a continuation-in-part of the ‘621 


Patent, filed February 16, 2006. (Ex. 1001; Ex. 1011, ¶ 74; Ex. 1018.) 


1. Prosecution History of the ‘621 Patent 


The ‘621 Patent was filed on February 16, 2006 as U.S. Application No. 


11/357,687. (Ex. 1013; Ex. 1018.) In response to a restriction requirement, 


Applicants elected claims 27-31 and new claims 40-42, and made a species election 


of 1,3-dihydro-5-fluoro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole. (Ex. 1014, at 6-7.)  


In an August 26, 2008 Office Action, all pending claims were rejected based 


on 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶ 1, and 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over U.S. Patent No. 5,880,188 to 


Austin in view of a definition for “fungicide” from Answers.com indicating that 


fungicides can be used for both agriculture and pharmacy. (Ex. 1015, at 4-13; see 


Ex. 1009, ¶ 25; Ex. 1011, ¶ 75.) The Examiner noted that while the “level of skill 


in the art is high,” the claimed subject matter would result in exhaustive search or 


undue experimentation by one of skill in the art. (Ex. 1015, at 7-8, 10-11.)  


In response to the § 112 rejections, Applicants did not dispute that the level 


of skill in the art was high, but amended claim 27 without argument. (Ex. 1016, at 


2.) In response to the obviousness rejections, Applicants argued that Answers.com 


did not provide motivation and, in fact, taught away from using the claimed 


compound to treat human infection by stating that “some fungicides are dangerous 


to human health.” (Id. at 6-7; Ex. 1009, ¶ 26; Ex. 1011, ¶ 76.) The Examiner
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


17 
 


accepted Applicants’ arguments, and a Notice of Allowance issued on April 22, 


2009. (Ex. 1017; see Ex. 1009, ¶ 27; Ex. 1011, ¶ 77.)   


2. Prosecution History of the ‘657 Patent 


The ‘657 Patent was filed on August 16, 2006 as U.S. Application No. 


11/505,591. (Ex. 1001; Ex. 1019.) Upon a restriction requirement, Applicants 


elected claim 121 (and new claims 193-214), and made a species election of 1,3-


dihydro-5-fluoro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole. (Ex. 1020, at 6-7.)  


In a January 27, 2009 Office Action, claim 195 was rejected under 35 U.S.C. 


§ 112, ¶ 1, and all claims were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over U.S. Patent 


No. 5,880,188 to Austin in view of Austin et al. (cited by the Examiner as: 


“CAS:124:234024”). (Ex. 1021, at 4-9; see Ex. 1011, ¶ 78.) 


In response to the § 112 rejections, Applicants admitted that the level of skill 


in the chemical arts is high and argued that: (1) the specification, coupled with the 


knowledge generally known in the art, was sufficient for enablement; and (2) the 


formulations of the invention could be made based on excipients, additives and 


methods known in the art. (Ex. 1022, at 8-9; see Ex. 1011, ¶ 80.) In response to the 


§ 103(a) rejections, Applicants argued that Answers.com “teaches that compounds 


that are useful for killing . . . fungi may also harm animals, and thus teaches away 


from assuming that any fungicide can be used . . . as claimed.” (Ex. 1022, at 10-11; 


see Ex. 1009, ¶ 28; Ex. 1011, ¶ 79.) The Examiner issued a Notice of Allowance
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


18 
 


on August 7, 2009. (Ex. 1023; see Ex. 1009, ¶ 28; Ex. 1011, ¶ 81.) 


E. The State of the Art 


 Fungicides have been simultaneously disclosed for both industrial and human 


pharmaceutical use for more than 50 years. An overview of the state of the art is 


discussed in detail in the Declaration of S. Narasimha Murthy, Ph.D. (“Murthy 


Decl.”) (Ex. 1011). A summary of representative references is as follows:   


▪ Bell (Ex. 1025) (disclosing fungicides for industrial applications and 


clinical applications, including treating infections caused by Trichophyton rubrum 


and Candida albicans, without irritating effects).  


▪ Grier (Ex. 1026) (disclosing heterocyclic compounds for clinical treatment 


of fungal infections, e.g., caused by Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum, 


as well as for industrial applications). 


▪ Wagner (Ex. 1027) (disclosing use of heterocyclic compounds as effective 


fungicidal agents for industrial applications as well as for clinical applications, 


including treating onychomycosis). 


▪ Pfiffner (Ex. 1028) (disclosing morpholine compounds for use as 


fungicides in agricultural and pharmaceutical applications, with effectiveness 


against Candida albicans and trichophytes).  


▪ Arita (Ex. 1029) (disclosing benzylamine derivatives as antimycotic agents 


for safe treatment of human fungal infections, e.g., caused by Candida albicans,
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


19 
 


and as industrial fungicides). 


▪ Shapiro (Ex. 1008) (disclosing antifungal compounds for treatment of 


fungal infections of the skin, hair and nails, e.g., caused by Trichophyton rubrum 


and Trichophyton verrucosum). 


▪ Austin (Ex. 1002) (describing the preferred boron-based compound 5-


fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole as highly effective against 


Candida albicans for use as an industrial fungicide). 


▪ Atlas (Ex. 1007) (disclosing that synthetic hydrogels were useful for 


controlled drug delivery and that poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) was useful in 


a cosmetic nail polish composition). 


▪ Mertin (Ex. 1030) (detailing problems and solutions for treating infections 


of the human nail unit, including that high-swelling polymers were preferred for 


therapeutic nail lacquers). 


▪ Friedman (Ex. 1006) (disclosing a sustained-release nail varnish for 


delivery of antifungal agents to treat fungal infections such as onychomycosis).  


▪ Chaudhuri (Ex. 1004) (disclosing a topical gel capable of delivering an 


antifungal through the nail barrier for treating onychomycosis). 


▪ Groziak (Ex. 1031) (disclosing that boron-based agents were clearly visible 


on the therapeutic horizon and that none had been found to be unusually toxic). 


▪ Samour (Ex. 1005) (disclosing a nail lacquer formulation with improved
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


20 
 


physical properties and diffusion characteristics of active principles for effectively 


treating onychomycosis in humans). 


▪ Murdan (Ex. 1032) (detailing problems and solutions for treating 


infections of the human nail, stating that lower molecular weight drug molecules 


showed improved penetration).  


▪ Brehove (Ex. 1024) (describing boron-based industrial fungicides for 


treating onychomycosis caused by Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum). 


▪ Freeman (Ex. 1003) (describing phenyl boronic acid derivatives for 


treating fungal infections in humans and plants, including onychomycosis). 


By February 16, 2005, the cross-application of fungicides for both industrial 


and pharmaceutical uses had been known for over 50 years, the boron-based 


compound of claims 1-24 had been disclosed as a preferred fungicide for 


suppressing a known cause of onychomycosis, and at least two publications had 


disclosed the treatment of onychomycosis by applying formulations containing 


boron-based compounds to the nail and surrounding skin of humans. 


However, despite the obviousness of claims 1-24 in view of the prior art, the 


Patent Owner continues to benefit from the privileges of a monopoly. The public 


has a significant interest in ensuring monopoly privileges are not granted by an 


invalid patent, particularly where, as here, Kerydin® can cost up to $500.00 per 


month or more per patient. (See Ex. 1048 ($1300 for 10mL); Ex. 1049 ($509.54 for
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


21 
 


a 30-day supply and $1477.81 for a 90-day supply).)  


VI. PETITIONER HAS A REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD OF    
  PREVAILING 


There is a reasonable likelihood that at least one claim of the ‘657 Patent is 


unpatentable. 37 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(4). This section provides detailed descriptions 


and claim charts showing how claims 1-24 of the ‘657 Patent are obvious under 


pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 103(a), including identifications of where each claim element 


is found in the prior art. (Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 17-19; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 17-18, 21-34, 136, 273.) 


Underlying factual determinations in an obviousness analysis include (1) the 


scope and content of the prior art, (2) the level of ordinary skill in the art, (3) the 


differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, and (4) objective 


indicia of non-obviousness, see KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex, Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 406-


07 (2007), which are addressed for each statutory ground of rejection. 


In assessing obviousness, “[o]ne of the ways in which a patent’s subject 


matter can be proved obvious is by noting that there existed at the time of 


invention a known problem for which there was an obvious solution encompassed 


by the patent’s claims.” Id. at 419-20. “[W]hen a patent simply arranges old 


elements with each performing the same function it had been known to perform 


and yields no more than one would expect from such an arrangement, the 


combination is obvious.” Id. at 417. “When there is a design need or market
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


22 
 


pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable 


solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options 


within his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely 


the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.” Id. at 421.   


A. Each Reference Relied on for Grounds 1-6 Is Prior Art 


Each reference applied in Grounds 1-6 is prior art against the ‘657 Patent 


under either pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) or 35 U.S.C. § 102(e). (See Section 


IV.B.2, supra.) None of Austin, Freeman, Chaudhuri, Samour, Friedman, Atlas or 


Shapiro was made of record during prosecution of the ‘657 Patent. 


B. A Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art  


A person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the ‘657 Patent was filed 


would have had an advanced degree (Master’s or Ph.D.) or equivalent experience 


in chemistry, pharmacology, or biochemistry, and at least two years of experience 


with the research, development, or production of pharmaceuticals. (Ex. 1009, 


¶¶ 20-22; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 35-37.) 


C. Ground 1: Claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16 and 18-24 Are Obvious Over 
Austin in View of Freeman 


The following claim chart shows the limitations of the above claims and the 


disclosure of each limitation in the prior art:

As shown in the above claim chart, the combination of Austin and Freeman 


discloses all of the limitations of claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16 and 18-24. (See Ex. 1011, 


¶¶ 50-51, 53-54, 59-65, 67-73, 116-20, 134-35, 138-44, 163-82.) As discussed 


below, a POSITA would have had several reasons to combine Austin and Freeman 


with a reasonable expectation of success in arriving at the claimed subject matter 


before February 16, 2005. (Id. ¶¶ 145-62, 183-84.) Petitioner is not aware of any 


secondary considerations that would render claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16 and 18-24 of the 


‘657 Patent non-obvious. (Id.) 


1. Austin Discloses 5-Fluoro Benzoxaborole as an Antifungal 
Agent 


Austin discloses 5-fluoro benzoxaborole as a preferred fungicide, which is 


the exact same compound recited in claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16 and 18-24 of the ‘657 


Patent, and a number of organic solvents to form solvates with 5-fluoro 


benzoxaborole, including “ethanol or glycols such as . . . propylene glycol.” (Ex. 


1002, at 6:36-37; Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 32, 34-35; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 54, 82-83, 85-86, 147, 165, 


170.) 


 Notably, Austin discloses that 5-fluoro benzoxaborole has significant 


antifungal activity against Candida albicans (CA), a fungus often associated with
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


30 
 


onychomycosis, at the lowest concentration tested (5 parts per million). (Ex. 1002, 


at 36-37, Table 9; Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 32, 35; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 84-85, 87-88, 173-75.) In a 


biocide composition, Austin identifies a preferred concentration of the oxaborole 


“more especially from 10 to 20% by weight relative to the total weight of the 


biocide composition.” (Ex. 1002, at 7:5-9; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 85, 168.)  


2. Freeman Discloses the Topical Application of Boron-Based 
Compound Formulations to Treat Onychomycosis  


Freeman discloses “methods and compositions for treating fungal infections, 


and more particularly, dermatophytoses or on[y]chomycosis of the fingernail and 


the toenail” with phenyl boronic acid and derivatives thereof. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [001], 


[0022]; Ex. 1009, ¶ 36; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 90, 141.) Freeman recognizes that both 


“dermatophytes and non-dermatophytes, especially Candida Sp., have been 


identified as etiologic agents of onychomycosis,” and that the “dermatophyte 


species that most often causes onychomycosis” include “T. rubrum.” (Ex. 1003, 


¶ [008]; Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 37, 39; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 91, 141.)  


The topical compositions for treating onychomycosis in Freeman include 


“phenyl boronic acid and derivatives thereof . . . . [which] have been found to be 


particularly useful in treating nail fungal infections.” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0022]; Ex. 


1009, ¶ 38; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 92, 142.) Additionally, “pharmacologically active 


compounds of this invention can be . . . . employed in admixtures with
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


31 
 


conventional excipients, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances 


suitable for topical application.” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0037]; Ex. 1011, ¶ 94.) 


Freeman discloses phenyl boronic acid (“PBA”), as well as fluoro phenyl 


boronic acid derivatives of PBA, which have the following structures:

(Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0028]-[0034], [0062] (“R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5” are all fluorine or 


“R3” is fluorine and the remaining substituents are hydrogen); Ex. 1009, ¶ 36; Ex. 


1011, ¶¶ 92, 143.) In vitro tests by Freeman show that both PBA and pentafluoro 


phenyl boronic acid exhibit antifungal activity by inhibiting T. rubrum in 


concentrations between 5-10 mg/ml. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0033]-[0037]; Ex. 1009, ¶ 39; 


Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 93, 143.)      


 Freeman discloses applying topical compositions containing PBA or its 


derivatives to the skin or nails “in the form of a buffered solution, lotion, or 


ointment. . . . once daily until cure” to treat onychomycosis. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0030], 


[0053], [0064]; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 93-95, 144.) For example, Freeman describes an 


effective amount of PBA, most preferably “from about 2% to about 50%” by 


weight, in cosmetic or therapeutic vehicles, such as “emollients . . . and any other
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657

conventional cosmetic forming agent,” or in “[s]uitable pharmaceutically 


acceptable carriers,” such as “water . . . alcohols . . . [and] polyethylene glycols.” 


(Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0038], [0064], [0068]; Ex. 1011, ¶ 144.) 


3. Summary: Claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16 and 18-24 Are Obvious Over 
Austin in View of Freeman 


Reason to Combine the References with a Reasonable Expectation of 


Success: Given the foregoing, a POSITA would have had several reasons to 


combine Austin and Freeman before February 16, 2005 with a reasonable 


expectation of success because: (1) both references teach the use of boron-based 


compounds as fungicides; (2) both references also disclose the use of boron-based 


compounds to specifically inhibit Candida albicans or T. rubrum, which are fungi 


responsible for onychomycosis; and (3) Austin discloses boron-based compounds 


that have structural similarity to Freeman’s preferred compounds in topical 


formulations for treating and inhibiting onychomycosis in humans. (Ex. 1009, 


¶¶ 40-41; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 136-37, 145-62, 183-84.)  


Austin specifically discloses that the compound claimed in the ‘657 Patent, 


5-fluoro benzoxaborole, is a preferred fungicide to effectively inhibit Candida 


albicans. (Ex. 1009, ¶ 35; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 82-85, 87-89, 139.) Austin further identifies 


water-miscible organic solvents for use with 5-fluoro benzoxaborole, including 


ethanol and propylene glycol, and a preferred concentration of biocide from 10 to
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


33 
 


20% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 86, 


147.) Freeman specifically discloses pharmaceutical formulations of boron 


compositions including PBA and derivatives thereof for topical application directly 


to the nails of humans to effectively treat onychomycosis typically caused by the 


organisms Candida Sp., Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum. 


(Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 37-39; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 89-95, 141-43, 147.) 


A POSITA seeking to develop a therapeutic treatment for onychomycosis 


before February 16, 2005 would have understood that boron compounds, e.g., 


boronic acids and boron heterocycles, were effective fungicides safely applied to 


humans. (Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 29-31, 41; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 89-90, 93-95, 145-46, 153-54, 159-


60; see also Ex. 1031, at 322 (“[N]one [of the boronic acids] to date has been 


found to be unusually toxic.”).) A POSITA would have further recognized from 


Freeman a number of topical formulations for effective delivery of boron-based 


fungicides, including cosmetic or therapeutic formulations such as emollients, and 


pharmaceutically acceptable carriers including water, alcohols, and polyethylene 


glycols. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0038], [0068]; Ex. 1009, ¶ 39; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 93-94, 144.) 


5-fluoro benzoxaborole, which is a boron heterocycle, shares common 


structural features with the compounds of Freeman, which are cyclic compounds 


that include boron. (Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 35-36; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 82-83, 92, 139, 143, 155.) A 


POSITA would have expected that 5-fluoro benzoxaborole, which shares similar
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


34 
 


structural features with the compounds of Freeman, would likely share similar 


functional features. (Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 40-41; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 149, 153, 155.) Indeed, both 


5-fluoro benzoxaborole and the Freeman compounds effectively inhibit Candida 


species, and the Freeman compounds also inhibit T. rubrum. (Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 33, 35, 


37; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 91, 93, 95, 141, 145-46, 148, 156.) Thus, a POSITA would have 


expected 5-fluoro benzoxaborole, which shares functional activity with the 


compounds of Freeman, would likely inhibit additional fungi responsible for 


onychomycosis, e.g., T. rubrum. (Ex. 1009, ¶ 41; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 149, 152-54, 156.) 


A POSITA would have been further motivated to select 5-fluoro 


benzoxaborole as disclosed by Austin for its relatively small molecular weight. 


(Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 150, 157.) Penetration of the nail barrier is more effective with 


smaller molecular weight compounds, which was known in the art. (Id.; Ex. 1032, 


at 9.) Indeed, Freeman effectively treated onychomycosis in humans with phenyl 


boronic acid (121.9 Daltons) and pentafluoro phenyl boronic acid (211.88 


Daltons). (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 151, 158; Exs. 1046-47.) A POSITA would have expected 


that 5-fluoro benzoxaborole would effectively penetrate the nail plate following 


topical administration because Freeman discloses similar molecular weight 


compounds that effectively treat onychomycosis with topical application. (Id.)       


A POSITA would also have had a reasonable expectation of successfully 


determining a cosmetically or therapeutically effective amount of 5-fluoro

benzoxaborole to treat or inhibit onychomycosis. (Ex. 1009, ¶¶ 33, 35, 39; Ex. 


1011, ¶ 160.) The level of one of ordinary skill in the art is high. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 160; 


Ex. 1022, at 8.) Determining a therapeutically effective amount of 5-fluoro 


benzoxaborole to treat onychomycosis involves nothing more than routine 


experimentation. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 46-48, 160-61.) Austin disclosed that 5-fluoro 


benzoxaborole effectively inhibits Candida albicans, among other fungi, at 


concentrations as low as 5 ppm. (Id. ¶¶ 140, 156; Ex. 1002, at 32-33, 36-37, Table 


9.) Freeman disclosed effective inhibition of T. rubrum at concentrations of 5-10 


mg/ml of PBA or pentafluoro phenyl boronic acid. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0034]-[0037]; 


Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 93, 149.) 


When a patent “simply arranges old elements,” i.e., use of 5-fluoro 


benzoxaborole in a topical therapeutic composition, “with each [element] 


performing the same function it had been known to perform,” i.e., inhibiting 


Candida albicans and/or T. rubrum, “and yields no more than one would expect 


from such an arrangement,” i.e., effective inhibition of onychomycosis, “the 


combination is obvious.” KSR, 550 U.S. at 417. The combination of Austin and 


Freeman discloses all of the limitations of claims 1-2, 4-5, 10-16 and 18-24. (Ex. 


1011, ¶¶ 82-95, 145-62, 183-84.)  


D. Ground 2: Claim 6 of the ‘657 Patent Is Obvious Under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 103(a) Over Austin in View of Freeman and Chaudhuri

The following claim chart shows the limitations of the above claim and the 


disclosure of each limitation in the prior art: 


7,767,657 Austin in view of Freeman and Chaudhuri 
6. The 
formulation of 
claim 1, 
comprising: 
about 
propylene 
glycol:ethanol 
in a ratio of 
about 1:4, and 
about 1:10 
wt/volume of 
said 1,3-
dihydro-5-
fluoro-1-
hydroxy-2,1-
benzoxaborole. 


▪ See independent claim 1; see Ex. 1002, at 7:5-9 (“The 
concentration of the oxaborole in the biocide composition is . . . 
more especially from 10 to 20% by weight relative to the total 
weight of the biocide composition.”).10 
Austin  
▪ “suitable water-miscible organic solvents are…alcohols such as 
ethanol or glycols such as . . . propylene glycol” (Id. at 6:34-37.) 
Freeman 
▪ “[s]uitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers” include “water 
. . . alcohols . . . polyethylene glycols” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0038].) 
Chaudhuri 
▪ “[S]uitable solvents include pharmaceutically acceptable lower 
alkanols of one to four carbon atoms (e.g., ethanol . . .) [and] 
pharmaceutically acceptable dihydroxylacohols (e.g., . . . 
propylene glycol . . .).” (Ex. 1004, col. 6:2-7.)

37 
 


(Id. at cols. 8:57-9:10.) 
 
As shown in the above chart, the combination of Austin, Freeman, and 


Chaudhuri discloses all of the limitations of claim 6. (See Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 55, 132, 


186-87.) As discussed below, a POSITA would have had several reasons to 


combine Austin, Freeman, and Chaudhuri with a reasonable expectation of success 


in arriving at the claimed subject matter. (Id. ¶¶ 185, 193-99.) Petitioner is not 


aware of any secondary considerations that would render claim 6 of the ‘657 Patent 


non-obvious. (Id.) 


1. Austin Discloses 5-Fluoro Benzoxaborole as an Antifungal 
Agent and Freeman Discloses the Topical Application of 
Boron-Based Compounds to Treat Onychomycosis            


Petitioner incorporates its discussion of Austin and Freeman from Sections 


VI.C.1-VI.C.3. In particular, Austin identifies a preferred concentration from 10 to 


20% by weight of 5-fluoro benzoxaborole relative to the total weight of biocide 


composition, and organic solvents including ethanol and propylene glycol. (Ex. 


1002, at 6:34-37, 7:5-9; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 188-89.) In vitro tests by Freeman show that 


phenyl boronic acid and derivatives exhibit antifungal activity against T. rubrum in 


concentrations from 5-10 mg/ml. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0034]-[0037]; Ex. 1011, ¶ 190.)    


2. Chaudhuri Discloses a Formulation of Propylene 
Glycol:Ethanol in a Ratio of About 1:4 with About 1:10 
Wt/Volume of Antifungal 


Chaudhuri discloses topical formulations of antifungal drugs for treating
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


38 
 


onychomycosis in humans, e.g., caused by dermatophytes such as Trichophyton 


rubrum or T. mentagrophytes, and in particular, discloses a stable topical gel 


formulation, including an antifungal and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable 


excipients, that was “capable of delivering the antifungal through the nail barrier.” 


(Ex. 1004, Abstract, col. 1:21-30, col. 2:8-15; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 96, 191.)  


In formulation, Chaudhuri describes a “therapeutically effective amount” of 


antifungal compound (e.g., butenafine), “[p]referably . . . about 1% to about 10% 


by weight and more preferably about 2% to about 8% by weight.” (Ex. 1004, col. 


5:11-30; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 97, 192.) In Table B, Chaudhuri discloses compositions 


including propylene glycol between 5-20 wt %, ethanol between 20-80 wt %, and 


antifungal between 0.5-15 wt %.11 (Ex. 1004, cols. 8:60-9:11; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 97, 


192.) Thus, Chaudhuri describes a topical formulation for treatment of 


onychomycosis with propylene glycol to ethanol in a ratio of about 1:4 (i.e., ratios 


of propylene glycol:ethanol from about 5:20 wt % to about 20:80 wt %) and about 


1:10 wt/volume of antifungal (i.e., about 0.4-12.4% w/v). (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 98, 192.) 


3. Summary: Claim 6 Is Obvious Over Austin in View of Freeman 
and Chaudhuri 


                                                 
11 For antifungal in 1 part propylene glycol to 4 parts ethanol, 0.5-15 wt % converts 


to 0.4-12.4% w/v (presuming that 1.93 mL propylene glycol plus 10.13 mL ethanol 


is about 12.06 mL 1:4 propylene glycol to ethanol). (Ex. 1011, ¶ 192 n.6.)

Reason to Combine the References and Reasonable Expectation of 


Success: As admitted in the ‘657 Patent, preparation of the claimed formulations 


was “well known in the art.” (Ex. 1001, col. 188:29-51; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 123, 194.) 


The ‘657 Patent does not describe any new or unexpected results attributable to the 


pharmaceutical formulation, nor was the formulation limited to avoid prior art. 


Before February 16, 2005, a POSITA would have had a reason to combine the 


disclosures in Austin, Freeman and Chaudhuri for all the reasons discussed above 


for Austin and Freeman. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 193.) A POSITA would have had further 


motivation to combine Chaudhuri because it describes topical formulations for 


effectively delivering antifungal compounds (e.g., butenafine) of higher molecular 


weight (e.g., 317.47 Daltons) than 5-fluoro benzoxaborole (151.93 Daltons) 


through the nail barrier to treat onychomycosis. (Id. ¶¶ 195-97; Ex. 1040, at 1.) A 


POSITA would have reasonably expected that a formulation that effectively 


delivers a higher molecular weight antifungal agent through the nail barrier would 


be likely to effectively deliver 5-fluoro benzoxaborole to treat onychomycosis for 


all the reasons discussed above for Austin and Freeman. (Id. ¶¶ 198-99.) 


E. Ground 3: Claims 3 and 7 of the ‘657 Patent Are Obvious Under 
35 U.S.C. § 103(a) Over Austin in View of Freeman and Samour 


The following claim chart shows the limitations of the above claims and the 


disclosure of each limitation in the prior art:

Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


40 
 


7,767,657 Austin in view of Freeman and Samour 
3. The formulation 
of claim 1, 
wherein said 
formulation is a 
lacquer. 


▪ See independent claim 1 and dependent claim 2; see, e.g., 
Ex. 1002, at 6:32-38 (“If the medium to be protected is an 
aqueous medium, the carrier is preferably water or a water-
miscible organic solvent or mixture thereof. . . . [S]uitable 
water-miscible organic solvents are . . . alcohols such as 
ethanol or glycols such as . . . propylene glycol . . . .”). 
Freeman 
▪ “A pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable vehicle can 
include a powder, lotion, gel, spray, stick, cream, ointment, 
liquid, emulsion, foam or aerosol. The active PBA compound 
can be incorporated into a liquid in dissolved form or 
colloidal form. The liquid can be a solvent, partial solvent, or 
non-solvent.” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0065].) 
▪ “[T]he PBA compound can be applied as a powder. It can be 
applied as a dry powder to moist skin or nails, or as a 
premoistened powder to dry skin or nails. Preferably, the 
resultant paste or solution is allowed to dry to form an 
essentially invisible skin or nail coating.” (Id. ¶ [0066].) 
Samour 
▪ “A nail lacquer effective for the treatment or prevention of 
fungal infections, such as, onychomycosis, includes . . . 
antifungal agent in a clear, stable, film-forming lacquer 
vehicle . . . .” (Ex. 1005, Abstract.) 


7. The formulation 
of claim 1, 
comprising: about 
70% ethanol; 
about 20% 
poly(vinyl methyl 
ether-alt-maleic 
acid monobutyl 
ester) and about 
10% of said 1,3-
dihydro-5-fluoro-
1-hydroxy-2,1-
benzoxaborole. 


▪ See independent claim 1; see, e.g., Ex. 1002, at 7:5-9 (“The 
concentration of the oxaborole in the biocide composition is 
. . . more especially from 10 to 20% by weight relative to the 
total weight of the biocide composition.”). 
Austin  
▪ “[S]uitable water-miscible organic solvents are . . . alcohols 
such as ethanol or glycols such as . . . propylene glycol . . . .” 
(Id. at 6:32-38.) 
Freeman 
▪ “The active PBA compound can be incorporated into a 
liquid in dissolved form or colloidal form. The liquid can be a 
solvent, partial solvent, or non-solvent.” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0065].) 
▪ “Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include . . . 
water . . . [and] alcohols . . . .” (Id. ¶ [0038].)

Samour 
▪ “A nail lacquer effective for the treatment or prevention of 
fungal infections, such as, onychomycosis, includes . . . 
antifungal agent in a clear, stable, film-forming lacquer 
vehicle . . . .” (Ex. 1005, Abstract.) 
▪ “Typically, amounts of active antifungal agent in the range 
of from about 0.5 to 20 percent by weight, preferably from 
about 1 to 10 percent, by weight, of the total composition 
(including solvents, film-forming polymer, enhancer, etc.) 
will suffice for compositions for treatment as well as 
compositions for prevention.” (Id. at col. 12:9-14.) 
▪ “Film-forming polymers useful in the present invention are 
commercially available, such as . . . acrylic copolymers . . . 
under the tradename Eudragit, e.g., Eudragits E, RS, RL,; the 
methylvinyl ether copolymers . . . under the tradename 
Gantrez, e.g., Gantrez ES-335I, Gantrez ES-425, ES-435 . . . . 
Particularly good results have been obtained with . . . Gantrez 
ES-425.” (Id. at cols. 7:54-8:7.) 
▪ “[S]atisfactory results are obtained when the amount of film-
forming polymer is in the range of from about 10 to about 70 
percent, preferably from about 15 to about 50 percent, 
especially from about 20 to 40 percent by weight of the total 
nail lacquer composition.” (Id. at col. 8:39-44.) 
▪ “Solvents which may be used in the nail lacquer 
compositions . . . may be selected from among the usual 
physiologically safe organic solvents for lacquer compositions 
. . . . As examples of such solvents mention may be made of 
lower alkanols, e.g., ethanol . . . .” (Id. at col. 9:31-49.) 
▪ See Example 7, No. 318A, a lacquer formulation including 
71% ethanol, 24% film-forming polymer (Eudragit RL), and 
5% active ingredient (econazole). (See id. at col. 22:20-36.) 


 
As shown in the above claim chart, the combination of Austin, Freeman, and 


Samour discloses all of the limitations of claims 3 and 7. (See Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 52, 56, 


118, 201-03.) As discussed below, a POSITA would have had several reasons to 


combine Austin, Freeman, and Samour with a reasonable expectation of success in
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


42 
 


arriving at the claimed subject matter. (Id. ¶¶ 200, 211-16.) Petitioner is not aware 


of any secondary considerations that would render claims 3 and 7 of the ‘657 


Patent non-obvious. (Id.) 


1. Austin Discloses 5-Fluoro Benzoxaborole as an Antifungal 
Agent and Freeman Discloses the Topical Application of 
Boron-Based Compounds to Treat Onychomycosis            


Petitioner incorporates its discussion of Austin and Freeman from Sections 


VI.C.1-VI.C.3 and VI.D.1. (See also id. ¶¶ 204-06.)   


2. Samour Discloses a Formulation of About 70% Ethanol; About 
20% Poly(Vinyl Methyl Ether-Alt-Maleic Acid Monobutyl 
Ester) and About 10% Antifungal 


Samour discloses a nail lacquer effective for treating onychomycosis in 


humans, caused by dermatophytes, molds and Candida, including dermatophytes 


Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes; and in particular, Samour discloses 


“improvements in the physical properties (e.g., durability, water-resistance, 


flexibility) of water-insoluble adherent films . . . of [a] nail lacquer composition, as 


well as improved diffusion characteristics of active principle(s) included in the 


lacquer composition from the resulting film.” (Ex. 1005, Abstract, col. 1:23-35, 


col. 3:59-65; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 99, 207.)  


Samour provides that “amounts of active antifungal agent [e.g., econazole] 


. . . range . . . from about 0.5 to 20 percent by weight, preferably from about 1 to 10 


percent, by weight.” (Ex. 1005, col. 12:9-14, col. 16:40-62; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 100, 208.)
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


43 
 


Samour describes “[f]ilm-forming polymers . . . such as . . . methylvinyl ether 


copolymers sold . . . under the tradename Gantrez, e.g., . . . Gantrez ES-425 [i.e., 


poly(vinyl methyl ether-alt-maleic acid monobutyl ester)].” (Ex. 1005, col. 7:54-


62; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 101, 208.) Samour discloses that “satisfactory results are obtained 


when the amount of film-forming polymer is . . . preferably from about 15 to about 


50 percent, especially from about 20 to 40 percent by weight of the total nail 


lacquer composition.” (Ex. 1005, col. 8:39-44; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 101, 208.)  


Samour further provides that, when a plasticizer is present, it will be in the 


range “especially, from about 4 to 8 percent, based on the total weight of the 


composition.” (Ex. 1005, col. 9:18-23; Ex. 1011, ¶ 102.) Samour identifies a 


number of “physiologically safe organic solvents,” including ethanol. (Ex. 1005, 


col. 9:31-49; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 103, 209.) In Example 7, Samour discloses a lacquer 


formulation including 71% ethanol, 24% film-forming polymer (Eudragit RL), and 


5% active ingredient (econazole). (Ex. 1005, col. 22:20-36; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 104, 209.) 


Accordingly, Samour describes a topical formulation for treatment of 


onychomycosis with about 70% ethanol (i.e., Example 7, 71% ethanol), about 20% 


poly(vinyl methyl ether-alt-maleic acid monobutyl ester) (i.e., between 20 and 40% 


Gantrez ES-425), and about 10% antifungal (i.e., antifungal from about 0.5-20% 


by weight, preferably from about 1-10% by weight). (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 105, 210.) 


3. Summary: Claims 3 and 7 Are Obvious Over Austin in View of
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


44 
 


Freeman and Samour 


Reason to Combine the References and Reasonable Expectation of 


Success: As admitted in the ‘657 Patent, preparation of the claimed formulations 


was “well known in the art.” (Ex. 1001, col. 188:29-51; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 123, 194, 


212.) The ‘657 Patent does not describe any new or unexpected results attributable 


to the pharmaceutical formulation, nor was the formulation limited to avoid prior 


art. A POSITA would have had a reason to combine the disclosures in Austin, 


Freeman and Samour for all the reasons discussed above for Austin and Freeman. 


(Ex. 1011, ¶ 211.) A POSITA would have had further reason to combine because 


Samour describes topical lacquer formulations with improved physical properties 


(e.g., durability, water-resistance, flexibility), as well as improved diffusion 


characteristics of active antifungals (e.g., econazole) having higher molecular 


weights (e.g., 381.68 Daltons) than 5-fluoro benzoxaborole for treating 


onychomycosis in humans. (Id. ¶¶ 213-14.) A POSITA would have reasonably 


expected that an improved lacquer formulation for topical delivery of higher 


molecular weight antifungal agents to the nail of a human would be likely to 


effectively deliver 5-fluoro benzoxaborole to treat or inhibit onychomycosis for all 


the reasons discussed above for Austin and Freeman. (Id. ¶¶ 215-16.) 


F. Ground 4: Claim 8 of the ‘657 Patent Is Obvious Under 35 U.S.C. 
§ 103(a) Over Austin in View of Freeman, Friedman and Atlas

Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


45 
 


The following claim chart shows the limitations of the above claim and the 


disclosure of each limitation in the prior art: 


7,767,657 Austin in view of Freeman, Friedman and Atlas 
8. The formulation 
of claim 1, 
comprising: about 
56% ethanol; 
about 14% water; 
about 15% poly(2-
hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate); 
about 5% dibutyl 
sebacate and about 
10% of said 1,3-
dihydro-5-fluoro-
1-hydroxy-2,1-
benzoxaborole. 


▪ See independent claim 1; see, e.g., Ex. 1002, at 7:5-9 (“The 
concentration of the oxaborole in the biocide composition is 
. . . more especially from 10 to 20% by weight relative to the 
total weight of the biocide composition.”). 
Freeman 
▪ “The active PBA compound can be incorporated into a 
liquid in dissolved form or colloidal form. The liquid can be a 
solvent, partial solvent, or non-solvent.” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0065].) 
▪ “Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include . . . 
water . . . [and] alcohols . . . .” (Id. ¶ [0038].) 
Friedman  
▪ “The most common organisms involved in the fungal 
infections of the nail are Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton 
mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, . . . [and] 
Candida albicans . . . .” (Ex. 1006, col. 1:27-31.) 
▪ “The present invention provides a pharmaceutical sustained 
release preparation in a varnish or spray form for local 
treatment of the nail and surrounding tissues . . . . comprising: 
(a) an antifungal agent; (b) a keratolytic agent; (c) a 
humectant; (d) water; (e) a polymeric film-forming agent; (f) 
at least one additional excipient; and (g) a solvent system 
including at least one volatile solvent.” (Id. at col. 3:32-59.) 
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the concentration of the 
polymeric film-forming agent in the varnish solution is less 
than about 7.5% (w/w).” (Id. at col. 5:27-29.) 
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the weight ratio of the 
plasticizer to the polymer is in the range from about 0.04:1 to 
about 0.3:1.” (Id. at col. 5:62-64.) 
▪ “The hydrophobic methacrylic polymers are preferably 
Eudragit S, Eudragit L, Eudragit RS, and Eudragit RL 
manufactured by Rohm Pharma, but hydrophobic methacrylic 
polymers from other sources can also be used. The polymers 
provide a uniform film, retard the release rate of the drugs

(agents), and can be mixed in regulated amounts to attain the 
desired drug release characteristics.” (Id. at col. 9:8-15.) 
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the at least one additional 
excipient is selected from a group consisting of plasticizers. In 
a preferred embodiment the plasticizer is selected from the 
group consisting of dibutyl sebacate. . . .” (Id. at col. 5:49-55.) 
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the concentration of the 
plasticizer in the varnish solution is from about 0.1% to about 
2% (w/w).” (Id. at col. 5:56-58.) 
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the alcohol is selected from the 
group consisting of ethanol . . . . In a preferred embodiment 
the volatile solvent is present in an amount . . . from about 
60% to about 90% (w/w), relative to the total weight of the 
composition.” (Id. at col. 6:1-9.) 
▪ “Preferably the water concentration in the varnish solution is 
less than about 5% (w/w), more preferably 0.5-4.5% (w/w) 
and most preferably 1-4.5% (w/w).” (Id. at col. 8:56-58.) 
Atlas 
▪ “Synthetic hydrogels are used in . . . membranes for 
controlled drug delivery. Poly-HEMA (poly 2 hydroxylthyl 
[sic] methacrylate) is the most widely used hydrogel.” (Ex. 
1007, Abstract.) 
▪ “[B]iocompatability of hydrogels is attributed to their ability 
to simulate natural tissue due to their high water content and 
their special surface properties.” (Id. at col. 1:14-16.) 
▪ “P-HEMA hydrogels fibers we have described are 
biocompatable . . . and can be appropriately combined with 
traditional cosmetic[s] . . . applied [to the] skin and nail . . . .” 
(Id. at col. 1:21-25.) 
▪ “The percentage of fibers added range from 0.5% to 15% for 
different types of products . . . . The hydrogel fibers may be 
efficiently utilized as low as 1 % due to their high swelling 
and storage properties.” (Id. at col. 2:45-50.) 
▪ “The P-HEMA hollow fibers will act as a reservoir and 
matrix for diffusion-controlled delivery to skin and nails. P-
HEMA fibers are combined with water along with active 
ingredients, humectant, protein or ethyl alcohol containing 
perfume and other ingredients required to be applied to skin 
and allowed to be absorbed.” (Id. at col. 2:58-64.)

▪ Example 4 provides P-HEMA in a nail polish composition. 
(Id. at cols. 3:57-4:7.) 


 
As shown in the above chart, the combination of Austin, Freeman, Friedman 


and Atlas discloses all of the limitations of claim 8. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 218-19.) As 


discussed below, a POSITA would have had several reasons to combine Austin, 


Freeman, Friedman and Atlas with a reasonable expectation of success in arriving 


at the claimed subject matter. (Id. ¶¶ 217, 229-37.) Petitioner is not aware of any 


secondary considerations that would render claim 8 non-obvious. (Id.) 


1. Austin Discloses 5-Fluoro Benzoxaborole as an Antifungal 
Agent and Freeman Discloses the Topical Application of 
Boron-Based Compounds to Treat Onychomycosis            


Petitioner incorporates its discussion of Austin and Freeman from Sections 


VI.C.1-VI.C.3 and VI.D.1. (See also id. ¶¶ 220-22.)    


2. Friedman Discloses a Formulation of About 56% Ethanol; 
About 14% Water; About 15% Methacrylic Polymer; About 
5% Dibutyl Sebacate and About 10% Antifungal 


Friedman discloses a sustained-release formulation for delivery of 


antifungal agents to fingernails or toenails for treating fungal infections caused by 


“Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes . . . [and] Candida albicans” 


to effectively treat onychomycosis. (Ex. 1006, Abstract, col. 1:28-30, col. 3:32-59; 


Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 107, 223.) Friedman provides that the concentration of the film-


forming polymer in the varnish solution is “less than about 7.5% (w/w).” (Ex.
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


48 
 


1006, col. 5:27-29; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 108, 224.) Friedman describes a number of 


methacrylic polymers (e.g., Eudragits) for use as film-forming polymers, but notes 


that methacrylic polymers from other sources can also be used. (Ex. 1006, col. 9:3-


15; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 108, 224.) 


Friedman describes plasticizers, such as dibutyl sebacate, and provides that 


the concentration of plasticizer in the varnish solution is from “about 0.1% to about 


2% (w/w),” and that the preferable weight ratio of the plasticizer to the polymer 


ranges from “about 0.04:1 to about 0.3:1” (i.e., 1:3). (Ex. 1006, col. 5:51-58, 62-


64; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 109, 225.) 


Suitable volatile solvents include “ethanol,” preferably from “about 60% to 


about 90% (w/w), relative to the total weight of the composition.”12 (Ex. 1006, col. 


6:1-9; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 110, 225.) Friedman discloses that the water concentration in 


the varnish solution is “less than about 5% (w/w), more preferably 0.5-4.5% (w/w) 


and most preferably 1-4.5% (w/w).” (Ex. 1006, col. 8:56-61; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 110, 


225.) At the above-described concentration ranges, each excipient of Friedman’s 


varnish formulation serves its functional purpose, whether as a film-forming agent, 


plasticizer, solvent, or hydrate. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 121-31, 226-27.) 


                                                 
12 60% to about 90% (w/w) ethanol corresponds to 47.4% to about 71.1% (w/v) 


ethanol. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 225 n.7.)

3. Atlas Discloses Poly(2-Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate) in a 
Cosmetic Nail Lacquer 


Atlas discloses that synthetic hydrogels may be used for controlled drug 


delivery and that poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (i.e., Poly-HEMA or P-


HEMA) was the “most widely used hydrogel.” (Ex. 1007, Abstract; Ex. 1011, 


¶¶ 111, 228.) Atlas further provides that the “biocompatability of hydrogels is 


attributed to their ability to simulate natural tissue due to their high water content,” 


and that hydrogels exhibit “high swelling” properties. (Ex. 1007, col. 1:14-16, col. 


2:48-50; Ex. 1011, ¶ 228.)  


In Example 4, Atlas discloses P-HEMA in a cosmetic nail polish 


composition, (Ex. 1007, cols. 3:57-4:7; Ex. 1011, ¶ 228), and notes that the “P-


HEMA hollow fibers will act as a reservoir and matrix for diffusion-controlled 


delivery to skin and nails” and may be “combined with water along with active 


ingredients, humectant, protein or ethyl alcohol containing perfume and other 


ingredients required to be applied to skin and allowed to be absorbed.” (Ex. 1007, 


col. 2:58-64; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 111-12, 228.) 


4. Summary: Claim 8 Is Obvious Over Austin in View of 
Freeman, Friedman and Atlas 


Reason to Combine the References and Reasonable Expectation of 


Success: As admitted in the ‘657 Patent, preparation of a formulation including 


“56% ethanol; 14% water; 15% poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); 5% dibutyl
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


50 
 


sebacate; 10% compound . . . . is well known in the art.” (Ex. 1001, col. 188:29-51; 


Ex. 1011, ¶ 230.) The ‘657 Patent does not provide any guidance as to why the 


claimed quantities were chosen, and does not attribute any significance or 


unexpected results to the claimed quantities. Nor was the claimed formulation 


limited to avoid prior art. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 230.) 


A POSITA would have had a reason to combine the disclosures in Austin, 


Freeman, Friedman and Atlas for all the reasons discussed above for Austin and 


Freeman. (Id. ¶ 229.) As was known in the art before February 16, 2005, “high-


swelling polymers” were “preferred” for pharmaceutical lacquer formulations. (Id. 


¶ 232; Ex. 1030, at 245.) One would have had reason to substitute P-HEMA as 


disclosed by Atlas for the methacrylic polymer of Friedman because P-HEMA was 


a well-known hydrogel capable of diffusion-controlled drug delivery to skin and 


nails and hydrogels were known to have high water content and high swelling 


properties, as taught by Atlas. (See Ex. 1007, Abstract; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 232-33, 236.) 


A POSITA would have had further reason to combine Friedman because 


like Freeman, Friedman discloses treating or inhibiting onychomycosis by 


administering a topical “sustained release” nail varnish to the nail of a human. (Ex. 


1011, ¶ 233.) Friedman describes preferred pharmaceutical formulations for the 


sustained release nail varnish with a ratio of plasticizer (e.g., dibutyl sebacate) to 


film-forming polymer (e.g., methacrylic polymer) of 1:3, which corresponds to the
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


51 
 


claimed ratio (5% dibutyl sebacate:15% P-HEMA). (Id. ¶ 231.) Friedman provides 


quantities of film-forming polymer, dibutyl sebacate and water that serve their 


respective functional purposes in the varnish formulation. (Id. ¶¶ 227, 231.) The 


Friedman varnish formulation also serves the functional purpose of the 


pharmaceutical formulation of claim 8. (See, e.g., Ex. 1001, col. 11:22-27; Ex. 


1011, ¶¶ 227, 231.) Moreover, Friedman provides for delivery of higher molecular 


weight compounds, e.g., miconazole nitrate (479.14 Daltons) and clotrimazole 


(344.84 Daltons), in a formulation including ethanol, water, methacrylic polymers, 


and dibutyl sebacate. (Ex. 1006, col. 13:1-38; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 227, 234, 237.)  


A POSITA would have reasonably expected that a sustained-release system 


for delivery of antifungal agents having higher molecular weights than 5-fluoro 


benzoxaborole to the nail of a human would be likely to effectively deliver a 


therapeutically effective amount of 5-fluoro benzoxaborole to treat onychomycosis 


for all the reasons discussed above for Austin and Freeman. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 229, 


235-37.) A POSITA would further have reasonably expected that P-HEMA, a 


methacrylic polymer, could be successfully substituted for the film-forming 


methacrylic polymers of Friedman because it was known for its high-swelling 


properties, use in controlled drug delivery, and use in topical cosmetic 


compositions to the skin and nails. (Id. ¶ 236.)

§ 103(a) Over Austin in View of Freeman, Samour and Friedman 


The following claim chart shows the limitations of the above claim and the 


disclosure of each limitation in the prior art: 


7,767,657 Austin in view of Freeman, Samour and Friedman 
9. The formulation 
of claim 1, 
comprising: about 
55% ethanol; 
about 15% ethyl 
acetate; about 15% 
poly(vinyl 
acetate); about 5%

benzoxaborole. 


▪ See independent claim 1; see, e.g., Ex. 1002, at 7:5-9 (“The 
concentration of the oxaborole in the biocide composition is 
. . . more especially from 10 to 20% by weight relative to the 
total weight of the biocide composition.”). 
Freeman 
▪ “The active PBA compound can be incorporated into a 
liquid in dissolved form or colloidal form. The liquid can be a 
solvent, partial solvent, or non-solvent.” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [0065].) 
▪ “Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include . . . 
water . . . [and] alcohols . . . .” (Id. ¶ [0038].) 
Friedman  
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the plasticizer is selected from 
. . . dibutyl sebacate . . . .” (Ex. 1006, col. 5:51-55.) 
▪ “In a preferred embodiment the concentration of the 
plasticizer in the varnish solution is from about 0.1% to about 
2% (w/w).” (Id. at col. 5:56-58.) 
Samour 
▪ “[W]ater-insoluble, film-forming polymers which may be 
used in the nail lacquer compositions of this invention, 
include . . . polyvinyl acetate . . . .” (Ex. 1005, col. 6:23-25.) 
▪ “[S]atisfactory results are obtained when the amount of film-
forming polymer is in the range of from about 10 to about 70 
percent, preferably from about 15 to about 50 percent, 
especially from about 20 to 40 percent by weight of the total 
nail lacquer composition.” (Id. at col. 8:39-44.) 
▪ “Solvents which may be used in the nail lacquer 
compositions of this invention . . . may be selected from 
among the usual physiologically safe organic solvents for 
lacquer compositions . . . . [and] may be made of lower 
alkanols, e.g., ethanol . . . [and] lower alkyl esters of lower 
carboxylic acids, e.g., ethyl acetate . . . .” (Id. at col. 9:31-43.) 
▪ “When the additional plasticizer is present it [is] . . . most

Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


53 
 


usually in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20 percent, 
preferably from about 2 to 10 percent, especially, from about 
4 to 8 percent, based on the total weight of the composition.” 
(Id. at col. 9:18-23.) 
▪ “Typically, amounts of active antifungal agent in the range 
of from about 0.5 to 20 percent by weight, preferably from 
about 1 to 10 percent, by weight, of the total composition 
(including solvents, film-forming polymer, enhancer, etc.) 
will suffice for compositions for treatment as well as 
compositions for prevention.” (Id. at col. 12:9-14.) 
▪ See Table 1, MC 16074B, a lacquer formulation including 
6% SPE (2-nonyl-1,3-dioxolane), 6% propylene glycol, 34% 
ethanol, 25% ethyl acetate, 24% film-forming polymer 
(Amphomer LV-7), and 5% active ingredient (econazole). 
▪ See Table 1, MC 16074C, a lacquer formulation including 
6% SPE (2-nonyl-1,3-dioxolane), 6% propylene glycol, 49% 
ethanol, 10% ethyl acetate, 24% film-forming polymer 
(Amphomer LV-7), and 5% active ingredient (econazole). 
▪ See Table 1, MC 18236B, a lacquer formulation including 
6% SPE (2-nonyl-1,3-dioxolane), 6% propylene glycol, 56% 
ethanol, 24% film-forming polymer (Amphomer), and 8% 
active ingredient (econazole). (Id. at Table 1.) 


 
As shown in the above chart, the combination of Austin, Freeman, Samour 


and Friedman discloses all of the limitations of claim 9. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 239-40.) As 


discussed below, a POSITA would have had several reasons to combine Austin, 


Freeman, Samour and Friedman with a reasonable expectation of success in 


arriving at the claimed subject matter. (Id. ¶¶ 238, 251-59.) Petitioner is not aware 


of any secondary considerations that would render claim 9 of the ‘657 Patent non-


obvious. (Id.) 


1. Austin Discloses 5-Fluoro Benzoxaborole as an Antifungal 
Agent and Freeman Discloses the Topical Application of

Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


54 
 


Boron-Based Compounds to Treat Onychomycosis            


Petitioner incorporates its discussion of Austin and Freeman from Sections 


VI.C.1-VI.C.3 and VI.D.1. (See also Ex. id. ¶¶ 241-43.)  


2. Samour Discloses a Formulation of About 55% Ethanol; About 
15% Ethyl Acetate; About 15% Poly(Vinyl Acetate) and About 
10% Antifungal 


Samour discloses an improved nail lacquer effective for treating 


onychomycosis in humans caused by dermatophytes, molds and Candida, 


including dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes; and in 


particular, Samour discloses “improvements in the physical properties (e.g., 


durability, water-resistance, flexibility) of water-insoluble adherent films of . . . [a] 


nail lacquer composition, as well as improved diffusion characteristics of active 


principle(s) included in the lacquer composition from the resulting film.” (Ex. 


1005, Abstract, col. 1:23-35, col. 3:59-65; Ex. 1011, ¶ 244.) 


Amounts of active antifungal agent (e.g., econazole) “range . . . from about 


0.5 to 20 percent by weight, preferably from about 1 to 10 percent, by weight, of 


the total composition . . . for compositions for treatment as well as compositions 


for prevention.” (Ex. 1005, col. 12:9-14, col. 16:40-62; Ex. 1011, ¶ 245.) Samour 


describes water-insoluble, film-forming polymers for use in nail lacquer 


compositions, including polyvinyl acetate, and identifies a number of organic 


solvents, including “ethanol . . . [and] ethyl acetate.” (Ex. 1005, col. 6:23-25, col.
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


55 
 


9:31-43; Ex. 1011, ¶ 246.) 


Samour provides that “satisfactory results are obtained” when the amount of 


film-forming polymer is “preferably from about 15 to about 50 percent, especially 


from about 20 to 40 percent by weight of the total nail lacquer composition.” (Ex. 


1005, col. 8:39-44; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 101, 247.) Samour discloses lacquer formulations: 


(1) MC 16074C, including 49% ethanol, 10% ethyl acetate, 24% film-forming 


polymer (Amphomer LV-7), 5% active ingredient (econazole); (2) MC 18236B, 


including 56% ethanol, 24% film-forming polymer (Amphomer), 8% active 


ingredient (econazole); and (3) MC 16074B, including 34% ethanol, 25% ethyl 


acetate, 24% film-forming polymer (Amphomer LV-7), 5% active ingredient 


(econazole). (Ex. 1005, Table 1; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 104, 247.) 


Thus, Samour describes a topical formulation for treatment of 


onychomycosis with about 55% ethanol (e.g., MC 18236B, 56% ethanol); about 


15% ethyl acetate (e.g., MC 16074C, 10% ethyl acetate; MC 16074B, 25% ethyl 


acetate); about 15% poly(vinyl acetate) (e.g., film-forming agents in the range of 


about 15 to about 50 percent, especially from about 20 to 40 percent by weight); 


and about 10% antifungal (i.e., antifungal from about 0.5 to 20 percent by weight, 


preferably from about 1 to 10 percent, by weight). (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 106, 248.) 


3. Friedman Discloses a Formulation Including About 5% Dibutyl 
Sebacate
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


56 
 


Friedman discloses a sustained-release delivery system for delivery of 


antifungal agents to treat fungal infections of the nail caused by “Trichophyton 


rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes [and] Candida albicans,” including 


onychomycosis. (Ex. 1006, Abstract, col. 1:28-30; Ex. 1011, ¶ 249.)  


Friedman describes plasticizers, such as dibutyl sebacate, and provides that 


the concentration of the plasticizer in the varnish solution is from “about 0.1% to 


about 2% (w/w),” which allows the dibutyl sebacate to serve the functional 


purpose of a plasticizer in the nail varnish. (Ex. 1006, col. 5:51-58; Ex. 1011, 


¶¶ 227, 250.) Friedman states: “[p]lasticizers are added to the varnish solution in 


order to enhance the plasticity of the film formed and to modify the sustained 


release characteristics of the polymer.” (Ex. 1006, col. 9:44-46; Ex. 1011, ¶ 255.)  


4. Summary: Claim 9 Is Obvious Over Austin in View of 
Freeman, Samour and Friedman 


Reason to Combine the References and Reasonable Expectation of 


Success: As admitted in the ‘657 Patent, preparation of a formulation including 


“55% ethanol; 15% ethyl acetate; 15% poly(vinyl acetate); 5% dibutyl sebacate; 


10% compound . . . is well known in the art.” (Ex. 1001, col. 188:29-51.) The ‘657 


Patent does not provide any guidance as to why the claimed quantities were 


chosen, does not attribute any new or unexpected results to the claimed quantities, 


and did not limit the formulation to avoid prior art. (Ex. 1011, ¶ 252.)
Second Petition For Inter Partes Review 
Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


57 
 


A POSITA would have had a reason to combine the disclosures of Austin, 


Freeman, Samour and Friedman for all the reasons discussed above for Austin and 


Freeman. (Id. ¶¶ 251, 253, 257.) A POSITA would have had further reason to 


combine because Samour describes topical lacquer formulations including volatile 


solvents, film-forming agents, and plasticizers, with improved physical properties 


(e.g., durability, water-resistance, flexibility), as well as improved diffusion 


characteristics of active principles. (Id. ¶ 244.) Friedman describes a particular 


plasticizer, dibutyl sebacate, for use in topical lacquer formulations for treatment of 


onychomycosis. (Id. ¶ 250.) As plasticizers were known to modify the sustained 


release characteristics of a polymer, and dibutyl sebacate was a known plasticizer 


used in Friedman’s “sustained release” nail lacquer formulation, a POSITA would 


have had reason to modify the sustained release characteristics of the Samour 


formulation by substituting dibutyl sebacate as a plasticizer. (Id. ¶¶ 255-56, 259.)  


A POSITA would have reasonably expected that an improved lacquer 


formulation for topical delivery of antifungal agents having higher molecular 


weights than 5-fluoro benzoxaborole to the nail of a human, e.g., econazole 


(381.68 Daltons), miconazole nitrate (479.14 Daltons) and clotrimazole (344.84 


Daltons), would effectively deliver 5-fluoro benzoxaborole to treat or inhibit 


onychomycosis for all the reasons discussed above for Austin and Freeman. (Id. 


¶¶ 254, 258; see Ex. 1005, Table 1; Ex. 1006, col. 13:1-38; Exs. 1041-43.)

H. Ground 6: Claim 17 of the ‘657 Patent Is Obvious Under 35 
U.S.C. § 103(a) Over Austin in View of Freeman and Shapiro 


The following claim chart shows the limitations of the above claim and the 


disclosure of each limitation in the prior art: 


7,767,657 Austin in view of Freeman and Shapiro 
17. The 
formulation of 
claim 14, wherein 
said fungus or 
yeast is a member 
selected from . . . 
[a number of 
microorganisms 
including] 
Trichophyton 
verrucosum . . . 
[and] 
Microsporum 
gypseum . . . . 


▪ See independent claim 1 and dependent claim 14; see, e.g., 
Ex. 1002, at 36-37, Table 9 (“Example 64” where “R8” is “5-
F” and “R9” is “H” and “CA” is “Candida albicans”). 
Freeman 
▪ “The present invention relates to methods and compositions 
for treating fungal infections, and more particularly, 
dermatophytoses or onchomycosis of the fingernail and the 
toenail . . . .” (Ex. 1003, ¶ [001].) 
▪ “The dermatophyte species that most often causes 
onychomycosis . . . are T. rubrum [and] T. me[n]tagrophytes 
. . . . Both dermatophytes and non-dermatophytes, especially 
Candida Sp., have been identified as etiologic agents of 
onychomycosis.” (Id. ¶ [008].) 
Shapiro 
▪ “The compounds of this invention can be used to treat 
diverse types of fungal infections. . . . of the skin, hair and 
nails, namely: . . . Tinea unguium [sic, italics] 
(onychomycosis) when caused by one or more of the 
following genera of fungi: Trichophyton rubrum . . . 
Trichophyton mentagrophytes . . . Trichophyton verrucosum . 
. . [and] Microsporum gypseum.” (Ex. 1008, cols. 1:65-2:14.) 


 
As shown in the above chart, the combination of Austin, Freeman, and 


Shapiro discloses all of the limitations of claim 17. (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 66, 261-62.) A 


POSITA would have had several reasons to combine Austin, Freeman, and Shapiro 


with a reasonable expectation of success in arriving at the claimed subject matter.

59 
 


(Id. ¶¶ 260, 268-72.) Petitioner is not aware of any secondary considerations that 


would render claim 17 of the ‘657 Patent non-obvious. (Id.) 


1. Austin Discloses 5-Fluoro Benzoxaborole as an Antifungal 
Agent and Freeman Discloses the Topical Application of 
Boron-Based Compounds to Treat Onychomycosis            


Petitioner incorporates its discussion of Austin and Freeman from Sections 


VI.C.1-VI.C.3. In particular, Austin discloses that 5-fluoro benzoxaborole is an 


effective antifungal agent against each of the five (5) fungi tested: Aspergillus 


niger (AN); Aureobasidium pullulans (AP); Candida albicans (CA); Gliocladium 


roseum (GR); and Penicillium pinophylum (PP). (Ex. 1002, at 36-37, Table 9; Ex. 


1011, ¶¶ 263-64.) In vitro tests by Freeman show that phenyl boronic acid and 


derivatives exhibit antifungal activity by inhibiting T. rubrum in concentrations 


between 5-10 mg/ml. (Ex. 1003, ¶¶ [0034]-[0037]; Ex. 1011, ¶ 265.)     


2. Shapiro Discloses Compositions of Antifungal Compounds for 
Treating Diverse Types of Fungal Infections 


Shapiro discloses antifungal compounds for treatment of a number of 


infections of the skin, hair and nails, including Tinea unguium (onychomycosis), 


“caused by one or more of the following genera of fungi: Trichophyton rubrum . . . 


Trichophyton mentagrophytes . . . Trichophyton verrucosum… [and] Microsporum 


gypseum.” (Ex. 1008, col. 2:3-14; Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 113, 266.) Thus, Shapiro describes 


antifungal compounds that have cross-activity against microorganisms that cause

Patent No. 7,767,657 
 


60 
 


onychomycosis (e.g., Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) and 


microorganisms that cause other diseases of the skin (e.g., Trichophyton 


verrucosum and Microsporum gypseum). (Ex. 1011, ¶¶ 114, 267.) 


3. Summary: Claim 17 Is Obvious Over Austin in View of 
Freeman and Shapiro 


Reason to Combine the References and Reasonable Expectation of 


Success: Before February 16, 2005, a POSITA would have had a reason to 


combine the disclosures in Austin, Freeman and Shapiro for all the reasons 


discussed above for Austin and Freeman. (Id. ¶¶ 268, 271.) In addition, a POSITA 


would have had further motivation to combine Shapiro because like Freeman, 


Shapiro discloses treating onychomycosis in humans with pharmaceutical 


formulations. (Id. ¶¶ 269-70.) More specifically, Shapiro describes antifungal 


compounds that exhibit cross-activity against a number of different fungi, 


including cross-activity between fungi linked to onychomycosis and fungi linked 


to other fungal infections of the skin, hair and nails, such as Trichophyton 


verrucosum and Microsporum gypseum. (Id. ¶ 272.) 


VII. CONCLUSION 


For at least the reasons given above, claims 1-24 of the ‘657 Patent are 


unpatentable because they are obvious over the references cited herein. 


Accordingly, Petitioner respectfully requests IPR of claims 1-24 of the ‘657 Patent.
