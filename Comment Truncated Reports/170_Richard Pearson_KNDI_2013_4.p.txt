Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market
Oct. 4, 2013 10:11 AM ET68 comments
by: Richard Pearson


As I mentioned in my last article, Kandi Technologies (NASDAQ:KNDI) recently soared
from around $5.00 to a lifetime high of $9.20 in the span of just 8 days. Just like in June,
this monumental lift off came as the result of a single press release from Kandi and
several ARTICLES from individuals who are long the stock.


As has been the case in every instance in Kandi's past, these gains have not held. Kandi
has now declined 5 days in a row to $7.10, a very rapid decline of 23% from that recent
high just days ago. Yesterday the stock closed near the day's low of $7.02. If this rate of
decline continues, then Kandi will be below $5.50 by the end of next week.


It is clear that many investors who are active in Kandi have derived the vast majority of
their information from a series of highly bullish articles and from a private Yahoo message
board that was created specifically by those who promote Kandi. The information
presented seems to gain credibility because it appears to come from multiple independent
sources.


Unfortunately, much of the information which has been disseminated on Kandi (and which
has made the price soar) is 100% factually incorrect. Once again, as investors come to
realize that they have invested based on inaccurate information, the stock will certainly
erase its gains and go back below $5.00 once again.


To be specific, Kandi bulls have misled readers about numerous things including: Kandi's
manufacturing capabilities, Kandi's competitors, the current market demand for EVs in
China and the impact of government subsidies.


On the day before the publication of the Goldman article, Kandi had traded as low as
$6.60. On the day of the article, the stock rose as high as $8.60. Within 2 days, the stock
hit its all time high of $9.20. This was a rise of nearly 40% in just 2 days, based off of a
single article.


There is a very clear reason why the Goldman article (as with some of the others) moved
the stock. But as I will demonstrate, the truth is far different.

Readers should note that the statements below have come from independent sources
who have no position whatsoever in the stock. This includes Bloomberg, McKinsey,
Worldwide Watch and others.


Fact: The EV market in China suffers from too much capacity and too little demand


There are hundreds of EV manufacturers in China. These are not tiny no-name
companies. And they already have greater manufacturing capacity than Kandi. In addition,
the prices for their EVs can be seen to be lower than Kandi's. Their operational specs are
basically identical.


In my last article, I included a link to a search on China's Alibaba portal (in English) which
showed these hundreds of competitors. But clearly from the angry emails and comments
that have been written, we can see that almost no one even bothered to open the links
and read for themselves. Instead, a small number of vocal Kandi bulls simply rejected my
findings without even reading them.


I would strongly suggest that readers not simply rely on an interpretation of this list from
either me (I am short Kandi) or from Art Porcari (Art is long Kandi). Instead, I would
suggest that readers take a small amount of time to evaluate these competitors
themselves.


What they will see is that there are many producers of roadworthy and street legal
vehicles that derive the vast majority of their sales from entirely within China. Period.


Below is a very brief and partial selection from my Alibaba list, along with their delivery
capacities. As we can see, there are numerous manufacturers in China who have greater
manufacturing capacities AND lower prices than Kandi. I have included the link to the
individual vehicle listings so that viewers can see for themselves that these are mostly
identical to Kandi's cars. Beyond these, there are many more.

Of the EV makers that sell in China almost none of these companies trade on US stock
exchanges. The only ones that do (such as BYD and Geely) tend to be Hong Kong listed
and trade on the pink sheets. The EV makers in China typically market themselves only in
China. As a result, the vast majority of US investors are entirely unaware of the presence
of numerous competitors.


But the Kandi promoters have repeatedly claimed to have performed countless hours of
"due diligence" over the span of multiple years. The words "due diligence" appear
numerous times throughout their articles as assurance to readers about the thoroughness
of their work. Yet the information on competitors is easy to find for anyone who looks.


Author Tom Konrad (who was long the stock) lost a number of friends when he expressed
some caution on Kandi. This was true even though he maintained a (reduced) position as
a long. Unlike some of the more unrepentant bulls, Tom made sure to highlight the fact
that Kandi does have competition from some of the largest EV manufacturers in China.
Tom specifically highlighted Chery Automotive, Shandong Shifeng Group, and Hebei Yu
Jie Ma. Tom recently noted that he sold his Kandi stock as soon as it hit $7.00.


Point #1: It is inconceivable that such thorough "due diligence" from the Kandi
perma-bulls would have failed to uncover the existence of hundreds of nearly
identical competitors who have massive production capacity in China. Yet until my

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 4/30


last article, these facts were denied.


Point #2: The claim that Kandi is somehow unique ("the Tesla of China") is therefore
based on information that is 100% inaccurate. Yet this inaccurate claim has now
been made dozens of times.


Clearly the points above illustrate that there supply of EVs is far greater in China than the
Kandi bulls have stated. But of equal importance, it is also the case that demand is far
lower than the bulls have stated.


We can see that many of the bull arguments posted include the fact that China has
targeted 500,000 EVs by 2015 and 5 million by 2020. Some have cited the "10 Cities and
1,000 Vehicles" program which has been promoting EVs via subsidies in 25 cities
(including HangZhou). This program which includes subsidies has been in place since
2009.


The Kandi promoters have emphasized these impressive facts to indicate that there will
be tremendous demand for EVs in China. This information, coupled with the incorrect
information that only Kandi can supply them, has led investors to the conclusion that
Kandi will soon be worth a tremendous fortune. People who read the bullish articles on
these subjects, but who fail to do their own research, are then fully convinced. When the
articles come from multiple authors, it lends even greater credibility.


But the reality for Kandi and for the EV market in China is far different than what is being
consistently preached by the Kandi promoters. In fact, the reality is entirely consistent with
the results we see from Kandi's financial statements. It is also consistent with the share
price reactions we have seen from the few Chinese EV makers who trade on foreign
exchanges. It is also quite consistent with the unanimous view expressed by independent
media channels and Chinese automotive experts.


The only people telling us otherwise are a small number of individuals who happen to own
Kandi stock.


In July of 2013 (just 3 months ago), the WorldWatch institute put out a research piece
entitled: "China's Electric Vehicle Development Failing to Meet Ambitious Targets"


The report states clearly that



http://blogs.worldwatch.org/revolt/chinas-electric-vehicle-development-failing-to-meet-ambitious-targets/
5/22/2018 Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 5/30


Although these ambitious targets are developed and supported by the central
government, they seem overly optimistic and unattainable given the current
situation. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, only
about 20,000 new energy vehicles (EVs, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), and
PHEVs combined) were sold in 2011 and 2012, meeting only 4 percent of the 2015
target.


The current reality in China is that people aren't buying electric vehicles simply because
they don't want them. Clearly some of this is related to price. The bulls have stated clearly
that the recently announced subsidies will help that.


But the recent subsidies were actually a renewal of subsidies that have been in place for
years. During that time, and despite the subsidies, EV sales have been miniscule.


According to a report from McKinsey.


Government-sponsored subsidies have failed to stimulate consumer demand.
For example, while EV buyers in Shenzhen were offered some of the highest
subsidies in the country (e.g. RMB 120,000 per vehicle for BEV passenger cars),
automakers sold only about 600 BEVs there by 2011.


Beijing based Jack Perkowski has over two decades of experience as an expert in China's
auto industry. He formerly ran a joint venture which invested over $100 million in Chinese
auto parts JVs. In June 2013, Mr. Perkowski wrote an article in Forbes entitled "The
Reality Of Electric Cars In China".


He notes that:


recent meetings that we have had with most of China's local car assemblers confirm
that none are counting on electric vehicles for any meaningful amount of
growth anytime soon…. BYD , the poster child for electric vehicles in China, is also
de-emphasizing electric vehicles. … Due to their intellectual appeal, hype for
electric vehicles has always gotten ahead of the realities of market demand. In
China, this is once again proving to be true.


Quartz.com just put out an article last week in response to the latest Chinese subsidy
news entitled "Even the Chinese government can't command progress on electric cars".


According to Quartz:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 6/30


Beijing hasn't given up on the race to dominate electric cars. But scant sales have
turned China away from focusing on wheels on the road right now….About
three years ago, the US and China both announced ambitious aims to capture the
global electric car market by putting, respectively, 1 million and 500,000 electrified
vehicles on their roads by 2015. Today, neither country is on track to reach these
numbers-instead, the US has 130,000 electrics and China a paltry 40,000…. But
analysts doubt the renewed subsidies will finally trigger a buying binge


Those who are reading this article can feel free to completely disregard my views. After
all, I am short the stock and therefore biased. However…


Point #3 : US investors need to ask themselves why so many independent experts
such as Bloomberg, McKinsey, WorldWatch, Perkowski and Quartz, are all so
bearish on the EV market in China. Likewise, they need to ask themselves why the
only parties who are wildly bullish happen to be a small handful of investors who
also happen to own stock in Kandi?


There are a number of very common sense and logical reasons why EV sales continue to
be so poor in China. For these same reasons, most experts do not see a substantial rise
in EV sales any time soon.


Because these EV makers have competed on price, the quality of the vehicles is
undeniably very low. This should be visible from the pictures of Kandi's cars which are
available on line. The dozens of competing low speed, low priced vehicles are also nearly
identical.


The drive train for an electric vehicle is actually fairly pricey. Yet the cost of the whole
vehicle is only around $10,000. Readers need to use their common sense to decide if one
can actually manufacture a high quality automobile for just a few thousand dollars.


I recently test drove a Kandi vehicle that sold for around $10,000. It was not horrible, but
quality was clearly an issue. When I drove it, the glove box kept falling open. The windows
are old fashioned crank style windows that do not open easily. The seats vibrate a lot.
There is a loud whirring noise when driving. It is not the end of the world. But it is also not
a vehicle that many people would likely choose to drive - at any price - if they have any
alternative.


But keep in mind that Art Porcari has also test driven a Kandi car and he continues to tell
us all that Kandi is set for near term greatness. He is also long the stock and stands to
benefit from the rise in its share price.

5/22/2018 Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 7/30


Kandi, Geely and many other manufacturers have had EVs on the market for years. The
"10 Cities" program has been promoting EVs since 2009. Yet in the past two years, a
grand total of only 20,000-40,000 vehicles has been sold - by all manufacturers combined.
This is during a time when the subsidies were already in effect.


The reason why Kandi itself only sells a few hundred of these EVs is because most
people are not interested in driving such a low end vehicle. We have already seen that
cutting the price does not really boost sales when it is a product that people just don't
want. People need to keep in mind that the vehicles made by Kandi have absolutely
nothing in common with a high-end vehicle like Tesla.


A separate reason is far more practical. Anyone who has lived in China knows that
parking in any major city in China is very similar to trying to park in the middle of
Manhattan - or worse. It is extremely difficult and absurdly expensive. This should be
intuitive when one considers that the population of Beijing is over 20 million. The
population of Shanghai is over 40 million. That means that the population of Shanghai is
greater than the entire state of California - crammed into a single city. It is greater than the
population of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco Boston and Seattle -
combined! And that is just one city. Likewise, China has dozens of cities with populations
greater than 5 million.


What is the point? The point is that people who can't afford $10,000 for a car can also not
afford to drive or park a car at any price in China. Many US investors are clearly unaware
that in a country of 1.6 billion people, the vast majority of people do not live in single family
homes with an attached garage. They live in large high rise buildings which do not come
with their own garage space. If you gave them an EV for free, they would still have no
place to park it. Nowhere!


Those who can afford a home with a garage in China are typically not inclined to buy a
noisy low speed vehicle with crank windows and no amenities. Those who cannot afford a
garage have no interest in owning a car at all.


These notions are not my opinions. They are facts which are frequently expressed in the
Chinese media. One example can be found in an article entitled: "Dying for a Spot:
China's car ownership growth is driving a national parking space shortage"


Individual readers can come up with their own explanations for the very poor EV sales.
But the fact remains that there has been virtually no demand for low priced, low speed
EVs in China from consumers.

I am not saying that Kandi will not sell any vehicles. I am saying the best case scenario is
dramatically less than what the Kandi bulls are promoting. It is clear that Kandi and the
dozens of other major EV makers will hope to sell the low cost, low speed vehicles to taxi
and other public transportation systems.


WorldWatch agrees with this, saying:


As a result, more than 80 percent of the so-called "energy-saving and new-energy
vehicles" (EVs, HEVs, PHEVs, fuel cell vehicles, and other energy-saving
conventional vehicles)across the 25 pilot cities were purchased for public
transportation service rather than private use, showing a weak market demand for
these types of vehicles among private consumers.


Likewise, McKinsey shares this view, stating:


In addition, government subsidies and incentive policies have proven to be far more
effective at stimulating the purchase of EVs for public fleets than they have been at
stimulating private consumer demand.


The HangZhou agreement with Kandi was announced in 2012 but material sales have yet
to occur. At some point in time, if material sales actually materialize, this will be a good
start for Kandi. Kandi may therefore be able to sell several thousand vehicles over the
next few years. But this is categorically different than the predictions of $2 billion in sales
from Mr. Goldman or even $100 million in near term sales from Mr. Porcari.


While there may ultimately be demand for even more LSVs from various taxi and public
transport companies across China, it must also be remembered that there are potentially
hundreds of companies - with massive over capacity in production - who are vying for this
same business.


Point #4: Kandi bulls have projected massive sales figures by simply assuming that
demand is there for 100% of what Kandi can produce. Yet despite ongoing
subsidies and incentives for the past 3 years, only 20,000-40,000 EVs have been
sold across all of China by all EV makers combined.


Question: Did Kandi move due to "news" or hype ?


Whenever there is any news which applies to EVs in China, Kandi's promoters begin
trumpeting the development as being a massive catalyst for Kandi's near term profits and
share price. So far this gambit has worked well, and the share price shows sharp jumps



http://www.most.gov.cn/ztzl/kjzjbxsh/kjzjbxxnyqc/201301/t20130107_98930.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 9/30


(but which only last for a few days).


We saw this sort of hype in June when Kandi announced its inclusion on the MIIT
approved vehicle list. The problem with this news is that it applied to hundreds of other
vehicle manufacturers and thousands of other models. No other EV manufacturer saw
their stock surge even though they were included on this list too. In fact, no one else even
bothered to announce this "news" because it was a non-event. Yet Kandi's share price
quickly doubled to $8.50. It was also interesting that the official list had been published in
China weeks before Kandi chose to announce it for themselves. Kandi delayed the
promotion of this news until it was much closer to issuing $26 million in stock.


This latest "news" in September was that China had codified its subsidies for EVs. Again,
this was trumpeted as a major and transformational development for Kandi and the stock
soared to $9.20 on the back of Mr. Goldman's article. As was the case in June, this news
was released over a week earlier. Kandi did not put out a pres release on the subject until
immediately before filing a S3 covering the sale of over 1 million warrants which would
raise $5 million for Kandi.


As was the case in June, the September news applied to the entire EV market in China.
Of greater importance is the fact that these were not new subsidies at all, but instead were
just a renewal of past subsides. And in sharp contrast to the analysis from Kandi
promoters (who own Kandi stock), independent media suggested that the news was not
so great.


So what does the independent media have to say about the latest "news" ?


Bloomberg offered the following commentary on September 17th, following the
announcement of the subsidies:


The new policy is basically the same as the previous one and doesn't really
address the underlying problems," Han Weiqi, an analyst with CSC International
Holdings Ltd. in Shanghai, said yesterday in a phone interview. "Unless there are
follow-up measures to step up support for hybrids, today's policy is not expected
to spur the EV market.


A new subsidy plan has been long awaited," Ole Hui, Hong Kong-based analyst at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411), wrote in a report today. "This new plans seems
less aggressive than earlier targets.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 10/30


So how did the share prices of other EV makers respond to the news ? They certainly did
not shoot up by 50% like Kandi did. Following the release of the subsidy news, Bloomberg
noted that:


BYD Co. (1211), the maker of electric vehicles that counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) as a shareholder, fell as much as 3 percent as of 11:12 a.m.
in Hong Kong trading.SAIC Motor Corp. (600104), which began offering its Roewe
E50 electric car in November, slid as much as 1.4 percent in Shanghai.


But for the Kandi bulls, the recent "news" of Chinese subsidies was to be transformational
and would send Kandi into the stratosphere.


What is the point of this ? The point is that the facts being conveyed by a small number of
vocal Kandi bulls (who happen to own the stock) is wildly at odds with view being
expressed by the mainstream media, including Bloomberg, McKinsey, WorldWatch and
many others. The movements in the share prices of other EV makers seems to agree with
Bloomberg. Only Kandi has soared to new highs. But this sharp rise has been based on
the analysis and interpretation of this small group of individuals who profit from gains in
Kandi's stock.


Point #5: Even when news has been neutral or negative, Kandi bulls have used any
mention of EVs in China to proclaim a new, transformational tipping point for the
stock. This has consistently been at odds with the views of independent media
sources and the share price reactions of the few publicly traded Chinese EV
makers.


Conclusion


There are several realities that we must deal with in looking at Kandi.


The first reality: there are a large number of investors who simply do not even care if
Kandi has a bright and legitimate future or not. They simply know that these hyper bullish
articles have consistently been able to provide the stock with a sharp (but brief) boost.
They are happy to buy and make a quick and easy profit. But they have no intention of
waiting around to see if the hype is real. As a result, they quickly sell to lock in quick
profits. This is why Kandi has repeatedly given up its gains on each surge in 2013.


It can be easily seen on comments below articles and on message boards that various
investors are now counting much more on a continuing stream of bullish articles to pump
up the share price than they are on any actual progress from Kandi itself. This is a very

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 11/30


bad sign for any stock.


The second reality: The information which has been used to promote Kandi's share price
has often been 100% incorrect. Kandi is NOT the ONLY supplier of EVs in China, there
are hundreds of identical offerings. Demand for EVs is not astronomical. It is not even
merely substantial. The extremely and persistently low levels of demand have been cause
for concern in various independent articles and industry reports. Likewise, the latest
"news" regarding the EV industry and subsidies in China has been negative and has seen
share prices of other Chinese EV makers fall rather than skyrocket. Analysis by
independent media sources (who do not happen to own Kandi stock) have been
unanimous on this front.


But because the numerous other EV competitors in China are unknown in the US, many
US investors have come to believe that this inaccurate information is true. The fact that
multiple writers have been posting very similar (but inaccurate) information has caused
many investors to give this information even greater credence.


The fact remains that many investors who have bid up the price of Kandi by 50-100%
have done so based on information which is verifiably 100% incorrect. As they come to
appreciate this, the stock will almost certainly correct to below $5.00, from where it began.


The third reality: Kandi bears all the hallmarks of a classic stock promotion. A small
number of investors produce well timed and coordinated articles designed to generate
maximum enthusiasm for the stock. Much of the information is inaccurate. The promotion
is then coordinated with organized buying to elevate the price.


The promoters of Kandi have then set very lofty share price targets which are often
several hundred percent above the current level.


But readers need to ask themselves this: if Kandi is destined to rise to $30-50 in the near
future, then why is there such a desperate need to continue pumping the stock when it
gets down to $5.00 ? Why is there such a desperate need to defend the stock as soon as
it falls by as little as 50 cents ?


If the share price were really headed to $30-50, then the right strategy would be to simply
turn off ones computer and ignore the stock for the next 6-12 months. One could simply
ignore arguments like mine because they would truly have no impact on the share price 6
months from now. These gyrations would be just random noise over the period of a few
months.
