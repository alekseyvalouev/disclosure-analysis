Universal Display’s engineered beat and
anticipated guidance raise.


Posted on November 7, 2013 by asensio.com


Thursday, November 7, 2013.   On September 6, 2013 Goldman


Sachs issued a report announcing that Universal Display


Corporation (UDC; Trading Symbol OLED) would beat its analyst


earnings revenue and earnings estimates for the third quarter and


raise its guidance. UDC is scheduled to announce its third quarter


results after the close today. UCD’s analysts’ Consensus estimates for


this quarter are revenues of $21.8 million and an earnings per


share loss of 5 cents. Yet UDC reported revenues and earnings per


share of $49.4 million and 33 cents in the second quarter, its most


recently reported quarter. All of UDC’s sales come from the sale of


OLED products. OLED product sales rose in the third quarter. One


source estimates that sales rose 7% during UCD’s third quarter,


which it is about to announce.


UDC’s balance sheet and income statements are simple. Estimating


its revenues and earnings should be straightforward. A simple


subtraction calculation is all that is necessary to set the base case


for this coming quarter’s estimates. Simply subtracting the


contractual semiannual payments UDC received and booked in the


second quarter that will not come in the third quarter yields


straightforward estimates of revenue and earnings per share of $29


million and 3 cents and not a loss, even without taking into account


the third quarter increase in sales of OLED products.
