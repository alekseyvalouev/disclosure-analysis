CARBO Ceramics' Response To The SEC Reveals Alarming
Accounting Concerns

Summary


CARBO Ceramics' interpretation of ASC 360-10 has been highly questioned by the
SEC and may be at odds with white papers written by Ernst & Young, the company's
own auditor.


The SEC has recently required CARBO Ceramics to disclose and revise its critical
account policies for PP&E, particularly for idled and mothballed plants, to more
strictly apply to ASC 360-10-35-21.


Since receiving SEC letters, we believe the company has been gaming both the
SEC and its auditor E&Y by arbitrarily re-bucketizing assets to avoid taking a
necessary large-scale impairment charge.


The company used its aggressive accounting interpretation in order to avoid
breaching a key asset coverage covenant on its credit facility, but breached the
covenant anyway in January 2016.


CARBO Ceramics' avoidance of write-downs gives a potentially misleading picture of
its earnings power at a time when the company is raising money from equity
investors via the Cowen ATM facility.


On 6/12/15, CARBO Ceramics (NYSE:CRR) received questions from Mr. John Cash,
Accounting Branch Chief at the SEC, inquiring about certain aspects of the company's
accounting policies. Most notably to us was Mr. Cash's drill-down into CRR's asset
impairment policies for long-lived assets.

On 6/26/15, CRR responded that while it mothballed a ceramics facility in 1Q15, the
company conducted an impairment test that concluded that no impairment was necessary.
Furthermore, CRR had not updated its accounting policies since filing its 2014 10-K.

On 7/9/15, Mr. Cash responded to CRR's 6/26/15 letter. He required more disclosure on
the mothballing of CRR's McIntyre, GA, ceramics plant and required that CRR provide
disclosure differentiating between "idled" and "mothballed" facilities.

On 7/23/15, CRR responded to the SEC letter. Mr. Bautista provided new disclosure
indicating that CRR referred to "idled" facilities, as those facilities expected to remain off-
line for "well less than one year," whereas "mothballed" facilities are expected to remain
offline for "longer than one year." Furthermore, only "mothballed" facilities were subject to
impairment tests.

In the 7/30/15 third letter from the SEC, Mr. Cash's tone appears frustrated with CRR's
half answers to his questions. He writes that the company's impairment policies are still
not clear to the SEC, and thus, CRR must specifically disclose how it determines that

idling assets does not trigger impairment and also disclose the specific impairment
analyses it conducted for the mothballing of the McIntyre, GA, plant:

Finally, on 7/30/15, CRR responded that its "interim impairment analysis" of McIntyre did
not require impairment. The company further provided key assumptions for the impairment
test, which included that the asset be closed for two years and prices remain at 2015
levels, yet somehow the projected gross cash flows attributable to McIntyre "substantially
exceeded the carrying value of the assets."

In a 8/4/15 letter, the SEC requested that CRR disclose more details on its asset coverage
debt ratios. On 8/18/15, CRR responded that the company would begin disclosing asset
coverage ratios related to material debt covenants.


Finally, with the release of the 2015 10-K, CRR investors learned what all the fuss
was about: the company disclosed that it was in breach of its asset coverage ratio
as of January 2016 and was forced to cure the breach by repaying a portion of its
credit facility.

If CRR had actually taken a write-down on the McIntyre facility that was "mothballed" in
1Q15, it is likely that the company would have breached its debt covenant sooner and
been forced to renegotiate with its creditors on an accelerated basis. However, as we
discussed earlier, the company conducted an "interim impairment analysis" in which it
concluded that no impairment of McIntyre was necessary, based on the company's own
assumptions that projected gross cash flows from the facility exceeding its carrying value.
Furthermore, CRR seems to have decided that "idled" assets do not need to be tested for
impairment. In our view, delaying taking impairments may have had a material positive
benefit for CRR (in this case, at the expense of its creditors, who may have demanded
stricter credit terms from CRR earlier in 2015).


Despite the recent SEC questioning, CRR decided to get even more aggressive with its
impairment accounting going forward.


Courtesy of the SEC's demands detailed earlier, the company included in its 2015 10-K
new disclosure that "idled" facilities "are expected to remain closed for a short period of
time, generally less than one year," while "mothballed" facilities are expected to remain
closed for one year or longer," with the only distinction in accounting treatment being that
"mothballed" facilities are "evaluated for possible impairment while temporarily idled
assets are not necessarily assessed for impairment."


Also in the 2015 10-K, CRR disclosed a series of idling and restarting activities at its
Toomsboro and Millen plants. However, most significantly, it said that while the company
"mothballed" McIntyre in 1Q15, the facility was restarted at "low output levels" in 4Q15
with the plan at the time to "mothball" the facility again in the first half of 2016.


(Source: CRR 2015 10-K)


This activity begs the question: Why would CRR restart McIntyre at "low output levels"
in 4Q15 after the facility had been shuttered for the previous three quarters with the
plan to "mothball" the facility again for the first half of 2016?

(Source: CRR 10-Q and 10-K filings)


We cannot think of a valid business reason to restart a "mothballed" ceramic proppant
facility like McIntyre if (1) the ceramic proppant market was already severely oversupplied,
leading to negative gross profit at CRR in the current period, and (2) there is no near-term
increase in ceramic proppant market activity.


If there was an increase in activity, the company should have been restarting an "idled"
rather than a "mothballed" facility, per its own disclosure.


However, CRR "again idled" the Millen facility during 4Q15, while at the same time
restarting the "mothballed" McIntyre! Furthermore, it saw a decrease in activity for its
outlook. Here is CRR's outlook from the 3Q15 earnings call:


Now, I'd like to turn to our outlook. The oil and gas industry remains severely
depressed. Recent evidence points to E&P operators substantially reducing
completion activity in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, our proppant sales
volume in the fourth quarter of 2015 will likely decline significantly when compared to
the third quarter of 2015. In addition, we will see some pricing pressure in the fourth
quarter of 2015.


And here is its outlook from the 4Q15 earnings call:

Now, I'd like to turn to our outlook. The continued decline in commodity prices
creates an increasingly challenging operating environment as completion activity by
E&P operators remains very depressed. Various industry sources have estimated
that the North American rig count will likely decline by double digits in the first
quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With the lower rig count, we
expect continued pressure on our proppant sales in the first half of 2016.


In the Q&A, citing continued pressure from Chinese competition, Mr. Kolstad provided the
following additional market color (bold added for emphasis):


But we think there will still be pressure because you have a lot of people that have
shut down plants that are shut down and people that are trying to convert the
inventory to cash continue to put pressure on this. So there is still inventory out
there. The prices some people are offering, you certainly can't produce, run
plants at those prices or you burn cash. So I think the first half will be tough.


At the time, CRR was certainly burning cash. Negative gross profit was $4.6 million in
3Q15 and accelerated to negative $15.6 million in 4Q15. CRR's guidance for 1H16 was
even prescient, as CRR negative gross profit would increase to $23.6 million in 1Q16 and
$20 million in 2Q16.


So again, why did CRR restart McIntyre in 4Q15?


We can think of only one reason: to avoid an official impairment test that would be
overseen by its auditor, Ernst & Young (E&Y). Recall, the 1Q15 impairment test was only
an "interim" analysis, and auditors typically only audit annual results. By CRR's own self-
serving definition, only "mothballed" facilities needed to be tested for impairment. So, in
our view, CRR appears to have restarted McIntyre simply to avoid E&Y's scrutiny with
respect to ASC 360-10, the very same accounting rule that Mr. Cash from the SEC had
drilled into on a series of recent inquires.


Let's take a look at E&Y's specific guidance for ASC 360-10-35-21. Per E&Y, a "long-lived
asset (asset group) shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable." E&Y provided a
number of examples of events requiring tests for impairment, any one of which could
trigger an impairment test. Below are several items that we believe would trigger an
impairment test virtually every quarter for the last six quarters across each of CRR's
ceramic proppant plants, all of which would be classified as long-lived assets:

(Source: Ernst & Young)


In estimating cash flows for the purposes of performing the recovery test, E&Y states that
"the estimates should include only future cash inflows less associated cash outflows that
are directly associated with and are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and
eventual disposition of the asset."


The last time CRR generated any cash flow was in 4Q14, when the company sold 409
million pounds of ceramics. This was one quarter before it mothballed the McIntyre plant,
and at the time, utilization was 82%. Today, ceramics utilization is ~15% and pricing is
down 30%+ since 4Q14. As we reviewed CRR's outlook earlier, management does not
have a near-term forecast for materially improving volumes or ceramic price. Rather, as
was shown in the company's response to the SEC, CRR assumptions for McIntyre's
impairment test include restarting the plant 3 years from the interim impairment test date
(which would have been calendar year 2017) at 50% utilization, at ceramic pricing similar
to or lower than 2015 levels.


However, in our view, even if 50% utilization were achieved, at 2015 pricing levels,
McIntyre would be cash flow negative in 2017 (utilizing 2015 and 2016YTD historical CRR
performance as a guide). Thus, in CRR's interim impairment test in 1Q15, the company
was clearly relying on ceramic proppant conditions improving in 2018 and beyond in order
to justify that the carrying value of the asset was not impaired.


As E&Y repeatedly states, the assumptions for impairment tests "requires a significant
amount of judgement."


Our conclusions are the following:


1. As highlighted by the SEC inquiry, CRR's distinction between "idle" and "mothball"
plants appears to be fairly arbitrary, in our view. By making the "idled" versus

"mothballed" distinction, we think the company is effectively excusing itself from taking
impairment write-downs on its PP&E. However, an analysis of E&Y's ASC 360-10-35-
21 guidance does not make this distinction. Per E&Y guidance, multiple impairment
triggers appear to be met that would apply to the Toomsboro and Millen idled facilities
in addition to McIntyre. These impairment tests have likely been triggered multiple
times for each plant over the last six quarters.


2. We believe CRR's judgment in preparing cash flow estimates for the 1Q15 McIntyre
interim impairment test was inadequate. The asset should have been written down
substantially at the time to reflect the new market reality, as multiple of the impairment
conditions were met according to E&Y's interpretation of ASC 360-10-35-21. CRR
appears to be using undisclosed, overly optimistic assumptions about ceramic
proppant demand in 2018 and beyond to justify not taking large impairments.


3. Restarting McIntyre in 4Q15 with the plans to "mothball" it again served no business
purpose for CRR at the time, given poor market conditions and CRR's outlook for a
continued weak market environment. We believe that by re-bucketizing McIntyre to
"idle" instead of "mothball" status, the company may have justified that an impairment
test at its annual audit with E&Y was not required.


4. By avoiding an impairment charge in 2015, CRR may have delayed a breach in its
asset coverage ratio under its credit facility.


5. By avoiding an impairment charge in 2016 year to date, the company is
misrepresenting its financial health, in our view. While asset impairments are non-cash
charges in nature, such impairment charges do provide valuable information to both
creditors and public market equity investors. The carrying value of PP&E, as well as
tangible book value which PP&E value informs, helps shape investors' views of mid-
cycle earnings power for a cyclical company like this one. In the case of CRR, 88% of
tangible book value is PP&E as of 2Q16. Thus, by potentially overstating both PP&E
and tangible book, CRR may be misleading investors at a time when it is raising equity
through an ATM facility with Cowen.


CRR appears to be re-classifying long-term assets into categories that the company
deems do not require impairments (i.e., "idled" instead of "mothballed"), even though ASC
360-10-35-21 would otherwise require impairment tests and does not appear to make the
same distinction. Then, when an impairment test is actually required (i.e., for "mothballed"
assets ) in a formally audited setting at the end of the year, it can re-bucketize the asset to
another asset category that does not require impairment ("idled"). Furthermore, for
situations when CRR does indeed need to take an impairment test (i.e., the quarter in
which an asset is "mothballed,"), apparently it can utilize market assumptions for its assets
