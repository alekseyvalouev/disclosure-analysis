Focus Media: How To Cover A Smoking Gun With A Red Flag

Focus Media Holding Limited (NASDAQ:FMCN) has just released more details on their
theater network. In their latest 20-F filing, theater revenue is more precisely defined and is
now distinguished from the traditional billboard revenue, as far back as 2007. There is
also a theater and screen count for 2011.


Rather than resolve the issues, however, the new information raises more red flags.
Specifically, the Focus Media screen count per theater exceeds the Chinese average by a
difficult-to-believe margin.


For those readers new to the scandal, perhaps a brief recap is in order. Before Muddy
Waters Research published their report in November 2011, Focus Media's filings claimed
a network of 27,164 theaters for 2008. The problem with this was that there were only
1,545 such theaters in all of China at the time. This was proven conclusively by
referencing Chinese government statistics and widely published articles. (If you have any
doubts at all, please see the slide show: A Critical Failure in the Focus Media Story).


After the January 2012 Amended 20-F, Focus Media changed their story and claimed they
had used an old methodology which has been recently updated. This was simply untrue,
and their responses, which were submitted to the SEC, provide the final evidence that

fraudulent statements had been made. (here.)


That brings us to the present. In their latest filing, Focus Media claims ...


For our movie theater network, we leased screen time in approximately 316 movie
theaters (consisting 2,190 screens) in cities across China as of December 31, 2011.


Using the final (lots of amended filings here) 20-F documents from 2009 to 2011, we can
construct the theater count and revenue. From 2010 to 2011, the theater count grows 22%
while revenue outpaces them, growing from $18 million to over $50 million ... a 180%
increase.


Note that the theater count is more or less flat relative to the growth in revenue. How do
we account for the disproportionate leap? ... through the exponential growth in the screen
count?


316 56


2190 637


2800 803


9200 3030


As you can see below, Focus Media has more movie screens per theater in its network
than average. A lot more.

For example, Focus Media's total theater and screen counts for 2011 are disproportionate
to the average, with Focus Media at 6.9 screens per theater; China, 3.3.


In 2011, Focus Media increased its theater count by 56; it's screen count by 637. This
comes out to a ratio of over 11.4 screens per theater.


Compare this to China's growth over the same period, showing a ratio of 3.8 screens per
theater.


Of course this is a red flag for Focus Media; not a smoking gun. Claiming 27,000 theaters
in a country that had less than 1,600 ... that is a smoking gun. This is just a red flag, but
it's bright red and big.
