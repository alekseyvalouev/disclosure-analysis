CITRON SHORT TWITTER
$25 TARGET SHORT
TERM
Citron was previously bullish on TWTR in the low
$20’s.
The stock is up 50% in just two months since our
trading call.


Next! A Lot has Changed!
As previously announced we sold our long position
and are now short Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).


Alongside Facebook and Google, Twitter is now being
hauled in by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck
Grassley (R-Iowa) to a hearing on data privacy on
April 10.


Wait until the Senate finds out that:


Twitter Will Generate $400 million THIS YEAR, by
just selling user data. Not advertising.

How important is Data Licensing to
Twitter? The Scary Answer


In 2017, ad revenue declined to $2.11 billion from
$2.25 billion in the prior year while data licensing
revenue grew to $333 million from $282 million in the
prior year.


TWTR CFO Ned Segal on Q4’17 earnings call last
month that data licensing is “a really high margin
business”. TWTR generated $333 million in data
licensing revenue in 2017.


If we assume 100% margin, this segment accounts
for almost 80% of total profits.


Twitter makes this money from selling user data even
from private messages — and yes a lot of “dick picks”.
To see the underbelly of Twitter just watch this
undercover investigation done by James O’Keefe and
other Project Veritas reporters:

Dynamics Are In Place to Short Twitter


Twitter’s valuation gap with FB and GOOGL has
widened to largest spread ever. On 2018 P/E (ex-
cash), FB and GOOGL trade @ 16-17x vs. TWTR @ 50x.


Over the last year, insiders have sold/surrendered
almost $300 million of stock. The last time there was
this much insider selling was in 2015 when the stock
was $50 and then preceded to fall to $14 over the
next year.


Short interest is at all-time lows at 4.6%


Acquisition by another party is far less likely until
these companies clean house with regard to privacy
concerns and selling user data.
