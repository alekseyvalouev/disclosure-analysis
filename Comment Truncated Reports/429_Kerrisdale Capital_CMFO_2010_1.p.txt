China Marine
Food: There's
Something Fishy
Going On
Jun. 1, 2010 9:27 AM ET16 comments | Includes: CMFO, C…


Please read the disclosures at the bottom of this article.


In my previous two articles, I’ve written about how several Seeking Alpha
contributors have used locally filed Chinese financial statements to provide
compelling evidence that certain U.S.-listed Chinese companies may be frauds.


All foreign-invested enterprises must file financial statements with the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce branch of the Chinese government.
These documents are not available electronically; rather, a local Chinese
citizen must go to the appropriate local branch to access these documents.
Fortunately, certain third-party credit agencies provide this service to
foreigners for a fee.


In previous articles, I compared the SAIC and SEC financial statements of
YUII, CSKI and LIWA. The numbers for YUII matched, whereas they did not for
CSKI and LIWA.


In this post, I compare the SAIC and SEC financial statements for China
Marine Food Group Limited (NYSEMKT:CMFO). The numbers do not match.


This provides evidence that China Marine Food Group Limited may be a fraud.
In addition, I note additional data points that raise questions about whether
CMFO’s financial statements accurately represent the financial condition of the
underlying business.


I also present the response of the chief financial officer of CMFO to a question
on why the SAIC and SEC documents don’t match, and provide my opinion on
his response.

Organizational Structure


Before discussing CMFO’s SAIC statements, let’s discuss the legal
organizational structure of CMFO. This is important because each subsidiary
files separate SAIC financial statements. Chinese GAAP does not consolidate
subsidiaries, and therefore it’s important to determine which subsidiary
generates most of the company’s revenue. We can then compare the SAIC
financial statements of this main operating subsidiary with the SEC filings.


Here is CMFO’s legal organizational structure, from an annual report. We use
the 2008 org structure, because we are comparing their 2006, 2007 and 2008
financials. 2009 SAIC filings are typically not filed until midyear. 





 
 
 
The U.S.-based, publicly listed entity is China Marine Food Group Limited. Nice
Enterprise Trading H.K. Co., Limited, its subsidiary, is based out of Hong Kong.
Nice Enterprise has one subsidiary, Shishi Rixiang Marine Foods Co., Ltd
(“Rixiang”), which is based out of China. Rixiang is a foreign invested
enterprise that owns two other subsidiaries: (1) Shishi Huabao Mingxiang

Foods Co., Ltd. (“Mingxiang”)and (2) Shishi Huabao Jixiang Water Products Co.
Ltd (“Jixiang”).
Where are the operations primarily held? Rixiang. We know this by the
following disclosures in the 10K:


"With effect from January 1, 2005, Rixiang acquired the business operations of
Mingxiang, which subsequently became a property holding company. Rixiang
was incorporated as a FIE and was granted the tax incentives for FIEs, and
was exempted from income tax for 2005 and 2006... Jixiang is also a property
holding company and is not subject to tax."


Elsewhere throughout the report, the Company also makes clear that Rixiang
generates all of the Company's operating revenue, such as "All of our
production is undertaken by our subsidiary, Rixiang" in the "Our Products"
section.


From the above disclosure, we also know that Rixiang is an FIE. As an FIE,
Rixiang must file accurate annual financial statements with the Administration
for Industry and Commerce branch of the Chinese government.


SAIC vs. SEC financial statements


I have had a local third-party credit agency go to the local AIC office in
Rixiang’s jurisdiction and photocopy their financial statements.


They are here, in Chinese. And here, translated in English.


The figures in the attached documents are in Remnimbi. In the chart below,
we convert the Remnimbi to US dollars, and compare key financial line items
with CMFO’s SEC financials:

As we can see, CMFO reports much higher numbers in its SEC filings than its
SAIC filings. In its SAIC filings, the company generated only $2mm of revenue
in 2007 and $7mm in 2008. In its SEC filings, it allegedly generated $36mm in
2007 and $49mm in 2008.
Compare that with Yuhe, which generated $21mm and $34mm of revenue in
2007 and 2008 in its SAIC filings, compared to $22mm and $36mm of revenue
in 2007 and 2008 in its SEC filings.


As we discussed earlier, Rixiang is the primary operating subsidiary of CMFO. It
is also an FIE. As a result, Rixiang’s financial statements should accurately
reflect CMFO’s SEC financial statements.


But they don’t.


The CMFO’s response to the discrepancies is the following, based on an email:

"It's a formality in China to file the operating figures with SAIC on an annual
basis. We used to hire an independent agent firm to do the filing on our behalf
as the process itself is quite tedious though. Guess the agent firm has used
kinds of outdated figures to do the filing and thus discrepancies appeared as a
result.


Since there won't be any anticipated influence or harm over those inaccurate
historical figures with SAIC, we don’t believe it’s necessary to re-file the
statements. That said, we will switch to another sizeable agent firm to do the
2009 filing and will make sure the numbers so filed are consistent with our
book record going forward."


We’ve been down this road with CSKI. The CFO of CSKI said a similar thing in
2009 when asked why CSKI’s SAIC numbers didn’t match the SEC numbers.
We have yet to see matching financial statements.


What is actually going on? My belief is that CMFO is fabricating its SEC
financial statements. FIEs in China must file accurate audited financial
statements. I’ve spoken with dozens of accountants and CFOs of verifiably
legitimate Chinese companies, and they have all confirmed this. It’s
understandable to have small differences between SAIC and SEC filings, due to
subsidiary consolidation and Chinese vs US GAAP. But CMFO’s 2008 SAIC
revenue was 85% lower than its 2008 SEC revenue. That’s not due to GAAP
accounting differences.


In my opinion, fraudulent Chinese companies like CSKI and CMFO are making
up numbers out of thin air. To fool their accountants, the companies are using
sophisticated and undisclosed related party and off-balance sheet transactions
to inflate financial statements. They are using phony bank statements to fake
cash. It’s unclear how exactly they are doing it. But the differences between
the SAIC and SEC numbers provides compelling evidence that they are finding
a way to do it. After all, there is a lot of money to be made – companies like
CSKI and CMFO have raised $25mm+ each in secondary equity offerings or
private placements, all for dubious purposes. If they are indeed fraudulent,
these funds are likely being siphoned to a large degree to personal bank
accounts.

These are shocking allegations, yes. But the world of Chinese reverse-merger
smallcaps is a shocking one, and given the very low valuation multiples, it’s
clear that many other investors suspect similar wrongdoings.


Other Signs that CMFO is a Fraud


The main thrust of our argument that CMFO is a fraud is that the Company’s
SAIC and SEC filings don’t match. But as we did with our two posts on YUII,
CSKI and LIWA, we’re going to highlight other signs that make us concerned
about trusting CMFO’s SEC financial statements.


Again, we’ll compare CMFO with YUII.


 
Audit history


In our last post, we explained that Yuhe’s attempt to upgrade to Grant
Thornton was a welcome contrast to the audit history of many other Chinese
companies that have gone public via reverse mergers.


CMFO’s auditor, ZYCPA Company Ltd., is equally as questionable as LIWA’s and
CSKI’s auditors. It is not listed in the top 100 global audit firms. It has 2
partners and 25 personnel, per its web site. Given that CMFO alleges to have
generated $70mm of revenue and $15mm of net income in 2009, ZYCPA
appears to be a woefully inadequate auditor for the company.


If CMFO is making up its numbers, it would certainly find an easier time
defrauding one of the two partners at ZYCPA than a top-5 audit firm like Grant
Thornton.


 
Capital Raise


As we discussed in our last post, a key thing to monitor when examining
whether reverse-merger Chinese companies are frauds is to see how much
capital they’ve raised via secondary private placements and equity offerings.


Naturally, we have no issue with capital raises. Companies need to raise funds
to grow. But with Chinese companies that have gone public through reverse
mergers, we see a tendency to raise large sums of money at large discounts to
current stock prices, with dilutive warrants attached, and for dubious
