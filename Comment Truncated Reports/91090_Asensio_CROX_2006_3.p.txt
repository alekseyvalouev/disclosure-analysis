CROX faces Skecher’s


competition. Kohl’s sees


plastic-clogs as passé.


Skechers USA, Inc. (NYSE: SKX, $24.82) is now selling a plastic


clog-like shoe named the “Waterbug” that is almost identical


to the Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX, $25.22) plastic clog-like


shoe. Skechers is also selling the “Ladybug”, which is a


children’s size plastic-clog.


Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS, $53.16) department stores


are not carrying the Crocs brand of plastic clog-like shoes,


initially due to Croc’s low pro�t margins. Now Kohl’s has


opted to also pass on Skechers Waterbug. Kohl’s shoe


buyers, who are responsible for approximately $1.1 billion


annual shoe sales, believe that the plastic clog-like shoe is a


fading fad.


Skechers, the maker of the Waterbug, has a market value of


approximately $910.3 million. Skechers had sales of $1


billion and net income of $44 million in 2005. Meanwhile,


CROX had sales of just $108 million in 2005 and has a market


value of approximately $958.3 million.
