Dropbox is the classic SaaS on SaaS disruption tale worth studying closely in this
environment.


The 'new' Dropbox raises very serious questions about the company's future.


Pricing power has been a lever, but at what cost?


Stock looks like a value SaaS, but really might be huge value trap.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, The Razor's Edge. Get started today »


Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) recently announced 'the new Dropbox'. Here is a link to the
video which everyone investing in cloud/SaaS space must watch. But before I discuss
the new Dropbox, a little financial snapshot of what's going on with the company is
needed.

Dropbox currently trades at a TTM EV/revenue multiple of 8.8x. They have non-GAAP
operating margins of 11% and have provided 2019 revenue guidance of 17% growth
and FCF margin guidance of around 28%. Now, I wouldn't call the stock cheap based on
these numbers, but relatively speaking in this bubbly SaaS tape, it almost looks like a
value play.


So, what gives?


Here are Dropbox's key operating metrics:


2015 2016 2017 2018


Revenue 604 845 1107 1397


40% 31% 26%


Paid Users 6.5 8.8 11 12.7


35% 25% 15%


ARPU $113.5 $110.5 $111.9 $117.6


On the surface, these metrics look okay, but there is some cause for concern here.
Dropbox's trailing revenue growth of 31% at IPO listing was organically-driven. That
changed drastically in their first year as a public company. Paid user growth trends are
going in the wrong direction pretty quickly, and 15% for 2018 and 13.7% for the most
recent quarter is definitely enough to warrant being viewed as a 'discount' multiple in this
tape. When viewed within the context of Dropbox's recent business decisions, the trend
in operating metrics gets a lot more interesting.


Dropbox has made three notable business moves in the past couple of months:


Unlimited device linking on the free Basic tier was replaced with a three device limit as
of March 2019. Basically, going forward, if you need more than 3 devices, you need to
upgrade to at least the paid $9.99 a month ($99 a year) Plus tier. Effective June 2019,
Dropbox raised pricing on the Plus tier by 20%. They upped the plan from 1tb to 2tb of
storage and raised the cost to $11.99 ($119.99 a year) a month. They announced the
new Dropbox in early June of 2019.

Dropbox: A history lesson


These are actually some very bold moves, and to appreciate how bold (super-risky
would be another term), you need to dig deep into the Dropbox story.


2008-2014: The Cinderella Story Years


In many respects, Dropbox is the original SaaS 2.0 company. From an MIT dorm room
to Y Combinator alum, when they launched at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2008, few people
could have envisioned how big of a problem they were solving. The launch didn't go
smoothly as WiFi issues got in the way, and Yammer ended up winning that event as the
judges grilled them on Apple (AAPL)/Microsoft (MSFT)/Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) etc.
risks. Yeah, that was a concern in 2008, but Dropbox's CEO stuck to his guns and
reminded the judges that, despite all the tech giants' resources, his small team had
cracked this difficult problem first. According to the CEO, Dropbox wasn't trying to
change the way you work, but rather was providing something with speed and ease of
use to hit all your major pain points. And, he was right! Dropbox was a perfectly-timed
product. A super FRICTIONLESS file-sharing multi-device syncing application for a
world no longer dominated by Windows. The explosion of the Apple/Android device
ecosystem virtually ensured Dropbox success as a collaboration tool. With the big three
not ready to play nice with each other, Dropbox had to simply be Switzerland to win. And
win they did….


In less than 3 years, Dropbox had 100 million users. Steve Jobs made an offer to
acquire them in 2011. Dropbox's CEO passed. By the end of 2014, Dropbox had 300
million users and a $10 billion valuation. That was peak Dropbox.


2015: Dropbox Doomsayers Arrive


I remember 2015 well as the point that startup mania valuation concerns started to
emerge in tech, and no company was more discussed than Dropbox. The market now
had ten proper decacorns, and skeptics were trying to predict the first to fall. Dropbox
was always at the top of the list, and for good reason. The landscape had started to
shift.

While iCloud had launched in October of 2011 and Google Drive in April of 2012, both
took some time to get to critical mass. Sure, they slowed Dropbox's growth some, but
the lack of interoperability amongst the big three ecosystems remained an issue. It
wasn't really until 2015 that this started to change with the first notable move being
Office allowing users to save files on iCloud. This notable move, combined with the
growing scale of these services and commodity pressure they were exerting on storage
pricing, was enough to get investors talking about Dropbox's $10bl valuation problem.
Make no mistake, Dropbox was still the dominant frictionless tool in the market, but they
had so far shown little evidence of an ability to diversify their offering enough to
dissuade concerns on the closing gap in file storage. And, it's not like Dropbox was not
trying to address this issue. After Drew Houston had turned down Steve Jobs nine-figure
acquisition offer, Jobs had famously told him Dropbox was a "feature not a product" and
that he was going to have to kill it. So, Dropbox management had a very good reason to
be paranoid and try to expand their offering. And try they did…


In 2013, they acquired Orchestra (est $100ml), the creators of Mailbox, a super-hyped
mobile app with a clever approach to organizing email on the go. But despite all the
hype and long wait lists, Mailbox never took off. Dropbox shuttered the app at the end of
2015. This is the explanation they provided…


"Over the past year and a half, we've learned the vast majority of our users prefer the
convenience and simplicity of interacting with their photos directly inside of Dropbox."


Of course, the reality of the situation was in the time in between the Mailbox acquisition
and this announcement, Gmail and Outlook's mobile clients adopted the same type of
UX approach.


In March of 2014, they acquired workplace chat app Zulip. A little over a year later, they
relaunched it as an open source project.


In April of 2014, they bought Hackpad a note-taking collaboration tool that was seeking
to compete with Evernote. They open-sourced it a year later and started testing their
own proprietary Dropbox Notes app which would eventually become a part of Dropbox
paper. In 2017, Hackpad was discontinued.


In June of 2014, they acquired another aspiring workplace chat tool named Droptalk.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275737-upon-time-in-tech-dropbox-edition 5/22


Here is fitting excerpt from the blog post by the Droptalk team announcing that
acquisition.


"Droptalk joins Dropbox!


We are thrilled to announce that today Droptalk will be joining Dropbox. About a year
ago we set out to end the unnecessary friction around communication and
collaboration by killing "the work email." The world deserves a better way to do
business and an integrated sharing product, which our team rapidly created is the
answer."


I couldn't find much detail on what happened with Droptalk, but it seems the team was
folded into the Paper project as Slack (WORK) exploded onto the scene and Dropbox's
workplace chat strategy hit a wall.


Anyway, as you can see, there was no shortage of material for Dropbox skeptics by
2015. They were trying to expand their offering and making little progress. This does not
mean the likes of HipChat or Evernote were necessarily doing something right to fend
off Dropbox's ambitions, but rather the strategy of consolidating a collaboration
productivity suite around the feature of file sharing wasn't necessarily working. Still, most
Dropbox critics focused on the increasing threat from the big three, and less on their
failures elsewhere. But one Dropbox doomsayer did make a very compelling case
against Dropbox based entirely on Slack.


In article titled, Dropbox: The First Dead Decacorn, startup founder Alex Danco, laid out
a brilliant argument:


"So who will be the first Decacorn to fall? My bet is Dropbox. But not - as has been
the worry for years - because of Google Drive, or Skydrive, or any cloud-hosted file
storage solutions at all. As we've seen before, it isn't your direct competitors that are
the scariest.


Dropbox will die at the hands of Slack.

But did Slack really kill Dropbox?


You may not have considered Dropbox and Slack to be competitors, because they're
not - in the typical sense. In fact, 'We integrate with all the services you use already,
like Dropbox' was part of Slack's pitch early on. That's because Slack and Dropbox
aren't really peers: they're neighbours along the workplace stack:


To me, Slack feels like the first truly internet and mobile-native productivity platform -
especially as it expands beyond messaging and into workflow automation, helper
bots, and who knows what else. Dropbox might be the pinnacle of file management,
but Slack is the beginning of what comes next.


Basically, in the author's view, Slack is a collaboration integration platform that ultimately
makes Dropbox obsolete. And, from a business enterprise sense, I think he's clearly
been proven right. (Interestingly enough, the author ended up joining notable Slack
investor Social Capital a few months after this post)

Nearly four years have passed since this article was written and Dropbox is still hovering
around its $10bl valuation. In an absolute sense, that's a victory, it definitely isn't dead
(yet). However, relatively speaking, one simply needs to look at the rest of collab
software to appreciate the argument. In the same time period, Atlassian (TEAM) went
from $5bl to $33bl. Microsoft from $300bl to a $1 trillion. And, Slack from a billion to
$20bl.


What Slack has clearly done well is essentially limit Dropbox's enterprise collaboration
ambitions. Dropbox never launched a pure play workplace chat app. It appears
management made a decision in 2015 to try and thwart Slack by open sourcing Zulip vs.
directly competing, but they never really went all in on this. Today, Zulip exists as a
Kandra labs-backed commercial open source alternative to Slack for both hosted and
on-premise deployments. It's got a niche though on-premise focused (and now ironically
Ycombinator backed) Mattermost seems to have exploited that opportunity better.


Dropbox has survived thus far because frictionless file sharing and device syncing has
proved far stickier than expected. This stickiness has bought management time to
continually try and evolve their offering. Dropbox Paper was the next big bet made by
management in that evolutionary process. Officially launched in January 2017, Paper
was Dropbox's first full-fledged attempt at creating a document creation/collaboration
tool for their existing user base.

For those of you who have never played around with Paper, it is somewhat of a unique
tool. Clearly aiming for simplicity, Paper lives up to its name. It is essentially like one
long continuous sheet of paper for users to create and share content in. I actually played
around with it quite a bit when it launched as you can embed just about anything media
wise in its actual form within the document. Also, the linking preview function between
documents is pretty cool. And it seems Paper did find some appeal amongst designers
with its related integration with Invision, Sketch, Figma, and Framer. My favorite part
really has been the simplicity with which you can clip videos into one document and mix
in slides and written content if you are trying to make a pitch. It hits a pain point in
PowerPoint that I have always found limiting. But like most things Dropbox has tried, it
doesn't completely crack the problem. You can't turn the sheet into an organized slide
show. And despite the time line elements, linking previews, commenting, sharing etc., I
eventually stopped using it.


Why?


"At Paper teams can create, review, organize content in a flexible work space…..it's
one part online document, one part collaboration, one part task management tool,
one part content hub."

Meet The New Dropbox


- Rob Baesman, Dropbox Head of Product


Paper's biggest problem, as far as I was concerned, was that in trying to 'organize
content into a flexible work space' it actually didn't end up doing anything exceptionally
well. Like the word processing element of the application didn't need to be Word, but it
also didn't need to be one font with a few sizes and headers and no spell-check. Also,
while I'm not taking app power user, I couldn't see how anyone would favor this over the
popular note taking tools. As for the collaboration/project management element, there
simply are better tools focused on the space. So, really I got the feel Paper was trying to
take on Office/Docs without actually taking them on. Like the rich media integration
element in a content creation application was the most differentiating feature. Simply
focusing on building a true presentation application around that would have made me
happy. But look this is just my personal user experience take. You can argue that the
they want the word processing element to be bare bones because they believe it should
be deemphasized. Which is fine if you've managed to do one thing exceptionally well
that I just can't live without, but then again, reinventing stuff like that at this point is
tough. There are plenty of other wide-ranging views on Paper's issues. From it being a
Medium/Google Docs, a Quip with a better designer, a twist on Confluence, and many
more other opinionated views. Whatever the criticism, the overall consensus at this point
is Paper missed the mark. Of course, that mark for Dropbox is the big problem. It's the
12bl EV company mark and not the nice little potential 200-500ml niche software tool
maker mark. Like I think if Paper was a standalone product it has a niche group of
power users, and if focused on properly maybe monetizes by pricing that right. But
Paper being developed as a solution for the mass Dropbox user to engage more with
the product doesn't resonate. At which point one has to wonder how long Dropbox,
which has now developed a long history of shuttering their experiments, sticks with it.
Which brings us to today...

The new Dropbox, which was officially launched on June 11th, is a collaboration
workspace. (I strongly recommend everyone stop reading here and watch the new
Dropbox video before continuing because words can't replace that experience as far as I
am concerned.)


This is all in bet on Dropbox evolving into the central nervous system for team content
creation and collaboration. The goal appears to be to make sure you never have to
leave Dropbox to get any of your work done. Office/Google Docs content can be
launched from within the App. Team comments and notification tracked inside the app.
And naturally highly touted integrations with the super hip collaboration darlings of today
in Slack/Zoom/Atlassian. Sharing to Slack or starting a Zoom call can all be done
straight from inside the app. The goal appears to be becoming Windows for the Cloud
Collaboration business world. And to be frank, in typical, Dropbox fashion the design
and UX are pretty slick.


But will it work?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275737-upon-time-in-tech-dropbox-edition 11/22


The knee-jerk answer here is no. This is because the new Dropbox is aiming to be a
business cloud collab OS over essentially some sort of new application, and to win in a
battle like that, you need a massive business install base to spring something like this
on. Dropbox is basically going the integration as a platform cloud collaboration route
here as this has been the strong suite for the likes of Slack/Zoom, but it just feels like it's
too late. Like what's the benefit of me being able to one click share something into Slack
if you're already going to notify me when a team member commented on some project
task or made some file change? Those notifications seem like an awful lot of added
noise to an already noisy environment for a product whose pitch is noise reduction and
simplification.


And these changes are coming at a cost. That cost being Dropbox's main existing
strength. When you decide to focus on expanding functionality, well you also are taking
on friction. This non-stop back and forth between being super frictionless and providing
functionality is a tricky balancing act in the collaboration space. Jobs may have been
right about Dropbox maybe being nothing more than feature, but it's a super frictionless
one its core base has always loved.


Now you have these types of reactions…

The new Dropbox highlights that you can work on Google Docs from right within the
app, but it turns out to allow that to happen your browser needs to enable cross-site
tracking. So, seamless integration here actually leads to slowing down something that
was celebrated for being frictionless.


And here is Dropbox's response to this issue:


"Unfortunately, many browsers don't offer an option to enable cross-site tracking for
just a specific integration. When that is the case, users can not give permission to
specific cross-site integrations. It's all or nothing and we agree there should be more
granular permissions for users. Of note, Firefox and Chrome do allow white-listing of
specific sites when enabling cross-site tracking. An alternative would be to use our
new shortcuts feature to create links to your Google Docs, Sheets and Slides within
Google Drive. Shortcuts don't involve cross-site tracking."

So, back to linking for an app that is selling you on not having to leave it. Clearly, this is
not going over as smoothly as expected. Then, you have the price increase element…

Dropbox USA's price increase on Plus is 20%. Some Australian users have posted 54%
increases, and in Canada some have shared 45% increases (I looked into this and
according to Dropbox on the Community Support it's a limited amount of users on
legacy pricing being hit with these outsized increases). Regardless it would appear the
aim here is to bring Plus, which I estimate at about 65% of total paid users, to a global
average around $120 USD a year. Customers are not happy obviously and you can get
on Reddit, Twitter, or threads like these to see the countless cancellation posts.


Which raises the question what is management thinking? They obviously have done
their homework and have access to plenty of usage data as well as external consultant
analysis. Raising prices on the popular individual plan tier as you reinvent your app with
a business team focus seems a bit odd timing wise. Or is it?


The device cap limit on free users is a logical move here to try and boost paid
conversions. If you have ten devices on Dropbox and are paying nothing, your hand is
now being forced. The minute you upgrade a single device you need to get down to that
three-device limit or move to a paid plan. At this point, a heavy device user whose still
not paying is not worth the cost to Dropbox if this won't convert them. So, worst case
scenario maybe you get some revenue out of this move by forcing some hands in the
free power user base.


Then you have the iCloud problem. Shared folders are coming to iCloud drive with iOS
13 and macOS Catalina in the fall, and Apple is now providing the same files API for
Windows that is used across its own devices. It's no secret that Dropbox has thrived off
the rise of Apple ecosystem. The iPad probably wouldn't have taken off as quickly as it
did if so many people couldn't use Dropbox to write on the iPad. Thus, I assume
management expects this new iCloud update to cause some churn and is getting out in
front of it.


Users are clearly aware of this…..

And for some, the new Dropbox seems to be a reason to take super late to the game
Apple a lot more seriously now…


One thing is for certain, Dropbox management knows that, for most people, cancelling
Dropbox is a painful exercise. They are banking on that not changing much, but it's
possible they have miscalculated. The web is currently littered with blog posts of users
venting on all this, one particular article did stand out. The article is aptly titled," How I
Dropped Dropbox", here is fantastic excerpt from it:


"Of course, part of the reason I stuck with it for so long was because the prospect of
untangling Dropbox from my life had daunted me for years. That's the genius of
services like these; at first you think you're just buying storage, but little by little it
finds its way into everything you use.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275737-upon-time-in-tech-dropbox-edition 18/22


The only way to kick a habit though is to start kicking it. I logged into the Dropbox site
and then opened the "Connected Apps" section of my settings screen. That displayed
a list of over three dozen apps and services that I had hooked into the service over
the past decade or so of usage. That's when I realized that surprisingly few of them
actually seemed all that critical anymore, if they ever even were. Many of them I
hadn't used in ages, and most others could easily be replaced by iCloud Drive. A very
few would be difficult to use without Dropbox, but I realized that the actual storage
they required was effectively de minimis and that they could easily reside on
Dropbox's free tier, if necessary.


As with any file system in continual use for nearly a decade, my Dropbox account had
accumulated a ton of cruft. All in all, it took me three weeks of persistent pruning, bit
by bit, to whittle it down from nearly a terabyte to just seventy-eight megabytes. It was
annoying, and not at all the way I wanted to spend even a little bit of my life, but then
again I had a very nice feeling of satisfaction when I was able to cancel the pending
auto-renewal of my Dropbox account, which was set to happen this coming week.


More to the point, disconnecting from Dropbox was time consuming, but it wasn't
difficult. Which is to say that although the process was high friction it was relatively
straightforward, and not at all technically challenging. At the outset I had expected
that switching away from Dropbox would break many parts of my workflow; in
practice, very little of it has been disturbed at all, even though the iCloud Drive
features that are ostensibly allowing me to switch are still in beta. I'm certainly not
extolling the virtues of leaving Dropbox if you find it indispensable in your own work-
it's still the best option if you need to share files across non-Apple platforms. But the
relative ease with which I was able to leave it illustrates well Steve Jobs' famous
criticism that Dropbox is a feature, not a product. We often mistakenly believe that

So, Should Investors Short Dropbox?


Leaving Dropbox for most people is tantamount to a major decluttering/deep cleaning
exercise. It's just something that you tend to put off until you have been forced into it, but
then, after you do, it you feel a sense of relief. I think an extra $20 a year at this point is
not enough of a reason (somewhat more debatable though as Dropbox was still
relatively expensive cloud storage before the hike) for most people to migrate off,
Dropbox because the core service has been reliable. However, the new Dropbox
introduces performance elements at the expense of the loyal core consumer user base
that might just be enough to get a lot more users than management is expecting to
finally proactively address their cloud storage tools/expenses in a manner that reflects
the landscape changes of the last several years.


Despite all I have written, the answer to this question is a bit more complicated than one
would expect. Dropbox's last earnings report preceded all these moves, and to be frank,
it wasn't very hard to make a relative value case for the stock then. The combination of
28% FCF margins with their 17% top-line guide wasn't exactly a jump off the page short
at the 6x EV/2019 EST Rev multiple it was trading at then. The slowing growth picture
was something that was being priced into the stock for sure, and simply executing on
that guide without any notable surprises for the year I think made the name potentially
appealing to some as a value SaaS long in this tape. But these price changes combined
with the new Dropbox launch and iCloud Drive looming folder sharing update have
muddied the waters considerably. Like, at this point, you have some important questions
to answer, and this on the back of a 25% rally in the shares over the past 3 months. Is
Dropbox value SaaS or a massive value TRAP?


One place to start is by trying to determine how much pricing is factored into their
current guidance?

The Plus price hike essentially starts kicking on billing cycle renewals starting in Q3 and
continuing through Q2 of 2020. Doing the math based on the Plus plan share of total
users and factoring some downgrades from professional, you are looking at 2-3% of
quarterly pricing as this works through. This is basically a follow-through on the pre-IPO
plan when they introduced Advanced Business with a 60% hike with 'unlimited storage'
and limited storage on standard business. That was launched early 2017 and the pricing
was left to kick in starting in Q2 2018 to boos metrics ahead of IPO. This tailwind rolls of
in Q2 and now set to be mitigated some by the Plus hike. The thing that is a bit
perplexing is user growth estimates going forward look way too bullish. Between the
backlash on Plus for individuals, Apple's iCloud update, the ETR survey data on
business intentions in Global 2000 for H2 2019 with respect to Dropbox, and general
trends in cloud collaboration software; I can't see how net adds don't start to drop a
faster clip due to higher churn. So, I think it's pretty clear Dropbox guidance is counting
on pricing to mitigate paid user trends.


This is pretty reflective of the difficult spot the company is at today. I often see people
posting why doesn't Dropbox offer a lower priced tier for individuals. Like a value 200gb
or 500gb option somewhat on par with the cloud giants? Surely, so many free users
would go for that right? Wrong. Dropbox doesn't disclose avg storage usage metrics for
Plus subscribers, but I think it's safe to say an overwhelming majority of them would fit
on a 500gb plan. You need to simply model the mix between Plus and Professional to
get that. So, adding an extra 1tb to Plus costs Dropbox pretty much nothing as the
aggregate user base on Plus is far below a 1tb avg. Introducing a lower tier between
2gb free and $120 a year 2tb Plus would actually reduce revenue as far more Plus
users would downgrade than the amount of free user upgrades. And your cost of goods
sold would basically remain constant thus hitting margins hard.

Also, as I previously mentioned, the raw data on Dropbox's enterprise ambitions doesn't
exactly look good. ETR just shared 2H2019 Technology Spending Intentions Survey
data on the productivity applications sector. With over 900 CIOs in the Fortune 2000
reporting, no application in the report scored worse than Dropbox. Of the 17 productivity
applications they shared data on, Dropbox was one of only three with a negative H2
2019 reported net spending intentions score, and at -17% by the far the worst.
Respondents indicating a decrease/replace intention for Dropbox in H2 2019 were 44%
for July which is up from 33% in April.


Put this altogether and Dropbox upcoming earnings report which looked like a non-event
a few months ago now should be a heck of a lot more eventful. You also have buyout
rumors on the name making the rounds for the first time since last summer. I have to
say I'm a bit skeptical. The name being tossed around lately is Microsoft, which just
makes little sense. I've seen both a value driven case and one on Microsoft wanting the
free user base. Both arguments are not compelling. Microsoft has been making strategic
moves that are product and pro growth oriented. Yea, Dropbox has some decent
revenue, but the organic picture going forward doesn't look good. And really if your
buying something like this the FCF that's coming from stock comp is not something you
are going to get excited about. As for the users, Microsoft has LinkedIn and Office. They
don't need to buy reach. Dropbox's free users likely one way or another touch the
Microsoft ecosystem, so they don't need to be 'acquired'. The same goes for Apple,
Google, Facebook (FB), and other giants. The value to those players in Dropbox's free
user base would come from shutting Dropbox down.
