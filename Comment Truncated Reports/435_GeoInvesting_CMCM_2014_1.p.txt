Cheetah Mobile 9 CMCM) –
A Potential Impaling Blow
To Cheetah Mobile As
Flagship Product Removed
From Google’s App Store
Rankings
July 31, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary


CMCM’s flagship Clean Master app was removed from
Google Play’s top free app rankings, calling into
question growth in its highly touted large overseas
user base and future monetization potential.
Outside of China, daily downloads from Google Play of
CMCM’s six apps have fallen by approximately 88%
following Google’s removal of Clean Master from the
rankings.
Management has not alerted investors to these
negative developments that occurred since July 15,
2014, raising a significant corporate governance issue.
There is a risk that the Clean Master app may be
kicked out of the Google Play store if violations of
store policies are not mitigated and resolved.
Given the current undisclosed significant business
risk, CMCM’s current valuation premium over QIHU is
entirely unwarranted and we believe the stock is
worth between $7.00 and $9.00.

Master manipulate Android users with deceptive

Google Jeopardizes CMCM’s Investment Thesis For
Overseas User Monetization


Cheetah Mobile (CMCM) has seen strong performance since
its May 8, 2014, IPO at $14 per ADS, due to its top-ranked
Clean Master app and large user base outside China. In its
F-1 filing, Clean Master is described as providing junk-file
cleaning, memory boosting and privacy-protection
capabilities. According to App Annie, an app store analytics
and market intelligence provider, Clean Master was the
number one ranked application in the Tools category on
Google Play by worldwide monthly downloads in March
2014. It was also the number two ranked mobile utility
application in China in terms of monthly active users in
February 2014, according to iResearch (a third party
market research firm). The Clean Master app is the flagship
product for CMCM and the company distinguishes itself
from other China-based mobile utility app developers in its
overseas growth potential, citing App Annie metrics in its
SEC filings.


According to CMCM’s F-1 filing, “Clean Master” represents
over 35% of its app downloads and is an integral part of
CMCM’s future revenue model. The widespread usage and
monetization of CMCM’s mobile apps is the key to
generating future revenues.


We are not alone in our interpretation of how important
mobile users and Google are to CMCM. Analysts have
based bullish forecasts on CMCM’s ability to generate
growth and eventual monetization of mobile users outside
of China.

In its F-1, CMCM cites the risk of any failure to expand its
user base:


“If we fail to retain or grow our user base, or if
our users decrease their engagement with our
mission critical applications, our business,
financial condition and results of operations
would be materially and adversely affected.”


CMCM’s compliance with Google’s policies is critical, per the
F-1:


“We expect a substantial number of downloads of
our mobile applications will continue to be
derived from these distribution channels. As
such, the promotion, distribution and operation
of our applications are subject to such
distribution platforms’ standard terms and
policies for application developers, which are
subject to the interpretation of, and frequent
changes by, these distribution channels. If
Google Play, iOS App Store or any of the major
distribution channels change their standard terms
and conditions in a manner that is detrimental to
us, or terminate their existing relationship with
us, our business, financial condition and results
of operations may be materially and adversely
affected.”


As of July 15, 2014, the Clean Master App Was
Dropped Off Google Play Rankings


By encouraging users to uninstall Google Chrome and
replace it with CMCM’s own browser during Clean Master’s
“clean-up” and “optimization” process, CMCM appears to
have now upset Google, leading Google to crack down on

this rogue practice which allowed app developers like
CMCM to gain an unfair position in the marketplace.


App Annie Shows a Huge Decline in Daily Downloads
of CMCM Apps Following the Removal of Clean Master
from the Google Play Store Rankings


Data from App Annie shows a worldwide decline (excluding
China, where Google Play is blocked) in CMCM app
downloads from around 800,000 downloads per day to
less than 100,000 downloads per day following the July
15, 2014 removal of Clean Master from the Google Play
store rankings- a decrease of over 87.5%! (Note: The App
Annie chart showing these figures cannot be published, but
anyone is welcome to subscribe to App Annie to for
themselves to see the data we have summarized).


CMCM’s indiscretions were brought to light by Chinese-
language IT news portal LanDian News. Here is an English
translation of the recent post:


“In order to promote their own software, some
software vendors encourage users to uninstall
Google Chrome and other third-party browsers.
This is a common practice in China, but such
practice is banned overseas.


Recently, because of Cheetah’s Clean Master (Clean
Master) app’s alleged violation of the rules for promotions,
Google severely punished Clean Master by removing it
from Google Play rankings in all regions of the world.


According to overseas netizens, Clean Master could still be
found on the ranking list before July 14 in multiple

countries, but the app is no longer in the ranking list of any
country since July 15.


Shortly after, an unidentified source suggested that
because of the suspected malicious intent to mislead users
to remove legitimate apps, Clean Master was penalized by
Google Play worldwide. So far there is no clear timetable
for the penalty to be lifted.


According to sources close to the matter, Cheetah’s Clean
Master violated Google Play’s policy because Clean Master
(“CM”) promotes its CM Browser in the notification bar.
However, this promotional approach is suspected of
violating multiple Google Play rules.


It’s understood that Cheetah Clean Master uses system
notifications as advertisements for irrelevant functions,
which violates Google’s rules. Furthermore, it intentionally
misleads and encourages users to uninstall third-party
apps, including third-party browsers such as Google
Chrome that have no known security concerns.


Meanwhile, Clean Master employed a straw-man tactic to
mislead users by misrepresenting the size of the
installation file’s memory footprint requirement. As a
result, users are misled that CM Browser could significantly
reduce the memory footprint. Furthermore, Cheetah
provides a clear “uninstall” button to encourage users to
remove Chrome or other third party browsers that have no
known security issues.”


Per Naked Security, Google has been making a
significant push to clean up the Google Play store:

https://geoinvesting.com/a-potential-impaling-blow-to-cheetah-mobile-as-flagship-product-removed-from-googles-app-store-rankings/ 6/12


“Through periodic updates to its policies, Google
is attempting to clean up its Android market and
punish developers who try to work around the
rules against pornography, gambling, spyware,
adware and malware – even as the number of
apps in the Play Store has surged past one
million with more added every day.


Although the policy changes won’t stop
developers from cramming free apps with
advertising, the rules Google announced on 28
March 2014 make several adjustments to
Google’s policy on what typically we would call
adware.


The biggest change to the policies is the addition
of an App Promotion policy, which bans ad
behavior such as silently downloading apps
without user consent, and ads that use
misleading pop-up warnings including simulated
system, service, or app notifications or alerts.


In an email to developers and in a post on
Google+, Google notified developers that they
have until 12 April 2014 to comply, or they risk
having their apps bounced from the store.”


It seems that CMCM was given ample time to comply
with Google’s demands, but chose not to do so. This
raises serious concerns regarding CMCM’s highly touted
international expansion just less than three months after
raising almost $200 million (including the green shoe) from
its IPO debut in early May.


Another issue investors need to consider is that our
research also indicates that utility apps are ultimately a
dead-end in the increasingly closed Android world, which is

rapidly eliminating the need for stand-alone, third party
system optimization tools such as CMCM’s Clean Master or
Battery Doctor. This is a second major threat to CMCM’s
business plan.


Without App Store Rankings, Acquiring New Users
Will be More Costly


With the removal of Clean Master from the Google Play
store ranking, it will be much more difficult for CMCM to
acquire new users. App store rankings are a critical method
for app discovery by consumers. In fact, general browsing
through the app store is the most prevalent way of finding
new apps. Per Wikipedia, App Store Optimization (“ASO“)
“…includes the process of ranking highly in an app store’s
search results and top charts rankings. ASO marketers
agree that ranking higher in search results and top charts
rankings will drive more downloads for an app.”
Because Clean Master is no longer ranked, it is now
exceedingly difficult for users outside of China to discover
and download the product (within China there are
hundreds of Android “app stores” and Google Play, like all
other Google products including Gmail, is blocked). CMCM
would now have to greatly increase advertising spending to
attract overseas users to Clean Master, and this would
surely complicate and further delay the implementation of
its monetization strategies.


Clean Master’s Delisting From the Google Play
Rankings Could Get Worse


Even worse than being booted from the Google Play
rankings, there is a chance that Clean Master could
get terminated from the Play store entirely. This
would be a disaster for CMCM as users outside China would
no longer have access to Clean Master. In fact, Naked
Security specifically calls out Clean Master in the article:

“Clean Master is a wildly popular download,
ranked number one in Google Play’s Tools
category, according to TechinAsia.com, and is
promoted as an “Android cleaner and optimizer,”
including protection against malware.


Despite its popularity, ads promoting Clean
Master manipulate Android users with deceptive
tactics when browsing websites within the app’s
advertising framework.


Ferenc László Nagy of SophosLabs Hungary has
captured some pop-up ads that lead to Clean
Master, warning you that your device has been
infected with a virus.


In the screenshot at right [below], you see that
this particular pop-up ad says: “Your Android has
been infected with a virus. Tap OK to remove
now”


On the buttons it says in Hungarian “Mégse”
(Cancel) and “OK.”


Only if you press “OK” the ad redirects you to the
download of the Clean Master App, and does not
“remove” the (“fake”) virus as the ad claims.


According to the website Stayprotected.com,
several other ads promoting Clean Master
resemble warning screens informing you that
your battery is running low due to “potential
viruses” on the device.”

https://geoinvesting.com/a-potential-impaling-blow-to-cheetah-mobile-as-flagship-product-removed-from-googles-app-store-rankings/ 9/12


Thus in order to grow users, it seems CMCM engaged in a
dubious advertising strategy via pop-ups and fake scanners
to promote its Clean Master app.


Impact and Implications


CMCM’s premium valuation is driven by the “promise” of
future monetization of mobile users (most of CMCM’s
revenues today come from traditional online business).
CMCM’s valuation is thus driven by potential mobile user
growth and monetization of those users. To date, CMCM
has been unable to monetize its large mobile user base of
223 million monthly active users.


Given the removal of Clean Master from the Google Play
Store rankings, CMCM’s mobile user growth and future
potential revenues are sure to be impacted. We can thus
begin to eliminate from the equation the related growth
assumption investors have likely built into CMCM’s recent
valuation multiples.


Currently, CMCM spends approximately 27% of sales on
marketing. The former high ranking of Clean Master on
Google Play provided a low cost of user acquisition. With
greatly reduced visibility on Google Play, CMCM will be
forced to increase its marketing expense to sustain mobile
user growth. We would also expect analysts to ratchet
down their financial estimates on CMCM and downgrade
the stock.


CMCM has a recent enterprise value of $2.6 billion and is
expected to generate approximately $251 million in sales
this year. CMCM’s 2014 EV/Sales multiple of 10.5x is higher
than its well-entrenched larger competitor, Qihoo 360
Technology Co. Ltd. (QIHU), which has only a 9.3x
EV/Sales multiple. Given its now uncertain growth
prospects, CMCM’s mobile user “premium” is at risk, and
its shares deserve a much lower valuation than QIHU.

https://geoinvesting.com/a-potential-impaling-blow-to-cheetah-mobile-as-flagship-product-removed-from-googles-app-store-rankings/ 10/12


If CMCM were to trade on par with QIHU EV/S multiple it
would be worth around $16.73. Given that CMCM may no
longer have a global advantage over its competitors we
believe it should trade at a minimum 20% discount to
QIHU’s EV/S multiple, resulting in a share price of $13.40.


From a price to earnings standpoint, QIHU trades at 40
times 2014 EPS, while CMCM recently traded at 86 times
2014 EPS estimates. Applying a similar P/E multiple
analysis leads to price targets for CMCM of $7.04 (based on
32 P/E resulting from 20% discount) and $8.80 (based on
40 P/E, without discount), respectively.
