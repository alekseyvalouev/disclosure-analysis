THIS RESEARCH REPORT EXPRESSES OUR OPINIONS. Use Glaucus Research Group California, LLC’s research opinions at 
your own risk. This is not investment advice nor should it be construed as such.  You should do your own research and due diligence 
before making any investment decisions with respect to the securities covered herein. We are short APR and therefore stand to realize 
significant gains in the event that the price of APR’s stock declines.  Please refer to our full disclaimer on page three of this report.  


ASIA PLASTIC RECYCLING HOLDING LIMITED (“APR” or the “Company”) claims to be 
the #1 producer of EVA (foam rubber) products in China.  In this report, we present publicly 
available tax and land records that, in our opinion, indicate that APR has made material 
misrepresentations to Taiwan investors and regulators regarding its earnings and assets.  We
believe, based on the independent evidence presented in this report, that APR’s actual earnings are 
around 90% less than the figures reported in the Company’s Taiwan filings.  Because of APR’s 
significant indebtedness we put the value of APR’s equity at TWD 0.00 per share. 


1. Overstated Capital Expenditures.  Independent public land records and a government 
website indicate that APR overstated its capital expenditures by at least RMB 422mm on the 
2011-2013 expansion of its Fujian and Jiangsu facilities.  In our opinion, this evidence 
suggests that either insiders diverted the missing funds or that the Company’s capital 
expenditures were artificially inflated to hide fake sales on the balance sheet.  


a. Fujian Factory Land Acquisition Cost Overstated by 4x.  APR claims to have spent 
RMB 126 million in 2011 to acquire 137 mu of additional land for the expansion of the 
Fujian facility.  However, according to publicly available land records posted on 
soudi.cn, APR purchased this land at auction from the Land and Resources Bureau of 
Jinjiang for only RMB 31 million, which is 75% less than the RMB 126mm in
acquisition cost reported to Taiwan investors and regulators.


b. Total Fujian Expansion Project Cost Overstated by ~3x.  APR claims to have spent a 
total of RMB 600 million on the expansion of its Fujian factory between 2011 and 2013.  
However, a government website states that APR invested a total of only RMB 212 
million on the expansion of the factory, 65% less than the cost of RMB 600mm 
reported to Taiwan investors and regulators. 


c. Jiangsu Land Acquisition Cost Overstated by 2.5x. In 2012, APR reportedly acquired 
150 mu of land for RMB 57.9mm (average of RMB 386,000 per mu) for the expansion of 
its Jiangsu facility. But according to records from the Department of Land and Resources 
of Jiangsu Province, which are available to any investor online (by clicking here), APR
only paid an average of RMB 163,000 per mu (a total of RMB 23.6mm) for the land 
purchase, meaning that APR spent 59% less than the RMB 57.9mm reported to 
Taiwan investors and regulators.


2. Government Tax Records Indicate Net Income Overstated by ~10x. The Jinjiang city 
(Fujian province) government publishes an annual list, available to any investor online, which 
ranks the top taxpaying businesses operating in Chendai county, Jinjiang city.  APR, whose 
headquarters, production base and only meaningful PRC operating subsidiary are based in 
Chendai, reported to Taiwanese investors and regulators that it paid RMB 381mm in PRC 
income taxes and (we estimate) RMB 302mm in VAT from 2010 through 2013.  Yet

according to the Jinjiang government, APR only paid between RMB 28mm and RMB 
80mm in total taxes from 2010 through 2013, which is 96% to 88% less than the amount 
reported to Taiwanese investors and regulators during that period.  This suggests that APR 
has vastly exaggerated the scale and profitability of its business.


a. Tax Records Place APR Behind Purportedly Smaller Competitors .  The same 
Chendai county tax records show that APR paid roughly the same amount of taxes from 
2010 through 2012 as two competitors producing EVA foam products in Fujian who 
reported between 81% to 94% less revenue in 2012 than APR.    


3. Lucrative Commodity Business Too Good to be True.  APR collects scraps of recycled 
materials (like discarded shoe soles) and converts them into sheets of EVA foam.  This is a 
low-tech process, and the end product is a commodity.  Yet, unbelievably, APR reports the 
same EBIT margins as Microsoft.    


a. EBIT.  APR’s reported EBIT margins averaged 33% from 2010 to 2012 vs. an average 
of 7% for APR's private local competitors.  


b. APR’s Average Selling Prices are Suspicious. APR claims to sell EVA foam products 
for approximately the same prices as EVA foam products made with virgin (non-
recycled) raw materials.  This is suspicious because APR’s EVA foam products are made 
from recycled materials which cost 65%-80% less than virgin material.  Foam made from 
low-quality recycled materials sells for a substantial discount to foam made from virgin 
materials.


c. Margins are Too Consistent. The other suspicious element of APR’s margins is that 
they are remarkably consistent from year to year.  For example, APR’s average selling 
prices decreased by 27% in 2012 and its costs did not materially change (vs. 2011), yet its 
gross margin increased from 38% to 40% that year.  


d. Sales per Employee.  APR's reported sales per employee of RMB 1.436 mm in 2012 is 
~4x the average sales per employee reported by its private local competitors.


e. Suspicious Sales Growth.  APR reported average sales growth of 19% between 2010 
and 2012.  SAIC filings show that its private local competitors grew sales at an average 
of 0% over the same period, suggesting APR is artificially inflating its reported growth.


4. Serial Capital Raising With No Apparent Bona Fide Purpose .  Despite a significant 
capital infusion from a 2011 IPO, in 2012, APR issued follow-on equity, convertible bonds 
and over TWD 1 billion in bank debt.  Investors should not be fooled.  Any dividends paid to 
date appear to be financed by the large 2012 debt offerings.


5. Valuation. As of December 31, 2013, APR had approximately TWD 3.6 billion of onshore
(i.e. PRC) liabilities outstanding, including TWD 1.8 billion in debt and another TWD 1.8 
billion in various trade payables due to unsecured onshore creditors.  


In a liquidation scenario, the holders of onshore liabilities will take priority over offshore (i.e. 


non-PRC) equity and debt holders.  Because independent evidence suggests that the Company 


has overstated its earnings by 10x and major capital expenditures by 3x, we doubt the 


authenticity of its reported receivables, cash balance and fixed assets. Given the limited 


offshore assets available for seizure (only a minimal amount of cash denominated in 


USD/HKD/TWD as of 12/31/2013) and the difficulty recovering onshore assets (property and 


equipment) under China’s byzantine judicial system, we put a price target on APR’s shares of 


TWD 0.00.

INTRODUCTION

ASIA PLASTIC RECYCLING HOLDING LIMITED (“APR” or the “Company”) is a Fujian-based
manufacturer that claims to be the #1 producer of EVA1 foam products in China.  We believe that APR
has made numerous material misrepresentations to investors and the Taiwan Stock Exchange (“TWSE”), 
in both its 2011 IPO prospectus and in subsequent financial statements, regarding the scale and 
profitability of its business.


Investors do not need to perform our level of due diligence to be suspicious of APR, as even a simple 
reading of the Company’s financial statements reveals numerous red flags.  APR reports the same EBIT 
margins (33%) from recycling foam rubber as Microsoft reports for a quasi-software monopoly.  In 
addition, APR’s reported revenues per employee are four times higher than its competitors.  


It is also highly suspicious that APR is a serial capital raiser despite reportedly generating significant 
amounts of cash from its operations.  Even though APR received a significant capital infusion from a 
2011 IPO, the Company issued follow-on equity, convertible bonds and over TWD 1 billion in bank debt
in 2012.  Why would a Company that supposedly generates such healthy cash flows need to keep 
returning to the capital markets to get more cash? Investors should not be fooled.  Any dividends paid to 
date appear to be financed by the large 2012 debt offerings.


The most convincing evidence comes from publicly available land and government investment records 
which suggest that APR overstated major capital expenditures in Fujian and Jiangsu by around 3-4x 
between 2011 and 2013.  In addition, we believe that online PRC tax records from Jinjiang city, Chendai 
county, where APR's only meaningful operating subsidiary is based, show that APR has overstated 
reported earnings from 2010 through 2013 by around 10x.  


Ultimately, we believe, based on the evidence presented in this report, that APR has materially overstated 
the scale and profitability of its business to investors and regulators, and, in doing so, violated a number 
of Taiwan's securities laws.  Like the Asian stock market regulators in Hong Kong and Singapore, we 
believe the TWSE will halt trading of APR’s shares pending a full investigation into the Company.

OVERSTATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 


During APR’s first three years as a public company (2011 through 2013), APR raised TWD 4.4 billion 
from the capital markets (both equity and debt).  


Source: Company Filings.


During this period, APR claims to have spent TWD 4.6 billion (~RMB 1 billion) (100% of the proceeds 
raised) on capital expenditures, the vast majority of which was reportedly spent on the expansion of its 
Fujian and Jiangsu factories.   


APR claims in its public filings to have spent RMB 600 million in capital expenditures, between 2011 
and 2013, on the expansion of its Jiangtou facility, located in city of Jinjiang, Fujian province (the “Fujian 
Expansion Project”), which included RMB 126 million for the acquisition of land use rights.  


Yet public infrastructure records indicate that APR only spent RMB 212mm (65% less than the
reported amount) on the Fujian Expansion Project, indicating that capital expenditures were overstated 
by RMB 388mm.  This suggests, in our opinion, either that insiders diverted the missing capital 
expenditures or that the capital expenditures were inflated to cover for fabricated sales.

1) Fujian Factory Land Acquisition Cost Overstated by ~4x


APR claims to have spent RMB 126 million in 2011 to acquire 137 mu of new land for the Fujian 
Expansion Project.2  The following is an excerpt from the Company’s 2012 annual report.


However, according to land records posted on soudi.cn (translation: "landsearch.cn"), APR purchased this 
land at auction from the Land and Resources Bureau of Jinjiang for only RMB 31 million, which is 75% 
less than the land acquisition cost reported in APR’s Taiwan filings.

Note that the area of the land purchase (137 mu) as reported on the website (shown above) is the exact 
same size of the land that APR claimed to have purchased in its 2012 annual report.  Rather than 
spending RMB 126mm on the land rights, the public land records suggest that APR paid only RMB 
31mm, 75% less than the reported figure.  This is compelling evidence suggesting that APR massively 
exaggerated the amount it spent on land acquisition in connection with the Fujian Expansion Project.  


2) Total Fujian Expansion Project Cost Overstated by ~3x


APR claims to have invested a total of RMB 600 million in connection with the Fujian Expansion Project
between 2011 and 2013, reportedly increasing the interior factory space by approximately 120,000 m.2
The following slides, taken from APR’s 2012 and 2014 management presentations, respectively, outline 
the expansion and the amount of the investment in the project.

APR's February 2014 management presentation (shown above) confirms that APR supposedly invested a 
total of RMB 600 million on the Fujian Expansion Project.  However, official records available on the 
Jinjiang government website, which any investor can access online (and which we have excerpted below), 
show that APR’s "total investment" for the Fujian Expansion Project (~110,000 m2) was only RMB 212 
mm, which is 65% less than the capital investment amount reported to Taiwan investors and regulators.

The records available on the Jinjiang government website show that APR only invested a total of RMB 
212mm on the Fujian Expansion Project, 65% less than the 600mm reported in APR’s Taiwan filings.  
This evidence suggests that APR overstated its capital expenditures by RMB 388mm.


Why would a company deliberately overstate capital expenditures?  In our experience, there are two 
reasons. Either the missing expenditures were secretly transferred to insiders or capital expenditures were 
overstated in order to hide proceeds from fake sales on the balance sheet.

3) Jiangsu Land Acquisition Cost Overstated by ~2.5x


Publicly available records of land transfers suggest that APR also overstated the land acquisition cost with 
respect to the expansion of its facility in the city of Jurong in Jiangsu province (the “Jiangsu Expansion
Project”). In APR’s 2012 annual report, the Company announced that it had acquired "about 150 mu" of 
land within the Jurong Economic Development Zone for RMB 57.9mm (average of RMB 386,000 per 
mu) for the Jiangsu Expansion Project.  


Source: APR 2012 Annual Report, p. 112


But according to records from the Department of Land and Resources of Jiangsu Province, which are 
available to any investor online (by clicking here), APR only paid RMB23.6mm (an average of RMB 
163,000 per mu) for the 2011 Jurong land purchase, indicating that APR overstated its land acquisition 
costs for the Jiangsu Expansion Project by almost 2.5x.

The following table sets forth, in detail, the land records available on the Jiangsu government website 
documenting the price paid by APR for the land acquired in connection with the Jiangsu Expansion 
Project. 


Land record links: 3211832012CR0244; 3211832013CR0192; 3211832013CR0191; 3211832013CR0193;

The independent and publicly available records from the Department of Land and Resources of 
Jiangsu province show, in our opinion, that APR overstated the cost of acquiring the ~150 mu of land for 
the Jiangsu Expansion Project by 2.5x.  We believe that this is further independent evidence that APR has 
been overstating the amount of its capital expenditures since going public.

TAX RECORDS 


Online tax records published on an official PRC government website suggest that the Company is paying 
far less tax than it claims in its public filings. According to Company filings, APR's headquarters, 
production facilities, and only meaningful PRC subsidiary are located in the Chendai County of Jinjiang 
City, Fujian Province (in China, counties are smaller than cities).


APR's corporate filings disclose three subsidiaries, Sansd (Fujian) Plastic Co., Ltd. ("Sansd Fujian"), 
Sansd (Jiangsu) Environmental Technology Co., Ltd. ("Sansd Jiangsu"), and Sansda (Hong Kong) 
Trading Co. Ltd. ("Sansda HK").  


Source: Company 2012 Annual Report.


According to APR, of the three operating subsidiaries above, only Sansd Fujian earns any meaningful 
operating income, and therefore would be the only entity to pay any meaningful income taxes.


APR admits in its public filings that it does not pay taxes in Hong Kong.  Its only significant connection 
to Taiwan is that it has listed its shares on the exchange.  And since its only other subsidiary, Sansd 
Jiangsu, had no operating income in 2011 or 2012, we can comfortably infer that Sansd Fujian is the 
Company’s only meaningful tax-paying entity.

In recent years, the Jinjiang city government (http://www.jinjiang.gov.cn/) has recognized the top tax 
paying companies in Chendai county on a list published on the government website. As shown below, the 
government lists break out the top tax paying businesses into various tiers based on the amount of taxes 
paid.  For example, the following announcement, available on the government’s website, recognizes the 
88 Chendai county businesses that paid over RMB 2mm in PRC taxes in 2010 (including income taxes 
and VAT).


If APR's reported financials are true, Sansd Fujian should be on the Tier 2 list in 2010 (i.e., a business that 
paid between RMB 100mm and RMB 600mm in tax), because it reported paying RMB 74mm in income 
taxes and (we estimate) it paid RMB 58.1mm in VAT (reported gross profit *17%), for a total of RMB 
132 mm in reported taxes paid in 2010.  


Yet Sansd Fujian actually appears on the Tier 7 list, indicating that APR's only meaningful PRC operating 
subsidiary paid between RMB 8mm and 10mm in 2010, which is between 6% and 8% of reported taxes 
paid.

Whereas Sansd Fujian should appear in Tier 3 in 2011 and 2012, Sansd Fujian actually appears on the 
Jinjiang city tax list on Tier 7 (between RMB 10 mm and RMB 20 mm in taxes paid) in 2011, and in Tier 
10 (between RMB 10mm and RMB 20mm in taxes paid) in 2012.  Notably, Sansd Fujian does not even 
appear on the government’s 2013 list of top tax payers, even though, according to its Q4 2013 
Taiwanese filing, it paid over RMB 187.7mm in taxes that year.

Put simply, the Jinjiang government’s tax lists indicate that APR is paying far less in taxes than it claims 
in its public filings, which suggests that the Company’s revenues and profits are significantly smaller than 
the figures reported in APR’s financial statements.  


1) Tax Records Place APR Behind Purportedly Smaller Competitors


Jinjiang city tax records also show that Sansd Fujian paid roughly the same amount of taxes as two 
competitors producing EVA foam products in Fujian who reported at least 75% less in revenues than 
APR.  


If APR’s reported financials are true, then Sansd Fujian, the Company’s only meaningful operating and 
taxpaying entity, should pay far more taxes in than two local competitors, Maotai (Fujian) Soles 
(Chinese:茂泰(福建)鞋材有限公司) (“Maotai”) and Jinjiang Taiya Shoes Development (Chinese: 


晋江市泰亚鞋业发展有限公司) (“Taiya”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taiya Shoes (002517 CH), 
both of whom produce and sell EVA foam products in the same city:4


In 2012, Sansd Fujian reported 15 times more revenue than Taiya and 5 times more revenue than 
Maotai from selling the same EVA foam products that all three companies manufacture in the same city.  
Moreover, APR claims to earn higher margins on its sales than its competitors.  Therefore, APR’s 
subsidiary should pay significantly more in taxes than its purportedly much smaller local competitors. 


Yet, Sansd Fujian appears in the same tax-paying bracket on the Jinjiang City government taxpayer lists 
as Maotai from 2010-2012 and in the same bracket as Taiya in 2010 and 2012.  Below are excerpts of the 
taxpayer lists and links to the government website indicating that Sansd Fujian is paying roughly the same 
amount in taxes from 2010-2012 as competitors who were reporting far less in revenue.

According to the government tax lists, Sansd Fujian pays roughly the same amount of tax as Maotai and 
Taiya, each of whom reports 81% and 94% less in revenue than Sansd Fujian, respectively.  The
implication of these tax records could not be clearer: that Sansd Fujian’s actual earnings are a fraction of 
the reported figures.

LUCRATIVE COMMODITY BUSINESS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE


A common denominator of companies that have collapsed under suspicion of fraud is that their reported 
financial performance appears too good to be true.  APR is no different. 


1) EBIT Margins


APR’s reported EBIT margins from 2010 through 2012 (~33%) are so far superior to its local competitors 
that it simply defies credibility.  APR collects scraps of recycled foam (like discarded shoe soles) and 
converts them into sheets of foam rubber.  It is a low-tech process where not only the end product is a 
commodity, but so are 90% of the inputs and raw materials.  Investors should therefore not expect 
significant EBIT margin deviation from firms producing the same commodity and operating in the same 
or similar geographic area.  


Sources: Company Filings; competitor SAIC Filings.


Compared to other EVA foam producers operating in the same area, APR’s reported financial 
performance is simply incredible.  APR reported an average EBIT margin of 33% from 2010-2012, 
compared to its competitors who reported an average EBIT margin of 7% during the same period.  To put 
it into context, APR reports the same EBIT margins as Microsoft.   


2) APR’s Average Selling Prices Are Suspicious


How does APR explain such high margins in a commoditized and hyper-competitive business?  APR
claims to sell EVA foam products for an average sales price (“ASP”) of RMB 3,500-4,000 per cubic

meter of EVA foam, which is approximately the same price as EVA foam products made with virgin 
(non-recycled) raw materials.  


This appears suspicious, because according to experts with knowledge of the EVA foam recycling 
business, the price of EVA foam products is driven by the quality of the raw materials used in the 
manufacturing process. Producers who purchase virgin EVA foam from suppliers should be able to 
manufacture a higher quality product and charge a higher price.


But APR claims to purchase recycled scraps from its suppliers at a cost that is 65 to 80% lower than the 
cost of virgin (i.e. non-recycled) EVA foam.5  


In its Q1 2012 management presentation, APR states that 66.9% of the raw materials used in 2011 
consisted of cheap recycled materials.6 If APR uses cheap recycled raw materials, how does it charge the 
same ASP as manufacturers who use virgin raw materials?  


3) Suspiciously Consistent Margins


The other suspicious element of APR’s margins is that they are remarkably consistent from year to 
year.  This consistency of performance, as shown in the slide below from the Company’s 2014 
management presentation, is especially suspicious given that APR’s average selling prices decreased by 
27% in 2012 and its costs did not materially change (vs. 2011), yet its gross margin increased from 
38% to 40% that year.7  


2014 APR Management Presentation, p. 25


It is a significant red flag, in our opinion, that APR’s gross margins can increase in a year when its ASPs 
declined 27%.

4) Sales per Employee


APR also claimed to generate RMB 1.436 million of revenue per employee in 2012, a worker 
productivity rate that is ~4x the revenue generated per employee by its closest competitors.  


Source: APR Company Filings; Competitor sales from competitor SAIC filings; competitor employee count 
from recorded phone calls with APR competitors.  SAIC filings for APR's other named PRC private 


competitors were not available.


In our experience, when management teams exaggerate sales and growth numbers, they often forget to 
give a commensurate boost to other operational metrics such as employee headcount. Thus, productivity 
ratios and other efficiency ratios that significantly deviate from the industry standard are often red flags 
when accompanied by suspiciously amazing financial performance.

5) Suspicious Sales Growth


APR’s reported average sales growth of 19% between 2010 and 2012 is well in excess of the 0% average 
growth for its private local competitors during the same period.  


This is a significant red flag because APR is operating in a mature and commoditized market, making it 
highly unlikely it would be able to steal market share from competitors, especially given, as APR admits, 


that the Company sells the products made from low-quality recycled materials for the same high 
prices as competitors who make EVA foam products with virgin materials.

SERIAL CAPITAL RAISER


APR is a serial capital raiser, having tapped the capital markets for TWD 4.4 billion during the last 3 
years.  In August 2011, APR raised TWD 1.4 billion in an IPO to fund new plant construction and 
working capital.  Yet despite this fresh influx of cash, one year late the Company made a TWD 1.4 billion 
secondary offering, issued TWD 0.6 billion in high yield bonds and incurred TWD 1.1 billion in bank 
indebtedness.  


Investors should not be fooled by dividends paid in 2012 and 2013, as any dividends paid to date appear 
to be financed by the large 2012 debt offerings. The remaining TWD 3.3 billion in proceeds raised net of 
dividends appear to have already been spent on capital expenditure projects of dubious utility.  


Source: Company Filings.


Given the significant amount of evidence indicating that its earnings are overstated by up to 10x, 
investors should certainly fear that funds raised from the capital markets may be siphoned to insiders 
through capital expenditures.

VALUATION


As of December 31, 2013, APR had approximately TWD 3.6 billion of onshore liabilities outstanding, 
including TWD 1.8 billion in debt and another TWD 1.8 billion in various trade payables due to 
unsecured onshore creditors.  


In a liquidation scenario, the holders of onshore liabilities will take priority over offshore (i.e. non-PRC) 
equity and debt holders.  Because independent evidence suggests that the Company has overstated its 


earnings by 10x and major capital expenditures by at least 3x, we doubt the authenticity of its reported 
receivables, cash balance and fixed assets.  Given the limited offshore assets available for seizure (only a 


minimal amount of cash denominated in USD/HKD/TWD as of 12/31/2013) and the difficulty recovering 
onshore assets (property and equipment) under China’s byzantine judicial system, we put a price target on 
APR’s shares of TWD 0.00.
