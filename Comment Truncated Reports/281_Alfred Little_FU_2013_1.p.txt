FAB Universal: The Face of Piracy In China
Nov. 14, 2013 1:56 PM ET104 comments
by: Alfred Little


FAB Universal Corp. (NYSEMKT:FU) claims to be a global leader in the distribution of
copyright-protected digital media. FAB derives substantially all of its revenue and profit
from its Chinese subsidiary, which, according to its FY2012 10-K filed on 3/18/13:


"… is engaged in marketing and distributing various officially licensed digital
entertainment products under the 'FAB' brand throughout the PRC…"


At the core of FAB's Chinese business are its "Intelligent Media Kiosks" allowing
consumers to download copyright-protected movies and music to their portable storage
devices. FAB claimed to have 3,954 such "intelligent" kiosks in Beijing alone, according to
its 6/1/12 proxy (DEF 14A, filed with the SEC on 6/15/12), with over 16,820 active kiosks
deployed in 40 Chinese cities according to FAB's 11/13/13 press release announcing 2013
Q3 financial results.


In today's report I will show that:


1. Contrary to FAB's anti-piracy claims, FAB's "Intelligent Media Kiosks" are in reality
loaded with very obviously pirated U.S. movies.


2. FAB's kiosk manufacturers acknowledged that: a) They historically supplied around
1,600-1,700 kiosks to FAB, only 10% of the 16,820 units FAB claims to have deployed;
b) One kiosk supplier helped FAB stage phony manufacturer site visits for FAB's
investors, reminiscent of the China Integrated Energy (OTC:CBEH) fraud I exposed in
2011.


3. FAB's director of franchisee sales acknowledged that: a) FAB has only around 1000
kiosks in Beijing (compared to 3,954 disclosed in the 6/1/12 proxy); and b) FAB
promises kiosk franchisees guaranteed minimum returns on their investments and
offers to buy back the franchised kiosks using FAB U.S. listed common stock.


Based on the interviews and evidence that I collected, I conclude that FAB's business in
China is a tiny fraction of what it claims in its SEC filings. FAB's actual profitability would
be reduced even further if the company upgraded its pirated content to properly licensed
content (assuming that is even possible). Finally, FAB has potentially enormous
undisclosed liabilities for guaranteeing minimum investment returns to franchisees and
undisclosed potential dilution from common stock issuable to franchisees.

Background - "Best Buy meets iTunes meets Redbox"


FAB (formerly Wizzard Software - WZE) was formed out of a reverse merger with a twist:
Wizzard's Pittsburg management, led by CEO Chris Spencer and CFO John Busshaus,
claimed to have actually paid professionals to vet the Chinese acquisition target prior to
the merger:


"Legal due diligence was performed by King & Wood [a prominent Chinese law firm
with its head office in Beijing] and accounting and tax due diligence was performed
by a 'big four' accounting and consulting firm."


On Page 22 of the 6/1/12 proxy FAB disclosed that the "big four" accounting due diligence
service provider was none other than Ernst & Young. While the use of E&Y certainly may
have assured investors, in my opinion E&Y has a very poor track record preventing fraud
in China. Consider the case of SinoTech Energy, a former NASDAQ listed company
audited by E&Y and charged with fraud by the SEC following my 2011 whistleblower
report.


Nevertheless, attracted to the too-good-to-be-true acquisition, Wizzard shareholders
overwhelmingly approved a 1-for-12 reverse split and a series of highly dilutive share
issuances (spanning two years), to ultimately give the shareholders of FAB's Chinese
acquisition 78% of the combined company, provided that certain revenue, income, and
corporate governance objectives are achieved.


On 4/12/12, Wizzard announced the definitive Share Exchange Agreement with FAB.
CEO Chris Spencer exulted that the newly merged FAB is "Best Buy meets iTunes meets
Redbox." Spencer and FAB's Chinese Chairman Hongcheng Zhang appear below
banging a gong celebrating the NYSE listing of FAB:

"The Face of Copyright Protection in China"


FAB's SEC filings, press releases, and investor presentations are littered with copyright-
protection claims such as the following (found on Pages 28 and 29 of FAB's 3/18/13
FY2012 10-K filing):


"We believe our business of selling and distributing copyright protected media and
content in China will continue to grow and generate profits due to the brand
recognition of FAB in China as well as the continued support of the government for
copyright protection in China."


"The FAB Intelligent Media Kiosks have greatly enhanced consumer ease-of-
purchase while reducing the appeal of pirated content, positively transforming
market dynamics in China for legitimate content and facilitating licensing
opportunities with traditional media publishers who desire safe access to the world's
largest, fastest-growing consumer market."


On 7/24/12, FAB Chairman Zhang Hongcheng strongly asserted FAB's copyright
achievements, emphasizing that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 4/51


"'Insisting on the protection of copyrights and resisting piracy is the core belief to
which FAB always adheres,' said Mr. Zhang Hongcheng, Founder and Chairman of
FAB. 'Making the FAB Intelligent Media Kiosks a copyright content distribution
platform and providing users with easy access to high-quality digital content is the
top business priority of FAB.' FAB has a large library of copyrighted digital content
including digital movies, TV shows, video, ebooks, games, music and strategic
relationships with more than a hundred digital content providers across Asia."


On FAB's Q2 2013 conference call on 8/14/13, CEO Chris Spencer exalted that Zhang
(age 43) is the "face of copyright protection in China":


"Mr. Zhang, the Chairman of our Board here is the head of the anti-piracy copyright
protection organizations within China for the last 20 years [since Zhang was 23?].
He, you could argue, is the face of copyright protection in China. He has definitely
been a main driver for the last 20 years about this and we've done a good job."


According to FAB, Zhang was the founding chairman of the "Anti-Piracy Alliance" of
China. Zhang is shown below (with suit and tie) at the Anti-Piracy Alliance's launch
ceremony held on 7/15/10:


FAB's commitment to anti-piracy attracted the legendary investor Jim Rogers to recently
join FAB's board and take a small stake in the company. Rogers told Barron's that he was
motivated by the Chinese government's stricter enforcement of intellectual property laws.
Rogers and Zhang are shown below, after signing the directorship agreement:

While I personally greatly admire Jim Rogers, I have to seriously question his due
diligence on FAB. Anyone who takes the time to actually download movies from FAB's
kiosks in Beijing will immediately realize that FAB's anti-piracy claims are a total and
complete fraud.


I. FAB's "Intelligent Media Kiosks" - The Face of Piracy in China


I recently sent my investigators to download movies from FAB's kiosks at its two Beijing
"entertainment superstores." Unfortunately, they found that FAB's 30,000 square foot
"Xidan Joy City" store in West Beijing was shut down for "remodeling" as shown in the
following photo taken on 10/13/13:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 6/51


Next my investigators visited FAB's 20,000 square foot "SoShow" store in East Beijing, at
Chongwen Men, in the basement of the aging SoShow shopping mall (pictured below).
Fortunately, FAB's SoShow store was open for business.


My investigators' first step was to purchase two 50 RMB ($8.20) FAB membership cards
from SoShow store employees who explained that movies cost 1, 2, or 3 RMB ($0.16,
$0.33, $0.49) to download. Many movies are actually free to download. The average price
of a recently released U.S. movie was only 0.8 RMB, or about 13 U.S. cents! Out of 260
movies on each kiosk, around 35 were recent U.S. releases.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 7/51


The SoShow staff explained that the membership cards would not be immediately
activated due to a "virus" infecting FAB's system. The staff then offered to help the
investigators download from a kiosk, free of charge, the Hollywood new release Olympus
Has Fallen.


However, downloading the movie file proved to be a significant challenge for the SoShow
staff. After multiple failed attempts to download Olympus Has Fallen from three different
kiosks, the staff finally succeeded (using the store's own USB flash drive) and then
transferred the file to my investigator's laptop.


The glitchy kiosks are one problem, but the fact that the movie could be so easily copied
more than once (from the kiosk to a flash drive to a laptop) indicates that the movie files
contain no Digital Rights Management copyright protection mechanism. FAB movie files
can be copied and played on multiple devices, as many times as the customer wants.


The following are screen stills from my investigator's recording of Olympus Has Fallen
being downloaded from the SoShow kiosk and then being played on his MacBook inside
the SoShow store:

The red circle highlights the Chinese subtitles, which are embedded on the film. This is the
first sign that the movie is pirated; according to my conversations and emails with an
investigator from the Motion Picture Association of America ("MPAA"). Several of FAB's
pirated movies even contained advertisements for the pirated source of the subtitles, such
as "FISH321@18P2P."

A second, and very obvious, proof that the FAB's Olympus Has Fallen is pirated can be
found by inspecting the file metadata shown below:


Filename: FAB5C_白宫陷落.rmvb [Olympus Has Fallen]


File size: 674.2 MB


File creation date: July 4, 2013


File type: RealPlayer Media (RMVB)


The piracy is evident from the file creation date of 7/4/2013. According to IMDB.com
Olympus Has Fallen was not released on DVD until 8/13/2013. Apple's iTunes was able to
sell an electronic DRM-protected version a week earlier. How could FAB possibly have a
legal version in China more than a month before iTunes in the U.S.?


The final proof that this movie is pirated is the quality of the video itself. I uploaded a short
clip from FAB's pirated version of Olympus Has Fallen that can be viewed by clicking here.


After reviewing this initial evidence, I sent my investigators back to the SoShow store to
download and collect more of the pirated movies as evidence to share with securities
regulators and the MPAA. The FAB kiosks continued to repeatedly suffer technical glitches
downloading files onto USB flash drives, but eventually my investigators were able to
download a total of 5 movies over the course of two hours. Excluding the kiosks' technical
problems, each movie took between 3 to 5 minutes to download via USB, depending on
the size of each file, and indicating a very slow transfer rate of only around 3MB per
second.


The following are screen stills from my investigator's recording of Iron Man 3 being
downloaded from the SoShow kiosk and then being played on his MacBook inside the
SoShow store:

Here is the Iron Man 3 movie file metadata:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 13/51


Filename: FAB5C_钢铁侠3.rmvb [Iron Man 3]


File size: 1.05 GB


File creation date: May 15, 2013


File type: RealPlayer Media (RMVB)


Once again, the piracy is evident from the file creation date of 5/15/13. According to
IMDB.com, the DVD release date of Iron Man 3 was not until 9/24/13. A special DRM-
protected HD digital download was available earlier on iTunes, on 9/3/13. Once again,
how could FAB have an electronic copy available in China months prior to iTunes?


The quality of FAB's pirated Iron Man 3 movie file is even worse than Olympus Has Fallen.
Whoever pirated Iron Man 3, mistakenly changed the aspect ratio from its original wide-
screen format (likely filmed by a camera in a theater) to 1080x720, which had the
unsightly effect of making all the images taller and narrower as can be seen in the follow
two images.

It is evident from the table that FAB added nearly every U.S. movie to the kiosks prior to
the official DVD release date. In many cases FAB's pirated movies were available months
prior to the respective official DVD release dates. FAB's average selling price per movie is
only 80 Chinese cents or 13 U.S. pennies!


My investigators recorded interviews surveying multiple FAB kiosk operators both at FAB's
flagship SoShow store and other Beijing locations. Below is a summary of their findings:


1. All staff interviewed insisted that all movies on the kiosks were copyrighted, despite the
very obvious evidence to the contrary.


2. Staff acknowledged that the kiosks' USB connections are "glitchy" and refuse to read
many devices, while inconsistently reading other devices.


3. Kiosk content used to be updated each week, but now are updated less frequently.
Additional pirated movie content was being sold from a PC in each store and was
repeatedly offered to my investigators when the kiosks were slow to function.


4. The retail stores routinely give away free kiosk membership cards with each 50 to 100
RMB retail merchandise purchase in the store.


5. One operator claimed that most kiosk customers obtained membership cards for free
with merchandise purchases.


6. Another operator claimed that most kiosk customers either downloaded free movies or
used free membership cards to download movies.


7. Operators cited having between 10 kiosk customers per week to as little as 10 kiosk
customers per month.


8. Operators believed there were definitely more than 100 kiosks in Beijing, but were not
sure whether there were more than 500 kiosks in Beijing.


9. Operators believed that FAB's kiosks were deployed in 30 to as many as 200 possible
locations in Beijing.

In addition to offering pirated movies on its kiosks, FAB also offers pirated movie
exhibitions and private screenings to the Chinese public at its Joy City "Private Movie
Club" as discussed below.


Xidan Joy City "Private (Read: Pirated) Movie Club"


Not only does FAB let Chinese consumers download pirated Hollywood movies from their
kiosks for pennies, FAB also publicly screens pirated Hollywood movies in one of the
biggest shopping malls in Beijing. FAB's Xidan Joy City store includes a "Private Movie
Club" with 20-30 private soundproof movie-screening rooms that are available 24 hours a
day with refreshments and optional "VIP services."


Ironically, FAB's "Private Movie Club" (on the 9th floor of the Joy City Mall) is located right
underneath a legitimate Chinese multiplex movie theater chain (on the 10th floor) in the
very same shopping mall.


My investigators interviewed the staff of the legitimate "Capital Cinema" upstairs from
FAB. The staff immediately explained that all of FAB's movies shown in its Private Movie
Club were pirated from the Internet. The staff explained that legitimate movies shown in
theaters always have the following State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television
("SARFT") seal of approval at the start:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 18/51


I therefore sent my investigators to interview the Joy City "Private Movie Club" staff and to
record pirated movies being played in the screening rooms. From these interviews, I
learned the following:


1. FAB attracts customers to its private screening rooms (shown below) by emphasizing
the privacy, a 500+ database of "theater-quality" movies, and free refreshments for
prepaid members.


2. The staff actually bragged that FAB's private screening room had shown Now You See
Me two days prior to its 10/10/13 official release in China. The staff then played a
portion of a pirated copy of the movie stored on FAB's network. A screen shot from my
investigator's recording appears below:

3. Despite the obvious piracy, the staff of the Private Movie Club nevertheless insisted
that all of the movie content was properly licensed and not pirated.


Interview of FAB CEO Chris Spencer


On Monday, 11/11/13, I questioned FAB's CEO, Chris Spencer, regarding piracy, DRM,
and FAB's average selling prices for U.S. movies. The key points of our conversation
were:


1. Chris adamantly affirmed that FAB's entire kiosk content was properly licensed and
copyright protected.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 20/51


2. Chris acknowledged that in the extremely unlikely event that there were pirated movie
files on the kiosks, that FAB would detect them and immediately remove them;
because


3. FAB "continuously" and "frequently" checks the kiosks for pirated content. However,
Chris was uncertain exactly how frequently FAB staff reviews kiosk content for piracy.


4. Chris did not dispute the $0.13 average selling price of recently released U.S. movies.
He explained that FAB has not really focused on generating revenue from movie
downloads.


5. Chris acknowledged that the kiosk movie files contained no DRM. Chris explained that
DRM was incompatible with many devices and that FAB was researching anti-piracy
protection methods to possibly implement in the future.


At the beginning of our conversation, Chris explained that FAB management was divided
over whether he should talk to me. However, Chris explained that he had taken the time to
review my track record on Alfredlittle.com and he complimented the good work that I have
done exposing bad companies. Chris hoped that I would only publish the truth. I assured
him that is always the case.


Regarding the piracy issue, the truth is clear. FAB's kiosk content is pirated and this fact
requires its U.S. management to take immediate action. Furthermore, FAB will have to
reconsider its entire kiosk business plan in light of the piracy. Common sense says that
properly licensed content requires much more than 13 cents per movie in revenue to turn
a profit.


II. FAB's Kiosk Manufacturers Acknowledge Only 1,600-1,700 Units Sold to FAB


FAB claimed to have 3,954 "intelligent" kiosks in Beijing alone, according to its 6/1/12
proxy, with over 16,820 kiosks in 40 Chinese cities according to FAB's 11/13/13 press
release announcing 2013 Q3 results.


Historically, the two main manufacturers of FAB's kiosks were Beijing Riyao Technology
Co. Ltd. (北京日尧科技有限公司采访) and Beijing Chongfeng Touch and Control
Technology Co. Ltd. (崇峰触控(北京)科技有限公司), according to my investigators'
interview of a former FAB manager.


My investigators visited Riyao and Chongfeng to interview the management and learned
the following:


A). According to Riyao management:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 21/51


1. Riyao did business with FAB from 2008 until 2012. Riyao sold less than 500 kiosks to
FAB.


2. Riyao more than once helped FAB stage manufacturing site visits for investors. At
FAB's request, Riyao would post signage pretending to be "Xing Wang Xun Tong."
Riyao's manager showed my investigators pictures of the fabricated "Xing Wang Xun
Tong" signage.


3. Riyao stopped supplying kiosks to FAB in 2012 because FAB was consistently late to
pay.


4. FAB at one point was one and a half years delinquent paying Riyao 1 million RMB.
5. FAB has difficulty contracting manufacturers for its kiosks because of FAB's bad


reputation (being late to pay suppliers).
6. FAB's main purpose was not to "run a real business" but rather to use the kiosk


concept to go public to "cheat money."


Riyao's staging of investor visits to a fabricated manufacturing facility using the name
"Xing Wang Xun Tong" raises some very serious concerns. Did FAB use a phony "Xing
Wang" entity to deceive E&Y, King & Wood, its auditor (Friedman), U.S. officers, and
directors regarding kiosk production?


FAB's fabricated "Xing Wang" factory tours remind me of China Integrated Energy, a
Chinese company delisted from NASDAQ after I busted the management staging phony
biodiesel production activity for Rodman & Renshaw investors in 2011. ABC News
interviewed me here regarding my investigation.


B). According to Chongfeng management:


1. Chongfeng has done doing business with FAB since 2007-2008.
2. Chongfeng sold around 1,000 kiosks to FAB. FAB provided the software.
3. The poor performance of the kiosks observed by my investigators (insensitive touch


screen and glitchy USB drive reader) was due to the low-end hardware chosen by
FAB.


4. Chongfeng is uncertain whether the kiosks can generate a profit. However, Chongfeng
pointed out that FAB was certainly successful raising money from investors attracted to
the kiosk concept and pointed out that FAB's business model is "just about raising
money."


5. Regarding DRM protection of media files, Chongfeng explained: "That part [of the
kiosks] was not done by us. Jingcai [FAB] has no licensed content. You don't know
that? The CD/DVDs they were selling are copyright protected. The ones in their kiosks
for download are not licensed or copyright protected."

6. Chongfeng then went on to explain: "There were two reasons FAB's kiosks were not
widely deployed. One was the media content being pirated, second was they haven't
found a correct model to make money."


Below are some snapshots from my investigators' interviews of FAB's two main historical
kiosk suppliers:

During my 11/11/13 interview of FAB CEO Chris Spencer, he mentioned two more kiosk
manufacturers contracted by FAB: Beijing Fulei (北京富雷实业有限公司) and Nanjing
Pinjia (南京品佳科技开发有限公司).


My investigators followed up by contacting both companies by phone on 11/14/13 and
learned the following:


1. Nanjing Pinjia has historically produced 100-200 kiosks for FAB, according to the
Market Department Manager Zhou Chunguo (phone number: 15305181668).


2. Beijing Fulei only produces lottery kiosks and sold some lottery kiosks to FAB,
according to a manager named Mr. Zhou in the laminator equipment department. The
lottery kiosks department manager, Mr. Chen (phone number: 13701108558) was not
available.


Based on my investigators' interviews of all four of FAB's kiosk suppliers, in total they have
historically supplied 1600-1700 kiosks to FAB, only 10% of the 16,820 kiosks FAB claims
to have currently in active service (and not including replacement or upgraded units

deployed by FAB).


I believe that at the very least FAB should respond by publishing a complete list of all the
physical addresses of the nearly 4,000 kiosks FAB claimed to have deployed in Beijing so
that investors can verify that they truly exist. Based on my thorough on the ground due
diligence I strongly believe that they do not.


III. FAB's Director of Franchisee Sales Acknowledged Only 1000 Kiosks in Beijing
and Promises Franchisees Minimum Guaranteed Returns Plus Free-Trading FU
Stock at a 20% Discount to Market


After thoroughly analyzing FAB's pirated movie kiosk business model, my investigators
turned to FAB itself and approached FAB's director of franchisee sales to learn how the
franchise business works. FAB's director of franchisee sales told my investigator:


1. There are currently only about 1,000 FAB kiosks deployed in Beijing market (including
all kiosk models, old and new.)


2. FAB has stopped distributing the previous versions of its kiosks (including the kiosks in
its flagship store) and has started selling a new type of kiosk to franchisees for 80,000
RMB.


3. Since October 2012, FAB has signed up "several hundred" franchisees for these new
kiosks.


4. After signing an operating agreement with the franchisee, FAB's staff selects a location
to deploy the kiosk.


5. FAB's staff then installs, operates, and maintains all franchisees' kiosks, including
uploading and updating all the content.


6. Each franchisee has the right to know the location where FAB deployed their kiosk and
the right to know the P&L performance of the kiosk.


7. The sales director very clearly pitched that the biggest payoff for the franchisees
comes after 2 years when FAB, the "public company," will buy out the franchisees'
kiosks for a multiple (from 1.5-5x) of their net asset value (defined as the accumulated
profits over the 2 years plus a guaranteed minimum asset value).


8. The sales director said that FAB "guarantees" a lowest payoff scenario of a minimum
90,000 RMB to the franchisees, who bear no risk of losing money at all.


9. In the best-case buyout scenario, FAB will buy each kiosk for as much as 500,000
RMB.


10. To complete the buyout, FAB will offer franchisees cash or common stock valued at
20% discount to the market price.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 27/51


The director of franchisee sales presented my investigator with this franchisee sales
brochure that included a basic term sheet that makes the following points:


1. Franchisee shall invest 80,000 RMB per kiosk.
2. Franchisee promises to achieve 20,000 RMB and 40,000 RMB profit targets in the first


and second years, respectively.
3. FAB and the franchisee share any profit above these profit targets.
4. FAB promises to buy back the kiosks at 1.5 to 5 times the accumulated profits over the


first 2 years plus a guaranteed minimum asset value.
5. In the base case where the kiosk achieves the minimum profit target, FAB would buy it


back for 200,000 - 500,000 RMB, using either cash or "free-trading" shares in "FU"
6. In the event that profit targets are not met, FAB agrees to buy back each kiosk for 1.5


to 2 times the guaranteed minimum asset value of 60,000 RMB.
7. Using the lower multiple: 1.5 x 60,000 RMB = 90,000 RMB guaranteed minimum return


of the 80,000 original investment per kiosk.


From an accounting standpoint, these buyback and minimum guaranteed investment
return conditions offered in the franchisee term sheet call into question FAB's kiosk
licensing revenue recognition policy, which records kiosk licensing revenue as deferred
revenue to be realized over 5 years.


If FAB is indeed promising franchisees a minimum guaranteed return on investment, the
sales of franchising licenses are really just a form of financing. The possibility that FAB will
repay the franchisee/investor with common stock makes the franchisee "investment" a
sort of convertible debt, secured by the kiosk. Obviously, FAB appears to be using its
common stock to stimulate franchisee kiosk investments to finance the growth of its kiosk
business. How should FAB account for guarantees made to the franchisee investors as
well as the potential future dilutive share issuances?


Assuming that FAB has made these promises to most or all of its franchisees, FAB has
potentially enormous undisclosed liabilities for guaranteeing minimum investment returns
to franchisees and undisclosed potential dilution from common stock issuable to its
franchisees.


Below are sample snapshots from my investigator's first recorded interview of FAB's
director of franchisee sales:

Conclusion


Based on the interviews and evidence that I collected, I conclude that FAB's business in
China is a tiny fraction of what it claims in its SEC filings. FAB's actual profitability would
be reduced even further if the company upgraded its pirated content to properly licensed
content (assuming that is even possible). Finally, FAB has potentially enormous
undisclosed liabilities for guaranteeing minimum investment returns to franchisees and
undisclosed potential dilution from common stock issuable to franchisees.
