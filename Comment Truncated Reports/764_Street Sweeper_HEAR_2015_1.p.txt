Turtle Beach: Recall And Seven Other Challenges Pose Significant
Downside Risk
Oct. 26, 2015 1:41 PM ET19 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Turtle Beach has begun recalling $6 million worth of its next-generation gaming
headsets, part of the core product.


The timing couldn't be worse. The company is already in the midst of discounting
older products, much like rivals that have recently seen their stock plummet.


Irrational exuberance surrounds the upcoming initial shipment of the secondary
product HyperSound. It's expensive, cumbersome and getting to market behind
effective, less expensive competitive models.


The company is associated with a financial firm that underwrites highly risky
companies and is dogged by many of these companies' hammered stock values.


Poor financials, consistent earnings misses, heavy insider selling and $6.6 million in
executive compensation add to the challenges, creating roughly 50 percent
downside risk.


After living on Easy Street for a month, even while feverishly discounting products, Turtle
Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR) is now quietly recalling ~$6 million in next-gen
products.


The recall of almost 60,000 China-manufactured gaming headsets began last week,
according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall came after
consumers reported mold on gaming headsets, posing a health risk.


The XO FOUR Stealth headsets were sold in stores and online this year from June to
September. Here's a snapshot of the government notice:

The recalled headsets, recently introduced for Xbox One console game systems, are core
to Turtle Beach. Gaming headsets account for nearly every penny of sales. This recall
represents just the very latest downside risk to Turtle Beach. Investors may find other
viewpoints here, but TheStreetSweeper presents other challenges poised to make turtle
soup of this stock.


Terrible Timing


Significantly, the recalled units are part of the next-generation headsets that the CFO says
were critical to the small sales hop to $22.6 million last quarter (though 6 months' revenue
fell 30 percent below last year).


"Strong consumer response to our expanded portfolio of next-generation headsets"
primarily drove that little quarterly improvement said CFO John Hanson.

The recall couldn't come at a worse time. Video gaming companies introduced the Xbox
One and PlayStation 4 in 2013 to try to wake up gamers who'd fallen asleep at their old,
no-longer-exciting consoles. Companies wanted to quickly offer headsets for these new
consoles. But Turtle Beach fell a little behind the curve, for instance, because it couldn't
get its hands on a headset adapter for Xbox One until March 2014, four months after the
system came out.


Meanwhile, gamers have been turning up their noses at old-gen game consoles and the
headsets that go with them. Rapidly.


"…the transition from prior-gen to next-gen consoles will and has put pressure on our
operating results and the decline in old-gen consoles and associated accessories
continues to be faster than we or analysts expected," said CEO Juergen Stark.


That means the company is forced to spend big bucks advertising old headsets and
tossing them into the bin at huge discount.


Discounting Pain


The company is stuck with a growing truckload of inventory: $37 million worth. Turtle
Beach has been forced to hold a fire sale. An Amazon search reveals discounts as high
as 70 percent.

Discounting can't be casually swept aside. Well-heeled first-party companies like Microsoft
(NASDAQ:MSFT) can command greater market share by discounting and bundling. But
that blue-light special discount essentially steals from smaller, cash-poor companies. Look
at how a couple of small HEAR rivals have crumpled as they faced heavy discounting.


Here's the LeapFrog (NYSE:LF) stock chart, showing an 84 percent drop this year:

The discount bin is also eating into Skullcandy (NASDAQ:SKUL) despite that company's
cushion of better margins of 42 percent versus Turtle Beach's low 15 percent margin.
Skullcandy's stock has fallen 28 percent this year.

Comparing Turtle Beach headsets with other companies' headsets, a couple of troubling
issues emerge. First, the influential PCGamer.com recently ran an article comparing the
best gaming headsets, here. Turtle Beach didn't even get a mention. And sales of $186
million fell significantly below the $205 million reported just three years ago. The dollar
share was 53 percent then. It's 49.1 percent now.


Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search trends show gamers are vastly
more interested in Microsoft's own gaming headset than Turtle Beach. Even Skullcandy
brand Astro attracts more interest. See below:

Next Thing: Cash Drain, Late To Market


What about the prospects of Turtle Beach's secondary product, HyperSound? The
company owes a lot - almost an 80 percent jump in stock price - to the CEO's mention of
an upcoming initial shipment of HyperSound Clear. But TheStreetSweeper is concerned
about the irrational exuberance surrounding this old, expensive technology whose chief
accomplishment is draining Turtle Beach.


The company has already sunk about $10 million on HyperSound directional speakers,
primarily on research and development, and appears on track to drain another $10 million
this year. When they do go to market, the units are expected to cost $1,500 and
anticipated to be used by people positioning the units near their television sets.

But, as an author beautifully explains, high price is the largest barrier to entry for hard-of-
hearing folks. If people want to plunk down over $1,000, they may be more likely to go
with hearing aids. In fact, research shows subjects vastly preferred the sound of speech
(shown in red below) heard through hearing aids over PSAPs.


(Source: audiologyonline.com)


If hard-of-hearing people prefer a PSAP (personal sound amplifier product), the market is
already flooded with competitors' cheaper products, suggests an audiologyonline.com
interview. Indeed, consumers can also buy a competitor's more mobile sound amplification
device for just about $70. A fresh rival is also undercutting Turtle Beach prices with a
couple of new audio transmitting devices for just $249 to $269.


Lawsuits: Uncertain Costs, Potential Stock Dilution


HyperSound technology ended up under Turtle Beach through a reverse merger in 2013
that an ongoing shareholder lawsuit alleges resulted in breach of fiduciary duty. This
litigation is costly, distracting and the ultimate decision stands as another question mark.


Another shareholder filed a lawsuit in February that could result in the redemption of his
stock. An unfavorable judgment could unleash the plaintiff's stock - worth around $15
million. So, the plaintiff's potential sale of millions of shares poses a massive risk of
dilution to stock held by other shareholders.

Money-losing Turtle Beach's pathway circled around MDB Capital, a firm which
underwrote Parametric Sound Corp. in 2012, just before it merged into Turtle Beach.
TheStreetSweeper has warned investors about a number of risky MDB-associated
companies, including Resonant ((NASDAQ:RESN) ~$14 TheStreetSweeper publication
day, now ~$3.90), Uni-Pixel ((NASDAQ:UNXL) ~$7 publication day, now ~$1.20 per
share) and ClearSign Combustion ((NASDAQ:CLIR) ~$6.79 publication day, now ~$5.80
per share).


MDB Capital is known for taking on extremely risky companies. We've seen so many of
these deals go south that we consider any MDB Capital association another great reason
to dash the other way. Indeed, Turtle Beach's stock ranged from $1.75 to $6.08 over the
past year and has fallen more than 38 percent since the 2012 MDB underwriting.


Poor Financials


Quarterly net revenue remained flat compared with last year, yet salary expenses and
losses rocketed.

Six-month comparisons more fully indicate the seriousness of the matter:

So, even before the recall, Turtle Beach reported increasingly negative earnings per
share, rising losses and deteriorating sales.

Who Loses; Who Wins?


While shareholders watch Turtle Beach's losses exceed last year's losses, executives are
rolling in compensation totaling $6.6 million.

What happened to the stock price during the time executives were pushing wheelbarrows
in to carry off their compensation?


The stock fell 78 percent:

Golden parachutes will land CEO Juergen Stark and CFO John Hanson gently and
prosperously upon their termination and resignation plans - handing them up to $1.2
million combined.


Insiders Selling Off Company Stock


Meanwhile, it looks like a big insider is cashing out. In the past year, even with the stock
as low as $2.21 per share, beneficial owner Carmine Bonanno has stayed as busy
dumping stock this year as last year. Earlier this month, Mr. Bonanno unloaded more than

96,000 shares.


It's sure not the first time insiders have pulled out the stops. Cofounders Mr. Bonanno and
Frederick Romano - who pulls down $1,635 per day working as the company's operations
and supply chain advisor - sold 371,500 shares to "a group of institutional investors" in
August 2014 as shares traded close to a 52-week-low following an earnings miss.


(Source: NASDAQ)


Earnings Misses Common


Looking at earnings misses, Turtle Beach has a bad habit of disappointing analysts. And
even if earnings uptick in the last quarter, analysts predict a 2015 earnings loss to
investors of $-0.29 per share. History suggests it won't even make that, as shown below:

(Source: Yahoo Finance)


Just that much more silliness for this stock with a ridiculous forward price to earnings of
84.75, and a $143 million market valuation.


Conclusion


Turtle Beach is wading into a big recall of next-generation headsets - presenting a giant
question mark on the ultimate monetary and reputation costs. Meanwhile, the company
deals with having to discount headsets more rapidly than expected while its market share
declines to 46 percent from 49.1 percent in 2013. At the same time, Turtle Beach losses
mount up by the multi-millions.


And TheStreetSweeper can't imagine its secondary product HyperSound living up to the
rushed, irrational exuberance that recently set the stock on fire.


Sure, HEAR argues the $1,500 HyperSound price tag is cheaper than hearing aids. But
HyperSound is late to market, already roughed up by much cheaper, effective alternatives.
Research shows people prefer the voice quality of hearing aids over all the PSAPs,
anyway. And let's face it. People can pop hearing aids into the ear and go. But no one's
going to drag along a pair of these 7.4-pound speakers and amplifier boxes the next time
they visit the theater or grocery store.


All considered, this Turtle Beach hot stock will get freeze-dried and we see over a 50
percent downside from here.
