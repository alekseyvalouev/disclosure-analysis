"Pacific Crest said it is skeptical about reports that Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) lost a client to
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) given they have a non-compete and Salesforce.com has
strong interest in the success of Veeva's platform."


This is comical!


From the SEC filed Veeva/SFDC re-seller agreement, material parts in bold.


1.1 Resale Rights. SFDC hereby grants to Reseller a nonexclusive, nontransferable
(except as set forth in Section 16.10), non-sublicenseable (except to Affiliates of Reseller)
right to market, demonstrate, resell and support OEM Services in connection with the
Reseller Application and as part of the Combined Solution, subject to all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the following


Gross Competition. Neither SFDC nor its Affiliates shall position or promote any third-
party Force.com application that would be competitive to the Reseller Application as
provided in Section 3.1 or in a substantially similar manner; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not prohibit third parties (excluding SFDC Affiliates) from creating and
posting any content on SFDC's AppExchange or on their marketing materials without
SFDC's consent. Neither SFDC nor its Affiliates will designate any other company
with an ISV alliance status that is equal to or greater than "Preferred" or "Premiere"
for the Target Market. With the exception of equity investments in [*] (provided that such
exception shall not limit any of SFDC's or its Affiliates' obligations under the other
sentences of this Section 4), SFDC will not make an equity investment in or buy another
company for the purpose of developing or promoting a Force.com application offering that
would be directly competitive to the Reseller Application in the Target Market. In addition,
neither SFDC nor its Affiliates will develop or promote Target Market-specific software
applications to compete with the Reseller Application in the Target Market; provided,
however, the foregoing portion of this sentence shall not restrict an SFDC
Customer's ability (or SFDC's or its Affiliates' ability, if on behalf of a specific SFDC
Customer) to customize or configure the SFDC Service in any way.


Skeptical? Have you heard of Google or EDGAR?
