Globalstar: LightSquared Filing Reinforces Worthlessness Of GSAT's
1.6GHz Band

Summary


Moelis assigns no value to the uplink band closest to GPS frequencies.


Since Globalstar’s 1.6GHz spectrum is even closer to GPS than LightSquared’s, its
worthlessness for terrestrial purposes is all the more assured.


Nothing has altered the reality that TLPS is an overhyped non-solution to a non-
problem – a conclusion increasingly endorsed by Wi-Fi industry observers.


Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) shareholders, desperate for validation, have recently seized
upon an unlikely source: the latest disclosure statement in the LightSquared bankrupty
case. Like Globalstar, LightSquared sought to repurpose its satellite-based spectrum
rights for terrestrial use, only to fail disastrously as a result of business-model
shortcomings and, most prominently, serious concerns about GPS interference. Still stuck
in bankruptcy court and mired in complex legal and regulatory disputes, the company has
not made any progress toward overcoming its interference challenges. Indeed, concerns
about its uplink spectrum have only grown, as illustrated by a July letter from the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, the federal agency tasked with
managing government spectrum use and advising the president on telecom policy.
Nonetheless, Globalstar cheerleaders became excited to learn that the investment bank
Moelis, acting on behalf of the bankrupt LightSquared and drawing in large part on the
results of the ongoing AWS-3 auction, had revised up its valuation of LightSquared's
spectrum assets. Since Globalstar's 1.6GHz MSS band is close to some of LightSquared's
uplink spectrum, then surely Globalstar should be worth more too!


Not so fast. Set aside the fact that Moelis's valuation is just one party's opinion and that
LightSquared's bankruptcy still hasn't been resolved. What's notable is that Moelis
effectively concedes that the uplink band closest to GPS frequencies is worthless. Since
Globalstar's 1.6GHz spectrum is even closer to GPS than LightSquared's, its
worthlessness for terrestrial purposes is all the more assured.

This conclusion is clear but requires some background. Moelis discusses two valuation
approaches: "the Current Spectrum Approach," which takes LightSquared "as is," and the
"Alternative Spectrum Use Approach." Under the as-is valuation, with LightSquared's
terrestrial rights still in limbo, all of the company's spectrum constitutes at best a deeply
out-of-the-money option. But under the alternative approach, which Moelis regards as
twice as valuable (based on the AWS-3 auction), LightSquared would reorganize its
spectrum holdings as follows:


A 5x5MHz paired block at 1632.5-1637.5 / 1670-1675 MHz
A 10MHz unpaired block at 1646.7-1656.7 MHz


But what about the rest of LightSquared's spectrum? In the words of the disclosure
statement, "The Alternative Spectrum Use Approach valuation analysis ascribes no
value to the 1526 - 1536 MHz, 1545.2 - 1555.2 MHz, and 1627.5 - 1632.5 MHz U.S.
spectrum" (emphasis added). Why not? What unites these spectrum blocks is their
proximity to the RNSS (radionavigation satellite systems) band that includes GPS.
Unfortunately for Globalstar bulls, these value-less blocks, under Moelis's analysis,
include the lower half of one of LightSquared's uplink band. As the diagram below
illustrates, Globalstar's MSS uplink band is substantially closer to the GNSS band than
this LightSquared uplink band. If Moelis "ascribes no value" to LightSquared's holdings
under its latest analysis, then surely any reasonable observer would draw the same
conclusion about Globalstar: for terrestrial use, its 1.6GHz spectrum has no value.
