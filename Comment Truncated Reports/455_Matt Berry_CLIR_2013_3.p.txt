Clearsign's Lies, Omissions, And One 'Bad Actor'
Feb. 7, 2013 9:11 AM ET58 comments
by: Matt Berry


Clearsign Combustion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLIR) "appears to be one of the first, if not
the first, in the nation to make use of the new JOBS Act." (The Seattle Times) Perhaps
this is only an ironic coincidence, but it's a shame that this new program had to start off
this way: Clearsign has no credible inventors to account for its "revolutionary" technology,
and that's why I believe that the Clearsign story has suffered a critical failure.


A recent attempt at a rebuttal to my earlier article has either omitted or neglected key
facts. Further evidence supports the key problem with Clearsign:


Without a doubt someone in Clearsign has lied about the business and science
experience of the Chief Science Officer ‒ the so-called "original inventor" of its
technology. Without the inventor, what claim does Clearsign have for a "revolutionary"
technology?
Material information has been withheld from Clearsign investors: the co-inventor on
Clearsign's "pending patent" found his name attached to a transparent technology
scam. A recent attempt at a rebuttal to this exposure has misrepresented the facts.


Additional evidence that I have gathered presents other problems:


Clearsign inked an agreement with John McFarland for Investor Relations work.
McFarland was permanently barred from the securities industry.
CEO Rutkowski and McFarland are both co-members of a separate investor relations
company which was formed this last June, just after McFarland got more than $50,000
worth of Clearsign shares and which was above and beyond the original agreement. I
have found no disclosures of this in Clearsign's filings.
MDB Capital Group underwrote Clearsign's IPO, whose S-1 contains false and
misleading statements.
MDB Capital Group professes expertise with patents and claims to have done due
diligence on Clearsign … yet Clearsign's original inventor faked patents. How could
MDB not know this?
MDB Capital Group claims to have helped Clearsign with investor relations during the
same time period that Clearsign's banned investor relations agent was active. FINRA
members such as MDB Capital Group are prohibited from having any association with
barred members such as John McFarland.

(Unless otherwise provided, source material for the above and following can be found in
the two slide shows, ClearSign's False and Misleading statements about David Goodson
and ClearSign's Omission of Material Fact Regarding Thomas Hartwick. A larger report is
also available. For more detail, please see my blog here.)


David B. Goodson


In a rebuttal to my article, Benjamin Padnos attempted to minimize the lies told in
Clearsign's S-1 filing and prospectus:


I will say that in my research, I did find there may have been some exaggerations in
David Goodson's biography in ClearSign's S-1 filing, as well as outright errors such
as wrong numbers of specific patents he holds with the U.S. Patent & Trademark
Organization (USPTO). I hate sloppiness, and don't have any inclination to excuse it
in this instance. But this minor bit of sloppiness alone is not enough to discard the
Company's fundamental story.


~ Seeking Alpha contributor Benjamin Padnos


But it is not just "sloppy." Someone has clearly lied in the S-1 Registration Statement - and
in a very serious way. With more research one finds that the problems with Clearsign's
original inventor and Chief Science Officer are not just with the false claim of having
collaborated with Nobel Prize winners, nor with the false patent claims, but with almost
every claim of having commercialized a technology. In fact, uncovering the history of
Goodson's "electric field" technologies reveals a disturbing pattern of deceit - both to
investors then and to investors now.


It matters because David B. Goodson is said to be the "original inventor" of Clearsign's
technology: ECC. He is also listed as an inventor on Clearsign's pending patents ‒ he's a
co-founder of the company, the largest shareholder, and a director. Here is a summary of
false, misleading and highly improbable claims made in the prospectus and S-1
Registration Statement.

Dr. Thomas Hartwick


Thomas Hartwick is the top-listed Technical Advisor for Clearsign's technology. He is also
listed on Clearsign's pending patents as co-inventor. But Hartwick was also the technical
advisor for John Rivera's technology scam at Sustainable Power Corp. John Rivera was
convicted of fraud, and central to the SEC's case were the false claims about his
technology ‒ the same technology that Hartwick was tasked with summarizing for
investors.

Seeking Alpha contributor Benjamin Padnos quotes Hartwick, telling us that Hartwick and
Rivera were not contemporaries. Hartwick supposedly even says that SSTP's technology
worked better than Rivera had claimed.


In Dr. Harwick's own words:


Regarding SSTP, Berry's assertions are totally incorrect. Rivera, the former CEO,
was thrown out by the good guy directors who wished to rehabilitate the company.
First, they had to find out if the technology was worth saving. So they got a contract
with Texas A&M to measure and characterize the conversion process and got me as
referee/advisor to critique the A&M results and comment on the business viability.
Surprise! The basic technology was even better than the Rivera claims, but the
company was too far gone with the lawsuits to recover. I never received my full
compensation. I was on the team opposing Rivera, not supporting him. He was
thrown off the board in Spring of 2009 before I even signed up to scrutinize the
manufacturing process in October. Any contention that I was in league with Rivera is
hardly credible...never even met the man. All of this is fully documented and
available for scrutiny.


~ Seeking Alpha contributor Benjamin Padnos


My Response: First, Rivera was running a technology scam, and Hartwick was there to
summarize the report on Rivera's technology for investors. It wouldn't matter if Rivera
were there or not.


Second, Rivera was indeed active in the winter of 2009 and beyond. He was the largest
shareholder of SSTP and his involvement was contemporary with Hartwick's involvement.
We have a very good inside-view of this technology scam, because at the precise time of
Hartwick's involvement, the SEC case against Rivera was ongoing. We have depositions
and exhibits that we can download from PACER.GOV. As for Rivera's involvement during
Hartwick's time, here are my two favorite pieces of evidence. These events take place
during and after Hartwick's name is used by SSTP.


1. The CEO sends an email to Rivera, conferring with him about a press release in which
Hartwick himself is featured.


2. Rivera grants voting rights by proxy to a newly appointed chairman. Then in a dispute
Rivera revokes that proxy and the now former chairman declares that he never really
had any power, but only took on additional liabilities. And the best part ‒ when he
resigns he feels it necessary to include Rivera in his notice.

These are events that occurred during and after Hartwick's presence. Needless to say,
Rivera was a de facto leader in this company.


Mr. Padnos investigates the "timeline" of Hartwick and Rivera's involvement, by asking
Hartwick. However, the evidence gathered from the court case presents a very different
perspective and perhaps explains why Hartwick was brought in at precisely this point in
time.


The SEC had requested an onsite examination of Rivera's technology. This was to be
performed by Tunstall Adams, Inc ‒ the SEC's expert witness in the federal case. Was this
a crisis point for those who knew that false claims were being made about the technology?
I ask because, the very next month, SSTP rushes out and signs an agreement with some
researchers from Texas A&M. They are to perform a research study of their own. Now
SSTP is in a race with the SEC.


Texas A&M finished its report in the fall of 2009. That's when Hartwick was brought in to
put together a "summary," to validate the technology, and to explain it to the layman. But it
wasn't your ordinary summary ‒ it was a kind of substitute report. See, the original Texas
A&M report was not shown to investors. It was declared "confidential." (Who would fall for
this?) What the investors received was a "summarized" version put together by SSTP's
science team, of which Hartwick was the head. Using Hartwick's name and prestigious
history, SSTP now declares that its technology has been validated and that it is preparing
the reactors for the commercial production of bio-fuel.


Then the SEC commissioned report comes out. It states very clearly that Rivera's
technology was not commercially viable.


[SSTP] "... got me as referee/advisor


to critique the A&M results and


comment on the business viability.


Surprise! The basic technology was


even better than Rivera claims." ~


Hartwick, according to Padnos.


"In conclusion, USSE/SSTP does not produce an approved


or certified liquid or gaseous fuel that is suitable for


commercial sale and use in reciprocating and combustion


turbine equipment." ~ SEC commissioned study which was


submitted as an exhibit in the case against John Rivera:


Case 5:08-cv-00245-DCB-JMR Document 61-28.


According to Padnos, Hartwick was quoted as saying that he was there to verify the
technology's business viability. Hartwick also said that the technology worked better than
Rivera claimed. But just when you think things couldn't get worse for the Hartwick story,

CEO Richard Rutkowski


Clearsign's CEO, Richard Rutkowski, signed an agreement with John McFarland for
Investor Relations services. However, John McFarland had been permanently barred from
the securities industry by FINRA.


Here are some of the official documents that shed light on the situation:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163741-clearsigns-lies-omissions-and-one-bad-actor 9/30


It is very difficult to make the excuse that Rutkowski might not have known about
McFarland's past. Just this last June, Rutkowski and McFarland joined up and formed a
separate Investor Relations company called, Ormont LLC. This might cause some
problems.


First, I have not found a disclosure of Rutkowski's relationship with McFarland.
Second, there is a sudden increase in McFarland's compensation in April, above and
beyond what was outlined in Clearsign's agreement. McFarland was to receive 4,500
shares for March (and each quarter thereafter), but a later filing declares that he
received 18,000 shares for March and April. That's 13,500 shares on top of the
agreement. At $4 a share, that would be more than a $50,000 bonus. Then in June,
McFarland and Rutkowski suddenly show up on the original formation record for an
investor relations company. Given that starting a business takes some planning, how
many months before the June formation of Ormont did Rutkowski and McFarland
agree to become partners in an investor relations company? How close together was
this agreement and McFarland's increase in compensation?
Third, McFarland's regulatory penalty, in legal terms, is called a "statutory
disqualification" and with that there are certain exemptions that Clearsign and
McFarland may not qualify for. There are also business relationships that FINRA
members are not allowed to have. For example, MDB Capital said that it performed IR
and PR services for Clearsign, but how could they do that without teaming up with
Clearsign's investor relations' man ‒ John McFarland?


It would take a legal team and an inside look into McFarland's role with Clearsign, MDB
Capital, investors, and retail brokers to know the extent to which Clearsign and others
might be legally vulnerable.


I don't wish to make light of the preceding, but I have to say however that one of the first
red flags for me was just the simple fact that Rutkowski, with no apparent experience with
combustion science, listed himself as an inventor on the first expression of Clearsign's
technology. What was he thinking? ECC was supposed to be a "revolutionary technology."
What is his name doing there? As an investor relations man, he is perfectly aware of the
role that the words "Patent Pending" have in boosting a stock price. After listing his name
on the patent ‒ as an inventor ‒ why should we believe anything he has to say?


What's a little more than ironic is that MDB Capital professes expertise with patents, says
it has its own patent database and patent experts. MDB Capital Group also claims to have
done due diligence on Clearsign and to have advised it on IP strategy. Yet Clearsign's
