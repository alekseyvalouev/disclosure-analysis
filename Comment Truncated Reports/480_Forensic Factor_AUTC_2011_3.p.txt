Dear PwC - Do
AutoChina's
financials pass the
smell test?

Dear PwC - Do AutoChina's financials pass the smell test?


 
Investors in U.S. listed Chinese companies have suffered sizable losses over
the last three months. There has been no shortage of blogs that have correctly
highlighted the widespread fraud in the Chinese RTO space. Had auditors
initially examined many of the publicly raised concerns, the irreparable
reputational damage may have never occurred. Ironically, the impetus for the
recent crescendo of losses seems to be the newfound sense of responsibility
by many auditors. With regulators demanding accountability, auditors appear
unwilling to put rubber stamps on Chinese financials. As a result, countless
Chinese companies have no auditor, no reliable financials, and huge
uncertainty about what actually exists. With the Bloomberg Chinese Reverse
Mergers Index declining over 40% since November 2010, it is no longer a
shock to see exchanges halt trading in Chinese stocks due to new accounting
scandals, auditor resignations, or accounting restatements. However, investors
appear to be extra vigilant to ensure they don't own the "next halted stock."
Many of these halted securities have experienced share price declines of at
least 60% once trading resumes. We continue to be mystified by the
complacent shareholder base in AutoChina, which very well could be the next
implosion if PwC refuses to certify the financials by June 30th.





In two past reports, The Forensic Factor (TFF) highlighted our concerns about
AutoChina's (AUTC) accounting and financial profile. With the foreign filer
deadline fast approaching, we want to again go on public record stating our

belief that AutoChina's new auditor, PwC Zhong Tian, has some major
questions that need to be diligenced. In this brief follow-up, TFF will NOT focus
on the shady related party transactions, the complicated organizational
structure, the absurd financial guidance and origination outlook, or the
massive and inexplicable funding gap the company currently faces. Instead,
TFF wants to revisit AutoChina's accounting issues in front of its year-end audit
deadline. As PwC, and other auditors, face massive liabilities (from large
investor losses and the appearance of negligence, malpractice and breach of
fiduciary duty), we implore PwC to focus on our past reports and the issues
below.[1],[2] TFF's research serves as public record that concerns were raised
to PwC regarding AutoChina's accounting and business model, and we hope
PwC will take their responsibilities seriouslyâ€¦. and it is not unreasonable to
assume that recent delays in filing audited financials are reflective of problems
PwC may have found.





AutoChina announced in mid-February that they would have AUDITED
financials filed in March, "We look forward to announcing our fully audited
2010 fourth quarter and year-end financial results next month."[3] This
timeframe is consistent with the filing of 2009 results, which occurred on
March 22, 2010. Yet, in March, not only were no audited financials filed,
AutoChina seemed to retract the previous reassuring statement by issuing a
new timeframe, "The company anticipates filing before June 30, 2011."[4]
While no explanation was provided for the delayed audited financials, TFF
would highlight an ominous research report from Chardan Capital on April 21
that may forebode problems with the financials.





Red Flag: Lead Underwriter "Suspends" Coverage


TFF is not the only voice that has expressed concern over AutoChina's audit.
Boutique investment bank Chardan Capital was the lead underwriter for the
IPO of the SPAC "Prime Acquisition Corp" on March 31, 2011. As the table
below highlights, Prime Acquisition and AutoChina have almost the EXACT
same management team.[5]

As one of its marquee investment banking clients, Chardan Capital faces an
understandable conflict of interest in covering AutoChina. Most investment
banks would never publish a negative report on a banking client unless
something was very wrong. As such, TFF was surprised to learn that
Chardan, only a few weeks after the Prime Acquisitions IPO, suspended its
rating and price target on AutoChina the day before a three day weekend.[6]
After reviewing the research report, it appears Chardan was not comfortable
with the 2010 audit following a discussion with management. There were no
details in the report explaining what management said to generate this
concern, but the analyst felt compelled to suspend his rating and price target
after previously defending AutoChina.





Halted Chinese Companies

Dozens of Chinese companies have been halted since early March, with a
handful already getting delisted. The auditor quality of these halted and
delisted stocks runs the gamut. Big 4 firms Deloitte & Touche and KPMG have
the not-so-distinguished pleasure of being involved with seven of these
companies. To date, AutoChina's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian,
has only been involved with one (although PwC's affiliate in Hong Kong was
involved in one also). It is unclear if PwC has a higher quality audit client list
or if they are more complacent than Deloitte and KPMG in identifying
accounting issues.

There are numerous parties that will face difficult questions in the coming
months from lawyers, regulators and authorities. Auditors of Chinese RTO
frauds face MASSIVE liabilities due to large investor losses and the appearance
of negligence, malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. One of the more
blatant examples of a Big 4 auditor breaching its fiduciary duty (or worse) is
KPMG's audit of China Integrated Energy (ticker CBEH). CBEH hired KPMG in
December 2010 to audit the company's 2010 results. On March 16th, 2011,
CBEH filed its 10-k with a clean audit opinion from KPMG.[7] That same day,
video surfaced that appeared to verify that CBEH was operating idle factories

and was in fact a fraud.[8] CBEH's stock had declined 75% year-to-date
BEFORE the shares were halted on April 20th. TFF has a tremendous amount
of respect for the Big 4 accounting firms and the accounting profession in
general. However, it appears that accountants have been complacent relating
to the massive fraud that has occurred in Chinese RTOs.


 
Auditor last line of defense for most investors


Most U.S. investors do not have the time, money, or resources to perform the
level of diligence required to flesh out these frauds (like video taping a facility
for three consecutive weeks). As a result, the auditors provide one of the last
lines of defense to protect investors. Auditing services are performed on behalf
of shareholders and for the integrity of the markets. Given the documented
concerns and red flags, TFF believes PwC should approach its audit with
intense rigor and be in a position to provide extensive documentation and
evidence related to its procedures. There have been many similar themes
across the RTO frauds, but some of the most glaring have been odd financial
statements that defy COMMON SENSE. Along these lines, TFF points out:





*It defies common sense that that AUTC has only 20 defaults out of more than
23,000 leases


*It defies common sense that a $1.7 million reserve is sufficient to cover over
$850 million of leases


*It defies common sense that a grocery store has provided hundreds-of-
millions of dollars of funding to AutoChina


*It defies common sense that the expense base is virtually non-existent for a
national network of 300 stores and thousands of employees


*It defies common sense that AutoChina accounts for its delinquencies as
"account receivables" and its related party debt as "accounts payable" and
"due to affiliates"

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/183220-dear-pwc-do-autochinas-financials-pass-the-smell-test 7/14


One thing is clear: AutoChina does not look like any leasing company that we
have encountered, and TFF believes the most likely reason is financial
statements that PwC will not be able to support. AutoChina's reported
financials are such an extreme outlier from the myriad of historical models
that any prudent investor should question the numbers. TFF's work continues
to support our original opinion that AutoChina has significant accounting issues
and questions. Below are some of the outstanding points that PwC will need to
address before any audit can be completed. This process could be the impetus
for a large restatement (at best) given the company's aggressive accounting
policies, or even a resignation from PwC (at worst).





I) The use of gain on sale accounting by an independent finance
company does not conform to GAAP


AutoChina utilizes gain on sale accounting that dramatically overstates
revenue and front-loads profits. AutoChina's accounting is so aggressive that it
allows for the recognition of a profit on day one for simply providing a loan!
This sales-type lease accounting generates substantial "paper" income but
significantly overstates and misrepresents economic income. Sales-type lease
accounting is reserved for manufacturers that have captive finance
organizations (allows a company to recognize revenue and gross profit on the
sale of the equipment that they manufacture). Since AutoChina's value
proposition is almost exclusively providing financing, it is unclear how the
company justifies this accounting treatment. AutoChina's revenue and income
would look dramatically different under GAAP lease accounting standards that
should be used by non-manufactures. For example, TFF has estimated in past
reports that revenue may be overstated by as much as 75%.





II) Credit and reserve makes little sense


Given the myriad of related party transactions, checkered history of
management and reliance on plain old common sense, TFF is extremely
skeptical towards AutoChina's claims of pristine credit quality. Based on TFF's
experience with leasing companies, transportation finance, auto finance, and

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/183220-dear-pwc-do-autochinas-financials-pass-the-smell-test 8/14


banks, we believe AutoChina's delinquencies and reserves are too good to be
true. History has shown that when a company can recognize profits by simply
providing a loan, there is very little incentive to stringently underwrite a credit.





A downside to recognizing profit upfront is future credit losses can provide a
huge downside surprise (reversal of recognized gains, costs of repossession,
and loss on collateral). TFF believes this concern is relevant given the recent
jump in delinquent accounts relative to the minuscule provision for loan losses.
In fact, TFF believes AutoChina has only reserved $1.7 million against nearly
$450 million of GAAP loans (and over $850 million of loans provided over its
history). According to the fourth quarter earnings press release, over 5.25% of
AutoChina's loans were delinquent as of December 31, 2010, versus only
1.11% at June 30, 2010. This deteriorating loan book paints a different picture
than the paltry reserve that represents less than 0.39% of the total lease
portfolio. Management claims to have experienced less than 20 defaults
(versus 23,000 leases) and cumulative losses of roughly 15 basis points. TFF
believes this would represent one of the greatest accomplishments in modern
finance, defying all conventional laws of lending.





AutoChina's credit experience seems to be even more amazing considering
recent press reports coming out of China. A recent New York Times article
highlighted the "brutally competitive" independent trucking market in China,
"Within China, thousands of small trucking companies, many of them family-
owned, compete by promising low-cost delivery. Then they overload their 18-
wheelers in dangerous ways, pay bribes to ward off highway inspectors and
hope to eke out tiny profits. Now, though, with global oil prices sending the
cost of fuel soaring, many truckers say they are heading toward bankruptcy.
Many of the factory bosses seem to recognize that there is an oversupply of
small trucking companies desperate for cargo" and "are reluctant to pay higher
fees to move goods."[9] A Financial Times article echoed this deteriorating
trend, "One problem is that there are so many independent truckers in China
that each feels they will lose business if they raise their prices even slightly."

Additionally, AutoChina's accounting for reserves and delinquent loans defies
financial logic and is treated differently than anything TFF has ever seen.
According to management, they place delinquent loans into accounts
receivable on the balance sheet and build their reserve as a bad debt expense
against the A/R. The company also classifies its related party debt as
"accounts payable" and "due to affiliates" on the balance sheet. TFF believes
this treatment does not conform to U.S. GAAP.





III) Why is the "reported" expense base so low?


In 2010, AUTC nearly doubled its store count (157 to 300), while growing
originations by 66%. Incredibly, their "sales and marketing" expense rose by
less than $1 million year-over-year. AutoChina's G&A increased $8.3 million
year-over-year, but stock compensation and the small increase in provisions
represented a good chunk of this change. TFF estimates that AutoChina only
has $23 million of total SG&A to support: over 200 members of management,
23,000 leases, 300 branches (with 6 to 7 employees per branch), and over
2,000 employees. The level of SG&A per employee suggests that AutoChina is
one of the most efficient lenders in the world. After backing out some easily
identifiable expenses from SG&A (including audit fees, stock comp,
depreciation and provision expense), TFF estimates that AUTC only spends
$9,000 to $11,000 per employee for all overhead, salaries, rent, insurance.
This level of expense (again) appears to defy common sense.





SG&A per employee  


2010 SG&A $23,850





Audit fees 481


Depreciation 1,000

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/183220-dear-pwc-do-autochinas-financials-pass-the-smell-test 10/14


Provision 1,000

Total SG&A excluding above 18,369





Estimated average employees 1,650


Estimated end employees 2,050





SG&A per employee $11,133


SG&A per employee $8,960





Through the first nine months of 2010, AutoChina's transactions with related
parties amounted to $865 million.[11] The related parties include a grocery
store chain owned by the CEO and Director, and businesses wholly or partially
owned by the CEO, his wife, his brother, and a Director. Given the sheer
volume of dollars shifting back and forth between these related parties, there
is ample opportunity for impropriety (such as hiding expenses and credit
losses). TFF believes some of these related party transactions are simply
unjustifiable and may represent a glimpse into more menacing activity. For
example, why is Kaiyuan Doors, a company owned by the CEO and his wife,
selling over $1 million of "trading materials" to AutoChina? Why is Wantong
Longxin, a company owned by the CEO's brother, selling $4.6 million of
"trading materials" to AutoChina? Why is Beiguo (the grocery story)
purchasing $19 million of "trading materials" from AutoChina? Why is Hebei
Kaiyuan providing office space to AutoChina rent free?[12]

IV) Interest expense / related party debt


Since AutoChina's inception, the largest provider of debt has been a grocery
store chain by the name of Beiguo Commercial Building Limited, which is
owned by AutoChina's CEO and another board member. But their grocery-store
partner is just one of many strange bedfellows that include unusual interest
free loans from the CEO and below market deals from a company owned by
the CEO's brother. AutoChina's complicated web of related party debt financing
has fluctuated wildly in recent periods. The fact AutoChina has been borrowing
from related party entities interest free, or even at below market rates,
significantly distorts the company's normalized income statement and
overstates earnings. Management emphatically responded to TFF's past
criticisms, stating a goal to reduce the reliance on related party funding. TFF is
convinced that if the related party transactions slow, the future income
statement will be dramatically different. But these assertions by management
appear to have no substance, and in fact we believe the company's actions are
in direct contradiction to their public promises.





On May 31, 2011, AutoChina disclosed it had entered into a $61.57 million
short-term loan with a firm called Honest Best on March 29, 2011. TFF
believes that Honest Best is 100% owned by AutoChina's CEO - a fact the
company failed to disclose in the 6K. If TFF is correct, and Honest Best is
indeed controlled by the CEO, then AutoChina has another regulatory problem.
Current reports from foreign private issuers are required to be "furnished
promptly after the material contained in the report is made public." In the
U.S., the SEC defines "promptly" as four days. TFF does not understand why it
took AutoChina over two months to provide this disclosure.





This reliance on related party transactions and debt can often be associated
with unscrupulous activity and/or exchanges which are clearly not arms length
in nature. TFF was not surprised to learn that "loans to related parties were
the most frequent type of related party transaction" that drove SEC
enforcement actions involving fraud. TFF believes PwC needs to examine how
AutoChina is accounting for it interest free and sub-market debt. Under APB
5/19/2018 Dear PwC - Do AutoChina's financials pass the smell test? - The Forensic Factor | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/183220-dear-pwc-do-autochinas-financials-pass-the-smell-test 12/14


Opinion No. 21, debt with below market interest rates must be discounted
(adjusts the principal of the debt to equivalent debt having the market rate of
interest). This discount flows through the income statement. Given the large
below market rate debt that is used to fund operations, AutoChina is
significantly understating its interest expense.





V) Compensation expense may be dramatically understated


TFF believes that AutoChina's compensation expense is significantly
understated because it does not include a realistic cash comp figure for the
CEO, nor does it include the earn-out that has been offered in lieu of cash
compensation. The stock compensation expense appears to be hidden from
investors because it is not reflected in the company's income statement.
AutoChina has used a large earnout to compensate its CEO. After examining
FASB guidelines, TFF believes these earnouts should be expensed through the
income statement and the existing treatment does not conform with GAAP.
Although there is some ambiguity, FASB has provided a framework for
expensing earnouts. Management's rationale for not expensing stock comp
relies on the argument that the earnout is "based on performance that is not
tied to employment," and that the "original intent" would compensate Mr. Li for
EBITDA growth. TFF believes that AutoChina is incorrect. Accounting is not
static, nor is it based upon intent. EITF 95-8 clearly states that earn-outs must
be classified as an expense if management is not compensated at levels
consistent with "other key employees." AutoChina's CEO was paid only $1.00
in salary with no bonus or other compensation in the last fiscal year. This level
of compensation would clearly be defined as well below "other key
employees."


As a result, the earnout should be considered "compensation" expense under
U.S. GAAP. The value of stock issued to Li in 2010 was over $57 million. If this
was expensed appropriately, AUTC would have had negative pretax earnings in
2010.





PwC - Is this worth the reputational risk?

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/183220-dear-pwc-do-autochinas-financials-pass-the-smell-test 13/14


The ball is in PwC's court. TFF can only hope that PwC has checked every box
and in doing so has found the magical elixir that would explain a financial and
operating model that seems to defy every basic element of common sense. It
is our belief that PwC will not be able to reconcile and support past financials.
If this is the case, AutoChina may represent just one more RTO that makes the
daily halt list, destroying investor capital and auditing reputations in the
process.
