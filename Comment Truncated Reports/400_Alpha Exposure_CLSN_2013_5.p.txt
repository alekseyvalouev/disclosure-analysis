Celsion Misleading Investors ... Again

We have previously criticized Celsion (NASDAQ:CLSN) for attempting to mislead
investors by highlighting subgroups and trumpeting subgroup analysis that fails to reach
statistical significance. Unfortunately, the Company still hasn't gotten straight with its
investors, as evidenced by this morning's press release, which appears to have at least
two potential problems with the data that is presented.


1. Celsion Reports Data from Only 47% of Enrolled Patients


Celsion would like investors to believe that Thermodox is a promising treatment for
recurrent breast cancer at the chest wall and the Company highlights that "Clinically
meaningful responses were reported in 14 of the 23 evaluable patients." While this may
seem like an impressive 61% response rate, the truth is that the 23 evaluable patients are
a minority subset of the 49 patients that were enrolled between the two trials. As can be
seen here, the trial at Duke enrolled 29 patients and as can be seen here, the DIGNITY
trial enrolled 20 patients. Between the two trials, 49 patients were enrolled. This is the
intent to treat population and is almost always the population across which clinical results
are measured. Celsion, however, decided to narrow the population to only 23 patients
(47% of the intent to treat population) and to evaluate this subset. This type of data mining
tends to produce positively skewed results and cannot be seen as meaningful.


2. Celsion Makes Up a New Metric


As a second point, we would note that Celsion is pointing investors to "clinically
meaningful responses," without defining for people what this means. Many outcomes in
cancer trials, such as Objective Response Rate, Overall Survival, and Progression Free
Survival have well defined meanings such that further explanation to investors is
unnecessary. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the term "clinically meaningful
responses," and we are left to wonder what exactly this means. In most Phase I trials that
report on an outcome rather than simply on safety and dosing, Objective Response Rate
is measured, because this can be observed more quickly than either Overall Survival or
Progression Free Survival. Objective Response Rate measures the percent of patients
who experience either a partial response or complete response to treatment. As
previously mentioned, this is best measured over the entire trial population (the intent to
