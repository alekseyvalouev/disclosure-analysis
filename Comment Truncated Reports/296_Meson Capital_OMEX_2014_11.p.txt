Odyssey Marine: Shrinking Cash Position Fails To Cover Current Bills,
CEO Greg Stemm Must Go

Summary


OMEX cash declined by $25.8mm (to ~$6mm) in Q1 alone, after making required
$13mm debt payments and >$10mm cash burn.


Estimated May 13th (today) cash position between $400k and $3.3mm fails to cover
$6.5mm of current cash liabilities estimated due within 3 months.


OMEX appears to have converted some or all of $2,347,826 Additional Notes after
March 31st into stock at ~$1.80/sh to preserve cash, contrary to CFO statements to
repay in cash.


New $10mm Credit Line only can be drawn AFTER gold salvaged from SS Central
America and appraised: unclear how OMEX can make July payroll without a rapid
cash injection.


Drastic times require drastic action: OMEX Board needs to consider action to
replace CEO Greg Stemm.


Though I have not yet been accused of being an optimist with respect to Odyssey Marine
(NASDAQ:OMEX), even I was shocked by the excessive level of cash burn and increase
in share count in this most recent 10-Q. It appears that without a rapid injection of capital,
OMEX would be unable to make payroll: potentially as soon as this coming month.


The Directors' Dilemma


While I obviously disagree with the business practices and CEO's conduct at Odyssey
Marine, I did have the pleasure to meet with the OMEX Chairman Brad Baker and Lead
Director Max Cohen at a recent NYSE event. I say (truly without sarcasm) that they are as
reasonable, pleasant, and mature as any directors I've met and I have sincere sympathy
for their situation.


The CEO and his management team runs a company, not the Directors: whose primary
job is to hire and monitor the CEO. I would not be surprised if the Directors were as
stunned as I with the disappointingly high cash burn this last quarter. I have myself been in

similar difficult situations that they appear to facing at the moment. So while I will leave it
to the large shareholders to file 13D's and am short the stock, I would say a careful
examination of the CEO position is warranted in the board room.


While CEO Greg Stemm's PR background may give him a certain competitive edge in the
business of fertilizer production; if OMEX is to transform itself into a phosphate miner, new
leadership appears necessary with a stronger focus on cost controls.


With that, here are some questions that I would like to be able to ask on the coming
conference call at 11am est today, if only they were open to more than just the Craig
Hallum and Lake Street bankers eager for underwriting fees!


How Does OMEX Intend to Address their Rapid Cash Burn and Negative Working
Capital?

How Did the Share Count increase after March 31, 2014?


Despite "non-dilutive" financings such as Mako/Oceanica, Share-count is rapidly
increasing including at least 828,958 shares SINCE MARCH 31, 2014 and 5.9mm shares
(7.5% dilution) in the last 12 months.


May 2, 2014: 84,786,098


February 26, 2014: 83,882,577


October 25, 2013: 83,587,243

April 18, 2013: 78,870,929


The date listed in the 10-Q for share count is May 2, 2014. Was the full $2,347,826
principal remaining on the "Additional Note" (that was indicated to have been paid off in
full in this PR) converted into shares rather than paid in cash (as indicated previously)?
What was the end result for this note in terms of cash and stock conversion?


Do the Fifth Third $10mm Credit Line Collateral Requirements apply before or after
your 45% share of SS Central America potential recovery?


According to the loan agreement, you require collateral gold to be recovered before a
draw down, are these numbers pro-rata for your 45% share or gross?


2.6. Loan Disbursements. The Loan proceeds shall be reserved by Lender and disbursed
to Borrower under the following procedures:


(NYSE:A) Interest Reserve Account. At closing, the sum of $500,000.00 of the Loan
proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to an interest reserve account #7420836376 with
Lender (the "Interest Reserve Account"). All accrued interest payments payable under the
terms of the Note shall automatically be debited from the Interest Reserve Account. The
Interest Reserve Account is hereby pledged as additional security for the Loan.


(NYSE:B) Loan Advances. Under the terms of the AON Insurance Policy, as the Valuable
Cargo is salvaged from the wreck, Borrower is obligated to deliver to the Odyssey Cargo
Insurer a detailed inventory of the Valuable Cargo (the "Cargo Reports"). Copies of the
Cargo Reports shall be delivered to Lender. Lender will make Advances of Loan funds to
Borrower upon verification of the Valuable Cargo based on the Cargo Reports at the
following Advance Rates:


(NYSE:I) $2,000.00 per coin for any $20 Double Eagle (for years 1850 through 1857), for
the first $5,000,000.00 in Advances under the Loan. After the first $5,000,000.00 is
advanced on the Loan, the Advance Rate shall be $1,000.00 per coin for any $20 Double
Eagle (for years 1850 through 1857) until the remaining $5,000,000.00 is advanced.


(ii) for each gold bar, 50% of appraised market value (verified by a 3rd party appraiser
reasonably acceptable to Lender) for the first $5,000,000.00 in Advances under the Loan.
After the first $5,000,000.00 is advanced on the Loan, the Advance Rate for each gold bar
shall be 25% of the appraised market value.

How long will the SS Central America archaeological preservation phase and site
mapping take? Will OMEX's apparent short term cash needs allow a proper
preservation?


Given that the Fifth Third $10mm credit line only can be tapped against artifacts
recovered, how will the balance of preservation and rapid recovery given the cash burn be
balanced to preserve the site?


OMEX converted the Neptune $500k note from Q3 2013 - How did it determine a fair
conversion ratio?


The 10Q mentions that during April 2014, OMEX converted to Class A voting shares at
$12.00/share which is higher than the $10.00 per share (+150% liquidity preference) that
Neptune was attempting to raise capital at around the same time. Why did OMEX appear
to get a much worse deal than smaller, arms-length investors?


Why has OMEX not filed a NI 43-101 Report as Other Mining Companies Do?


It is well known that the gross tonnage of resources, particularly for something as low
value as phosphate (~$105/tonne) is a very small piece of the economic value. The level
of impurities that need to be removed; infrastructure; processing costs, environmental
impact, etc. all need to be considered whether something has a positive economic value
at current commodity prices. Why has OMEX chosen not to file this information for
shareholders at this time and when does it intend to do so?


When will you provide more details on the "Commodity Wreck Program"?


Language from the previous 10-Q has been changed substantially indicating further
delays. When will shareholders receive more information?


10-Q Filed Nov 2013 (when the SS Central America was already in the works according to
the current press release):


If the testing of the new ROV is successful in the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect to
perform reconnaissance and salvage planning trips to one or more commodity shipwrecks
in the first half of 2014.


Current 10-Q:


Depending on the availability of recovery ships, expert off-shore project managers, and
equipment, we plan on pursuing further commodity shipwrecks in the near and medium
term.
