LDK Misrepresents Date of


Former Employee’s Report


On October 4, 2007 LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK) issued a


press release refuting a former employee’s reports of


overvaluations in the company’s inventory reporting. The


press statement identi�ed the employee as Charley Situ and


claimed that he was “terminated for cause on September 25,


2007.” LDK did not provide a speci�c date for Mr. Situ’s


report, but stated that the company learned of the


allegations “a few days ago.”


The press statement insinuated that Mr. Situ’s comments


were an angry reaction to his termination. On October 9,


LDK issued a related statement that characterized Mr. Situ as


a “disgruntled, former employee.”


In truth, LDK learned of these inventory problems at least


three months before they were publicized. Mr. Situ was


simply doing his job as a member of LDK’s accounting sta�


and he publicized his criticism only after the company


refused to correct these problems.


On June 26, Henry Tsai of Morgan Stanley requested certain


due diligence information from Mr. Lai. Mr. Lai then


forwarded the request to his sta�, including Mr. Situ.
