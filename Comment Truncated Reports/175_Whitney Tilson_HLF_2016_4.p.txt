Herbalife's Shocking Confession

Summary


Herbalife just confessed that the numbers it reported in the last two quarters for one
of its most critical metrics, Active New Members, were hugely overstated.


This is terrible news for three reasons: the numbers are much worse, it calls into
question the company’s internal systems (and perhaps integrity).


And it highlights that Herbalife is so complicated that not even the company itself
can get its arms around it.


Shareholders, analysts and regulators should demand that management
immediately answer a number of important questions.


The Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) saga has had so many twists and turns over the years that I
thought I'd seen it all -- but I was wrong...


Herbalife just confessed in an 8-K filed early this morning that the numbers it reported in
the last two quarters for one of its most critical metrics investors and analysts use to
evaluate the company, Active New Members, were hugely overstated due to “database
scripting errors” and “quarterly aggregation issues.”


I'll give you three guesses which direction almost all of the errors are… And the
adjustments aren't small -- they're huge. Here are the highlights (lowlights): 


In Q4 ‘15


The company reported that "Worldwide, active new members' excluding China was up
16.7 percent in the quarter". The actual number: +3.2%.
In the U.S., the company reported a 71.0% increase. The actual number: +30.7%.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company reported a 44.0% increase. The
actual number: +17.7%.


In Q3 ‘15

The company reported "On a worldwide basis excluding China total number of new
active members was up 21.0% compared to the prior-year period." The actual number:
+8.7%.
In North America, the company reported a 33.0% increase. The actual number: +1.8%.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company reported a 34.0% increase. The
actual number: +10.2%.


For the entire year (2015)


The company reported that "[Worldwide active new members, excluding China] up
8.3% for the full year." The actual number: +3.4%.


Why This Is Terrible News


I’m sure Herbalife bulls will say that: 1) This doesn't affect reported financials (or so the
company claims); 2) Active New Members are still growing (albeit at a slower rate); and 3)
In two countries (Mexico and Brazil), correcting the errors slightly increased growth. 


But anyone who views this new disclosure as anything but terrible news for the company
is kidding themselves for three reasons:


1. The much-worse number undermine management's claims that the business is getting
better;


2. It calls into question the company's internal controls and systems (and perhaps
integrity); and


3. It highlights that Herbalife is so complicated that not even the company itself can get
its arms around it.


Active New Members Is a New, Made-Up Metric


It’s ironic that this metric is causing trouble for Herbalife because Active New Members
isn’t a GAAP number – rather, it’s something the company just made-up a few months ago
and first started using on its Q3 conference call in November, supposedly as evidence that
things were getting better (kudos to Quoth the Raven, who noticed this and asked shortly
thereafter, “Why is the company using a term called “active members” on its latest
conference call that does not appear in any filings or any previous conference calls and
has not been defined?”) It really says something when you can’t even get your made-up
metrics right!
