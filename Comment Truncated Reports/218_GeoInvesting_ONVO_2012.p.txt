Note: This article has been corrected to reflect that the date for lockup expiration is
unknown.


Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) was added to our speculative screen on
February 28th 2012 at $1.65. We stated:


ONVO Just completed a reverse merger with a company focused on the development
of bio-printing technology for research and medical applications.
Concurrent with its reverse merge, the company was able to raise $6.5 million.
ONVO was beginning to attend investor conferences.


On June 25, 2012, we alerted our Premium members that we were taking a short position
in ONVO shares.


Look Out Below


Since February 28, 2012 ONVO has skyrocketed, reaching a high of $10.90 on June 18,
2012. We see little fundamental reason to explain why the stock has made such an
aggressive move. But we believe that shares could get destroyed once an S-1 filed on
June 13, 2012 goes effective. This will allow investors who bought shares on the cheap at
$1.00 per share in three private placements (see pg. 13 of the S-1) that took place in
February and March of 2012 to begin liquidating their positions. As we will soon discuss,
the amount of ONVO shares that could hit the market is massive compared to its current
outstanding share count.


The Big Elephant in the room: Details in an S-1 filing could lead to a free fall in
ONVO shares


The biggest reason to conclude that ONVO shares could implode is due to the fact that
the company just filed an S-1 that, when it goes effective, could lead to massive
shareholder selling.

Side Bar about the Offering Process


An S-1 or S-3 is filed to allow:


A company to offer new shares to the market


Certain company shareholders to sell their stock.


However, the SEC must review the filing(s) and designate them effective before shares can be sold


related to the filing(s). Individuals that invest in private placement are often restricted from selling


their shares until an S-1 is filed and goes effective. This restriction often ranges from 90 to 180 days.


ONVO's outstanding share count is around 44 million. Fifteen million Shares (most of
which were part of the 2012 private placements) have been locked up (unable to be sold),
but will be eligible for resale once the S-1 is effective. Furthermore, 16.7 million in-the-
money warrants (with an exercise price of $1) could also be set free when the S-1 goes
effective, leading to significant dilution. Shares outstanding would increase 61% to 60.4
million. This calculation does not even include 7.44 million shares:


896,256 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, at a
weighted average exercise price of $0.08 per share, which were issued under the
company's 2008 Equity Incentive Plan prior to this offering; and
6,553,986 shares of common stock which remain available for grant and possible
subsequent issuance under the company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.


In any event, a whopping 32 million shares will be eligible to hit the market soon. We don't
know when the SEC will deem the S-1 effective, but the company has agreed to use its
reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within 180 days of
the S-1 (registration statement) filed on June 13, 2012. (see 8K/A, February 8, 2012, page
62, Registration Rights Agreement). Given the sharp run-up in ONVO shares, once the S-
1 does go effective we are betting that the investors in the 2012 Private Placement will yell
fire and rush to the exits as soon as they are able to sell per the terms of the private
placement…


“Lock-up Agreements


In connection with the Merger, each of the officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of
our Common Stock and certain employees and affiliates of the Placement Agent have
agreed to “lock-up” and not sell or otherwise transfer or hypothecate any of their shares
for a term equal to the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months from the Closing Date of the
Merger; or (ii) six (6) months following the effective date of the Registration Statement

registering the shares of Common Stock included in the Units as well as the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants and the Bridge Warrants.”
(8K/A, February 8, 2012, page 9).


In this volatile market, wouldn't you seriously consider locking in a return of a $9.30 stock
that you own with a cost basis of $1.00 and associated warrants also with a cost basis of
$1.00? We do find it odd that the stock is pumping into the S-1 registration leading us to
postulate that the market has not realized that ONVO has filed the S-1.


We believe that the market will change its tune on ONVO once it realizes that a massive
amount of shares may need to find liquidity for 190 potential sellers listed in the S-1!


So, Why Have ONVO Shares Dramatically Risen?


We have noticed that companies that are able to raise capital in conjunction with their
reverse merger transactions sometimes perform well in the near term, possibly due to a
sense of legitimacy that investors may feel arises from "institutional backing." ONVO was
able to raise total net proceeds of $11,593,065.91 in its February and March 2012 private
placements.


Adding to ONVO's air of legitimacy, it claims to have:


"Collaborative research agreements currently in effect with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and
United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR)"
Reported 2011 revenues of around $1 million.


ONVO's business description also has an appealing futuristic feel to it:


"…Organovo Holdings, Inc. develops NovoGen three-dimensional human tissue
printing technology for creating tissue on demand for research and surgical
applications. Its NovoGen 3D printing technology is a platform that works across
various tissue and cell types. Organovo Holdings, Inc. serves physicians and
researchers involved in the fields of cardiovascular medicine, medical research, and
transplant medicine..."


In laymen's terms, ONVO's technology uses real human tissue in the application of
research and surgical procedures.


Regardless of the "wow" factor present in ONVO's business description, we believe
reasons exist to exercise extreme caution when considering ONVO shares as a near-term
long investment option.

1. With such a "great technology" and relationship with two behemoth pharma companies
(PFE, UTHR), why did the company choose a reverse merger transaction to go public,
rather than an IPO transaction?


2. We consider the collaborative investment to be peanuts ($688,000 in 2011). While it is
great that reputable firms have allotted funds toward ONVO, in the scheme of things
this amount is such a small nut for these large companies.


3. The majority of the 2011 reported revenues came from what we consider potentially
non-operating sources (collaborations and grants). Pure product revenue was a mere
$223 thousand.


4. The meaningful commercialization of ONVO's technology from a revenue view point
seems to be well into the future and would probably require a constant amount of
funding.


5. The stock is selling at a market cap of over $400 million compared to revenues of
around $1 million.


Quotes from company filings amplify some of these issues:


1. It does not appear that ONVO will generate meaningful sales and profitability in the
foreseeable future:

"…As of March 31, 2012, we had devoted substantially all of our efforts to
product development, raising capital and building infrastructure. We did not, as of
that date, realize significant revenues from our planned principal operations.
Accordingly, we are considered to be in the development stage…"


"…We have generated operating losses since we began operations, including
$1,338,694, $3,964,610 and $1,329,130 for the year ended December 31, 2010
and 2011 and the three months ended March 31, 2012, respectively, and as of
March 31, 2012, we had an accumulated operating loss of $43,772,138. We
expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several
years as our research, development, and commercial activities increase. The
amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are
uncertain…"


"…We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses, and
expect to incur significant additional operating losses…"


"…In the United States and most foreign countries, we will be required to
complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory
approval to market the product…"


2. Constant dilution seems like a certainty:
"…We need to secure additional financing to support our planned operation…"


Weak Auditor Raises our Red Flag


The most recent PCAOB Inspection of ONVO's auditor, Mayer Hoffman McCann, does not
lift our confidence


"…The deficiencies identified in one of the audits reviewed included a deficiency of
such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it
issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient competent evidential matter to
support its opinion on the issuer's financial statements..."


Valuation:


It is easy to get excited about a company like ONVO that is attempting to make strides in
medical research, but we think the valuation, given the facts, is insane.

A bullish ONVO Seeking Alpha article mentioned two comparables, Scolr Pharma Inc
(NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS). Both firms generate significant
revenues, are profitable and are selling at market cap to sales ratios of 5. Both of these
companies serve the three-dimensional (3D) printer market, so we are not sure why the
author even used them as comparable to ONVO. Regardless, the author should realize
that ONVO, a company with minimal revenues, is selling at a market cap to sales ratio of
over 500, assuming all in-the-money warrants are exercised!


We believe a more appropriate comparable would be a direct competitor mentioned in
ONVO's S-1 filing, Advanced BioHealing, Inc. Advanced BioHealing planned an initial
public offering in May of 2011, but chose not to when Shire Plc agreed to buy the company
a day before the biotechnology company was to go public. The company had planned to
offer 13.4 million shares, priced from $14 to $16 and would have had 39.8 million shares
outstanding, giving its shares a market-cap of around $600 million or a market-cap to
sales ratio of 4. Advanced BioHealing achieved 2012 revenues of $140 million and was
profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Investors can view the Advanced BioHealing May 16,
2011 prospectus here. Armed with this data, we can derive an approximate value of
ONVO's shares of it were to IPO today:


ONVO's 2011 revenues ~ $1 million
ONVO's market-cap assuming all warrants are exercised: 60 million outstanding
shares times current price per share of 9.1 = $546 million
ONVO's market-cap to sales ratio >500


In making a casual observation, we believe it is ridiculous that the valuation ($546 million)
of a company with virtually no revenues is on par with a top tier company with meaningful
revenues that is profitable. But we will still give ONVO the benefit of the doubt.


Let's be foolishly optimistic and assume that ONVO will accomplish the unthinkable and
generate $45 million in revenues in 2012, which matches the revenues Advanced
Biohealing, inc. achieved after its first full year of product commercialization.


Let's also assume that investors are willing to pay four times our revenue 2012
assumptions. Doing this yields a valuation scenario of $3.0. ($40 million in sales times 4
divided by 60 million shares).


If you wanted to believe that ONVO is going to revolutionize its industry then let's get
crazy and believe that investors will be willing to pay eight times sales, or $6.0.
