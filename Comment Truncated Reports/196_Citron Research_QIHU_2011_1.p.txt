On May 2, 2011, Citron reported on Sky-Mobi
(NASDAQ:MOBI) when the stock was $18.  Citron
placed a price target of $3 on the stock, pointing
out the company's outdated business model and
documenting its gross representations of itself to
Wall St.   Well, Sky-Mobi kicked and screamed. 
They held a conference call to refute our critique,
and multiple analysts upgraded their stock ratings
and raised targets.  Not more than 4 months later,
despite the protests, the MOBI traded at $3 — not
because of Citron, but rather the inevitable fate of
their business model's value.


Citron explores today a company with many
similarities, Qihoo 360 (NASDAQ:QIHU).  We
estimate that it is headed to $5 per share,
more than 75% below its current trading
range.  Sky-Mobi and Qihoo have both
intentionally misrepresented their businesses to
Wall St in the hope of sustaining exaggeratedly
high market capitalizations, but in both cases
Citron's analysis points decisively to the conclusion
that their best days are behind them, not in front
of them. 


Qihoo went public at the right time.  In the spring
of 2011, all Chinese internet stocks were entering
bubble territory.  SINA was approaching $150 per
share and YOKU was over $50.  With scant
revenues, Qihoo claimed some bold benchmarks in
their prospectus and their most recent quarterly
statement.  Once you have read our findings, you
will see those claims in a different light. 


   Corporate History


QIHU publishes a browser that has gained
considerable market share in China over the years
because it is bundled with anti-virus software (In
reality, this was simply a customized version of
Google's Chrome, bundled with anti-virus


technology mostly licensed from 3rd party
providers, Qihoo's R&D has been historically
minimal).  In fact, 2008-2009 the company had
generated the bulk of their revenues selling anti-
5/18/2018 Citron Reports on QIHOO 360 (NASDAQ:QIHU) – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-qihoo-360-nasdaqqihu/ 3/14


virus protection, a revenue stream that rapidly
dwindled to zero.  After realizing that this was a
dead-end business model, in the Q4 2009, QIHU
began to give away its software, selling ads on its
default home page and referring search requests
to Google for a revenue share, as do thousands of
other websites.


So this is where they are today, a web 1.0 brand
with a web 1.0 business model that is hoping (and
claiming) to be moving into mobile, cloud
computing, and search — all businesses in which
they are years behind and have zero present-
day market share.


Before going into their revenues and business
model, let's address those big market share
numbers that are thrown in the face of the
investment community on page 1 of their
prospectus.  Those numbers are greatly
exaggerated or misleading to say the best. 
 According to their prospectus and recent filings
they claim :

It sounds impressive, but the problem is that
it is so far from the truth.


   The Numbers That Really Count


 


The company boasts they have "over 300 million
active users", "80% penetration", and are "the 3rd
largest Chinese internet company by active user
base".  We find that, based on independent
metrics, the truth shows no resemblance to that.


What does their biggest customer think?


More than 21% of QIHU's revenues are derived
from Google, primarily be referring search
queries.  According to Doubleclick ad planner as
powered by Google, 360.cn is the 21st most
visited site in China with a reach of only 10%.

(Note:  There are many companies with higher
rankings and dramatically lower valuations on this
list. ) 
 


For the sake of comparison in this report, we will
compare Qihoo to SOHU and FENG.  Two publically
traded Chinese Internet Companies who have ad
based models similar to Qihoo.

This 10% reach estimate would take 360.cn into

But Google's AdSense ranking for QIHU's site is
actually high next to Alexa, which shows 360.cn as
the as the 35th ranked site in China.

   Valuation Comparison QIHU and
SOHU


 


Now look at the comparative valuations of SOHU
and QIHU.  SOHU is widely acknowledged as direct
competition to QIHU.  The below chart shows how
ridiculous their comparative valuations are.   We'll
also look at FENG, which outranks QIHU on every
metric, but in the same ballpark.

*   What makes comparing these 2 companies
even more ridiculous is the mindshare
perspective.  SOHU is number 7 on the Google
Doubleclick ranking and number 9 on Alexa
respectively.  From point of few of internet
ranking, the gap from #7 to #21 is massive –
about 3 to 7-fold in terms of overall web
presence.  And in addition, SOHU owns 65% of
SOGOU.com, a search site which on its own
outranks QIHU in both Alexa and Doubleclick. 


Even the Mirae analyst admits when it comes to
360.cn growth:


       The share is still growing but it is not growing as 


So when these numbers are reduced to a bottom
line, here's what you get when you invest $1000 in
each of these companies' stock:

For those of you who want to bang the table and
say that QIHU should be given premium because it
is not just an ad seller but rather they have
security products, we included their arch nemesis
Kingsoft.

When comparing these companies, QIHU
should be trading at $5 a share, if we are
being generous .. very generous.


    In Management’s Own Words!


I am sure many of you are saying, "OK, Citron,
that is the bear case, but what does management
have to say about this?"  


Here is a link to an interview given by Zuoli Xu,
CFO of QIHU along with Yu Yao, their VP, in which

management admits their lack of a current
compelling business model and describes their
hopes for the future.  When Citron reads this
interview, it seems more like the banter of an
internet startup company knocking on doors to
raise money  — not that of an established $2.5
billion dollar internet standard bearer.

    Can you Trust Top Leadership ? 
MUST READ


QIHU's CEO is a gentleman named Zhou Hongyi. 


Before he founded Qihoo, he founded a company
called 3721 which became one of China's first
search engines that he sold to Yahoo in 2003 for
$120 million. " But 3721′s software had become
popular by lodging itself in computers as spyware.
It introducing pop-windows, bedeviling its users —
and some would say it introduced spyware into
China."

at-qihoo-nemesis/
[http://venturebeat.com/2006/11/03/yahoo-china-hits-back-
at-qihoo-nemesis/]
 
Because of his "arrogance" and inability to hire
English speaking workers and be trusted Zhou was
forced out of Yahoo, which as you can imagined
ended in a series of lawsuits.  Zhou Hongy's
reputation to be trusted got so bad that in late
2010, before China internet mania struck, it was
though that Qihoo would never be able to go public
because of their CEO, and the possibility that they
have not left their spyware roots behind them.  In
something that we have never seen, Zhou's
reputation got so soiled that Yahoo CEO
encouraged western investors as recent as
December 2010 "not to trust his old acquaintance
from China".

If Qihoo was a US internet company, it could
never have gone public because of its
litigation history and questions surrounding
its business model.  Citron's $5 is generous.
 Qihoo should actually be trading at a
considerable discount to any comparable
valuation strictly on the questionable nature
of management's judgment, as described by
Citron, but rather by many internet business
leaders in China as well as the courts.

id=20101222000107&cid=1102]


As QIHU was preparing for its IPO, there corporate
actions resembled those of a company fighting for
its survival.  The browser was losing market share
and they were becoming insignificant in the rapidly
changing face of the Chinese internet market. 
QIHU's choice of action was to try to muscle
competitors off the desktop.  Its installations
forced users to uninstall competitor’s products,
sometimes with misleading prompts.   This led to a
very ugly public squabble, with accusations of
spying and leaking users private information, as
well as deliberately releasing malware.  As the
attached link shows, QIHU went to war with
leading instant message platform QQ (Tencent), a
major anti-virus competitor Kingsoft, and search
leader BIDU.


Despite all of their public complaints, they wound
up on the losing side of all three battles.

[http://english.caixin.cn/2011-04-
20/100250564.html]


The one lawsuit that foretells the desperation of
management is one in which the QIHU CEO was
sanctioned by China's courts for defaming
Kingsoft's CEO on his personal blog in over 45
entries.  The court ruling required him to pay
damages and publish a letter apologizing and
recanting his libelous claims.

If these had been the actions of a US
company, it would NEVER have been allowed
to IPO! 


RE Management — The bottom line is this: 
Given the utter lack of reach for US
regulatory agency protection of shareholders
interests against malicious and deceptive
corporate actions in China, can this person be
trusted as the basis of an investment at all ?


  Qihoo's “mobile” business


The only thing more disturbing than skewed
numbers are boldfaced lies.  In both the
prospectus and quarterly filing from the company
refers to themselves as "the leading mobile
security provider in China". 


Does anyone believe this?.  Qihoo is not even a
current participant in the mobile security space,
aside from a claim last month to have launched
mobile internet browsers.  The fact is to date it has
generated 0 revenue from mobile services. 
This fact is indisputable from the company's
most recent 10-Q.

We see no less than nine marketshare combatants
in June 2011, with Qihoo nowhere to be seen.  Is
this a picture of "leading China's nascent mobile
device security market?


    So what is left here?


Once you get past all the rhetoric and “netspeak”,
you are left with a web 1.0 company that publishes

a browser that at one time was getting a lot of
installs, but is now hustling to try and find its place
in a brutally competitive and fast changing internet
landscape, out-invested and out-gunned by larger
competitors. 


With no disruptive technology and no fast
growing properties (such as Weibo,  Yoku, or
Q+)  Qihoo has …. a browser….that is it…
plain and simple. 


For those of you who need a history lesson, a
browser is not a business, it is a tool.  The
grandfather of all browsers Netscape is now shut
down, and a non-profit company now owns its
browser. 


A browser is not a business in the US and it is not
a business in China.  Dong Xu, a researcher with
Analysys International, states:


"With the move from the wide-open web to
semi-closed platforms in the digital world,
web browsers, which don't tend to make
money, are regarded by vendors largely as
a means of making their main products
available."


http://www.china.org.cn/business/2011-
08/08/content_23164056.htm
[http://www.china.org.cn/business/2011-
08/08/content_23164056.htm]


Qihoo's problem is that it doesn't have "main
products".  It simply tries to hustle sales of games


and other links from its web traffic.   And 3rd party
statistics cast substantial doubt on Qihoo's claims
of anywhere near as much browser penetration as
they claim.


And even for their one standing business being the
browser, the bad news is that competition has
come to town.  Baidu, a company with over 75%
of the search market has recently launched their
own browser that has a focus on internet security.

BIDU's new browser is being released to cement
its position as the unquestioned leader in search,
much as Google developed Chrome to make sure it
had a foothold with web surfers, not to generate a
revenue stream, but to assure Google's hold on
the search business.


    Conclusion


Citron plans to follow up this QIHU story with a
part 2 that will focus on the plethora of
misinformation presented to the pubic from the
many investment banking firms covering QIHU. 
Much like MOBI, we were amazed to read the
many analysts reports that have simply repeated
management's hopes for the future as though it
were independent analysis. 


We look forward to their strident defense of this
name, and hope they present some data more
substantive than management's hopeful
narrative.   We suggest independent investors seek
out and give more weight to independent data
points especially those that would verify the range
of Qihu's real revenues, and less to company
stated "future plans", expecially where those plans
have generated no revenues. 


Cautious investing to all.
