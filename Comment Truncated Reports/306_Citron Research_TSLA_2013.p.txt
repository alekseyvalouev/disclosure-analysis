CITRON CHIMES IN ON
TESLA MOTORS


 


 


Citron adds its 2 cents in a note to Tesla
(NASDAQ:TSLA) investors:


 


 


Why you must be smarter than
Carl Icahn, Warren Buffett, Elon
Musk, and Goldman Sachs.
Citron is completely amazed at the torrent of
correspondence we received from investors over the
past two weeks, since we announced on Twitter that we
are initiating a short position on Tesla.  But instead of
breaking down the numbers which have been done by
every blogger in the blogosphere, we thought we would
add some simple common sense to the conversation.


Are you smarter than Carl Icahn? 


While the NASDAQ has been parabolic over the past 18
months, Apple has not been able to get out of its own
way.  Why is that?  Apple has been committing the

ultimate sin:  it makes money with forecastable cash
�ow.  Who would want to buy a company with a halo
brand and a credible international footprint, when I can
buy a story about the future, whose only attachment to
reality might be an analyst report that has back�lled
numbers to justify a stock price?  


Hopefully Mr. Icahn’s investment in Apple will serve as
a beacon of a new market that stock should be bought
on cash �ow, value, and a reasonable optimism about
the future.  While every speculative investor has had
the opportunity over the past three months to buy
Apple, it has now become completely overshadowed by
the “story du jour” … Tesla.


Are you smarter than Warren Buffett? 


Just last week Warren Bu�ett increased his stake in
General Motors by over 60% — he now owns 3% of the
company.  I guess the Oracle of Omaha didn’t get the
message that GM is now a walking dinosaur, and does
not o�er as good as an investment as Tesla.  There are
many metrics to look at to compare these two
companies, but here are just two very basic data
points.

843,000

Is it going to be easier for Telsa to close this gap or
General Motors to adapt to a changing environment? 
Mr. Bu�ett has placed his bet.


Do you know more than Elon Musk? 


In a recent CNBC interview Elon Musk said these two
lines:


“I actually think that the value of Tesla right now is ..I
mean the market is being very generous”


“I think the valuation we have right now is more than
we have any right to deserve”

stock-price-200000954.html
[https://�nance.yahoo.com/video/elon-musk-teslas-
stock-price-200000954.html]


No one has ever accused Elon Musk of being shy or
pessimistic.  The man is a true visionary and big
thinker.  The fact is he has done something truly
extraordinary – he has started an automobile
company.  Nobody has done that in decades.


So when Tesla �oated its secondary in May at
$92/share, Musk was giving a sign.  At that price, he
thought he was being ambitious to raise over $3 billion
at that price per share. 


Fundamentally, not much has changed in 3 months and
the stock is 60% higher.  Citron believes that not even
in Mr. Musk’s most wildly optimistic moment did he
think his stock would have such a stratospheric run.  If
so, we would not have seen that large a secondary at
that price.  As for Mr. Musk being a buyer there, well at
the same time, he took $50 million o� the table in the
transaction.

Like it or not, Goldman Sachs is still the gold standard
of sell side research.  Moreover, Goldman is the banker
for Mr. Musk and Tesla Motors.  Goldman Sachs
actually lent Elon Musk the money to buy his secondary
stock.  They have more skin in the game than any
banker on the street (Dougherty and Northland).  Elon
Musk owes them $275 million dollars.  They are fully
invested in the space.  Unlike the other sell-siders, who
o�er research based on current stock price charts and
not real analysis, Goldman has a dedicated auto
analyst who has a deep understanding of the space…
deeper than Citron and most certainly deeper than the
many individual investors who have sent us “love
notes” over the past two weeks.  And they are still
telling you what the company is worth. 


Goldman auto analyst Patrick Archambault has laid out
three scenarios for Tesla with the most optimistic of
them yielding a $120 stock price and the most
pessimistic $58.  Are you smarter than the Goldman
auto analyst?  I am not.  We have decided to bypass a
full dissection of the resumes or the logic behind the
other sell side research, but the following is just
irresistible. 


An Investible Auto Manufacturer …or
just a “Story”? 


 


Dougherty’s Andrea James drew headlines when she
“Blodgetted” Tesla last month, more than doubling her
price target to an eye-popping $200. Ms. James
specializes in “game-changing technology” in an
“emerging technology” coverage universe. Her
background?  She’s been … a journalist.  There is no
glint of understanding reflected in her coverage of having
any idea what the real challenges are of competing in the
auto industry. 


Her coverage universe consists of:

This coverage universe anoints Ms. James as a true
“expert” :  an expert on stories, not investments. 
Citron’s point is that investors are going to face serious
consequences as the Tesla story gets carried to absurd
levels without considering exactly when Tesla reverts to
being an auto manufacturer, rather than a “story”.


Andrea defended her opinion
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWBE_qZCLvQ] by
comparing Tesla to Amazon … another company
currently valued on creating a “new paradigm”.  But
internet-based delivery of consumer goods does not
even remotely resemble auto manufacturing.  


The reality is that once Tesla �lls the orders from the
early adopters, movie stars and high net worth trend
setters, and begins to depend on the everyday mass
market, buying a car is the most price-sensitive
purchase in the marketplace.  The average customer
walks through the dealer’s door knowing full well, as
does the dealer, exactly how many dollars per month
they will fork over to close the deal.  It is not a question
of “emerging technology”. 


Warren Bu�ett most famously said about investing “be
fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when
others are fearful”.  Well, the shorts in Tesla  are
fearful:  the short interest has dropped precipitously
[http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest]
from levels as recent as 6 months ago, while “days to
cover” is at an all time low.  Similarly, the longs are
getting greedy, but it is voodoo math to justify a target
price it by back�lling a multiple that might be achieved
in 2020 if all the planets are aligned.  On that basis
alone, it is time for us to jump into the short side. (

So before you start “bashing” Citron for having an
opinion, stop looking at the stock price, take a step
back and think about the real challenges that lie
ahead.  It was one year ago this month that everyone


was talking – not about if Apple was going to $1000 a
share but only when.  Investor euphoria, fueled by
hypnosis at a stock chart that only went up, discounted
all competition and the natural law of large numbers. 
The bloggers relentlessly tagged Samsung as “uncool”.  


Much like Apple, Tesla, makes a great product.  But this
might be a moment for people to invest with their
minds and not with their heart.
