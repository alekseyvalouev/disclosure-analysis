GeoInvesting Concurs With Tilson And 60 Minutes: Our Take On
Testing Methods Used For Lumber Liquidators Study
Mar. 4, 2015 9:30 AM ET20 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


A 60 Minutes investigative report on Lumber Liquidators, tipped off by short seller
Whitney Tilson, appeared to show dangerous levels of formaldehyde in the
company’s laminate wood.


Lumber Liquidators, per their 8-K released on March 2nd, is contesting the methods
in which the testing was performed.


After reviewing California standards for formaldehyde testing and methods which
were used by 60 Minutes and Tilson, we conclude that the test results are likely
authentic and accurate.


Lumber Liquidators’ cash position, per the 2014 10-K, is an anemic $20.3 million in
cash and $47.3 million left on a revolving credit facility. We think the company needs
cash.


Our investment thesis is decidedly bearish and we think significant risk exists for LL
to move much lower.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


When a company is accused of something as egregiously illegal and potentially harmful
as what 60 Minutes and Whitney Tilson have accused Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) of,
it's always a race to try and find facts to support or debunk the argument in the crucial first
few hours and days subsequent to the news breaking. It not only helps determine a clear
objective case for a 3rd party viewer, but it also helps in forming an investment decision
moving forward. Many times when companies are mired by bad news, traders see
opportunity and bargains. Other times, when companies are accused of illegal conduct,
the "falling knife" never seems to stop falling.


Such was the case with Whitney Tilson's Lumber Liquidators short. Mr. Tilson's short case
against Lumber Liquidators has consisted of an array of arguments, but most recently it
has centered on the allegation that LL's laminate hardwood contains levels of

formaldehyde that far exceed California (and soon to be national) standards.
Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen.


We had no position in LL going into the report on Sunday night, nor were we partial to one
side of the argument. Our interest in the story piqued on the Monday after the 60 Minutes
report, while trying to find out what the investment case was going to be for LL moving
forward. While Mr. Tilson has been short since 2013, the story really grew legs when it
was featured on 60 Minutes last Sunday. It left traders debating on Monday and Tuesday
as to whether or not shares were just too cheap to ignore, or whether Mr. Tilson and 60
Minutes nailed the story, which could potentially drive LL much lower than current levels.


We're not going to spend a significant amount of time in reiterating the content of Tilson's
original thesis. You can view his original Power Point from 2013 here and you can view the
60 Minutes segment here. In addition, here are some of the videos and documents from
Monday and Tuesday:


Tilson's phone interview with CNBC
An article, "Lumber Liquidators May Fail, Analysts Were Asleep"
NBC News, "Lumber Liquidators 'Stands by Every Plank - Should You?"
A Forbes article, "Whitney Tilson Has Made $1.4 Million Shorting Lumber Liquidators"
A profile at The Street.com "Who Is Whitney Tilson? Buffett Disciple Shorts Lumber
Liquidators"


The company's official rebuttal can be found in an 8-K filed with the SEC on March 2,
available here. Their rebuttal to the story was relatively simple: Tilson and 60 Minutes
used the wrong testing methods.


After spending the better part of two days looking through debate online, coupled with
researching both Tilson and LL's response, it seemed to us that the key "potential crack"
in Mr. Tilson's story was that the testing being performed by LL was different than the tests
performed by Mr. Tilson and 60 Minutes. Was there some type of California Air Resource
Board ("CARB") compliant testing being done at LL that Tilson and others didn't know
about? Could Mr. Tilson and 60 Minutes have performed the testing incorrectly? Therein,
we believe, lays the biggest threat to Mr. Tilson's short case. We wanted to dive further
into this one topic, which remains the lynchpin in the crux of the short case. Theoretically,
if LL can come out and show that CARB testing requirements are different than the
methodology used by Mr. Tilson and 60 Minutes, there could be an opportunity to the long
side.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


Instead, every single piece of evidence that we've uncovered over the past two days has
led us to our conclusion: we support Mr. Tilson and 60 Minutes' side of the story. Upon
even further review, we are skeptical of Lumber Liquidators' ability to continue operating in
any sort of capacity resembling its past operating results. We believe that the worst case
scenario of significant loss in LL is very much on the table.


The purpose of this piece is to address the testing methods used and how they compare
to CARB standards and methods used by Lumber Liquidators.


Testing Done by 60 Minutes and Mr. Tilson Both Seem to be Correct and CARB
Compliant


First off, we think it's imperative to lay out the documentation we used to draw our
conclusions that Mr. Tilson and 60 Minutes performed the correct, CARB-compliant, tests:


Source (1) - California Environmental Protection Agency: Standard Operating Procedure
for Finished Good Test Specimen Preparation Prior to Analysis of Formaldehyde
Emissions from Composite Wood Products (2013) - linked here


Source (2) - Final Regulation Order: Airborne Toxic Control measure to Reduce
Formaldehyde Emissions from Composite Wood Products - linked here


Source (3) - California Environmental Protection Agency (ARB) Formaldehyde Test
Methods (2014) - linked here


These documents are, essentially, the governing documents in question with regard to
California state methods for this type of testing. We'll support these documents with
excerpts from the transcript of the 60 Minutes piece, an interview with Mr. Tilson, and a
recent article by NBC News.


The main question raised about testing in Lumber Liquidators' wood used in these studies
revolves around whether or not the CARB-compliant way of testing is to "deconstruct" the
wood and take the sample from the "core". Finished wood products have a veneer on the
surface which can cover the glues that contain the formaldehyde. For this piece, we talk
about two types of testing:


1. Testing performed on the "surface" veneer (i.e. the top of the laminated surface of the
product)


2. Testing performed on the medium density fibreboard "core" of deconstructed laminate
flooring

This is what Mr. Tilson is talking about when he speaks about taking a sander to the wood
samples in order to get at the "core". Part of LL's defense seems to be that this method is
somehow improper, but our findings tell us otherwise.


The California Environmental Protection Agency: Standard Operating Procedure for
Finished Good Test Specimen Preparation Prior to Analysis of Formaldehyde Emissions
from Composite Wood Products document (source 1) that we sourced from the official CA
site on testing methods (source 3) tells us specifically that deconstruction is a key part
of the process.


Section two of the standard operating procedure document (source 1) clearly notes this
under "Summary of Method," where it calls deconstruction a "key activity":


And, just for good measure, the document even shows us how to operate a drum sander:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


Parts of this document link to the approved small scale and CARB testing methods as
determined by the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board.
Those methods can be found on CA.gov, using this link.


60 Minutes used both "core" and "surface" testing methods. In this part of the 60 Minutes
story, Anderson Cooper speaks with Tom Sullivan, LL's founder and chairman, who
seemingly claims that 60 Minutes was wrong to do the "core" test because it's not "a real
world test." [Our notes are in brackets]:


But when we took those test results to Lumber Liquidators' founder and chairman
Tom Sullivan, he refused to accept the methodology as valid and points out the
company is not required by law to test their finished products like we did.


Tom Sullivan: It's not a real world test of the laminate - it's not the way it's used.
[Geo: We believe he's implying that the "surface" test is the proper method]


Anderson Cooper: You say you don't believe in this test, but what you believe
doesn't really matter. It's what CARB believes. And they believe in this test. [Geo:
The deconstructive "core" test]


Tom Sullivan: We will do whatever the regulations are.


Elsewhere in the 60 Minutes story, Anderson Cooper shows Dr. Philip Landrigan the
results of the 60 Minutes tests using the "surface" method - and even using this method, in
which the formaldehyde is partially sealed in, Dr. Landrigan expresses grave concerns
about the formaldehyde levels:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


Dr. Philip Landrigan: It's not a safe level, it's a level that the US EPA calls polluted
indoor conditions.


Anderson Cooper: Would you want that in your home?


Dr. Philip Landrigan: No.


Dr. Philip Landrigan of N.Y.'s Mt. Sinai Hospital, specializes in environmental
pediatrics and exposure to toxic chemicals. He's talking about the results of another
kind of test Drury and Larson conducted measuring the concentration of
formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical home [Geo:
Meaning "surface" rather than "core" testing].


Dr. Philip Landrigan: I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky
because it would increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a
person's lung function, increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce symptoms
in everyone but children will be the people most likely to show symptoms at that sort
of level.


Additionally, an NBC News story that was published yesterday, linked here, confirms that
60 Minutes performed both tests (our emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


CBS said the testing it had performed on behalf of '60 Minutes' followed the protocol
set by the state of California. That state's formaldehyde regulations, known as CARB
2, are the strictest in the country and will be mirrored by nationwide regulations
expected to go into place this year. CBS also had the labs administer the
California Department of Public Health test, which measures the concentration of
formaldehyde off-gassing from the laminates.


To test the floorboards for CARB compliance, the outer layer or layers of material
such as veneer are removed to expose the core, which is where formaldehyde-
containing glue would be used.


"The method of preparing the sample [entails] removing what's not composite," said
Stanley Young, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. "If it's laminate,
removing the laminate… You have to take all of those materials off."


"The CARB regulation very specifically requires that if you're fabricating a
laminated floor you test for compliance by removing the face," Kip Howlett, president
of the Hardwood Plywood & Veneer Association, a trade group for domestic
producers and one of the labs that tested samples for CBS. "CARB has a very
specific method… We removed the face according to the CARB method and tested
the underlying core."


CBS found a single sample out of 31 that came from across the country - Virginia,
Florida, Texas, Illinois and New York - in compliance. Many samples had
formaldehyde levels many times over California's legal limit.


To add to this, you can clearly see this being addressed by Tilson in this TheStreet.com
video. Tilson addresses the testing about three minutes in. He says that there's testing
that goes on in China, which he calls a "sham". He then says that the "real testing" in the
U.S. should have picked up the problem. The standard for testing laminated wood, he
states, is taking the laminated wood to sand off the top layer to expose the "core" which is
where the formaldehyde is. It's based on that testing that CARB sets the "safe or unsafe"
levels.


He says that LL claims that the "surface" test is what's reasonable because people at
home aren't taking belt sanders to their floors and may assume that the formaldehyde is
sealed in the wood. But this is only partially true, as formaldehyde leaks out the sides of
the flooring pieces and can be released by the normal wear and tear of usage.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


Irrespective of this argument, however, Tilson states that the "core" test method is the
industry standard and how everyone does it. He says that LL is using their own methods,
which "no one else uses." To compare formaldehyde levels measured by the "surface" test
with the safe levels CARB has established is, Tilson says, "apples and oranges". Our
research on the matter has us agreeing with Tilson.


This is a copy of a press release issued by Global Community Monitor, whose Executive
Director Denny Larson was interviewed by 60 Minutes, that addresses several key issues,
namely:


Why formaldehyde testing is important
Why the CARB tests matter
The standards CARB uses
The testing method & results
The methodology behind the three labs that did the testing


Our analysis of this press release and the corresponding results reaffirms our view that
Tilson and 60 Minutes are correct about the proper testing protocols.


Negligence Clues from the 10-K?


As part of our research, we examined LL's 10-K to try and address the concept of how
much visibility the company has over its overseas operations. Let's start with what the
company notifies us about performing CARB testing domestically. First, they tell us that
they "expect to begin operating" a CARB-certification lab in Q1 of 2015:


In the first quarter of 2015, we expect to begin operating a 1,500 square foot lab
within our new East Coast distribution facility. The lab will feature two temperature
and humidity controlled conditioning rooms and two emission chambers correlated to
a California Air Resources Board ("CARB")-approved Third Party Certifier. This
equipment mirrors the capabilities of CARB and other state-of-the-art emission
testing facilities. We believe no other flooring retailer has comparable facilities. This
new lab will complement and augment the capabilities of the facilities we operate in
Toano, Virginia and in Shanghai, China, as well as those utilized by our suppliers.


We find it interesting that the company is seeking out their own CARB approved Third
Party Certifier and that they may not have access to these types of facilities as of yet,
unless something has changed materially since the time the company's 10-K was filed.

Then, when talking about "Supplier Relationships," the company points out some facts
that lead us to believe that they have total or near-total visibility as to what takes place in
the mills they buy from. Specifically, the company notes that they are "on-site at certain
mills" and that the "long-term relationships" they engage in "challenge the structure of
each relationship, ultimately producing best combination of quality and value."


We are able to set demanding specifications for product quality and our own quality
control and assurance teams are on-site at certain mills, coordinating inspection
and assurance procedures. We believe the advantages a mill gains by working with
us attracts interest from around the world. As a result, we have diversified our
purchases across approximately 130 domestic and international mills.


We seek long-term, core relationships with mills committed to our demanding
product specifications, sustainable supply and regulatory compliance. As a result,
our top 20 suppliers accounted for approximately 62% of our supply purchases in
2014 and our largest mill partner represented approximately 7%. Outside of the core
group, we seek mill diversification and utilize sourcing initiatives which challenge
the structure of each relationship, ultimately producing the best combination of
quality and value at the lowest cost.


Additionally, when speaking about the quality of their products in the 10-K, LL reveals that
it is often a mill's largest customer, which seemed to be the case with the mill in which 60
Minutes took hidden camera video. This is consistent with what LL says in its 10-K, that it
has visibility and command over what happens in these mills:


Quality. We invest significant resources to design and produce products of the
highest quality, including our flagship Bellawood brand. We source directly from mills
all over the world, and often are a mill's most significant relationship. Proprietary
brands allow us greater control over product design and production, which we
monitor through an expansive network of experienced quality control and
assurance professionals.


Investment Thesis: LL Has Extremely Limited Upside


Prior to our research, we tried to be objective in drawing conclusions about whether or not
Tilson and 60 Minutes' testing was accurate. We felt the company was going to have a
very rough future ahead of it regardless. Now that we have satisfied our internal questions
about the method of testing used, our investment thesis leans decidedly bearish.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


These types of mishaps generally require a "war chest" of cash to deal with. According to
LL's latest 10-K, the company finished 2014 with $20.3 million in cash and $47.3 million
left on a credit facility, which may or may not be accessible moving forward in light of this
news.


We think the worst case scenario of LL's stock potentially going to single digits - or even to
zero - is still very much on the table and, accordingly, we are short LL. Here's what we
believe:


The first problem that LL is going to have to deal with is dealing with customers who
have purchased their products (not just laminate wood) that are going to want flooring
removed and refunds at no cost to them. Many of LL's past customers will undoubtedly
be gravely concerned that they and their families are being exposed to a dangerous
known carcinogen and will demand that LL pay for testing their flooring, which is very
expensive. This is going to throw the profit engine into a swift reverse and will likely
have an adverse effect on the company's financials going forward.
The second problem that LL is going to have to deal with is lawsuits: lawsuits from
customers, class action lawsuits from shareholders, and potential lawsuits from the
government. We don't believe the company has the cash position necessary to deal
with these lawsuits.
The third problem is going to be that victims and potential victims are going to start
coming forward in troves. They're going to be angry and they're going to tie up
company resources. Anyone who's been exposed to LL's products (customers, guests,
installers, etc.) who develops any type of medial issue associated with formaldehyde
exposure, ranging from a simple cough to various types of cancer, will likely blame LL's
flooring (whether justified or not) and sue to have LL cover their medical bills, pain and
suffering, etc. These costs bankrupted most companies with any association with
asbestos - and we foresee a possible similar outcome for LL. This is also going to cost
a lot. So much for those growing gross margins.
The fourth problem will be dealing with regulators who are going to be very interested
in finding out what the company knew about this situation and when they knew it. LL
was raided by Federal agents in September 2013 for possible violations of the Lacey
Act (buying hardwoods that may have been illegally harvested by the Russian mob in
an environmentally protected area of Siberia), which has been expensive and time-
consuming for the company, so we can only imagine how much more time and money
the much more serious formaldehyde problem will consume. As Tilson said, this is
either negligence or outright fraud. Regardless, either situation could result in an
unceremonious end to tenure for the company's officers and directors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2972256-geoinvesting-concurs-with-tilson-and-60-minutes-our-take-on-testing-methods-used-for-lumber-liquidators-study


The fifth problem is going to be raising much needed capital. As a few articles pointed
out on Tuesday, the company's balance sheet is in no position to deal with a massive
crisis like this. LL is going to need tons of cash to throw at this problem and raising
money with a giant risk hanging over the head of the company here is going to be
extremely difficult. The concept of bankruptcy has been tossed around on social media
and taking a look at the company's balance sheet, we understand why.


In summary, Lumber Liquidators potentially faces enormous headwinds and costs that the
company may not be able to withstand, with only $20 million of cash in the bank and little
prospect of raising additional capital while so many clouds hang over it.


On top of the testing results, 60 Minutes also had hidden video from one of the Chinese
mills that LL uses. We saw firsthand that mill employees were clearly showing boxes that
were labeled CARB 2 compliant and telling investigators that the wood inside wasn't
CARB 2 compliant. Those that are familiar with our work know that we have a lot of real
world experience with hidden camera video in China. It's been our experience that people
like these millworkers generally have no reason to lie in these types of situations. We find
the evidence that 60 Minutes presented to be very compelling based upon our real
experience in China over the last 5 years.


Even if LL somehow unexpectedly exonerates itself and makes it out of this crisis
operating as it used to (which we sincerely doubt), it's going to have a fundamental
business problem to deal with.


It then becomes somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy as the company's customer base
begins to dwindle. 60 Minutes has a huge audience and the story has been picked up
widely by other media, so millions of potential future customers have undoubtedly heard of
the formaldehyde problem and will be thinking twice about buying anything from LL.


These types of potentially disastrous scenarios are not conducive to a company trading
near 15 times its former estimates for next year. LL could easily be cut in half before we
even hear the next update from the company. The fallout of lost business and a tainted
brand name as a result of this crisis tells us that LL may not ever recover to be the growth
giant it once was - or recover at all.
