Real Nutriceutical Group Limited (2010.HK) (“Real Nutri” or the “Company”) produces and sells 


nutritional supplements and health drinks, primarily amino acid-based tablets and liquids.  In this 


report we present publicly available evidence, including PRC government filings, tax rankings, and 


the results of retail channel checks, which in our opinion, indicate that Real Nutri’s sales and net 


income are substantially less than reported to investors and regulators in the Company’s Hong 


Kong filings.  We believe that much like China Medical Technologies (NASDAQ: CMEDY) and 


China Lumena (HK: 0067), Real Nutri’s equity is worth HKD 0.00 and trading of its stock should 


be halted to protect future investors from further losses and hopefully provide a modicum of recovery 


for creditors. 
  
1. PRC Government Filings Indicate Revenues 84% Less than Reported.  According to Real 


Nutri’s HKEX filings, its two primary operating subsidiaries, Wuxi Ruinian Industry & 


Commerce Co., Limited (“Ruinian Industry”) and Wuxi Zhenqian Bio-Technology (“Wuxi 


Biotech”), generated RMB 5.1 billion in revenues from 2011-2013.  Yet Publicly available 


filings from the Ministry of Commerce (“Mofcom”) show that the two subsidiaries, which 


together account for over 90% of the Company’s reported revenues and profits, only generated 


RMB 839 million in combined revenues from 2011-2013, 84% less than reported to Hong 


Kong investors and regulators.  Mofcom filings also show that rather than generate RMB 1.97 


billion in operating profits from 2011-2013 (as reported), Real Nutri’s primary operating 


subsidiaries only generated RMB 26 million in operating profits over that period, which is 


99% less than reported in HKEX filings.  In our opinion, this is conclusive evidence that Real 


Nutri has massively fabricated its reported revenues and profits. 
 


2. PRC Government Tax Rankings Indicate Net Income a Fraction of Reported Figures. If 
Real Nutri’s Hong Kong financials are true, we estimate that Real Nutri’s primary operating 


subsidiary, Ruinian Industry, whose headquarters and production base are located in Binhu 


district, Wuxi city, in the province of Jiangsu, should have paid RMB 351 million in taxes in 


2013 and RMB 344 million in taxes in 2012 (income and VAT).  Yet the Binhu district 


government released a report regarding its 2013 tax base, implying that only two companies, 


Sino Swede Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (“SSPC”) and Koso (Wuxi) Co., Ltd. (“Koso”), paid over 


RMB 100 million in taxes in 2013.  If Real Nutri’s reported financials are true, Ruinian Industry 


should have paid well over RMB 100 million in taxes.  Ruinian Industry’s omission from the 


Binhu district’s 2013 tax report suggests that Real Nutri did not pay the amount of taxes that it 


claims (and thus generates far less net income than it claims) in its public filings. 
 


3. We Meet Again, Mr. Poon. Real Nutri’s CFO, Mr. Poon Yick Pang, served as the director of 
finance for China Medical Technologies (“CMED”), a US-listed company which Glaucus 


exposed as a massive fraud in 2011.  After CMED collapsed following our report, Real Nutri 


tried to conceal Mr. Poon’s connection to the disgraced firm.  Mr. Poon was CMED’s director of 


finance during a period when CMED engaged in a fraudulent acquisition to secretly transfer 


shareholder money to its Chairman.  He was also CMED’s director of finance when CMED filed 


false financial statements which deliberately inflated the Company’s reported sales and profits.    


In our opinion, Real Nutri is perpetuating a similar fraud on the market, and the fact that it 


employs a disgraced CFO who would likely be behind bars in the United States only confirms 


our opinions.

4. Customers as Undisclosed Related Parties.  In its prospectus, Real Nutri claimed that two of its five largest customers, distributors 
Wuxi Lianren Trading Co., Ltd. (“Lianren”) and Wuxi Zongwei Logistics co., Ltd. (“Wuxi Logistics”), were “independent third 


parties.”  But evidence suggests that both customers are in fact related parties controlled by Real Nutri’s Chairman Wang Fucai.  
First, Lianren recently posted job listings on university websites in which it claimed to be a subsidiary of the Company.  Second, 


Wuxi Logistics shares an address with a subsidiary of the Company.  In addition, records from a recent PRC lawsuit state that Wuxi 
Logistics’ shareholder is also an employee of Ruinian Zhiye, a company owned by the Company’s Chairman.  In our opinion, such 


compelling evidence indicates that both supposedly independent customers are indeed undisclosed related parties, a clear violation 


of Hong Kong listing rules and a material misrepresentation to investors and regulators. 


5. On Site Due Diligence Confirms Exaggerated Retail Presence.  In an effort to channel check the Company’s retail footprint, an 
independent investigator visited 59 retailers (supermarkets and drug stores) and nine Company stores.  The results suggest the 


Company’s retail footprint is much smaller than advertised.   
 


a. Retail Store Count Likely Fabricated.  The Company claims to operate over 200 retail stores as of December 31, 2014.  
However, an independent investigator visited nine reported locations in three provinces, and found only three retail stores that 
were open and operating.  The investigator took photographs of the non-operating locations, one of which still bore the Company 


logo but was closed.  Other locations were either closed or contained other retail stores (e.g. liquor stores) not affiliated with the 


Company.  Although a small sample size, we believe that this on-site due diligence indicates that the Company is likely 
exaggerating its retail store count.  


 
b. Real Nutri’s Products Either Absent or Limited at Many Retailers.  An investigator also visited 43 supermarkets at which the 


Company claims to sell products (including Wal-Mart, RT-Mart, Auchan, Vanguard and Suguo).  Only 26 stores were actually 


selling the Company’s products (60%).  Of those selling Ruinian branded products, in many cases, the Company’s shelf presence 
was either sub-optimal (bottom shelf) or limited (one product).  Of the 16 drug stores visited (LBX, Nepstar and Guosheng), the 


investigator found the Company’s products for sale at only one drug store (6%), suggesting that the Company has significantly 


exaggerated its penetration of this retail channel.  
 


6. Reported Expenditures Simply Not Credible.  In our opinion, a number of Real Nutri’s reported expenditures appear highly 
dubious and suggest that the Company is straining to whitewash fake sales either through fabricated expenses, capital expenditures, 
acquisitions and cash balances.   





a. Advertising Expenses.  Real Nutri claims to have spent over RMB 1 billion on advertising expenses over the last three years, 
amounting to approximately 18% of its revenues over this period.  If true, Real Nutri would be among the top thirty advertising 


spenders of A-share companies, alongside popular national brands such as Unicom and Yanjing Beer.  This is simply not credible.  
Real Nutri’s ad spending also exceeds (on an absolute and relative basis) the most popular dietary supplement brands as ranked 


by the PRC’s national bureau of statistics, companies such as By-Health who have spent 50% less on advertising and have 


launched campaigns with sports celebrities such as Yao Ming.  Real Nutri spends so much more than other dietary supplement 
brands, yet is comparatively obscure and has little to show for such spending in the form of endorsements.  Ultimately, such 


spending is hardly credible, and corroborates filings and tax rankings which suggest that Real Nutri’s operating business is 


substantially smaller than it claims.   
 


b. Questionable Capital Expenditures.  In 2013, a local media article alleged that Real Nutri has exaggerated the value of its 
property, plant and equipment.  We agree.  Real Nutri reportedly spent RMB 1.5 billion on capex from 2011-2014, which was 


so significant that it accounted for 75% of cash flow generated from operations over that time.  Despite such spending, Real 


Nutri’s revenue only increased RMB 705 million during that period.  Likewise, its return on assets plummeted from 17.0% to 
9.8% and its fixed asset turnover ratio sank from 2.17x to an abysmal 1.06x.  Measured both on an absolute and relative basis, 


Real Nutri’s returns on its reported capital expenditures are so poor that such reported spending simply appears fabricated.  


 
c. Mystery of ‘Advanced Technical Know-How.  Since its IPO, Real Nutri has carried a mysterious balance sheet tem labelled 


“advance payment for acquisition of technical know-how,’ which has ballooned from RMB 27 million in 2009 to RMB 112 
million at FYE 2014.  Few details are provided, except that the ‘know-how’ has been waiting since 2009 to be licensed by 


the PRC government.  We are highly suspicious of this reported purchase.  Why does Real Nutri have to commit over RMB 


100 million in capital today to secure an unlicensed technique?  Real Nutri makes supplements, not rockets.  





d. Sham Acquisition.  On 29 Jun 2014, Real Nutri announced the acquisition of 60% Magic Galaxy Worldwide Limited (“Magic 
Galaxy”), the sole shareholder of a PRC-based pharmaceutical company which produces eye drops, for an aggregate 
consideration of RMB 200 million.  The Company told investors that the acquired business generated a net profit of RMB ~35 


million in 2014 and held RMB 267 million in patents.  Yet, publicly available Mofcom filings indicate that the sole operating 
subsidiary of Magic Galaxy reported a net loss in 2014, and held only RMB 14 million in intangible assets at FYE 2014, 


suggesting that Real Nutri massively exaggerated the profitability and value of the acquired business.

7. Retail Sales Data Indicates Real Nutri Fabricated Reported Sales.  CMH, a subsidiary of SinoHealth, is a leading 
independent market research firm, specializing in the healthcare sector.  CMH employs a monitoring system to track the 


sales of nutritional supplements (through pharmacies and drug stores) to consumers in China and compiles the data into 
annual rankings of the best-selling nutritional supplements and products.  


  
a. Real Nutri’s Sales a Fraction of By-Health’s.  CMH’s ranking of the top-twenty selling health and nutritional products 


of 2013 did not include any of Real Nutri’s products.  By contrast, By-Health (SHZ: 300146), which reported total sales 


in 2013 of only RMB 1.5 billion (compared to Real Nutri’s reported RMB 1.9 billion in sales that year), has seven 
nutritional products on CMH’s lists (ranked 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 15 and 19).   By-Health, a direct competitor, reports 


significantly lower sales than Real Nutri.  Its ubiquity on the 2013 CMH rankings, and Real Nutri’s stark absence, 


corroborates the rest of the evidence in this report showing that Real Nutri is massively overstating its sales.  
 


b. CMH Rankings Indicate Sales of Flagship Product Exaggerated in 2013.  CMH reported that the 20th ranked product 
on its 2013 list had RMB 216 million in retail sales.  We estimate that Real Nutri’s flagship product should have generated 


at least RMB 339 million in retail sales in 2013 through drug stores and pharmacies. But it did not make CMH’s list of 


top twenty, the threshold for which was RMB 216 million, implying Real Nutri has exaggerated sales of its flagship 
product. 





8. Real Nutri’s Supposed Efficiency Almost Impossible.  Real Nutri reported RMB 2.17 million of revenue per employee 
in 2013, which significantly exceeds the revenues-per-employee reported by its peers, including By-Health (RMB 0.85 


million per employee), Jiao Da Onlly (0.54 million per employee) and Tai Tai (RMB 0.87 million per employee). A large 


discrepancy in revenues-per-employee was a key clue in our investigation revealing that China Metal Recycling (report 
available here) was fabricating its reported financials.  Like CMR, Real Nutri’s reported productivity is an outlier and, in 


our opinion, further evidence that its financials are fabricated.   





9. Inexplicable Short Term Borrowings.  Real Nutri has historically claimed a large cash balance, exceeding RMB 1.3 
billion in each of the last three FYs (2012-2014).  Despite excessive cash reserves, the Company has also reportedly taken 


short term loans of RMB 195 million, RMB 435 million and RMB 884 million, at an implied interest rate of 12.0%, 5.9% 
and 4.2% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Why would a Company with such a healthy cash balance take out short 


term loans, especially at interest rates far exceeding the rate received for the Company’s existing bank balances?  We suspect 


that the Company’s reported cash reserves, like its reported revenues and profits, are significantly overstated, which explains 
why Real Nutri needs to engage in short term borrowing a higher interest rates to make up the short-fall and fund its 


continuing operations.   





10. Serial Capital Raiser and the Illusion of Dividends.  Despite reporting substantial profits (EBTIDA margins of 40-45% 
2010-2014), Real Nutri is a serial capital raiser because such “profits” are spent on dubious capital expenditures and 


acquisitions of questionable value.  Its supposedly generous dividend policy is therefore something of an illusion, because 
such dividends are paid by funds raised from the capital markets and not from cash generated by the business.  Since 2010, 


the Company has raised RMB 2 billion in proceeds, of which it has declared dividends of RMB ~296 million (~13% of 


capital raised).   





11. Chinese SOE Quietly Cashed Out At a Loss.  In May 2013, Newport Consulting Limited, now owned by China 
Shipbuilding (an SOE), subscribed to RMB 200 million of convertible bonds issued by the Company.  Trouble followed.  
First, China Shipbuilding elected not to exercise its option to purchase a 2nd tranche of bonds worth RMB 400 million.  


Then, in July 2015, China Shipbuilding elected to convert its bonds at HKD 3.00 when the Company’s shares were trading 


at, or below, HKD 2.00.  Following conversion, the SOE promptly assigned its shares to a third party.  The decision to 
realize a significant loss by converting at a strike price 50% above the last traded price of the shares is inexplicable and 


irrational unless the SOE wanted (desperately) to exit its position.    





12. Valuation.  We believe that the most appropriate comparison to Real Nutri is CMED, the US-listed company which 
defrauded investors and creditors by fabricating its reported financial performance.  When we alerted the market to CMED’s 


malfeasance, CMED’s management went dark and absconded with the assets, leaving shareholders and creditors almost 
nothing to recover. In our opinion, there is a wealth of clear and convincing evidence that Real Nutri’s sales are 84% less 


than reported and that its net income is 99% less than reported to investors and regulators in the Company’s Hong 


Kong filings.  This gives us ample reason to doubt the authenticity of the Company’s reported RMB 2.4 billion cash balance.   
Despite a supposedly healthy cash balance, Real Nutri has taken on short-term debt of RMB 884 million, which would be 


senior to any shareholder recovery.  Ultimately, we believe that much like China Medical Technologies (NASDAQ: 
CMEDY) and China Lumena (HK: 0067), Real Nutri’s equity is worth HKD 0.00 and trading of its stock should be halted 


to protect future investors from further losses and hopefully provide a modicum of recovery for creditors.

PRC GOVERNMENT FILINGS INDICATE REVENUES 84% LESS THAN REPORTED 





Real Nutri’s PRC government filings indicate that the Company has massively exaggerated its revenues, 


profits and the scale of its operating business to Hong Kong investors and regulators.   


Wholly foreign owned enterprises (“WFOE”) are required by law to submit annual reports to China’s 


Ministry of Commerce (“Mofcom”).  Pursuant to Article 62 of the PRC’s Detailed Rules for the 


Implementation of the Law on Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises, a WFOE’s annual filings with Mofcom 


are required to include audited financial statements (income statements, balance sheets and cash flow 


statements), as well as basic corporate information and a summary of registered and paid-in capital 


contributions.  Like SAIC filings, Mofcom filings are publicly available and can be obtained for diligence 


purposes.

Real Nutriceutical Group Limited │ HK: 2010                       www.glaucusresearch.com 





According to Real Nutri’s HKEX filings, its primary operating subsidiary, Wuxi Ruinian Industry & 


Commerce Co., Limited (“Ruinian Industry”) generated RMB 3.9 billion in revenues from 2011-2013.  


Ruinian Industry accounted for 71% of the Company’s reported revenues over the three-year period.  


Yet, according to publicly available Mofcom files, submitted by Ruinian Industry to the PRC government 


pursuant to statutory requirements, Real Nutri’s primary operating subsidiary only generated RMB 790 


million in revenues from 2011-2013, 80% less than reported.

Just as important, Mofcom filings also show that Ruinian Industry is significantly less profitable than the 


Company claims in its HKEX filings.  Real Nutri reported that Ruinian Industry generated approximately 


RMB 1.7 billion in operating profits from 2011-2013 (82% of the Company’s reported operating profits 


during that period).  However, Mofcom filings show that the primary operating subsidiary barely broke 


even, generating only RMB 32.2 million in operating profits over that period.  This was 98% less than the 


profits reported to Hong Kong investors and regulators.

HKEX filings report that Wuxi Zhenqian Bio-Technology (“Wuxi Biotech”), generated RMB 1.2 billion in 


revenues from 2011-2013, which accounted for 22% of the Company’s reported revenues over that period.   


Yet Mofcom filings indicate that Wuxi Biotech did not generate any revenues in 2011, and that it generated

Furthermore, Real Nutri reported that Wuxi Biotech generated RMB 245.9 million in estimated operating

Mofcom filings indicate that Wuxi Biotech’s operating profits were 102% less than reported to Hong Kong 


investors and regulators from 2011-2013.  


On aggregate, Real Nutri reported that its two primary operating subsidiaries, Ruinian Industry and Wuxi 


Biotech, generated RMB 5.1 billion in revenues from 2011-2013.  Yet Mofcom filings show that the 


subsidiaries, which together account for over 90% of the Company’s reported revenues, only generated 


RMB 839 million in combined revenues from 2011-2013, 84% less than reported to Hong Kong 


investors and regulators.   





Mofcom filings also show that rather than generate RMB 1.97 billion in operating profits from 2011-2013, 


Real Nutri’s primary operating subsidiaries only generated RMB 26 million in cumulative operating 


profits over that period, which is 99% less than reported in HKEX filings. 





In our opinion, this is conclusive evidence that Real Nutri massively fabricated its reported revenues and 


profits.

TAX RANKINGS INDICATE NET INCOME A FRACTION OF REPORTED FIGURES 


A 2013 tax report by the Binhu district government indicates that the Company is paying far less tax than 


it claims, suggesting that the Company’s net income is a fraction of the figure reported to Hong Kong 


investors and regulators.    


Real Nutri sells products in three segments: health and nutritional supplements, health drinks and 


pharmaceutical products.  According to the Company’s annual reports, its health and nutritional 


supplements segment accounts for ~70% of the Company’s revenues and ~80% of its gross profits in FYs 


2011-2014. 





According to the Company’s IPO prospectus and subsequent annual reports, Real Nutri’s health and 


nutritional supplements business is conducted through its primary operating subsidiary Ruinian Industry 


(Wuxi Ruinian Industry & Commerce Co., Ltd.) (“Ruinian Industry”), which is located (along with its 


manufacturing facility) in Binhu district, Jiangsu province. 0F1   


Given that Ruinian Industry accounts for 82% of the Company’s operating profit, we estimate that the 


subsidiary paid at least RMB 170 million in income taxes and RMB 181 million VAT for a total of RMB 


351 million in 2013. 





Despite supposedly paying over RMB 351 million in taxes in 2013, Ruinian Industry was conspicuously 


omitted from a prominent government tax list.  The Binhu district government released a report regarding 


its 2013 tax base, stating that the district collected RMB 4.03 billion in taxes from manufacturing (including 


the production of pharmaceutical products).  The report highlighted that only two companies, Sino Swede

If Real Nutri’s reported financials are true, then primary operating subsidiary Ruinian Industry, located in 


Binhu district, should have paid an estimated RMB 351 million in taxes in 2013 (VAT plus income taxes).  


Such amounts far exceed the ~RMB 100 million in taxes paid by Koso and SSPC, and should therefore 


have been highlighted in the Binhu district’s 2013 tax report.  Yet the district government’s report omits 


Ruinian Industry as a significant tax payer, indicating that the subsidiary pays far less taxes than it claims.   


To put in context Ruinian Industry’s purported contribution, if Real Nutri’s Hong Kong filings are true, 


then we estimate that Ruinian Industry’s tax contributions should accounted for approximately 8.7% of the 


Binhu district’s total tax revenues from manufacturing.  It would be a much larger contributor to the 


district’s tax revenues than either Koso or SSPC. 





In our opinion, the omission of Ruinian Industry from the district tax report indicates that Real Nutri pays 


far less in taxes than it claims, meaning its net income is actually a small fraction of the net income figure 


reported to Hong Kong investors and regulators.

WE MEET AGAIN, MR. POON 


In December 2011, we alerted investors that a US-listed company, China Medical Technologies 


(NASDAQ: CMEDY) (“CMED”), was defrauding its investors by fabricating its reported financial 


performance.  We presented a comprehensive report outlining the fraud, including evidence that CMED’s 


insiders had embezzled money from the company.  Investors may recall that shortly thereafter, CMED went 


dark, wiping out 100% of shareholder equity and leaving bond holders with $426 million in unpaid 


debt.  CMED filed for bankruptcy in August 2012 and was subsequently liquidated. 1F2  Today, CMED serves 


as a cautionary tale for investors who put their faith in the wrong people.   


One of those people is back.  Real Nutri’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Poon Yick Pang, Philip, just happens 


to have been CMED’s director of finance from 2007 through 2008. 





Source: 2010 Annual report, p. 27. 


After we exposed CMED for a fraud, Real Nutri tried to hide Mr. Poon’s connection to the disgraced 


company.  In Real Nutri’s 2012 annual report, Real Nutri deliberately omitted from Mr. Poon’s biography 


any mention of CMED or his time there. 


 
Source: 2012 Annual report, p. 29. 


Mr. Poon was CMED’s director of finance in 2007 and 2008, meaning his tenure coincided with a 


fraudulent acquisition of a shell company from a party secretly related to CMED’s Chairman. 2F3  We also 


believe, and subsequent events support, that during this time, CMED filed false financial statements which 


deliberately inflated the Company’s reported sales and profits.     


In our opinion, Real Nutri is perpetuating a similar fraud on the market, and the fact that it employs a 


disgraced CFO who would be behind bars in the United States only confirms our opinions.

CUSTOMERS ARE UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTIES 


In its prospectus, Real Nutri claimed that two of its five largest customers, distributors Wuxi Lianren 


Trading Co., Ltd. (“Lianren”) and Wuxi Zongwei Logistics co., Ltd. (“Wuxi Logistics”), were “independent 


third parties.”   


 
Source: Real Nutriceutical Propectus, p. 147 





1) Lianren 


Yet evidence suggests that both major customers are in fact undisclosed related parties.  First, in two job 


postings on university websites, one from 2014, Lianren advertises itself as a subsidiary of Real Nutri.

The above job postings by a supposedly independent customer, Lianren, show clearly that the distributor 


considers itself a subsidiary of the Company.   


2) Wuxi Logistics 


Evidence suggests that a second major customer, Wuxi Logistics, is also an undisclosed related party, as 


its registered address is identical to Company subsidiary Wuxi Ruinian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Ruinian 


Pharmaceutical”).  Both are registered at No. 102 Furongzhong No. 2 Road, Xishan Economic 


Development Area, Wuxi.

In addition, a ruling from a PRC court dated June 29, 2015, and released on a PRC government website on 


July 16, 2015, states one of Wuxi Logistics’ primary shareholders, Fan Xijuan, is also a current employee 


Ruinian Zhiye, which is owned by Chairman Wang Fucai. 





 
Source: http://caseshare.cn/full/126159159.html 





Ultimately, Lianren is holding itself out a subsidiary of the Company to university recruits and Wuxi 


Logistics not only shares a registered address with a Company subsidiary, but also its shareholder is a 


current employee of a business owned by Chairman Wang Fucai.   


In our opinion, the evidence indicates that both supposedly independent customers are in fact undisclosed 


related parties.  We believe that this is another clear violation of Hong Kong listing rules and a material 


misrepresentation to Hong Kong investors and regulators.

ON SITE DUE DILIGENCE CONFIRMS EXAGERRATED RETAIL PRESENCE 


On-site channel checks of the Company’s retail presence, both at Real Nutri stores and third party 


distributors through which Real Nutri claims to sell its products, suggest that the Company’s retail footprint 


is far smaller than it claims.   


The results of the investigation suggest, at least in terms of shelf space and in-store presence, that Ruinian 


does not appear to be a leading brand.  This in turn corroborates the Mofcom filings, tax-lists, brand-


rankings and other evidence in this report, indicating that the Company has fabricated its reported sales.   


1) Retail Store Count Likely Exaggerated 





As of December 31, 2014, Real Nutri claimed that there were around 200 Real Nutri Health Stores which 


together contributed revenue of RMB 239.5 million in the year. 3F4  We believe that the Company has likely 


exaggerated the number of stores.  


In order to get a more complete understanding of the Company’s retail presence, an independent 


investigator visited nine reported Real Nutri locations in four provinces (Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and 


Shangdong).  The investigator found only 3 working Real Nutri stores.   





The investigator took photos to document closed or non-operational stores.  For example, at the address 


for the Nanjing, Jiangsu (Bai Xia Qu store), Real Nutri’s name was still on the store but it was closed.

At the store location at No. 36 Yongfeng Road, Wuxi, Jiangsu, a shop appeared to be under construction 


but by a firm unrelated to Real Nutri. 





 
Source: Investigator Photo September 2015 





Of the nine reported retail locations visited by the investigator, only three (33%) contained fully operating 


Real Nutri stores.  Other locations still bore the Company name but were closed (permanently, it appears).  


Still other locations were either under construction or were occupied by stores unaffiliated with the 


Company.  Even though this was a small sample size, we believe that this on-site due diligence indicates 


that Real Nutri has likely exaggerated its reported retail store count.  


2) Products Either Absent or Limited at Many Retailers 





The Company sells products through three channels: distributors (which then sell to supermarkets, drug 


stores and hospitals), Real Nurti health stores, and an online direct sales platform.  90% of the Company’s 


reported sales, however, are through distributors.   





In an effort to channel check the Company’s reported retail presence, an independent investigator visited 


59 supermarkets and drug stores in Shanghai, Hangzhou (Zheijiang), Nanjing (Jiangsu) and Jinan 


(Shandong) at which Real Nutri claimed to sell its nutritional supplements and other products.   


Of the 43 supermarkets visited, including stores of Wal-Mart, Auchan, RT-Mart, Vanguard and Suguo (all 


retailers through which Real Nutri claims to sell its products), the investigator found Real Nutri’s products 


for sale at 26 supermarkets.  In other words, only 60% of the supermarkets visited sold the Company’s 


products.  


Real Nutri’s retail presence at drug stores was even worse.  The Company claims to sell its products through 


drug store chains including LBX, Nepstar and Guosheng, but of the 16 drug stores visited, only one Nepstar 


drugstore was actually selling its products.

Of the 43 supermarkets visited and photographed by the investigator, 60% (26) carried Ruinian branded 


products, although in many cases relegated them to lower shelves indicative of less popular products. The 


shelf placement of Ruinian’s products was also poor relative to other brands such as By-Health and 


Hongfuloi.  





The following graphs represent the shelf area devoted to Real Nutri’s products as compared to other leading 


brands.  This data is based on the observations of the independent investigator during the September 2015 


retail channel checks.  In general, the investigator observed that the Ruinian branded products occupy far 


less shelf space than other dietary supplement brands.

The investigator also noticed that in general, Ruinian-branded products received far poorer shelf placement 


in supermarkets than its competitors.  The following table, compiled based on observations by the 


investigator at supermarkets visited, summarizes the observed shelf placement of Ruinian-branded products 


relative to other leading brands.   








Ultimately, the on-site channel checks present a small sample size by which to measure the Company’s 


retail footprint.  But even this limited survey suggests that the Company’s retail footprint is significantly 


smaller than the Company claims, which supports other evidence presented in this report (such as the 


Mofcom filings, tax lists, brand rankings and financial statement analytics) indicating that the Company’s 


sales are far smaller than it reports in its HKEX filings.

REPORTED SPENDING SIMPLY NOT CREDIBLE 


A business that fabricates sales faces a tricky problem.  Fake sales necessitate commensurate expenses.  


Fake sales also produce fake profits, and such fabricated profits must be accounted for on the balance sheet 


either in the form of a fabricated acquisitions, capital expenditures and/or fake cash balances.   


In our opinion, a number of Real Nutri’s reported expenditures appear highly dubious and suggest that the 


Company is straining to whitewash fake sales either through fabricated expenses, acquisitions, capital 


expenditures or cash balances.   


1) Advertising Expenses Simply Not Credible 





Real Nutri’s reported advertising expenses are a fiscal black hole.  The Company’s spending is unusually 


high on both an absolute and relative basis when compared to other nutritional supplement and health drink 


companies.  Yet the Company has comparatively little to show for such enormous expenses.  


Real Nutri claimed that it spent RMB 320 million, RMB 348 million and RMB 346 million on advertising 


expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which amounted to 16%, 18% and 20% of the Company’s 


reported revenues in those years.  In aggregate, Real Nutri claims to have spent a staggering RMB 1 billion 


on advertising expenses over the last three years, an amount which would put it on par with China’s 


most famous brands and easily exceeds the advertising expenses of other, much more well-known, dietary 


supplement brands.   


To put Real Nutri’s absurd advertising expenses into context, if true, Real Nutri would be among the top 


30 spenders on advertising of all Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges:

Not surprisingly, the biggest spenders on advertising in the list above are some of China’s most well-known 


brands: China Unicom, BYD and Yanjing Beer.  By comparison, Real Nutri is a regional brand with a 


presence in Eastern China.  Is it credible that its reported advertising footprint matches some of China’s 


most popular national brands? We think not.

Similarly, Real Nutri’s reported advertising expenses easily dwarf some of the most well-known companies 


in the dietary supplement and nutrition business.  The following list, compiled by China’s National Bureau 


of Statistics, ranks PRC-based dietary supplement by brand awareness.  By-health (汤臣倍健; SZ: 300146) 


is ranked #1 overall, and Tai Tai Pharmaceutical (太太药业 a.k.a. 健康元药业; SH: 600380) is ranked #8.  


Real Nutri is not even ranked.

Even though Real Nutri is not ranked on the National Bureau of Statistics list of top dietary supplement 


brands, it supposedly spends much more on advertising (on an absolute basis and as a percentage of 


revenues) then its more well-known competitors.   





As shown above, the top brands compiled by National Bureau of Statistics of PRC spend less than 10% of 


the revenue on advertising.  Real Nutri, a less well-known regional brand, claims to have spent 2x more 


than By-Health, 17x more than Jia Da Onlly and 7x more than Tai Tai on advertising in 2014.   


Such reported spending is simply not credible.  Even though it spends less than half the amount of Real 


Nutri on advertising, By-Health is a nationally recognized brand that has marshalled advertising campaigns 


led by famous athletes such as Yao Ming.   





By-Health Advertisement 


Comparatively, what does Real Nutri have to show for RMB 1 billion in advertising expenses over the last 


three years?  Real Nutri spends much more than other dietary supplement brands, yet is comparatively 


obscure and has little to show for such spending in the form of endorsements or brand awareness.
30 
 


Real Nutriceutical Group Limited │ HK: 2010                       www.glaucusresearch.com 





We do not believe that such reported expenses are credible, rather we believe that such expenses are a 


convenient black hole on the Company’s income statement to swallow some of its fabricated “profits.”    


2) Questionable Capital Expenditures 





Despite aggregate capital expenditures exceeding RMB 1.5 billion since 2011, the return on such spending 


is so unquestionably abysmal that we believe its reported capital expenditures have been fabricated to mask 


inflated sales and profits.  


According to its public filings, Real Nutri has reportedly spent RMB 330 million, RMB 305 million, RMB 


452 million and RMB 459 million on capital expenditure in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.  Such 


capital expenditures are so significant that they account for 78%, 88%, 72% and 71% of the 


Company’s reported cash flows from operations during those years.   


The returns on such spending have been dismal.  From 2011 through 2014, the Company’s aggregate capital 


expenditures were RMB 1.5 billion, while revenue increased by only RMB 705 million during that four 


year period.  In other words, the Company’s reported capital spending was double the increase in its 


revenue over the last four years.  Put simply, despite such massive expenditures, Real Nutri has little to 


show for it.  





The inefficacy of Real Nutri’s spending is obvious.  Not only did aggregate capital expenditures exceed the 


increase in revenue from 2011 through 2014, but its return on assets steadily deteriorated from 17% in 2011 


to 9.8% in 2014.  This is not the only indicator that Real Nutri is getting little in return for such massive 


reported expenditures.  


Real Nutri’s fixed asset turnover ratio, a measurement of the return on capital expenditures, steadily 


declined from 2.17x in 2011 to an abysmal 1.06x in 2014.  Compare Real Nutri’s returns to the fixed asset 


turnover ratio of By-Health, which has steadily remained between 2.56x and 3.11x over the last four years.  


By contrast, Real Nutri’s reported returns on its massive reported capital expenditures are so abysmal that 


in our opinion, such spending appears obviously fabricated.  


A detailed analysis of the Company’s reported capital spending corroborates the previous public 


accusations of fraud, and in our opinion, Real Nutri’s returns on its reported spending are so abysmal, on 


both an absolute basis and relative to its peers such as By-Health, that the spending appears fabricated to 


offset fabricated profits.

3) The Mystery of Advanced Technical Know-How 





Since its IPO, Real Nutri has carried a mysterious and inexplicable line item on its balance sheet: advance 


payments for acquisition of ‘technical know-how.’4F5  This balance has increased from RMB 27 million 


at the time of the Company’s IPO to over RMB 100 million since 2011.  





Real Nutri gives little detail on the nature of this ‘advanced know-how,’ but every year it states that it 


expects to be granted a license by the PRC government which will enable the Company to complete the 


acquisition.  Each year, the expected date for obtaining the license keeps getting pushed back, all the while 


the balance of advanced payments grows.  Meanwhile, Real Nutri never tells investors from whom it is 


purchasing such ‘know-how’ or why exactly it is required to pay in advance for an unlicensed and 


presumably unpatented process.

We are highly suspicious of this reported balance sheet item.  Real Nutri does not build rockets or make 


electric cars.  It makes dietary supplements.  What possible advanced know-how could it be purchasing 


which requires a RMB 100 million in deposits so many years in advance?  Real Nutri is not purchasing 


protected intellectual property, such as a patented formula.  Nor is it purchasing a brand or product line.  


Why does the Chinese government not license the technical process? Why does Real Nutri have to commit 


capital today, for an unlicensed, presumably unpatented technique which has not come to fruition in six 


years?  


In our opinion, this balance sheet item appears simply fabricated, a sham category of expenditures designed 


to mask fabricated profits.

4) Sham Acquisition 





On 29 Jun 2014, Real Nutri announced the acquisition of 60% Magic Galaxy Worldwide Limited (“Magic 


Galaxy”), 5F6 a PRC-based pharmaceutical company which produced eye drops, for an aggregate 


consideration of RMB 200 million. 6F7  The Company implied to investors that the acquired business 


generated a net profit of RMB ~35 million in 2014. 7F8  Publicly available government records indicate that 


this acquisition was a sham.     





Mofcom filings show that Magic Galaxy’s only operating subsidiary, Anhui Province Shuangke 


Pharmaceutical Company Limited (安徵省雙科藥業有限公司), generated a net loss in 2014 (and not a 


RMB 35 million profit as claimed). 8F9  


 
Source: 2014 Mofcom Filings – Anhui Province Shuangke Pharmaceutical 


In our opinion, the Mofcom filings provide conclusive evidence that the reported profitability of the 


acquisition was fabricated.  But there is more.

8 ~RMB35m was estimated by the “profit allocated to non-controlling interests” in annual report 2014 P. 108.  Because the 


acquisition was held in mid-2014, the profit is aggregated by the formula: (RMB7m x 2)/0.4 = RMB35m.  
9 Transfer pricing or offshore transaction arrangements cannot account for the missing profit because according to the Company’s 


annual report, the business is described “sales and manufacturing of high end eye drop products in the PRC” and had no offshore 


operations.  2014 Annual Report, p. 102.

sheet, RMB 267 million of which was recorded as a PRC patent associated with the production and 


manufacture of eye-drops.

Mofcom filings of the acquired operating subsidiary show non-current assets at FYE 2014 of only RMB 14 


million.  This is substantially less than the RMB 306 million in intangible assets that the Company told 


investors it was acquiring when it purchased Magic Galaxy.  


We believe that this was simply a sham acquisition, designed either to conceal fabricated profits or perhaps 


funnel money out of the public company for the secret benefit of insiders.  Filings suggest that rather than 


purchase a business which generated a RMB 35 million profit, Real Nutri spent RMB 200 million to buy a 


money-losing eye drop producer with negligible intangible assets.    


It is also highly likely, in our opinion, that, if do not alert the market, Real Nutri will soon announce the 


acquisition of the remaining 40% of Magic Galaxy at what we believe to be a massively inflated price.

RETAIL SALES DATA INDICATES FABRICATED REPORTED SALES 


CMH is a leading independent market research firm, specializing in the healthcare sector.  CMH employs 


a monitoring system to track the sales of drugs and nutritional supplements to consumers in China and 


compiles the data into annual rankings of the best-selling nutritional supplements and products.   


The CMH rankings compile data for sales at pharmacies and drug stores throughout China.  Based on 


conversations with industry experts, we estimate that at least 25-30% of Real Nutri’s sales are through 


pharmacies and drug stores, yet it fails to appear on the CMH rankings.   


1) Real Nutri’s Sales a Fraction of By-Health’s 


 
CMH compiled a ranking of the top 20 best-selling healthcare and nutritional supplements in 2013.  None 


of Real Nutri’s products, including its supposedly popular amino-acid based supplements, appear on 


CMH’s rankings.   


By contrast, By-Health (SHZ: 300146), which reported total sales in 2013 of only RMB 1.5 billion 


(compared to Real Nutri’s reported RMB 1.9 million in sales that year), has seven nutritional products 


on CMH’s lists (ranked 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 15 and 19).    





Source: 2013 CMH Supplement Sales Rankings 


 
CMH reports that the cumulative retail value of sales of By-Health’s top seven products was RMB 2.6 


billion in 2013.  By-Health’s reported revenue was RMB 1.5 billion, because like Real Nutri, it sells through 


a network of third-party distributors who mark up the manufacturing price to the retail price.   





To put the CMH data in perspective, By-Health reported RMB 1.5 billion in total sales in 2013, 22% less 


than Real Nutri.  Yet CMH reported that seven of By-Health products made the top twenty list, compared 


to zero from Real Nutri.

The ubiquity of By-Health’s products on the CMH health product rankings contrasts with the stark absence 


of any of Real Nutri’s products, corroborating the rest of the evidence in this report that Real Nutri is 


massively exaggerating its reported sales.   


2) CMH Rankings Indicate Sales of Flagship Product Less than RMB 100mm in 2013 





CMH reported that the 20th ranked product on its 2013 list had RMB 216 million in total retail sales in 


2013.  According to the Company’s prospectus and annual reports, Real Nutri’s reported sales from its 


flagship product should have significantly exceeded this amount.  For the nine months ended September 


30, 2009, Real Nutri reported that sales of its Ruinian-branded amino acid-based tablets were RMB 193 


million.

Assuming that sales of Real Nutri’s flagship product, Ruinian-branded amino acid-based tablets, has grown 


at par with the Company’s health and nutritional supplement segment since the IPO (a conservative 


assumption), expected total sales of its flagship product should have exceeded RMB 542 million in 2013.  


Assuming that drug stores and pharmacies account for 25% of its total sales, we estimate that its flagship 


product should have generated at least RMB 135 million in sales for the Company through this channel. 


But remember that the CMH rankings are based on retail sales, which includes roughly a 1.5x mark-up 


from the manufacturing price.  Real Nutri primarily sells its products through third party distributors, 


meaning its reported sales represent the manufacturing price of its products.   





If we estimate that sales of its flagship product generated RMB 135 million in revenues for the Company 


in 2013, then we calculate that the retail sales of the flagship product through pharmacies and drug stores 


should have been at least RMB 339 million.   


Yet CMH’s rankings indicate that sales for Real Nutri’s flagship product do not exceed RMB 216 million 


in retail sales at pharmacies and drug stores, implying that the Company has likely exaggerated sales of its 


flagship product.
39 
 


Real Nutriceutical Group Limited │ HK: 2010                       www.glaucusresearch.com 














By our estimation, the CMH sales data indicates that reported sales of Real Nutri’s flagship product are 


exaggerated by at least 57% (likely much, much more), which corroborates the wealth of evidence 


presented in this reported supporting the same conclusion.

REAL NUTRI’S SUPPOSED EFFICIENCY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 


Real Nutri reported RMB 2.17 million of revenue per employee in 2014, which significantly exceeds the 


revenues-per-employee reported by its peers, including By-Health (RMB 0.85 million per employee), Jiao 


Da Onlly (0.54 million per employee) and Tai Tai (RMB 0.87 million per employee).   





In our experience, when management teams exaggerate sales and growth numbers, they often forget to give 


a commensurate boost to other operational metrics such as employee headcount. Thus, productivity ratios 


and other efficiency ratios that significantly deviate from the industry standard are often red flags when 


accompanied by suspiciously amazing financial performance.  Indeed, this was a key clue in our 


investigation revealing that China Metal Recycling (“CMR”) was fabricated its reported financials.   


Like CMR, which was halted and liquidated subsequent to a Glaucus report, we believe that Real Nutri 


simply forgot to increase its headcount when it inflated its sales figures, as there is no feasible way that 


Real Nutri can produce nutritional products four to five times more efficiently than its nearest competitors.  


Ultimately, Real Nutri’s reported productivity is an outlier and further evidence that its financials are 


fabricated.

INEXPLICABLE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS 


Real Nutri has historically claimed a large cash balance, exceeding RMB 1.3 billion in each of the last three 


FYs (2012-2014).  Despite excessive cash reserves, the Company has also reportedly taken short term loans 


of RMB 195 million, RMB 435 million and RMB 884 million, at an implied interest rate of 12.0%, 5.9% 


and 4.2% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.   





Why would a Company with such a healthy cash balance take out short term loans, especially at interest 


rates far exceeding the rate received for the Company’s existing bank balances?  We suspect that the 


Company’s reported cash reserves, like its reported revenues and profits, are significantly overstated, which 


explains why Real Nutri needs to engage in short term borrowing a higher interest rates to make up the 


short-fall and fund its continuing operations.
42 
 


Real Nutriceutical Group Limited │ HK: 2010                       www.glaucusresearch.com 





NEGATIVE FREE CASH FLOW & THE ILLUSION OF DIVIDENDS 


We believe that Real Nutri has successfully deflected at least some of the market’s suspicion regarding its 


financial performance by consistently paying dividends.  Indeed, since its IPO, Real Nutri has declared 


~RMB 296 million in dividends to shareholders.  But a closer look at Real Nutri’s financials reveal that 


such dividends are not paid out of money generated by the business, but from the proceeds of capital raised 


from debt and equity holders.  


Since 2010, the Company has raised RMB 2 billion in proceeds from the capital markets, of which it has 


declared a dividend of roughly RMB 296 million (~13% of capital raised).  





The Company consistently generates EBITDA margins of 40-45% and net income margins of 24-30%.  


Despite such purported profitability, Real Nutri is still a serial capital raiser, because its cash flows used 


in investing (in dubious capital expenditures and acquisitions of questionable authenticity) typically 


exceeds reported cash flows from operations.  This trend looks set to continue.  On October 6, 2015, Real 


Nutri announced a HKD $325 million rights issuance, supposedly to fund the proposed acquisition of a 


chain of retail drug stores in the PRC.

Like CMED and CMR, despite supposedly generating consistent and world-beating profit margins, Real 


Nutri is forced to return to the capital markets to raise funds.  In our experience, this is a tell-tale sign of 


fabricated financial statements.   


Real Nutri has so far distributed to investors only 13% of fund raised from the capital markets.  Such 


dividends are not financed by Real Nutri’s operating business, and without continuing access to outside 


sources of financing, it will be unable to pay them going forward.

CHINESE SOE QUIETLY CASHED OUT AT A LOSS 


In May 2013, Newport Consulting Limited (“Newport”) subscribed to RMB 200 million of convertible 


bonds issued by the Company. 9F10  As of October 2014, Newport became a subsidiary of China Shipbuilding, 


a PRC-based state owned enterprise (“SOE”). 


Newport subscribed to the first tranche of convertible bonds with the option to subscribe for a second 


tranche of bonds, worth RMB 400 million.  The long stop date for subscription to the second tranche was 


January 22, 2015.  China Shipbuilding opted not to exercise its option to acquire the second tranche of 


bonds.  This is the first red flag, as the Chinese SOE opted not to increase its investment in the Company.  


Then, on July 10, 2015, Real Nutri announced that it received a notice from Newport to convert all of its 


RMB 200 million worth of convertible bonds to 66.67 million shares (4.33% after dilution) of the Company 


at strike price of HK$3.00.10F11  Three days prior to the date of the notice, Real Nutri’s stock traded below 


HKD 2.00 and closed at HKD 2.00 on July 10, 2015 (the notice date).   


This decision is simply inexplicable unless the SOE desperately wanted to get out of its investment. As a 


logical and professional investor, given that Real Nutri’s stock had been trading below HK$3.00 since June 


5, 2015, with average daily volume of 21.6 million shares in June 2015, it makes no sense to convert the 


bonds at a 50% premium to the last traded price.  In exchange, the SOE could have accumulated the same 


number of shares in 3-4 trading days.   


The SOE’s decision to convert its bonds at HKD 3.00, when Real Nutri’s stock traded below or at HKD 


2.00, resulted in a substantial realized loss.  The only reason why an investor would take such a loss is to 


get out of its investment in Real Nutri, which is exactly what the SOE did.  


Upon conversion, Newport transferred the converted shares (66.67 million) to a nominee, who was 


described as an independent third party.  In other words, following the conversion, China Shipbuilding, 


through Newport, fully exited its position as a shareholder of Real Nutri.   


The Company has attempted to spin the conversion as a positive development, but the only way to explain 


the SOE’s decision to realize a loss by converting at a price well above the trading price is that the SOE 


wanted to quickly get out of its position, something it accomplished upon conversion.  Investors should be 


wary.

VALUATION 


We think the most appropriate comparison to Real Nutri is CMED, the US-listed company which defrauded 


investors and creditors by fabricating its reported financial performance.  When we alerted the market to 


CMED’s malfeasance, CMED’s management went dark and absconded with the assets, leaving 


shareholders and creditors almost nothing to recover.  


In this report, we presented a wealth of publicly available evidence to support our opinion that Real Nutri’s 


sales are 84% less than reported and net income is 99% less than reported to investors and regulators 


in the Company’s Hong Kong filings.  


Given the credible accusations in the local media regarding exaggerated capital expenditures, we also doubt 


the reported value of Real Nutri’s property, plant and equipment.  We also believe that the Company has 


inflated the value of assets such as its cash balance. After all, if a company is booking fake sales, such 


receipts must be accounted for on the balance sheet. 


Despite a purportedly healthy cash balance, Real Nutri has inexplicably taken on short-term debt of RMB 


884 million, which would be senior to any shareholder recovery.   


Given the limited offshore assets available for seizure and the difficulty recovering onshore assets (property 


and equipment) under China’s byzantine judicial system, our price target on its HKEX-listed shares is HKD 


0.00.
