Citron Exposes the Vulnerability of 
Motorola Solutions…Price Target - $45 





What would President Trump think about U.S. Law 
Enforcement Agencies Paying 5 TIMES the Prices  


Motorola Charges EU Countries? 
 


Background 
 


Motorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) was created when Motorola spun off their 
telecommunications division in 2011.  With an 85% market share of radio 
communications for law enforcement and other first responders (FR), 
Motorola has used its dominant position in a fragmented customer base to 
control the market for first responder communications in North America.  
Motorola also has a worldwide presence selling broadband networks and 
equipment though numerous partnerships.   
 


But it's time investors start to realize … 
 


How Motorola Really Makes Its Money! 
 


While Motorola’s has many operating divisions, the bulk of its profits 
come from selling overpriced handsets into its single source contracts in 
the United States….taking advantage of both tax payers and the first 


responder community.  In fact, handset sales in the U.S. carry an 
83.6% gross margin (see below), while device sales in Europe are at 9%.  
 


    Citron’s analysis shows that U.S. device 
(handset) sales are contributing a whopping 76.7% 


of Motorola’s bottom line!

Read on to be appalled!! 
 


From a series of articles reported by McClatchy last year:  


 
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/economy/article24779224.html#storylink=cpy 


 
Motorola Solutions has been coasting on a simple formula: Dote on police, 
fire and sheriff’s departments; woo contracting officials; pursue every angle 
to gain a sole-source deal or an inside track, and where possible, embed 
equipment with proprietary features so it can’t interact with competitors’ 
products.    
 


These tactics are borderline anti-competitive and definitely stand out in 
stark contrast to the new age of government approach to spending: 
https://www.ems1.com/ems-products/communications/articles/2098335-Motorola-
fights-to-keep-spot-in-EMS-police-and-fire-communication-market/ 


This is exactly what MSI does when supplying U.S. first responders with 
critical communications equipment.  
 


What would President Trump say if Lockheed was 
charging the US Air Force 5 Times what it Charged 
the United Kingdom for an F-35 ?? 





 “The industry giant has landed scores of sole-source radio 
contracts and wielded enough pricing power to sell its glitzy 
handsets for as much as $7,000 apiece, at a taxpayer cost of 
hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that could have 
been saved in a more competitive market."

Citron can publish pages upon pages of documentation, but to make things 
easy and understandable we present one clear example.   
 
In 2016, the city of Chandler, Arizona bought 30 APX 6000 Police Radios 
from Motorola … here is the contract: 


http://www.chandleraz.gov/content/20160512_34.PDF 
 


After a “discount” Chandler paid $5,200 apiece for this radio:

   “We’re going out to bid in virtually 
every facet of our government.  
We are going to save a fortune.”

Compare this to the MTP-6550 radio sold to first responders in the U.K. 
 


 
http://www.tetrahandsetsandaccessories.co.uk/images/handsets/200/mtp6550.jpg 


Note the 6550 is their high-end product with a color screen, etc. Most 
police jurisdictions in the UK pay far less for their Motorola phones, for 
lower-end B/W screens.  The highest-end phone that Motorola sells to the 
UK government is significantly cheaper than the lowest end phone it sells 
to U.S. Law Enforcement agencies.

http://www.govtech.com/products/With-Friends-in-Government-Motorola-Beats-a-


Path-to-Telecom-Supremacy.html 


The reason why the UK and the rest of the world is less expensive is simple:  
Their LMR network (TETRA) is an open platform;  Motorola faces 
competition to sell in these markets.  
 


One former senior Motorola executive, who declined to be 
identified to avoid harming relationships, said that everybody 
knows that a cell phone costing a few hundred dollars is far 
more powerful than today’s two-way emergency radios. He 
said that public safety agencies shouldn’t be paying more 
than $800 for a “ruggedized cell phone.” 


About  
$975 apiece!

Competition on an Open Platform is 
Motorola’s Kryptonite  





Motorola’s overseas units, operating in TETRA markets, generate gross 
profit margins LESS THAN HALF of it U.S. corporate average. The reason is 
that Motorola doesn’t have monopoly control on the TETRA platform.  
 


 Note: Motorola has been able to exploit the system because the vast 
majority of U.S. contracts are awarded on a local level.  Yet, most are 
funded by government grants through DHS and/or the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, right from the US Taxpayer. 





In fact, Motorola has developed its own “in-house system” of procuring 
federal funding for these non-competitive, outdated, and overpriced 
projects.

  FirstNet: The Bomb for Motorola 
 


FirstNet is a communications system for first responders proposed after the 
9-11 disaster.  That dark day stressed our first responder system on a 
national level like no other, exposing major vulnerabilities in our disaster 
infrastructure.  Specifically, our first responders were grievously impacted 
by their inability to respond to the disaster across multiple jurisdictions.   
 


The U.S. has moved (albeit slowly) to develop an independent, 
interoperable communication system for first responders.  Finally, AT&T 
will likely begin the build out in 2017. 
 


As the Federal government has a strong interest in stimulating competition 
and innovation in first responder communications, they are doing it 
through the support of FirstNet. Wilbur Ross, President Trump’s appointed 
Secretary of Commerce who will oversee the major source of funding for 
local first responder communication systems, has already expressed his 
support for the project.
Citron Reports on Motorola Solutions February 7, 2017 Page 7 of 13 
 


FirstNet represents the two words Motorola hates to hear:  


Competition and Innovation. 
 


Despite the obvious bullshit kicked by MSI management, it is no secret that 
they have lobbied long and hard to put the kibosh on FirstNet. 
 


An especially lucid statement about FirstNet was just published in Police 
Chief Magazine, January 2017 edition: 
 


 
http://www.firstnet.gov/newsroom/blog/technology-talk-firstnet-delivering-21st-century-tools-law-enforcement 





Motorola’s lobbying campaign got so bad that it prompted a scathing letter 
from Senator Jay Rockefeller (West Virginia) :  


 
http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/why-police-and-firefighters-struggle-to-communicate-in-crises/457443/ 


As stated clearly in Motorola’s risk factors, in their 10-K: 


 
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/68505/000006850516000017/msi201510-k.htm 


Longer term, MSI’s opportunities to sell LTE 


equipment and related services in this space will 


be substantially impacted by: (1) the deployment 


model being developed by FirstNet, which has been 


heading in a direction more favorable to 


commercial carriers  … 


 (4) FirstNet’s stated intent to reduce handset 


prices; 


"I will not stand by while your company continues to defend 
a business plan solely because you are unwilling to make the 
investments and commitments necessary to be a true 
competitor on the new level playing field for public-safety 
communications equipment …" 


" Just as smart phones have created a new era of real-time 
information and connectivity for individuals, the FirstNet 
network will enable services, devices, and applications that 
provide the public safety community with the tools they need 
to save lives.”

How the U.S. Government Can Regulate the 
“Motorola Monopoly   





Just like the pharmaceutical industry was a problem already known by 
Congress, so is the “Motorola Monopoly”. 
 


Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, who serves on the United States House 
Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology stated in a 
report to Congress:  
 


 
https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg97652/html/CHRG-114hhrg97652.htm 


As suggested by knowledgeable stakeholders in the space, the U.S. 
Department of Commerce can easily access a list of all the DHS grants to 
state and local agencies that have selected Motorola as their vendor for 
public safety equipment and devices, and assure these bids were 
competitive.   
 


The Department of Commerce has already explored this issue in the past 
and it will be on no secret to them that taxpayers are being exploited. 
 


“$5,000 public safety radios are out, o-u-t, so there Is -- I 
don't even -- I don't want to hear about them anymore. As far 
as I am concerned, they don't exist, and I don't think any of 
the dollars that are being provided should go to anything … 
like that. That is yesterday.”

The Future 





With or without government regulation or even FirstNet, the days of 
Motorola’s closed end business are numbered.

“Push-to-Talk” is Motorola’s Rapidly Obsolescing Secret Sauce 
 


Motorola has maintained its near-monopoly on the U.S.’s first responder 
market with its proprietary LMR channel for “push-to-talk” (e.g. “walkie-
talkie”) functionality, which first responders have long relied upon.  But 
technology advances are rapidly enabling cell phones to transmit voice 
communications as fast and reliably as two-way radios, a development that 
eventually will crumble the company’s radio franchise. 
 


Just last week South Korea, which has completely updated its police 
communications in anticipation of the 2018 Olympics, launched an 
advanced push to talk solution over an LTE Network.

“The change that Motorola is getting hit with is no less 
substantial than what hit IBM or Kodak.  It’s a technology wave.” 


--  Steve Koman, a former Motorola employee, consultant to the city of Charlotte, N.C 





“Any appearance that there would be a fair, competitive 
bidding process ’was a ruse’ ” 


--  Steve Overacker, Contra Costa County’s then telecommunications manager

Later this month in Barcelona Wireless World, many vendors, including 
Nokia, will be showcasing their Mission Critical Push-to-Talk Technology, 
which will make Motorola’s $5K handsets stand out in stark contrast as a 
thing of the past.  
 


The chart below was prepared for Fairfax County, Virginia to assess the cost 
of Motorola’s LMR vs. an advanced LTE system:  This shows you exactly 
where the industry is moving: 





 
The Dirty Verdict 
 


What are the actual financial impacts for investors as Motorola loses its 
monopoly pricing power on U.S. handsets?  What happens to its valuation? 
Let’s start here.  In European markets, Motorola competes with Nokia’s and 
Ericson’s equipment.  How does it compare with those companies on an 
EBITDA basis?  
 


  
Multiple on  


2018E EBITDA 


Ericsson 5.4x 


Nokia 6.5x 


Average 6.0x 





Motorola Solutions 9.7x

Here’s our analysis of the massive gross margin discrepancy when 
comparing Motorola’s business in Germany and the U.S.

36.4% 36.4% 


Assumed Systems Margin 
 


36.4% 36.4% 


Implied Margin on Device Sales   9.2% 83.6% 
 
Through either government scrutiny or just evolution of technology, MSI 
gross margins on its US handset business WILL be cut in half or more in the 
coming years.   
 
Citron thinks that MSI’s gross margins on handsets are likely to re-base to 
the mid-30s, and head toward single digits, in line with its own European 
margins for handset makers that face greater competition.  Using this 
“normalized” earnings level, we see MSI generating around $3.50 of 
normalized earnings.  As the market recognizes the secular pressures on 
MSI, we see the multiple re-rating to 12x to reflect a more commoditized 
handset maker.  This places MSI shares 50% lower than its current trading 
value.   
 


Or you can look at it this way.  Just by losing half the gross margin in its 
monopoly-priced U.S. proprietary handset business, MSI's gross profit 
companywide falls nearly 40%. (We’re still valuing its services and 
competitive products business generously).

This is our homework that extrapolates the gross margin impact on EBITDA.

Conclusion 
 


With the arrival of the Trump Administration, and its management style of 
introducing business-style negotiations into the Government’s contracting 
for goods and services, plus the maturing and emergence of open-platform 
FirstNet, it appears the no lobbying, high paid consultants, football tickets, 
golf outings, or Las Vegas conferences can overcome the forces driving 
competition and innovation.    
 


Reflecting on our “F-35” comparison from early in this piece, at least the F-
35 represents a state-of-the-art technology product of U.S. industry.  
Ironically, Motorola’s LMR-P25 platform deployed in the U.S. is older than 
either the LMR-Tetra deployed in the U.K. or the LTE technology employed 
in Europe.  Just like drugs, we pay more in the U.S.  But unlike drugs, we get 
less.  
 


When Motorola transforms itself into a services company, 
shareholders will not be happy with contracting gross margins 
and multiples.
