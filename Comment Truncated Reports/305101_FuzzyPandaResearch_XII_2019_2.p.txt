22nd Century Group – Key Patents Behind MRTP & 
PMTA Applications Have Expired! 
We are short XXII because we discovered that the most important patents in XXII’s patent 
portfolio have now expired.  In fact, some of them expired in 2018!   


From the evidence we uncovered, we believe that these expired patents (the QPT family of 
patents) are the primary patents behind the Brand A/VLN (very low nicotine) cigarettes.  Those 
who have been tracking XXII for a while know that Brand A/VLN Cigs are the exact same 
cigarettes that XXII submitted their FDA applications for their MRTP (Modified Risk Tobacco 
Product) and PMTA (Premarket Tobacco Product Applications).  This patent expiration is 
important because it means that even if XXII were successful in getting FDA approvals, then Big 
Tobacco companies would be able to come out with similar products by developing their own 
tobacco plant strain using the expired patents   


The patent expiration finally explains why British American Tobacco walked away from their 
XXII license agreement 2 years ago.  As a reminder it would’ve cost BAT only $3 million in 
license fees for what XXII says is “game changing technology.”  BAT evidently didn’t think it 
was worth the cost and now we know why.   


Essential Patents Expired! (QPT Patent Family expired in 2018) 
XXII’s disclosed in the 2017 10-K that the QPT patent family expired in 2018.  When you think 
QPT Patents, we want you to realize that these are the essential patents behind Brand A/VLN 
Cigarettes for which XXII filed their MRTP and PMTA applications. 


From 2017 10-K pg 12 


“Our patent protection relation to the QPT gene expires in 2018.  The expiration of the 
QPT patent family will give third-parties the freedom to target to the QPT gene in 
experiments…”

Brand A/VLN cigarettes are used in MRTP & PMTA Applications: 
We will first show below that Brand A/VLN (aka Spectrum cigarettes) are the cigarettes that 
XXII’s MRTP and PMTA applications are based on.  Then we will show that the QPT patent 
family is  the essential patents group  behind Vector 21-41 tobacco, which we believe is the 
tobacco used in Brand A Cigarettes.  


On December 27, 2018, 22nd Century submitted to the FDA the Company’s MRTPA 
for its BRAND A product under the proposed brand name of VLNTM cigarettes… The 
MRTPA states that 22nd Century’s proposed VLNTM cigarettes are the same as the 
lowest nicotine content style of the Company’s SPECTRUM® research cigarettes.

Also shown on Pg 9 2018 10-k: 





Brand A cigarettes, Spectrum, and VLN cigarettes are the same: 





(pg 37 of 2018 10-K) 


 
Tobacco for Spectrum/Brand A cigarettes (Vector 21-41) comes 
from the expired QPT patents: 
The problem for XXII is that the tobacco used in Spectrum and Brand A cigarettes is believed to 
be from a tobacco plant called Vector 21-41. The Vector 21-41 tobacco plant was developed (pg. 
16) at North Carolina State University by Dr. Mark Conkling. The Vector 21-41 works by 
suppressing the QPTase gene. The Vector 21-41 plant was developed from the same QPT patent 
family that just expired in 2018.

More proof that Vector 21-41 comes from the QPT gene modifications.   


The approved application for the Vector 21-41 tobacco strain by the International Service for the 
Acquisition of Agri-Biotechs Applications specifically references modifying the QPT gene. 





QPT Patents are expired! 
QPT Patent Family – This group of patents is focused on genetically altering the DNA 
encoding on the QPT enzyme in order to lower the nicotine level that the plants produce.  The 
tobacco for XXII’s VLN/Brand A cigarettes is produced primarily using these patents.  We have 
emailed management to confirm this and given them over 2 weeks to respond, but they have still 
not responded.   


According to the below chart and the patent database, there are 8 patents that consist of the QPT 
Patent Family.  The first issued ones and most important ones expired in 2018 and 3 other ones 
expire later in 2019 (starting next month).  The expiration of the patents in 2018 allows big 
tobacco companies to start working on developing a low nicotine tobacco strain based on 
modifying the QPT gene if they want to.

Patents – 6,423,520; 6,586,661; 7,425,670; 7,605,308; 7,645,925 – All expired in 2018

In their 2018 10-K, XXII management admits that the expiration of the QPT Patent Family will 
allow third parties to target the QPT gene and work on developing their own tobacco plant that 
would be similar to the Vector 21-41 plant.   





FY 2018 – 10K Pg 13 


Based on XXII’s unwillingness to disclose bad news, we do not expect them to confirm for investors or 
acknowledge on conference calls how important the expiration of the QPT patents are.

Competition – Big Tobacco already has low-nicotine patents:  
As XXII admits, any tobacco company can make low nicotine cigarettes using the exact same 
methods as XXII via QPT gene modification, provided they wanted to.  They cannot use the 
exact same Vector 21-41 plant in their cigarettes until 2023 due to it being under “Plant Variety 
Protection,” but if they wished to, they could use the same methods to modify the QPT gene in 
order to develop their own new plant varietal.  As we illustrated in our initial article on XXII 
“22nd Century – Cutting through the Smoke & Hype – 75% downside,” Big Tobacco companies 
do not need the Vector 21-41 plant as they have all been capable of growing low nicotine 
tobacco for a while and already have very robust low nicotine patent portfolios.   


Recent developments confirm that Big Tobacco has other means of meeting the FDA’s low 
nicotine tobacco requirements if those regulations come into effect. 


RJ Reynolds presentation (slides 10-20) from September 2018 shows 7 cases including Vector 
21-41 where researchers were able to reduce nicotine content by over 90%.  


1. Vector 21-41 (2001): 92.5% nicotine reduction 
2. Wang (2008): 97% nicotine reduction 
3. Shoji & Hashimoto (2003): 93% to 97% nicotine reduction 
4. DeBoer (2009): 96.2% nicotine reduction 
5. Lewis (2015): 94% nicotine reduction 
6. Shoji & Hashimoto (2011): 99% to 97% nicotine reduction 
7. Kato (2014): 95% nicotine reduction 


British American Tobacco just published a new patent (WIPO Patent # WO 2018/237107 Al) 
in December 2018 for their own low nicotine tobacco plant.

BAT wasn’t willing to pay $3 MILLION for XXII Patents! 
Independent major tobacco company British American Tobacco let its partnership with XXII 
expire when it would cost only $3 million in license fees over the next two years to have 
exclusivity over the commercialization of XXII's patent portfolio. In other words, some of the 
smartest tobacco investors in the world decided that XXII's "tech" is worth less than a $3m call 
option.

Here is the September 2017 press release by XXII on BAT not deciding exercise their option to 
license XXII's patents. (Press Release)

A recent lawsuit brings into question the ethical standards of XXII’s 
CEO and suggests the CEO of XXII is an unscrupulous character. 
In the lawsuit Global Tobacco LLC v. 22nd Century Group, (Case # 2:15-cv-05227-RGK-PJW) 
Global Tobacco alleges that CEO Henry Sicignano and a man named Trey Prevost have teamed 
up to steal, copy and capitalize on the existing goodwill of a popular brand of cigars called 
Clipper. XXII at the direction of Sicignano designed, manufactured and sold a brand of cigars 
called Cigar Cartel, which were designed to look exactly like a successful competing brand 
called Clipper Cigars. If the patents that XXII holds are so valuable, why would the CEO of 
XXII spend time to personally authorize and direct the plagiarizing of a competing brand of 
cigars? And why is the CEO associating himself with Trey Prevost, a man with a history of 
criminal activity? (see WSJ story on Trey pleading guilty to a felony)  


The case was settled out of court, but interestingly XXII now manufactures Clipper cigars for 
Global Tobacco, and we believe Global Tobacco is one of XXII’s largest contract manufacturing 
customers. Given the nature of the relationship between Global Tobacco and XXII, we believe 
the economics of the relationship should be questioned.  We think this could explain why their 
contract manufacturing business has such terrible gross margins (just 3% in 2018 and -4.3% in 
2017). 


See below for a photo of XXII Cartel cigars vs Clipper Cigars from the lawsuit.  You can judge 
for yourself if XXII copied Clipper’s intellectual property:

SEC Investigation update: 
In October we published SEC FOIA’s in an article “FOIA’s reveal undisclosed SEC 
Investigation” that showed that the company was under active investigation.  Instead of 
addressing that for shareholders, management has focused on telling investors that they currently 
don’t have an “SEC Enforcement action.”  This specific wording of “Enforcement Action” is 
word-play by XXII management meant to confuse investors.  An enforcement action only comes 
at the conclusion of an investigation.  So they are trying to disprove the existence of an SEC 
investigation by saying that they don’t have an “Enforcement Action.” 





For more information on SEC Investigations & Enforcement Actions, please see the SEC 
Website. 


We reiterate that the SEC’s responses to FOIAs on XXII and subsequent appeals that were 
denied are clear.  There is an active SEC Investigation into XXII, and the SEC is utilizing a 7a) 
exemption to deny Freedom of Information requests.

We encourage investors to do their own due diligence here.  It is easy to submit your own 
FOIA.  Click on this link, select XXII as the company you would like to FOIA, and then choose 
investigations.  For the vast majority of other public companies, you’ll get a reply citing no 
investigations found.  For XXII you should receive the same 7a denial (like the above) that we 
did on SEC letterhead stating that records are being withheld that could interfere with an 
investigation. 


We think this situation will end up similar to the one at Zion Oil & Gas where the company 
adamantly denied there being an SEC investigation and then months later filed an 8-k that they 
had received subpoenas from the SEC Ft. Worth office.

XXII other suspect practices: 
Fake Positive Articles - XXII has had fake positive articles published about their company.  
XXII and their investor communications firm IRTH Communications were at the center of a 
major expose by the author Sharesleuth.  


"Pretenders And Ghosts: Stealth Promotion Network Exploits Financial Sites To Tout Stocks" 


Boiler Room Calls - XXII & IRTH have also used boiler room style cold calls to try to convince 
investors to buy shares in XXII.  You can hear these actual phone calls soliciting an investment 
in the below YouTube Video: 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH1bo833bl0 


Paid Stock Promotion -We detailed extensively XXII’s paid stock promotions in our initial 
report on the company. 





Reverse Merger incorporated in Nevada - Public service reminder that XXII came public via a 
reverse merger from a mining company and is incorporated in the state of Nevada.

Summary: 
XXII’s essential patents, the QPT Patent Family, have now expired.  These patents were the key 
patents behind Vector 21-41 tobacco, which is the tobacco used in Brand A/VLN/Spectrum 
cigarettes, the tobacco that XXII used with their MRTP and PMTA applications with the FDA.  
The expiration of these patents means that XXII’s technology is no longer defensible, and it is 
finally clear why British America Tobacco did not think it was worth paying $3 million for 
exclusive rights to their patent portfolio. 


XXII management has been accused of stealing their customer’s intellectual property, paying for 
stock promotions, having fake positive articles written about the company, and worst of all now 
the “technology” & “patents” that this whole story has been built on have EXPIRED.   


We are short XXII and believe that their technology is worthless.
