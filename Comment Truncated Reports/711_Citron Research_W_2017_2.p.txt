TODAY REINFORCES WHY
$W WAYFAIR
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD
BE CONCERNED. MULTI-
CHANNEL – VALUATION –
SUPPLY CHAIN


Citron Reiterates Wayfair Short Term
$50 Target


Grocery stocks are getting hit hard today on the
fear of Amazon disrupting their supply chains. 
Similarly, as Amazon enters furniture, it breaks
Wayfair’s strategic hold on it supply chain.  (MAJOR
STATED RISK FACTOR IN WAYFAIR FILINGS)


 


1. The Gorilla Enters the Room. The
market reactions we see today in
Kroger, Target, and WalMart (all
pro�table) show the fear in the
market for businesses vulnerable to

competition from Amazon.


 


2. The importance of multi-channel
retailing. $AMZN proves that some 
e-commerce solutions absolutely
require local physical presence:
Groceries are one, and furniture is
the other.  Case-in-point: Amazon’s
new “Uni�ed Delivery with Services”
program for furniture.


 


3. Real companies get real valuations:
$WFM got bought for 10.7 times next
12 months EBIDTA.  $W is a
throwback to 1999, a business where
there’s never EBIDTA, just cumulative
losses.


4. Pro�ts? Never ever.  If Wayfair
couldn’t make money before
Amazon was a competitor, how can
they possibly ever become pro�table
with Amazon pushing hard into their
only marketplace?


 


5. Forget Bailout by Walmart. Do not
forget WalMart’s new national ad
campaign rollout for Hayneedle –
don’t expect any bailout for Wayfair
from Bentonville.

6. “Amazon Who?” Whenever an online
retailer’s CEO says on a conference
call he is “not concerned about
Amazon” — and dismisses them
saying they sell “batteries and books”
… it is time to be concerned about
your CEO.


 


7. Follow the Money: Insider selling
last 6 months for Whole Foods = $2
million, for Wayfair last 6 weeks $220
million.


 


8. Analyst Shmanalyst. The analysts
are so lost that the last upgrade on
Wayfair (Piper) did not even have the
word “Amazon” in the report. 
Analyzing an e-commerce company
without acknowledging Amazon is
like writing about the 2017 NBA
season and refusing to mention the
 G.S. Warriors.
