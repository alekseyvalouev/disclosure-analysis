Marubeni	(8002):	
The	Phantom	Earnings	 	 	 	 	 	 	 April	19,	2016	
	
	
Expect	auditors	to	restate	co.’s	Q3	earnings	and	reduce	FY16	profit	to	¥30	bn.	Marubeni	
yesterday	cut	FY16	net	income	forecast	from	¥180.9	bn	to	¥60	bn	due	to	impairments	in	
commodities	and	elsewhere.	We	believe	far	more	significant	writedowns	will	come,	a	view	
that’s	backed	by	analysts	covering	the	co.	and	even	the	Nikkei.		On	current	evidence	alone	
Marubeni’s	FY16	profit	should	be	no	more	than	¥30	bn.		
	
Gains	for	NOT	achieving	target.	Marubeni	booked	a	¥30	bn	gain	in	Q3	2016	results	for	a	
transaction	that	was	anticipated	but	did	NOT	happen	during	FY16.	As	a	result,	we	believe	
auditors	will	force	co.	to	restate	their	Q3	2016	numbers,	thus	cutting	FY16	profit	by	50%	to	
¥30bn.	With	this,	Marubeni	will	be	forced	to	show	a	loss	in	3Q	as	they	reported	a	profit	of	
only	¥20.6	bn	in	the	period.		
	
Convoluted	disclosure.	While	the	second	statement	Marubeni	issued	yesterday	was		
convoluted	and	sheltered	from	attention	by	the	weightier	announcement	of	a	two-thirds	
reduction	in	profit	forecast	for	FY16,	it	did	reveal	that	the	co.	failed	to	complete	a	deal	
slated	for	fiscal	year	ended	March	31.	According	to	accounting	rules,	the	co.	cannot	take	a	
gain	on	something	they	did	not	do	(as	they	did	in	Q3).	
	
	
DEAL	SYNOPSIS	
	
The	manipulation	was	generated	as	follows.	In	Dec.	25,	2015	Marubeni	said1	it	was	selling	
50%	of	Marubeni	Rail	Transport	Inc.	(“MRTI”)		to	Sumitomo	Mitsui	Trust	Bank	and	its	
subsidiary	Sumitomo	Mitsui	Trust	Panasonic	Finance	Co.,	Ltd.

In	light	of	the	transaction,	Marubeni	expected	to	recognize	a	gain	of	¥20	bn	in	their	non-
consolidated	accounts	as	a	gain	on	the	sale	and	also	recognize	a	revaluation	gain	of	¥30	bn	
for	the	deconsolidation	of	MRTI	after	losing	control.		
	
Indeed,	Marubeni	did	take	that	gain	of	¥30	bn	in	Q3	but	did	not	change	the	full	year	
forecast	of	¥180	bn2.	To	us,	this	looks	like	the	gain	was	made	to	plug	a	drop	in	profit.	
But,	the	real	problem	is	in	the	fact	that	the	gain	was	taken	in	the	first	place.	The	transaction	
did	not	close	as	expected	in	Q3.	So,	how	could	the	co.	take	a	revaluation	gain	on	the	
deconsolidation	of	a	subsidiary	when	the	shares	had	not	yet	been	sold?	Simply	put,	this	is	
booking	profit	before	making	a	sale,	also	known	as	accounting	games.	
Below	is	the	expected	timetable	of	the	transaction3:

As	can	be	seen	above,	the	agreement	was	executed	on	25	December	2015,	just	six	days	
before	the	end	of	Q3,	but	the	acquisition	was	only	“Planned”	to	be	completed	within	fiscal	
year	ended	March	31.	As	the	transaction	had	not	closed,	it	is	incredulous	that	they	took	the	
gain	in	Q3.	And	what	could	have	been	the	motivation	other	than	covering	a	looming	loss	for	
the	quarter?		
	
Having	the	cake	and	eating	it?	The	logic	becomes	even	stranger	to	follow	when	you	see	
that	Marubeni	has	acknowledged	that	it	cannot	book	the	non-consolidated	gain	until	FY17,	
during	which	the	transaction	is	expected	to	be	completed.	The	co.	noted	yesterday	that	,	
the	acquisition	has	not	closed	“because	obtaining	the	approval	of	the	relevant	authorities

has	not	been	completed	by	March	2016”4.		And	yet	the	¥30	bn	gain	in	the	consolidated	
accounts	is	allowed	to	stay	in	FY16.		
	
We	believe	this	is	a	highly	misleading	representation	of	financial	results	and	the	auditors	
will	order	the	statements	for	Q3	2016	to	be	restated	and	force	Marubeni	to	miss	their	FY16	
revised	forecast	by	50%.
