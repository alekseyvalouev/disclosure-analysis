Do Mako Investors Realize Their Tenuous Security Position In
Oceanica?

Summary


Mako Resources investors appear to have few rights to Oceanica assets due to
senior OMEX payable security. Mako investors need to ask serious questions.


Did Josh Adam of Mako negotiate this transaction at arm's length with OMEX in line
with his fiduciary duty?


Josh Adam, SVP Finance, used Highly Questionable brokers to raise capital for
Neptune (OMEX's other mining venture), according to recent disclosures.


Is the vague J.P. Morgan Oceanica connection merely through a local Chase Private
Client Florida branch attempting to sell unregistered securities to HNW investors?


There were two new disclosures on the most recent Odyssey Marine (NASDAQ:OMEX)
conference call held in March 2014:


1) Oceanica (OMEX's 54% controlled Bahamas>Panama>Mexican mining venture) has
less than $400k in the bank.


2) Oceanica has a payable of $10mm to OMEX for services performed.


These likely indicate Mako has a very compromised status with respect to their rights as
investors, and potentially indicate that Mako investors did not conduct their proper Due
Diligence or may have been misled. Is this why they chose not to exercise their options
December 31, when they were due to expire?


OMEX raising cash via Mako appears to us to be a "backdoor" capital raise that
circumvents the SEC securities registration rules required for public companies. Let's
understand why OMEX's Oceanica Capital Raise was very different than a typical venture
capital round, and not something we have ever seen before, because of the unnecessary
weakness and danger for investors:

Why would Mako investors agree to such an unfavorable investment structure? With
OMEX as both the controlling shareholder AND senior security holder, they could
potentially demand payment on their $10mm payable and wipe out the by definition
insolvent equity position (as Oceanica appears never to have directly raised equity itself).
Given the enormous capital requirements to test and prove a mine (still waiting for the
NI43-101 report…?), why would Mako be OK with their $27.5mm instead of being directly
injected into Oceanica, going to OMEX to pay for compensation and other unrelated
expenses? Didn't Neptune/Dorado's original investors get impaired in 2012 exactly
because of this structure?


"Odyssey has provided approximately $10 million of services to the Oceanica
subsidiary… if Oceanica were to raise funds itself, then they would pay $10 million of
cash to Odyssey in the future" - Philip Devine, CFO, March 17, 2014 OMEX
conference call


Now, if Oceanica tries to raise capital directly, guess where that cash is going? It is going
to cost a LOT more to prove and build a mine, and $10mm is going to go directly back to
the OMEX parent to… pay compensation and expenses unrelated to Oceanica? Mako

doesn't earn a dime if OMEX is successful at their other projects (though this has
historically not been a potential outcome). Why are they OK with being "behind the
elephant" in their lower seniority position as investors?


What is Mako Resources exactly?


Mako Resources is managed by Josh Adam out of a one-bedroom apartment next to
NYU, according to the SEC form D. Josh Adam represents himself to be a CFA
charterholder, and as manager of Mako, has a legal fiduciary duty to those investors who
have apparently given him $27.5mm. Given Josh's other connections to OMEX via
Neptune Minerals, we have questioned whether these are truly arm's-length transactions,
and these new disclosures deepen our concerns.


Still unanswered: Why does Oceanica need to be structured through multiple layers of
offshore subsidiaries in the Bahamas and Panama? We discussed in depth their
Panamanian partner, DNA Ltd. Inc.'s director's multiple connections to alleged criminal
activity in our original report at omextruth.com on Oct 31, 2013, which has still not been
credibly addressed by OMEX management.


What other capital raises has Josh Adam been involved with?


Neptune Minerals, OMEX's other undersea mining venture, where it owns 30%. While
apparently deeply insolvent, Neptune has been trying to raise capital at a valuation far
lower than OMEX's most recent representations to public investors. See our last Neptune
smoking-gun report for more details.


More interestingly, though, is a recent SEC disclosure, where Neptune (where Josh Adam
is senior VP of Finance) finally discloses what brokers has helped them raise capital. We
understand from our friends in Tampa that Josh boasts of bringing in the CRGs ("Certified
Rich Guys") from his NY connections. Who helps him (for fees of $388k at Neptune) bring
in the capital?

We'll start with National Securities Corporation, a firm that has 57 regulatory events on
file with FINRA. The list is long, but we will cover only some of the highlights here. The full
list is available on the FINRA website.


National Securities Corporation


In 2011, National Securities Corporation was censured and ordered to pay a fine of
$175,000 in restitution to investors for failing to have reasonable grounds for selling
private placements (is this similar to the Neptune deal currently being attempted?) to
customers of the firm, and for failing to conduct due diligence into the offering. The
findings also stated that Mathew Portes (a broker with the firm) and the firm became
aware of multiple red flags regarding an offering, including liquidity concerns, missed
interest payments and defaults, that should have put them on notice of possible problems,
but the firm continued to sell the offering to customers.  Given Odyssey just wrote off the
money loaned to Neptune last quarter (implying the junior equity security is worthless -
watch that $10mm payable carefully Mako!), we find this similarity striking.


FINRA found that Portes reviewed the PPMs of these offerings and diligence reports
others prepared, but the review was cursory. FINRA also found that the due diligence
reports noted significant risks, and specifically provided that its conclusions were
conditioned upon recommendations regarding guidelines, changes in the PPMs and
heightened financial disclosure of affiliated party practices, but the firm did not investigate,
follow up on or discuss any of these potential conflicts or risks with either the issuer or any
third-party. In addition, FINRA determined that the firm, acting through Mathew Portes,
failed to enforce reasonable supervisory procedures to detect or address potential "red
flags" as related to these offerings; and the firm, acting through Mathew Portes, failed to
maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable
securities laws and regulations.


What kind of due diligence has National Securities Corporation done on Neptune? Are
they aware that Neptune appears to be currently insolvent, according to Odyssey public
filings?


Further, why would the management of Neptune/Odyssey choose to work with a firm with
such a consistently questionable track record unless they were absolutely desperate?


It doesn't end there, here are just a few more of the recent multiple fines National
Securities Corporation has paid due to publicly known problems:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2144913-do-mako-investors-realize-their-tenuous-security-position-in-oceanica 6/21


In December of 2012, to resolve allegations that the firm ignored red flags involving
instances of potentially suspicious securities transactions and failed to report those
activities as required by the bank secrecy act, they paid FINRA a fine of $65,000.


In May 2011, to resolve allegations that their sales and supervision of Reg D/private
placement offerings was deficient, National Securities was censured and required to pay
restitution of $175,000 to affected customers.


In one case, National Securities Corporation has even been named a defendant in a RICO
suit.


And these are just the recent cases, it actually gets worse and goes back for over three
decades. In fact, National Securities Corporation is so bad that it's had fifty-seven
different FINRA regulatory events against the company going back to the early 1980s -
these are not one-off incidents. Meson has already uncovered shady ties between
Odyssey and unnecessary offshore Panamanian and Bahamian subsidiaries - which
Odyssey has still never explained. The question is, why would you trust these people with
your money when they're intentionally tying up with these multiple, very questionable
business partners?


International Assets Advisory


International Assets Advisory, the other broker touting Neptune stock, isn't much better.
Although IAA "only" has six regulatory events on record with FINRA, the firm and its
brokers have been tied to some legendary blow-ups.


In one case, Jeffrey Rubin, a broker at International Assets Advisory at the time, was
behind an investment scheme that lost a staggering $40,000,000 for 31 NFL players.  It's
unclear what role, if any, IAA played in this melt-down, and the investigation is ongoing.
Mr. Rubin has since been barred from the industry by FINRA.


In our opinion, it's clear both of these firms represent the bottom of the barrel among
capital raising opportunities, so it's unclear why Neptune would even consider working
with these groups unless they were desperate - but what we do know is the following:


1. Neptune paid these firms ~$388,000 in commissions in conjunction with their last equity
offering.


2. Neptune has continued to flounder, and is now back in the market for equity, capital that
we believe will be squandered needlessly like all the previous capital Neptune has raised.

3. As we highlighted in our last report, Odyssey is no longer claiming Neptune is an off-
balance sheet source of wealth creation (they removed the slide in their most recent
presentation, validating our concerns).


We continue to believe the Odyssey is in the business of selling the dream of a lottery
ticket stock - a ticket that has been proven worthless over 16 years, costing shareholders
over $180m in cumulative losses, while insiders have earned over $20mm cash.


Conclusion: Mako investors need to ask questions


Mako and Neptune investors need to start asking tough questions of the people that owe
them a legal fiduciary duty.


1) Why was Mako's $27.5mm in capital not injected directly into Oceanica, where it could
be used to build the business?


2) How much of Mako's $27.5mm has gone to paying OMEX's corporate salaries and
perks?


3) How much of the $27.5mm is still in OMEX's US bank accounts and could be sent
back, avoiding likely total loss?


4) How did OMEX determine that $10mm was a fair price to charge their controlled
subsidiary, Oceanica, for services?


5) How is Oceanica supposed to do anything with only <$400k in the bank, when it takes
millions to develop any mine? (Nautilus Minerals Inc. has spent >$300mm, and still has
negative cash flow.)


6) How is J.P. Morgan actually involved? Is it merely a local Florida Chase Private Client
branch trying to sell unregistered Oceanica securities to HNW investors?
