“Business … that’s easily defined: It’s other people’s money" – Peter Drucker


It is difficult to write any financial story this week without referring to the complete
debacle at Bear Stearns. While there are many lessons here, the pre-eminent one is the
corruption of judgment induced by OPM (Other People’s Money). With the huge fees
and cash bonuses generated by indiscriminate Wall Street dealmaking, the most
fundamental principle has gone out the window: “When you make a loan, lend it out as if
you were risking your own money, and when you recommend a stock to the public, act
as if your mother was asking for investment advice.”


Thinking about the sad state of OPM leads us to our newest entry to the Citron blog…
Emcore Corp. (NASDAQ:EMKR) which sports a market cap of nearly $700 million, after
one of the worst operating histories Citron can recall. Emcore has racked up operational
losses for 14 of the last 15 years – $340 million in losses offset by just $1 million in
gains — in 1995. With its low margin sales, gigantic SG&A expenses and a history of
overpromising and under-delivering, you have to wonder if the company has forgotten
all about the principle of making a profit – last year the loss ballooned to $58 million –
and the share count bloated to more than 70 million, right in step. OPM baby.

Shining the Light on Emcore’s Solar Business


1) Green and Gold Energy


As of last filing the company had approximately $30 mil in cash while they were burning
$15 million a quarter. Emcore has 3 units: Fiber optics, space solar, and solar energy.
The first two businesses are flat and sell technology commodities that have proven
consistently unprofitable, and wouldn’t be worth more than $2 a share. This leaves the
company with their golden child: a Solar Energy business that Wall St. deems worthy of
a fat market cap.


But Emcore’s solar business is built on a foundation of illusions. Citron will now show
that Emcore has deceived the public about the quality of their customers and their
customer’s ability to fulfill these alleged orders.


Emcore has been in the solar technology business for more than a decade. Its gallium
arsenide cells have always produced electricity more efficiently than polysilicon, and it
works with high concentrations of light. The drawbacks, however, doom it to a narrow
niche – irrelevant in the current push for high-volume, mass-scale, low cost power
production. The high cost of putting weight into orbit makes Gallium Arsenide
technology cost effective in space, but it’s prohibitively expensive on earth – up to 100
times the cost of a polysilicon solar cell. 


It’s also really toxic, and doesn’t work at all under hazy conditions.


In contrast to the major polysilicon solar companies, who have earned market value by
racking up huge multi-year supply agreements with credible counterparties, Emcore has
strung together a group of sham deals to make it appear to be a player in the terrestrial
solar business. Citron is incredulous that Wall Street’s analysts have swallowed this
story without doing any fact-checking whatsoever. Instead the analysts have been
fawning on the prospects of Emcore’s supposed backlog and deal flow.


But what do you expect – it’s the same group of analysts whose consensus earnings
estimates underestimated EMKR’s losses in the last two quarters by 1000% — a miss of
over $28 million in six months — and yet wouldn’t dream of a downgrade.

As you can see in Jefferies’ analyst John Lau’s notes last week, Emcore is banking
heavily on Green and Gold Energy as a critical part of Emcore’s backlog: 
Emcore Shares Surge on Upbeat Note 
Emcore Jumps on Upbeat Analyst Comments


This order was restated in Emcore’s 10-K in which it states it ended FY 2007 with $142
million solar backlog of which “terrestrial” represents $89 million.


Then in February, the company announced an additional $39m order from Green and
Gold, and restated its $86m terrestrial solar backlogged orders.


So that’s $65 million ($78m according to Green and Gold’s PR), or appx 75% (or 86%)
of Emcore’s backlog for terrestrial solar products. The question is whether there is any
prospect whatsoever of Green and Gold being able to pay for this order.


Citron has done considerable research on Green and Gold and believes the company
does not have the money or capacity to fulfill the purchase commitments reflected in
these press releases.


Consider the following:


The CEO and founder of Green and Gold Energy is Gregory Watson. Before Green and
Gold, Mr. Watson promoted perpetual motion machines.


But that turned out to be a bust


Mr. Watson then moved on to the “SunBall”. He then abandoned those claims in favor of
the SunCube – promised for future sale to the public in 2007. But he retreated from
those claims, and now claims giant solar farms will be built with SunCube’s, built with
Emcore’s solar cells. …only one problem. His company states that it doesn’t have a yet
have plant to produce its SunCube, and doesn’t have the financing for the plant, but it
does have an “intention” to build it!


Beyond the lack of production capacity, the SunCube itself comes with a fair share of
controversy. Observers at the much promoted unveiling of the SunCube prototype at an
Adelaide park last month commented that:


The SunCube didn’t have any heavy electrical wires running from the unit1.

SunPeak Energy


Spanish Contracts


There was no electrical load attached, nor any meter to measure how much
electricity the unit was producing, if any.


2.


The unit wobbled noticeably in a light breeze – enough to take it out of solar
alignment.


3.


Its “exclusive distributor”, Zolar Distributors (see banner in above photo) has a website
but no address or phone number.


Emcore has admitted that it has received only $500,000 from Green and Gold. Citron
believes that whatever it has received is the only money it will ever see from this fantasy,
and it is the height of corporate malfeasance to use any of the $65m or $78m claimed
for future sales to Green and Gold as part of its revenue guidance. They’ve had over six
months to do their own due diligence, but they persist in insisting this customer is the
anchor of their backlog. Analysts should wake up.


For some fun reading, here is some of the solar tech community’s commentary on
Emcore’s future largest customer.


Emcore released PR for a “memorandum of understanding” regarding a multi-year
agreement to supply 200 to 700 MW of solar power components to SunPeak Energy for
unspecified future projects.


Sounds promising, but SunPeak has no verifiable track record in the solar energy
generation business. Here are a few cute tidbits about Emcore’s second largest solar
customer.


They were just incorporated — April 2007.1.


Their COO was fired from his last job for a $47 million natural gas hedging “mistake”2.


According to Dun and Bradstreet, the company has 4 employees and no verifiable
credit history.


3.


Citron believes that this press release was just that – a press release.

Pod Corp. in Sault St. Marie, Canada


World Water & Solar Technologies


WWAT recently completed a purchase of proprietary solar systems developer Entech. This is a
direct competitor to Emcore’s concentrating solar cells. There is no explanation of why, if Emcore’s
technology is so promising, WWAT would buy a competitor for cash and stock


Conclusion


In November, Emcore announced $18m component contract with ISFOC, the “Institute
of Concentration Photovoltaics Systems”.


This very small (850Kw) is a “turnkey” project meaning most of Emcore’s revenue will
not come from solar cells, but rather systems integration work. This low margin systems
integration work is not what Wall St. was promised.


It’s a Memorandum of Understanding only, not a firm contract and it contains this
strange language:


“EMCORE also has the right to substitute other solar technologies in portions of the
projects.”


Why would Emcore not use its own products in the installation? How about because in
that location, cloudy more than 50% of the time, gallium arsenide isn’t effective. That
would be as if Coke had a contract with McDonalds and said at times we will supply
Pepsi.


This customer is our favorite. With less than $25 million in shareholder equity and $36
million dollars of losses over the last 4 years, Emcore certainly seems to be relying
heavily on the future success of a flimsy OTC company. Emcore went as far as to invest
$18 million in World Water…and guess what happened – World Water committed to a
competing solar technology.


Citron notes that WWAT’s CFO Larry Crawford was formerly EVP and CFO at Escala,
wrecked when it was exposed to be part of a notorious Ponzi scheme fraud broken up
by Spanish authorities … first exposed by Citron.

After reading this report we expect the analysts will predictably defend the stock as they
always do – hey, no doubt Emcore will need more money soon, and the banking
business is too good to pass up. The company might kick and scream and add short
sellers to their agenda in presentations. Citron will suggest a novel approach to
management: Instead of complaining about critics, make a profit for a change! Sell your
product to real customers, record more revenue than expenses and let your numbers do
your talking. As for the analysts, show some accountability here. If and when Emcore
misses your next quarterly estimates – hold the company and yourselves accountable.
But then again, you can just hold to your normal course of business…after all it is only
Other People’s Money.


Cautious investing to all.
