Globalstar: A Review Of The Experimental Licenses For TLPS
Oct. 28, 2014 9:00 AM ET43 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


A review of the history of Globalstar's experimental license activity indicates that
GSAT itself doesn't know how TLPS could ever be monetizeable.


Cisco is not a logical partner, and has publicly belittled TLPS. In the most recent
experimental license, GSAT has merely committed to using Cisco access points.


There is no unifying theme behind all of the TLPS experimental testing
environments, which vary from rural roads to single-family homes to university
campuses to Madison Square Gardens.


Recently, Globalstar Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSAT) applied to the FCC for a new experimental
license to test its Terrestrial Low Power Service (TLPS) concept in California. Though the
initial irrational enthusiasm over this relatively unimportant piece of news has already
started to die down, the history of Globalstar's experimental license activity illustrates the
many shortcomings of TLPS and provides further evidence that TLPS will never be
commercially viable.


Background


On October 20th, Globalstar applied to the FCC for an experimental license to use the
Channel 14/TLPS frequencies in San Carlos, California, using two Cisco access-point
(AP) models, the Aironet 1570 and 3700. The 1570 is specially designed for outdoor
usage; the 3700 is high-end and indoor-oriented; and both are capable of 802.11ac, the
latest Wi-Fi standard, which is defined only for 5GHz, and which TLPS will therefore never
be able to offer. An exhibit attached to the application described the "Research and
Experiment Objectives Specific to this License Application" as follows:


"Determine the efficacy of TLPS for outdoor small cell use in diverse semi-urban
environments."
"Determine the efficacy of TLPS for latency intolerant/high priority applications."


If granted, this TLPS-related experimental license would not be the first, as the table
below shows:

Globalstar's partner, Jarvinian has had at least one experimental license covering Channel
14 for more than 18 months. Yet, not only is Globalstar still seeking to make sense of "the
efficacy of TLPS" for different use cases, but Globalstar has never seen fit to release
detailed results from any of these prior tests, with the arguable exception of the thin and
misleading publicly disclosed "results" (obtained under the initial Cambridge license) that
we criticized in a prior report, and two (1, 2) ex parte letters to the FCC.


Since Globalstar has no new technology to keep secret - just a single channel of its own -
we find no good reason for withholding test results. But Globalstar may not want to
acknowledge certain basic facts about TLPS. For example, in a scenario in which TLPS's
primary user devices are smartphones, its maximum throughput - shared across all
devices that are in range of each other - will be at best ~35 Mbps, equivalent to roughly
seven concurrent high-definition Netflix streams.  This is the same as any other 20MHz
802.11n channel. The higher effective range of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, touted by Globalstar and
Jarvinian as a great advantage, is in fact a disadvantage when the goal is to offer high
capacity and support many users. But if TLPS can't support large numbers of users or
high-value applications, let alone outdo existing public Wi-Fi and cellular coverage, how
can it possibly warrant a multi-billion dollar valuation? As we'll discuss later in this
discussion, Globalstar's aimless testing efforts provides further evidence that the company
itself has no clear vision of how TLPS would generate meaningful value.


Cisco Is Not a Logical Partner, and Has Publicly Belittled TLPS


Some of the excitement over the experimental license application stemmed from the
notion that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was somehow involved. However, all that the
application itself says is that Globalstar will use Cisco APs. (By that standard, Kerrisdale

has partnered with Cisco to test TLPS: we used the Cisco Aironet 1262 in one of our lab
tests.) The attached exhibit includes the phrase "Cisco Test Area" in small letters on
Figure 5, but is otherwise silent on the topic.


Cisco does operate a small public Wi-Fi network in San Carlos, a pleasant but modest
suburb with a population of 28,000 that serves as a test case for Cisco's
"Smart+Connected Communities" concept. Though Globalstar grandiosely declares that "
[t]he city of San Carlos is used by industry as a test bed for advanced 802.11 network and
application testing," that characterization came as a surprise to our Wi-Fi and technology
contacts, including one who works directly on what he characterized as the only unusual
Wi-Fi application in the city: a "smart parking" system. This system operates across a few
hundred parking spaces. Buried sensors detect when a car is present, and communicate
this information (not via Wi-Fi) to "gateway" units that relay it to a central management
system; in some cases, drivers can view this data in real time to determine where to find
an open space. In other cities, these gateways use cellular connections from the likes of
AT&T and Verizon; in San Carlos, because the municipal Wi-Fi network already existed,
they use Wi-Fi. (Note that Wi-Fi is not a necessary component of a smart parking system,
since other cities utilize LTE).


Smart parking is interesting and potentially valuable, but it has nothing to do with TLPS.
Indeed, the existing San Carlos operation already demonstrates that notwithstanding
Globalstar's fear-mongering about "Wi-Fi congestion" and the unsuitability of unlicensed
spectrum for any latency-sensitive application, Wi-Fi works just fine.


We don't know the true extent of Cisco's involvement in Globalstar's proposed tests.
Perhaps Globalstar has won Cisco's cooperation, for instance by committing to buy its
APs. In any event, though, Cisco will never be a logical "terrestrial partner" for a TLPS
buildout. Cisco is not Boingo. It is in the business of selling Wi-Fi hardware and
management software (among other things), not setting up networks and attempting to
monetize them. Moreover, Globalstar advocates seem to forget that Cisco does not truly
support TLPS. Indeed, its May comments in the TLPS rulemaking proceeding are among
the most biting (and substantive) on the record. We include a few quotations below to jog
bulls' memories:


"[W]hatever the Commission does in this proceeding, it should not retreat from its
commitment to expanding use of the 5 GHz band for IEEE 802.11 devices. The
benefits promised by Globalstar's latest business plan pale in comparison to the public
benefits that will be achieved as the Commission opens [additional 5GHz spectrum]...
for Wi-Fi use and allows the potential of IEEE 802.11ac to be fully realized."

"While Globalstar has claimed TLPS will offer higher data rates than traditional Wi-Fi at
2.4 GHz, the Commission should note that Globalstar is not proposing here any
technological advancement. To the contrary, Globalstar's plan is built around use of the
legacy IEEE 802.11b/g/n amendments. To the extent that Globalstar's TLPS may offer
higher speeds, it will simply be because fewer users will be willing to pay Globalstar for
the privilege of using its spectrum and thus fewer users will be sharing Channel 14
compared to other 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels."
"Behind Globalstar's new moniker, TLPS will be nothing more than a paid Wi-Fi
offering using the legacy IEEE 802.11b/g/n amendments."


Has Cisco really gone from downplaying TLPS's significance and value in May to signing
on as a full-fledged partner in October, when nothing has changed? We doubt it.


Globalstar Itself Doesn't Know What TLPS Is For


When we discuss TLPS with Globalstar equityholders, they often tell us that we've missed
the real use case for TLPS. It's for residential areas in the suburbs; no, it's for lower
Manhattan; no, it's for reaching greater distances in large spaces. It's for cable companies;
no, it's for phone companies; no, it's for Google; no, it's for Amazon. We've also been told
it's obviously not for managed environments like universities or stadiums, supposedly
rendering our analysis of those environments irrelevant; it's also obviously not for indoor
networks. But we can't blame the market for failing to have a consistent vision of what
TLPS would really be, given that Globalstar itself seems deeply uncertain.


Just consider what Globalstar and Jarvinian say they're investigating. In New Orleans -
specifically, at the University of New Orleans - their stated goal was to "[d]etermine the
efficacy of TLPS relative to public 802.11 channels in a university environment." We have
never heard any investor tout the higher education market as a great opportunity for
TLPS, but that was what Globalstar and Jarvinian focused on last summer. Of course, this
makes no sense. As we have previously documented, universities are quite advanced in
their usage of 5GHz: at one large school, 60% of the data that moved over the campus
Wi-Fi network in the last two months used the 5GHz band, flying in the face of the bizarre
claim from Globalstar's October 9th conference call that 5GHz is "simply not an effective
option" for "a service that has to be designed to be reliable." Indeed, 5GHz is the only way
universities can hope to build the high-capacity networks their users demand. TLPS has
nothing to offer them. (Matt Williams, the former assistant director of networking at
Bucknell University, provided a good overview at the recent Interop New York conference
of the historical transition from coverage-oriented, 2.4GHz-focused Wi-Fi designs

developed years ago to the capacity-oriented, 5GHz-focused networks of today. His
practical advice was that network administrators should "design for 5GHz at -65 [dBm] on
the device with the crappiest antenna you can find.")


Next, Globalstar and Jarvinian sought to test TLPS in a range of different environments in
the New York area and now in San Carlos. Even though Globalstar has always pitched
TLPS as a solution to the "congestion" allegedly afflicting high-density areas, it has
primarily examined low-density areas where, by its own admission, the TLPS value
proposition is hard to fathom:


"A rural transit environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 5-7): TLPS would presumably be
used to offer internet access to drivers on Route 48 in a rural part of Long Island -
likely using 802.11b, a 15-year-old protocol. This simply cannot be taken seriously as a
business plan or even the kernel of one. (Note that companies like GM that have
started to offer in-car Wi-Fi are actually using LTE cellular service for backhaul and
merely distributing the data within the car via Wi-Fi.)
"A low-density enterprise environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 7-9): TLPS in a small
office park in Long Island. We find this use case particularly interesting because, in
response to our prior criticisms of its purported test results from Cambridge, Globalstar
insisted that what it presented - an image of a single AP serving a large office space -
"was used to demonstrate the field test environment and not an intended deployment
scheme." In February, however, Globalstar and Jarvinian grandly stated that "[t]he
enterprise environment represents one of the most critical and challenging applications
of 802.11 technology" and noted that "[t]his testing will build upon that [conducted in]...
Cambridge, Massachusetts (experimental license: WG2XNK)." Nowhere did they
mention that evidently this testing merely aimed to "demonstrate the field test
environment," whatever that means, as opposed to showing anything more realistic or
useful.
"A moderate-density suburban single-family home environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p.
7-9): a house in Long Island. Here Jarvinian asserted that 2.4GHz interference
"threatens a broad diversity of applications, particularly those that are bit intensive and
latency intolerant (e.g. live video, gaming, etc.)." Yet, on Globalstar's October 9th
conference call, Jarvinian's John Dooley, in an attempted show of fair-mindedness,
said, "I highly recommend people use 5 gigahertz to connect to all of their audio/video
equipment." In that case, how could TLPS possibly help for "live video, gaming, etc." in
a suburban residence?
"A moderate-density suburban single-family home environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p.
9-10): Smithtown, NY. Here is the face of the multi-billion dollar TLPS network that

("[D]espite the relatively low level of foot traffic," Jarvinian insists, "local 2.4 GHz ISM Band
interference is severe." Really?)


A "moderate-density outdoor suburban environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 10-14):
Trying to serve an entire school, in this case the J.M. Rapport School for Career
Development in South Bronx, with a single strand-mount AP across the street is
beyond ludicrous. While the "one AP per classroom" rule of thumb for K-12 Wi-Fi
design is widely lampooned by the most skilled practitioners, it at least speaks to the
scale of the problem: one AP, and thus one channel, certainly isn't going to cut it. And
with many APs and high user counts, the small number of channels in 2.4GHz simply
can't deliver a good experience, TLPS or no TLPS; 5GHz is the centerpiece of all
modern Wi-Fi in schools.
"A high-density urban environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 16-17): Madison Square
Garden. Recall that several people dismissed our past use of examples of successful
large-scale Wi-Fi networks drawn from football stadiums and similar locations, arguing

that such environments were clearly not the intended home of TLPS. Yet, here we find
Globalstar and Jarvinian trying to get one 2.4GHz channel to serve a massive, packed
arena. We wish them luck. Fortunately for data-hungry stadium-goers, real Wi-Fi can
use two dozen free, unlicensed channels, which, coupled with smart designs, makes
possible the following photo from Game 5 of the World Series ("#WiFiLikeaBoss"):

"Diverse semi-urban environments": The San Carlos outdoor test already discussed.
San Carlos features a small, suburban network that already serves its intended
purpose. How would TLPS help?
"Latency intolerant/high priority applications": This final stated use case is vague, but
still misguided. Globalstar bemoans that, "[f]or all the convenience of public 802.11
connectivity, the efficacy of real-time functions like IP telephony... are impossible to
guarantee on unlicensed spectrum." But this is simply false on any reasonable
interpretation. Voice over Wi-Fi is so common in enterprises that we used Cisco's
Design Principles for Voice over WLAN to guide the predictive survey work we
commissioned in our previous report. T-Mobile is supporting voice over Wi-Fi today
and giving its customer free 5GHz-capable 802.11ac routers to encourage it. At the
recent Certified Wireless Network Professional conference, Jon Linton gave a detailed

and nuanced presentation about voice over Wi-Fi, including the advantages and
disadvantage of the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. What he didn't do was throw his hands in
the air and declare that the efficacy of real-time telephony was impossible to guarantee
on unlicensed spectrum. Globalstar has declared the impossibility of something that
Wi-Fi professionals successfully manage all the time.


What is the unifying theme behind all of these proposed and tested TLPS use cases, from
rural roads to Madison Square Garden? There isn't one. Globalstar is searching in vain for
a problem TLPS can solve - a problem that matters, with real money to be made - and
finding nothing. The tests are indoor and outdoor, in managed multi-AP environments and
in one-off locations, in offices and in homes, in the city and in the country. There is no
determinate TLPS vision, just an amorphous set of buzzwords. Investors have ascribed
billions of dollars of value to TLPS in the hope that there's some secret plan behind it all,
but there isn't.


Globalstar's Testing Continues to Mislead


Globalstar has thoroughly doubled down on its overblown claims about Wi-Fi congestion,
even the claim that the 2.4GHz band is already "exhausted" today and "has come to an
end effectively as a public resource" (yet, somehow, 2.4GHz simultaneously remains "the
primary band for Wi-Fi"). But one of the images it submitted to the FCC in its most recent
experimental license application, stripped of its spin, undermines those claims. Globalstar
and Jarvinian like to toss around colorful spectrograms, giving the appearance of rich
technical content - yet, they usually lack important information like z-axis labels, making it
impossible to interpret them quantitatively. (For example, what power level does "red"
correspond to? Rarely is there a legend, let alone a readable one.) The point of these
images isn't to inform: it's to be superficially impressive.


Below, we show a spectrogram included in the latest license application; the same image
appeared in Jarvinian's previous application (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 14, Figure 13). It depicts
the observed power levels across the range of frequencies from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz in a
specified location in Smithtown, NY. We have modified the image to include the red
vertical lines, which indicate the center frequencies of Wi-Fi Channels 1, 6, 11, and 14.

Source: Kerrisdale modification of image from Globalstar's 10/20/14 experimental license
application, technical exhibit


Globalstar's gloss on this image is that it depicts "severe 2.4 GHz ISM interference." But
how severe is it, really? One clue comes from the largely blue rectangle at the top, which
charts emissions over time (going down), with redder hues indicating more power in a
given small frequency band. But the overall pattern is clearly more blue than red, and the
"red" value - if we squint - appears to be set at ~-74 dBm, which is not especially high (a
strong indoor Wi-Fi signal a few feet from an AP might be -35 dBm). Moreover, within the
lower portion of the chart, while Globalstar wants to focus on the upper "max" line, the
middle "average" line tells a more important story - and one that makes much more sense
in the low-traffic Smithtown, NY location in question. While the TLPS band is largely
unused, its average power level is not dramatically lower than that of Channels 1, 6, or 11.
At their peaks, those frequencies do spike to much higher than average power levels, but
there simply aren't enough bursts of activity to drive the average level very high - hence,
all the blue in the "waterfall" view at the top. This is not an image of severe interference.
It's an image of modest, transient Wi-Fi activity in just one of the unlicensed bands where
it exists. But it's difficult to see that, because it's not the story Globalstar and its partners
are interested in telling.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2603155-globalstar-a-review-of-the-experimental-licenses-for-tlps 10/26


On a different but related note, we again find that Globalstar is not being forthright about
the kind of "testing" it has conducted and is seeking to conduct. When reasonable,
passably tech-savvy people hear about Wi-Fi testing, they assume it means connecting
user devices to a network and assessing things like throughput. Tests like that are what
Wi-Fi testing firms do for a living. But it's interesting to note that Jarvinian and Globalstar
have never sought permission in their experimental license applications to use any phone,
tablet, or laptop on TLPS. They have only requested the permission to use APs. As a
result, there appears to be no legal way (outside of an anechoic chamber) they could have
done the genuine real-world tests that investors have come to believe they have. Indeed,
even if one weren't interested in device-to-AP throughput, Wi-Fi generally requires clients
to send acknowledgement (ACK) frames back to their APs in order to confirm the receipt
of data, so clients will necessarily transmit as well as receive. Whatever Globalstar and
Jarvinian have been doing, it's hard to see how even something as simple as running the
SpeedTest.net app would be permitted under the authority they've obtained. At a
minimum, they have never openly discussed these problems.


Cisco, however, did raise this point in its May comments (emphasis added):


Globalstar contends that "[m]ost 802.11-enabled consumer devices have the
hardware needed to operate at 2473-2495 MHz, but they lack the physical capability
to operate above 2483.5 MHz in the United States because of restrictions in their
radiofrequency ("RF") software." Globalstar Petition at 17. It is not clear to Cisco
that this is necessarily the case, and Cisco looks forward to reviewing the
responses from manufacturers of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi consumer devices that will inform
the record on whether Channel 14 actually can be activated in client devices by a
simple software upgrade.


One wonders if Globalstar and Jarvinian are shying away from testing user devices simply
because they can't.


Conclusion


In isolation, Globalstar's latest experimental license application doesn't mean much; for
TLPS, it's not the first and likely won't be the last. This does nothing to change our
fundamental thesis that TLPS is a non-solution to a non-problem. But the materials
supporting the application and its predecessors serve as a useful reminder that there is no
well-defined business case for TLPS, just an array of vague hopes and dreams supported
by inadequate data. The Globalstar bubble still has billions of dollars left before it fully
deflates.
