The Monster Created By Wall Street 
Citron Target on Monster Beverage: $80 near term 


The past 6 months on Wall Street could be described as "interesting times". 
Hedge funds have underperformed the market -- some "smart guys" have 
delivered near-catastrophic returns. Investors of all stripes are now 
clamoring to rebalance their portfolios.  Everyone in the money 
management game is now facing up to the stark reality that has been 
altogether forgotten over the last seven years of "straight-up" euphoria:  
 


Valuations Matter!!! 
 


Yes, men with ponytails and screaming bald men on soapboxes have for 
years browbeat retail investors to buy stocks based on the principle that 
“they are high, so they have to be going higher”, ignoring underlying 
valuations.  When that party ends, it ends fast, and as you've noticed, they 
don't ring a bell. 
 


Mr. Market has done a fine job in rebalancing a lot of the froth in the 
market.   But Citron has identified one stock whose valuation -- yes, 
valuation -- is completely removed from reality considering the business 
risks and limited growth opportunities. 
 


We reintroduce the investing world to an old name that is worth 
a second look – Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). 
 
Shorts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong, but they are always 
early.   
 
The bear case thesis on Monster has been around for years.  It used to 
focus on the headwinds of the energy drink business and the health risks of

the product. All the while the price of MNST has continued to defy gravity-- 
as if the stock drank four cans of its own product.   
 
Citron believes now is the time for both long and shorts to consider the real 
facts surrounding the business, and consider the price of the stock within 
the perspective of current market conditions. 
 


Amped-Up Valuation: Over the past 5 years MNST's market valuation is 
up 500%, while its revenues are up 90%.  
 


Let us start with the facts. 
 


Monster Beverage is not a technology company, nor is it virally scalable, 
and by no means can you ever call it disruptive (to your health maybe).  
Monster is not even the #1 player in the energy drink market.  The Monster 
product is not even discernable to its customers as it is more about the 
marketing than the product…yet Wall Street has ignored reality. 
 


Look at the basic comparisons below.  Wall Street is valuing Monster like a 
tech company, when in reality, it is a single product company selling sugar 
and caffeine water amongst many competitors, whose business is only as 
strong as its marketing muscle.

  Monster 9.4x

To illustrate how utterly ridiculous this is versus other beverage 
companies, consider these comps.

Dr Pepper Snapple Group 3.1 x 


Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 3.0 x 


PepsiCo 2.5 x 


  Average 3.3 x 


  
Monster 9.4x 


 
Dr. Pepper Snapple Group's valuation (NYSE:DPS) is 30% smaller than 
Monster's, despite boasting 100% more revenues and roughly 60% 
greater EBITDA than Monster.   
 


Valuing Monster comparable to DPS’s multiple would result in 48% 
downside to Monster owners.   
 


Citron explains Monster's valuation disconnect with reality, demonstrating 
why Monster will trade down to $80.  
 


 I’m in Love with Coca (cola) 


Coca Cola's buy-in may have temporarily validated Monster, but at a 
second look it is not as sweet as investors had imagined.   After years of 
controversy, Coca Cola provided some much needed short-term validation 
in 2014 with its investment in MNST and as usual Wall St overreacted. 
  


Since the transaction MNST stock price is up almost 100% while revenues 
are up only 10% (even less if you remove the Coca Cola energy drink brand 
revenues transferred to Monster).   
 


Now let's get back to reality.  Coca Cola's investment is NOT the first step 
towards an eventual purchase.  On the contrary, it is the opinion of Citron 
that this transaction eliminated the possibility of a future takeout and the 
premium that had always glimmered in the company's future.  Coke used
Citron Confronts the Monster Wall Street Created                  January 29, 2016 Page 4 of 21 
 


this transaction to quietly EXIT the energy drink business, distancing itself 
from the reputational risks of energy drinks to their own portfolio. (One 
hypothesis is that Coke’s portfolio of energy drinks was never successful 
because its marketing is limited by its engagement in ‘ethical’ advertising).   
 


This is how the transaction was structured.  Coca Cola now has the benefits 
of participating in the energy drink business without the risk … something 
even Buffet and Ackman can agree on is a good thing. 


http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/11/the-latest-billionaire-battle-ackman-v-buffett.html 





In fact, if you take out the Coke products, Monster’s minimal organic 
growth is not supportive of a company with this multiple. 
 
Here’s the analysis in a single chart:

 Why an $80 Short Term Target??? 


In trying to find an honest comparable for Monster, Citron thinks Green 
Mountain Coffee is the ideal candidate.  Both companies are high growth 
beverage companies who attracted sizable investments from Coca Cola.  
  


We would argue that GMCR is the higher quality business because it is the 
dominant leader in its category and its product produces recurring revenue 
through the sale of K-Cups.  Given that powerful advantage to GMCR, 
below we present the comparison of MNST and GMCR on a pre and post 
takeout basis.

If we chose to value MNST vs Dr. Pepper Snapple, a more direct competitor, 
it would result in a 48% downside to Monster owners.  For the sake of the 
benefit of the doubt we used the post GMCR takeout value as a benchmark 
to get to $80 a share for Monster. 
 


 C’mon Citron, What about China?  Surely China will 
Unleash Monstrous Growth!...? 


Monster has justified its double-digit growth story by teasing its next phase: 
China.  Investor Meeting (Jan 12, 2016):  
 


“Reverting to probably what is our largest individual country 
opportunity in the to is obviously the Chinese market.”   





Wow! It's 2016 and Monster in finally entering China.  Note: Monster 
Energy is not Facebook!  For Monster, entering China commits them to an 
expensive brand-building exercise from the ground up, while selling their 
product at a price with significantly lower margins than afforded in the US.  
And their primary obstacle is established branded competitor Red Bull, who 
has been in China FOR TWENTY YEARS.  Not to mention we are skeptical 
about how popular the Monster Girls will be with the Chinese Government. 
(Had to throw in the Monster Girls somewhere) 
 


In Monster’s own words (Investor Meeting - Jan 12, 2016):  
 


“They [Red Bull] have very, very much the lion's share of the market… 
But their pricing is at basically about $1 a can.” 





Note to Monster management and analysts:  The days of justifying a stupid 
stock price based on “entering” China is soooooo 2009.  
 


Just look to the past to tell the future.  Coca-Cola provides a meaningful 
example here. 
 


Coke bought Glaceau/ Vitamin Water in 2008 as a U.S.-only business.  The 
rationale was their ability to leverage the asset with massive overseas 
market penetration, riding Coke's powerful distribution assets.  Not to 
mention Glaceau had a wide array of energy drinks.  But, despite Coke's 
distribution power, it has failed to grow its international market share for 
Vitaminwater meaningfully.  International sales comprise only 12% of sales 
… after six years.

Glaceau/VitaminWater Millions of Liters Sold: 
 


 
 
So how can Monster’s road in China be anything other than:  high brand-
building expense, low margins, and slow growth?  Where is the Great Leap 
Forward in this plan?  
 


 Margin Margin Margin!!! 


If there is one counter-argument to this whole piece that the bulls will 
counter with, it is the increased margin Monster’s turned in last quarter. 
 


However, margins would not look so hot without Coca Cola’s concentrate 
business:  Here is a quick analysis for you bulls who will hold on to any 
outlandish justification for this crazy valuation.
Citron Confronts the Monster Wall Street Created                  January 29, 2016 Page 9 of 21 
 





Note: the above margins are not adjusted for lower margin Monster non-
energy drink assets, which were divested to Coke and are no longer a part 
of Monster's business (they are not disclosed).  (Refer to the important 
graph on page 5 to quantify the effect of the brand exchange with Coke, as 
derived from Coke’s disclosures. ) 
 


Based off of these assets transfers, plus a price increase on Monster Energy 
drinks in the U.S., Monster hit high EBIT margins of 38% in Q3-2015 for the 
first time, despite hovering around 29-31% for the last few years.  The only 
way for analysts to justify their stock target is to have this company 
expanding margins while going into China- Not Happening. 
 
As we see the truth from Coca Cola.

“Gross profit will be negatively impacted, despite the structural benefit at 


net revenue, primarily due to the loss of concentrate profit on KO's legacy 


energy brand.” 


This statement from Coca Cola makes clear that it offloaded its more 
profitable energy drink assets for non-energy drink assets, and that 
Monster will receive a one-time benefit from Coca Cola’s energy drink 
assets, which are wasting assets. 
 


 Future Products 
 


Analysts want investors to get excited about new products being launched 
by Monster. But let’s be honest here. Rob Gronkowoski is a great football 
player, but an energy drink call “Gronk” isn’t exactly going to move the 
needle for a $30 billion company, and probably won’t sell well to Giants or 
Jets fans.  All new products introduced by Monster simply cannibalize the 
existing product line -- this is not exactly Mondelez. 
 


At the end of the day, Monster is not a product company with a broad suite 
of unique products.  It is a marketing company that is trying to differentiate 
its brand from other similar products.  As admitted by GS in a conference. 
 


Coke says: “On the Monster program, we're extremely excited about 
that. I think Monster is a premier marketer.”  
 


-- Goldman Sachs Global Staples Summit May 5, 2015 


So a solid marketing company is worth a valuation that "monsters" its 


competitors?  NO! 


Mandatory Reading For Shareholders 
Fund manager John Davies wrote an insightful article on Seeking Alpha that 
describes the declining growth of Monster Beverage, drawing eery 
comparisons to the wine cooler craze of the 1980’s.  This is required 
reading for investors.  In the article Davies notes : 
 From 2000 to 2010, the global energy drink market grew at 20% p.a. 
 From 2010 to 2015, the global energy drink market grew at 11% p.a.
Citron Confronts the Monster Wall Street Created                  January 29, 2016 Page 11 of 21 
 


 From 2015 to 2019, the global energy drink market is estimated to grow 
at 7-10% p.a. (wide range of projections and we would take the "under" 
on any Hi/Lo proposition).

Analysts: Read Before You Respond 


For the past 7 years, Wall Street research analysts have practiced the dark 
art of justifying a sky stock price by backfilling their model to try and 
support a current nosebleed price level.  The beverage analysts are no 
different.   
 


Not to pick on Goldman Sachs, but when you are the biggest, it is only 
inevitable.  Last year Green Mountain Coffee hit the same exact stock price 
that MNST is currently trading (around $140).  Goldman came out and 
stamped a $185 target on GMCR.  Over the next 9 months the stock 
plunged to $40 a share -- 79% below Goldman's target, before a bail out by 
JAB at $90 (still over 50% below Goldman’s peak target).  Oh, by the way, 
the GMCR Goldman analyst is the same one covering MNST! The analysts 
could not have been more wrong.  But we know ... this time it will be 
different.

The Headline Risk for Monster Beverage, 2016 
Edition – Could MNST have a “Chipotle Moment”?  
 


The stock price of Monster Beverage has climbed as if its business has rid 
itself of all of the risks in that have shadowed the energy drink market for 
years -- but in reality it has only gotten worse.  Citron is not going to 
dedicate too much time going over the danger of energy drinks -- the risk is 
self-evident and something that the bulls and bears can probably agree on. 
 


The risks are particularly high with respect to consumption by adolescents 
and young adults. 
 


Instead of repeating history and what has been shouted over and over, 
Citron will present just three NEW stories from the past 60 days.  This 
illustrates that just because the risk has been acknowledged does not 
mean it has gone away....or priced in.

For years, critics have thrown the concern about government regulation at 
Monster Beverage, and the company has obviously ignored the warnings.  
The fact that Monster continues this type of youth-oriented marketing only 
emphasizes how critically important the teen market is to their business 
model.    
 


Citron has seen this story before:  government action is slow, but when 
they come down, it is for real.  Look at the impacts on former Citron 
subjects Apollo Group (APOL), Valeant (VRX) and World Acceptance  
(WRLD). 
 


Government regulation could take the form of one or more of these many 
actions, and they will impact Monster's bottom line: 


 Suspend sales to anyone under the age of 18, which is currently a bill 
in Massachusetts.  https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H2023 


 Regulate Marketing to teens 
 Potential tax on all energy drinks (a risk disclosed in Monster's 10-K) 
 Regulation by FDA 
 Warning Labels as required by FDA if it were forced to revert its 


labelling to "nutritional product" instead of "food / beverage" 
 


While it does not appear any of these risks will hit by tomorrow, it is naïve 
for any investor to discount these risks to zero, blindly trusting multi-year 
CAGR and gross margin projections extended mindlessly into the future. 
 


Health concerns have slowed Monster sales before: 


 
http://seekingalpha.com/article/1416921-monster-beverage-management-discusses-q1-2013-results-


earnings-call-transcript?part=single  


“The softness in the energy drink market that I alluded to in my previous 
conference call on February 27, 2013 continued through the first quarter of 
2013, we believe, partially due to the ongoing negative publicity that 
continues to appear in the media, questioning the safety of energy drinks 
and suggesting limitations on their ingredients, including caffeine and/or 
the levels thereof and/or minimum age restrictions for consumers. In 
some of our international markets, the energy drink category also appears 
to have slowed in the quarter.”

  Conclusion 


Citron is not saying that Monster misses its next quarter, necessarily.  We're 
not even stating that the company's business isn’t successful or valuable.  
We are just saying that it will never grow into its valuation.   
 
That said, if anyone ever wanted exposure to Monster Beverages, why not 
just follow the biggest beverage company in the world?  Buy Coca Cola; you 
get superior diversification, as well as a 17% position in Monster ... without 
the reputational risk.

Appendix:  Why The Above Deaths Aren’t Reported to the FDA  


The True Impact of an Innocuous-Looking Label Change… 





 
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/in-a-new-aisle-energy-drinks-sidestep-rules.html?_r=2 


Before After 





And When Someone Demands Accountability for them, Monster 
has Made Sure the Data Won't be There!  
 


In 2013, Monster relabeled their cans as a food (beverage) rather than as a 
nutritional supplement.  Why?  Supplement labeling was OK, it offered 
broad protections under the FDA's GRAS (Generally Regarded as Safe) "safe 
harbor" for Monster's ingredients.  With no actual change to the product 
ingredients inside the can, what was their real motive? 
   


“Fans of Monster Energy, the popular high-caffeine energy drink, may not notice the 
change: its ingredients will be the same and its familiar label bearing a green, clawlike 
monogram will change only slightly. But the drink’s maker has decided after a decade of 
selling it as a dietary supplement to market it as a beverage, a switch that will bring 
significant changes in how it is regulated.” 


-- New York Times, March 19, 2013

The company was “no longer required to tell federal regulators 
about reports potentially linking its products to deaths and 
injuries.” 


http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/in-a-new-aisle-energy-drinks-sidestep-rules.html?_r=3 
 


Consider the FDA's requirement that adverse events for nutritional 
products are reportable into the FDA's voluntary adverse events database.  
Up to 2012, there had been 34 deaths attributed to energy drinks posted.  
Of course, these databases are statistically inconclusive -- reporting is 
voluntary -- so statistical accuracy isn't conclusive.  But at least there's 
someplace to look when patterns of unsafe consumption begin to emerge.  
And here's where the trail ends....in 2012.  
 


http://www.fda.gov/Food/NewsEvents/ucm328536.htm 
 


By executing this simple label change, the company shut down the US 
public's ability to see data on adverse events attributable to energy drinks.  
 


Think about it.  No Doz, sold for decades over the counter as an "Alertness 
Aid", has warning labels, and adverse event requirements.  But delivering 
the same caffeine dose, a Monster Energy drink has no such labeling.  No 
dosing info on the label, and no warnings, not for kids, or people with 
cardiac irregularities, nobody. 
 


If it turns out that energy drinks can expose certain groups with 
cardiovascular vulnerabilities to risks beyond a safety threshold, or if they 
increase the likelihood that partygoers mixing alcohol with energy drinks 
will be induced to drive while drunk, or a variety of difficult-to-guess 
interactions are already threatening the health of subgroups of consumers, 
this label change stifles the public's ability to know.  As it cut off the list of 
individuals who died after consuming energy drinks as of 2012.  (See here 
and here.)  
 


This is a recipe for a high-profile class-action suit; and we're not talking 
about one of those bogus shareholder suits cooked up by opportunistic 
attorneys.  We're talking about somebody who has lost a loved one and 
dispatches their attorneys to make very public this iconic moment of 
corporate non-accountability.  
 


Now do you understand why Coca Cola divested its entire energy drink 
portfolio to Monster?
