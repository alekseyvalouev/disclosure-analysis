Unprofitable	Allied	Irish	Banks	At	4.98	Times	Book	Value	-	An	Absurd
Valuation
Oct.	25,	2013	1:18	PM	ET29	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


In	three	articles	since	mid-2011,	we	explained	the	massive	overvaluation	of	Allied	Irish
Banks	(OTCQB:AIBYY).	Despite	those	numerous	warnings,	AIB	shares	have	recently
risen	to	ridiculous	heights.


On	Monday	21	October	at	its	intraday	peak	of	0.16	EUR,	AIB	was	trading	at	a	market
capitalisation	of	82.9	billion	EUR,	at	a	price	to	book	ratio	of	about	7.8.	At	the	(Irish)	close
of	Thursday	24	October	of	0.102	EUR,	AIB	still	has	a	market	capitalisation	of	52.8	billion
EUR,	with	a	price	to	book	ratio	of	4.98.


With	most	banks	trading	at	price	to	book	ratios	of	about	1	and	nearly	all	at	price	to	book
ratios	under	2,	AIB's	valuation	is	out	of	touch	with	the	rest	of	the	sector.


At	a	more	reasonable	price	to	book	ratio	of	1,	AIB	shares	would	need	to	fall	to	about
0.0202	EUR.	For	US	investors	in	the	ADRs,	this	is	equivalent	to	a	share	price	of	0.0202	*
10	*	1.3800	=	0.28	USD	per	share.	At	a	generous	price	to	book	ratio	of	1.5,	similar	to	that
given	to	Wells	Fargo	(NYSE:WFC),	AIB	would	trade	at	0.0303	EUR	or	0.42	USD	for	the
ADRs.


For	what	it's	worth,	when	we	first	wrote	about	AIB	in	July	2011,	we	gave	a	price	target	of
0.033	EUR	per	share,	or	about	10%	higher	than	the	generous	valuation	applied	above.
Just	in	case	you're	wondering,	AIB	is	still	unprofitable,	so	it's	difficult	to	use	an	earnings-
based	metric	such	as	a	P/E	ratio.


Goodbody	Corporate	Finance	valuation


Earlier	this	week,	the	Irish	Times	reported	that


"The	State's	shareholding	in	AIB	and	Bank	of	Ireland	is	managed	by	the
National	Pensions	Reserve	Fund	(NPRF),	under	direction	from	the
Government.	According	to	an	independent	valuation	by	Goodbody	Corporate
Finance	for	the	NPRF,	AIB	shares	were	worth	only	€0.0079	at	the	end	of	2012.
That	would	give	it	a	market	value	of	€4.1	billion."

This	is	more	than	60%	lower	than	the	0.0202	EUR	valuation	we	gave	above	at	a	price	to
book	ratio	of	1.


Comparison	with	Bank	of	Ireland	(NYSE:IRE)


In	our	second	article	regarding	AIB,	we	compared	its	valuation	to	its	stronger	rival	Bank	of
Ireland,	and	concluded	that	the	latter	is	a	more	sensible	alternative	for	those	looking	to
gain	exposure	to	Irish	banks.


We	update	this	valuation	comparison	below.	Financial	data	from	companies'	June	2013
financial	reports.

Unless	otherwise	indicated,	the	amounts	below	are	in	million	EUR.


Bank	of	Ireland AIB


Assets 134,237 120,602


Liabilities 126,308 110,004


Shareholders'	equity 7,932 10,598


Book	value 7,929 10,598


Shares	outstanding 30,111	million 518,237	million


Recent	share	price 0.262	EUR 0.102	EUR


Market	capitalisation 7,889 52,860.1


Price	to	book	ratio 0.99	times	book 4.98	time	book


Again	this	demonstrates	that	the	AIB	is	an	anomaly,	especially	given	that	Bank	of	Ireland
is	generally	considered	to	be	a	stronger	bank.

The	Irish	listed	shares	closed	on	Thursday	24	October	at	0.102	EUR.	The	equivalent	price
for	US	listed	ADRs	is	0.102	*	10	*	1.38	=	1.41	USD	per	share.	However	on	Thursday,	the
shares	closed	at	$1.79,	and	only	traded	as	low	as	$1.72.	Even	if	AIB	shares	remain	at
0.102	EUR	per	share,	a	price	of	$1.79	in	New	York	is	more	than	26%	the	USD	equivalent
of	the	price	in	Ireland.


Why	is	AIB	trading	at	such	lofty	levels?


The	main	reason	for	AIB's	absurd	valuation	is	that	about	99.8%	of	the	shares	outstanding
are	held	by	the	Irish	government.


Therefore	the	investing	public	only	holds	about	1	billion	shares	(worth	about	102	million
EUR	at	a	share	price	of	0.102	EUR).	It	seems	that	AIB	investors	are	largely	ignoring	the
government's	ownership	of	over	518	billion	shares,	and	don't	understand	that	its	market
capitalisation	is	over	52	billion	EUR.


According	to	the	Irish	Times	article	above,	it	seems	that	the	government	/	NPRF	does	not
have	any	immediate	intentions	to	sell	part	or	all	of	their	99.8%	shareholding	at	these	high
levels:


"No	comment	was	available	from	AIB	yesterday	on	whether	any	intervention
was	being	considered	by	the	board.


"A	spokesman	for	the	Department	of	Finance	said	he	was	"not	aware	of	any
change	to	the	current	position"	relating	to	the	trading	of	AIB	shares.	The	NPRF
declined	to	comment."


The	Irish	government	/	NPRF	is	not	acting	in	the	best	interests	of	its	citizens	if	it	continues
to	hold	over	50	billion	EUR	of	stock	in	a	bank	that	does	not	deserve	such	a	rich	valuation.
We	concede	that	it	is	not	realistic	to	expect	the	entire	500-plus	billion	share	stake	to	be
sold	above	0.10	EUR,	but	at	the	very	least,	the	NPRF	should	be	able	to	sell	some	of	its
shares	at	these	high	prices.


Catalyst	for	decline


It	doesn't	seem	that	the	NPRF	is	looking	to	sell	their	shares	in	the	near	future,	however	if
they	changed	their	mind	this	would	provide	an	obvious	catalyst	for	the	shares	to	decline.
The	manic	rise	in	AIB	shares	in	recent	weeks	mirrors	the	rise	seen	in	January	and
February	2012.	Following	that	rise,	the	stock	declined	to	0.07	EUR	in	less	than	3	months,

and	to	0.05	EUR	in	the	following	7	months.	It's	reasonable	to	expect	a	similar	gradual
decline	from	here	as	shareholders	digest	the	stock's	high	valuation,	as	described	both
here	and	also	in	the	previously	mentioned	Irish	Times	article.


Conclusion


As	we've	concluded	in	our	three	previous	articles	about	AIB,	the	company's	stock
deserves	a	valuation	much	closer	to	0.03	EUR.


Other	authors	have	concurred	with	our	analysis	-	including	Felix	Salmon	of	Reuters,	who
stated	that	AIB's	pricing	at	this	level	is	an	example	of	a	market	inefficiency.	Although	that
article	was	published	on	26	October	2011,	it	applies	equally	to	AIB	at	the	time	of	writing.


At	a	generous	price	to	book	ratio	of	1.50,	AIB	would	trade	at	0.0303	EUR	per	share,	or
$0.42	per	ADR.	At	current	levels	of	0.102	EUR	per	share,	the	stock	is	extremely
overvalued.	The	ADRs	at	$1.79	are	even	more	overvalued.
