The perils of misinterpreting conference calls - Universal
Travel Group and Priceline edition
 
On 15 September 2010 I wrote the first of a series of blog posts which implied that Universal Travel
Group was likely a fraud. 
 
I am happy to be somewhat more direct now because the CEO, CFO and the company have settled
fraud charges with the SEC for cash. 
 
Still, not everybody agreed with the analysis and they pointed to a partnership with Agoda (a
subsidiary of Priceline) which was announced on 13 July 2010. Moreover the CEO of Priceline in a
conference call (3 August 2010) seemed to endorse Universal Travel. 
 
To quote: 


Douglas Anmuth (Barclays Capital, Research Division) 


First on the air tickets, you saw some modest re-acceleration, and I think, on an easier
comp in 2Q, but can you talk about whether you're seeing any impact from higher
airfares on leisure travel? And then, secondly, can you give us some more color on
Agoda's partnership with Universal Travel Group and how you're thinking about
this strategically going forward? 


Jeffery H. Boyd (Chairman, Chief Executive Officer) 


Dan, why don’t you hit the airfare, and I’ll do Universal Travel? 


Daniel J. Finnegan (Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer) 


Doug, we are seeing some softness in airline ticket demand, given the increase in
airfares, and we also see some impact for our Domestic business on online advertising
expense as a percentage of gross profits. So those higher prices are driving more clicks
as people shop more and try and look for better prices out there. So we are seeing
some impact from that. But again, just to emphasize that airline tickets are a pretty
small part of our total gross profit, and what we're seeing there in terms of softness is
built into our forecast for Q3. 


Jeffery H. Boyd 


And with respect to Agoda and Universal Travel, they're building their distribution
through other travel websites in the region, and I think this just represents their
continued progress on that front.


 
And so people thought (incorrectly) that Universal Travel were building their distribution and that the
deal was real. 
 
In reality Agoda was happily allowing other people to display their hotel inventory and the Priceline
CEO thought that this was one-of-those-deals. His answer relates to Agoda. At least I think it does.
(Other people had a different opinion... but that opinion now requires that you think that Jeffery Boyd
was a participant in the Universal Travel fraud... something that seems unlikely.) 
 
In retrospect Jeffery Boyd probably should have given a more precisely worded answer...
