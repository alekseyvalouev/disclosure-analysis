AtriCure (ATRC): Addressing the Sell-Side Response 
 
 


“Well, you know what I say: Never trust a man with two first names…” 
 – Joel Hodgson, Mystery Science Theater 3000 





AtriCure chose not to provide a response to our initial report, apart from a short email statement to Bloomberg 
that it “contained unfounded, misleading claims.” We take this lack of detailed response to indicate that the 
Company prefers to avoid drawing further attention to the issues we outlined in our original report. 
 
As of Friday, 7 of the 8 analysts covering the Company have also chosen to remain silent, while one has decided 
to stick his neck out in a poorly constructed, single page defense of the Company. We are aware that this morning, 
an additional firm has put out a defense, yet we have yet to review it. We stand by our initial research and remain 
short AtriCure. 
 
Safety of “Minimally Invasive” Surgeries and Adverse Events 
 
The analyst’s emphasis on differentiation between device malfunction and procedural error cleverly avoids 
tackling the key issue we highlighted in our initial report: “minimally invasive” surgeries pushed by AtriCure’s 
“Starting Five” are prone to errors and complications not only due to the devices used, but due to the nature of 
the “minimally invasive” surgery. 
 
We believe that choosing to focus on the MDR database as a “more accurate reflection of device-related issues” 
is akin to focusing on the number of times a hammer “malfunctioned” while being used as a cleaning tool in a 
China shop. Separately, we believe it’s illogical to disregard data reported by the numerous physicians utilizing 
these devices in the MAUDE database and solely focus on company reported data. 
 
Investors who wish to dig into the granular detail provided by the MAUDE database can easily do so. We expect 
they will find plenty of detail, including causation and differentiation between physician error and device 
malfunction. To classify it as “unreliable source of information with no details around causation of material 
adverse events required or provided” is puzzling. To that end, we’ve provided several event descriptions in the 
table below, as well as the associated comments, if available, of the renowned cardiologist we consulted who 
provided his opinions on these events. Note that in some cases, we’ve shortened descriptions for brevity due to 
the sheer lengthiness of the details included:

STABLE CONDITION. FOUR DAYS POST DISCHARGE, THE SURGEON WAS TOLD BY THE 
PATIENT’S WIFE THAT HER HUSBAND COLLAPSED AND DIED THAT SAME DAY (B)(6)

Off-Label Promotion 
 
The analyst characterized AtriCure’s physician training as “a prudent strategy, which is completely certified in 
practice.” We believe this mis-characterizes our initial report, which highlighted multiple examples of AtriCure-
sponsored presentations given by Dr. Makati through the years where off-label usage is apparently being 
promoted. See again below:
Culper Research AtriCure, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATRC) September 9, 2019

We take no issue with the Company training doctors on how to use its devices, so long as this training pertains to 
FDA-approved indications for that device.  
 
Physician Payments 
 
On the topic of physician payments, the analyst states that “a key misinterpretation of this dataset is that the 
reason for payment is missing,” yet himself fails to offer a reason for payments. To that end, we question whether 
the analyst spent much time in the Open Payments database, because the deeper one looks at these payments, 
the less favorable that AtriCure appears.  
 
In 2018, AtriCure’s “consulting” payments (of which 1,077 were made) totaled $2.7 million, while education 
payments (of which 59 were made) totaled $4,977 (no, we’re not missing any commas). Data also indicate that 
$2.1 million of the $3.6 million of payments made in 2018 were associated with the Epi-Sense system. Of the 
Company’s $2.7 million in consulting payments, $1.8 million were associated with the Epi-Sense system: 
 


  
 
Against these figures, the Company’s minimally invasive segment revenues in the US were just $35 million in 2018, 
or 22% of total US revenues. Moreover, the Company also sells the Isolator Synergy Access Clamp, Fusion System, 
and Subtle System, among other products in this segment. Thus, we estimate that Epi-Sense sales were no more 
than one-third of this segment’s revenues, or just 7% of total US revenues.

We find it troubling that AtriCure pays such a robust level of consulting payments related to a device that both (1) 
remains unapproved by the FDA for the treatment of Afib, and (2) is responsible for a relatively minor portion of 
the Company’s revenues. Note that investors are unable to explain these figures as being related to CONVERGE, 
as they exclude research payments, which totaled $1.3 million in 2018. Perhaps the analyst can take another shot 
at offering his own interpretation of this more detailed payment data. 
 
Broadly, we raised three additional issues in our initial report that remain unaddressed: 
 


1. One of the Company’s own physician spokespersons stated that a portion of AtriCure’s customer base is 
double billing for minimally-invasive hybrid procedures, which we’ve confirmed in the original report. 


 
2. Surgeons who are highly-paid by AtriCure are marketing surgical ablation procedures directly to patients, 


hence subverting EP-based lines of treatment. We are yet to receive clarification on true ownership of 
www.wolfminimaze.com, as well as the source of the anonymous donation to the “American Foundation 
for Women’s Health” otherwise d/b/a www.StopAfib.org. 
 


3. The Company remains under DOJ investigation and has received a Civil Investigative Demand. 
 


4. Over the past several years, AtriCure has guided to profitability several times, yet continues to burn cash 
and thus rely on the capital markets. 
 
 


We remain short AtriCure.
