China Sky Removed from Investor’s Business
Daily 100 List.


Posted on April 27, 2009 by Asensio.com


On Friday, China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) was


removed from the Investor’s Business Daily IBD 100 list of stocks.


The IBD list, updated weekly, compiles stocks selected for certain


favorable quantitative metrics. China Sky appeared on the IBD list


for only one week. The company also appeared on the IBD list in


January, again for only one week.


A report was previously distributed by asensio.com titled “China


Sky Placed on Investor’s Business Daily 100 List Erroneously.” This


report questioned the percentage change in earnings per share


(EPS) used by IBD as a metric determining China Sky’s ranking on


the list. The report also questioned the discrepancy between


technical factors that determined IBD’s ranking of China Sky and an


IBD article with a negative view of China Sky’s technicals.


Attached to this report are exhibits showing the various


discrepancies in China Sky’s disclosures on EPS and in the


associated calculation of percentage change in EPS.


Two representatives of IBD were contacted on the issue of EPS


metric used in IBD’s list. One stated, “The quality of China Sky One’s


accounting is considered lower-tier, but we don’t assume the


numbers are wrong.” The other representative stated that the list


“is not a buy or recommendation list of any kind.”
