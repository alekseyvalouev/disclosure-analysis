Ocean Power Technologies: Destined To Wipe Out?

Summary


Expected approval in November of a lawsuit settlement will likely release stock that
may dilute current shareholders.


The lawsuit alleges misleading statements by OPTT and systemic problems with its
technology.


The SEC is investigating OPTT, including "public disclosure" issues.


Revenues are always very low; losses are always very high. In FY 2016, revenues
didn't reach $1 million but losses exceeded $13 million.


Cash burn is ~$1 million monthly. The company depends on equity and debt
financing. OPTT is the industry's worst in many metrics.


Ocean Power Technologies (NASDAQ:OPTT) has been riding a wave of momentum
trading activity. Since mid-July, it's been a lot of fun. But TheStreetSweeper has spotted
ferocious waves swelling up on the horizon, and we believe OPTT is careening toward a
wipe out.


OPTT began operating two decades ago and still hasn't figured out how to commercialize
its system of generating electricity from ocean waves. On the surface, OPTT's virtually
non-existent revenues appear to depend upon the government.


Really though, stock offerings and debt have kept the company afloat. It closed two stock
deals last quarter but is left with no committed sources of equity or debt financing right
now.


Meanwhile, OPTT has figured out how to attract a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation, and become the subject of a class action lawsuit poised with potential stock
dilution for loyal stockholders.


The stock is flying right now, partially because the market doesn't understand the
insignificance of the September 13 announcement. The company hopes to develop a
power buoy with the U.S. Office of Naval Research. The initial phase won't be complete

until early June 2017. And OPTT is only getting ~$250,000 for that phase and may receive
up to another $500,000 more if it's completed and Naval Research finds the funding... a
whole lot of ifs.


Let's look at nine factors TheStreetSweeper believes will dunk this stock.


*1. Money Flies Out The Door Month After Month, Year After Year


In the most recent quarter, OPTT made just $200,000. And it took ~15 times that to
operate the business - a whopping $2.9 million.

In the entire fiscal year of 2016, the company's revenue didn't even reach $1 million, but
losses hit the $13 million mark...

The financials are so awful that auditors say it's highly doubtful the company can even
continue to operate. OPTT just stuffed its piggy bank with $3.6 million raised from a stock
offering in July, increasing the total cash to $9 million.


But the company has been making nearly $1 million hits on the piggy bank each month,
bringing the cash to about $7 million. That won't last long...


*2. Investors On The Line


OPTT warns that it can't seem to stop burning up money and shareholders' investment
ultimately may be lost:

"If we are not successful in our efforts to raise additional capital sufficient to support
our operations," the company's latest 10-Q warns, "we would be forced to cease
operations, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our
company."


In fact, the potential for diluting OPTT stock once again could happen as soon as
November...


*3. Tragedy, Lawsuit, Dilution Overhanging


The stock dilution threat is just around the corner, depending on a federal judge's approval
of settlement terms of a consolidated lawsuit aimed at OPTT.


The company has been sued by a class of investors who bought the stock around the time
of the April 4, 2014 secondary offering at $3.10 per share. The lawsuit alleges OPTT and
its CEO issued untrue and misleading statements between January and June 2014.


At this point, it looks like OPTT will pay $500,000 and its insurer will pay $2.5 million under
the settlement. Here's the potential dilution kicker: OPTT will also hand over 380,000
shares under the current terms. That's about 12% of the 3.15 million shares outstanding.


The court has scheduled a November 14, 2016 hearing to consider approving the
settlement terms of the lawsuit.


During the hearing, one confidential witness called the OPTT business a "Greek tragedy."
The witness added that "it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that (former CEO)
Chuck Dunleavy and George (Taylor, Ocean Power co-founder) were just manipulating
things."


*4. Witnesses: Fundamental Problems Plague Technology


Another witness testified that the company deployed a PowerBuoy in the sea off
Scotland's northern coast at a cost of about $15 million. The device operated one to two
days. The buoy remained in the ocean, according to testimony, on fears that removing it
right away would damage OPTT's reputation.


And a former engineering director testified that the technology has systemic problems.
The amount of energy OPTT claimed it could produce at quoted prices was "impossible,"
said the engineer.

One witness said a flawed hydraulic power system kept the Scotland buoy from producing
even enough electricity to sustain its own operation, let alone enough for applications.


Another said that, while everyone thought the buoy had been operational for four months,
it actually took that long to get the buoy positioned in the sea. The witness said the buoy
worked properly for about two hours over about two weeks of operation and produced no
power.


Testimony also indicated that the much-touted Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) involvement
with the Wave Project actually resulted in free help from Lockheed - but no investment.


The $232 million project was called the world's biggest wave energy project and OPTT
expected to receive around $65 million from Australia. Deemed commercially unviable, the
project is now dead in the water... just like the terminated Oregon project.


The ugly lawsuit allegations apparently made their way to the SEC...


*5. The Securities and Exchange Commission Investigates OPTT


The SEC is deep into an investigation that was recently expanded with the issuance of a
second subpoena on July 12, 2016. This subpoena also revolves around Ocean Power's
2014 public stock offering.


The commission opened the investigation early last year with a subpoena related to
"public disclosures" involving the company's now-defunct demonstration project.


The lawsuits and regulatory investigation add yet another layer of expense, management
distraction and uncertainty. But something is certain. Insiders are busy...


*6. Insiders Yell "Sell!"


Insiders have stayed busy unloading shares of their company. No insiders have bought
stock since mid-2015 and the sellers over the past year have been big name folks.
George Kirby is the CEO. He has sold 55,000 shares... at just ~$1.57 each.


Mark Featherstone should know a thing or two about OPTT's financial condition and future
because he's the principal accounting officer. He has dumped more than 4,100 shares this
year, some for an average of $7.29 and others for $1.54.

At these high prices, it wouldn't be shocking to see even more insider selling very soon. If
insiders have lost confidence in their company's future, why should other investors feel
otherwise?


*7. Industry's Worst Performer


In metric after metric, OPTT is the industry's very worst performer:
