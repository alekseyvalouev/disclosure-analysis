OSTK


We believe Overstock.com’s businesses are performing poorly and the stock has
enormous downside.


OSTK shares appear to have similarities with two of our previous great shorts,
EROS and GERN; we think the reality for OSTK is much worse than current
investor perception.


Overstock’s retail business is suffering its worst revenue declines in history and a
recent accounting change allowed it to report a profit.


tZERO has had limited adoption as shown by app store trends.


Overstock digital preferred dividend looks like a non-event and we identify clear
reasons why it will not cause a short squeeze.

People Think Overstock’s Retail Division Is Turning Around,
But It Is Suffering Its Worst Revenue Declines In History


Many of our best shorts come when we can identify large gaps between how bullish
investors and management are portraying a situation and what we think the objective
facts support. In the case of Overstock.com, we believe the gap between perception and
reality is as wide as we have ever seen. As a reminder, we shorted Eros International
PLC (NYSE: EROS) ("Eros PLC") and Geron (NASDAQ: GERN) because we believed
the reality was starkly different from investor perception and how management portrayed
their businesses and prospects. Both management teams made outlandish statements
and were briefly able to kite their stocks as investors bought in. However, the reality was
nowhere near as positive, and both companies saw their share prices plummet to close
to $1.* We see a similar future for Overstock.com (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:OSTK)
(“Overstock”) as investors come to understand that the reality of the company’s
businesses is actually quite negative. We wouldn’t be surprised if the shares trade close
to $1 in the near future.


On its last earnings call, Overstock’s management team profusely congratulated
themselves on the amazing turnaround achieved in the retail division. CEO Patrick
Bryne made statements such as, “Our retail business has snapped back quicker than
anticipated, delivering positive adjusted EBITDA,” and “We're very bullish about our
retail business.” They also pointed to positive SEO trends (slide 31) as signs that the
retail business is firing on all cylinders.


We believe the truth is very different. We do not believe the retail division has turned
around. In fact, our research indicates that there’s substantial evidence to suggest that
the retail business is imploding and may be beyond repair.


Overstock management clearly wants investors to focus on the improved profitability of
the retail division. As we’ll show later, we believe this is solely due to a discretionary
change in how management is accounting for expenses and that on a like-for-like basis,
the retail business continues to generate losses and to burn cash.


We think that the most alarming part of the retail business is that it’s seeing accelerating
revenue declines.

In fact, the current retail revenue declines are the worst in Overstock’s history as a
public company. Below is a chart of revenue growth and declines over the last 12 years.
Even during the worst parts of the Great Recession in 2009, the revenue declines in
retail never got this severe. We have not seen any signs of a revenue turnaround in the
business and believe revenue declines may be getting worse.

We believe A Recent Accounting Change Allowed Overstock
To Report Profits In The Retail Business


While management states that the retail business is stabilizing and improving, we
believe the revenue trends are clear evidence that the retail division has not turned
around and that its performance is deteriorating rapidly.


Overstock’s management team loves making a big deal about the improved profitability
of the retail division. On the past earnings call, Dave Nielsen, President of Overstock
Retail, stated, “Many expected this turnaround to take years to return to profitability.”


In the 2Q 2019 earnings release, Overstock has a table that shows the retail business
has generated what appears to be a modest profit.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/12/959452-15656281064662375_origin.jpg

http://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstockcom-reports-q2-2019-results
We believe this “improvement” in profitability is due to an accounting change that
management began employing the last two quarters. This change is disclosed in the fine
print section of the earnings release. In it, Overstock states, “Beginning in the first
quarter of 2019, we began allocating corporate support costs (administrative functions
such as finance, human resources, and legal) to our operating segments based on their
estimated usage and based on how we manage our business.”


Without the accounting change, the retail business would have been loss-making on a
non-adjusted basis (i.e. how Overstock has reported its retail EBITDA historically), as
can be seen in the 2Q 2019 presentation (slide 22). If Overstock had not changed its
accounting practice, we assess that the retail business would have lost $2 million during
2Q 2019 and lost $10 million year to date through June. This may not be apparent to
investors who rely mainly on earnings releases, and these investors may get the wrong
impression by focusing on Overstock's reported profitability numbers.

Overstock Is Burning Cash And Has Less Than One Year Of
Cash Based On Its Trailing Cash Burn Rate


Contrary to management’s multiple statements that the retail business turned profitable
during the quarter, we believe that an accounting change was the source of profits in the
retail business and that the retail business remains under significant pressure.


Management also likes to portray that the company is on its way to solid financial
footing, making statements such as, “We'd like to be operating at a place in the next
year or so where retail profits are more than able to fund the Medici Ventures' operating
outlays,” on the last earnings call. We see no signs of this, and it appears to us that the
company is in a dire financial situation.


Due to the losses at the overall company, Overstock is still burning cash. Last year,
Overstock had negative free cash flow of $167.6 million. Through June, Overstock has
burned another $76.4 million in free cash flow. Now, cash reserves appear to be running
low. Trailing twelve month free cash flow is negative $160.7 million versus current cash
levels of $121.3 million. Based on trailing twelve month cash burn, Overstock has less
than one year of cash remaining.

https://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstockcom-reports-q2-2019-results
To offset its high cash burn, Overstock has utilized its At The Market (“ATM”) facility with
JonesTrading. Through June 30, 2019, Overstock raised $52.1 million net dollars by
issuing shares at an average price of $17.84, and from August to December 2018,
Overstock sold stock worth $97.0 million in gross proceeds. We think Overstock
management has demonstrated with its actions that the current share price is a great
price to sell shares.


This issuance has caused Overstock’s share count to rise from 28.8 million on March 8,
2018 to 35.3 million as of August 2, 2019. In other words, as the Retail division has
suffered revenue year-over-year declines of 9%, 18% and 23%, Overstock has been
diluting investors by 23% by selling shares and only disclosing the sales in its SEC
filings.


Unfortunately for Overstock, the company has fully utilized its $150 million ATM facility
with JonesTrading during the second quarter, which was revealed in its 10Q:

We believe Overstock’s Retail Business May Be Irreparably
Harmed Based On Customer And Employee Online Reviews


“In August 2018, we entered into a sales agreement with JonesTrading Institutional
Services LLC ("JonesTrading"), under which we conducted "at the market" public
offerings of up to $150 million of our common stock. As of June 30, 2019, we had
sold 5,843,147 shares of our common stock pursuant to the sales agreement and
have received $146.7 million in proceeds, net of $3.3 million of offering costs,
including commissions paid to JonesTrading.”


We think this is alarming. Overstock has $121 million of cash after raising $150 million
through the ATM since August. If the company had not tapped the ATM one last time,
the company would have completely run out of cash. Overstock continues to burn cash,
and we believe Overstock currently has limited avenues to raise cash and may be under
future pressure.


During the 2Q 2019 conference call, Overstock management made multiple statements
about how the retail business is resonating with customers, and said the retail business
has built a “more personalized relationship with the customers” and that they’re
“generating smart value for the customer.”


We disagree. The reality appears to be that the retail business is disliked by both
customers and by its own employees.


On Trustpilot.com, Overstock.com has an average 1 Star Rating and is ranked as “Bad.”
We encourage any investor who believes the retail business is headed for better times
to read the reviews.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4283740-overstock-com-inc-ostk-ceo-patrick-byrne-q2-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single&source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.overstock.com
A recent 1-star review states, “Overstock is scams and lies!! This company doesn’t even
deserve one star that (blank) scam me and don’t care about making it right.”


Another 1-star review from July 29, 2019 warns others, “I wish I had read all the bad
reviews before I ordered from Overstock.” And another 1-star review from July 28, 2019
states, “This is the worst place i have ever bought furniture from. They sent me
damaged merchandise and have still not refunded all of my money.”



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/959452_15655718205821_rId28.png
We know that many review sites skew towards customers who are dissatisfied with their
shopping experience, so we compared the distribution of reviews Overstock received
with those received by its competitors. To do so, we measured the percent of positive
reviews to the percent of negative reviews for each company, with a lower number being
worse. For instance a score of 0.5 would mean there is one positive review for every two
negative reviews. As can be seen in the chart below, Overstock scored by far the worst
of all of the companies we measured:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/959452_15655718205821_rId29.png
Even many employees at Overstock seem to be dissatisfied. Many of the recent
glassdoor reviews are shocking, with warnings such as this one where a former Buyer in
the retail business states, “Don’t get sold the dream,” and “Whoever is in charge of
running the retail side clearly should be fired. They don't know what they're doing and
then after all the damage is done, they fire people to save a few bucks after holding a
meeting with the CEO where he's telling people not to be worried. So many mixed
messages and suspicious activity going on.”

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Overstock-com-RVW25372813.htm
In a May 2019 review from a current senior software engineer, the employee calls
Overstock a “sinking ship” and writes, “The company is an absolute disaster with no real
plan. The Retail side of the business is always in talks to be sold so the company can
focus on the worthless crypto side.”

We also measured overall reviews on glassdoor for Overstock. The company was tied
for worst and – amazingly – came in well behind routinely derided companies such as
Wal-Mart:

tZERO Appears To Be A Failing App


While Overstock management wants investors to believe the retail business has turned
around and that its prospects are good, the reality appears to be quite different. We
believe the retail business is seeing alarming revenue declines. We believe its
profitability is due to a recent accounting change. Finally, based on reviews from
customers and employees, we believe the Overstock retail business may be too
damaged to be repaired.


Overstock management makes similarly effusive statements about the tZERO and
Medici Ventures businesses. During the 2Q 2019 conference call, Overstock claimed
that tZERO is a “killer app,” and that Medici Ventures is a “wonderful symphony” and
specifically mentioned its progress in Blockchain-based land governance, voting and
motion picture financing. We believe the evidence suggests that tZERO is struggling to
gain traction in the cryptocurrency community, and we struggle to see the value of
Medici Ventures’ offerings.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/959452_15655718205821_rId35.png
In terms of tZERO, we haven’t found evidence to suggest that it’s a “killer app.” We
looked for the tZERO app in both the Apple and Google Play stores, and found that
adoption of tZERO has been dreadfully limited.


As for the tZERO token itself, the price is down nearly 60% from its issuance price of
$10 per token and just traded $12,000 in total volumes in a single day.


While management claims tZERO is a success and investor perception is that tZERO
holds a lot of promise, we believe the reality is quite different and are less positive on
tZERO’s future prospects. We doubt that non-accredited investors will rush to buy a
token that lacks liquidity and has shown no ability to return to its issue price.

We Believe Medici Ventures’ Product Offerings Lack A Value
Proposition


tZERO Dividend Is Unlikely To Result In A Short Squeeze


Outside investors appear to share our view since Overstock has had trouble getting
outside investors to invest significantly in tZERO. We do not believe that GSR’s $5
million investment is a real comp because GSR walked away from its initial investment
of up to $270 million. From our perspective, the $5 million looks like a termination fee
that Overstock has positioned as an “investment” into tZERO, or a way for both parties
to save face. In either case, we believe such a substantially reduced level of investment
is not indicative of significant value for tZERO.


As for Medici Ventures’ other product offering as part of its “keiretsu,” we struggle to see
the value proposition. During the 2Q 2019 conference call, management specifically
mentioned their progress in Blockchain-based land governance, voting and motion
picture financing. Motion pictures are readily funded, and there’s a lot of competition
from traditional studio companies and newer entrants like Netflix and Amazon Studios
that appear to have limitless budgets.


In terms of land right governance and voting, these are largely well functioning
governmental services. We haven’t read widespread reports about people having their
land titles stolen from them, and don’t see a need for people to go the Blockchain.
Furthermore, evidence of voter fraud is very limited. These are also governmental
services that aren’t high ticket items. We struggle to see how Medici Ventures will make
a lot of money from local municipalities for mobile voting apps, and from African
countries for land governance.


Lastly, some investors in Overstock believe the Overstock’s announced Digital Voting
Series A-1 Preferred Stock (“digital preferred stock”) dividend will result in a short
squeeze and spike the share price. We think that’s highly unlikely based on clear
precedent from clearing houses.

http://investors.overstock.com/news-releases/news-release-details/overstockcom-inc-declares-dividend-one-digital-share-every-ten
For guidance, investors can look to the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”) Rules and
By-Laws, which are publicly released. The OCC is the world's largest equity derivatives
clearing organization, and these clearing houses govern all the financial transactions
that we do through SEC registered clearing agencies. We believe the OCC’s policies are
inline with those of the major banks in principle. It’s our understanding that the rules
across these organizations are similar because the major banks have large options
market making operations which work in close cooperation with their securities lending
operations in order to hedge the options positions of the market makers. If the policies
were not in harmony, it would create significant difficulties for the banks across their
various divisions. These clearing houses and the major banks will be the ones that
determine how Overstock’s digital preferred stock will be settled given that the digital
preferred stock is not able to be acquired and does not have an ascertainable market
price (or at least does not have a sufficiently efficient and liquid market for the
institutions to ascertain a useful market price).


We believe the relevant section starts with Section 19, Shortage of Underlying
Securities (page 90). Based on our reading, we believe that when a company is unable
to dividend or deliver a security pursuant to its obligations under an option contract, and
the OCC determines that there is a shortage of the underlying security (like Overstock’s
digital preferred stock) and there is no reasonable likelihood that sufficient supply will
become available in the foreseeable future (also like Overstock’s digital preferred stock),
then the OCC will allow for the delivery of the underlying security to be cash settled.
While each clearing house and the major banks will have their own specific policies, we
believe that they largely agree in principle and that the major institutions handling
Overstock’s digital preferred stock will come to the same outcome (cash settlement)
even if it is not ultimately through the same mechanism.


We believe Overstock’s digital preferred stock checks all the boxes under which the
clearing houses and the major banks will settle the delivery of digital preferred stock in
cash instead of delivering the underlying security.


For people who are interested in reading the relevant section, please see Section 19(a)
(4)(c):

That actually makes a lot of sense to us. Most Overstock investors don’t hold a
brokerage account with Dinosaur Financial Group, LLC, which they would need to have
in order to trade the digital preferred stock, and there will be many holders who don’t set
one up in time. Dinosaur Financial Group is a broker-dealer that is a subscriber to PRO
Securities ATS, an SEC registered alternative trading system operated by PRO
Securities, a tZERO subsidiary. In other words, Overstock investors need to create a
brokerage account with an entity ultimately owned by Overstock in order to trade the
digital preferred stock.

https://help.overstock.com/help/s/article/Shareholder-Information
We believe Overstock Offers A Compelling Short Opportunity


In addition, large holders of Overstock like Allianz Asset Management GmbH, Blackrock
and Vanguard likely don’t want to create a Dinosaur Financial brokerage account in
order to receive the digital preferred stock, and in fact the bylaws of their mutual funds
and other investment vehicles may not allow them to hold such a security at all, which is
common. Finally, there is some evidence to suggest that Overstock will not allow for the
digital preferred stock to trade for six months after they are issued in order to comply
with applicable securities laws (although it is not clear that the securities laws actually
mandate such a trading restriction). Therefore, it is not likely that there will be sufficient
supply of the digital preferred stock to provide for the physical settlement of all option
contracts.


In addition to the clear precedent that exists for a cash settlement of the proposed digital
dividend, we believe there are significant financial motivations on the part of the
investment banks, asset managers and exchanges to facilitate an orderly cash
settlement. For both the investment banks and asset managers, hard to borrow
securities like Overstock are major revenue generators. If companies are able to easily
cause a short squeeze by declaring Blockchain-based dividends, short sellers will
quickly abandon the practice of shorting hard to borrow stocks and, in the process, they
will destroy this revenue stream for the investment banks and asset managers.
Likewise, the national exchanges like the NASDAQ create significant value through their
network effects and economies of scale. As a result, they will not want to see volumes
leave for crypto based alternatives like OSTKO. By making moving to crypto unattractive
to listed companies with high short interests by making sure it doesn’t cause a squeeze,
the national exchanges create one fewer reason for listed companies to leave them.


Based on the above, our reading of the Rules and By-Laws of major clearing houses
leads us to believe that Overstock’s dividend preferred stock is likely to be cash settled
by the major banks who have similar policies as the OCC. This would negate any
possibility of a short squeeze, which we believe many Overstock investors assume will
happen.


We believe the most compelling short opportunities exist when perception wildly differs
from reality. Eros PLC and Geron were two of our most recent successes shorting this
theme. We believe Overstock is next.

Appendix


Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


The perception and management commentary is that the retail business has turned a
corner and turned profitable. We think the reality is that the retail business is suffering its
worst revenue declines in its history and remains unprofitable.


Overstock management also wants investors to believe that tZERO is a raging success
and that Medici Ventures’ many product offerings will take off and produce out-sized
profits. In reality, it appears to us that tZERO and its token are failing in the marketplace.
The tZERO app appears to have few users on either the iOS or Android platforms, and
the tZERO token has fallen in value and trades insignificant volumes. As for Medici
Ventures’ other keiretsu offerings, we struggle to see the value proposition in land rights
governance, voting and motion picture financing. We don’t really see a need or a
valuable problem that Medici Venture addresses.


Lastly, we believe investors clinging to the hope that the digital preferred stock dividend
will result in a short squeeze are misguided. The major clearing houses have rules for
such a scenario, and we believe they are likely to settle the dividend in cash instead of
delivering the underlying security.


As Overstock burns cash and as its businesses contract, we believe Overstock is likely
to trade down to $1 per share in the near future, just like Geron and Eros PLC.


Refresher on Eros PLC and Geron.


As a review, in Eros PLC’s case, management promoted the company as the future
“Netflix of India” and stated that the business was already profitable through its film
production business. We believed reality was the complete opposite and that
management was misrepresenting key facts about the business. We believed that
competitors were already far ahead of Eros PLC in streaming and that the company
used aggressive accounting practices which allowed it to show positive EBITDA while
generating negative free cash flow. We wrote about the company when the share price
was $12.86 per share. We were proven right, despite being sued by the company, and
Eros PLC shares now trade at $1.28 per share.
