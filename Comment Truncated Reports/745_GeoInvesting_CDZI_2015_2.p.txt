We Still think Cadiz is
Worthless, Part 2: So. Cal.
Metropolitan Water
Department “Not Pursuing”
CDZI’s Water Project
October 26, 2015 By GeoTeam


Even if you
don’t agree with
our conclusion
on Cadiz Inc.
(NASDAQ:CDZI)
– a conclusion
that states that
CDZI’s sole
project is
extremely


unlikely to materialize (which we will reiterate with new
MWD commentary) – the capital that the company would
have to raise in order to complete this project would likely
be in the hundreds of millions of dollars – a sum that we
think would be near impossible to raise without issuing
tons of equity, especially given the company’s current
balance sheet. In our opinion, Cadiz is just a terrible stock
to own, with or without eventual success of its water
project. Based on MWD’s comments made just days ago,
we look to move the ball further on our case that CDZI’s
equity is worthless.


We continue to stand by our analysis that the equity
in CDZI Is 100% worthless

The company was recently denied a railroad right of
way usage exemption by the Department of the
Interior Bureau of Land Management to use Federal
land to build its water pipeline
The project now appears to be subject to a Federal
review, which we believe has almost zero chance of
receiving approval. In the interim, CDZI is burning
cash with major debt due early 2016.
Even if approved, the company would have to appease
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California,
which owns the Colorado River Aqueduct and which
seems to have “bankruptcy” concerns and a very
strong distaste for all things Cadiz
A Metropolitan Water Department of Southern
California Meeting on October 13, 2015 confirmed the
MWD was “not pursing any negotiations or
conversations at all”

cash burning entity that relies on financing to fund its
operations. The company has a negative tangible book
value and the current CEO appears to be enriching himself
and his law firm by way of CDZI’s common shareholders.
Five key points of our initial article were:


A letter on October 5th from the California State
Office of the Bureau of Land Management continues to
paint a bleak picture for CDZI’s focus – its ongoing
“water project”.
This reconciles with, and further validates, past critical
articles suggesting that the project is doomed for
eventual failure and, as such, the company may be as
well.
On top of its main business operation looking like an
impossibility, CDZI faces a major liquidity crisis and
has enormous debt coming due
As it stands, CDZI’s balance sheet is insolvent and the
company’s equity is worth $0 dollars on paper, with
seemingly no future road toward profitability or cash
generation.
Without steady profits, we value CDZI at what it’s
worth on paper and believe it’s is on its way to $0, be
it from bankruptcy, eventual dilution or other means.


We concluded our article by stating that the recent opinion
of the Bureau of Land Management forecasts a very
dubious, if not outright impossible, future for CDZI’s solo
project – a project that it has been unable to get off the
ground for the last 15 years. Today, we are going to
present brand-new information from an October 13
meeting of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California that seems to finalize that CDZI’s project is not
going to be moving forward in any meaningful capacity at
any time soon.


We think that the comments presented herein clearly
validate our opinion that CDZI, as an investment, is 100%

worthless.


MWD: 13 Years of Worrying Cadiz
Will Go Bankrupt


The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
(“MWD”) plays a crucial role in the future of CDZI’s sole
hope for its business. The Metropolitan Water District owns
and operates the Colorado River Aqueduct (“CRA”), which
is a key component of CDZI’s proposed plan.


From MWD’s website,


To supply the more than 300 cities and unincorporated
areas in Southern California with reliable and safe water,
Metropolitan owns and operates an extensive water
system including: the Colorado River Aqueduct, 16
hydroelectric facilities, nine reservoirs, 819 miles of
large-scale pipes and five water treatment plants.
Four of these treatment plants are among the 10 largest
plants in the world. In fact, Metropolitan is the largest
distributor of treated drinking water in the United States.
The District imports water from the Feather River in
Northern California and the Colorado River to supplement
local supplies. It also helps its member agencies develop
water recycling, storage and other local resource programs
to provide additional supplies and conservation programs
to reduce regional demands.


In other words, the MWD, like the Federal government
whose land CDZI is proposing to use, must be on board
for this project to even think about moving forward as it
has been presented in the past.


Consult this handy checklist provided by CDZI in an
October 2014 PowerPoint:

As you can see, this checklist as it would stand today
would look identical to the one published by the company
in 2014 – of course, with the exception of needing to push
the “Construction Start” phase back some years – or
maybe even eliminating it altogether from the list. As this
slide shows, the company still needs:


1. BLM/ROW approval (recently denied)
2. Finalizations of all purchase and sale agreements of


water (which may take months, if not years, to draft
and implement – and only if step 1 is finally
approved/circumvented)


3. Discussions with the MWD regarding use of the
aqueduct (which we’ll show may be a disaster in and
of itself – and only if steps 1 and 2 are completed)


4. Construction start (again, will require major financing
and steps 1, 2, and 3 to be completed)


Don’t forget, this is all just to complete “Phase 1”.


In our last article, we showed that the company is still
stuck on Step 1. In this article, we’re going to show why
it’s likely that yet another brick wall has been put up at
Step 3 – which we don’t believe CDZI will even get to. Lest

we forget, this all is going to require a monstrous sum of
cash and financing to take care of – which the company
currently does not have.


Only then, of course, would we move onto “Phase 2” –
another portion of the project that looks great on a
PowerPoint slide, but that is going to require exorbitant
sums of financing to implement in reality:


So, we continue to believe CDZI’s
water project, as a whole, is 100%
DOA as it stands.


We learned from the Bureau of Land Management’s recent
letter to the company that a full Federal review of the
project may be forthcoming and that in the past, CDZI’s
science has not seen eye to eye with government science.
You can read more about that in our above linked article.


Assuming they somehow miraculously get past the BLM
roadblock in the project, CDZI is then going to have the
MWD to deal with. Judging by the MWD’s October 13, 2015
meeting minutes, they are less than amused with CDZI and

in their own words, “are not pursing any negotiations or
conversations [with Cadiz] at all.”


The MWD’s October 13, 2015 Legal and Claims Committee
meeting with its Board of Directors, available to stream
and listen to at this link, paints an extremely bleak picture
of Cadiz’s future working with the MWD. Starting at 9
minutes, the MWD general counsel begins to review and
report on the department’s now closed litigation with Cadiz.


MWD’s extremely rocky relationship with Cadiz is evident
as MWD’s counsel lays out the key points of its relationship
that you can follow and listen to in streaming audio. We’ve
denoted the timestamp of these points:


The MWD’s initial concerns with working with CDZI in
2002 were based around CDZI not being able to
finance the project (22:00)
This supplemented a “growing number of reasons the
project might fail” (23:10)
The initial concerns that led to MWD taking a board
vote in 2002 that ultimately voted to “stop the project
in its entirety” (24:40).
Cadiz sued MWD in 2005, costing the MWD $3.1
million and 3 ½ years of legal resources. MWD
ultimately won on five legal causes of action and Cadiz
“walked away” and dismissed the suit with prejudice
after bearing its own costs, while the last claim was
pending (5 contract claims, 1 claim of breach of
fiduciary duty) (26:00).
This resulted in the MWD having a final
determination of not owing Cadiz any duty to
pursue the project that they had proposed to MWD —
in the future (29:00)
He concludes by saying, “Where we are today, as a
result, we don’t owe Cadiz any duty.” (29:40)

MWD: “We are not pursing any
negotiations or conversations at
all.”


After this report of the facts, MWD counsel turns to the
Directors for questions and answers. Several directors,
including Director Dick, sounding somewhat disgusted, ask
questions in order to make sure that MWD has no
obligation to work with Cadiz in the future. The directors,
sounding a little annoyed that Cadiz has put the MWD
through such painful litigation processes in the past, don’t
seem amused by this tremendous waste of legal resources.


In response to a question about the viability of the project
at (33:30), MWD’s counsel replies:


“There is a lot of skepticism on behalf of
Federal Government Agencies. The US
geological survey had done some research back
when we were considering the project and they
were concerned that the recharge through the
basin under the Cadiz property may be as little
as 5,000 acre feet a year…”


Obviously, this doesn’t bode well for an upcoming Federal
review, if that’s what the next step is for the company.
