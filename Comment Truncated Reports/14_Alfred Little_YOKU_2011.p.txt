Youku Business Model Already Failing: Stock Should Follow Suit

The meteoric rise of Youku (NYSE:YOKU) last month cast a spell over Wall Street.
Financial blogs and media outlets trumpeted the arrival of the “Youtube” of China and
investors immediately ran wild with it. The hype caused the stock to skyrocket to almost
$50 before crashing back down to $29 and then briefly rebounding above $40 last week,
where I decided to initiate a short position.


What Youku’s almost fairy tale first couple weeks of trading doesn’t tell you is that this
“Youtube of China” is anything but. Most investors looking at Chinese stocks view them
simply through their financial statements and their ideas of what the Chinese market looks
like from their brief trips there, the couple glasses of “baijiu” pounded over lunch with
management and the articles they’ve read about China. While this approach can work in a
bull market, it does not substitute for on the ground knowledge of the Chinese business
environment and the culture that drives it. A closer look at Youku exposes the fallacies
overlooked by daytraders bidding over $4B for a company with a failing business model
that lost $25 million in the first 3 quarters of 2010 and over $100 million since inception.


First off, a major mistake is misconstruing Youku for a Youtube. We all know Youtube as
the website where we watch Charlie biting his brother’s finger or watch pandas sneezing.
Most Youtube videos are just such user generated content (UGC). Youku started out with
this business plan, but quickly decided UGC was a dead end in China (only 20% of its
videos today are UGC). I’ve spent a fair amount of time in Chinese internet cafes
observing the clientele who spend the majority of their time watching copyrighted full
length TV shows and movies while surfing the internet or playing games. Youku realizes
this too and in its early stages captured a large portion of this massive audience by
allowing users to upload full-length videos, including copyright infringing videos, until
recently. In short, Chinese don’t log onto Youku to watch a chipmunk with a dramatic
stare, but to watch the latest episodes of copyrighted content such as Grey’s Anatomy,
Korean soap operas or the news.


Not surprisingly, as Youku grew infringement lawsuits started piling up. Youku’s first
response was to change its business plan again to spend millions licensing increasingly
expensive professionally produced content that accounts for 70% of its videos today (the
remaining 10% is expensive original content produced by Youku itself). The cost of
professionally produced content, according to Youku, is astronomically rising and is the

major challenge to its current business model since advertisers pay very low rates and
users refuse to pay anything at all. According to Youku’s own IPO filing (page 17, available
here):


The market prices for professionally produced content, especially popular movies
and television serial dramas, have increased significantly in China during the past
few years. For example, according to our internal records, the average license fee
for television serial drama has increased in 2009 by more than 200% as compared
to 2008, and such fee has increased in 2010 to date by more than 100% as
compared to 2009. The average license fee for movies has also increased in 2010 to
date by more than 90% as compared to 2009.


Compared to the rapidly rising costs for content acquisition, the fees advertisers pay
Yokou have barely budged. Youku suffers from intense competition for advertising dollars
from numerous smaller sites that still freely distribute infringing content. This is the worst
kind of diseconomy of scale. The bigger Youku gets, the bigger its losses.


Pressure from the Chinese government for the larger players to remove infringing content
peaked in January 2010, when Youku removed large amounts of infringing content from its
servers by implementing a digital fingerprinting technology meant to root out all copyright
infringing material (article here).


As the chart of daily unique visitors below shows, Youku’s site traffic immediately
collapsed 75%. In October traffic rebounded somewhat but in November the Chinese
government renewed aggressive calls for the continued removal of infringing material from
streaming servers just prior to Youku's IPO (as stated in an article here). Youku is
complying, killing its traffic, and forcing it to pour increasingly large amounts of capital into
licensing fees since its December IPO. Now with most of the illegally uploaded content
removed, Youku’s traffic according to Google Trends has more or less flat-lined since the
IPO and is half of what it was just one year ago despite seeing an uptick since October
(see chart below, click to enlarge):

Anticipating its desperate need for more revenues to pay for rising licensing costs, Youku
in early 2010 began experimenting with charging for its videos via its Youku Premium
service. With this latest change to its business plan, Youku hopes Chinese users will pay
to view what was previously free on Youku (cue cheers from Hollywood and laughs from
Youku’s legions of copyright infringing competitors)!


The company recently announced that it had bought the rights to stream the hit Warner
Bros movie “Inception” on its premium on-demand paid video service (article here). But
Youku has now left itself at a hopeless disadvantage to competitors who stream
copyrighted material just hours after it hits the big screen in America. “Inception”, for one,
was commonplace on Chinese streaming sites at least six months ago. What Chinese
person is going to pay to watch it now?


Youku also recently announced a deal with Disney to stream 5 seasons of Desperate
Housewives (article here). This purely “political” will further please Hollywood and
government regulators but spells disaster for investors. No one seriously thinks Chinese
viewers will pay for content and there is little belief that, at the end of the day, the revenue
from ads and the tiny fee for a la carte video or subscription services can offset the
massive cost of content that Youku admits is doubling each year! It is common knowledge
in China that if one video website takes infringing videos down due to an IPO or
government pressure, consumers immediately switch to smaller websites willing to stream
them for free.


What the “wangba” (internet café in Chinese) user demands will be supplied! It took me
only a few seconds to find exactly what I wanted (US TV shows, movies etc.) on other
lesser-known websites such as ppstream.com, 56.com, zoltv.com etc. The fact remains,
the Chinese will not pay for content that can easily be found elsewhere, not to mention
that if it can’t be found streaming online, Chinese will simply revert back to their failsafe:
BitTorrenting or just buying it from a DVD hawker on the street! The majority of Chinese
internet users are living in tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and don’t have much else in the form of
entertainment except to go to the internet café. None of them are going to pay 5 RMB
($0.75) to watch a movie on top of having to pay to use the internet café. It simply is
beyond their budget, especially since it was free before and continues to be free from any
number of competing sites. In a country where rampant inflation of food prices is already
biting deeply into the average person’s disposable income, there is little chance that 5
RMB will be spent on a movie that was once free.
