Summary: OPKO Health, Inc. (OPK)
The President of OPKO’s key BioReference division (82.8% of 2016 revenue) resigned, and


no new successor was named. We believe this to be a strong negative omen.


A recent lawsuit �led against BioReference alleges violations of law, including forgery,


releasing unveri�ed test results, and falsi�cation of employee training and competency


documents.


A pattern of lawsuits emerges naming BioReference in four New York insurance fraud


cases.


OPKO’s recently FDA approved Varubi (licensed to TESARO) recently updated its risk


factors to include major side e�ects, potentially inhibiting yet another cash �ow stream.


With tangible book value of only about $10.5 million (i.e.: 2 cents per share) and with very


few bright spots to point to, we see signi�cant further downside for OPKO.

OPKO Health: New Signs Of Chaos In Key
Diagnostics Division

(NYSEMKT:OPK) diagnostics business, which primarily consists of BioReference Laboratories


(“BioReference”).


In particular, we identi�ed:


A slew of undisclosed or thinly disclosed executive team departures, including several


individuals that had checkered histories.


A seeming new shift toward compliance in the form of both the above executive “house


cleaning” and the recent hiring of a chief legal and compliance o�cer.


A Southern District of New York (SDNY) False Claims Act probe that represents a looming


and ongoing regulatory uncertainty.


Deteriorating revenue on both a Q/Q and Y/Y basis and the further potential for


deterioration, given the believed clampdown on non-compliant business practices.


Since that article, we have come across new signs that BioReference is still in the midst of a


major clean-up, and that the issues may be more severe than we had originally thought. New


information has come to light in the form of a key resignation and several lawsuits naming


BioReference as defendant or co-defendant.


Note that diagnostics accounted for approximately 82.8% of OPKO’s 2016 annual revenue.


Given the lack of major expected near-term pipeline updates and the sluggish roll-out of


OPKO’s signature Rayaldee drug to date, we believe BioReference’s performance will be a key


factor in the upcoming earnings release.


President of BioReference Resigns, Again


On January 26  OPKO announced (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?


ReleaseID=1055419) that BioReference President Gregory Henderson had resigned. We believe


the resignation was unexpected as Henderson had no comment in the press release, and no


successor was announced. A check of the current BioReference executive team website


(http://www.bioreference.com/executive-team/) as of this writing shows no President is


currently listed.


Henderson had been appointed only in March 2016


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160315005608/en/OPKO-Health-Names-Dr.-


Gregory-Henderson-President) to replace the BioReference founder Marc Grodman who had


also resigned without making any public comment. In our experience, key leaders typically do

not suddenly resign with scant detail when things are going well. We believe Henderson’s


resignation is a signal that this reporting period will show further deterioration in BioReference,


as we had anticipated in our previous report.


Allegations of Severe Impropriety Emerge
Relating to a BioReference Houston Laboratory


We recently learned of an employee anti-retaliation lawsuit �led in New Jersey in August 2017


that alleges severe improprieties relating to a BioReference Houston laboratory. To read the


full complaint, see Stephanie Halliday vs. BioReference Laboratories Inc


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/halliday-v-bio-reference)., [2:17-cv-6889]. We


believe the entire complaint is worth reading, but below are several key sections:


In 2016 and 2017, BioReference was operating its laboratories in violation of federal


health and safety statutes and regulations, including the Clinical Laboratory


Improvements Act of 1988 (“CLIA”) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of


1970. Stephanie Halliday—a BioReference employee—objected to, refused to


participate in, and disclosed these violations of law, public policy, and patient care. In


retaliation for this protected activity, BioReference terminated Ms. Halliday’s


employment on May 11, 2017.


…In July, 2016 BioReference hired Ms. Halliday as its Night Supervisor in one of its


Houston, Texas laboratories. Almost immediately after she started working for


BioReference, Ms. Halliday discovered that BioReference was violating federal law


governing the operations of its laboratories.


Speci�cally, Ms. Halliday discovered that BioReference had been releasing patient test


results to doctors in the period January, 2016 through June, 2016 despite the fact that


BioReference’s testing procedures/practices failed quality controls.


Ms. Halliday also discovered that a BioReference internal quality control inspection of


its Houston clinical laboratory conducted from April 25, 2016 through April 28, 2016


found the laboratory had serially violated federal law, including federal regulations


governing exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including Hepatitis B and HIV (29 C.F.R.


1910.1030); and federal regulations governing exposure to toxic and hazardous


substances.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The lawsuit continued by describing Ms. Halliday’s objections that she had outlined to a


supervisor:


…One of the practices that Ms. Halliday objected to in her September 9, 2016 email to


Ms. Russo [a supervisor] was BioReference’s release to a doctor of unveri�ed test


results on September 8, 2106. BioReference’s release of the unveri�ed test results led


to the hospitalization of the doctor’s patient. BioReference attempted to cover-up the


fact that it had not properly veri�ed the test results by claiming that this was simply a


“manual” data entry problem, when it was a failure of veri�cation. Ms. Halliday


subsequently exposed, objected to, and refused to participate in this illegal cover-up.


The complaint continues by detailing the exchanges back and forth between Ms. Halliday and


BioReference supervisors and ultimately with senior executives of the division. The complaint


includes allegations of:


Attempted intimidation.


Attempts by BioReference employees to get Ms. Halliday to fraudulently certify false


documents or to approve backdated documents.


Forgery by a BioReference employee of laboratory system monthly evaluation


documents.


Allowing laboratory technicians to perform tests without the necessary training or


competency.


Falsi�cation of employee training and competency documents in order to pass an


upcoming regulatory inspection.


The �ring of Ms. Halliday in order to silence her in advance of the upcoming inspection.


We have emailed OPKO’s investor relations seeking comment on the bulleted allegations


above. We have not heard back as of this writing, but should we hear back, we will update this


accordingly.


Note that none of the allegations have been proven in court. We intend to keep an eye on the


case to see how it progresses.


A Pattern of Lawsuits Emerges Naming
BioReference in New York Insurance Fraud
Cases


Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
A litigation review also turned up four lawsuits naming BioReference as co-defendant in


relation to alleged auto insurance fraud schemes. The lawsuits largely allege that individuals


were involved in sham auto accidents in New York and then fraudulently billed insurance


companies for services that were either medically unnecessary or were never performed.


Multiple medical institutions were named as co-defendants in these lawsuits, often with the


same institutions overlapping across the complaints.


Note that of the four lawsuits we found, the matters are believed to have either been settled or


are ongoing, and therefore have not been proven:


1. In a May 2016 case (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/kemper-vs-


bioreference-5-2016) �led by Kemper Independence Insurance, the complaint details how


a single car was involved in four separate low-impact crashes in New York. In each crash,


the airbags never deployed, and in all cases, the drivers and passengers either reported


no or minimal physical injuries at the scene. Each time the car was involved in a crash, it


had di�erent passengers, which allowed each passenger to individually bill for medical


services. The complaint named BioReference as one among several Medical Provider


Defendants.


2. In an August 2017 case (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/ace-vs-


bioreference-82017) �led by Ace American Insurance Company, the complaint details an


accident that the police report indicated was “a minor sideswipe, the airbags did not


deploy on either vehicle, and that no occupant of either vehicle reported any injuries at


the scene and none were visibly injured.” Later, the claimants reported to have sustained


serious bodily injuries in the collision. The claim’s legitimacy was questioned for, among


other reasons: (i) the insured vehicle was rented just hours prior to the crash (ii) there


were 9 people in the vehicle (iii) damage was minimal (iv) no injuries were reported or


visible at the scene and (iv) “the claimants were treated heavily and received boilerplate


and mirror treatment from the same group of medical providers.”


Two other cases, one �led by American Transit in 2016


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/american-transit-vs-bioreference-32016) and


the other �led by Hertz in 2012 (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/hertz-vs-


bioreference-1-12) provide fewer details but allege false insurance claims in a similar manner.


We have emailed OPKO’s investor relations seeking comment on BioReference’s alleged role in


the above insurance fraud claims. We have not heard back as of this writing, but should we


hear back, we will update this accordingly.

We do not believe these cases will have a meaningful impact on BioReference’s �nancials.


However, in light of the other recent and historical issues with BioReference, we will be


monitoring these as well to see if the pattern of lawsuits continue.


Problems with Recently FDA-Approved Varubi
Could Put Further Pressure on Cash Flow


Aside from performance and compliance questions relating to BioReference, we learned


recently that another of OPKO’s potential cash �ow streams is now under threat.


One of the few bright spots for OPKO shareholders from late 2017 was the FDA approval of


Varubi IV, a drug designed to aid in the treatment of delayed nausea and vomiting in


chemotherapy patients. OPKO had licensed the formulation for Varubi to TESARO Inc.


(NASDAQ:TSRO (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSRO)) in 2010 in exchange for milestone


payments of up to $85 million and “tiered double-digit royalties”. On October 26, 2017,


OPKO announced the FDA approval (http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?


ReleaseID=1045606) of the formulation which was then targeted for launch in November.


The positive news was quickly diminished when on January 12 , TESARO announced


(http://ir.tesarobio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesaro-announces-updates-us-


prescribing-information-varubir) that it had updated the labeling of the newly-approved Varubi


formulation to include the potential for severe side e�ects:


Anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and other serious hypersensitivity reactions have


been reported in the postmarketing setting, some requiring hospitalization. These


reactions have occurred during or soon after the infusion of VARUBI injectable


emulsion. Most reactions have occurred within the �rst few minutes of administration.


In the aftermath of the announcement, a class action lawsuit (https://kehoelaw�rm.com/active-


investigations/tesaro-class-action-lawsuit) was �led against TESARO. The future of the drug and


its sales potential remains in doubt. With very little positive news coming out of OPKO, this


update on Varubi represents yet another cash �ow opportunity that appears to be slipping


away.


Phil Frost Resumes His Insider Purchases

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In other news, OPKO Chairman and CEO Phil Frost has resumed his longstanding practice of


making open market purchases after having temporarily paused his purchases near the end of


September 2017. Dr. Frost restarted (https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?


action=getcompany&CIK=0000898860) his purchases on January 22


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/898860/000120919118004822/xslF345X03/doc4.xml


), which rather serendipitously coincided with the same week that the company announced the


resignation of the BioReference President.


As we noted in our earlier report, Frost has been making open-market purchases in OPKO for


over 10 years


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/898860/000114420407042162/xslF345X02/v084217_


ex.xml). His purchases have been a poor prognosticator of stock performance to date. Our


belief in November remains the same now: “With very few positive signs to point to at the


company, Frost is simply attempting to protect the stock via token insider purchases in the


hopes of buying more time.”


Our Predictions for the Upcoming Earnings
Release


We believe we will see signs of further deterioration in BioReference and will see a worsening


cash �ow situation at the company overall. We expect this to put further pressure on credit


lines. While Rayaldee is likely to have a large percentage increase in sales, we will be looking at


the “absolute” dollar number, given that Rayaldee sales are still coming o� of a low base.


In our previous report, we noted that the company announced


(http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1047471) the submission of a device


application for its Claros device the very day before earnings were released. We viewed it as a


suspicious move, given that the Claros device �ling had been delayed for �ve years to that


point. The announcement by the company seemingly assumed that the Claros device would be


approved and underscored the large market opportunity addressed by the device, whereas we


believed (and still believe) its actual chances of approval are slim. At the time, the


announcement struck us as a red �ag that may have been intended to “blunt” the impact of


negative earnings.


We mention this because we will similarly be on the lookout for other announcements that


could “blunt” the impact of potentially negative earnings. This could take the form of


announcing the re-submission of the hGH-CTP drug (which we previously identi�ed major

irregularities with) or the featuring of a “brand-new” formulation with bold new expectations


about massive market potential with little tangible data or results to support it.


In short, we are going into this call on the lookout for potential spin. When looking at OPKO’s


history, we see a large graveyard of loud promises that ended up dying quietly. We will be


focusing instead on the tangible numbers and actual results. Best of luck to all.
