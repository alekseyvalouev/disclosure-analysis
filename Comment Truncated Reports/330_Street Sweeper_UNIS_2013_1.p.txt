Unilife Corporation (UNIS): Top 10 Reasons


by Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter - 12/4/2013 9:42:10 AM





While Unilife Corpora�on (NasdaqGM:UNIS) is flying, TheStreetSweeper lists the Top 10 reasons
we’re bearish and short this over-hyped safety syringe company.





1. Novar�s deal does not guarantee an ongoing revenue stream. The UNIS syringes will be used in a
clinical trial, requiring few syringes. If Novar�s enrolled 500 pa�ents in the trial and injected each
monthly using UNIS syringes, UNIS could look forward to only about $5,400 in revenue over a year.
No wonder the UNIS press release doesn’t give financial details. It could easily take Novar�s 3 to 5
years or more to complete clinical trials and get Food and Drug Administra�on approval before it
would need to order any substan�al number of syringes.
 


2. Even if the Novar�s clinical trials pass with flying colors and get FDA approval, the company could
easily decide to order syringes instead from safety syringe gorilla Becton Dickinson, controlling an
es�mated 70 percent of the syringe market. Besides, a whistle-blower lawsuit suggests UNIS lacks the
protocol and safety procedures to pull off produc�on of what sounds to be a more complicated
syringe for Novar�s.





3. Big announcements, bigger disappointments. Investors shouldn’t read into UNIS press releases
that upcoming large revenue streams will necessarily occur. The press releases tend to list minimum
volume purchases of UNIS syringes. These minimums are only to preserve exclusivity. No one is
obligated to buy a certain volume.





4. UNIS CEO Alan Shortall has a goal of about a dozen contracts by year’s end. So far, five have been
announced, including the Novar�s deal and a Sanofi deal that are re-warmed old contracts. Is the
company likely to average almost two contracts a week for the rest of the year? Highly unlikely.
 


5. Of the announced deals, three involve significant pharmaceu�cal companies – yet the press
releases frequently men�on contracts worth $5 million upfront ini�ally plus milestone payments and
“expected” revenue and other wishy-washy terms. Before investors hit the “buy” func�on, they
should know what the company’s milestone payments are based on, what the volume produc�on
would be and when, plus the length of the ramp-up period. Investors need substance, not hype.





6. Mr. Shortall has a colorful background. We’re wondering who seed investor Roger Williamson
really is and whether he actually exists.  An Australian Supreme Court judge concluded the
rela�onship contained “many unusual and unexplained features.” This figure emerged in a lawsuit –
see the link here - brought by Mr. Shortall’s former girlfriend who claimed he failed to turn over UNIS
shares he  promised in return for loans she made to him. She was awarded $548,452 plus court costs.





7. Even with the announced deals, it’s not clear that UNIS has enough cash to last through the fiscal
year ending in June, without raising more money in offerings. UNIS could use the recent spike to sell
shares under their ATM (At the Market) agreement that allows shares to be sold at the drop of a hat.
UNIS is burning through about $10 million per quarter and relied on selling stock or allowing
employees to exercise op�ons to the tune of $12.9 million last quarter – which gave UNIS $7.4 million
cash on hand. Incidentally, independent auditors in October penned a going-down-in-flames note.

The note warns investors that “the Company has incurred recurring losses from opera�ons and has
limited cash resources, which raise substan�al doubt about its ability to con�nue as a going concern.”





8. Much to suggest Mr. Shortall tends to over-hype to make the company look be�er. He masterfully
turned a recent poor financial report into a cheerleading session by saying, “I am pleased to have
turned the corner. We are now entering a period of hyper-growth.” Given this history, can UNIS really
produce hundreds of millions of prefilled safety syringes at a profit? The company has never done
that.
 


9. Legal issues abound. Law firms are circling UNIS, filing or inves�ga�ng class ac�on complaints
against the company and/or certain officers and directors. Misrepresenta�on, corporate waste and
mismanagement are among the issues alleged or under inves�ga�on. Several are based primarily on
accusa�ons laid out in a securi�es fraud lawsuit filed by former supply chain vice president Talbot
Smith, and the Forbes ar�cle “How is a $329 million syringe company s�ll unprofitable a�er 11
years?”





10. Whistleblower Smith’s lawsuit alleges UNIS had employees pretend they were churning out
syringes for investors and other visitors, when they were not. UNIS and Mr. Shortall deny such
shenanigans occurred but we have spoken with employees who have dates and other details on
these “Potemkin villages.”





    Also, Mr. Smith charges that UNIS violated clean room and other FDA-related manufacturing
procedural rules. UNIS denies the allega�ons. But we can’t help but wonder whether UNIS takes
adequate safety precau�ons and why have they had such a massive turnover in their R&D staff.
 


   Mr. Smith also filed a complaint with the UNIS board alleging Mr. Shortall directed employees to
break into a terminated employee’s car and take his laptop. We have the police report – available
here - showing this the� occurred.





* Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short posi�on in UNIS and stand to profit on any future
declines in the stock price.
