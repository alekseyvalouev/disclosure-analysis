Ebix: Digging Through Piles Of Old Dirt

Summary


Ebix should have never bragged about making tremendous progress in the crucial
areas of employee retention and corporate transparency.


In recent months, the company’s own CFO has openly shared his desire to start
working at a firm with “strong corporate governance and ethical values,” if he can.


With Ebix on a tear earlier this year, the CFO and the longtime executives who
oversee the firm’s mysterious foreign subsidiaries all slashed their stakes in the
company, too.


That insider-selling spree followed welcome news of a long-awaited IRS settlement
that prompted the company’s sole analyst to arrive at a reassuring conclusion that
seems like a stretch.


Ebix still needs to resolve both an SEC and a DOJ probe, likely triggered by some
transactions that the company could soon find itself pressured to explain.


After taking investors on a roller-coaster ride that has often resembled a slow-motion train
wreck, Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) better get ready to endure a rather punishing experience of
its own. Since Ebix seems unwilling or unable to answer some pretty important questions,
the company needs to go back and retrace its steps - while reconstructing a number of
transactions that it would likely prefer to forget - by taking a painful trip down memory lane.


Ebix can only blame itself for its difficult itinerary. The company should have resisted the
urge to establish so many weird foreign subsidiaries in the first place. With its deepest
secrets buried for years in "tax-friendly" countries halfway around the world, Ebix needs to
cover an awful lot of ground - stopping in places like India and Singapore to dig through
piles of old dirt for the hidden truth - if the company even hopes to come clean.


Just look at the first page of ugly reminders that Ebix can expect to confront on its
unwelcome journey through the past.


December 2008: After running off a string of independent auditors - each one less
respectable than the last - Ebix finally settles on Cherry Bekaert, a Virginia-based CPA
firm that looks much better suited to serve the private businesses (and the occasional

penny-stock company) that normally tend to knock on its door instead. Within months of
retaining that relatively unknown (and seemingly underqualified) auditing firm, Ebix will
arrange a complicated transaction that leaves its Singapore subsidiary on the hook for a
suspicious related-party loan and - long before that gigantic liability ever surfaces - go on
to secure a clean opinion on its consolidated financial statements at the end of the year.
Even as Ebix swells into a larger rollup company, it will continue to stick with that obscure
auditing firm - later criticized by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(PCAOB) for its sloppy work -- and never shop for another outside auditor again.


January 2009: Ebix Singapore incorporates a new wholly owned subsidiary, known as
Ebix Software Asia SEZ, and injects a modest $780,000 worth of cash into that new
business operation. After boosting that investment by just $438,000 to less than $1.2
million four months later, Ebix Singapore will sell Asia SEZ to an Indian subsidiary for
more than $66 million (in Singapore currency) - miraculously booking a gigantic $64.8
million gain in the process - barely two years down the road.


April 1, 2009: Ebix suddenly assigns Graham Prior, a loyal veteran who presides over the
company's international division, to serve alongside the CEO on the board of its Singapore
subsidiary just six months before that foreign entity winds up with a suspicious related-
party loan on its books.


Oct. 1, 2009: Following a series of mysterious transactions that Ebix has still yet to fully
explain, the company's Singapore subsidiary emerges with a gigantic high-interest loan
sitting on its balance sheet. The subsidiary borrowed $81.58 million (in Singapore
currency) from an unidentified related party - agreeing to pay a steep 9% interest rate - so
that it could supposedly purchase intangible assets that its Australian subsidiary had
valued at roughly half of that amount just one day earlier.


Year-end 2009: Just a few months after Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Limited transfers its
Telstra assets and liabilities to Singapore, the subsidiary closes the books on the first of
two consecutive annual reports that will lead to restatements on down the road. When
Ebix Australia restates its numbers, BDO will immediately resign from its post and end its
tenure as the subsidiary's longtime auditing firm.


Jan. 28, 2010: With its Singapore subsidiary now on the hook for a gigantic related-party
loan, Ebix rushes to brag about the "strong growth in cash flows" that the company
enjoyed during the final quarter of the previous year. Armed with almost $20 million in

cash even after spending $34.6 million on a pair of acquisitions and a new building in India
over the course of the past few months, Ebix announces that it plans to start buying back
company stock under a previously approved share-repurchase plan again.


At this point, Ebix might need an awful lot of help finding all of the dirt that it has managed
to sweep under the rug. The company can probably forget about receiving much
assistance from at least one high-ranking member of its search party, though. As it turns
out, the company's veteran chief financial officer has already spent much of the summer
conducting his own version of a high-stakes treasure hunt.


While he recently tried to go back and cover up his tracks by revising his LinkedIn bio,
Ebix CFO Robert Kerris spent almost two months (and possibly even longer) boldly
presenting himself to the world as an eager job candidate ready to end his "challenging"
tenure at the embattled rollup company and start over - in his 60s -- at "a financially sound
enterprise with strong corporate governance and ethical values" instead.


Poor guy. After taking so many risks for so little company stock in return - a big chunk of it
now gone following a pair of relatively modest sales in March and June of this year --
Kerris almost deserves to feel a little shortchanged. The two lower-ranking officers

entrusted by Ebix to oversee its mysterious foreign subsidiaries certainly have a bunch of
stock left to sell, even after they scored a combined $1.5 million by slashing their own
stakes in the embattled rollup company. Meanwhile, Kerris stuck his neck out for years --
dutifully validating numbers without access to audited foreign results that held some pretty
nasty surprises -- before he ever started making a scene.


Maybe Ebix finally decided to start paying attention to its neglected CFO for a change.
With his LinkedIn bio now as mundane as the carefully prepared script that he normally
follows during the company's quarterly conference calls, Kerris has apparently decided to
treat the entire ordeal as a total misunderstanding. "I'm not looking for another job," Kerris
insisted last Thursday, when contacted on his cell phone during work hours right after a
call to his office line went unanswered. "I don't know where you got that from. I'm not
looking at all."


Ebix must (or at least should) have known that it could not afford to risk the sort of high-
level executive departure that can send the shareholders of even stable companies into
an immediate panic. Instead of making an obvious effort to avert a potential crisis,
however, Ebix initially seemed determined to respond by trying to bury its head buried in
the said. With its stock down 20% from the all-time high that it reached at the end of May -
- just before unsettling rumors about the CFO's possible exit first started to spread -- Ebix
probably wishes that it had opened its eyes (and realized that others would naturally do
the same) a long time ago.


Let's teach Ebix a lesson that will essentially force the company to wake up and deal with
reality. The firm sort of promised to get its act together, anyway. If Ebix really wants to "get
any unknowns removed from the business expeditiously," as its CEO insisted back in
November of last year, the company needs to stop keeping so many secrets and start
doing its part to help clear the air.


After all, as Ebix must surely know, the company itself holds the missing clues to some of
its most nagging mysteries. Unless Ebix wants to risky looking even guiltier, the company
should do itself a big favor -- capable of sending its stock on a powerful tear -- by
complying with the simple requests listed below and making sure that, this time, it takes
no shortcuts or detours away from the truth.


1) Explain how and why the company wound up on the hook for a $20.5 million tax bill that
its sole analyst has blamed on some kind of innocent mistake related to a single
acquisition deal. The company agreed to pay Uncle Sam a whole lot more than it could

have possibly owed for back taxes on the profits generated by even the most prominent
business that it acquired during the IRS audit period.


2) Provide an update on the status of the two other government investigations that the
company still needs to resolve. After making a clear effort to reassure investors during
previous conference calls, when the CEO insisted that neither the SEC nor the DOJ had
bothered the company for a while, the firm has remained curiously silent about that touchy
subject since November of last year.


3) Try to come up with a decent excuse for some of the offshore transactions recorded by
the company's mysterious foreign subsidiaries to date. At the very least, management
needs to set the record straight about a notorious related-party loan that has fueled
suspicions about the company - and kept skeptical investors placing serious bets against
its volatile stock - for the past two-and-a-half years.


When Ebix announced that it had negotiated a welcome settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service earlier this year, the company never bothered to mention the actual
reason why the firm had landed in trouble with the tax authorities in the first place. With
Ebix keeping most of the juicy details to itself - initially withholding even the price tag
attached to that $20.5 million settlement -- Craig Hallum analyst Jeff Van Rhea (a loyal bull
who provides the only research coverage available on the company) tried to fill in the
blanks and came up with an explanation that looks overly optimistic, if not totally
farfetched.


Granted, the analyst relied on some pretty vague clues: a ballpark estimate of the total
IRS bill owed by the company; the (rather surprising) claim by management that the
company had escaped without any sort of penalties; and a bare-bones description by the
company that identified "non-recurring issues related to certain acquisitions occurring
during the audit period" (from 2008 to 2012) as the culprit of its underlying tax problem.
Based upon those stingy details, Van Rhea somehow managed to blame the entire
settlement on a disputable bill for taxes on profits generated by a single acquisition target
and declare the whole mess an honest mistake.


The most noteworthy of the firms that Ebix purchased during the IRS period hardly seems
capable of running up such a hefty bill for overdue taxes, though. A prominent Australian
insurance exchange purchased by Ebix for $43.8 million in early 2008, Telstra e-Business
Services had previously generated a combined total of $11.5 million in actual profits --
after deducting less than $700,000 to cover its income tax expense -- during its final two
years as a stand-alone company. Although Ebix took some curious steps that made the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3393825-ebix-digging-through-piles-of-old-dirt 6/19


performance of that business difficult to track for a while, with its Telstra subsidiary (Ebix
Exchange) never filing any financial statements of its own and its primary Australian
subsidiary waiting years to consolidate those numbers - in a formal restatement issued
just before its longtime auditor threw in the towel - the company has by now disclosed
enough details to clearly establish that Telstra earned a mere fraction of the profits
required to trigger a $20 million U.S. tax liability.


Since Ebix obviously knows why it paid the IRS all of that money, the company should do
the right thing right now by setting the record straight.


Once Ebix marks that chore off of its list, the company might as well take the next logical
step. It owes investors a long-overdue update on the regulatory and criminal investigations
that have by now haunted the company for years.


The last time that Ebix actually dared to raise that touchy subject on its own - almost a full
year ago - its CEO sounded so reassuring that investors may have easily jumped to the
conclusion that both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department
of Justice had somehow lost interest in the controversial company. During a quarterly
conference call last August, Ebix proudly declared that neither one of those powerful
agencies had bothered the company since sometime the previous year. After basically
sticking with its story (when asked for an update) during the conference call that it hosted
a few months later, however, Ebix suddenly dropped the subject - never mentioning those
pesky government investigations in the two quarterly conference calls that followed - and
has continued to maintain its uncomfortable silence ever since.


With yet another conference call rapidly approaching, Ebix should make up for lost time by
not only disclosing any further contact from either the SEC or the DOJ but also providing
some kind of color about the actual focus of those government inquiries for a welcome
change. On the one memorable occasion when Ebix strayed beyond vague generalities -
prompted by a triple-sourced Bloomberg report indicating that the DOJ suspected the firm
of engaging in illegal money laundering - the company adopted such a defensive tone that
some investors may have jumped to conclusions and started fearing the worst.


Ebix already looked pretty guilty at that point, anyway. In early 2013, six months before
Bloomberg published its damaging report, Ebix had found itself struggling to explain a
mysterious - and enormous - related-party loan that the company had by then managed to
conceal for years. When Ebix CEO Robin Raina tried to soothe rattled investors - without

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3393825-ebix-digging-through-piles-of-old-dirt 7/19


identifying the source of that high-interest loan or providing a clear reason why it even
made sense - he only managed to further heighten suspicions about the company and its
mysterious foreign subsidiaries instead.


No wonder. Compare his brief excuse for that long-buried loan to the detailed list of
contradictions that follow.


"How did the (9% intercompany) loan move from Ebix Australia to Ebix Singapore?" Raina
asked at the time. "Ebix Singapore purchased certain assets and liabilities associated with
two acquisitions: namely, Heart Consulting and Telstra eBusiness from Ebix Australia. It
accordingly acquired both the IP assets and the loan liability of Ebix Australia in October
2009."


That scenario looks unlikely, however, given the following:


Ebix relied on cash that it raised by selling convertible debt and equity - not a related-
party loan - to fund the purchase of Telstra (by far the larger of those two acquisition
deals).
Both Ebix and its Singapore subsidiary identified the parent company - not its
Australian subsidiary - as the buyer of Telstra in their official regulatory filings.
While Ebix Australia seemed to contradict those disclosures by reporting that it
purchased Telstra's intangible assets instead, the subsidiary recorded no interest
expense the year after it borrowed the money to cover that big-ticket acquisition deal.
Although Ebix itself reported a big jump in revenue following the acquisition of Telstra -
a firm that had generated $14.6 million in revenue during its final year as a stand-alone
company - Ebix Australia reported very little change in its revenue at all.
The assets and liabilities that Ebix Australia supposedly transferred to Singapore
somehow exploded in size as soon as they changed hands. Ebix pegged the
combined value of its goodwill and intangible assets in Australia at $41.6 million the
day before that 2009 transaction occurred, but the company boosted the value of its
goodwill and intangible assets in Singapore by almost $60 million and left the
subsidiary with a far more onerous liability.
While Ebix Singapore supposedly inherited more than $80 million worth of intangible
assets along with that huge liability, the parent company itself reported less than $50
million worth of intangible assets on its entire balance sheet the quarter after that
mysterious transaction took place. Currency adjustments merely narrow the size of
that massive gap.
That huge liability, described by Ebix Singapore as a loan to cover intangible assets
purchased in October of 2009, continued to inexplicably balloon in size, even though
