ChinaCast Education (CAST) 
 


Based on the evidence in this report, we believe that ChinaCast Education Corporation (“CAST” or the 
“Company”) is falsifying its financial statements. We believe that the Company’s revenue and profit are 
materially overstated in its SEC filings.  
 
ChinaCast has long occupied a special place within the U.S.-listed Chinese smallcap universe. As fraud 
after fraud has been exposed within this sector, CAST has been upheld as the baby thrown out with the 
bathwater, the one shining beacon within a sea of scams.  
 
As such, we decided to conduct deep-level diligence on CAST, to determine whether the perceptions 
match reality. Our findings have led us to conclude that CAST is beset by a long list of red flags. Based 
on our evidence, we believe CAST has materially misrepresented itself in its SEC financial statements. 
We have shared our findings with senior partners at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and urge them to 
consider our evidence when conducting their audit for ChinaCast for the fiscal year 2011. We have also 
shared our report with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ stock exchange.  
 
We have divided this report into three parts.  
 
Part One addresses the local Chinese filings filed by the main operating subsidiary of the Company’s E-
Learning Group (“ELG”) segment. Photocopies of the SAIC annual inspection reports filed by this 
subsidiary show an ELG segment that generated revenue of less than half of what the Company 
reported in SEC filings. We provide copies of these Chinese filings, as well as English translations. We 
also provide signed attestations by CAST executives that these SAIC filings are true and accurate, and 
we believe these filings constitute evidence that CAST is defrauding regulators and investors.  
 
Part Two discusses evidence that funds were misappropriated during two of CAST’s college acquisitions. 
Chinese filings show that the prices reportedly paid by CAST were materially higher than prices received 
by the original sellers of the colleges. Part Three examines other red flags we found when conducting 
diligence on CAST, including multiple unnecessary equity capital raises, a prior bank transfer 
falsification, and the involvement of a central CAST executive in a questionable reverse-merger company 
in 2002.   
 
We urge Deloitte, NASDAQ and the Securities and Exchange Commission to review our report. In our 
opinion, CAST is providing false financial information to one set of regulators, given that SEC and SAIC 
financial statements diverge by a material disparity. We believe it is the American regulators and 
investing public that are being defrauded.

Summary of Red Flags  
 
1. SAIC Filings report that the ELG business is substantially smaller than what is claimed 
by CAST in SEC Filings 
 
We acquired the SAIC financial statements for ChinaCast Li Xiang Co., Ltd. (“CCLX”) and 
ChinaCast Technology (Shanghai) Ltd. (“CCT Shanghai”), which are the main operating 
subsidiaries that comprise the ELG segment. ELG accounted for 66% of the Company’s gross 
profit in 2010 and for 100% of the Company’s gross profit prior to CAST’s first brick-and-mortar 
college acquisition in 2008.   
 
According to SAIC filings, the subsidiary accounting for the ELG segment generated revenue of 
less than half of that reported in SEC filings from 2007 to 2009. In our report, we include 
photocopies of the annual inspection reports, as well as signed attestations by the subsidiaries’ 
legal representatives attesting that the information in the SAIC filings is valid and accurate.  
 
 
2. SAIC filings provide evidence that shareholder funds were misappropriated during the 
Company’s acquisition of a business college in 2008 
 
The Company announced in SEC filings that it acquired a business college in 2008 for RMB 480 
million. Yet Chinese filings show that CAST paid only RMB 165 million for the asset. We 
question what happened to the remaining RMB 315 million, and whether it was essentially 
stolen by insiders.  
 
On April 11, 2008, the Company acquired an 80% stake in the Foreign Trade & Business 
College of Chongqing Normal University (“FTBC Acquisition”). The Company reported in SEC 
filings that it paid RMB 480 million for the acquisition. However, SAIC filings show that CAST’s 
wholly owned subsidiary Yupei Training Information Technology Co., Ltd. paid only RMB 165 
million for the asset. When research firm OLP Global demonstrated this in a report, the 
Company responded that the remaining amounts were paid by CCT Shanghai. However, the 
2008 SAIC filings for CCT Shanghai demonstrate that no funds were paid by CCT Shanghai for 
the FTBC Acquisition, and that cash paid for acquisitions from CCT Shanghai was negligible in 
2008. When OLP explained this in a subsequent report, CAST did not reply. 
 
We came to the same conclusion as OLP after independently acquiring and reviewing the 
relevant source documents. 
 
 
3. Filings with Chinese securities regulators and the SAIC provide evidence that funds 
were misappropriated during the acquisition of another college in 2009 
 
CAST appears to have overpaid for its 2009 acquisition of Lijiang College by at least RMB 113 
million, based on information from SAIC filings as well as documents filed with Chinese 
securities regulators that are easily accessible on the internet. We question whether the RMB 
113 million was misappropriated during the acquisition.  
 
For the acquisition of Lijiang College of Guangxi Normal University in October 2009, ChinaCast 
disclosed in SEC filings that it would pay a total consideration of RMB 365 million, of which RMB 
295 million was paid in 2009 and the remaining contingent consideration would be paid in 2010.

But Shanghai Xijiu Information Technology Co. Ltd. (“Xijiu”), the entity from which CAST 
purchased Lijiang, had only paid RMB 182 million to acquire Lijiang several weeks earlier, 
according to Chinese filings. Furthermore, Xijiu was set up by a former CAST employee and its 
100% owner at the time of the acquisition was a farmer from Fujian province who did not 
graduate high school. It strikes us as unlikely that an under-educated farmer was the ultimate 
recipient of the proceeds from the acquisition of Lijiang College. The question emerges whether 
this acquisition was used to misappropriate funds during the acquisition of Lijiang College.  
 
What happened to the RMB 113 million difference between the price paid by CAST in 2009 and 
the price paid by Xijiu for Lijiang College? Who exactly is this farmer who happened to gain 
control of a British Virgin Islands-based entity that purchased a college in China and then flipped 
it for a quick RMB 113 million profit to ChinaCast, plus additional consideration in 2010? Did the 
RMB 113 million end up in his bank account, or in someone else’s? Why has CAST not publicly 
answered these questions with specific, transparent explanations? 
 
 
4. Unnecessary Capital Raises 
 
ChinaCast has raised capital from investors numerous times, and also amended its warrants in 
a way that effectively functioned as a capital raise. In each case, the Company had ample cash 
on its balance sheet prior to the capital raise, and in our opinion, there was no reasonable 
justification for raising capital. In multiple situations, capital was effectively raised at low 
valuations, diluting shareholders in what we believe would be an irrational manner if the 
Company’s SEC financial statements were accurate.  
 
 
5. Red Flags Associated with Historical Years 
 
Our examination of CAST’s SAIC filings and the backgrounds of key personnel revealed several 
additional red flags that we believe are worth mentioning, given the other evidence for fraud we 
cite elsewhere in the report.  
 
First, ChinaCast Co. Ltd. was previously censured by the Chinese government for falsifying 
bank documents. Prior to the Company’s IPO, management of ChinaCast Co. Ltd. was found to 
have fabricated bank transfer documents in order to deceive regulatory officials and pass 
certain capital verification requirements. A notice regarding the document falsification was filed 
with Chinese regulators.  
 
Second, a central CAST executive was previously the CEO of a U.S.-listed Chinese reverse 
merger bulletin board company in 2002-2003. That company announced the acquisition of 
certain Chinese media assets but never closed the full transaction, and its stock now trades at a 
negligible value.

Company Overview 
 
ChinaCast is a U.S.-listed Chinese provider of online education and training services, as well as 
the owner of three physical for-profit Chinese colleges. The Company first went public in 
Singapore and was subsequently acquired in December 2006 by Great Wall Acquisition 
Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company. It was upgraded from the Over-the-
Counter Bulletin Board to the NASDAQ stock exchange in October 2007. 
 
Prior to 2008, the Company primarily provided e-learning education services via its nationwide 
satellite broadband network. In 2008, the Company purchased its first of three for-profit physical 
colleges. Today, the Company’s operations are split into two segments: the E-Learning Group 
(“ELG”), which operates the online education business, and the Traditional University Group 
(“TUG”), which is comprised of the Company’s three physical for-profit colleges. The ELG 
segment contributed 66% of 2010 gross profit, while the TUG segment contributed 34%.

Given the material discrepancy between the Company’s SEC and SAIC filings for the ELG 
segment, we are highly skeptical that the financial figures reported to the SEC are accurate. 
 


Part 1: SAIC Filings Reveal Falsified Financials 


SAIC Filings Show That the ELG Business is Substantially Smaller 
than that Reported in SEC Filings 
 
The next thirteen pages of this report are focused on the SAIC filings for ChinaCast’s ELG 
segment. One of the unique aspects of ChinaCast is that the Company’s main ELG operating 
subsidiaries are based out of Shanghai and therefore file their SAIC filings with the Shanghai 
branch of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC” or “AIC”). The Shanghai 
AIC branch is one of the more open and accessible AIC branch offices based on our experience 
dealing with SAIC filings, and provides photocopies of the original filings to the public. Many 
other AIC branches, particularly rural offices, have only provided us data in electronic form, or 
do not allow filings to be photocopied. The Shanghai office, on the other hand, not only provides 
photocopies, but has also provided substantially more information to our local agents than 
certain other AIC branches. This additional information has included company bylaws, auditor

statements, lease contracts, board meeting minutes, changes in shareholders, capital infusions 
/ withdrawals, etc.  
 
Given the quality of documents provided by the Shanghai AIC branch, we can demonstrate in a 
clear, compelling manner that ChinaCast’s main ELG subsidiaries have reported financial 
figures to the Chinese government that are substantially lower than what the Company reports 
to the SEC. CAST’s SAIC filings show revenue for the ELG segment that is less than one-half of 
what has historically been reported to the SEC.  
 
We believe that our evidence demonstrates that CAST is defrauding one set of governments. 
CAST appears to be either providing false financial statements to the United States, in order to 
inflate the value of its stock price and raise capital from foreign investors, or providing false 
information to the Chinese government. In either scenario, CAST management would be 
committing fraud.  
 
We have long believed that when we see large discrepancies between SEC and SAIC filings, 
the accurate numbers are being reported to the Chinese government, while the inaccurate 
numbers are being reported to the U.S. government. We think there are potentially significant 
repercussions to Chinese executives who are defrauding their own government, and 
substantially less consequences for Chinese executives defrauding the U.S. government.  
 


ChinaCast Legal Organizational Structure  
 
First, let’s isolate the ChinaCast subsidiaries that generate ELG’s revenue and profit. Below is a 
legal organizational structure for ChinaCast from the 2010 10K.
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  575 Madison Avenue, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10022  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 7 





 
 
 
Most of the subsidiaries in the above chart are related to the TUG segment, which is the 
segment comprised of ChinaCast’s brick-and-mortar colleges. The ELG subsidiaries are the 
ones on the right side of the organizational chart. On the next page, we isolate the ELG 
subsidiaries.
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  575 Madison Avenue, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10022  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 8 





Below are the subsidiaries that are related to the ELG segment, isolated from the company-wide 
organizational chart above.  
 


 
 
We acquired the SAIC filings for each of these subsidiaries for the years that were available. We 
also acquired the SAIC filings for ChinaCast Co. Ltd. (“CCL”), whose “Beijing Branch” 
contributed management service fee revenue to CAST prior to 2010. We leave the discussion 
about CCL and its Beijing Branch until the end of this section, because it is not especially 
relevant to our discussion of how the SAIC financial statements for ELG show a materially 
smaller business than the one described in SEC filings. 
 
The main operating subsidiary of the Company’s ELG segment is CCLX. The subsidiaries QPU 
and DAEC were set up in 2010 and based on the minimal disclosures about them by the 
Company and the low price paid to acquire DAEC, we are confident that we can ignore them for 
the purposes of our analysis. For what it is worth, we have acquired the SAIC filings for QPU 
and DAEC, and they show negligible operations for the two subsidiaries.  


“DAEC” was acquired on December 24, 2010 
for a total cash consideration of RMB2m. We 
consider it not material to CAST’s financial 
results.     


“CCLX” is the main ELG operating subsidiary. 
The legal entity is owned by Chinese residents Li 
Wei, Jiang Xiangyuan and Zhang Liwen. Per its 
contract with CCT Shanghai, CCLX can be 
charged a monthly service fee equal to its total 
revenue less operating expenses reasonably 
incurred in the course of conducting business. 
This fee is payable to CCT Shanghai, owned by 
CAST. 


“CCT Shanghai” is a Wholly Foreign Owned 
Enterprise (WFOE) that does not have any 
operations outside of its contracts with CCLX. 
It is entitled to charge CCLX monthly service 
fees equal to the total revenue earned by CCLX 
less operating expenses reasonably incurred in 
the course of conducting the business.  


“QPU” was established on March 23, 2010, has 
been the subject of minimal discussion by 
management and we consider it not material to 
CAST’s financial results.
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  575 Madison Avenue, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10022  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 9 





 
Let’s next provide evidence that CCLX is the main operating entity for the ELG segment, using 
information provided in CAST’s SEC filings. ChinaCast alludes to CCLX being the main 
contributor to the ELG segment throughout its 10Ks, such as in the following disclosures from 
the 2010 10K: 
 


“Our revenue from e-Learning services comes primarily from service fees that are paid 
by customers or students and calculated as a percentage of the tuition revenue of 
CCLX.” (page 15, 10K 2010) 
 
“CEC provides its services and products to end users in the PRC through ChinaCast Li 
Xiang Co., Ltd. (CCLX) under the terms of a technical services agreement… Under the 
terms of the Technical Services Agreement, CCLX is obliged to pay ChinaCast, through 
its subsidiaries, a monthly service fee for the services rendered by CEC. The service fee 
is an amount equivalent to the total revenue earned by CCLX, less operating expenses 
reasonably incurred in the course of conducting the business for which CEC and its 
subsidiaries provide technical services.” (page 67, 10K 2010) 


 
Note in the above disclosure that “CEC” is ChinaCast Education Corporation, which is the 
Delaware-based public trading entity that shareholders own. 
 
Another way to recognize that CCLX holds the primary operations for the ELG segment is by 
recognizing that all other subsidiaries do not. Shanghai Rubao Information Technology Co., Ltd. 
(“Rubao”), Shanghai Xijiu Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Xijiu) and Yupei Training 
Information Technology Ltd. (“Yupei”) and their subsidiaries are all related to brick-and-mortar 
universities that contribute to the TUG segment, not ELG. ChinaCast (Beijing) Education 
Technology Limited (“CBET”) was set up only in 2010. As previously discussed, QPU and 
DAEC are not material to the financial results of the Company. That leaves us with three PRC-
based operating subsidiaries that could account for the ELG segment business: CCT Shanghai, 
CCL and CCLX.  
 
With CCT Shanghai, the Company discloses that the subsidiary has no material operations 
outside of its contract with CCLX. On page 11 of the 2010 10K, CAST explains that “CCT 
Shanghai does not perform any activities or have any operations outside the scope of these 
arrangements,” where the term “arrangements” refers to its contracts with CCLX and CCL. 
 
With CCL, ChinaCast clearly discloses that operations of CCL (or, more specifically, the Beijing 
Branch of CCL, which is referred to as CCLBJ) are not consolidated into CAST’s financial 
statements. Per this disclosure from the 2009 10K, CAST writes “CCL is not consolidated into 
CEC’s financial statements as CEC is not the primary beneficiary of CCL.” Rather, CCL’s 
income contribution to ChinaCast is embedded in a single line item on the income statement 
titled “Management Services Revenue” and this Management Services Revenue item is not 
consolidated into the ELG segment financial information. We discuss CCL more extensively 
later in this report.  
 
Once we remove CCT Shanghai and CCL as potential material operating subsidiaries for the 
ELG segment, the only contributing PRC subsidiary is CCLX.

CCLX SAIC Filings 
 
Next, we will provide and analyze the SAIC financial statements for CCLX. We have acquired 
SAIC filings and documents for CCLX, which we provide below. The documents include 
business license issuance notifications, notices of company name registrations, company 
bylaws, records of shareholder meetings, regulatory infractions, leases, and records of changes 
in registered capital and shareholders.

Of particular relevance to us are the 2008 and 2009 Annual Inspection Reports. Companies in 
China undergo annual inspections by their local branches of the Administration for Industry and 
Commerce. Included within these annual inspection reports are financial statements, as well as 
attestations by the companies’ legal representatives that the contents of the Annual Inspection 
Reports are accurate and valid.   
 
Below are links to photocopies of the 2008 and 2009 CCLX annual inspection reports, as well 
as English translations.

In these documents, we see full balance sheets and income statements for fiscal years 2007, 
2008 and 2009.  
 
Below is a table summarizing the revenue and profit reported by CCLX in 2007, 2008 and 2009 
(we use average annual exchange rates):  
 
CCLX Financial Summary from SAIC Filings


(USD$ in millions) 2007 2008 2009
Revenue $10.0 $13.6 $5.5
Income From Operations $4.9 $9.2 $4.6
Net Income $4.9 $8.8 $4.4  
 
As we can see here, CCLX reported USD $10m, $14m and $6m of revenue in each of 2007, 
2008 and 2009 in its SAIC filings to the Shanghai branch of the Administration for Industry and 
Commerce. In contrast, ChinaCast reported $25m, $29m and $29m for its ELG segment 
according to its SEC filings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.  
 
We can see that CCLX operates a profitable operation, according to SAIC filings, and posts 
revenue that is materially higher than other Chinese companies we have previously alleged to 
be fraudulent, such as China Education Alliance (CEU) and Advanced Battery Technologies 
(ABAT). Nevertheless, according to SAIC filings, ChinaCast’s ELG revenue is less than half of 
what it claims in SEC filings. According to 2009 SAIC financial statements, the CCLX annual 
revenue reported in China was less than one-fifth of the SEC revenue reported by ELG.

been previously described as “responsible for [ChinaCast’s] overall management, operations 
and strategic direction” (see here). Yin was the legal representative of CCLX prior to 2010.  
 


CCT Shanghai SAIC Filings 
 
In our discussion on ChinaCast’s legal organizational structure, we provided evidence to 
support our belief that CCLX accounts for the vast majority, if not virtually all, of the Company’s 
ELG segment operations. But to quell any criticism that we have not accounted for the 
operations of CCT Shanghai in the ELG segment financial information, we have also acquired 
SAIC filings for CCT Shanghai.

As we can see, the revenue and profit generated at CCT Shanghai from 2007 to 2009 is 
relatively small.  
 
Similar to CCLX, we also find attestations in the annual inspection reports acknowledging that 
the information provided in the CCT Shanghai AIC filings is accurate and valid. Below is the 
relevant section:

Confirmation that We Have the Correct SAIC Filings 
 
It would be useful to explain why we are confident that we have the correct SAIC filings for 
CCLX and CCT Shanghai. To most easily communicate this, we’ll look at an exhibit included in 
ChinaCast’s Form S-4A filed on August 14, 2006 with the SEC. In this S-4A, ChinaCast includes 
a variety of exhibits that show the signatures of key members of CAST’s management teams, 
as well as the seals of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The seals provided include those 
of CCLX and CCT Shanghai. At the end of “Exhibit 10.3: Technical Services Agreement By and 
Among Chinacast Technology (Shanghai) Limited, The CCLX Shareholders and ChinaCast Li 
Xiang Co., Ltd.,” we find a signature page that includes the seals of CCT Shanghai and CCLX.

Final Points on SAIC Filings 
 
We will mention two final points before examining other red flags exhibited by ChinaCast.  
 
First, we will add additional commentary regarding CCL.  
 
Prior to 2010, the publicly traded ChinaCast was affiliated with CCL, which was a legal entity 
that contributed revenue and profit to the Company via an E-learning business: the Beijing 
Branch of ChinaCast Company, Ltd. (“CCLBJ”). However, CCLBJ was never consolidated into 
CAST’s operations and its contribution to ChinaCast’s consolidated financial statements was 
merely in the form of a “Management Service Fee” that was paid to ChinaCast. See below 
(emphasis added):  
 
“CCH’s principal subsidiary, ChinaCast Technology (BVI) Limited (“CCT”), was founded in 1999 
to provide funding for its satellite broadband Internet services through the satellite operating 
entities ChinaCast Company Ltd — Beijing Branch (“CCLBJ”) and ChinaCast Li Xiang Co. Ltd. 
(“CCLX”). We account for our relationship with CCLX as an interest in a variable interest entity 



http://kerrisdalecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/CCL-August-2010-Name-Change.pdf

that is consolidated in our financial statements. We receive a management service fee from 
CCLBJ. CCLBJ is not consolidated in our financial statements.” (page 2, 10K 2009) 
 
CCLBJ’s financial contribution to CAST’s financial statements come only in the form of a 
“Management Service Fee” line item, as can be seen below:  








Note that despite the fact that neither CCL nor its Beijing Branch are consolidated within CAST’s 
financial statements, we nevertheless acquired the SAIC financial statements for CCL. Below 
are the relevant documents:  
 
CCL SAIC Filings and Annual Inspection Reports (Chinese) 
CCL SAIC Filings and Annual Inspection Reports (English Translation) 
 
CCL reported less than $2 million of revenue to the SAIC in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, 
based on its 2008 and 2009 annual inspection reports.  
 
Second, ChinaCast could be theoretically generating revenue and profit from non-PRC 
subsidiaries, such as ChinaCast Technology (HK) Limited (“CCT HK”), which is based out of 
Hong Kong. However, we do not believe this is the case and have not seen any evidence of 
this. CAST’s customers are based in China and its operations are based in China. It would be 
uncommon for a non-Chinese subsidiary to be generating material revenue and incurring 
material costs when the Company’s customers are China-based and its operational facilities are 
based out of China. We also don’t see any reason to have a Hong Kong or British Virgin Islands 
subsidiary to be accounting for a material part of the profit and loss for CAST, and management 
has never alluded to any reason why a foreign subsidiary would be responsible for a meaningful 
portion of the sales and costs for the Company.  
 
As an additional point, in Footnote 1 of the Company’s Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements in its 2010 annual report, CAST provides a brief note about the “Principal activity” 


Contribution 
from CCLBJ 



http://kerrisdalecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/CAST-Disclosure-About-CCL-Not-Consolidated.pdf

for each of its subsidiaries and VIEs. The principal activity for all non-PRC subsidiaries is 
“Investment holdings,” with the exception of ChinaCast Technology (BVI) Limited (“CCT BVI”) 
and ChinaCast Technology (HK) Limited (“CCT HK”). CCT BVI’s principal activity is “Acts as a 
technology enabler in the satellite communication” and CCT HK’s principal activity is “Acts as a 
liaison office for the Company’s operation”. In contrast, the principal activities of the Company’s 
PRC operational subsidiaries all refer to the “provision of” services and products. This acts as 
further evidence that the Company’s principal revenue-generating subsidiaries are domiciled in 
China.  
 
Finally, given that CCT Shanghai and CCLX, even if combined together, account for 
approximately half of the SEC-reported revenue for the ELG segment in 2007 and 2008, and a 
quarter of SEC-reported revenue for the ELG segment in 2009, we find it highly unlikely that the 
remaining half and three-quarters of revenue was accruing at CCT HK or CCT BVI.  
 


Do ELG’s Financials Appear “Too Good to be True”? 
 
Based on the SAIC filings, we do not believe that ChinaCast is accurately representing its ELG 
segment in its SEC financial statements. According to SAIC filings, the ELG segment appears to 
be substantially smaller than what is indicated by SEC filings.  
 
When faced with mismatching SAIC financial statements, we next examine whether the 
reported financials to the SEC appear “too good to be true”. Typically, when companies are 
fabricating their financial statements, they don’t make up dismal numbers. Rather, revenue and 
profit growth, as well as margins and return on capital, are often atypically high.  
 
In the bar charts below, we examine ELG revenue and gross profit since inception.

Gross Profit
 


 
While revenue has flattened in recent years, gross profit in the ELG segment has continued to 
grow. Gross profit has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 16% since 2005.  
 
When compared to some of the outlandish operational claims made by other U.S.-listed 
Chinese companies that we have alleged to be frauds, ChinaCast’s numbers are not quite as 
egregious. Yet in our opinion the numbers are still atypically strong. The Company’s return on 
invested capital in the year prior to its first TUG acquisition was north of 50%; in the year before 
that, the Company ostensibly had so much cash on its balance sheet and so few other assets 
that its ROIC metric implied that the company had generated such strong historical profitability 
that it had already recouped all its invested capital. To look at it another way, based on capex
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  575 Madison Avenue, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10022  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 18





figures from 2004 through 2007, the ELG business is not capital intensive, and therefore the 
Company has achieved revenue and profit growth in E-Learning without much capital 
investment. As to the argument that we should view investments in the ELG segment as coming 
through the SG&A line item as opposed to capital expenditures, we’ll note that while SG&A 
appears to be meaningful for the ELG segment, the Company was nevertheless generating 
EBITDA margins of 25% to 35% prior to its first TUG acquisition. In summary, CAST’s ELG 
business featured unusually high returns on capital regardless of how we approached the issue 
of capital investment.  
 
Altogether, in light of our concrete evidence that the Company’s Chinese filings show an ELG 
business that is materially smaller than SEC filings, the Company’s high profit growth and return 
on capital according to SEC filings is not surprising.  
 
We ask investors to consider the following questions. Is ChinaCast’s ELG business truly likely to 
be a 50%+ ROIC business? Is the provision of satellite technology to universities for the 
purpose of transmitting distance learning programming really an atypically robust business with 
profound competitive advantages (frankly, we question whether there is much demand for 
satellite technology for distance learning education to begin with, as opposed to broadband 
ethernet, but that’s a different issue altogether)? Or is CAST’s actual underlying ELG business 
likely subject to the same forces of capitalism that prevent most other companies from being 
able to generate unusually high amounts of profit relative to the amounts of capital they’ve 
devoted to their businesses? 
 


Part 2: Misappropriated Funds During College Acquisitions 
 
Beginning in 2008, ChinaCast launched an expansion into brick-and-mortar colleges and 
universities in an effort to broaden its asset base within the growing Chinese education sector. 
 
On April 11, 2008 and September 17, 2009, the Company acquired The Foreign Trade and 
Business College of Chongqing Normal University. On October 5, 2009, CAST acquired Lijiang 
College of Guangxi Normal University. On August 23, 2010, CAST acquired Hubei Industrial 
University Business College (HIUBC). These three brick-and-mortar universities comprise the 
Traditional University Group (“TUG”) segment of ChinaCast.  
 
Numerous red flags were highlighted about these acquisitions in a series of six research reports 
published by OLP Global LLC. As of our report’s publication date, these six reports can be 
found on the internet by typing the words “OLP global chinacast mailchimp” into Google.  
 
We were impressed by the depth of diligence conducted by OLP and recommend all parties 
interested in ChinaCast acquire and read these reports.

March 16, 2011 ChinaCast Education Corporation (CAST) – Red Flags in Acquisition #3 
March 17, 2011 ChinaCast Education (CAST) – 10K Reveals Material Weaknesses 
 
The Company responded to several of the red flags raised in the OLP reports.  
 
Their responses can be seen in the following SEC filings:  
 
CAST Form 8-K from February 16, 2011 
CAST Form 8-K from February 17, 2011 
CAST Form 8-K from February 22, 2011 
CAST Form 8-K from March 2, 2011 
 
Below we summarize certain arguments made by OLP in its research reports, as well as 
summarize the Company’s responses. We also discuss our views on the issues.  
 
Our conclusion is that the abundance of serious red flags with the Company’s university 
acquisitions gives us further reason to question management’s intentions. In our mind, the OLP 
allegations were damning. They provided evidence that the prices paid by CAST for certain 
colleges were materially higher than the prices that these colleges were sold for. They 
demonstrated that the legal entities that acted as intermediaries between CAST and the sellers 
were set up and organized by former CAST insiders. They provide evidence that the official 
recipients of CAST’s funds were a farmer with only junior high school educations and a small 
business operator who was unlikely to own such highly valued assets as for-profit colleges.  
 
We would particularly draw attention to the Company’s second acquisition, where it appears that 
there is a wide discrepancy between the amount CAST claimed to have paid for the acquisition 
and what the business’s original sellers received. The relevant public documents, including both 
SAIC filings as well as public documents filed with China’s securities regulators, show 
compelling evidence that certain middlemen pocketed tens of millions of dollars during the 
acquisition. It remains a question whether these middlemen were affiliated with CAST, or with 
the seller. Yet given that the second acquisition was structured in a very similar fashion to the 
Company’s other college purchases, and given the other red flags we found with CAST, we are 
concerned that improprieties may have been committed by individuals affiliated with the CAST 
management team.  
 


Allegations Regarding Foreign Trade and Business College of 
Chongqing Normal University  
 
On April 11, 2008, the Company acquired an 80% stake in the Foreign Trade & Business 
College of Chongqing Normal University (“FTBC” and the “FTBC Acquisition”). It did this through 
having its wholly owned subsidiary Yupei Training Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Yupei”) 
acquire 80% of Hai Lai Education Technology Limited (“Hai Lai”), which owned 100% of FTBC. 
The Company reported in SEC filings that it paid RMB 480 million to acquire the 80% stake in 
Hai Lai. Based on SAIC filings, however, Yupei only paid RMB 165 million to acquire its 80% 
stake in Hai Lai. OLP Global initially demonstrated this in its research note on February 16,

2011. OLP questioned the whereabouts of the remaining RMB 315 million that CAST claimed to 
have paid for the FTBC acquisition.  
 
To support its argument, OLP provided SAIC filings for Yupei Training Information Technology 
Co., Ltd., the Chinacast-owned entity that purchased Hai Lai. Yupei’s 2008 SAIC filings show 
only a RMB 165 million cash outflow in 2008, and furthermore specify in its footnotes that its 
investment cost in Hai Lai was only worth RMB 165 million.

Below is a copy of Yupei’s 2008 cash flow statement, which shows that the outflow subtotal for

Company Responses and Counter-Responses 
 
In an 8K filed on February 17, 2011 (click here), the Company responded by saying that the 
remaining RMB 315 million paid for Hai Lai was paid by CCT Shanghai. They wrote: 
 


“The total consideration of RMB 480 million to acquire 80% of Hai Lai was paid out not 
only by Yupei Training Information Technology Co., Ltd. (‘Yupei’), which paid RMB 
165 million, but also by ChinaCast Technology (Shanghai) Limited, which paid the 
remaining balance of RMB 315 million, in a separate transaction.” 


 
However, we have examined the 2008 SAIC filings for CCT Shanghai and see no cash outflow 
of RMB 315 million. The only line item in cash flow from investing activities relates to a RMB 
7,000 payment for capex, and there are no large cash outflows elsewhere in the cash flow 
statement that could be interpreted to indicate a purchase of an equity stake of another 
company. We have made the 2008 SAIC filings for CCT Shanghai available earlier in this 
report, and they can be found by clicking here (click here for English translation). OLP came to a 
similar conclusion, and published the same findings in a followup March 7 report.  
 
They wrote:  
 


“If CAST management were telling the truth in [the] 8K dated February 17, 2011, we 
would have found RMB 310.85 million (RMB 475.85 – RMB 165 million) paid out from 
CCT SH. Our findings show that CCT SH’s cash outflow from investing activities was 
only RMB 7,000 (seven thousand). The bottom line is that, contrary to 
management’s claim, there was no payment of RMB 315 million paid out from 
CCT SH in 2008. Our latest findings further convince us that 80% of Hai Lai was 
acquired for only RMB 165 million, ~1/3 of the price CAST claimed to have paid.” 


 
The Company never responded to OLP’s follow-up report.  
 
Below is the 2008 cash flow statement from CCT Shanghai.

Our Conclusion 
 
Our examination of the issue, as well as review of the original allegations and the Company’s 
response, leads us to support OLP on this issue. Our concern is quite simple. The Company 
claimed to pay RMB 480 million for an acquisition. Chinese filings show that CAST paid only 
RMB 165 million for the asset. The Company provided a response to the allegations, which 
were convincingly discredited by OLP. Since OLP’s last response, the Company has not 
clarified the issue.  
 
As a result, we, like OLP, question whether funds were misappropriated during the acquisition of 
the Foreign Trade and Business College of Chongqing Normal University in 2008.

Allegations Regarding Lijiang College 
 
CAST appears to have overpaid for Lijiang College by at least RMB 113 million, based on 
information from SAIC filings as well as documents filed with Chinese securities regulators that 
are easily accessible on the internet. We question whether the RMB 113 million was 
misappropriated during the acquisition.  
 
For the acquisition of Lijiang College of Guangxi Normal University in October 2009, ChinaCast 
has disclosed in SEC filings that it would pay a total consideration of up to RMB 365 million, of 
which RMB 295 million was paid in 2009 and the remaining consideration was paid in 2010. But 
Shanghai Xijiu Information Technology Co. Ltd. (“Xijiu”), the entity from which CAST purchased 
Lijiang, had only paid RMB 182 million to acquire Lijiang several weeks earlier. Furthermore, 
Xijiu was set up by a former CAST employee and its 100% owner at the time of the acquisition 
was a farmer from Fujian province who did not graduate from senior high school. It strikes us as 
unlikely that an under-educated farmer was the ultimate recipient of the proceeds from the 
acquisition of Lijiang College. The question emerges whether this acquisition was used to 
misappropriate funds during the acquisition of Lijiang College.  
 
To best understand the transaction, it is instructive to provide a schematic diagram.

This is a simplified diagram that illustrates OLP’s argument that CAST conspicuously overpaid 
for the acquisition of Lijiang College. As we can see, CAST paid RMB 295 million to Xie Jiqing, 
who was the owner of the BVI entity East Achieve Ltd., which itself was the owner of Xijiu. Xijiu 
was the entity that purchased Lijiang College from Wuhan Humanwell and Wuhan 
Hengjiantong.  
 
We hired investigators to conduct a background check on Mr. Xie Jiqing. Based on our 
investigator’s examination, Xie Jiqing is a farmer from Fujian province with no college education. 
Below is information on Xie.  
 


 
It is unclear how Xie came into the position of attaining the ownership of a BVI entity that 
indirectly owned and controlled Lijiang College. OLP also separately concluded that Xie is a 
farmer with no high school education, and this information on his background was not disputed 
by CAST.  
 
We will next note that Xijiu was set up by a former CAST-affiliated employee, Song Hongtao, in 
2005. Among other things, Song was a former director of CCL. The individual who filed Xijiu’s 
annual inspection reports both before and after the Lijiang College acquisition was Hu Xiaolei, 
who OLP alleges was a current employee of CAST at the time. We were not able to confirm this 
on our own, but note that CAST has not denied that Hu Xiaolei was a current CAST employee 
at the time of the Lijiang College acquisition.  
 
Next, there is a substantial paper trail documenting the amount that Xijiu paid to acquire the 
entity that controls Lijiang College. The sellers of the entity that controlled Lijiang College were 
Wuhan Humanwell Hi-Tech Industry Co., Ltd. (“Humanwell”), a publicly listed company on the 
Shanghai Stock Exchange with the ticker 600079, and Wuhan Hengjiantong, a private 
company. Wuhan Humanwell owned 66% of the entity that controlled Lijiang College while 
Wuhan Hengjiantong owned 34% of the entity that controlled Lijiang College.

Note that the entity that controlled Lijiang College was called China Lianhe Biotechnology Co., 
Ltd. (“Lianhe”). 
 
In the case of Wuhan Humanwell, we have multiple sources of evidence that show that Xijiu 
paid RMB 102 million to acquire the 66% stake. The transaction was done in a 2-step process. 
First, Xijiu bought Lianhe from Humanwell for RMB 155.1 million. Then Xijiu sold an equity stake 
in Tianfeng Securities Co Ltd., which China Lianhe had owned in addition to the college, back to 
Humanwell for RMB 53.4 million. Therefore, the net amount that Xijiu paid to Humanwell for 
Humanwell’s 66% stake in Lijiang College was RMB 102 million.  
 
The first piece of documentation showing this RMB 102 million transaction is the Notice of 
Significant Transactions filed with the Shanghai Stock Exchange by Wuhan Humanwell on 
September 11, 2009. That full document can be found here, and the English translation can be 
found here. In this document, Wuhan Humanwell clearly outlines the terms of the transaction 
with Xijiu. The document can be found independently on the internet by visiting the website of 
the Shanghai Stock Exchange at www.sse.com.cn. We have pasted the first page below.

On its first page, the Notice of Significant Transactions writes:  
 
Brief Introduction of the Transaction: The Company agrees to transfer 100% of its equity interest 
in China Lianhe Biotech Co., Ltd (“Lianhe”) to Shanghai Xijiu Information Technology Co., Ltd 
(“Xijiu”). The subject of transaction is a 66% equity interest in Lianhe, and the transaction price 
is initially set at RMB 155.1 million.  
 
Upon the completion of Lianhe equity ownership transaction, Wuhan Humanwell will acquire all 
the equity interest of Tianfeng Securities Co., Ltd (“Tianfeng”) held by Lianhe. The subject of 
transaction is 11.1% equity interest in Tianfeng and the transaction price is initially set at RMB 
53.35 million. 
 
Later, on the third page, the document specifies that “The major asset of Lianhe is its 
investment in Lijiang College of Guangxi Normal University (“LJC”) and Tianfeng Securities Co., 
Ltd (“Tianfeng”).” 
 
We want to emphasize the fact that this document was filed by a publicly-listed Chinese 
company to the Chinese securities regulators. The document is available electronically to any 
member of the public by simply visiting the Shanghai Stock Exchange website. The document 
shows that Humanwell effectively sold its 66% stake in Lijiang College for RMB 102 million. In 
contrast, CAST purchased its 100% stake in Lijiang College for RMB 295 million in 2009, plus 
additional consideration in 2010.  
 
The second document showing this RMB 102 million transaction is the Equity Ownership Sales 
and Transfer Agreement between Xijiu and Wuhan Humanwell that was filed by Xijiu to the 
Shanghai AIC office. Below we have pasted the two pages of the Equity Ownership Sales and 
Transfer Agreement between Xijiu and Wuhan Humanwell.

Next, let’s provide the documentation that shows how much Xijiu paid for Wuhan Hengjiantong. 
Similar to the previous case, Xijiu filed the Equity Ownership Sales and Transfer Agreement 
between Xijiu and Wuhan Hengjiantong with the Shanghai AIC.  
 
The Agreement below clearly says that Xijiu purchased Wuhan Hengjiantong’s 34% stake in 
Lianhe for RMB 79.9 million.

101.75 million to Wuhan Humanwell for a 66% stake in the holding entity of Lijiang College. 
Altogether, Xijiu paid RMB 181.65 million.  
 
Yet ChinaCast paid RMB 295 million to Xie Jiqing, the farmer from Fujian who owned Xijiu, in 
order to acquire Lijiang College for CAST’s public shareholders. Let’s not forget that Xijiu is an 
entity set up by a former CAST employee.  
 
What happened to the RMB 113 million difference between the price paid by CAST and the 
price paid by Xijiu for Lijiang College? Who exactly is this farmer who happened to gain control 
of a British Virgin Islands-based entity that purchased a college in China and then flipped it for a 
quick RMB 113 million profit to ChinaCast? Did the RMB 113 million end up in his bank account, 
or in someone else’s?  
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has a right to know.  
 
 
The Company’s Response 
 
When OLP made public these findings on February 28, the Company responded in an 8K 
issued on March 2, 2011 that is available here. They conspicuously did not address the specific 
allegations of OLP in a direct and straightforward manner. Rather they said that CAST 
employees did not benefit personally from the Company’s three university acquisitions and 
discussed the importance of ensuring that the acquired colleges were acquired via a “newly re-
structured, clean holding company” so that CAST can “take full ownership of the university 
assets”.  
 
In no way did they address why a farmer pocketed RMB 113 million in quick profits by acting as 
a middleman during the acquisition of Lijiang College. 
 
Why didn’t CAST provide clear, transparent answers when OLP came out with its very specific 
allegations regarding the Lijiang College acquisition? 
 
 
Our Conclusion 
 
We found the Company’s public response insufficient to allay our concerns. With respect to the 
Lijiang acquisition, OLP made very specific statements and presented strong evidence 
indicating that someone misappropriated RMB 113 million. OLP provided backup documents 
from various sources to show that CAST paid a materially higher amount than the intermediary 
had paid to acquire the same asset only a few weeks before. We furthermore acquired the 
same backup documents and verified OLP’s claims for ourselves. Where did that money go? 
Who pocketed the RMB 113 million?  
 
The public investing community deserves to know. If those funds were ultimately transferred to 
CAST insiders, that should obviously be disclosed. If those funds were transferred to other 
independent parties, CAST shareholders should know that they paid a substantially higher 
amount than the original sellers of Lijiang College received. Based on the filings, some party 
pocketed the difference. Who was it? CAST’s unwillingness to publicly address the issue in a 
direct, straightforward manner is highly concerning, in our opinion.

Part 3: Additional Red Flags With ChinaCast 


Other Allegations of OLP Global 
 
In addition to providing evidence that funds were misappropriated during the acquisitions of 
FTBC and Lijiang College, OLP made a variety of other allegations.  
 
In our discussion of CAST’s acquisition of FTBC, we focused on the initial purchase of an 80% 
stake in the college in 2008. OLP also raised concerns about the Company’s purchase of the 
remaining 20% stake in September 2009. This argument is complex, and our interpretation is 
that OLP believed it identified a related party transaction during the acquisition of the remaining 
20% of FTBC. Furthermore, our interpretation of OLP’s arguments is that they believe they have 
evidence that shows that this acquisition of the remaining 20% of FTBC was again disclosed in 
SEC filings at an inflated value. The Company’s responses can be found in the 8Ks listed 
earlier. 
 
OLP also raises various questions around CAST’s third college acquisition. CAST purchased 
Hubei Industrial University Business College (HIUBC) on August 23, 2010 for RMB 450 million. 
OLP noted certain striking similarities to the FTBC and Lijiang College acquisitions.  
 
First, CAST acquired the college from a subsidiary that it itself had previously set up several 
years ago: Shanghai Rubao Information Technology (“Rubao”). Rubao was set up in 2005 and 
in Rubao’s 2008 annual inspection report, CAST CEO Ron Chan’s email address was listed as 
the corporate contact. Rubao’s contact phone number was also a number previously used for 
ChinaCast Co. Ltd. CCL and CCT Shanghai were also shown to have had transactions with 
Rubao in historical periods.  
 
Second, the recipient of CAST’s RMB 450 million payment, Wu Shi Xing, appears to be a small 
business owner whose education is limited to junior high school. We question how he came to 
be the owner of a Hubei business college that was then sold to CAST. We hired investigators to 
acquire background information on Wu, and the information can be found below.

* our investigators did some brief research on this company and found that it was deregistered on November 26, 
1998.However, it is not unknown for records to be very out of date. 


 
OLP said that they spoke to Wu and concluded that he “is an average small business owner 
and had nothing to do with independent colleges in China.” Here is a recounting of their 
diligence regarding Wu: 
 


“In our opinion, Mr. Wu Shixing, 100% owner of Wintown/Rubao, was clearly a 
front man. According to CAST’s SEC filings, Mr. Wu owns 100% Wintown/Rubao 
and guarantees that HIUBC’s 2009 academic year net profit will not be less than 
RMB 55 million. When we inquired about Mr. Wu’s background, CAST 
management simply stated that “Mr. Wu was the shareholder of the offshore 
holding company after the reorganization undertaken by the sellers”, without 
disclosing further details. Similar to Mr. Xie’s role in East Achieve/Xijiu (acquisition 
#2), we believe Mr. Wu was just a front man and CAST has been behind 
Wintown/Rubao… 
 
Mr. Wu’s true identity – a small printing shop owner. CAST management portrayed 
Mr. Wu as a wealthy Chinese citizen who shares the passion and vision in China’s 
education industry. After all, for someone who is willing to invest $29.3 million in

cash without any guarantee that HIUBC acquisition will even close must be a true 
visionary. Here is the real identity of Mr. Wu: he resides in the outskirts of 
Shanghai with his family, operating a small printing shop, Shanghai Hai Da 
Printing Factory (Hai Da). Hai Da makes plastic and fabric labels for clothing and 
packaging, rents a small factory plant and hires 4-5 temporary workers. Our 
conversation with Mr. Wu himself further convinced us that Mr. Wu is an average 
small business owner and had nothing to do with independent colleges in China.” 


 
Our investigators separately provided a similar profile of Wu; he is a small business owner who 
does not have the type of background we would expect from someone who would own a for-
profit university like HIUBC.  
 
As we saw with Lijiang College, the true sellers of HIUBC sold the college to a legal holding 
company that was previously set up by CAST and was owned by what appears to be a front 
man. The CAST-founded legal entity was then subsequently sold to CAST, and the recipient of 
the proceeds was an individual who does not appear to have the sort of background of 
someone who would own a highly valuable for-profit university.  
 
Finally, OLP provided documentation that CAST does not own the land use rights for the land 
on which HIUBC operates. They provide a photocopy of the land use rights they obtained for 
what they said was the HIUBC campus. According to the document they provided, the land use 
rights for that plot of land belongs to Hubei Industrial University, the parent university that 
HIUBC is affiliated with. Furthermore, subsequent to CAST’s announcement of the acquisition, 
HIUBC issued a statement on its website stating “it is pure rumor that CAST had successfully 
acquired HIUBC. The rumor is baseless and does not have supporting evidence. HIUBC’s legal 
representative remains Mr. Chen Zhuoguo, the investor remains Wuhan Jiyang Education 
Investment Co. Limited. The school is operating in a normal state.” This bizarre incident was 
documented by a local reporter on September 1, 2010, available here. The reporter verified 
HIUBC’s statement with the parent university, and it appears that the parent university was not 
aware of HIUBC being acquired by CAST. 
 
For our part, we have been unable to confirm the OLP documentation of the HIUBC land use 
rights. We called an official at HIUBC and they said that the college was owned by CAST. The 
whole incident nevertheless raises yet another red flag, in our opinion, and we could envision a 
scenario where HIUBC officials have since been told to tell any outside inquirers that the college 
is owned by CAST.  
 


Unnecessary Capital Raises 
 
When we come across U.S.-listed Chinese companies exhibiting red flags, such as 
mismatching SAIC financial information and suspicious acquisition transactions, we examine 
whether the companies have conducted unnecessary capital raises at low valuations. 
 
Fraudulent companies conduct capital raises for several reasons. First, because frauds typically 
have small and negligible business operations, they typically do not generate much cash to fund 
their regular operating costs, not to mention the costs involved with perpetuating fraud. Second, 
management teams have found ways to misappropriate cash from company bank accounts 
once capital has been raised from foreign shareholders. Examples of misappropriation include 
overpaying for acquisitions, overpaying for capital expenditures, engaging in related party 



http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2010-09/01/content_20781699.htm
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  575 Madison Avenue, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10022  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 37





transactions or merely transferring the funds out of the bank accounts and into personal 
accounts. Third, management teams of frauds raise cash in order to build out their businesses, 
attempting to “grow into” the inflated historical financials that they have been fabricating. At the 
least, by building a larger business, the fraud becomes more difficult to prove over time. 
Typically, capital raises for frauds can involve a combination of these various motives. Some 
funds are stolen, some are used to fund current operations, and some are used to build a more 
legitimate business.  
 
ChinaCast has completed several secondary public offerings. They also conspicuously diluted 
their outstanding shares in 2008 by voluntarily reducing the strike price of their legacy SPAC 
warrants in order to raise $15 million from three hedge funds. This warrant exercise essentially 
functioned as a secondary offering, given that the warrants were out-of-the-money at the time. 
To further entice the hedge funds to exercise the warrants, CAST even offered additional 
restricted shares as a bonus. Altogether, the warrant amendment and share issuance increased 
outstanding shares by 15%, despite the fact that the Company had ample cash on its balance 
sheet at the time of the warrant amendment.  
 
The first secondary public offering was announced on September 26, 2008. The Company 
raised $11.1 million of capital through a secondary equity offering arranged by Roth Capital. 
Roth also received warrants in addition to their customary underwriting fee. The offering was 
priced at an 18% discount to the closing price of CAST stock on the day prior to the 
announcement, and a 31% discount to the average closing price of CAST stock for the 30 days 
prior to the announcement. These are large discounts. 
 
At the time of the capital raise, the Company was trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.9x and 
a P/E ratio of less than 10x. These were low multiples for a company that was supposedly 
growing through the recession unfazed (non-acquisition-related gross profit increased 25% from 
FY 2007 to FY 2008).  
 
At the time of the capital raise, the Company had $57 million of cash on the balance sheet, and 
according to its SEC financial statements, the Company generated $11 million and $31 million 
of cash flow from operations in 2007 and 2008, respectively. According to the offering 
prospectus, the proceeds would be used to “fund product development, corporate growth and 
for other general corporate purposes.” The offering was completed five months after the 
completion of the FTBC 80% stake acquisition, and it would be nearly a year before CAST 
announced its next college acquisition.  
 
In our opinion, CAST’s first secondary offering suffers from many of the red flags we have seen 
in the past. The Company raised cash from US investors despite reporting substantial cash on 
the balance sheet, healthy operating cash flow and no immediate need for the cash proceeds. 
Furthermore, the capital was raised while the Company was trading at a low valuation, and at a 
large discount to its prior 30-day trading average.  
  
Chinacast’s second public offering to US investors was announced on December 2, 2009. The 
Company raised $46.7 million in an offering arranged by Roth, Brean Murray and Global Hunter. 
The offering was priced at a 6% discount to the closing price of CAST stock on the day prior to 
the announcement, and a 4% discount to the average closing price of CAST stock for the 30 
days prior to the announcement.
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  575 Madison Avenue, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10022  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 38





At the time of the capital raise, the Company was trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.3x and 
a P/E ratio of 31x. These multiples and discounts were reasonable metrics at which to raise 
capital (assuming, of course, that the EBITDA and EPS figures were accurate).  
 
At the time of the capital raise, the Company supposedly had $100 million of cash on the 
balance sheet, and according to its SEC financial statements, the Company generated $31 
million and $20 million of cash flow from operations in 2008 and 2009, respectively. According 
to the offering prospectus, the proceeds would be used “for working capital, future acquisitions 
and general corporate purposes.” The Company had closed its Lijiang College acquisition three 
months earlier, and therefore the Company did not need the capital for the Lijiang acquisition. 
The Company announced the HIUBC acquisition in April 2010, four months after the capital 
raise, and the total spent on HIUBC according to SEC filings was $66 million.  
 
Again, this secondary capital raise struck us as unnecessary because the Company supposedly 
had $100 million of cash on its balance sheet for potential acquisitions, such as the one of 
HIUBC announced several months later. 
 
Lastly, in June and July of 2008, the Company voluntarily reduced the strike price of its warrants 
to allow several hedge funds to exercise their otherwise out-of-the-money warrants. The 
Company even issued additional shares to the hedge funds as part of the warrant amendment. 
Press releases announcing these warrant amendments can be found here and here.  
 
To understand the nuances behind this action, which we consider highly dilutive and essentially 
equivalent to a capital raise, it’s important to provide some background. ChinaCast was 
originally a Singapore-listed company that switched to a U.S. exchange by being acquired by a 
U.S.-listed Special Purpose Acquisition Company (“SPAC”) in December 2006. This SPAC had 
warrants outstanding at the time of the 2006 acquisition that were exercisable at $5.00 and 
expired in March 2009. In 2006 and 2007, no warrants were exercised. In 2008, the Company’s 
shares fell below $5, rendering the warrants out-of-the-money.  
 
Intuitively, the potential removal of CAST’s large warrant overhang should have been a boon 
and welcomed as a silver lining to the Company at the time. The legacy SPAC warrants would 
constitute more than a third of the Company’s outstanding shares upon exercise, and if they 
expired worthless, the intrinsic value of the common shares would increase substantially.  
 
Yet when the Company’s stock price declined below $5, ChinaCast voluntarily entered into an 
agreement with three shareholders in June and July of 2008 to reduce the exercise price to 
$4.25 in order to allow the hedge funds to exercise their warrants. Even more conspicuously, 
ChinaCast issued additional restricted shares to entice the hedge funds to participate in the 
transaction. In total, three hedge funds exercised 3.5 million warrants, increasing the 
Company’s outstanding shares by 13%. The 537,311 newly issued restricted shares increased 
the share base by another 2%.  
 
The warrant exercise resulted in $15 million of new cash being sent to CAST’s bank accounts. 
 
This transaction effectively functioned as a capital raise. When the hedge funds exercised their 
warrants, the Company essentially raised $15m of new capital by issuing shares.  
 
As with the two public offerings, let’s examine the Company’s financial metrics at the time of the 
warrant amendment. As of the day of the first announcement, the Company was trading at an 
EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.4x. (That multiple is pro forma for the FTBC acquisition which closed

on April 2008; excluding the FTBC EBITDA and the cash spent on the acquisition would yield a 
company EV/EBITDA of less than 1x at the time of the warrant amendment.) 
 
As with the first capital raise, we note again the low company valuation at the time of the 
warrant amendment.  
 
Prior to the warrant exercise, the Company supposedly had a cash balance of $57 million, if we 
use the cash balance as of June 30, 2008. We question why the Company needed the cash 
receipts from the warrant exercise, and why they were willing to reduce the strike price of the 
warrants when the Company was trading at such a low valuation. 
 
Why would any management team voluntarily reduce the strike price of out-of-the-money 
warrants, and issue additional shares as a bonus, when the Company was trading at a 
depressed valuation and purportedly had ample cash on its balance sheet? One potential 
explanation is that the underlying company was materially smaller than SEC financial 
statements indicated, and that management was keen on raising cash from foreign investors to 
either siphon it to personal bank accounts, acquire brick-and-mortar colleges to try to “grow into” 
their financials, and/or cover business costs given that the stated cash on the balance sheet 
didn’t actually exist.  
 


Bank Statement Falsifications Committed by ChinaCast Co. Ltd. 
 
When reviewing the SAIC filings for CCLX, we came across a government document that 
detailed bank verification falsifications by the management of ChinaCast Co. Ltd. The document 
highlights a case filed by the Investigation Unit of the Shanghai Administration of Industry and 
Commerce.  
 
The salient points of the filing were: 
 


 In order to qualify for overseas investment criteria in 2000, Shanghai Shuangwei 
Technology Investment Management Co., Ltd.1 passed a resolution to increase its 
registered capital. 


 
 Shuangwei Technology directed its accountant (Shanghai Wenhui Accounting Ltd.) to 


provide bank statements verifying the capital injection. 
 
 The banks statements included incoming statements, bank certificates and bank inquiry 


forms. 
 
 Following investigation by the Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce, it 


was determined that the incoming statement for the RMB 14.2mm capital injection was 
fabricated. 


 
To summarize, the CCL management at the time fabricated a bank statement in order to 
deceive regulatory officials.

Address: #25 145 Pujian Road, Pudong New District, 25 FL 


According to the case filed and closed by the Investigation Unit, the defendant’s 
fraudulent capital investment actions were stated as follows: 


In order to qualify for overseas investment criteria, in September 2000 Shanghai 
Shuangwei Science and Technology Investment Management Co., Ltd. (“Shuangwei 
Technology Co.”) had its board pass a resolution to increase registered capital from RMB 
8 million to RMB 20 million, and to increase the shareholder base. As a shareholder, the 
defendant decided to invest RMB 14.2 million, including 3.8 million of registered capital 
and RMB 10.4 million of contributed capital, without actually having the available capital. 
The defendant’s proxy, the president of Shuangwei Technology, Sun Sihui, managed the 
capital injection process, using its accountant Shanghai Wenhui Certified Public 
Accountants Co., Ltd. to provide incoming statements, bank certificates and bank inquiry 
forms for verifying the capital injection process. On November 2, 2000, Shanghai Wenhui 
Certified Public Accountants Co., Ltd. filed examined document (2000) No. 084 Capital 
Verification Report to confirm the Defendant had injected RMB 14.2 million, including 3.8 
million in registered capital and 10.4 million in additional paid-in capital. Subsequently, 
Shuangwei Technology Co. used the Capital Verification Report to alter the company’s 
registered status with the Shanghai Pudong District Administration of Industry and 
Commerce, and its status change was approved on April 20, 2001 with the Defendant 
increasing registered capital by 3.8 million. 


According to investigation and reevaluation, the above stated attachment verifying the 
RMB 14.2 million capital injection was fabricated. 





A Key CAST Executive and Failed Chinese RTO Asia Premium 
Television 
 
One of the key executives behind the origin of ChinaCast and its underlying operations is an 
individual named Yin Jianping. Yin is not mentioned often by CAST analysts because the face 
of the Company is CEO Ron Chan and Executive Director and President International Michael 
Santos.  
 
Yet prior to 2010, Yin legally controlled and owned the Company’s main ELG operating 
subsidiary. He was the principal signatory to most of the SAIC documents filed by CCLX.  
 
Yin is currently Vice Chairman of the company, and prior to August 2009, he was also a 
director. As recently as the 2008 10K, he is described as being “responsible for our overall 
management, operations and strategic direction”. With that sort of a biography, it’s clear that Yin 
is a meaningful member of the executive team. We would not be surprised if Yin and Chief 
Operating Officer Li Wei are the real operators of the actual businesses, despite being lesser 
known to foreign investors.

In Part One of this report, we discuss how the ELG segment is operated by the subsidiary 
CCLX. The Beijing Branch of CCL, or CCLBJ, also historically contributed revenue to the 
Company in the form of “management service fee” revenue. As discussed previously, CCT 
Shanghai is mainly a dormant shell while the actual operations occur at CCLX.  Below, we show 
the legal representatives of CCLX and CCL since their inceptions, as well as CCT Shanghai. 
 


Entity 
Year of 


Incorporation Legal Representatives Since Inception 
CCLX 2003 Yin Jianping (2003-2009); Li Wei (2009-Present) 
CCL 1999 Lu Ruifeng (1999-2001); Yin Jianping (2001-Present) 
CCT Shanghai 2000 Ron Chan (2000 to Present) 
 
As we can see, Yin Jianping has been the Legal Representative of CCLX and CCL for much of 
the companies’ historical life spans. Yin was the majority owner of CCLX prior to December 
2009; on December 2009, Yin sold control of the entity to its current shareholders Li Wei, Jiang 
Xiangyuan and Zhang Liwen for an entity-wide valuation of RMB 30 million. Yin is also the 
controlling shareholder of CCL. 
 
Therefore, as we can see, Yin Jianping has historically been a central figure in ChinaCast’s ELG 
segment.  
 
As such, it concerns us that Yin Jianping was also the CEO of a Chinese RTO that failed to 
consummate its proposed acquisition and ultimately ended up worthless in value. In late 2002,  
Yin was appointed to be CEO of the over-the-counter bulletin board company Asia Premium 
Television Group, Inc. as part of a reverse merger involving the acquisition of various Chinese 
media assets. The initial 8K announcing the deal is available here. It is unclear exactly when Yin 
was appointed CEO, but as of the next 10K filing, Yin was listed as CEO.  
 
The transaction was never consummated. Yin left the CEO post in late 2003, and today the 
successor to Asia Premium Television Group, Inc., China Grand Resorts, Inc., trades at 20 
cents, and less than 1,000 shares have traded in the past 6 months.  
 
From our reading of SEC filings, Yin did nothing wrong, but we mention this historical data point 
to note that ChinaCast’s management team is not new to the U.S.-listed Chinese RTO asset 
class.  
 
Proponents of ChinaCast often refer to the Company’s SPAC origins as justification that the 
Company does not belong to the RTO asset class, and should not receive the same level of 
scrutiny that most other Chinese RTOs have received over the past year. We disagree. First, 
allegations of fraud have been regular occurrences among U.S.-listed SPACs that have 
purchased China-based companies, with China MediaExpress (CCME) being the most high-
profile example. SPACs often suffer from a similar low level of going-public due diligence as 
RTOs. Second, as we can see here, one of CAST’s main founding executives is a former CEO 
of a failed U.S.-listed RTO. Finally, we will mention that the Singapore stock exchange has long 
been a breeding ground for fraud, and a list of articles worth reading on the topic can be found 
here.

Conclusion 
 
We believe that ChinaCast Education Corp. is falsifying its SEC financial statements. Based on 
our evidence, we believe that the actual underlying ELG business has historically generated 
materially less revenue and profit than what the Company has reported in SEC filings. We also 
provide evidence that funds may have been misappropriated during two of the Company’s 
college acquisitions; when faced with these allegations, the Company’s unwillingness to publicly 
address these issues in a clear, straightforward manner made us further concerned about 
CAST.  
 
Below, we summarize some of the most serious red flags that we found when researching 
ChinaCast:  
 
 The SAIC filings for the main operating subsidiary of the Company’s ELG segment 


show materially less revenue and profit than what the Company reports in SEC 
filings. In our report, we include photocopies of the annual inspection reports, as well as 
signed attestations by the subsidiaries’ legal representatives attesting that the information in 
the SAIC filings is valid and accurate. 


 
 SAIC filings provide evidence that shareholder funds were misappropriated during 


the Company’s acquisition of a business college in 2008. The Company announced in 
SEC filings that it acquired a business college in 2008 for RMB 480 million. Yet Chinese 
filings show that CAST paid only RMB 165 million for the asset. We question what 
happened to the remaining RMB 315 million, and whether it was essentially stolen by 
insiders.  


 
 Filings with Chinese Securities Regulators and the SAIC provide evidence that funds 


were misappropriated during the acquisition of another college in 2009. During CAST’s 
2009 acquisition of Lijiang College, Chinese filings show that CAST paid at least RMB 113 
million more than what the sellers of the college sold it for. The RMB 113 million difference 
appears to have been pocketed by a farmer from Fujian province through an intermediary 
holding company previously set up by CAST. We question whether the RMB 113 million was 
misappropriated during the acquisition. We are furthermore concerned by CAST’s 
unwillingness to directly address these specific allegations in a public manner when it had 
the opportunity to do so. 


 
 The Company has repeatedly raised cash through secondary equity offerings and 


unnecessary warrant exercises, despite having a large amount of cash on its balance 
sheet. In multiple situations, capital was effectively raised at low valuations, diluting 
shareholders in what we believe would be an irrational manner if the Company’s SEC 
financial statements were accurate. 


 
We urge officials at Deloitte, NASDAQ and the Securities and Exchange Commission to review 
our report. In our opinion, there is clear evidence that CAST is providing false financial 
information to one set of regulators, given that SEC and SAIC financial statements diverge by a 
material disparity. We believe it is the American regulators and investing public that are being 
defrauded.
