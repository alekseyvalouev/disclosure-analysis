Insys Therapuetics issues a statement
Insys has issued a statement regarding their Subsys business... 
 
Insys Therapeutics Issues Clarifying Statement 
 
 
PHOENIX, AZ--(Marketwired - May 12, 2014) - Insys Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY) today
issued a clarifying statement regarding its Subsys® (fentanyl sublingual spray) product. 
 
Insys takes patient safety very seriously and we are committed to working with physicians to help
ensure the proper prescribing and use of our products. 
 
In terms of our business, we have continually expanded our commercial organization since launch
due to the success of Subsys in treating break through cancer pain in opioid tolerant cancer patients
who are 18 years or older. As such, we have expanded our prescriber base and for 2014 year-to-
date, no single physician has written more than 5% of total Subsys prescriptions. 
 
Based on recent activity, we feel it is appropriate to summarize and address some of the important
items regarding Subsys. Subsys is governed by the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl
("TIRF") Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") Access program, which was approved and
launched by the FDA in March 2012. lnsys began commercializing Subsys on March 26, 2012 after
the implementation of this TIRF-REMS program. 
 
This TIRF-REMS program is designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating
treatment and appropriate use of TIRF medicines. The purpose of the TIRF-REMS program is to
mitigate the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and serious complications due to medication
errors with the use of TIRF medicines. Subsys can only be prescribed after physicians have
undergone training on the risks and benefits of such products and products can only be dispensed via
pharmacies who are REMS enrolled. Additionally, all patients and physicians are required to sign a
prescriber patient agreement form as part of this process. Insys continues to support the TIRF-REMS
program that was co-developed with other participant companies. More information regarding the
TIRF-REMS program can be found at www.tirfremsaccess.com. 
 
Insys does not sell directly to physicians. lnsys only sells Subsys through DEA approved wholesalers
who monitor and track prescribing activity for this TIRF class of drugs and all opioids. Insys remains
committed to our compliance program and protocols in place that are designed to ensure our sales
and marketing practices comply with applicable laws.

I will restrain myself to two things. 
 
(a). They point out correctly they do not sell directly to doctors. No drug company does. Instead they
educate doctors about the drug and hopefully the doctors write a script which is collected by the
patients. This whole section elides the issue of how the incentive marketing scheme grates against
the laws regarding off-label marketing and the like. It is the interaction between the incentive program
and alleged off-label prescriptions by the indicted doctor that matter here. 
 
(b). They observe that Subsys can only be prescribed under restrictive conditions... "Subsys can only
be prescribed after physicians have undergone training on the risks and benefits of such products and
products can only be dispensed via pharmacies who are REMS enrolled. Additionally, all patients and
physicians are required to sign a prescriber patient agreement form as part of this process. Insys
continues to support the TIRF-REMS program that was co-developed with other participant
companies." 
 
This does not match the alleged behaviour of the doctor in question who was allegedly prescribing
narcotics for something that looked like carpels tunnel syndrome. 
 
 
Just saying.
