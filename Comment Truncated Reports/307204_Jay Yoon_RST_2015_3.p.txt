Summary


On	an	annualized	basis,	YTD	FY	2014	E&E	bookings	have	actually	declined	versus
last	year.


Sell-side	estimates	for	FY	2015	E&E	revenue	are	much	too	high.


RST	may	be	cutting	uneconomical	multi-year	deals	to	boost	bookings	in	the	short
term	at	the	expense	of	future	performance.


Competitors,	such	as	Duolingo,	have	begun	to	take	share	in	the	E&E	space.


RST	remains	an	excellent	short	opportunity.


Many	Rosetta	Stone	(NYSE:RST)	longs	feel	that	the	Company's	Enterprise	&	Education
(E&E)	segment	will	be	a	significant	growth	driver	for	the	business	going	forward.	For	the
first	nine	months	of	FY	2014,	the	Company's	E&E	bookings	grew	by	7.4%	y-o-y	(pro	forma
for	Lexia	&	Tell	Me	More	acquisitions).	This	growth	in	bookings	has	been	perceived	by
investors	as	a	strong	sign	that	the	E&E	business	is	accelerating.	In	reality,	a	deeper
analysis	of	the	E&E	segment	results	reveals	that	this	business	segment	is	actually
showing	signs	of	deterioration.	In	my	initial	article	on	RST,	I	argued	that	the	performance
of	the	Company's	E&E	business	has	been	artificially	boosted	by	the	Company's
conversion	to	multi-year	contracts.	In	this	article,	I	will	provide	a	more	detailed	analysis	of
the	recent	bookings	trend	in	the	E&E	business.	From	this	analysis,	I	will	show	the	degree
to	which	the	E&E	bookings	growth	has	been	inflated	by	the	conversion	to	multi-year
contracts.	In	addition	to	this,	I	will	also	demonstrate	how	research	analyst	estimates	for
E&E	revenue	in	FY	2015	are	significantly	overstated.	Finally,	to	finish	the	article,	I	will
discuss	the	potentially	negative	implications	of	the	Company's	shift	to	focusing	on	multi-
year	contracts.


Annualized	Bookings	Trend	Reveals	Minimal	Growth	in	E&E	Segment


I	have	provided	below	a	comparison	of	the	E&E	segment's	YTD	FY	2014	bookings	results
versus	last	year.

As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	YTD	E&E	bookings	have	grown	by	7.4%	versus	last	year.
This	growth	was	primarily	driven	by	strong	growth	in	Lexia	bookings,	as	well	as	a
turnaround	in	Language	bookings	in	Q2	and	Q3.	On	the	surface,	the	recent	E&E	bookings
trend	appears	to	be	encouraging.	In	reality,	the	recent	growth	in	E&E	bookings	is	not	as
strong	as	it	appears.	In	particular,	Language	bookings	have	been	greatly	aided	by	an
increased	focus	on	signing	single-year	versus	multi-year	contracts.	On	an	annualized
basis,	YTD	Language	bookings	have	actually	declined	relative	to	last	year.	For	example,
in	Q2	2014,	RST	signed	a	5-year	Language	contract	worth	a	total	of	$3mm.	On	an
annualized	basis,	this	contract	is	worth	$600K	a	year.	Thus,	Q2	2014	Language	bookings
were	inflated	by	$2.4mm	due	to	this	contract.	The	figure	below	provides	a	comparison	of
Q2'13	and	Q2'14	Language	bookings	after	properly	adjusting	for	the	$3mm	multi-year
contract:


In	Q2	2014,	RST	reported	Q2	2014	Language	bookings	growth	of	1.8%	y-o-y.	However,
as	shown	above,	Q2	2014	Language	bookings	actually	declined	by	8.9%	y-o-y	after
annualizing	the	value	of	the	$3mm	contract.	The	decline	in	annualized	Language	bookings
in	Q2	2014	continued	into	Q3	2014.	In	Q3	2014,	the	Company	signed	an	even	higher
proportion	of	multi-year	Language	contracts.	This	is	reflected	in	the	abnormally	large
increase	in	RST's	long-term	deferred	revenue	liability	from	Q2'14	to	Q3'14:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2813165-why-the-e-and-e-business-wont-save-rosetta-stone 3/7


Long-term	deferred	revenue	increased	by	$9.8mm	from	Q2'14	to	Q3'14.	This	is	more	than
twice	the	increase	in	long-term	deferred	revenue	from	Q1'14	to	Q2'14.	This	strongly
implies	that	more	than	twice	the	amount	of	multi-year	Language	contracts	were	signed	in
Q3'14	compared	to	Q2'14.	Thus,	I	have	assumed	that	the	Company	signed	5-year
contracts	in	Q3'14	worth	a	total	of	at	least	$6mm.	Based	on	this	assumption,	I	have
provided	a	comparison	of	Q3'13	and	Q3'14	Language	bookings	after	adjusting	for	multi-
year	contracts:


In	Q3'14,	RST	reported	Language	bookings	growth	of	5.5%	y-o-y.	However,	similar	to
Q2'14,	annualized	Q3'14	Language	bookings	have	actually	declined	after	adjusting	for
multi-year	contracts.	Annualized	Q3'14	Language	bookings	of	$24.0mm	represents	a
12.1%	decline	y-o-y.	Thus,	based	on	this	analysis,	the	decline	in	Language	bookings	has
accelerated	in	Q3'14.


At	the	beginning	of	this	section,	I	provided	a	comparison	of	YTD	FY	2014	E&E	bookings
versus	last	year.	Once	again,	I	have	provided	this	same	comparison	below.	This	time,
however,	I	have	replaced	actual	Language	bookings	with	my	estimate	for	annualized
Language	bookings:

The	figure	provided	above	ties	everything	together.	After	adjusting	for	multi-year	contracts,
YTD	annualized	Language	bookings	have	declined	by	9.1%	y-o-y.	Due	to	the	decline	in
annualized	Language	bookings,	total	E&E	bookings	have	actually	decreased	by
1.8%	y-o-y!	The	Language	business	represents	~80%	of	E&E	revenues,	so	the
deterioration	in	annualized	Language	bookings	has	greatly	depressed	overall	E&E	growth.
While	the	recent	growth	in	the	Lexia	business	is	certainly	a	positive,	Lexia	currently
represents	just	20%	of	E&E	revenue	and	less	than	10%	of	RST's	total	revenue.	Thus,
growth	in	Lexia	bookings	has	a	relatively	small	impact	on	total	bookings.	Overall,	the	fact
that	annualized	E&E	bookings	are	actually	declining	rather	increasing	should	be	of	great
concern	for	longs.	Also	concerning	for	longs	is	the	fact	that	Lexia	is	the	only	business
demonstrating	positive	growth.	The	other	90%+	of	RST's	business	is	declining	at	a	rapid
pace	(e.g.	Consumer,	Language).


Sell-Side	Research	Estimates	Are	Way	Off	The	Mark


In	addition	to	investors,	it	appears	that	sell-side	research	analysts	have	also	been	fooled
by	RST's	artificially	inflated	E&E	bookings	growth	in	FY	2014.	For	example,	provided
below	is	a	summary	of	PiperJaffray's	current	estimates	for	FY	2014	and	FY	2015	E&E
revenue:


As	I	demonstrated	in	the	prior	section,	total	E&E	bookings	have	actually	declined	after
properly	adjusting	for	multi-year	contracts.	Based	on	this	fact,	it	is	clear	to	see	that
PiperJaffray's	FY	2015	revenue	growth	estimate	of	46.2%	is	way	too	aggressive.	It	should

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2813165-why-the-e-and-e-business-wont-save-rosetta-stone 5/7


be	noted	that	FY	2014	revenue	has	been	artificially	depressed	due	to	the	acquisition-
related	write-down	of	Lexia	and	Tell	Me	More's	deferred	revenue	balance.	After	adding
back	the	lost	revenue	due	to	the	deferred	revenue	write-downs,	FY	2014	revenue	is
estimated	to	be	~$100mm.	However,	even	after	this	add-back	to	FY	2014	revenue,
PiperJaffray's	FY	2015	revenue	estimate	still	appears	much	too	high.	$122mm	of	E&E
revenue	in	FY	2015	represents	a	22%	increase	over	$100mm	of	E&E	revenue	in	FY	2014.
Given	the	fact	that	E&E	bookings	have	declined	this	year	on	an	annualized	basis,
achieving	22%	E&E	revenue	growth	in	FY	2015	appears	highly	unlikely.	In	fact,	given
the	current	negative	growth	in	annualized	bookings,	E&E	revenue	is	likely	to	decline	in	FY
2015.


Signing	Multi-Year	Contracts	Could	Have	Negative	Long-Term	Implications


In	addition	to	inflating	the	E&E	bookings	results,	the	Company's	increased	focus	on
signing	multi-year	contracts	could	have	negative	long-term	implications	for	the	E&E
business.	The	reason	is,	in	order	to	get	enterprises	and	schools	to	commit	to	multi-year
deals,	it	is	likely	that	RST	had	to	offer	substantial	discounts.	For	example,	as	mentioned
previously,	RST	signed	a	5-year	K-12	Language	contract	in	Q2	2014.	Schools	typically
operate	on	an	annual	budget	which	constantly	changes.	Thus,	it	is	highly	likely	that	a
school	would	be	unwilling	to	commit	to	a	lengthy	5-year	contract	without	substantial	price
concessions.	Similarly,	it	is	likely	that	enterprise	clients	would	also	require	a	meaningful
discount	in	order	to	commit	to	a	multi-year	contract.	The	turnover	of	a	typical	company's
workforce	is	simply	not	high	enough	to	justify	spending	the	same	amount	on	RST's
products	year	after	year.	The	return	on	investment	for	using	RST's	services	diminishes
significantly	over	time	after	the	majority	of	the	workforce	has	been	trained	in	the	first	year.
For	these	reasons,	I	believe	that	RST	may	be	signing	uneconomical	multi-year	deals.
Cutting	uneconomical	multi-year	deals	will	boost	bookings	in	the	short-term	but
significantly	depress	revenue	growth	and	profitability	over	the	long-term.	Thus,	over	time,	I
believe	that	RST's	focus	on	signing	multi-year	contracts	will	further	deteriorate	the
Company's	financial	performance.


So	why	would	Rosetta	Stone	cut	uneconomical	deals	at	this	time?	I	believe	that
competitive	pressures	are	beginning	to	affect	the	E&E	business	in	the	same	manner	as
the	Consumer	business.	Some	schools	are	beginning	to	adopt	Duolingo	as	a
supplementary	tool	for	language	learning.	For	example,	my	sister	currently	works	at
AltSchool	which	is	a	private	school	system	in	San	Francisco.	Their	teachers	all	use
Duolingo	as	a	teaching	tool	rather	than	Rosetta	Stone	due	to	the	superior	efficacy	and

cost.	Although	this	is	just	one	example,	the	fact	that	an	elite	school	system	that	is	very
forward-thinking	would	rather	use	Duolingo	than	Rosetta	Stone	speaks	volumes.	Thus,	I
believe	that	Duolingo	will	eventually	take	more	share	in	the	E&E	market.


Conclusion


RST's	conversion	from	single-year	to	multi-year	contracts	has	fooled	both	investors	and
sell-side	research	analysts.	As	I	demonstrated	in	this	article,	after	properly	adjusting	for
multi-year	contracts,	annualized	E&E	bookings	have	actually	declined	versus	last	year.	FY
2015	estimates	for	the	E&E	business	are	much	too	high,	and	it	is	likely	that	the	Company
will	miss	analyst	targets	by	a	meaningful	amount.	It	also	appears	that	RST	may	be	cutting
uneconomical	multi-year	deals	which	boost	E&E	bookings	in	the	short-term	but	depress
revenue	growth	and	profitability	over	the	long-term.	Finally,	it	appears	that	competitors,
like	Duolingo,	are	beginning	to	take	share	in	the	E&E	business.	Given	that	many	investors
have	hinged	their	hopes	on	RST's	E&E	business,	the	points	I	have	raised	in	this	article
should	be	of	great	concern.	Despite	the	recent	decline	in	share	price,	I	believe	RST
remains	an	excellent	short	opportunity.
