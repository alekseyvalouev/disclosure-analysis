Care.com: Multiple Deaths and Child Abuses,
Fraudulent Billing, and a Harvey Weinstein
Babysitter
Care.com is the largest babysitting platform in the U.S., their largest shareholder is


Google, their CEO advised President Obama, and they have facilitated at least five deaths


and dozens of child abuse crimes. I first heard of Care.com after my friend received death


threats from scammers on the site. In the eleven months since then I have launched an


investigation into Care.com and what I found is troubling:


· Care.com approved babysitters are linked to the deaths of at least five children (two of


these babysitters had prior criminal histories, another was operating an unlicensed


daycare)


· Care.com babysitters have repeatedly abused children


· Care.com’s caregiver screening appears to be nonexistent. For example, I was able to sign


up and apply to babysitting jobs as Harvey Weinstein:

(I was later upgraded to Care.com’s second highest level of authenticity)


· Care.com’s background checks have approved convicted felons, prostitutes, and people


on probation


· Scamming is common on Care.com and some babysitters have received death threats


· Care.com bills users for unused services and repeatedly bills customers after they cancel


their accounts


· I believe Care.com creates fake “parents”/job opportunities so babysitters will upgrade


so they can apply to nonexistent jobs


· Care.com sells user data to advertisers. This is buried 7,000 words deep in its privacy


policy and is not disclosed to investors.

I believe Care.com s key investor metrics are incorrect. Care.com claims to have over 9


million U.S. babysitters, but its own search feature suggests a number 80% lower. In


addition, web traffic to Care.com is declining while it claims 100%+ user growth and


Care.com’s numbers have other inconsistencies.


· Care.com quietly acquired a staffing company in California. Without this acquisition I


believe Care.com’s revenue growth would be negative.


· After I signed up as Harvey Weinstein and tweeted out a photo of Care.com’s safety


loopholes, Care.com’s CTO, David Krupinski, called my college and said I was


manipulating the market for Care.com stock. He sold $700,000 in stock over the next


three days.


· Over 1,000 pages of consumer complaints against Care.com regarding unauthorized


billing, safety concerns, and fake check scams are summarized and available at the very


end of this report


· If you have information on Care.com please contact me at edwin@585research.com


· Disclaimer: I am personally betting against Care.com stock.


Safety
Care.com babysitters are linked to the deaths of at least five children. On any large


platform, unfortunate incidents will occur, but what makes Care.com particularly


troubling is that babysitters often have prior criminal histories when they register on


Care.com. Four of the five deaths related to Care.com babysitters are below:


1. Care.com babysitter Sarah Gumm was convicted of murder and sentenced to 23 years


in jail for beating a 3-month-old to death. Prior to registering on Care.com she had two


DUIs, a “battery incident,” and a felony charge — all of which went undetected by


Care.com’s background check.


2. Care.com babysitter Sarah Cullen was convicted of murder and sentenced to 70 years in


jail for killing a 4-month-old child. She had a DUI prior to registering on Care.com.


3. Care.com babysitter Aisling McCarthy Brady had no prior criminal history prior to


registering on Care.com, but had overstayed her visa. A one-year-old died in her care. She

was found not guilty in a criminal charge, but the family was later awarded $4 million in a


new lawsuit.


4. An unnamed Care.com babysitter had a child die in her care. It is unclear what


happened to the babysitter, but she was running an unlicensed daycare while advertising


on Care.com.


5. (There is a fifth publicly disclosed case around June 2011 that I decline to identify out


of respect for the family.)


Care.com’s lack of oversight is not limited to the above. In November 2012 NBC Chicago


did an investigation into Care.com’s background checks. They found Care.com approved a


woman convicted on several counts of prostitution and Care.com approved a man


convicted of reckless conduct. Care.com said, “we are deeply disturbed by these findings.”


In March 2015, a family hired Care.com babysitter Ann Guadagnino, only to discover she


was a drug addict that had been charged with possession of heroin, possession of drug


paraphernalia and was issued summonses for speeding and driving while in possession of


a controlled dangerous substance. Care.com said, “There is no centralized database


encompassing all criminal convictions … therefore, [databases we use are] sometimes


missing or omitting recent criminal record charges.”


In December 2015 the Boston Globe launched an investigation into Care.com babysitter


Stephanie Lee Fox after she stole $280,000. A Boston Globe review “found 28 criminal


cases against Fox, which included 111 charges… Fox was convicted of numerous charges


including larceny, identity fraud, forgery, and receiving stolen property.” The Boston


Globe also found Ms. Fox “was still on probation when she registered as a nanny on


Care.com.” Care.com said, “The safety of our community is of paramount importance to


us.”


On March 2018, Care.com babysitter Jonathan Tavara-Nima was sentenced to 25 years


for raping a seven-year-old girl he met on Care.com. Care.com said his account “would be


removed and blacklisted.” Care.com didn’t mention that he had been arrested for child


pornography charges five years earlier.


Despite numerous abuses by Care.com babysitters, coverage almost always stops at the


local news level. Below are just a sampling of stories on abuse by Care.com babysitters:

Harvey Weinstein Babysitter
To test the security of Care.com I decided to apply as Harvey Weinstein. I was asked for a


home address and birthdate. In both cases I did not use Harvey Weinstein’s actual home


address or birthdate. I was also asked to consent to a background check. At the end of the


process I was told, “Your profile has been submitted and is being reviewed for approval


(within the next 72 hours) by our member care team.” To my amazement I passed


Care.com’s review process. After adding a bogus Facebook and Twitter account (each with


0 friends/followers) I started applying to babysitting jobs.


I successfully applied to multiple Care.com babysitting jobs as Harvey Weinstein:

If Care.com had a human screen the profiles or just verified house addresses, names, or


birthdays (very easy) this would not happen. Based on my experience it looks like anyone


can sign up as a Care.com babysitter under whatever name they want.


It gets worse. Care.com has three levels of babysitters: Newcomer, CareForce, and


CarePro. Care.com was so convinced I was legitimate, my Harvey Weinstein profile was


able to join the “CareForce” meaning I would show up in search results:

I was also able to get CPR and First Aid certified without providing any evidence[1].


This is not an isolated incident. In one case an Atlanta family hired the Care.com


babysitter “Regina Christopher” to watch their 8-year-old son. However, “Regina


Christopher was really Gina Groves, who had warrants out for her arrest in four Georgia


counties for various charges.”


According to the article, when [the family] spoke to someone at Care.com, the


representative noted that she’d only paid for “one of the cheaper background checks.”


When criticized on its safety procedures Care.com claims to be just a “marketplace” for


caregivers. However, the word “marketplace” does not appear once on its homepage. In its


legal filings, Care.com claims to do “basic caregiver screening” on all users and offers


background checks on individual caregivers for extra cost. But what type of “caregiver


screening” wouldn’t catch Harvey Weinstein? Or, at minimum, verify a name? Or check a


sex offenders list? What type of background check wouldn’t catch DUIs? Or Felonies? Or a


woman on probation? Or a convicted prostitute?

Scammers & Death Threats


Legitimate Care.com babysitters who sign up for the site often encounter scammers and


some even receive death threats. The most common type of scam on Care.com is a fake


check scam. Scammers pretend to be parents on Care.com and post a job for babysitters.


The scammer says they are about to move to the area and send a fake check for to a


caregiver as a first month’s payment. Then, the scammer “changes plans” and asks for the


check back hoping the babysitter will send a real check before her bank realizes the


original check is fake (takes 5–7 days). Below is a police report from a fake check scam


where the babysitter ultimately received a death threat:


(Source: San Antonio Police Department Public Records Request)


I first heard of Care.com after my friend had a similar experience and went to the police to


deal with the death threats. Others online have complained about similar incidents:


“My daughter applied for a dog-sitting job that was a total scam- she wound up getting


threats that someone would “slice her up” if she didn’t cash a fraudulent check. No help


from care.com, but we did go to the police.” — July 2017 (Source)


“I started receiving death threats to my cell phone, the sender had my HOME ADDRESS. I


still lock the doors, terrified, every night. The care.com team did nothing but send an


automated, impersonal response to my complaint.” — July 2017 (Source)


Many other Care.com users had similar experiences with scammers, but without death

Overbilling & Selling User Data
Parents and caregivers can join Care.com for free, but most of the platform requires


upgrading to paid one, three, or twelve-month subscriptions. Once the subscription term


expires Care.com “auto-renews” the plan until the user cancels. This practice has


generated 100s of complaints (which you can find at the very end of this report) but is


generally permissible and practiced by other businesses — like gyms and software


companies. What is troubling is that Care.com has repeatedly billed users after they


canceled their subscriptions. One women had such difficulty getting Care.com to stop


billing her that she wrote a letter to Care com’s CEO and the Massachusetts Attorney

Care.com never mentions selling user data during its sign-up process, or in its investors


filings, or in its terms of use. (At 13,482 words Care.com’s terms of use is twice the length


of the U.S. Constitution.) The one place Care.com does briefly mention sharing user data


is at the very end of its 7,244 words Privacy Policy: “We may use third-party


communications facilitators working on behalf of Care.com to send you marketing


communications from third party advertisers that we think may be of interest to you.”


(These are words 7,162 to 7,190 of its 7,244 word Privacy Policy — the very end.) Some


data Care.com gathers on users is number of children in a household, gender of children,


age range of children, and general data on wealth (e.g., the pay range you offer sitters).


Fake Accounts
I believe Care.com may be creating fake accounts to entice users to pay money so they can

faking job postings, however numerous complaints online and to state attorney generals

(Link to Lawsuit)


I did not find any convictions of TheLadders.com for improper conduct, but I view the


extreme amount of complaints against the TheLadders as a negative. Please note that


Care.com CEO Sheila Marcelo was not accused of any wrongdoing, but she was VP and


General Manager at TheLadders.


Misleading Investors
I believe Care.com mispresents its key user metrics and barely disclosed a recent


acquisition that is its real source of growth.


One of Care.com’s key investor metrics is the number of caregivers on its platform. In its


2017 investor presentation Care.com claimed to have “9.2 million U.S. caregivers.” To test


this claim I used Care.com’s own search tool to see how many caregivers are in each of the


25 biggest U.S. cities. The top 25 U.S. cities have about 10% of the U.S. population so you


would expect them to have about 10% of Care.com’s U.S. caregivers. As a result, my


search should yield about 920,000 profiles, but I found less than 1/5 that amount:

(Source: Slide 19 of Care.com’s most recent investor presentation)


This slide is the bull thesis on Care.com. Who wouldn’t want to own a company growing


60% per year? But there is overwhelming evidence it is misleading. Using Care.com’s own


search feature suggests less than 2 million caregivers vs Care.com’s claimed 11.8 million.


If you believe that Care.com has 15.5 million families that would represent nearly 60% of


families with children under 12 in the U.S. If there are only 3 million jobs posted how can


you have 15.5 million families? How can user metrics be growing rapidly while web traffic


is declining? Note that all four CAGRs listed in the above chart are overstated using


Care.com’s own data. For example, the growth in job applications (top right) went from


1.1 million to 62.8 million from 2008 to 2017. Care.com’s stated CAGR is 66%, when it is


actually 57%.

minutes” Care.com’s co-founder said in 2014. But if Care.com is growing so fast why


would matches become less frequent?


Town & Country acquisition (no press release, no website update, 100% of
revenue growth?)
I believe Care.com quietly acquired a staffing company and without this acquisition


revenue growth would be negative. According to page 94 of its 2017 10-K: “On January 9,


2018, we entered into an agreement with Town & Country Resources, Inc. … we acquired


certain assets for total potential consideration of $6.9 million.”


Based on my research, Care.com put out no press release for the Town & Country


acquisition, it was not mentioned in their investor presentation, and the Town & Country


website makes no mention of a relationship with Care.com. However, Care.com did


mention the acquisition in its quarterly earnings call and in its SEC filings.


Staffing companies are unique in that they typically have high amounts of revenue


relative to their market value. A typical publicly traded staffing company trades at about


1/3 revenue. Using this metric alone implies that Town & Country has annual revenue


around $21 million ($7million*3). In its Q1 press release Care.com said, “Revenue for the


first quarter of 2018 was $47.3 million, an increase of 9% from $43.4 million in the first


quarter of 2017.” This is revenue growth of $3.9 million ($47.3-$43.4=$3.9 million). But


it is perfectly possible that Care.com’s Town & Country acquisition added more than $3.9


million in revenue. In fact, my basic math implies Town & Country has quarterly revenue


of $5.25 million. This means Care.com’s organic revenue is actually declining! (Headline


growth of $3.9 million — acquisition related growth of $5.25 million = organic decline of


$1.35 million.)


Financial Analysis (Over $10 million in insider sales, Less than $15,000 in
buys)
The last time a Care.com insider bought CRCM stock was CRCM in June 2016 when a board


member bought $13,000. Over the last two years Care.com insiders sold over $10 million


in stock. Why so much insider selling and no buying? I believe it’s because Care.com’s


consumer business is starting to decline and Care.com executives know it.

In 2013, Care.com’s revenues grew 68%. In 2014, revenues grew 36%. In 2015, revenues


grew 25%. In 2016, revenues grew 17%. In 2017, revenues grew 8%. In Q1 2018 revenue


“grew” 9% (but without the acquisition I estimate revenues actually declined 3%). This is


very problematic because analysts are projecting aggressive revenue growth going


forward (Needham, the most bullish, predicts 10.3% revenue growth in 2018, and 13.1%


in 2019). Absent any new acquisitions I do not see how Care.com will make those


estimates.


One option for Care.com would be raising prices. But Care.com already raised


subscription prices nearly 30% in mid-2016 and the competition is becoming more


aggressive. Sitterycity is even on pricing with Care.com, charging $140/year, and newer


competitor UrbanSitter charges only $100/year. (It’s also worth noting that according to


Alexa Web Analytics UrbanSitter and Sittercity both have increasing web traffic over the


last year, while Care.com is declining).


Above all else, Care.com users do not like the product. According to the online review site


SiteJabber Care.com has 1.2 stars from 1,179 reviews and on review site HighYa


Care.com has 1.1 stars from 57 reviews. (SitterCity has 2.4 stars from 16 reviews on


SiteJabber, and UrbanSitter has 2.8/10 from TrustPilot).


Care.com stock is up over 300% over the last 26 months for one reason: Google. Over the


last 26 months, I believe Care.com’s fundamentals have deteriorated, revenue growth is


slowing, consumer reviews are still bad, yet the stock is up 300%+ because Google


Capital did a preferred stock deal with Care.com in June 2016.


Google is not just the largest Care.com shareholder. According to page 92 of Care.com’s


2017 10-K: “During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we recorded $1.9 million and $1.6 million


of revenue from Care@Work arrangements with Alphabet Inc. and its affiliates, respectively.


During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we incurred $12.3 million and $14.5 million of selling


and marketing expenses for internet based marketing services with Alphabet Inc. and its


affiliates, respectively.”


It is one thing to make an investment in a public company. But to make an investment in a


public company, become a >1% customer, have Care.com join your “job search” feature,


and have their advertising costs go down on your platform seems a little odd (I have no

and have their advertising costs go down on your platform seems a little odd. (I have no


evidence of wrongdoing by Google/Alphabet but I have never seen an arrangement like


this.) It’s also worth noting that Google Capital has had failed investments in the past


(e.g., Outcome Health and LendingClub).


Another indication that Care.com is in trouble is the large amount of insider selling. In


September 2017 all four major executives (CEO, CFO, CTO, & General Counsel) created


new 10b5–1 trading plans to dispose of Care.com stock. Below you can see the amount of


stock sold in the 9 months since the plan was created compared to the sales in the 12


months before it was instituted.


The bottom line is you have a company customers dislike, that uses aggressive billing


practices, that isn’t safe, and that is likely inflating important investor metrics. Quite


simply, Care.com does not deserve to trade at four times revenue and 70x profit. I believe


Care.com is desperate. That is why they did the Town & Country Acquisition. That is why


they got very aggressive with their billing practices. That is why they cut corners. And that


is why Care.com’s Co-founder and CTO called my college after I first wrote about


Care.com.

On Wednesday David Krupinski sold 10,000 shares of CRCM stock (for ~$150,000). LaterCRCM


that day Care.com raised guidance for 2018 on their earnings call.


On Thursday Mr. Krupinski sold another 10,000 shares of stock.


On Friday Mr. Krupinski sold another 20,000 shares of stock.


Since October 30th 2017, David Krupinski has sold ~200,000 shares of CRCM stock forCRCM


~$4 million. (He now owns 200,000 shares).


I believe the above facts exemplify two points. First, most Care.com shareholders are not


aware of the issues outlined in this report. That is why a board member resigned the day


after my report and his VC firm sold all its CRCM stock. Second, Care.com knows they areCRCM


in trouble. A legitimate company would ignore my report, issue a rebuttal, or contact me


directly, but I have never heard of a company contacting a student’s college. Also, Mr.


Krupinski’s stock sales were part of an automatic trading plan initiated in September


2017, however, he knew the stock sales were going to occur after he called my college and


after Care.com raised its guidance.


Conclusion
I want to be clear about what this report is and isn’t. I believe that the perception of


Care.com in the general public and public markets is wrong and I hope this report


highlights why. Others will disagree with my view. I’m sure there are thousands of people


who have used Care.com and liked it. Reports of abuse by Care.com babysitters have also


declined in recent years (meaning Care.com may be improving their practices). That said,


I believe the issues highlighted in this report are serious enough to be written publicly and


I hope they are taken seriously.

the people who are evil, but because of the people
who don’t do anything about it.” –Albert Einstein

[1] My Care.com profile was eventually taken down. Once you message a family on the


Care.com platform they can flag you. I believe this is what happened.


[2] I used a zip code in the center of each city and did an unrestricted search for caregivers


within a 10-mile radius.


Below are hyperlinks and summaries of the 1,000+ pages of consumer complaints against


Care.com I obtained via public records requests. To help navigate the documents I have


constructed the key below the summarizes the main point of each complaint and bolded


complaints I felt were particularly egregious.
