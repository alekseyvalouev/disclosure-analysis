Summary


TubeMogul’s ad view traffic dropped over 16% in February, even as industry
numbers rose 18% . This follows a 20% drop in January, as the industry rose 5.4%,
data shows.


In ad videos viewed, TubeMogul has tumbled from being 79% as large as BrightRoll
in January 2014 to about 55% in February 2015.


TubeMogul’s unique video viewers, another critical metric, declined by 10.8% in
February compared with the previous February, data shows.


Overall, TubeMogul’s video metrics are declining as the industry grows slightly.


With TubeMogul video traffic about 55% behind BrightRoll, a fair valuation of
TubeMogul stock would be about $220 million - $252 million versus current valuation
of about $400 million.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


New industry data on TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE) provides a brutal reality check for the
digital video advertising company that has recently become a Wall Street darling.


This infatuation has given TubeMogul a $400 million market valuation. But that valuation is
not supported by key industry factors defined by big-data analysis firm comScore.


The data on unique video views and ad videos viewed show that TubeMogul's
performance is falling behind the rest of the industry.


TubeMogul's ad view traffic began its downhill slide in December, falling 9%. January ad
views year-over-year dropped almost 21% and more than 16% in February.


In contrast, BrightRoll, a Yahoo (YHOO) division, enjoyed 116% growth YOY in December,
44% in January and 39 percent in February.


The trend for TubeMogul, then, has clearly been just the opposite of the industry in
December, January and February.

See various viewpoints here, and the chart below. Our chart shows key comScore data.
The data mashes month-by-month figures for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)
(NASDAQ:GOOGL), BrightRoll, AOL (NYSE:AOL), LiveRail (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)
acquisition), SpotXchange, Specific Media, Hulu, Tremor Video, Videology Inc. and
TubeMogul going back as far as June 2009.


It's also clear that, considering ad videos viewed, TubeMogul has tumbled from being 79%
as large as BrightRoll to about 55%.


BrightRoll is growing admirably. But TubeMogul is shrinking.


The following chart shows that another important indicator - ability to attract new eyeballs -
unique video viewers - has fallen significantly for TubeMogul:

Investors can see that not only have actual numbers dropped each month from December
through February, but unique video viewers declined by 10.8% in February compared with
the previous February.


Though conventional wisdom suggests TubeMogul stock can't really be valuated, the
charts suggest a reasonable means of getting to a fair valuation. Considering that
TubeMogul comes in at about 55 to 63% of BrightRoll's size, rather than a $400 million
valuation, a reasonable valuation would be about $220 million to $252 million.


Wall Street may be raising an admiring eyebrow at TubeMogul, but the numbers reveal the
company's ugly little secrets: The industry is somewhat growing while TubeMogul appears
to be shrinking.
