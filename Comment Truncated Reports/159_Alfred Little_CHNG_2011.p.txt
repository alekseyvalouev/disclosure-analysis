China Natural Gas Again Delays its LNG Production Prompting

China Natural Gas's (OTC:CHNG) long delayed new LNG facility appears to be further
delayed, according to a note out today by analysts who visited the plant on January 25th.
Roth Capital as a result downgraded CHNG to "Sell" and cut their price target to $4.50, or
6X their $0.76 FY11 EPS estimate. Roth estimated an additional 2-3 quarter delays in
LNG production as well as the fact CHNG has not secured any major customers as
reasons for their downgrade, noting that the project is at least 18 months behind schedule.


Incredibly, CHNG management has not issued any press release to announce the
significant additional delay to its LNG production. In fact as recently as December 1, 2010,
CHNG stated in a press release (here) announcing a supply agreement for its LNG plant
that it expected to complete Phase I of the plant before the end of the year. 


Since that press release, there have been more significant signs of trouble with CHNG's
governance: On December 23, 2010, CHNG disclosed in an 8-K its CFO, David She, had
been replaced by Shaocheng "Bode" Xu. Then on December 6, 2010, CHNG disclosed in
an 8-K it had replaced its auditor, Frazer Frost, LLP with Friedman LLP. 


In addition, on November 25th, 2010, CHNG disclosed in an 8-K that independent director
Carl Yeung had resigned.
