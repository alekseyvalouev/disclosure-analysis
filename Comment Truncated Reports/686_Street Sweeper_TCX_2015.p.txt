Tucows: Why Its New Internet Business Will Hand Investors A Cow PattyTucows


by Sonya Colberg, Senior Editor - 8/3/2015 9:53:21 AM


You’ve almost gotta love Tucows (NASDAQ: Tucows TCX) for its humor, as demonstrated by the company reportedly
taking a real cow to a conference, plus its depiction of two cows in its logo:


But the negatives inherent in Tucows’ business plan utterly outweigh its funny personality.Tucows


The stock for this Toronto, Canada-based domain name registrar and wireless service provider has been running
wild and crazy the past two months. Indeed, Tucows jumped over the moon at $32 on July 21 and then beganTucows
declining somewhat. The stock is now on the brink of turning around and trampling investors before they can
jump out of its path.


Before Tucows hooks another one, check out our executive summary briefly describing the top reasons we thinkTucows
Tucows’ stock price is ready to drop.Tucows


*Executive Summary


*Troubled Trio – The company reports two operating segments - domain services, consisting of domain name
registration, and network access services, consisting of both retail mobile phones/services and Internet service
over fiber networks. Tucows faces growing challenges in all areas.Tucows


*Faltering Fiber – The stock rallied on announcements of Tucows’ entry into the Internet business. But TucowsTucows Tucows
lacks the multi-millions to build a fiber network. And our research shows the Ting fiber business won’t produce
meaningful revenue now … and probably not ever.


*Yelling “Sell!” – Insiders have been hitting the sell button on Tucows’ stock.Tucows


*Crumbling Core - Tucows’ core Internet domain name business is flat and poised for further decline. TheTucows
business has become vastly more competitive and commoditized, so customers buy principally on price.  


*Withering Wireless - Tucows’ “Ting Mobile” wireless business provided growth in 2013 and 2014. But that growthTucows
is slowing now. And a Sprint policy-change hurt Ting and promises long-term negative consequences even as
wireless becomes commoditized.


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper’s request for comment, but investors may find other
viewpoints here.


*Faltering Fiber


Our research shows Tucows’ new, much-hyped Internet fiber service offers merely a pittance of the revenueTucows
apparently expected by the market.


“I think the people who own the stock right now don’t know what they own,” an analyst told TheStreetSweeper.
“The stock’s going up and they’re perpetuating this story of fiber.”


We agree. So, let’s look at why Tucows’ Internet fiber potential is poised to evaporate. Tucows   


Only two cities – Westminster, Maryland and Charlottesville, Virginia – have announced that Tucows will offerTucows
Internet service. While information is too sketchy to estimate potential revenue for Charlottesville, our analysis
indicates the fiber revenue will amount to only about $362,000 per quarter for Westminster.


In Westminster – population 18,590 - the city began a publicly funded project last fall to string out 60 miles of
fiber optics through the little northern Maryland community.  The pilot project’s first phase is designed to offer
faster Internet service to residents in one neighborhood and businesses near the local airport.


Tucows’ Ting recently secured a 2-year exclusive Tucows contract to provide Internet service through the fiber network.

5/23/2018 TheStreetSweeper - Tucows Why Its New Internet Business Will Hand Investors A Cow Patty


http://thestreetsweeper.org/undersurveillance/Tucows__Why_Its_New_Internet_Business_Will_Hand_Investors_A_Cow_Patty 2/6


The city funded the $6 million first phase through the bond market. Building the remaining three to four phases is
expected to take another three years or so and to cost another $9 million … So a question mark hangs before this
little town. Where to get the remaining $9 million?


Even if the entire city does gets access to the fiber network, the opportunity in Westminster is unfortunately tiny -
even if Tucows’ Ting sold service to every single man, woman and child in town.Tucows


Apparently no Westminster customers have actually received service so far. But let’s model an extremely unlikely
situation in which every household and every business in Westminster purchased Tucows service.Tucows


The table below shows revenue in the unrealistic scenario in which each one of the 7,161 households in
Westminster and all 131 of its businesses sign up for one of Tucows’ price plans:Tucows


(Source: US Census Bureau, Tucows, westgov.com)Tucows


Keep in mind that residents would sign up for either the $19 or $89 residential plan and the businesses would
subscribe to the $139 business plan.


*Moooving Forward – Potential Declines


If 100 percent of Westminster signed on with Tucows, the company would Tucows gross a maximum of ~$7.8 million per
year.


But we know this: Not everyone will subscribe.


So let’s assume Tucows gets wildly lucky and signs on 100 percent of businesses and 25 percent of households.Tucows


The chart below shows how much we estimate Tucows would put in the piggy bank in the first year under thatTucows
terrifically optimistic scenario.





(Source: Ting.com)


We assume the same 50-50 revenue split between the city as network owner and Tucows as service provider that isTucows
seen in the cell phone business. And … Yikes! Tucows’ gross margin squeezes down the already-paltry revenue toTucows
just $1.45 million for the whole year!


*Watch Your Step In Tucows Country - Charlottesville Poised to DisappointTucows


The potential in Charlottesville, Virginia appears rather trivial for Tucows, too.Tucows


The fiber infrastructure had been started for the 45,000 folks in Charlottesville when Tucows stepped in late lastTucows
year, bought the hometown Internet service provider and infrastructure builder, BlueRidge InternetWorks, and
announced Charlottesville would be the first city to be offered Ting’s Internet service.


Armed with little more than its 2012 wireless acquisition, Ting, and a reputation for selling domain names (even
earning a spot on the US government’s “Notorious Markets” report amid a complaint Tucows failed to act whenTucows
notified that fake online pharmacies used Tucows’ domain names), Tucows now faces established big bulls in town,Tucows Tucows
Comcast and CenturyLink.   


Unfortunately, Tucows has Tucows not announced a single commercial service agreement thus far. In fact, this fiber roll-
out map and this explanation that the initial plan is to reach 12,000 homes indicate that Tucows’ initial roll-outTucows
apparently will not serve the University of Virginia – which should have been Tucows’ most desirable targetTucows
customer at 20,000 students strong.

http://thestreetsweeper.org/undersurveillance/Tucows__Why_Its_New_Internet_Business_Will_Hand_Investors_A_Cow_Patty 3/6


Let’s watch our step here in Tucows country. A carefully crafted Tucows press release suggests that Tucows is somehow onTucows
par with gigabit-per-second giants AT&T and Comcast.


The press release says:


"I am thrilled with how the network and the service are coming along and delighted for the people of
Charlottesville, but I am not at all pleased with the timing of this press release," grumbled Elliot Noss, CEO of
Tucows and Ting. "AT&T and Comcast have managed to get press releases out years before their Gigabit servicesTucows
have come to market. Ours comes over a week after launch. We clearly need to pick it up a notch."


But, according to the Ting blog designed to keep Charlottesville informed about the fiber rollout, things are going
very slowly. It appears that only three streets have been lit up after several months. It’s tough to scale up.


Going forward, a big problem is that Tucows will be hard-pressed to fund the super-expensive process of diggingTucows
up the earth and laying the rest of the fiber through the entire town.


So it’s left with simply trying to be an Internet service provider in a limited area unless it can craft a deal with the
city – likely difficult considering the AT&T and Comcast presence - or unless it does something like offer a massive
capital raise that would dilute current shareholders’ stock value.


Despite Tucows’ braggadocio, AT&T and Comcast resources easily stomp Tucows’ resources into the dirt.Tucows Tucows
Inadequate bucks means Tucows can’t develop significant fiber networks or market the service.Tucows


Absent sufficient fiber network and good marketing, Tucows’ fledgling fiber business shrivels to just about zero.Tucows


*Running Bulls Ready To Stumble


The stock began to bolt after the first quarter financials released May 7 showed $2.8 million in profit.


When the Charlottesville and Westminster fiber deals were announced June 15 and June 26, Tucows sharesTucows
continued to run up like a bull in a china shop.

As the weeks and public relations hype ticked by, the share price ran jaggedly upward as investors bought the well-
crafted hype.


One day the company’s market valuation was ~$200 million. A month later, the valuation exceeded $300 million.


So who was buying at these elevated levels? Well, it sure wasn’t insiders.


Some company leaders were selling thousands of shares of their company. Co-chairman of the Board Rawleigh
Ralls sold 65,000 shares in May alone.


And right around the corner, more insiders had their fingers resting on the “sell” button.


*Where’s The Bull? Insiders Yell “Sell!”


Indeed, with 26 sells in the last year – and 14 just in the last three months - company officers and directors have
stayed busy unloading their stock.

One glance at the graphic below shows the insider trading trend – no buying for some time and even then, the
meager buys were cheap option executions.


(Source: Nasdaq.com)


So, are these insiders beginning to worry that the stock price has peaked?


And with the price at current levels, how soon will they dump more stock?


*Withering Wireless


Tucows bought Ting in 2012 and its “Ting Mobile” wireless business provided good growth in 2013 and 2014.Tucows
However, growth is slowing and the many well-known competitors make for tough going.


Unfortunately, Sprint’s policy change made things worse. Sprint’s February 15 change to the criteria for devices
eligible to activate with Ting Mobile caused much frustration, dropped new accounts and remains an issue going
forward, according to comments during the May 7 earnings call by CEO Elliot Noss:


“… an alarming 70% of devices that people were trying to activate on Ting Mobile were rejected, including many
devices that were perfectly eligible by all stated criteria. We worked hard with Sprint over the next several weeks to
identify errors in the process and correct them, leading to the number of rejections falling to 30%. There are still a
couple of outstanding issues and we continue to work with Sprint to address them.”


The number of new accounts last quarter dropped to ~9,000, while Mr. Noss said 10,000-12,000 is normal. Fewer
than 16,000 devices were added in the quarter, while 16,000 to 18,000 is the norm.


Investors cannot afford to be naïve about this issue. Mr. Noss said:


“There was a rippling effect on our acquisitions. Customers were frustrated about wasted purchases and confused
about how to find an eligible device going forward.”

We believe Sprint’s change in policy constitutes more than a temporary setback. Frustrated customers will throw
up their hands over Ting Mobile. Word will spread.


Indeed, the Sprint policy damages much of Tucows’ opportunity in this field. The time is right for well-heeledTucows
giants in the mobile phone and services field who will happily scoop up Ting’s old customers, as well as potential
future customers.


*Crumbling Core


Tucows has been trying to reinvent itself with the fiber and mobile businesses because its legacy domain nameTucows
business has been declining … essentially butted by technology giants like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) along with the heavily advertised, April public offering, GoDaddy.


Check out this chart comparing revenue and advertising expenses for GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY) and Tucows.Tucows


(Sources: GoDaddy SEC filings; Tucows Tucows SEC filings)


Quarterly revenue from Tucows’ prepaid domain name registry and associated service fees dropped to Tucows $1.46
million last quarter versus $1.82 million for the same period in 2014. Since then, Google has stepped into this
highly commoditized domain business and can undercut Tucows’ prices.Tucows


Here’s what Tucows’ chief financial officer said in the May earnings call:Tucows


“Breaking Domain Services down into its various revenue streams gross margin for the wholesale component of
Domain Services decreased by $144,000 or 3% to $5.3 million, when compared to the first quarter of last
year. This decrease was primarily due to the $420,000 decrease in revenue from the sale of names and pay per
click advertising advertisings through the OpenSRS domain expiry stream.


“As we've discussed on past calls, revenue associated with name sales and advertising has been experiencing flat
to declining trends which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. This decrease was partially
offset by an increase in gross margin from domain name services of $200,000, largely the result of the benefit we
are continuing to experience from a shift in sales mix to higher margin services.”


On a yearly basis, revenue for domain name services fell to $111.78 million in 2014 from $113.40 million in 2013.


So the Tucows domain biz took a chilly $1.6 million plunge in Tucows 2014.


*Conclusion


According to CEO Noss, Ting fiber is not going to produce “what I would call meaningful revenue … through much
of the bulk of this year.” Regarding Ting Internet fiber revenue, he further advised the two analysts in the
conference call, “in terms of meaningful for this year, I wouldn’t think twice about it.”


Our research indicates the potential revenue for fiber is even worse than described and likely will never even
approach becoming meaningful. Fiber revenue won't save Tucows from the faltering domain name business or theTucows
commoditized, risk-filled wireless business.


So Tucows can hype the promise of tomorrow until the cows come home… but we think the market valuation willTucows
drop well below the current $293 million. We’re slapping a $13 price target on this little ol’ bovine.
