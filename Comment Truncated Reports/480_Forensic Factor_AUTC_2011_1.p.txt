AutoChina (AUTC)
- The Most
Preposterous
Chinese Reverse
Merger Yet

AutoChina (AUTC) - The Most Preposterous Chinese Reverse Merger
Yet








The recent onslaught of media coverage focused on Chinese reverse mergers
has finally started to illuminate one of Wall Street's darkest, and most
dangerous, corners. The fallout from the accusations (and confessions) of
accounting irregularities and potential fraud has been single-digit "earnings"
multiples, increased regulatory scrutiny, painful investor losses, and high levels
of disdain towards most Chinese reverse mergers.





One company that has somehow managed to avoid scrutiny until now is
AutoChina (NASDAQ: AUTC). However, after a deep dive into AutoChina, The
Forensic Factor ("TFF") has concluded that AutoChina is potentially the most
dangerous Chinese reverse merger that we have examined. As the AutoChina
story gets exposed, we would expect a significant share decline of at least
50% and a material increase in the short interest (incredibly, less than 1% of
the shares are short - a true rarity among the Chinese reverse mergers). TFF
believes investors would be prudent to avoid AutoChina at all costs. At the
same time, we implore regulators to protect the investing public and launch an
investigation into AutoChina. This report, Part I of II that we will publish on
AutoChina, will highlight the following issues:

An extensive use of the same gain-on-sale accounting that led to the entire
sub-prime industry blowing up. As we will discuss, AutoChina's accounting
methods were dubbed "Crack Cocaine Accounting" by Bloomberg in a story
on the sub-prime lenders
A mockery of U.S. GAAP accounting, resulting in massively overstated
revenue and earnings that should not be relied upon by investors
A harrowing $450 million discrepancy between operating cash flow and net
income over the past six quarters
A labyrinthine org structure and a reliance on related party debt that has
become the primary funding source for the core business
The largest funding source for the company's auto loans appears to be a
related party operator of grocery stores called Beiguo Commercial Building
Limited
The most dilutive, and shareholder unfriendly, earnout that we have ever
seen. The perverse earnout has potentially incentivized management to use
logic-defying accounting to drive specious revenues and earnings
A misunderstood market capitalization based upon future earnout shares
that do NOT appear to be included in sellside models
Massive expense understatement and large related party payables
A CFO that was previously the Director of Research at a firm that turned
out to be one of the largest ponzi schemes in U.S. History
A new auditor that will need to address the issues and questions raised by
TFF in this report - a process that could be the impetus for a large
accounting restatement





Accounting Dramatically Overstates Income, Restatement Likely


Before delving into an accounting schematic that we thought had died with the
subprime debacle, it is worth mentioning the unusual birth of AutoChina. The
operating company is located in China, but the holding company is
incorporated in the Cayman Islands [we will explore the unusual corporate
structure later illustrating a similar structure to Rino International (pink
sheets: RINO)]. AutoChina came public in April 2009 in a reverse merger with
Spring Creek Acquisition Corp. At the time of the merger, the company's
primary operations were new and used car lots in China. Just a few quarters

after the reverse merger was consummated, the core business was disposed of
(12/09) so that the company could focus on leasing commercial vehicles. This
unusual change in corporate strategy was quite a gamble at the time, given
the leasing business had a history of less than one year, "ACG's commercial
vehicle sales, servicing and leasing segment has only been operating since
2008, and after the sale of our automotive dealership business is the only
business we operate" (http://google.brand.edgar-
online.com/DisplayFiling.aspx?
TabIndex=2&FilingID=7139746&companyid=762060&ppu=%252fdefault.aspx
%253fsym%253dAUTC).





The leasing business is relatively easy to understand: they find a truck buyer,
order and buy the truck, provide the financing, and then lease the truck at a
marked-up value. The high level leasing concept is where the straightforward
ends and where the mysterious begins. Simple arithmetic suggests the
numbers that AutoChina provides in its financial statements are nonsensical.
The company's 2010 guidance is $600 million to $650 million of revenue on
12,000 to 13,000 "leased" vehicles. This equates to exactly $50,000 of
revenue per vehicle. Reported revenue per transaction of $50,000 per vehicle
would seem to represent a sale rather than a "lease." On page 28 of their
investor presentation
(http://edg1.vcall.com/irwebsites/autochinaintl/Autochina_December2010.pdf)
, AutoChina outlines the economics of a typical lease, which includes $48,000
of total collections over the life of a lease (26 months) and $38,000 for the
cost of the truck. The difference is shown as the $10,000 of gross profit
potential (before SG&A and interest expense) over 26 months.

However, TFF believes AUTC is actually recognizing almost all of the potential
profits upfront. For example, in the third quarter 2010 AUTC recognized over
$8,000 of gross profit for each new vehicle it leased
(sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/0001...).

TFF believes this is an extremely aggressive form of accounting. In fact, this
accounting treatment is nearly identical to the "non-cash gain on sale"
accounting popularized by the subprime mortgage industry before they all
went bankrupt. A prominent story by Bloomberg described this
accounting method as the financial world's equivalent of "Crack
Cocaine" (http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?
pid=newsarchive&sid=aIOWGBzzWpNo). This form of non-GAAP accounting
generates substantial "paper" income but significantly overstates and
misrepresents economic income. While AutoChina's sales-type lease
accounting generates 60% to 80% upfront profits, it is important to compare
this to the actual cash flows of a loan. According to the example below (Table
3), AUTC does not get to breakeven cash flow until month 22 of a 26 month

lease!!! Even if the company did not have to finance its leases, it would still
take 20 months to breakeven. Keep in mind this analysis does not even
include any overhead costs, costs for collections, or potential defaults that
would push the average breakeven out even farther.

This unsavory and alarming dynamic of reporting positive "accounting" profits
despite enormously negative cash flow is obvious when comparing AutoChina's
cash flow from operations to its net income. The company has blown through
$384 million of operating cash flow over the past six quarters. This is amazing
considering reported net income was $69 million over the same period. The
discrepancy between the CFO and the reported earnings is a staggering $450
million over that same timeframe
(www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/...). AutoChina's inexplicable
delta between operating cash flow and net income is one of the more alarming
statistics that TFF has ever uncovered.

To be absolutely certain that AutoChina was an anomaly with regard to its
overly-aggressive accounting, we examined other leasing models. TFF could
not find one public U.S. company that utilized the same aggressive accounting
treatment for their main business. Every U.S. leasing company that TFF
evaluated (including GMT, MGRC and TAL), used straight line accounting
methods. If AUTC used straight line accounting that recognized revenue over
26 months, the income statement would be materially lower. Table 5 presents
the amortization schedule other leasing companies would use for a typical
AUTC lease. As Table 5 illustrates, in the first three months of the lease, the
company would recognize just under $1,600 in interest revenue offset by
interest expense (~$400 at 6% interest rate). This would equate to $1,200 of
net interest margin. Even if the company recognized a $2,000 upfront mark-up
gain (which we believe should also be amortized), AUTC would still be
overstating the first three months of revenue on a new lease by a whopping
92.5% while overstating gross profit by almost 60%.

AutoChina's "non-cash gain on sale" accounting would not be as ridiculous if
they also accrued for loan losses. As TFF dug through the disclosures and
assumptions behind AutoChina's loans, we were shocked to see zero accruals
for losses. By recognizing 60% to 80% of profits upfront, almost all of the
potential profit is recognized immediately. A consequence of this policy is
future credit losses will provide a huge downside surprise (reversal of
recognized gains, costs of repossession, and loss on collateral). TFF believes
this concern is quite relevant given the recent jump in delinquent accounts
relative to the minuscule provision for loan losses. In fact, TFF believes
AutoChina has only reserved $1.1 million against $410 million in loans.
According to SEC filings, over 4.25% of AutoChina's loans were delinquent as
of September 30, 2010. This deteriorating loan book paints a different picture
than the paltry reserve that represents less than 0.27% of the total lease
portfolio (see Table 6) (sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/0001...).
Management has claimed that they have experienced less than 20 defaults
(versus 20,000 leases) and cumulative losses of roughly 15 basis points
(http://www.investorcalendar.com/IC/CEPage.asp?ID=161965). TFF believes
this defies all conventional logic. But then again, TFF is using the same
financial logic that would NEVER place delinquent loans into accounts
receivable on the balance sheet (during the company's most recent earnings
call management confessed to this uncommon treatment of delinquent loans -
http://www.investorcalendar.com/IC/CEPage.asp?ID=161965). TFF was almost
as shocked to hear this statement, as we were when we heard the
unbelievably low loss frequency and severity.

Given the myriad of related party transactions and checkered history of
management (see below), TFF is extremely skeptical about AutoChina's claims
of pristine credit quality. Compounding our concerns towards credit is the
company's initiative to provide financing for fuel, tires, and insurance. The lack
of collateral associated with these unsecured loans should justify higher loan
loss reserves. Despite an extensive search, TFF has not been able to find
another leasing company that provides loans for diesel. TFF wonders why a
customer base as healthy as AutoChina's would need loans to buy diesel fuel
and tiresâ€¦.. perhaps it's a question, along with many others, that the new
auditors will flesh out.

Regional accounting firm Crowe Horwath was the company's auditor for fiscal
2009. TFF finds this odd because Crowe Horwath didn't even form its Chinese
business until September 2009 (http://www.chcncpa.com/english.asp). For the
fiscal year just completed, Big 4 accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers will
be performing the year-end audit. While this may appear promising, TFF would
use Duoyuan Printing (NYSE: DYP) as a cautionary tale for AUTC investors. In
2010, DYP switched from a regional accounting firm to Deloitte. When Deloitte
began the audit, troubling accounting discrepancies were discovered. When
these issues came to light, DYP's shares dropped over 62% in just three days
(http://goingconcern.com/2010/09/duoyuan-printing-is-all-kinds-of-screwed-
up-after-firing-deloitte/). We have prepared a number of questions and
concerns for PwC to address as they begin their work in February for their first
audit. Given the issues above (and below), TFF would not be surprised if
AutoChina restates its financial results.





The Organizational Chart - Not that much to say


If Sherlock Holmes was looking for a challenge, we would ask him to decipher
the baffling ownership structure that is a hallmark of AutoChina. This
convoluted chart illustrates the inherent complexity and risk in the ownership
structure of AutoChina

An article in China Economic Review provides a good description of AUTC's
corporate structure: "In April 2009, Spring Creek acquired ACG, a Cayman
company owned by Honest Best, and changed its name to AutoChina
International. ACG was formerly KYF, Inc, a holding company set up in 2007
by the CEO of AutoChina, Li Yong Hui. ACG operates three subsidiaries:
Kaiyuan Logistics, Kaiyuan Auto Trade, and Hebei Xuhua Trading. All are
owned by Hebei Kaiyuan Real Estate Development, a company founded in
2005 by Li"
(www.chinaeconomicreview.com/stock_profile/sinosage/2010_05_12/AutoChin
a_running_on_empty.html).





TFF can not overstate the risks that this type of structure presents for
investors. We invite investors to compare AutoChina's org chart with the org
chart of another well known Chinese reverse r

****Sometimes two nearly identical pictures are more powerful than
all of the forensic analysis in the world.





3 for 1: A Notorious Earnout, Perverse Incentives, and more
accounting issues


The org structure above is complimented by one of the LEAST shareholder
friendly earnout agreements that TFF has ever reviewed. This earnout
arrangement was initially developed under the reverse-takeover agreement.
According to AutoChina's 20-F, the earnout stipulates that the public company
will pay the CEO "between 5 and 20%" of the total shares outstanding
annually as an "earnout." Literally, shareholders will be diluted by at least 5%
every single year, regardless of performance. The earnout is scaled based
upon the level of growth achieved in that year (obviously it is not based upon
cash flow) (sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/0001...). In early 2010,
AUTC issued CEO Li over 2.6 million shares, diluting existing shareholders by
the maximum amount of twenty percent. Shockingly, this vulpine program is in
place until 2013. With the maximum issuance, AUTC could give Mr. Li an
additional 19.5 million shares over the next three years, which would dilute
shareholders by roughly 50% (only 20.3 million outstanding at 9/30/2010 -
www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/...). This might be one of the
most lopsided compensation packages ever offered to an executive.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/134750-autochina-autc-the-most-preposterous-chinese-reverse-merger-yet 14/27





TFF believes this massive future dilution is not currently reflected in AUTC's
stock price. In a perverse twist, should AutoChina actually hit analyst
expectations, then the sellside price targets would be off by 50% (double the
shares out). On a fully diluted basis, AutoChina's market cap could double to
$1.1 billion over the next few years with the stock price remaining flat. For the
company to maintain its same valuation, the stock price would need to decline
by 50% (forget the fact for a moment that TFF believes the current "E" is
extremely unreliable).





What is perhaps most worrisome about the earnout is that the financial metric
of choice is "reported" EBITDA growth (not on a per share basis). TFF does not
understand why more shareholder friendly metrics like return on equity, free
cash flow, or even EBITDA per share were not used instead. This benchmark
for the earnout incentivizes Mr. Li to pursue the most aggressive earnings and
revenue recognition policies.





Finally, this stock compensation expense appears to be hidden from investors
and is not reflected in the company's income statement. After examining FASB
guidelines, TFF believes these earnouts should be expensed through the
income statement and are not currently treated in accordance with GAAP.


Although there is some ambiguity, FASB has provided a framework for
expensing earnouts. According to EITF 95-8, "situations in which employee
compensation other than the contingent payments is at a reasonable level in
comparison to that of other key employees in the combined enterprise may
indicate that the contingent payments are additional purchase price rather
than compensation" (72.3.243.42/pdf/abs95-8.pdf). Further, if the "substance
of some agreements for contingent consideration is to provide compensation
for servicesâ€¦the additional consideration should be accounted for as
expenses." According to the proxy statement, Young Hui Li has received only
$1.00 in salary and no bonus or other compensation in the last fiscal year. This
level of compensation would clearly be defined as well below "other key
employees"

_ex99-1.htm). As a result, it is clear to TFF that the earnout should be
considered "compensation" expense under U.S. GAAP. The value of stock
issued to Li in 2010 was over $57 million. If this was expensed appropriately,
AUTC would show negative pretax earnings in 2010
(www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/...). The company could issue
over 3.6 million shares in early 2011 to fulfill the earnout, representing almost
$100 million of potential expense in 2011. Instead, this massive dilution and
expense will never even hit the income statement based upon AutoChina's
renegade accounting.





TFF believes a salient question is why exactly are shareholders compensating
the CEO with this extremely generous earnout? If China Economic Review is
correct and "each truck financing subsidiary is held by a separate legal entity
owned by Kaiyuan Auto Trade â€“ which is owned by Li, not by AutoChina"
(www.chinaeconomicreview.com/stock_profile/sinosage/2010_05_12/AutoChin
a_running_on_empty.html), then the earnout compensation would appear to
exist so the CEO does not walk away from AUTC? If that is the case, then the
earnout is unquestionably an expense. But a more concerning reality for AUTC
shareholders is that based on the org structure it appears equity owners in
AutoChina do NOT own the operating companies.





Should PwC agree with TFF and force AutoChina to expense the earnouts,
shareholders would suffer dramatically based on two recent examples. Shares
of CNInsure (NASDAQ: CISG), declined over 25% in a month when a report
from OLP Global highlighted the "company's sales incentive program is actually
an equity incentive plan that should be, but currently isn't, reflected in the
company's expenses" www.fool.com/investing/general/2010/12/02/cninsure-
shares-plunged-what-you-need-to-know.aspx. The mistreatment of earnout
accounting and subsequent restatement drove Huron Consulting (NASDAQ:
HURN) down over 70% (https://seekingalpha.com/article/153334-the-
spectacular-blow-up-of-huron-consulting). TFF believes earnout accounting will
be ANOTHER issue driving the need for a restatement at AUTC.

AutoChina's atrocious cash flow characteristics (see Table 4 above) result in an
incessant need for new capital. This need for capital has created an
"un"virtuous cycle for management in order to keep the game going. Since the
company recognizes most of its profits upfront before they are ever earned,
the only way to grow is through additional originations. However, to drive
incremental originations, the company needs debt and equity capital. Because
raising capital from U.S. investors would require opening the kimono,
AutoChina has relied on prodigious levels of related party debt.





Since the company's inception, the largest provider of debt to AutoChina has
been an entity called Beiguo Commercial Building Limited. TFF was shocked to
discover that this legitimate sounding financial entity is actually a PRC-based
operator of grocery stores owned by the CEO of AutoChina
(http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/hebei/shijiazhuang/shopping/)
and (google.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/ED...). But their grocery-store
partner is just one of many strange bedfellows. AUTC's complicated web of
related party debt financing has fluctuated wildly in recent periods, but
represented a whopping $126 million at September 30, 2010. Based on TFF's
analysis, we believe the actual number is closer to $865 million of transactions
funded by related entities through the first nine months of 2010. (page 27,
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1417370/000114420410063155/v20
3555_6k.htm).


This reliance on related party transactions and debt can often be associated
with unscrupulous activity and/or exchanges which are clearly not arms length
in nature. The sheer volume and magnitude of related party activity is very
suspicious:

Who was the CFO's old boss?
5/19/2018 AutoChina (AUTC) - The Most Preposterous Chinese Reverse Merger Yet - The Forensic Factor | Seeking Alpha

Guilt by association is dangerous and often times unfair. At the same time, if
you are the CFO of a Chinese reverse merger, any questions from your past
must be properly vetted. TFF wonders how well AutoChina's CFO was
scrutinized given a checkered past that revolves around a massive fraud that
was perpetrated by his former employer.





According to SPAC Update, AutoChina hired Jason Wang as CFO in July 2009,
stating that he was "formerly a senior member of Private Equity Management
(PEM) Group"


(http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y-
QgkKIp1fQJ:spacupdate.com/index.php%3Farticle%3D186+%22a+senior+me
mber+of+Private+Equity+Management%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us).
According to his bio, Mr. Wang was the Director of Research at PEMGroup.
PEMGroup turned out to be one of the largest ponzi schemes in U.S. history,
milking investors for a reported $800 million. New York Magazine christened
PEMGroup as the "Most Insane Alleged Fraud of 2009," quite an
accomplishment given the competition that year
(http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/04/and_the_title_for_most_insane.html).





PEMGroup was founded and run by the legendary fraudster and suspected
murderer Danny Pang
(http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123976601469019957.html). According to an
SEC lawsuit, PEMGroup demonstrated "a persistent pattern of abuse" that
began in 2007 and "continued through Mr. Pang's stepping down in April 2009"
(http://images.ocregister.com/newsimages/2009/05/08/PangReceiver2009050
6.pdf). While it is probably a mere coincidence, Jason Wang joined PEM Group
in 2007 - the year the SEC alleges the abuses began in earnest. According to
the SEC, PEMGroup's "spending spree was funded by new monies coming in,
giving rise to the claim of a Ponzi scheme." To be clear, regardless of any
perceived similarities, TFF is NOT comparing AutoChina's incessant need for
new capital to fuel its growth to a ponzi scheme. The SEC complaint provides
several anecdotes detailing the culture of PEMGroup, including:

Â·         A time when management "recovered $4 million from a former
employee who had been embezzling" from the company's funds. Once
recovered, rather than paying this back to the Tranches, Mr. Pang reportedly
divided it up amongst senior management."


Â·         "In the troubled year of 2007, the staff was treated to a $1.5 million
trip to China"


Â·         "In December 2008 and with many of the loans in the investment
portfolio in defaultâ€¦Mr. Pang provided his entire staff with a cruise on a Disney
boat at an expense of $1.0 million."





TFF has no reason to suspect Mr. Wang was anything but above board. And for
the record, Mr. Wang was not accused of any wrongdoing. But the SEC's
observation that "PEMG's senior management appears to have provided little
opposition and in many instances facilitated the spending schemes" was
disconcerting because Mr. Wang was labeled a "senior member" of PEMG by
SPAC Update
(http://images.ocregister.com/newsimages/2009/05/08/PangReceiver2009050
6.pdf). Also, The Wall Street Journal and New York Magazine point out Pang
was quite open about the fraudulent activity at the firm. According to one
employee, "Pang came into his office and said: 'Nasar, I want you to know we
are in a Ponzi scheme"
(http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/04/and_the_title_for_most_insane.html).
While at PEMGroup, Mr. Wang may have been oblivious to the fraud, but his
responsibilities did include "analysis of prospective investments, credit and
cash flow analysis, and valuations. He was involved in both equity and debt
investments."
(www.autochinaintl.com/en/InvestorNews/AutoChina_International_Limited_A
ppoints_New_Chief_Financial_Officer/). According to the SEC's complaint,
PEMGroup's employee base was very small, consisting of "approximately 30
individuals"
(http://images.ocregister.com/newsimages/2009/05/08/PangReceiver2009050
6.pdf). Given the small number of employees, the scale of the fraud, Danny
Pang's documented openness, and Mr. Wang's considerable responsibilities,
TFF believes it would be natural for investors to revisit how the Board vetted

Mr. Wang prior to being appointment CFO. [TFF Note - In September 2009,
just prior to his trial, PEMGroup founder Danny Pang committed suicide. As a
result of his death, the SEC dropped its case against Pang and PEMGroup]





While we have no reason to think Mr. Wang was involved in the Ponzi scheme,
TFF believes Mr. Wang's resume has had inconsistencies, a problem his old
boss Danny Pang had as well. Mr. Pang alleged he was an investment banker
at Morgan Stanley and got his MBA from the University of California at Irvine.
Both of these statements were lies (gawker.com/5231292/danny-pangs-last-
gamble). Turning to Mr. Wang, AutoChina's financial filings state that Mr. Wang
received "Bachelors degrees from both the Wharton School and the School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania in May
1994" (http://google.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?
FetchFilingHtmlSection1?SectionID=6706146-1058-
11246&SessionID=XcKRHWLzxztZAl7). However, on AutoChina's webpage, Mr.
Wang's date of graduation is different by four years, "Mr. Wang received
Bachelors degrees from both the Wharton School and the School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania in May
1998" (http://www.autochinaintl.com/en/Investor/Officers/). If would appear
from the first set of dates in AutoChina's SEC filings that Mr. Wang graduated
from Wharton at the age of 18 - if so, kudos to him. Either way, the
inconsistencies are a small drop in an overflowing bucket of questions relating
to AutoChina.





So how could so many problems at one company go unnoticed by the sellside
analysts that follow it? TFF does not believe that the analysts are in cahoots
with the company, but instead have no base of knowledge to cover this type of
business model. TFF could only find two analysts that actively cover
AutoChina, one from Chardan Capital and one from Rodman & Renshaw (the
same reverse merger juggernaut that Barron's has been so critical towards).
From what TFF can surmise, the Chardan analyst is a technology analyst who
covers a universe of tech companies such as Skyworth, EZChip, and Tower
Semi. In fairness to him, it is extremely unlikely he has ever seen lease
accounting before. The second analyst from Rodman covers an eclectic basket
of Chinese names, ranging from battery manufacturers to recycling

companies. TFF believes that AutoChina is the only finance company that
either of these analysts follows. So despite being ill-equipped to analyze lease
accounting, we fully expect both analysts to support AutoChina all of the way
down. Why? Chardan Capital and Rodman were recently selected to underwrite
a new SPAC called Prime Acquisition. This new SPAC's CEO and Chairman is
none other than AutoChina's CEO, Yong Hui Li
(http://247wallst.com/2011/01/21/blast-from-the-past-china-spac-ipo-filing-
pacq-autc/).








TFF believes that when the dust settles, AutoChina will be a single digit stock.
As of January 24, 2011, the 72 companies in Roth Capital's Chinese
Investment Universe Publication traded at 7.7x earnings. If AutoChina simply
traded inline with the broad Chinese universe, it would be $14 per share based
upon consensus estimates. Taking into consideration the possible 50% dilution,
the stock would be closer to $7.00 with an inline multiple to the peer group.
However, given the quantity of issues that TFF has discussed, it would seem
logical that investors would value AUTC at a discount to its peer group
(assuming the earnings do not vanish in a restatement). TFF would point out
that should bad debt increase, or funding dry up, there are ample scenarios
where AUTC equity could go to zero. We believe the serious issues TFF has
raised warrant investor skepticism. It is the opinion of TFF that investors will
suffer at least 50% downside from current levels.





As we like to say, "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a
duck, it probably is a duck."
