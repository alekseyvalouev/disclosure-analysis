ONCE AGAIN, NOBLE’S MANAGERS ARE
LYING. THIS SHAMELESS
RESTRUCTURING PLAN IS NOT THE
ONLY OPTION FOR
NOBLE’S STAKEHOLDERS.


April 6, 2018  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 3 Comments  


Three years ago, we published a series of reports on Noble group. Our thesis


at that time was that Noble, like Enron, was hiding billions of losses by


creating fake assets. Many investors chose to believe this company, its


auditor, the credit agencies that didn’t see any issue with the huge fair


values, and the many analysts who rushed to defend Noble. Later, Noble was


forced to recognise billions of impairments. The share price has plunged by


99%. The company is now in default. Top shareholders are leaving the ship.


We expect Q1 results and the next quarters (if Noble is still alive) to be a


bloodbath.


We have also repeatedly warned stakeholders that the root of the company’s


ills was its toxic management, and nothing else. It was urgent to get rid of


them, and replace them by respected professionals. Noble management’s


true competence is in the art of transferring wealth from deceived investors


to themselves. Again, many stakeholders chose to trust this management.


Will Randall, the man who created billions of fake fair values was promoted


CEO. Fox guarding the henhouse. Now that the details of the restructuring


plan are public, it’s clear for (almost) everybody, that this management is


made of crooks who will stop at nothing to deceive, scam, rip off and line


their pockets in the process. This has always been their modus operandi.


They know they have nothing to fear from their auditor that has colluded


with them for years, or from the abysmal regulatory environment of the


Singapore stock exchange that has been a contributing factor to this


scandal. They won’t stop here.

The very same managers who have deceived thousands of investors are now


presenting a highly controversial restructuring proposal. Their argument to


support it is extremely simple: yes, this restructuring plan is terrible for you


but the alternative (administration or liquidation) is even worse. In


particular, shareholders and perpetuals would be wiped out. So you have no


choice. No need to think too much or read the 168-page restructuring


support agreement (“RSA”), which by the way is not even final but


“indicative”. Please sign here. Thank you very much.


Once again, for Noble stakeholders the question boils down to: should they


believe what this management tells them? Is this really the only option?


Here is the “good news”: Noble’s managers are lying once again. No, this


restructuring plan is not the only option. It is actually the worst option and


anybody with basic experience in commodity trading can see the trap. The


shareholders, the perpetuals bondholders but also very importantly the


senior creditors who are not part of the ad hoc group are likely to lose 100%


or most of their capital if they consent to it. This plan won’t save Noble. It


has never been designed with this objective in mind. The only people it will


save are its managers. The only people it will enrich are its managers and


the ad hoc group.


Hopefully, this time, the investors who dismissed our reports will be more


critical about Noble’s claims, consider our arguments, and will avoid a


major mistake once again. There won’t be a second chance: if the


restructuring is implemented and the legal release clause is approved, it will


be too late.


Here is a series of Q&A based on the discussions we had with investors over


the past weeks.


 


Is the “new Noble” post restructuring financially viable?


Most of comments about this restructuring focused on its controversial


aspects. The crucial question of its viability has been hardly discussed. Will


this plan be successful and stop the downward spiral? Or should we expect


Noble to struggle once again after just a few months? After all, a


restructuring is supposed to address the causes that have led to financial


distress.


The answer is obvious: this plan is absolutely not viable. In fact, it has zero


chance of success and everybody at Noble already knows it. When chairman


Paul Brough claims it will be business as usual after the restructuring, he


lies. This man has a well documented history of lies at Noble, and he does it

again. In commodity trading, you cannot afford bonds with coupon of 10%.


This is a very low margin industry and the assumption that Noble with its


cash flow generation will be able to pay this kind of interest is nonsense.


Noble promises a pro forma EBITDA of $175m to $200m per year. However,


in 2017, adjusted net loss before interest and tax from continuing


operations was (-$436m), not even close. As usual, projection numbers given


by Noble are completely unreliable. This is the team that overvalued fair


values by billions. Noble has repeatedly claimed that its coal business is a


solid cash generator. Coal trades are booked at its subsidiary Noble


Resources International Pte Ltd. In the 2016 annual report of this company,


the auditor already underlined material uncertainty related to going


concern. How can this be such a good business? If the coal business was so


profitable, how to explain that the group is in default now. The only thing


we agree on with Noble is the disclaimer footnotes: “Readers are cautioned


not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.”


Noble’s ability to generate cash has consistently been extremely poor. In


2017, operating cash flow (“OCF”) from continuing activities was around


(-$300m). We cannot find this number in the financial statements directly


but we can deduct it:


1. We subtract the discontinued operations OCF (+$79m) from the global


OCF (-$9m). That gives us negative OCF before interest expenses of


(-$88m) for continuing operations.


2. We add interest expenses (that Noble always omits in the OCF) of


$212m for continuing operations.


So in 2017, the continuing operations that are supposed to become the “New


Noble” bled $300m cash.


Will the restructuring materially lower financing costs? No. Post


restructuring, debt will be $1.655b. Bond coupons are sky high: around 10%.


That means around $165m of interest expenses per year. In addition, Noble


will have to pay for the new $700m trade/hedging facility. Financing costs


post-restructuring (more than $165m) will be close to what they were before


the restructuring ($212m) even though debt is halved.


The people who designed this restructuring plan already know that Noble


won’t be able to pay its bonds coupons. This is the reason why most of all the


interests are PIK or “Pay if you can”. The exception is at the Trading Co level


because this bond is closer to the business operations of Noble and its cash


flows. This explains why the ad hoc group wants to get priority access to this


bond. But even for the Trading Co, we expect Noble to struggle to pay its


coupon.

Noble also promises to reduce its SAO expenses (salaries) from $353m to


$100m. How is that even possible? On January 30th, Debtwire reported they


had paid $30m “retention payment” to staff. Once again, a nice bonus in a


company that has just recorded losses of $4.9b! They can’t pay their


bondholders but they sure have enough money for themselves.


The plan is clearly not viable financially. The commodity industry is not a


high margin industry. It’s not possible to pay coupons of 10% when you


move cargoes from one point to another and you compete with dozens of


similar companies.


In addition, the restructuring will cost a fortune: more than $100m as


estimated by Bloomberg. This estimate is conservative.


What will happen to Noble if most coupons are not paid?


Only the coupon of the Trading Co may be (partly) paid and even here we


have doubts. For the other bonds, debt will constantly grow as interest is


capitalised. Obviously, Noble won’t be able to pay the debt principal at


maturity. Bondholders will progressively realise that Noble is still unable to


service its debt, that the paper they own has minimum value. As for the


shareholders and the perpetuals bondholders who are deeply subordinated


in terms of cash flow, they will understand that their securities are worth


zero. The price of Noble’s securities (bonds, shares, perpetuals) will collapse


once again.


Noble’s new shareholders will eventually fire management but it will be too


late at that time:


Noble will be even weaker financially than now. There will be


absolutely nothing left in the shell.


Most importantly, the full legal release will have been obtained.


Noble’s stakeholders won’t be able to sue Noble’s managers, its


directors, the ad hoc group, etc.


If the restructuring is not viable, why do management and the ad hoc group


submit it?


Whether this plan is viable or not is the least of their concerns. Their true


objectives are very different


1) For Noble’s managers



https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/the-cost-of-noble-s-restructuring-is-likely-to-top-100-million

The top priority is to get the full legal release signed. The whole


restructuring revolves around this clause.


Here is the clause:


“the full release of any and all other claims that any Existing Senior


Creditor (other than ING or DB) may have against (amongst others) the


Company, the Group, Management and the Ad Hoc Group and the officers,


directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives of each of the


foregoing arising directly or indirectly out of, from or in connection with


the Existing Senior Debt Documents or the Restructuring,”


Noble’s managers know that ultimately the ship will sink but they don’t


want to spend the next few years with lawsuits. They are extremely wealthy


after plundering the company and its stakeholders. They want to enjoy their


future retirement, and not spend their time with lawyers and face serious


legal risks.


Noble’s board of directors has also defended the restructuring. This is not


surprising. These directors (and the directors who have discreetly resigned


over the past years) know they can be sued at any time. Like Noble’s


managers, they need the release. Noble’s board has never been


representative. None of Noble’s institutional investors is represented. The


last CIC director has just resigned (for “personal reasons”). Goldilocks, a


shareholder who controls 8% of Noble, wanted two seats but they were


turned down for “governance reason”. We believe most of these directors


have been chosen due to their personal connection with Noble’s


management. They cynically took the money and now they don’t want to


spend time in a court of law.


2) For the ad hoc group


The ad hoc group doesn’t need the plan to be viable to make a lot of money.


The terms of the RSA are extremely favourable for its members. They will


get a 5% fee on their share of the $700m trade facility. We have never seen


such a huge fee for a commodity trading facility. On top of that, they get 2%


of the face value of the debt they hold to “compensate” them for their work


in this restructuring. That is around $34m. This “work fee” will be indirectly


paid by all the stakeholders that have been screwed by the work of the ad


hoc members. This fee will be paid in a few days only: April 30th.


They get priority allocation to the Trading Co bond, and to the Asset Co bond


that is backed by assets (although the valuation of these assets by Noble is


fictitious). They will receive fewer shares or preference shares because they


know that ultimately they are worthless.

The ad hoc group members are not here for the long haul. We expect them to


sell their shares and the “subordinated bonds” as soon as possible before the


market realises that the new Noble is still unable to pay its debt. At that


time, there will probably be rumours of a potential acquisition by a Chinese


group. Since the beginning of the Noble saga, this has happened at least five


times. Every time the rumours have helped push the securities price up at a


critical time for Noble.


Like anybody else, they know that Noble’s management is garbage but they


colluded with this management to sign a shameless deal at the expense of


the other senior creditors. The deal is simple: ”You give me the release and I


give you the opportunity to fill your pockets by crushing the other


stakeholders.” Only ING and Deutsche Bank refused to sign the release.


Noble conveniently presents the deal as an agreement with “senior


creditors”. This is absolutely incorrect. We know that the senior creditors


who are not part of the ad hoc group have never been contacted and were


excluded from the negotiations. They are without any doubt those who have


the most to lost from this deal.


Noble is now trying to convince these senior creditors by inviting them to


risk participate in its trade facility. Naturally, to do that, they are required


to consent to the RSA that contains the release clause!


These creditors should think twice about what is going to happen. The ad


hoc group will rush to the exit as soon possible. We expect the price of these


securities to collapse once again. A new generation of bagholders will be


created.


When Joseph Swanson, a financial advisor to the Ad Hoc Group at Houlihan


Lokey, writes: “We look forward to consents from creditors outside the Ad


Hoc Group which will smooth the path towards closing the transaction and


allow the Company to shift its focus to client service and operations.”, what


he really means is: “We have spent months engineering a plan that will


screw them in any way possible, and we look forward to transferring their


money from their pocket to ours.”


For the senior creditors outside the ad hoc group, liquidation is actually a


much better option than this dreadful restructuring. The little value value


left in this company won’t go to the ad hoc group, but will be equally shared


between all senior creditors. As for the senior creditors who cannot or don’t


want to participate in the trade facility, they will mostly end up with shares


or preferentials that are worthless. They will lose everything. For them too,


liquidation is a much better option.

Management insisted to get a large portion of equity. Does it mean they


believe in Noble’s future recovery?


Noble’s management has insisted to get a large share of equity. We heard


the argument that this would show they believe in Noble’s future.


Unfortunately, this argument is incorrect.


Under the scheme, management may end up with 25% of the capital of the


new company. They receive 10% to get incentivised (because, you know,


they have to wake up to go to the office every morning). They will get


another 10% option financed by a cashless interest-free loan refundable


after 5 years. We seriously doubt Noble will be around in five years anyway.


Then, they get another 5% subject to equity threshold but we know they will


create a lot of fake contracts with obscure counterparties in Africa to reach


this threshold. It’s a formality. The fact that a few managers responsible for


the collapse of Noble potentially get 25% of shareholding has caused


controversy for good reasons. It is reward for failure.


However, the controversy is missing the point. Everybody seems to fight for


a piece of the cake but they don’t realise that there is no cake anymore. The


price of the shares will ultimately plunge to zero once shareholders see


there is no money left because financing costs are too high. We strongly


believe that what really matters to Noble’s managers is not the economic


value of these shares but the voting rights that go with them. This is the


reason why the 10% option carries voting rights throughout the option


period. Managers want to maintain as much control as possible over this


company for as long as possible. If they lose control, outsiders will get


access to internal records. This is the nightmare scenario for Noble’s


managers.


So what is the alternative?


For every stakeholder, investing in Noble has been a terrible experience. The


objective is of course to recover as much money as possible although a few


stakeholders would not mind sending Noble’s managers to jail for a few


years.


There may be some money left inside Noble but stakeholders need to be


realistic: most of the value of this company has already been destroyed. It is


now outside the company. Lawsuits against the people or organisations that


have facilitated this scheme offer much better prospects of recovery.


Here are the steps we recommend to maximise their recovery


1) Recover value inside the company

https://iceberg-research.com/2018/04/06/once-again-nobles-managers-are-lying-this-shameless-restructuring-plan-is-not-the-only-option-for-nobles-stakeholders/ 8/14


Appoint an interim chairman/CEO with a commodity background


who has absolutely no connection to Noble’s accounting shenanigans.


William Randall and Paul Brough have to leave the company


immediately.


The first job of the interim CEO will be to determine whether Noble


has a future as a going concern or has to be liquidated. For the first


time, Noble’s stakeholders will be given true information, a revolution


for Noble.


If Noble is deemed viable, it will be run by a new team of experienced


and respected commodity traders. There is no doubt that stakeholders


will be asked to accept financial sacrifices. Debt is simply too large for


Noble. But they will accept these sacrifices if new management is put


in place and the toxic culture which is the cause of their losses is


finally eliminated.


Banks will accept to finance Noble again if new management is


appointed. As long as Will Randall is the CEO, we expect the banks that


have recognised heavy provisions to categorically refuse to finance


this company.


2) Recover funds outside the company


This is where true financial recovery is. It is then absolutely critical that


stakeholders reject the release clause to preserve their ability to sue.


There is an long list of people or firms that have facilitated Noble’s scam. If


Noble’s stakeholders are serious about recovering money, they should


lawyer up and start proceedings, as Goldilocks has recently done.


If Noble were listed in a seriously regulated stock exchange, this job would


be done by the regulators. Defending the rights of investors, especially the


small ones, is what a regulator is supposed to do. In the US, the SEC has


recently charged Rio Tinto and two former executives for fraud. What Rio


did compared to Noble is nothing. It sounds almost innocent. It is beyond


doubt that if Noble were listed in the US, the company and its managers


would have been charged with fraud a long time ago.


Unfortunately, Noble is listed in Singapore. Despite clear evidence of


collusion between Noble and its auditor, the “regulators” have left this


scandal spread and worsen. The SGX even defended Noble’s auditor and


attacked our credibility.

In the absence of any serious stock exchange regulator in Singapore, Noble’s


stakeholders should take matters in their own owns hands. We welcome the


decision made by Goldilocks to sue Noble. It was long overdue.


Lawsuits should be initiated against:


Noble’s managers (starting with Will Randall, Paul Jackaman, Paul


Brough).


Noble’s past and present directors, starting with Richard Elman, the


man who ordered Noble’s financial manipulations.


The auditor EY and in particular Peter Picton-Phillipps, the partner


previously in charge of Noble.


The banks that have allowed Noble to hide its debt with repos.


The banks that have arranged the 2022 bond in 2017 and the $500m


equity raising in 2016.


Etc


All these persons or organisations have deep pockets. The lawsuits will


include a crucial discovery stage. We expect the legal and compliance


departments of these organisations to react nervously when they receive


the discovery lists. EY and the banks will likely beg for a settlement rather


than taking the risk of a public lawsuit with full disclosure.


We have compiled a list of statements that we believe create a legal liability.


The analysis of our reports has been based on public information. But we


have little doubt that internal records will reveal much more. For example,


an important question about Noble has always been whether money has


been illegally transferred from the company to senior managers. Any


investigation will determine this. Former employees of Noble disgusted by


what happened have approached us to share information and assist. More


than anybody, they want Noble’s managers behind bars.


Noble’s stakeholders who are being crushed by the ad hoc group have a very


effective way to put pressure on this group. If they can find a way to sue the


ad hoc group members, they will turn the spotlight to these funds (e.g. Och


Ziff Capital, Davidson Kempner, Taconic Capital Advisors, etc). The cardinal


rule of a hedge fund is to never be in the news. The stakeholders who are the


victims of the collusion between these funds and Noble’s managers should


not miss the opportunity to expose them publicly. We expect the investors


of these funds to be concerned about the publicity, their association to this


scandal, and start making phone calls.

Note that the legal release clause includes the ad hoc group. It is quite


interesting: what are the ad hoc group members afraid of exactly? Is there


something they are not particularly proud of after negotiating with Noble


for months and treating the other stakeholders as a carcass to feed on? We


also note that the exhibit 1 of the RSA that contained the list of the ad hoc


members has been redacted. The funds fear a lawsuit and the reputation


risk that goes with it.


Noble threatens to put the company into administration. Should we believe


that?


Because they are bullies, Noble’s managers do what bullies do: scare people


they perceive as weak. They put a gun on Noble’s stakeholders and threaten


administration, transfer of assets to a “new Noble”, liquidation, transfer of


centre of main interests, etc.


Most of their legal arguments are extremely questionable as underlined by


Goldilocks in their recent announcement (the press covered a few points


only). For example, Noble seems to assume that the administrator is its


delivery boy and will work under its instructions. Sorry, this is not what an


administrator is. Even if the administrator appointed by Noble is a friend of


Paul Brough, his job is regulated. The administrator must act in the interests


of all the creditors, not in favour of a few managers who have brought this


company to its knees and who now want 25% of its equity. This is what


Noble acknowledges itself: “Ultimately, the Administrator will need to


determine, in accordance with its duties as an officer of the court and in


compliance with applicable law, the best course of action for creditors as a


whole.“ If the administrator breaches his duty, creditors have access to


remedies, including asking the Court to remove the administrator.


Most importantly, if Noble is put into administration, management won’t


get the release clause. As mentioned, the central objective of the


restructuring is this clause. They will also lose control over the company,


which will increase the risk of getting sued. Noble’s management keeps


threatening stakeholders when in reality, they are the ones who have


everything to lose if the company is placed into administration or


liquidated. It’s a classic bluff.


By contrast, do stakeholders have really something to lose? For the senior


creditors outside the ad hoc group, liquidation is a better option than what


is currently proposed. The restructuring plunders what is left from the


company and gives it to the ad hoc group. For the perpetuals holders and the


shareholders, they will lose everything in this restructuring or in a


liquidation anyway. But at least if they reject the plan, they will preserve


their ability to sue. For them, financial recovery is not inside Noble


anymore. It’s over. That may be hard to swallow but it’s the sad truth.

Lawsuits offer much better prospects of recovery. Accepting the release


clause would be a terrible mistake.





Noble claims that management is essential to the Company’s business


because its core businesses are “people businesses”. Will Noble’s operations


suffer if its management is replaced?


Let’s see how “essential” these managers have been so far:


Since Will Randall has been appointed co-CEO, the share price is down


97%. He “outperformed” his predecessor Yusuf Alireza (down 76%).


Noble has recorded a loss of $4.9b in 2017.


The company has $800m negative equity.


Noble has defaulted on its 2022 bond coupon (that was raised only one


year ago), its 2018 principal, and its RCF interest payment.


We now know that most of the financial manipulations come from the


Hard Commodities department, that was co-headed by Will Randall,


the current CEO, and Neil Dhar.


Noble is widely regarded as one of the biggest financial scandals of the


past twenty years.


A few managers made dozens of millions every year. They financially


benefited from the scam they actively organised.


The company, Mr Randall and a few other managers, are now hit by


two lawsuits: one from Goldilocks and the second one from PT Atlas.


This is only the beginning.


So are they really essential? There is no need to answer this question. This


level of arrogance is unbelievable. Who do they think they are? When the


share price of your company is down 99% and you have destroyed the


savings of thousands of investors, including retired senior citizens, you are


expected to shut up, and keep a low profile.


It’s time for the silent majority to get organised and start lawsuits. Investors


who have been the patsies for too long have to defend their interests much


more aggressively. They are dealing with sharks. You don’t talk with sharks.


You scare them (which means you lawyer up) or you hit them (which means


you sue them). They won’t understand any other form of communication.


We believe that behind the scenes, Richard Elman continues to exert strong

the head of the legal department Jeffrey Alam are known for their loyalty to


the founder. If Noble’s stakeholders are serious about ending the influence


of Richard Elman, they need to replace these managers, and appoint


executives with appropriate experience.





Can Noble expect a white knight post restructuring?


Since the beginning of the saga, how many times have we heard that a white


knight, generally a Chinese group, will invest? Every time this has failed for


various reasons.


Yes, Chinese buyers have made doubtful investment choices in the


past (CIC, COFCO for example) but the accounting and management


issues of Noble are not a secret anymore. They will understand that


the economics of the restructuring don’t work. Noble won’t generate


enough cash flow to service its debt so why would they invest?


Noble has quite a reputation. Every sovereign fund or institutional


investor has lost money with them: CIC, Prudential, Goldilocks, etc. 


One key condition for investing will be to kick management out. As


always, Noble’s managers will resist this move. Goldilocks in its recent


announcement indicated: “White knight and refinancing proposals


have been put forward to the board, and the board has rejected them,


without providing any details or reasons.” This suggests that


management rejects any deal that would give control to outsiders.





Can Noble secure a vote for its restructuring?


Noble needs the support of 75% of its senior creditors present and 50% of its


shareholders.


Noble claims that it has 55% of the senior creditors votes. This is from the ad


hoc group and the two banks (ING and Deutsche Bank) that will offer the


trade facility. We have no way to check this number. Noble says that


“feedback from Existing Senior Creditors to date has been positive”. All the


people we have talked to find this plan absolutely unacceptable and many


are considering legal options. Noble had to postpone the deadline for the


subscription to the trade facility to April 11th.


The restructuring is clearly against the interests of the creditors outside the


ad hoc group, the shareholders, and the perpetuals holders. The plan will not

Actually the best option is liquidation. Responsibility waiver is


just plain stupid.

As an ordinary shareholder, I would appreciate any advice on how


to start legal action against the management who committed the


fraud… I am at a loss…

Contacting Goldilocks is a good first step


save Noble. It will only save its management, and transfer the little value


left in this company to the ad hoc group.


We urge stakeholders to reject this proposal and particularly to reject any


legal release clause that would absolve this management, and prevent


stakeholders from suing the parties that have facilitated this scandal. This


would be financial suicide.


They also need to make sure that voting procedures are absolutely


independent. They should have no trust in Noble in this area.


Over the past three years, Noble’s stakeholders have been betrayed in every


way possible, by management, by the auditor, by the “regulators”, by the


organisations around Noble that have facilitated this scam. It is time for


them to fight back. Noble is so weak now that it will take minimum time and


effort to win. Let the lawsuits begin.
