Confession Time: Miller Reveals The Truth
Sep. 19, 2014 11:57 AM ET25 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Miller looks overvalued, since the company just released new figures indicating that
its $5 stock is probably worth less than 10% of that price.


Forget about Miller's plan to somehow transform itself into a Master Limited
Partnership, too. The firm bears no resemblance to a normal MLP at all.


The SEC has asked Miller for all sorts of documentation to support the numbers in
its financial statements.


Miller didn't really get rid of its tarnished CEO and longtime chairman of the board.
The company just assigned them cushier titles and kept them on its payroll.


Don't trust the analysts who follow Miller, either. Even after repeatedly slashing their
estimates for the company, those cheerleaders sound just as bullish as ever.


Miller Energy Resources (NYSE: MILL) better watch its mouth. Earlier this week, the
energy firm accidentally told the truth.


Believe it or not, Miller practically admitted that it's overvalued by releasing figures that
basically indicate that its $5 stock should actually fetch less than 10% of that generous
price.


Just wait until the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finds out about this news.
After fielding questions from the SEC about the reported value of its assets, Miller might
as well go ahead assume that regulators will probably notice some new disclosures that
make the $230 million company - strapped for cash, with less than $4 million in the bank -
look virtually worthless right now.


Don't take our word for that conclusion. Feel free to double-check our math. We relied on
a simple formula - using numbers provided by Miller itself - to determine that the company
is likely worth no more than 45 cents a share.


Here. We can walk you through the arithmetic to save a little time, if you like.

5/22/2018 Confession Time: Miller Reveals The Truth - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2507545-confession-time-miller-reveals-the-truth 2/10


When Miller issued its latest press release (cluttering it mostly with a bunch of hype that
we'll scrutinize in more detail later), the company announced plans to boost its reserves by
purchasing similar assets at prices well below the value assigned to the reserves that it
already owns. Specifically, Miller said that it expects to buy "substantially all the Alaskan
operating assets" of a neighboring firm with proven reserves totaling 1.9 million barrels of
oil equivalent (MBOE) for somewhere between $40 million and $50 million. So let's
assume that its actual offer falls in the middle of that range, with Miller paying the
equivalent of $23.68 per MBOE for those neighboring assets, and then value the
company's existing reserves at that very same level.


We figure that oil is oil, especially when it's located in the same region, after all.


Since Miller estimated its proven reserves at 11.7 MBOE in its most recent financial
statements, multiply that figure by $23.68 to arrive at a preliminary valuation of $277
million for the company. Don't get too excited by that figure, though. You still need to
subtract Miller's hefty $314 million debt load from that total and - with the results actually
landing in negative territory - you will obviously want to add the company's meager $3.7
million in cash and (far more helpfully) its $53.6 million in tax credits to that balance if you
want to prevent the firm from looking entirely worthless.


Go ahead. Check out the number on your calculator screen. If you plugged in the correct
figures, you probably feel rather startled by what you see.


Based upon the low price that Miller intends to pay for some additional reserves in Alaska,
the company should be worth just $20 million right now. When you divide that total by the
number of shares that Miller currently has outstanding (46.35 million), you should arrive at
a stock price for the company that - as we tried to warn you earlier - falls just below 45
cents a share.


We're almost tempted to stop right there and assume that (with the help of Miller itself) we
have already made our point about the true value of this cash-strapped company. Now
that we've investigated the rest of the news that Miller packed into its recent press release,
however, we can't bring ourselves to let the company off the hook so easily. After
scrutinizing companies like Miller for years -- and finding all sorts of warning signs that hint
at looming disasters that too often materialize -- we know how to recognize a bunch of
pointless (and potentially dangerous) hype as soon as we see it.


Take Miller's notion that it can somehow transform itself into a Master Limited Partnership
(MLP), for example. Talk about a ridiculous idea.

5/22/2018 Confession Time: Miller Reveals The Truth - Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (NYSE:MILL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2507545-confession-time-miller-reveals-the-truth 3/10


As a oil company that generated a mere $71 million in revenue last year, Miller bears no
resemblance to a normal MLP at all. Once you do a little homework and see just how
much revenue that a typical MLP tends to generate - not to mention the piles of cash that
those multibillion-dollar companies generally clear- we're pretty sure that you will agree
with our conclusion. Miller has tricked the public with an outlandish proposal that seems
like a desperate promotion at worst and a hopeless pipe dream at the absolute best.


Hey, regardless of what our critics might want to believe, we actually tried our hardest to
be fair here. We felt willing to give Miller plenty of credit for one piece of welcome news, in
fact, until the firm immediately proceeded to blow its chances.


Right after Miller announced that it had finally decided to replace its namesake and his
son-in-law as its longtime chairman and its CEO, respectively, the company revealed that
it had actually held onto both of those controversial leaders and simply rewarded them
with cushier positions instead. By hiring the first as a consultant/advisor and appointing
the second as the actual executive chairman of its board, Miller basically just assigned
those tarnished insiders different titles and kept them on an expensive payroll that - given
its bleeding operations and its meager $3.7 million cash balance right now -- the company
must know that it cannot reasonably afford.


Miller didn't stop there, however. The company actually found a way to make matters even
worse by showering an incoming board member with a generous pile of stock options
before that newly appointed director even tries to prove that he's any better than those
blasted for their lousy oversight.


So forgive us if we refuse to believe that Miller has really changed its ways. Three years
after the company originally caught our attention - prompting us to write a damaging report
that rapidly cut its stock price in half - Miller continues to provide us with plenty of reasons
to keep on doubting its word.


We don't think that Miller ever learned its lesson after that devastating crash, since the
company seems to keep on looking for new ways to spin the ugly truth. If you happened to
catch the year-end conference call that Miller hosted a few months ago, you should know
exactly what we mean.


Miller loudly celebrated a boost to its proven reserves and then casually admitted that its
engineers had just issued a new report that actually slashed the estimated value of those
underlying assets. We're not talking about a modest adjustment here, either. Despite the

reported increase in reserves that Miller chose to trumpet first, that new study happened
to reveal, the value of those assets literally plummeted by a full third over the course of
four short months alone.


Don't expect the bullish cheerleaders who keep on recommending Miller's stock to actually
pay attention to details like that, however. Talk about a forgiving crowd! Even after Miller
forced Wall Street analysts to give up on their hopes for a future profit of 23 cents a share
- pushing them to steadily cut their estimates to a projected loss of almost $1 a share over
the course of the past year - the company can still count on their loyal support. In spite of
the dramatic reductions to their original forecasts, most of the analysts who follow the
company have maintained their bullish stands on the risky stock to this very day.


Go figure. Surely, you have learned the game by now. Just follow your instincts and you
can probably figure out where you should actually place your trust.


You can either believe Miller itself - now that the company has finally come clean and
essentially pegged the true value of its $5 stock at just 44 cents a share - or you can listen
to the analysts who have so far proven themselves totally clueless instead.


Rest assured: the owners of TheStreetSweeper knows what to do. They have already
placed another confident bet against the company, since they fully expect the stock to
plummet from current levels.


Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper established a short position in Miller
(NYSE:MILL) and stand to profit on any future declines in its stock price. As a matter of

I don't know whether any of what you said is true or makes sense. It's hard to take you seriously when in every other
line of your analysis, you keep linking to the same two publications: a press release, and their 10-Q.


Linking to a 40 page 10-Q is pointless. We all know where to find SEC filings. Instead, quote the relevant portion, and
explain your reservations about it, instead of changing irrelevant phrases in your narrative to links to the document,
over and over again.


Your assessment may very well be accurate, but it reads more like propaganda than like a serious analysis.

What a surprise that this article is published on September 2014 option expiration date by someone with an
acknowledged short position. Mystically, magically there are over 2,700 September 2014 5 puts expiring today on a
contract with slightly more than 1,000 open interest.


Perhaps the author can attempt to explain away the open market purchases of 40,000 shares by new CEO Giesler
and new Director Sherman 30,000 shares per Form 4s dated 9/17/2014 at $5 per share and Chairman Boruff's
100,000 shares per Form 4 dated 9/18/2014.


The better question is whether the SEC should investigate the trail of self-interest between the article publication and
exceptional option action for a contract expiring the same day.

I'm not sure this analysis works. I don't think Miller's assets are necessarily proportionately similar to Buccaneer's.
Doesn't Miller own platforms, equipment, etc? And isn't it hard to assess the development potential of each
company's resources without doing some work on them?


I like the quantitative approach and have done well shorting stocks with numerous red flags, just would like some
more clarity on the analysis above.

Anyone can have an opinion, but to skip the midstream assets of the company when attempting to do a valuation is
childish.


Also to fail to acknowledge that the loss grew because three rigs have been added to the operations is another major
miss.


Whether all of this will work is another matter, however, the article does not even look into those things.


All this is is a cheap slap job. Sam is right, they lost a lot of credibility with this article.

The author's assertions about creating an MLP are factually inaccurate.


There are several small cap E&P MLPs. As just one example, Mid-Con Energy Partners generated $77 mm in
revenues LTM and has an equity market cap of circa $500 mm. Outside of the E&P space, there is also an
abundance of small cap MLPs such as Oxford Resource Partners which is a coal MLP and garners an equity market
cap of only $20 mm.


There are hundreds of listed MLPs in the US, not all of them are multi billion dollar behemoths. Moreover, there is no
IRS requirement that an MLP be of a certain minimum size. To blithely accuse management of having "tricked the
public" without an understanding of the subject matter is reputationally quite damaging to the author.

The dismissive tone of the article makes for a riveting read, but IMO it is also revealing about motives. Its about as fair
and balanced as Fox news. It does not consider the company's recent directional trend in production, or future growth
from conversion of 2P or 3P assets to proved, or future EBITDA, or the hard asset values on the balance sheet. By
the logic of this writer, you would think lenders don't know what they are doing. Well, I think the lenders are more
objective than this writer.


Now, granted, this girl looks like she could have had a colorful past, and some people may question the MLP
prospects at this moment in time, but my view is that this girl is in the midst of a make-over and she will look
considerably better in the not too distant future.

It seems very likely that miller violated its leverage covenants at 10/31/14. 
Further they stuffed the terrible RU-9 results in the press release about closong the piddling $3.3mm tennesee
divestiture. There was no mention of the RU-12 being drilling, though the comments around drilling in lower risk
portions of their acreage would indicate RU-12 is not in the cards.

Most likely the lender (Keybank) will waive the covenant violation in exchange for raising the interest rate by
100bps+, paying a one time fee, and possibly adding in some more restrictive covenants. It's not out of the
question the revolver limit gets lowered. More broadly, unless oil prices turn around quickly, Miller is living on
a prayer.

In addition to first tracks, Miller has access to about $70 million right now, and that will pay the interest and
dividiends for a little bit.

needs the water sealed off and then needs to get producing. Then there is the sidetrack for WMRU-8 (I think
thats the right number) to see if the production can be increased there from about 50 barrels a day. The oil is
there but they ran into a fault that decreased porosity and therefore need to sidetrack around the fault.


Last up they need to figure out what if anything can be done about RU-9 and whether or not they should try to
complete the second zone. If not, they need to do the sidetracks on RU-3 and RU-4, both of which hit oil, but
they badly needed the gas at the time.


Then, finally they can get back to the regular drilling schedule. By now there should be three rigs operating,
and for Badami, they are trying to schedule a fourth rig, probably from BP or Exxon when there is spare time,
so this should be a viable plan. The main goal is to get production up quickly, and that looks very possible.
Execution will be the key, they varied from the original strategy of drilling the low hanging fruit and got badly
punished, now they need to get back on track before it is too late.

They never should have started RU-9 way back when with all these other problems on their plate. They
should have instead balanced the risk

If they are in violation of bank debt covenants, they have no borrowing availability.

They have access to more than $70 million without borrowing. It was all on the latest balance sheet during the
reporting period. They covered this in the last conference call. No borrowing needed but there was $10 million
available on the first lein if needed in addition.
