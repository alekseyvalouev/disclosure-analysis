Shopify Immediate Price Target- $60- and that is before
they are caught red handed by the FTC
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is the #1 hottest stock on the NYSE in the last 12 months (with
mkt cap over $11 bil).  NOTE:  This stock doesn’t do Artificial Intelligence, Bitcoin or
other magic.   A company that hides under the shroud of a cloud-based e-
commerce solution for Small and Medium sized Business (SMB), is the promoter of


THE HOTTEST STOCK ON THE NYSE IS
… A COMPLETELY ILLEGAL GET-RICH-
QUICK SCHEME (WITH A GOOD
SOFTWARE PLATFORM)
For Immediate Release – October 4, 2017



https://citronresearch.com/
the hottest new “get rich quick” scheme on the internet


We’re not saying Shopify’s technology
doesn’t work. To the contrary, it is a
good ecosystem for its Shopify plus
partners to build e-commerce websites. 
We would even go as far as to say that it
is the best build-your-own ecommerce
software on the market.


So what’s the problem?
Out of the claimed 500,000 websites,
Shopify has about 2,500 “Plus” clients
and maybe another 20,000 “Advanced”. 
So where are the other 450,000 +
websites????


Funny, this problem was first addressed
when Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke knocked
on Venture Capital’s door.   As we read
in a Bloomberg article.


“500,000 merchants is just such a crazy number,”
Lutke said. “I have lots of stories about being
laughed out of VC offices because they told me the
entire addressable market for my company was
40,000 stores.”” (Bloomberg Aug 1, 2017)


I guess the great minds on Sand Hill
Road never thought that the pressure
of Wall Street can cause some
companies to cross over to the dark
side.

those “other web sites”.  Just like
analyst reports don’t discuss churn,
they miss Shopify’s deepest darkest
secret.


SHOPIFY’S DIRTY LITTLE SECRETSHOPIFY’S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET
Like any good research, we start with Google.  Just search YouTube for the term
“Shopify millionaire” and their marketing strategy becomes obvious.


Shopify calls these affiliates “partners.” We call them promoters selling business
opportunities. Our favorite Shopify promoter is Keder Cormier who used to be a
promoter of Herbalife….same hustle different product.

SHOPIFY’S PARTNERS RIGHT OUT IN
THE OPEN
And Shopify doesn’t hide these promoters – they are right out in the open for
everyone to see. The company goes as far as to call them “partners” and brag to
Wall Street about this being its competitive advantage. As said in the last conference
call.


“We now have more than 13,000 partners who have
referred merchants to Shopify in the last 12 months, up
from 12,000 just last quarter

OK, SO WE CAN AGREE THAT
SHOPIFY’S METHOD OF RECRUITING IS
“DODGY.”  
BUT IS IT LEGAL??  NO!BUT IS IT LEGAL??  NO!


It’s time to End this Dangerous Game of Greed NOW!
Let us start with the most obvious comparison – Herbalife.  In its settlement
with the FTC Herbalife was, among other stipulations, declared to be in
violation of FTC by over-promising success for its distributors.

restructure-its-multi-level-marketing-operations


Shopify, it is Citron’s pleasure to introduce you to the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).


Herbalife’s behavior was tame when compared to Shopify’s.  On a corporate
level, Herbalife never talked about making distributors millionaires or actually
suggested that they quit their job.


What you are about to read is the most blatant disregard of FTC law EVER
witnessed by Citron. Don’t worry, we have made local copies, because we
have no doubt that Shopify will soon take all these claims off the Internet.


On its Facebook page, Shopify promotes its
service by stating that 2,700 people become
millionaires each a day.

https://www.shopify.com/facebook/millionaire


On the Shopify corporate website there
are 92 mentions of the word
“millionaire.”


Worse, indulging in misconduct that that Herbalife could never dream of, Shopify
goes so far as to offer a sample resignation letter to your boss on its corporate
website.  They’re advising their own prospective customers to quit their day jobs?
Who is Shopify’s legal counsel?!?

This stuff makes the violations Herbalife was sanctioned for look like child’s play.


NO PRODUCT? NO PRODUCT? 
NO PROBLEM!NO PROBLEM!


Because of this ‘Business Opportunity’
rule, Shopify will be forced to treat it as
such once the FTC files a lawsuit.

The majority of Shopify’s customers
are not SMB merchants; rather, they
are people who are buying a system
and Shopify goes as far as to supply
them a theme and inventory.


Shopify continues to flagrantly break
the law given this relationship with their
“partners”.  As clearly stated by the FTC


Yet, none of these “partners” on either
Google, Youtube, or any other
influencer network has ever disclosed,
to our knowledge, that they are being
compensated by Shopify.  Moreover
Shopify is abetting this by showing their
“partners” how to make money writing a
blog.  Yes, that is right, money for
writing ….not for selling.


This relationship can be summed up
clearly in this video from one of the
many Shopify Partners.  Just watch the
first 11 seconds of this video to
understand the workings of your $11
billion company.

is a way, guys, for you to make money…
with Shopify…not with a store where
you are selling items…not with a store

What is the value of a Shopify
Website???


In an effort to reduce the loss of
revenue that comes from a high
customer churn rate and delay the
inevitable, Shopify recently
established Shopify Exchange, where
people can sell their Shopify-powered
websites.  This new tool provides an
alternative for people who have
already lost their money with Shopify
and keeps them on board as paying
customers.

job-board/t/announcing-exchange-


So as not to be accused of picking on
the weak websites, Citron will focus on
the ones selling for over $10,000 (the
most expensive range), and having over
$500,000 of revenues (another large
filter).  There are exactly 10 of them.


Click on any of them to “view details”
and scroll down.  You’ll see a monthly
revenue chart with the same “crash and
burn pattern”.  Here’s the one for “Head
Over Heels Couture”.  It currently has
the highest list price of any website on
Shopify’s exchange.

Churn baby Churn


The next obvious question is what is
the churn???  Needless to say, Shopify
does not disclose the churn- why
would it??  The following chart shows
that despite these valiant marketing
efforts, associated with a high flying
stock, the company has shown limited
ability to leverage the growth they are
selling.  The chart below shows the
unit economics of this business are
bad and not improving.


So What’s Does this all mean Citron


So how do you value a company that


Does not disclose its churn


Loses Money

Operates Illegally


Shows no operating leverage


Half of revenue is not subscription but
lower margin revenue from merchant
solutions (unlike other SaaS)


We will disregard all of the above risk
factors that are not priced into the
stock.  We will be generous and give
SHOP the same multiple to sales as
the best is class SaaS companies or
even Square or Wix.  All of them trade
at an average of 8.5x sales compared
to almost 17 for Shopify.


Shopify Stock should be down 45%
immediately….and that is before the
company is caught by the FTC


Best Case Scenario for
Shopify Stockholders
What If Citron is wrong on
our assessment of
Shopify and the future of
this world is millions of
people selling fidget
spinners and we all
become our own flea
market??


Everyone knew that Workday was best
is class SaaS but the bulls got carried
away and bought the stock too much
too fast.  Over the next 4 years
Workdays revenues increased 400%
but the stock performance remained
flat…and trust us, Shopify ain’t no
Workday.

https://exchange.shopify.com/shops?industry_id=&sortBy=trending_value_high_to_low&sale_price=10000&total_revenue=500000
Citron’s final note: We realize we have not honed in on profitability here.  We will
save that for another day…just another problem for Shopify.


Conclusion


If you ever read on the Internet a way to become a millionaire working at home- it
probably isn’t true.  As an investor if you believe that someone can buy Facebook
ads and become a millionaire- than buy Facebook stock.  We are forwarding all of
our information (hundreds of pages) to the FTC and we expect Shopify to face the
same scrutiny as the many companies of the past who sell dreams to unsuspecting
customers.  All of the information above speaks for itself
