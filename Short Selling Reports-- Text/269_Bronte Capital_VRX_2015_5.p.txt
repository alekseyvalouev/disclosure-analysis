Valeant: cash EPS, GAAP EPS and various covenants
Today Valeant guided down its so-called cash EPS. You can find the press release at this link. 
 
Lets just take the 3Q guidance as published: 
 


Q4 2015 Revised Guidance 


Total Revenues previously $3.25 - $3.45 billion now $2.7 - $2.8 billion


Adjusted EPS* previously $4.00 - $4.20 now $2.55 -$2.65


Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations* previously greater than $1.0 billion,
now greater than $600 million


 
At the low end of this range we have reduced quarterly revenue from $3.25 billion to $2.8 billion
dollars. This is $425 million. [The high-end of the reduction is $750 million.] 
 
The reduction is - at this end - $425 million on $3.25 billion of sales. The low end is thus a 13 percent
revenue reduction. 
 
Here is what Valeant said about Philidor on the October 26 call. 
 


 
 
To quote: In Q3 2015, Philidor represented 6.8% of total Valeant revenue. 
 
The reduction in revenue is about twice the revenue running through Philidor. 
 
Observation 1: The revenue drop is more than just Philidor. Something else is going on.  
 
The bull argument to date is that Philidor is a small percentage of sales some of which will be caught
elsewhere and thus can be ignored. However the drop in sales is twice Philidor (or more than twice
Philidor for most points in the range).  
 
Second - the "adjusted EPS* drops from $4.00 - $4.20 to $2.55 -$2.65. This is a drop at the minimum
end of $4.00 to $2.65 0r $1.35 per share. 
 
There were - according to the last 10Q - 343,101,797 shares outstanding as of October 19, 2015.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: cash EPS, GAAP EPS and various covenants


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-cash-eps-gaap-eps-and-various.html 2/8


So so-called cash EPS will fall by roughly $463 million at a minimum. 
 
The fall in cash-EPS is more than double the entire revenue of Philidor. 
 
Again something other than Philidor has been broken here. 
 
GAAP numbers and debt covenants 
 
Valeant tells the market about "cash EPS" - a measure that differs considerably from GAAP EPS. 
 
The cash EPS numbers are not audited. The differences are differences you must trust the
management to honestly report. 
 
However they are not the numbers as reported in the 10-Q nor are they the numbers that are
contained in the debt covenants. [See just one debt indenture at this link.] 
 
Here is the P&L statement for the last quarter and nine months from the 10-Q.

Note that operating income (earnings before interest and tax) for the third quarter was $447.8 million
and for the nine months was $1332.7 million. 
 
Note that the minimum fall in so-called "cash eps" in the fourth quarter is larger than the entirety of
operating income in the third quarter. This should provide some scale.

)
 


 
Depreciation and amortization, including impairments of finite-lived intangible assets was $726.4
million in the third quarter and $1,768.4 for the nine months. 
 
In the third quarter EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest and tax and adding in depreciation
and amortisation) was $447.8 + $726.4 million = $1174 million. 
 
So so-called cash EPS will fall by roughly $463 million at a minimum.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: cash EPS, GAAP EPS and various covenants


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-cash-eps-gaap-eps-and-various.html 4/8


Posted by John Hempton at 12:49 AM  


 
This means that the run-rate GAAP EBITDA is $711 million or less. 
 
Debt restrictions 
 
Here is a debt indenture. This debt indenture places restrictions on Valeant if the debt to EBITDA ratio
exceed 3.5 times. These do not cause an "event of default" but do limit Valeant's flexibility to buy back
shares (they can't), incur most indebtedness or to make other investments. 
 
Given that debt is about $30 billion and EBITDA run-rate is about $700 million per quarter there can
be little question that Valeant is operating under strict loan-covenant based restrictions. 
 
In Pearson we trust 
 
Mike Pearson did not tell us about Philidor. 
 
Originally Valeant stated that they did not disclose Philidor because their alternative fulfilment was a
"competitive advantage". Later they declared that Philidor was not unusual - other companies used
specialty pharmacies (p. 8). 
 
Then Mike Pearson told us that the issues related to Philidor and Philidor was 6.8 percent of revenue. 
 
Then he guided down revenue by approximately double the sales of Philidor. 
 
Then he neglected to tell the market he was operating under covenants that restrict many of his
actions. In October Bill Ackman thought that Valeant might buy-back stock at these low prices. That is
not possible. 
 
Still despite these things it is clear that most the market believes something akin to Valeant's so-called
cash EPS. 
 
The market trusts Mr Pearson for the moment. 
 
I am a gnarly fellow however: I note the revenue fall is roughly twice Philidor - so I know that I don't
know what is going on and I don't believe what I am told. 
 
What you believe dear readers however is up to you.

Remember the covenants run off of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, which is allowed to
include estimates around expected synergies from M&A in the last 12 mos. Salix was
4/1/15,so we have at least 2Qs of fiction left. Which is to say, they may be able to claim
they're not violating those covs yet.

See Slide 18 from today's presentation. They fully explain the lower revenue. $250M in
Philidor, $150M from Walgreens transition and $200M from pricing adjustments. 
 
Selective disclosure and fear mongering isn't going to win you any fans, Johnny-boy.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: cash EPS, GAAP EPS and various covenants


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-cash-eps-gaap-eps-and-various.html 5/8


Nice work again John, 
 
I noticed the Q4 forecast 'issue' immediately too. And you are choosing the most
conservative look at it. My gut has been that there is going to be an inventory run-down in
Q4 to 'kitchen sink' as much as they can. They won't tell you this outright if they can
explain it through the $600mm number they showed on  
 
I would note also that in 2016 guidance, the adjusted EBITDA number matches the
Street's roughly $7bn number, but revenues look light vs Street and 'cash EPS' is lower
than Street consensus as I see it on capIQ by some 6-7%. That means despite sharply
lower margins through Walgreens Boots Alliance meaning revs drop $600mm (so EBIT
drops a lot too on pro-forma basis), margins go up? I think something a bit dodgy on this
but expect where they expect numbers to come through is on pure volume through WBA
deal. Rifaximin (generic Xifaxan) is 5% the cost but generic not approved in US because
Salix applied for IBS-D indication, means orphan drug approval for a couple of years. At
which point, prices will fall 95% to generic level (Walgreen's announcement says price fall
10% to 95% for drugs through that channel to match generic). Think only way you get the
2016 guidance is through stupidly high volumes, and letting people go in 2016. But I think
very tough to get revs to that level, and very tough to get EBITDA up there when margins
fall sharply and GPMs already 75+%. One way to get it might be to simply cease giving
money to 'charities'. Doing so would soften the hit to cash flow from lower prices.  
 
All I can say is "we'll see." MP has probably shown for the near-term that he has 'taken
the hit' in 2015, but 2016 will be fine. Main issue for VRX holders should be that IMS data
will now show price falling trend because WBA channel content in that data. Means
payers will want to pay less. This is a much longer-term issue and indicates existing
assets are probably worth less, but I wouldn't expect a write down (there is a reason why
the WBA deal is 20 years long - means auditors can't claim the drugs are worth less
earlier).  
 
Yesterday's comments on CNBC about Philidor were quite disingenuous I thought, and
whole "Q&A" showed evasiveness. This AM 'better' but not great by any stretch. But I
think the can has probably been kicked.

This seems a slightly biased view of earnings and the indenture - although no doubt
directionally correct. 
 
The consolidated cash flow definition in the indenture (what you are taking as EBITDA)
excludes pretty much all non cash charges in net income (as well as interest and tax),
which means EBITDA is likely to be considerably higher than your estimate - more like
$1,385m plus potentially the stock compensation charges of $50m.  
 
The 3.5 ratio test also only relates to incurring secured debt - I'm not sure if Valeant has
secured debt it needs to refinance but it could always raised unsecured notes, and so
total leverage is more of an issue depending on where EBITDA settles ($30bn-$1.4bn
cash is $28.6bn over run rate EBITDA of say $1.1bn is 6.5x leverage.

Where you see smoke, there is fire. Looks like the big share holders are trying to keep
this fire under control long enough to slowly get out with as much as possible. My
personal opinion is that we are looking at a house of cards. How long can it hold up with
smoke pouring out of every crack? 
 
I put my money where my mouth is, so let's wait and see who gets burned!

"Given that debt is about $30 billion and EBITDA run-rate is about $700 million per
quarter there can be little question that Valeant is operating under strict loan-covenant
based restrictions."

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant: cash EPS, GAAP EPS and various covenants


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/12/valeant-cash-eps-gaap-eps-and-various.html 6/8


 
The covenant is called the Secured Leverage Ratio - note the word "Secured". Much of
the $30B of debt you cite in the sentence above is UNsecured debt, and thus does not
count toward the calculation. Pretty weird that you can't even grasp such a basic point as
this.

Indeed, some basic points just being missed, Worst of all, not once has John actually
tried to value this. It's like he thinks $11bn of sales is worth nothing, that the Salix drug is
worth nothing, that B&L is worth nothing....this is not analysis.

John, 
 
I think you would enjoy a new challenge by applying your unique skills to icap plc.  
 
Simple google searches will reveal the type of behavior that employees of icap are
comfortable with. Try searching for fines, parties and pay attention to the wording of the
ASX notices this year about the deliberate and continuing conduct (even after they knew
of breaches) of the icap trading team. Linkedin searches will show the Head of Trading -
Jason Howell is related to the CEO -- Brad Howell. This and many examples of bad
behavior consistent with that of being over paid adolescents will be revealed as
comments to your posts should you decide to take a look.  
 
The recent sale to tullet prebon by Mr Spencer is in my opinion tantamount to admitting
that he is unable to control the bad behavior and culture that has developed. Support for
these comments will be made public over time.  
 
I know there is much to be discovered about this company should you want to turn over a
few rocks and given the behavior and attitudes of senior employees I'm convinced there
is even more that I am yet to determine. 
 
NB - disclaimer - I am not an ex employee, nor have I had any dealings with the
company. I do have a small short position that is likely to be increased significantly
pending the report of a private investigator which I engaged only recently.

Mate,  
 
You should spend more time trying to get your long position in RR.L straightened out.
Valeant deal with Walgreens/Boots is a game changer. Pearson is an innovator. You on
the other hand are a blow hard talking up his book in hopes you can convince people
you're smart. Fat chance.

John, 
that's it? this was your smoking gun on the covenants? thats a pretty darn weak case to
be short. same way you were wrong to talk about a $10b fine, you will be wrong to talk
about these irrelevant covenants (that prevents buybacks lol)

Dan, so value it. john hasn't. What are the assets worth? If you don't know that, sure, your

Here's a valuation model. $700m of EBITDA a quarter is $2800m a year. Pretend they
can get away with paying no tax for ever and that maintenance capex is only $300m a
year. That's $2.5bn of free cash flow. 
 
Now let's say that the game is up for acquisition driven growth and price increases. So
put it on an ex growth multiple of 11x. Enterprise value is therefore $27.5bn. 
 
Equity value is EV minus debt, so what's the debt? Oh dear it's about $30bn. The good
news is that there is limited liability so rather than minus $2.5bn the equity in that case
would be worth zero. 
 
I don't think that case is particularly pessimistic for the actual outcome for Valeant, but
any outcomes worse than "ex-growth" are of interest to debt investors only because the
outcome for equity value is the same.

Note of course that my sketch valuation hasn't taken into account the possibility that it
might pay a dividend before it falls apart but you really can't expect precision in blog
