Jammin Java Cools Off While Escaping SEC Heat

By Janice Shell and Melissa Davis


When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently suspended trading in 17
dubious microcap companies, the agency spared one notorious player – Jammin Java
(OTCPK:JAMN) – that easily ranks among the most overhyped penny stocks of the entire
year.
Fueled by an aggressive promotional campaign, far more powerful than those lifting the
stocks actually included on the SEC hit list, JAMN exploded from 17 cents to $6.35 a
share before losing more than half of its value after we began raising serious questions
about the company. Within days, JAMN quickly shed $250 million worth of its market
value, as cold reality sobered up giddy investors previously drunk on overblown hype.


“They may be called ‘penny stocks,’” the SEC observed when announcing its recent
crackdown, “but victims of microcap fraud can suffer devastating losses.”


While the SEC excluded JAMN from its net, focusing on older favorites of penny-stock
promoters instead, the agency cited many concerns that look quite relevant to JAMN itself.
Like most of the stocks caught in that SEC halt, JAMN clearly surged on paid promotions
– recording huge gains in both its trading volume and its share price – since the
company’s dismal operational results, including barely $1,000 in annual sales, could
hardly inspire even a meager rally in the shares. Moreover, like the promotions that
boosted those other penny stocks, the JAMN campaign has relied on shadowy figures
hiding behind mysterious websites and financed by obscure “third-party” outfits to set the
company’s stock on fire. As covered in more detail below, the JAMN campaign also bears
striking similarities to another aggressive promotion – touting shares of Big Bear Mining
(OTC:BGBR) – that has already ended horribly for gullible investors.


Once valued at nearly $150 million, BGBR (another stock absent from the SEC list) has
seen its market capitalization dwindle to just $6.4 million over the course of just one short
year. We warned investors away from BGBR right after it peaked, sparing those who
listened considerable pain, and has since sounded loud alarms about JAMN – while
exposing critical links between the junior miner and the coffee company – as well.

5/22/2018 Jammin Java Cools Off While Escaping SEC Heat - Jammin Java Corp. (OTCMKTS:JAMN) | Seeking Alpha

JAMN promoters, so far ignored by regulators and only temporarily hampered by website
administrators that interrupted their aggressive campaign, kept on boldly touting the
company’s stock even after those damaging reports. Thanks to that lasting push, JAMN
managed to stage yet another breathless rally – more than doubling in recent weeks from
roughly $1 to $2.50 a share – before the fledgling coffee company awakened investors
from their intoxicating dreams once again.


Late Wednesday, JAMN disclosed that its outside auditing firm – which had just signed off
on its disturbing (and overdue) financial statements the previous month – had decided to
sever its ties to the company. LBB & Associates actually resigned as JAMN’s auditor
almost a full week earlier, filings show, but the company waited until it had retained a
tarnished replacement – with its hyperactive stock jumping more than 50% in the
meantime – before reporting that material event. Near the end of that 8-K filing, almost as
an afterthought, JAMN also officially acknowledged that a regulatory agency up north (the
British Columbia Securities Commission) had enacted a cease-trade order for the
company’s shares.


By then, we were already taking another hard look at JAMN and the forces that had driven
such radical upswings in the company’s stock. This time, we uncovered even more red
flags and further parallels between the powerful JAMN and BGBR campaigns.


Imaginary Friends


The JAMN promotion began slowly in late December, records show, with the stock barely
trading on the ghostly “Grey Market,” by promising a hot stock tip (for weeks and then
months) before finally introducing the company by name. The campaign hit its peak in
May, ignited by frequent ads on Yahoo Finance, and appeared to involve multiple
promoters – including one identified as “John Bell,” who promised the tip and starred in
the ads, and another as “Marc Lautner” – with the same wildly bullish JAMN story to
share. Bell and Lautner sounded almost like parrots, in fact, essentially delivering identical
messages employing the same cryptic style (with very short sentences and hard carriage
returns) that almost looked like a stab at stock-picking “poetry” on the page.


The promotional websites operated by Bell and Lautner mysteriously vanished, taking
their bullish JAMN touts along with them, just before we released our first investigative
report on the company. However, the second site – known as “The Lautner Letter” – soon
reappeared, with Bell and Lautner later merging together in spam emails to seemingly
become one and the same.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/274707-jammin-java-cools-off-while-escaping-sec-heat 3/18


Late last month, much to our surprise, we fielded one of those unsolicited emails itself.
Bell appears as the official sender of that bullish JAMN message, even though Lautner
identifies himself in both the captivating subject line – “Who the HELL is Marc Lautner?” –
and the actual email as the celebrated author of that tout. Bell not only reveals himself as
the supplier of that email, signed above by “Your Pal, Marc Lautner,” but he also goes a
step further by adding a specific address (3368 Mount Tabor in Elmsford, N.Y.) that looked
almost authentic until Internet research exposed it as an outright fake.


Succumbing to the same clumsy habit, records indicate, both Bell and Lautner have
fabricated other addresses when touting JAMN on their websites as well. They have also
disclosed payments from a mysterious “third-party shareholder” that seemed to surface
out of nowhere just to finance their promotional campaigns.


About a year ago, BGBR briefly rocketed on an aggressive publicity campaign employing
many of the same tricks later used in the high-powered JAMN promotion. Back then, a
promoter identifying himself as “Michael Cohen” built up mounting anticipation by
repeatedly promising – and delaying – a great stock pick before finally announcing BGBR
as his imminent homerun. Cohen originally touted BGBR on a website known as
“DoublingStocks,” which began directing visitors to a second site called “Day Trading
Robot” after its own content suddenly disappeared. While the second site featured a
BGBR tout penned under a different name, “Jason Kelly,” the co-inventor of the so-called
robot that purportedly discovered BGBR had previously been identified in an official press
release as none other than Cohen himself.


Like JAMN, records suggest, BGBR was touted by the same promoter using different
names, fabricated addresses and mysterious funding sources that remain hidden behind
the curtains of obscure (and potentially bogus) firms to this day.


The promotions share other traits as well. Both published bullish touts in the same distinct
style, favoring the short sentences and hard carriage returns normally associated with
poetry, and even used identical words and phrases to boot. Bell urged readers to
“whitelist” his email address, a unique jargon term for excluding senders from email filters,
just as Cohen had done the previous year. The pair also delivered the same bold promise:
If their chosen stock (JAMN for Bell, BGBR for Cohen) failed to triple in price in the coming
weeks, they vowed, then they would officially call it quits and “retire as a stock picker.”


Meanwhile, long before JAMN replaced BGBR as a promised winner, we had already
linked the two companies together. More than a year ago, we uncovered a notorious
player – this one with a real name and a real address – connected to JAMN and BGBR

alike.


Shane Whittle, a short-tempered Vancouver stock promoter, abruptly resigned from his
executive and boardroom posts at JAMN right after we connected him to BGBR in our
detailed coverage of that company. Whittle never showed up in official filings for BGBR,
the primary focus of that old story, but his Vancouver address did. That location, identified
as Whittle’s address in earlier filings for other companies, later surfaced as the address for
the top executive of BGBR (a former barroom bouncer) as well.


Even so, when contacted by us (and separately by The Vancouver Sun), Whittle angrily
denied any ties to BGBR and followed up with curse-laced threats before quickly hanging
up the phone. More recently, Whittle claimed that he had reported us to the SEC: a move
that, if true, could potentially generate some welcome scrutiny from the same regulatory
agency that just halted more than a dozen heavily promoted penny stocks in its fresh
crackdown on microcap fraud.


Shadowy Deals


The SEC specifically cited concerns about dubious financing deals when suspending
trade in some of those suspicious stocks.


Like those companies, records show, both JAMN and BGBR have reported curious
funding arrangements – with several of the same features -- as well. Last December, with
its stock barely trading on the illiquid Grey Market, JAMN inked a financing deal with an
obscure firm that the company described as a United Kingdom outfit at the time. Under the
terms of that arrangement, JAMN could raise up to $2.5 million by selling “Straight Path
Capital” big blocks of its stock at 40 cents a share. The deal officially lasted for one year,
filings indicate, but could be extended for another year – or canceled at any time – at the
request of either party involved.


Months later, filings indicate, JAMN had generated a paltry $120,000 by selling 300,000
shares of company stock – soon worth more than $1 million on the open market – to
Straight Path through that financing deal. On May 5, with JAMN breaking past the $3 mark
and set to double from there in a week, JAMN followed up by quietly agreeing to sell
Straight Path another 5.95 million shares (with the option to make it an even 6 million) at
that same cut-rate price.


We exposed a glaring problem with that deal a couple of weeks later. According to
Companies House, which officially registers companies located in the UK, Straight Path
Capital does not exist.

Shortly after that, when JAMN finally filed its overdue annual report, the company
redefined Straight Path as an outfit located in the Marshall Islands instead. We initially
found no registrations for Straight Path there, either – despite searches for the firm as a
corporation, a partnership and a limited liability company – although Straight Path
magically surfaced in the registry, listing October 2008 as its formation date, after we
revealed that mysterious omission.


Last year, BGBR signed a financing deal carrying very similar terms. Under that
agreement, BGBR could raise up to $1.4 million by selling company stock to a foreign firm
– this one, known as Intosh Services, located on a faraway island out in the Indian Ocean
– for 70 cents a share. That deal also officially lasted a year, but could be extended or
canceled by either party, as well.


Unlike Straight Path Capital, Intosh Services at least showed up in the corporate registry
operated by the country identified in company filings as its home base. Intosh officially
registered as a company in Mauritius, a sunny tax haven, in January of 2010 and
negotiated its financing deal with BGBR a couple of months later. Less fortunate than
Straight Path (at least so far), Intosh went on to suffer big losses on that investment
virtually every step of the way.


Intosh spent $1.4 million purchasing BGBR stock at 70 cents a share during a three-
month period ending in mid-2010, records show, with the stock plummeting -- from an
early high of $1.75 to a final low of 24 cents a share – throughout that buying spree.
Undeterred, records show, Intosh bravely purchased another 1.67 million shares of BGBR
stock this spring -- this time at just 15 cents a share – and wound up recording major
losses, as the stock fell to half that price, that time around as well.


By the time Intosh executed that last purchase, records indicate, the firm had already
allowed its corporate registration in Mauritius to officially expire. Now defunct, Intosh
basically lasted a year and – like Straight Path – appeared to serve no real purpose
outside of its role as a funding partner for a heavily promoted penny-stock company.


Familiar Footsteps


At the time, as we previously documented, JAMN and BGBR employed the same
controversial transfer agent and suspect law firm as well. They even used the same
tarnished auditing firm, flagged for poor financial oversight in the past, until LBB &
Associates abruptly severed its ties to JAMN earlier this month.

JAMN now relies on KBL, which arguably sports an even lousier record, instead. In a
report published earlier this year, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
announced that it had uncovered significant deficiencies in both KBL audits that it
reviewed during an official inspection of the firm. Notably, the PCAOB said, both audits
failed to identify or address violations of standard accounting rules that later triggered
formal restatements of financial results deemed reliable by the firm in the past.


Meanwhile, despite its classification as a company with “significant connections” to British
Columbia, JAMN has yet to supply mandatory paperwork -- including SEC filings and
official press releases – to B.C. regulators, records show, who have responded by
enacting a cease-trade order for the company’s stock. As a result of that action, taken on
May 20, B.C. investors remained on the sidelines during the latest rise and fall of the
company’s volatile shares.


U.S. investors have taken another wild ride in the meantime. Those who purchased JAMN
at or near its latest peak of $2.48 a share earlier this week, hoping for a powerful rally like
the one that previously pushed the stock past the $6 mark, have paid a high price. The
stock has instead reversed course, following news of the sudden auditor change, and now
barely fetches $2 a share.


If JAMN continues to follow in the footsteps of BGBR – or other overhyped penny stocks
like those recently suspended by SEC – the shares face a much steeper plunge, with little
hope for recovery, on down the road. While day traders could get lucky and make some
money (by playing the swings and banking the gains) along the way, history suggests,
ordinary investors face the prospect of devastating losses instead.


Some investors, who placed long-term bets on microcap companies in the past, have
already learned that expensive lesson the hard way. We fielded a desperate email just this
week from one of them: an office worker, one year shy of retirement age, who spent
almost a fourth of her meager savings buying stock in Americas Energy (AENY.OB) -- a
past target of in-depth coverage on this website -- after it soared to $5 on paid promotions.
She held onto the stock through the plunge that soon followed, fruitlessly hoping for a
recovery, and finally stopped checking on its waning share price (now a paltry 18 cents)
because she could no longer stand the pain.


She lost cash she could not afford to spare and, at this point, now wishes she had simply
given those precious funds away.

“Having absolutely no smarts about investing and having very little money (I’m 64), I
bought $5,000 worth of this crappy stock at $5 per share,” she stated. “I would have felt
better about losing my $5,000 if I had given it to my church or handed it out little by little to
people who live on the streets …


“Instead,” she lamented, “I helped bankroll a bunch of crooks who are out there living the
high life, completely unconcerned that they have swindled people who couldn’t afford to
finance their lavish lifestyles.”


She concluded with an urgent plea for help. She stands out as just one of many
vulnerable victims – simply hoping to expand their limited budgets -- that the SEC, through
its enhanced crackdown on microcap fraud, is now trying harder to protect.


Even “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer, a frequent SEC critic, praised the agency and its
ambitious new “strike against the hype” upon learning of the campaign.


“I cannot tell you how important this initiative is, because there are so many ways for
enterprising and unethical people to do ‘pump-and-dump’ these days,” Cramer stated on
CNBC this week. “It’s incredibly urgent for the SEC to stay vigilant on this issue.


“It should be applauded for its crackdown on penny-stock operators … The sooner these
operators are shut down,” he concluded, “the better.”


Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this article, TheStreetSweeper (through its
members) effected a “short sale” of 60,825 shares of JAMN stock, beginning on June 7,
2011, at an average price of $2 a share, with the intent of profiting from decreases in the
price of the stock. TheStreetSweeper may choose to adjust the size of this investment --
increasing, decreasing or covering its short position in the stock -- and will fully disclose
the details of those trades as they occur. As a matter of policy, TheStreetSweeper
prohibits members of its editorial staff from taking financial positions in any stocks that
they cover.


Update: TheStreetSweeper covered its short position in JAMN, under a "forced buy-in,"
on June 13 at $1.99 a share.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/274707-jammin-java-cools-off-while-escaping-sec-heat 8/18


We need more of these write-ups to expose these frauds which prey on investors.


14 Jun 2011, 06:29 AM


TheClearPath
The only scam here is your article. This looks like manipulation by shorts, as clearly disclosed at the end. Jammming
Java is a real company with a real products, funny how this was conveniently ommited in your article. If you really
wanted to go after scetchy accounting, your report would include 3/4 of Wallstreet financial firms.


14 Jun 2011, 09:10 AM


Wendy Allen
I agree, every time Jamming starts to gain momentum another derogatory article is released. It is the shorts
manipulating the market.

this is just peanuts compared to what goldman sucks has done to the world , amongst others of the elite,
remember when oil was going higher years back and goldman said it was going to $140 a barrel and it shot
up so fast giving us $4 dollars a gallon for the first time , and then the drop , so tell me what is the difference!

I love your reporting and thank you for it. 
I was never dumb enough to fall for it, and maybe I will figure a way to make money by shorting these situations.


My only add to this discussion is that I get these same e-mails but from a "Richard Fischer."


They are exactly as you describe, written for a 4 year old mind, in short sentences, devoid of any really facts or
figures.


14 Jun 2011, 10:56 AM


VHendrix
Exactly, ClearPath. I purchased 'Lively Up' coffee through their website. I can honestly say it was the best cup of
coffee I've brewed in a long time. If inclined, you could also simply conduct a search on YouTube for Marley Coffee.
You'll see Rohan Marley personally visit a number of Whole Foods locations to promote the brand.


14 Jun 2011, 02:14 PM


jennifer08
I don't know if I truly believe this.....I'm an investor, familiar with the Marley Coffee in southern CA. My vote is still in for
JAMN. Some of this reporting is coming under false research as well.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/274707-jammin-java-cools-off-while-escaping-sec-heat 9/18


Its All Speculative
I have to agree with you here. I find these articles coming in too late to deal with the hyped pump-and-dump
schemes. It's fine to report on the scetchy marketers and the false claims; however, JAMN and the Marley
Coffee brand are real, and they are making steady progress in developing, marketing, and growing their
brand. They have clearly stated their target niche, they have aquired funding for sustainable growth, and they
continue to acquire market share. I think they will do well.


I have seen some articles that claim the company to be nothing more than a hollow nothing full of hype. To
those writers I say, go to thier website, order their coffee, then, email Rohan Marley himself. I did, and he
responded within 45 minutes. It's an ethical company, and I am quite impressed with their coffee and their
mission.


16 Jun 2011, 10:17 AM


jennifer08
Agreed with ClearPath - as an investor in the company and being familiar with the Marley coffee brand in Southern
CA, writers need to fully do their research before hyping negative articles.


14 Jun 2011, 02:21 PM


User 480986
Your report on JAMN sounds a lot like reverse HYPE. You have come out 2 x with negative stories hoping to drive the
price down and prosper from it. How are you different then the ones who over hype it to the upside. Yes, a lot of it was
over hype, but the company is for real and seems like on the right path. They are developing the contacts and
infrastructure that they need to get their product to the consumer and grow.


14 Jun 2011, 02:21 PM


caddlife
Yes, Jammin Java is a real company with an excellent product. Which In fact separates itself from this BGBR scam. I
use the Jammin Java product daily and it is the best coffee I have ever tasted. The short traders have mangled the
stock, but it still manages to somewhat recover before the vultures attack again. I suggest you bashing fools take a
look at what the company's potential is before running off at the mouth with your silliness. I agree, the John Bell scam
is wrong, but JAMN is not.


14 Jun 2011, 02:22 PM


levi613
how come all these pro JAMN posts are first timers or near first time posters?

well while you may want to help you are actually hurting those of us that really cant afford to lose the 5 - 10 Thousand
investment it may be all we have.. You cause people to get scared and sell causing loss for the rest of us.This is a
real company with employees mainly farmers. Think about the truth is it a con or is it a small company with a name
behind it ,Bob Marley, trying to sell organic coffee?

jackoblisk
As I tried to submit before, yet mysteriously it didn't publish. This article is written by bears who have interest in a
price decline, regardless of the fact that this company is legitimate and is trying to acquire market share actively. It is
these types of publications that are intended to influence investor psychology. As the 'TheClearPath' said, just read
the Disclosure paragraph, and all the prior writing before it is discounted.


14 Jun 2011, 02:43 PM


shirishsane
This is a great report and equally curious. The report shows great research and does a very good job of 'unearthing'
the suspicious promotions of the stock. The disclosure at the bottom turns the message upside down! Why is this
article written 'shortly' after shorting the stock and having to force cover it for a meager profit of a penny?


The said emails from 'John Bell' and such also had mentioned heavy short interests in the stock. Is this article part of
stock manipulation struggle between two opposite forces? I am not saying the John Bell emails are not a scam, they
may very well be. But this article seems like the other side of that scam.


Agreed that a short position of about 60K shares is pretty small compared to the average daily volume of about 5.5 M
shares over the past 3 moths, but could this be just one link in the chain - like the one mentioned in the article? 
BTW: I believe that the company itself, did file a report that all these 'promotions' are not sponsored by the company.


Can Seeking Alpha editors throw some light on this?


Thanks.

14 Jun 2011, 03:37 PM


YngvaiMalmsteve
Wow, it is amazing how many naive people are posting here.


First, everything in this article is factual. Just because it's negative and you happen to be long the stock, well, that's
tough. If you have evidence refuting anything in this article, please present it. And I mean evidence. Trying to shoot
the messenger by saying they were short the stock does not invalidate the evidence presented. The fact that Jim
Chanos was short Enron did not invalidate his evidence against Enron, did it?


Second, there is nothing illegal about taking a position in a stock and posting a negative article about the stock, IF the
information is factual...which it is.


Third, the fact that JAMN has a real product is irrelevant. Many pump and dumps have real products (NXTH is a
perfect example). JAMN hardly makes enough money with that real product to justify a $120 million market cap. The
only reason it is trading at this market cap is because it has been part of an aggressive and massive stock promotion
campaign. This article is revealing that reality, but unfortunately some of the posters here cannot seem to handle
reality.


JAMN is eventually going to fall under $1, just like every other pump and dump does.


14 Jun 2011, 05:50 PM


TSCash
Yng,


I can't speak for others. Therefore I will not attempt to do so.


That said, I am not going to imply that JAMN hasn't had problems, nor will I defend the actions of the "pump
and dump" specialists.


The main problem that I have with the articles is the part about shorting. In the disclosure, it states that they
effected a short sale on June 7. In the update, it states that they covered the short position on June 13.
Seeing as both the date of the short sale and the covering of that position occurred prior to the date of the
article, I must question why either the disclosure or the update were necessary.


Another part that bothers me is the continuing attempted linkage, by implication, of JAMN and BGBR.
Although there are similarities between the two, that does not necessarily mean that their respective
performances will mirror each other.


There are plenty of things in life that ostensibly resemble one another, but are, under the surface, quite
different. The Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) and the scarlet king snake (Lampropeltis triangulum
elapsoides) resemble each other; their appearance only differs in the order of the stripe pattern. Despite the
similarity in appearance, the former is venomous, while the latter is non-venomous and hunts other snakes.


My point in that little science lesson is that surface similarity does not necessarily equate to similarity of
modus operandi.

Lastly, first part of the article seems to suggest that the Securities and Exchange Commission is either
incompetent or engaged in some sort of malfeasance. I'm not very comfortable, for obvious reasons, with
either possibility.


20 Jun 2011, 11:54 AM

******** 
I must question why either the disclosure or the update were necessary. 
**********


Would you feel better if they DIDN'T disclose or update? Why?


It is good that they are offering complete disclosure and transparency. I'm amazed that you would imply that
this is somehow a bad thing.


************ 
Another part that bothers me is the continuing attempted linkage, by implication, of JAMN and BGBR.
Although there are similarities between the two, that does not necessarily mean that their respective
performances will mirror each other 
**************


So far the performances are mirroring each other quite well. JAMN continues to gradually fade like BGBR did,
and this was expected. It was a pump and dump, and it's behaving just like one. JAMN will continue to fade,
eventually falling under $1 and then into the pennies where it started.


 
************* 
The Texas coral snake (Micrurus tener) and the scarlet king snake (Lampropeltis triangulum elapsoides)
resemble each other; their appearance only differs in the order of the stripe pattern. Despite the similarity in
appearance, the former is venomous, while the latter is non-venomous and hunts other snakes. 
**************


So if you didn't know the stripe pattern, would you be willing to take the chance of getting bit by a snake that
could be venemous?


The similarities between BGBR and JAMN are important, because we're talking about people's money here
(just like you're talking about someone's life in terms of venemous snakes). If you're thinking about risking
money on a stock, it is important to know the similaritieis between JAMN and other pump and dumps first,
and if you're willing to take that chance.


The fact is, when investing your-hard earned money, you should always start from the stance of skepticism
rather than trust, especially on the OTCBB/pink sheets where scams and pump and dumps are prevalent.
People would lose a lot less money if they approached the market this way.

either possibility.  
************


Reality sometimes is uncomfortable.


When it comes to dealing with pump and dumps, the SEC is severely understaffed and is unable to go after
the numerous ones that exist.


You want another example of how the SEC is asleep at the wheel? Look at the AMEX stock ORS. This
company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and it's a Chinese RTO where fraud has been widespread. In fact,
many Chinese RTO's have been halted and delisted due to accounting scandals. There is strong evidence
taht ORS has also engaged in accounting fraud. On top of that, the stock, given its low float, has been highly
manipulated (I've watched it every day). It has run from $1 to $5 on no news at all. Yet the SEC hasn't done a
thing about it, despite having a committee devoted to investigating Chinese RTOs.


As I stated earlier, people were calling fraud on Bernie Madoff as early as 2001. Yet the SEC didn't do
anything until 2008.


Even the SEC's recent action against 17 penny stocks for microcap fraud came too late. Many of these have
already been pump and dumped a long time ago.


02 Jul 2011, 02:32 PM


TSCash
YngvaiMalmsteve, if you are going to quote me, please include the whole sentence that you are quoting. You
started after the comma. I stated that what made me question it is that both the disclosure and the update
predated the date of the post. If the dates are all correct, then there should have been no reason to post
either the disclosure or the update, because they would have been irrelevant to the article.


Your point about staying away from either snake if you didn't know the pattern is valid. However, just as valid
is that the caution would be unfounded in the case of the scarlet king snake. My point is that there are, in fact,
differences between the two stocks.


Let's put this another way. I have a twin sister. Because I am a guy, obviously we are not identical. If you
judged solely upon the criterion that we were born the same day, you might try to say that we were identical.
(Nothing could be further from the truth, as her hair is dark, while mine is light, I'm a good 8 inches taller, and
we are different genders.) But if you only look at the similarities, you assume a greater degree of similarity.


Another way to look at it is that hoofprints don't differentiate between a horse and a zebra.

The fact that the person exists and sent you an email doesn't mean he isn't a scam artist. I received his email
recommending I buy JAMN on June 6th. On June 7th I received another email under a different name telling
me that I should buy jamn on June 8th. 
Pump and dump is his game. Anyone that would buy jamn after looking at the financial records is a gambler
and would have a better chance at Vegas. Anyone who believes or follows John Bell recommendations
deserves to lose.

why does the SEC or any agency regulate a market and then when a stock with no revenue is ALLOWED to trade get
all bent out of shape when it does the inevitable? what do people think will happen, a penny stock will stay flat lined
forever?


humans trade on emotion, not data. exponential stock charts are everywhere. this graph is so typical you can find
abstractions of it in the CNBC, BTV, etc, 3 second splash screen at the beginning of a show between commercials.


don't allow pink sheet stocks if we're going to get bent out of shape. it's immoral to allow something to happen, then it
happens, then you whine about it. don't let them trade in the first place is the only moral answer.


but they won't do that.

"The amended license also gives Jammin Java a non-exclusive license to manufacture or sell any ready to drink
coffee drinks, tea products, chocolate products merchandising and coffee related equipment such as machines and
grinders."


"We are very excited about this amended license," says Rohan Marley, Chairman of Jammin Java Corp. -- Jammin
Java Corp. has the financial means, the executive team and the distribution backbone to really push the Marley
Coffee brand forward through all market segments."

New CEO for Jammin Java. Expanded exclusivity for US and Caribbean. Rohan Marley stays on board, sticks to guns
and to protect family name. That's what I expected. Brent Toevs is a coffee industry guy. If all true, it's starting to look
more and more like this start-up is finally leaving the doldrums behind.

Yes, ignore the promoters who seem like they're selling used cars. But there is more to this company than that.
Perhaps many others that Janice Shell has reported on have been exactly as she called them -- intended pump and
dumps. However, as I've said before, this may be a pump, but from the standpoint of the long run business connected
to Marley Coffee, I don't think the drivers of this company will dump this company or let it disintegrate. It deserves a
chance to flourish.

Now given that the SEC has been investigating JAMN, do you still think this is a worthwhile investment? Do
you still think I was wrong about this being a pump n dump?

And here's a nice pump n dump recap for 2011. If you still don't think JAMN is identical to all of these others,
you are delusional
