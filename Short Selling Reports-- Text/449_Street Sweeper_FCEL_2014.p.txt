FuelCell Energy: Will The Plug Be Pulled On This Overvalued
Company?

Summary


FuelCell Energy is poised to lose its biggest customer.


FuelCell has been riding high on a misconceived notion, handing it an absurdly
undeserved market cap approaching $1 billion.


The company is selling stock and we wouldn’t be surprised to see more.


Can't seem to scale.


Losing money faster than you can say, “Fool cells”.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


If only we lived in that magical world where we could scrape up leftovers from Sunday
dinner, plop them into a device, add a dollop of fat and presto - the air conditioner churns
on uninterrupted. And no messy rendering required between steps.


In that world, FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) might also become profitable. Or at least
its stock price would rise and fall based on FCEL itself, rather than the misconceived
mirroring of Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). Most of all, FCEL wouldn't be poised to lose its
biggest customer.


But this is the real world. And it's inconceivable to TheStreetSweeper how a company with
an accumulated deficit exceeding $797 million could be worth anything approaching $1
billion.


"Anytime you're a single-dollar or two-dollar stock, there's a reason you're a single-dollar
or two-dollar stock," said Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management. "They
announced they're cutting costs. Well, cutting costs is not what you always want to hear -
especially when it's a new concept company that doesn't have mass scale at this point."


The stock has a lot of people spooked. During "Lighting Round" Tuesday on CNBC,
analyst Jim Cramer said this about FCEL:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2439285-fuelcell-energy-will-the-plug-be-pulled-on-this-overvalued-company 2/27


"Ahhh, FuelCell! I mean, you know, these are just total rank speculation stories. I can't go
there," Cramer said.


"I've got a lot of solid companies that have really good fundamentals that are inexpensive,"
he added. "I'm not going FuelCell."


Indeed, this is a company that is:


1. Poised to lose its biggest customer.
2. Riding high on a misconceived notion.
3. Selling stock. And we wouldn't be surprised to see more.
4. Can't seem to scale.
5. Losing money faster than you can say, "Fool cells."
6. Sporting a completely unjustified market cap.


We see stubborn challenges for the Danbury, Conn.-based company that makes and sells
fuel cells that generate electricity.


FCEL did not respond to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment.


We agree with this recent article on FCEL, but investors may find both positive and
negative viewpoints on FCEL HERE.


MISIDENTIFICATION PROBLEM


The unprofitable company has gone airborne, flying from a $98 million market cap to $750
million in a flash. Rather than FCEL actually accomplishing much in that time - and we'll
explain below why we believe the company's main accomplishment is at risk - it has taken
advantage of a bad case of misidentification.


Investors have operated under the misconception that FCEL is the little brother of today's
fuel cell hot shot Plug Power, a company other short-sellers have told us is 60-70 percent
overvalued.


PLUG rocketed Aug. 14 on an earnings report showing more revenue and a penny cut in
losses to 4 cents a share, resulting in what we believe to be a short squeeze. All of which
pulled up Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) and FCEL right along with it.


Though FCEL had recently reported continued declining revenue, worse gross margins
and a greater net loss to investors - it became the biggest shocker of the trio. In the hours
and days of the full-blown fuel cell hysteria, the company's shares saw an 11 percent price
boost, far better than PLUG's own 4.4 percent or BLDP's 2.25 percent.

"Shareholders of FCEL have certainly had a bumpy ride," said Mr. Dollarhide.


Very rocky. All three stocks struck out on a phenomenal ride from March 1999 to March
2000, as the chart below shows. In about one year, the stocks rose well over 500 percent,
in FCEL's case a staggering 2,000-plus percent.


In that timeframe, fuel cell companies caught fire with news media and investors,
erroneously handing multi-billion-dollar valuations to companies still in the early stages of
testing. PLUG was selling for an adjusted price of $1,400 (~$6 now), BLDP then was
about $130 (~$4 now), while SatCon Technology (OTCPK:SATCQ) stock commanded an
adjusted price of $292 (~1 cent now).


Even though FCEL was still three years away from coming out with a commercial model,
the stock surged from $1.40 to an adjusted figure of $21.


Here's a look at the chart combining FCEL, PLUG and BLDP over the maximum
timeframe.


While PLUG and BLDP are related and might be expected to sometimes travel tandem,
FCEL is just along for the ride. PLUG focuses on fuel cell use in forklifts, while BLDP
actually supplies PLUG with fuel cells.


But fuel cells produced by FCEL are different. They are designed to convert natural gas -
or sometimes biomass - to hydrogen gas, which then generates electricity for use in onsite
plants and backup generation.


So, the FCEL niche is far different from the PLUG niche. They just all happen to be in the
fuel cell sector.


Take a look at the more recent stock charts, FuelCell first:

The stock movement among the three shows striking similarities. Hooking onto PLUG
might be good for FCEL this moment but the crowd can be fickle.


It's really beginning to sound like the type of wreck TheStreetSweeper has seen time and
again. Though FCEL lacks some bad traits of other companies we've written about, it falls
in line with trends in our report on another tiny, financed-to-death player that lost its key
customer, Revolution Lighting Technologies (RVLT: then $4, now $2) and our report on
The ExOne Co. (XONE: then $70, now $28), underdog to 3-D Systems (NYSE:DDD) part
of the once searing-hot 3D printing gang.


SELLING STOCK


FCEL has already pulled off one public stock offering this year in January, as well as a
private offering.


"They just recognized the prices are really high and they wanted to take advantage of the
situation," said an analyst who requested anonymity.


Now, we wouldn't be surprised if FCEL accomplished another raise in the future. We
believe a hint may be seen in recent analyst actions.


Though misplaced sentiment related to PLUG's earnings report sparked a big bump in
FCEL stock price, the initial jump came when Cowen upgraded FCEL to "outperform" from
"market perform" and slapped a $3 price target on it, sparking a move from $2.32 to $2.54
over three days before closing Tuesday at $2.81 and then opening Wednesday at $2.75.

One of the author/analysts formerly worked for Stifel Nicolaus, which managed FCEL's
equity raise early this year and assisted with one in 2012.


Stifel managed, with help from Cowen and Co., the Jan. 17-23, 2014 public offering of
25.3 million FCEL shares at just $1.25 apiece. New investors' shares got diluted about
$1.01 apiece. In stark contrast, FCEL bankers led by Stifel split about $1.5 million just for
handling the offering.


One month earlier, Stifel reiterated a "buy" rating and raised the price target a quarter to
$2. The report noted problems such as failure to convert pipeline projects into contracts
but said Stifel was "pleased to hear of pipeline growth and lack of obstacles in financing
for 2014…"


Cowen did not respond to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment.


FCEL inked another stock sale on July 30. Partner NRG Energy bought 14.6 million
shares of FCEL for project development and financing, and extended a $40 million loan.
Though this looks exciting at first glance, NRG, which now owns over 6 percent of FCEL,
last year reported a stunning $368 million net loss.


Now, with about 269 million shares outstanding, FCEL looks like a serial raiser.


We've got to wonder: If FCEL is really on the verge of profitability, why does it keep selling
shares? Even though the company had $72.7 million before its recent equity raises, it still
sold. Is it getting ready to sell more shares?


SCALE DIFFICULTIES


Though company filings warn, "We may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve
profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future," FCEL
execs have chatted up profitability for years.


"And within 2013, the latter part of 2013, early 2014 - based on the backlog and based on
the trajectory and the diversity we have in the revenue streams - we will attain profitability,
EBITDA basis…," CEO Chip Bottone said at the Needham Growth Conference on Jan.
16, 2013.


That hasn't happened.


In order to start making more money than it spends, FCEL needs to annually hit 80-90
megawatts. FCEL is at 70 megawatts now.

FCEL also keeps hyping 210 megawatts as the target. This is just a distraction that
certainly isn't going to happen anytime soon, if at all, in TheStreetSweeper's opinion. After
all, Posco built the largest fuel cell plant in the world - and it is just 60 megawatts. And
that's not much in the big picture, anyway. One megawatt is only enough power for about
1,000 homes.


In fact, scaling up is vital, but, unfortunately, selling fuel cells isn't all that easy.


The appeal has to reach both hearts and wallets. Based on cost of electricity by source, at
$150 per megawatt-hour, fuel cell technology can produce electricity for less than solar or
ocean power. But fuel cells work out to be close to three or four times pricier than coal.
And fuel cells are higher than wind and two to three times more expensive than natural
gas.


Subsidies help make fuel cells more attractive to customers, but these incentives vary
across the globe and are difficult to nab because sources such as wind and solar are
generally considered cleaner.


LOSING ITS BEST CUSTOMER?


Since December 2013, FCEL has been operating and maintaining its Bridgeport project
located in the middle of Bridgeport, Conn. The plant produces 14.9 megawatts of energy
which is purchased by Connecticut Light & Power under a 15-year plan. It is taking five
fuel cell power plants plus an organic rankine cycle turbine to produce enough power for
only 15,000 homes.


But FCEL's biggest customer is Posco Power, a partnership utilizing the South Korean
government's incentives for renewable energy to make and distribute fuel cell power
plants.


But here's the rub with Posco, FCEL's biggest shareholder at 12 percent ownership and
biggest customer at 75 percent of past six months' revenues. Though FCEL announced a
new contract to supply equipment to Posco - and this appears positive in respects to Mr.
Dollarhide and other analysts - this is another step in Posco's plan to acquire FCEL
technology and know-how. And, we believe, to kiss FCEL goodbye.


Here's how a recent article describes Posco's intent to continue developing a wide range
of fuel cells for its clean energy project started in 2007:


The company pledged to further develop the fuel cell technology as part of its energy
project, which would also help boost the nation's manufacturing industry.

"About 1,400 components are needed to build a fuel cell power plant. This helps create
jobs in the related field, as in our case where we work with about 380 contractors," Posco
Energy CEO Hwang Eun-yeon said.


"The company operates fuel cell power plants with a total capacity of 146 megawatts in 26
locations in South Korea…"


See this Google book for details about Posco using fuel cell technology to build its own
plants.


As it uses FCEL equipment and technology to build more of its own power plants, it's
obviously becoming more and more independent while FCEL steps deeper into the
shadows, clinging to relatively tiny licensing fees and royalties. Until, we believe, FCEL is
barely in the picture at all.


Mr. Dollarhide said it's common that such big investors like to diversify their overall energy
presence - or just as often "they'd like to develop the technology on their own."


FOOL CELL LOSSES


FCEL has been losing money faster than Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk can spit out
criticism of fuel cells.


"As people probably know, I'm not the biggest fan of fuel cells - I usually call them 'fool
cells,' " Mr. Musk said in Tesla's annual meeting in June.


Mr. Musk also called them "bull&*%$" last October, asserting that hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles are more a marketing ploy than long-term solution.


But there are many fans who believe that fuel cells will power the future. And many of
them have been willing to hang on to FCEL executives' prognostications and promises
that come quarter after quarter. But those pesky finances keep coming back to bite them.


In the most recent quarter, EBITDA was -$7.5 million and FCEL scored a jaw-dropping
124 percent increase in net losses.


In fact, the net loss was greater than any quarter since April 2011.


A drop in demand and higher costs fed those losses and, combined with analysts' average
estimates of a 3 cent loss rather than the 4 cents reported, investors hurled the stock price
downward by over 7 percent in 24 hours.


Here's a closer look at the quarter's financial numbers:

Product sales: $27.7m (2013 $34.4m 20%drop)


Gross margin: 4.2% (2013 5.5%)


Even if we can get past the risk of losing its biggest account, the misconceived parallel
with PLUG, stock selling, and difficulty scaling, those numbers tell the dirty tale behind this
clean technology company that's been dragging along for four decades.


"For every one or two winners I can think of 30 or 40 losers," said Mr. Dollarhide.
"Companies that had a great technology but couldn't scale it up in time. Couldn't make a
profit in time and either went under, went bankrupt or just became irrelevant.


"So, there's plenty of risk. Plenty of risk. Most of those companies had big investors and a
promising story and momentum at one time, too," Mr. Dollarhide added.


Yep, and when the cult decides another stock is the new, hot wave, then they're all going
to jump off and ride that hot wave. And FCEL, PLUG and BLDP will get killed,
TheStreetSweeper believes. We think FCEL will be the first to go.

With a couple weeks left until earning it's well worth the brief time to see how relationships with Posco, NRG, DOE
and in Europe are coming along. Street Creeper articles are well know tools for using rumor and innuendo to frighten
uninformed shareholders to jump ship.


A couple of weeks are well worth the potential upside surprise!

You should never buy an investment within a month either side of earnings; period. The stock price during
that time doesn't follow a company's real value. One would be better off betting on a crap shoot!

At 2.61 FCEL is trading at more than $700,000,000. That is more bizarre than if you bought a $60,000
Cadillac for $7,000,000.


The Cadillac CVS is a beautiful car but paying $7,000,000 is stupid.


All shareholders of FCEL are stupid because this stock will drop to $.25. Sell it at $2.61 -- hold the cash until it
sells for $.25 and buy 10X more shares. If you own 10,000 now you'll own 100,000 for the same money. Add
more cash while you wait and buy 200,000 shares. Its a gamble with no risk.


Use SA TO ORGANIZE a takeover. This is legitimate capitalism. If FCEL happens to trade over $3.00 sell
short. There is no possible way FCEL will make any profit much less $27,000,000. ($.01 per share)

I'm a mid nite tokin fool. That's when I get my brilliant ideas.


If FCEL made profits some day it won't matter. They have 200,000,000 shares too many. The market will take
all the girl's pants down anyway. Cash out of everything now at over 17000 Dow. Sit tight until the Dow breaks
below 6000. The Fed's crazy, stupid printing trillions will prove worthless if we're lucky and the dollar isn't
destroyed too.


My cash is where it can't lose a penny. I'm not in a bunker with canned food and pistols. My remedy is elect a
Libertarian government. We need to change all power to hydrogen by h2o, not nat gas. Free water flowing
into the ocean using electrolysis from massive solar and wind. Germany has built square miles of solar. 25%
of Germany's power is solar and wind right now.

Galactic Potential Investments, Contributor
This article has so many inaccuracies, false equivalences, and misleading quotes that it is truly a spectacle to behold.
The relation of FCEL's grid-based technology to Elon Musk's comment is truly inappropriate. FYI, FCEL has scaled up
its technology, leveraging POSCO's investment and global footprint, and is ready to go EBITDA positive in early 2015.
If anything, FCEL has the more solid business footing of the 3 "fuel cell" names out there. With such a glib and
specious short thesis, you're going to lose on your short position here.

All you need to know is FCEL has 256,000,000 shares. 200,000,000 too many.

There's some pretty bogus numbers in this report, enough to make this a pretty shallow analysis. For example, the
210MW she quotes from Chip Bottone includes the 100MW at POSCO and similar production at the start of
production at their new facility in Europe. The are NOT talking about tripling the 70MW at Torrington, CT.


The license fees and royalties that FCEL will earn are NOT tiny. They are comparable to their profit margin on their
own sales. The drop in revenue is mostly due to replacing shipments of complete units to Korea with kits for POSCO
to assemble. Same number of MW, but kits are cheaper. But the profit per MW shipped is about the same.


Another example is the assertion that "Natural Gas is cheaper". Most of Fuelcell Energy's fuel cells ARE running on
natural gas. Such a statement demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the industry.


That both their POSCO and NRG partners have recently taken significant stakes in FCEL shows that those insiders
have a very different view of the company's prospects than The Streetsweeper".

When posco STEALS THE fcel technology from FCEL IT'LL be bye bye stupid Americans. Koreans are very
smart and would love to make a fortune on the FCEL technology. Even if FCEL wins a lawsuit they can't
collect any money.

"The license fees and royalties that FCEL will earn are NOT tiny. They are comparable to their profit margin
on their own sales."


You aren't specific because you don't know. The stupidity of issuing 200,000,000 shares too many proves
Bottone is capable of unlimited stupidity. A $25,600,000 profit is only $.01 per share. Bottone and senior
management are embezzling huge sums. How much embezzlement would it take before you people
recognize it? Taking bonuses while creating huge losses and selling stock for $1.50 per share is
embezzlement. The stockholders have a class action law suit they need to file because the SEC and DOJ
won't do their job.

"You aren't specific because you don't know."


Actually, they have announced the exact terms of the licensing deal in the past. I just wasn't sure I recalled
them correctly, and so didn't want to quote anything without taking the time to go look them up. If you took the
time to browse through the company's past press releases instead of bad-mouthing people, you'd find them.

Wow, I'm amazed that you were able to actually glean a thing or two correct above. What did you spend about 10
minutes boning up on FCEL? Do you even understand that FCEL and PLUG serves completely different markets?
PLUG dosent even currently manufacture fuel cells.....I'm always tickled when short sellers use "cautionary language"
from 10-K's to scare nubies and those who bougth on margin. Though company filings warn, "We may never become
profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future,"


And again Elon Musk's comments are targeted at fuel cell cars not stationary power, I doubt he gives a rats ass about
stationary power but great misuse for your personal propaganda.

My favorite part of this hack job article is stating that they are poised to lose their biggest customer. This is strictly
supposition. Asian companies value loyalty way more than American companies and its not like they are losing
money to keep FCEL involved or would risk lawsuits trying to cut them out entirely.


20 Aug 2014, 03:41 PM


steve miller70
Risk lawsuits? FCEL can't collect any money in Korea. Winning a lawsuit against POSCO means nothing.


Being ignorant about the power of the SEC that prosecutes nobody. Only the DOJ has the power to prosecute
any criminal. These are facts, not opinions.


Paying $2.50 for FCEL THAT HAS 269,000,000 shares outstanding is the dumbest investment imaginable.
Adding that to buying stock when all economic reports are false is dumber. Part time jobs are putting
49,000,000 Americans on food stamps right now. This will get much worse. When the Dow starts down it will
be an avalanche dropping below 6000.


Small investors are absent from this absurd rally over 17,000. Maybe small investors finally understand the
vivid corruption aided by the corrupt Attorney General who refused to prosecute Darren Wilson who gunned
down Michael Brown because he's black. The prosecutor hasn't offered any reason to justify this murder.


Only white people want to protect the cop. White people are disgusting hypocrites. They are too stupid to
understand the stock market. Corruption means nothing to white hypocrites. There is a stench coming from
the SEC that has severely reduced volume of trading stocks.


FCEL at $2.61 ($700,000,000 market cap) proves my point in spades. Only idiots have bought this dilution.
I'm not short. I own no shares. If you want to learn my credentials read my book, Just Cause Just Facts on
Amazon. I expose the US Supreme Court and 3 attorneys general plus the media.

Americans are brainwashed by daily media propaganda. The entire country is in a deep swamp. The swamp
of hypocrisy is a trance so powerful nobody but me notices it. FCEL is one glaring example.


Grab your cash asap, put it in the bank at 0% and wait for FCEL to collapse. Then buy 10X more stock at
$.25 than you sold for $2.61.


FB will never make a profit, FCEL can make billions of $$ if people ever realize that hydrogen is the only
remedy for climate change.

The author has no idea about this company and is purposely taking advantage of a public non-supervised site to lie. It
is one thing to have an opinion but quite another to obviously lie about publicly reported facts in order to get the stock
down. This person should be flagged by Seeking Alpha and the writer should be banned from future articles.


To point out one outstanding lie in the paragraph listed under MISIDENTIFICATION PROBLEM 
This information is available in the Annual Report or 10K.


The author says, Though FCEL had recently reported continued declining revenue, worse gross margins. 
Here are the numbers right out of the 10K 
(in Millions)

As you can see, there was CONTINUED improvement every quarter except two.


The second quarter of 2014 was the only down revenue quarter in over two and a half years. This was because they
had just finished the installation of Bridgeport in the first quarter 2014 and had no large installation in Q2. Gross profit
was down in Q1 3013 due to a one-time stack replacement issue that was resolved that quarter.

But then, the executives at NRG are insiders in the maturing natural gas businesses. Their investment in FCEL could
be based upon sound information concerning the evolving natural gas supply and price structure. If that's the case,
they cannot comment on what they know, but they can act on it. Uh, which they apparently did.

Harvard and Yale need to be discredited for giving MBA degrees to all their graduates. Too bad the facts don't

If NRG didn't get subsidies from our treasury in return for the bribes they pay Congressmen you dopes keep
electing -- NRG would go broke now. All FCEL shareholders will be destroyed if they fail to sell now. Be ready
to buy this stock at $.25 when the panic hits. It might go to $.05. Panics produce great opportunities.

Certainly not an objective look at FCEL. Seemed more like a hit piece to do exactly what was intended: Drive the

Shame on SA for choosing to publish such an article when it has hundreds of article submissions each day, according

When the entire stock market comes crashing down it will take FCEL with it. I wouldn't go short but cashing
out now at $2.50 and waiting to buy 10 times more stock at $.25 would be the prudent gamble right now.
Gambling without risk is a great bet.


NRG, UIL, and D are using FCEL for the long haul. The Dow will collapse under 6000 by 2016. The 2016

Short selling isn't a crime. In the FCEL case they can't be wrong. The obvious problem that trumps any other
issue is the 269,000,000 shares outstanding. Nothing else matters.


Management salaries are criminal. Embezzlement is a crime. Bottone needs to be prosecuted. If
management took 10 times more for diluting the shares they still wouldn't be prosecuted by shareholders.


If I was a stockholder I would file a criminal charge with the FBI for embezzlement. How much more can this
management embezzle before stockholders wake up?

publisher serving clients who are short Fuel Cell. If not interested in the stock and don't own it good for you. Glad to
see some of the comments because it indicates one who makes up their own minds and buys accordingly. The
market seems to be a haven for Charletons and they are fueled (pun intended) by the number of hits their article gets

According to a new report from Navigant Research, global stationary fuel cell revenue will grow from $1.4 billion in
2013 to $40.0 billion in 2022.


Grid resiliency, increasing financing options helping to drive the market, report concludes


The stationary fuel cell sector continues to be the vanguard of the overall global fuel cell industry. As the focus on grid
stability increases and the costs associated with natural disasters rise, the use of fuel cells as small distributed power
plants for grid stabilization and backup is moving forward more rapidly, in terms of megawatts and revenue, than any
other fuel cell sector.

While it appears to me that the author is unaware of the Royalities FCEL reportedly is set to receive from POSCO
based upon future sales and that low natural gas prices may substantially benefit FCEL in the US in electrical
generation in the future, I did sell FCEL a number of months ago during that parabolic spike up as it seemed
"irrational exuberance".


Note: I sold FCEL and bought a young Canadian fuel cell company (OTCQB:MVTG) that possibly seems to have the
right viable fuel cell technology and patents for a low price efficient fuel cells using safe and non-flammable formic
acid. MVTG also has patents to convert CO2 pollution emissions from almost any factory in the world into a favorable
safer and cost efficient fuel cell source that in my opinion may revolutionize the fuel cell industry within the next 6 to 9
months.


MVTG holds patents in China, India, the UK, the US and Europe. MVTG is a spec and high risk/reward so do your
own due diligence and research but this spec may turn out to be the real stand out in the fuel cell technology world.


 Also. MVTG is Scheduled by Feb 2015 to have a fuel cell vehicle ready for demonstration. Research MVTG's
website at: http://bit.ly/1nGERsT Offices now in Hong Kong, Germany and Vancouver and large multi-billion dollar
companies are apparently in discussion or working with them already.

I avoid buying stocks with no earnings, no cash flow and no dividends like FCEL. However, I do look at charts and
technical analysis sometimes. And this chart looks bullish to me! Very nice basing pattern (april to august) followed by
a breakout and a pullback. The chart says this should get to 3.5 in a few weeks. If I was trading this, I would place a

Some passages barrowed from articles over the last few months regarding FuelCell Energy.


1. "FuelCell Energy, a global leader in the design, manufacture, operation and service of ultra-clean, efficient and
reliable fuel cell power plants", exactly what does a company with that title have to do with the price of a tank of gas.


2. "The 5.6 Megawatt project from United Illuminating, Connecticut and 1.4 Megawatt project from Irvine Medical
Centre, University of California are the most recent awards for the company.", does this sound like a company in
trouble.


3. "Most of FuelCell's US power plants are in California and Connecticut. Both states enacted RPS programs.
California enacted legislation in 2010 increasing its clean energy requirement from 20% to 33%. California is
developing plans to deploy 12,000 megawatts of distributed generation by 2020. Connecticut's RPS requires utilities
to purchase 20% of their peak electricity needs, or about 1,000 megawatts, from clean power sources by 2020.", think
other states may head in this direction?

4. "Direct FuelCell(NYSE:R) power plants are generating ultra-clean, efficient and reliable power at more than 50
locations worldwide. With more than 300 megawatts of power generation capacity installed or in backlog, FuelCell
Energy is a global leader in providing ultra-clean base load distributed generation to utilities, industrial operations,
universities, municipal water treatment facilities, government installations and other customers around the world. The
Company's power plants have generated more than 2.6 billion kilowatt hours of ultra-clean power using a variety of
fuels including renewable biogas from wastewater treatment and food processing, as well as clean natural gas.",
clean energy a concept that makes sense wouldn't you say?


5. "Posco, South Korea’s largest steelmaker and FuelCell’s biggest shareholder, will use the equipment to build power
plants for customers in Korea this year, Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell said today in a statement. Terms
weren't disclosed. The order is in addition to FuelCell’s monthly shipments to Posco to meet an existing 122-
megawatt order", does not sound very adversarial to me.


6. Posco is FCELs largest shareholder so it makes perfect sense to do everything in their power to trash the stock,
right? Or does it make more sense to continue a fruitful partnership.

POSCO will make much more money when it can use the FCEL technology for itself building fuel cell plants
around the world. Americans are backward, ignorant people. Koreans are playing Bottone for a fool. FCEL
will tank with the entire market as America keeps adding millions of part time jobs. There are 49,000,000
Americans on food stamps now. That number was only 26,000,000 in 2006.


Americans keep electing a crime family taking bribes ordained by the US Supreme Court. The entire country
is in a deep trance from daily media propaganda. Americans specialize in ignorance while they refuse to
consider the vivid evidence that 9/11 was a massive George bush conspiracy. Americans have the audacity to
claim they are exceptional.


The government covers up the racist cop who murdered Michael Brown. That cop should have been arrested
on the spot. Wall Street is filled with criminals who never get prosecuted because they are paying bribes to
Obama on down. The hypocrisy swamp has no bottom.

I have to say FCEL merely gave up one day as we closed Wednesday at or within a penny of Monday's closing price.
In my honest opinion, Cramer's staff chose the FCEL caller to help Short's cover, to help FSLR Long's, as well as he
dismisses good stocks on the rise and recommends going with the stocks he owns in his charitable trust even if those
stocks and charts are horrible... Also notice Cramer, The Street, Seeking Alpha, Barron's, ~ were all timed for
maximum effect to scare weak hands, wipe out stops, and help Short's cover... Most of us are buying even more if
FCEL dips more but I wanted the frustrated to get a better understanding... We Long's and Trader's need to spread
the accurate words of FCEL as it's being suppressed by Big Oil and Traditional Coal Burning Power Plants! z4

Looks to me like FCEL had about 38% institutional investors in the first part of the year and about 12% shorts, now
FCEL has about 47% institutional investors and still has 12% shorts. Somebody must be running scared and it's not
the longs.

Just bought 500 more shares at $2.50, thanks whoever wrote these articles.


21 Aug 2014, 10:25 AM


steve miller70
Wow, $1250. I'm impressed. When FCEL hits $.25 you could have bought 5000 shares.


Bernanke and Janet Yellin believe they can print trillions of dollars for the economy to recover. If it was that
easy, print $10,000,000,000,000 more today. This is how ignorant the American society is.


If the government had any clue the entire power industry would be converted to hydrogen. Free water flowing
into the ocean could be converted by electrolysis from free solar and free wind. How can that cost more than
digging and shipping hundreds of millions of tons of coal every day, spilling oil everywhere, and highly
subsidized nuclear?


Energy is totally controlled by the government taking bribes from coal, oil, and nuclear executives. Hydrogen
has no chance competing with those subsidized fuel sources.

Sonya: You've cast aspersions about FCEL, but you've been notably absent from this entire conversation. There are a
number of counterpoints to be addressed (read the thread), including the obvious concerns over your dirty data, which
requires your feedback.


Please share with us: do you create your own analysis and spiffy charts or are they provided to you by outside
organizations such as the Cramer-ikidz, as alleged in the thread earlier; whereby you (possibly) add your own
journalistic/nihilistic slants, or maybe Sweeper just provides a facade that other shorts/sponsors can hide behind?

If instead, you've been enlightened by the facts provided in this thread, please be a good sport and retract or provide
some meaningful counterpoints to the earlier inaccuracies.


FCEL is a good company with the potential of one day being a great company. Sweeper should stop bullying the little
guys that are trying very hard to make a start and instead focus your negativity on the bigger fish. As you're well
aware, there's plenty of bigger fish you can choose from.

Which newspapers?


Can you name 1 of the "impressive pile" of journalism awards?


It is VERY PECULIAR you do not mention these. Unless you elaborate,


I think it is safe to assume these claims are FALSE.

From the link it appears that Sweeper is engaged in malfeasance. That's why I feel it should be reported as
Abuse to SA. I'm sure that SA doesn't condone such activity and will promptly ban Sweeper from the site.


As a responsible organization, they should also follow up with a news release calling out the incident and
apologizing to companies like FCEL injured by the criminals.

FCEL management diluted the stock making it worthless. If FCEL ever manages to make $27,000,000 profit
that's only $.01 per share. At $1 the stock will be trading at 100X earnings.


Sell the stock now, put the money in the bank until FCEL hits $.25. Buy 10 x more stock than you sold for no
risk. We will kick out Bottone, buy back 200,000,000 shares at $.20 for $40,000,000 and make a fortune.


FCEL has a great product that we will sell at a profit. The stock will trade over $500 per share based on
earnings. Bottone might blow the $72,000,000 FCEL has right now. We need the $40,000,000 to buy back
200,000,000 shares at $.20.


If we use SA effectively to organize shareholders to grab the $2.61 bid right now. Put the cash in your bank
and wait.

They should actually be prosecuted by the SEC,


but they know the SEC is a lame duck that is just window dressing.


They seem to target small caps, figuring no one cares enough to scrutinize them.


Problem is, everything is circumstantial- to get a conviction one of them would have


to "turn" and testify against the others. I think it is enough that we have


IDENTIFIED these low-lifes and understand their method of operation.

The SEC never prosecutes, only the DOJ prosecutes. connectedguy is a perfect example of ignorance.

The economy is imploding. At some point the entire stock market will crash. I am waiting for 6000 Dow.


Stay in your trance and lose most of your money. Hydrogen has no chance unless the government is
removed by election.


Good luck to all American fools in a deep trance. 49,000,000 Americans qualify for food stamps because all
new jobs are part time. Customers are necessary for capitalism. 500,000 full time workers were fired last
month replaced by part time workers. The work goes to Chinese slaves.

The ones to approach are Sonya Colberg and Melissa Davis, they are the weak links, being the most visible and

256,424,681 shares outstanding April 30, 2014 
$(797,636,000) accumulated deficit = $3.11 per share 
Cash April 30, 2014 $64,254,000


Losing any of this cash now before the price tanks below $.20 will eliminate buying back 200,000,000 shares. Nothing
unprofitable should be shipped.


Service agreements and license revenue barely break even. What's the point? 
$5,746,000 administrative and selling expense need to be chopped to $3,000,000 until there is positive cash (not
cash flow).


This so-called management of buffoons are sitting around trading shares instead of doing any work. There are orders
that should be filled at the rate they claim is profitable until there is nothing left to manufacture. The entire hydrogen
industry has done no PR to make it clear that hydrogen is the only remedy for climate change. The evidence of dead
coral reefs, dead forests, droughts, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes plus the enormous subsidies to oil, coal, and
nuclear make comparisons for the cost of hydrogen false.

If there were no subsidies for any fuel, hydrogen would be profitable. Calculate oil spills and radiation from spent fuel
rods that can't be stored. Calculate the poisoned water in West Virginia that couldn't be used for anything. The media
covers up these disasters. People are kept ignorant so oil, coal, and nuclear executives can rip off huge salaries and
bonuses.


Fortunes could be made from hydrogen investments if shareholders snapped out of their trance and elected a new
party. Energy will always be political.

There is just way too much technology for SA to understand here. They should have known it would take a great
amount of R&D back in the late 90's for development. They tried hard to pump and short it early on and a lot of smart
analyst lost their britches for playing along. Now the R&D has paid off and mankind is a decade farther along in this
amazing development. The poor analyst remain desperate to claim that this stock is just a muse with no potential. As
if the share price is way overvalued at $2.61, while shares of Krispy Kremes are selling at $16.75. Note to my critics: I
get it.... apples and oranges like doughnuts and fuel cells.

Interesting note from CEO Chip Bottone here:


http://tinyurl.com/prf...


"This project is making measurable progress for providing an efficient and cost effective carbon concentration and
capture solution for coal-fired power plants, which has compelling market applicability,"


With a solution from FCEL that can clean up the harmful effect of burning coal, while generating power at the same
time ... anyone else thinking big coal can make a comeback?


28 Aug 2014, 01:57 PM

Chip Bottone destroyed the market for the FCEL product by enhancing coal. He is being paid by FCEL stockholders
to destroy the overwhelming benefit for hydrogen fuel cells stationary power plants.


This proves the ignorance of any investor of FCEL shares.
