Perkins	Oil	&	Gas:	A	'Shell	Risk'	Stock	Inflated	By	A	False	And
Misleading	Stock	Promotion

Summary


Zero	assets,	zero	revenue,	no	employees	and	a	"Shell	Risk"	designation.


The	company's	original	incorporator	was	suspended	from	practicing	law	before	the
SEC	for	his	role	in	a	public	shell	creation	scheme.


Shares	are	being	inflated	due	to	an	ongoing	penny	stock	promotion	campaign	that	is
both	materially	false	and	misleading.


Perkins	Oil	&	Gas,	Inc.	(OTCPK:OOIL)	was	incorporated	in	the	state	of	Nevada	on	May
25,	2012,	to	engage	in	the	exploration	and	development	of	oil	and	gas	properties.
Previously,	the	company	listed	several	nominal	assets	on	its	balance	sheet,	such	as	a
25%	working	interest	and	an	18.75%	net	revenue	interest	in	an	oil	and	gas	lease	located
in	Louisiana	that	was	purchased	for	$17,500	in	June	2012,	according	to	a	Form	S-1/A	filed
in	May	2013.


Currently,	Perkins	Oil	&	Gas	can	be	summed	up	as	follows:


Zero	assets	listed	on	the	most	recent	10-Q	for	the	quarter	ending	December	31,	2018;
Zero	revenue	ever	reported;
An	accumulated	deficit	of	over	$23M;
No	press	releases	or	company	announcements	in	years;
The	company's	website	()	does	not	load;
The	company's	telephone	number	(201-730-6454)	goes	right	to	voicemail;
There	is	a	"Shell	Risk"	designation	on	OTCMarkets.com,	indicating	that	the	company
displays	characteristics	common	to	Shell	Companies;
There	are	currently	no	employees	and	one	sole	officer	(Sonny	Arandia)	who	appears
to	live	in	the	Philippines	and	only	devotes	2-4	hours	per	week	to	company	matters
according	to	the	company's	most	recent	10-K.

During	the	course	of	our	research	into	the	company,	we	have	come	to	the	conclusion	that
Perkins	Oil	&	Gas	does	not	appear	to	be	an	operating	business.


Despite	all	of	these	seemingly	bearish	characteristics,	OOIL	currently	trades	with	a	market
cap	of	around	$92M	and	the	stock's	share	price	and	relative	trading	volume	have
skyrocketed	since	March	21,	2019.	As	this	report	will	outline,	this	recent	surge	in	OOIL
trading	can	be	entirely	attributed	to	an	ongoing	paid	stock	promotion	campaign	that	is	both
materially	false	and	misleading.


Similar	to	all	of	the	other	penny	stocks	that	we	have	reported	on	since	2013,	we	are
confident	that	OOIL	will	fall	by	90-99%	in	the	short-term	and	unless	there	are	material
changes	within	the	organization,	shares	will	eventually	go	to	zero.


We	have	attempted	to	contact	the	issuer	by	both	telephone	and	email	regarding	our
concerns	and	have	received	no	response	as	of	the	date	of	this	article's	publication.


A	Checkered	Past	Since	Inception


The	company's	original	articles	of	incorporation	list	an	individual	named	Robert	Weaver	as
the	incorporator:


(Author's	Note:	the	screenshot	above	has	been	modified	to	make	it	easier	for	readers	to
view	the	original	incorporator's	name)


Based	on	the	name	and	mailing	address	of	the	incorporator	listed	on	the	articles	of
incorporation,	this	appears	to	be	Robert	C.	Weaver	Jr.	who	was	suspended	from
appearing	or	practicing	law	before	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	for	his	role	in
a	scheme	"to	create,	register	and	sell	15	public	shell	companies	putatively	engaged	in
mining	operations."

The	SEC	complaint	against	individuals	including	OOIL’s	original	incorporator	Robert	C.
Weaver	outlines	how	15	purported	mining	companies	did	not	intend	to	engage	in	any
actual	mining.	Rather,	they	were	incorporated	for	the	purpose	of	creating	and	later	selling
OTC-listed	shell	companies.


With	no	assets,	no	historical	revenue	and	no	recent	corporate	operations,	Perkins	Oil	&
Gas	bears	a	striking	resemblance	to	these	15	public	shell	companies	that	never	engaged
in	any	meaningful	mining	operations.


Past	Share	Purchases	By	Offshore	Entities	Followed	By	Unusual
Trading


Prior	to	a	ticker	symbol	change	that	occurred	in	tandem	with	a	1:25	reverse	stock	split,
Perkins	Oil	&	Gas	traded	under	the	ticker	symbol	PEKN.	About	six	months	after	it	was	first
announced	that	4,750,000	shares	of	common	stock	were	sold	to	an	offshore	entity	Regale
Consultants	Ltd.,	the	stock	experienced	an	abnormal	surge	in	trading	volume	and	the
stock	jumped	by	about	500%.


(Author's	Note:	the	OOIL	stock	chart	above	displays	stock	prices	that	reflect	the	1-for-25
reverse	stock	split	that	became	effective	on	February	1,	2018)


Shortly	after	peaking,	the	stock	plummeted	by	more	than	95%.	The	company’s	2017	and
2018	annual	reports	disclosed	a	total	$0	and	$304	total	assets	during	these	inflated
trading	periods	with	no	meaningful	business	developments	occurring.


It	is	our	opinion	that	history	is	about	to	repeat	itself	with	a	similar	95%	drop.

Current	OOIL	Stock	Promotion


Just	after	the	opening	bell	on	Thursday,	March	21,	2019,	we	received	the	first	of	eighteen
emails	touting	OOIL	–	all	sent	from	a	penny	stock	promotion	website
PennyStockProTips.com.


(Author's	Note:	the	"To"	email	address	in	the	screenshot	above	has	been	removed	by	the
Author	but	was	originally	sent	to	an	email	address	that	we	manage	for	tracking	penny
stock	promotional	newsletters)


The	contents	of	these	emails	are	both	materially	false	and	misleading.	For	example:


On	March	21,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“OOIL	owns	a	160-acre	lease
in	Colorado”	and	“OOIL	also	owns	640	acres	in	Wyoming”	whereas	in	reality,	the
company’s	most	recent	10-Q	&	10-K	both	disclose	zero	assets.

On	March	22,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“OOIL	has	all	the	assets
required	to	make	a	big	move.”	Recall,	this	company	has	no	assets.
On	March	25,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“OOIL	is	possibly	sitting	on
more	than	$500	million	of	energy	resources.”
On	March	26,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“OOIL	can	now	drill	on	every
single	one	of	its	leases	which	I	estimate	could	hold	between	$500	million	and	$900
million	worth	of	oil	and	natural	gas.”
On	March	27,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“your	upside	potential	could
easily	be	more	than	5,000%	from	current	prices	but	you’ve	got	to	buy	shares	as	soon
as	possible	today.”
On	April	2,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“the	stock	used	to	trade	at	$120
per	share	and	a	very	specific	event	brought	it	all	the	way	down	to	65	cents:	The
Obama	ban	on	drilling.”
On	April	3,	2019,	an	OOIL	promotional	email	stated,	“OOIL	is	just	getting	started	and	I
think	that	people	who	buy	the	stock	today	at	around	$3	can	still	potentially	make
4,000%	from	current	prices	if	OOIL	goes	back	to	its	pre-drilling-ban	high	of	$120.”


At	the	bottom	of	these	promotional	emails,	it	is	disclosed	that	(1)	pennystockprotips.com	is
being	paid	to	distribute	these	emails	and	(2)	pennystockprotips.com	will	be	selling	shares
of	the	company’s	stock	at	the	same	time	the	profile	is	being	disseminated.

(Author's	Note:	the	screenshot	above	has	been	modified	to	highlight	the	important
disclosure	facts	regarding	compensation	received	and	the	fact	that	shares	will	be	sold
during	the	promotional	campaign)


Similar	to	the	last	time	OOIL	shares	surged	while	trading	as	PEKN,	this	is	all	happening
less	than	one	year	after	some	large	share	issuances	to	anonymous	offshore	entities.


Specifically,	a	total	2,500,000	shares	of	OOIL	stock	were	issued	at	a	debt	conversion	price
of	$0.004	per	share.	Since	these	shares	were	issued	to	offshore	entities	under	the
Regulation	S	exemption	of	the	Securities	Act	of	1933,	the	shares	are	free-trading	and	can
be	sold	in	the	open	market	at	anytime.


Since	the	start	of	the	ongoing	OOIL	stock	promotion	campaign,	shares	have	topped	$3.
This	means	that	the	anonymous	offshore	entities	have	turned	a	$10,000	promissory	note
into	OOIL	shares	worth	over	$7,500,000	despite	the	company	owning	zero	assets	and
announcing	no	corporate	developments	since	2016.

Conclusion


When	a	U.S.-based	company	with	no	assets,	a	telephone	number	that	goes	right	to
voicemail,	no	working	website,	a	virtual	office	as	a	headquarters	and	no	employees
located	in	the	U.S.	is	subjected	to	a	false	and	misleading	promotional	campaign	that
encourages	people	to	buy	shares	of	a	worthless	company	trading	at	an	artificially	inflated
valuation	of	$92M,	we	believe	that	there	is	a	major	public	interest	concern.


Don’t	expect	that	there	will	always	be	a	greater	fool	to	purchase	Perkins	Oil	&	Gas's
shares.	By	any	rational	person’s	analysis,	shares	are	completely	worthless	and	as	soon
as	the	current	promotional	campaign	runs	out	of	steam,	the	stock	will	almost	certainly
collapse.


Disclosure:	I/we	have	no	positions	in	any	stocks	mentioned,	and	no	plans	to	initiate	any	positions	within	the	next	72
hours.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than
from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.
