Equity Ownership In Patriot Coal Shares Threatened By Bankruptcy
Proceedings

(Editors' Note: This article covers a micro-cap stock. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


The GeoTeam has come across yet another bankruptcy play in Patriot Coal Corporation
(OTCQB:PCXCQ). On July 17, 2013 and July 29, 2013 we wrote about K-V
Pharmaceuticals (KVPHQ.PK), a story that for a moment offered a glimmer of hope that
common shareholders could survive a Chapter 11 process. Unlike KVPHQ, we believe
that shareholders of bankrupt company PCXCQ have a ZERO percent chance of retaining
any equity ownership, if and when the company emerges from Chapter 11 proceedings.
All of the facts support an imminent scenario that will see current common interests being
wiped away, on or before October 31, 2013.


On August 23, 2013, an article by Ashraf Eassa was published on Seeking Alpha that
effectively highlights the financial bind that Patriot is in. Here is our take on the story, with
additional facts that should convince even the irrational investor that common shareholder
interests will be ignored during a Chapter 11 restructuring process.


Misplaced Hope of Equity Shareholders


Given the dire state of Patriot's operation (to be discussed later), we see no chance that a
funding party will come to the rescue of common shareholders. On the contrary, potential
funders would likely require that current equity interests be cancelled so that new shares
can be issued to them.


There are facts that indicate that on or before October 31, 2013 Patriot could file its
restructuring plan. At the same time, we anticipate that filings will likely state that current
equity interests will be cancelled; this should set off a mass exodus from PCXCQ stock.


As Mr. Eassa pointed out, many investors appear to be misinterpreting recent
developments. On August 20, 2013 Patriot stated that the court approved a decision that
pension obligations totaling $1.4 billion could be transferred away from the company to its
former parent company, Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU). Employees to whom the related
pension funds are entitled will receive 35% of the Post Reorganization Equity. For some

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1657822-equity-ownership-in-patriot-coal-shares-threatened-by-bankruptcy-proceedings 2/9


reason, it seems that some current equity investors have taken this development to mean
that their ownership interests will be retained upon PCXCQ's possible emergence from
bankruptcy. This couldn't be further from the truth.


This development alone begins to tell us that current equity interests are beginning to be
compromised. In the end, the creditors, potential funders and the Union representing the
workers are not going to approve a plan where they would not own all the interests in the
new equity - especially in a case like Patriot where risks to survival seem large.


Other additional clues exist that should warn the bullish equity shareholder that their
shares in Patriot will soon be worthless. Each builds a progressively stronger case against
holding shares of PCCXQ.


Clue 1- Verbiage from the Stock Fund Plan Amendment


"This Amendment is being filed to deregister any and all unsold securities
registered pursuant to, and to terminate the effectiveness of, the Registration
Statement. Effective June 28, 2012, the Company ceased offering the
Common Stock pursuant to the Plan and all shares of the Common Stock then
held in the Patriot Stock Fund of the Plan were sold. Participants can no
longer invest in the Common Stock through the Plan."


Clue 2- Verbiage from Patriot's website


"At this time, we do not know what will happen to Patriot's common stock as a
result of the Chapter 11 reorganization. Typically, the common stock of a
company in Chapter 11 is cancelled upon its emergence from the
reorganization process and stockholders usually receive no value for any
common stock they hold at that time."


Although the above passages are grim, their lack of 100% conclusiveness as to how the
courts will approach shareholder rights unfortunately offers a misguided glimmer of hope
to equity shareholders.


If the previous two points weren't convincing enough that the courts are not even going to
consider the ownership interests of common shareholders, clues 3 and 4 are the big
hitters.


Clue 3- The Trustee Speaks Out

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1657822-equity-ownership-in-patriot-coal-shares-threatened-by-bankruptcy-proceedings 3/9


September 17, 2012:


"The U.S. trustee objected Friday to Patriot Coal Corp. shareholders' request
for an official committee, saying they failed to show that their interests are
not being adequately represented or that it's even likely they'll get a
meaningful recovery.


U.S. Trustee Tracy Hope Davis objected to the motion by Patriot shareholders
CompassPoint Partners LP, Frank Williams and Eric Wagoner for the court to
order her to appoint an official committee of equity holders, saying there is
nothing to suggest that her initial refusal Aug. 24 to appoint one…"


Clue 4- Court Slams the Hammer


More recently, on May 13, 2013:


"The bankruptcy court overseeing the Chapter 11 proceedings of Patriot Coal
ruled that it would not require the appointment of an equity committee in the
case, saying in a May 10 order, "there appears to be no substantial
likelihood that equity will receive a meaningful distribution in these cases to
justify appointment of a committee."


In light of clues 3 and 4, we conclude that this is game, set, and match. But the financial
mess Patriot is in solidifies our conclusion.


Financial Mess


Equity investors need to realize that:


"Under the priority rankings established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless
creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities
must be satisfied in full before stockholders are entitled to receive any
distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization."


The above passage was taken directly from one of PCXCQ's SEC filings. So what is the
price tag of some of these liabilities?


To summarize, as it currently stands and as Mr. Eassa pointed out, Patriot needs to
address total creditor liabilities of about $1.8 billion that are not subject to compromise. As
we will explain later, this has to occur by October 31, 2013.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1657822-equity-ownership-in-patriot-coal-shares-threatened-by-bankruptcy-proceedings 4/9


Mr. Eassa shows that as of the most recent 10-Q filed on August 9, 2013, Patriot can
utilize liquid assets (current assets) of $474 million against the $1.8 billion non-negotiable
liabilities.


In actuality, as per its updated financial statements disclosed in an 8-K filed on August 21,
2013, PCXCQ:


Current assets have shrunk to $400 million.
Cash on hand is has been reduced by $50 million to $145 million.
Is losing nearly $20 million per month ($52 million quarterly loss, excluding
reorganization items, divided by three months).


So, Patriot's financial standing is quickly getting worse, especially considering that the
company sported a $206 million cash balance at the end of May 2013.


In order to "save" Patriot, it appears that equity investors would essentially have to find
some way to bring $1.4 billion ($1.8 billion debt minus $400 million in current assets) to
the table to settle prior debts. This, of course, also assumes that the current asset balance
will not decline any further.


Furthermore, they would need to convince special situation investors to overlook the fact
that the Debtor-in-Possession ("DIP") vehicle set up to fund Patriot during the Chapter 11
reorganization process was recently on the verge of default (terms have now been
amended):


"Patriot Coal notified lenders in late July that the company's operating earnings
would likely fall short of third quarter targets required in the DIP credit
agreement."


To make matters worse, the new DIP agreement requires Patriot Coal to obtain committed
bankruptcy-exit-financing by October 31, 2013.


More on the DIP


If we take a close look at how severe the condition Patriot Coal is facing in the DIP
situation alone, we would know that the value of those equity shares of Patriot Coal is
about to diminish.


According to Patriot Coal's second quarter 2013 SEC filing, the letters of credit from the
First Out Facility and the Second Out Facility (both of them are part of DIP plan with super
priority for creditors) totaled $58.2 million and $279.4 million, respectively. Combining the

knowledge that the company needs to obtain committed bankruptcy-exit-financing by
October 31, 2013 along with its troublesome cash generation capability (losing money
rather than generating more cash), it is not hard to imagine that Patriot would need to
seek an extension for the repayment of DIP obligations. Given the worsening financial
condition of the company, we believe that the likelihood of additional flexibility from
creditors of the DIP plan has been substantially reduced. If default occurs, according to
the DIP agreement, the company would have to liquidate its assets to repay the DIP
principle and accrued interests incurred … in other words, going into the liquidation
process (Chapter 7).


Conclusion:


Barring a miracle, it is almost assured that if you own or buy PCXCQ today it will be
worthless within two months or sooner once the irrational investor is convinced that the
bullish thesis is flawed. When we wrote about KVPHQ there was a chance that its equity
interests could have been preserved due to improving business conditions and a chance
that a legislative decision would give K-V a near monopolistic position. We postulated that
this scenario would attract investment into the company in order to settle past creditors'
obligations. Unfortunately, it appears that Congress will not come through on time. In the
case of Patriot, betting on the equity is like throwing your money into a wood chipper. The
bet is not a calculated one at all.

own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with
any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

LATE BREAKING DEVELOPMENTS COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING 
This short-sponsored report certainly does make things sound dire. But most of what is referred to leaves out late-
breaking news.  
1. company-friendly financial working agreement contracts were settled with the workers.

2. and far more importantly is the fact that the Appeals Court has just ruled that Peabody has to take care of the
retirement benefits for the 1,000s of workers that worked for them. That takes a MASSIVE financial debt/loss load off
of Patriots back.. and books.  
These 2 NEW factors make Patriot look far move viable as a company than just 2 weeks ago.  
3. And there is the overhanging fact that PCX hqtrs (presidents to lawyers to clerks) will be personally financially liable
in upcoming lawsuits.. IF THEY DO IN FACT CANCEL OUR STOCK.  
No sane person would want to act in contradiction to their guarantees.  
5/29/12 - "We will enhance value for our shareholders." 
8/21/13 - "Patriot remains committed to a fair outcome for our stakeholders." 
Disclosure: I am long PCX (pre and post BK)

A fair outcome for stakeholders would be for those with higher priority claims (retirees, bondholders, trade
creditors, employees) to get partial payment and for the shareholders to get nothing. That quote hardly helps
your argument.

The GeoTeam, Marketplace Contributor
Author’s reply »  Sam, key phrase is company friendly, not shareholder friendly. Furthermore, the court also
ruled that workers will get 35% of the reorg company!!!!! Your logic of the threat of lawsuits against the
company is just ridiculous and implies that every chapter 11 case will not result in the cancellation of stock.
Do you even know how the process works?

You couldn't be further from the truth. I know you're a shorter of this stock and want it to go down, so that's just poor
manipulation of this stock. Now you're just messing with people's lives by saying something that is not true. Did you
not read the article quote by the CEO last week stating that they are going to be fair to all "stakeholders"?
Stakeholders includes share holders. If you look up the Wiki page and Business site for the definition of
"stakeholders", you will see that they all mention it means "share holders". Lets also not forget the former CEO
statement over a year ago where he promised to protect share holder value.

Author’s reply »  AAMRQ is a much different scenario. You had a merger in this story. Seriously, the DIP is even close
to default. Just tell me where the billion dollars is coming from?


Why don't you reference the majority of Chapter 11 cases that do nothing for the equity?

Your line of reasoning seems plausible but what about the 4,100 employees? If they liquidate all of PCXCQ's assets
to repay DIP wouldn't that toss 'em all out of a job?


27 Aug 2013, 03:22 PM


The GeoTeam, Marketplace Contributor
Author’s reply »  JFF, It appears that employees only get saved if there is a reorg (they get 35% of new
company). But at least the former parent company (Peabody)is responsible for the pension. I do not know
what would happen in the event of a liquidation. But I can't imagine that the common shareholders would get
anything.


27 Aug 2013, 11:43 PM


Jffcpr29
The GeoTm Thanks I can see a win win for the employees, either they get 35% of the new reorg-company or
if liquidation and repayment of DIP occurs I would think a buyer of it's assets would keep the operations and
employees in place

Author’s reply »  Sanjay, We never said assets were not real. If they were not real there would be no reorg!!!
FYI, we write far more bullish articles than bearish (if you don't include the pump and dump penny stocks
scams). I am curious, what is your thesis on how the equity holders will survive this ordeal. You do realize that
35% of the reorganized company is going to employees? So that leaves 65%. Why would the bond holders
have any incentive to "Really" do anything for current equity holders?


What in these quotes would make any rationale investor think the equity will be saved?


1. If default occurs, according to the DIP agreement, the company would have to liquidate its assets to repay
the DIP principle and accrued interests incurred.


2. there appears to be no substantial likelihood that equity will receive a meaningful distribution in these cases
to justify appointment of a committee."

Per FAQ on Patriot's website:


http://bit.ly/16Ttt5J


"What will happen to the Patriot common stock that I own? Will I receive any compensation if the  
stock is cancelled? 
• Per the Plan of Reorganization we filed with the Bankruptcy Court on September 6, 2013,  
holders of “Interests in Patriot Coal” (equity securities) will not receive any distributions and  
such interests will be cancelled and extinguished.  
• The Plan of Reorganization must be voted on by certain of Patriot’s creditors and is subject to  
confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court before it is effective."


So it's confirmed that stock will be worth zero by the end of the year.....Can't wait to buy more Patriot Coal stock when
they emerge from Chp 11, lol!

just in time for Halloween, huh? Pretty scary, I must say.


One question ....Patriot has announced that they have, indeed, received bankruptcy-exit financing (from Knight ...
which is beyond humorous, I know ....)


There is also a rumor floating about that another existing mine has been folded in to the package, perhaps one of the
five which Consol recently divested? Any evidence of this?


We live in a time where there is an awful lot of false information about coal being disseminated by politicians,
government agencies, and the main media ... trying to hide the fact that it is still the most abundant and cheapest form

Nothing much more to say.

Americans and then declared BK.

But this is still kind of "confusing":

How does anybody know that the creditors will

I sure would NOT vote to let hqtrs steal 98% of my money. 
Nope!
