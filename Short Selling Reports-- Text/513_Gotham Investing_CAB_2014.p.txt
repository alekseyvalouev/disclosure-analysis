Cabela's Cookie Jar Is Empty
Aug. 28, 2014 10:48 AM ET7 comments
by: Gotham Investing


Summary


80% of Cabela's earnings "beats" since 2009 result from cookie jar shenanigans.


Over half of Cabela's earnings growth has come from declining loan loss reserves.


Cabela's cookie jar is not just out... it is in deficit.


Expect 3q14 earnings miss and disappointing results for the foreseeable future.


Price target: $26.29 (~58% downside).


Business Overview


Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) is a specialty retailer of hunting, fishing, camping, and related
outdoor merchandise that was founded in 1961. The company began as just a catalog
business and then started opening retail stores in 1987. The company operates through
three segments: Retail, Direct, and Financial Services. The Retail segment operates 59
stores across North America as of June 30, 2014, the Direct segment comprises the
catalog and ecommerce business, and the Financial Services segment operates the
"World's Foremost Bank" and issues Visa-branded credit cards. In addition, the "Corporate
Overhead and Other" segment is largely shared services of Direct and Retail.


To provide some context, segment revenues and operating income, as presented by the
company, for the last five years is set forth below.

Based on the data above, one might think the Financial Services segment is relatively
unimportant. However, upon closer inspection, the Financial Services segment takes on
greater importance.


CAB went public in June 2004 at $20 and earned $1.03 per share that year. The company
then struggled to grow earnings for the next five years despite rapidly growing retail sales:


*Normalized EPS; Data from CAB 10-K filings


Then, CAB's retail sales growth slowed (fewer openings mainly), and earnings
accelerated.


*Normalized EPS; Data from CAB 10-K filings


Based on the above tables, it is clear that CAB's earnings grew more quickly when the
Company's retail and overall sales were growing slowly (2009-2013) than when the
Company's retail and overall sales were growing rapidly (2004-2009). Therefore, the key
to CAB's EPS growth does not appear to be retail or even overall sales growth...so what's
really going on here?


Earnings Management 101


Companies have discretion in their accounting assumptions, but sometimes management
gets hooked on the drug that is earnings growth and/or beating estimates. I think CAB
management got hooked.


The table below sets forth CAB's adjusted earnings relative to sell-side estimates and
shows that after a change in "accounting principle" at the beginning of 2010 (discussed in
detail below), CAB did not "miss" earnings for 14 straight quarters. In fact, they beat

estimates by an average of $0.06 per share (12%) from 1q10-2q13.


Data Source: Capital IQ


This is clearly an impressive track record, particularly because CAB did not provide
specific quarterly guidance, so they couldn't "sandbag" the number.


There are three main theories that could explain CAB's newfound ability to consistently
beat estimates:


1. Retail store performance and new store openings (management's explanation)
2. Bumper sales of guns and ammunition (investors' main focus)
3. Cookie jar accounting with the provision/allowance (my explanation)


I will focus on #3 and answer any questions or comments others might have on #1 and #2
in the comments section, but first we need to go back in time a few years.


The Cookie Jar is Created


Effective January 3, 2010, CAB began consolidating when FASB updated ASC Topic 860,
Transfers and Servicing, which eliminated the qualifying special purpose entity ("QSPE")
concept. FASB also updated ASC 810, Consolidations, which requires the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE") to consolidate it.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 4/18


In brief, CAB had to bring back onto its own balance sheet credit card loans it had "sold"
to a bankruptcy-remote entity it controlled along with that entity's debt. As a result - and
this is the REAL kicker - CAB had to begin reserving for loan losses at the "World's
Foremost Bank" like other banks.


Prior to this "change in accounting principles," CAB's allowance for loan losses was only
for un-securitized credit card receivables. In contrast, the securitized receivables placed
into QSPEs (yes, of Enron notoriety) ignored the total assets and total liabilities of the
QSPE. Instead, CAB merely recognized a "retained interest" on a mark-to-model basis.


Apparently, CAB's model for marking was too aggressive because CAB took a $114.6
million pre-tax charge ($92.8 million after-tax) as a result of the accounting change in
1q10. Notably, this charge did not go through the income statement (it was charged
directly to equity):


Source: 1q10 CAB Form 10-Q


So CAB wrote-off these previously recognized profits and, in the process, CAB
management created a cookie jar that would enable them to grow earnings and beat
expectations with the stroke of a pen.


CAB's Cookie Jar


The table below highlights why I think theory #3 (Cookie Jar) explains CAB's ability to beat
expectations. Similar to the table of earnings surprises above, I include the estimated and
actual adjusted EPS. However, this time I also note the benefit from drawing down the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 5/18


allowance (as a percentage of CC loans outstanding) and estimate its contribution to
earnings (and earnings "beats").


Since the declining allowance has driven approximately over 100% of CAB's cumulative
EPS beats since 1q10, I believe it's clear that the cookie jar loan reserves are what drove
CAB's impressive 2010-2q14 performance relative to expectations.


In the table below, I calculate the EPS benefit and contribution to growth resulting from the
decrease in the allowance as a percentage of CC loans receivable relative to the 2009
assumption (4.47%). In other words, it quantifies the benefit CAB's EPS and EPS growth
received from using less conservative (increasingly aggressive) accounting assumptions
with respect to credit losses.


While other factors contributed to earnings growth, the cookie jar appears to have been
the largest. In fact, I estimate that CAB's reduction in the percent reserved has driven over
half (13.2% / 24.1%) of the company's earnings growth since 2009.

Note: $1.15 is different from the $1.19 table above because the prior table incorporates
the first and second quarters of 2014.


The remainder of the company's earnings growth can be attributed to (1) a depressed
starting point and subsequent improvement in the retail environment, (2) all-time high
guns and ammo sales, particularly in late 2012 and the three quarters of 2013, and, more
recently, (3) aggressive cost cuts to manage expenses.


Clearly, the environment for consumer demand has improved since 2009, but that is a rear
view mirror issue and we currently appear to be closer to a cyclical peak than cyclical
trough. Additionally, guns and ammunition sales continue to tail off, but present more of a
risk to CAB than opportunity since demand for these products remains elevated. Finally,
we will let other investors draw their own conclusions about what the implications of a
growing retail operation touting cost cutting opportunities such as re-negotiating contracts
for doorknobs.


2q14 Earnings Call:


Answer - Tommy Millner: Absolutely. And specifically, as Ralph and our
construction teams are looking at how to lower store cost, we're not talking about
gutting customer experience. We're talking about construction techniques and that
kind of stuff, not changing in-store experience, which is sacred ground here.


Answer - Ralph Castner: Yes. What we should do sometime, Matt, is walk through
a store, and I can kind of give you our impression about how we think about it, and
where we see opportunity. And I can give you examples, it would be silly, but it's
literally $50,000's and $100,000 at a time, going with national contracts in some of
our vendors.


One of the things we looked at is -- I know this sounds silly, but the hardware we use
in all the parts of the store that the customer doesn't see -- door knobs, hinges,
those kinds of things -- we are just taking every aspect of the design and seeing
what we can do better. And by the way, that philosophy is, what has happened all
across the Company, is how can we not impact the customer experience but do
things better?

The Cookie Jar Deficit

Up until now, I've discussed what has happened. Now let's talk about where CAB is today
because sources of growth and upside surprises can quickly become the cause of a
decline in earnings or result in disappointing earnings. In CAB's case, the reliance on a
cookie jar to generate earnings leads to the critical question "Are there any cookies left
OR is it actually in deficit?"


In preview, it isn't pretty - the jar is empty at best and more likely in deficit.


As discussed above, the largest driver of earnings growth and upside surprises has been
the decline in the loan loss allowance - from $114.6 million as of 4q09 to $47.4 million in
2q14 (a 59% decline). While the allowance fell 59%, credit card receivables rose from
$2.56 billion (4q09 gross) to $3.95 billion, or 54%! In other words, the allowance as a
percentage of managed receivables fell from 4.47% to 1.20%.


Below is CAB's disclosure of what the allowance represents (emphasis added):


Allowance for Loan Losses on Credit Cards


The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable losses
inherent in the credit card loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established
through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is evaluated by management
for adequacy. Loans on a payment plan or non-accrual are segmented from the rest
of the credit card loan portfolio into a restructured credit card loan segment before
establishing an allowance for loan losses as these loans have a higher probability of
loss. Management estimates losses inherent in the credit card loans segment and
restructured credit card loans segment based on a model which tracks historical loss
experience on delinquent accounts, bankruptcies, death, and charge-offs, net of
estimated recoveries. The Financial Services segment uses a migration analysis and
historical bankruptcy and death rates to estimate the likelihood that a credit card
loan in the credit card loans segment will progress through the various stages of
delinquency and to charge-off. This analysis estimates the gross amount of
principal that will be charged off over the next 12 months, net of recoveries.
The Financial Services segment uses historical charge-off rates to estimate the
charge-offs over the life of the restructured credit card loan, net of recoveries. This
estimate is used to derive an estimated allowance for loan losses.


Source: CAB 2013 Form 10-K, page 62


So charge-offs, net of recoveries are expected to be 1.20%, as set forth in the table below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 8/18


I have drawn a line in between 1q12 and 2q12 in the table above because of comments
by CAB's CFO, Ralph Castner, indicate an allowance of approximately 2.25% is "normal"
and "to really expect anything is sustainable below 2%...is just unlikely."


2012 Investor Day (March 22, 2012):


Ralph Castner: A lot of guys believed us and saw some of the differences and
educated themselves through this, but we've clearly seen that fall to sort of historical
levels, and I'll tell you, before the run up we saw in '08, '09 with the great recession,
this business pretty much like clockwork had charge-offs between 2% and
2.5% and we're well within that range. To really expect anything is sustainable
below 2% is just unlikely. I fully expect charge-offs will be -- maybe even tick a little
above 2.5%, but somewhere in that 2.5% range is a sustainable ongoing level for
charge-offs.


1q12 Earnings Call:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 9/18


Question - Aaron Goldstein: Lastly on the bank side on the charge-off provisions
you talked about historical rates been in the 2% to 2.5%. When you are looking at
your provisions, is that what it would currently -- if you currently unwound at the
current rate, that is what the charge-offs you would need or is there a buffer in there
for kind of what the average historical rate that you think it going to be?


Ralph Castner: We'll, I'm not sure I understand your question. When we calculate
the allowance, we use the existing delinquencies and that's in correlation to a
charge-off level that we expect to see. So as we go forward, what is going to happen
with the allowance, we've ‒ over the last two or three years, we have had the benefit
of dramatically lower charge-offs and delinquencies. Sometime soon that is going
to start to get mitigated because of growth in the portfolio. So we are going to
need a bigger allowance just because the portfolio is growing. And at least I
feel like -- as I sit here today, I feel like we are near -- pretty close to that
starting to cross. In other words, the growth of the portfolio is going to require
a bigger and bigger allowance, which will offset any benefit we get from
continued improvements in the macro credit environment.


...


Ralph Castner: I said in my comments we don't expect a significant reduction -- I
want to make sure we are talking about the same thing, in the balance sheet
allowance. So yes, I would expect charge-offs and the provision to be more
closely aligned in the last three quarters of the year.


2013 Investor Day (March 13, 2013):


Ralph Castner: As you go back and look at the photo sign, this is charge-offs, I
don't want to say from the beginning of time, but I'll say we hardly had enough
accounts back in 2000 to make it relevant for today's portfolio. I had somebody
graph our charge-offs the last 13 years, and the takeaway over long periods of
time is we've seen basically two spikes and chart drops. In 2000, '01 levels,
charge-offs got up just above 3%. And obviously, in the '08, '09 timeframe,
they got up around 5%. Really excluding those, charge-offs have always been
between 2% and 3%.

Source: Capital IQ


To recap:


1. Allowance for loan losses = expected charge-offs over the next 12 months
2. CAB's CFO expects charge-offs to be 2.0% to 2.5% and suggests that any period


where charge-offs drop below 2.0% is unsustainable.
3. In spite of 1) and 2) above, the allowance is currently 1.20%...


This points to a significant problem with the allowance, as indicated by the fact that CAB's
net charge-offs over any 12-month period have never been below ~1.65%, let alone 1.2%!


The speed with which CAB changed their commentary around the allowance this spring is
demonstrative.


March 2014 Analyst Day, continued (March 26, 2014) (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 11/18


Ralph Castner: I know that we don't expect a meaningful change in the actual
charge-off rates that we're charging on our cards -- oh I'm sorry, our charge-off rate
from bad debts in -- between 2013 and 2014. Now I know this has gotten a lot of
attention, but there is a headwind as it relates to reserve releases between '13 and
'14.


We had reserve releases of $12 million in 2013 (ed: absolute -- larger benefit as a %
of CC loans), we've got receivable - we've got an allowance for loan losses of, I
believe, about $60 million, that we will probably need to increase that reserve
in 2014, not because it's under reserved at absolute levels, but we'll need to
increase that commensurate with portfolio growth.


So if we've got a $60 million allowance and the portfolio is going to grow 12%
to 14%, you can estimate there's some number between $5 million and $10
million. So we'll probably need to increase that reserve in 2014 just through
the portfolio growth.


1q14 Earnings Call (April 24, 2014):


Ralph Castner: As I am thinking about the business today and particularly the
allowance for loan losses, I still think for the full year we are going to have to
increase that. Probably not to the extent of the $7 million that we shared with you at
our Analyst Day that we have to, but I would still expect increases in the allowance
as we move through the back half of the year.


Note: In 2q14, the allowance declined $3.7 million (again) sequentially.


Phases of CAB's Cookie Jar:


I think about CAB's Modern Era (i.e.: after the accounting change) in three phases.
5/20/2018 Cabela's Cookie Jar Is Empty - Cabela's Incorporated (NYSE:CAB) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 12/18


Phase 1 (2010 - 1q12): "Free" Allowance and Improving Charge-Offs


Since CAB took a "one-time" charge to retained earnings for the change in accounting
principles, the Company never had to bear those expenses in the income statement. As
such, the relatively full allowance of 4.47% was "free" and reflected a weak consumer
credit environment.


CAB's charge-offs declined from this fortuitous starting point, creating a two-fold benefit.
First, lower charge-offs meant, for a given customer or set of customers, CAB could
reserve less for future losses on new loans. Second, the lower charge-offs meant that they
could reduce loan loss reserves (allowance) as a reduction in the provision for loan losses
on existing loans outstanding.


Phase 2 (2q12 - Present): Going for Broke


Since the quarter ending March 31, 2012, the allowance has fallen from 2.26% to 1.20%.
At the same time, trailing twelve month charge-offs have fallen from 2.15% to 1.78% (37
basis points) - a level the CFO has described as unsustainable (see above).


Had CAB not drawn down the allowance to this degree, the Company would have missed
earnings and/or missed substantially worse for the last five quarters in a row -- a far cry
from the 11.6% average earnings "beat" investors came to expect from 2010-1H13.


Phase 3a (3q14): The Day of Reckoning



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/8/21/29115375-14086272418282971-Dr--Thomas-Wayne_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 13/18


CAB shareholders seem to think they own a retail growth company, but they are about to
get a rude awakening because, in reality, they own an under-reserved bank wearing
retailer clothing.


I believe CAB's investors will realize this unfortunate situation very soon. In particular, I
expect CAB to report surprisingly weak results in 3q14 since (1) the allowance needs to
start ratcheting up, and (2) 3q13 benefited from an egregiously low provision.


Another way to look at this:


Net Provision = Gross Provision +/- Adjustment for Prior Under-Reserving (Over-
Reserving)


Net Provision % = Net Provision / Average Managed CC Loans


The net provision reached the second lowest level ever in 3q13 (0.95% annualized)
despite having already released substantially all of the bank's "excess" reserves for loan
losses (>2.25% of CC loans outstanding) by the middle of 2012.


Additionally, delinquencies and charge-offs have been essentially flat (TTM NCO % has
remained between 1.78% and 1.83% for the last seven quarters), so CAB will have a hard
time arguing that reserves should be falling... or have fallen a year ago for that matter.


Assuming a $3 million sequential increase in the allowance (as alluded to by
management) and constant NCOs sequentially (down slightly Y/Y), CAB's provision will
need to be approximately $19 million, or $10.6 million higher than a year ago. Since the
provision is an item netted against gross revenues of the Financial Services segment, this
will reduce segment revenues by approximately $10.6 million, all else equal. What's
worse, this contra-revenue is pure margin. In other words, there is no cost reduction
associated with this revenue decline.


The approximate EPS impact is: ~$0.10 = $10.6 million * (1-35% tax rate) / 71.7 million
shares


A headwind of $0.10 may not sound like much, but it equates to more than 10% of
estimated EPS and creates a greater than 10% headwind to EPS growth in the quarter.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 14/18


CAB has not grown earnings in 3q or 4q by more than 25% since 3q11 when the baseline
was much smaller ($0.31), thus causing more volatility. Even when guns and ammo were
white hot in 4q12, CAB only grew earnings by 18% - and that was with the added benefit
of the provision falling!


Phase 3b (4q14 & Beyond): The Long Slog Ahead


I believe 3q14 will be just the beginning of disappointing results for CAB's investors. As
noted above, I estimate CAB received an EPS benefit of $0.23-$0.32 in 2010-2013.
Starting with 3q14 and continuing forward, CAB will lose approximately 10% of EPS (using
TTM EPS of $2.98 as a denominator) right off the bat since they can no longer release
loan loss reserves (which count as a negative provision - a boost to revenue at 100%
margin). So that resets the baseline for EPS to ~$2.70 per share.


Once again, it gets worse. Not only will CAB lose ~$0.30 of EPS, it will face a constant
headwind as it needs to rebuild the allowance to at least the current (cyclically low) level of
charge-offs (~1.8%) and more like the historical average discussed by the CFO (~2.25%).


Valuation & Scenarios


In the tables below, I estimate the EPS impact of various scenarios for the CC loan
portfolio.


There are two important drivers of CAB's EPS impact. First, I show the impact to earnings
from the cookie jar being depleted. In other words, this table answers the question, "What
will happen to CAB's earnings if they provision at the same rate of NCOs under different
NCO scenarios?"


For example, Scenario 1 assumes NCOs remain at the all-time low levels of 1.80%. Since
last year CAB only provisioned 1.12% (raiding the cookie jar created the 68 basis point
difference), CAB would have to either decrease the allowance again or increase the
provision. Increasing the provision as a % of CC loans would decrease EPS by $0.25
($27.8m lower pre-tax profits). In Scenario 3, I assume NCOs revert to the level suggested
by CAB's CFO (see above), thus requiring the provision to increase 113 basis points
(2.25% - 1.12%). A 113 basis point increase in the provision would cause EPS to decline
by $0.42, all else equal.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457385-cabelas-cookie-jar-is-empty 15/18


Next, I show the impact to EPS from increasing the allowance to match the NCO (since
allowance represents expected losses over the next twelve months). However, I assume
that the impact is spread over six quarters to reflect the discretion management has with
respect to how quickly they must recognize credit losses.


For example, in Scenario 1 below, I assume that CAB can maintain their allowance at
1.20% despite the 1.80% NCO rate. However, since the NCO percentage reflects realized
credit losses on an annualized basis and the allowance represents estimated credit losses
for the next twelve months, over time the allowance percentage needs to rise to match the
NCO percentage (it should exceed it due to growth, but I'll give them the benefit of the
doubt).


Rebuilding reserves (through additional provisions) can be spread out over more than 12
months (in the tables below I assume they spread out the additional provisions over 18
months), but if CAB waits too long, they risk the disastrous combination of being
significantly under-reserved when credit deteriorates (the way a short hits a grand slam
here).


Finally, I take the combined impact of these adjustments and CAB's run-rate EPS to
estimate EPS and price targets under different NCO assumptions.


The P/E multiples used below are lower than CAB's recent trading multiple (~16.3x) to
reflect the spurious nature of CAB's EPS (and EPS growth) in recent years. However, my
assumptions are within its historical range and are well above the multiple at which it
traded in 2008 and 2009.

Once investors realize CAB's earnings are dominated by the company's under-reserved
bank instead of its retail operations, and that earnings are likely to decline in future years
as a result of increasing provisions, I believe the market will assign a meaningfully lower
multiple to CAB's EPS.


Price Target: $26.29 (58% downside).

This has definitely run too far too fast. I'm sure some of that is due to Sandy Hook, etc and another part is due to the
market going up. Does your valuation include their property? If so, where do you value that? 10.5-11x what could be

First, the author's implication is that CAB's management is dishonest is completely false. I believe the officers and
board are among the most honorable people in business today. Secondly, he fails utterly to understand CAB's
business, industry and customer. Almost all issues around their business performance surround the artificial demand
for guns and ammo created by the Sandy Hook tragedy. They are, in fact, coming down from a hugely anomalous
cyclical peak, as are virtually all other outdoor retailers like Dick's, Big 5, Sportsmen's Whse and manufacturers such
as Ruger, Smith & Wesson, Olin, etc. They are all singing the same tune.


With regard to the bank, CAB's credit card delinquencies and charge-offs are among the lowest in the industry. Why?
Because these customers are among Cabela's best, they earn points to buy product that their wives might not allow
them to buy or would object to if the price came out of the family budget. Laugh if you'd like, but that's the truth and,
as a result, CAB get's paid before other credit cards.


The fate and fortune of both the bank and CAB's merchandise business are INEXTRICABLY ENTWINED. Neither
would grow the way the have absent this relationship. Most newer or uninformed CAB investors simply do not
understand the relationship and want to try separate the two and it just doesn't work unless you are prepared to
accept dramatic under-performance relative to history. As to the so-called shenanigans and "cookie jar" assertions,
there have been so many regulatory changes and additions impacting the banking industry, CAB and other banks are
only reacting to those changes. I absolutely do not believe CAB is doing anything "spurious" as the author charges
who, (by virtue of being short the stock), has everything to gain by a "report" that could impact stock price.


Finally, the current CEO, Tommy Millner, came on board about 5 years after the CAB went public. Could it be that his
entrance was a result of the period of under-performance and that their track record since that time is a direct result of
the new CEO and his leadership?

Author’s reply »  MXC - I think Tommy & crew would like you to believe that they are so smart as to have
"figured out" the retail business, but I believe the numbers set forth in my article make it clear that reality is
quite different -- the accounting change was the main driver. Secondarily, I think Tommy was in the right place
at the right time (guns/ammo binge), but that won't last forever -- and hangovers hurt...just ask SWHC & RGR
shareholders!

MXC is definitely overly protective of Cabelas. Check out his other comment on another thread on Cabelas. Very
protective. The simple fact of the matter is that the true operating results of the retail side of Cabela's have been
masked for many years thru the use of nice and very creative accounting for the bank. I'm not saying it is improper, I
am just saying it is creative. Just disclose the total fee that is allocated between the bank entity and the retail entity.

That is all I ask. Let the investor decide on whether they want to buy the stock or not after that. Could it be that they
are not disclosing this fee because they are afraid to do that because it will show how poorly the retail side is
performing?

Thank you for the in-depth analysis and the idea.


I'd like to ask two questions:


1) coming from banking background, I would focus on total provisioning ratio (loan loss provision/ gross loan book)
rather then what period risk charge "should be". With the total provisioning ratio at 1.33% as of end last year, how
does this compare to competitors? Because by itself it does not stand out as a highly under provisioned loan book.


2) if EPS miss comes from the banking side of the Company's business (as apposed to the Core), do you think it may
be assigned less importance by the Street?


Thank you

Author’s reply »  1) Reserves / TTM Net charge-offs (NCOs) at CAB are running ~0.8x. Reserves are for expected
losses in the next twelve months, and TTM NCO should be a generous comparator in light of a growing portfolio. This
indicates they are inadequate.


CAB's higher fico scores result in lower charge-offs, so i think the right comparison is a given company's reserves / a
given company's TTM NCO.


In contrast, the credit card portfolios for AXP, BAC, DFS, and GE are at 1.53x, 1.35x, 1.13x, and 1.12x respectively,
implying an average of 1.285x. If anything, CAB should have a HIGHER ratio due to its more rapid portfolio growth.


2) I don't think a miss from banking gets less importance. In fact, since I think it will blind-side investors with losses
from a segment they don't understand well, they are likely to (a) fear it and (b) need to take #s down more than if it
was caused by an issue in retail that they understood.


Also on that point, I should make clear that I don't view any 3q14 miss caused by the bank as "one-time". Rather, I
believe it's the start of a new trend of rising provisions and reduced/falling fin svcs segment margins because they (a)
over-allocated mktg fees to direct/retail and (b) bled the allowance down way too far...rebuilding it will be a painful,
multi-quarter (year? depends on their pain tolerance...) process.
