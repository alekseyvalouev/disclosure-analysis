Digital Ally: Why This Movie Will End Badly

Summary


National interest is in police body cameras, not DGLY’s old technology.


TASR owns the market; DGLY revenue from old technology will continue to erode.


TASR's product is superior to DGLY’s body cam.


Police wearable video segment is highly competitive; DGLY is already too far behind.


DGLY stock at about $19.50 is not sustainable.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Digital Ally (DGLY) stock has soared over 386 percent amid calls for cops to wear body
cameras following the Ferguson, Mo. police officer shooting of an unarmed teenager.
DGLY took advantage of an unbelievable run in the stock for a small raise, a heady but
ridiculous action in light of how short DGLY falls below others in the industry.


We've seen this movie before and we know there is absolutely no justification for the
stock's crazy run from about $3.80 in one astonishing month to today's nearly $20.


Here are TheStreetSweeper's top reasons we believe this DGLY movie will end badly:


1. National interest is in police body cameras, not DGLY's technology. The old dash
cameras - DGLY's key product - are not even part of the national conversation.


"The recent emergence of body-worn cameras has already had an impact on policing, and
this impact will only increase as more agencies adopt this technology,'' said Chuck Wexler,
executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, author of a recent report on
the use of police body cameras.


Yet, the in-car video recording system constitutes 90 percent of DGLY's already falling
revenue and rising operating losses of about $1 million.


2. Old technology = falling revenue.

DGLY's in-car video revenue will likely continue to erode due to superior, cheaper body
cameras offered by well-known vendors such as stun-gun maker Taser International
(TASR), a profitable company up 43 percent since Ferguson to $17 plus change.


CNBC's Jim Cramer said police wearable video will likely become the new normal and that
market is owned by Taser.


Wearable cameras provide superior video footage that provides up-close and point-of-
view, non-tamper recording compared with in-car video.


At $399 Taser's Axon is 10 times cheaper than DGLY's $4,000 dash camera.


Indeed, DGLY's old technology is clearly already feeling the pressure. Describing the
company's decline in gross profit, its last quarterly filing said:


"However, we are experiencing increased price competition and pressure from certain of
our competitors that has led to pricing discounts on larger contract opportunities. We
expect that this pricing pressure will continue as our competitors attempt to regain market
share and revive sales and that it will have some negative impact on our efforts to improve
gross margins during 2014."


3. Police wearable video is highly competitive, so we believe, DGLY is already too far
behind.


The money-losing DGLY doesn't even make the rankings in a Google search for "police
body worn camera."


Here's a sampling of what investors will see:


Taser (TASR)
Martel digital
bodycameras.com
Vievu
policeone.com
wolfcomusa.com
Panin
BodyCam


4. Taser's product is superior to DGLY's body cam.


TASR battery life is 12 hours. DGLY battery life is 4.5 hours.

DGLY product is chest-level mount. TASR eye-level mount prevents view from being
blocked by officer's arm when shooting.
TASR is price leader, more attractive purchasing plans, profits from subscription
services.
TASR AXON Flex is $599, AXON Body is $399. Offers $50/month ongoing
maintenance, 3-year replacement and Evidence.com subscription. Yet DGLY FirstVue
price is $900.
DGLY intends to introduce a bullet camera that is not new, as evidenced by a simple
search for "helmet camera" or "glasses camera." Its weak brand, combined with a tiny
sales force will get the DGYLY product shot down by police tech suppliers such as
TASR.


5. DGLY pales in key cloud video management solutions compared to TASR. The
complexity involved is described by New York Police Commissioner William Bratton in the
Wall Street Journal:


"This is an extraordinarily complex initiative. It is not simply going down to your local
RadioShack, buying one of these things, and putting it on," Mr. Bratton said. "The storage
issue is phenomenal."


TASR's Evidence.com gives TASR the edge as it also profits from subscription services.
The feature offers third-party storage, security, powerful video search and scanning, all
elements important in court evidence. Yet DGLY requires local data storage, requiring
scarce police department IT personnel's management of voluminous video data.


6. DGLY stock at about $19.50 is not sustainable. As excitement wanes,
TheStreetSweeper believes the horrible fundamentals will set in on top of the other
negatives and investors will have to pull out the handkerchief as this movie winds to a
close.


Here are some financial highlights:


Continuing drop in earnings per share over two years. A 99 cent loss prior year turned
into a current $1.14 loss.
Net income collapsed by 1376 percent versus last year, or from minus $0.07 million
versus the current figure of minus $0.99 million.
Return on equity significantly down at -64 percent, well below the industry.
Net operating cash flow dropped to minus $0.6 million, nearly 500 percent.

Very poorly-written article. Surprised SA published it. I have no position in DGLY...yet. Getting long > $19 perhaps.
Half the float is short. Prime for a wee squeeze on the next NR.

Odd. My take on DGLY was the opposite. Their technology is advanced, they just do not know how to market it
aggressively. Fully coordinating camera system includes body, car, bullet cam, all communicating together. Automatic
turn on system and real time recording. It's clear the technology is expensive because it's far more advanced than the
competitors, and there are advantages to their systems that the competitors do not have. However, they're not
marketing it aggressively enough especially in the current boom market going on. Plus, while they've done a beautiful
job making the system the next step is selling the system. It's a tough go making a higher end better product while
you're selling to police departments with money constraints.


The article seems to attack the company's strengths, typical and off the mark. If I were to make the stretch to call it an
article rather than an attempt at manipulation on a low float stock.

Also, TASR exec just dumped 180k worth of stock. Today. Or was it 180,000 shares - yikes.  
Sooo, do we think TASR thinks this body camera space will ultimately be important to it's bottom line? Hmm, maybe
not. Same take as before, TASR is a much larger company that stands to benefit alot less even if it takes a strong

market share of the cameras. DGLY stands to benefit greatly if it can spark it's sales team into properly taking
advantage of this coming wave of buyers.

I also can not believe SA let's people publish trashing articles for their own gain or friends who are short God I hate
shorts and all the BS they make up every stock I own constantly goes through this crap these are great companies
but if SA publishes an article like this they are obviously bashing to make it go down


DGLY offers the whole deal package they have it together, TASR is making money on tasers

Nothing wrong with shorting a stock. It becomes a moral issue when you boldly lie to help it go down. Morality
and money seem to go together with great difficulty.  
But in the end it doesn't matter. In fact it helps those who are long. If you believe in the stock, shorts are only
helping you buy more shares cheaper.

I watched DGLY stock run up, and I think it likely has lower to fall. I am not taking a position either way, but it is
interesting to watch. I think that if GPRO gets into the wearable cameras for law enforcement they would become the
market leader quickly and crater the sales of both TASR and DGLY. I am not investing in any of the stocks mentioned,
however I am watching them, and that's just my 2 cents.

Wouldn't want to be holding TheStreetSweeper's shorts today. DGLY up ~30% on huge gov't order! I guess someone
out there likes old technology!

a) i see that the firstvu is now $795 per dgly's site 
b) firstvu has 720p capacity, Axon has max of 640x480 
c) battery...Axon: "More than 12 hours of battery life under normal operation." Normal operation is not defined on their
site. Firstvu: "up to 2.5 days in Instant-Record Standby, 4.5 hrs. continuous recording" 
d) Tasr mite have edge with video searchability and ability to upload to the cloud
