ZST Digital Networks: Deceptive Business, Bad Investment 
November 3, 2010 





Situation Overview 
 


ZST Digital Networks (OTCPK:ZSTN) came public in October 2009 and raised $25 million by offering 3.1m 
shares at $8 per share. The offering was led by Rodman & Renshaw and Westpark Capital, two ubiquitous 
underwriters in the market for bringing Chinese companies public in the U.S. through reverse takeovers 
(RTOs). 


There are plenty of recent examples of why investors should be highly skeptical of purchasing shares in 
these Chinese RTO companies. Many lack transparency, internal controls, exaggerate their financial 
performance and assets, have weak governance, and in some cases are outright frauds. Look no further 
than China-Biotics (OTCQB:CHBT), Orient Paper (ONP), Douyuan Printing (DYP), China New Borun (BORN), 
China Marine Food Group (OTCPK:CMFO), Fuqi Int’l (OTCPK:FUQI), and China Northeast Petroleum (NEP) as 
cautionary examples. 


Upon a close examination of ZSTN’s business, financial model, and governance we are highly skeptical that 
their business exists in the manner it is being portrayed to U.S. investors, and believe ZSTN is a business of 
dubious practices and investment merits. Our main concern is their depiction to U.S. investors of a business 
generating superior sales and earnings growth without any cash flow generation. Furthermore, their 
financial model appears to favor customers, suppliers, and business partners at the expense of 
shareholders. We also provide hard evidence through a comparison of their SAIC financials to their SEC 
filings that indicate gross misrepresentation of their financial condition. 





What Is ZST Digital’s Business? 


The company claims to derive revenues principally from sale of products related to cable TV program 
distribution systems which include digital cable TV network equipments and IPTV set-top boxes. The 
company also recently entered the GPS market and sells devices, and GPS installation and subscription 
services. At present, ZSTN’s main clients are broadcasting TV bureaus and cable network operators serving 
various cities and counties in the Henan Province. 





Red Flag #1: Unusual Financial Model Reporting Strong Sales and EPS Strength Without any Real Cash 
Flow Growth 


Focusing first on their income statement, ZSTN is reporting that its sales have grown from $28m in 2007 to 
over $100m in 2009. The company does not disclose units sold or average sales prices (ASPs) per unit. This 
lack of transparency makes it difficult to reconcile total sales, but by cross referencing various pieces of 
information from company filings, many inconsistencies and question marks appear. To illustrate, ZSTN 
reports that its main products are IPTV set top boxes (STB), which accounted for 56% of its total revenues in 
2008 amounting to $31m of IPTV product sales.
Furthermore, according to slide 8 on their recently filed September 2010 investor presentation (see here), 
ZSTN says the 2008 market for its IPTV product is 2 million households, and that it has 62.5% of the market. 
This implies company sales of approximately 1.25 million units. As previously discussed, ZSTN does not 
disclose its ASP, however, by checking various pricing sources in China we can estimate a range of $50 - 
$150 per STB. This allows us to imply a range of how many units they are actually selling. The discrepancy in 
unit sales is quite startling and illustrated below: 











Sales, general and administrative (SG&A) and R&D expenses also seem highly unusual for a technology 
company growing as fast as ZSTN claims. Selling expense is among the lowest we’ve seen for any growth 
company in our experience. ZSTN’s selling expense margin was a minuscule 0.01% (1 basis point) in 2007 
and has grown to 0.6% (60 basis points) in the LTM 6/30/10 period. In other words, ZSTN spent a mere 
$30,000 to generate $28m in revenues in 2007 and is now only spending $670,000 in selling expense for 
$105m of revenues. It begs the question; do ZSTN’s products just sell themselves? 


G&A expenses are also unusually low for a business of this size. We’ve heard the argument that wages and 
operating costs are low in China; however, how low is low? According to the proxy statement, the CEO of 
this $100m operation only makes $15,000/year. Likewise, R&D spending is typically the life blood for a 
technology-based company; yet, ZSTN reports that it spent nothing on R&D expense in 2008. 


To get a better sense of just how unusual ZSTN’s reported SG&A and R&D figures are, we have 
benchmarked them against a range of other Chinese publicly listed technology companies. To our 
amazement, ZSTN not only is reporting superior revenue growth in our sample set, but also the highest 
sales per employee at $500,000, all while having both the lowest SG&A and R&D margins.
Unusual Financials vs. Peers 


Not surprisingly, given the reported cost structure and sales growth, ZSTN is also reporting strong EPS 
growth of $0.49 in 2007 to $1.30 for the LTM 6/31/10 period. However, as we’ll explore next, the earnings 
quality, as measure by actual cash flow, is very low. By looking at the all-important cash flow statement, the 
true story of ZSTN is revealed. Over the LTM 6/31/10 period, the company’s cash from operations was -$4.1 
million. Factoring in capital expenditures, free cash flow was -$5.4 million. 


Turning our attention to the balance sheet reveals the mystery behind ZSTN’s lack of cash flow. For a 
company that claims to be capital and operating efficient, the balance sheet tells the opposite story. The 
current assets of the company are comprised mainly of cash, accounts receivables, and advances to 
suppliers.
On the supplier side, ZSTN reports 3 key suppliers accounting for over 30% of their purchases. While it’s 
hard to gauge the solvency/credibility of these suppliers, any mishap with one of these counterparties 
could cause significant problems for ZSTN in collecting the cash. ZSTN appears to freely advance them large 
amounts of cash, and pay their invoices quickly. ZSTN reported almost no accounts payable outstanding at 
the end of the quarter, yet approximately $7.4 million in advances to suppliers. In our experience, we’ve 
not seen any company manage working capital so inefficiently.  


Perhaps the greatest mystery of all in ZSTN’s balance sheet is the question of its inventory (or lack thereof). 
As of the last quarter, ZSTN carried only $0.50 million of inventory on hand, and has not carried more than 
$1.50 million of inventory in the last 12 months. Yet, they manage to report over $105 million of sales; this 
equates to an astronomical inventory turnover ratio of ~200x! The company says they subcontract all 
manufacturing on a turnkey basis, with suppliers delivering fully assembled and tested products based on 
their proprietary designs. This model they say allows them to have significantly reduced capital 
requirements. We still don't understand how they avoid taking the inventory onto the balance sheet since 
they ultimately contract with their customers and take the risk of unsold inventory. 


If ZSTN does not have to take inventory on to their balance sheet, then what exact function does the 
company play in this industry? As illustrated earlier, they definitely do not appear to be a leading edge 
technology development company, since they spend almost nothing on R&D. Furthermore, the company 
relies on only 1 patent in their business. As disclosed in their filings, CEO Zhong Bo has legal ownership of 
just one patent in China that they rely on in the operation of their business. On January 9, 2009, they 
entered into a patent license agreement with him for the right to use the patent. 


The foregoing discussion merely begs the question: “What does ZSTN do?” It appears they are just passing 
orders from customers to suppliers and acting as a distributor. If they are purely a distributor, then their 
margins and inventory turnover ratio is remarkable in comparison to leading multi-billion dollar U.S. 
technology product distributors. 


As the table below illustrates, profit margins average around 1.5% vs. ZSTN’s reported 12.4% and inventory 
turnover ratios are closer to 12x as opposed to ~200x.
ZSTN’s financial model appears to favor all its constituents except their shareholders. As illustrated, since 
raising money from investors last year, ZSTN has continued to grow its outstanding accounts receivables 
and advances to suppliers, while reducing accounts payable to almost nothing. Moreover, as we’ll explore 
later, it appears that cash is being siphoned from the company by management to other outside entities. In 
return, shareholders are being rewarded with reports of ever increasing sales and net income, but no 
evidence of growth in cash generation.
Red Flag #2: 3 Auditors in 3 Years 


ZSTN has changed its accountant/auditor a remarkable three times in only three years. This fact is plainly 
disclosed by the company in its proxy statement (see page 6 here). While not an indication of wrong-doing, 
this repeated change should serve, at the very least, as a major red flag for any potential investor. ZSTN 
recently appointed BDO China Li Xin Da Hua CPA Co., Ltd. to be their auditor in April 2010. 


In FY09 they had Kempisty as their auditor and in 2008 they had AJ. Robbins, PC. It’s noteworthy that 
ZSTN’s first two auditors, AJ Robbins and Kempisty, are both U.S. based accountants with no presence in 
China, or apparent expertise with Chinese companies noted on their websites. 





Red Flag #3: Inexperienced CFO Running a Publicly Listed Company; Earnings Already Restated Once 


John Chen was appointed CFO in October 2009. According to his biography, he does not have the requisite 
experience typically seen for CFOs of publicly listed technology companies. He previously served as a 
banker with Brean Murray and Global Hunter Securities (prolific underwriters of RTOs), neither of which 
had any previous business relationship with ZSTN. Mr Chen is a medical doctor by training, does not have a 
CPA or similar accounting degree, and no apparent technology or cable product industry experience. 
Furthermore, under his tenure as CFO the company has already had to restate earnings once (see here). 





Red Flag #4: No Indications that ZSTN’s Core IPTV Products Are Available to Purchased Anywhere 


Given the forgoing discussion of ZSTN’s impossibly remarkable financials, we turn our attention back again 
to their products. Starting with their IPTV set top boxes, we searched the internet looking for more 
information and outlets to purchase their products. Our search for their ‘branded’ ZST products resulted in 
absolutely nothing. We also searched by their local name “Zhengzhou Shengyang Technology.” 


We’ve provided the following links for the reader to verify our claims.

Furthermore, in the company’s annual report, they claim that they have well established distribution 
channels and regularly attend trade fairs for electronic products to promote themselves (page 6, 10K). A 
quick check of the fairs they mention, provide no indication they’ve attended any of the recent fairs: 


Hong Kong Electronics Fair (here) 


CES Las Vegas (here) 


China Hi-Tech Fair (here) 





Red Flag #5: Questionable New Business Line of GPS Products and Services 


In late 2009, the company purchased certain 'technical know-how' related to the GPS business for $190,136 
(yes under $200,000 thousand). ZSTN says that since Q4'09, they began providing GPS location and tracking 
services to third parties, mainly automobile dealers and plan to participate in the GPS service provider 
business by establishing a partnership with China Unicom (CHU), a wireless network provider. 


By the first 6 months of 2010, ZSTN is already reporting to be selling $6.6m of GPS products with a 21% 
gross margin and $2.1m of GPS services with a 97% reported gross margin. It seems almost improbable that 
within 6 months ZSTN has established an entirely new business in which they have no prior experience, and 
are generating almost $3.5m of gross margin. If our math is correct, that's an astounding 3,582% annualized 
IRR on their investment! 


The company has provided very limited disclosure as to how they have achieved these remarkable results, 
but what is disclosed shows sizable contradictions. To illustrate, the reported GPS products and services 
revenues totaling almost $8.8 million diverges from their most recent discussion of the business in their 
September 2010 investor presentation. As slide 9 clearly indicates, ZSTN has captured only 3 contracts with 
product sales totaling only $2.1 million and service fees totaling only $273,000 (see here). 


Many questions about this new GPS business remain unanswered. For example: 1) Who sold them the 
technical know-how? 2) Who did they hire to help support the tremendous growth of the business? 3) Who 
are the customers? 4) How does this strategically fit with their other businesses? 5) Why are GPS products 
such a hot growth area when they’ve been commercially available already for many years around the 
world? 


What is very clear, in our opinion, is that ZSTN’s core IPTV set-top box business, if it really exists, is under 
pressure and will not grow at the same rate that it’s currently being presented. The move into a seemingly 
unrelated GPS products and services is a development investors should view defensively. 








Red Flag #6: ZSTN Is Vastly Understating Its Competition

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403794/000114420410050427/v197213_ex99-1.htm
In their 10-K, ZSTN names only Motorola (MOT), Cisco (CSCO), and Pace as competitors. However, upon 
some simple fact checking, one quickly realizes that ZSTN doesn’t make a single mention of any China-
based competition! Absent are ZTE, Huawei, UTStarcom, and a host of other significant players in the 
Chinese market. We find it curious and highly unlikely that ZSTN thinks that it doesn't compete against any 
of these much larger local competitors. Oddly enough, by reviewing Pace's business you see that they don't 
even have much of a presence in Asia/China and don't describe China as being a core market for their 
products. If China were a great growth story for Pace, we think they'd at least mention it in their annual 
report. 


See China IPTV market research here. 


See Pace's annual report, lacking any mention of China being a core market for their business, here. 





Red Flag #7: Corporate Governance and Shareholder Structure Major Concern 


The last proxy reveals that Zhong Bo, the Chairmen and CEO, owns almost 43% of the stock and can wield 
the entire decision making power over the company. No director owns a single share in the company, and 
the CFO is the only other member of the executive team owning shares (an insignificant 25,000 shares to be 
precise). There’s virtually no institutional support for the stock other than the largely unknown underwriter 
Westpark Capital who retained 6% of the stock offering. 


The CEO is the father of Zhong Lin, the Chief Operating Officer, and also a director of the company. Mr. Bo 
was kind enough to give his son Mr. Lin a $285,000 retention bonus if he remains continuously employed 
with the company for a period of 24 months. We note that no other members of management have been 
awarded such generous retention bonuses. (See the Retention Agreement From Father to Son here.) 


Larger, and more mysterious, possible misappropriation of shareholder funds are being funneled through 
outside ‘business development’ service providers. To illustrate, in December 2009 ZSTN agreed to pay $1.55 
million to Finance Access, Inc. for “consulting, business development and professional services.” Another 
two mysterious payments of $0.50 million and $0.75 million were made in October 2009 to both Fabulous 
Worldwide Limited and Practical Worldwide Limited, respectively, for providing “business development 
services.” 


We have not been able to find information on any of these three companies to validate their existence. 
What is clear is that after almost 1 year since these payments were made, ZSTN has not made a single 
announcement of any business relationships resulting from these engagements. 


Finance Access Inc. Contract (here) 


Fabulous Worldwide Contract (here) 


Practical Worldwide Limited Contract (here) 


We are skeptical that ZSTN shareholders got either “practical” or “fabulous” services for these payments. 
To put into perspective the magnitude of these three payments, totaling over $2.0 million, they are more 
than 4.4x bigger than ZSTN has spent on research and development for its products in that past 4 years!

Red Flag #8: SEC vs. SAIC Filing Comparison Shows Alarming Discrepancies 





Perhaps the linchpin for our analysis is a comparison of what ZSTN is reporting to China’s State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) vs. what the company is reporting to the SEC and US 
investors; we’ve presented them side-by-side for ease of comparison. The results are astounding and 
provide further evidence that ZSTN’s business appears not to be accurately portrayed to US investors. For 
those readers not familiar with SAIC filing considerations and why they matter, an excellent discussion is 
contained here. 





SAIC vs. SEC Financial Comparison 





The original SAIC Chinese and English translation versions are publicly available here: 





Conclusion: ZSTN Should Be Viewed Extremely Cautiously as an Investment 


We have illustrated more than a few questionable items to consider before investing in ZSTN. We are highly 
skeptical that their business exists in the manner it is being portrayed to U.S. investors. In our opinion, the 
financial profile, governance and share structure have major deficiencies. While, the stock valuation “looks 
cheap” on traditional valuation metrics like Price/Earnings, EV/EBITDA, and EV/Sales, there are clearly many 
reasons why. 


The main concern is the lack of cash generation of this business, and a financial model that appears to favor 
customers, suppliers, and creditors at the expense of shareholders. The most alarming evidence we have 
indicating the potential misrepresentation of their business is the big discrepancy between SAIC and SEC 
financials showing extreme overstatement of revenues, profits, and assets. Furthermore, having had three 
auditors in three years, gives us grave concern for the reliability of the financials. We've seen numerous 
blow-ups recently in the Chinese RTO space. ZSTN fits the mold of another RTO that is a time bomb waiting 
to explode.
