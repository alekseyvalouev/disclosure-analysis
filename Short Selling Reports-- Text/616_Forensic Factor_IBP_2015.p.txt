Installed Building Products - A Misrepresented Roll-Up With
Significant Downside
Apr. 29, 2015 7:28 AM ET5 comments
by: The Forensic Factor


Summary


IBP is the rolled-up amalgamation of 90+ cyclical acquisitions and was in extreme
financial duress as recently as several years ago.


An acquisition less than three years ago resulted in management implicitly valuing
IBP's currency 95% lower than the current stock price. Management altered capex
definition from the original S1.


Detailed allegations from employee lawsuits accuse IBP of requiring its installers to
falsify work documentation, which if true, would be in violation of State and Federal
laws.


IBP's CEO appears to also be the CEO of another company, which shares the same
mailing address as IBP, and we believe is a customer of IBP.


Our base case implies IBP's shares have at least 40% downside & analysis of the
pending Masco installation spin-off suggests IBP is at least 50% overvalued.


We have shared opinions on Seeking Alpha about a diverse group of companies. Two of
the companies we exposed were sued by the SEC for fraud or effectively delisted
(AutoChina and Telestone), while Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) has declined 85% since our
submission and Tangoe (TNGO) has declined 30%. Our last article, published in June
2014, focused on a myriad of red flags at Stonegate Mortgage (NYSE:SGM), which led us
to opine that shareholders faced at least 33% downside. We argued that SGM would
struggle to earn $1.00 per share in 2015 at a time consensus estimates were calling for
$3.00 per share. Today, the 2015 earnings estimate for SGM has fallen to $0.97, while the
stock has declined by more than 35%, reaching our original $9.50 price target.


Installed Building Products (NYSE:IBP) has many of the same troubling characteristics as
SGM that were highlighted prior to the 35% stock decline. This report will discuss
numerous red flags we believe exist at IBP, including: misrepresented financials, subtle
alterations of earnings definitions, overstated cash flow, related party conflicts of interest,
margin goals that appear disconnected from the company's economic model, heretofore
poorly disclosed litigation accusing the company of systematically under-reporting hours

worked and violating Fair Labor Standards Acts, and earnings estimates that have
consistently been revised lower. Despite these issues, IBP trades at a massive growth
multiple that reflects a complete disconnect from its economic reality. Less than three
years ago, management issued shares at a valuation that is 95% lower than today's
astronomical public market valuation. With unabashed sell-side support and promotional
long-term margin goals, IBP's stock has doubled since its IPO, with more than 100% of
the gains attributable to multiple expansion. In fact, 2014 earnings missed the initial
consensus expectations for the year (initiated in mid-2014), while the original 2015
earnings estimates have also been revised lower. Today, IBP trades at a gaudy 18x
trailing EBITDA and more than 50x its aggressive definition of free cash flow.


We believe IBP is worth no more than $14.25 in our base case, which represents 40%
downside to its recent price of $23.50. We generously assume the robust housing market
continues in our base case. Should higher interest rates, a softer economy, or wage
inflation materialize, we believe IBP's stock could have more than 50% downside. Even
with a 50% stock price decline, IBP's market cap would still be up nearly 1,000% from the
$1.62 per share at which management valued the equity when issuing stock to TCI
Holdings less than three years ago.


[Author's note: We emailed IBP IR at investorrelations@installed.net but had not received
a response at the time of submission. Should IR respond, we will happily provide their
views in the comment section below. We have also spoken with management in the past
about business drivers and financial results, but have not heard back yet on our specific
questions].


A Boom & Bust Roll-Up


Not every business can have the EBITDA margins of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or the
innovation of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), but IBP's organic operating model may be one of
the worst we have ever seen. IBP is a roll-up of more than 90 companies focused on low
margin insulation installations. The company's labor intensive model employs 3,600
people, including 2,580 installers across 48 states, with roughly 80% of its revenue
derived from installing insulation in new residential housing. The model is incredibly simple
and lacks any material barriers to entry. IBP purchases insulation (47% of 2014 material
purchases were from three large suppliers) that is installed by its employees around the
tenth week of a fifteen week residential single family construction project. IBP employees
also install garage doors (7% of revenue), shower doors, shelves and mirrors (6% of
revenue), and rain gutters (6% of revenue). The model is highly cyclical with extreme labor
intensity and terrible cash flow.

IBP came public in February 2014 under the cloak of the JOBS Act. Taking advantage of
the limited disclosure requirements stipulated by the JOBS Act, IBP only presented two
years of audited financial statements and selected financial data in its registration
statement. For filers that do not meet the criteria of an emerging growth company under
the JOBS Act, three years of audited financials and five years of selected financial data
are required. As a result of the limited financial disclosures, most investors have limited
insight into IBP's financial performance prior to the housing renaissance. As such, we
believe investors may not fully understand how poorly IBP's model performed in the last
downturn.


According to public filings, IBP acquired more than 90 companies from 1999 through
2013, with the goal of creating a national installation platform. IBP's current CEO Jeff
Edwards oversaw the roll-up strategy as Chairman (since 1999) and CEO (since 2004),
racking up more than $100 million in debt by the peak of the last cycle. Demonstrating the
extreme cyclicality of its model, in the last downturn IBP's revenue collapsed by more than
40% and the company struggled to avoid bankruptcy. While the past is the past, we
believe the extreme cyclicality and challenging economics endemic in IBP's operating
model are relevant as investors contemplate the appropriate multiple.


Based on a 2009 Wayback Machine screen shot from the website of Edwards' investment
company (more on this later), IBP was "doing approximately $400 million in sales" around
the peak of the housing cycle. As such, revenue would have declined by over 40% in just
two years according to the 2011 revenue disclosed in the S1.


By 2009, IBP was in such financial duress that creative financings were required to remain
solvent (IBP was not unique in experiencing challenges during 2009, however its valuation
is unique in 2015 compared to other heavy cyclicals). In March 2009, IBP received a $10
million loan from one of its larger insulation suppliers, Knauf Insulation. The initial $10
million loan was followed by a $2 million lifeline in May 2010 from another insulation
supplier, CertainTeed Corporation. It does not appear the supplier loans were enough to
get IBP through the downturn. Illustrating the perils of a roll-up when the cycle turns, IBP

proceeded to write-off $64.3 million of goodwill in 2010. Amazingly, this represented nearly
60% of the company's total goodwill. Based on public press releases from Harris Williams
& Co, we believe IBP hired a restructuring advisor to avoid bankruptcy. The advisory
engagement with Harris Williams & Co. was led by Geoffrey Frankel, who was the head of
Harris Williams & Co.'s Restructuring Group. The need to restructure its balance sheet
seems to square with information found in the S1.


According to IBP's S1 filing, the Edwards Investors (which included IBP's current CEO)
along with other existing investors purchased $27.8 million of IBP's $105 million credit
facility in 2010. They promptly converted their purchase to second lien debt, presumably
at a large loss to the lender. As part of the restructuring, this debt, along with $4.3 million
of unpaid interest, was written off to zero. In July 2011, private equity firm Littlejohn
purchased the remaining $77.6 million of the credit facility. The "Recapitalization and
Exchange Agreement" suggests they acquired the debt from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), GE
Business Financial Services, and Huntington Bank (NASDAQ:HBAN). We believe the
level of unpaid interest implies IBP had stopped paying interest on its credit facility.
According to the S1, Littlejohn purchased the first lien debt at 75% of face value, which
resulted in a significant loss for the lending syndicate (exchanged $77.6 million of face
value debt for equity and preferreds valued at $58.2 million, resulting in a $18.5 million
gain on cancellation of debt). Littlejohn ultimately converted its first lien debt for 1,000
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 300,000 shares of Redeemable Common Stock.


We commend the savvy investments made by the Edwards' and Littlejohn. However, it is
worth noting that successfully saving IBP from bankruptcy did not alter the inherent
challenges of the business. It appears the equity sponsors understood that IBP's business
deserved an extremely low multiple, which can be observed in the treatment of IBP's
currency. According to the Prospectus, pre-IPO shareholders invested in IBP with a cost
basis of approximating $2.44 per share. Additionally, in August 2012 (well into the housing
recovery), IBP acquired TCI Holdings for $4.7 million, consisting of 2.553 million shares
and $600,000 of cash. The transaction valued the 2.553 million common shares at $4.1
million, which represented 11.5% of total shares out. As such, less than three years ago,
management and the Board valued their own equity at $1.62 per share, or just over $35
million for the entire IBP equity market value. Today's euphoric $740 million market cap
implies a three year, 20x return. This type of silliness is usually reserved for social media
or biotech investors, not installers of insulation.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3114826-installed-building-products-a-misrepresented-roll-up-with-significant-downside 5/25


We believe IBP's long-term financial targets are highly misleading and partially
responsible for the current fundamental disconnect of the stock price. Based on our
understanding of IBP's business model, public comps, as well as historical results, we
believe management's targets are unreasonable and irresponsible. On its Q1'14
conference call (May 2014), management outlined long-term targets of "mid-teens
EBITDA margins" and "low-teen EBIT margins" with a 20% contribution margin "based
upon history." While details on the required housing starts implied in management's
targets are unclear, we believe using the last cycle's peak is incredibly disingenuous.


In 2014, IBP generated 27% gross margins, 8.5% adjusted EBITDA margins, and 5.6%
adjusted EBIT margins. The reported financial margins are relatively consistent with what
an analyst would expect from IBP's operating model and end markets. Barring another
2004-2007 housing bubble, we believe IBP has very few levers that could materially
enhance margins in a manner consistent with its long-term targets. Based on
conversations with the company, as well as our own estimates, we believe material costs
represent approximately 2/3 of COGS, while labor costs account for the remaining 1/3 of
COGS. So which cost line can IBP leverage?


Some natural economies of scale may exist in material procurement, however we do not
believe IBP will keep those economics. Management has stated their plan includes
capturing better economics on materials and labor (we'll come back to labor). However,
margin is effectively a zero sum game within a supply chain. So IBP's margin
improvements would imply margin capture from another part of the value chain. It appears
management believes the economics will come from negotiating better rates on insulation
purchases. While there should be some economies of scale associated with increased
insulation purchases, it seems foolish to assume incremental purchasing discounts to list
price would not be shared with IBP's homebuilder clients. According to IBP's 2014 10K,
the largest 10 homebuilders represented 14.3% of revenue in 2014, which was up from
9.0% in 2013. The year-over-year revenue increase from homebuilders represented 45%
of IBP's revenue growth in 2014 (the rest of the business only grew 13% in 2014). The
dependence on large homebuilders is growing at the same time national homebuilders are
actively looking to reduce their own costs. Gross margin pressure has been a common
theme for many homebuilders in 2015 as the benefit from cheap land acquired during the
downturn has run its course. As IBP's growth appears to be more dependent on
pricing/mix, we are skeptical homebuilders will happily cede incremental upstream supply
chain value to its installer partners. In Q4'14, we estimate IBP's number of jobs grew 9.9%
year-over-year, which marked a substantial deceleration from the 15.7% growth rate in the

third quarter. Meanwhile, we estimate pricing, mix, and building code changes grew 6.5%
year-over-year, which represented an acceleration from the 2% growth in the third quarter
2014.


Another headwind affecting the margin improvement story is the uncertainty around the
pace and durability of the housing recovery. We do believe the housing market is in a
cyclical recovery, but the economic data on housing starts/completes does not bode well
for the acceleration IBP requires. Every year, optimism abounds in anticipation of the
spring selling season (which disappointed last year). IBP management admits single
family completions are the largest driver of their volumes. Unfortunately, completions are
unequivocally slowing. According to census data, the year-over-year growth in
completions has decelerated for the past three quarters. In Q4'14, completions were up
just 7% year-over-year, which slowed to 2% growth in the just completed Q1'15. With
single family housing starts in the midst of a three year deceleration (24% growth in '12,
15% in '13, 5% in '14 and only 4% in Q1'15), the tailwind that has fueled IBP's top-line
growth and margin improvement appears to be vanishing.


The geographic dispersion within the slowdown may be even more problematic for IBP.
According to management, 50% of their revenue is from "the U.S. Census Bureau region
of the Midwest and the Northeast." According to the U.S. Census, these two regions
comprised between 24%-25% of single family housing completes and starts in 2013 and
2014. In the Midwest, completes actually declined by 7% in Q1'15, while the Northeast
region declined by 11%. Making these declines even more alarming (specifically the

Midwest) is the fact Q1'15 lapped the awful weather from Q1'14. As we will discuss below,
we believe IBP's concentration in slower growth regions is the impetus for questionable
acquisitions in faster growth geographies.


Turning to labor costs, which comprise the other 1/3 of COGS that management could
potentially leverage, we do not think the investment community fully appreciates the
variable nature of this line item. IBP employs 2,580 installers that can only work so many
hours per day. As such, with high utilization rates, labor expense (and the number of
installers) will grow proportionately with any growth in projects. Further, as discussed later,
we believe IBP's labor-related costs may actually be understated.


Despite immaterial opportunities for operating leverage, management has set extremely
aggressive long-term margin goals, which the sell-side has embedded in their out-period
estimates. For example, analysts are blindly projecting 245 and 216 basis points of
EBITDA margin improvement in 2015 and 2016, respectively. For this to occur, IBP would
require contribution margins in the mid-to-high 20s, which is above management's already
aggressive target. The result of management's unrealistic margin bogeys has been
forward estimates that can justify higher price targets, but have not been accurate. As we
show later, the consensus estimates for 2014 and 2015 have declined materially, as the
rubber meeting the proverbial road has once again been pushed out. With slowing new
construction, homebuilder clients that have refocused on increasing their own margins,
and labor pressures (more below), we do not believe management's goals are appropriate
and expect estimates to continue to decline. This of course begs the question, "Is IBP
perhaps cutting corners in an attempt to reach its margin goals?"


Do Lawsuits Open the Kimono on the Source of Margin Improvement?


As discussed above, we are highly skeptical that IBP can generate substantial leverage
from purchasing materials. Leveraging labor costs, which constitute approximately one-
third of COGS, seems even more unrealistic. At the highest level, blue collar employers
like IBP are experiencing cyclical and secular headwinds. Unemployment has consistently



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/24/790526-14298934364121456-The-Forensic-Factor_origin.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3114826-installed-building-products-a-misrepresented-roll-up-with-significant-downside 8/25


declined, while wage pressures are building as evidenced by minimum wage increases
from a growing number of employers (Wal-Mart, Target, & McDonald's for starters) and
States. In addition to wage inflation, blue collar employers are battling stubbornly high
workers' compensation costs, and ObamaCare will only add to this pressure. The
employee mandate under ObamaCare went into effect in 2015, which requires businesses
with more than 50 employees to offer full-time employees (as well as their dependents up
to age 26) affordable health insurance. IBP self insurers their healthcare and workers'
compensation, which represents an expense item that we believe is misunderstood (as a
side note, we believe most investors, and all sell-side analysts have incorrectly ignored
these related liabilities in their enterprise value calculations). In 2014, IBP's healthcare
benefit expense, net of employee contributions, increased by only 2%. Remarkably,
employee growth was 12.5%, creating an unsustainably troubling disconnect that should
be correlated. One possible explanation is that younger and healthier employees may be
enrolling in healthcare to avoid ObamaCare penalties. If their contributions are offsetting
IBP's out-of-pocket expense, we have to wonder if the out-of-pocket expenses to
employee are truly "affordable" under ObamaCare definitions. At a minimum, this trend is
very unlikely to continue once the Cadillac Tax goes into effect.


What is more troubling than the oddities of IBP's healthcare benefit expense is the
possibility that IBP has been understating costs through illegal tactics. In IBP's 10K, they
disclose several lawsuits in their risk statements, but the detailed allegations of state and
federal violations are understandably excluded. While it would be imprudent to draw
definitive conclusions from employee accusation levied against IBP, the charges are
nonetheless concerning in the context of IBP's focus on leveraging its expense structure.


In Wells vs. Installed Building Products II (case number 13-2-05149-4 filed in Superior
Court of King County, Washington), former installation employees led a class action
lawsuit against IBP in Washington. The complaint states that IBP "maintained false and
inaccurate payroll records, underreporting the hours that Plaintiffs and the Class worked
for the defendant." The complaint also alleges that IBP employees "frequently worked
more than 8 hour days, worked on weekends and worked in excess of 40 hours in a
workweek on various wage insulation projects." According to the lawsuit, IBP's
commercial projects contractually obligated them to pay overtime for hours in excess of 8
hours in a workday and for weekend work, which was consistent with the requirements of
local statues and ordinances. Instead of complying with the law, the former employees
detail how IBP instead resorted to "shaving hours" and "falsified and/or failed to keep
proper work records, [while paying] far fewer hours than plaintiffs and class members
worked and were entitled to under law, and failed to pay daily, weekend and weekend

overtime rates as required by statute." The complaint insinuated this illegal business
practice was enacted because "many class members are recent immigrants, many of
whom do not speak English [and] are likely to not enforce valid legal claims."


While the Washington case is biting, the second case we found is even more inflammatory
given the specificity of the allegations. In Rosas vs. TCI Contracting, LLC. d/b/a Installed
Building Products of Nashville (case number 3:13-cv-00724 filed in U.S. District Count in
Tennessee), IBP was accused of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act. The complaint
states that IBP violated state and federal law for failing to pay "its employee insulation
installers for all the time worked, including failing to pay such employees the overtime
wage they owed under the law." The following is directly from the complaint:

Further, the employees claimed there was a "policy or practice" to NOT pay "overtime
piece rate for most or all of the overtime hours they have worked," which violated FLSA as
well as Tennessee law. Just as concerning, when three of the four lead plaintiffs attempted
to submit their ACTUAL hours worked, they were punished and ultimately terminated
(note: TCI is an IBP subsidiary):

While we are generally skeptical towards the merits of lawsuits filed by former employees,
it may be imprudent to dismiss the allegations considering substantially similar claims
were made in two different regions of the country. While IBP ultimately settled these
lawsuits in 2014 (after one received approval for class action status), if there is an
institutionalized practice of underreporting hours worked to avoid overtime, this would not
only be illegal, but would obviously understate compensation and overstate profitability.


Accounting Flags and Questionable Adjustment


The financial tables presented by roll-ups warrant careful scrutiny because of the flexibility
management teams have to subjectively determine whether expenses are recurring or
"one-time" in nature. Accounting gimmicks and non-GAAP adjustments for items such as
goodwill write-downs and restructuring expenses often lead investors to incorrect
conclusions concerning the underlying health of a business model. After a detailed
analysis of IBP's recent results, we believe management has misconstrued its financial
health with accounting tricks and questionable pro-forma adjustments. We believe these
disingenuous alterations to financial results are aimed at hitting sell-side estimates (Q4'14

would have been missed without an unusual adjustments). Amplifying our concerns about
IBP's financial presentations is the fact material weakness relating to internal control over
financial reporting was identified by its auditor during the fiscal 2012 and 2013 audits.


Since coming public, IBP has steadily increased its reliance on non-GAAP adjustments. In
its first earnings release as a public company, IBP used three non-GAAP adjustments to
bridge GAAP results to Adjusted EBITDA. In the most recent period, the number of
adjustments had doubled to six. While most companies take liberties with adjustments, we
found management's $1.79 million adjustment for legal settlements particularly
questionable, especially considering it represented the difference between meeting sell-
side estimates and a significant earnings miss. What may be more troubling about this
unusual charge was that it was the only legal settlements charge in 2014, and unlike past
years, appeared without an associated explanation (at least that we could find). In 2012
and 2013, the "legal settlements and reserves" lines were accompanied by extensive
detail in the company's SEC filings. Management did not provide an explanation for the
outsized expense in its 2014 10-K (although explanations for the prior year's charge were
still detailed in the 2014 10-K).


After failing to find an explanation in the 10-K for the outsized pro-forma add back, we
looked towards the quarter-over-quarter change in the cash flow from operations section
of the cash flow statement. Typically, quarterly variations in non-working capital
components of the statement of cash flow from operations provides valuable insight into
unusual gains, losses, or charges that can impact earnings. Adding to our suspicion that
something is amiss at IBP, the company chooses not to provide line items for cash flow

from operations in their 10-Qs (example below where only aggregate CFO is provided in
the third quarter 2014 10-Q). Aside from Chinese frauds, we rarely see companies fail to
disclose quarterly cash flow line items.


While we were unable to find an explanation for the excluded charge in SEC filings,
management did reference an add-back for "unusual adverse development in workers'
compensation expense" on its Q4'14 earnings call. If this adjustment is indeed excluding
workers' comp adverse development, then we believe IBP is fundamentally
misrepresenting the economics of its business. IBP self-insures their workers'
compensation risk while operating in the high hazard construction industry. As such,
workers compensation expense and periods of elevated claim activity are part of the
normal cost of doing business. Accidents and adverse development are recurring
dynamics in the blue collar field of insulation installation. Excluding expenses from periods
with elevated claims or adverse development would be as misleading as a grocer
excluding the costs of disposing expired food items. Illustrating how unscrupulous the
Q4'14 exclusion appears, if we accept the $1.79 million workers' compensation expense
exclusion, then the "adjusted" Q4'14 expense would have been just $2.069 million. This
would mean management's "adjusted" Q4'14 workers' comp expense was actually
BELOW the run-rate for both Q3'14 and Q2'14. Further supporting why we believe

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3114826-installed-building-products-a-misrepresented-roll-up-with-significant-downside 15/25


management lumped recurring expenses into the "non-recurring" bucket, IBP's adjusted
Q4'14 workers' comp expense would have been just 1.4% of revenue, which would have
represented the lowest level of the year.


As is often the case, the sell-side analysts glossed over the manipulated adjustments and
the headlines suggested IBP "met" consensus numbers. After management's pro-forma
adjustments, IBP reported Q4'14 adjusted EPS of $0.20 per share, which coincidentally
matched the consensus EPS estimate. However, inconsistent treatment under the new
adjusted EPS definition accounted for $0.04 of the $0.20 of EPS. Without the subtle
change to its earnings presentation, IBP would have earned just $0.16 per share, which
would have been a 20% shortfall compared to consensus estimates.


Conflicts of Interest Abound


Talk to any public company management team and they will complain that their job is all-
encompassing. As such, it is important for a CEO to be highly committed and focused on
detailed execution, especially for a roll-up with a history of material weakness in financial
reporting. Jeff Edwards appears to not only be the CEO of IBP, but shockingly, he appears
to also be the CEO of another company on the side. We initially came across a number of
confusing articles that referenced Jeff Edwards as a Columbus-based commercial real
estate developer. For example, the December 2014 issue of Columbus CEO described
Mr. Edwards as "Jeff Edwards of Edwards Communities, a developer of apartment rentals

since the '80s." We found other examples of Mr. Edwards apparent commitment to his
own development company here, here, here, and here. We even found a promotional flier
that lists him as the "President" of the Edwards Companies.


Mr. Edwards' active engagement as CEO and/or President of a development company is
mildly confusing since the original S1 filing, as well as each successive registration
statement, clearly stated that "prior to joining" IBP, Jeff Edwards "acted as an officer and
strategist for the Edwards Companies." We believe the words "acted" and "prior" (past
tense) are not only misleading, but also highly inappropriate. If indeed Jeff Edwards, who
joined IBP in 1999, is still acting in the capacity of CEO and/or President of the Edwards
Companies, then this not only needed to be disclosed to investors, but it also presents the
potential for grave conflicts. While the S1 language is misleading, Mr. Edwards'
employment agreement provides little comfort that his potentially conflicting role has
indeed been vacated:


While his employment agreement requires Mr. Edwards to devote the amount of time
necessary to conduct our business and affairs, he is also permitted to engage in other
business activities that do not create a conflict of interest or substantially interfere with his
service to us, including non-competitive operational activities for his real estate
development business.

We find this arrangement highly unusual, and again, potentially inaccurate when
considering his other entities appear to not only be in the "building supply and insulation"
industry, but also customers of IBP. While related party transactions may be negotiated in
good faith, we nonetheless see significant potential for abuse (for example IBP selling
insulation installation to Edwards Companies at a significant premium, hence providing
inflated margins). In IBP's 10-K, they do disclose the following related party sales,
purchases, and rent for 2012 - 2014:


We sell installation services to other companies related through common or affiliated
ownership. We also purchase services and materials and pay rent to companies with
common or related ownership.


Despite the disclosures, investors are left in the dark as to which related parties account
for which line items. For example, we believe some portion of the related party
transactions are the result of adding the CEO of M/I Homes (NYSE:MHO) to IBP's Board
of Directors. Further, an existing supplier was deemed to be a related party for some
period after TCI was acquired. Specific to the Edwards' related entities, a cozy relationship
appears to exist with IBP considering a common CEO and shared mailing address (495
South High Street in Columbus, OH). Unfortunately, investors are unable to discern which
parties account for which related transactions based on the opaque and limited related
party disclosures.


Any suspicion towards IBP's related party dealings was given further credence by the
recent insider transaction. On March 16, 2015, IBP announced they had repurchased $6.1
million of common stock in a privately negotiated transaction with an entity called IBS.
Buying back stock is typically a shareholder friendly activity and a sign of management's
confidence in the business. However, the disclosure that IBS (the seller) was beneficially
owned in part by Jeff Edwards, IBP's CEO, is alarming.


Again, we must emphasize that there is no concrete evidence IBP has done anything
untoward (aside from misleading language in the S1). However, juxtaposed to the myriad
of other issues we have identified at IBP, the mere potential of related businesses

acquiring materials and/or services at inflated prices should be addressed.


Is the Roll-up Fraying?


Roll-ups can sustain momentum as long as ample acquisitions exist at discounted
multiples. However, one sign of acquisition fatigue is when the acquirer must target larger
and riskier companies in order to move the financial needle. Based on its most recent
acquisitions, we believe IBP is facing pressure to increase the size of its marginal
acquisitions. We also believe management may be desperately shifting its acquisition
strategy to new geographies as the Midwest and Northeast housing markets have slowed
dramatically. Since 2012, IBP has completed nine acquisitions. Based on public filings, we
estimate that IBP paid an average of 0.32x revenue for the first seven acquisitions, with
the revenue multiples ranging between 0.10x - 0.57x. Last month, IBP announced the
acquisition of BDI Insulation for $36 million, or 1.03x revenue, which is 66% more
expensive (on a revenue multiple) than the richest previous acquisition.


BDI provides insulation installation through nine branches (three in the central valley of
California, and two each in Utah, Idaho and Washington). We presume IBP justified the
more expensive price tag based on BDI's exposure to the faster growth western markets.
However, we do not view BDI's exposure to markets such as Bakersfield, Visalia, and
Hesperia (see map below - each location in a BDI subsidiary) as attractive, or worthy of
such a large premium. Instead, we believe the BDI acquisition is a harbinger of what is to
come - larger, more expensive acquisitions that bring substantially more risk.

Valuation Fundamentally Disconnected from Reality


Since coming public at $11.00 in February 2014, IBP's stock price has more than doubled
to $23.50 per share. Amazingly, more than 100% of the price increase has been the result
of multiple expansion. As we illustrate in the table below, IBP's actual 2014 EBITDA was
nearly 5% lower than the 2014 consensus estimate at the time the sell-side began
initiating coverage last summer. We have also included tables from Bloomberg that
document the precipitous decline in 2015 estimates for revenue, EBITDA, and earnings.
Outside of irrational periods or short-term randomness, stock prices usually move in the
same direction as estimate revisions. IBP's stock has inexplicably done the opposite,
ripping higher while consensus estimates have moved lower. For example, in June 2014,
the consensus estimate for 2015 EBITDA was $81 million while IBP's stock was under
$13.50. Today, the same 2015 consensus EBITDA estimate has declined to $68 million
while the stock has advanced to $23.50. As a result of the extreme multiple expansion,
IBP's 2015 EV/EBITDA multiple increased by 100% while the actual EBITDA estimate
declined by 17% (Note on the Bloomberg image: Fitting to one image compresses charts.
Left 3 slides are 2014; right 3 images are 2015. Top to bottom for both 2014 and 2015 are

IBP is currently trading at 18x trailing 2014 EBITDA and 12x 2015 EBITDA estimate that
we believe is too high. But IBP's valuation appears even more preposterous when looking
at a less "fudge-able" metric, free cash flow. At its momentum-driven $23.50 stock price,
IBP trades at more than 50x its 2014 free cash flow. We believe the effective FCF multiple
is even more expensive when considering the shenanigans associated with roll-up cash
flow statements.

Most roll-ups have decent cash flow profiles based on the dynamic of using cash flow from
financing to fund acquisitions. As a result, capital expenditures and other capitalized
investments are gained through acquisitions. Additionally, cash flow from operations
typically gets an artificial benefit from acquired working capital being monetized/unwound.
For example, in 2014, IBP acquired three companies for $12.4 million in cash (cash
outflow from investing) and $3.5 million of seller obligations (future cash flow from
financing). With the acquisitions, IBP acquired $3.7 million of net working capital, which
results in overstated organic cash flow from operations as the working capital is unwound
in the cash conversion cycle. Acquired vehicles and other property plant & equipment
reduce organic capital expenditures, further overstating free cash flow.


Amazingly, despite the cash flow benefits from the incessant acquisitions, IBP's free cash
flow has been anemic. Even more concerning than the nonexistent cash flow,
management subtly altered its definition of capex, which had a material impact on
reported free cash flow. In its S1 filing, management's definition of capital expenditures
included the purchase of PPE as well as new vehicles purchased under capital lease
obligations:


We expect our 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $18 to $20 million
(including new capital lease obligations) primarily related to purchases of vehicles
and various equipment to support our operations and increased net revenue."


However, in subsequent filings, the definition of capex was altered to exclude new lease
obligations. Suggesting that lease obligations on vehicles should not be included as
economic capex is absurd, especially for an installation business that requires daily truck-
rolls to sites. For example, in the most recent 10-K, they calculate capex without the
previously-included capital lease obligations:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3114826-installed-building-products-a-misrepresented-roll-up-with-significant-downside 22/25


Total capital expenditures were $6.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively


As the table below highlights, 2013 capital expenditures amounted to $19.8 million under
the original definition that included vehicles purchased under capital leases. However,
based on management's altered definition, capex would have been just $2.7 million.
Clearly, management's economic capex was not $2.7 million, which is corroborated by
their original guidance of $18 to $20 million quoted above. Had management maintained a
consistent approach to defining capex (based on economic realities), then IBP would have
generated NEGATIVE free cash flow for each of the last four years.


In a vacuum, IBP's valuation is absurd. Unfortunately, there have not been pure
comparables against which the silliness of IBP can be seen. That is about to change. The
upcoming spin-off of Masco's (NYSE:MAS) Installation business will likely serve as a
negative catalyst for IBP as it illuminates the extreme valuation. On September 30, 2014,
Masco announced that it would be spinning its Installation business by mid-2015.
Ironically, the sell-side contingent that has reaped adulation on IBP, universally praised
Masco for its plans to divest a similar installation business.


ISI applauded the decision in a note tilted "MAS: Finally Hitting Delete on Installation"
(10/1/14) that surmised the move was the result of the "extensive strategic review
undertaken" by management to create value (divesting the IBP comp = a valuable
decision).
Longbow Research argued that Masco management decided to spin-off its installation
business because it was "depressing earnings power and valuation."
Jefferies was encouraged that the divestiture would "dampen the cyclicality of the
business."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3114826-installed-building-products-a-misrepresented-roll-up-with-significant-downside 23/25


Credit Suisse told institutional clients that Masco will be a "stronger, somewhat less
cyclical business mix post-spin, with a step-up in operating margins given the lower
margin profile of the Install business."


While we strongly disagree with the sell-side's positive assessment of IBP, it is telling that
the analyst community universally believes Masco will be far better off without such a
lousy Installation business under its corporate umbrella.


So how will the pure Masco comp look against IBP? In a recent note, FBR calculated the
sum-of-parts valuation on Masco, prescribing a $24.15 value for Masco's core business
and a $2.20 for the Installation business. Based on Masco's market value, this implies a
$763 million valuation for its Installation business. Management had previously stated
Installation Co. would be spun off with $200 million of net debt. As such, based on FBR's
sum-of-the-parts analysis, we can determine the enterprise value will be approximately
$963 million. Despite Masco Install having nearly 3x more revenue and more than 2x the
EBITDA of IBP (with likely more margin upside), Masco Install's enterprise value would
only be 17% greater than IBP, while their market capitalizations would be nearly identical.
As a result, the current stock price of IBP would carry a 149% premium on EV/Revenue
and a 73% premium on EV/EBITDA to the pending Masco Install. We see no reason this
disparity will persist, and should IBP trade towards Masco Install's implied valuation, IBP's
stock would trade between $8 to $12.50 per share.


Similar to our last report on Stonegate, we believe IBP and its sell-side sponsors have
misrepresented the economic realities of its business. The result has been overstated out-
year estimates that have been consistently revised lower, but a stock price that has
advanced on a fictitious story. If we assume the housing market in the U.S. remains

robust, and IBP is indeed able to expand EBITDA margins by an additional 100 basis
points while maintaining a premium multiple of 9.0x EBITDA despite all of the idiosyncratic
issues that would seem to warrant a multiple discount, the stock would trade at $14.25 per
share, or 40% lower than its current price. While this would still imply a significant
premium to Masco Install, it would directionally be more reasonable than the current
nonsensical valuation. However, should anything go wrong (higher interest rates and/or a
softer economy result in housing market lethargy, lower housing completions, wage
inflation, homebuilders insist on sharing any purchasing economies of scale, litigation risk,
etc.), we would expect substantially more downside than our base case contemplates.

Not sure what your beef is with this company but i think time will tell that your thesis is a terrible one. Good luck with
your short. As to your summary:


All BP companies 3-5 years ago were in distress - stock, builders firstsoure etc. IBP is highly levered to new home
starts


Company did what it needed to do to survive


Allegations are just that. Pull up the same on any BP company with a labor force


Company is run day to day by Michael Miler. Geoff Edwards is owner and controls the vast majority of stock


Masco install is not a pure play insulation player which will hurt them. Wait to you see their standalone financials.


Again good luck. Dont bet the farm.

Without doing any fact checking or follow up research, the below stands out as obvious exaggeration. 
1) Kinda a stretch to assume the internal controls of a company is the same two years after it went public and with a
different CFO now than it did in 2012. 
2) SHOULDN'T the run-rate of workers comp during non building season (winter i.e Q4) be BELOW the run-rate
during building season (Spring Summer i.e. Q2-Q3). I would think if workers comp is higher in Q4 than it is unusual
and should be adjusted. (I assume it was lower in Q4 in prior years).

CjazMitch, I believe Q4 is their seasonally strongest quarter. Housing starts ramp in the summer but
completions are highest in 4Q (28-29% of annual housing completes happen in 4Q the past couple of years).
If that is true, workmans comp expense should be higher in q4.
