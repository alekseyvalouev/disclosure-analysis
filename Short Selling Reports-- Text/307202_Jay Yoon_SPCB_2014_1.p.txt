SuperCom:	Overvalued	By	Almost	60%
Top	Idea | Oct.	29,	2014	5:00	AM	ET124	comments

Summary


Due	to	the	non-recurring	and	lumpy	nature	of	government	EID	contracts,	SPCB's	pro
forma	revenue	has	not	grown	over	the	past	four	years.


FY	2014	has	been	an	unusually	strong	year	in	terms	of	EID	adoption.	Going	forward,
global	EID	adoption	rate	and	revenue	growth	are	expected	to	decline	substantially.


The	Company	provides	commoditized	EID	system	integration	services	and	appears
to	have	lost	market	share	to	competitors.


A	turnaround	in	the	RFID	division	is	not	likely	given	SPCB's	weak	competitive
position	and	minimal	amount	of	R&D	investments.


SPCB	shares	are	overvalued	by	almost	60%	at	the	current	price	level.


So	far,	2014	has	been	a	good	year	for	SuperCom	(NASDAQ:SPCB)	and	its	shareholders.
For	the	year,	SPCB	shares	have	increased	174%	from	$4.85	to	$13.29	per	share	(as	of
October	27th).	The	successful	acquisition	of	On	Track	Innovations'	(NASDAQ:OTIV)
Smart	ID	business	in	December	2013,	as	well	as	recent	contract	wins,	have	been	the
primary	catalysts	for	the	Company's	large	share	price	increase.	The	dramatic	turnaround
in	SPCB's	business	has	attracted	positive	attention	from	both	Wall	Street	research
analysts	and	Seeking	Alpha	contributors.	Over	the	past	few	months,	many	bullish	articles
have	been	published	on	Seeking	Alpha	(here	and	here)	arguing	that	SPCB	shares	are
poised	to	increase	significantly	from	the	current	share	price	level.


My	analysis	of	SPCB	progressed	in	a	very	similar	fashion	to	my	analysis	and	eventual
short	of	VOXX	earlier	this	month.	Like	VOXX,	I	initially	thought	that	SPCB	could	be	an
interesting	long	opportunity,	but	I	eventually	changed	my	opinion	to	a	short	following	a
detailed	analysis	of	the	Company's	business	and	financials.	Through	my	research,	I
discovered	that	analysts	and	investors	are	mistaken	in	their	belief	that	SPCB	is	a	leading-
edge	biometric	player	in	the	beginning	stages	of	a	prolonged	period	of	growth.	Instead,	my
research	revealed	that	the	Company's	EID	revenue	is	highly	unpredictable	by	nature	and
that	the	projected	growth	in	EID	revenue	in	FY	2014	is	likely	not	sustainable	over	the	long

term.	I	also	discovered	that	the	Company's	EID	division,	which	includes	the	recently
acquired	Smart	ID	business,	is	a	commoditized	business	operating	in	a	highly	competitive
environment.	Finally,	in	addition	to	this,	I	also	learned	that	the	Company	is	just	a	bit	player
in	the	RFID	industry	(<$1mm	of	annual	revenue)	that	will	likely	struggle	to	gain	meaningful
market	share	against	more	established	competitors.	Taking	all	of	these	factors	into
consideration,	I	believe	that	SPCB	shares	are	overvalued	by	almost	60%	at	the	current
share	price	of	$13.29.


Bullish	Sentiment	Driven	By	Smart	ID	Acquisition	and	Recent	Contract	Wins


SPCB	strengthened	its	presence	in	the	EID	segment	via	their	recent	Smart	ID	acquisition.
In	2013,	OTIV	management	made	the	decision	to	sell-off	the	Smart	ID	business	in	order	to
focus	on	their	core	NFC	business.	Interestingly	enough,	the	Smart	ID	division	was	a
business	that	SPCB	had	previously	sold	to	OTIV	back	in	2006.	Thus,	SPCB	was	the
logical	buyer	for	this	asset	given	their	familiarity	with	the	Smart	ID	business	and
established	presence	in	the	EID	industry.	On	December	26th,	SPCB	completed	their
acquisition	of	OTIV's	Smart	ID	division	for	$10mm	plus	an	earn-out	mechanism	of	up	to	a
further	$12.5mm.	The	Smart	ID	purchase	was	a	transformative	acquisition	for	SPCB	that
tripled	the	Company's	revenues.	From	the	acquisition,	SuperCom	increased	the	size	of	its
business	from	$8.8mm	of	revenue	on	a	stand-alone	basis	to	$26.2mm	of	revenue	on	a	pro
forma	basis	(based	on	FY	2012	results).


Since	the	acquisition	closed	on	December	26th,	the	Company	has	signed	up	new	EID
contracts	totaling	over	$54mm.	This	includes	two	large	contracts	of	$25mm	and	$22mm
signed	in	March	2014	and	August	2014,	respectively.	Due	to	the	recent	momentum	in	the
EID	business,	research	analysts	are	bullish	on	the	Company's	prospects	going	forward.
The	Company's	total	pro	forma	revenues	are	projected	to	grow	from	$26.2mm	in	FY	2012
to	approximately	$35mm	in	FY	2014.	Analysts	are	expecting	this	level	of	growth	to
continue	over	the	next	couple	years.


Unpredictable	Top-line	Performance	A	Cause	For	Major	Concern


I	do	not	share	the	bullish	sentiment	of	analysts	regarding	SCPB	for	many	reasons.	One	of
my	primary	concerns	regarding	SCPB	is	the	unpredictable	nature	of	the	Company's
financial	performance.	I	have	attached	below	a	breakout	of	SCPB's	historical	and
projected	revenues	(pro	forma	for	the	Smart	ID	acquisition)	from	FY	2010-FY	2014:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 3/15


As	you	can	see,	top-line	performance	for	SPCB	has	historically	been	very	unpredictable.
This	is	primarily	due	to	the	inherently	volatile	nature	of	the	Company's	EID	business
which,	pro	forma	for	the	Smart	ID	acquisition,	comprises	over	95%	of	the	Company's
revenues.


There	are	a	couple	of	reasons	why	the	Company's	EID	revenues	are	unpredictable.	First,
the	vast	majority	of	SPCB's	EID	contracts	are	comprised	of	one-time	revenue	rather	than
recurring	work.	For	example,	the	Company's	recently	signed	March	2014	contract	for
$25mm	consists	of	~$18mm-$20mm	of	one-time	revenue	to	be	completed	primarily	this
year	and	~$5mm-7mm	of	recurring	revenue	to	be	recognized	over	approximately	five
years	(representing	~$1mm	of	recurring	revenue	per	year).	This	is	consistent	with	what
management	has	previously	stated	about	recurring	revenue,	on	average,	representing
approximately	"20%-30%"	of	the	total	EID	contract	value.	To	further	illustrate	my	point,	I
have	provided	below	a	breakdown	of	the	Company's	1H	2014	revenue	by	contract:


As	you	can	see,	just	8%	of	the	Company's	1H	2014	revenue	came	from	annual	recurring
revenue.	The	rest	of	the	Company's	revenue	was	from	one-time	revenue	from	contracts
for	follow-on	orders	or	new	deployments.	This	low	amount	of	annual	recurring	revenue
contradicts	some	statements	that	I	have	seen	from	various	Seeking	Alpha	contributor
7/18/2019 SuperCom: Overvalued By Almost 60% - SuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ:SPCB) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 4/15


articles	about	SPCB.	In	these	articles,	the	authors	state	that	approximately	60%-80%	of
the	Company's	annual	revenue	recurs	from	year-to-year.	For	example,	in	Jonathan
Fishman's	recent	SPCB	article,	he	states	the	following:


"…The	structure	of	the	company's	contracts	is	such	that	around	60%-80%	of	total
sales	are	repeating	business…"


I	believe	that	Mr.	Fishman	is	misinterpreting	management's	statements	about	the	structure
of	their	contracts	and	the	recurring	nature	of	their	revenue.	Management	did	in	fact	state
that	60%-80%	of	their	EID	business	is	recurring.	However,	management	was	actually
referring	to	the	fact	that	60%-80%	of	their	business	is	from	customers	that	have	worked
with	SPCB	in	the	past.	In	other	words,	SPCB's	definition	of	recurring	could	include	a
customer	that	awarded	a	contract	to	SPCB	in	2010	and	then	did	not	award	them	another
contract	until	2014.	Thus,	Mr.	Fishman	is	wrong	in	his	assumption	that	60%-80%	of
contracts	are	structured	as	annual	repeating	business.	Instead,	as	I	just	noted	previously,
the	average	EID	contract	is	structured	to	have	20%-30%	of	the	total	value	as	repeating
business	spread	out	over	four	or	five	years.	The	following	comments	by	management
during	their	Q1	2014	earnings	call	provides	further	clarification:


"…in	a	typical	EID	bid,	the	first	duration	of	the	bid	could	be	around	four	to	five	years
and	out	of	the	bid	size	that	is	announced	run	20%-30%	of	that	is	the	referred
element	which	usually	continues	throughout	all	those	first	five	years…"


SPCB	also	referenced	the	non-recurring	nature	of	EID	revenue	in	their	FY	2013	20-F:


"A	portion	of	our	sales	is	not	recurring	sales;	therefore,	quarterly	and	annual	sales
levels	will	likely	fluctuate.	Sales	in	any	period	may	not	be	indicative	of	sales	in	future
periods…"


In	addition	to	a	low	amount	of	annual	recurring	revenue,	the	second	reason	for	the	EID
segment's	inconsistent	results	is	due	to	the	lumpy	nature	of	government	EID	contracts.
OTIV	discussed	the	unpredictable	nature	of	government	EID	work	in	the	Risk	Factors
section	of	their	FY	2012	20-F:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 5/15


"Our	quarterly	revenues	and	operating	results	have	varied	substantially	in	the	past
and	may	continue	do	so	in	the	future…	The	size	and	timing	of	orders	placed	by	our
governmental	customers	is	difficult	to	predict.	Governmental	projects	typically
involve	a	protracted	competitive	procurement	process	and	in	some	circumstances
litigation	following	the	award	of	a	contract…"


SuperCom	also	discussed	the	unpredictable	nature	of	government	EID	work	in	the	Risk
Factors	section	of	their	FY	2013	20-F:


"The	typical	sales	cycle	for	our	government	customers	has,	to	date,	ranged	from	9	to
24	months…	A	lengthy	sales	cycle	may	have	an	impact	on	the	timing	of	our
revenue,	which	may	cause	our	quarterly	operating	results	to	fall	below	investor
expectations…"


As	referenced	in	the	statements	from	OTIV	and	SPCB	above,	the	bid	process	for	a
government	EID	contract	is	a	long,	drawn-out	process	typically	lasting	between	9	months
to	2	years.	Due	to	the	long	sales	cycle,	the	timing	of	contract	wins	is	difficult	to	predict.	In
certain	years,	SPCB	could	win	multiple	contracts,	while	in	other	years	the	Company	could
win	just	one	or	even	zero	contracts.	Further	contributing	to	the	lumpy	nature	of
government	EID	contracts	is	the	fact	that	only	a	relatively	small	number	of	contracts	go	up
for	bid	each	year.	Thus,	due	to	the	long	sales	cycle	and	limited	contracts	up	for	bid,
government	EID	work	tends	to	be	lumpy	on	a	year-to-year	basis.


So	why	should	this	be	concerning	for	an	investor	in	SPCB?	Given	the	low	percentage	of
recurring	revenue	and	lumpy	nature	of	government	EID	contract	work,	there	is	a	good
chance	that	Smart	ID	revenues	will	continue	to	fluctuate	up	or	down	unpredictably	from
year-to-year.	The	majority	of	the	Company's	annual	revenue	is	typically	derived	from	just	a
few	contracts	which	consist	mostly	of	one-time	sales	(70%-80%	non-recurring).	This	has
resulted	in	inconsistent	historical	results	where	SPCB's	pro	forma	revenue	has	swung
from	a	recent	peak	of	$37mm	in	FY	2010	down	to	$19mm	in	FY	2013	and	then	back	up	to
an	estimated	$35mm	in	FY	2014.	As	a	result,	current	consensus	analyst	estimates	for
SPCB	appear	to	be	very	aggressive.	The	growth	in	FY	2014	was	the	result	of	a	couple
large	contracts	which	are	mostly	one-time	in	nature.	As	I	have	just	explained,	consistently
winning	large	contracts	is	a	difficult	proposition	in	the	government	EID	segment.	Thus,	a
significant	decline	in	revenues	from	FY	2014	levels	is	a	strong	possibility	over	the	next
couple	of	years.


On	A	Normalized	Basis,	SuperCom's	Revenue	Is	Actually	Declining

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 6/15


The	lumpiness	in	the	Company's	performance	would	be	more	forgivable	if	total	revenues
were	in	an	overall	uptrend	over	the	past	few	years.	Unfortunately	for	SPCB	shareholders,
this	is	not	the	case.	Over	the	past	four	years,	total	revenues	have	declined	from	a	peak	of
$37mm	in	FY	2010	to	a	trough	of	$19mm	in	FY	2013	and	then	back	up	to	an	estimated
$35mm	in	FY	2014.	Given	the	volatility	in	the	Company's	performance,	I	believe	that	a
more	logical	method	of	measuring	SPCB's	revenue	growth	is	to	take	an	average	of
multiple	years.	When	this	method	of	normalization	is	applied,	the	Company's	recent	top-
line	performance	looks	even	worse.	For	example,	SPCB	averaged	$27mm	of	pro	forma
revenue	from	FY	2011-FY	2012	($28mm	in	FY	2011,	$26mm	in	FY	2012)	and	again
averaged	$27mm	of	pro	forma	revenue	from	FY	2013-FY	2014E	($19mm	in	FY	2013,
$35mm	projected	in	FY	2014).	The	Company's	average	of	$27mm	of	pro	forma	revenue
over	the	past	four	years	(FY	2011-FY	2014E)	represents	a	27%	decline	from	FY	2010	pro
forma	revenue	of	$37mm.	Thus,	on	both	an	actual	and	normalized	basis,	SPCB's	pro
forma	revenue	has	declined	since	FY	2010.


Also	concerning	for	an	investor	in	SPCB	is	the	fact	that	pro	forma	revenue	growth	has
lagged	the	overall	industry	from	FY	2010-FY	2014.	As	I	have	just	illustrated,	SPCB
revenues	have	declined	on	an	actual	and	normalized	basis	since	FY	2010.	By	contrast,
during	that	same	time	period,	the	government	EID	market	has	grown	at	a	rapid	clip.	The
figure	below	shows	the	projected	growth	from	2010-2015	in	the	number	of	countries	with
national	ID	and	national	EID	programs.


As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	the	number	of	countries	with	national	EID	programs	is
projected	to	increase	by	~70%	from	67	in	2010	to	114	in	2015,	with	a	large	majority	of	that
growth	coming	from	2010-2014.	By	contrast,	SPCB's	revenue	has	declined	by	over	27%
from	$37mm	in	FY	2010	to	a	four-year	average	of	$27mm	from	FY	2011-FY	2014E.	This
implies	that	SPCB	has	lost	market	share	to	competitors	over	the	past	four	years.


Global	EID	Industry	Growth	Is	Projected	To	Slow	down	Substantially

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 7/15


The	fact	that	SPCB's	pro	forma	EID	revenue	has	not	increased	over	the	past	four	years
does	not	bode	well	for	the	Company's	future	growth	prospects.	2010-2014	was	a	period	of
rapid	growth	for	the	EID	industry.	Despite	this,	the	Company's	EID	revenue	has,	on
average,	declined	substantially	during	that	same	time	period.	To	make	matters	worse	for
SPCB,	EID	industry	growth	is	expected	to	be	substantially	lower	over	the	next	four	years.
Attached	below	is	a	chart,	provided	by	Acuity	Market	Intelligence,	that	shows	the	projected
growth	in	EID	adoption	from	2013-2018:


Based	on	the	info	provided	in	this	chart,	it	appears	that	the	global	EID	industry	is	now
fairly	mature.	Over	the	next	four	years,	the	number	of	EID	issuing	countries	will	increase
from	~110	countries	in	2014	to	127	countries	in	2018.	In	other	words,	over	the	next	four
years,	only	17	new	countries	will	adopt	EID	programs.	This	represents	a	significant
decline	from	the	over	40	new	countries	that	adopted	EID	programs	from	2010-2014.	The
relatively	mature	nature	of	the	global	EID	industry	is	also	illustrated	by	the	fact	that	global
EID	revenue	is	projected	to	begin	declining	within	the	next	four	years:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 8/15


As	illustrated	above,	from	2014-2018,	global	EID	revenue	is	projected	to	peak	in	2016	and
then	decline	back	to	2014	levels.	Thus,	overall	growth	in	global	EID	revenue	is	projected
to	be	flat	over	the	next	four	years.


Due	to	slowing	industry	growth,	it	will	be	difficult	for	SPCB	to	maintain	revenue	at	FY	2014
levels	unless	the	Company	is	able	to	make	significant	market	share	gains.	Based	on
recent	history,	this	does	not	appear	to	be	all	that	likely.	As	mentioned	earlier,	the	decline	in
SPCB's	revenue	since	FY	2010	indicates	that	the	Company	has	actually	lost	market	share
over	the	past	few	years.	In	addition	to	this,	on	pg.	7	of	SPCB's	September	2014	investor
presentation,	management	states	the	following	about	government	EID	contracts:


"Stable,	sticky	long-term	contracts…	Government	contracts	with	high	switching
costs."


Given	the	high	switching	costs	and	sticky	nature	of	government	relationships,	it	appears
that	SPCB	will	have	difficulty	in	displacing	existing	vendors	in	countries	that	already	have
implemented	a	national	EID	program.	This,	combined	with	SPCB's	loss	of	market	share
over	the	past	few	years,	strongly	indicates	that	meaningful	market	share	gains	for	SPCB
does	not	appear	likely	going	forward.


Recent	Contract	Wins	Are	Likely	Attributable	to	OTIV	Rather	Than	SPCB
Management


Some	investors	in	SPCB	may	believe	that	the	recent	Smart	ID	contract	wins	are	an
indication	that	SPCB	management	is	more	effective	than	OTIV	management	in	growing
this	business.	In	my	opinion,	this	is	a	misguided	conclusion.	SPCB	acquired	the	Smart	ID
business	at	the	end	of	December	2013	which	is	less	than	a	year	ago.	As	mentioned
previously,	the	bid	cycle	for	government	EID	contracts	typically	lasts	between	9	months
and	2	years.	Based	on	these	facts,	the	Company's	recent	$25mm	contract	in	March	2014
(just	3	months	after	the	Smart	ID	acquisition	closing)	is	almost	certainly	due	to	the	efforts
of	OTIV.	In	addition	to	this,	it	is	likely	that	the	$22mm	contract	won	in	August	2014	was
also	due	primarily	to	the	efforts	of	OTIV.	Finally,	the	Company	is	most	likely	benefiting	from
what	appears	to	be	an	unusually	busy	year	in	terms	of	the	number	of	government	EID
contracts	up	for	bid.	This	will	change	next	year	as	Acuity	Market	Intelligence	projects	the
number	of	countries	converting	to	EID	to	decline	from	~15	countries	in	2014	to	~4
countries	in	2015.	Taking	all	of	this	into	account,	there	is	no	concrete	evidence	that
SPCB's	management	has	changed	the	ability	of	the	Smart	ID	business	to	consistently
grow	and	win	contracts	at	an	accelerated	pace.

Also,	it	is	worth	noting	that	the	Company	recently	announced	on	October	13th	that	it	was
starting	implementation	work	for	one	of	its	contracts.	The	stock	price	reacted	positively	to
the	news,	but	I	do	not	feel	this	increase	in	share	price	was	warranted.	This	was	a	contract
that	had	already	been	in	place,	and	as	a	result,	it	does	not	add	to	the	Company's
projected	financial	performance.	It	also	does	not	indicate	that	SPCB	management	has
fundamentally	changed	the	unpredictable	nature	of	the	business.


SPCB	Provides	EID	Services	That	Are	Relatively	Low	in	the	Value	Chain


Through	my	research,	I	also	discovered	that	SPCB	is	not	a	provider	of	cutting	edge	EID
technology	and	services.	Instead,	the	Company	provides	relatively	low	value-added	EID
system	integration	services	in	a	highly	competitive	market.	For	example,	in	OTIV's	August
19th	investor	presentation,	OTIV	described	its	recently	divested	Smart	ID	business	as
follows:


"SmartID:	highly	competitive	&	commoditized	business	that	focused	on	system
integration."


On	its	corporate	website,	SPCB	summarizes	their	EID	services	as	follows:


"SuperCom	∑ID™	(Sigma-ID)	Division	is	a	System	House	and	a	System	Integrator
active	in	the	National	ID	and	e-Government	industry,	for	more	than	25	years."


Basically,	SPCB	does	not	create	the	key	technologies	that	go	into	an	EID	system.	Instead,
the	Company	is	responsible	for	integrating	technology	and	software	into	a	unified	EID
system.	As	mentioned	by	OTIV,	this	is	a	commoditized	service	offering	that	is	relatively
low	in	the	EID	value	chain.	In	addition	to	the	commoditized	nature	of	SPCB's	EID	services,
the	EID	industry	is	highly	fragmented	and	competitive	with	many	players	including	Zetes,
L1	Identity	Solutions,	Gemalto	and	Oberthur.


No	Turnaround	in	Sight	for	the	RFID	Division


Some	investors	believe	that	growth	in	the	Company's	RFID	business	will	accelerate	in	the
near	future.	However,	it	does	not	appear	that	this	is	likely.	SPCB's	RFID	business	has
struggled	to	win	a	meaningful	amount	of	new	business	for	several	years.	In	FY	2008,	the
RFID	segment	generated	almost	$20mm	of	revenue	for	the	Company.	Since	then,	the
Company	has	lost	almost	all	of	its	market	share	in	the	RFID	space	to	competitors.	In	fact,
last	year	(FY	2013)	the	RFID	business	contributed	less	than	$1mm	in	revenue	to	SPCB.
In	addition	to	this,	the	Company	has	invested	a	combined	total	of	just	$1.7mm	in	R&D

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 10/15


over	the	past	four	years	(FY	2010-FY	2013).	Given	the	Company's	weak	competitive
position	and	very	low	level	of	R&D	investments,	it	is	likely	that	SPCB's	RFID	division	will
remain	an	insignificant	part	of	the	business	for	the	foreseeable	future.	Thus,	investors
hoping	for	a	major	turnaround	in	the	RFID	business	will	likely	be	disappointed.


SPCB	Shares	Are	Substantially	Overvalued	at	Current	Share	Price	Levels


Over	the	next	couple	years,	I	believe	that	SPCB's	revenue	will	decline	by	a	meaningful
amount	from	FY	2014	levels.	I	am	bearish	on	the	Company's	business	prospects	for
reasons	which	have	been	discussed	in	this	article:


1.	Government	EID	work	is	non-recurring	and	lumpy	by	nature.
2.	In	FY	2014,	the	Company	appears	to	be	benefiting	from	an	unusually	strong	year	in
terms	of	EID	adoption.	Going	forward,	global	EID	adoption	rate	and	revenue	growth
are	expected	to	decline	substantially.


3.	The	Company	provides	commoditized	EID	system	integration	services	and	appears	to
have	lost	market	share	to	competitors	over	the	past	four	years.


4.	A	turnaround	in	the	RFID	division	is	not	likely	given	SPCB's	weak	competitive	position
and	minimal	amount	of	R&D	investments.


Going	forward,	I	would	expect	SPCB's	annual	revenue	to	decline	and	trend	closer	towards
its	recent	historical	average	of	$27mm.	In	fact,	due	to	the	projected	slowdown	in	EID
adoption	over	the	next	four	years,	it	would	not	surprise	me	if	the	Company's	average
annual	revenue	declined	to	below	$27mm.	Thus,	it	does	not	make	sense	to	value	SPCB
based	off	of	FY	2014	results	since	FY	2014	likely	represents	a	"peak	year"	in	terms	of
revenue.	Similarly,	it	does	not	make	sense	to	use	FY	2013	results	to	value	SPCB	since
this	year	represents	a	"trough	year"	in	terms	of	revenue.	Instead,	it	makes	more	sense	to
base	the	Company's	valuation	off	of	its	recent	four-year	historical	average	(FY	2010-FY
2014E)	of	$27mm	in	annual	revenue.	Using	$27mm	in	total	revenue	as	a	baseline,	I
calculated	SPCB's	implied	fully	diluted	earnings	in	the	income	statement	provided	below:
7/18/2019 SuperCom: Overvalued By Almost 60% - SuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ:SPCB) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 11/15


Assuming	$27mm	in	revenue,	SPCB	should	report	around	$0.35	of	fully	diluted	EPS.	I
have	assumed	a	gross	margin	of	70.0%	which	is	conservative	and	represents	a	premium
to	the	Company's	historical	pro	forma	gross	margin	(68.9%	in	FY	2012)	provided	in
SPCB's	12/9/2013	F-1	filing.	Projected	gross	margin	of	70%	appears	low	compared	to
SPCB's	actual	gross	margin	of	78%	in	the	first	half	of	FY	2014.	However,	management
stated	that	gross	margin	in	the	first	half	of	the	year	was	inflated	due	to	a	high	proportion	of
revenue	coming	from	follow-on	work	which	carries	much	higher	margins	than	initial
implementation	work.	Total	operating	expense	of	$12.2mm	was	calculated	by	annualizing
SPCB's	operating	expenses	of	$6.1mm	in	the	first	half	of	FY	2014.	Finally,	I	have
assumed	a	tax	rate	of	25%	which	is	in-line	with	the	corporate	tax	rate	in	Israel.


Unfortunately,	given	SPCB's	niche	EID	service	offerings,	there	is	no	direct	public
comparable	for	their	business.	That	being	said,	I	believe	SPCB	should	trade	at	a
meaningful	discount	to	the	average	S&P	500	company.	I	believe	that	a	meaningful
valuation	discount	is	warranted	for	a	number	of	reasons.	First,	SPCB	is	a	small	EID	player
providing	a	commoditized	service	in	a	highly	competitive	segment.	In	addition	to	this,	the
decline	in	SPCB's	pro	forma	revenue	over	the	past	four	years	is	an	indication	that	the
Company	is	losing	share	to	competitors.	Also,	given	the	volatility	in	the	Company's
performance	and	the	projected	slowdown	in	EID	industry	growth,	SPCB	will	most	likely
continue	have	a	difficult	time	growing	its	business	going	forward.	Thus,	I	believe	that
applying	a	valuation	discount	of	25%-50%	for	SPCB	relative	to	the	S&P	500	average	is
reasonable.


Currently,	the	average	TTM	PE	multiple	for	S&P	500	companies	is	around	18x.	Assuming
a	25%-50%	discount	to	the	S&P	500	average,	SPCB	should	trade	at	a	PE	multiple
between	9x-13.5x.	Applying	a	9x-13.5x	multiple	to	$0.35	of	fully	diluted	EPS	results	in	an
implied	share	price	of	$3.19-$4.78.	The	Company	also	has	approximately	$50mm	of

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2608465-supercom-overvalued-by-almost-60-percent 12/15


NOLs	that	can	be	used	to	offset	future	pre-tax	gains.	I	expect	SPCB	will	generate	around
$6.5mm	of	pretax	income	per	year.	Based	on	this	assumption	and	a	10%	discount	rate,	I
calculated	the	implied	value	of	the	Company's	NOLs	below:


As	illustrated	above,	I	have	estimated	the	per	share	value	of	SPCB's	NOLs	to	be	around
$0.63.	After	including	the	value	of	the	NOLs,	SPCB's	implied	per	share	price	(based	on	a
9x-13.5x	multiple)	is	$3.81-$5.40.	This	represents	a	59%-71%	discount	to	the	current
share	price	of	$13.29.	Thus,	SPCB	shares	appear	to	be	grossly	overvalued	at	the	current
share	price.


Conclusion


In	summary,	I	believe	that	the	recent	growth	in	SPCB's	business	is	unsustainable.	The
Company's	FY	2014	results	appear	to	have	been	temporarily	boosted	by	what	has	been
an	unusually	strong	year	for	EID	adoption.	It	will	be	difficult	for	SPCB	to	repeat	their	FY
2014	results	as	the	rate	of	EID	adoption	is	projected	to	slowdown	dramatically	from	FY
2014	levels.	In	addition	to	industry	growth	headwinds,	SPCB	provides	commoditized	EID
services	and	has	been	losing	market	share	to	competitors	over	the	past	four	years.	Based
on	what	I	feel	are	reasonable	valuation	assumptions,	SPCB	is	overvalued	by	as	much	as
70%	at	the	current	share	price.	Thus,	I	would	recommend	initiating	a	short	position	in
SPCB	or	selling	shares	if	you	are	a	current	SPCB	shareholder.

Have	you	spoken	to	anyone	at	the	company?	I	have	multiple	times,	and	from	your	factually	incorrect	article,	I	would
guess	that	you	haven't.	I	don't	even	know	where	to	start,	as	nearly	every	claim	you	make	is	incorrect.


Contrary	to	your	claims,	the	bulk	of	the	revenue	for	most	contracts	comes	in	future	years	as	recurring	revenue.	This	is
common	sense	--	will	your	drivers	license,	social	security	card,	passport,	etc.	be	good	10	years	from	now?	In	fact,	will
the	equipment	used	to	make	these	items,	and	even	the	technology,	still	be	current?	Of	course	not.


You	claim	that	the	business	is	competitive	and	commoditized,	but	SuperCom	has	had	many	of	its	customers	for	more
than	10	years,	and	one	for	more	than	19	years.	In	fact	it's	very	sticky,	high	margin,	and	results	in	new	business	over
time	as	SuperCom	has	been	approached	to	handle	new	forms	of	IDs	from	previous	business.	It's	exactly	the	opposite
of	commoditized	as	countries	are	incentivized	to	stay	with	the	company	in	order	to	have	backwards	compatibility	with
existing	systems.	It's	a	very	small	cost	for	the	countries	involved	and	in	fact	a	revenue	MAKER	as	they	charge	more
for	the	IDs	than	it	costs,	so	the	customers	prefer	to	stick	with	suppliers	that	have	shown	themselves	to	be	reliable	and
secure.	It's	a	captive	market.


Your	claim	that	the	eID	market	is	shrinking	and	that	4	countries	will	convert	to	eIDs	in	2015	is	complete	nonsense.
SuperCom's	pipeline	is	on	the	order	of	a	couple	of	bids	_per	month_,	and	that's	just	the	work	they	choose	to	bid	on.
As	SuperCom's	revenue	grows,	so	too	does	its	universe	of	possible	customers,	as	larger	countries	only	deal	with
larger	companies.


You	seem	dismissive	of	the	RFID	initiative.	Yes,	it's	new	and	small,	but	there	are	pilot	programs	with	prisoner	tracking
in	US	counties	with	extremely	high	margin.	There	are	pilot	programs	with	a	major	US	company	for	luggage	tracking.
Then	there's	the	mobile	payment	programs,	initiated	by	customer	request	in	Africa,	that	may	results	in	huge	future
revenue	at	minimal	cost	to	SuperCom.	A	success	in	any	of	these	three	areas	would	make	a	material	difference	to
SuperCom's	bottom	line.


"In	my	opinion,	this	is	a	misguided	conclusion.	SPCB	acquired	the	Smart	ID	business	at	the	end	of	December	2013
which	is	less	than	a	year	ago.	As	mentioned	previously,	the	bid	cycle	for	government	EID	contracts	typically	lasts
between	9	months	and	2	years.	Based	on	these	facts,	the	Company's	recent	$25mm	contract	in	March	2014	(just	3
months	after	the	Smart	ID	acquisition	closing)	is	almost	certainly	due	to	the	efforts	of	OTIV.	In	addition	to	this,	it	is
likely	that	the	$22mm	contract	won	in	August	2014	was	also	due	primarily	to	the	efforts	of	OTIV."	--	False.	Both
companies	have	pipelines	of	bids,	typically	a	couple	per	month	(combined),	coming	due	each	month.	It's	irrelevant
how	long	ago	they	were	put	in,	whether	it	was	9	months	or	9	years,	because	they	are	coming	due	regularly,	and
likewise,	new	ones	are	regularly	being	submitted.	If	you	want	to	know	if	a	particular	bid	is	from	OTI's	SmartID	then	you
can	ask	SuperCom	or	check	their	filings,	because	SuperCom	will	owe	payouts	to	OTI	based	upon	contract	wins.


I	could	go	on,	but	I've	already	written	my	opinion	in	a	previous	article.	The	short	story	is	that	the	author	has	not	done
any	due	diligence	on	the	company	at	all.

You	are	clearly	mistaking	a	recurring	customer	for	recurring	revenue.	If	you	look	at	OTIV's	20-F,	you	will	see
that	Smart	ID	/	EID	revenue	from	their	customers	has	fallen	off	dramatically	following	the	initial	deployment.
For	example,	Ecuador	account	for	$28mm	of	revenue	in	FY	2010,	then	$8.2mm	in	FY	2011,	then	$4.8mm	in

JOIN	THE	CONVERSATION


FY	2012,	to	an	even	lower	amount	today.	If	60	-	80%	of	their	business	is	recurring,	why	does	revenue	from
one	customer	fall	by	over	80%	within	the	span	of	two	years?


There	are	more	examples	that	can	be	found	in	OTIV's	filings.	Tanzania	revenues	fell	from	$7.2mm	in	FY	2011,
to	$4.8mm	in	FY	2012,	to	~$3mm	in	FY	2014.	Again,	if	revenues	were	truly	60%	-	80%	recurring,	why	has	the
amount	of	revenue	from	one	customer	declined	by	almost	60%	within	3	years?


Also,	I	am	just	not	cherry	picking	certain	customers.	The	Smart	ID	business	has	generated	over	95%	of	its
revenue	from	3	main	customers:	Ecuador,	Tanzania	and	Panama.	So,	basically	the	Smart	ID	business	has
seen	2	of	their	3	main	sources	of	business	drop	in	annual	revenues	by	an	average	of	over	70%	within	2	years
of	the	initial	deployment.	Again,	I	ask	how	is	it	possible	then	that	60%	-	80%	of	their	revenue	is	recurring	on	an
annual	basis?


This	is	not	a	cable	company	or	Saas-based	subscription	business	where	you	charge	a	consistent	fee	monthly
/	quarterly	/	annually.	A	cable	company	or	Saas-based	software	company	can	depend	on	a	consistent	level	of
recurring	revenue	each	year	from	each	customer.	Hence,	their	revenue	does	not	fluctuate	to	the	downside	by
extreme	amounts	from	a	year-to-year	basis.	Recurring	revenue	for	Supercom	on	the	other	hand	is	from
follow-on	contracts	which,	as	shown	by	Ecuador	and	Tanzania,	tend	to	decline	by	a	large	amount	following	the
initial	deployment.	The	historical	numbers	for	Supercom's	pro	forma	revenues	tell	the	entire	story.	Revenues
fell	from	$37mm	in	FY	2010	to	$19mm	in	FY	2013.


Also,	the	EID	industry	is	maturing.	The	Company	is	dependent	on	getting	new	customers	through
governments	converting	to	EID.	As	actual	industry	data	shows,	FY	2014	saw	~15	governments	convert	to
EID.	Over	the	next	four	years,	a	COMBINED	TOTAL	of	just	17	government	conversions	to	EID	is	projected.


I	have	done	my	research,	so	please	stop	accusing	me	of	making	factually	incorrect	statements.....
