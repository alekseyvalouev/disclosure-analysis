Why I'm Writing So Many Articles About Lumber Liquidators
Apr. 10, 2015 8:27 AM ET87 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


This is the 12th article I've written about Lumber Liquidators since the "60 Minutes"
story about the company aired on March 1.


I am not writing to influence the stock price, as I don't care where it trades in the
near term.


My long-term view of the company leads me to believe the stock has at least 50%
downside.


There are 7 reasons I've written - and will continue to write - so many articles.


These reasons far outweigh the many downsides.


This is the 12th article I've written about Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) (you can
download a pdf of the prior ones here) since the 60 Minutes story about the company
aired on March 1st - and third one this week - which led one of my readers to email me:


You are seriously moving the stock in the opposite direction you want to be moving it
every single time you post.


You can't honestly think you're winning over any converts at this point. It's working
out in LL's favor - their argument is that short sellers did this to them (which we know
is absurd), but it gains credibility in the public's eye when the most visible and vocal
short seller keeps making his case by publishing several articles a week.


I think it's time to give it a rest and just let it implode on its own.


The Q1 results will be abysmal (increased ad spending and the brutal margin) and
will show that they can't be a viable business going forward. Also, the disclosures
relating to investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits will be the headlines.


Just my two cents.


Here is the reply I sent him:

I don't believe my articles have any impact on the stock in the short term, either positively
or negatively - but even if you showed me stock charts demonstrating that the stock
jumped when I published a new article, I wouldn't care. It makes no difference to me if the
stock trades at $45 or $25 in the near term because this isn't a trade for me. I've been
short the stock for 18 months and would be surprised if I'm not short it for quite a while
longer. I have a long-term view of the company what mirrors yours - and if we're right, then
I'm confident that the stock will fall at least 50% from here.


So why write so many articles? There are many reasons:


1) I'm outraged by what I think Lumber Liquidators is doing. Every day, they are selling
what I believe to be a very dangerous product to thousands of unsuspecting (or overly
trusting) American families, likely causing significant adverse health effects in many of
them, especially among children, as I documented in yesterday's article, Lumber
Liquidators, Formaldehyde And Asbestos. I believe this is truly evil. Until they stop - or
until someone (likely a regulator) convinces me that the product is, in fact, safe - I will not
let up one bit.


2) While I don't think any one article is "winning over any converts," I do think that all of the
articles I've written since the 60 Minutes story aired are a valuable resource and road map
for anyone interested in this company: regulators, politicians, reporters, investors,
consumers, etc. For both selfish and selfless reasons, I want as many people to know the
truth (as I understand it) about this company - what it's done and, worse yet, is still doing.


3) I had no plans to write so many articles, but every day I see more bad analysis, faulty
assumptions and unsupported assertions, and I feel compelled to respond - in part on
principle and in part because some of it is directly or indirectly saying that my facts and
analyses are wrong.


4) I find it to be incredibly intellectually stimulating to dive deeply into a particular company
and industry, and it helps me clarify my thinking to put my facts, analyses and conclusions
in writing.


5) Making my work public means it becomes subject to scrutiny, which is healthy - if I've
made a mistake, I want to know about it!


6) I'm a one-person operation - I don't even have one analyst to go into the field and do
research for me, so I rely on people who read my articles to contact me and share
information - people like Lumber Liquidators' employees and former employees, installers,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3061356-why-im-writing-so-many-articles-about-lumber-liquidators 3/20


customers, competitors, other industry players, etc. Every article I publish leads to a few
more people contacting me with valuable insights and information.


7) Every day I'm learning new things. Last week, for example, I had a very illuminating 90-
minute conversation with Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the world's leading experts on
exposure to toxic chemicals, who was interviewed by 60 Minutes. Given how many people
are interested in this company/stock/debate (and having long ago decided to be very
public regarding this investment), I feel like it would be selfish to keep this information to
myself.


I take very seriously the fact that I have taken actions that have contributed to a huge
disruption and untold expenses for Lumber Liquidators, severe losses for investors long
the stock, and significant effort and expense on the part of numerous regulators. In light of
this, I figure the least I can do is openly share what I'm learning - and not only the bad
stuff. For example, it doesn't help my short thesis to share (as I did in yesterday's article)
what Dr. Landrigan said about the formaldehyde levels in Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-
made laminate being very unlikely to cause cancer, and probably off-gassing down to safe
levels within 3-6 months.


Conclusion


There are many downsides, of course, to writing so frequently: it takes time, I have to put
up with the inevitable slings and arrows, maybe my reader is right that some people think
I'm piling on and thus view the company more sympathetically, and it increases the risk
that the company sues me (which would be a pain, but I've dealt with this kind of
harassment before - and I would gladly trade discovery against me in exchange for
discovery against them, as I have nothing to hideâ€¦ but I'm quite certain that they do).


But net net, the upsides far outweigh the downsides, so I continue to write.


I hope someday to exhaust the topics about which to write, but I see little sign of that right
now, as I'm almost finished with another article that I will publish shortly.


PS - I no longer read the message boards for the articles I publish. I do, however, want to
hear thoughtful comments and questions so I invite my readers to communicate with me
via Seeking Alpha messaging and I will post my answers on the message board.

shorts will not slow down this great American company.

I wonder if he thinks driving a car is "EVIL"?... or coal burning power plants are "EVIL"?... or fracking up the

If government standards for pollutants are exceeded, just penalize the company until they get it right. Just
leave Lumber Liquidators alone and the problem will find a solution.

You are sounding more loony every day, Its getting to the point where it doesn't even matter what you say, its just the
ravings of someone who has already lost and sounds no different than the babblings of a skitzophrenic. When you
tried to spin the CSPC's decision to not use deconstructive testing as a positive for you, you lost. then when you said
you were done writing and moving, and then resumed your rantings, you lost all credibility.


The financial damage you single handedly are responsible for, is exponentially greater than any damage ever caused
by a single square inch of this flooring that soaks our puppies and babies. You have done quite enough.


I think its time for you to take a Valium and have someone drive you to your local mental ward for evaluation. I'm
worried that in addition to the thousands you've already hurt you might hurt yourself.

Wow, this comment looks very, very bad in retrospect. Looking foolish for being wrong about a stock is one
thing (every investor who puts himself out there will multiple times at some point), but attacking the author in

Couldn't agree more. Mr. Tilson has a clear agenda and, as his predictions of doom for LL have become less
certain, he has become more desperate in his efforts to negatively effect LL's share price. He should, as you
suggest, be barred from posting articles on SA until this matter is settled by more objective investigators.

People willingly choose to consume tobacco products knowing full well the health implications...not at all the
same scenario.


10 Apr 2015, 08:08 PM


well
you have a point there, there are a lot of substances being sold around that are questionable- however with
good lawyers its easy to bend the rules. As for tobacco, sure, but the tobacco sellers clearly tell you the
product is harmful but people still smoke. LL did not label their products properly. Lets use their auto analogy-
they compare it to the exhaust converter off a car- the real question is why is the car exhausting so much in
the first place? when other cars arent 
sure the product is sealed and all and it isn't so airborne - seals that wear out  
management continue to sell this when they could come out with formal free product and address the issue

"PS - I no longer read the message boards for the articles I publish."


Another lie.


You continue to respond to the comments below section in your last two articles publicly on SA. However, you cherry
pick which comments to respond to.


I'd simply like to know why are you ignoring the financial services firm Raymond James's testing of Lumber
Liquidator's laminate flooring where their testing said the laminate was well below CARB limits.


Raymond James doesn't care if they go long, short, neutral, or avoid LL stock for their clients. Instead, they raised
their rating and price target for LL after doing their own independent laminate testing on behalf of their clients.


Are you saying their goal is to lose their clients money? That doesn't seem logical does it?


It's almost as logical as linking a compliance officer guy to the security of the Oscars to a breach of responsibility to
Lumber Liquidators?

Understand the difference between desperation and effectiveness.


Understand the difference between research and stalking (in regards to Ray Cotton).


Lumber Liquidators is your white whale Captain Ahab.


When the CPSC clears them, I can only imagine what personal destructive mode you transform into from where you
are today. Oh god...I predict the articles from you at that time will indeed be very, very disturbing and scary.

There is cancer causing benzene in gasoline. Now if I were going to test the safety of an automobile for the harmful
effects on my children and pets, would I rip the car apart to get to the gasoline and test it that way? (deconstructive)


Because then, it would be considered an evil cancer causing car.


Or...would I test it how the vehicle is used in the real world? Are fumes escaping from the gasoline tank? If so, at what
rate per hour into the vehicle I'm driving? And is THAT rate of off-gassing of benzene cancer causing? or is it
acceptable for the health of babies and puppies?


If a plank of laminate is wrapped in a coating that prevents fumes from the "gasoline" to escape at an unhealthy level
per hour, why would I care about it? Why would anyone?


The CPSC doesn't. They want to test the laminate in real world conditions. The reader/homeowner should trust your
ramblings over the CPSC's? I think not.

David - not really the way it works. Formaldehyde and other indoor air pollutants build up inside houses,
especially the more energy efficient they are. Cigarette smoke is a good example - smoking outdoors is OK
(except for the smoker) because the smoke disperses. Indoors, well, other people living in the house have a
significantly higher risk of cancer.


Formaldehyde monitoring of consumer products is mainly useful to get an understanding of excess
formaldehyde that will be released over the lifetime of a product, and at what rate. Excess formaldehyde
indicates that the polymer was not cured properly, and will release excess formaldehyde over its lifetime. (As
a related issue, it probably also indicates that the flooring product is substandard and may delaminate.)

So what you're saying is, if these independent 3rd party lab 10,000 home tests come back almost all
negative, then it would be the largest real world study ever performed on formaldehyde emissions, and it
would prove there is no toxic buildup in homes. Correct?


Lumber Liquidators is playing this extremely smart. 10,000 people have their home tested for indoor air
exposure from a 3rd party. When almost all tests come back below CARB limits, guess who is going to use
that data in front of the court, CARB, CPSC, EPA, and OSHA?

Lumber Liquidators is.


And that will be a LOT of unbiased data. It accounts for energy efficient homes and non energy efficient
homes.


It's a brilliant move, and I can not wait for Lumber Liquidators to release it's findings from this data. They could
release that data with the quarterly results.


LL stock will soar so fast, it will make our heads spin. Because you better believe that all these agencies do
not have 10,000 real world data points.


Is aspirin good for your heart? It makes a difference if you are comparing data from10 subjects, 100 subjects,
1000 subjects, 10000 subjects. The more data, the better accuracy.

A couple of points:


"if these independent 3rd party lab 10,000 home tests come back almost all negative, then it would be the
largest real world study ever performed on formaldehyde emissions, and it would prove there is no toxic
buildup in homes. Correct?"


What constitutes negative in micrograms per cubic meter of formaldehyde? You also need to consider that
temperature and humidity affect the amount of formaldehyde emitted from MDF/HDF. This combined with the
ventilation rate will affect the amount of formaldehyde detected. Therefore, the results are not totally
conclusive on an individual basis.


"Lumber Liquidators is playing this extremely smart. 10,000 people have their home tested for indoor air
exposure from a 3rd party. When almost all tests come back below CARB limits, guess who is going to use
that data in front of the court, CARB, CPSC, EPA, and OSHA?"


The fact is probably almost none of the tests are going to test below the 9 mcg/mÂ³ of formaldehyde
established by CARB as acceptable for continuous long-term exposure. Using that as a point of reference,
the failure rate is likely to be +95%.


Also the molecular weight of formaldehyde is heavier than air. Therefore, the test result depends upon what
height the sample gathering is occurring at. Closer to the floor you will get a higher reading. So babies and
pets are going to get a higher rate of formaldehyde exposure from the MDF in the floorboards.

I can only think of, at this point, Mr. Tilson is going for the sympathy votes: by continuing writing these content less
articles, he deliberately incites negative attacks and aims to get the more silent public to side with him.


Either that or the too much formaldehyde for himself theory.

To everyone wondering why articles are posted which provide no new information the answer lies in the mirror.


If you are leaving a comment you clicked on the article and are viewing an ad for an ETF which is following whatever
currency or market is surging at the moment.


While SA could provide more editorial control over the content provided the real controller of content is the readers
who click and view these articles.


Perhaps a solution could be to put an 'ignore' button next to all contributors so if a reader determines that the
contributor is abusing his privilege to publish he can opt out of being prompted with any of the articles from said
author.


It would also be useful in tuning out anyone who disagrees with your viewpoint thereby allowing one to craft the
perfect echo chamber for their investment decisions.

Don't agree.


Tilson should be allowed to publish any drivel he likes 
Why protect him from himself? He does not need it.  
It is highly informative to discover what sort of a man he is 
And highly entertaining to hear him say he is doing this for the public good. 
Wonderful stuff. Putinesque really.


 
If you have money with him you will be interested. And if you are considering - this information is valuable.


As is mostly true, the comments are the best part of the article. My own practice is to skip the article and go
straight to comments. Especially with someone of Tilson's ilk.

It is TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE for the alleged editors at SA to permit you, Mr. Tilson, to publish an article every day
on LL. Give it a rest.

By now you must be seeing some of the writing on the wall, right?


And as far as the decrease in sales, the tightening of margins, and the "sales" on the websites, well that is your doing
isnt it? I mean you caused the media mess and the brand damage, and now your thesis is completely busted thanks
to the CPSC.


Investors will give LL a break my friend, the stock will not get punished for a bad qtr or two, due to your antics. But
when this all does die down, because it most certainly will, you will most likely get your forehead polished to a mirror
finish as the stock catapults over 50, 60 and then 70.

thesis. I was interested in this idea a few weeks ago, but now I've read so much back and forth from shorts,
longs, its clear everyone has an agenda and I wouldn't know who to believe. Bottom line, is I'm on the

Mr. Tilson please explain why the tests are not showing drenched toxic floors. LL has provided thousands of test kits.
Pretty good way of testing?

From Tilson's letter to investors dated April 2:


"Our fund gained 0.5% in March vs. -1.6% for the S&P 500. Year to date, our fund is off to a good start, up 2.5% vs.
1.0% for the S&P 500. (Note that I 
am now reporting our fundâ€™s 
net returns, reflecting the 20% performance allocation, as most 
investors, Iâ€™m pleased to 
say, are now above their high-water mark, meaning that we have recouped for you the losses of 2011 and 2012."


Pretty awesome: investors finally seeing green afterâ€¦ahhhâ€¦4 years.

According to Whitney Tilson, buying beat-down cheap/value stocks is good, unless he disagrees, in which
case you are evil (and a troll spreading idiocy and causing him agita, according to some of his deleted
comments).


He also firmly believes and insists that he's right, because he went to Harvard, and if you went to any other
school, you are a clown.

Well I just finished laying two bedroom floors by myself using the bamboo flooring from LL. Looks nice, no asbestos,

Some hedge funds are like gangsters in the 'hood. These guys are always trying to build Street cred and get respect
from their peers, no matter what it takes. For them, nothing gets more respect than killing a company. These guys
should get a teardrop tattoo under their eyes when they kill a company. Using overblown scare tactics to kill Lumber
Liquidators is like a punk doing a drive-by shooting with a BB gun from a beat up Corolla.

Oops! Did you notice the author's reasons for writing so many LL stories? What a considerate fellow! Would he be

Maybe he should enter politics. Our country once was a place where the norm was to 'live and let live'. Some in the

About 7 lines below the end of the "article" you can report a problem with the article. I am not sure how that works, but

The reason Mr. Tilson is writing so many (non)articles is to maintain a continuous negative spin on LL. It's quite
simple. He knows his "articles" get picked up elsewhere (why? I have NO idea.)


While we await the testing results, Mr. Tilson continues to author his manifestos thereby becoming the news (when
there's no news!). It's so odd.

While Tilson tries his best to denigrate LL and its management he is making it very clear that he is not a Â¨serious
personÂ¨. Anyone reading these articles and doing a bit of background research, as he suggests we all do, will come
away with that conclusion. What serious person would do all this? I actually thought the last article was a joke written
by someone else but then I realized it was written by Tilson and it appears to be real.


It is bizarre and disturbing how much time and energy he is spending on this highly unethical campaign all the while
twisting logic to convince himself he is doing everything right. Most top quality investors draw a majority of praise and
admiration. Tilson draws the exact opposite. Current and potential investors should take note.


11 Apr 2015, 09:29 PM


well
i completely understand why tilson dosnt read comments on here. the bottom line here is LL engineered a false truth
which many on here believe to be true 
leaving many mis-informed- until the 6 months investigation completes 
many on here , including consumers, analysts do not have the proper background to understand the issue. the
product is drenched in toxic chemicals 10 times the normal level confirmed which will always be there, it dosnt matter
how well it is sealed or not, seals arent perfect, the product will eventually leech.the layer of plastic will not be enough
to hold it those fumes.. this is not stuff i would ever want in my home, and anyone that does is ignorant.. 60 minutes to
me is a pretty credible source who would not spread false rumors


this will take a time, and everyone is in hold mode pending more news,but once the proper testing is concluded and
the truth comes out, with all the lawsuits piled up, rev will take a huge hit for a stock thats already over x12 PE,+
horribly managed business- things will not be pretty


tilson really dosnt have to write anymore articles he is right on the money and doing everyone a favour. he is not the
bad guy here LL is

Sorry but you are wrong. When the top layer of the flooring gets so badly worn the consumer must replace
the floor. Laminate is not like regular wood floors since it cannot be sanded down and refinished. Once the
top layer is gone or broken by a puncture the floors need to be replaced. Therefore, there is never really a
case where a laminate flooring's chemically treated insides are exposed to the consumer like you think. 
As an example, the fiberglass insulation in your house is dangerous to breathe, however it is encapsulated by

the sheet rock in your home, right? Imagine a consumer putting holes in the sheet rock and not replacing it,
then letting fiberglass particles float through their home for their baby to breath. This would be the
homeowners fault for not maintaining the sheet rock, not the fiberglass company. Yes the comparison is the
same


13 Apr 2015, 10:25 AM


well
let the CSPC do its job and provide real facts on this issue


When the top layer of the flooring gets so badly worn the consumer must replace the floor. this is not true- this
leeching out happens over time slowly through edges, etc - i am doubtful those fumes can be completely
contained by a plastic layer - especially with the amounts contained in LL products 
and even so how often do folks replace flooring?  
i can't compare it to fiberglass insulation which has low VOC and is behind a rock wall VS something you are
exposed to frequently like flooring


14 Apr 2015, 11:08 AM


Clayton Rulli, Contributor
whats in the core is adequately encapsulated, making the deconstructive method inaccurate to evaluate real
life scenario of release. What you say might be true about the edges, but too bad 60 minutes didnt test it that
way

Yea, seems like a pathetic/sleazy attempt to profit on the short side....almost like he in a sick way is rooting for harm
so that he can profit.. Who's evil? Anyway, I have no position in LL at the moment but if we are all being honest here I
think we could all agree that LL is in a sticky situation and it definitely is having a negative impact on their share price
but more importantly on their reputation. That said, logic and my gut tell me that this issue has been overblown and
the stock has been hammered beyond the point of where it deserved. The markets will eventually figure out where the
share price needs to be and I'm willing to bet it is substantially higher than where it is right now

reemax. the floors are safe if used properly and maintained/replaced as needed. OSHA's permitted levels of
formaldahyde say so, but if you want to make your own opinion then go ahead. Likewise, If you decide to go
head and put some BBQ sauce on the floor and eat it for dinner, or let your baby use it as a pacifier, then
that's also your choice

Interesting how what is old becomes new again. Formaldehyde was a problem in the 1990's .


Our family encountered the Formaldehyde problem after we bought a house in the 90's. Owners had worked on the
basement of the house to make it into a recreation room as families often do in America. The space was not useable.


Gradually, I did the personal research needed and had the toxic materials removed. That space became beautiful and
useable but added unseen cost for our family. So, buyer beware.
