The Drug Carry Trade: Valeant's Massively Leveraged Long-Short
Strategy Is About To Unwind
Sep. 28, 2015 11:26 AM ET170 comments
by: Xuhua Zhou


Summary


Despite confusing accounting metrics, Valeant is really a drug hedge fund.


Put in the spotlight, Michael Pearson, the godfather of drug price gouging, will have
to drop prices for the sake of basic human decency.


Pearson's riskless arbitrage of return on drug assets and VRX's cost of capital
wrecks havoc in the whole sector. Boom and bust will hurt innovation.


Public scrutiny on drug prices pressures asset returns, squeezes spreads.


Drop in Valeant's stock price and jump in bond yield will induce a death spiral.


Over the years, investors have likened Valeant (NYSE: VRX) to many things. Famed
short-seller Chanos called it a blackbox; prominent hedge fund manager Bill Ackman
called it the Berkshire Hathaway of biotech. But let's not kid ourselves. Charlie Munger
likened Valeant to a worse version of ITT and Howard Geneen. Meanwhile, Valeant is not
quite as mysterious as the fuzzy complex accounting methods would suggest. To truly
understand Valeant, investors need to look beyond the complex accounting or cash
earnings and zone in on the true economics of the business. Valeant is not a
pharmaceutical company; it is a $100 billion drug hedge fund with portfolio manager
Michael Pearson at the helm. Now let's redefine Valeant.


Business Description in My Opinion


Valeant acts like an offshore hedge fund, incorporated under the laws of the Province of
British Columbia. Its principal strategy consists of acquiring portfolios of drugs at attractive
prices while funding it with its advantageous balance sheet at a low cost of capital.
Subsequent economic value is realized by taking advantage of our pricing power in such
acquired drug portfolios and realize superior returns relative to our blended cost of capital.
In other words, Valeant primarily specializes in what is commonly known as a carry trade
arbitrage by exploiting the differential between our own blended cost of capital and
our anticipated drug price inflation. Portfolio manager Michael Pearson has over 23
years of experience consulting with major pharmaceutical companies such as Merck

(NYSE:MRK) and Teva (NYSE:TEVA), identifying drug products that command pricing
power in the marketplace. We believe certain drug portfolios embedded within the existing
healthcare companies are significantly undervalued due to their low prices.


What is Valeant?


Valeant's business strategy has been polarizing. The world's best investors have split
views on the prospects of the company. It isn't hard to see why. Valeant has long been
billed as an atypical pharmaceutical company with its repeatedly stated strategy of cutting
R&D investments. The value creation process at Valeant has always seemed like a bit of a
myth. While Valeant invests an inconsequential percentage of capital in R&D, it somehow
manages to acquire a number of drug companies at often significant premiums to market
yet still builds staggering equity value in the process. Efficient market hypothesis would
suggest that public investors have efficiently weighed the risk and prospect of every
company Valeant has acquired and in the said process have already assigned a fair price
to those companies. While it might be possible to generate some abnormal returns
through intelligence, large-scale arbitrage is generally considered to be hard, if not next to
impossible. That makes Valeant's success even more curious as the company pays a
price often far above what the public market prices would dictate. In the case of its latest
acquisition, it paid over 48% premium to acquire Salix (NASDAQ:SLXP). Despite such
massive premium, Valeant's current enterprise value is a staggering $75 billion higher
than the sum of its total acquisition costs. How is this possible?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3536686-drug-carry-trade-valeants-massively-leveraged-long-short-strategy-unwind 3/44


The answer is in fact fairly simple. Critics of Valeant often hold disbelief over Valeant's
organic growth, i.e. the improvement in performance of drug products it acquired in the
past. The popular short thesis on Valeant is that its core legacy products cannot hold up in
performance and have to rely on continued acquisition to mask the declining performance
of the products it acquired in the past. I do not share a similar view. Valeant is not a typical
roll-up and does not suffer from many of the same issues traditional roll-ups often do. The
drug portfolio Valeant acquired in the past differ significantly from assets acquired in
traditional roll-ups in one significant way - pricing. Valeant recognizes that demand for
drugs is often very price inelastic and the existing system allows the drug company to
have complete control over pricing. While the cost synergy does not amount to much,
especially given the above-market premium it often pays for its drug portfolio, the revenue
synergy is often huge and Valeant is able to realize such synergy by simply rolling out
price increases. To enhance returns, Valeant deploys significant leverage to lower its
blended cost of capital.


Trade of the Decade - A Drug Carry Trade


The real economics of Valeant's business model are truly quite simple and are almost no
different from a carry trade many hedge funds commonly employ.


A carry trade is a strategy in which an investor borrows money at a low interest rate in
order to invest in an asset that is likely to provide a higher return. This strategy is very
common in the foreign exchange market.


In the case of Valeant, it is a drug carry trade. The strategy involves Valeant borrowing
money at its own blended cost of capital to invest in drug assets that will likely provide
higher returns due to future expected price inflation. The drug carry trade is really an
ingenious idea because Valeant can essentially function as its own central bank, dictating
returns on its invested assets, drugs, by setting its own drug prices. It is a "heads I win, tail
I don't lose" investment and allows PM Michael Pearson to comfortably take on significant
leverage to drive home one of the greatest trade since subprime, that is until Martin
Shkreli pooped the party.


Short Valeant, Short More as It Goes Lower as It is Destined to Fail


Sophisticated investors should be most familiar with the unwinding of a carry trade. It is
often one of the most nasty experiences for investors that are caught on the wrong side of
the trade. The reason for a crowded carry trade unwind is simple. For whatever reason,
should the spread between expected asset return and cost of capital narrow, or gears into

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3536686-drug-carry-trade-valeants-massively-leveraged-long-short-strategy-unwind 4/44


negative, a carry trade unwinds. In the case of Valeant, investors need to pay attention to
two metrics: expected return on its drug portfolio and Valeant's own blended cost of
capital.


Expected Drug Portfolio Return 2013-Present


As discussed previously, Valeant's expected drug portfolio return is primarily derived from
its ability to dictate prices. Let's roughly equate the expected drug portfolio return to
expected drug price inflation. Since 2013, Valeant has been on an extremely virtuous
cycle of drug price hikes. Many branded drug products in its portfolio experienced
significant price hikes despite having made little modification to the product to enhance its
quality. As a result, investors have lifted up significantly the expected drug price inflation
and that directly translates into a jump in the expected return of Valeant's drug portfolio.


Expected Drug Portfolio Return Present-Future


A party pooper entered the ring. Welcome, Martin Shkreli, the most hated pharma boy in
America. Mr. Shkreli's unscrupulous, greedy move of jacking up a life-saving drug by
5,000% sparked an outrage. While many sell-side analysts have dissed the likelihood of
complete pricing regulation in the pharma industry, they often overlooked the powerful
impact of public scrutiny. A congressional investigation has so far only picked out two
drugs in Valeant's portfolio, but the senators probably had little idea that Valeant has
quietly raised prices significantly on well over 30 drugs since they were acquired. Public
scrutiny and outrage from price gouging could completely upend Valeant's business model
or even put it out of business. Hence, Michael Pearson will have little choice but to slow or
even halt the price hikes he had planned to deploy; the potential to roll back certain
already implemented price hikes should not be discounted as Shkreli balked under public
outrage. The trend has completely turned and the Bank of Pearson is losing its ability to
dictate prices and set his own returns. The current expected return on Valeant's asset
portfolio seems far misplaced as future realized portfolio return will likely be substantially
lower.


Valeant's Blended Cost of Capital 2013 - Now


Valeant's biggest vulnerability is not necessarily in the return of its own product portfolio;
rather, Valeant's biggest vulnerability is the ebb and flow of its own blended cost of capital.
As Valeant succeeds in convincing investors it can produce returns on the drug portfolio it
acquired, Valeant's own stock price experienced an astounding 800% jump over the
course of a mere few years. Easy capital market conditions and hunger for yield allowed
Valeant to borrow cheaply. Both factors contributed to a significant decrease in Valeant's

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3536686-drug-carry-trade-valeants-massively-leveraged-long-short-strategy-unwind 5/44


blended cost of capital since 2013. Such significant drop in Valeant's blended cost of
capital can prove to be a curse later on, as it drops the required rate of return on assets it
acquires by paying ever higher prices while not fully account for the volatile condition of
the marketplace and the unexpected unforeseeable issues in realizing those returns.


Valeant's Blended Cost of Capital Now-Future


As discussed earlier, Valeant's own cost of capital is a function of two things. It's borrow
cost and its stock price. Upon news of the Clinton announcement, Valeant's CDS
experienced a significant move over the course of a mere three days, demonstrating credit
investors' concern on a shift of the expected return of its drug portfolio. Valeant's stock
price also tumbled almost 20% over the course of a few days. Both directly result in a
substantially higher blended cost of capital for Valeant. More importantly, as the equity
value of a carry trade really derives from the differential in spread, downward revision of
expected drug portfolio returns and upward revision of its blended cost of capital destroy
equity value further and drive up the blended cost of capital even more. The direct result
of which is what is commonly referred to as a death spiral in the stock. And the lower the
stock price goes, the lower the stock price goes.


Valeant's 10-year CDS have already jumped over 100 basis points in the past three
months, including an 80 basis point surge since the Martin Shkreli news came to light.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3536686-drug-carry-trade-valeants-massively-leveraged-long-short-strategy-unwind 6/44


Fundamentally speaking, every business accrues equity by making a spread between its
return on assets and its blended cost of capital. How is Valeant different? The key
difference in Valeant is that the company's return on asset has become deterministic, or
riskless. Pearson figured out that he could abuse the healthcare system by arbitrarily
dictating drug pricing and, therefore, determining the return on its asset portfolio. Such
riskless return opportunity is supported by the broader U.S. healthcare system and
millions of taxpayers and insured. By making the asset portfolio riskless yet earning much
higher return than a risk-free return, Valeant's business model flies in the face of basic
economics - riskless asset should only be able to earn riskless returns. From the very
beginning of Valeant's roll-up strategy, Valeant's fate has been sealed. It is destined to fail.


A Bubble Burst to Starve Capital for Innovation


Folks have been calling a biotech bubble for two years now. The sector bubble really
started with Valeant making drug assets riskless while earning a substantially higher return
than the risk-free rate. Other market participants quickly caught on by snapping up other
drug assets from people who did not understand the newly invented risk-return profile of
drug assets. Over the course of two years, industry insiders and investors have largely
caught on the nature of the gambit. Instead of taking risks in R&D to generate returns,
capital has increasingly been flocking into existing drugs by bidding up their prices as
evidenced by Martin Shkreli's staggering $55 million purchase of the effective but
inexpensive Daraprim. Martin Shkreli knows he cannot sell the drug at the existing price to
make a return; the seller Impax Labs knows that as well. The ensuing story is simply
inevitable. Had it not been Martin Shkreli, another person would have popped up.


A bubble in the Biotech index (NYSE: IBB) will inevitably burst. The earlier it goes bust,
the earlier we can return to an industry norm where excess return is made by risking
capital. Valeant, the godfather, has to go away for the sake of everyone's health and
longevity. The sad part is such a bubble burst will burn so many innocent and
unsuspecting biotech investors and further damage risk capital used in R&D. Our life
expectancy will probably all be a few months or years shorter than what it would have
been if it weren't for all the greed involved in making a profit.


Crowded Carry Trade Unwind, Get Out and Go Short


It would appear the Valeant fund is at the very onset of an LTCM type of situation. Having
entered into a massively leveraged carry trade in the drug business, Valeant's ability to
dictate drug prices is now in doubt. For the sake of basic human decency, Michael
Pearson should and will need to lower drug prices and roll back the magnificent price

hikes he has done over the course of the past two years. As its stock price starts to move
lower, its blended cost of capital will skyrocket further, pushing the spread into negative
territory given the expensive recent acquisitions. Negative spread further destroys equity
value and pushes up cost of capital. The loop goes on and stock goes down. Question is,
who will be holding the bag?


For the Sake of Basic Human Decency, Rollback Your Price Hikes, J. Michael
Pearson!


There is no other way to put it; price gouging life-saving drugs is despicable. The U.S.
healthcare system largely guarantees individual access but higher drug costs are
eventually absorbed by the entire system and the additional burden is shared by all
corners of the society. While individuals no longer suffer due to price gouging, the system
overall is being slowly suffocated by Valeant's actions. Since Mr. Pearson started
spearheading the strategy of overpaying for drug portfolio then hiking the prices on drugs
even more, Valeant became an overnight success. Such success invites copycats and
copycats of copycats. Valeant, in many ways, is like a malignant tumor that is rapidly
growing in the pharmaceutical industry and has already infected many healthy tissues in
the system. If left untreated, the entire pharmaceutical industry will soon become a
research-light and price-hiking one. Without investment in R&D with a long-term horizon,
the society as a whole will suffer. I obtained pricing information from a pharmacy
consultant on a few drugs that are in Valeant's drug portfolio and the price hikes are
infuriating.


J. Michael Pearson, for the sake of human decency, drug price hikes such as the one
detailed below are simply unacceptable and will have to be rolled back. Mephyton has
been owned by Valeant since its Aton Pharma acquisition in 2010.

Mr. Pearson should also think three times before jacking up prices on an overpaid drug
portfolio he acquired from Salix and roll back the egregious price hikes that have occurred
already since April 1st. Valeant took over Salix in April and the drug pricing pattern
detailed below shows Valeant's strategy in a crystal clear fashion. The U.S. healthcare
system should not pay six times for the identical Glumetza simply because Valeant owned
the drug. Valeant's shareholders are no more deserving than Salix's shareholders and
jacking up prices like this is egregious price gouging.


Glumetza is a once-daily formulation of Metformin, a very inexpensive, first-line treatment
for diabetes, but there is no once daily competitor


GLUMETZA 1000MG 90 TAB/BOTTLE


9/25/2012$793.67


9/19/13$926.38


6/9/14$1067.10


6/23/15$6395.91


8/13/15$9593.86


A single patient taking 2 tabs daily (the recommended dose) would expect to use approx.
$80,000 per year of product otherwise available for about $50 as generic Metformin 1000
mg tabs with no change in clinical outcome.


Further, on Xifaxan, please be mindful that everyone will be watching the company. The
price has already gone up 10% since Valeant became the new owner. What is the plan?


To the Bulls and Longs


I hold a short position in Valeant fully understanding the bull side of the argument, and
here is why the 12x EPS specialty pharma platform value investing approach will fail you
miserably.


What the bulls believe:
5/23/2018 The Drug Carry Trade: Valeant's Massively Leveraged Long-Short Strategy Is About To Unwind - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, I…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3536686-drug-carry-trade-valeants-massively-leveraged-long-short-strategy-unwind 9/44


1. Political landscape dictates current abusive system will stay in place and Valeant will
continue to have the ability to maintain and hike prices of its drug portfolio.


2. Worst case scenario, public scrutiny will cause Valeant to lose its ability to rapidly raise
prices in the near term but the already hiked prices will stay in place


3. Drug costs have largely stayed stable as at 10% of overall healthcare costs and,
therefore, it will not draw undue attention


4. Even without any additional price hikes, Valeant currently trades at 12x ex-special-item
EPS. It is somewhat of a value stock.


The above-mentioned beliefs will hold no water once the public collectively understands
the abuse Valeant has committed to the system. The politicians may split along the party
line on how to cure the abuse; no politician will find such rampant drug price gouging
acceptable. While it might be hard to develop and agree upon a truly effective system to
balance innovation, return on capital and affordability, Valeant will go away. To argue for
Valeant is to argue against the betterment of the human race.


Valeant will be at risk to roll back the price hikes it has deployed thus far not only because
it is the godfather of drug price gouging who started it all, but also because it has the least
defensible business model. The publicly stated strategy of no investment in long-term
R&D will render all the past price hikes completely indefensible in the spotlight. However
flimsy Martin Shkreli's argument of drug improvement might be, we cannot definitively rule
out such possibility. Valeant, on the other hand, has a publicly stated corporate strategy of
not investing in R&D. It is a major difference.


While overall drug cost as a percentage of healthcare cost has been stable over the past
several years. The beneficiary of such cost inflation is completely different. Cost inflation
at hospitals are distributed to other stakeholders such as employees and create jobs for
the U.S. Even for the traditional pharmaceutical companies, rising prices provided them
with capital to invest in R&D. Valeant is an oddball. The additional value almost went
exclusively to an offshore entity in British Columbia and subsequently directly accrued to
billionaire hedge fund managers and billionaire CEO. Nobody will view this matter lightly,
especially in an election season.


Thus far, I have raised zero question about Valeant's accounting, the reliability of its
reported organic growth and ex-item EPS. Given the moral compass of the company,
investors should not discount things that might be hidden under the hood. Investors
should also take notice of Valeant's long-time CFO Howard Schiller's departure. If

management at Valeant is okay with price gouging life-saving drugs while straining the
entire healthcare system, its shareholders have reasons to question whether the reported
numbers can really be relied upon.

Great article.


There are a lot of new companies following Valeant's business model - aggressive debt-fueled M&A and
steep price hikes. It is a unique time in stock market history, generic drug companies are hot performers.

We need either lightening of FDA regulation or a Hillary Clinton-style plan to pop the generic drug stock

He didn't miss it per se, this is their business model and it's no secret that Valeant pretty much buys up
companies, fires a lot of the acquired co's workforce, and hikes prices to get a quick return on the deal. He
just didn't foresee it becoming an election issue... which is shortsighted in that it comes up almost every
election cycle and is even more of a hot button issue as drug prices are the most visible aspect of healthcare
increases for most Americans.

Bill Ackman is a billionaire. He lives in a fairy tale world, divorced from the reality of the other billions of
humans who live on this planet. It would be no big deal for him if he got charged $10,000 a day for a
treatment. He could afford it without problem. What does he care if he spends $2K a month on health
insurance for his family and has a $10K deductible. For him that's dirt cheap. So he sees no problem with the
VRX strategy, as he is blind to the travails of the rest of society.

It would be great to hear your views on the following points.


1) Pearson's compensation package is highly levered to the stock price performance.


2) Pearson is not a charismatic or promotional leader at all.


3) Lou Simpson, ValueAct, Brave Warrior, Sequoia - just four names with a reputation for doing in-depth DD on their
holdings. All of them made VRX a big holding. In your view, where do they see the margin of safety?


4) Your views on Endo or Allergan (f.k.a. Actavis) would also be greatly appreciated.

One start to a "solution" is to make a rule where US drug prices cannot be sold higher than any price outside the
USA. The reason is that the US tax payer is giving large tax subsidies to drug research-why should the drug be sold
here higher than overseas?.....

TheBaron Investing, Contributor
It's the US healthcare system. It's the most obviously broken in the world. All other countries have single-
payer, or government owned, healthcare systems that allow the country to negotiate the best price for all
healthcare expenses, including pharmaceutical drugs.


Leaving hospitals and pharmacies to purchase drugs on a case by case basis, especially for little known
drugs that are required to save lives, means that drug companies can charge whatever they want, as the
demand stays the same and the system itself foots the bill.


The US has long been subsidizing the international communities healthcare bills, and when the first attempt
to properly fix the situation was attempted, it was derisively deemed "Obamacare" and gutted before passing.


I imagine pharmaceutical legislation would pass with a similarly tame "solution" once lobbyists are done with
it. It would be impossible to believe that would happen, if not for how difficult it was to foresee the Affordable
Healthcare Act passing without a public option, which it managed to do despite all rational policy observer's
protests.

If you do that and keep the current FDA policies on new drug approvals then all US drug research comes to a
halt.

It is special branch - biotechnology and if to push prices the companies will stop to work and then they will not
pay tax in the USA. In any case this twitter history is very strange and it is not a way to settle the problem.
Investors lost much money and usual investors do not believe this stock market at all now. How the person
can be a public person if he or she kills market. It is a danger for all. Many investors lost their health too, they
also are people.

That would not work Athen as there are many countries who could care less about patent protection and
insist on immediately selling generic versions of the drug from day 1 at a 99% discount. You would see the
possibility of new drugs vanish as R&D would implode.

Interesting point of view, but I think your analysis is off base logically.


1. Buying into drugs (which are like mini industries) with high pricing power is good strategy. Logically why buy into
industries with poor economics? If the investments have a short payoff it is not a carry trade at all.


2. I disagree with your assumption of overpaying because of a high premium to share price. A lot of these companies
were in a distressed situation when purchased which drastically drives down the share price. Salix is a great example.


3. I disagree with the idea that synergies are minimal. If you


4. Where I agree is that Valeant is like a fund, which means its high share price is a tool for acquisitions. The fact that
it fell in lock step with the market means that other companies are relatively the same price as they were before.


So in summary you have a company that buys distressed assets in good industries and then manages them
efficiently. The price increases and low taxes are just a bonus, albeit one that is often priced into the stock. By

28 Sep 2015, 12:59 PM


TheBaron Investing, Contributor
The trade is dangerous, I agree, though for different reasons. The author wanted to shine light on the fact that
public opinion could be swayed to deal with the pharmaceutical industries price gouging. I'd argue this is
unlikely for a few reasons:


1) Canada's healthcare system is an order of magnitude better than the US system, with more government
involvement, yet has also failed to implement satisfactory pharmaceutical legislation (note that many
developed European countries are an order of magnitude better than the Canadian system and, to my
knowledge, have managed to pass this legislation).


2) Many under-estimate the ability of vested interests to prevent US consumers from acting in their own self-
interest. Many have decades of experience forming public opinion, preventing legislation that should have
been passed many years ago from actually occurring.


3) The likelihood of a "Obamacare" solution to this issues is much higher than most rational observers would
expect. What I mean by this is the legislation was initially started with good intentions and real solutions. It
was gutted by congress on the request of lobbyists before passing, preventing effective change. (Note: It is
also likely to be scrapped if Republican's win the election, despite the effectiveness of the weakened policy
change. We are likely to see a repeat here, if it makes it that far).


There is currently "winds of change" that could negatively impact most of the bio-technology/pharmac...
industry, but like most winds, there is a massive machine in the US that is unlike any in the developed world.
For consumers to actually get the system to protect their best interests, particularly in the US, is a nearly
impossible feat.


On the other hand, the likelihood that the industry will choose a company to sacrifice to the public to get them
to forget this little issue even happened, is possible. This represents a bigger risk as Valeant, a Canadian
giant that fits the bill perfectly, stands out as a solid target. It depends how much influence Valeant has built
(purchased?) in Washington to see if they can ensure this witch-hunt stays focused on Martin Shkreli.

It's well known that Canada drugs are cheaper than the same drugs sold in the USA. That's one reason there
was a crackdown on the online Canadian pharmacies. Pharma companies have an aggressive differential
pricing policy for different countries depending on what the market will bear.

Let us see if the Republican chairman agrees to send this letter. If he refuses, then we can assume the
Pharma lobby got to him to protect their interest. The Valeant CEO, a Canadian cannot be subpoenad by US
Congress. They can force him to testify by threatening him and his executives by barring them from entering
the US and arrested if they did. The SEC can open an anti-trust case against them and then ask them to
testify. Valeant cannot refuse the SEC.

Please explain, when I see a story like this I see it as indicative of a capitalist healthcare system, and an
endorsement of socialized medicine.


I'm interested to hear how you came to the opposite conclusion.


28 Sep 2015, 02:03 PM


DianaH
In a market based system, the prices would be where the individual patient can pay not where 400m people
can pay in a convoluted political system setup to make the voter feel good. I have no idea what the market
price is for these drugs are, do you? Acute life sustaining heart drugs are very valuable (the favorite to go
after) as are drugs to reduce disability (liver disease is a big ticket item - and I'm not referring to the drug
price. There is tremendous financial logic behind the price of curing hep b & c). I don't know how much
gouging is really going on, especially with a socialized pricing scheme - it's not based on ability or willingness
to pay. I believe we have entered act 2 of obamacare, where drugs become unavailable and patients start
screaming. In any event, keep your health up.


28 Sep 2015, 02:41 PM


Envoy Global Research, Contributor
Amazing article. Unfortunately, many "mafia" capitalists don't comprehend the ultimate economic impact of
price gouging when they benefit from it in the short-term.


In the US, it is easy to price gouge on pharmaceuticals, b/c the individual patient is not the one who suffers. It
is society, as a whole, that ultimately suffers, thru insane increases in health insurance premiums, hospital
bills etc.


As you eloquently stated: "There is no other way to put it; price gouging life-saving drugs is despicable. The
U.S. healthcare system largely guarantees individual access but higher drug costs are eventually absorbed
by the entire system and the additional burden is shared by all corners of the society. While individuals no
longer suffer due to price gouging, the system overall is being slowly suffocated by Valeant's actions. "


28 Sep 2015, 03:15 PM

Why is this price gouging? It's business under socialized healthcare. The dems can try for a bandaid, but I
think they are out of luck. They put in a GOVERNMENT POLICY.

Interesting prediction Diana. You mean to say you think that supplies of life-saving drugs will be rationed by

You do not understand the healthcare system at all. Please stop posting your partisan rants as you dont know

interpretation of things. Socialized health care systems dont have these problems, any appearance of
socialization in america, ie, Bush and Medicare D (no price negotiations, from the largest payer no less) and
the gutted ACA were simply legislated capitalistic gold mines.

We should spend less on the last couple weeks of patients lives, clearly its not doing anything to meaningfully
prolong their lives its just wasting money.


Seriously, the most negative posts on this thread are by people with just about zero understanding of things.


We live in a finite universe with finite resources and thus whether or not you perceive it to be true everything
is already rationed. Some times its obvious, and other times its as if it isnt given the nature of the
supply/demand/costs.

"negotiate" one fair price for a drug, and do not let drug companies set rediculously high prices, and prevent

There is no such thing as a free market anywhere in the world, that is a ridiculous pipe dream that would

No matter the intent, any and every policy along with the cultural leanings of a society shape the markets.
What you call "free" operates within these bounds and the ideological version doesnt exist in reality.

By free, I don't mean unregulated, I mean unsocialized. I personally am not a proponent of unregulated
pharma as the dangers to the general population are significant, but I have heard many argue that it raises
prices and reduces options & discovery.


I'm referring to the socialization of healthcare delivery through insurance and pre-pay. If the organization
doesn't need to work hard & effectively for the patient, we get what we have now: price gouging, low quality
and really ineffective. Pull in some real financial incentive to have sick people & it's really fraudulent in my
opinion. Looseness in delivery will dictate the fortunes of suppliers - pill for your ill, etc.

Robin Hewitt, Contributor
"I mean unsocialized.... I'm referring to the socialization of healthcare delivery through insurance and pre-pay"


Not sure I follow. Are you saying if health insurance were outlawed, drug prices would fall?


29 Sep 2015, 05:52 PM


Zaphod15
You described a monopoly driven capitalistic system. These are gifts to middle men corporations that dont
actually need to exist in the first place. In countries with socialized medicine they have high quality and its
effective. "socialized" medicine is a judgement position, not an actual form of delivery. In reality, its just
allowing the biggest payer to do the obvious thing, consolidate and negotiate the best price for everyone. It
doesnt have to be only that, many other systems that are better than ours are hybrids and they still do well.
Ours is a mess and is unaffordable for the people and the country.


Most of the people complaining about things hurting drug discovery are not being honest about the process.
The industry spends more on advertising than R&D, and have long borrowed research from NIH and the
university systems. This may be changing with newer biotechs but they still benefit from the government
greatly.


29 Sep 2015, 06:43 PM


Zaphod15
These industries arent comparable because of a lack of perceived choice. You have choice to use a PC vs. a
Mac, if you are in a car accident you do not have a choice to price shop hospitals, doctors, or formularies.
That is a huge difference and makes any such comparisons meaningless. You cant compare free choice to
non choice as similar events.

Well, yes, if health insurance was outlawed, prices would fall. If you completely socialize, you will
disincentivize innovation as it's completely unrequired and costly. Captive customers & prescribed healthcare
does that. The answer is in the middle with a solution that fixes the actual problems. But, again, we're dealing
with the latter - captive customers & prescribed healthcare.


29 Sep 2015, 10:32 PM

Zaphod, there are segments to the industry. Obamacare may be a good solution to emergency care services,
but not for anything else. But, again as you stated with vitriol, it's terribly irrelevant. We're getting higher prices
with less R&D.

"if health insurance was outlawed, prices would fall"


Pretty sure you've never worked in healthcare.


29 Sep 2015, 11:46 PM


Zaphod15
I think you misunderstand the point of the ACA. The affordable part was for the country as a whole, so
healthcare doesnt become a black hole that keeps us from doing anything else. To do this the actual cost of
delivery had to be demonstrated to the people who used it and prior had no idea what it costs so they just
would show up to an ER with things that were no emergencies, oftentimes not even medical.


Now, people are bearing some of that cost and are self rationing, which lowers the overall cost to the system,
as one should have assumed must have been a primary goal. People have a hard time understanding the
value of something without having a stake in it.

No, insurance is a business model. Insurers don't "subsidize" the medical industry. They negotiate very hard
to bring down prices -- so their profits will be higher. If you actually worked in healthcare, you'd know that.
Insurers are tough customers.

Probably better to use a term other than "free" then. And "unsocialized". Both are politically loaded and not
very descriptive. 
Please take a look at Japan, Canada, Europe, which some might call "socialized". In Japan, medical costs are
1/2 of the US (as a percent of GDP) but the quality is about the same as the US. And virtually everybody in
Japan is covered under a single national system.

A great question... But much too rational.

The way the 'system' works in America is that doctors write the prescriptions and patients/pharmacists cannot
unilaterally alter them. Doctors who write prescriptions are held to a legal standard which may expose them to
litigation if they prescribe treatments which are less than state-of-the-art, such as generic 'cheap' Metformin.
So doctors are relatively reluctant to change to a less expensive, but statistically slightly less effective therapy.
Insurance companies, likewise, find themselves in the same litigious bind.


So no, in practice, the way the system is structured heavily disincentivizes seeking out 'alternatives' to the
most expensive possible therapy. Especially if someone, such as an insurance company can be forced to pay
the bill.


Over the long term, I believe this is going to lead to the collapse of the various insurance plans in the United
States, and economic ruin for the healthcare sector. But in the short term, the healthcare system is full of
companies advancing marginally better, but dramatically more expensive treatments.

"in the short term, the healthcare system is full of companies advancing marginally better, but dramatically
more expensive treatments"


What do you consider short term? I can find you studies from over 10 years ago bemoaning the fact that (at
that time) advancements in standard of care were only marginally better but dramatically more expensive.


Whereas today we have breakthroughs in biotech therapeutics ranging from epigenetics to viral delivery that
were little more than sci-fi concepts in 2005.

My understanding is that Glumetza is a timed release product, and easier on human biology than just taking a
cheap spike of metformin. Apparently, there are painful/uncomfortable/... side effects that ensue when the full
force of metformin is unleashed, which can be mitigated by a slower, low-level release of the same drug by
the Glumetza formulation.

Thank You! 
I think this is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a huge market failure in the way medicine R&D is allocated and lots
of people suffer or die as a result needlessly. The whole market must be reorganized, so that money can be earned
based on contribution to human health, rather than selling medicine that only prolongs suffering.

Full disclosure. I have a long position in VRX. I sold some shares for profit taking but still own some. I had the time to
think about this company over the weekend. I've been following the company for a few years now. Micheal Pearson is
one of the best managers I have seen. He is extremely smart and flexible. He understands the pharma businesses
very well. In the past, when someone wants to invest in a drug company, the research required was painstaking. You
have to worry about market size, competition, and patent cliff and all of that. Then Pearson came along. His pitch was
that he will invest in drugs on behalf of investors. This was great idea as people were sick investing in disappointing
drug companies themselves. Over the course of the past few years, Mr. Pearson demonstrated that he is THE BEST
at buying, integrating, and operating pharma company. But most importantly, he looks after his shareholders. Every
decision he makes is investor friendly. It sounds like common sense. Believe it or not, it is the most rare quality in

CEOs nowadays. 
I've seen a lot criticism of VRX over the years. Accounting fraud, tax inversion, too big to grow, no investment in R&D
blah blah blah. Pearson just did his thing. Deliver great results. Now go back to your short thesis. I sat in front of my
Excel on the weekend thinking what's the worst case scenario? The worst I could think of is that the government
passes some law THREE FOUR years from now capping drug prices. By then, VRX will be a lot larger. If the stock
still trades at today's price three years from now, we are looking at a company trading well below 10x in earnings. Will
investors pass this company up in three years at current price? Will competitors pass this up to acquire? In addition,
will Pearson stick his old strategy by raising prices knowing the political environment? Remember this guy is super
smart. I think he would probably be looking for deals in other areas of health care. On the flip side, is it that easy to
pass a law capping drug prices? US pharma is the best in the world because of FDA and all the regulations. Ripping
apart a working system needs some serious persuasion. VRX buys companies with CASH. And that CASH pays for
R&D. Those who complain that VRX does not pay for R&D is......Regardless how it plays out, I do not think this is the
end for VRX.


Finally, with regard to your accusation on company's cost of capital. VRX pays all its acquisitions with CASH. It
doesn't need equity raise. There is a good reason behind that. VRX generates LOTS LOTS of cash. Given the current
debt load, VRX could easily eliminate all its debt with 3, 4 years cash flows. Of course, Pearson is not likely to do that.
He will allocate capital the most efficient way. Yeah, widening credit spread. Credit guys are always always late to the
party and the make the most noise. We should be cautious but not scared to run or hide. This is pharma business, not
some cyclical industry. Things do not change over night.


Right now all the headlines are against VRX and every piece is so sensational. Investors are behaving irrational as a
result. The reason I did not sell my full position and take profit is that if I sell it now, I would be selling one of the best
managers that I've known. Will definitely pick up more shares once things stabilize.

proportion..It's simply gotten too big. You can safely invest with him when it was a couple billion dollar
company. When it is a 100 billion company, your safety net disappears rapidly. The scale is what eventually
kills him.


Now you have to believe that he can siphon insurance money and government money for 4 more years to put
in your pocket and the rest of his portfolio is still going to be worth a lot of money.. I believe in betterness of
mankind and think when this thing is fully exposed under sunlight, it will die. When justice and evil come face

I think your worst-case scenario is far too benign. Even if there is no regulatory action for years, they will be
much more reluctant to raise prices and draw more scrutiny, starting today. They are trading at a huge
multiple and that could compress significantly as investors price in lower organic growth from price increases.

It's even possible they are forced to reverse previous price increases, which would be a huge issue given
their balance sheet. They make a little over $2b in cash flow per year and have $30b in debt so I don't see
how they can "easily eliminate all its debt with 3, 4 years cash flows" as you stated. The worst-case scenario
is the same as any other company with so much debt - bankruptcy.

Ha, you stole the words from my mouth. The guy is not a brilliant businessman or manager. He is a sociopath
pure and simple. Noone with a modicum of social sense, compassion or morals, or any understanding of
basic economics, would dare consider to do what VRX has done. This is why it wasn't done before for
decades, even though many of these drugs have been around that long. Nobody would have dareed think
about raising the price of these drugs 200% to 1,000% etc. That is until a sociopatch showed up and did it,
and was rewarded for it by another group of sociopaths. Then others like Shkreli just followed the leader.


Unfortunately, from an economic perspective for these nuts, the business of raising drug prices to ludicrous
levels, cannot possibly be sustained, because society as a whole does not have money to pay for it. What do
they expect, health insurance premiums to go to $100K a year for a family to pay the "mafia" for life saving
drugs? The entire economy will collapse as all disposable income will go towards paying health insurance
premiums, drug costs, and other healthcare expenses.


29 Sep 2015, 05:55 AM


Envoy Global Research, Contributor
They didn't break the law. But, they are perverting the intent of the law, and of capitalism for that matter. Any
investor that supports companies like VRX is simply against free market capitalism, and a strong healthcare
system with growing biotech companies. They are supporting companies that aim to eliminate all competition
for life-saving drugs for consumers that have no choice but to take these drugs. By eliminating choice and
competition, they hope (and presently do) generate massive profits, at the expense of people's lives. Even
worse, because they eliminate competition, and jack up prices to consumers that have no choice, these
companies have no incentive to actually engage in R&D to develop better drugs and help mankind. So what
exactly are they being rewarded for? In fact, they blatantly extol the lack of a need for R&D as a virtue. But
where would be without solid R&D?

Evil? Psychopath?


This is why i say people sensationalize the current situation. As mentioned in my response. Drug pricing
requires deeper debate among lawmakers weighing both costs and benefits. Right now, it seems to me
everyone is hating on the player but lost focus that it is the game that they should blame. If the wind blows
against VRX, it is gonna be bad for the entire drug industry. Every pharma company I know of is trying to
maximize profits just like VRX. Once you cap that drug revenue, you will see drastic reductions in investments
in both acquisitions and R&Ds. Landscape of today's pharma will be changed forever.


Accounting issues=> I did not see major issues with accounting when chinos brought it up. I still do not see it
today. Company's accounting is legit and the business model is very resilient. As for the comment on its debt.
Company recently made a transformative acquisition. So debt number looks large but the cash flows will
follow in the upcoming year. To note, I have been following this company every quarter for the past 5 years
and I have seen a lot of frauds in pharma. VRX does not look that way. If VRX goes down, I am confident it
has to come from the outside government intervention.


Someone said my worst case scenario is too optimistic. I guess we have to agree to disagree. I simply cannot
imagine government forces VRX to retract price increases and push it to bankruptcy in the next few months.


With that said, I am not recommending anyone buying this stock at the moment. Government is onto pharma
and fund managers will probably stay away from it. Once we get some clarity, I think VRX is a great
investment for anyone's portfolio.

You do all realize that due to the legal patch work drug prices are basically made up, right? You can have a

Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine and gave it away for free. Did Einstein charge for his theory of
relativity? What about Watson and Crick? The same goes for many other great medical and scientific
discoveries in the last 100 years. The great people who discover new drugs or scientific truths, do not do it
solely for the money. In fact, they rarely care about money at all. They all do out of intellectual curiosity and
deep compassion for their fellow men.


So you are wrong: Low drug prices do not disincentivize R&D. What disincentives R&D is exactly the
opposite: Zero regulation of drug prices that incentivise companies to price gouge, and profit even when
doing zero R&D.

@Envoy ... R&D is costly, to put it mildly. Low prices most certainly are demotivating to drug companies.
Without patent protection to protect investments in R&D, breakthroughs in medication would slow to a crawl.

Robin Hewitt, Contributor
Drugs are costly to discover and to get approved (i.e., tested). In a capitalist economy, that does need to be
incentivized financially. And it is. What doesn't follow is that something that's already been researched,
already been tested, and is already in production at prices reasonable enough to become the ONLY
STANDARD OF CARE for a disease or disorder should be arbitrarily subject to an overnight price increase of
5,000%.


There's no serious debate between giving drugs away for free and allowing blatent extortion. To assert that
this is under consideration is to distort the truth.


What will probably happen is...almost nothing for a long time. But a debate will begin about how to find middle
ground and eventually drug prices will come under greater regulation. The recent incident with Daraprim

Robin Hewitt, Contributor
"Do you consider spending money on R&D as different than buying up companies that have/had spent money
on R&D."


There's obviously a connection. VC money often funds the drug discovery phase. Unlike other tech
investments, the "win" is not in going public, but in partnering with a deep-pocket pharma company to develop
the compound into a drug candidate, then (if that's successful) take it through the FDA approval process.


The decision to take a medical discovery further down the path of becoming a for-profit product depends on
many factors, of which sales price is only one consideration. Other considerations are product portfolio
strategy, time left on patents, patent coverage, availability of grant funding, size and composition of the target
market.


Because history has shown that market forces don't adequately encourage research into disease and
disorders that afflict a relatively small percent of the population (see above, size of target market
consideration), government grants encourage research for these afflictions through the Orphan Drug
program. Orphan diseases include autoimmune thyroiditis, polycystic ovaries, Chrons disease, and a number
of other treatable disorders that would likely otherwise be neglected.


Like car manufacturers and banks, drug producers already operate within a regulatory framework. Cars and
drugs both need to meet certain safety standards. Cars need to meet certain emission requirements for the
public good, regardless what the buyer thinks of that. Similarly, in the U.S., the government has played a long-
standing role in helping to make sure drug companies do more than just churn out headache and cold
medicines and in encouraging a broader availability of treatments that save lives and enable individuals to
remain healthy and productive. This relationship will continue and will continue to be refined.

Disclosure: I am short VRX in small size


Mr Zhou,


Your track record of SA articles is superb, and this is another superb article. You have perfectly timed the popping of
the biotech/pharma bubble, which I believe was driven not just by the VRX drug-price raising model but also by piles
of tax inversions. However, your comments down here seem to reflect how you WISH the world to be, rather than how
it IS, which I hope doesn't bias you too much. To the extent you are merely explaining how you thing the political
process may actually succeed against the supposed evil of raising drug prices, you may be right. I personally am
somewhere less extreme, siding more w/ Curtis in that regard. The special interests of Big Pharma will probably be
quite successful overall in the end, and I could easily see this "outrage" of high prices blowing over fairly quickly. I'm
normally pro-small-government, but given that patents grant a monopoly as given by govt, then I would support the
idea in theory of the government negotiating in some way w/ companies to establish fair drug prices, wherever
insurers are incapable or not positioned to do so themselves. I have no experience in the sector, and I have no idea
how that should be implemented in practice. However, I doubt such a thing will occur, given the power of Big Pharma,
who also happens to be the driving force behind the TPP (which is an overall good for the world, being pro-free-
trade).


That said, I am still short for the other reasons you've given, and for the accounting and unsustainable long-term
pricing of these drugs given patent cliffs and lack of barriers to entry to competitors once they're off-patent, and for the
apparent technical popping of the sector-wide bubble.


It's perhaps time I setup a generics co to undercut pricing from these guys...

"I would support the idea in theory of the government negotiating"


Honestly, I'd love to understand how anyone believes the government shouldn't be allowed to negotiate. I
mean we are a capitalist country, right? So everyone is allowed to negotiate to get the best price, except the
government, which is the biggest net buyer in the entire economy for all goods and services, especially those
related to healthcare?


It really doesn't matter if you are for or against government. The fact is that any size government is a buyer
and seller in the economy, like anybody else, and if you deny what is now the largest player in the economy
the ability to negotiate prices, well the entire economy suffers.


So, the easiest solution to drug price gouging is actually quite simple: Allow the government to negotiate drug
prices, just like any private company can. When that happens watch the druge prices plummet and VRX head
into bankruptcy.


I predict that within a few years, no matter which party wins the elections, the government will be allowed to
negotiate drug prices and companies like VRX will fail miserably.


The only biotech companies worthy of investment from now on, will be those that actually do R&D and
discover new drugs. They should rightfully be rewarded with pricing power, premium valuations etc.

I agree Ryan. There is a lot of wishing. Unless you can get rid of obamacare (a move that many will applaud

short thesis out there is the one on the entire market: a margin fueled stock market.

anything..

Given their growth it makes sense that trailing R&D spending compared to the next years sales are low. It
doesn't mean there isn't a large dollar amount going to R&D.

This is hyperbole.


I suggest that you have difficulty with the idea that a vendor should be free to charge what the market will bear.


Governments are free to buy up the rights to drugs before someone else does; they choose not to.

Great article.


Earlier this year, Valeant became Canada's most valuable company, exceeding Royal bank in market cap. The last
company to do that was another bubble stock with dubious accounting, that declared bankruptcy two years later. Is
history about to repeat?

jaberwock,


good point about the valuation of Valeant in relation to Canada's major banks, RBC and TD among them.


As a Canadian index ETF investor, it is incumbent to take note of the oversize holdings in one stock like
Valeant. I specifically avoid indices that include VRX based on market-cap; some ETFs had VRX holdings as
much as 7% of their index.

HCAnalysis, Contributor
Interesting article, I think your description of Valeant as a drug hedge fund is dead on. While I agree with your thesis,
a couple of things to consider in the mix, especially when comparing to the pathetic Martin Shkrelli


1. I have been across the table from Mike Pearson a few times, and I can tell you MP knows exactly what he is doing.
He is essentially acting as an arb for as long as the streak will last and is betting that the streak will last longer than
anyone thinks. As you point out he seeks assets that can sustain price increases and has the chutzpah to do it. The
difference between he and M Shkrelli is that MP pioneered or at least perfected the model, has a very thick skin so is
more willing to weather the flack than MS has proven to be, and better picks the assets to do it with. If you can handle
the PR barrage the next question is what real steps can anyone take against him. Congressional hearings are
uncomfortable, but they mostly are for show, and if they occur MP will be the smartest person in the room. As

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3536686-drug-carry-trade-valeants-massively-leveraged-long-short-strategy-unwind 36/44


comments above have raised he has not broken the law, so the only real way to stop Valeant is to somehow curtail
his ability to get price, which brings us to second point.


2. MP has been acquiring products that are primarily focused on cash or private market not government payer. Think
of the recent acquisition of Sprout and its "female Viagra" drug. Just like the real Viagra is, it will be a cash business,
people who want or "need" it will pay for it, so price is extremely inelastic. Compare this with silly Martin Shkrelli, not
only does he not have the strength to weather the storm he should have known was coming, but he acquires a drug
used with HIV patients which is 65-70% paid for by government entities. ADAP and PHS and Medicaid, the primary
payers, have significant ability to balk on prices. The drugs MP acquires have been carefully chosen to avoid this
scenario.


Having said this I think just like every arb activity, eventually the opportunity closes, either because the available
assets that make it work run out, sellers understand and increase cost even more, or cost of capital no longer remains
cheap enough to make it work. Think of the LBO streak of the 80s. The Sprout acquisition I think is instructive here,
too. It is hard to imagine 40+ year old women spending through the nose for a psychotropic drug that barely works to
treat a condition that many women aren't really that concerned about. This is reminiscent of when LBOs moved from
cash generative, fixed cost businesses like tobacco and moved to airlines with high variable costs, and elastic pricing
- they ran out of the low hanging fruit, maybe we are at a similar tipping point.


So, yes, I agree that Valeant's winning ways are numbered, but caution it may be a bit more sticky than I inferred from
your article.

Author’s reply »  Thank you for the response. Never sit across the table from MP but I certainly could tell
you've been in that seat. It's true that if there were a congressional hearing, he will be the smartest guy in the
room. But I question if he is the wisest guy in the room.


MP has a problem. He can never have enough. Much like his old boss Rajat Gupta. That's why I believe this
whole thing will eventually unravel on himself as smart as he is. MP has intelligence but not enough wisdom.
If he understood the limit of his strategy, he would never have been in the hot seat and would have a great life
to live on. Now the question is what kind of legacy is he leaving to the society and how history will speak of
this person.


As smart as MP is, he must realize his out-put driven R&D is creating a perverse incentive throughout the
industry. Is it output driven R&D or frivolous R&D. Why were there so many patent challenges? The irony of
the story is, he might get away with billions..but there will be one day when he needs that medication that
could have been invented to save his life should he not pioneered this whole R&D capital misallocation
strategy....or his loved ones..if he were a true capitalist, he should think is the additional billion and ego boost
worthy of really digress societal progress and healthcare innovation...I think Karma will come back to haunt
him one day. I don't normally wish ill on people but if he stays course..I truly hope he disappears as a
person..because he's "murdering" millions of statistical lives..


Finally, on the private payer..Just because you direct your prescription to specialty pharmacy and massively
subsidize copay and eat up restrictives does not mean people will forever stay dumb. I'll do my part to make

sure this gets out. We live in a progressive society and a business strategy betting otherwise will not end up
well.


That being said, how long this continues is anyone's guess. The stock might hit 300 before it hits 0..but if MP
doesn't know his limit, i think its a matter of when he blows up not whether. I'll be there watching


I have such a hard time understanding why collectively, it is so difficult for us to do anything..Everyone knows
it is wrong..and its really hurting healthcare and innovation in drugs to save lives..and we all sit idly by and let
it happen? What happens when the day comes that you need the drug..? How is the money you make going
to help you?


29 Sep 2015, 10:47 AM


igmos00
Being the smartest guy in the room does not help the least little bit during a congressional hearing. The point
you seem to neglect despite your in depth knowledge is that MP's business model is predicated on his ability
to keep making deals and not solely to keep raising prices. Legally it may be possible for him to do the latter
but this would only further exacerbate his problem since it is pretty clear he is harming the public image of the
industry and the deals he has been relying on will simply dry up. At that point further price increases will not
help.


29 Sep 2015, 12:36 PM


Ryan Yates, Contributor
Obviously you are passionate about keeping drug prices low. To the extent political will accomplishes this,
innovation for new drugs will be stifled. That's a fact. As a trader, i don't come in w/ any preconceived biases
or notions about what the "right price" is for anything. If certain drugs experience huge multiple increases,
who's to say the price wasn't too low in the first place, or still too low? (This is a rhetorical question--I simply
mean to point out the disposition effect at work, or the similar endowment effect when it comes to those that
were previously buying at much lower prices)


Of course, like others have said, there should be someone negotiating monopolistic prices to keep them in
line somewhere. Where that level is, is not my area of expertise. Without checking, I accept mph's assertion
that most of VRX's drugs are negotiated at prices against private parties. My next question, not being overly
familiar w/ the industry, would be that given Obamacare, what kind of pressure is being put on the private
parties to keep prices low? If that pressure doesn't exist, it should. Whether it will is another question.


Mr. Zhou, you seem to think prices will be pushed lower b/c "justice will prevail." I beg to differ. Many much
larger societal injustices continually occur every day both inside and outside the US.

"MP has been acquiring products that are primarily focused on cash or private market not government payer."


Actually this is a stupid strategy, as there are not enough cash buyers who have enough money to spend
outrageous prices on these types of drugs that are not a "need".


The "smart" strategy was/is to buy drugs that the government pays for, because the government is not
allowed to negotiate prices, so you charge whatever you want. The 2nd best strategy is to convince
healthcare insurance companies to raise premiums to outrageous levels to pay for the high drug prices. All in
all, under both strategies, it's not the individual cash buyer who loses, b/c they don't pay that much for the
drug. It's society as a whole that suffers, thru sky-high insurance premiums, and a malfunctioning healthcare
system.


It's easier for these sociopaths to sleep at night when they are harming millions and millions of faceless
victims in society, rather than a specific individual who needs the drug.

"Obviously you are passionate about keeping drug prices low. To the extent political will accomplishes this,
innovation for new drugs will be stifled."


Absolute rubbish. The greatest discoveries in medicine have been free and made without any monetary
consideration whatsoever. Even in modern-day mafia capitalist times (the last decade), a fair profit has been
more than enough to incentivize innovation. You don't need to gouge the system, like VRX and others have
done in the last few years, to stimulate innovation. Not to mention that these companies, like VRX, don't
innovate anything, which disproves, from the get go, the notion of pricing influencing innovation.


29 Sep 2015, 04:46 PM


Whole Grain Analysis, Contributor
I think:


1. You underestimate the inefficiency in the sector found in many other pharma companies that VRX still
avoids, perhaps due to its young age.


2. Using a non pharma example it would be a stretch to argue that Whole Foods adds no value because it
retails rather than innovates. Whole Foods indirectly spurs a lot of spending on product development that will
fill its shelves, even though Whole Foods itself doesn't spend it.


VRX is much the same. VRX uses its (previously, before the emergence of Endo and others) unique position
to take to market a variety of drugs that others have invested R&D money in. When you realize that part of
their specialty is in sales it makes a lot more sense. So I reject your thesis that VRX reduces R&D spending
rather than providing another outlet.


3. R&D spending is low due to very high growth and some of the sectors that VRX participates in. If you
examine some of their core sectors and compare to previous years revenues then R&D spending gets

materially higher. So you are punishing VRX for investing in acreative deals in products that require no R&D
to fuel the R&D that they do.


In fact if you ever work with some of the big pharma companies you will see how stifling they are to
innovation.

I thought this was an investment thesis forum not a public policy forum. Regardless, Medicare is only govt
agency not allowed to negotiate price, all others can despite popular press perpetuating myth. The "stupid
strategy" has led to the growth Valeant has seen thus far, and is basis for many drug portfolios. I argue it will
run out, whether it is moral or not is not really an investment concern, unless you think you are investing in an
R&D based company versus a drug hedge fund.


30 Sep 2015, 02:47 PM


SGI
I do understand your argument: 
the main argument being along the lines of the paltry R&D budget (percentage wise) and the fact that VRX
behaves more like a PE fund.


However true and righteous you might be though, your argument is more philosophical/sounds emotional,
and does not necessarily point to a short thesis on VRX. There is no room for emotion here and it should be a
clear analysis of the risks vs benefits of investing in VRX or shorting it.


06 Oct 2015, 01:59 PM


Jay Yoon, Contributor
Great article. I should add though, ignoring all of the political talk, VRX has terrible fundamentals. If you include
acquisition-related amortization costs and other "one-time" costs (which are not really one-time) that are excluded
from Non-GAAP, the Company makes zero money....none. Chanos did a good job of pointing this out last year. I think
fundamentals and GAAP earnings will start to matter more now that issues have been raised regarding the
sustainability of VRX's business model. So, regardless of political posturing, this company is overvalued on a
fundamental basis.


29 Sep 2015, 03:31 PM


The Stock Stooge, Contributor
To say that VRX wouldnt make any profits if they stopped cold on the m&a front is...going way too far. Look at
their portfolio and cost structure! Obviously they would have to do some acquisitions eventually given the low
R&D budget. But the tone by the author and in this comment that this company's current portfolio at current
prices is not very profitable is just wrong.


Hypothetically, what's wrong with having a company that buys up late stage/branded products through M&A,
leverages their global infrastructure and ability to raise cheap debt to profit and engages in low or no R&D

In many industries the final seller of a product isn't the one who did the R&D. Only Pharma is so vertically
integrated and cost overruns are systematic at this point. Purchasing R&D externally is far more efficient and
allows much more control over spending.

Well, VRX just blinked. Despite my earlier comments on the resilience of MP, I guess there was a limit. VRX's model
only works as a drug hedge fund. If the company is pivoting away from its "mis-priced" asset strategy, it will then have
to rely on R&D like any other drug company. However, there is no institutional expertise at VRX in R&D by design, so
its ability to compete puts it at a significant disadvantage to most other companies in the space. This may just be a PR
move, not a real pivot, but either way the stock is in for a period of stagnation. Time to move on to other investments.

environment and keeps raising rents to pay for the mortgage and finance lifestyle. Until one day, the rents are too
high, public opinion goes against him, and the rent control board steps in. His credit starts to deteriorate and general
interest rate environment also starts to go against him. Perfect storm! It will be really hard for Pearson to pull the
company out of this mess and be a real test for his leadership. Short-term upside catalysts: being acquired or change
of leadership by a well-known turn-around specialist; short-term downside catalysts: further regulatory scrutiny and
large shareholder liquidation. Stock probably trades between $50-$120 in the next six months barring event driven
