Aurelius’ research.  Aurelius will not update any report or information
on this website to re�ect such positions or changes in such
positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius
A�liates” are not in any way associated with Aurelius Capital
Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and
any a�liates of or funds managed by the latter company.


——


On May 10  we published a report exposing how Pingtan Marine
(PME) has fraudulently �nanced international crimes including
human tra�cking and poaching while concealing rusting hulks that
are now decaying inside abandoned �shing bases.


Pingtan subsequently issued a May 11  Press Release and held its
previously scheduled May 16  earnings call, neither of which left us
with much to respond to.  However, Pingtan has not disclosed that it
held a secret Chinese conference call early on the morning of May
12  (U.S. time) in advance of its earnings release.


The call was led by Pingtan’s CFO, Roy Yu, who was previously the
CFO of Lihua International (LIWA), a fraudulent equity that is now
worthless. The call-in details were circulated on a Chinese message
board where Mr. Yu is frequently posting.


Although the call ran over 90 minutes and included undisclosed
declarations, no 8-K or press release was �led. We recorded the call
and engaged a professional translator to create a rough transcript
that can be found here.


Pingtan’s secret call appears singularly designed to fool Chinese
retail investors with comically false statements. We suspect that
Pingtan has failed to disclose the call’s existence so as to keep Mr.
Yu’s comments from being scrutinized by analysts and regulators.


This report highlights some of the most egregious falsehoods
advanced by Pingtan since our initial report was published.  We
reiterate our research opinion that shares likely have zero value.

(Note: We engaged a professional translator to transcribe the call’s
audio.  Because this transcript was prepared on an urgent basis, it
contains grammatical and syntax errors. As a result, its contents
should be considered an approximation of what was said.)


 “Nothing mentioned in the report is true. Everything in the report is
fake. No claim is meaningful. The report uses several forged
illustrations to discredit the company”- Roy Yu


Faced with irrefutable documents, photos, and video evidence,
Pingtan’s CFO is now attempting to convince Chinese retail investors
that “everything in the report is fake.” Even though Pingtan only holds
$500k in unrestricted cash, Mr. Yu tried to bolster his claims by
threatening that Pingtan will spend “$2 million” to sue us as part of a
“joint lawsuit” to be purportedly �led along with other companies
we’ve exposed.


Farcically, the entire premise of Mr. Yu’s argument is that “nothing in
the report is true” and even “the photos are fake” and “forged.”  We
�nd this assertion particularly humorous because the key photos in
our report are sourced directly from media outlets such as CNN
Indonesia, Detik News, The Sydney Morning Herald, and even
Pingtan’s own promotional video.


The mountain of evidence we assembled during our investigation is
meticulously sourced and linked throughout our report. Yet Mr. Yu
seems to be harnessing language barriers to prey on
unsophisticated Chinese investors.  We �nd it particularly telling that
Pingtan appears unwilling to put its assertions in writing or in SEC
�lings that would have to withstand scrutiny from regulators and
the broader investing public.

Above: Supposedly “fake” images sourced from CNN Indonesia and
Detik News.


Other things we noted from the secret call include:


Mr. Yu appeared to mislead investors by falsely implying that
its 10-Q �nancials are audited (they are not):  “our �nancial
report will be released next Monday, as normal, according to
our previously announced plan. So, from the other side, it
proves that these things these organizations said are not
true, because the auditors will check it after that, or do a
research on it according to the procedures, and the report will
be released if there is no problem.


Mr. Yu also appeared to hint that the forthcoming earnings
announcement would exceed expectations: “the EPS
guidance the company gave was 8 to 10 cents per share.
Hope everyone pays attention to it. Personally I am very
con�dent”


“According to the report, the major investor of the company
embezzles US$900 million cash from the headquarter of the
company. I … I don’t really want to talk about this issue”. Mr
Yu went on to feign ignorance of how the $900 million total
was calculated, even though page 1 of the 10-K lists the bulk
of the related party transactions we cited in our report.


Mr. Yu claims he cannot formally comment on the crimes
that occurred at the Chairman’s bases because they are “not
within the framework of the listed company”. That is false
because Pingtan’s 10-K speci�cally states that “a large
portion of our operations are conducted from a base owned
by our related party PT Avona Mina Lestari” (Page 8) while
the Investor Presentation highlights supposed “barriers to

entry” that the bases provide.  Pingtan’s failure to disclosure
a raid by the armed forces and criminal �ndings of fraud,
human tra�cking, and poaching, has concealed obviously
material developments.


“Pingtan has not been cited by or had any action brought to it by the
Indonesian government or any governmental body”- May 11  Press
Release


This statement is an obvious falsehood because, as explained in our
report, the Indonesian Minister of Maritime Affairs, Susi Pudjiastuti,
has publicly declared she would report Pingtan to the NASDAQ.  The
Minister said that “this could be our �rst international fraud case
involving the NASDAQ” and that “there is no such company [Pingtan]
in Indonesia.”


Source: KKP News


The facts show that Pingtan is deceiving investors by taking credit
for vessels titled under related party companies controlled by the
Chairman’s family, principally PT Dwikarya Reksa Abadi (“Dwikarya”)
and PT Avona Mina Lestari (“Avona”).


Avona was raided by the Indonesian armed forces and Dwikarya was
shuttered after being found by the government to have committed
serious crimes including human tra�cking, illegal �shing,
fraud/forgery, and bribing corrupt o�cials. Consequently, a
signi�cant portion of these ships appear to consist of dilapidated
vessels crumbling inside the now-abandoned bases.

Perhaps this explains why Roy Yu seemed to become unhinged when
the topic of Minister Susi was broached:


(Note: A Chinese researcher edited the transcript so as to clarify the
commentary and the above represents an approximation of what
was said).


Pingtan’s Ships are “fully licensed”


Pingtan has consistently told investors that it owns a “fully licensed”
�shing �eet.  The purported licenses have been used to justify the
$9.3 million per vessel valuation that Pingtan has paid to the
Chairman’s companies in exchange for ships dating to the 1970-
1980s. During the secret call, Mr. Yu defended the valuation by
comparing the �shing licenses to taxi medallions:


She [Minister Susi] is all tattooed and uneducated,
smokes cigarettes and gets drunk daily. She is a
gangster, she used to run a protection racket. She
trades in �sh and wants to drive the price up by
messing with the supply. She has told a lot of lies and
given a lot of incorrect information to the relevant
government bodies, from the get go, her MO was to use
the excuse of illegal �shing to harass our ships and to
stop us from �shing.

Recently I have been to New York and got a taxi … a
yellow taxi. I was interested in the taxi and asked the
driver how much the taxi is worth. The driver answered
its worth US$30 thousands but my taxi license worth
US$1 million. The overall price of the taxi is above US$1
million. The key point here is the license. The �shing
market is similar to the taxi market.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/new-lies-emerge-pingtans-secret-conference-call/ 7/9


Pingtan recently posted Chinese government documents on its
website as supposed evidence of its �shing licenses. But the
principal problem is that the documents are Chinese authorizations
that have no legal standing in foreign waters.


Pingtan knows it needs licenses from foreign governments to �sh in
their waters but seems to be trying to sow confusion amongst retail
investors. Management has previously claimed to hold Indonesian
�shing permits, even declaring in 2016 presentation (below) that “the
Indonesian government’s anti-illegal �shing measures will be
bene�cial to fully licensed �shing companies such as PME.”


But this is a lie because the facts show that most of these licenses
don’t exist.  As discussed in our report, Indonesian o�cials have
made clear that Pingtan never held any licenses there. Pingtan’s
Indonesian a�liates also appear to have operated without licenses
for substantial portions of their �eet.  Dwikarya was speci�cally
found to have bribed o�cials (page 3) while Avona made “gross
falsi�cations of the boats certi�cates” (page 2).


As an additional example, Pingtan recently claimed that 13 of its
newly built ships were deployed to Timor Leste pursuant to �shing
licenses it was purportedly awarded.  But our report showed that the
ships and licenses are held by Honglong (the Chairman’s company)
and not Pingtan.  After these vessels were caught in February, 2017
with a “cargo hold stuffed with sharks” (con�rmed by drone footage),
the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Timorese government
had even “sought and received a written assurance Pingtan was not
involved.”


Caught in an obvious lie, Pingtan updated its website after our report
to claim that these ships are “in-process of transfer” to Pingtan.

“We never cheat the investors or the institutions….Firstly, the
Chairman Zhuo said that he would personally buy back the stocks
from the market Yes, he is going to buy back the stocks in the
market.” – Roy Yu


In addition to declaring that the Chairman would buy PME stock, Roy
Yu claimed our report was purposefully timed for a blackout period
when insiders could not make purchases.  We note that the
Chairman made no mention of this commitment to purchase shares
during the formal U.S. conference call and has not made any form 4
�lings showing the promised share purchases.


We have no idea if the Chairman will buy back stock or not.  But we
do know that Mr. Yu’s comments parallel similar promises of
“transparency” and buybacks that he made to LIWA investors in
2011.


Mr. Yu resigned from Liwa in November, 2012 (page 15), well after
fraud allegations began to surface in 2011.  The stock fully imploded
in 2014 after a series of improprieties were revealed.   It is
indisputable that investors who listened to Mr. Yu  in 2011 have lost
their entire investment.
