Vipshop: Upon Closer Examination, Cash Flow Is More Like 'Cash No'
Jul. 30, 2015 8:15 AM ET36 comments
by: Mithra Forensic Research


Summary


Similar to its revenue and earnings profile, VIPS has reported impressive and steady
growth in its Cash Flows.


However, the company has managed to bloat its Accounts Payable and Accrued
Expenses balances to some of the highest levels in the industry.


Essentially, VIPS is generating Cash Flow by not paying its bills.


Recent trends at VIPS and peers seem to indicate that AP and AE balances are
coming down.


Consequently, Cash and HTM balances as reported for December 2014 were
overstated by nearly $600M.


1. Reasons for the delay in this update


It has been a month since Mithra's last update on VIPS. The delay was certainly not
because I had run out of potential manipulations to highlight at VIPS - quite the contrary. I
believe that the company's most recent financial statements provided additional
indications of potential financial statement manipulation as highlighted in the reports here
and here.


While I was in process of writing another lengthy update on 1Q 2015 results, I was
sidetracked. A few of VIPS' promoters thought that through intimidation and harassment,
they would silence me. They failed. In fact, Mithra Forensic Research, LLC is now
operating as an independent investment research firm concentrating exclusively on
accounting and fraud shorts.


While the events of the last few weeks have been both disheartening and entertaining, I
would much rather spend my time seeking answers to the questions that I pose with
respect to financial statement manipulation.


So, with that in mind, I have but one question for VIPS and VIPS' promoters - What is up
with your Cash Flow or, should I say, Cash No?


2. Whether It Is Measured In USD Or RMB, Cash Is Still King

Mithra's reports of May 12th and May 29th identified a number of issues which I believe
point to large-scale financial statement manipulation at Vipshop. I highlighted several
instances where VIPS' management made statements that were inconsistent with or
contradicted by the company's financial statement filings or management's comments on
earnings calls. I identified several potential manipulations that, combined, would have
resulted in VIPS overstating its revenues by a multiple of ten. I highlighted the potential
use of Related Parties and circular transactions as a means to artificially inflate revenue. I
questioned the values reported for certain assets, such as Inventory and Property, Plant &
Equipment. Finally, I questioned whether the Cash and Held-to-Market Investments
balances were real.


Of all of the issues that I raised, the topic that generated the most questions and
comments was around VIPS' Cash and Held-to-Market Investments. The key question on
most people's minds was whether the growth in Cash and HTM was real. A few
commentators stated that while they could not determine whether VIPS was engaging in
manipulation, as long as the company generated positive and growing Cash Flows, they
considered it a buy. Based upon these comments and trends that I noted in VIPS' 1Q
2015  financial statements, I decided to dig deep into its reportedly strong Cash Flows.


Based upon my research, I believe that VIPS' Cash Flows are being prettied up. In fact,
my analysis suggests that VIPS should be reporting about $594M less in Cash Flow from
Operations than it is currently reporting. The company has pushed large amounts of its
costs into the accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts. These balances are
almost never paid down, and accumulate to provide significant uplifts to VIPS' reported
Cash Flows. In fact, the results of the analysis show that without the benefit of ballooning
payables and accrued expenses, VIPS would have reported negative Cash Flows from
operations in 2014.


2.1 When Paying Your Bills Is A Historical Event

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 3/22


In its SEC Form 6-K filed on May 15, 2015, VIPS managed to do something that it had not
done in 13 calendar quarters - it paid down the balance of the combined costs associated
with Accounts Payable ("AP") and Accrued Expenses ("AE"). The decline was only about
6%, but it was a decline nonetheless.


In every quarter since 1Q 2012 , VIPS has added more costs to its balance sheet through
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses. These costs represent bills, currently or soon
to be, invoiced that have yet to be paid. Companies try to strike a balance of not paying
too soon and not paying too late; the company needs to both preserve its cash and also
preserve relationships with its vendors.


Historically, VIPS had not seemed too concerned with upsetting or bankrupting its
vendors, as the bills on its balance sheet grew exponentially. The company often
highlights the rapid growth in its revenues (a CAGR of 133% from 2012 to 2014), but
another interesting fact that should be highlighted is that VIPS' combined balance of
Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses has grown at a whopping 135% CAGR from
2012 to 2014. Individually, AP has grown at a CAGR of 125% and AE has grown at a
CAGR of 167% for the period.


Further evidence of VIPS' newfound payment religion is the fact that AP and AE as a
percentage of Total Assets had been around 60% in 2012 and 2013, but by 2014, the
figure was down to around 50%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 4/22


The fact that VIPS has started to pay down - even slightly - the balances on these two
accounts could be due to a host of reasons, including:


Vendors and employees having expressed that they are no longer willing to informally
finance VIPS through a very extended payment plan;
VIPS having decided that it is good business to pay your vendors and employees in a
reasonable time frame and in accordance to established agreements;
Peers decreasing the time to pay vendors, which required that VIPS also adjust to
remain competitive.


However, I will add another possibility:


The vendors that are represented by the long-outstanding AP and AE claims are
Related Parties (RPTS), and they require cash for their operations or, possibly, for
round-trip transactions, as described in the May 12th Mithra report.


Regardless, of the rationale, VIPS and other competitors are now shortening the time it
takes to pay vendors. Given the large balance that the company holds in AP and AE,
payment against these debts will severely negatively impact VIPS' healthy and growing
Cash Flows From Operations ("CFFO"), as well as its Cash and HTM balances.


In fact, it could be argued that a significant amount of the reported Cash and Held-to-
Maturity Investments were not available or accessible for the day-to-day operations of
VIPS, as they were already committed as payment for the bloated AP and AE balances.
Cash and HTM as reported on the balance sheet was not sustainable, and analysts
should have netted the over-accrued amounts of AP and AE from the reported balances.


2.2 Reported Cash Flows Dependent Upon Severely Delayed Payments


When trying to identify aggressive, manipulated or fraudulent accounting, many analysts
will evaluate the trends in the Cash Flow statement to assess whether growth in earnings
was accompanied by growth in cash. In the case of VIPS, one would have noticed that it
recorded impressive CFFO of $505M, against earnings of $123M .


The company also reported an increase of $437M in its Cash Balance, primarily as a
result of proceeds from a bond offering. But further analysis reveals two red flags that
point to aggressive accounting and possible manipulation.


Firstly, in the report dated May 12th, I explained my belief that VIPS had used CAPEX and
a series of investments as a means of tunneling cash out of the company to RPTS, who
would then transact artificial sales. The accounting for these transactions would have


3

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 5/22


required large cash outflows from investing, which would then appear as equally large
cash inflows from operations. Indications of round-trip transactions like this would be
revealed in the fact that the amounts spent on Investing activities approximated the
amounts received in Operating activities. The Cash Flow statement offers some support
for this view, as total cash outflows from CAPEX and Investments of $454M closely
approximate the amount reported as net Cash Flows From Operations of $505M.


Secondly, a scan of the Cash Flow Statement  reveals that the key drivers of growth in
CFFO are large sources of cash from the increases in AP ($448M) and AE ($180M),
which offset large uses of cash for Inventory ($337M) and Receivables ($99M).


3. Over-Reliance On Accruals Is Relative


For comparison purposes, I re-configured the Cash Flow statements of VIPS and 4 of its
peers in the flash sales sector to present Cash Flows using the Direct method. This
approach provides ease of comparison and a clearer identification of the extent to which
each company is reliant upon various sources and uses of Cash Flows. The model I used
is the Uniform Credit Analysis ("UCA")  model. The UCA model is presented in a form
similar to that of an income statement. For the purposes of this analysis, I am only
computing up to the level of Core Cash Flows from Operations (excluding impact of other
income, interest and taxes); the full UCA model computes Cash Flows from Investing and
Financing in a similar manner.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 6/22


The UCA model reveals that while VIPS is third in highest Cash Gross Margin as a
percentage of Cash Revenue, the company generates considerably more Core Operating
Cash Flow as a percentage of Cash Revenue. Impressive as those figures are, the
absolute values reveal that VIPS owes much of its reported Cash Flow simply to the net
impact of changes in working capital sources (AP, AE, Deferred) and uses (AR, Inventory).


In fact, without the aid of these working capital changes, VIPS would have reported only
4.5% in Core Operating Cash Flow as a percentage of Cash Revenue - less than half of
the 9.9% achieved by Jumei International Holding (NYSE:JMEI), which gets minimal
benefit from working capital changes in support of its reported Cash Flows.


Now that we know the importance of AP and AE, we can conduct a comparative analysis
on these accounts to assess the extent to which VIPS' balances are out of sync with those
of its peers. I analyzed each of these accounts against two key sets of performance
indicators:


Percentage of Total Assets; and
The Cash Conversion Cycle.


3.1 Whether By Balance Sheet…


The analysis of AP and AE balances as a percentage of Total Assets revealed that VIPS
and Dangdang (NYSE:DANG) lead the sector by a wide margin.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/7/30/saupload_VIPS_July_0.jpg

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMEI

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 7/22


However, despite differences in sales volumes, assets and product focus, JMEI, JD.com
(NASDAQ:JD) and Zulily (NASDAQ:ZU) all tend to maintain AP and AE levels of no more
than 33% of Total Assets.


DANG, which bears a closer similarity to ZU and JMEI in terms of assets and revenues,
reported AP and AE which exceeded 70% of Total Assets. The company recently missed
its EPS target for 1Q 2015 by a wide margin. It posted positive earnings in 2014, but had
recorded earnings losses for 2013, 2012, and 2011. DANG has also revealed net
decreases in Cash for 3 of the last 4 years. In our opinion, DANG is holding large amounts
of AP and AE because it is preserving and closely monitoring its Cash Balance.


VIPS, however, has been profitable for several years, and reports blockbuster growth in
revenue and Cash Flows quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Why, then, does VIPS look
more like DANG (carefully preserving scarce cash) than JMEI (managing growth) when it
comes to its AP and AE metrics?


In my opinion, VIPS should be reporting AP and AE totals approximating 28% of Total
Assets, in line with JMEI, JD and ZU. The company has recently had AP and AE totals of
over 60% of Total Assets.


VIPS' current level of AP and AE at 50% of Total Assets suggests a company
struggling, not thriving as its reports suggest.


3.2 Or By Days Outstanding… VIPS Does Not Pay


Another way of evaluating the reasonableness of VIPS' AE and AP balances is to evaluate
the company's Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), which is a measure of how long it takes to
convert sales into cash. Typically, the CCC is computed by taking the values for Days
Sales Outstanding, adding to it the value for Days Inventory Outstanding and subtracting
the values for Days Payables Outstanding.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 8/22


Most firms have relatively small, if any, balances for Deferred Sales and Accrued
Expenses, and these figures are not usually used in the CCC formula. However, given the
level of importance Deferred Revenues and Accrueds serve in this industry sector, I have
modified the CCC calculation as follows:


Adjusted CCC =


+ Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) + Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)


- Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) - Days Accrued Expenses Outstanding (DAEO)


- Days Deferred and Advance Revenue Outstanding (DDRO) - Days Due Related
Parties Outstanding (DRPTO)


Also, because I am attempting to assess the adequacy of the ending balances of each
account, I am using ending balance sheet account figures for each of the formulas, not
the averages. For example, DAEO is computed as: [Ending Balance of Accrued Expenses
/ Operating Expenses] * 365 days. Each of the key competitors in this space records
negative Cash Conversion Cycles, owing to the fact that they tend to have a large number
of cash sales and they are not obligated to pay vendors until 45-60 days after sales are
completed.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 9/22


While I expected relatively sizeable and negative CCC days for all firms, the figures for the
market leader, VIPS, and DANG are massive and, again, out of sync with other key
competitors.


The CCC reveals that VIPS and DANG are holding onto their cash from sales for 7-8
months before having to pay for inventory and other operating costs. The key
contributors to these massive figures are indeed AP and AE. Vendors and
employees are essentially financing VIPS' and DANG's businesses.


Again, with respect to paying bills, VIPS is behaving more like cash-challenged DANG
than like a company flush with cash. It might argue that good cash management is a
positive , however, in my view, taking 8 months to pay your vendors and employees is
rarely a sustainable business model. Moreover, VIPS' management has mentioned
previously that it has an excellent cash management template:


Customers mostly pay cash on delivery ;
VIPS holds Inventory in its warehouse for no more than 12 days ;

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 10/22


The company's arrangements with vendors allows it to pay for goods usually 1-1.5
months after the sale .


If all of the above are true, then


Why does VIPS show 11.5 days sales outstanding?;
Why is Inventory on hand for nearly 74 days?;
Why is Days Payable in excess of 127 days and Days Accrued at 166 days;
Where do you find employees willing to wait 4 months for salary payment?


And critically, how will VIPS' reported Cash and HTM be impacted now that the company
and several of its competitors seem to be shortening days outstanding for AP and AE. For
these reasons, I have serious concerns about the sustainability of a model that relies upon
ever-growing vendor financing. Based upon previous reports, I have additional concerns
that AP and AE may well be accounts used to funnel cash to RPTs as part of a faked
sales scheme.


4. So What's The Impact Of Delaying Payment


Given the fact that metrics at VIPS and DANG are outside the bounds of several other
established flash sales companies, I decided to use figures reported at JMEI, JD, and ZU
to compute an industry average target. The computations for each metric determined that
VIPS' average AP and AE balances should:


Approximate 28.4% of VIPS' Total Assets; or
Average 81 days in Accounts Payable and 62 days in Accrued Expenses


I computed values for the ending balances of AP and AE for VIPS using these estimates.


If VIPS had reported Accounts Payables and Accrued Expenses balances at a percentage
of Total Assets or at CCC levels averages of those at Jumei, JD.com and Zulily, VIPS
would have recorded between $589 and $594M LESS in Cash Flow from Operations
than reported for 2014.


Total Assets Approach

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 11/22


Days Outstanding Ratio Approach


Consequently, if VIPS had recorded the figures these metrics indicate, the company would
have reported negative CFFO of ($88M). VIPS' negative CFFO of ($88), combined with its
reported negative Cash Flows from Investing of ($664) and proceeds from Cash Flows
from Financing of $620M would have resulted in a decrease in the Cash Balance of
($156M).


It is my belief that VIPS has held significant AP and AE balances in an effort to exhibit
strong Cash Flow and Cash Balance positions to the market.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 12/22


However, VIPS and its competitors are now being forced to shorten their payment cycles.
If this continues, VIPS is clearly one of the most vulnerable companies in the space, and
would be forced to pay off significant AP and AE balances. I suspect that a sizeable
amount of the reported Cash and HTM balances have already been set aside to pay these
bills, which is why Cash and HTM have risen over the last several years as well. Whether
the counter-parties are actual vendors or related parties, an unwinding of these AP and
AE balances will negatively impact reported Cash Flow and Cash Balance. A significant
amount of cash reported in Cash and HTM is likely to be unavailable or inaccessible, as it
is being held to satisfy AP and AE claims.


It should also be noted that the above analysis assumes that all of the outstanding AP and
AE are reflected on the company's statements. However, as I mentioned in the May 29th
update, I suspected that the rapid and growing losses at investee companies is indicative
of VIPS pushing expenses off-balance sheet. If the company is indeed pushing these
costs on to Lefeng, Ovation and others, the true total balance of AP and AE is even higher
than what VIPS is recording in its financials. It is unclear whether investee companies are
also being forced to shorten payment schedules, and to what extent these companies
have cash on hand to pay the balances. A key question is whether the investee
companies would look to VIPS for cash in the event that the investee companies were
cash-strapped.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 13/22


Extrapolating this analysis for 2012 and 2013, we see that while VIPS has reported
healthy and growing CFFO, adjusting those figures to account for inflated AE and AP
would have resulted in CFFO of between $100M and $594M less than reported. In
addition, given the rapid growth in AP and AE, the divergence between Reported CFFO
and revised Sustainable CFFO was expanding considerably by 2014.


The chart above explains how VIPS' healthy Cash Flow is, in fact, a disappointing
Cash No.


5. Less Cash Validates Some Earlier Concerns About Cash And HTM


Nearly $600M less in Cash and HTM is accessible and available to VIPS, due to it being
set aside for payment of AP and AE. This lack of available cash also explains and
confirms several suspected manipulations I raised previously:


A lack of cash would explain why VIPS needed to borrow funds to invest in Ovation
and Lefeng, despite showing large Cash and HTM balances at the time;
Lower amounts of Cash and HTM might explain why reported interest was low in
comparison to prevailing market rates for bank term deposits;
Dwindling cash reserves would explain why a company with such a stellar record of
revenue, earnings and cash flow growth has needed to access the capital markets

every year since its IPO in 2011.


I predict that VIPS will seek financing from the capital markets in 2015. In my opinion, if
the company is using cash to pay off bloating AP and AE balances, as well as to pay for
continued investment in CAPEX and logistics companies, it is burning through cash
quickly.


Indeed, like its potentially manipulated Revenue and Gross Margin, VIPS' reported stellar
results are far less impressive when examined against company and industry norms.


For these reasons, and those outlined in my reports of May 11  and May 29 , I
continue to have grave concerns about VIPS' Cash, HTM and other accounts. I am
maintaining a view of STRONG SELL / SELL SHORT, with a target price of $0.

Please go on any TV network or have representation do so. These are significant allegations from a shadowy online
figure. This is a top 10 publicly traded company in China. It's time for Mithra to put its chips on the table and double
down on these accusations, if accurate.

I'm a vendor on VIPshop.com and continue to introduce Canadian companies to them.


This is purely anecdotal, but historically they have paid me within the terms of my invoice (30 days). I recently tried to
introduce a few new vendors to them - they referred me to someone they've placed in New York - someone who is
managing their U.S. vendor relations in-country.


Based on the interactions I've had with a director there over the past few years they seem to be growing like crazy.


Disclosure, I own a tiny position.

copywriter, as a vendor with several other vendor connections - may I ask you to confirm the process on
when you raise invoice "time allowed for inspection, quality checks, taking possession of inventory, putting on
site, actual sales, customer returns, returning unsold inventory minus damaged, and then PAYING the
INVOICE"?


After you ship items, do you INVOICE immediately or wait until the inventory is taken into full possession by
VIPS (subjected to quality inspections) or wait until the items are SOLD and undamaged inventories are
RETURNED and then INVOICE for the SOLD and DAMAGED (due to VIPS or its customer faults) items?


As a vendor, I would appreciate hearing the details of this process from you directly though I have good idea
on this from many analyst reports that I read already!

The goods are listed and sold in order to generate a PO, which I then invoice against. That's how flash sites
work (which you know, but others here might not). I invoice when I ship. They consider the invoice 'payable'
upon arrival of goods.


Customer returns are handled internally - they are bought back at a discount.

I can say with certainty that VIP has the most severe penalty for mis-shipped or missing items of any site I've
worked with.

copywryter, thanks for your insight from the perspective of a vendor. Given billions of COGS by VIPS over last
few years with only last 45 to 62 days of AP reported at year end 2014, I feel confident they have paid
BILLIONS to vendors over years ON-TIME within terms of the invoice and secured happy vendors like you
who referred other vendors to VIPS (who again grew crazy and happily by your statements).


With this and other information we outlined, it is safe for me to conclude that the author of this article is utterly
CLUELESS or highly INCOMPETENT or obsessed with some ulterior motives.

My point is that any mystery person can post information and argue merits. Best idea is to find out who the biggest
vendors are out there and ask what's going on. Has Mithra or anyone done this? I'd venture that taking that step by
analysts has already been done. Perhaps not. I'm sure they will soon if not yet. Further comments one way or another
is pure speculation. Mithra is a potential manipulator with this article so close to earnings. Buyer and seller be ware..

Who is the firm's auditor? I believe its one of the big four, have they provided supplementary comments on the
audited financials? (I would think Miithra should know this). All of this speculation is by folks who clearly have skin in
the game and therefore all the reason in the world to be less than honest.

"A few of VIPS' promoters thought that through intimidation and harassment, they would silence me. They failed. In
fact, Mithra Forensic Research, LLC is now operating as an independent investment research firm concentrating
exclusively on accounting and fraud shorts."

who hold questionable companies accountable.

Your updated analysis of VIPS financials is again completely flawed. Without considering the increase of number of
vendors of VIPS and simply stating that VIPS has managed to bloat its Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
balances to some of the highest levels in the industry is totally ignorant, or intentional. VIPS has seen its vendor
numbers increasing to more than 13,000 from just a few thousands in the past year or so. And the VIPS vendors are
now in wide categories ranging from apparel, cosmetics, home goods, home furniture, kitchenware, electronics,
smartphones, etc. (while VIPS vendors in early days were mostly in apparel). VIPS even sells Apple Watches. VIPS
has significantly widened its offerings while still maintained its competitive flash sale model. As the number of venders
of VIPS grow exponentially, its Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses balances will of course increase. If you had
ever visited VIPS website (which I doubt), you would see so many different vendors with so many different product
offerings in a constantly changing fashion because of its nature of flash sales.

Apart from the above which I want to know - let me give you one hint why you should be ashamed of your accounting
degree (before you bring a bad reputation to the institute that conferred you degree upon) -

You took 986.6M AP from Dec 31, 2014 report. That is the 4th quarter ending AP. Any retailer does 70% of the 4th
quarter in the last 45 days. VIPS did 1.36B revenues Q4 2014. 70% of that will be approx. 950M. In essence, Days
Payable Outstanding is approx. 45 days and not 127 days. When you take Q4 ending AP for a company growing
revenues north of 100% and apply it against yearly revenues, your DPO will be skewed.


Now if you can throw out your accounting degree out the window before you bring down the reputation of the college
you graduated from, the college may not have to disown you.


BTW - I'm a business guy and am no accounting specialist. I could calculate the DPOs based on the practical nature
of a growing retail business (see my calc above and learn from it so you don't commit such blunders in the future)

No Christmas season in China so your 70% rule does not apply.


01 Aug 2015, 04:35 PM


stockplaza
The retail pattern is the same, starting with 11.11 singles day. Most Chinese retailers have their best in Q4.
Even without the 70% benchmark, see my comments below, the authors calculations are FLAWED. Check
the example given below to understand why.

Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I disagree with your approach of using 70% as a benchmark as it does not provide better
information. Nonetheless, if you were to use it, you would have to apply it to each of VIPS' competitors. In the end,
you would see that VIPS' DPO numbers are still out of whack in comparison to its peers.


The bigger issue I have with your calculation though is that it is WRONG. You are using VIPS' revenue for the 4th
quarter of $1.36B. Days Payable is calculated using Costs of Sales [(AP divided by COS) x days in period]. If you had
calculated this correctly and used COS of $1.02B as well as your 70% benchmark, the DPO figure would have been
62 days--nearly 40% higher than what you mention above and still higher than the 1 to 1.5 months payment terms
which the company claims it has agreed to with vendors.


Now, I could gloat and tell you to take the advice that you so rudely offered to me in the last line of your post, but I
won't. Instead, from one non-accountant to another, I will just wish you well.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3374215-vipshop-upon-closer-examination-cash-flow-is-more-like-cash-no 19/22


Mithra - You'll agree that your original 127 days DPO is at least 100% inflated to this 62 days calculation. My
point being, your calculation of DPO taking 4th quarter ending AP to the whole year average COS for a
company growing over 100% is FLAWED!


Applying the same calculation to JMEI or JD does not make VIPS DPO look that bad, considering we all know
that VIPS gets favorable terms due to it FLASH SALES nature (JD is mainly a mass retailer where it
buys/stocks inventory in advance). Moreover the 62 days is in-line with payment terms of 2 months
considering time allowed for inspection, quality checks, taking possession of inventory, putting on site, actual
sales, customer returns, returning unsold inventory minus damaged, and then PAYING the INVOICE


My conclusion is that your calculations and the thesis derived out of FLAWED logic is simply that - FLAWED.


Another aspect of CASH FLOWS is growth companies make investments (expansion, warehouse build outs
etc.) and many growth companies (Uber for example bleeds 1B every 6 months and they keep rising money
to fund expansion at ever higher valuations) may need growth financing. Just because a company is taking
advantaging of opportunities ahead of it by financing growth does not make company worthless, rather the
opposite (as can be seen with Uber for example).


If VIPS needs financing for buying land like this http://stks.co/a2JoP there will be plenty of avenues to raise
capital for expansion.


Once again, don't go broke with your FLAWED logic and numbers!

The above being said, I wish that you stay safe and put out your logic however FLAWED that might be and
don't get silenced by anyone on your fundamental rights of expression. So, live on and I hope to see many
entertaining articles from you!

Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Again, no. See my comments above.


Also, my calculation for DPO is for annual changes, not quarterly. Hence, any issues with respect to sales
being stronger in the beginning or end-of-year do not matter in an annual calculation. There is no need for a
benchmark.


VIPS' DPO is 127 days.


01 Aug 2015, 12:01 PM


stockplaza
Leave aside benchmark. I have not seen anyone calculating DPO or DSO based on annual COGS. You don't
expect last 45 days of yearly COGS to be paid a year in advance on the first 45 days of sales? You would not
do that, right? The sales or COGS in the first 45 days of year vs. last 45 days of a year for a company

growing north of 100% will be very different. Even without any retailer seasonality benchmark (universally all
retailers make the most in last 45 to 60 days of Q4 and that is a well known statistic), the actual DPO is far
less than your HIGHLY FLAWED calculated 127 Days indicate.


You statement despite being corrected on your FLAWED numbers, repeating VIPS DPO is 127 shows you've
some sort of personal vendetta or other ulterior motives here. You don't seem to be open to any reasonable
logic or explanations.


01 Aug 2015, 12:21 PM


stockplaza
Let me take an hypothetical example to illustrate this.


Lets take a hypothetical retailer young and fast growing company called SuperUber selling goods online.


SuperUber does 1M COGS in first 30 days and growing to 10M COGS last 30 days of the year with average
monthly COGS of 2.5M for the year or annual COGS of 30M. It ended year with 10M AP (last 30 days of
COGS). In this example, the DPO is 30 days as only last 30 days of the COGS are payable. If you wrongly
apply that last 10M AP to yearly COGS 30M, you would wrongly derive 122 DAYS DPO which is FLAWED.
The correct number here is 30 DAYS as only last 30 DAYS of COGS are pending to be paid.


That was an example to open up your eyes and mind. Hope this example helped you to see how FLAWED
your calculations have been. If you still cannot see it, then I can't help you at all.

Are we at this again? Seriously! Mithra your timing seems to be uncannily focused around ER. You must realize that
this alone puts your intentions/motivations at question and serious scrutiny.  
Power to VIPS for negotiating longer net payables. Why finance when your suppliers are agreeable to offer longer
than net 30? But besides this, return policies do not mean that the sale is final until the return date expires which in
itself makes payables a moving target. Anyone in the business knows that from time of distributor receipt, to sales
event, to processing, to delivery, to "RETURNED MERCHANDISE", to processing of returned merchandise, we are
talking about more than 30 days. 
Mithra while I commend your determination in shorting VIPS, your efforts seem grossly myopic, your understanding of
the industry limited, and your research lacking. My suggestion is to interview several of VIPS' reputable suppliers,

Hey Drop*, 
Somebody unearthed Mithra F .. It is here http://bit.ly/1LoT7R6  
Many who called Kroll got the confirmation, Melvin Glapion has been fired from Kroll. 
Now the author confirms at the beginning of this article "Mithra Forensic Research, LLC is now (NOW)
operating as an independent investment research firm" with (NOW) emphasized by me. So, in the last couple
of weeks, Mithra F has become independent research firm.


I deduce from the above that MithraF has no other credible research, and a person who was fired from job
recently heading this new firm.


I also further deduce since the author does not know how to appropriately calculate the numbers and the
wrong logic he has repeatedly exhibited, his firm will fold soon. That's my reasoned forecast on MithraF's
future. But I would like see his entertaining articles, so I wish he has at least access to a computer and net for
a while so he writes some garbage and continue to entertain all of us with his flawed logic, flawed
computations, wildest speculations, etc. I don't know about you but I'm having a ball reading up his articles
and seeing how some crooked / flawed minds think or write about their wildest imaginations with no real
substance to back up.

Hey DiO - Let's not pretend that China does not have transitory issues. The recent market gyrations (though
the market is still the best performing in the world wit 66.4% UP for the year http://cnb.cx/1SwzhJ6) and govt
interventions to stabilize the market fall definitely exposes issues with the transition and heavy govt. hand. In
any transition there will be winners and there will be losers. Definitely mfg., commodities, currencies tied to
commodity exporters (Brazilian Real, Loonie, Aussie, etc.), etc. are the big losers for last few years. And the
winners are Chinese Consumer economy as the transition is away from mfg. to consumerism. The big
beneficiary of consumption is the RETAIL sector whose growth has been at 2x the GDP rates. Even bigger
beneficiary has been the "Internet Retailing - eCommerce" due to lack of adequate offline malls/outlets in
China. In a way, the retail in China is leapfrogging from OFFLINE to ONLINE (just similar to how INDIA
skipped LANDLINES and leapfrogged to mobile phones). The growth of BABA, JD, VIPS, BZUN etc. are a
testament to that underlying massive shift. Those who don't understand the underlying trends will ultimately
perish!

The Indian landlline analogy is a very good one. I agree. Chinese consumer and financial companies are
going to prosper.


I also think that China's cultural aversion to 'losing face' vis a vis their heavy invisible hand is going cause a
market collapse in the medium term. Until then, there's money to be made in $baba, $vips and a few others.
