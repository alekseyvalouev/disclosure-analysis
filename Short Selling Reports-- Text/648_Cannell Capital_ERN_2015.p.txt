Erin Energy: Questionable Characters At A Stratospheric Valuation
Jun. 4, 2015 6:00 AM ET52 comments
by: Cannell Capital LLC


Summary


ERN has had a fantastic run-up leaving the company's shares grossly overvalued.


ERN's colorful management and past related party transactions raise many
questions about its governance and assets.


ERN is likely to return to its history of destroying shareholder capital and faces
potential liquidity risk.


Erin Energy Corporation ("ERN", formerly known as Camac Energy, Inc.) is the best-
performing U.S. listed Oil & Gas stock in 2015 with a year to date performance of ~295%.
The market capitalization is $1.85 Billion. Comparatively, over the same period, the
Bloomberg Intelligence Global Independent E&Ps and Integrated Oils index (Bloomberg
ticker BRNGEPVA) declined by nearly 6%. This outperformance flies in the face of a long
history at ERN of shareholder destruction, a revolving door of senior executives, a series
of questionable related party transactions, arguably gross overvaluation, and steadily
increasing debt levels. We believe the shares could be worthless, or close to such.


ERN "went public" in 2010 through a reverse merger with Pacific Asia Petroleum ("PAP")
through which PAP acquired approximately 60% of Camac International Ltd.'s ("CIL")
"production sharing contract rights" in the Oyo Field offshore Nigeria for approximately $32
Million in cash and 99 million in shares and warrants. (For ease of reference, all activities
conducted by CIL including those conducted by its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Camac
Energy Holdings Limited and Allied Energy Plc., will be referred to as CIL.)


This transaction gave CIL ~70% ownership of the listed company. By the end of the year
ERN had a market cap of about $230 Million.


A few months after the deal closed, ERN's CEO, CFO, and a board member of the Audit
Committee resigned. Between August 2010 and April 2011, ERN went through two CEOs
until Kase Lawal became CEO and Chairman, which he has remained since. Since
August 2010, ERN has had four different CFOs with the fourth joining just this month.
Today, ERN is ~57% owned by CIL. According to CIL's website Kase Lawal is also the

Chairman of CIL and his brother, Kamoru Lawal, is the President and CEO of CIL.
According to ERN's public filings, Kase Lawal is a 27.7% "indirect owner" of CIL, and "his
family owns 69.3%" and "may be deemed to control CIL."


Since the reverse, ERN has focused on a (now) failed Chinese joint venture, prospecting
in countries like Gambia and Ghana, and additional transactions related to the Oyo
offshore field in Nigeria. These operations have contributed to an accumulated
shareholder deficit of -$478 Million. Shares outstanding have risen 264% from 58 Million in
December 2010 to 211 Million today. After shifting focus from one area to another since
inception, the present focus of the company has returned to where it began - the offshore
Nigeria Oyo field in the OML 120/121 lease block (the "OML").


CIL is the "original indigenous operator" of the OML, having discovered oil here along with
Eni SPA (NYSE:E) ("ENI") in 1995. In June 2012, CIL acquired all of ENI's participating
interest in the OML and its remaining stake in the production sharing contract rights for
$250 Million. A little more than a year later, in November 2013, CIL successfully sold to
ERN these participating interests and the portion of the production sharing rights ERN did
not own for consideration worth approximately $500 Million (based on 11/30/2013 closing
share price). This deal was structured as a $170 Million cash payment to CIL, issuance of
a $50 Million convertible note and issuance of shares such that CIL would own roughly
57% of ERN after the close. The cash consideration for this purchase was primarily
funded from a large investment into ERN by The Public Investment Corporation of South
Africa ("PIC"). In November 2013, PIC invested ~$270 Million for ~30% of ERN at a
meaningful discount to the prevailing market price.


The cash infusion from PIC was a lifesaver for ERN. Allegedly, CIL had been operating
the OML assets at a loss and ERN's own liquidity situation was increasingly critical. In its
own Form 10-Q for the Q3 2013 period, ERN stated that "factors raise substantial doubt
about the company's ability to continue as a going concern." Ironically, in the same quarter
ERN had to take a $186 Million non-cash impairment charge due to "a downward revision
of proved reserves at the Oyo Field." Nonetheless, ERN proceeded to offer to buy the
remaining production sharing rights and total economic interests in the OML from CIL.
Based on ERN's share price today, the total value of the consideration paid was
approximately $940 Million.


ERN's Board of Director's Special Committee retained Canaccord Genuity ("Canaccord")
to provide a fairness opinion on the purchase of the OML and surrounding transactions.
According to ERN's deal proxy, Canaccord told ERN on November 13, 2013 that it would
be "unable to conclude that the terms set forth in the draft term sheet of October 31, 2013



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/E

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3235116-erin-energy-questionable-characters-at-a-stratospheric-valuation 3/17


were fair, from a financial point of view." Two weeks later, ERN's Special Committee
obtained its fairness opinion by making modest tweaks to the deal, notably by lowering
CIL's pro-forma ownership stake to ~57% from ~61% and lowering the amount of
convertible bonds to be issued to CIL from $100 Million to $50 Million.


In its calculation of comparable offshore transactions, Canaccord came up with an implied
enterprise value range for the deal of $107 Million to $196 Million, far below the price
actually paid by ERN:


Cannacord further examined the appropriate implied enterprise value range based on
comparable company trading metrics and established a range of $172 Million to $422
Million.


Why would PIC, an organization entrusted with managing the South African Government
Employees Pension Fund, among other assets, make such a questionable investment
decision? In a series of articles, South Africa's The Mail & Guardian revealed that Kase
Lawal is a personal friend of South Africa's president Jacob Zuma: "in 2010, the Lawals'
holding company signed a memorandum with Zuma's charity, the Jacob G Zuma RDP
Education Trust, pledging R1-million annually for five years. The following year, Lawal
accompanied Zuma to his alma mater, the Texas Southern University, to get an honorary
doctorate." According to The Financial Times, the PIC is no stranger to allegations of
politically motivated investments, reporting that "the PIC at times struggles to shed the
perception that political considerations as much as financial ones guide its investment
decisions." Furthermore, The Business Times of South Africa reported on June 1, 2014
that the CEO of PIC, Elias Masilelas, resigned suddenly and unexpectedly after clashes
with the Chief Investment Officer noting that the ERN deal "in particular sparked clashes
between the two."


Kase Lawal's personal history is concerning. According to a U.N. Security Council report,
in February 2011 Mr. Lawal, along with former NBA basketball star Dikembe Mutombo,
attempted to smuggle gold out of Congo. The gold was to be purchased from the
Congolese warlord, and "most wanted" human rights violator, General Bosco Ntaganda.
The plan allegedly backfired, when instead of selling Lawal and Mutumbo the gold,
Ntaganda and his men turned the tables and robbed Lawal's henchmen and held the crew

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3235116-erin-energy-questionable-characters-at-a-stratospheric-valuation 4/17


of a Gulfstream jet (leased by a CIL subsidiary) against their will. The U.N. report recounts
an allegation that Lawal later paid more than $30 Million, including a portion for "bribes," to
get out of the mess and that the deal was financed using funds from the Camac Group.
(The U.N Security Council report can be read online here). A flight attendant, Kelly
Shannon, brought suit against Camac International after she was "interrogated and held
for six weeks" in Congo as a result of the gold fiasco. The owner of the jet, David Disiere,
was awarded $32 Million after the Gulfstream V jet was "lost" in Congo.


Other fun Kase Lawal adventures include:


1) Alleged forgery: According to a story published by The McClatchy DC news service, "a
six-count criminal complaint filed in Nigeria eight years ago [2000] charges Kase Lawal
with joining in a plot to forge papers in the name of a local company, win offshore-drilling
approvals and illegally pump and sell more than 10 million barrels of crude oil."


Some reporters alleged that Lawal got "off" for this incident because he "bribed both the
then Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General of the Federation to intervene
by 'killing' the case."


2) Alleged oil piracy: A 2008 McClatchy DC news service article states that "from 2003 to
2005, The Mail & Guardian in Johannesburg, South Africa, reported in several stories that
Lawal had engineered a deal between the South African government and Nigeria that
ultimately promised to bring South Africa 120,000 barrels of oil a day at wholesale prices.
Neither of two companies that CAMAC set up ever provided any oil to South Africa,
however. Instead, the oil went to one of them in the Cayman Islands that was 75% owned
by CAMAC, the newspaper said. Its minority owners remain secret. The other firm, which
apparently got no oil, was the South Africa Oil Co., established in Pretoria. CAMAC owned
49% of its shares. The remaining shareholders were a 'who's who' of relatives of leaders
of the country's ruling African National Congress, the newspaper said."


Kase Lawal is a significant donor to American political campaigns. He supported Hillary
Clinton in 2008, reportedly helping her campaign to raise more than $100,000. Per public
campaign finance disclosures, Lawal raised $35,800 and $28,500 for President Obama's
2008 and 2012 election campaigns, respectively, and raised a further $32,400 for the
[Democratic] House and Senate Victory Fund in 2014. Lawal's publicly-disclosed direct
contributions to political campaigns total $147,800 since 1998 (Data available via query).


Kase Lawal has been appointed (incredibly, given his background) to public commissions
by three different US presidential administrations. According to a profile published by The
Economist, Lawal was "a member of the United States Presidential Trade Advisory

Committee on Africa during the Bush and Clinton Administrations." The Obama
administration appointed Lawal as a member of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy
and Negotiations in 2010. It appears Lawal may have been removed from this committee
following the 2011 Congolese warlord gold smuggling fiasco.


Putting questionable deals and accusations of fraudulent behavior aside, we estimate that
shares of ERN are worth little to nothing. There are already signs that the company could
have liquidity issues: in January 2015 the company's driller, Northern Offshore
International ("NOF NO"), attempted to terminate their contract with ERN claiming that
ERN was unwilling or unable to meet the terms of their arrangement. NOF NO cited a
"failure to provide the required letter of credit" and demanded that ERN be "required to
pay Northern all outstanding unpaid invoices, the early termination fee, the demobilization
fee and amounts due but not yet invoiced for work performed up to the date of
termination." ERN disputes this claim and the parties are in mediation according to ERN's
10-Q filed on May 8, 2015. This quarrel further speaks to the risks inherent in ERN serving
as "operator" of the company's offshore assets - a position which, as far as we could find,
ERN did not have any experience with prior to their well announced in May.


In ERN's 2014 10-K the standardized measure of discounted future net revenues based
on the company's reserve report and various operating estimates stood at $237 Million
based on oil prices of $100.37 per barrel. The spot price of Brent Crude today is $65.49,
35% lower. As of March 31, 2015, ERN did not have any oil price hedges in place. ERN's
debt, inclusive of -$168 Million working capital, stood at -$347 Million at March 31, 2015.
This calculation of debt excludes the company's off-balance sheet lease obligations to pay
for drilling and production-related equipment. These obligations total $52.9 Million in 2015
and $96.7 Million in 2016-2017.


After being pushed back for close to one year, two quarters of zero revenues, and having
spent more than $160 Million on development capex since they began development of the
OML, ERN announced on May 18, 2015 that it had successfully completed drilling on the
Oyo #8 oil well. Initial production from this well was 7,080 barrels of oil per day, roughly in
line with management expectations. ERN expects to show production from the Oyo #7 oil
well soon.


Disregarding ERN's liquidity issues, let us assume that ERN can complete the Oyo #7 with
capital on-hand and achieve their production goal for this well of 7,000 barrels of oil per
day, yielding a combined production total of about 14,000 barrels per day. Even under this

fantastical scenario, ERN would still be significantly overvalued on a production basis

exposure to Africa. A particularly close comparison is Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY).

Wow! What a shady bunch of characters! Hard to believe this has a valuation of more than $1 billion! Looks like a

nice work Cannell team,


I just shook my magic 8 ball to see what ERN's future may be, and it came up with the prediction of....
"BANKRUPTCY". The magic 8 ball never lies.


 
astonished this has $1.5b+ valuation. unreal.

rickdplumr1
Are you sure you shook it and didn't smoke it? You are reading your bowling ball now that's astonishing on
any level. Go to your ouija board next or get your palm read either way you'll have an answer by the occult
which is even more delusional than your call of "bankruptcy".

Come on pump stopper, please do some work before saying nonsense, though you do admit you are sniffing
a "magic" 8-ball... 
ERN has a credit facility from Glencore to use for liquidity based on the oil that is filling the FPSO daily, it will
hit 14k bpd production by month-end (run-rate revenue of ~$25m/month), and has a backstop from the
billionaire founder and largest shareholder in any event. There is zero chance it goes b/k.

Well the SHORTsters did their thing and won this very small battle compared to the overall war that longs will
definitely win in the longer term. I'm not gonna waste anymore of my time responding to this obvious mud
flinging by desparate short players who can only stand while the dirt cloud still looms but when the dust
settles ERN will shine again. I will lick my wounds and all the shorts can lick my ....! Enough said!

Some short attacks are more transparent than others. This would be one of those. I would also question why SA feels
it's ethical to preview these obvious hit pieces exclusively to its Pro subscribers to enable them to cash in their profits
before the stock price plunges, as it invariably does in these cases, even if only for awhile.

You guys are clowns. The borrow cost on this stock jumped to over 30% then this piece comes out. In Wall Street the
movie at least they whispered into the phone "Blue Horseshoe". Where is the SEC? Does the SEC need a map? If I
wrote this drivel at work, I'd be fired, fined and then prosecuted. I can't believe a "research piece" so loose with the
facts can actually effect the market. Well clear out retail, move on to the next phase. The company will rise or fall
based on execution of production plans and the average price of oil over the next 5 years. Unless your crystal ball has
clarity on those outcomes you really can't say where this is going. The risk is great, the rewards can be spectacular
but then again this is the Exploration and Production space. If you don't know this what are you doing in the stock to
start with?

I agree. This guy reached deep into his grovel bag for this piece. Quite an imbalanced article, indeed. After a
little more research... There are too many positives not take some interest in a long position. Yes, the AMEX
has kept ERN / CAK listed, despite a low per share value and the SEC has been ever-present. A company
that fits only into the sketch this clown has drafted on them would have been scrutinized and weeded out
years ago, if his stack of facts were worth merit of further review, on their own. I discovered and do find it
interesting that ERN has third party accounting oversight to keep 'em honest, which may illustrate the truth of
interest to keep everything on top of the table, in terms of running an outright ethically managed company
when it may well be that there are real profits on the rise, and a "real" company worth operating in this
manner.


I sure the SEC has all the info and then some... It would sure seem common sense that the ratings writers
understand the game, and have knowledge as well, right?

This company has one of the worst balance sheets I have ever seen with current liabilities exceeding current assets
by about 8:1 versus a typical company having .33-.80. A price to book of 5 is insane compared with the .5-2.0 typical
of energy stocks these days.


05 Jun 2015, 01:35 PM


rickdplumr1
That isn't necessarily the case when small E&P's are in their beginning strong growth phase. Price to book as
well as liab/asset ratios can fluctuate vastly during said phase so I wouldn't consider the numbers "insane" at
all. High risk sure but high reward-coming very soon-quote me on this Mr. IBC (from the root beer people?).

Price to book of Shake Shack 210... i know not an energy company, but when the street sees upside.. doesn't

There are worse out there..

To the Author... Very interesting reporting. There must be some meat here, no doubt. Your opinion is quite
contradictory to Standard and Poor's though, published June second. Other ratings recommend from Hold to Buy. I'll
digest your facts paragraphed here, as a strongly biased opinion and a rain dance for stock price degeneration.
Humorous indeed, yet I agree ERN is not yet the "perfect" stock. From what I can see with a little sifting-through time
here... The Company stands to do quite well... possibly, who knows. All small caps go through these price / valuation

inversions when some real light is shown at the end of the tunnel, No surprise there. I'd really have to take much of
what you said with a fistful of salt, with regard to it's relevance to events overall, bringing the company to where it is
presented to be positioned today, and most certainly to it's potential, like it or not. I am assuming your interests have a
very large stake in de-valuation given the color of you article. Duly noted. Will pursue research based on your
thoughts.

If one has followed this company for nearly a decade, one would not be surprised by much of this, nor would one who
wants to own these kinds of highly speculative shares of a Nigerian oil company. The surprise is that they have
actually pulled it off and making a real go of it. Was it supposed to be easy? This is Nigeria. Try researching American
oil 125 years ago, oh yea, Rockefeller was pure and so was America! And no, he had no political influence or friends
in high places either!!...this is a Frontier markets oil play that is panning out. Sounds like we have a desprate short
seller in our midst. One must tell the whole story, not pick on the negatives, alleged negatives. Why would one short a
company that has finally "struck oil"? There must be better valuation shorts whereby the said company is on the cusp
of failure, not dramatic success. Again, this experienced investor sees a desparate shortseller on the wrong side.
Cover and try elsewere.....know the whole story of Erin please. And understand the risks.

The former President of Shell Oil, John Hofmeister, has been an Independent Director of Erin Energy for some time
now. He is very well regarded in the energy industry. Is it reasonable to think that he would continue in his role at Erin
and risk damaging his reputation, if he thought that their was a serious problem with Erin Management -- and then
remained silent? Why do I get the feeling that the shorts have been getting squeezed, ... and badly need to sing the
bear case?

Since you are questioning reputations, I feel it appropriate to follow up with information found on the web. I too agree
with others who question the merits and intentions of the writer, who is short a company that has risen and has finally
positioned itself for success, perfectly done or not. SA should be to educate and inform, not drive share prices for
specualtors, if that has been the case, I leave it to the reader to determine on their own. I have no comment on the
info I found, but I did find interesting info on google....there was some good stuff too, but why include that...???

It seemed to have panned out for the shorts but I feel things are still heading to the positive with ERN-many
catalysts ahead so best to cover after bogus short biased article has done its minor TEMPORARY trend
reversal-you have been advised so do as you please-this company is doing great things and will have a super
future as things unfold. Consider yourselves warned! 
PS. Thanks for an opportunity to purchase more shares at bargain price

rickdplumr1
Even better-please please give me more cheap shares-short term pain can/will equal longer term gain so
thanks for playing the manipulation game for another day of power buying.

Scathing review of a stock from a short to manipulate the market? Shocker here.. And yes, I use the strong term
"manipulate." This is market manipulation to its simplest form, the "Author" or lack there of, doesn't even recognize
him or herself, only hides behind their company name that manages a meager $300 million in assets.


Although they bring up some points, many are absurd, such as their political contributions, in intangible, flawed
reasoning. ALL E&P companies and their executives contribute to political campaigns. The contributions made by
ERN and their executives is puny in comparison to other oil and gas players such as HAL, XOM, APC, OXY, and the
list goes on... only they give to Democratic parties, instead of Republican as many of E&Ps do, so you only have a
problem with what party they contribute their minor donations? Or are you questioning contributions by all E&P
companies now?


Also I see this is your first article contributed to Seeking Alpha, just at a time when ERN's stock has raced up and is at
a high... good timing, again market manipulation.


I do see your point in bringing in comps and their market values to their production rates, great, you are using one
metric to back up your claims, the only one that is a tangible point that you bring to the table. Where are the metrics
on Tullow's dry holes the last couple years, their massive expenses on dry holes? Same goes with AFREN.. and most
of the others you have on the list? the write down of assets due to these dry holes and adjustments associated with
them? The last year or two has been rampant with exploration failures, something ERN hasn't had to deal with.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3235116-erin-energy-questionable-characters-at-a-stratospheric-valuation 12/17


You bring up accusations on individuals, most prominently Dr. Kase Lawal, most are speculation, rumors, and are
borderline potential slander and hearsay. The politics of oil and energy in Africa has always been strife with shady
dealings, backroom agreements, and handshake deals, but that neither makes them unethical, unlawful, nor a
grounds to attack any individual. Although it is the press's job to go after new stories, I would not want my PM or any
PM to do such a job on a public forum, such as SeekingAlpha, unprofessional, particularly with no other articles under
your belt. Im sure you can go become an investigative journalist if you have the desire, but I wouldn't want my PM
doing it..


You bring up only one valid point, ERN may be over-valued... Great job, isn't the market as a whole over-valued?
many analysts can name hundreds, if not thousands of equities that are currently overvalued... but that is where the
market is at... Sorry, is your next article on the grossly over-valued stock SHAK? we all know that is, but that keeps
going through the roof...


With ERN ramping up to 14k barrels per day and getting a few dollars more per barrel than brent pricing, in a low risk
area, that is not a recipe for liquidity problems or challenges, you may want to pull out your calculator, its simple math,
so you can use your phone actually. And there is nothing wrong with producing or developing proven areas,
particularly when prices are low and you want to chase the low-hanging fruit with a potential added bonus of their
Miocen.


My theory? Cannell Capital's gameplan, they shorted the stock at or abouts $8.70, they all of the sudden published a
scathing article (their first) on a well read forum, such good timing on their end (obviously). Somehow everyone, that
isn't well versed on energy or oil and gas believed it, kudos to you for convincing an audience with this small
published article, you definitely went well above what you even though you could have accomplished. You closed out
your short today around $6.80 and you made your roughly 22% return from a three day investment, not a bad job...
Now you are probably long knowing ERN will be announcing a JV or farm-in partner for their Miocene prospects...


This is a poorly written article, with bad judgements, poor facts, little to no tangible data, poor or wrong comp figures,
omit relevant figures and data, not well versed in only and gas, and may believe the market as a whole is
undervalued, also forcing political agendas on the readers isn't advised. I find when analysts, PMs, or firms write
about equities they are vested in, there is always little to no meat to their assertions...

An interesting exposé. One of the sleazier stories I have heard. Your short bet probably has a greater than 90%
chance of making you a lot of money. These stories all seem to eventually have a similar ending.

Here is something to look at from their most recent financial statement: accounts payable increased in the quarter by
$48,100 yet total operating expenses for the quarter were only $32,031. That suggests to me that they did not pay
one invoice during the quarter and somehow incurred an additional $16 mil of payables beyond what they spent on
operations. Now that has gotta make you wonder....


07 Jun 2015, 02:17 PM


OilEquityGuy
Mr. Wallace,


Could this $16MM be in regards to the contract dispute with Northern Offshore? typically they wouldn't pay an
invoice for a company they are in a dispute/lawsuit with... that could be one easy explanation... so quick to
assumptions.. whats the old saying with "assume"?


08 Jun 2015, 02:47 AM


rickdplumr1
Well Wondering Wally you can choose to look at it any way you want but when the next well (Oyo-7) starts
pumping just wonder what direction the pps is gonna head. Hint: back to the sky!


08 Jun 2015, 01:25 PM


Christopher Wallace, Contributor
Oilequityguy, it could, and perhaps that is your assumption. No assumptions in my comment, just reiterating what their
3/31/15 balance sheet reported.


08 Jun 2015, 11:06 AM


rickdplumr1
With just a hint of SHORT type bending is obvious to assume and another pretty sure assumption-shorts have
had about their last gasp before the trend up continues.

Hmmmm. A company that couldn't make money at $100 oil and people think it will suddenly gush cash at $60 oil.
That's a bet I wouldn't take.

Overall, the bulls on the stock have made personal attacks on Cannell and not disputed any of his facts on the stock.
Just an observation.


10 Jun 2015, 10:35 AM


rickdplumr1
Mr Bungmean (I'm dyslexic)All old news is my observation so it's all been commented on in the distant past-
Cannelly just put all their bend and twist to it and wrote one big short agenda article just after Prosubscribers
got the article so you can observe that coincidence any way you want but anyone with half a brain can put
that together too overall. If I were you I'd keep shorting because it's all coming back and much more. Very
temporary speed bump in a long road paved with gold!

opportunities globally, THIS worthless pos is the single best stock people can find?!?


15 Jun 2015, 11:32 AM


rickdplumr1
Your comment doesn't even warrant a reply as you put it "worthless" can be used to describe "clearly
worthless" post by noted short short minds.

If ERN could only make a donation to the Clinton Foundation, everything would be fine.


16 Jun 2015, 12:00 PM

Sounds like you're the PR for Clinton Foundation and I'm sure will be giving to H. Clinton Campaign too. We

These short attacks -- whether there's any merit to them or not -- tend to accomplish what they set out to do,
at least in the short run. Having learned that lesson the hard way, I sold off all but 500 shares when this piece
first came out, making just shy of $10,000 on the deal. Does this mean I think there's much merit to this article
or its anonymous author? No, it doesn't. Do I hope it enables me to re-buy shares at something near my initial
cost of $3.30? You bet I do.


16 Jun 2015, 02:18 PM

Thanks for the potential to now get in cheap! Keep up the "brilliant" work and keep looking for more of such
awesome opportunities. Can't wait for your next victim.

That is a non-response. They did not refute one allegation nor point out a single "factual errors, misleading
speculation and unwarranted inferences". Fail. Massive fail.

I agree, if Camac hasn't committed outright fraud, Lawal has a long history of being a self dealer and a promoter,
using Camac as his piggy bank.

Its very interesting to see the short trigger such a massive sell off. Its unfortunate that most of the people getting into
this stock do not have a history with doing their diligent research on the stock. Here are a couple of facts to look at:


1. Cash flow positive in a $50 - $60/bbl price environment.


The company is very positive cash flow at $50 - $60/boe Brent given the over $500 million in carry over losses
(Capex/Opex) from the past few years. 
55/bbl Nigeria oil economics % 
Revenue per barrel $65.00 
Nigeria royalty (12%) ($7.80) 12% 
Net Revenue after royalty $57.20 
1 Cost recovery (80%) $45.76 80% $900,000,000 
Profit $11.44 
Tax on Oil (52%) - Petroleum - 50%, Eduxation - 2% ($5.95) 52% 
2 Profit Oil $5.49


Net Cash to Camac $51


60/bbl Nigeria oil economics % 
Revenue per barrel $60.00 
Nigeria royalty (12%) ($7.20) 12% 
Net Revenue after royalty $52.80 
1 Cost recovery (80%) $42.24 80% $900,000,000 
Profit $10.56 
Tax on Oil (52%) - Petroleum - 50%, Eduxation - 2% ($5.49) 52% 
2 Profit Oil $5.07


Net Cash to Camac $47

2. Resource potential - sitting on a potential 3 billion barrels of resource is no small feat, ask major players Shell,
Exxon, BP. Geologically speaking OML 120/121 sit in or around the famous Agbami, ERHA and BONGA all producing
over 100,000 bbls/d for over 5 years. Also check DeGoyer and MacNaughton, the resource expects that have high
graded the resource potential. Also, a well drilled in 2013 test the deeper pay zone and this increased the resource
potential and further derisked the basin.


3. Comparison to Afren is rather lame, Afren is indebted over $1 billion and cannot boast of such a proven resource
potential, Tullow also cannot boast of the same resource potential. The price tag on this stock is not only based on
current production but also resource/reserve production.


4. Ghana provides opportunity for short term positive cash flow as the fields resources are already de risked.


I have been long CAK now ERIN since 2010 and have significantly increased my position over the past years, this is
not a play for short term valuation but more for long term play. The CEO has been focused with the strategy to
carefully develop the field and the in flow of the south african investment fund has significantly increased cash
available for further development of the Oyo field. Oyo field cash generation will finance the exploration program in
2015 and a discovery of anything over 250 mmboe should significantly bolster the balance sheet with further upside if
a farm out happens.


17 Jun 2015, 03:59 PM


Rufiji
You need to more than double your field costs and then a year's worth of 14kbopd at $65 cannot even cover
the payables due at March 31 2015.


Of course flow rates at Oyo 5&6 declined rapidly despite a gas injection well and a workover on Oyo 5.


The current setup doesn't even have the much vaunted water injection well and there is no money for it.


The company belongs to Zenith Bank and they are welcome to it.
