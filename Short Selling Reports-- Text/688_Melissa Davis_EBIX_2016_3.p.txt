Ebix: The Waiting Is The Hardest Part
Feb. 16, 2016 1:58 PM ET63 comments
by: Melissa Davis


Summary


Ebix has already blown its chance to meet the wild expectations that it recently set
for its most celebrated business deal.


The company has yet to officially test - let alone launch - a new e-trading platform
that was supposed to start generating “substantial revenue” at the beginning of this
year.


After winning the bid for that big-ticket deal based upon its “tried and tested”
technology, Ebix faced demands for a “complete rebuild” of its outdated platform
instead.


Looking somewhat desperate, Ebix recently offered to purchase a well-established
rival that has won over a growing crowd of loyal customers since it lost the bid for
that overseas contract.


Nine months after reporting that it had reached “very advanced states of contract
finalization,” Ebix continues to wait for a formal contract that outlines the financial
terms of that deal.


If Ebix (NASDAQ: EBIX) feels tempted to brag about its most celebrated project again, the
company might want to bite its tongue. The last few times that Ebix discussed the
electronic trading platform that it has agreed to provide for the London insurance market,
the company made some wildly optimistic predictions that now look totally divorced from
reality.


During its most recent quarterly conference call, Ebix really tested its luck. With less than
two months left on the 2015 calendar, Ebix confidently reported that it remained on
schedule to launch its revolutionary e-trading platform - and start generating "substantial
revenue" from that new service - by the first of this year. Given the current status of that
project, however, Ebix must (or at least should) have known that the company stood little,
if any, realistic chance of actually meeting that lofty goal.

While Ebix has shared no further updates on that overseas project, despite a request to
do so for this article, a London-based trade publication focused on the insurance industry
last week revealed the following:


Ebix has fallen behind schedule on that elaborate project because (as predicted by this
author last spring) the company basically needed to start over and build a new e-
trading platform from scratch. Although Ebix reportedly won the bid for that big-ticket
project based upon the "tried and tested" nature of its existing technology, the
company soon found itself forced to replace its outdated platform with a modern
solution instead.
As of last week, Ebix had yet to even begin testing its platform in a pilot program that it
was originally scheduled to take place during the fourth quarter of last year. Under the
revised schedule set forth by Private Placement Limited (PPL), the organization in
charge of the project, Ebix will now aim to start that overdue pilot program by the end
of the month - although "some in the market remain skeptical about the initiative" - if it
possibly can.
Ebix remains in limbo, too. A year after landing that big-ticket project, Ebix continues to
wait for PPL to nail down all of the agreements that it needs in order to present the
company with a formal contract that spells out the financial terms of that high-profile
deal.


Ebix sure has sparked a lot of controversy since the company won the PPL deal, though.
Just listen to some of the complaints voiced by London market experts who clearly resent
Ebix and/or expect its new e-trading platform to fail.


"The (request for proposals) process stated that the PPL board wanted a tried and
tested platform and would not accept new technology," one industry expert reminded
The Insurance Insider in that same article, a story published last week but widely
overlooked outside of the London insurance industry up to now. "But Ebix is now
using a brand-new platform and has ended up with a very expensive new piece of
kit, which is not ready to use. They have basically broken everything they said they
were going to do."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3899006-ebix-waiting-hardest-part 3/16


Unwilling to wait around for Ebix to roll out its overdue platform, the publication further
reported, industry players have flocked to a competing system operated by rival
Xchanging - the very company that Ebix beat out to win the PPL deal - or searched for
other alternatives instead.


"Every company thinks that it has the best technology and will not want to join a
common tech platform," a senior market executive declared in the story. "That would
just be a competitive disadvantage."


So "we're seeing people do placing on other platforms," another industry source added. "I
know the Xchanging reinsurance platform has now placed many billions of dollars of their
reinsurance programs" all by itself.


No wonder Ebix recently decided to launch a bid for Xchanging that, if successful, would
have allowed the company to claim all of that business as its own. During a conference
call that it hosted 10 days before it entered that bidding war, Ebix had given investors
every reason to believe that its widely anticipated e-trading platform would soon hit the
London insurance market and provide the company with a powerful new revenue stream.


For a company running so far behind schedule, Ebix sounded awfully confident.


"I am pleased to report that we continue to work aggressively towards the date of 1
of January of 2016 in terms of getting the PPL solution ready for prime time," Ebix
CEO Robin Raina declared less than two months ahead of that looming deadline.
"Our dedicated team of technology staff, both in London and offshore, have been
working closely with the PPL program management group to ensure that we are
ready with all their enhancement requests and additional functionality requests by
their intended effective date of 1 of January of 2016. We expect the deal to
contribute substantial revenue in the beginning of Q1 of 2016 and (provide) a
consistent recurring and predictive momentum" from there.


Maybe Ebix should have tried a little harder to gain control of Xchanging by sweetening its
offer for the company before it ran out of time. With Ebix stuck on the sidelines for the past
year, trying to build an elaborate new e-trading platform that it still needs to test,
Xchanging has rushed to take advantage of that generous head-start by recruiting a crowd
of customers to its rival platform and hooking them on its own e-placing services instead.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3899006-ebix-waiting-hardest-part 4/16


Big surprise. Both Xchanging and its partner, The Insurance Workplace (TIW), remained
confident in the prospects for their rival e-trading solution - and determined to aggressively
grow their competing business - even after losing out on the PPL deal with a proposal that
many actually regarded as superior.


"We have our own placing solution in use by a number of brokers, which we believe
is superior in many ways to their offering," TIW Chief Executive Officer David
Edward proclaimed a few months after Ebix walked away with the PPL deal. "We are
not going anywhere, and will continue to develop our portfolio of electronic trading
solutions for our clients in London and around the world."


Not that Ebix seemed the least bit concerned at the time. Offering no sign that it even
sensed any danger, Ebix responded with the first in a string of encouraging updates about
its elusive PPL contract instead.


"There has been a lot of speculation on the size of the deal, the public
announcement, the timeline for the contract and the backing that the aggregation
exchange will receive in the London market," Ebix CEO Robin Raina stated in a
conference call hosted by the company more than nine months ago. "Let me confirm
that we are at very advanced states of contract finalization with PPL, while PPL is
working through the cost allocation with its 150-plus key market participants … While
we cannot reveal the size of the contract at present, let me just say that the five-year
contract is likely to have substantial guaranteed annual revenues associated with it
from inception, as the intent is to aggregate the London market on this exchange."


"We expect to make a public announcement on the details of the arrangement jointly
with PPL, once that contract is formally signed … The basic delay is not associated
with the contract finalization. (Indeed), I wouldn't even call it a delay" at all.


Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article.

Nice disclosure. Seems honest. It's just too bad you weren't able to write this in time to inform all the foolish
institutional investors who have piled into Ebix in the last 6 months. In fact, theres a new 6% stake 13D just today! Lol.

Hey MElissa;


Right on time for another useless article filled with your own verison of a heapping helping of hot steaming crapola.


As EBIX hits new highs I find it hard to think you have any influence over this stock anymore, I hope you can sleep at
night knowing that you caused many poor retail to short EBIX and as it hits new highs new want them to bail you out
again.


Shame on you, your mother must be very embarrassed of her daughter.

You'd think the "author" would give up after multiple failed short and distort articles. Company has ripped from $13 to
$38 while this "author" has published complete manipulative BS.


Company is trading below a market multiple and no reason for a big decline. I did recently sell 75% of my large
position purchased at average of $15. Sold for due to general wariness of macro and desire to lock in long term gain.
Going to closely monitor price to see if any uniformed sell based on this (cough, cough) well written piece. May buy
back.


Melissa, there is an old saying "if you find your self in a hole, stop digging"

Yes, EBIX up 4% as I type this comment which shows how much the market cares about what Ms. Davis has to say
about EBIX today in her article.. All anyone has to do is look at Ms.Davis' track record. She has published quite a few
negative articles on EBIX over the last few years, and so far not a single prediction or allegation that she has made
has been true or come to pass. Who do believe the EBIX CEO who has delivered on every single promise he has
ever made for longer than a decade and never once did not deliver exceeding projections on any quarterly earnings
report, or Ms. Davis who has never once been right about a single allegation or prediction that she has made about
EBIX for the last several years. Game over Ms. Davis, and you are nothing more than a blowhard whom has
absolutely no credibility, and who the entire investment community now laughs at as evidenced by the impact you had
today on EBIX PPS when your bogus article was released. Keep barking at the moon you dog!


16 Feb 2016, 02:36 PM

Ms. Davis ONLY publish short articles here and ONLY about EBIX. She already disclosed being a paid
employee of the short consortium as well. And she doesn't reply to comments at all, none.


So, anyone can give any credibility to her claims? I don't think so.

Interesting facts, though largely negligible. Ebix is trading at 15 Times TTM Earnings. TTM that is, meaning earnings
derived from activities that already existed prior to the PPL contract. Activities which are very profitable and growing.
PPL would be a nice add-on and nothing is to say it's doomed. It's not the first time a technology company is a
Quarter behind on delivering on a deadline. And cherry-picking negative comments gives a false picture.

In any case, how does it feel to be a laughingstock of the investment community? You shamefully hide and never

SA favors shorts more than anyone. I actually think they are short in several companies like EBIX, PBR,

I am beginning to think that this may be true. I remember one article by someone else about a different stock.
Though some facts were given, so was a great deal of innuendo and just plain mud slinging. In the greater
scheme of things, I would call it a hatchet job. I was stupid enough to say so and in not especially nice terms.
SA censored my comments and warned me. To some extent that may have been justified actually. Though I
have seen as bad or worse throughout various SA threads. I guess that what really hacked them off with me

@Melissa Your 'source' Insurance Insider gets virtually everything wrong, including the dates of the EBIX/XCH
deadlines. 
See post on my ebix article that has quotes from them.


Also your tactic of using a source that is 'undisclosed people with inside knowledge' is actually laughable. Do you
honestly people to transact on your dodgy hearsay....


You claim EBIX used its "old technology" on PPL. But later you claim your source said:  
""But Ebix is now using a brand-new platform and has ended up with a very expensive new piece of kit..."


Melissa why dont you be consistent in your lies - its very confusing!!

dont even have an investment account. But is it true that you received no compensation fir writing this drivel? I find

Ms. Davis' articles have proven time and again to be filled with outright lies, distortions, and deceit. She has
never been truthful or fair in anything that she has written about EBIX. As such, why would you believe her
when she says she has no position in EBIX and is not being paid to write these articles? She has proven
herself a liar so no reason to not think she is lying about her position in EBIX and how she is being
compensated for writing these articles. According to her, she just loves to write these very negative articles
about EBIX for personal recreation because she has no interest in EBIX and is not being paid to write these
articles. The only thing dumber than her claiming such things is her misguided belief that people would
actually believe her as a proven liar.

Well, here is some proof that Ms. Davis is lying and that the London PPL is doing just fine and moving rapidly forward
on implementation. This is from the same source, Insurance Insider, that Ms. Davis quotes in this article:


" Matthew Neill 23 February 2016


The London Market Group (LMG)'s new Placing Platform Limited (PPL) electronic placing platform was demonstrated
for the first time yesterday (22 February).


There are a number of further demonstrations scheduled for this week, with the PPL focusing on groups that have
been closely involved with the project's development.


It will be demonstrated to terrorism practitioners, subject matter experts, project managers and those who have
agreed to take part in the market acceptance testing process."

From the FAQ pdf document on the London Market Groups website, updated Jan 2016:


"What has been done to improve the usability of the platform? 
EBIX has worked extensively with representatives of several brokers and carriers to enhance usability and are
creating a unified front end from quote to bind.


Will PPL still support my Webcon gateway and MMT? 
Will my underwriters be able to respond via my Webcon MMT or will they have to login to Ebix? 
How can I download data and documents from Ebix when a risk / endorsement is agreed without the underwriter
having to do this themselves? 
Subject to testing, Yes. 
If you are currently able to perform these actions then PPL will continue to allow this, subject to testing. 
All Users, once registered and logged-in, can upload and download documents. 
For further information or specific queries please contact ppl@londonmarketgroup....


The exact structure of the web services will be agreed with Ebix, and all data elements must conform to ACORD
standards. It will be an individual broking organisations choice as to whether the minimum viable product level of
integration is implemented, but it is expected that the four sponsoring brokers will do so. The timetable for the
specification and development of additional integration options will be established by the end of 2016."

From the CEO on the CC:


"The whole thing [PPL] is going extremely well overall.


Clearly from our perspective you see the platform is 100% ready. It’s been fully tested. As you know, lot of people are
already using the platform. And having said that, it’s been a phenomenal experience still now. And we're very pleased
with how the uptake has been The whole thing is going extremely well overall."


This entire article appears nothing less than an attempt to mislead, misinform and manipulate the market on Ebix
shares. Surely there is some violation of law? @Editors there must be something you can do about it. Please advise.

The editors will not do anything about this because SA is complicit in this thinly veiled attempt to mislead and

several claims I could bring against SA and likely prevail for deliberately publishing these kinds of false
articles with full knowledge that they contain false information and in complete reckless disregard of the truth.
SA needs to sued civilly and prosecuted criminally because it has wiped out untold millions of dollars from
investors by publishing these kind of false articles without making any reasonable attempt to fact check them.

Agree 100% Stuart. I like SA for the quality of some articles and mainly the comments, but as a company,
they are known to have preferences for shorts, I don't doubt they work with them against some companies
(say EBIX, UEPS, PBR) and even have open positions accordingly (as a company or individuals). I wish one
day someone sue the hell out of them.

Well said, Sunil, Stuart, and HerrX. Journalistic integrity and accountability are important. Being wrong is one thing.
Deliberate bias and publication of deceitful information is another. If there are no legal ramifications, I strongly suspect
there are karma ones.


As a long who put in hundreds if hours of research into Ebix, I'm happy to be vindicated. However, I'm even happier
for Raina and the employees of Ebix, who have put FAR more effort into building this amazing company that actually
creates a product/service that benefits the world.

@TexLong 
totally agree. The personal allegations against Raina, who is a devout philanthropist, must have been
particularly painful. As a result, I'm sure its personal for him, to vindicate Ebix and his personal integrity. All
the better for shareholders...


The short squeeze is getting tighter. Still about 15 days of trading short. Wow!!

Waiting is the easy part for me. Great company with great management. I bought at $13.56 in 2014 and enjoy the
160% gain. Every great stock has their Melissa's. That is why Buffett promotes doing your own research.

So are you going to write another?


Remember the movie Animal House when FLounder says " This is great!!!", well this is great!!

I hope so, because the share price is sliding. Need the Melissa leap following the article.

I think this wraps up this comment thread succinctly:


David Ledger, Chairman of PPL commented: "We are delighted that the contract has been signed. Ebix has been
really supportive through the process and worked closely with the PPL team to make sure the project stayed on track.
We are excited about working with them to take the launch forward, and are confident that the combination of their
technology and the market's insurance expertise will make for a world class solution which will make London an
easier place to do business."

Pretty bearish action today in Ebix; only $45. Great call by the "author". Can we get a comment from that Anthar guy
whose been calling fraud since $15 lol

Thanks Melissa!, your articles continue to give me the fortitude to hold my position. I would have taken profits long
ago if it wasn't for you!

Before, I was holding for the short squeeze. But operationally these guys are doing great in a no growth
economy. And this is organic not acquisitions.

Yes, it was hard to wait for the profits. But the story has just begun.


Good to see Shorts loosing their shirts, especially deceitful manipulative shorts who piled on to EBIX.

Waiting two months for the announcement that the contract is signed and will generate upwards of $15M annually in
revenue under a subscription model was not hard! Back to the drawing board for the author this company is surging
right now.

@Melissa 3 words to say to you: Another profession maybe?


16 Apr 2016, 09:50 AM


disclosure101
Come on everyone, give Melissa a break. Hasn't everyone here had written a series of "reports" over three years
where every single word has been wrong? Oops... guess not! This contract as announced is in-line with what Ebix
has guided. They actually... have a track record of delivering, unlike certain others!


16 Apr 2016, 02:03 PM


Pepijn De Korte, Contributor
Jee Melissa, since you wrote this article EBIX is up by over 60%. That is 60% in 2 months and in a flat market. Are
you still short or are you sticking to your guns?


19 Apr 2016, 01:14 PM


BienVista Research, Contributor
Shorts here are going to burst soon, unless they have unlimited pockets, their losses are astounding so far, and
mounting every day.


19 Apr 2016, 03:56 PM


The Protagonist, Contributor
Did you guys see SDRL short covering 2 months ago. It went up 300% or so. 
This will happen here too.


This is why RR didn't sell the company 2 years ago. And was buying shares around $33 in the last year. Patience for
a business to do deals and grow.

EBIX is now up 55% since the publication of this article, in the space of approximately 2 months, and the PPL contract
has officially been signed. Until you can offer a response to being this catastrophically wrong, how can you justify ever
publishing another article about EBIX? Or really, any other stock. Or opinion on anything. To throw something out and
be so consistently wrong, and take no time to reevaluate your thesis, shows a lack of forecasting and critical thinking
abilities that is not acceptable for anyone claiming to be a professional.


It's articles like this which make me wish for a score keeping system on this and all sites. Declare your target forecast
(of which there is none in this article, of course) and the website will keep a running tally of your prediction. Maybe at
the end of each quarter, provide a leader board and loser board. A -55%+ prediction in less than a quarter is
impressively awful. That's not even considering what the price target may have been. -10%? -20%? You're looking at
a difference of 65-75% *in one single quarter*. This is a historically incorrect answer which usually precedes the
unemployment line, or at the very least, laughing stock status (see: Dick Morris).


By the way, it's ok to be wrong. That's how we learn. But you have to critically analyze your decisions and figure out
where and why you went wrong. To throw them into the winds of the internet and let them scatter where they may
without any concern of the outcome is wrong. You are a bad analyst and should not do this any more if that's the
case. The world doesn't need any more falsely positive blowhards. There's still time though. You can still go back and
figure out what part of your thesis was wrong and publish the results.


I'm sure that almost no one will read this comment in a 2 month old article, but maybe someday SA (along with other
sites) will do the right thing and start taking contributors to task for their failures.

Selectman, 
As you are no doubt aware, this was just the latest in a series of articles that Melissa has written on Ebix,
each rife with unsubstantiated allegations. In fact, the provable allegations have consistently been proven
false. This is but the latest example. 
I for one do not believe that her intent has ever been to get it right. We can each come to our own conclusions
why someone would continue to do this yet never own or even acknowledge their prior writings that have
been proven wrong. Your point is a good one.


25 Apr 2016, 02:28 PM


TheGribbler
Melissa's motives may be driven by the fact that SA pays its authors something like $0.01 per impression for
articles like these. After a career of layoffs and firings from the Oklahoman (newspaper) and Street Sweeper,
sadly she may be happy pinching these pennies rather than acknowledging any form of intellectual honesty or
analyst ethics.

Was at $32 when this article was written 1.8 years ago the stock is now at $76 is itzcash or whatever the acquisition
you were looking for  
I’ll have to look back at your negative EBIX articles to see acquisitions gains & stock price.. it’s funny you can usually
be right about a Co like this just throwing darts eventually, and it had its question years I’ve owned since 09’ & could
maybe make up a better long article using just as many fact- non facts? As long as sound like I know what I’m talking
about!

Yeah, this article was crazy back when it was written. It's hilarious now looking back on our extremely difficult
"wait". EBIX looks much stronger today.

By the way, Melissa Davis is no longer listed on Street Sweeper's website.


Street Sweeper now tracks the performance of the stocks they put on blast - noticeably missing from that list
is EBIX

It's amazing short interest in EBIX is still quite high.
