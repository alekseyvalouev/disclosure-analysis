A rolling loan gathers no loss 
On January 30, 2018 Viceroy Research released our report on Capitec (JSE:CPI) citing a need for large 


impairments and regulatory intervention. Our report can be viewed in its entirety at: www.viceroyresearch.org  


The issues expressed by Viceroy have been reflected in a letter from Benguela Global Fund Managers to Capitec 


also raising concerns about Capitec’s lending practices1. This report presents the results of Viceroy’s further 


investigation into Capitec and a rebuttal of Capitec’s responses to Viceroy and Benguela. 


▪ Since the publication of our last report, Capitec has disclosed that an extraordinarily large portion of its 


subprime, highly indebted customers who miss payments on their loans are somehow able to find the 


money to "catch up" or "cure" their arrears. This is suspicious.  


- Numerous former Capitec staff and 5 prominent debt counselling firms with proprietary datasets on 


South African unsecured lending support our thesis that this “curing” method is how Capitec hides the 


disastrous underlying performance of its loan book. If a borrower in arrears is able to beg or borrow the 


funds from a secondary lender to pay down their arrears and make themselves “current”, Capitec 


immediately offers them a new, larger loan. The borrowers use this new, larger Capitec loan to pay off 


the secondary lender used to cover the arrears.  


- Analysis of tens of thousands of Capitec borrowers’ datasets within debt counselling firms show 


consumers were able to get new loans after paying down their arrears the day prior. Thus, we can 


state empirically that this practice is still occurring. We contrast this with the lending criteria of a 


Standard Bank or Absa where there is a "cooling off" period before a borrower formerly in arrears can 


seek a new loan - to prevent exactly this behavior. By offering upsized loans to people who have just 


cleared their arrears, Capitec management is able to say with a straight face that they do "not lend 


into arrears". This is TRUE in fact - but not in substance. 


- While the borrower is getting more and more indebted and is still unable to pay their debts, lending to 


people who were immediately prior in allows Capitec to artificially generate "cures”, unsustainably 


increase its loan book, charge massive initiation fees and create a façade of quality within its consumer 


base. 


- Well over half (70% - 80%) of Capitec consumers in debt counselling were issued new loans prior to 


repaying their existing loans. 


▪ Viceroy have obtained communications from Capitec Head Office dated 8 February 2018 to local branches 


advising that it has amended the number of allowable loans per customer. Reading between the lines, 


Capitec appear to be tightening or relaxing lending rules in order to achieve the greatest possible return 


as opposed to the consumers ability to repay those loans. 


▪ Viceroy has obtained evidence of Capitec intentionally abusing the debit order system to ensure its debits 


take priority ahead of other lenders. 


▪ Following the publication of our last statement several media outlets have reported on CEO Gerrie Fourie’s 


purchase of ZAR 1.5m of Capitec shares on the open market, presenting this as a show of faith in the 


company. We believe this is intentionally narrow-minded when viewed in the context of the net market sale 


of ZAR 49m worth of Capitec shares by Fourie in 2017. Collectively, directors sold ZAR 406m Capitec shares 


on market in 2017 alone. 


▪ We respond systematically to Capitec's poorly constructed rebuttal of our prior report.

Capitec’s behavior has led to material overstatement of the quality of the book and substantial under-


provisioning. We note the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) described Capitec as being liquid and solvent on 


the basis "of the available information". Evidence suggests the available information is being deliberately 


distorted by Capitec management and we believe that as a matter of prudential supervision the SARB must 


investigate the lending practices at Capitec. We are providing this data to SARB and the NCR. 


Viceroy continues to believe that Capitec is fundamentally uninvestable and reiterate our 


recommendation that an investigation by an independent body is launched in the face of 


the evidence presented in our research.

Capitec’s response to Benguela 
In response to a letter addressed to Capitec by Benguela Global Fund Managers, Capitec issued a response 


addressing what was perceived to be excessive rescheduling estimates. Capitec’s letter showed its calculations: 





 
Figures 1, 2 & 3 Extract from Capitec’s response to Benguela Global Fund Mangers2  


It is apparent is that, ON CAPITEC’S OWN NUMBERS, A VALUE EQUAL TO ONE THIRD OF 


ITS GROSS LOAN BOOK FALLS INTO ARREARS EACH YEAR. 


This is a massive number, and has been derived directly from Capitec’s response to 


Benguela. 


Capitec themselves have represented a gross portfolio where a value equivalent to at least one third of the 


unsecured, subprime retail consumer loan gross loan book falls into delinquency each year.  Despite 


management rhetoric, this does not make Capitec comparable to major banks. 


The largest difference between Benguela and Capitec’s estimate of rescheduling as a percentage of arrears is 


Capitec’s curing numbers, which represent the value of loans which went into arrears and were subsequently

Viceroy Research Group 4 viceroyreseach.org 


“cured”. We found it extremely odd that such a high number of majority low-income, subprime consumers 


have the financial means to cure their arrears. 


Viceroy have calculated the number of new arrears value to August 2017 per the below table: 





We find it curious that Capitec chooses to disclose a rough estimate of cured loans when actual figures would 


presumably be easily accessible through management accounts. In its estimation calculation, Capitec’s 


purported “conservative” time-frame under which arrears are cured plays favor to this figure: 


 
Figure 4 Extract from Capitec’s response to Benguela Global Fund Mangers 


If we adjust Capitec’s estimate calculation to reflect their assertion that most clients in arrears cure their loans 


within a month, we end up with a much higher and purportedly more accurate assumption of cured loans:  





Given this rate of mass delinquencies on a subprime loan book, Viceroy do not buy the story that these most 


financially at-risk consumers are able to simply cure their delinquencies within one month, especially in light 


of the evidence in our original report which clearly shows that Capitec have a history of providing new loans to 


consumers in order to repay old loans.  


Since the publication of our report former and current customers and employees have reached out to Viceroy 


to corroborate our thesis and provide evidence to that effect. Viceroy will, with permission from those who 


have reached out, provide this evidence to SARB and NCR.

How to cure a loan – Capitec channel checks 
Viceroy have interviewed numerous debt counsellors, former Capitec branch managers and salespeople to 


deep-dive into how Capitec’s unsecured short- and medium-term consumer loans could have such high “cure” 


rates on delinquencies. 


Capitec adamantly claims it does not issue new loans to clients in arrears anymore - we provided objective 


evidence that it had done so in the past in the form of numerous affidavits with supporting documentation. 


However, Capitec may be technically right in saying that behavior does not occur at the moment. Instead, they 


have found a far cleverer way to achieve the same effect while allowing them the ability to deny any lending 


into arrears. Numerous former Capitec employees have informed us that it is common practice to issue debt to 


consumers who were in arrears one day earlier, so long as they had "cured" the arrears on their existing loan.  


We are not exaggerating when we say clients who cured loans one day were granted new loans the next: this is 


a frequent occurrence. Tens of thousands of Capitec borrowers’ datasets and analysis obtained from debt 


counsellors suggest a vast number of customers who cure their arrears are immediately extended new loans. 


On a broader level 70-80% of debt counselling clients from Capitec were issued incremental loans prior to 


repaying their existing loans. 


Debt counsellors we have spoken to have provided Viceroy with data sets in order to corroborate the existence 


and vast extent of this behavior. Former Capitec staff also corroborated these practices.  


Customers who were going into arrears (or expected to go into arrears) extended their loans by making their 


account current (i.e. curing the loan). How can these financially distressed clients make their loans current? 


Former staff – perhaps misguidedly – bragged about how quickly they could help their customer process a new 


loan if they were to fall (or about to fall) into arrears. 


Former staff and managers also revealed to Viceroy the vast network of less legitimate loan sharks, 


unconventional sources of credit, and informal rotating credit unions known as “Stokvel” that are routinely used 


to pay off arrears on consumer loans. These systems essentially obfuscate the true nature of consumer debt. 


Documents provided to Viceroy also show Capitec abusing the debit order dispute system in order to ensure 


their loan repayments take priority over those of other lenders when the funds in the client’s account are 


insufficient. The client is then granted to subsequently pay the disputed valid debit orders. Capitec is lending to 


a client they know cannot meet their fiscal obligations and profiting at the expense of other banks placing the 


client in a debt spiral. Given these loans would be registered in the national database, we believe this abuse of 


the system is intentional.  


Debit order disputes 
Bank statements and pay slips of Capitec clients provided to Viceroy show that Capitec abusing the debit order 


dispute system in order to sell further credit and ensure their payment before other lenders. More concerningly, 


these pay slips already had garnishee orders from 2 other lenders implying they had already fallen into arrears 


before. 


The debit order dispute abuse surprised us the most as there is a clear criminal element to the creative 


procedure which is coordinated by Capitec staff. 


Capitec loans are tied to a client’s Capitec bank account and the bank can draw its repayments from the client’s 


account directly. When the fees and repayments to other lenders surpass the amount in the bank account 


required to pay back Capitec loans, Capitec staff have disputed debit orders on the client’s account to 


temporarily make up the balance, cure the Capitec loan arrears, and issue a new loan to pay what were in fact 


legitimate debit orders. 


So that readers can get an idea of how blatant this activity is, we have included an example. To protect the 


identity of the customer, Viceroy has redacted the client’s identifying information in the documents below:
Viceroy Research Group 6 viceroyreseach.org 


 
Figure 5 Extract from Capitec customer bank statement provided to Viceroy 


Above you can see disputed debit orders against microlenders Capfin3 and Cobol4 in segments 1 and 2. Those 


who have read Viceroy’s report on Steinhoff will recognize Capfin as a Steinhoff subsidiary. At the time of the 


above Capfin was operating as a listed entity in Bermuda controlled by Christo Wiese, who was a de-facto major 


shareholder of Capitec and previously on the board of PSG.  


The reversal of these debit orders allowed the client to repay their multi-loan instalment to Capitec to the sum 


of ZAR 3,142.72 in segment 3. Capitec on the same day issued the client a new multi loan to the value of ZAR 


2,700 visible in segment 4. 


What is most concerning is that these disputed debit orders are to other credit providers. In essence, Capitec is 


facilitating the reversal of legitimate debit orders made to their competitors for loans they know exist, as they 


are listed on the National Loans Register. 


These disputes would have to be entered by a Capitec employee. Therefore, not only would Capitec have known 


about outstanding debt with Cobol and Capfin, but an affordability assessment would also show that this client 


had garnishee orders with two other lenders! 


This implies the client had already gone into arrears at these two credit providers.

Viceroy Research Group 7 viceroyreseach.org 


Essentially, Capitec granted a loan to a client who was delinquent with 2 loans (per garnishee orders in figure 5 


above) by cancelling debit orders (making the client delinquent in 4 loans) in order to make the client “current” 


in Capitec’s loan book. The bank then sold further credit to the client to settle their other loans.  


The contents above directly contradict Capitec’s assertion: 


 
Figure 7 Extract from Capitec response to Viceroy 


Capitec’s assertion that it is lending to only the best clients absolutely collapses in the face of this evidence as 


the bank would have had to have been provided pay slips and access to the client’s account. Capitec would have 


to have known the client was unable to meet his monthly obligations and extended a loan anyway. 


Pre-empting a response from Capitec that this is an isolated incident and that this example is in the past: it is 


not. In our discussions with debt counsellors and former staff these are not isolated incidents and in the words 


of a former staff member the practice is currently happening “all the time”.  


Court filings from cases referred to in our previous report suggest that the manner in which Capitec aggressively 


collects repayments directly from client bank accounts may be skirting the National Payment Systems Act 


requirement to treat those collecting money via debit order equally:
Viceroy Research Group 8 viceroyreseach.org 


 
Figures 8, 9 & 10 Thobejane Application High Court 


We further question whether other lenders approve of this historical and ongoing abuse of their debit order 


dispute systems. 


Alternative sources of finance 
Viceroy was informed that in close vicinity to many Capitec branches, consumers have a variety of alternative 


sources of finance. This could be anything from other microlenders, pawn shops or less legitimate loan sharks. 


These financiers can provide very short-term loans with massive fees attached in order for delinquent Capitec 


clients to repay arrears, become current on their existing loan and take out a further loan with Capitec. A portion 


of the new loan is used to fix the alternative short-term finance, the rest contributes to the debt black hole which 


many customers are already in. 


Stokvel 
South Africans will be familiar with the concept of a Stokvel, which is essentially a community group where 


members contribute to a fund5. Members are paid lump sums on a rotating basis, meaning there is liquid cash 


available for any member to use on a short-term basis. 


Former Capitec staff advised that many Stokvel members would draw from the fund intra-day in order to repay 


arrears and extend a further loan facility by the next day in order to repay the Stokvel (with interest).

Viceroy Research Group 9 viceroyreseach.org 


Staff incentives 
Channel checks with debt counselling firms and former Capitec staff have revealed staff incentives designed to 


sell the maximum amount of credit from each customer regardless of their ability to repay these loans. Below 


are their observations:  


- Staff are encouraged to capture at least 2 referrals for each new savings or loan account opened. This 


number is increased if the client works for the South African government.  


- Referrals are generally required to be contacted within 2 days, encouraged to open a Capitec account and 


later pursued as targets for Capitec loans. 


- Clients not currently using short-term loan facilities are contacted and reminded that the facility is available. 


This corroborates our previous channel checks indicating that Capitec staff are being used as a sales force 


as opposed to their customer service role. 


- Pay raises are dependent on credit issued to clients. Failure to extend the maximum amount a client 


qualifies for is classed as an undersell and reflected upon in performance reviews. 


Capitec’s staff are heavily incentivized to sell as much credit as possible, using underhanded methods to keep 


those accounts current. This is corroborated by Capitec’s puzzling statements in its 2016 annual report: 





 
Figures 11 & 12 - Extract from Capitec Annual Report 2016 


Reading between the lines, Capitec appears to be relaxing or tightening lending rules in order to achieve the 


greatest possible return on equity as opposed to the consumer’s ability to repay those loans. 


Affordability checks 
While the above activities appear to be reckless, a failing of the National Credit Act essentially facilitates this 


excessing lending behavior despite the introduction of regulated affordability assessments. Affordability checks 


and minimum expense checks have been regulated to a very relaxed degree. Below are the National Credit Act 


minimum monthly expense tables:
Viceroy Research Group 10 viceroyreseach.org 


 
Figure 13 Minimum monthly expense tables 


𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 + (𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 × 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑦 𝑓𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 


Essentially if a client in the ZAR 6,250 to ZAR 25,000 net monthly income range wishes to claim their expenses 


are less than ZAR 1,1167.88 they must fill out a form proving this to be true. 


In reality, it’s a little more complicated than that: debt counsellors and former staff suggest that an expense 


percentage of net monthly income can be and is stretched up to 91%. 


This regulation asserts that a loan whose repayments consume 91% of an individual’s income is “affordable”. In 


reality this is obviously not the case, especially within the demographic of Capitec’s largely low-income band. 


Viceroy was informed the average income of a Capitec customer undergoing debt counselling is roughly ZAR 


11,000 a month. 


Of course, if a client confides in a salesperson that their expenses are above 9% of their income, the salesperson 


is compelled to believe them. This rarely happens as both parties have aligned interests: the consumer wants 


money, and the salesperson wants to lend as much money as possible per incentives described above. 


Former Capitec staff and branch managers confirmed, again, that this happens “all the time”. 


Debt counsellors we have spoken to have advised that incoming clients’ loans typically consume 50%-70% of 


their income, and that Capitec clients are incoming at increasing rates to clients of any other microlender. While 


Capitec may not be in breach of the technical nature of the law, they are clearly not acting in a consumer’s best 


interest by putting them in cyclical debt. 


Further, debt counsellors have advised that debt counselling works by reducing or eliminating Capitec interest 


and extending loans for repayments to reach a real affordable level. This real affordable level is generally ~30% 


of income consumed by debt repayments and this is achieved by reducing interest rates to near zero. This does 


not corroborate with Capitec claims that only their most creditworthy customers qualify for their longer-term 


loans: it is the exact opposite.
Viceroy Research Group 11 viceroyreseach.org 


Growing number of loans in counselling 
Debt counsellors we have spoken to advise that not only are their number of Capitec clients increasing 


substantially faster than any other lender, but also that the number of loans taken out by each Capitec customer 


is also increasing. 


Through our discussions with debt counsellors, Capitec clients average ~2-3 loans from Capitec not including the 


multi-loan / credit facility. If we do include the multi-loan facility, consumers in debt counselling have on average 


7-15 credit agreements across debt counselling firms in their debt catalogue. 


Data sets also show that on average, Capitec credit agreements entered into by these clients are typically 


entered into on the same day. Why issue 2-3 loans instead of one? Likely for the initiation fee which can be 


charged 2-3 times over. 


Capitec maximum customer loans policy 
Viceroy has similarly obtained a communication from Capitec Head Office to its branches, which details that 


after to our original report, Capitec has appears to have increased the maximum number of loans consumers 


are entitled to 5 – four term loans and one credit facility: 


 
Figure 14 Extract from Capitec branch communications 


While the direction of this limit is unclear from Figure 11, Capitec should disclose to its investors and borrowers 


why it has amended this policy while recently stating they have adequate risk policies in place. An amendment 


to the maximum number of loans issued, in either direction, will have a major impact on Capitec’s risk profile 


and should be disclosed to the market. 


If the maximum number of loans per customer has increased, we believe this will drastically increase the risk of 


Capitec’s loan book and corroborates our thesis that overindebted customers finance existing loans by taking 


out fresh loans.  


If the maximum number of loans per customer has decreased, this suggests Capitec are actively curbing the 


underlying risk of their underreprested delinquencies and corroborating our thesis that the loan book is 


unsustainable.
Viceroy Research Group 12 viceroyreseach.org 


Viceroy are of the opinion that it is the prudent responsibility of the SARB to investigate this activity. The last 


dot point on Figure 14 states: 


“System changes will be done in future to alert employees granting credit that the maximum number of 


term loans have been exceeded” 


This appears to imply Capitec had no such internal controls in the past to specifically enforce the maximum 


number of terms loans extended to clients. 


The Steinhoff connection 
Capitec made the following statement in response to Viceroy’s first report: 


 
Figure 15 Extract from Capitec response to Viceroy 


This appears to be a creative response, and not reflective of Capitec and Steinhoff’s previous bragging about the 


synergies afforded by Capitec to Steinhoff and its subsidiaries, and Mouton functions as a related party because 


they sat on each other’s boards:

Mouton also comments on his long personal relationship with Jooste: 





 
Figures 17 & 18 Extract from moneyweb.co.za article “The Method Behind Steinhoff’s PSG Madness” 


Capitec’s response to Viceroy 
Since the release of our report Capitec has issued two responses to reassure investors that all is well7,8. Viceroy 


intends to respond to these below. 


1. Allegation that Capitec fabricates new loans and collections, or refinances up to R3b in principal per 


year by issuing new loans to defaulting clients. 


“With reference to the reconciliation of the loan book, we can confirm that the estimate in the 


Viceroy report does not accurately calculate client repayments. They use a figure net of fees on loan 


accounts based on assumptions regarding the amortisation and capital repayment profile of the loan 


book. Their estimate of capital repayments of R16.7 billion underestimates actual loan receipts net of 


fees of R18.6 billion (receipts less fees) by approximately R1.9 billion. They also reduce write-offs by an 


estimate of the component of write-offs that originate from new sales in subsequent years. There is 


a logic flaw that loan sales should be reduced accordingly. Furthermore, the default rates that they 


calculate does not consider the fact that written off balances include fees and should be compared 


against the sum of actual receipts plus write-offs.” 


We don’t hide behind our use of estimates in calculation of sums we believe have been carried forward; write-


off allocation being one assumption we use. We do not believe there is a “logic flaw” in assuming a portion of 


loans issued within the year being written off, as Capitec balance at risk vintages suggest this does occur within 


the first 12 months:

Viceroy Research Group 14 viceroyreseach.org 


 
Figure 19 Extract from Capitec Annual Report 2017 


Other assumptions used include that loans are issued at a consistent value pace throughout the year:  in reality 


there is a seasonality element where a larger portion of loans are issued towards the back end of the financial 


year. This consideration would have overcomplicated our analysis but increased our inconsistency, such is our 


claim that our estimates are conservative. 


Fees are a revenue item, not a balance sheet item. Viceroy questions whether the nature of Capitec’s loan fees 


can be included in write-offs under IFRS standards. The implication of including fees in write-offs is an inflation 


of revenue which must be recorded in order to offset this fee write-off that would otherwise not exist. Write-


offs should only be applicable to balance sheet items. 


Capitec claim we under-represent our repayments estimate. This could be possible, but through back-testing 


and evidence obtained we believe it is highly likely that this is due to early repayment of mostly short-term loans 


through re-financing.  


Capitec have avoided response to our claim that in order to make early repayments, 


Capitec issue new loans to existing clients in order for them to repay existing loans.

2. Allegation of loans granted to delinquent customers to repay existing loans.  


“What the Viceroy report is referring to is the court cases of 3 particular clients. They make no 


mention of Capitec's comprehensive responses in each of these cases which addresses each of the 


allegations contained in Viceroy's report. Our comprehensive responses are public documents and are 


available at court or from our legal department. Whenever we grant a loan, we do a comprehensive 


credit assessment based on the BAS principles (behavior, affordability and source).” 


We indeed refer to the cases of 3 particular clients and note that legal experts in South Africa believe these cases 


are representative of Capitec’s actions as a whole. Accordingly, we believe the case scheduled for March 2018 


is a test case that will set precedent for a class refund of reckless lending.  


We believe this is particularly true across Capitec’s multi-loan facility, (which is prohibited and was discontinued 


by Capitec) and credit facility, latter of which we believe has like-for-like predatory characteristics to the multi-


loan facility. 


3. Allegation of over-statement of Capitec's loan book.  


“Our impairment on loans are based on the probability of default. Loans are written off at the 


earliest of when they are in arrears for 90 days or more, or legal hand-over occurs. As at 31 August 2017, 


our doubtful debt provision covers loan balances in arrears by 237% and 152% when including arrears 


loan balances rescheduled within the last 6 months. Any competitor analyses requires a further 


breakdown of their loan granting, pricing, write-off and provisioning policies to compare our approach 


and position on a like for like basis.” 


This statement is illogical. Capitec appear to claim they have a more conservative approach to impairments than 


competitors through increased write-offs, and essentially notes that a like-for-like analysis must consider that 


competitors require further write offs to be equally comparable. We believe the sum of Capitec’s reported 


impairments and write-offs, regardless of its claim of a more conservative approach, is still far below its 


competitors.  


Capitec has pointed out that default rates as a percentage of principal advanced is roughly 100% greater than 


their balance at risk vintage9.

This suggests a delinquency rate of ~ 3% per year, far below the average of Capitec’s target low-income 


demographic and still well below US unsecured credit card delinquencies.

4. Assumption that court cases may result in a class action.  


“The proposition of a class action is speculation of the highest nature and premature. The 


matter must still be heard and Capitec believes it has solid defences to the allegations. 


Capitec's explanations in its answering papers in the court cases are not taken into account. The monthly 


loans were granted under an over-arching multi-loan agreement, concluded at the outset. 


Before concluding this agreement, Capitec concluded its standard comprehensive credit assessment. 


This consisted of documentary and other information provided by the customer (including bank 


statements, payslips and answers to questions posed by Capitec), as well as information sourced 


externally from credit bureaux. 


Before each withdrawal under the over-arching multi-loan agreement, Capitec performed 


supplementary credit assessments. Capitec supplemented and updated the results of the underlying 


initial assessments, and its purpose was to check whether the customer still qualified for the proposed 


credit. 


The process consisted of the following: 


▪ Customers asked to confirm that, ˜since you signed your last multi-loan agreement, your income is 


the same or more' and ˜since you signed your last multi-loan agreement, your expenses are the 


same or less.' 


▪ Capitec making a credit bureau enquiry to enquire whether the customer had any disqualifying legal 


statutes (insolvency, administration, etc) 


▪ Capitec making a credit bureau enquiry to determine the sum total of the customer's current 


external obligations, i.e. whether in the period since the conclusion of the over-arching multi-loan 


agreement, he has taken up fresh debt from entities other than Capitec or settled existing debts 


with such entities (as far as credit from Capitec itself was concerned, this was checked and taken 


into account directly)” 


Our understanding of the cases is that the above measures were insufficient. Viceroy believes that a class action, 


on the contrary to being highly speculative, would be a clear end result of these cases. In the cases we 


referenced: 


1. Customers were issued new Capitec loans which were used to repay delinquent Capitec loans; in 


the process the customer was issued a multi-loan facility.  


2. This process did not benefit the customer who was now unable to meet their monthly payments, 


supported by numerous exhibits which show Capitec’s affordability assessment was wholly 


unsubstantial. 


3. The only winner in this situation was Capitec who were able to claim full repayment of the existing 


loan and sale of a new loan and multi-loan facility. 


We do not believe we could simplify this further for Capitec.
Viceroy Research Group 18 viceroyreseach.org 


5.  Incorrect correlation between our credit facility and discontinued multi-loan facility 


“The credit facility operates the same way as a credit card except that the Capitec credit facility 


terminates after 9 months. If the client applies for a new Capitec credit facility we do a new 


comprehensive credit assessment to see if the client qualifies for a new Capitec credit facility. 


The initiation fee is only triggered once the client uses the facility up to a maximum fee agreed with 


the client, that is within the NCA. 


Monthly fee - this fee is raised as allowed in the applicable regulations of the NCA. There is a 


difference between availability and use of the facility and interest is charged as contracted with the 


client and the full amount used, including interest and fees, is repayable on a monthly basis.” 


 
Figure 24 Extract from Capitec “Rates and Fees” webpage10 


“use of the facility and interest is charged as contracted with the client and the full amount used, 


including interest and fees, is repayable on a monthly basis.” 


Viceroy fails to understand how the Credit Facility and Credit Card products offered are remotely similar, most 


notably due to the Credit Facility’s full monthly repayment. Further, the credit facility charges of at least 17.1% 


for the minimum ZAR 1,000 transfer, and increased monthly fee with balance owing clearly indicate an 


expectation of monthly repayments of the balance owed in full.  


Despite Capitec’s assertions, the credit facility bears most resemblance to the now-defunct multi-loan product. 


The resemblance is more than skin deep:

facility. Capitec’s assertion that a 3-month difference in the term of these products is a major difference is purely 


semantics. 


Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie made a claim on an analyst call held in response to the release of Viceroy’s research 


claiming that the NCR was happy with its use of the multi-loan product: 





 
Figures 27 & 28 Extracts from Capitec analyst call transcript dated January 30, 2018 


We struggle to reconcile Fourie’s claim that the NCR was happy with the multi-loan product given the NCR 


directed a third party to investigate Capitec and referred them to the South African consumer Tribunal for 


breaches of the National Credit Act. We believe this to be an attempt to reassure the market based on what we 


believe are misleading statements.

Figure 29 Extract from National Credit Regulator v Capitec Case number: NCT/9152/2013/140(1)13 


The case against Capitec was dismissed because the NCR did not properly initiate an investigation, failing to act 


on an existing complaint. However, the existence, findings, and pursuit of these issues by the NCR do not indicate 


the NCR is “quite happy” with Capitec’s multi-loan products. 


6. There is a correlation between African Bank and Capitec Bank 


“Capitec Bank's operations are significantly different to that of African Bank Capitec Bank is 


fully fledged retail bank and has different sources of income, not only credit. It's transactional 


business continues to contribute materially to its earnings as reported in our 1H 2018 results. 


Capitec Bank has a significant retail deposit book, unlike African Bank. The result of this is that 


Capitec has a low reliance on wholesale funding. 


Capitec Bank has a far more conservative approach to providing credit than African Bank. The 


provisioning of Capitec Bank is market-leading and significantly more conservative to that 


specifically of African Bank, as well as other unsecured loan books.” 


Viceroy has not brought into question Capitec’s transactional business. We have compared Capitec’s unsecured, 


largely low-income demographic retail loan book to African Bank’s unsecured, largely low-income demographic 


retail loan book.  


7. Opinions of former employees 


“Employees who are no longer employed by an organisation can make claims that are false. It 


is patently untrue that Capitec has fired any employees â€˜for not deceiving borrowers'. Amongst 


the many inaccuracies in the report another exists where it is claimed that our branch managers 


earn an average of R13 219 where the actual average is R22 000 per month. We are proud of the 


journey that we have placed our employees on with the result that many employees are promoted 


within the organisation.” 


While we accept that former employees can make false statements, so can current employees, such as those 


responsible for the drafting of response documents and company press releases. Since the release of our report, 


consumers and employees have reached out to Viceroy en masse to corroborate our research and provide

This is also the first time since 2015 that Fourie has purchased Capitec shares on the open market.  


Sell side analysis 
JP Morgan have released an investment note with an overweight recommendation which appears to be content 


that Capitec’s metrics have no resemblance on any other bank globally, including having the 2nd highest ROE and 


a price-to-book multiple so insane that exceeds their closest “competitor” by over 57%. Morgan Stanley 


maintained equal weight recommendation despite Capitec’s price-book multiple and RoE being so high that it 


exceeds both axes of their global top bank comparisons graph: 





Deutsche Bank reiterated its sell position on the Company, and states that “an independent investigation is the 


best manner to deal with the issues raised and to address any concerns”. We agree especially in light of 


Capitec having only one auditor in an environment where the status quo for deposit-taking institutions is to 


have two. 


SARB tweet 
Viceroy is also astounded by the announcement by the South African Reserve Bank in support of Capitec on 


twitter just over 3 hours after the release of our report.

Figure 32 SA Reserve Bank tweet dated 3:00AM January 30, 2018 


We fail to see how SARB could have investigated and dismissed the claims of our 33-page report in little over 3 


hours.  


We believe this is a knee-jerk response designed to calm the markets. African Bank dug itself into a precarious 


position regarding its loan book which culminated in a bailout financed by South African taxpayers. Given the 


extensive evidence we have compiled which we believe make Capitec’s financial data unreliable. An 


investigation, at minimum, is required by the South African Reserve Bank. We have addressed the South African 


Reserve Bank’s response separately. 


Conclusion 
Management’s response appears to actively avoid any actually denial of under-the-table refinancing as detailed 


in our report.  


Capitec in their response have: 


1. Failed to deny the practice of issuing delinquent customers new loans to repay old loans, 


2. Failed to explain their suspiciously low impairments rate, 


3. Attempted to distance its current credit facility product from its multi-loan product despite glaring 


similarities between the two. 


In conclusion Viceroy reiterates its opinion that Capitec is uninvestable. Much of the media coverage and 


discussion about our report is focused on the safety of the retail deposits at Capitec bank. We believe Capitec 


should be placed under curatorship is in order to protect its borrowers, who are comprised of the most 


financially at-risk demographic in South Africa.
