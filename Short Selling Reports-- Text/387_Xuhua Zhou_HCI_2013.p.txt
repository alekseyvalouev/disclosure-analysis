HCI Group: Inadequate Reinsurance Coverage Poses Potentially
Catastrophic Risks To Shareholders, Policyholders And Taxpayers

HCI Group (NYSE:HCI), formerly known as Homeowners Choice, Inc., is a holding
company with subsidiaries engaged in property and casualty insurance business in the
state of Florida. The Company derives substantially all of its revenue and profits from its
regulated insurance entity, Homeowners Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Company.
The Company faces significant risks unappreciated by investors and policyholders.


1. HCI's superior profitability and ROE result from cutting corners on reinsurance
coverage rather than sound underwriting


2. HCI lacks proper second event reinsurance coverage and may face regulatory action
in the case of a significant hurricane event in Florida


3. Questionable insider dealings raise corporate governance concerns
4. Insiders have been consistently selling stock
5. HCI trades at almost 3 times its book value; far more expensive than insurers


operating in the same market such as United Insurance Holdings Corp
(NASDAQ:UIHC).


Background


HCI was incorporated in 2006 following waves of devastating hurricanes that led to mass
exodus of insurance companies providing homeowners insurance in the state. The most
notable exit was made by State Farm in 2009. Florida's homeowners became increasingly
reliant on the state owned Citizens Properties Insurance to provide homeowners
insurance and the state insurance regulator has approved numerous new private market
entrants in an attempt to involve private sector companies to provide homeowners
insurance to Florida residents. Since incorporation, Homeowners Choice has managed to
grow rapidly by taking advantage of the take-out program offered by the state owned
Citizens; it currently owns roughly 15,000 policies following the acquisition of HomeWise.
As of December 31st, 2012, Homeowners Choice has 10.9 million shares outstanding and
a book value of $121 million. The company trades at almost 3 times book value, largely
because of its ability to rapidly grow its gross premium by acquiring policies from Citizens
as well as other Florida home insurers. United Insurance Holdings Corp (UIHC), in
comparison, trades at a far more modest 1.1x book. Homeowners Choice has managed to
generate substantial return on equity since its incorporation. But if Homeowners Choice is

able to be so profitable writing homeowners insurance, why would bigger insurance
companies ever exit this market? Is State Farm acting dumb or are there unobserved
caveats in Homeowners Choice's business model?


In a press release dated January 27th, 2009, State Farm announced it is exiting the
property insurance market in Florida citing its inability to raise premiums to cover future
catastrophe risks. The Company voluntarily gave up over 700,000 policies as a result of
its exit. In the same year, Homeowners Choice almost doubled its gross premium to $110
million. It begs curiosity as to how a 3-year old property insurance company sees profits in
a sector while one of the world's best and largest insurance companies is running for the
door. Is Homeowners Choice making money because of smart underwriting and hedging
of catastrophe risks or is the Company simply rolling the dice and has been getting lucky?
Filings with Florida Office of Insurance Regulation provide insightful answers to the
puzzle.


Homeowners Choice has been underpreparing for major CAT risks when benchmarked
against similar property insurers in the state of Florida. Further, related party dealings
involving the CEO, insiders and the CEO's family members raise serious questions about
the integrity of certain reinsurance contracts entered into between the regulated insurance
entity and the Company's Bermuda-based captive reinsurer. Moreover, the potential future
reform of Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund will likely add additional uncertainties to
Homeowners' business model.


Do Homeowners Choice's Reinsurance Contracts Adequately Shield the Company
from Catastrophe Risks?


Homeowners Choice has significant coastal exposures which obviously renders itself to
significant hurricane risks. With the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season officially starting 2013,
scientists are predicting it to be the busiest hurricane season since 2005. Models predict
greater than 60% chance of a major hurricane hitting the state of Florida.

The management of Homeowners Choice certainly would like the investors to believe that
the Company has completely transferred all CAT risks to reinsurers and thus, profits the
Company has made in the past came from excellent underwriting rather than taking on
undue risks. In a recent investor presentation at Roth, CEO Paresh Patel stated the
following:


"People always seem to think we made money because the wind didn't blow or there
wasn't a hurricane last year. That isn't how insurance in our business model works.
The people who make money when there isn't a hurricane are the reinsurers
because what we do is we transfer the hurricane risks to third party reinsurers"


Mr. Patel is certainly right about one thing, an insurer like Homeowners Choice should
adequately transfer all hurricane risks to reinsurers given its lack of reserves. Yet
comparison of regulatory filings between Homeowners and its competitors show
significant differences when it comes to preparing for catastrophe risks. Two of
Homeowners Choice's competitors in the Florida market are Tower Hill Insurance and ASI
Assurance. A comparison between reinsurance structures of Tower Hill, ASI and
Homeowners Choice should raise alarm for investors of Homeowners Choice. Both Tower
Hill and ASI's reinsurance contracts provide significant capacity for second event and
even third event while Homeowners Choice's reinsurance program provides virtually non-
existent capacity in case of a second event. The latest available filing for the 2011-2012
period shows only Layer 2 was available for reinstatement at 100% of premium while all
other layers have no reinstatement options. (All documents presented below are
regulatory documents filed with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation)

Furthermore, another publicly listed comparable property insurer, United Insurance
Holdings Corp. also has substantial second event coverage. For fiscal year 2012, HCI
collected a total gross premium of 233 million and ceded 76 million for reinsurance,
roughly 32% of the total premium it collected. By comparison, in 2012, UIHC collected a
total of 226 million in gross premium and ceded 104 million for reinsurance, or 46%. Such
practices may result in short-term profitability of the Company but they should be
especially alarming for the state insurance regulator and HCI's policyholders.


Before delving in further to explain the reinstatement clause in a reinsurance contract, it is
my view that Homeowners Choice simply is not a suitable investment for investors without
such level of understanding.

The reinstatement clause in reinsurance contracts affords insurers to reinstate the
contracts after one occurrence. Without proper reinstatement coverage, Homeowners
Choice will become uncovered by reinsurance should a significant hurricane hits early in
the season. Further, a significant amount of reinsurance coverage for Homeowners came
from FHCF (Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund) which currently lacks the ability to
reinstate after a loss. Therefore, while Homeowners Choice on the surface appears to be
well covered by reinsurance insuring the Company against 1 in 100-year hurricane, it in
fact faces risks that are unobserved by many equity market participants. Further, it is
especially troubling from an insurance regulator's perspective that Homeowners Choice is
underpaying for reinsurance contracts, which lack reinstatement coverage while affording
an over 3% dividend for the Company's shareholders.


Homeowners Choice is no stranger to media coverage. As recently as February this year,
ABC Action News had an investigative report discussing concerns some industry
observers share about the Company. Weiss Ratings gave the insurance unit a "D" and its
analyst thinks the insurer has significant weakness and could negatively impact
policyholders. Weiss views Homeowners Choice among the weakest of the so-called take-
out insurers that have been encouraged to remove policies from Citizens' portfolio. Garvin
Magor, the senior analyst at Weiss opined "Seven years on, they are still not, in our
opinion, able to deal with a severe catastrophe." I certainly share the opinion of Mr. Magor
on the company. Additional troubling points were raised in the report. The Company spent
$13.7 million to buy two marinas and adjacent property in Pinella County, which is
vulnerable to storms. So the very assets the Company has to insure against storms are
vulnerable to storms? Hopefully HCI is not acting as the insurer on those investment
properties but I suspect they are.


In addition to lacking reinstatement options on its reinsurance contracts, Homeowners
Choice is certainly not practicing the extreme caution some of its peers are doing when it
comes to the potential shortfall of FHCF. The ability of FHCF to handle a major
catastrophe has been the subject of significant media attention recently. Many industry
experts, including the Executive Director of FHCF have been calling for immediate reform
of FHCF because there's real danger of FHCF not being able to cover all of its liabilities. A
bill was most recently introduced into the House Insurance and Banking subcommittee
sponsored by state representative Bill Hager. In the staff analysis of the bill, it was noted
that some insurers were in fact purchasing private reinsurance duplicating FHCF coverage
to insure against any short falls in the fund. This introduces an additional layer of risk
ignorance on the side of Homeowners' management and certainly shows an element of
lack of best practices when it comes to properly protecting itself against relevant risks.

Homeowners Choice currently has an "A" rating from ratings agency Demotech, but
Demotech simply is not the gold standard when it comes to insurance rating. In fact, it has
faced accusations of being inflated. One Florida takeout insurer, Magnolia Insurance, was
carrying an "A" rating from Demotech shortly before it was ordered into receivership in
2010. The prime rating agency is A.M. Best and Homeowners Choice is not rated by it. By
comparison, Tower Hill was downgraded by A.M. Best in 2009 for large part because A.M.
Best is very skeptical of FHCF's ability to fund claims.


The state of Florida has not dealt with a major hurricane for the past seven years and
many companies operating the takeout model have managed to take on significant
number of policies while claiming it had transferred all the risks to the reinsurers. The
underlying reality appears to be very different. In my opinion, Homeowners Choice
certainly has not transferred all catastrophe risks to the reinsurers as claimed by the CEO
and a potential catastrophe will likely wreak havoc on both shareholders and
policyholders.


Problematic Insiders Dealings


In addition to the property and casualty insurance business, Homeowners Choice also has
a Bermuda-based captive reinsurer called Claddaugh Casualty Insurance Company. The
Company uses the reinsurer unit to reinsure 100% of sub-LAC layer as well as a portion of
other tranches. For the year 2011/2012, Company's filing per figure 5 shows it used
Claddaugh to reinsure $5.8 million at a ROL (rate on line) of 85%. In other words, the
regulated insurance entity paid Claddaugh $4.93 million dollar to insure against a potential
hurricane incident and should the event occur, the maximum liability for Claddaugh is $5.8
million. The money never left the Company because Claddaugh is a subsidiary of HCI. In
addition to the sub-LAC layer, Claddaugh is also involved in two additional tranches - 5%
of Agg tranche and 13.5% of Layer 1. The total risks Claddaugh insured is approximately
$12 million but the two additional layers are at much lower ROL and the likelihoods of
those payouts are correspondingly much lower. The 85% ROL on the sub-LAC layer
appears to be extremely high but given it was essentially moving money from one pocket
to another pocket, as long as the Florida insurance regulator approves the transaction,
shareholders of Homeowners Choice should have no complaints. The situation becomes
somewhat different this year. Disclosed in the 10-K filed with the SEC, an unrelated entity
Moksha Re started getting involved in retrocession contracts with the Company's
Bermuda-based reinsurer.

"On June 1, 2012, Claddaugh Casualty Insurance Company, Ltd. ("Claddaugh"), the
Company's Bermuda-based captive reinsurer, entered into a reinsurance treaty with
Moksha Re SPC Ltd. and multiple capital partners ("Moksha") whereby a portion of
the business assumed from the Company's insurance subsidiary, Homeowners
Choice Property & Casualty Insurance Company, Inc. ("HCPCI"), is ceded by
Claddaugh to Moksha. With respect to the 2012-2013 treaty year, which covers the
period from June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013, Moksha assumed $13.8 million of
the total covered exposure for approximately $4.0 million in premiums, a rate which
management believes to be competitive with market rates available to Claddaugh.
The $4.0 million premium was fully paid by Claddaugh in June 2012. Moksha capital
partners deposited an aggregate of $9.8 million into a trust account along with the
$4.0 million premium paid by Claddaugh to fully collateralize Moksha's exposure.
Trust assets may be withdrawn by HCPCI, the trust beneficiary, in the event
amounts are due under the 2012-2013 Moksha reinsurance agreement. Among the
Moksha capital partner participants, the Company's chief executive officer and the
Company's vice president of investor relations contributed $700,000 and $200,000,
respectively. In addition, members of the chief executive officer's immediate family
contributed $942,500. The remaining capital partner participants, who are multiple
parties unrelated to the Company, contributed the balance of $7,960,000."


This time around, Company insiders, their family members and other "unrelated" capital
providers started entering into the lucrative reinsurance business at Claddaugh. While it
appears Moksha capital partners assumed a total of $13.8 million in exposure in exchange
for roughly $4 million, the layer of exposure assumed by such entity is completely unclear
and undisclosed. If Moksha capital partners assumed similar reinsurance agreement as
the one between Claddaugh and Homeowners Choice, the related parties may not be
acting in the best interest of the shareholders. The disclosure certainly lacks transparency
and calls into question management's credibility. Why does the Company need outsiders
to assume the $13.8 million in risks when it spent $13.7 million on waterfront properties?
Finally, the recent change of auditor may serve as an additional red flag for investors.


Additionally, insider action in the open market is worrisome as well. Director Martin Traber
has been consistently selling shares since November 2012.The management including
the CEO does not appear to have significant stake in the Company either. The recent
reported holdings of the CEO came from a share grant as part of his compensation
package.

Comments (34)


A discussion involving the FHCF is beyond the scope of this article, but the current bill in
the Florida House of Representatives certainly bears significance for companies such as
Homeowners Choice, which requires state reinsurance to stay in business. The current bill
proposes a reduction of the mandatory coverage from $17 billion to $14 billion in the next
three years. The bill would also reduce the Cat Fund's offer of coverage to insurers from a
maximum of 90 percent this year to 75 percent in 2016. Significantly, the bill also
contemplates increasing the industry's co-pay from its current level of 10 percent to 25
percent over the same time period. Given the state of Florida's role in the property
reinsurance market, such reduction in government subsidized programs will undoubtedly
raise the costs of reinsurance for home insurers like Homeowners Choice.


Conclusion


In summary, Homeowners Choice is a timely short with one of the busiest hurricane
season in full swing given its inadequate reinsurance coverage. The insider dealings raise
further corporate governance issues and the long-term profitability prospects are not only
impacted by potential regulatory actions involving its inadequate reinsurance but also by
the impending downsizing of the FHCF that could drive up costs of its reinsurance
programs.

Great Article. While doing a little investigation on my own I found troubling happenings from listening to the most
recent conference call!


They mentioned they were very interested in more acquisitions. The comment seemed like they were high on power.


Mentioned that the "policy acquisition cost" is likely to increase.


Very unclear about any questions in regards to Reinsurance contracts.


Along with your article I would be hard pressed to buy this company and am leaning towards shorting it. It has all the
signs of problems down the road. A hurricane comes and boom! They are done.

Great article. I live in Tampa so that is very helpful info. Insider dealings + acquisition binge definitely tells me to stay
away. Looks like a pretty tame hurricane season on the horizon though. Massive daily rainstorms have lowered Gulf
waters quite a bit. Lower temperatures will make hurricanes less prone to gathering strength when entering the Gulf.
That could change with late summer temps though. Regardless, I will look for other investment ideas. Thank you.

HCI has been a great investment and growth going forward will likely come from acquisitions of new lines of
businesses (which increase revenue and loss diversification) and potential to cross-sell. It will be likely slower growth
going forward.


Another firm which (belatedly) looks like it is following in HCI's footsteps is UVE. Let's see.

One storm in Florida will easily wipe out an insurer the size of HCI. This is not a long term investment where you buy
and go to sleep. Make sure you keep your eye on the weather channel during hurricane season.

I think what we need is a storm to weed out investors such as yourself to prove once and for all that the
reinsurance available is adequate and sufficient to cover losses.

lol Well said, pacha. Though I think you were a little loose with that term "investors."

Great article.  
Look into Oxbridge Re which is going public very soon.  
Madhu is the CEO, Pattel is the largest shareholder. Oxbridge's only contracts are HCI and Caddaugh.  
Started paying dividends of .12 cents per share recently.

The whole scheme looks to me like a giant scheme - they reinsure HCI and Claddaugh via Oxbridge which
was recently started by former executive of HCI Madhu, and whose non-executive Chairman of the Board

AND the largest shareholder is HCI's CEO Patel. BTW, Patel's brother (or brother in law), a Maryland
radiologist, is the director (what skills does he bring to the table? seriously.... ). OXBR's only reinsurance
contracts are Claddaugh and HCI. I guess Patel figured why wasting money by giving them away to
reinsurance companies if they (Patel and friends) can collect them themselves via shady (?) schemes. I am
thinking the very first silly catastrophe and the whole thing goes belly up - first OXBR followed by Claddaugh
and HCI.....

It's not shady. It's BETTER than other reinsurers as HCI requires OxBR / Moksha to put up 100% of the cash
as collateral. Reinsurers on the other hand have a limited amount of capital to allocate to losses from their
total assets.

who do you refer to when you say "other reinsurers" ? 
thanks

What's better than a cash collateral? Any reinsurer will provide reinsurance on their credit standing (checked by rating
agencies and the like). As long as 2 contracts are the same the best collateral is cash.
