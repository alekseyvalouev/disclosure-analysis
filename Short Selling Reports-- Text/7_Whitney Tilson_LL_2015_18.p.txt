Thoughts On The Unexpected Resignation Of Lumber Liquidators'
CEO
May 21, 2015 12:46 PM ET184 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


I was shocked by this announcement because it undermines all of the company’s
denials.


It is powerful evidence that what I’ve been saying all along is true: Lumber
Liquidators has been knowingly poisoning its customers with toxic, formaldehyde-
drenched laminate flooring and, in general, is a notorious bad actor.


It likely means that Lumber Liquidators is under immense pressure from regulators,
who will, I expect, take decisive action to rein in and punish this rogue company.


If Lumber Liquidators wants to start behaving like an honest and reputable company,
it needs to take a number of steps.


I’m not adding to my short position at this price, but I'm very comfortable keeping it
as my largest short.


The announcement this morning that Robert Lynch is resigning as Lumber Liquidators'
(NYSE:LL) President, CEO and board member was not only a surprise to the company,
but to me as well. In fact, in light of the company's circle-the-wagons, deny-and-attack
approach since the 60 Minutes story aired on March 1st, I'm shocked by this
announcement because it undermines all of the company's denials since the 60 Minutes
story aired.


If Lumber Liquidators was a good company with no formaldehyde problem - or was the
innocent victim of nefarious Chinese suppliers - Lynch never would have resigned.


The fact that he did - and did so "unexpectedly" - is powerful evidence that the three main
things I've been saying all along are undoubtedly true:


1) Lumber Liquidators, until only two weeks ago when it finally suspended sales of its
Chinese-made laminate flooring, was for years selling American families hundreds of
millions of square feet of this product, which contained high levels of formaldehyde, a
dangerous chemical and known carcinogen, and thus endangered the health and safety of
its customers, especially children.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3203026-thoughts-on-the-unexpected-resignation-of-lumber-liquidators-ceo 2/58


2) Lumber Liquidators' senior executives knowingly did this in order to save ~10% on
sourcing costs. Why would they do something so immoral and potentially destructive? The
oldest reason in the universe: greed. Laminate is one of the company's most profitable
product lines and non-CARB-compliant laminate is ~10% cheaper, so the company saved
a lot of money on sourcing costs (not a few pennies, as founder, Chairman and new CEO
Tom Sullivan claims), which I think was a major contributor to a quick doubling of margins,
which in turn helped send the stock price up eight times from $15 to $119 in less than two
years. Sullivan and Lynch recognized a golden opportunity when they saw it, dumping $37
million worth of stock at prices more than triple today's level in early- to mid- 2013; and


3) Lumber Liquidators is a notorious bad actor: cutting corners at every opportunity, selling
very low-quality products, treating customers, vendors, installers and employees badly,
and, most damningly, not being serious about compliance.


(A pdf of the 16 articles I've written on Lumber Liquidators since the 60 Minutes story aired
- with a table of contents - is posted here.)


Other Implications


There are a number of other possible implications of Lynch's sudden departure:


1) It likely means that Lumber Liquidators is under immense pressure from regulators,
who will, I expect, take decisive action to rein in and punish this rogue company.


2) I think Lumber Liquidators' board members are finally waking up to what really
happened, are rightly panicked about the implications, both for the company and their own
personal liability, and are seizing control of the situation. Thus, Lynch was likely under
immense pressure from the board, saw the writing on the wall, and decided to jump before
being pushed. As I wrote in my article two weeks ago, The Market Is Misunderstanding
Lumber Liquidators' Announcement, in response to the company's decision to halt sales of
its Chinese-made laminate: "One source tells me that the decision to halt sales was made
by the board, over management's objections, which, if true, means that perhaps they kept
the board in the dark about their nefarious actions."


3) Reflective of the change in who's running the show is the company's new "Commitment
to Quality & Safety" web page, replacing the one it posted shortly after the 60 Minutes
story aired.


The old one made the laughable claim that "all of our products are 100% safe," had videos
featuring both Sullivan and Ray Cotton, Lumber Liquidators' Senior Vice President, Chief
Compliance and Sustainability Officer, impressive-looking charts that purported to show

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3203026-thoughts-on-the-unexpected-resignation-of-lumber-liquidators-ceo 3/58


that its laminate had safe levels of formaldehyde (which I rebutted in this article), and laid
the blame for its problems at the feet of short sellers like me:


These attacks are driven by a small group of short-selling investors who are working
together for the sole purpose of making money by lowering our stock price. They are
using any means to try and scare our customers with inaccurate allegations. Their
motives and methods are wrong and we will fight these false attacks on all fronts.


The new web site makes no claim that Lumber Liquidators' laminate is safe or compliant,
has a slick, new, feel-good video with no company employees in it, and doesn't mention
short sellers. Instead, it has pretty pictures and this generic, carefully-crafted statement
that says nothing (with a cute new logo):


Our Commitment to Quality & Safety


Offering value means more than saving our customers money, that's why Lumber
Liquidators is committed to providing high quality, durable, safe products.


For more than 20 years, Lumber Liquidators has delivered on that promise by
making beautiful, high quality hardwood flooring affordable for everyone.


Your life is lived on our floors, and we take that to heart. We go the extra mile for
your safety and satisfaction. That's why we use quality and compliance processes
designed to ensure we meet applicable regulations and our stringent quality
standards.


4) I doubt that Lumber Liquidators was ever a corporate exemplar, but I'm not sure that it
was always a notorious bad actor. I've heard from numerous people that when Lynch
became CEO at the beginning of 2012, the company's sourcing and compliance
procedures as well as how it treated vendors and installers got much worse - all part of an
effort to increase margins, profitability and, of course, the stock price in the short term,
long-term consequences be damned. If Lynch was, in fact, a major source of the rot in the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3203026-thoughts-on-the-unexpected-resignation-of-lumber-liquidators-ceo 4/58


company, then his departure is good news for Lumber Liquidators and everyone who
interacts with it, most importantly customers. If the few remaining bulls on this stock are
looking for a silver lining to today's news, this is it.


Next Steps


Since the 60 Minutes story aired, Lumber Liquidators has consistently done the wrong
thing at every turn. If it wants to break this dismal streak and start behaving like an honest
and reputable company, it needs to take a number of steps:


1) Offer a full refund to any customers who want to return Chinese-made laminate that's
already been delivered but not yet been installed.


2) Cease the bogus formaldehyde testing program that it's currently offering customers
(see my article, Lumber Liquidators' Offer to Do Indoor Air Quality Testing Appears to Be a
Sham), and instead offer to send a trained specialist with sophisticated equipment to do a
proper test.


3) Rather than waiting for inbound calls and complaints, Lumber Liquidators should send a
letter to every customer who has purchased its Chinese-made laminate flooring in the
past, say, five years, informing them that the product may be emitting dangerous levels of
formaldehyde and offering a proper test.


4) For any customers with a reading above 0.016 parts per million (16 ppb), the standard
set by both FEMA and NIOSH (I'm being generous - 7 ppb is the limit set by the California
Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment; for more on this, see my article, More
On Lumber Liquidators And Formaldehyde), offer to pay all costs for them, if they wish, to
temporarily move out of their home until the flooring can be removed and replaced with
safe flooring, at Lumber Liquidators' cost (even if the customer chooses carpeting or wood
flooring bought from another company). Also, for these customers, offer to pay all medical
bills for anyone in the home suffering symptoms consistent with formaldehyde exposure;
and


5) Fire Ray Cotton, who, as I showed in this article, is not a serious person and, not
surprisingly, has failed miserably in his job as head of compliance at Lumber Liquidators.


Conclusion


As I disclosed in previous articles (here and here), I've added to my Lumber Liquidators
short position twice since the 60 Minutes story aired because further evidence emerged
that my short thesis was correct, the company continued to pursue a reckless and truly

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3203026-thoughts-on-the-unexpected-resignation-of-lumber-liquidators-ceo 5/58


insane deny-and-attack strategy, and the stock remained significantly overvalued.


Today, the story is now more mixed. While I'm even more certain that my investment
thesis is correct, the company has finally done what it should have done long ago:
suspended sales of its Chinese-made laminate and engineered the departure of Rob
Lynch. And, of course, the stock is much lower, hitting a 3+ year low this morning.


Thus, I'm not inclined to add to my short position at this price, especially since, even after
today's decline, it's still my largest at ~3%.


But I'm not inclined to cover and take some profits either, for two reasons:


1) I see nothing but bad news emerging for the company over the short-, intermediate-
and long-term horizons. In particular, I think regulators (most likely the California Air
Resources Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission) will announce that their
tests of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate are consistent with the test results
commissioned by 60 Minutes, myself and others; that, consequently, they will take strong
action against the company (perhaps requiring some of the steps that I outline above);
and that the legal liabilities will be enormous, especially once hard evidence emerges that
the company was knowingly poisoning its own customers; and


2) I still think the stock is significantly overvalued. In my article on April 3rd, Comments on
Lumber Liquidators' First Quarter Business Update (when the stock was above $33), I
wrote:


If we take the midpoint of the historical operating margin, 7%, and assume $1 billion in
sales, that means Lumber Liquidators would have $70 million of operating income.
Applying a 39% tax rate and dividing by 27.2 million shares results in earnings per share
(EPS) of $1.57 - which is almost exactly current consensus analysts' estimates for 2015 of
$1.60.


The difference between us, however, is that I think $1.57 is normalized earnings power in
a best-case scenario, excluding many costs that I believe are likely to be substantial and
long-lasting, whereas analysts think 2015 will be an unusual trough year and that the
company's EPS will soar 41% to $2.26 in 2016. I would bet my last dollar that Lumber
Liquidators doesn't earn $2.26 in 2016.


Rather, I think it would be extremely generous and optimistic to estimate that the
company's earnings grow 10% in 2016, which would result in EPS of $1.76. If I'm right,
what multiple might the stock trade at? It could trade as low as 6x if regulators take strong
action and various lawsuits gain traction (which I think is highly likely), and as high as 15x

if not, which results in a stock price range of $10.56-$28.16. Either way, it's a substantial
discount to the current price of $33.20, which is why this remains my largest short
position.


Since then, analysts have been scrambling to lower their estimates, which now stand at
$0.46 for this year and $1.58 for next year. Thus, the stock, at $21.50 today, trades at
46.7x this year's estimates and 13.6x next year's estimates. These multiples are much too
high for a business of mediocre quality (at best) that is facing enormous uncertainty and
contingent liabilities that, in a worst-case scenario, could bankrupt it. Think about it: would
anyone care if Lumber Liquidators ceased to exist?


I highly doubt that Lumber Liquidators will earn $1.58 next year, but even if it did, I think a
10x multiple would be generous, so that translates into a stock price of $15.80 - 26%
below today's levels. Thus, while I'm not adding to my short position, I'm very comfortable
keeping it as my largest short.

thoughtful comments and questions so I invite my readers to communicate directly with
me via Seeking Alpha messaging. I will post my answers on the message board.

Don't some CEOs resign simply because they don't want their job to consist of fighting off lawsuits and dealing with
negative PR for years? I don't think that the only explanation is that he and LL are guilty. They may be - but they may
not be. 
If I was in his position, and could afford not to work or had another opportunity? 
Poof! I'd be gone.

Agreed. There could be many other reasons why the CEO resigned not related to wrongdoing at the
company. Once again, this author's narrow analysis and grandstanding is purely in the interest of talking his
position.


21 May 2015, 01:06 PM


bassmaster general
There are a number of reasons why a CEO would leave a company in LLs situation but a CEO in that
situation doesn't just walk away catching the board off guard. When that happens, there is ALWAYS
something bigger going on. The market is reacting correctly to this and Tilson's right in calling it out.

Agreed! Whenever I can, I always walk away from where I have just pooped. It just seems like the smart thing
to do.


Not only is there less risk of stepping in it, you don't have to smell it constantly. And, if you hang out near it,
who knows, someone might tackle you and rub your face in it.

User 6094391
Jackooo - Being the CEO of LL right now is not a plush job. Maybe he decided he just didn't want to fight the
fight. Also, maybe he came to the realization that he wasn't going to make "tons of money" because the
company is going to be deploying more cash to lawyers instead of executive salaries. Additionally, I know
someone who just found out that they have an inoperable brain tumor. Maybe that would be another reason
to leave a "plush job." Unexpected departures don't immediately imply guilt.


23 May 2015, 08:18 AM


bassmaster general
Mark, it's a difficult job right now but it is still a plush one. It's not like the board was going to cut his salary to 0
and take away his options. He was doing extremely well for himself.


As for other reasons - sure there could be some but health, family, and other reasons NEVER should catch a
board off guard. If they do, there's a fundamental lack of communication between the CEO and the board,
which is arguably as bad, if not worse than a company-wide cover up. There's a lot more going on here than
you want to admit and it all points to a very bad situation.


23 May 2015, 02:49 PM


User 6094391
Biobat, we have differing definitions of the word plush as it relates to this topic, so let's just leave it at that. No,
LL's board wasn't going to cut his salary to 0, but some people may think, "Why work for $300k a year when I
can find another job with less stress making $500K?" The answer seems logical to me. Health and family
should never catch a board off guard? If anything, those are two things that would catch a board off guard,
especially if you have a very private executive that won't share that type of information until they deem it is
necessary.


My original comment to Jackooo was in response to his one-sided thoughts that it would be impossible that
he was wrong. Hubris causes bad decisions.


There are great unknowns in this situation and as new information comes out, the odds of LL's survival
change. Right now, I am hedged because the recent information questions the ability of LL to be a going
concern. On the other side, if by chance LL comes out of this and goes on, I want to be there to take
advantage of the value going forward and the eventual short squeeze. Just imagine what LL's stock does if
the CPSC or CARB comes out with an announcement saying that they aren't seeking prosecution or fining
LL. I'm leaning one way with this stock, but I'm still taking a balanced approached. With LL, we are
approaching a binary event and I am set up to do ok in either situation.

bassmaster general
His compensation was pegged at $858K last year and he's made tens of millions in stock option sales. We'll
just agree to disagree on the status of this being a plush job then.


Board members don't exist in a vacuum. They are often friends and colleagues of the CEO. I stand by my
comment that a board being caught off guard by an embattled CEO resigning is a major red flag.


We'll have to wait to see how lawsuits play out (the SEC and DoJ are the ones to worry about) and how this
affects customers before knowing whether LL is a bargain or a value trap.

Tilson - Ah, now it's resignation based science!? LL UP 10% since the resignation fallout. A company can
have but one leader - and now LL has. Look for consistency in messaging going forward. And for the bears to
lead the way to a robust recovery as they cover their shorts.

Speaking of B of A. LL just got a $100,000,000 revolving line of credit from that institution - SECURED BY
INVENTORY!!!!! In other words the Bank just placed a Hundred million dollar bet on LL that their inventory
(that would be what you refer to as "formaldehyde drenched" flooring) is NOT a problem for the company.
Tilson - Guess you'll soon be a buyer of LL after all. Not that your $2 bet has any significance anyway.

It's actually up 5% not 10%. Either way, it's a dead cat bounce.

Looking at his holdings, he is an Ackman copycat (largest holdings are all PSH stocks -- HHC, PAH, APD)
with a few small (but very public) shorts. It might be easier to just invest in PSHZF and call it a day.

You can say that for other flooring companies as well, it's just that Lumber Liquidators have been put under
higher scrutiny.


New Carpeting, car interiors all contain levels of formaldehyde that would most likely fail 'CARB' emission
standards. Why isn't Tilson targetting these these areas? Why just Lumber Liquidators? I think the answer is
obvious.


Furthermore, formaldehyde is such a minor issue.. There are other more critical health issues in the American
industry.. Trans fat for example, should not be in our foods, yet FDA allows labeling of '0g' when there's
actually 0.5g which accumulates with multiple serving sizes..

"kill the company" and "No compassion" ?


Have you seen the issues why Whitney Tilson said this company was trouble?


If someone supposedly commits a crime, they shouldn't be stopped? How's a company different from a
person? Go sell cancerous products to people and see if God is going to forgive you.


Are we to forgive the company for the victims who had health related issues from LL products?


You clearly sinned by supporting a company that is selling products supposedly harming customers.


Honestly, I don't know if what will or should happen to LL in the end but I just think your comment is funny.

Yes, my first time life experience to create an account with regards to stock investment. I bought Apple and
LL. I read about LL scandal and wrote what I think. I do not have any negative feelings about putting short on
LL. I DO have negative feelings about the people who have accused LL extremely for their own profit gain.
Hope you are not one of them:)

I am short on LL and long on Aapl. And yeah, I made a bit of money from LL through betting on Whitney
Tilson's reports.


But I hope you're not buying Aapl cause you feel it's a good company and hope to gain from them - Cause it
clearly doesn't make sense for you to feel it's wrong to short but right to long.


Either way, we are both riding on their businesses whether they grow or fail.

I am not God. Yes, I do not know exactly what has been going on given the limited sources. We just know
based on what has been exposed to the public. Nobody knows exactly what has been going on. You are not
the exception. Tilson is not the exception either.


Yet, it is very clear that LL has been damaged by those uncertain negativity.


We all are biased in a good way or in a bad way. However, it is very important to recognize how our bias
based on non-proven sources and unconfirmed information might influence others' life in a negative way.


It is time for authorities to intervene!

We will find out the truth about if LL's product has damaging customers, and if so, how much it has damaged.
Is it very emergent situation? People are dying drastically due to LL's products? Well, if then, U.S.
government should have done something right away!!!


Hey, Obama! What are you up to??? It is really damaging seriously and then no actions taken until now,
shame on you, USA!!!


Well, I think U.S. government knows better.


On the other hand, there is another truth here we do not need to wait to see; you do not seem to recognize
how hard it is for the people who invest in this company to see their shares falling drastically over time without
knowing what has been going on behind the scene. Consequently, they suffer financially, emotionally, and
physically.

For instance, I could not sleep in the last three nights due to a sudden stock fall. It is very heart-aching which
caused my whole body aching.


How about LL's employees and their families? That's their daily bread. They also die fast due to the pains
caused by anxieties and uncertainties. 
Well, anyways we all are dying. Living a life is a process of dying.


When some people are happy for some reason, there are always others who suffer for the same reason.


How much damage and whose damage, we can not measure.


One thing clear, my heart and my body hurts.


We will find out how formidable behave in our body. I sure can't wait to see how U.S. government deals with

What irks me about the whole $LL ordeal is that in my view the company really wasn't doing anything that Lowe's
$LOW or probably a number of other flooring retailers didn't also do. Heck the entire furniture industry has a massive
lobby group that is trying to prevent formaldehyde regulation in its products, but we rarely hear much about that.


The lobby group that is attempting to prevent the government from regulating formaldehyde testing of furniture that is
sold in the United States, The American Home Furnishings Alliance, includes employees of public companies like La-
Z-Boy $LZB, Stanley Furniture $STLY and Hooker Furniture $HOFT but I don't see anyone attacking them in special
exposes or with public short presentations.

It seems to me as though the negative publicity from the short cheerleader Whitney Tilson has a lot to do with the pain
in $LL. I don't really even have much skin in this game, but it rubs me the wrong way when hedge funds are so public
with their shorts and then cheer as real people lose their jobs and retirees lose their savings. It's scummy. If Tilson
was really trying to do something for the good of the American public like he may even have convinced himself that
he's doing, then why not donate all of the proceeds from the $LL short to some charity, much like Bill Ackman has
pledged to do in his fight with Herbalife $HLF?


Hedge funds making public short presentations of companies is an issue that really pushes my buttons. I have been
involved in real life feuds with Spruce Point Capital Management and Prescience Point "Research" (I wouldn't be
surprised in the least if the two are somehow related) about their shady, pumper short positions. IMHO, that aspect of
the industry is terrible. I understand the need for hedge funds to short some companies. While I prefer shorts to be
complete frauds, I even understand the need to short real companies as a hedge to a certain extent, that's where the
term "hedge" fund got its name from. I don't personally engage in it, but I get it. What I cannot stand is funds that take
very public pompous, holier-than-thou short positions in companies and then cheer in the media and on Twitter as real
people are harmed.

LL is the focus of a damning video from an undercover environmental group for buying Chinese lumber they
knew was coming from protected Siberian Tiger forest in Russia. That started the ball rolling on the idea that
this might not be an ethical player. Then Tilson brought their poisonous Chinese flooring to 60 minutes. My
question to you is this: Assume for a second that the environmental group suing LL, 60 Minutes and Tilson
are right (and the sudden exit of the CEO indicates there are serious issues here) then if this is not a moral
use of a short then what does a moral short look like? Isn't this company perpetrating a fraud on every buyer
of their flooring who believes that the flooring is safe and that its sourced from ethically cut forests? And who
is going to uncover that fraudulent behavior better than someone with a profit motive to work hard to bring the
truth to light?


21 May 2015, 01:48 PM


bassmaster general
There is no evidence to suggest that Lowes, Home Depot or anyone else is selling formaldehyde floors in the
volumes that LL was. LL was doing it. They were caught on tape and then they lied about it. That's why the
stock is getting nailed. That's why the shorts are making a killing.

It's just an investing technique.


 
As Tony Soprano would say, just before whacking someone ..."It's not personal ... it's just business".


21 May 2015, 01:56 PM


Special Situation News
I honestly am not convinced that if the Chinese flooring if installed correctly and not crushed up into tiny
pieces is dangerous. It certainly isn't more dangerous than the formaldehyde glue that is being used in things
like baby furniture sold by that industry.


The purpose of my post was not to debate the quality of the testing done, but to point out the hypocrisy of
Whitney Tilson pretending to take the moral high ground in this case. If he was truly concerned about people
then he'd close his short at this point after getting the CEO and CFO fired, the company to stop selling
Chinese laminate flooring and the government to investigate the situation and donate the proceeds to charity.


Has he done that? No. He continues to be short and seems as though he will only be happy if Lumber
Liquidators goes to $0, causing the loss of thousands of jobs and the loss of millions of dollars in the
retirement portfolios of people who had absolutely nothing to do with this situation.


It completely rubs me the wrong way when shorty hedge funds go out and cheer for others to lose money, like
Tilson did when he Tweeted about buying government regulators drinks in Omaha after the investigation was
announced. And that's just the one that I've seen. I'm sure that there's others. Causing people to lose money
and lose their jobs is not a laughing matter.


Again, I don't have a whole lot of skin in this game one way or anther. It's just that the way some hedge fund
managers act disgusts me as a human being. For good or for bad, I see most things in life as being black and
white, rather than shades of gray and in my opinion Tilson's actions in this case have been wrong or at the
very least in poor taste and classless, so I said something about it.

Hi TMF,


If Whitney (or anyone else) wants to take moral high-ground they..


1) Use their own money and 
2) Spend it, or 
3) Donate it


They do NOT...


1) Use other people's money 
2) Invest it on an exchange 
3) Take a fee

This is the world we live in. The corporatization of America where consumers (and investors) are mislead left
and right. The free market cannot work without free dissemination of information. Workers are caught in a
bind. Gag rules put on employees who could have leaked such misdeeds before they got to this point. No
regulators left to protect the consumer due to underfunding and antiregulatory climate. Who left to "air out the
dirty laundry"? If it is the short sellers, then so be it.

I agree with you so much.. further it's disheartening that the public is so easily manipulated with false

Has Tilson considered that he might be affecting others health due to placebo factors?


21 May 2015, 02:10 PM

TMF,


you're making an assertion in the absence of evidence - "I honestly am not convinced that if the Chinese
flooring if installed correctly and not crushed up into tiny pieces is dangerous. It certainly isn't more dangerous
than the formaldehyde glue that is being used in things like baby furniture sold by that industry." What we do
know is that other suppliers flooring was tested along with LLs and found to be in compliance with industry
regulations and standards. That's it. If you "feel" others are just as guilty in other industries, by all means, go
and perform your own testing and begin initiating your own short positions.


I don't think Tilson took any high ground in this. He's clearly laid out his short case for a while now - it just
ended up being a much bigger opportunity than he initially realized. He's found many discrepencies in the
company and continues to find them so he's keeping his short position. If his investors are happy (I'm sure
they are), why should he cash out of his short position and donate to charity? That's not in anyone's best
interest.


Yes, if LL goes to 0 people will be out of jobs but that's capitalism for ya.

Hi RationalExuberance,


Agree with your social commentary.


I just don't see how the short sellers weed out those that cause the problems.... senior management.


It's investors and rank-n-file that are hurt ... many have no idea what's going on.


Make officers and directors personally liable (with no escape clause) and it would be a start. Right now, the
shareholders finance the defense of the executives that made these wrong-headed decisions.


And if that isn't strange enough, shorts actually benefit from the company defending the perpetrators.


The short sellers don't get a vote, it's the longs that need to do something. The longs (mostly institutional)
need to start asking "How" instead of "How much".


21 May 2015, 02:20 PM


Special Situation News
There is absolutely evidence that Lowes was selling similar Chinese laminate flooring yet no one is going
after them for it.


To the best of my knowledge no one from $LL has ever been "caught on tape" talking about flooring with
illegal levels of formaldehyde, the person who was worked for a Chinese supplier and correct me if I'm wrong
I don't think that anyone knows if he knew what he was talking about or how high a level employee he was.


21 May 2015, 02:24 PM


Special Situation News
Shorting exists and while I personal don't like profiting from others' misery I understand why it does. If Tilson
said that he was out to make money for his investors and left it at that I wouldn't have a problem with it. My
problem is that he is very publically pretending or has deluded himself into believing that he's on some sort of
moral crusade for the good of humanity. That's the tone that I get from him and that definitely is not the case.


21 May 2015, 02:27 PM


Special Situation News
It's fine to take the view that morality has no place in investing. That's not my stance, but I really don't have a
problem with people who believe that. My problem is when people try to shield themselves from any criticism
about trying to make money off of costing people their jobs and retirement savings by pretending that they are
shorting something because it is "Evil" to use Tilson's own word. When I see hypocrisy I point it out.

From the very outset (going back almost two years) people have been begging LL to remove the product,
investigate the claims and then, if all clear, reintroduce.


This, by the way, is the only path that has proven to work for many companies on these types of issues.


LL resisted and put the spin doctors to work.


Now, when Lowes came across the problem they removed product pending investigation. They did the right
thing, LL did the wrong thing. (of course they had a chance to see the disaster LL brought upon itself)


That's why LL is being punished and Lowes isn't.


It's never the crime.... it's the cover-up.


p.s Regarding the mill worker ... that needs to be vetted, not ignored. Dismissing him is part of the cover-up.

What is the morality of a high profile fund manager relying on a test that he must know by now is not

Yeah man, go buy out the LL and keep selling those products to people. I'm sure you can manage that with
your kind heart.


But seriously, how can you weigh a few thousand jobs VS the risk of a few thousand victims of cancerous
products?  
- If you could chose to save 1 group, which would it be?  
There's clearly a no straight forward answer. 
- Or why don't you first blame the CEO LL for choosing to risk themselves by importing products with quality
risk? If the end result goes to shorts favor then they should have noted that risk of losing the company. 
If LL was all prestigious and all that then they wouldn't have faced this issue today. Shorts (Including me)
would've lost a bunch of money already. But the fact that people are finding issue here and there, there is
clearly some questions raised with the company.


Honestly, sometimes change is needed, but no one realistically likes it and no one has the time to point out
every single change that should be made. No one can possibly see through every issue because we
ourselves have issues already. Whitney Tilson has faced more than enough risk and pressure for what he
decided to do with LL (I mean, I'm not fully supporting him because I don't know him personally but at least I
give him the respect going through with this risk - His company, his reputation. Pretty much his future if he
ended up being wrong).  
So the question is then, if change is needed, what would you have done if any company was supposedly
selling cancerous products (Suppose you had hard, clear cut evidence that will shut down LL)?  
- Compare that to if you knew someone that embezzled $100million. Would you have done the same thing? If

you ended up choosing to report the embezzlement: 
1. you clearly ruined the life of someone and  
2. if you did, then how was it wrong for Whitney Tilson to report LL? Please don't try to weigh the life of 1
person against a few thousand - Cause you really can't.  
3. well if you didn't, I'm curious what you'd do. 
Alright those are just hypothetical situations but to be real, no one has all the time in the world to catch all the
bad guys, nor do many people care. I'd just go with anything I am be sure of being 90% right.


Why should the donation of his profit be something that "should" be done for simply pointing out an issue and
taking advantage of the issue?  
- It's like saying "Aapl is a good company, I'm going to invest $100million into Aapl stocks cause I see the
value. To show my integrity, I am going to donate all the proceeds to some charity to help cancer." I can't see
how it makes more sense to donate your proceeds with you short a stock compared to longing a stock. 
Honestly, I don't even think it's right for people to say donating is what we should do. Donating is from the
heart, people should choose how they want to spend their hard work and wealthy - that's part of the reason
why I chose to live in where I am now. I do what I want with my money (Honestly, I'm hella poor even though
that probably sounded like I wasn't but you get what I mean right?).

many months before the 60-minutes show aired. One wonders....


21 May 2015, 02:50 PM

Ken,


In order for the manufacturer to get CARB certification they have to submit to multiple unannounced third
party CARB certified inspectors test the product each year. LL one up's this and does their own multiple
announced and unannounced inspections and tests each year and built their own multi million dollar test
apparatus based on the ASTM standard for the CARB test.


It's possible the manufacturer found a way to beat this system and sell non compliant flooring to LL but it is
not true that nobody has ever looked into whether the products are compliant. a CARB certified third party
does it multiple times a year unannounced.


21 May 2015, 02:54 PM


Milkweed, Contributor
BTW the third party that inspects and tests multiple times a year unannounced does so on behalf of CARB in
order for them to certify the manufacturer. You may not have seen the test results but the people at CARB

Hi Milkweed,


I really don't know what issue you are addressing.


I never said "nobody ever has looked" into the product. All I've ever said is that the statement made by the
mill worker needs to be vetted.


When someone makes a statement that fraud is being committed, it is reasonable to look into it. You want to
dismiss it.


Why do you have such a problem with this?


21 May 2015, 03:27 PM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi Milkweed,


If there was fraud, then anything can happen.


Lack of current action by CARB is not a decision by CARB. When a decision is rendered we'll know what, if
any, action is being taken.


There are plenty of criminals currently under investigation for various crimes. The fact that any or all have not
yet been charged with anything does not mean that they are not still under scrutiny and certainly does not
exonerate them.


Why do you have such a hard time understanding this?

Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi Milkweed,


Two years ago Zhou, right here on SA, exposed LL. Read his article it is no less than what I said. Maybe if
you did some DD, you'd see that I'm correct in my statement.


No one, including you knows if the product is CARB compliant. All anybody knows is ...


1) The product was manufactured 
2) It was labeled as CARB compliant 
3) A mill worker says it was deliberately mislabeled 
4) Deconstructive tests confirm a possibility it was non-compliant 
5) LL's own tests confirm incidents of excessive emissions that exceed statistically acceptable limits 
6) The whole matter is currently under investigation 
7) LL has removed the product and has changed sourcing


So, since LL, Lowes, CARB and other agencies are currently investigating to determine if the product is/isn't
CARB compliant as well as if there was/wasn't any fraud involved, how can you assert it is free of fraud and
compliant?


Did you get an advance copy of the investigations report?


21 May 2015, 04:39 PM


Milkweed, Contributor
1) The product was manufactured 
2) It was labeled as CARB compliant because the manufacturer submitted to multiple unannounced
inspections every year by a third party certified by CARB tasked with testing the product for CARB
compliance and it passed. 
3) A mill worker to whom we know nothing about his credentials to understand CARB or his motivation to talk
about LL's products to a potential competitor says it was deliberately mislabeled however he is apparently
MIA and will likely never be available for a trial in the U.S. 
4) Deconstructive tests confirm nothing as there is no standard by which to judge their results. 
5) LL's own tests confirm 3% of home tests failed however formaldehyde can come from many sources so we
have no proof that LL's products were responsible for this. 97% of the test passed. 
6) The whole matter is currently under investigation, however CARB feels comfortable enough with their
controls that they have taken no action against LL or the manufacturer three months since the 60 Minutes
piece came out and two year since the other S.A. author made his allegations. 
7) LL has removed the product and has changed sourcing, most likely because perception trumps reality in
the sales business and there is no need to be a martyr for Chinese flooring manufacturers.

Hi Milkweed,


You just don't get it, or you don't want to get it.


I put down what we know. You added what you speculate. Go speculate.  
Every point you make is just conjecture. See how far that gets you.


To quote John Billings ...


" "The trouble ain't what people don't know, it's what they know that ain't so."


Maybe you should read the recent post from one reader that was so conflicted reading all the longs, he said
he should have just listened to Reel Keen (sic) in the first place. It would have made him $7000.


I also helped zorrow last week stay away from a long position. Glad your article didn't come out sooner.


Why not try to quantify how much money you've taken out of the pockets of readers buying into your false
hope?


Your incessant conjecture does exactly what you intend it to do ... cloud the issues. But don't worry, I'm not
going away and I'll keep readers on track.


READERS: Anyone that takes a firm stand on what is going on is just speculating and using conjecture. The
truth will come out at some point and we will all know where it lies. Trust no one, there is much more to this
story than anyone can imagine. that's what I said a month ago, and I'm sticking to it.


In the meantime, LL is not an investible stock. It is a gambling man's stock. Place a bet, spin the wheel,
everyone's a winner! If that's your style, why not, go for it. If you are trying to make intelligent decisions about

Well, why don't we sue all the companies for providing the source of causing cancer. Look around and tell me

Ken other than conjecturing why LL stopped selling the product recently everything I posted was a fact. The
third party testing is a fact not conjecture, what we don't know about the factory worker is a fact not
conjecture, no standards to judge the deconstructive test results by is a fact not conjecture, multiple sources
of formaldehyde in the home is a fact not conjecture, CARB has taken no action against LL or the
manufacturer three months after the 60 Minutes piece and 2 years after Whitney's tutor brought the same
allegations up is a fact not conjecture.


Anyone who bought into LL thinking it was going no where but up, smooth sailing ahead was deluding
themselves. I calculate normalized earnings after this blows over in a year or so at ~$2.00/ share. Given they
have 6-8 years of store growth in just the U.S. and Canada ahead of them they should get a 20X-25X multiple
when the dust settles. Do the math. If someone jumped in purely because of my article and bailed purely
because todays news and sell off scared them, I feel bad they lost money but it's their fault. IMO if they took
the time to understand the entire story and got comfortable with the risks as well as the potential reward and
wait this thing out they would likely do exceptionally well. I added today.

"Now, when Lowes came across the problem they removed product "


That's not what I read. My understanding is they only removed the product after having been publicly exposed
-- presumably that's different from when they first knew what their own products are. And if not, what does
that say about Lowes' management?


The difference with Lowes is that they're not on the receiving end of an orchestrated negative public publicity
campaign. It's the difference between what's denounced v what's actually problematic.

There's no reason to assume CARB will render a decision here. It's not their job to run after rumors.
Regulatory agencies are understaffed and typically wait until they receive a great deal of public pressure
before pursuing an investigation. The shorts would be utter idiots to encourage an official determination when
they're doing so well with a misinformation campaign, so there may well be no one applying this pressure.

use it. Multiple inspections??? LOL. Seriously, nobody knows how the world works. Here is how you get
CARB certified: you call up SGS, ask them to come and test some product(s) (you select which ones), they
test, and then they give you a certificate. This is anywhere in the world! You do realize that the factory in
which the laminate is made sources the HDF from yet another factory, right? Moreover, there are 49 other
states in the US and hundreds of countries that could care less about CARB, so isn't it just possible that the
laminate factories simultaneously source non-compliant (well technically it is compliant if not sold in
California...I won't get into E1 stds, but you know what I mean) as well as compliant HDF? So, if you have
both types of HDF in the factory, why do you think it is so unreasonable that a company would not request
that non-CARB compliant HDF be used instead of CARB HDF when the margins are better? Well, it's
unethical, and false advertising, but if no one is paying attention (until Zhou came along), it's an easy 100 bps
or so of pure profit. And no, there is no one testing finished goods at the factory. Customers do this when they
receive the shipment, and they follow the CARB SOP to ensure they are purchasing CARB compliant
laminate if that was indeed specified in the PO. How else are you going to know you are getting what you
paid for? 
3) Why do you think he is MIA? That's laughable. Have you looked for him?  
4) not true; while I'll agree that deconstructive testing can yield variable results, there's absolutely no question
that a laminate product registering, per the deconstructive SOP for finished goods, a 1.18ppm CH2O reading
is/was non-compliant. I still can't quite grasp how many people can't understand it is the magnitude of the
failure which is dispositive. Sure some of the readings for "thick" HDF slightly above the .11 threshold might
be inconclusive, but the ones that failed by a factor of 4 or more??? Come on now. 
5) I don't disagree 
6) you are assuming here; however, CARB did state that people shouldnt go around ripping up their floors 
7) mostly agree. LL is never proactive, and in this instance they are probably overreacting.

Hi SanDiegoNonSurfer,


LL has made several "testing claims"


They "screen-test" received product before putting on the shelves and discard non compliant product.


They then submit the "passing grade"product to a lab for CARB compliant testing and have 100% CARB
compliance.


Now, they disclose that at least 3% of their recent tests ( "idiot test") show excessive levels.


A sample of a sample should not have such a disparate result.


The facts, just the facts.


22 May 2015, 06:33 AM


Robin Hewitt, Contributor
"Now, they disclose that at least 3% of their recent tests ( "idiot test") show excessive levels. "


Disingenuous and untrue.


The 3% you're talking about were not LL's tests. These were tests done on samples of air gathered by self-
selected members of the public who contacted LL and said, send me an air sampling kit. They got an air
sampling module and instructions. What they did with it is anyone's guess. After doing some unknown X, the
module is sent to a lab for analysis. All we know is the number at the end of that.


To call that "a test" is equivalent to tallying the remarks from callers to a Rush Limbaugh show and calling that
a survey.


Actual testing is not done with a three-step process in which the second step is "and then a miracle happens"
(http://bit.ly/1AjpRbM)


That only 3% were anomalous in this circumstance would surprise anyone familiar with actual testing. For all
we know, Tilson's minions could have snatched up 5% or more of the test kits as soon as they became
available, bought a bottle of formaldehyde online from Amazon (http://amzn.to/1AjpRIJ) and hovered the
sampler over the open bottle inside a sealed plastic container for 24 hours.


The intended purpose of these kits was never to perform a test of the actual products. That would be a
complete joke. It was offered so that customers could reassure themselves. Even assuming they were used
as intended, the absolute only thing one could conclude from the outliers is that follow-up is warranted. As
even the test-kit manufacturer has tried to communicate:  
"It's not an 'oh my gosh' kind of test," said Alan Wozniack, president of the Florida-based Environmental

Hi SanDiegoSurfer,


You misread what I said. LL has, in fact, made these DISCLOSURES.


You argue they weren't LL's test, they were someone else's. Technically correct, but somewhat misleading.
They were someone else's test, authorized and promoted by LL. If I had said "LL disclosed that someone
else's test showed..." it would have been completely misleading, whereas, my actual statement is easily
understood.


So, if being technically correct and at the same time confusing the issue is your preferred option ... well.....


Lastly, your entire diatribe about tainted test results is 100% conjecture.


So, taking your comments and running them together, let me rephrase my statement and you decide if it
makes more/less sense.


Original Statement = ""LL's own tests confirm incidents of excessive emissions that exceed statistically
acceptable limits"


SanDiegoNonSurfer Compliant Statement = "LL's idiot test, which they announced, authorized, promoted and
had mailed to LL's customers, results of which were analyzed by a lab chosen, authorized and overseen by
LL, confirmed incidents of excessive emissions in 3% of the respondents, but if we discount these results
because the veracity of the sample is not controlled and it may be tainted by those wanting to harm LL or
aggrandized by those trying to save LL, either of which we cannot assert because what LL got is what LL
asked for, and in the first place, anyone could have seen that the tests were just a bogus cover-up attempt,
that if favorable would be marketed and if unfavorable dismissed as not representative and in releasing the
results LL tried to focus attention to the 97% that passed, which, of course were, unlike the 3% that failed,
much more representative, and it was never LL's intent to let anyone focus on the 3% that failed, so since the
entire test was just a bogus, unscientific marketing ploy, any attempt to put a statistical significance on it is
impossible, and since the object is to just confuse everyone with speculation and conjecture nothing can ever
be concluded that show LL in an unfavorable light because LL is the "golden Child" and the stock everyone
should own."


There... does that work for you?

"DISCLOSURES" are not tests. A dictionary will confirm this.


It's a diatribe because I've actually had experience with testing and have worked at the EPA helping to
develop test SOPs, so I know what a joke it is that these are being called "test results" as if they're on par with
what a certified lab does. That people are walking around calling this "a test result" is mind boggling.


I've proposed two realistic ways that bias alone (not even counting human error) could give the anomalous
(3%) results. You'll have to describe for me the process by which longs may have distorted the results. Are
you proposing that 99% of the test units were purchased by shareholders? If so, think what that implies.
Probability alone tells you that the smaller, 3%, fraction is more likely to have been tampered with than the
much larger, 97%. Members of class action suits and shorts (who are well known for running campaigns to
sway public opinion) have a far better chance of influencing that split than people trying to protect their share
price because they only have to capture a few samples. In fact, it would have been pointless for longs to play
this game, since they'd have to capture all samples to succeed -- according to your model.

"so since the entire test was just...bogus...any attempt to put a statistical significance on it is [erroneous]"


In edited form, this is true.


"and since the object is to just confuse everyone with speculation and conjecture"


Was that the object? I'm not a mind reader, so I can't say for certain it wasn't. I presumed the object was to
give purchasers a way to alleviate any fears they might have -- which is the expressed intent and something
that makes sense to offer in a world where you can trust others.

That's not even worth discussing since A) it's ridiculous, and B) has no relevance to whether these home kit
results can be considered a scientifically valid test that LL did of their products.


I can understand you have a strong opinion and believe you've found evidence that vindicates that opinion.
However, that "evidence" is not valid. I can further understand that this must be frustrating. But the (frustrating
for all) fact remains that there is as yet nothing that will stand up as actual evidence. There are allegations,
allusions, a bit of heresay, and some of what a court would call circumstantial evidence. None of these rise to
the level of actual evidence, and we have at least as much circumstantial evidence of an orchestrated

Furthermore, your defense of the results of the test is they are not accurate.


Hurray!! That's what I and others said from the beginning. It was just a marketing ploy.


That said, LL did try to spin it as 97% positive .. so if they can do that, I can look at the other 3%. What's good
for the goose...etc...


I didn't see you or anyone come out when LL said it was 97% positive, condemning the tests at that point.

I don't think you understand this at all. The negative results are not equally suspect as the positive ones. That
would be the case even if the proportion were somewhat higher. This is true by the very nature of the process
and how the results were obtained.


The reason this is so is because it's nearly impossible to get a low reading if the flooring in the room were
outgassing at high levels. OTOH, even if the flooring is not outgassing at all, there are an innumerable
number of ways to get a high reading. Do you truly not understand this? That's not "spin", it's fundamental
math.

know how the testing works, it's spelled out in CARB's certification requirements. A third party inspector
certified by CARB to do the inspections and test on CARB's behalf does multiple inspections and tests per

that a laminate product registering, per the deconstructive SOP for finished goods, a 1.18ppm CH2O reading
is/was non-compliant." 
**********************...


Assuming CH2O is the chemical symbol for formaldehyde, there are a number of organizations with all kinds
of standards for what they consider to be safe levels of formaldehyde. OSHA for instance allows up to 750
ppm. I know for a fact thresholds for safety are not set at the absolute border between safe and not safe a
factor of safety of orders of magnitude is built into the threshold so we can safely assume real world concerns
about exposure to formaldehyde are probably in the thousands of ppm. Hell there is no national mandate for
formaldehyde emissions and this whole argument is only germane to product sold in California. As many
others have pointed out this argument was never about safety it was always about compliance.

Hi SanDiegoNonSurfer,


Thanks for the math lesson. Since my training is in actuarial science and statistics I think I'm equipped to
handle this, so I'll give it a stab.


Let's see, we conduct an experiment on a sample. We set arbitrary parameters that eliminate outliers as not
representative. The parameters are not set in accordance with statistical models, there is no null hypothesis
tested and no calculation of the p-value or confidence level of the sample.


I've heard of this method once before. In fact, I wrote two articles about it.


I'll try to simplify it for those that think they understand math....


A teacher wants to determine the proficiency of their students and devises a test. The test is deemed valid
only if a student passes the test.


Now, statisticians evaluating this construction would conclude that if a student fails the test .. the test is
invalid. They would perform various test, such as a null hypothesis and p-value to assure themselves.


The teacher, on the other hand, says that if a student fails the test, the test is invalid only with respect to that
student and only that student's test result is to be rendered invalid.


At least one student fails the test.


The statistician concludes the test is invalid and no inference can be made.

Ok, now I'm really starting to wonder if you've lost perspective.


It's not a matter of what a teacher says, but of the number of ways that a result can be obtained. If you have a
stats background, that shouldn't be so hard to understand. There's only one way to throw a 12 with a pair of
die (6,6), but 4 ways to throw a 5: 2(2,3)+2(1,4).


Same principle here. There's only one way (barring error) to get a low reading, but an uncountable number of
ways to get a high reading. This isn't teacher says, nor arbitrary rules. It's a matter of counting.


The negative results have a higher weight because 1) there's only one likely way to obtain it and 2) there's
less chance that these outcomes were manipulated. The probability of the floor not outgassing in these cases
is close to one. OTOH, there are so many ways to get the high reading, with floor outgassing being one of a
very high number, that the chances of the high readings being due to the floor outgassing are 1/(really big
number), IOW, something less than one, and possibly close to zero. Additionally, there's plenty of motivation
for manipulating a high result, pushing the likeihood of floor outgassing as cause closer to zero.


You need to address the math directly, not skirt it with irrelevancies.


Unfortunately, I'm leaving for the weekend, so I won't have a chance to see what other non-relevant examples
you come up with until Monday evening. Have fun.

With regard to "there are an innumerable number of ways to get a high reading"


Excerpt from the Q&As between CPSC with Matt Townsend, Bloomberg News: CPSC Chairman Elliot F.
Kaye’s Statement on Lumber Liquidators  
http://1.usa.gov/1LtUvAa


Matt Townsend:...And I guess you kind of mentioned this earlier, just the idea of formaldehyde, one of the
points Lumber Liquidators have made is formaldehyde comes from a lot of different products so just because
there might be a level of formaldehyde in a home doesn’t mean it’s coming from their flooring. It could be from
something else. So how do you sort of differentiate on that front? So, I guess, two questions there.


Elliot Kaye:Yes. Yes, and thanks, Matt. So let me clarify. So we’re definitely testing samples of the flooring
products but we’re not going to test and specific homes. What we do is we try to replicate and model home-
based exposure scenarios. So, for instance, what are the typical home exposure scenarios that a consumer
might face? But we’re not going to actually go into specific homes and do testing in those homes. Does that
help?

There are many ways to get false readings on both ends. And just as many ways to spin the outcomes.


Thank you for confirming what I and others have been saying for a long while ... the home test is a marketing
ploy. It proves nothing.

everyone would have been able to match expectations with outcomes.

The third party inspections are supposed to be unannounced but if we go by your theory that the inspectors
are being bribed I'm sure this is easy enough to work around, just have a pile of the good stuff sitting around
waiting for them to show up. This isn't something I didn't think of, I don't think it's likely but it's not out of the
realm of possibility.


That said I would be shocked if LL was crazy enough to be in on this scheme and flabbergasted if they were
stupid enough to leave a paper trail if they were insane enough to be in on this. Lowes pulling Chinese
laminate suggests to the extent this might be true, it's the manufacturers not the retailers. LL no longer sells
Chinese laminate so it doesn't matter what the manufacturers have in their factories at this point.


I agree the manufacturers probably do sell non CARB compliant flooring to customers doing business in the
rest of the world outside of California and my guess is the 60 Minutes spy posing as a potential buyer made it
clear he was interested non CARB compliant flooring if the price was right but worried about getting caught
and that's what lead to him and the worker discussing LL's products with the worker telling this customer what
he wanted to hear "it's O.K. everyone does it". Unless that guy relocates to the U.S. I seriously doubt he'll
ever turn up testifying against his Chinese employer.


As Tilson points out CARB has been doing the deconstructive test for a long time for it's own purposes
(looking to eventually develop a standard for this test) so they didn't need 60 Minutes test results to know
what the results of LL's products would be using this test I'm sure they have their own and would have taken
action against LL by now if that test could determine compliance to their standard the way 60 Minutes experts
try to assert.


So yes it's possible the manufacturer beat the independent unannounced testing by bribing the inspectors. I
doubt it but it doesn't matter because no one will ever be able to prove it.


In regard to MDF/DHF I'm not sure what you find funny but the product in question is MDF board, not HDF.

Evidence and similar do not belong in the same sentence. It's conjecture. Do other companies selling
Chinese laminate floooring? Absolutely but China is a big country with millions of different manufacturers -

Jason - Not to mention that B of A just made a 100 million dollar RLC bet on the company - secured by
"formaldehyde-drenched" flooring. Maybe Tilson is setting up a few more suckers to take out his short

You seem to know the term "DD" but not the players for LL - like BofA - If you don't know the players - it's like
betting on a football team because you like (or not) the color of their uniforms. DD (Due Diligence - for the
unwashed) is required of the banking industry by the federal government - who insures the banks deposits.
Investment houses and idiots like Tilson do not have similar requirements - hence the SEC requirement for a
prospectus - where the government assumes unqualified YOU will do your own DD. At this point you just
called BofA's recent $100 million dollar bet on Lumber Liquidators (secured by its flooring inventory) a fraud, a
lie and therefor a violation of Federal law. Do you think you might be just a little out of your depth here?

confirming that 3% of samples escaped QA. And that's hogwash.

I never said the test was valid .. I simply said that LL's own tests confirm the results. I never passed on the
validity and the context was simply in a "what do we know".


We know that LL's tests confirmed the 3% because they said it does. Whether or not it was valid is
speculation and NOT something we know.


Nice try, though. next time, just make up a quote and I'll have to look it up before I discredit it.

"TMFDeej: It's fine to take the view that morality has no place in investing. That's not my stance, but I really
don't have a problem with people who believe that."


I think Jim Cramer supports the view that morality has no place in investing. At least it seemed so when he
pilloried Bill Ackman for Bill's attack on Herbalife based on his contention that it rips off poor people - Cramer
said there's no place in investing for a moral short, much like we're reading here (and note that Ackman has
donated all proceeds from the Herbalife short to charity). But consider what Wholefoods' Chairman, John
Mackey, has to say about morality in investing in his book 'Conscious Capitalism': "The essence of business
[is] basically based on voluntary exchange for mutual benefit. ...[B]usiness is the great creator value for other
people and it’s fundamentally a force for good in the world. And I just don’t think most people understand
that."


If John is right that business is 'a force for good' then business is inherently a moral undertaking. And if that is
correct, then it would seem to follow that owning a piece of that 'moral undertaking' is also a moral
undertaking. In other words, as an owner of a virtuous company that brings good to the world, you are acting
morally. And conversely, if you own, say, a slave plantation, even if you own only a bit of it, it seems to me
that you are engaged in an immoral enterprise and are acting immorally.


If that is correct, then investing (owning pieces of businesses) is loaded with moral hazard and we can't
escape the moral ramifications of ownership. By taking ownership positions in businesses that do not act
morally, particularly if we hold ourselves to be moral, we make ourselves into hypocrites. If we tell our kids
that smoking is bad but we own a piece of Altria how are we not in a compromised moral position? Can we
get away with the karma of owning a slave plantation simply by stating that 'morality has no place in
investing'? I sincerely doubt it.

Hi Whitney,


You weave a nice story, but it's overly dramatic and unrealistic.


What most likely happened is as follows..


1) After the 60 minutes piece Lynch assured the Board it was false 
2) Lynch almost surely had to put forth a "combat-plan" and sold it to the board.  
3) The combat plan included the, now infamous, simulcast and blitz 
4) The combat plan included denouncing the testing methods 
5) The combat plan included "idiot test kits (or is it idiot "test kits") 
6) These types of combat plans usually carry assurances that put someone's career on the line.


Once lowes surfaced with the same problem and took the appropriate action (removing product) LL's wrong-headed
combat plan was exposed.


a) Lynch was forced to follow suit and cease product sales... 
b) The Board felt betrayed by the combat plan 
c) Bye, bye Lynch


It is extremely doubtful that Lynch left because of the regulatory pressure. That seemed to be going his way or
neutral.

Whitney, I have respect for you but I think you are going too far here. For example, there are many companies that
you could say who would care if they went bankrupt. It does not mean they will go BK. Also, the CEO resignation is
not that surprising and it could be for many reasons but the most obvious is that he may not want to deal with lawsuits
and regulators as most CEO's want to run a company and not be in a meat grinder every day for the next year or two.


This company made a mistake and will pay for it, just as Exxon did with the Valdez, Merck did with Vioxx, JNJ did with
Tylenol, etc.....


I would not buy LL here but I would not be short it either. Too much risk on both sides.

In response to some of the comments, including those of Jackooo and Mark Gierach above, I might be able to shed
some light on what may be going on. Bear in mind this is speculation, but I have some familiarity with the general
area.


The following excerpts from LL press releases may provide some clues to what is potentially going on. My comments
are in brackets.


May 7, 2015


". . .


As previously announced, a Special Committee composed of independent directors, with the assistance of third party
advisors, has been conducting a review of allegations regarding laminate flooring sourced from China. This review
includes a comprehensive review of the Company's sourcing compliance program and related policies. The review is
ongoing and any findings are preliminary."


[When allegations of illegal conduct arise, it is common for company management to seek legal advice. Typically
attorneys do not have sufficient information to give legal advice relating to the potentially illegal conduct.
Consequently, they frequently conduct an "Upjohn" investigation, which is an investigation into the underlying facts
that relate to the potentially illegal conduct. In conducting that investigation, the attorney represents the company, not
individual officers or directors.


In fact, one thing that the attorney wants to do is to figure out if any employees, or in particular, company
management, officers, or directors have broken the law and if so what the underlying circumstances are relating to
that activity (e.g., was it contrary to company policy/procedures, or IAW policy, procedures, practices; who knew
and/or sanctioned the activity, etc.)


The "third-party advisors" in the press release might possibly refer to an outside legal counsel. Note below that the
Freeh group was engaged in March 2015. ]


. . .


"Based on the review to date, it appears that the Company's Chinese laminate flooring suppliers have sold product to
the Company that the suppliers have certified and labeled as compliant with California formaldehyde standards.
However, the Company is further reviewing the underlying certification and labeling processes and practices of its
suppliers. In light of this and mounting industry concerns relating to laminate products sourced from China, the
Company this week decided to suspend sales of all laminate flooring sourced from China pending completion of the
Special Committee's review."


. . .


"The Special Committee engaged Freeh Group International Solutions, LLC (the "Freeh Group") in March 2015 to
assist with its review of the Company's compliance program and related policies. The Freeh Group was founded by
Louis J. Freeh, former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and former federal judge, and has extensive
experience assessing compliance programs and helping companies ensure their operations remain compliant."


"Based on its preliminary review and in the ongoing effort to improve the compliance function at the Company, the
Special Committee has engaged the Freeh Group to serve as an independent compliance advisor to the Company."
5/23/2018 Thoughts On The Unexpected Resignation Of Lumber Liquidators' CEO - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3203026-thoughts-on-the-unexpected-resignation-of-lumber-liquidators-ceo 42/58


[I don't know exactly what this means, but I do take it as significant. This isn't the kind of thing typically in a press
release. One possible scenario would be that the Freeh Group had a limited scope of activities that they were looking
at initially, but information that they uncovered may have indicated that the scope of activities that should be looked at
should be broader. For example, in looking at information about suppliers, they could have come across information
that members of management knew of problems, learned of problems and didn't take appropriate action, etc. The
BOD could then have expanded their scope of inquiry.]


"TOANO, Va., May 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL) today announced that Robert M. Lynch
unexpectedly notified the Company of his resignation as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. The
Company intends to commence a national search for Mr. Lynch's replacement. In the interim, Thomas D. Sullivan, the
Company's Founder, will serve as the acting chief executive officer of the Company.


The Company also announced today that John M. Presley, the Company's lead independent director, has been
appointed as non-executive chairman of the board of directors. Both appointments are effective immediately. The
board of directors also accepted Mr. Lynch's resignation as a director of the Company."


[Hmmm. Again, speculation on my part, but one thing that can happen in these types of investigations is that you can
have employees, management, officers, etc. that choose not to cooperate. In fact, under certain circumstances when
the company is conducting an investigation, it may be appropriate for the company to "lawyer up" certain employees,
management, officers, who may have potential individual criminal liability.


Now in my experience, once someone gets lawyered up with an attorney that is concerned with just representing their
interests, it is not uncommon for that attorney to advise them not to cooperate with any internal company investigation
by giving a statement, answering questions, etc. Have you ever seen an attorney say "go ahead, talk to the police?"
Kind of the same thing. I can see circumstances where that might cause some tension.


If the company finds violations of law in its investigation, frequently it is a practical necessity to "self-report" those
violations to the appropriate regulatory authority. As a part of not being held criminally responsible for the actions of
an employee, officer, director, etc., it is common for the company to have to provide a copy of its investigation, witness
statements, etc. to the agency, many of which have criminal investigators. In other words, the investigation may well
find its way to law enforcement.]


By the way, if what I describe above happens to be accurate, I would not think of that as bad on the part of the BOD,
not at all. In fact, it is the kind of thing you want to see happen from a corporate governance standpoint. I would guess
they have a fairly robust inquiry going at this point. Now, I might wonder about them being a little slow on the draw if
they didn't start doing anything until this last March, but doing a thorough investigation is certainly proper. Also, I
wouldn't necessarily expect to hear all the details on what happens.


Frequently the investigations are privileged and if done by knowledgeable counsel, they could take rather elaborate
pains to ensure that the information remain privileged.


@Jackooo and Mark Gierach--


The company appears to be a Delaware Corporation. One of the reasons that people choose to incorporate in
Delaware is that its laws tend to be protective of officers and directors. Corporations are typically required to pay legal
fees in many cases unless it can be shown, e.g.,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3203026-thoughts-on-the-unexpected-resignation-of-lumber-liquidators-ceo 43/58


" if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation" or


" if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe the person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful."


See generally Section 145 of the Delaware Corporations Code, link below.


http://1.usa.gov/1HMlFE3


The Corporation's articles and by-laws are going to come into play in evaluating specific situations, but my
expectation (without having looked in this case) would be that it would be common for most corporations to adopt
provisions that would provide all the protections contemplated by the Delaware statute. Also note that the Delaware
Statute has provisions that could allow an officer or director entitled to indemnification to get the fees paid up front by
the corporation (the Court of Chancery provisions at the end essentially allow advancements to happen and I would
expect that on the front end they would err on the side of advancement, since legal fees can easily run into the
millions of dollars in some cases).

Everyone has certain cognitive biases that come into play when they invest. People that think they don't are simply
deluding themselves. Everyone can benefit by attempting to identify what cognitive biases are affecting their investing
decisions. This is an exercise I try to do myself on my investments. Charlie Munger also has given speeches to top
tier business schools discussing similar concepts.


I noticed in the comments to this article that there appears to be more emotion and intransigence involved in LL than
other companies. I would recommend you and everyone else read the list linked below and consider your investment
decisions with regard to LL as you do so.

@StumpLifter --


I haven't looked at it, but I would expect that the credit facility that BofA provided to LL is probably secured by all their
assets. In other words, it probably isn't too much of a stretch or evaluation on BofA's part: They probably get made
whole before anyone else gets anything.


So, if you are looking at that as some kind of imprimatur of quality, I would take the time to actually look at what it
says: It will be with their SEC filings. Given the size of the company and their apparent lack of significant
indebtedness, I personally wouldn't take much solace at all from that credit facility, if any.

StumpLifter
The point being that amidst all the naysayers - an ultra conservative institution with no "government guarantee" bet
$100 million of their own money and REPORTEDLY secured the RLC with inventory. While it's true that the bank does
not make a determination of product quality - they do look at the viability of the business, including pending law suits,
inventory turns (Sales), and in this case have made their own determination on the likely hood of LL successfully
defending against an onslaught of specious law suits. At the very least their Credit Facility flies in the face Tilson's
expectation that LL will fall to "Zero". The only "Zero" Tilson is going to see is the one in his brokerage account.

Just to be clear - BAC didn't simply give LL $100M, they provided the backing for revolving credit, which
replaced a former $50M line of credit and it had to be backed by $100M in inventory. It's the business world
equivalent of a line of credit.


It's also worth noting that it was secured before Sullivan resigned and before a federal probe was initiated.


I wouldn't necessarily look at it as a positive sign because a lot has happened since it was secured but it's
clearly better than the alternative (revoking a credit line).

Hi Stumplifter,


You raise interesting points ... but, I think, reach a conclusion that is not there.


First, it is common place for Banks to secure with inventory. For all we know the inventory could be worth
twice the amount loaned. It would be unusual for a 1:1 ratio. Now, if the ratio is 1:1, then you have an
indicator. Do you know the value of LL's total secured inventory?


Second, when the loan is secured by inventory, as inventory is sold, then the loan must be proportionally
repaid. So it restricts operating capital to that extent.


Third, you must differentiate this with unsecured debt, which is more indicative of the assessment of the future
health of the company.

Fourth, you than transform this into a statement about the stock price. Question ...... do you think that the
bank would have lent LL $100million and secured it by stock?


Of course not. You'd be crazy to think so.


So, if one wanted to look at the meaning of the loan (which I think is a mistake in any event) ........ the bank
has less faith in the business and the stock than they do in the inventory.


I fully appreciate that people sometimes read into things what they want to see, so sometimes corrective
lenses will help them see more clearly.

A note can be called at any time - with or without cause. Some of those commenting seem to think an RLC is
like a car loan. An RLC can be reduced or called at any moment in time after approval. The scrutiny - due
diligence - is ongoing. Even the Federal Auditors get a crack at it. So the timing of the approval is of little
consequence. The idea that the bank would pour good money after bad into a credit shows naivete with
regard to banking laws and Federal Regulations. Yes, I suppose it's possible - If you want to go to jail for
about 10 years.

This is actually one of the more onerous credit agreements I have ever seen. They, of course, have a first lien
on everything for that 100 million dollars. They also put them in a vise over the 60 minutes thing and the
representations that they make about it. I think the idea there is that if more bad news comes out that
indicates that they knew about it and/or it could have a material adverse effect, they will be toast under the
agreement.

You just proved that the negative claims made by commenters in this thread are without merit.


Assuming this information is taken from the original loan document, clearly the loan is made AFTER the 60
minutes report since it is referenced IN THE DOCUMENT AS YOU PRESENT IT!!!!


The rest is standard bank boiler plate - so - What's your point? That banks are careful when loaning out $100
million? If that surprises you then you have never tried to borrow a large sum of money from a bank as a
company.


So, your a rock climber? And "—the laws of physics do not apply to (you)."

Likewise, the laws of economics.

I almost don't know what to say to you. You want it soooo bad. Well, O.K., "Santa will come visit you this
year."


But, I wouldn't expect much from Lumber Liquidators. You know those references you found to be so
wonderfully heartening? Let me translate:


In spite of us only agreeing to give you a credit facility of a paltry $100 Million, and in spite of us having a first
lien on your inventory, your buildings, your company, anything anyone owes you, and anything you ever did or
thought about that might be worth money, which presumably should be many $100s of millions more than the
paltry $100 million we agreed to lend in the credit facility, unless your market capitalization is absurdly high
and unless your inventory might not be worth squat, both of which concern us greatly, which is why we are
insisting on you agreeing to give us absolutely first dibs on absolutely everything you have or might ever
have, now or in a future life to secure our paltry $100 Million loan.


Not only that, but we don't like this stuff about the funny flooring on 60 minutes one bit. In fact, we are going to
make a special point of talking about that and the representations you made to us about it a whole bunch right
here in the up front part of the document rather than buried in a some schedule or exhibit, because we want it

to be completely plain that we don't like this a bit and are only making you this loan based on this really being
no more than you have told us to this point and if it is any worse than you have told us, God help you,

Ken, I appreciate your perspective as a financial person. I've discussed the situ in detail with none other than "Dr. No"
the senior regional credit officer for a multinational financial institution. I put these questions to him: 
Does the Bank perform Due Diligence when extending credit secured by inventory? "Of course!" was the answer. I
then asked "Would the bank look into allegations of fraud, misconduct, violations of law, and law suits resulting
therefrom as a part of the DD?" Answer - "Of course, we have a fiduciary responsibility to our depositors - not to
mention our Stockholders, the Federal Government and the public at large. Further, the 60 minutes piece is common
knowledge in the industry and the accusations in it have undoubtedly been soberly reviewed" Lastly, I asked "At any
time during the approval process - right up to the last minute - could and would a financial institution disapprove a
Credit?" Answer - "It happens at my level all the time. Credit review is the gate keeper. We protect the bank against
overly optimistic lending officers. Just because we enter into discussions about a loan doesn't obligate us to proceed
with funding. Many time we don't. We must be comfortable with the credit." There is "risk" and there is RISK. Believe
me - $100 million is the latter and as such gets many eyeballs before it's approved and ALL the top guys - CEO, CFO,
CCO - must sign off on it. This is NOT a 5 million dollar inventory RLC for a car dealer. I'm secure (having taken no
position financially) while Mr Tilson has undoubtedly tightened his sphincter at the news of the $100 million credit and
will attempt to discount it - unless he is just to narrowly focused to recognize he is in "check" - soon to be followed by
"and mate" Like all pawns, his ambition to become a Queen may blind him to the major move against his assertions
regarding LL. I think he's about to loose his head - instead (metaphorically speaking). I hope that you are not similarly

04 Jun 2015, 03:12 AM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi stumplifter,


Thanks for the lengthy response.


Of course a Bank will undergo due diligence. But this is a secured loan against tangible property and the
value of the inventory is the key.


You miss the point ... it doesn't reflect anything about the value of the stock ... it reflects about the value of the
inventory.


If the bank thought there was no risk .. they wouldn't secure it by the inventory. Tell me that the inventory is
only $100million and you have a point. If the inventory is $200million the point dries up.


You know none of the REAL FACTS. For instance... is the inventory $200million and did LL ask for
$200million and end up with only $100million?


There is very big difference between a bank giving an unsecured loan and an inventory secured loan. It, in
itself, is an indication of less than complete confidence.


So, I ask you again ... go ask your banker ... WOULD THEY HAVE LENT LL THE MONEY, SECURED BY
THE STOCK?


Therein lies your answer as to what they think of LL ... the rest is just fabrication.


04 Jun 2015, 06:31 AM


StumpLifter
Banks ALWAYS look at the Borrower FIRST and foremost when granting credit. The Security is secondary. If you are
who you say you are - you seem to have forgotten the first rule of lending. Further, security is always part of a credit -
even "unsecured" loans to private individuals contain an implied security clause of "all your possessions." This, you
should also know - if you are who you claim to be. I am completely baffled by your lack of understanding of what stock
is. To refresh - Stock is an obligation of the company to a stockholder - it is a LIABILITY not an asset to the company.
You posit that LL should secure a loan with it's stock - a liability? Ridiculous! If LL held say IBM stock (an asset) it
could pledge the IBM stock as security but NOT it's own. Your statements and questions are not those of someone
with 40 years of "finance services" experience. BTW - I AM a Banker and a Loan Officer and an accountant. I asked
the previously mentioned questions of a most senior Credit Officer because of the SIZE of the Loan. I didn't intend
this to get personal but your rant belies your claimed experience. At this point you appear to be just another low-
information person being lead down the path by Mr. Tilson.

Hi Stumplifter,


That's an awful lot of "figuring" for someone that has none of the facts.


All you know is that the bank lent $100million and secured it against inventory.


You don't know of any covenants that may accompany it, such as quick ratios, etc.. You also don't know how much
inventory is securing the loan, any forced repayments ... none of the terms. You are drawing conclusions based on
considerably less than full information.


Now, you may be happy drawing conclusions on less than full information .... that's your right.


But when you try to make an argument that it is proper to draw conclusions from less than all the information ... you
are subject to criticism.


So, I'll keep asking ... and you'll keep trying to dance around it .... if the bank was so sure about the value of LL's
stock (as you suggest) why didn't they lend $100million with the stock as security?


Until you can supply that answer, your proposition goes nowhere.


04 Jun 2015, 04:54 PM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi Stump,


No need for you to be "nippy" especially when it is you that are wrong-headed.


Everybody knows that no company can offer other peoples stock as security ... the company doesn't own other
people's assets. So it's not a matter of whether stock is a liability .. it isn't LL's property. DUH!


You insist that the loan is a reflection on the company... I insist it is a reflection of inventory that secures the loan.


The question I pose is hypothetical in nature ... as the loan already exists.


So, I ask again, stop dancing around, if the loan is a reflection of the value in the stock, do you think the bank would
take stock as security?


p.s. LL has Treasury Stock from it's recent buy-backs, so the question isn't impossible, but we both know that the
bank wouldn't secure the loan by anything other than tangible assets....


05 Jun 2015, 06:41 AM


asdf11234
Wait, can't the creditors say: They stock is 100% secured by the loan no matter the current stock price?


Ex. If LL stock was 20$, then 100M = secured by 5m shares. If it moved up to 25$, then shares reduced to
4m shares.


I would say that would make the loan more secure but we don't know any details so it might be secured
primary by inventory and then by stock?

Nevertheless, I would say the creditors probably just wanted to earn some loan fee considering their's so
many security measures that can be taken to protect the money.


05 Jun 2015, 09:18 AM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi asdf,


The point under consideration is whether or not the $100million loan, secured by inventory, is indicative of the
Banks faith in the company.


The banks faith in the company would be indicated by an UNSECURED loan, not a secured loan. A secured
loan indicates faith in the security --- in this case the inventory.


Now, of course any bank takes into consideration the ability to repay the loan, they don't want to liquidate the
inventory. But that doesn't translate into anything about the stock.


For instance, I could make an equally fact-less comment that LL having to borrow money indicates it is unable
to meet its needs out of cash flow. And that negatively reflects on LL. BUT, I wouldn't say that, because it
would require more facts than I have or care to uncover.


Now, one could infer that the bank has faith in the company if the collateral/loan ratio is close to 1:1. The
higher the ratio, the less one can infer.


So, since Stump says it reflects on faith...the burden is on him to supply details regarding any covenants and
the value of the inventory. Unless he does this, it is just a theoretical statement without factual basis.


05 Jun 2015, 11:02 AM


StumpLifter
Ken - you say - "Everybody knows that no company can offer other peoples stock as security ... the company doesn't
own other people's assets. So it's not a matter of whether stock is a liability .. it isn't LL's property. DUH!" 
Really? Perhaps you should take a look at the balance sheet of say - any one of the companies currently included in
the DJIA. Most hold stock in other companies and, like any asset, that stock can be pledged as security for a loan.
From your statement I see a brief explanation may be helpful. To get back to basics - Stock represents an ownership
share of a company - That's why they are called "shares". Companies often invest their excess cash in equities
(shares of stock in other companies). That stock - like cash - will appear as an Asset in the Company's Balance sheet.
The Company's own stock is listed as an obligation of the Company on the other side of the Balance sheet - The
Liabilities & Equity side. And if you will look at the balance sheet of a publicly traded company it will show the number
of shares outstanding. If you take The shares outstanding and divide it into "stockholders equity" you get the "book
value" of a single share of the Companies stock. (Most stocks trade above book value.) When it comes to securitizing
a loan the bank is only interested in what's listed in the Asset side of the balance sheet. That would be it's holdings
including - Cash, Accounts Receivable, Stocks of OTHER companies, and other liquid assets, Real Estate, Plant and
Equipment, Vehicles, Finished Inventory, Raw materials and other durable goods. You will never see a companies
own stock listed on the Asset side of the balance sheet. And therefore, it can't be used as collateral on a loan. Unless
you understand the basics of bank lending you will continue to struggle with why the $100 million dollar loan to LL by

BofA is so significantly positive for the company. (As an aside - When a company "BUY's back" it's own stock it
reduces the shares outstanding on the liability side of the balance sheet). Bottom line - The company does not own
it's own stock. Therefore, it can't be used as security against a loan. That is Accounting 101. ALL bank loans - even
personal loans - are securitized directly or indirectly. What you suggest - that the Bank securitize a loan to LL with LL
Stock is absurd. That's Banking 101. Of course having "...worked in the financial service industry for 40 years." You
know all this. So why all the confusion about the Structure of the $100 million BofA loan to LL and what it means?

Loans are made on Company Stock all the time - They are called 'Convertible Bonds'.


05 Jun 2015, 04:31 PM


StumpLifter
Ron - you are also on the wrong side of the Balance Sheet. Convertible Bonds are not assets they are
obligations of the issuing company. Just like a loan from a bank is an obligation. What the company gets in
exchange is Cash - which can be converted to other asset types like a building or a truck or wood flooring.
Stocks, Bonds, Loans, Convertible Bonds are all obligations of the company to pay a debt. Yes - a bank could
buy Stock in the Company or even Convertible Bonds - but that is not a loan it is an investment. WHOLE
different deal. And unless you think that the BofA plans to muscle into the flooring business by "winning" LL's
"formaldehyde drenched" flooring inventory, You'll realize that BofA has made a huge "bet" that LL is and will
remain a very big winner in the flooring business. Class over.

Hi stump,


You're dead wrong. Convertible bonds are complicated from an accounting standpoint but are bifurcated into
debt and equity. usually the major portion is debt.


Your statement that it is an investment is correct, but so is any loan or buying a bond or any debt instrument
... in the hands of the holder. But it is still debt in the hands of the issuer. There is distinction between equity
and debt when it comes to "investments". You're running it all together in a confused state.


Actually, stock, itself is an investment by the purchaser, but a liability of the company.


Strange you should do such a "turn-about" ..... you claimed to know this earlier.


p.s. If BoFa wanted to make an investment in LL, they would have bought stock. Lending money, secured by
inventory, gives them nothing more than interest payments.

That's Exactly what I said! ALE - Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Assets on the Left. Liabilities and Equity on the
Right. Assets can be used as Security for a Loan. Liabilities and Equity - NOT.

Hi Stump,


You completely miss everything ... please try again ...


Convertible bonds (or debentures) are not liabilities UNTIL THEY ARE ISSUED.


So, LL could issue a bond anytime someone is willing to take the risk ... then and only then does it become a
liability.


You're saying that they can't issue a bond because you can't issue a bond with the bond, itself, as collateral.
DUH!


So, if BoFA was "betting" on LL, they could have taken a convertible, they could have bought stock ... instead
they loaned money, secured by inventory --- one of the least desirable types of debts.

Hi Stumpf,


Well you're still dancing around the issue, only now, you're not even dancing to the beat.


I'll take it one by one...


1) Since when are we talking about the Bank and stocks in other companies? We are not talking about how a Bank
views other companies and their stock...but, rather how it views LL and their stock.


2) Here's your statement ...".....B of A just made a 100 million dollar RLC bet on the company.." They made no such
bet. They "bet" that the inventory, if liquidated is worth $100million.


3) You are correct that a bank, views the entire balance sheet when making a RLC. If they feel the balance sheet is
strong enough it is unsecured. If they have doubts, they secure it against a particular asset. Inventory securitization
usually is accompanied by covenants.


4) Inventory financing is generally the path a company takes after other avenues (such as receivable financing) are
turned down. It is seldom the first choice.


5) I'm not suggesting the bank secure anything with anything. I'm suggesting, very simply, that a $100million inventory
secured loan says nothing about the stock of a company and it is not a bet on the company. A bet on the company is
an unsecured loan


6) It is you that says the loan is a "bet" on the company ... it is you that have the burden of providing details, such as
the collateral/loan ratio and the covenants. I'm simply saying that IF A LOAN IS SECURED BY COMPANY STOCK

THEN AND ONLY THEN IS IT A BET ON A COMPANIES STOCK. And since that is not the case, you need to show
how an inventory loan is a bet on the company.


I continue to contend that a secured loan, is less of a bet on the borrower than an unsecured loan and more of a bet
on the collateral.


Dance as much as you want, but until you can disprove that ... your statement will continue to be a non-fact based
exaggeration of realty.

You think my use of the word "bet" was inappropriate when referring to a bank loan. Well, there is a
considerable amount of money involved $100 million and ALL LOANS have associated "Risk". Banks set
aside an "allowance for doubtful accounts" - a percentage of their outstanding loan portfolio in preparation for
those inevitable losses. So the Risk IS REAL. And ----- the biggest financial loss in world history ---- was the
result of bank originated mortgage loans that ultimately defaulted. If anything the term "Bet" might have been
a little euphemistic.

Hi Stump,


I don't think your use of "bet" was inappropriate re: a bank loan. 
It is inappropriate to stretch this "bet" to a "bet" on the COMPANY, rather than the inventory.


How many times do I have to say the same thing ... it is not a "bet" on the company it is a "bet" on the
inventory.


If the bank wanted to bet on the company they could have bought $100million in stock. They didn't, instead
they took interest payments and secured loans. It is proper to assume they took what they viewed as the
lower of two risk/reward profiles ... not the greater.


If the Bank was placing a "bet" on the Company they could have issued a debenture.


A secured loan is precisely NOT a bet on the company. Once again .... can you get it through your skull ... it is
a "bet" on the inventory.


Will you stop trying to dance around the issue and offer details and facts supporting your claim that it is a
"bet" on the company?


Do you have the collateral/loan ratio and the covenants that would indicate that the bank has extended the
$100million without full reliance on inventory to hedge the loan?


What, in particular, makes this a "bet" on the company?

LL up .66% to 21.37.

Hi Stump,


Up .66%is nice.


Helps to recapture some of the nearly 4% it's gone down since you deduced that the RLC was a "bet" on the
company.

So YOU think that BofA places a high value on LL inventory? About 91,000 troy OZ of Gold? Wow! That is
impressive! Must be very good stuff, Huh!? Well, I'm glad we agree on that! LL has very high quality merchandise.
That's what I've been saying. Thanks for confirming it. Check, and mate.

Hardly, out of nowhere you bring out "tons of Gold" and say "check mate".


I don't see any posts where anyone mentions gold.

My Brother-in-law (I affectionately refer to him as the "Ultimate Cheap B*st*rd") didn't buy the LL flooring. He bought
his flooring from Lowes and when I visit his cabin he makes me put my tiny little dog outside because he's afraid the
dog will spill water on his "wood" flooring while drinking from his bowl and make the flooring swell up. (He ain't but a
little bitty dog. Couldn't spill much even if he did). He (my bro-in-law not my dog) often reflects on how he wishes he
bought a better grade of flooring. Weeeeeeellllll, I guess you get what ya pay fer. Me - I buy Bellawood from Lumber
Liquidators - Noooo problemooo.
