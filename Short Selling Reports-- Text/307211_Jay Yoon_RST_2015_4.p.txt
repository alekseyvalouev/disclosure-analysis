Rosetta	Stone	Update:	Poor	Q4	Results,	Even	Worse	Guidance
Mar.	18,	2015	9:41	AM	ET3	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


Rosetta	Stone	reported	poor	Q4	2014	results	which	were	below	consensus	analyst
estimates	from	both	a	revenue	and	earnings	perspective.


In	addition	to	poor	Q4	results,	management	provided	disappointing	Q1	2015	and	FY
2015	guidance.


Particularly	troubling	for	the	Company	is	the	slowdown	in	the	E&E	business	in	Q4
2014,	as	well	as	the	projected	decline	in	Q1	2015	E&E	bookings.


Overall,	the	Q4	results	confirm	my	thesis	that	the	Companyâ€™s	conversion	to	multi-
year	contracts	was	artificially	inflating	EBITDA	results	and	masking	continued
deteriorations	in	the	business.


Despite	the	large	decline	in	share	price,	I	remain	short	Rosetta	Stone	shares.


Rosetta	Stone	(NYSE:RST)	released	its	Q4	2014	earnings	report	after	market	close	on
March	11th.	The	Company's	results	were	disappointing	as	Q4	revenue	of	$79.3mm	(2%	y-
o-y	growth)	was	$2mm	below	consensus	estimates,	while	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$12.7mm
was	~$6mm	-	$10mm	lower	than	management	guidance	($18.5mm	-	$22.5mm).	Q4	EPS
of	-$1.01	was	also	below	expectations	as	analysts	were	projecting	Q4	EPS	of	-$0.13.	In
addition	to	reporting	poor	Q4	results,	the	Company	provided	very	weak	Q1	2015	and	full
year	FY	2015	guidance.	For	FY	2015,	RST	management	guided	for	total	E&E	bookings	of
$122mm	-	$130mm	(8%	-	15%	growth)	and	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$8mm	-	$12mm.	This
was	well	below	analyst	expectations.	For	example,	prior	to	the	Q4	2014	earnings	report,
Baird	Research	was	projecting	FY	2015	E&E	bookings	of	$135.1mm	and	Adjusted
EBITDA	of	$22.8mm.	The	Company's	Q1	2015	guidance	was	even	more	disappointing
than	the	full	year	guidance.	In	Q1,	management	expects	the	Company	to	report	$17mm	of
E&E	bookings	which	represents	a	7%	y-o-y	decline.	Furthermore,	the	Company	is
projecting	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	-$10mm	in	Q1	2015	which	represents	an	over	$3mm
decline	versus	Q1	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	-$6.7mm.	Due	to	the	poor	Q4	2014	results
and	disappointing	guidance,	RST	shares	declined	by	over	16%	the	day	after	earnings
from	$9.50	as	of	March	11th	to	$7.96	as	of	March	12th.

For	RST	longs,	the	most	troubling	aspect	regarding	the	Company's	recent	earnings	report
was	the	significant	slowdown	in	E&E	bookings.	In	Q4	2014,	organic	E&E	bookings
increased	just	2%	y-o-y	compared	to	10%	y-o-y	organic	growth	in	Q3	2014.	The	slowdown
in	E&E	bookings	is	projected	to	accelerate	in	Q1	2015	as	management	is	projecting	total
E&E	bookings	to	actually	decline	by	7%	y-o-y.	Based	on	the	weak	Q1	2015	guidance,	I
believe	it	is	likely	that	the	Company	will	fail	to	achieve	their	full	year	E&E	bookings	growth
target	of	8%	-	15%.	The	deterioration	in	the	E&E	business	is	very	concerning	for	long
investors.	For	the	past	year	or	so,	large	investors	in	RST	such	as	Osmium	Partners	and
Nierenberg	Investment	Management	have	argued	that	most	of	the	Company's	value	was
in	the	"high	growth"	E&E	business.	Both	of	these	firms	believe	that	the	E&E	business
deserves	a	valuation	multiple	of	at	least	3x	price	to	sales.	On	the	other	hand,	due	to
inconsistent	historical	growth	and	increasing	competitive	pressures,	I	believe	that	the	E&E
business	should	be	valued	at	1x	price	to	sales	at	most.	Based	on	the	recent	deterioration
in	E&E	bookings	growth,	I	would	argue	that	my	views	are	more	in-line	with	reality	than
Osmium	or	Nierenberg.	Thus,	at	this	point,	the	bull	case	appears	very	weak	as	most	longs
were	counting	on	strong	growth	in	the	E&E	business	to	be	the	primary	driver	of	future
share	price	appreciation.


The	significant	deterioration	in	RST's	E&E	bookings	performance	is	not	surprising.	In	my
first	article	on	RST,	I	argued	that	the	RST's	FY	2014	Adjusted	EBITDA	and	E&E	bookings
performance	were	artificially	boosted	by	the	Company's	conversion	from	single-year	to
multi-year	contracts.	As	I	subsequently	demonstrated	in	one	of	my	follow-up	articles,	after
annualizing	the	value	of	multi-year	contracts,	RST's	E&E	bookings	in	the	first	9	months	of
FY	2014	had	actually	declined	relative	to	the	prior	year.	After	most	of	single-year	contracts
had	been	converted	to	multi-year	contracts,	I	believed	that	E&E	bookings	growth	would
begin	to	slow	down	dramatically.	This	is	exactly	what	occurred	in	Q4	2014,	and	it	appears
that	the	weakness	in	E&E	bookings	growth	will	continue	throughout	FY	2015.


Conclusion


Frankly,	the	Company's	Q4	2014	results	and	FY	2015	guidance	fell	below	my	already	low
expectations.	I	expected	RST's	results	to	deteriorate	as	the	conversion	to	multi-year
contracts	slowed	down.	However,	I	did	not	anticipate	that	the	Company's	results	would
deteriorate	so	soon.	Overall,	RST's	recent	Q4	2014	earnings	report	has	confirmed	most	of
the	key	points	of	my	bear	thesis.	I	do	not	believe	that	the	Company's	recent	restructuring
initiatives	will	create	much	value	for	shareholders.	The	fundamental	problem	with	RST	is
that	they	offer	a	product	that	is	in	many	ways	inferior	to	much	cheaper	products	offered	by
upstarts	such	as	Duolingo.	No	amount	of	cost-cutting	and	refocused	sales	&	marketing
efforts	can	make-up	for	an	increasingly	commoditized	product.	I	believe	that	RST	will

continue	to	lose	market	share,	and	as	a	result,	I	believe	RST	shares	will	continue	to
decline	from	the	current	price	level.	To	take	into	account	the	Company's	weaker	than
anticipated	FY	2015	guidance,	I	have	applied	a	15%	discount	to	my	previous	price	target
of	$6.23	which	results	in	a	new	price	target	of	$5.30	for	RST	shares.	Thus,	despite	the
recent	large	decline	in	the	Company's	share	price,	I	believe	that	RST	still	represents	a
good	short	opportunity	at	the	current	price	level.

Help	me	understand	your	assertions.	You	state	that	you	believe	the	E&E	business	is	worth	1x	Revenues.	That	comes
to	about	$90M.	Add	$64M	in	cash	and	you	have	$7.00/share.	The	Consumer	business	is	essentially	free.	What	am	I
missing	here?
