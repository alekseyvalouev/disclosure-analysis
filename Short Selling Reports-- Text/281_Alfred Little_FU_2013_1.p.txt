FAB Universal: The Face of Piracy In China
Nov. 14, 2013 1:56 PM ET104 comments
by: Alfred Little


FAB Universal Corp. (NYSEMKT:FU) claims to be a global leader in the distribution of
copyright-protected digital media. FAB derives substantially all of its revenue and profit
from its Chinese subsidiary, which, according to its FY2012 10-K filed on 3/18/13:


"… is engaged in marketing and distributing various officially licensed digital
entertainment products under the 'FAB' brand throughout the PRC…"


At the core of FAB's Chinese business are its "Intelligent Media Kiosks" allowing
consumers to download copyright-protected movies and music to their portable storage
devices. FAB claimed to have 3,954 such "intelligent" kiosks in Beijing alone, according to
its 6/1/12 proxy (DEF 14A, filed with the SEC on 6/15/12), with over 16,820 active kiosks
deployed in 40 Chinese cities according to FAB's 11/13/13 press release announcing 2013
Q3 financial results.


In today's report I will show that:


1. Contrary to FAB's anti-piracy claims, FAB's "Intelligent Media Kiosks" are in reality
loaded with very obviously pirated U.S. movies.


2. FAB's kiosk manufacturers acknowledged that: a) They historically supplied around
1,600-1,700 kiosks to FAB, only 10% of the 16,820 units FAB claims to have deployed;
b) One kiosk supplier helped FAB stage phony manufacturer site visits for FAB's
investors, reminiscent of the China Integrated Energy (OTC:CBEH) fraud I exposed in
2011.


3. FAB's director of franchisee sales acknowledged that: a) FAB has only around 1000
kiosks in Beijing (compared to 3,954 disclosed in the 6/1/12 proxy); and b) FAB
promises kiosk franchisees guaranteed minimum returns on their investments and
offers to buy back the franchised kiosks using FAB U.S. listed common stock.


Based on the interviews and evidence that I collected, I conclude that FAB's business in
China is a tiny fraction of what it claims in its SEC filings. FAB's actual profitability would
be reduced even further if the company upgraded its pirated content to properly licensed
content (assuming that is even possible). Finally, FAB has potentially enormous
undisclosed liabilities for guaranteeing minimum investment returns to franchisees and
undisclosed potential dilution from common stock issuable to franchisees.

Background - "Best Buy meets iTunes meets Redbox"


FAB (formerly Wizzard Software - WZE) was formed out of a reverse merger with a twist:
Wizzard's Pittsburg management, led by CEO Chris Spencer and CFO John Busshaus,
claimed to have actually paid professionals to vet the Chinese acquisition target prior to
the merger:


"Legal due diligence was performed by King & Wood [a prominent Chinese law firm
with its head office in Beijing] and accounting and tax due diligence was performed
by a 'big four' accounting and consulting firm."


On Page 22 of the 6/1/12 proxy FAB disclosed that the "big four" accounting due diligence
service provider was none other than Ernst & Young. While the use of E&Y certainly may
have assured investors, in my opinion E&Y has a very poor track record preventing fraud
in China. Consider the case of SinoTech Energy, a former NASDAQ listed company
audited by E&Y and charged with fraud by the SEC following my 2011 whistleblower
report.


Nevertheless, attracted to the too-good-to-be-true acquisition, Wizzard shareholders
overwhelmingly approved a 1-for-12 reverse split and a series of highly dilutive share
issuances (spanning two years), to ultimately give the shareholders of FAB's Chinese
acquisition 78% of the combined company, provided that certain revenue, income, and
corporate governance objectives are achieved.


On 4/12/12, Wizzard announced the definitive Share Exchange Agreement with FAB.
CEO Chris Spencer exulted that the newly merged FAB is "Best Buy meets iTunes meets
Redbox." Spencer and FAB's Chinese Chairman Hongcheng Zhang appear below
banging a gong celebrating the NYSE listing of FAB:

"The Face of Copyright Protection in China"


FAB's SEC filings, press releases, and investor presentations are littered with copyright-
protection claims such as the following (found on Pages 28 and 29 of FAB's 3/18/13
FY2012 10-K filing):


"We believe our business of selling and distributing copyright protected media and
content in China will continue to grow and generate profits due to the brand
recognition of FAB in China as well as the continued support of the government for
copyright protection in China."


"The FAB Intelligent Media Kiosks have greatly enhanced consumer ease-of-
purchase while reducing the appeal of pirated content, positively transforming
market dynamics in China for legitimate content and facilitating licensing
opportunities with traditional media publishers who desire safe access to the world's
largest, fastest-growing consumer market."


On 7/24/12, FAB Chairman Zhang Hongcheng strongly asserted FAB's copyright
achievements, emphasizing that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 4/51


"'Insisting on the protection of copyrights and resisting piracy is the core belief to
which FAB always adheres,' said Mr. Zhang Hongcheng, Founder and Chairman of
FAB. 'Making the FAB Intelligent Media Kiosks a copyright content distribution
platform and providing users with easy access to high-quality digital content is the
top business priority of FAB.' FAB has a large library of copyrighted digital content
including digital movies, TV shows, video, ebooks, games, music and strategic
relationships with more than a hundred digital content providers across Asia."


On FAB's Q2 2013 conference call on 8/14/13, CEO Chris Spencer exalted that Zhang
(age 43) is the "face of copyright protection in China":


"Mr. Zhang, the Chairman of our Board here is the head of the anti-piracy copyright
protection organizations within China for the last 20 years [since Zhang was 23?].
He, you could argue, is the face of copyright protection in China. He has definitely
been a main driver for the last 20 years about this and we've done a good job."


According to FAB, Zhang was the founding chairman of the "Anti-Piracy Alliance" of
China. Zhang is shown below (with suit and tie) at the Anti-Piracy Alliance's launch
ceremony held on 7/15/10:


FAB's commitment to anti-piracy attracted the legendary investor Jim Rogers to recently
join FAB's board and take a small stake in the company. Rogers told Barron's that he was
motivated by the Chinese government's stricter enforcement of intellectual property laws.
Rogers and Zhang are shown below, after signing the directorship agreement:

While I personally greatly admire Jim Rogers, I have to seriously question his due
diligence on FAB. Anyone who takes the time to actually download movies from FAB's
kiosks in Beijing will immediately realize that FAB's anti-piracy claims are a total and
complete fraud.


I. FAB's "Intelligent Media Kiosks" - The Face of Piracy in China


I recently sent my investigators to download movies from FAB's kiosks at its two Beijing
"entertainment superstores." Unfortunately, they found that FAB's 30,000 square foot
"Xidan Joy City" store in West Beijing was shut down for "remodeling" as shown in the
following photo taken on 10/13/13:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 6/51


Next my investigators visited FAB's 20,000 square foot "SoShow" store in East Beijing, at
Chongwen Men, in the basement of the aging SoShow shopping mall (pictured below).
Fortunately, FAB's SoShow store was open for business.


My investigators' first step was to purchase two 50 RMB ($8.20) FAB membership cards
from SoShow store employees who explained that movies cost 1, 2, or 3 RMB ($0.16,
$0.33, $0.49) to download. Many movies are actually free to download. The average price
of a recently released U.S. movie was only 0.8 RMB, or about 13 U.S. cents! Out of 260
movies on each kiosk, around 35 were recent U.S. releases.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 7/51


The SoShow staff explained that the membership cards would not be immediately
activated due to a "virus" infecting FAB's system. The staff then offered to help the
investigators download from a kiosk, free of charge, the Hollywood new release Olympus
Has Fallen.


However, downloading the movie file proved to be a significant challenge for the SoShow
staff. After multiple failed attempts to download Olympus Has Fallen from three different
kiosks, the staff finally succeeded (using the store's own USB flash drive) and then
transferred the file to my investigator's laptop.


The glitchy kiosks are one problem, but the fact that the movie could be so easily copied
more than once (from the kiosk to a flash drive to a laptop) indicates that the movie files
contain no Digital Rights Management copyright protection mechanism. FAB movie files
can be copied and played on multiple devices, as many times as the customer wants.


The following are screen stills from my investigator's recording of Olympus Has Fallen
being downloaded from the SoShow kiosk and then being played on his MacBook inside
the SoShow store:

The red circle highlights the Chinese subtitles, which are embedded on the film. This is the
first sign that the movie is pirated; according to my conversations and emails with an
investigator from the Motion Picture Association of America ("MPAA"). Several of FAB's
pirated movies even contained advertisements for the pirated source of the subtitles, such
as "FISH321@18P2P."

A second, and very obvious, proof that the FAB's Olympus Has Fallen is pirated can be
found by inspecting the file metadata shown below:


Filename: FAB5C_白宫陷落.rmvb [Olympus Has Fallen]


File size: 674.2 MB


File creation date: July 4, 2013


File type: RealPlayer Media (RMVB)


The piracy is evident from the file creation date of 7/4/2013. According to IMDB.com
Olympus Has Fallen was not released on DVD until 8/13/2013. Apple's iTunes was able to
sell an electronic DRM-protected version a week earlier. How could FAB possibly have a
legal version in China more than a month before iTunes in the U.S.?


The final proof that this movie is pirated is the quality of the video itself. I uploaded a short
clip from FAB's pirated version of Olympus Has Fallen that can be viewed by clicking here.


After reviewing this initial evidence, I sent my investigators back to the SoShow store to
download and collect more of the pirated movies as evidence to share with securities
regulators and the MPAA. The FAB kiosks continued to repeatedly suffer technical glitches
downloading files onto USB flash drives, but eventually my investigators were able to
download a total of 5 movies over the course of two hours. Excluding the kiosks' technical
problems, each movie took between 3 to 5 minutes to download via USB, depending on
the size of each file, and indicating a very slow transfer rate of only around 3MB per
second.


The following are screen stills from my investigator's recording of Iron Man 3 being
downloaded from the SoShow kiosk and then being played on his MacBook inside the
SoShow store:

Here is the Iron Man 3 movie file metadata:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 13/51


Filename: FAB5C_钢铁侠3.rmvb [Iron Man 3]


File size: 1.05 GB


File creation date: May 15, 2013


File type: RealPlayer Media (RMVB)


Once again, the piracy is evident from the file creation date of 5/15/13. According to
IMDB.com, the DVD release date of Iron Man 3 was not until 9/24/13. A special DRM-
protected HD digital download was available earlier on iTunes, on 9/3/13. Once again,
how could FAB have an electronic copy available in China months prior to iTunes?


The quality of FAB's pirated Iron Man 3 movie file is even worse than Olympus Has Fallen.
Whoever pirated Iron Man 3, mistakenly changed the aspect ratio from its original wide-
screen format (likely filmed by a camera in a theater) to 1080x720, which had the
unsightly effect of making all the images taller and narrower as can be seen in the follow
two images.

It is evident from the table that FAB added nearly every U.S. movie to the kiosks prior to
the official DVD release date. In many cases FAB's pirated movies were available months
prior to the respective official DVD release dates. FAB's average selling price per movie is
only 80 Chinese cents or 13 U.S. pennies!


My investigators recorded interviews surveying multiple FAB kiosk operators both at FAB's
flagship SoShow store and other Beijing locations. Below is a summary of their findings:


1. All staff interviewed insisted that all movies on the kiosks were copyrighted, despite the
very obvious evidence to the contrary.


2. Staff acknowledged that the kiosks' USB connections are "glitchy" and refuse to read
many devices, while inconsistently reading other devices.


3. Kiosk content used to be updated each week, but now are updated less frequently.
Additional pirated movie content was being sold from a PC in each store and was
repeatedly offered to my investigators when the kiosks were slow to function.


4. The retail stores routinely give away free kiosk membership cards with each 50 to 100
RMB retail merchandise purchase in the store.


5. One operator claimed that most kiosk customers obtained membership cards for free
with merchandise purchases.


6. Another operator claimed that most kiosk customers either downloaded free movies or
used free membership cards to download movies.


7. Operators cited having between 10 kiosk customers per week to as little as 10 kiosk
customers per month.


8. Operators believed there were definitely more than 100 kiosks in Beijing, but were not
sure whether there were more than 500 kiosks in Beijing.


9. Operators believed that FAB's kiosks were deployed in 30 to as many as 200 possible
locations in Beijing.

In addition to offering pirated movies on its kiosks, FAB also offers pirated movie
exhibitions and private screenings to the Chinese public at its Joy City "Private Movie
Club" as discussed below.


Xidan Joy City "Private (Read: Pirated) Movie Club"


Not only does FAB let Chinese consumers download pirated Hollywood movies from their
kiosks for pennies, FAB also publicly screens pirated Hollywood movies in one of the
biggest shopping malls in Beijing. FAB's Xidan Joy City store includes a "Private Movie
Club" with 20-30 private soundproof movie-screening rooms that are available 24 hours a
day with refreshments and optional "VIP services."


Ironically, FAB's "Private Movie Club" (on the 9th floor of the Joy City Mall) is located right
underneath a legitimate Chinese multiplex movie theater chain (on the 10th floor) in the
very same shopping mall.


My investigators interviewed the staff of the legitimate "Capital Cinema" upstairs from
FAB. The staff immediately explained that all of FAB's movies shown in its Private Movie
Club were pirated from the Internet. The staff explained that legitimate movies shown in
theaters always have the following State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television
("SARFT") seal of approval at the start:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 18/51


I therefore sent my investigators to interview the Joy City "Private Movie Club" staff and to
record pirated movies being played in the screening rooms. From these interviews, I
learned the following:


1. FAB attracts customers to its private screening rooms (shown below) by emphasizing
the privacy, a 500+ database of "theater-quality" movies, and free refreshments for
prepaid members.


2. The staff actually bragged that FAB's private screening room had shown Now You See
Me two days prior to its 10/10/13 official release in China. The staff then played a
portion of a pirated copy of the movie stored on FAB's network. A screen shot from my
investigator's recording appears below:

3. Despite the obvious piracy, the staff of the Private Movie Club nevertheless insisted
that all of the movie content was properly licensed and not pirated.


Interview of FAB CEO Chris Spencer


On Monday, 11/11/13, I questioned FAB's CEO, Chris Spencer, regarding piracy, DRM,
and FAB's average selling prices for U.S. movies. The key points of our conversation
were:


1. Chris adamantly affirmed that FAB's entire kiosk content was properly licensed and
copyright protected.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 20/51


2. Chris acknowledged that in the extremely unlikely event that there were pirated movie
files on the kiosks, that FAB would detect them and immediately remove them;
because


3. FAB "continuously" and "frequently" checks the kiosks for pirated content. However,
Chris was uncertain exactly how frequently FAB staff reviews kiosk content for piracy.


4. Chris did not dispute the $0.13 average selling price of recently released U.S. movies.
He explained that FAB has not really focused on generating revenue from movie
downloads.


5. Chris acknowledged that the kiosk movie files contained no DRM. Chris explained that
DRM was incompatible with many devices and that FAB was researching anti-piracy
protection methods to possibly implement in the future.


At the beginning of our conversation, Chris explained that FAB management was divided
over whether he should talk to me. However, Chris explained that he had taken the time to
review my track record on Alfredlittle.com and he complimented the good work that I have
done exposing bad companies. Chris hoped that I would only publish the truth. I assured
him that is always the case.


Regarding the piracy issue, the truth is clear. FAB's kiosk content is pirated and this fact
requires its U.S. management to take immediate action. Furthermore, FAB will have to
reconsider its entire kiosk business plan in light of the piracy. Common sense says that
properly licensed content requires much more than 13 cents per movie in revenue to turn
a profit.


II. FAB's Kiosk Manufacturers Acknowledge Only 1,600-1,700 Units Sold to FAB


FAB claimed to have 3,954 "intelligent" kiosks in Beijing alone, according to its 6/1/12
proxy, with over 16,820 kiosks in 40 Chinese cities according to FAB's 11/13/13 press
release announcing 2013 Q3 results.


Historically, the two main manufacturers of FAB's kiosks were Beijing Riyao Technology
Co. Ltd. (北京日尧科技有限公司采访) and Beijing Chongfeng Touch and Control
Technology Co. Ltd. (崇峰触控(北京)科技有限公司), according to my investigators'
interview of a former FAB manager.


My investigators visited Riyao and Chongfeng to interview the management and learned
the following:


A). According to Riyao management:
5/18/2018 FAB Universal: The Face of Piracy In China - FAB Universal Corp. (NYSEMKT:FU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 21/51


1. Riyao did business with FAB from 2008 until 2012. Riyao sold less than 500 kiosks to
FAB.


2. Riyao more than once helped FAB stage manufacturing site visits for investors. At
FAB's request, Riyao would post signage pretending to be "Xing Wang Xun Tong."
Riyao's manager showed my investigators pictures of the fabricated "Xing Wang Xun
Tong" signage.


3. Riyao stopped supplying kiosks to FAB in 2012 because FAB was consistently late to
pay.


4. FAB at one point was one and a half years delinquent paying Riyao 1 million RMB.
5. FAB has difficulty contracting manufacturers for its kiosks because of FAB's bad


reputation (being late to pay suppliers).
6. FAB's main purpose was not to "run a real business" but rather to use the kiosk


concept to go public to "cheat money."


Riyao's staging of investor visits to a fabricated manufacturing facility using the name
"Xing Wang Xun Tong" raises some very serious concerns. Did FAB use a phony "Xing
Wang" entity to deceive E&Y, King & Wood, its auditor (Friedman), U.S. officers, and
directors regarding kiosk production?


FAB's fabricated "Xing Wang" factory tours remind me of China Integrated Energy, a
Chinese company delisted from NASDAQ after I busted the management staging phony
biodiesel production activity for Rodman & Renshaw investors in 2011. ABC News
interviewed me here regarding my investigation.


B). According to Chongfeng management:


1. Chongfeng has done doing business with FAB since 2007-2008.
2. Chongfeng sold around 1,000 kiosks to FAB. FAB provided the software.
3. The poor performance of the kiosks observed by my investigators (insensitive touch


screen and glitchy USB drive reader) was due to the low-end hardware chosen by
FAB.


4. Chongfeng is uncertain whether the kiosks can generate a profit. However, Chongfeng
pointed out that FAB was certainly successful raising money from investors attracted to
the kiosk concept and pointed out that FAB's business model is "just about raising
money."


5. Regarding DRM protection of media files, Chongfeng explained: "That part [of the
kiosks] was not done by us. Jingcai [FAB] has no licensed content. You don't know
that? The CD/DVDs they were selling are copyright protected. The ones in their kiosks
for download are not licensed or copyright protected."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 22/51


6. Chongfeng then went on to explain: "There were two reasons FAB's kiosks were not
widely deployed. One was the media content being pirated, second was they haven't
found a correct model to make money."


Below are some snapshots from my investigators' interviews of FAB's two main historical
kiosk suppliers:

During my 11/11/13 interview of FAB CEO Chris Spencer, he mentioned two more kiosk
manufacturers contracted by FAB: Beijing Fulei (北京富雷实业有限公司) and Nanjing
Pinjia (南京品佳科技开发有限公司).


My investigators followed up by contacting both companies by phone on 11/14/13 and
learned the following:


1. Nanjing Pinjia has historically produced 100-200 kiosks for FAB, according to the
Market Department Manager Zhou Chunguo (phone number: 15305181668).


2. Beijing Fulei only produces lottery kiosks and sold some lottery kiosks to FAB,
according to a manager named Mr. Zhou in the laminator equipment department. The
lottery kiosks department manager, Mr. Chen (phone number: 13701108558) was not
available.


Based on my investigators' interviews of all four of FAB's kiosk suppliers, in total they have
historically supplied 1600-1700 kiosks to FAB, only 10% of the 16,820 kiosks FAB claims
to have currently in active service (and not including replacement or upgraded units

deployed by FAB).


I believe that at the very least FAB should respond by publishing a complete list of all the
physical addresses of the nearly 4,000 kiosks FAB claimed to have deployed in Beijing so
that investors can verify that they truly exist. Based on my thorough on the ground due
diligence I strongly believe that they do not.


III. FAB's Director of Franchisee Sales Acknowledged Only 1000 Kiosks in Beijing
and Promises Franchisees Minimum Guaranteed Returns Plus Free-Trading FU
Stock at a 20% Discount to Market


After thoroughly analyzing FAB's pirated movie kiosk business model, my investigators
turned to FAB itself and approached FAB's director of franchisee sales to learn how the
franchise business works. FAB's director of franchisee sales told my investigator:


1. There are currently only about 1,000 FAB kiosks deployed in Beijing market (including
all kiosk models, old and new.)


2. FAB has stopped distributing the previous versions of its kiosks (including the kiosks in
its flagship store) and has started selling a new type of kiosk to franchisees for 80,000
RMB.


3. Since October 2012, FAB has signed up "several hundred" franchisees for these new
kiosks.


4. After signing an operating agreement with the franchisee, FAB's staff selects a location
to deploy the kiosk.


5. FAB's staff then installs, operates, and maintains all franchisees' kiosks, including
uploading and updating all the content.


6. Each franchisee has the right to know the location where FAB deployed their kiosk and
the right to know the P&L performance of the kiosk.


7. The sales director very clearly pitched that the biggest payoff for the franchisees
comes after 2 years when FAB, the "public company," will buy out the franchisees'
kiosks for a multiple (from 1.5-5x) of their net asset value (defined as the accumulated
profits over the 2 years plus a guaranteed minimum asset value).


8. The sales director said that FAB "guarantees" a lowest payoff scenario of a minimum
90,000 RMB to the franchisees, who bear no risk of losing money at all.


9. In the best-case buyout scenario, FAB will buy each kiosk for as much as 500,000
RMB.


10. To complete the buyout, FAB will offer franchisees cash or common stock valued at
20% discount to the market price.
5/18/2018 FAB Universal: The Face of Piracy In China - FAB Universal Corp. (NYSEMKT:FU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 27/51


The director of franchisee sales presented my investigator with this franchisee sales
brochure that included a basic term sheet that makes the following points:


1. Franchisee shall invest 80,000 RMB per kiosk.
2. Franchisee promises to achieve 20,000 RMB and 40,000 RMB profit targets in the first


and second years, respectively.
3. FAB and the franchisee share any profit above these profit targets.
4. FAB promises to buy back the kiosks at 1.5 to 5 times the accumulated profits over the


first 2 years plus a guaranteed minimum asset value.
5. In the base case where the kiosk achieves the minimum profit target, FAB would buy it


back for 200,000 - 500,000 RMB, using either cash or "free-trading" shares in "FU"
6. In the event that profit targets are not met, FAB agrees to buy back each kiosk for 1.5


to 2 times the guaranteed minimum asset value of 60,000 RMB.
7. Using the lower multiple: 1.5 x 60,000 RMB = 90,000 RMB guaranteed minimum return


of the 80,000 original investment per kiosk.


From an accounting standpoint, these buyback and minimum guaranteed investment
return conditions offered in the franchisee term sheet call into question FAB's kiosk
licensing revenue recognition policy, which records kiosk licensing revenue as deferred
revenue to be realized over 5 years.


If FAB is indeed promising franchisees a minimum guaranteed return on investment, the
sales of franchising licenses are really just a form of financing. The possibility that FAB will
repay the franchisee/investor with common stock makes the franchisee "investment" a
sort of convertible debt, secured by the kiosk. Obviously, FAB appears to be using its
common stock to stimulate franchisee kiosk investments to finance the growth of its kiosk
business. How should FAB account for guarantees made to the franchisee investors as
well as the potential future dilutive share issuances?


Assuming that FAB has made these promises to most or all of its franchisees, FAB has
potentially enormous undisclosed liabilities for guaranteeing minimum investment returns
to franchisees and undisclosed potential dilution from common stock issuable to its
franchisees.


Below are sample snapshots from my investigator's first recorded interview of FAB's
director of franchisee sales:

Conclusion


Based on the interviews and evidence that I collected, I conclude that FAB's business in
China is a tiny fraction of what it claims in its SEC filings. FAB's actual profitability would
be reduced even further if the company upgraded its pirated content to properly licensed
content (assuming that is even possible). Finally, FAB has potentially enormous
undisclosed liabilities for guaranteeing minimum investment returns to franchisees and
undisclosed potential dilution from common stock issuable to franchisees.

Perhaps FAB's U.S. management and auditor were duped by FAB Chairman Hongcheng
Zhang. If so, CEO Chris Spencer and CFO John Busshaus now need to take immediate
steps to protect investors. Lock down any cash and prevent FAB's Chairman and his
associates from selling their shares. Commence an immediate independent investigation.
Authorize FAB's auditor to meet with me.


As I have done in the past, I will provide copies of all of my evidence and recorded
interviews to the NYSE, SEC, as well as to any truly independent investigator appointed
by FAB's independent directors.

You cannot group / lump all short sellers who expose fraud, in one basket. MW has diff tactics, standards.
MW's track record isn't all that either.


As for being sued, one can sue a person for the wrong colored shirt (although you will win the motion for sum
J, and maybe the judge fines you for wasting court time). The point is, # of times sued is not relevant when
you're dealing with companies that want to shut you down for your investigations. It's like being mass arrested
while standing at a corner watching a protest. It really means nothing.

I agree it's not a pretty sight if there is indeed pirated movies on the kiosks. But think about about it from a
business sense... How does a legit ethical company like FU help support promoting intellectual ownership in
China and still make a profit during the transition? Do it like FU is doing it. Make the kiosks independently
owned (not by FU) during the transition period. The shorts may not legitimately be reporting on the piracy
issue (time will tell), but even if they are, they are not putting FU in the correct light, or so it seems to me. I
think these kiosks are independently owned. So how is FU guilty of fraud? Right?

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  First of all you are ignoring the $16.4M in undisclosed bonds, the interviews of the kiosk
manufacturers indicating that FAB has perhaps exaggerated its kiosk count by 10x, and the fact that FAB
promises franchisees minimum guaranteed returns and stock in FU.


As for piracy, the franchisees depend on FAB to maintain the content on the kiosks. Piracy is thus FAB's
problem, not the franchisees.

Timing is not that important. Had he released the report BEFORE earnings, during a quiet period, you'd have
the same complaint.


The fact he contacted mgt (if true), would mean they did have a chance to respond. And either chose not to or
went into full fledged oh crap panic mode. Probably the latter.

Shockingly, this "researcher" doesn't know (or chooses not to disclose) that DVD release dates in China may be
different than in the U.S. because studios have to compete with pirates. http://bit.ly/1d0tpn2


The author also makes a big deal about how cheap the downloads are. But the pricing needs to be put in context --
Hollywood studios have sold LEGAL DVDs in China for as little as $2-$3 (above link) Illegal DVDs are little over $1.
So 20-30 cents for a download is not impossibly low, but at the same time leaves room for price increases. Studios
would certainly have to charge FU much less than they charge Netflix in the US. Also, FU is signing ad agreements
and looking at other services which will help them derive more $ from the kiosks.


15 Nov 2013, 12:26 AM

I don't think you read the entire article.  
The movies have embedded subtitles by pirate groups, they begin showing them before the DVD version is
even mastered by the studio (which means they are camrips and R5 lines from cinemas)


They also change the aspect ratios of the movies to avoid algorithmic detection.


There is nothing to discuss here really. There is no business model. It's a company that orders equipment
which it doesn't pay it's contractors for, and then shows pirated content downloaded from the internet on
these practically-stolen devices.


Also, they don't even have paying customers. They interviewed the local franchisees who said they give away
most membership cards for free. Some franchisees said the amount of customers per month can be counted
in the dozens. You can count how much revenue that's going to generate at $0.12 per film.


They don't even have their own physical stores, they sell the kiosks they never paid for in the first place, to
unsuspecting franchisees for a high price, who then place it in malls and shops at their own expense.


Scam.

I read entire article. The movies had subtitles as most foreign movies do in China. How can you separate
subtitles by pirate groups or by a legal sources? I don't think you know the answer. It's the imagination of this
author and you! The releasing date of movies into China is non-issue as the most US studios have contract
with China to release the movies two months after theater debut in US for fight against piracy. In US, it's 3
months or even longer!!!! All of the movies listed in this article satisfied 2 months rule. If they are pirate
version, why did they have to wait for two months. As for the format, it's very common that movies in China
media market had different format than that in US market. Did author buy a legal DVD in China and compare
that with the one in US. I guess he "did not want" to do that! But I did!


15 Nov 2013, 08:11 AM


BoboTheDog
The presence of subtitles does NOT mean that movie is pirated. Subtitles are commonplace in China in both
movies and TV.


As for not paying its contractors, you are taking the word of a short-seller who has interviewed 1 possibly
distgruntled former contractor. IF indeed this contractor was really interviewed, did really work for FU, and
really was not paid on a timely basis, perhaps there was a reason (quality, for example).


Finally, even if SOME stores given away free cards in a promotion that doesn't mean a) that someone (the
store) didn't pay for the cards,or b) that the practice is commonplace across China. SOME stores give away
itunes prepaid cards in the US. We don't therefore call itunes a scam.


15 Nov 2013, 10:37 AM


Elevator Music
The subtitles had references to the pirate groups who encoded them into the movie. This is a common
practice in pirated movies.


They place their name or nickname in the beginning of the film. This proves the company uses pirated
movies.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  re: Flagship stores - FAB still has not disclosed in over two months that its largest store, Joy
City, has been closed for remodeling. All these other revenues sources are low margin. Franchise fees from
kiosks are the major earnings driver. They are fake. How can any of it be trusted then?


13 Dec 2013, 09:29 AM


SurprisedGuy
Alfred,


You are 100% wrong that FAB has not disclosed that Joy City has been closed for remodeling. FAB's CEO
announced that in the November earnings call and one other SA poster has already brought that to you
attention. You don't want FAB to file a 8K every time they close close a store for any reason, do you?


Yes, I agree that kiosk licensing is the major earnings driver... per FAB, these revenues have the highest profit
margin and are growing in percent. I forget the percent revenue that the kiosk licensing makes up but as best
remember it's 30% or less, though growing. Time will tell if these kiosk licensing revenues are fake are not. I
have not seen any evidence from you (or any third party) that addresses the fakeness of FAB revenues, so
please stick to the facts, don't create facts without the evidence. :)


As you know, FAB just reported in its recent PR release that all cash accounts had been verified and is
inviting a third-party expert to come in review internal findings. You ply the trade of attacking the trust of the
companies you put in your sights, but your understanding of FAB and your evidence seem weak to me.


Live long and prosper...


SurprisedGuy


13 Dec 2013, 05:00 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Surprised Guy -  
My mistake. You are correct that FAB did mention the Joy City closure for remodeling in the conference call.
Personally I believe this was worthy of a press release and 8-K at the time of the closure since this one store
accounts for more than half (30,000 sf) of FAB's combined Chinese retail store space. But since they
mentioned it on the conference call I will stop bringing it up, unless the store turns out to still be closed in
January. The "remodeling" is supposed to be finished this month.


Regarding the other issues, I agree that time will tell. As long as FAB continues to fail to disclose the kiosk
locations for investors to check themselves, then investors should conclude that FAB fabricated its kiosk
sales. It is as simple as that.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1840562-fab-universal-the-face-of-piracy-in-china 40/51


Just a small point here but an essential one to the pursuit of truth in this ongoing situation. You keep wanting
to count kiosks, but FAB's business model is based on the sale of licenses for kiosks. There is a difference.
The licensee needs to buy the kiosk before it can be deployed. FAB's number is the number of licenses sold,
not the number of kiosks. In FAB's recent PR release, it was stated that all licensed kiosks in Beijing were
"deployed." Given FAB does not have a Redbox business model, I figure FAB can disclose or not disclose its
locations. Since the kiosks belong to the licensees and not FAB, there are issues in publishing the locations.
Let's see...


SurprisedGuy


15 Dec 2013, 10:22 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The kiosks belong to the franchisees, who according to the agreements are entitled to know
the location where FAB deploys them. But other than knowing the location where the kiosk is deployed, the
franchisee has no further involvement. FAB and Huzhong are responsible for membership, advertising, billing,
content, maintenance, basically everything. So FAB can certainly publish a precise list of all the location if
FAB wants to.

you are obvious contradicting yourself, in one paragraph you said:

Despite the obvious piracy, the staff of the Private Movie Club nevertheless insisted that all of the movie content was
properly licensed and not pirated.

I will wait for the company to clarify the piracy issue and other things but I notice a few very weak points of this article:


1) all pictures shows here bear almost no evidence that what the author want to convey. They are very murky and
shows nothing that company was doing anything illegal. One photo shows that a major FAB store was undergoing
remodeling and it has a sign on it's front in Chinese saying that "the store will reopen with whole new faces". But the
author cited this photo as an evidence that the store is fake. Obviously, the author want to deceive the US investors
who can not read Chinese. 
2) the article cited FAB's competitor to prove that FAB was using pirate version of movies in their theaters but did not
believe what FAB's own employee's arguments that those movies were legal copies. 
3) the article cited FAB's old contractor's word to show that FAB did not produce enough kiosk machines, even before
2012. Those contractors were clearly not in position to say anything good for FAB because clearly FAB is using new
contractors for their new kiosk machines.


15 Nov 2013, 04:12 AM


DWD Investing, Contributor

Author’s reply »  1) Has FAB ever disclosed that its Joy City store was closed for remodeling? Thats the
larger of the 2 flagship superstores. Seems material enough to me, as an investor, to be worth FAB
disclosing. 
2) FAB's employees have clearly been coached to deny all piracy, even when its staring them in the face.
FAB's Private Music Club staff hypocritically bragged about debuting a movie before its official release
upstairs in the competitor's legitimate theater. 
3) Those contractors had no reason to lie about the quantity they had produced. My investigators approached
them as potential customers. If anything, they should have exaggerated their production.

The photos, as I disclosed in my report, are screen stills from video recordings my investigators made of their

Chris Spencer, CEO, citizen of the USA. Bio:


Christopher J. Spencer, Chairman, President and Treasurer. Mr. Spencer, age 35, has served as our Chief Executive
Officer, President and as a director of Wizzard since February 7, 2001, and of our subsidiary, Wizzard Delaware,
since its formation in 1995. Mr. Spencer has been responsible for our overall direction since our inception and has
been instrumental in leading us to our current position in the speech recognition industry. In an online poll conducted
by Speech Technology magazine, Mr. Spencer was recently recognized as one of 20 top visionaries in the speech
recognition industry. The poll was targeted to the speech recognition professionals who read the magazine; poll
responses were monitored to ensure that employees of a nominee's company could not vote for that nominee.


Through Mr. Spencer's efforts, we have successfully obtained financing of approximately $6 million to date. These
funds have helped us complete the development of our IVA product and our variety of programming tools. Mr.
Spencer also sits on the Board of Directors of Cennoid Technologies, a software company that develops encryption
and compression software for the Internet.


From 1994 until 1996, Mr. Spencer founded and worked for ChinaWire, Inc., a high-technology company engaged in
financial remittance between international locations and China. Mr. Spencer's efforts were responsible or ChinaWire's
exclusive contract with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China. Mr. Spencer
was also involved in raising over $3,500,000 for the venture.


Mr. Spencer worked for Lotto USA, Inc. from 1992-1994, where he was founder and Chief Executive Officer for the
Pennsylvania computer networking company. Besides assisting in designing the technology, Mr. Spencer helped Lotto
USA implement an additional $1.00 service charge for every out-of-state lottery ticket sold in the State of
Pennsylvania, which substantially increased the revenues of this company.


From 1990 until 1992, Mr. Spencer worked for John Valiant, Inc., and was responsible for business concept
development and obtaining financing. Mr. Spencer's efforts combined an effective advertising/promotions campaign
with proper timing in the young adult/college restaurant/nightclub market. John Valiant was sold for a profit in 1992
after successfully operating three revenue-generating divisions.


===================


I find it hard to believe Mr Spencer would have chosen to run a company selling mostly pirated products from the US.


That idea is just beyond real.

Let's assume that they did have some pirated products and they're now informed and thus have taken action
to rid of those pirated items.


How much would that be really a problem? According to your claim, they sold those movies for 13c, a number
hardly mattered to the bottom line.


How much of the businesses are legit? 90%? 95%, or better, 99%?


My point is that the pirated items might not be such a big deal, if the SEC can't get hold of any material
evidence of the piracy.

What a bunch of crap? Of course there is piracy in China, and everywhere else in Asia. That's news? The Kiosks are
independent, if you owned one you'd stick some hot pirated movies in there, too. The question is, does this make FAB
a fraud? Clearly they are attempting to keep them legit...tough job. But does this make FAB a fraud? Hardly. Just step
up and state their 43M on the balance sheet is fake. If that's real, the business is real. Simple argument, but would be
short term and not much good to a short that wants this to play out. After all, the game is to make money, not be right.

Author’s reply »  The Kiosks are serviced by FAB (via Huzhong). So yes, FAB put pirated movies on the
kiosks at the direction of FAB, and later removed the pirated movies after I busted them. Furthermore (and
more importantly), FAB has not disclosed the locations of its 4,000 kiosks in Beijing. My investigators haven't
been able to find more than 3 dozen or so. FAB's sales director couldn't even provide additional locations for
us to check.

Cash isn't the issue. Stop mentioning it. No one questions their cash. The question is the company's ability to
make it without resorting to bonds or stock issuance.


As for piracy, yes, indep kiosk operators can do what they want. But if you're selling movies for $0.13 USD
then that's not a profitable business. What you're really selling is kiosks with a buyback provision and telling
kiosk buyers it's a risk free 'investment.' Sounds like a scam to me. So now you have 4 sources of income:
getting new investors (stocks/bonds), getting new kiosk buyers, selling ads, selling movies. Don't see very
much future profit in any of those.

Big & dwd: I followed AL vs. SCEI, so I knew he was legit. I really liked Wizzard and their successful growth in US
Apps niche market. When China got involved, I just couldn't figure the outcome. Happened to stumble across AL
initial article 10 minutes after its release on SA. About 45 minutes later I sold out into a very odd and quite unexpected
share price spike. Made a little ($.59/shr) and held on to my shirt at the same time! I have followed AL and I sure am
glad. Kudos for AL...jdm

Hey Dutch: Ya' got to wonder what happened to Rogers' Due Diligence?

Lesson to learn for anyone Greedily Lusting for Excessive Material Wealth at the expense of one's Ethics and
Reputation...jdm

Author’s reply »  FYI Rogers won't respond to my offer to meet to review the evidence. I think it is ridiculous that FAB
has not established an independent committee to review the evidence. Even LLEN did that (and then the committee
chair resigned).


FAB's "Vehement" denial is completely inadequate. I am 7 out of 7 exposing Chinese frauds. FAB's indepedent
directors should be meeting with me. Instead, it looks like they are giving CEO Zhang Hongcheng plenty of time to try
to cover up his fraud. Who will protect shareholders?

AL,


First of all, I give you credit where credit is surely due. For long term investors, there is an urgent need to
clean up the piracy act, especially at such organized scales. The problem may not be just FAB's. It's a shared
problem in the developing country around the world. Go to Mexico city, and you'll see the same things there.


Due to the pervasive nature of the piracy in China, I don't think people there really take it seriously, including
the local governments in China. It's part of the daily life, and it's everywhere. Most people simply don't have
the notion of piracy. The company may have become comfortable with the "status quo" and thus didn't even
pay attention to the US copy right laws.

The question is how much of the revenue were from those pirated products. If they're indeed close to free of
charge, it would indicate a way of promotion using pirated movies.


It's a very complicated situation.


05 Dec 2013, 03:41 PM


User 5877231
Not complicated.


IF pirated movies then stop / reduce.


IF stopped or reduced then kiosks become less attractive to kiosk buyers. Revenue stream #1 gone.


IF less kiosks then revenue stream #2 (from selling movies) gone.


IF less kiosks then revenue stream #3 (advertising on said kiosks) is also gone.


Then CEO and board close up shop and move on to next company, kiosk owners with the 2 yr guaranteed
buyback provisions can use their contracts as toilet paper and FU shareholders are well, you know.

Closing the Barn door won't help much now. 
How about Litigation vs Board Members as a deterrent to other want-to-be Fraudsters?...jdm

What evidence? I just flew to China yesterday and watched what must have been pirated movies the entire way if
your logic for subtitles and release dates applies. The only part that worries me is the 16M bond...but I think I figured
that one out. What if Zhang took the bond out first using his ownership of FAB Digital as collateral, then automatically
replaced them with his shares of FAB Media when the acquisition was completed? There would be no need to report
anything, as it was a simple private loan never involving the company...only his shares which he owns and do
whatever he wants with. 
As for the Main Store being closed for remodeling, I've read about that numerous times.....but I'm glad you admit the
stores are legit. 
As for the Kiosks....FAB has stated numerous times the vast majority are outside tier one cities (where the internet
exists so profits would be low). If you want to find them you're going to have to send your kids/investigators out into
the real fields. 
My believe right now is you missed on this one. Time will tell, but sure as heck you're report is NOT bullet proof.

Author’s reply »  Wizzard acquired FAB in 2012. The 12FAB Bonds were issued in 2013. So your theory fails
based on the timing alone. Any bond issuance by FAB subsidiaries in 2013 had to be reported and
consolidated, and if not consolidated then thoroughly explained at/before the issuance.


FAB claimed 4000 kiosks in Beijing. Since you are in China, why don't you go check them out yourself? My
investigators found only 22 kiosks in Beijing, in a total of 6 locations. 16 of the kiosks were conveniently in the
SoShow store for Jimmy Rogers to inspect. =FRAUD

Where there's smoke, there's fire.


It is highly unusual for a legitimate co to have its stock halted for this many days.


Even NQ didn't have a stock halt for this long. And NQ management was on the air, being interviewed, and
assuaging investor concerns.


Hopefully they begin trading and we can all cash out our Dec puts.

Author’s reply »  Update: Found only 20 media kiosks in Beijing that could actually be used to download
movies and music. Will publish report later today.

Thanks Alfred. So is there zero communication / response from management, no followup to you on their
part?

There is a complete mistrust in Chinese stocks and I avoid anything to do with China like the plague. Way too much
fraud to trust with investment funds. I see China and I run the other way. They better get their act together!
