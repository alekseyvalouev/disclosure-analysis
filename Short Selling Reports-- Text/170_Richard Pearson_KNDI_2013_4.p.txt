Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market
Oct. 4, 2013 10:11 AM ET68 comments
by: Richard Pearson


As I mentioned in my last article, Kandi Technologies (NASDAQ:KNDI) recently soared
from around $5.00 to a lifetime high of $9.20 in the span of just 8 days. Just like in June,
this monumental lift off came as the result of a single press release from Kandi and
several ARTICLES from individuals who are long the stock.


As has been the case in every instance in Kandi's past, these gains have not held. Kandi
has now declined 5 days in a row to $7.10, a very rapid decline of 23% from that recent
high just days ago. Yesterday the stock closed near the day's low of $7.02. If this rate of
decline continues, then Kandi will be below $5.50 by the end of next week.


It is clear that many investors who are active in Kandi have derived the vast majority of
their information from a series of highly bullish articles and from a private Yahoo message
board that was created specifically by those who promote Kandi. The information
presented seems to gain credibility because it appears to come from multiple independent
sources.


Unfortunately, much of the information which has been disseminated on Kandi (and which
has made the price soar) is 100% factually incorrect. Once again, as investors come to
realize that they have invested based on inaccurate information, the stock will certainly
erase its gains and go back below $5.00 once again.


To be specific, Kandi bulls have misled readers about numerous things including: Kandi's
manufacturing capabilities, Kandi's competitors, the current market demand for EVs in
China and the impact of government subsidies.


On the day before the publication of the Goldman article, Kandi had traded as low as
$6.60. On the day of the article, the stock rose as high as $8.60. Within 2 days, the stock
hit its all time high of $9.20. This was a rise of nearly 40% in just 2 days, based off of a
single article.


There is a very clear reason why the Goldman article (as with some of the others) moved
the stock. But as I will demonstrate, the truth is far different.

Readers should note that the statements below have come from independent sources
who have no position whatsoever in the stock. This includes Bloomberg, McKinsey,
Worldwide Watch and others.


Fact: The EV market in China suffers from too much capacity and too little demand


There are hundreds of EV manufacturers in China. These are not tiny no-name
companies. And they already have greater manufacturing capacity than Kandi. In addition,
the prices for their EVs can be seen to be lower than Kandi's. Their operational specs are
basically identical.


In my last article, I included a link to a search on China's Alibaba portal (in English) which
showed these hundreds of competitors. But clearly from the angry emails and comments
that have been written, we can see that almost no one even bothered to open the links
and read for themselves. Instead, a small number of vocal Kandi bulls simply rejected my
findings without even reading them.


I would strongly suggest that readers not simply rely on an interpretation of this list from
either me (I am short Kandi) or from Art Porcari (Art is long Kandi). Instead, I would
suggest that readers take a small amount of time to evaluate these competitors
themselves.


What they will see is that there are many producers of roadworthy and street legal
vehicles that derive the vast majority of their sales from entirely within China. Period.


Below is a very brief and partial selection from my Alibaba list, along with their delivery
capacities. As we can see, there are numerous manufacturers in China who have greater
manufacturing capacities AND lower prices than Kandi. I have included the link to the
individual vehicle listings so that viewers can see for themselves that these are mostly
identical to Kandi's cars. Beyond these, there are many more.

Of the EV makers that sell in China almost none of these companies trade on US stock
exchanges. The only ones that do (such as BYD and Geely) tend to be Hong Kong listed
and trade on the pink sheets. The EV makers in China typically market themselves only in
China. As a result, the vast majority of US investors are entirely unaware of the presence
of numerous competitors.


But the Kandi promoters have repeatedly claimed to have performed countless hours of
"due diligence" over the span of multiple years. The words "due diligence" appear
numerous times throughout their articles as assurance to readers about the thoroughness
of their work. Yet the information on competitors is easy to find for anyone who looks.


Author Tom Konrad (who was long the stock) lost a number of friends when he expressed
some caution on Kandi. This was true even though he maintained a (reduced) position as
a long. Unlike some of the more unrepentant bulls, Tom made sure to highlight the fact
that Kandi does have competition from some of the largest EV manufacturers in China.
Tom specifically highlighted Chery Automotive, Shandong Shifeng Group, and Hebei Yu
Jie Ma. Tom recently noted that he sold his Kandi stock as soon as it hit $7.00.


Point #1: It is inconceivable that such thorough "due diligence" from the Kandi
perma-bulls would have failed to uncover the existence of hundreds of nearly
identical competitors who have massive production capacity in China. Yet until my

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 4/30


last article, these facts were denied.


Point #2: The claim that Kandi is somehow unique ("the Tesla of China") is therefore
based on information that is 100% inaccurate. Yet this inaccurate claim has now
been made dozens of times.


Clearly the points above illustrate that there supply of EVs is far greater in China than the
Kandi bulls have stated. But of equal importance, it is also the case that demand is far
lower than the bulls have stated.


We can see that many of the bull arguments posted include the fact that China has
targeted 500,000 EVs by 2015 and 5 million by 2020. Some have cited the "10 Cities and
1,000 Vehicles" program which has been promoting EVs via subsidies in 25 cities
(including HangZhou). This program which includes subsidies has been in place since
2009.


The Kandi promoters have emphasized these impressive facts to indicate that there will
be tremendous demand for EVs in China. This information, coupled with the incorrect
information that only Kandi can supply them, has led investors to the conclusion that
Kandi will soon be worth a tremendous fortune. People who read the bullish articles on
these subjects, but who fail to do their own research, are then fully convinced. When the
articles come from multiple authors, it lends even greater credibility.


But the reality for Kandi and for the EV market in China is far different than what is being
consistently preached by the Kandi promoters. In fact, the reality is entirely consistent with
the results we see from Kandi's financial statements. It is also consistent with the share
price reactions we have seen from the few Chinese EV makers who trade on foreign
exchanges. It is also quite consistent with the unanimous view expressed by independent
media channels and Chinese automotive experts.


The only people telling us otherwise are a small number of individuals who happen to own
Kandi stock.


In July of 2013 (just 3 months ago), the WorldWatch institute put out a research piece
entitled: "China's Electric Vehicle Development Failing to Meet Ambitious Targets"


The report states clearly that



http://blogs.worldwatch.org/revolt/chinas-electric-vehicle-development-failing-to-meet-ambitious-targets/
5/22/2018 Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 5/30


Although these ambitious targets are developed and supported by the central
government, they seem overly optimistic and unattainable given the current
situation. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, only
about 20,000 new energy vehicles (EVs, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), and
PHEVs combined) were sold in 2011 and 2012, meeting only 4 percent of the 2015
target.


The current reality in China is that people aren't buying electric vehicles simply because
they don't want them. Clearly some of this is related to price. The bulls have stated clearly
that the recently announced subsidies will help that.


But the recent subsidies were actually a renewal of subsidies that have been in place for
years. During that time, and despite the subsidies, EV sales have been miniscule.


According to a report from McKinsey.


Government-sponsored subsidies have failed to stimulate consumer demand.
For example, while EV buyers in Shenzhen were offered some of the highest
subsidies in the country (e.g. RMB 120,000 per vehicle for BEV passenger cars),
automakers sold only about 600 BEVs there by 2011.


Beijing based Jack Perkowski has over two decades of experience as an expert in China's
auto industry. He formerly ran a joint venture which invested over $100 million in Chinese
auto parts JVs. In June 2013, Mr. Perkowski wrote an article in Forbes entitled "The
Reality Of Electric Cars In China".


He notes that:


recent meetings that we have had with most of China's local car assemblers confirm
that none are counting on electric vehicles for any meaningful amount of
growth anytime soon…. BYD , the poster child for electric vehicles in China, is also
de-emphasizing electric vehicles. … Due to their intellectual appeal, hype for
electric vehicles has always gotten ahead of the realities of market demand. In
China, this is once again proving to be true.


Quartz.com just put out an article last week in response to the latest Chinese subsidy
news entitled "Even the Chinese government can't command progress on electric cars".


According to Quartz:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 6/30


Beijing hasn't given up on the race to dominate electric cars. But scant sales have
turned China away from focusing on wheels on the road right now….About
three years ago, the US and China both announced ambitious aims to capture the
global electric car market by putting, respectively, 1 million and 500,000 electrified
vehicles on their roads by 2015. Today, neither country is on track to reach these
numbers-instead, the US has 130,000 electrics and China a paltry 40,000…. But
analysts doubt the renewed subsidies will finally trigger a buying binge


Those who are reading this article can feel free to completely disregard my views. After
all, I am short the stock and therefore biased. However…


Point #3 : US investors need to ask themselves why so many independent experts
such as Bloomberg, McKinsey, WorldWatch, Perkowski and Quartz, are all so
bearish on the EV market in China. Likewise, they need to ask themselves why the
only parties who are wildly bullish happen to be a small handful of investors who
also happen to own stock in Kandi?


There are a number of very common sense and logical reasons why EV sales continue to
be so poor in China. For these same reasons, most experts do not see a substantial rise
in EV sales any time soon.


Because these EV makers have competed on price, the quality of the vehicles is
undeniably very low. This should be visible from the pictures of Kandi's cars which are
available on line. The dozens of competing low speed, low priced vehicles are also nearly
identical.


The drive train for an electric vehicle is actually fairly pricey. Yet the cost of the whole
vehicle is only around $10,000. Readers need to use their common sense to decide if one
can actually manufacture a high quality automobile for just a few thousand dollars.


I recently test drove a Kandi vehicle that sold for around $10,000. It was not horrible, but
quality was clearly an issue. When I drove it, the glove box kept falling open. The windows
are old fashioned crank style windows that do not open easily. The seats vibrate a lot.
There is a loud whirring noise when driving. It is not the end of the world. But it is also not
a vehicle that many people would likely choose to drive - at any price - if they have any
alternative.


But keep in mind that Art Porcari has also test driven a Kandi car and he continues to tell
us all that Kandi is set for near term greatness. He is also long the stock and stands to
benefit from the rise in its share price.

5/22/2018 Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 7/30


Kandi, Geely and many other manufacturers have had EVs on the market for years. The
"10 Cities" program has been promoting EVs since 2009. Yet in the past two years, a
grand total of only 20,000-40,000 vehicles has been sold - by all manufacturers combined.
This is during a time when the subsidies were already in effect.


The reason why Kandi itself only sells a few hundred of these EVs is because most
people are not interested in driving such a low end vehicle. We have already seen that
cutting the price does not really boost sales when it is a product that people just don't
want. People need to keep in mind that the vehicles made by Kandi have absolutely
nothing in common with a high-end vehicle like Tesla.


A separate reason is far more practical. Anyone who has lived in China knows that
parking in any major city in China is very similar to trying to park in the middle of
Manhattan - or worse. It is extremely difficult and absurdly expensive. This should be
intuitive when one considers that the population of Beijing is over 20 million. The
population of Shanghai is over 40 million. That means that the population of Shanghai is
greater than the entire state of California - crammed into a single city. It is greater than the
population of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco Boston and Seattle -
combined! And that is just one city. Likewise, China has dozens of cities with populations
greater than 5 million.


What is the point? The point is that people who can't afford $10,000 for a car can also not
afford to drive or park a car at any price in China. Many US investors are clearly unaware
that in a country of 1.6 billion people, the vast majority of people do not live in single family
homes with an attached garage. They live in large high rise buildings which do not come
with their own garage space. If you gave them an EV for free, they would still have no
place to park it. Nowhere!


Those who can afford a home with a garage in China are typically not inclined to buy a
noisy low speed vehicle with crank windows and no amenities. Those who cannot afford a
garage have no interest in owning a car at all.


These notions are not my opinions. They are facts which are frequently expressed in the
Chinese media. One example can be found in an article entitled: "Dying for a Spot:
China's car ownership growth is driving a national parking space shortage"


Individual readers can come up with their own explanations for the very poor EV sales.
But the fact remains that there has been virtually no demand for low priced, low speed
EVs in China from consumers.

I am not saying that Kandi will not sell any vehicles. I am saying the best case scenario is
dramatically less than what the Kandi bulls are promoting. It is clear that Kandi and the
dozens of other major EV makers will hope to sell the low cost, low speed vehicles to taxi
and other public transportation systems.


WorldWatch agrees with this, saying:


As a result, more than 80 percent of the so-called "energy-saving and new-energy
vehicles" (EVs, HEVs, PHEVs, fuel cell vehicles, and other energy-saving
conventional vehicles)across the 25 pilot cities were purchased for public
transportation service rather than private use, showing a weak market demand for
these types of vehicles among private consumers.


Likewise, McKinsey shares this view, stating:


In addition, government subsidies and incentive policies have proven to be far more
effective at stimulating the purchase of EVs for public fleets than they have been at
stimulating private consumer demand.


The HangZhou agreement with Kandi was announced in 2012 but material sales have yet
to occur. At some point in time, if material sales actually materialize, this will be a good
start for Kandi. Kandi may therefore be able to sell several thousand vehicles over the
next few years. But this is categorically different than the predictions of $2 billion in sales
from Mr. Goldman or even $100 million in near term sales from Mr. Porcari.


While there may ultimately be demand for even more LSVs from various taxi and public
transport companies across China, it must also be remembered that there are potentially
hundreds of companies - with massive over capacity in production - who are vying for this
same business.


Point #4: Kandi bulls have projected massive sales figures by simply assuming that
demand is there for 100% of what Kandi can produce. Yet despite ongoing
subsidies and incentives for the past 3 years, only 20,000-40,000 EVs have been
sold across all of China by all EV makers combined.


Question: Did Kandi move due to "news" or hype ?


Whenever there is any news which applies to EVs in China, Kandi's promoters begin
trumpeting the development as being a massive catalyst for Kandi's near term profits and
share price. So far this gambit has worked well, and the share price shows sharp jumps



http://www.most.gov.cn/ztzl/kjzjbxsh/kjzjbxxnyqc/201301/t20130107_98930.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 9/30


(but which only last for a few days).


We saw this sort of hype in June when Kandi announced its inclusion on the MIIT
approved vehicle list. The problem with this news is that it applied to hundreds of other
vehicle manufacturers and thousands of other models. No other EV manufacturer saw
their stock surge even though they were included on this list too. In fact, no one else even
bothered to announce this "news" because it was a non-event. Yet Kandi's share price
quickly doubled to $8.50. It was also interesting that the official list had been published in
China weeks before Kandi chose to announce it for themselves. Kandi delayed the
promotion of this news until it was much closer to issuing $26 million in stock.


This latest "news" in September was that China had codified its subsidies for EVs. Again,
this was trumpeted as a major and transformational development for Kandi and the stock
soared to $9.20 on the back of Mr. Goldman's article. As was the case in June, this news
was released over a week earlier. Kandi did not put out a pres release on the subject until
immediately before filing a S3 covering the sale of over 1 million warrants which would
raise $5 million for Kandi.


As was the case in June, the September news applied to the entire EV market in China.
Of greater importance is the fact that these were not new subsidies at all, but instead were
just a renewal of past subsides. And in sharp contrast to the analysis from Kandi
promoters (who own Kandi stock), independent media suggested that the news was not
so great.


So what does the independent media have to say about the latest "news" ?


Bloomberg offered the following commentary on September 17th, following the
announcement of the subsidies:


The new policy is basically the same as the previous one and doesn't really
address the underlying problems," Han Weiqi, an analyst with CSC International
Holdings Ltd. in Shanghai, said yesterday in a phone interview. "Unless there are
follow-up measures to step up support for hybrids, today's policy is not expected
to spur the EV market.


A new subsidy plan has been long awaited," Ole Hui, Hong Kong-based analyst at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411), wrote in a report today. "This new plans seems
less aggressive than earlier targets.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 10/30


So how did the share prices of other EV makers respond to the news ? They certainly did
not shoot up by 50% like Kandi did. Following the release of the subsidy news, Bloomberg
noted that:


BYD Co. (1211), the maker of electric vehicles that counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) as a shareholder, fell as much as 3 percent as of 11:12 a.m.
in Hong Kong trading.SAIC Motor Corp. (600104), which began offering its Roewe
E50 electric car in November, slid as much as 1.4 percent in Shanghai.


But for the Kandi bulls, the recent "news" of Chinese subsidies was to be transformational
and would send Kandi into the stratosphere.


What is the point of this ? The point is that the facts being conveyed by a small number of
vocal Kandi bulls (who happen to own the stock) is wildly at odds with view being
expressed by the mainstream media, including Bloomberg, McKinsey, WorldWatch and
many others. The movements in the share prices of other EV makers seems to agree with
Bloomberg. Only Kandi has soared to new highs. But this sharp rise has been based on
the analysis and interpretation of this small group of individuals who profit from gains in
Kandi's stock.


Point #5: Even when news has been neutral or negative, Kandi bulls have used any
mention of EVs in China to proclaim a new, transformational tipping point for the
stock. This has consistently been at odds with the views of independent media
sources and the share price reactions of the few publicly traded Chinese EV
makers.


Conclusion


There are several realities that we must deal with in looking at Kandi.


The first reality: there are a large number of investors who simply do not even care if
Kandi has a bright and legitimate future or not. They simply know that these hyper bullish
articles have consistently been able to provide the stock with a sharp (but brief) boost.
They are happy to buy and make a quick and easy profit. But they have no intention of
waiting around to see if the hype is real. As a result, they quickly sell to lock in quick
profits. This is why Kandi has repeatedly given up its gains on each surge in 2013.


It can be easily seen on comments below articles and on message boards that various
investors are now counting much more on a continuing stream of bullish articles to pump
up the share price than they are on any actual progress from Kandi itself. This is a very

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 11/30


bad sign for any stock.


The second reality: The information which has been used to promote Kandi's share price
has often been 100% incorrect. Kandi is NOT the ONLY supplier of EVs in China, there
are hundreds of identical offerings. Demand for EVs is not astronomical. It is not even
merely substantial. The extremely and persistently low levels of demand have been cause
for concern in various independent articles and industry reports. Likewise, the latest
"news" regarding the EV industry and subsidies in China has been negative and has seen
share prices of other Chinese EV makers fall rather than skyrocket. Analysis by
independent media sources (who do not happen to own Kandi stock) have been
unanimous on this front.


But because the numerous other EV competitors in China are unknown in the US, many
US investors have come to believe that this inaccurate information is true. The fact that
multiple writers have been posting very similar (but inaccurate) information has caused
many investors to give this information even greater credence.


The fact remains that many investors who have bid up the price of Kandi by 50-100%
have done so based on information which is verifiably 100% incorrect. As they come to
appreciate this, the stock will almost certainly correct to below $5.00, from where it began.


The third reality: Kandi bears all the hallmarks of a classic stock promotion. A small
number of investors produce well timed and coordinated articles designed to generate
maximum enthusiasm for the stock. Much of the information is inaccurate. The promotion
is then coordinated with organized buying to elevate the price.


The promoters of Kandi have then set very lofty share price targets which are often
several hundred percent above the current level.


But readers need to ask themselves this: if Kandi is destined to rise to $30-50 in the near
future, then why is there such a desperate need to continue pumping the stock when it
gets down to $5.00 ? Why is there such a desperate need to defend the stock as soon as
it falls by as little as 50 cents ?


If the share price were really headed to $30-50, then the right strategy would be to simply
turn off ones computer and ignore the stock for the next 6-12 months. One could simply
ignore arguments like mine because they would truly have no impact on the share price 6
months from now. These gyrations would be just random noise over the period of a few
months.

Comments (68)


The determination by the promoters to get the share price up basically tells us that they do
not have the confidence in Kandi that they claim. Their rabid concern over the share price
can only be explained by assuming that they are looking to sell in the near term and at
prices not far above current levels.


Clearly the only thing that would really propel Kandi to such lofty levels would be actual
success on the commercial front. But the steady stream of articles designed to pump up
the share price has continued anyway. And now, we are told to expect a full promotional
video produced by a professionally hired video production team. Once again, if the stock
is inevitably headed for $30, then such a promo video would not be necessary. Nor would
it have any marginal impact relative to the triple digit gains which are expected.


The good news is that for those who really believe that Kandi is truly destined for near
term greatness, detailed findings like these really don't matter. Investors who feel this way
should simply disregard this article and not even watch the daily share price.


Disclosure: I am short KNDI. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

"The current reality in China is that people aren't buying electric vehicles simply because they don't want them." 
Hm, that is a very specific conclusion to draw. How do you know they don't want them? Have you asked? 
It could be that they are waiting to see more battery-swap stations built first? Or just some charging stations. 
Maybe there are some other reasons, you need to have a supporting fact or two here to draw a conclusion.

Dave T. Kandi doesn't sell EV's to consumers, it sells them to leasing companies who in turn with the
Government Subsidies lease them for up to 36 months full turnkey to include free unlimited battery
exchanges, insurance, parking and licence. They have a current standing agreement with the City of
Hangzhou to lease up to 20,000 ev's by the end of 2014, and starting this month.


The also rent EV's by the hour in a carshare program for 3.25 an hour. They expect to have at least 5000 in
service this quarter now that subsides are in place.

Pearson knows all this since both are covered extensively with back up links in the specific articles that
pearson keeps accusing us of pumping, yet he chose to ignore it the major difference between KNDI and
others.and will not respond to comments about these items.


Use common sense, China has spent over $3 billion dollars just the past two years building an EV
infrastructure. Do your really think they are going to abandon this desperately needed solution to their
pollution problems and high demand for petrol at this stage of the game. Of course not. They are going to
support measures such as KNDI provides to get the job done.


It should be very clear that as a self proclaimed short seller in KNDI, that he must be reaching desperation
levels since this is his third attack in less than two weeks. (two this week)


Remember, KNDI has a reported short position of 3.3 million shares now, up more than three fold since his
two attack articles back in June.


04 Oct 2013, 11:58 AM


DaveT
Arthur, yes, sorry, my comment was a bit brief, but I was unimpressed with Pearson's use of logic and wanted
to point it out in a short rebuttal.


What was on my mind and should have mentioned was that as he had lumped 2011 with 2012 data it
(whatever quality his data) was covering a period in which the swap-or-charge infrastructure build-out had
only just started (let alone the EV rental garages, gaps in subsidy clarity, the absolute need to reduce pollution
etc).

That chart also is misleading - most of those companies sell 80 to 90% of their vehicles abroad and not in
China - nor do any of those companies have EV approval for ANY of their vehicles. In fact, KNDI has ten
approved to go and no other company on that list has one. They outnumber the entire base of competition by
themselves yet that is also not in the article.


Also I would like to know for the sake of disclosure what his position short is in the stock - what price and how
many shares. Two pieces in one week on Seeking Alpha is a lot of attention for one man who does not
disclose anything.

Mr Porcari,


A few questions for your reply...precisely, what does "standing agreement" for "UP TO 20,000" actually mean?
Your next para states "expect to have up to 5,000 in service this quarter" ...Again what does expect to and up
to actually mean?


What does the fine print say? Or, is there any print at all in forward guidance for the company or is this all just
high hopes and hype?


To me, the biggest hole in your rebuttal was using "Common sense" and government spending in the same
sentence??? Really??? Not to mention anything being stated by the Chinese that pertains to any economic
topic is considered to be anecdotal on a good day and an outright untruth on the average day.


All in all, you have helped to create a nice little money making machine..." buy low...sell high...wash rinse and
repeat" and don't forget "take no prisoners"


And finally, your last para alluding to 3.3 million shares short....what does that have to do with the value
proposition of the company? Absolutely Nothing! It simply solidifies my opinion that you are 100% about the
stock price and 0% about the actual value of the company. In the end run, the actual value of the company
will be what is important...without actual value, eventually there will be no company.

don't u think it's normal for a stock to give back half its gains after a huge run (like kndi had)? A pullback to 7.10 -
actually 7.45 now, is quite healthy. Previously, you've stated that kndi would go back to the 2-3 dollar range, so
obviously you've reconsidered your opinion, without admitting you were twice as bearish as you should've been. The
highs have been getting higher, and so have the lows.

Hehe, thanks Richard. It is in fact yours as well as several other bulls' articles that brought my attention a week ago.
Since then, I've bought heavily into KNDI, in the 10s of thousands of shares. I am a beneficiary of Chinese
government's policy. The most recent case is that, Chinese government has launched a series of policies to rescue its
once ailing solar industry, and completely brought it back to life. In fact, as a deep Chinese solar investor, which once
held a combined close to million shares of Chinese tier #1 solar stocks, you can tell that I have done fairly well thanks
to Chinese government's policy. My vivid experience tells me that when Chinese government is behind a specific
industry, you better follow, not against it. Now, you also know how badly the air of all major Chinese cities are polluted,
especially Beijing, and that has obviously triggered Chinese government to make a tremendous resolution to spend
big money and tackle this air pollution issue head-on. And one obvious and direct hit, is to reduce the car pollution,
and therefore EV is no doubt the bright future. All major EV makers, including Kandi, will benefit. So, that is my reason
to use my solar profit and jump into KNDI. I don't really care what's the current EV market situation is. Once Chinese
government jumps in, it's completely a new ball game. Let's wait and see! I don't mind the daily up-and-downs in $1
range. I look at the future, i.e. 100%, 200% or even high return in 1 year or 2.


So, once again, thanks for bringing my attention to KNDI!

Adoption and business plan viability is certainly the elephant in the room with new(ish) technology, but my experience
is that low cost producers quietly win market share while the high priced (and often better publicized) pioneers fail to
achieve their lofty projections. KNDI comes to this market from the RV space, a lower cost platform, in a country used
to much smaller vehicles than the US, where someone like Polaris would have a hard time meeting regulatory
requirements (although GM's Puma/EN-V project anticipates much smaller vehicles).


But here's the interesting question for KNDI: If RV/ATV sales go up 15% a year and EVs hit a very modest
15,000/year, what happens to the stock price?

Can you explain to me why you didn't mention the car-share program? Programs like these have been highly
successful in other parts of the world. Kandi has one car-share garage completed and many more in the works. A
Geely spokesman has indicated this will involve 5-10k EVs in the near future. This is obviously a huge part of Kandi's
future that has been totally ignored.

Mr. Pearson, I respect your effort in preparing these recent articles, however, I have to disagree with you on several
points made in this one. While I am preparing a more extensive follow up article to my previous work done on Kandi, I
must briefly share some of my recent experience of my visit to Kandi's headquarters in Hangzhou and two production
facilities in Jinhua and Changxing.


Regarding production capacity- both facilities are built to manufacture 100,000 vehicles per year and are currently
operating at 50% capacity. I personally witness thousands of vehicles in various stages of production including
several hundred completed and waiting to be rolled out to the car share pilot program in Hangzhou. Even at this 50%
capacity, Kandi would be placed third on your list above.


Regarding vehicle performance- I was also fortunate to test drive the compact EV model that is designed for the car
share program. Nothing broke, and the car handled great. The inside was comfortable and acceleration was rather
impressive. I even witnessed a car share vehicle on the road in Hangzhou, handling traffic just fine. There was a slight
hum while driving the vehicle but nothing that anyone would notice, given the dim of an average street in Chinese
cities. Besides, the vehicles are designed to fight air pollution, not noise pollution. That point is especially important to
me as I currently look out at about 100m visibility from my window in Beijing, due to the heavy air pollution tonight.


Finally, you consistently fail to mention the visionary car sharing system that Chairman Hu is diligently preparing for
the citizens of PRC. I fully intend to share the experience of my visit to Kandi and observation of its operation in the
coming weeks by submitting a full article with photos and video. Thank you for your time.

Applying your timing logic one can come to this scenario:


There is a 3.3M share short position, of which you are part owner. You know there is positive information coming out
any day (you refer to this in your article). So you release two negative articles within days in order to push down the
price. How is this scenario any different than the bull scenario described in your article?


04 Oct 2013, 11:00 AM


geleng
 
for the sake of clarity, there were only ~700K shorts 4-months ago. It jumps to 3.3M. The total issued shares
are ~37M. We know that Mr. Hu (the CEO) holds firm ~15M of them. And, there are, I believe, ~7M holds in
cash account (which are and will not being lend) by KNDI longs. Plus, there are ~8M, hold by institutional (per
the recent filings). Of course, the 8M by institutional, you do not know if they lend the share for shorts.
So,figure it out on how much the actual float share available.


If I am the institutional investors, I may just lend it to shorts to get better price to accumulate.


The shorts position has been more that quadrupled when the stock price doubled. Go figure.

In addition, KNDI had been in the NASDAQ Regulation SHO for 11 days. Means that the SEC has identified

Kandi stock surged 2 weeks ago because on Sept 17 the government 
subsidies were announced. This was the starting gun for the EV race. 
In 2008, I was inclined to follow Warren Buffet into BYD. 
Charlie Munger was very impressed by Wang Chuan-Fu the founder of BYD.  
Buffet himself admitted he knew nothing about EVs but he trusted his sidekick Munger. 
BYD has an impressive track record. 
But there is nothing disruptive about his offering. 
I was more impressed with another engineer - Hu Xiaoming.  
Years of experience in electrical engineering and a fistful of patents under his belt. 
He has a vision which went further than Elon Musk at Tesla. 
Mr. Hu is to the EV world what John D Rockefeller was to the gasoline industry.  
By designing robotic swappable battery packs in from the beginning he has he has eliminated range anxiety. 
By the customer not owning the the battery, battery anxiety is eliminated.  
The Kandi vertical parking garages are a huge advntage. 
The policy of each province having to source 30% of EV from other provinces is a huge advantage for Kandi. 
When Geely, China's largest domestic automaker need a partner to get into EV it chose Kandi.  
As a result Kandi has access to a country wide dealership and distribution network. 
Kandi cars are cheap, so suitable as quota fillers for the other provinces. 
No doubt Buffet will make money with BYD. 
When Geely need a partner it chose Kandi. 
When the State Grid needed a partner for it's V2G project it chose Kandi.

This is such a well-stated reply that I can only add that Kandi also has an enormous 'first-starter' advantage in
low-cost urban EV's, and their concentration on the lease and rental market will give them a huge market
share while competitors are still trying to sell to individuals. Kandi will do that too, of course, but will not need
to rely on that as a majority of revenue for a long time.

Anyone who has done a minimum DD and put in a little bit of thought could tell you what sets KNDI appart from those
"hundreds of competitors". 
* MIIT approval that makes it eligible for gov. subsidies and which the vast majority of those no-name makers lack. 
* A patented solution to address the primary concern of prospective EV owners: Refueling. 
* A number of working agreements with major players that will enable them to put in place the infrastructure
necessary for a successful rollout.

substantial money into achieving that goal -- and he has! The only thing Elon Musk does better than Mr. Hu is

Jte- The CEO already owns over 40% of the stock and did in fact buy some 35,000 shares a few years ago
with cash he had in the US. It is not easy for Chinese Nationals to buy US stocks unless they have cash Off-
shore. While most Chinese executives do have such off shore accounts, due to KNDI's heavy involvement
with very high level Government entities, he would rather not set up an off-shore account which is looked at

was that Pearson was wrong in accusing the company of doing an "At The Market" (ATM) financing which is a
"hidden rolling, not disclosed in real time" type of financing. Here is exactly what they the Company said:


"..A shelf registration statement (S-3) is authorized by the SEC under rule 415 allowing a single registration
statement to be filed by certain qualified issuers which permit public offering of multiple securities for up to
three years. In a shelf registration, securities usually are registered for sale either on a continuous or delayed
basis. However, the Company's current S-3 registration is not an "At the Market" or "ATM" offering as
described in the short seller's article as: "Kandi's S-3 filing is known as an "At the Money" registration
statement." We believe the short seller either lacks basic knowledge of securities regulation or simply
releasing misleading information to the investing public."

aedius-I might also add that KNDI's CEO personally has guaranteed most all of the Companies Bank Dept
since the stock started trading in the US. Why?, not because the Company has to, but because the Company
gets a lowwer interest rate.


Not too many US CEO's that own less than half their Company stock Takes that type of risk on behalf of all
shareholders.


Example for the last 10Q:


"Monthly interest only payments at 6.94% per annum, due January 25, 2013, secured by the assets of the
Company, guaranteed by Mr. Hu Xiaoming, .."


Link to 10Q.

I just got back along with another Seeking Alpha author form a week long visit with KNDI in China. This my
second visit all paid for by me. I along with the other author intend to publishing a series of article with plenty
of pictures, video and information that should prove beyond any doubt, the legitimacy of KNDI as the leader of
EV technology in China. Pearson knows this since I mentioned it clearly in my last article this past Tuesday.


Why has Mr. Pearson, made repetitive attacks at this time IMO, perhaps so he hopefully can cover his short
position before our articles are released. After all, he has given me credit for creating major moves up with my
prior articles. As a declared short seller, it is any short sellers goal to cover their short position before the
stock makes a significant move up. Or maybe he just wants others to share his risks as a short seller, only he
know.


Why has Mr. Pearson, made repetitive attacks at this time IMO, perhaps so he hopefully can cover his short
position before our articles are released. Additionally, as Pearson is aware since he claims to be a "China
Expert" (who BTW, though from my discussion with the Company, he has never even attempted to contact
the company, let alone visit) this past week has been a holiday week in China with no one from the company
available to either respond to his articles or to perhaps put out some updated PR's. This includes company
IR. Lets see what happens next week.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 23/30


"The current reality in China is that people aren't buying electric vehicles simply because they don't want them" 
Whatever data you use must serve you well... 
You ignore the sales of LSEV's such as in Shandong Province where 83000 LSEV's were sold in 2012 and this is
expected to increase another 50% this year. Most of those LSEV's are not even MIIT approved and not according
Chinese BEV standards. 
Only few models can count on subsidies and Kandi EVs are part of those few ones.  
No wonder that Kandi/Geely are ready for this huge opportunity in Shandong!

I just noticed you used the following phrases in your article in reference to the bull argument:


"Unfortunately, much of the information which has been disseminated on Kandi (and which has made the price soar)
is 100% factually incorrect."


"Point #2: The claim that Kandi is somehow unique ("the Tesla of China") is therefore based on information that is
100% inaccurate."


"The second reality: The information which has been used to promote Kandi's share price has often been 100%
incorrect."


These are extremely bold statements yet you don't provide any details about what is 100% incorrect/inaccurate.
Please elaborate on this because I've read the bull statements and I have verified that many of their statements are
indeed factual. A blanket statement indicating the bull arguments are "100% incorrect" seems like quite a stretch to
me.

After reviewing the table Mr. Pearson has so diligently provided in his article, along with the Ministry of Industry and
Information (MIIT Controlling Government Ministry for EV's) , EV approved list, I can attest and assure you that none
of the eight companies in his table have Government Approval (MIIT) for national highway use and sales within China.
Though in one case, Shangdog Shifeng Co. does have limited approval as a Low Speed Electric Vehicle (LSEV), just
like the KNDI Coco car that Pearson claims he drove in the US is an LSEV.


The car he drove is a lead acid battery LSEV called a Coco (look it up on google) with a top speed allowed in the US
of only 25-35 mph. Over the last four years, KNDI has sold approximately 4000 in the US. It doesn't even come close
to resembling in either appearance or performance with the two and four doro Lithium battery powered cars KNDI has
national approval for in China.


BTW, KNDI has a total of 10 Nationally approved EV's in China to include four trucks and a van. However, they are
currently selling only three pure EV's

That should be an article in itself. That chart needs further clarification - let me rephrase that - that chart
needs a full addendum article attached to it. By using that chart the way it is being used - the implication don't
seem to be correct.

Jtechkid
Last i checked TSLA stock is 170 points higher so your reply makes zero sense about ownership. My point is its been
implied the CEO of KNDI is worth over 100 million? You would think buying KNDI shares directly would be the most
bullish case for KNDI and shareholders and if their right a good investment for him instead diluting himself and
shareholders .

first off you have a "peasant problem" in your presentation. in other words there are literally billions of batteries "lying
around" out there (in the form of lap top computers that can be had for next to nothing) and as a consequence "when
moving from ox cart to vehicle" these battery powered vehicles simply don't show up in your numbers. in other words
by excluding BICYCLES you've missed the whole story. these folks are simply putting a battery on a bike and "getting
there." this is the most vibrant battery vehicle market in the world and as such i would not short it. this is a lot like the
US steel "market" in the 19th century where we were making so much of it to be great all you needed was to be good.
i will admit to having done zero due diligence on KNDI...but clearly they pass the "merely good" test...which in a hyper
competitive market such as it is for EV's usually means your a winner. this is not a "coastal city" story. as with the USA
this is all happening in the interior with people just fooling around and having a good time. since fossil fuel is not an
option (it's simply not available) then obviously you go with what you got...namely a lithium ion battery and the grid. so
the car is only 500 bucks...is that a problem or a solution?

"Of the EV makers that sell in China almost none of these companies trade on US stock exchanges."


Why is that? Seems to me that they are inconsequential.


You countinue to say: "The EV makers in China typically market themselves only in China." If that is the case, how
many are profiting?


In all of the comments, I've heard more than once that the companies on your table are not MITT approved and
exporting vehicles. To me, all of these others sound like counterfeit DVDs of a true product.


So what is the structure of sales for all of these competitors in comparison to Kandi? What percent is sold within
China? What percent are exported?


04 Oct 2013, 04:41 PM


Michael F.
The author's statements that KNDI has hundreds of EV competitors with huge capacities and that the Chinese public
doesn't want to buy EV's seems contradictory. Why would there be hundreds of companies building millions of
vehicles that no one wants?

Alibaba: I can list right now that I have 30,000 EV cars available. It's like the Craigslist of China.


And I think you are comparing apples to oranges. This is a car swapping company that has MITT approval. (Leases
and rentals vs. owning). And they have patents on battery swapping technology.


Why do you think this company has no value? Why would you short if you didn't think it has no value? If it does have
value, then are you trying to manipluate it because it has a very small float? Why would you short something that
would dramatically reduce air pollution in a country that is tremendously blighted?

Dear mr. Pearson, 
I am so sorry that your arguments are fallacious.  
If you would have been slightly right, we could have had the opportunity to buy more KNDI's at 5.0 as you "predicted"
( I mean wished ) in your article.

A heavy short article such as this would normally pull all the shorts together to hammer the price down. That's not
happening - we are up 5.21% at the close - so some are covering. Is it our author, Richard Pearson, or is it the big
short who owns most of the 3.3 million short interest?


Last out holds the bag.

KNDI is just a joke.


EV in China: KNDI cannot fight with the big players. There are just too many big car makers which are fighting very
hard to sell their cheaper but high quality EV in China including Toyota, Ford, GM, their joint ventures and local car
makers.


I do not have position on this stock. It is just waste of my time on this stock.


It is very easy for smart investors to figure it out that KNDI is a fraud. It has miss-reported its revenues in 2010-2012
and will continue doing so.


There are many good companies to invest such as all Chinese solars JKS, CSIQ, SOL, DQ, etc. My buy-and-hold
already give me 500% - 700% return this year from investing into those companies. Also made big money on many
more bio tech companies such as CRME, OMER, GNVC, HNZP, CTIC, GERN, SKBI, PETX etc.

Sure Toyota, Ford and GM will get involved - if there is decent profit in it for them.  
Kandi is not anticipating cornering 100% of the market.

5/22/2018 Kandi: Experts Weigh In On China's EV Market - Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:KNDI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 27/30


In 2012, China’s gross national income per capita was $6,091. 
A Kandi buyer can get an $11,000 car for less than $3,000. 
Would you spend more than half your gross salary for a small car? 
Millions will ditch the electric bike for one of these.


Kandi has a fistful advantages. 
1. First mover. - Production capacity in place now. 
2. Buy or lease option - leasing companies already signed up. 
3. Kandi setting the standard for swap stations and vertical garages 
4. Parking designated for Kandi cars. 
5. A JV with the biggest most successful domestic operator - Geely 
Mr. Li Shufu founder of Geely is one smart operator. 
6. By doing an ingenious deal with State Grid Kandi removes a  
huge inventory of cost in owning the batteries.  
Ask Mr Musk about that cost.


Sure the PRC government will allow JVs with foreign automakers - 
that will bring exposure to the best technologies on the planet. 
But do you think they will allow a situation where large profits are going abroad subsidized by the Chinese
taxpayer. 
- I don't think so. 
The PRC government will decide who are the winners and losers.

That's a very poor use of statistics. Not all capitae (heads) earn income, the very young don't, the very old
don't, the disabled don't. Taking that into account, someone who does earn an income must earn well above
the statistical per capita income. In addition, per capita income is about the whole nation including the very
poor farmers. The cars are designed for middle class city folk who probably are above the national average.

jsIRA- KNDI has NEVER misreported its revenues. If they had, either you would not know it, or they would
have had to amend their SEC filings.


Now if you are referring to the the comments that Pearson picked out of the three year old Sharesleuth article,
The Company addressed the SS allegation at that time with the following 8K letter to shareholders.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1728792-kandi-experts-weigh-in-on-chinas-ev-market 28/30


Since the letter is filled with tables that will break down if I try to paste here, let me just paste the last two lines
of the 8k:


This mistake only affected unit count and not the total revenues as was described above, and which produced
the results presented in Table 3 in this letter. It is this Table 3 that we will file to correct our 10-K, with a
summary of the detailed explanation in this letter.


One final note: our revenues are accurately reported, and the sources of our revenues are accurately
described. We apologize again for the error and the confusion it created.


Good luck to you on your Chinese Solar companies. Must be a dozen trading in the US and competing for US
investors, and hundreds businesswise cutting each others throats in China.


I'll stick with the only stock Americans can trade that is leading in EV technology in China.


Lets see who does best from here on out.

Captain - It wasn't intended as an absolute - just as an attempt at understand perspective. 
The same income figure for the US is about $50K a year. 
(Yes I know there is huge income disparity in the US but there are millionaires in China too). 
If GM needed a $50B bailout (and Chrysler $10B) to survive in a market where the "average income" is $50K
a year, they will have to do some radical thinking if they are to thrive in a country where the "average income"
is $6K a year. A bit simplistic I know. 
Being a "big player" as jsIRA called them does not mean they can muscle their way into China like they could
in Europe or South America. 
They will sell cars in China but not in the volumes like Kandi.  
I am not about to sell my kandi shares to buy Ford :-)

I am wondering why there is no "Editor's note" on this article after it was modified once Mr. Goldman's article was
reinstated. Mr. Pearson's paragraph stating that Mr. Goldman's article had been removed from Seeking Alpha is no
longer in this article. Are article’s often changed without informing readers?

Why is the battery deal announced this morning worthy of an 8-k or a 6% jump in the stock in the pre-market? Read
the details people (or the lack there of), the 8-K does not give a contract duration. Kandi sold 3,915 Super-mini-cars
(EVs) in 2012, so the order for 12,036 batteries could be filled in a little over three years resulting in no growth in EV
sales.

Thanks for the article, was not at all convinced by the company or all the articles claiming it to be the Chinese Tesla
so actually before reading your article and as u suggest went to alibaba and found dozens of companies making
those type of cars witch I are no different from toys for grown ups like cheap Chinese motorcycles, tricycles, etc, as
there is nothing fancy or elaborated in their manufacturing or final product beyond in this case.... the batteries witch
ironically enough Kandi does not make so a toy sold for $10K with battery, I wont even bother to ask how much a
battery is but a nice chunk of this is supposed to be the next Telsa?  
I wont be shorting the stock but much less buy into this pump and dump scheme.
