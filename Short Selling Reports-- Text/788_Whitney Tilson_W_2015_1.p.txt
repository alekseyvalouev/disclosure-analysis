Why Wayfair Is My Largest Short Position
Nov. 10, 2015 8:49 AM ET48 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


In an article on its web site yesterday, the New York Times revealed that Wayfair
was, until very recently, likely selling toxic, formaldehyde-drenched Chinese-made
laminate flooring to at least a handful of customers.


The formaldehyde problem, by itself, isn’t a major issue; rather, it’s compelling
evidence to me of Wayfair’s gross incompetence and/or a business that’s completely
out of control.


I am also short Wayfair because it has one of the worst business models I’ve ever
seen. Competing head-to-head vs. Amazon, Home Depot, Target, Williams-Sonoma,
etc., I think the company’s odds of ever reaching breakeven, much less earning a
profit, much less earning enough of a profit to justify a $4 billion market cap are
close to zero.


I predict that Wayfair’s stock will be below $10 within a year.


The New York Times has broken a story I’m involved with that major U.S. public
companies, including Wayfair and via Wayfair, Wal-Mart (I’m sure they will be horrified to
learn), were, until the Times reporter called, likely selling toxic, formaldehyde-drenched
Chinese-made laminate flooring seven months after the 60 Minutes story aired that has
destroyed Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL). Wayfair is my largest short position by far.


Here are some excerpts from the article below (I’m mentioned a couple of times):

As Lumber Liquidators continues to struggle in the aftermath of a safety crisis over
its Chinese-made laminate flooring, a much smaller flooring company has been
drawn into the spotlight.


The hedge fund manager who publicly accused Lumber Liquidators of selling wood
with dangerous levels of formaldehyde is leveling the same claims against Ark
Floors, a California importer of Chinese wood products that are sold all over the
United States.


…Test results from five types of Ark laminate show levels of formaldehyde “well
above” the emission standards set by the California Air Resources Board, according
to Josh Hosen, senior manager of certification programs at HPVA Laboratories, a
testing company in Reston, Va. Whitney Tilson, the hedge fund manager who runs
Kase Capital Management, hired HPVA to run the same tests on Ark’s products as
the lab had done on Lumber Liquidators’ products.


…It is difficult to know exactly where Ark’s laminate was sold and whether the
products are still on store shelves in the United States. Mr. Tilson has bet against the
stock of the online retailer, Wayfair, which sold the products on its website and
through Walmart.com.


While Wayfair listed some Ark products among its best-selling laminate, Jane
Carpenter, a spokeswoman for the website, said it had sold just 10 orders since
December 2014, including one order through Walmart.com. Jaeme Laczkowski, a
spokeswoman for Walmart.com, confirmed that the site had sold one order of
laminate through Wayfair before the product was removed.


…Lumber Liquidators’ stock has dropped more than 70 percent since Mr. Tilson
appeared in a March 1 episode of the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which accused
the company of selling Chinese-made laminate flooring that contained unsafe
amounts of formaldehyde.


The Consumer Product Safety Commission opened an investigation in March, and in
May, Lumber Liquidators announced that it would suspend sales of laminate
products from China.


But other companies, including Home Depot and Ark, appear to have sold laminate
from some of the same Chinese mills that supplied Lumber Liquidators, raising
questions about other products for sale in the United States.

“We all believe it’s a pervasive problem. It’s not just a Lumber Liquidators problem,”
said Denny Larson, an environmental consultant who works with plaintiffs’ lawyers.


…Shortly after “60 Minutes” broadcast its report on Lumber Liquidators, employees
at Ark were told that the company no longer sold laminate to California customers
unless it had a CARB-compliant label, three former employees said. Another former
employee, Tim Wang, who said he had worked in the sample department of Ark’s
California warehouse until July, confirmed that the company sold noncompliant
flooring outside of the state.


You may have never heard of Wayfair (NYSE:W), but it aims to be the Diapers.com or
Zappos of everything for the home – here’s the description of the company from Yahoo
Finance:


Wayfair Inc. engages in the e-commerce business in the United States. It offers
approximately seven million home products under various brands. The company’s
brands include Wayfair.com that focuses on offering home furnishings and décor
from low-to high-end and across various styles; Joss & Main, an online flash sales
site; AllModern, an online destination for original design for modern home
enthusiasts; DwellStudio, an online design studio for modern, fashion-forward home
furnishings; and Birch Lane, a destination for classic style home designs. Wayfair
Inc. also sells its products through retail partners. Wayfair Inc. was founded in 2002
and is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.


It has grown like wildfire – that’s what willingness to lose a ton of money plus buying a lot
of Google keywords will do! – and has TTM revenues of nearly $2 billion. It went public a
year ago and now has a nearly $4 billion market cap. It just reported Q3 earnings this
morning and had a conference call at 8am.


This isn’t my largest short position because I had an opinion on what Q3 earnings would
look like. Rather, it’s primarily because it has one of the worst business models I’ve ever
seen. Competing head-to-head vs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD),
Target (NYSE:TGT), Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), etc. (did I mention AMAZON???), I
think the company’s odds of ever reaching breakeven, much less earning a profit, much
less earning enough of a profit to justify a nearly $4 billion market cap are close to zero.
(Operating income over the last four quarters was -$137 million, 71% higher than the -$80
million in the four quarters before that. The company has $399 million of cash and long-
term investments and no debt.)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3670336-wayfair-largest-short-position 4/14


In addition, this business is so poorly managed and/or spread so thin that they were
selling Chinese-made laminate long after everyone in the flooring industry knew (thanks to
60 Minutes) that there were big issues – and potential liabilities – associated with this
product so extreme caution was called for.


Just as I did with Lumber Liquidators, I hired a testing company to purchase and test five
samples of Ark laminate flooring from Wayfair’s web site. All five failed the California Air
Resources Board (CARB2) limit in spectacular fashion (by a factor of 2-5x). In fact, the
test results were very similar to those for the three samples of Lumber Liquidators
Chinese-made laminate that I had tested more than a year ago.


To be clear, however, I am not claiming that Wayfair is Lumber Liquidators Part 2. Lumber
Liquidators was selling ~$140 million annually of Chinese-made laminate flooring before
the scandal, whereas Wayfair claims to have “sold just 10 orders since December 2014,
including one order through Walmart.com.” Also, Wayfair was smart enough to
immediately pull the product once the Times reporter called and made them aware of the
potential problem. So the possible liabilities here are much lower – and, I suspect, there
was no intent to harm. Unlike Lumber Liquidators, I don’t think Wayfair was deliberately
poisoning its own customers to save a few bucks on sourcing costs.


Rather, to me it is compelling evidence of Wayfair’s gross incompetence and/or a business
that’s completely out of control. While the company was founded in 2002, it was only
rebranded and started pursuing extreme growth in 2011. They are now selling “seven
million home products” sourced from over 7,000 suppliers, and grew revenues 77% last
quarter – talk about growth run amok! I’ve seen this story so many times by companies
trying to justify their insane share prices. It’s a curse because it almost always ends in
tears…


Take a look at zulily for one good example that I shorted successfully. The company IPO’d
in late 2013, with the stock trading in the mid-$30s. It then briefly soared to over $70
before reality set in and the stock crashed to under $12 before investors got bailed out
(sort of) when Liberty Interactive (QVCA) bought zulily for $17.40.


One of my readers wrote to me with another analogy: “I think Wayfair is Overstock.com
2.0. It seems like the exact same business model.”


I replied: “I agree – and that has very sobering implications for Wayfair’s stock, as
Overstock, which I think is roughly fairly valued, trades at an EV/Sales multiple of 0.20x
whereas Wayfair’s is 2.05x, implying 90% downside for Wayfair’s stock…"

I predict that Wayfair’s stock will be below $10 within a year (it closed yesterday at
$45.84).


I will have lots more to say when I present this idea at the Robin Hood Investors

Thanks for including our article on Wayfair. Since we wrote it I have noticed that Amazon has discovered online
"merchandising" for clothing and I expect they will roll that out for home furnishings as well.


I've read several reports in the last two months, some making the bull case but no matter which side I take I don't
believe there is any chance they will reach their target model of 10% EBITDA margins. In the best case scenario it's
4-5%.

In terms of morality, I think it is wrong for a company to earn money by manipulating the government. In this sense I
think it is morally wrong for a short seller to use government regulations to get a company in trouble like what
happened with Lumber Liquidators.

Alex, I'll not discuss what Tilson, Chanos, Ackman, or Citron do is right or wrong. But, if you have a poisonous

Do you believe what the FDA, EPA, and other regulatory agencies do is worthless? In other words, do we as
consumers should have protection at all in your opinion?And, company doing us wrong shouldn't be
punished?

Not getting the logic thought in this one Alex.


In the end, short sellers provide an integral part in markets. I'd much rather have a short seller make a profit
revealing a company that slipped a product through regulations that may harm consumers.

So there are regulations to protect consumers/investors. A company violates them and is exposed by a short

Courage & Conviction Investing, Marketplace Contributor
Mr. Tilson - This article is sensational and highly self interested. You are not using your logical and ability to outsmart
the market. Instead, you are trying to use scare tactics. It is one thing to write a cogent piece why Wayfair's business
model will fail and they you don't think they can generate free cash flow due to competition. However, it is very
different to write nonsense headlines like this one. It will be fun to watch, especially if Wayfair experiences a short
squeeze.


"The New York Times revealed that Wayfair was, until very recently, likely selling toxic, formaldehyde-drenched
Chinese-made laminate flooring to at least a handful of customers."


Here is the CFO's (Michael Fleischer) responses in the Q&A section of the call. He is directly addressing your article
and the NYT piece.


Yes, sure, Neely. Yes, thanks for the question. We carry a big selection, as you know, 7 million items, and I think some
of the other folks mentioned Walmart, Home Depot, these are all folks who carry a big assortment of items, along with
Amazon. So our approach is actually to be very thorough in worrying about the safety the products we sell. In order to
do that, we do a few things. One is all our suppliers, we have supplier agreements with them, we have indemnification
agreements with them, we have certificates of insurance from them, we have detailed product information which
specifies down to the various regulatory bodies whether they be local, state or federal, what pieces they comply with,
or if items don’t comply, so that we can take the appropriate steps in terms of whether we offer them or not. And that’s
how we are able to make sure that the products are of high quality, and meet all the guidelines.

The other thing we do though, that not many people do, is that we do not source items directly from the factories that
they are made overseas. So we are sourcing from folks who are the distributors and the actual product designers,
who are generally American and European companies who are then sourcing in Asia. So we have an additional layer
of QA, QC that a lot of the other retailers who are directly sourcing may not have, except through their own QC
personnel, who would be on site. And so that’s our approach, it’s been pretty thorough, it’s worked quite well.


In terms of that article, that refers to laminate wood flooring, and that’s a category that’s been featured prominently in
the press because of Lumber Liquidators, who I think had a fairly extensive problem of their own sourced product.
And for us it’s important to know, laminate flooring’s a really small category, so laminate flooring, it’s 0.2% of our
sales, so that’s 2/100 of a percent of our sales, which is about – the number have is just under $400,000 year to date
in that whole category.


A lot of that product comes from large producers like Armstrong and Mohawk, and so Ark, for example, which the
brand that article mentioned, we have had 10 orders from Ark in total in total for this type of product, and similar to
what we always do, we made sure that the product complied, and then there’s a point in time where the manufacturer
actually told us that they were discontinuing the product, so actually pulled it at that point, which was even before the
New York Times got interested in the product.


So we would like to be very thorough there, and that process which we set up and honed over the years, we think has
worked very well, had millions and millions of orders, and we’ve been able to really avoid problems.

You wrote 3 paragraphs on a subject that Tilson said he's not short because of it, the laminate wood!

Trader - are you short Wayfair. I read Tilson's lightweight article. It is so sensational.


To have a $10 price target, I want to see 10 pages of excruciating detail defending his outlandish call.

@Courage, "This article....is highly self interested". Oh the travesty! I'm certain your (somewhat pointless, in
my opinion) long reply a few comments above is totally...not self interested? Just like the CFO you quote too?
Ha if you're investing I'd love to know where I can line up on the other side of you.


Who cares about the wood material. Presumably you've done more than a flash of work on this company and
hence know the short thesis (or the long thesis, I presume) isn't anything about Wayfair selling flooring or
tainted products. So Tilson uses some hyperbole and tries to get people riled up. Use it as a buying
opportunity if you're long and have "Conviction & Courage" which I presume you must have lots of.

No, I'm in the sidelines until Monday. Tilson will have a conference on Monday. You just need to read the last
2 years of financials and the 2015 quarters on yahoo finance to understand the business model. The
company hasn't generated FCF for the past 3 years.


I'm finance guy, and worked 4 years for an $AMZN subsidiary company. I can ascertain my ecommerce
knowledge. It's true that $AMZN may only be profitable on the AWS business, but it's profitable when the
"street" requires. The question is can $W do the same? So far, the answer has been a resounding no!


Any company with suppliers, credit lines, and marketing can grow sales on ecommerce, the tricky thing is
achieving long term profitability and FCF generation.

Folks, the question is not whether W can make a profit, they can. The question is one of valuation. W is simply
imitating AMZN. AMZN proved that a high growth Internet retailer can get away with losing a small amount of money if
the growth is there. When the Street starts to question that model, AMZN shows a profit. W can show a profit anytime
they want to. Advertising is a whopping 12% of revenues. This high advertising is leading to 75% revenue growth. The
company increased its advertising the result was increased sales growth. The Street until recently was TELLING them
to pour on the advertising. If they cut advertising by 25%, they are profitable, and still probably growing over 35%.

Just a few reasons I think Wayfair can compete with Amazon: As an interior designer sourcing a lot of home
furnishings, I appreciate their superior, curated website and search capabilities-clean, fast, intuitive, and in short order,
I can get to exactly what I'm looking for, at any price point I need. Amazon's website, in contrast, is busy and clunky; I
get stressed using it, although I do buy from them, as well. But now I go to Wayfair first, and I notice many of my
clients do, as well. Excellent pricing and customer service, as well as free shipping, have made this my go-to online
home furnishings website.


Wayfair is also a great equalizer--many of the companies they represent used to only sell through interior designers;
there haven't been many great retail options for homeowners to directly buy everything they need to furnish their
homes. The popularity of HGTV has created a very sophisticated buyer who has the confidence to do their own
decorating. With the housing/economic recovery, there is a lot of pent up demand for new and replacement
furnishings. I see it with my clients-they are willing to spend again, but they want a good deal. Wayfair is dead-center
in that sweet spot. This is why I think the company has a great future.


That said, I am watching and waiting-haven't pulled the trigger, as I do like profitability.

On the point of cashflow I notice the huge contribution from accounts payable. I could be wrong but this could unwind

Good observation. Their FCF still suck at -$64.5M for the 9 months, imagine without the AP gimmick! 
Also, I just realized they have a 25% AR allowance, that's crazy for an internet based business.

Ten orders of flooring... Since 2014. This article lost credibility for me right then and there. The liability associated with
those 10 floors is less than a rounding error. 
It's irresponsible to even include that gnat's eyelash as part of the methodological critique of the business model.

I think you didn't read the whole article!


Anyways, $-65M in FCF in 9 months make a lot of sense, doesn't it?

WhitneyB - Exactly - it is shameful for Mr. Tilson to write this nonsense. I have lost all respect for him. Also, there are
WAY, WAY, WAY better investors than him.

Courage & Conviction: What are your thoughts on Universal Property? I would think that Mr. Tilson's
comments on that issue would be of more interest to everyone. It affects the entire State of Florida (not just
the 500,000 policyholders of UVE) and could effectively undermine the entire Florida insurance and mortgage
market. UVE is the largest insurer in Florida (other than state-run Citizens) and the stock is getting
slaughtered. If it loses its Demotech rating (which was labeled as a joke of a company), UVE could no longer
write policies for virtually any conventionally mortgaged house. As a citizen of the State, I would like to see
Mr. Tilson let his position be known regarding the unintended (or intended) consequences on Demotech's
credibility. Surely, with his writings on the mortgage crisis, this issue is not lost on him.

InsProf - I'm not sure how comparing a poorly capitalized insurance company that writes hurricane insurance
has anything to do with Wayfair.


Wayfair has three very smart private equity backers, and some really smart buy side investors long the name.
Mr. Tilson is on a fishing exhibition that, I believe, will end badly.


Evidently, the CEO of UVE has a criminal history to boot.

I use my own trade ideas! And, I completely forgot you don't have a position on W!Great call on $FIT!


BTW, if you care to read my "stock talks', you'll see all my trades, good or bad, and comments on other
people's trades. My objective is to increase my trading account, and make a few friends in the process. I have
30 years of finance experience from credit manager to CFO. I tend to read f/s and calls transcripts with a big
pinch of salt... 
Now, if I see a good bed time story like $RST restructuring now, I do make good comments. That's all!

Gotta like the business model of a retailer that keeps almost no inventory. Yet payables are six times inventory. They
also have much less warehouse space, than AMZN which has tons of warehouses, despite selling a product that
takes up lots of space. They have no loans because of how low the inventory is.

That demonstrates good working capital management. High utilization of drop ship. However, long term, the
company will have to have more of "less bulky items" on stock to grow. No ecommerce retailer can grow
without inventory on hands. Also, $W will have to have multiple warehouse centers like $AMZN.


$AMZN does drop ship for bulk and other business segments. Also, the 3rd party business at $AMZN is very
profitable, high inventory without any cost to the company. $AMZN also keeps inventory for 3rd party
business making it a profit center for logistics too.


Now, 3 full years of negative FCF and the 9 months of 2015, weight a lot on their valuation, and business
model in general.

I bought 5 $W Nov 20, 15 $35 puts @1.40 today. I may increase my position with other expiration dates to decrease
the risk. But, This is make it or break it after Tilson's conference today! I'm looking to unload the position tomorrow.
