Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix
Dec. 16, 2010 4:13 PM ET286 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Background


We've lost a lot of money betting against Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which is currently our
largest bearish bet, in the form of both a short and put position. In this letter, we share our
investment thesis in depth and describe why, at a stock price of $178.50 and a market cap
of $9.3 billion (based on yesterday's close), we think it's an exceptional short idea.


Given the natural inclination to talk about winners and quietly sweep losers under the rug,
one might ask why we are writing about one of our worst investments. We have three
main reasons for doing so: First, we think it's healthy to disclose and fully analyze our
mistakes (although in this case we are not yet conceding that we've made a mistake in our
analysis, but we obviously made a mistake in terms of timing our entry into the position).
Second, it's a useful exercise for us - it helps clarify our own thinking - to put in writing our
investment thesis, especially on complex and controversial positions (for example, on
June 11th we published our 10-page analysis of why we were buying BP's stock amidst
the panic at that time (it was then at $33.97 and closed yesterday at $43.86)). Third, we've
found that when we publish our research, we often get valuable feedback. If there's
information or analyses that would cause us to change our views, we want to hear about
it!


And, no, contrary to what message board bulls will surely claim, we're not publishing our
research in an attempt to salvage a bad investment by driving the share price down so we
can exit at a better price. We are value investors, not traders, harbor no illusions about our
ability to move markets, and our total capital committed to Netflix would not even place it
among our top 12 long positions.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 2/98


Since we rarely buy a stock at the very bottom or short one at the very top, having a
position move against us, at least initially, is a common occurrence. When this happens,
we re-evaluate our analysis and investment thesis and make one of three decisions: add
to the position, do nothing, or exit. Making the right decision here is critical - it's often more
important than the initial investment decision - and there's no easy answer or rule of
thumb. (In our experience, we'd guess that we add to a position 40% of the time, do
nothing 40% of the time, and exit 20% the time.)


It's often a hard decision, both for fundamental and emotional reasons. Regarding the
former, the fact that a stock's price has become more attractive doesn't necessarily mean
it's a better investment. A stock typically moves because something has happened to the
company, industry or world, so the change in the fundamentals must be weighed against
the change in the share price.


The emotional side can be even more difficult. Numerous studies of investor behavior (the
field is called behavioral finance) show that once an investor has a position in a stock,
there are tremendous biases to seek confirming information, ignore disconfirming
information, and not admit a mistake. We don't claim to be immune from these emotions,
but we've studied them extensively and do our best to block them out. One of the simplest
techniques we use is to ask ourselves: If our portfolio was 100% cash and we were
investing from scratch, would we establish this position and, if so, how big would it be?


In the case of Netflix, the answer is that we'd have exactly the position we do today. In
other words, we're not short it in a desperate and irrational attempt to try to make back
what we've lost. The price at which we initially shorted Netflix, the amount of our losses to
date, and whether we will ever make back these losses are completely irrelevant to our
decision to hold the position today (this is true, incidentally, of every position we hold).


Overview of Netflix


Our favorite shorts generally involve some or all of the following characteristics: outright
frauds (our very favorite), industries in decline or facing major headwinds, lousy or faddish
business models, bad balance sheets, and incompetent, excessively promotional and/or
crooked management. In general, we prefer to short businesses with these traits, even
when their stocks trade at seemingly low valuation multiples, rather than shorting the
stocks of good businesses with strong managements, even at high valuations.
Sometimes, however, the valuations become so extreme that we will short the latter, but
generally only when we believe there is a catalyst that will impact the company and cause
the stock to fall.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 3/98


Netflix falls into this latter category. We acknowledge that the company offers a useful,
attractively-priced service to customers, is growing like wildfire, is very well managed, and
has a strong balance sheet. So why on earth would we be betting against this stock? In
short, because we think the valuation is extreme and that the rapid shift of its customers to
streaming content (vs. mailing DVDs to customers) isn't the beginning of an exciting,
highly-profitable new world for Netflix, but rather the beginning of the end of its incredible
run. In particular, we think margins will be severely compressed and growth will slow over
the next year.


Valuation


By any measure, Netflix's valuation is extremely rich. Based on yesterday's closing price,
it trades at 67.4x trailing EPS ($2.65), 63.1x the high end of the company's EPS guidance
for the full year 2010 ($2.83), and 46.7x consensus analysts' estimates for 2011 ($3.82). It
also trades at 4.6x sales. In short, the stock is priced for perfection, and any misstep
would likely trigger a huge selloff.


But the company hasn't had many missteps, so what's the catalyst? To answer this
question, one must understand how Netflix's business model is changing and the resulting
implications.


Core Business Model


Netflix's core business model is buying DVDs and then renting them to its customers, who
pay a fixed monthly fee for unlimited rentals delivered by mail plus unlimited streaming
(the fee varies by how many DVDs can be out simultaneously; currently it's $9.99/month
for one DVD, up to $55.99/month for eight DVDs; there's also a bare-bones two-
rentals/month plan for $4.99 and a streaming-only plan for $7.99 monthly).


This is a good business for two reasons: 1) Netflix has a better business model and better
management than its bricks-and-mortar competitors such as Blockbuster (OTC:BLOAQ)
and Movie Gallery, both of which filed for bankruptcy this year (the former continues to
operate as it tries to restructure, while the latter has been liquidated); and 2) Netflix only
has to pay once for the DVDs it rents over and over again to its customers thanks to
what's called the First Sale Doctrine, which allows anyone who buys a DVD to sell,
exchange, rent, or lend it to others, without paying the content owner.


New Business Model



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLOAQ

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 4/98


Netflix's core DVD-based business model is rapidly shrinking as customers shift rapidly to
streaming content. Netflix has moved quickly to adapt, making its streaming service
available over the internet to customers' computers as well as through various devices like
iPads and iPhones (NASDAQ:AAPL), TiVos (NASDAQ:TIVO), game consoles
(PlayStation3 (NYSE:SNE), Xbox 360 (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Wii (OTCPK:NTDOY)),
streaming players (Apple TV, Roku), and certain internet-enabled televisions and home
theater systems.


Netflix's customers have responded by rapidly switching: in its most recent quarter (Q3),
the company said that 66% of its subscribers watched instantly more than 15 minutes of a
TV episode or movie compared to 41% for the same period of 2009, and 61% for the
second quarter of 2010. In Q4, a majority of Netflix subscribers will watch more content
streamed from Netflix than delivered on DVD.


So many of Netflix's 16.9 million customers are streaming videos, in fact, that they account
for 20% of all internet traffic during a typical evening, according to Sandvine, which makes
network-monitoring equipment. (We find this number hard to believe, but anything close to
it is still very substantial.)


With streaming, Netflix obviously doesn't have to buy DVDs or incur the cost of mailing
them to and from its customers, so why don't we share the market's enthusiasm for
Netflix's shift from an Old Economy company to a New Economy one? In short, our
answer is that we believe that the same two factors that made Netflix a good business
under its original business model don't apply under its streaming model.


New Competitors


We don't believe that Netflix has a better business model, better management or a
meaningful competitive advantage in the business of streaming movies and TV shows. It
does have a brand name and 16.9 million customers, but Netflix's brand and number of
customers pale in comparison to its new, direct competitors like Apple (iTunes), Google
(NASDAQ:GOOG) (YouTube), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) (Amazon Video on
Demand), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS) (part ownership of Hulu),
Time Warner (TWX, TWC) (cable, HBO, etc.), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (cable, NBC
Universal, part ownership of Hulu), and Coinstar's Redbox (NASDAQ:CSTR) (30,000
kiosks renting DVDs for $1/night and email addresses for 21 million customers).


In short, Netflix is moving from a business in which it was competing against smaller,
dying, heavily-indebted companies with inferior business models to some of the largest,
most powerful, aggressive and deep-pocketed companies in the world, which have big

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 5/98


competitive advantages over Netflix.


We can't predict the outcome of the fierce competition that is emerging, but we believe it is
quite likely that it will result in slower growth and a contraction in Netflix's mouth-watering
margins (last quarter, Netflix had a 12.6% operating margin and 6.9% net margin).


When asked on last quarter's conference call whether competition would impact Netflix's
margins, CEO Reed Hastings replied: "You tell me what happens with competition, and I'll
tell you what happens to margins."


Paying for Streaming Content


The biggest impact on margins, we believe, will come from Netflix having to pay
increasing amounts for streaming content. Unlike renting DVDs, in which Netflix is
protected by the First Sale Doctrine (for now, anyway - see discussion below), the laws
around streaming content require that Netflix must have an agreement with the content
owner to stream it. This is very bad news for Netflix because content owners are generally
very savvy and are seeking to carefully control their content to maximize revenues.
According to numerous recent articles, content owners are also very fearful of Netflix:


1) Here's an excerpt from a recent article in the NY Times entitled "Time Warner Views
Netflix as a Fading Star":



http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13bewkes.html
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 6/98


For the past year, executives at big media companies have watched Netflix with
growing resentment - for its success in delivering movies and television shows via
the Internet, for its stock price nearly quadrupling, for its chief executive being
named businessperson of the year by Fortune magazine.


Now many of the companies that make the shows and movies that Netflix delivers to
mailboxes, computer screens and televisions - companies whose stocks have not
enjoyed the same frothy rise, and whose chief executives have not won the same
accolades - are pushing back, arguing that the company is overhyped, and vowing
to charge much more to license their content.


"It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world?" said Jeffrey L.
Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, in an interview last week. "I don't think
so."


Netflix has been a business partner to the movie and television studios through
licensing deals, but increasingly it is seen as a partner with its hands far deeper in
the pockets of the media companies than anyone thought. Through its success, the
company has positioned itself at the center of the media universe - at the nexus of
technology and content - and is now finding it a place increasingly under attack.


... Mr. Bewkes explained that in the late 1990s the media industry embraced Netflix
as a new distribution outlet for renting DVDs - without foreseeing that the company
would eventually accelerate the decline in the sales of DVDs, which for years had
been the lifeblood of the film industry. Now, with its success online, Netflix has raised
fears that consumers may stop paying for cable television - the much-debated
phenomenon of cord-cutting.


Mr. Nathanson agreed, saying, "The first engagement the industry had with Netflix
was innocent. DVDs were selling, and it didn't seem like much of a problem."


Now, however, Netflix is increasingly seen as potentially a very big problem.


"In the past six months, and because of concerns of Wall Street and concerns of
cord-cutting, it's influencing the investor conversations about the future of media,"
Mr. Nathanson said. "Now, the industry is very focused on Netflix, and what they can
do."


A media conference last week in New York held by the investment bank UBS
became a platform for executives to express their grievances and emphasize that
they will now aggressively try to tilt the economic balance between Netflix and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 7/98


content creators back toward the media conglomerates.


"When Netflix first came around, the dog was the discs and the baggie," said Robert
S. Wiesenthal, executive vice president and chief financial officer at the Sony
Corporation of America, referring to the envelopes the discs are mailed in, "and the
streaming was the tail." But very quickly, he added, that situation was reversed. "And
now the economics for the content companies are going to reflect that."


2) Here are excerpts from a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled, "Netflix Rattles
Rivals as It Expands on Web: Pay-TV Services, Others Plot Moves to Counter Movie
Juggernaut; Hollywood Cautiously Cuts Deals":


After years as a bit player in entertainment, Netflix Inc. is being eyed for a new role
by Hollywood: industry hulk.


The Silicon Valley company has successfully expanded its mail-order DVD rental
service to delivering video online. Meantime, the rise of Internet-connected TVs and
disc players means that Netflix's electronically streamed movies and TV shows are
reaching living rooms, not just computers.


All that poses a potential threat to the traditional ways consumers watch movies and
TV: through cable, phone and satellite systems.


…Netflix's growth surge-at a time of weak DVD sales and increasingly fragmented
TV audiences-prompts concern among movie and TV studios as well as other
technology companies. One big worry is that the company could end up dominating
the electronic distribution of movies and TV the way Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store
dominates music.


To prevent that, entertainment and technology companies are exploring plans to
outflank Netflix with their own offerings.


3) Finally, here are excerpts from a recent New York Times article entitled, "Netflix's Move
Onto the Web Stirs Rivalries":

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 8/98


In a matter of months, the movie delivery company Netflix has gone from being the
fastest-growing first-class mail customer of the United States Postal Service to the
biggest source of streaming Web traffic in North America during peak evening hours.


That transformation - from a mail-order business to a technology company - is
revolutionizing the way millions of people watch television, but it's also proving to be
a big headache for TV providers and movie studios, which increasingly see Netflix
as a competitive threat, even as they sell Netflix their content.


... "Right now, Netflix is a distribution platform, and has very little competition, but
that's changing," said Warren N. Lieberfarb, a consultant who played a critical role in
creating the DVD while at Warner Brothers.


... "How did Hollywood end up supplying Netflix in the first place, particularly a
product that was given to them on a flat-rate, wholesale basis?" said Jonathan A.
Knee, a media investment banker and co-author of "The Curse of the Mogul."


... Netflix is increasingly viewed as a threat by cable companies and movie studios,
who are considering a variety of ways to put the brakes on the company's growth.


"Though already a significant customer, they've grown faster than anyone
anticipated, and going forward we expect the economics to improve significantly,"
said John Calkins, executive vice president of digital and commercial innovation at
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.


For example, big media companies like Time Warner are moving quickly to offer their
own streaming products. Studios have pushed back on release dates, requiring
Netflix to wait through a window of 28 days while studios pushed more expensive
and lucrative sales of the DVD and on-demand versions on cable.  
And the studios are positioning themselves to demand more money in future
negotiations over streaming rights, especially next year when Netflix's deal with
Starz expires.


4) A final data point: We were recently at a lunch at which Jeff Zucker, the outgoing CEO
of NBC Universal, was asked about licensing NBC's content to Netflix. His reply: "We'd be
happy to - for a lot of money!"


Weak Streaming Content Today


Before we address how much Netflix might have to pay to build its library of streaming
content, it's important to understand how weak its current library is.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 9/98


Movie Content


The bulk of Netflix's current movie content is from two deals: one struck in 2008 with Starz
and one this August with Epix, which is owned by three studios, Paramount Pictures
(NYSE:VIA), Lions Gate (LGF) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.


Despite these two deals, Netflix has very weak content. How weak? To answer this
question, we compared streaming movie titles available on Netflix (at a fixed price per
month for unlimited viewing) vs. what one can buy a la carte (generally from
$1.99-$4.99/movie) on Apple's iTunes, Amazon On Demand, Vudu, and Time Warner
Cable's video on demand (including HBO and Cinemax on demand). To come up with a
representative list of popular movies, we took the top 50 grossing movies of all time,
Internet Movie Database's 20 top-ranked movies of all time, Rotten Tomatoes's 20 top-
ranked movies of all time, and the 10 top-selling, top-renting and top-video-on-demand
DVDs for the week ending 11/28/10.


Here's the summary: of these 120 movies (including duplicates), Netflix has a mere 17
(14.2%, and 0% of the current most popular movies) vs. 77 for iTunes (64.2%), 63 for
Vudu, 62 for Amazon, and 41 for cable. This chart depicts the results graphically:


Television Content


For television, we did a similar comparison, looking at what Netflix offers via streaming vs.
competitors' offerings (Netflix and Hulu charge a flat rate, whereas the others typically
charge $1 per episode).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 10/98


We took TV Guide's list of the 100 most popular TV shows. This chart depicts the results
graphically:


Netflix's Dilemma


Why is Netflix's streaming content so weak? The primary reason is that, unlike its
competitors, Netflix isn't willing to pay what content providers demand for the best movies
and TV shows. For example, Netflix's competitors typically charge $4.99 to stream a
popular movie, of which $3 goes to the content provider, and the economics are similar for
the $1 TV shows.


But this model doesn't work for Netflix because it's only charging $7.99 per month for
unlimited streaming. Given that content providers aren't about to slash their prices, Netflix
has three choices, all of them unpleasant:


1. It can have a weak library and maintain low prices, or
2. It can license better content and pass the cost along to its customers, which would


crimp growth, or
3. It can license better content and eat the cost, which would hurt margins.


None of these options are consistent with a stock trading at nearly 70x earnings.


(Incidentally, in light of Netflix's weak content, we were initially puzzled by the fact that its
customers appear to be using streaming quite a bit, but here's what we suspect is
happening: many customers have recently switched to streaming and, as new users,
they're finding a handful of movies and TV shows they want to watch (hence the high

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 11/98


initial usage). But given how thin the content is, they are likely to quickly become
discouraged and stop using the streaming service. This will put a lot of pressure on Netflix
to strike licensing deals for more content.)


Streaming Content Deals


Netflix clearly understands the dilemma it faces and, in light of recent deals, appears to be
choosing option 3, which will deliver better value to its customers over time, but will
severely crimp margins. To get an idea of how much, let's look at Netflix's primary
streaming content deals.


Starz


The first major deal, signed in October 2008, was with Starz, giving Netflix access to
approximately 2,500 Disney and Sony movies for a mere $25-$30 million annually, a small
fraction of what Starz originally paid the studios and what Starz charges TV operators.
Under the current contract, Netflix is paying Starz less than $0.15 per subscriber per
month for its content vs. the $2-4 per subscriber per month that TV operators typically pay
Starz.


Here's is what some industry players are saying about the Starz deal:


1) From a recent article in the NY Times:



http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13bewkes.html
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 12/98


The relationship between Netflix and the media companies will most likely change
drastically, beginning next year when a deal between the company and Starz, the
pay-TV channel, to stream movies from Sony and Disney expires.


The original deal from 2008, in which Netflix paid an estimated $25 million annually -
a paltry sum, executives say, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars cable
and satellite companies pay Starz for the same movies - is now seen as a major
coup for Netflix, and a major mistake by Starz.


Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Nomura, called it "probably one of the
dumbest deals ever. Starz gave up valuable content for tens of millions of dollars."


Mr. Bewkes said that deal, which gave Netflix significant momentum into the new
world of online video, potentially undermined the business model of cable television,
based on the subscription fees that have steadily flowed even as other media
businesses have suffered in the digital age. "Why should anyone subscribe to Starz
when they can basically get the whole thing for about nothing?" he said. "That
doesn't make much sense."


2) From a recent Reuters article:


"The deal Starz did to give those movies away for $30 million obviously makes no
sense. There's a day coming shortly when that deal expires. How do Starz and
Netflix address the next deal?" News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said
this week at the Reuters Global Media Summit.


... Pay TV operators, which spend heavily on studio fees, are also pressuring studios
that offer cut rates for distribution on Netflix.


"Their deal with Netflix absolutely does affect our relationship," said an executive of
one of Starz's largest pay TV partners, who asked not to be named because the
source was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.


"You can't sell your product to one distributor for pennies on the dollar and then
expect other distributors to pay you dollars for your product."


This was an extremely attractive deal for Netflix - so much so that one must wonder what
Starz could have been thinking. We assume that Starz didn't see Netflix as a potential
competitor at the time - Netflix was much smaller and did very little streaming - and viewed



http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B060E20101201
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 13/98


the $25-30 million as found money. Also, Starz was taking advantage of a loophole in its
contract with Disney and Sony, neither of which anticipated that Starz would re-license
their content.


All of these factors that led to Netflix getting a sweetheart deal are now gone - Starz,
Disney and Sony have woken up to the value of their content and the threat that Netflix
poses - so Netflix will either have to pay up or lose the Starz content when the contract
expires in 10 months. Negotiations are underway, and Netflix (of course) says that it
doesn't need the Starz content. But we think it does - and will have to pay many multiples
of the current licensing fees. We see no reason why Netflix won't have to pay Starz at
least the $200 million annually that it's paying Epix.


Epix


In August, Netflix signed a deal to stream content from Epix, which is owned by three
studios, Paramount Pictures, Lions Gate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The exact terms of
the deal haven't been disclosed, but numerous reports say it's for up to $1 billion over five
years.


Importantly, Netflix won't be able to stream Epix's movies until 90 days after they have
reached Epix's distribution window, which is typically 6-12 months after a movie is first
available on premium movie channels, so this deal won't address Netflix's problem that it
offers no current releases.


Disney


Just last week, Netflix signed a one-year deal with Disney that allows Netflix to stream
episodes from previous seasons of various ABC shows, plus the final season of the hit
show Lost, plus current season programs from ABC Family and Disney Channel, with a
15-day delay. It's important to note that the deal does not give Netflix the right to ABC's
current season, which will continue to be available only on Hulu, which is co-owned by
Disney.


So how much did Netflix pay for Disney's second-tier content? According to an LA Times
article, a whopping $150-200 million.


Let's sum up the cost of these three deals:


Let's assume the Starz deal is renewed for somewhere between $150-$250 million -
that's an incremental $120-225 million per year.



http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/homeentertainment/la-fi-ct-netflix-abc-20101209,0,4912714.story
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 14/98


The Epix deal is reported to be "as much as" $1 billion, which is $200 million per year,
but it might be back-end-loaded (based, perhaps, on Netflix's subscribers and/or
usage), so let's assume $150-200 million in the first couple of years.
Finally, the Disney deal is reported to be $150-$200 million.


Add it all up and it's an additional cost of $420-625 million per year - a staggering amount,
especially in light of the fact that, even with these three deals, Netflix's streaming content
remains weak.


Postage and Fulfillment Savings


Ah, but what about the savings on postage and fulfillment costs due to fewer subscribers
having DVDs mailed to them? In Netflix's latest 10-Q (page 21), it disclosed that there was
"a 24% decline in monthly DVD rentals per average paying subscriber attributed to the
growing popularity of our lower priced plans and growth in streaming." This decline
translates into big savings - but not nearly enough to offset the additional costs of
streaming content according to our estimates.


Here's our math:


Netflix breaks down its cost of revenues into two categories:


1) Cost of Subscription, which consists of: a) "content delivery costs related to shipping
DVDs"; b) "providing streaming content to subscribers"; and c) "expenses related to the
acquisition and licensing of content"; and


2) Fulfillment expenses, which consist of: a) "content processing including operating and
staffing our shipping centers"; b) "receiving, encoding, inspecting and warehousing our
content library"; and c) "operating and staffing our customer service centers and credit
card fees."


The costs that are most impacted by the 24% decline in DVD rentals are 1a) ("content
delivery costs related to shipping DVDs") plus all fulfillment expenses. Netflix doesn't
disclose a breakdown of 1a), 1b) and 1c), but the latter two are amortized and, as such,
appear in the cash flow statement under "Amortization of content library." By subtracting
this, we can get a rough estimate of 1a) and then add fulfillment expenses.


Then, we can calculate this cost on a per-subscriber basis and see how much it's declined
over the past year. The answer: 15%, as shown in this table:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 15/98


A 15% drop in costs on a 24% decline in usage makes sense to us, as some costs like
postage will be purely variable and decline in direct proportion to the decline in DVDs
mailed, but other costs are fixed or semi-variable.


As one can see in the table, cost of revenues net of amortization of content library was
$977 million over the past year, but we don't want to apply the 15% savings to this amount
since we're looking forward, so let's assume that Netflix grows 30% next year (last quarter,
revenues were up 30.7%) such that $977 million grows to $1.27 billion. Applying the 15%
results in savings of $191 million. This is merely an informed estimate, of course, so let's
use a range of $150-250 million in savings.


Impact on Margins


If we apply $150-250 million of savings to the range of incremental costs for streaming
content ($420-625 million per year, discussed above), it results in Netflix's costs rising by
$170-475 million per year, or $42-119 million per quarter.


That's a very wide range, but even the low end, $42 million, is 64% of Netflix's $65.4
million of pre-tax profit last quarter, and the mid-point, $80.5 million, would more than wipe
out all of Netflix's Q3 profit.


But this is a forward-looking estimate, based in part on a higher amount we expect that
Netflix will have to pay Starz, so let's use the $90 million of pre-tax profits per quarter that
analysts are projecting for 2011. In this case, even the low end of our incremental cost
estimate cuts Netflix's pre-tax profits nearly in half, and the mid-point cuts profits by 90%.


Our belief that the increased costs of streaming content will negatively impact Netflix's
margins isn't just a theory. Last quarter, strong evidence emerged to support our view: in
Q3, Netflix's operating margin was 12.6% and net margin was 6.9%, down from 14.9%
and 8.4%, respectively, in Q2. That's a huge decline in only three months. The result was
a 12.5% sequential decline in earnings from $0.80 in Q2 to $0.70 in Q3. Again, this is not
consistent with a stock trading at nearly 70x earnings.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 16/98


An In-Depth Analysis of the Cash Flow Statement - and the Likely
Impact on Margins


The real cash cost of Netflix's streaming deals can be seen in its Q3 cash flow statement:
"Acquisition of streaming content library" was a cash outflow of $115.1 million, up 74.1%
from the previous quarter's $66.2 million and up 11.5x year-over-year (from $10 million).


However, this enormous increase in cash paid to bolster its streaming library didn't result
in the increase in "Amortization of content library" (which also includes DVD content) that
we would have expected: this was $77.1 million in Q3, up a mere 16.6% from the previous
quarter's $65.1 million and 36.1% year over year (from $56.7 million).


This chart shows certain key elements of Netflix's cash flow statement each quarter going
back to the beginning of 2007:


The two columns show how much Netflix is spending in cash to purchase streaming
content (the blue bar) and DVDs (the white bar). The total of these two is the red line.
Finally, the amount Netflix is amortizing for this content (which appears as an expense on
the income statement) is the purple dashed line.


Note that from Q1 2007 through Q3 2009, the two lines parallel each other closely, which
makes sense: the amount Netflix spends to acquire content should be amortized over
time. (In fact, over these 11 quarters, the amount amortized is 91% of the total amount
spent acquiring content - again, what one would expect, given that amortization should lag
cash outlays in a rapidly growing business.)



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2010/12/16/saupload_tilson_4.jpg
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 17/98


However, starting in Q4 2009, the lines diverge sharply, as Netflix began paying large
amounts for streaming content (represented by the blue bars skyrocketing), which more
than offset the decline in amounts spent buying DVDs (represented by the white bars
shrinking). In total, acquisition costs rose 159% over the past year (from $56 million to
$145 million), yet, strangely, amortization of content library rose only 35% (from $57
million to $77 million).


If we apply the 91% average ratio between amortization and cash outlays from Q1 2007 -
Q3 2009 to the Q3 2010 cash outlays of $145 million, then amortization would have been
$132 million, $55 million more than the $77 million Netflix actually amortized. (To put this
$55 million in perspective, recall that Netflix's pre-tax profit in Q3 was $65.4 million.)


To be clear, we don't believe that Netflix is committing accounting fraud. The rules
governing how intangible assets are amortized are complex and rely on various
assumptions, so there can be a lag between when cash is actually paid out and when the
amortization expense is recognized and appears on the income statement. But eventually
we expect that these large streaming costs will be amortized and therefore appear as an
expense on Netflix's income statement, causing a significant decline in margins and
profits.


Saturation


Another risk factor we see for Netflix is that the company is much closer to saturating its
market than is commonly believed. The bulls argue that the company's 16.9 million
customers represent fewer than 15% of the 115 million households in the U.S., but the
company's churn data presents a different picture.


We have analyzed the last decade of Netflix's quarterly statements, in which the company
discloses customer additions and cancellations, and calculated that Netflix has had
approximately 30 million customer cancellations. In other words, the company has had to
add approximately 47 million customers - more than 40% of U.S. households - to be left
with today's 16.9 million customers (and many of these will cancel in the future; the churn
rate last quarter was 3.8%).


If history is any guide (we think it is), Netflix will need to somehow find another 47 million
subscribers for the company to double its current subscriber count (a common medium-
term objective in many analysts' view). We don't think that many potential additions exist.


Internet Bandwidth
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 18/98


Another major threat to Netflix is internet providers starting to charge for high usage rather
than offering unlimited downloading for a flat rate. It goes without saying that streaming
video is very bandwidth intensive and, as noted earlier, Netflix may account for as much
as 20% of all internet traffic during a typical evening. Such high usage by Netflix's
customers is slowing down the internet for everyone and is one of the reasons why Cisco
predicts that internet traffic will triple by 2014. To accommodate this, carriers like AT&T
and Comcast will have to invest billions of dollars - and will of course look for a return on
this investment, most likely by shifting to a pay-for-usage model that would make Netflix's
streaming content much more expensive.


This Business Week article nicely captures what's happening:



http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_50/b4207043617708.htm
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 19/98


While few experts expect carriers to stop investing in new capacity, there's
widespread agreement that a financial crunch is coming.


Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett has studied the issue from the
perspective of the wireless carriers. As traffic soars, he expects the revenue per
megabit to fall from 43 cents today to just 2 cents in 2014. That means a far lower
return on investment, a key measure for telecom companies.


"The carriers are faced with an incredible deflationary spiral," Moffett said.


The tussle between Comcast and Level 3 Communications shows how the issue can
become electric.


Level 3, which operates backbone networks that quickly ship bits between cities,
recently struck a deal with Netflix to help speed delivery of its streaming videos. The
result was a sudden surge in Level 3's traffic, which eventually goes through
Comcast's cables to reach subscribers.


On Monday, Level 3 accused Comcast of charging exorbitant rates to carry the
additional traffic. Comcast shot back that it had no obligation to bear the load for
free.


The exchange is a sign of the times: Even if the technology is up to the task of
shipping huge data packets, no one is sure how to pay for it.


Ultimately, most experts expect that people who are the heaviest data users will
have to start paying more, most likely in the form of tiered pricing plans. These are
already common in Europe and Asia, but Americans are used to no limits.


The wireless networks have already moved in this direction: In June, AT&T
discontinued its $30-a-month unlimited data plan, forcing mobile consumers to
choose between an 0.2-GB-per-month plan or a 2-GB-per-month plan. On
Wednesday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski
approved limits for fixed-line networks that carry data to home or businesses, and
said carriers should have "meaningful flexibility ... to address the effects of
congestion."


Such changes are new enough that the big data senders like Netflix haven't yet
adapted to them. But on an otherwise triumphant earnings call on Oct. 20, Hastings
did concede that AT&T's data plans might limit demand for watching movies on
mobiles devices.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 20/98


To Bernstein's Moffett, it was a striking admission.


"That was the first time I've heard one of those tech CEOs admit what should be
obvious: that you can't simply bet on continued bandwidth availability."


Netflix and others will, of course, complain about "network neutrality," but that's not the
issue here because Comcast isn't favoring its own streaming service over Netflix's. The
Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Julius Genachowski, recently
endorsed the "usage-based pricing" idea, so we see little chance that Netflix's argument
will prevail.


Legal Risk


As noted earlier, Netflix's core business of renting DVDs to its customers depends on the
First Sale Doctrine, which is coming under legal attack by content owners who argue
(correctly, in our opinion) that it's inconsistent and unfair. After all, if Netflix is prohibited
from renting another company's content over and over again without compensation if the
delivery mechanism is the internet, why should this principle be any different if the delivery
mechanism is a DVD?


In September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that calls
into question the First Sale Doctrine. Though it was a case related to re-selling software,
the court observed that the policy implications might affect movies as well.


According to Eric Goldman, an associate professor at Santa Clara University School of
Law, "The ruling could potentially have profound implications. Simply by using the right
legal terminology, copyright owners can license their works instead of selling them and
restrict how anyone, even third parties, use the copyrighted material."


This legal risk isn't a key pillar of our investment thesis, as the case will likely be tied up in
courts for years, but this ruling will likely change the negotiations between Netflix and the
content providers over the terms of DVD access in a way that isn't favorable to Netflix.


CFO Resignation


Netflix's long-time CFO, Barry McCarthy, resigned last week, citing "a desire to pursue
broader executive opportunities outside the company." (This sounds forced and cliched to
us.)



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_v._Autodesk,_Inc.
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 21/98


We have no insight into what the real story here is, but our experience is that the sudden,
unexplained resignation of a CEO or CFO is usually not a good sign, especially when in
this case McCarthy was very highly regarded, had served in this capacity since 1999, and
led the company's IPO in 2002.


What If We're Wrong? Could Netflix Be the Next Amazon?


In any position, long or short, we always ask ourselves, "What if we're wrong and what
would that scenario look like?"


The best bull case we can make for Netflix is that it becomes the next Amazon.com, which
today has a market cap of $80 billion and a stock trading at more than 70x trailing EPS.
The company has confounded all of its skeptics (and short sellers), who confidently (and
wrongly) predicted that numerous competitors, both online and offline, would put it out of
business.


Like many millions of others, we are loyal customers of Amazon for two main reasons:


1. A full selection of books and other merchandise, including the latest titles and
products; and


2. Low prices, driven in part by low margins (in the first three quarters of the 2010 fiscal
year, Amazon's operating margin was 4.4% and its net margin was 3.5%).


Also, Amazon is able to take advantage of the existing delivery infrastructure (U.S. Postal
Service, UPS, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), etc.).


Netflix's old business was highly successful for similar reasons: customers could access a
full selection of movies at an excellent price, and Netflix could piggyback on the existing
delivery infrastructure.


But Netflix's new streaming business doesn't have the same advantages. While
$7.99/month for unlimited streaming is an excellent price, the selection is very weak and
Netflix may soon encounter obstacles to unlimited usage of the internet, as we discussed
earlier.


Conclusion


We don't think there are any easy answers for Netflix. It is already having to pay much
more for streaming content and may soon have to pay for bandwidth usage as well, which
will result in both margin compression (Netflix's margins are currently double Amazon's)
and also increased prices to its customers, which will slow growth.

Under this scenario, Netflix will continue to be a profitable and growing company, but not
nearly profitable and rapidly growing enough to justify today's stock price, which is why we
believe it will fall dramatically over the next year.

hmm. Why are you continuing with a losing short ?? It is always good to keep a exit plan and follow that. One thing I
remind myself while shorting " Never underestimate the power of stupidity of people in large numbers". Add to that the
current ZIRP environment. The odds are stacked against the shorts. So you got to be nimble and not fight the trend
too long.. 
Facebook Valuation is at $45 Bn or Price to Sales of over 22x. Chinese dotcoms are at 50x to 100x sales. Those are

Excellent, very detailed analysis. I'd add another: NFLX's weak technology infrastructure. To support growth, they'd
have to make substantial investment and it will take at least a year to build out, test, and iron out the wrinkles.


NFLX is no Amazon.


16 Dec 2010, 04:48 PM


enriquez
Ironic you say "NFLX is no Amazon" with regards to their technology infrastructure because Netflix is built on
Amazon's cloud service (techblog.netflix.com/2...).


Being on Amazon's cloud service (or any cloud service) allows them to scale horizontally which means they
can "add more" infrastructure without much effort in response to growth. I believe Netflix has already proven
their ability to handle growth by adding 7 million subscribers... this year! Most consumers would not have
gone past the free trial given a slow and un-responsive service, but this is not the case with Netflix. It works,
it's growing, and it can handle it.

Yes. I agree. But technically from the charts, 80 was a big resistance for Visa. So good point for going short.
My point is that when you have recent news of Google willing to buy Groupon for $ 6 Bn. ( Google bought
Youtube for $1.7 Bn four years ago.), you cannot ignore these factors also.

This is a great analysis except NFLX defies so many conventional laws in investing. It is way overvalued, way
overbought, and yet still continues to climb. I wouldn't short now since it seems like things have stabilized. Every time
this stock takes a dip, it just keeps climbing up. I have no position but, hope you don't lose too much more on this.

With a slow economy,,NFLX's streaming deal at $8/month beats taking a family of 4 to the flicks and paying $50 with
popcorn etc. Who cares if you have to wait 28 days to see the latest and greatest.? I just stopped HBO from my dish
deal and that alone saves me $16/month,,,,twice what NFLX costs. Cord cutting is alive and well as is Netflix.


16 Dec 2010, 05:38 PM

@Aridzona: I agree the value NFLX's streaming service offers consumers is outstanding at the moment. But
keep in mind that value for a customer does not = value for an equity investor.


Mr. Tilson's analysis is looking beyond what is happening now. That's how the best do this. Figure out how the
dominoes are going to fall, and position accordingly.


17 Dec 2010, 10:12 AM

The market does not appear to be factoring in a critical reality for NFLX: The cost of the service simply must
go up.

The ISPs are going to charge someone for the bandwidth streaming customers are hogging - that cost will be
tacked onto users' cable/DSL bill, or it will be born by NFLX or one of it's proxies (like Level 3).


In addition, the content providers know that without content, NFLX has no business at all. They cannot create
content themselves - they are a distributor. The studios have the upper hand, and will demand much better
compensation from NFLX going forward.

Great Analysis by the author.. and good comments PDT! Content is always King - though without distribution
great content remains only in the attic!. If competition starts ramping up and start advertising the content gap
as a benefit... NFLX will start seeing the impact..


23 Oct 2011, 04:45 PM


Who Dat?
Competition? What you don't understand is that NFLX $8-$10 pricing "compliments" the service offerings from
Hulu/Plus, Amazon, iTunes, Blockbuster, and etc. Unless someone actually ''cancels" his NFLX membership and
signs up with another competitor, then that equates to competition. This means one less customers for NFLX.


IN the meantime, I will continue to enjoy my $10 subs with NFLX. If NFLX doesn't have what I want, then I will
download a movie (rare occassion) with iTunes. Will this make me cancel my NFLX? Hell no! If I want more
'channels', I'll see what HULU has that I can watch that evening for free. Will I cancel NFLX? Hello no again!


You need to "think" like a consumer. Consumers want bargains and selections. {edited}

This is a key aspect the author missed.


I cut my cable cord over 5 years ago and have had netflix ever since. Even as i find myself using Hulu and
other services more, I never once thought of canceling netlix. The other services seem to compliment, not
compete with them. Plus the "latest and greatest" films the author touts as key are many times quite frankly,
crap. I like all the indie movies Netflix has for such a bargain price.

This kind of exemplifies the entire issue for me. Netflix is what you call "streaming movies" of any kind. That
can go under "good will" category, deeply. I'm 29, so when I think "Blockbuster Video," I think of some creepy
vacant dump of a building comparable to Movie Gallery where creepy old people go to rent mainstream
DVDs, and a stock with a Q on the ticker. Plus, Netflix is built into everything, and has an unbelievable
selection of obscure indie or foreign films (if I'm going to watch something, it's going to be some indie/foreign
flick or a documentary...if I want some mindless loud movie I go and buy the Bluray for the unbelievable a/v
quality). I've never even heard of anyone streaming movies with Amazon, lol, but I may just not be polling
enough friends. The popularity of Netflix in Universities on PS3's and Xbox's is unbelievable. Basically every
college kid in America has Netflix.


I also dumped cable long ago for Netflix and a TiVo, and it's more than I could ever watch anyway.

and I would emphasize the weak content. I just canceled y trial subscription. At the beginning we were watching a
movie a night, for a weak. Soon we ran out of those hadn't seen. Checked any new release, and sure not much.
Really didn't see any reason to keep the subscription since I could see the same movies played on cable which I have
to keep for live content any way.

My instant cue is 200 strong and growing, my DVD cue is even larger. Like you, I'll likely never get through
everything and that's fine but there's always something to watch, when I want to watch it - unlike my (former)
$80 a month cable subscription.


17 Dec 2010, 10:55 AM


EuroDollar Ninja
Completely agree. My instant queue has over 400 titles in it right now, many being tv shows that have 22
episodes per title - not to mention those like Family Guy & Arrested Development that I will watch over and
over given the quality of the writing. But the point is that there are so many good films you never saw that are
old and so so so many good documentaries that when you combine the physical dvd offering for HBO/Other
Premium content that I think its way more content than you could ever watch.

Outstanding analysis in my view, the only thing missing is to balance this with some technical analysis that could help
with timing, for example a reference to support and resistance. NFLX's high was on 12-1 at 209. It's now at 181.65
and still above major moving averages, but it's down over 10% in the last 3 weeks.

"First, we think it's healthy to disclose and fully analyze our mistakes (although in this case we are not yet conceding
that we've made a mistake in our analysis, but we obviously made a mistake in terms of timing our entry into the
position)." Has the error up to this point been purely timing? Basically, from your perspective, has anything from the
business changed that makes the short less compelling today than a year ago? If not, is there reason to build a larger
position?


As you noted on a recent call with investors, the position becomes a larger part of your portfolio as it moves against
you; is there any possibility that T2 would consider making a short a 10-15% position in their portfolio (basically
adding to the short from here)? Or is the strategy limited to puts at this point to avoid over exposure? Interested to
hear your thought process on how to move from here, especially if the trend continues, the valuation keeps climbing
deeper into insanity, and your position continues to grow. Thank you.

I started my NFLX puts at ~200, cashed out half yesterday at ~178 at ~100% profit. Holding the other half for now -- it
may bounce a little here although there's no sign of any momentum. Will buy more puts if it goes above 190.


All the fundamentals aside, technically the momentum is gone. And the short ratio is not even very high yet.


It's not easy to find such a great combination of weak fundamentals, high valuation, and technical inflection point.

I pay much more attention to days-to-cover. Last I checked, NFLX was under 2 days. That doesn't amount to

Frankly, whether I am long or short, I don't consider short squeezes that useful or meaningful. They tend to be
short lived and my experience is gaps get filled. But I know a lot of people who bank on them.


Just my 2 cents. I'm sure the day-trading crew might have different feelings on the subject.

The fact that you did not cover early w/10% loss tells me that you should not manage money. I certainly wouldn't give
you my money.


It's o.k. to be short, it's o.k. to be bearish and short this stock or any other stock, but there is no excuse for not
knowing how to short stocks.


Most proper short setups take several weeks, if not months, and you certainly don't short a stock with an RS 99 and a
parabolic chart and massive institutional sponsorship. That's like throwing yourself in front of a freight train.

going long off of charts, I have never been stopped out of $NFLX with 10% stop from buy-point...volatility is
exaggerated. It can be bought.


I assume the same would be true for shorts, except the thing has gone parabolic...if you're constantly getting
stopped out, maybe that's an indication you shouldn't be short? You go long on the leaders in bull markets
and you short them when the broader market turns bearish.


this thing will die with any bear market, but you need to wait. The chart is going to look like Mosaic circa
September 2008.


I don't know this hedge fund's performance and I don't even know if it's publicly available, so I can't comment.
But winners don't let their losses run or average down their losers.

Thanks Whitney. Great article. Very thorough and well researched. One other item you should consider is:


Cable Internet is generally copper cable buried along streets. It cannot be easily (inexpensively) replaced with faster
optical cable. There is limited bandwidth on these lines that is shared among all neighborhood users. The cable
company itself uses some of the bandwidth to broadcast its cable shows. NFLX streaming videos use a lot of
bandwidth. If a higher percentage of subscribers start using NFLX streaming (and the number of subscribers double
by next year at this time), there will be technical problems transmitting all of the content quickly. NFLX streaming will
start to seriously interfere with WEB surfing. Individual cable internet customers may be very unhappy to have their
internet (non-NFLX) slowed down demonstrably. Stores may find that their online Christmas sales next year are much
less because people are reluctant to put up with the slowness of prime time internet surfing. Either or both of these
groups could sue NFLX (class action suits). At the very least, a lot of people will be unhappy with the slower internet
access, including NFLX customers themselves. In the case of the NFLX customers, this could easily increase the
churn rate and the cost of acquiring new customers.

I agree with you. They add content and content but the infrastructure is still the same. It will not end well.

This strikes me as a problem for Comcast and not NetFlix (and also, not a problem for Verizon Fios -- optical

I don't know the technicals of the compression technology Netflix uses, but it's pretty impressive. They
AREN'T streaming the DVD data, and the resolution is poor - about like a worn out VHS tape. If you look at
the screen when there is very little contrast across the screen (like a night scene outdoors), you can see the
edges of the discrete squares - some of the quite large, much like rural areas viewed on Google Earth.


I'm able to stream Netflix via residential DSL quite well - which has a fraction of the bandwidth available with
cable.


So the available bandwidth at the "last mile" doesn't seem to be an issue. With a cable modem, if you live in a
neighborhood with a high density of large data uses, it might be. But, I'm happier with DSL anyway.


Video streaming as a whole may give residential DSL a leg up over cable modems (hate RoadRunner service
when I had it anyway). At least with DSL, you've got a dedicated connection, even though it's only Class 2, all
the way back to the data switch.

The answer here should be that the cable companies take smaller profits and funnel the overly large salaries
of their execs into capital expenditure and LAY MORE PIPE. Think toward the future. Copper has to go the
way of the dinos sooner or later and all need to step up to denser fiber and ditch the co-ax. Capital investment
needs to happen for USA to stay competitive in data delivery. Davids option is retro and looks back to how
things are as opposed to thinking of how things must and should be.


21 Dec 2010, 04:23 PM


The Grid, Contributor
One of the better short articles out there, although still very confused about a number of issues.


However:


"Such high usage by Netflix's customers is slowing down the internet for everyone..."


Zero research, zero statistics, and not even anecdotes to back this up, meaning this assertion carries ZERO
credibility.


Broadband providers are NOT short on capacity, just because Netflix may be accounting for 20% of traffic, has
absolutely nothing to do with CAPACITY or LATENCY.


If you have a 10,000 gallon drum, which holds 5 gallons of liquid, but one user is putting in 1 gallon all by themselves,
they are accounting for 20% of overall usage. But that doesn't mean that drum is in danger of having capacity issues,
because you still have capacity to hold 9,995 gallons.


On top of this, providers have the ability to throttle down traffic (traffic shaping, quality of service based on type of
packets being passed) from very specific sources if they are indeed "slowing down" the pipe.


You are also confusing wireless networks with traditional landline backbones, which are not in any danger of having
overcapacity, as the backbones were WAY overbuilt during the .com era. Wireless networks are having capacity
issues, as they were never originally intended for bandwidth-hungry multi-media streaming applications when
originally rolled out.


All that 20% number really is about, is the broadband providers, mostly cable companies, which are also in the
content game. They are trying to charge a toll to use the delivery systems, not only to get a piece of the action, but to
put a dent in their direct competition. They will use this 20% number, but that number is extremely disingenuous when
you look at what it really means and WHERE it is coming from.


So what you could do, in the case of Time Warner, is to charge your direct competitor (Netflix), more money to use
your backbone, even they are already paying their providers (L3, in this case) anyway for the bandwidth.


That becomes a case of double-dipping, an unfair way to stifle competition, and in my opinion violates anti-trust laws
by a mile.


The bottom line is that you can make a short case for Netflix simply on it being overvalued, and that's it. Every other
factor I have seen mentioned by these short cases is almost always based on speculation or misinformation. These
short analysis are the equivalent of vaporware.

marmotzero
The only things I can think of that this analysis didn't cover have to do with marketing and psychology:


- There's something very nice psychologically about having an "unlimited" plan. People don't like parting with their
money, and when you're paying for individual content you have to be reminded that you're spending money every
time you watch something. It's possible that people might be irrationally attracted to unlimited content services, even
with weak content libraries.


- There has been a lot of churn in Netflix's subscriber base, but I get the impression that there are a lot of customers
who are "off and on". After all, when you have unlimited movie options it's pretty easy to go bananas and burn
yourself out. People move onto other stuff, cancel their subscriptions, and then come back later. I think my parents
have been on and off Netflix at least twice.


- Do people need a content stream that is both strong *and* broad? Has there been a careful market segmentation to
find out just how much new content people need? It's possible that most customers would be satisfied with having a
few new, popular movies and TV series, and then a bunch of cheaper filler content that they could go watch when
they are bored (like when people watch re-runs on TV). If most people are satisfied with this, Netflix could maintain its
subscriber base with a weak library and low prices... and considering the relative lack of success of pay-per-view
streaming services and the prices they demand, this could maintain Netflix's current position. This would be more of a
"hold" argument.


These are mere drops compared to the ocean of analysis in this article, but hopefully it added something to the
discussion. I have no position in Netflix.


16 Dec 2010, 07:54 PM


MintooMisra
Excellent analysis. However, it remains to be seen, how much increase in the subscription price of Netflix
would cause people to dump Netflix and go to cable. The price difference between cable TV and Netflix

I commented on one of these NFLX articles (not sure if it was this one), where I calculated out the price the

subscriber. The numbers were worse than I expected.

Just because AAPL, MSFT, or some other big name might have a ton of cash laying around does not mean

Todd Renfro, Contributor
Great analysis!


You are very brave to short. I find it very hard to predict when a catalyst will happen strong enough to shake people's
faith... but I think that the odds are in your favor if you can sustain your position long enough.


In my opinion, your strongest arguments lie in netflix suppliers demanding bigger shares of the pie. I agree that this
will substantially eat away at margins. I'm not sure how comcast and time warner will pull off a rate hike for internet
useage. I'm pretty sure it will have to be slow and slight, because consumers are already unhappy with past rate
hikes. Either way, I'm not sure consumers will dump netflix to save the $5 on their internet bill.


I think you overestimate netflix's competition. Significant barriers to entry are the same pricey contracts that netflix
now faces. Competitors will face the same costs, without the name recognition in their own court, or the significant
subscription base to use as leverage. As someone already pointed out, I use hulu and amazon on demand as
augmentation to my netflix library.


I have a subscription to netflix and have had one for about four or five years. Streaming content is great in a number
of ways.


1. My favorite channels on cable are spike, discovery, and history channel. But discover and history channel rarely
show the documentaries that i want to watch now that viewers seem to prefer "whale wars", "american pickers" and
"loggers". I don't care to see the same endless crab season garbage. Netflix has hundreds of documentaries, and I
can store them in my queue and display them when my wife relinquishes the remote. I'm ready to dump cable
because of netflix.


2. Children's tv. Hundreds of cartoons loaded up my children's amusement. No extra cost in my mind.


3. B movies... sometimes my wife and I feel like watching movies that we know aren't going to be cinematic gold.
Having one low fixed cost a month gives you the feeling that its ok to watch something that you will probably be
turning off 20 minutes later. We've actually found some gems this way.


The weak library doesn't bother us, because the dvd library is NOT weak, and we wait about a day to receive movies.


If you are looking for another weakness in the streaming content business, it is this. As content gets stronger,
subscribers will drop to lower priced plans. The need for 3 or 2 dvd's at a time will diminish, and overall revenues will
drop.


Anyways, I think you are right in the long run, and stock prices at these heights are seldom sustainable. I wish you the
very best.

Jake Huneycutt, Contributor
Great article. I've had similar thoughts on NFLX, but Tilson lays out the most thorough case yet as to why NFLX's
current market valuation makes little sense.


I'd also add that there are economies of scale associated with NFLX's DVD-by-mail model. This is why NFLX was
able to build such a huge moat around the industry once it got such a huge head start.


The economies of scale in digital streaming are not nearly as prohibitive. Of course, having an established customer
base is a big advantage, but I don't think that's enough to completely wall off the industry, like NFLX did with DVD-by-
mail. (And in fact, having the greatest content might be a bigger advantage.)


I'd be curious to see if AMZN (or anyone else) ever takes advantage of its content and tries to offer a monthly
subscription package. It would have to be much pricier than NFLX's package; but it might also include a much greater
amount of content. Frankly, paying $20 for 75% of the content out there, would be much better than paying $8 for
17% of the content.


NFLX might be walling itself in with the current set-up, because they are going to need to increase prices significantly
to acquire any meaningful amount of content. I do think NFLX has made some good moves, but like Tilson, I think
their margins will get squeezed and can't see how their current valuation makes much sense, since it would require
massive earnings growth over the next few years.

David White, Contributor
Lightway: 
The backbone of the internet is perpetually getting faster as companies like CSCO come out with new and faster
products.


However, the cable buried in the streets is not getting faster. It is not likely to be replaced soon. It will be extremely
expensive to eventually replace it. That bandwidth is very limited. Cable uses some to transmit all of its channels. The
rest it available to individual users. It is shared among all of the people in the same neighborhood. The actual number
varies, but it is fairly large. Cable was initially developed to transmit a limited number of channels. This is not like an
individual phone line. If you have a sniffer, you can read all of the data others in your neighborhood are sending and
receiving. It is all on a shared line (think a phone party line). This bandwidth will most definitely slow down with more
NFLX use.


A 1GB movie (approx. size) = 8Gbits. Most cable allows at most about 3Mbps. This slows to 0.5Mbps or slower
during periods of high use. If more people in the neighborhood use NFLX during prime time there will be a huge
problem. Downloading a 1gigabyte movie would take:


(1GByte * 8bits/byte ) / 0.5Mbps = 16,000 sec = 266.67 min. = 4.444 hrs.


Too slow for me.

Those numbers are a worse case scenario number with a lot of blanket assumptions on the underlying
equipment, the shape and type of the traffic, and aggregate usage.


Cable companies didn't just bury their equipment into the ground in 1981 and then just left it there. Most of
them, along with the major telecoms, have undergone major equipment upgrades over the last 10 years,
including all the way up to residences. This is not some ancient token ring coaxial network setup in your local
library during the Reagan era.


And by the way I don't think it's ever taken me 4 and half hours to download a 1GB file, maybe if you are on
some crappy hotel wireless connection, or old dial-up 56K modem, but never in my life, using DSL or cable in
dense cities on both coasts, or even in rural areas in the midwest, have I ever come across those type of poor
download speeds.


Again, disinformation, designed to benefit the cable companies, it's scare tactics, plain and simple.


This exact same complaint has come up every time the Internet user base has adopted new technology,
whether that be torrent downloading, media streaming (which has been around since the late 90s), and even
Youtube. (You know that other streaming bandwidth sucking technology).


On top of all that, Netflix is paying for all that outgoing bandwidth, so it's not like they are getting it for free.

ozcutty
Great article, basically the whole thing is a house of cards built on one single deal. 
I remember when everyone including the big studios said downloading movies won't work because of the size of the
files, clearly they have woken up and won't be selling their content cheap again.


Netflix will be history within 5 years. Google, Apple, Disney, Sony, etc will dominate the space.

I wish I could say that this was a great analysis. The thesis here is that shorting NFLX is a valuation call. However,
other than a few ratios, I don't see a scientific analysis on over valuation. Specifically, why this level of valuation is not
sustainable.


On the other hand, the market is supposed to be able to tell valuation. An over valued stock can shoot up the way it is
like NFLX proves only one thing: the market is broken.


If so, your BP call may be not a valuation call. Don't you suspect that it was a risk call that (most probably in this
market) happened to be worked out.


In this market, value investors need to differentiate themselves from highly speculative risk takers.

Terrible analysis. While you get the fact that valuation is high, you swung big and struck out completely an your
analysis of the competitive landscape. It's non existent. Netflix was, and still is a monopoly for the foreseeable future.


Just because someone streams a movie does not make them a competitor. The pricing, recommendation engine, not
to mention the subscription vs. pay per view make them totally different beasts. A corner store isn't a competitor to
Kroger or Safeway and a Civic isn't a competitor to a Porsche 9-11. Blockbuster, Amazon, Google, Apple - all of these
so called competitors offer pay as you go viewing. Nobody outside of HULU plus offers anything remotely subscription
based. Until they do, Netflix will keep riding high.


16 Dec 2010, 09:22 PM


The Enterprising Value Investor, Contributor
I think a lot of what you naysayers are missing about his argument is that NFLX's valuation implies that barriers to
entry are high and will stay high for the future, allowing for very profitable growth.


The issue is that the barriers to entry for NFLX's model are not high. Instead, they are quite the opposite. NFLX will
eventually be at the mercy of the content creators (DIS, NBC, etc.) and NFLX and other content providers will likely
experience margins that are depressed. Risk of new entrants and power of suppliers (suppliers of content in this
case) are quite high; content providers will eventually take the margin back.


16 Dec 2010, 09:35 PM


The Grid, Contributor
While that might be true, the barriers to entry have always been low, and these barriers have not suddenly
sprouted up out of nowhere within the last month (none of the short commentary has ever mentioned barriers
to entry regarding Netflix until December, when it suddenly became an agreed upon chorus).


So if the author is making the case that there needs to be a catalyst for finally bringing the stock down to a
reasonable valuation, a barriers of entry argument isn't it.


The example here is Google. Search engine barriers have always been and still are extremely low. But
nobody has been able to beat Google at what Google does.


16 Dec 2010, 10:06 PM


The Enterprising Value Investor, Contributor
True, but Google doesn't have to buy its content, it just sorts and lists it for users. NFLX has to buy content.
That is why margins will be pressured.


16 Dec 2010, 10:16 PM


The Grid, Contributor
Any other competitor against Netflix would have to buy content as well. And, if they are a brand new
competitor, that means they have to build those content deals and relationships from scratch, so that by itself
is a barrier.

or just offer better prices in the contracts (i.e. pay DIS, NBC or the movie studios more.) Anyone will be able
to uncut someone unless there is some barrier preventing prefect competition. Unless Netflix has the ability to
make the studios say they will ONLY distribute their content with Netflix (which they won't since, like I
mentioned before, the power of the suppliers is quite great in this relationship), other competitors will enter
the market.

Entry barrier? What entry barrier?


17 Dec 2010, 10:54 AM


bassmaster general
The barriers may not be high but they're not non-existent either. How many other 'competitors' are integrated
onto every single device you plug into your TV (or right into the TV). None. There are piecemeal offerings
here and there but Netflix hits them all. That's a pretty significant barrier from the get go.


Then there's brand identity, subscriber retention, value and cost, customer service, studio relationships just to
name a few.


Nobody, not Amazon, not Google, not Apple could or would be able to replicate what Netflix has anytime
soon.

You said, "Any other competitor against Netflix would have to buy content as well."


Not if they are some of the content vendors NFLX is buying from.


If you (1) already have a lemonade recipe people love, and (2) have mixed up an inventory of the stuff, why
not set up your own lemonade stand? Especially when it is so easy to do?


NFLX may have a nice brand name and happy customers, but they're not buying the lemonade stand. They
want the lemonade. And NFLX simply cannot make it's own lemonade.

Considering how slow the big media conglomerates are to adapt and simply try to cling to old and outdated
money making models, using them as an example of someone that could come along and sweep Netflix out
of the way is laughable at best.


The content creators have already created their competition to Netflix and called it Hulu. The only problem is
each piece of the pie (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, Comedy Central, Time Warner, etc, etc) wants to have its own
say and nobody can agree on anything. What you end up with is a pretty inferior service. They might have a
lemonade stand but they forgot the sugar because they don't have a clue as to what people actually want.

@biobat: That's fair - the studios have made some serious miscalculations in the past, and one of those was
the Starz deal to NFLX for ~$25 M per year.


Still, I have trouble making the leap to betting 70x EPS that they will not learn from their mistakes.


If it is in their best interest to form an alliance, and offer all their TV shows and movies through it, rather than
settle for the pennies NFLX has been paying them, I think they will smarten up and do it. Or they will just
demand enough from NFLX to make it make economic sense on their end of the deal.


I try to look at these situations from a game theory framework. Each player can make moves, but what will be
the resulting counter-moves? And the responses to those? In that kind of dynamic, I simply don't see how
NFLX can win in the end.


That said, I'm out here looking to find holes in my reasoning. I'm not trying to convert people to my position... I
want to figure out if I could be wrong, before it costs me money! So although I might seem set, I'd rather
discover a blind spot and be wiser for it. So I appreciate your angle. Thanks.

That's fair. All I know is Reed Hastings has outsmarted nearly everyone he's dealt with over the past decade
with NFLX. I don't know what his next move will be and that might be reason enough to stay on the sidelines
but his success isn't something I'd bet against.


Already we're seeing the foray into Canada, and while the market is only 10% of the US market, I'd be willing
to bet my next paycheck that they're gobbling up Canadian content for what amounts to peanuts, or in other
words, getting Starz-like deals. That will drive further subscriber growth. The same thing will happen with
expansion into the UK, Europe, Japan, etc (which I'm also willing to bet is a lot closer than anyone thinks). In
other words, I think it's going to be a long time before the price of content catches up with subscriber growth
and starts to put a real dent in EPS.

The Enterprising Value Investor, Contributor
AAPL has twice the market cap of NFLX in cash on its BS; if it wanted to aggressively compete with NFLX it
easily could.


17 Dec 2010, 06:39 PM


Howard_Roake
OK- Chew on this stat:


Cash on Hand: AAPL 26 B$, NFLX:257M$, that 2 orders of magnitude more cash. 
Then consider this: 
Market Cap: Lions Gate Entertainment: LGF: 905M$. 
So who can buy LGS for 1B$, and still have "pocket change" of $25B to buy control of as many content
providers as they chose?


AAPL already controls both hardware and software for their computers and digital music players and content
(Itunes, with the largest number of movies and programs as outlined in this analysis). 
So, QED for the fundamental problems with NFLX, the author is quite correct. Now for sentiment.


From a technical prospective (timing), its still making higher highs and higher lows-I'd want to see this reverse
with a lower high. However, once it breaks its 50 day moving average at 175, look out below. At this point I'd
buy a long dated, say March, put 170/150 debit spread, selling the 180/200 call credit spread to finance it (net
entry would be around 0 for this pairs trade) and then roll this condor taking profits as it breaches each
support level. Should be a good strategy all the way down to around 120.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 40/98


I just bought a new Samsung TV, turn it on, I have Netflix as an icon. Try it out for 1 month (stream only $7.99). I love
it. I think I will disconnect my Dishnetwork account.


BTW, I had my iPhone, I can watch it. My boy has his Wii, connect to the old Sony TV, he can watch it too.


Heck, I watch old shows, so what, but I love it because there is no commercial. Love the Tudors series with no
commercial. On DishNetwork, I have to pay $30 per month, all those shows, they have commercials, disrupt my
entertainment hour, and most of them are either shopping channels or junk news like CNN, FoxNews, and more
commercials.


I can watch any shows I want, anytime I want, stop and watch it again, rewind and watch it again, for $7.99, no TiVo,
just the TV and my internet account.


Netflix can adjust the resolution rate on TV depending on my network speed, which is fine.


I have friends, they like their Netflix.


As for those studios, if they don't have Netflix contracts, what are they gonna do with those old contents anyway.
Sitting in their libraries and collecting dust ? Netflix will pay those studios cheap of course, because those are old
shows. Remember, Netflix said: they want to complement, not compete with cable or satellite network or regular live
TVs. I am sure Netflix will negotiate with those studios, all of them, so Netflix contents will refresh for us to enjoy.


Reed Hastings, don't under estimate him, he knows what the customers want. He sent out email, asking customers
for feedback, how we like the shows, how is the quality of stream, those feedbacks will help Netflix to satisfy their
customers.


As for Hulu Plus, CinemaNow, XFinity, BlockBuster stream, etc, they are too expensive, $5.99, $4.99, $3.99 per show,
only rich guys can afford it. The rest of poor Americans, we like Netflix and Coinstar RedBox.


Now and then, if I like new movies, I will drive to local McDonald, Walgreens, Walmart and rent from RedBox for $1.00
per night. Happy deal.


Netflix and RedBox (Coinstar) are the McDonald's of entertainment. 
Watch these 2 companies grow.


Don't forget how McDonald grows for last few years, their One Dollar Menu. Burger King, Wendy's are still trying to
catch up.

valuation is too high for EPS growth.


You aren't going to switch to hulu/blockbuster/etc... Doesn't matter.


What does matter is that right now Netflix is paying $X for content. In the future they will pay $X times some
multiple which will crush earnings. Which, in his view, will crush the stock.


Do you see the difference?

itsAme,


Nobody knows exactly what Netflix will pay in the future for content. It's all conjecture and speculation at this
point. It could and likely will go up in the short term, but it could also go down in the long run. To suggest that
you or anyone else has a crystal ball and knows exactly what's going to happen, is a disservice to the bear
argument.


17 Dec 2010, 10:58 AM

Good point. Nobody knows where anything is going in the future.

content prices will go up and that will crush earnings and the stock. That is why he is short


17 Dec 2010, 11:05 AM


TranTran
Until the next contract negotiation is done, no one knows if the future contracts will be high. And if the future
negotiated contracts are high, the price will apply to all players. The cost for new players to be Netflix
competitors will also be raised. Remember those old shows just sit there collect dust, if not for Netflix,
everything can be negotiated for a price. Can't wait to see those old classics from Ted Turner library. Surely
Netflix will raise price for a few bucks more, so what, it's still beat DirectTV, Dish or Comcast. Right now,
Netflix is trying to enrich contents, get as much as customers, keep price low.


Another item, about bandwidth cost, it's between FCC and bandwidth providers, if it costs Netflix, it will also
cost Youtube, Yahoo Video, CNN video, Hulu, BlockBuster, .... Hate those intruded video commercials.


Netflix will be a good short, when growth is no longer there or saturated. Right now, neighbors, friends, co-
workers, not many have been in yet.


Valuation is high, so it's justified for short ? High price can be higher, low price can be lower. Until NFLX has a
day with 13-14 millions shares, price drops more than 5% , 50 day moving avg is broken, the trend is up.

What author is underestimating is that NFLX can stream all over the world. If they penetrate other countries, their
revenue will go up. NFLX is on 200 gadgets and growing. Their API is not easy to catch up for competitors. They said
in November, they got 10 billion downloads and the peak rate is like 10,000 downloads per second. Also in November,
1 million new people subscribed, by the end of the holidays, it could easily reach 2 million new customers. In the
beginning, no one believed AMZN model, but now every one gives credit to them, same here with NFLX. First
entrants will always have the market share. As far as the content costs, both parties will find a win win situation. NFLX
is just overvalued but it's valuation adjusts over time. NFLX is here to stay. Long and well. Even a stock split or tie up
with a content company will propel this stock higher.

I don't know what Tilson's expertise is in but it certainly isn't in financials or technology (he has gotten both wrong in
the last year and a half).


In the interest of full disclosure, both Apple and Netflix have saved my butt over the last 10 years. I have been a
Netflix member since 2004. As much as I admire Apple's products, I can't see spending $100 on Apple TV only to rent
HD movies for $4.99 each, when I can get new releases + unlimited downloads for $10/month with Netflix.


As long as it holds $180 (the lower end of its upward trading channel) it will be okay. Hulu is the closest thing to Netflix
and it's a joke - who wants to see Rhoda re-runs? Not even close.


Tilson is trying with all his might to come out of this trade with some dignity. I look forward to his next great call.

Note from SA Editors: We thought Ananthan's comment below was worthy publication as a stand-alone article. He
agreed to upgrade it to an article which can now be read and responded to here:


seekingalpha.com/artic...


:::


As an industry professional who respects your hedge fund, thanks for such an in-depth look into your reasoning. It is
truly rare for a professional of your magnitude to share analysis, and we wish the rest of our industry was as
transparent.


While we do not disagree with your premise, we believe your reasoning is fatally flawed at its core. Quite simply,
valuation shorts should NEVER be entered. We 100% agree that NFLX is overvalued at the current 69.3x earnings it
currently trades at. But, if you were to short this company, why not short WYNN at 82.49x earnings, LVS at 129.29x
earnings, or better yet, Amazon (a company you mentioned as competition) at 72x earnings?


Every time an investor speaks about a valuation short, they talk about the one "misstep" it will take as a catalyst for
the stock to start tanking. The problem is, there is no ceiling to how high a highly or overvalued company can go in the
meantime. We know from experience shorting the casino stocks at the then-ridiculous multiples of around 65-70x, that
there is not much difference between a stock trading at 60x or 80x. There are no investors worth their weight in tin

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 44/98


that think a stock is cheap at 69.3x, but then why is it still trading there? The largest holders of Netflix (Fidelity,
Technology Crossover Management, Morgan Stanley, Renaissance Technologies, and Vanguard) are not fools.


Unfortunately, the reason why Netflix, and all valuation shorts with high short interests for that matter, stay so high is
short sellers like yourself. The current short interest on NFLX is over 11 million shares, or 23% of the entire float of
NFLX. As long as there are this many short sellers still short NFLX, it cannot fall. There are very few sellers left and
an incredible amount of buyers (over 11 million shares' worth, courtesy of short sellers buying to cover once they've
reached their pain threshold).


To put the pain of being short based on valuation in perspective, in March 2009, there were over 18 million shares
short. NFLX's price then? $39.37 per share. The stock has rallied 358% since then. I pray for your LP's that you have
not been short this entire time. At some point it is better to take your ball and go home.


On to problems with your analysis itself:


The most troubling part of your reasoning is your reliance on the expertise and savvy of media companies and their
corporate leadership. History has shown that these companies are extremely stubborn to adapt, and are always the
last ones to the party. Having personally worked at Time Warner, Universal, and Disney, I can tell you that every
studio in Hollywood (except for Disney, whose brand strength and core strategy are extremely well-implemented)
might as well have monkeys running them. These same studios are the ones who spent millions in court opposing the
VCR, then DVR's, and also opposed streaming music to the point where they completely lost out on the internet
music business by selling off their music divisions at rock-bottom valuations before Apple revolutionized the industry
by taking it online and giving consumers what they wanted (sound familiar?). Oh and this is after they came up with
the insanely bright idea of suing Suzy Smith from Iowa for copyright infringement for downloading two songs off of
Napster.


Media companies are aimless dinosaurs who are hyper-protective of their content, and their historic inability to adapt
to the future will ultimately cause their inevitable collapse. There is no more accurate truism to describe media
companies' quandary than this: innovation and technology ALWAYS win.


With regards to the argument that Netflix's content is weak, why do they have 16.9 million customers and growing
fast? Quite simply, if people didn't like Netflix's content, they would not sign up. See the "vote with your feet" economic
theory of Charles Tiebout (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...).


Furthermore, if Netflix's content is so weak, then how exactly would their current suppliers be justified in increasing
the price of their content by 1,000% as you suggest? Both arguments cannot be simultaneously correct. I fully agree
that the price of their content will rise, but it is anyone's guess as to how much, as negotiations are still underway.


As for the saturation and internet bandwidth these are little more than pie in the sky reasons to sell the stock.
Saturation is not a problem, especially when taking a global market for NFLX's product into account. NFLX being hurt
by internet bandwidth price increases is laughable. That is the financial equivalent of grabbing for straws. The day
internet companies see multiple contraction based on the rising price that consumers are paying for bandwidth is the
day pigs fly.


The legal risk argument is also flawed. While attending UCLA School of Law I spent a great deal of time researching
intellectual property law specifically as how it related to "new media," meaning digital distribution. Just as the courts
struck down the studios' challenge to VCR's when they became popular, and again to Digital Video Recorders (i.e.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebout_model
5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 45/98


Tivo), I highly doubt the courts will strike down the First Sale Doctrine. The reason for this is that courts are hyper-
sensitive to stunting growth and innovation through technological means. If the studios sold Netflix the DVD's while
the First Sale Doctrine was in force, then they were on constructive notice that Netflix was free to do with them as
they pleased. Just because the studios have run their businesses ineptly and Netflix has innovated profitably since
does not mean that the courts will have sympathy for the studios. Throughout the history of audiovisual innovation,
the studios have opposed almost all forms of progress through the courts. In spite of huge legal fees paid, their result
has almost unequivocally been unfavorable. Courts always rule on the side of innovation.


Finally, the most dangerous parts of your reasoning are the assumptions you have not discussed. You are assuming
that Netflix's strategy and business model will remain largely static in the face of these strategic challenges. Given
CEO Reed Hastings' demonstrated ability to out-think the studios and innovate, I would not bet on this. Just as
Amazon proved all doubters wrong, Netflix could as well.


For the record, we have no position in NFLX, or in any media company for that matter. However, after reading the
reasoning regarding the continued short interest in NFLX, it makes us seriously consider a long position in the stock.

With respect, I do not agree you group NFLX with the gambling stocks which never are good in fundamentals.
In addition, these stocks give good expectation in China's Macau casinos and the eventual recovery from the

You forgot to mention the most important statistics: 
Insider Sales (last 6 months): -41% (insiders reduced holdings by 41%! over 1.5M shares) 
Institutional Sales (last 6 months): -57% (institutions are shorting this stock heavily like the author admits) And
by the way, they've increased their short position over the last month (source: yahoo finance). They're not
covering, boys and girls, so there's no real floor under this one! 
So, who is accumulating? The retail investor/sucker who thinks a stop loss will protect him against a huge
overnight gap down? 
If you want to be long this one you better be hedged using call spreads and/or puts on you long positions-
stops are for idiots who don't understand how they actually work. The insiders know something about
valuation that you apparently don't! Always look at insider sales first if you are thinking of going long.

Quit paying for a bloomberg when you can use bigcharts to discover (as I just did in about 30 seconds) that
the historic NFLX P/E from Jan 2008 to Jan 2010 was constant at 25. Yet, now its 75! And margins will be
contracting, yet you think P/E should be expanding? You should work for the Federal reserve they need your

bubble is so wrong, we need get some better education here about shorting. 
1. I made my first million in the internet bubble, shorting stocks from 1999 to 2002. To say it wasnt obvious -
well, for many smart investors who were wise to Wall St's scams and overselling, it was. And what made it
profitable was PRECISELY because you had the retail trade and a bunch of institutions on the other side,
buying and selling the hype. Contrarian investing is the ONLY way you can beat the market. It was obvious
that many of the dot-com Icarus stocks would fall to earth. Shorting the IPO lockup expirations, shorting after
GS would goose a stock with a recommendation, but most importantly, shorting companies with great stories
but lousy money-losing (or fraudulent) biz models - been there, done that. Not easy, but definitely "obvious" if
you apply Graham-Dodd type fundamentals to the stocks. I decided to go big on this in late Feb 2000, when
PALM ended up being worth more in an IPO than its parent company was as a whole. It rang clear as a bell
that price and value were disconnected. (I arb'd the PALM/COMS spread, and made money mainly from
PALM falling back down.) ...and btw, if everyone was doing it from the get-go there never would have been
Naz 5,000. that's the point. 
2. Shorting is NEVER easy. A worthless stock I shorted jumped 20% in a gap-up opening, then proceeded to
rise another 20% in one trading session. You can lose BIG, temporarily, even if you are right on the valuation.
That's one good reason it's not for the faint of heart or the uncareful with money management. 
3. EVERY short is a valuation short. There is no other kind. Short relies on the fact that as time goes to
infinity, the stock trends towards the 'true' value. Shorting is an arbitrage, when value and price are out of
whack. 
4. What can go wrong? The bubble can go on, the company can grow into the mispriced valuation, the market
can keep going up.  
5. ... the risk-reward for shorting is upside-down (only 100% gain versus unlimited risk, whereas going long its
the opposite), so your investment thesis *and* your timing needs to be on target. Because of #4 and #2,
shorting requires a good understanding of technical analysis. 
6. I would be wary of shorting any fundamentally healthy and growing stock, even if their valuations are too

high. I recall Forbes talking about how the valuations of some networking stocks were crazy-high. Back in
1995. Included Cisco on the list. And a few others that continued on to more triples. You do NOT want to short
a stock that could be 10X bigger in 5 years. (Now that thinking help put dot-coms in the stratosphere, but the
difference was the dot-coms that died werent making money.) 
I made money shorting EBAY in 1999, but it was luck and a mistake, I got out at a small profit and just missed
getting hurt badly.  
7. The real money in shorting is in finding the "GTZ" or go-to-zero stocks that are losing money. Finding them
is a far more profitable trade than big cap established company.


Given all this, I would suggest that NFLX is probably valuation-rich and an ok but not great short candidate. It
looks like it is rolling over, and a small short (1/4 position) with wide stops (e.g. above $200) would make most
sense if you want a position, and extend position if thesis is 'confirmed' with margins falling and lower price.
Still, the short case is marginal IMHO, because NFLX does have opptys to still grow profitably and catch up to
its price over time.

Well said. I will past your post into my Instablog in case I need to read it again in the future.


Dot-com is pretty easy to track as so many warning articles were written. I remember one compared the value
of a dot-com company could fit into one conference room of a major corporation but their market caps are the
same. I escaped from the massacre of pigs who followed the herd.


I do not want to argue with success, but shorting is not for most with the following pitfalls.


* Could lose more than 100%. 
* Need to pay dividends and interest. 
* Not all stocks can be shorted. 
* Not allow in retirement accounts. 
* Should avoid some sectors unless you have a good reason: drug, mine, bank (unless you know the quality
of mortgages)... 
* Timing. There is no perfect timing but perfect luck.


I find the best time to short is the the beginning of market bottom. Market peak could be the best, but it is too
hard to determine the peak.

"Because of #4 and #2, shorting requires a good understanding of technical analysis." 
I agree. Shorting carries lots of incalculable upside risk.  
If you are a short term trader then you cannot trade the stock based on fundamentals. It rarely works. It works
much better with Technical and the day to day sentimental value from the market on the selected stocks.  
for NFLX, both technical and sentimental values are heavily negative at this moment so shorts have the ST
advantage.

TonyP4,


I just want to add onto your comments about shorts not being for anyone.


Freedoms says that shorting is an arbitrage in point three. Shorting is NOT an arbitrage strategy. I believe
arbitrage exists only in efficient market hypothesis, and not in reality.


In point 4, freedoms explains why shorting is NOT an arbitrage strategy, although he doesn't say so 
>> "4. What can go wrong? The bubble can go on, the company can grow into the mispriced valuation, the
market can keep going up. "


Even in cases like the palm spinoff, which has been listed as an example of an ideal arbitrage, risk still exists.
Since the shorter pays interest and transaction costs, mispricings can persist longer than the shorter can stay
solvent.


Just pointing this theory out in the interest of education.

Yes, I agree but ... "If you are a short term trader then you cannot trade the stock based on fundamentals. It
rarely works." ... the reality is that my best shorts were longer-term and very fundamentally-based. That is,
they were worthless or worth-much-less. Technical analysis helps you get to an understanding of the supply-
and-demand for the stock, since that is what drives the price, and it helps you manage your risk (eg knowing
when a stock hits a resistance point). So, my point is that in shorting it is not fundamentals or technical
analysis, it is that you need BOTH to succeed as a short.


20 Jan 2011, 09:55 PM


Freedoms Truth
First, you are correct on terminology. I used the term arbitrage loosely / metaphorically - I treat a short as if it
were an 'arbitrage' between what an efficient value-priced market would price the stock at and the real market
is doing. You HAVE to realize that the market IS inefficient, wrong, and sometimes (during bubbles and
panics) flat-out crazy, but it's a lot bigger than you and can beat you to a pulp if you bet against it. Claims that
the market is efficient would have to explain the extremes of panics and bubbles, and the fact that some can
consistently outperform others in the market. Shorts need to think *as if* they are in a risk 'arb'-type situation -
where you are betting on the mis-pricing, not between New York and London, but between New York and
idealized-rational-market - and the catalyst that closes the gap may occur some day, but it could be delayed.
Thinking of it this way helps to frame the investment thesis for the short, because you need not only a

valuation case, but a 'catalyst' factor that gives timing to the price change hoped for. In a lot of the shorts of
the dot-com era, this might involved IPO unlock periods, cash flow, next reporting periods, etc.


Second, arbitrage is all about finding pricing IN-efficiency in the markets, so the comment about efficient
market hypothesis is confusing. I don't believe in the efficient market. And if you did, hang it up, go index fund,
and use your time better than sotck picking. What I do believe is that in order to beat the market, you will have
to have a clearer sense of the true valuation of stocks than the market as a whole. That is hard to have
except when you know a particular stock or industry real well, or when the market is in a panic (2008-2009) or
bubble (1999-2000). Coincidentally, I did great in those panic and bubble times. Times like now, not-too-hot,
not-too-cold, harder to beat the market as it is not at either extreme.


Third, yes, risk-free is rare in arbs, and I am well aware of risks in arbitrage, having my head almost handed
to me over the Dow / Rohm & Hass buyout , for example (all's well that end's well there), it was supposed to
close, then was at risk, then finally happened. If there was no risk in those situations, the reward would
quickly go away as well. The market has its quirks but it can iron out many mis-pricings.


20 Jan 2011, 10:15 PM


Todd Renfro, Contributor
freedoms, 
I don't believe in efficient market. While that wasn't the point of my post, there is a relevant tangential topic to
discuss.


One (of many) reasons I don't believe in efficient markets is because efficient market proponents argue that
any inefficiencies will quickly be wiped out by arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs will recognize "risk free" trades (the
definition of arbitrage), exploit it, and close down the irrational price gap.


Why doesn't this happen? My point was that a "risk free" trade does not exist. When you take a trade, you are
facing risks e.g. your analysis is wrong, the rest of the market's irrational behavior persists, the fundamental
situation that made it inefficient randomly changes, etc. 
You face these risks on all trades, but on a short trade you have an additional element of time. All trades have
opportunity cost, but a short has monetary costs as well. So you need your "risk free" trade to resolve itself as
soon as possible. There's the rub. 
If you want to consider a trade an arbitrage, no skin off my back. Maybe I'm wrong and their are such things. I
don't consider any trade to be such and am always watching my back for where i screwed up, or where the
fundamentals could go bad.


I believe all of this is evident, btw, to anyone who stops and thinks about it. Economists can be immune to day
to day realities, but traders cannot, and any trader worth his/her salt probably knows what i'm saying
inherently.


Still, the devil's in the details, and sometimes it helps to articulate the finer points of a definition. Words affect
how we think. If we don't define them carefully, we tend to stray from rationality somewhat.

Forgot to add:


Your tax rate is short-term capital gain which is always higher than the long-term rate so far.


Good arguments.

"Furthermore, if Netflix's content is so weak, then how exactly would their current suppliers be justified in increasing
the price of their content by 1,000% as you suggest? Both arguments cannot be simultaneously correct. I fully agree
that the price of their content will rise, but it is anyone's guess as to how much, as negotiations are still underway."


I think both arguments can be simultaneously correct. If the price of the content was too low to begin with (in this case
25MM or $0.15 per user approx) then yes it can go up by 1000% because it should have been priced higher initially.
According to the unnamed executives, cable/satellite companies were already paying in excess of a dollar for the
same content.


Very thorough analysis, thank you. I had not considered your subscription analysis of the US households being almost
47MM as having subscribed to Netflix at some point. I have subscribed to Netflix and would so again, if I had more
time to watch movies (even though I am short the stock).


The main thesis to being short Netflix is margin compression, versus the assertion that it is a short primarily based on
valuation. The evidence during the past few quarters has shown that margins are compressing. If margins stop
compressing (I think that is a year away or more) then shorts should be covered.


Short NFLX (from 145). I've been wrong so far.


17 Dec 2010, 02:56 AM


Risk Hunter, Contributor
Absolutely both arguments can be simultaneously correct! Asserting otherwise, I thought, was the weak point
of Thangavel's otherwise excellent post.


An old beater car cannot compete with a new BMW, but the beater still has some fair value. The beater may
actually change hands far below or far above that value. The BMW is irrelevant in pricing the beater.


The evidence from multiple sources suggests Starz sold NFLX its old beater way too cheap and it seems next
time around Starz will price it a lot higher.


I also take issue with Thangavel's "valuation shorts should never be entered". I think that is foolish because
it's such a big opportunity lost. Instead I would suggest to keep "valuation" short positions small. The
NASDAQ was screaming to be shorted in the late 90's only because of ridiculous PE's, not incompetent
management or fraud. Once that bubble broke, it deflated by two thirds in under 2 years.

Point is, it was incredibly obvious to wiser investors that tech stocks were at ridiculous multiples and had to

Just keep the position small enough to not lose sleep in case you discover you got in way below the peak.

Regarding your point that Nasdaq was "screaming to be shorted," please check out our updated post
responding to Mr. Tilson: lakshmi-capital.com/20.../.


We show that short sellers clearly tried to profit from Nasdaq's insane overvaluation, just as Mr. Tilson is
attempting to do now with NFLX, but that Nasdaq's fall only began AFTER most short sellers covered. If there
are too many skeptics out there, the only place for the shorted security to go is up.

ratobranco
In response to Thangavel's point, valuation shorts absolutely do work. (Jeez, where you not around for the internet
bubble?)


The catch, of course, is that they only work when the EPS growth slows or stops. So the key question wrt NFLX is,
when will the EPS growth slow or stop, and will the company at *this price* and *this market cap* still reflect such a
lofty valuation? I think the probabilities say "soon" and "yes."


You don't have to overthink this. Just follow the money here. Insiders are flocking to the exits, dumping shares like
there is no tomorrow. Trends like that rarely end well.

You just interrupted me with this well-documented-pros-a... of NFLX info


Disclosure: I'm long NFLX, writing an article, titled, "TANER #2: Extra Activity I (2010): Riding Tigers (NFLX, CMG, &
BIDU)", which will be posted shortly.


The fact: NFLX hit a top ($206.80) on11/30. Flying with head wind due mainly to CMCSA & CSTR since the top.


My view (it's only my personal view: it does not represent the intend of my master, "TANER" (for more info, visit my
Instablog) is that all info has been reflected on the closing NFLX prise of yesterday. Your piece hardly adds any
significant "new" info so that it does not afffect tomorrow. We will see it.


Investing is a-zero-sum game. Betting and timing is everything. Since 11/30, my betting has become smaller and
smaller. And I have a big advantage. I'm a long-only long-term (3m to 2 years).


Tip: If your bet is too heavy and too shor-term, better to reduce your bet or buy back or both. yk

Just curious how is long only a big advantage? Long only managers only make money when the market goes
up. Only being able to profit in one scenario doesn't seem like an advantage to me, let alone a big advantage.
Also investing is not a zero sum game. Companies actually create or (destroy) real wealth which ultimately
accrues to the debt and equity owners. Futures and options are zero sum games.

Very well written Mr. Tilson. Was just thinking the other day I hadn't read anything by you in a few months, and I was
thinking of your Netflix short.


I appreciate the candor, especially in the beginning of the article.


But I have to say ... I learned a long time ago, and the hard way ... not to try to time shorting extreme valuations. It's
trying to time when hysteria will die ... or at the very least ... subside.


Or, as I often tell ones: The market can go in the direction of "stupid" for longer than I can hang with that crowd (my
take on the ol irrationality quote)

#1. At a market cap of about $10 billion Apple could pay a 30% premium and buy Netflix with it's pocket change. For
that matter so could Microsoft. 
#2 One thing the author misses is that the Netflix interface is built into most new televisions and blu ray dvd players.
This is a huge advantage over the competitors. 
#3 Netflix could provide free streaming if the customer would accept commercials. Netflix would then take the money
they make from advertising and buy more and better content. The advertiser would know his commercials are being
watched and he would also know how many people are watching. Plus Netflix could charge more for the most popular
movies. They could charge based on viewership. 
In conclusion, you better think outside the box on Netflix because that is where they are headed. Personally, I am
waiting for the stock to drop so I can get back in. LOL

@long_on_oil:


RE your point #1. Yes, AAPL and MSFT do have enough cash to acquire NFLX, and yes, they could even pay
a 30% premium. But did you calculate out what they would be paying per subscriber if they did so?


I did, and here's what I got:


NFLX's current market cap = $9.49 B 
NFLX's most recent subscribers = 16.9 M (but let's round it up to 18.5 M) 
A takeout bid with 0% premium would mean AAPL (or whomever) was paying $513 per subscriber... That
seems a little high, don't you think? I mean, if AAPL is selling movies for $4.99 each, how many movies
should they model every NFLX subscriber on average buying? AAPL's net margin is 21.5%, so their profit on
each movie sold is in the neighborhood of $1.08. So... for them to break even on a deal like this, AAPL would
need to sell about 475 movies (on average) to each NFLX subscriber. Wow, those are some seriously
precious customers!


And don't forget, the percentage of free trial subs (i.e., UNPAID subs) is accelerating. Over $500 for those
subs definitely seems expensive to me.


How about with the 30% premium over the current market cap? Obviously it gets worse. Then the acquirer
would be paying $667 per subscriber.


I'm not saying it is impossible that some fool will put in a bid for NFLX... I'm just advocating running the
numbers to see if it makes economic sense. It's tempting to just latch onto an idea that sounds possible, but
doing some calculations can save an investor some pain by revealing how crazy the economics would have
to be for it to work.


Those scenarios just seem outrageously implausible to me.

But you are not figuring in future growth plus Apple will now have locked in a new customer ripe for the
picking for future products. Heck the dish companies give away $400 DVRs just to capture one customer.
Apples Superbowl commercials will probably cost $200 for each viewer that actually goes out and buys an
Apple product. 
How much would it cost per viewer for an advertiser to sponsor a entire 2 hour show. If Netflix were to provide
free streaming video if you would just watch commercials, they could easily make $200 per viewer per year
on the advertising income alone. After all that is what has made TV profitable since it's inception. We are just
reinventing and rejuvenating an old business model.

#3 The content owners have the final say if you get to add commercials or not......not Netflix. I think it is a
copyright infringement to change the content by adding commercials unless the content owner gives you the
right to do so. The content provider would want the advertising money and then they may let Netflix stream it
for free.

Apple (iTunes) - Relatively evil in their closed environment/censoring/... freakish delivery of content.  
Google (GOOG) (YouTube) - not to evil yet but YouTube has yet to be profitable. GOOG TV is not a hot seller and
they picked a bad partner. Delivery to multiple devices with a clean seachable library is negatory.  
Amazon.com (AMZN) (Amazon Video on Demand) - Deleted content off users Kindles without their consent. Also
delivery is computer only. My compy is not hooked up to my TV but my Wii/360/PS3 are all hooked up. 
Disney (DIS) - definitely evil, please see the Diseny Vault for their films as well as same family friendly content
delivery only. 
News Corp. (NWS) (part ownership of Hulu) - most evil of them all. Murdock is crazy and is living in the past. Also is
uber conservative and will limit content. Once signed up I see price hikes. 
Time Warner (TWX, TWC) (cable, HBO, etc.) - this is the company that bought AOL right? Yep they are the FUTURE!
Delivery? Network? 
Comcast (CMCSA) (cable, NBC Universal, part ownership of Hulu) - Evil with their delivery and will get smacked for
their high price. Use them for internet only let NetFlix do the rest. Keep cost low. On Demand is a contender, but only
if you have cable. I see more people cutting the cord and moving straight to Netflix.  
Coinstar's Redbox (CSTR) - no internet delivery.


Disclosure - I do not have a Netflix position or a position in any of the above companies.


Netflix delivers, does not try to bundle, simply provides content and it works. The cost is low (lowest in class) and is
the first real option for a-la-carte programming on demand at a reasonable price. Even Hulu + was price disciplined by
Netflix. Netflix so far is the good guy among the above mentioned bunch. So long as Netflix does no evil I see
customer loyalty remaining high. Loyalty will remain especially high among people who do not want to bundle

services, want to save money and like a simple product that works. Will the price drop off a bit in Netflix, sure maybe.
Do I see others starting to eat Netflix lunch? Not in the short term. I can watch streaming Netflix on my iPhone, Wii,
Computer or by old school DVD. Pick someone from the list above that lets me do that for a reasonable flat fee.


Only short option I see is if Congress chickens out on Net Neutrality and just give the internet providers a monopoly.

And you will continue to lose money!


NFLX's big play will be international as it brings western content to the masses of Asia and India. Hey, for a few

[yes Virginia - BlackBerries are the preferred device as they work great on G2 networks and are a less expensive
alternative - people buy their phones outright and shun the expensive and unnecessary iPhones and Androids - no
providers subsidizing 2 year contracts here]


Just had to get that across - now back to NFLX.


The potential is too great - once the masses are hooked on cheap thrills, they will never let go. First to market WINS!

I am interested to know why enter a short position in NFLX when the price is being driven by the buyers? Very likely
you will be proved right one day, but why not capitalise on the current bullish trend, then enter your short position
once it significantly reverses? I cannot fathom why investors do all this analysis and hold these 'tough' positions
against the trend when they could keep it simple and benefit from basic price drivers - powerful buying will give you an
uptrend, powerful selling develops the down trend...

I heavily bet on CROX at one time and the stock was driven down by shorts. I still bought some and these shares
finally doubled. However, I lost about 30% and could be worst loss in term of dollar amount. A lesson for
diversification for me.

The argument that Netflix's content is deficient, when compared with the current garbage on cable TV that we are
subjected to on a nightly basis makes your argument about content ludicrous. All that mumbo jumbo cash flow
analysis is pure fiction, though it might impress a boy scout, as long as they have exponential sales growth the stock
will be overpriced. And since nobody else has been able to aggregate content and deliver it as cheaply, there is no
competition yet.

Very in-depth analysis of the fundamentals of this stock, the best I have seen. I agree the stock is overvalued given its
growing list of potential heavy-hitter competitors in the streaming business..


I had a long position in this stock for a substantial time but am out of it now. I agree it is way overvalued relative to its
future growth prospects However, I don't have the guts to short it. When the market is in an uptrend as continues to
be the case, shorting is going against the wind of the market, that is a significant force.


Also the current environment of zero interest rates and a world flooded with new liquidity is the perfect environment
for growth stocks like NFLX to take on a value far greater than they otherwise would as momentum investors continue
to jump onto anything that has been moving up. It is the bubble mentality and its fuel is easy money. Eventually NFLX
will break down heavily just as overvalued tech stocks did in 200-2002 but you can get killed being short in the
meantime. Especially since there are few signs the Fed is anywhere near ready to ease up on the throttle of the
money machine.

The price is ridiculously high and you do have some good facts in the article. But many of these items really are
throwing in the kitchen sink arguments. First sale doctrine – they would have been out of business by a good legal
team from MGM 9 years ago. Bandwidth consumption - they pay for their bandwidth in order to do the streaming. If
we start measuring bandwidth then every online company is screwed. I do not think the entire concept of net neutrality
is going to be reversed so you can short Netflix. And all these companies will want more for their content, well I hope
these PhD’s who negotiated that deal didn’t miss the first day of financial modeling class. In your effort to see this as a
short you have missed everything that has made them successful. 
They understand their 17M customers which are not interesting enough to mention in your very long article. For $8, if I
can only watch 17% of the top 100 films is one of your arguments, for a the average family of 4 having 17% of the top
content is more than adequate? If it wasn't how would they have 17M subs?  
But the better question is: What would this cost me on Apple? Or another streamer? At $5 a pop? 17 x $5 or $85. For
less than $20 this family can have a combo of DVDs and streaming, can you watch the movie again on Apple? The

consumers that want to buy the DVD/BluRay always have that option; most of the normal families could care less
about owning which is why rentals are so popular in the first place. Having a Netflix subscription does not preclude
you from plopping down $5 for the new, new release right from your cable box, which is 100% more convenient than
Itunes, Hulu or any other provider and magically appears on your cable bill. This compliments Netflix without losing a
subscriber. 
Moreover, Netflix is actually missing out on this revenue by not giving you the option to watch that movie for an
additional $5. As for the argument they are going to have to pay or lose their library we all heard this one before,
screw the content providers let them keep their aging worthless content. I never thought in the age of DVRs people
would buy TV shows, if they don’t want to make it available they lose. If you do not need to reach these $20M subs
then bye-bye. According to you they only have 17% of the "good stuff" available so they have already proved that
people do not care. Redbox understands their customers too, they provide convenience. Will Netflix crash and burn,
absolutely! When? I read the first reports 3 years ago from Chanos.


17 Dec 2010, 01:39 PM


thestockjunkie
I think this article makes a number of solid points and it probably is a better short than long but I will make the
following observations that I think the author missed:


Apple let Netflix onto the Apple TV platform. That speaks huge volumes about how strong a position Netflix has. If
there was any way for Apple to go it alone without Netflix they would have. With Netflix on Apple, Xbox, Wii, PS3, etc
they have more than reached critical mass and a moat that will be very difficult if not impossible to replicate, all in a
recurring revenue model with high growth.


Consumers love Netflix streaming. I believe this makes the current subscribers far more sticky then when they were a
DVD only business and this puts into question the subscriber analysis he runs thru that says they have to add 47mil
subs to net 16.9. On 47 mil subs they will retain far more in my opinion.


The author doesn't understand the Netflix consumer mindset. Netflix is a success because it is drop dead simple for
the consumer. The consumer loves its flat monthly plan, the consumer loves instant access to thousands of movies
and shows and they consumer doesn't care much about the strength of the streaming content. If the consumer wants
premium content they can still order the DVD's and if they are just bored they have streaming all for a flat $10. Netflix
is by far the best $10 I spend per month on entertainment. In addition my usage of streaming is INCREASING after
many months of usage, not decreasing as the author claims. Perhaps he hasn't used the service. If not I would
recommend he try it before making it his largest short.


Netflix creates new revenue for media companies. I'll give you an example. Have you ever watched Nip/Tuck? Well
when it was on TV I certainly never watched one episode. One night I was surfing Netflix and threw it on. I have since
watched the entire series in a period of about 2 months. That 7 seasons of shows in two months. I could never do this
with a cable subscription number one, which is another reason I love Netflix, but I also never would have watched it
AT ALL without Netflix. Netflix is giving media producers a 2nd life on their content in a way that is extremely lucrative
to the studio. This completely contradicts Whitney's point of view.


Yes, the media giants are now scared of Netflix but what are they going to do about it (other than increase licensing
fees)? They have created a monster that they can only hope to contain. They will never be a Netflix because they

won't share content at reasonable prices with each other. In addition no one is interested in watching and paying for
multiple different services which is their only solution. The problem is, now they ALL want to be a Netflix but none of
them will let the other get away with that. Google isn't going to let Apple be the next Netflix. Same for Amazon, or
HBO, or Disney, or...on and on. I don't want a Hulu subscription, a HBO subscription, Youtube subscription, etc. I want
a one stop shop. Drop dead simple. That's Netfllix. If I REALLY want to pay for that premium movie via Apple,
Amazon, whatever. Ok, I might do that. Once a year. That's a completely different model and one that simply doesn't
work. I will not pay $4.99 for a movie that will eventually end up on Netflix when I have a library of thousands of
movies I haven't seen at my finger tips.


Netflix is not leading to cord cutting (yet). If you read the tech blogs the truth is the best way to watch tv is still cable
for your money. You can't get live sporting events on Netflix and as long as thats the case cable will reign supreme for
quite some time still.


While it is true that the margins will likely be squeezed it is also probably true that growth assumptions are too low,
especially now that they have added Disney content.


Netflix might not be Amazon, but they are not the Albanian army either. That's just a terrible analogy (admittedly not
by Whitney but he did highlight it). If Netflix were a studio or cable company this analogy might apply. Netflix if more
comparable to "terrorist" organization in relation to the "army" of media companies its competing against. Their
business model is completely unique and came up from under the radar with a surprise attack on the media army. It
was totally unexpected and unorthodox, much like a terrorist.


Margins will come down. It is probably too expensive. However, I have no interest in shorting such a dangerous
company at this point.

Actually it doesn't contradict anything. Netflix is creating new "market" for Media companies, not so much new
"revenues." Thats the core of the problem. Starz basically signed up to what it thought was small incremental

correctly price the assets since Netflix has shown how much it is worth. THats at the core of his argument,

by dealing with Netflix and they have come to that understanding and are starting to place Netflix in a box.


28 Dec 2010, 10:50 AM


Robert H. Heath, Contributor
Mr. Tilson -


A very nice, frank and thoughtful analysis.


I do think you overlooked one critical analysis, which I suspect will support your investment conclusion.


If you look at the history of move rentals in the United States since the late 80's, you have a long period in which you
can estimate the aggregate enterprise valuation that has been attributed to (nearly) 100% of the video rental
distribution system. During most of the last decade, Blockbuster, Movie Gallery (plus Hollywood Video), Netflix and
more recently, RedBox have accounted for the lion's share of direct-to-home video rental. Independent mom-and-
pops account for maybe 10% to 20%.


The total revenue associated with home video rental has been relatively steady (in the range of $8 to $10 billion) for
several years. It stands to reason that the aggregate revenue, profit and enterprise valuation of those companies who
act as middlemen between the studios and consumers would be relatively constant as well.


At the moment I don't have access to historical market data on defunct companies like Hollywood and Movie Gallery
(and I'll let your analysts pore over old 10-Q's) but I think the analysis will support a thesis that NFLX's current
valuation assumes that they will "run the table" on home video distribution, an unlikely outcome given the
concentrated power of the studios and their fear of creating a dominant distribution channel like Blockbuster once was
in the brick-and-mortar world and iTunes now is for music in the digital realm.


Good luck.

endoftheworld
Raison d'etre for Netflix is same as similar to that for iTunes - a SIMPLE one stop shop for your video needs. Granted,
it may not have the latest movies, but it has enough content, and eventually the movies get there. I guess its
consumers are more patient - they just wait a few months until the 9.99 or 4.99 movie available on pay-per-view
simply gets added to the library. Do not underestimate the simplicity of the interface. Valuation is another matter
altogether, but the business model is viable. Smart content providers realize its usefulness as a distribution channel. It
provides as much value add as iTunes does. Who'd have thunk a technically updated walkman imitator would forge

17 Dec 2010, 01:50 PM


Big DD
In regards to the content providers demanding more for streaming content, you make the assumption that they can
continue this practice. However, the profit maximizing price is clearly lower. The MC of allowing Netflix to stream a
movie is zero (0) to the content provider. Consumers are not flocking to pay $4.99 for a video they have to stream to
their DVR. They would rather just wait a few days and get it mailed to them from Netflix. Netflix has the pricing correct,
the marginal price = the marginal cost, the content providers do not have this correct yet and I expect the content
providers to start charging less.


I still think NFLX is overvalued, though I am afraid to short it.


17 Dec 2010, 02:06 PM

Mr. Tilson,


Great analysis but why short stock AND long puts? That's what we call a "Texas Hedge". In order to put a cap on your
potential loss you could by an OTM call and sell an OTM put around your short stock. A shorter dated call and a
longer dated put can generate a (close to) zero-cost "short" risk reversal where the put strike is further OTM than the
call strike. You'll do fine on the way down but won't get taken to the woodshed on these hard moves to the upside.

Thanks for the great article. It is rare to read an article on Seeking Alpha where genuine insight into an industry is
provided for readers. The fundamental difference between the economics of streaming and delivery of physical DVDs
was not something I was aware of previously, having not studied this industry in any level of depth. While I do not
short stocks, it seems to me that the short thesis presented here has a great deal of merit. Nevertheless I can see
why some are reluctant to short the stock of a business providing a much loved service to many loyal fans. It is no
doubt easier to make a short case where accounting fraud or bankruptcy risks exist.

You list other providers that have more content, 
BUT you didn't say what they charge.


Cable co. sent me an offer yesterday, 
Only $110 a month for a $160/mo service.


And that has junk channels and ads.


Netflix is like Walmart, the low cost provider, 
and they could double their price and still have appeal.


You talk about Netflix costs and amortization, 
you don't mention there's a salvage value to these DVD's 
most of the big DVD sellers on Ebay probably get supply 
from Netflix.


"carriers like AT&T and Comcast will have to invest billions of dollars"


Not sure where this is coming from, 
a few years ago I read that so much fiber optic was laid 
that ONLY 2% of capacity is USED!


ATT has 3 different price levels for broadband, 
more likely they'll charge the end user for high use 
rather than Netflik paying.


"renting another company's content over and over again without compensation if the delivery mechanism is the
internet, why should this principle be any different if the delivery mechanism is a DVD?"


The difference is that they can stream to 1000 different people the 
same thing every night. 
With a physical DVD only one person can watch it that week, 
taking into account postal delivery time.


Some important things you left out: 
1. How many stock options are being larded out to management? 
2. Insider sales.


Disclosure: Never been long or short, but may go short next year.


My mistakes in shorting have always that I've been too early, 
better to be patient.

T2 is way more bullish than I am about NetFlix. T2 is assuming that NetFlix will continue to be able to license content.
They are also assuming that NetFlix is only competing with other transmission services. With the advent of fully
internet capable televisions and other devices, any content provider can stream directly to the viewer and capture
100% of the revenue. Granted there would be an increased cost of revenue related to the infrastructure and billing
costs. At a minimum, NetFlix's margins will get crushed. Another big risk to NetFlix is the potential demise of net
neutrality. Right now NetFlix is freeriding on bandwith controlled by competitors. Look at the model the cell phone
companies are using to limit bandwith use after witnessing AT&T's problems with the I-Phone. If cable cos. and telcos
were to start using a per mB charge the cost for an individual NetFlix subscriber could skyrocket, reducing demand
dramatically. The key question is why in a decentralized information and content enviroment would a major content
provider with an established brand need to cede economics to an aggregator? I would recommend buying long dated
puts/put spreads.

should see TV monitors in the market with built in internet and setaming features that woudl eliminate the need for

Cable is in trouble too. The paradigm shift in content delivery will force their prices down perhaps even forcing
them to offer a la carte pricing to consumers. But the reason to be negative on NetFlix stock is that while the
value proposition for consumers may be compelling, the ability of the company to produce earnings growth to
support a 68X P/E ratio is suspect based on the competitive dynamics of the industry.


17 Dec 2010, 06:40 PM


psweeting
Very interesting and thorough analysis but I'd quibble with a couple of points:


1) Netflix offers a very different value proposition from Apple/Amazon/Blockbuster, etc. They're not really direct
competitors (if they were the Netflix app would not be available on Apple TV) so you may be overstating the impact of
competition on Netflix's future growth and margins.


2) Netflix is marketing a service, not content. Always has been. While content is important, I think you're overstating
the weakness of Netflix's current offering. Netflix was never the fastest way to get the most current movies; new
releases almost always involved a long wait. If immediate access is important, you'd do much better going to
Blockbuster (or Wal-Mart). Yet Netflix managed to thrive and grow anyway. I think that speaks to the value consumers
see in convenient, unlimited access at a flat price, which I don't see changing in the near term.


3) You don't mention subscriber acquisition costs in your analysis, which is one metric that stands to improve
significantly for Netflix over time. It's streaming app is now available on over 200 models of connected devices, from
HDTV sets to Blu-ray players and iPads (and of course Apple TV). In most cases, it has prime real estate on the
device's home page. That's leading to a fair number of activations that cost Netflix virtually nothing, which is one
reason SAC fell 26 percent between Q3 2009 to Q3 2010, from $27 per sub to $20.


That said, I agree with your basic point that Netflix's content costs are likely to grow faster than it can find savings
elsewhere (postage, SAC, fulfillment). That will likely lead to margin compression, unless Netflix is able to raise
prices.


17 Dec 2010, 06:00 PM


James Emerson, Contributor
So do you pay a premium multiple 68x to own a business with declining margins? Think about what that
multiple implies for expected earnings growth. Right now the stock is a game of musical chairs, you do not
want to be long when the music stops.

@psweeting


I agree on all.. my 2 cents on the margin compression is it might not be as big a deal as supposed. DVD costs
will invariably drop as streaming becomes a bigger part of business model, also subs base is bound to rise
with improved library. I can't seem them paying excessively for old content. At least to the point of materially
impacting margins.

@viewfromnyc:


Dont get me wrong i agree you have to do your due diligence but multiples are not a science. Whilst they can
be helpful to the overall analysis, they are not absolutes. Wanna short some CRM?


As for declining margins - every co. has breathers..it is up to you to ascertain the magnitude and potential
impact of the decline. Buying better content that might ultimately grow subs strikes me as a positive trade off.


19 Dec 2010, 04:14 PM


James Emerson, Contributor
@provectus 
The difference between CRM and NFLX is that CRM has a business model that might work and the potential
to grow into its multiple. Many commentators here have confused the value proposition of a NetFlix
subscription with the potential for a perpetually parabolic stock price. I subscribe and get enough value for my
$10 that I won't cancel right now, but I think the product is mediocre. But that is mostly irrelevant to an
analysis of the competitive forces in the market and the valuation of the stock. I think that the stock is priced
for unrealistic growth. Stock prices don't remain high on momentum alone. That premium multiple has to be
supported initially by growth prospects and then by actual growth in earnings. I think there will be a point fairly
soon that the company will fail to deliver on its growth prospects and the stock price will plummet. My target is
roughly 15x-17x EPS which implies a price in the 40's. The risk reward in this trade is skewed toward being
short. Even if I'm wrong, there isn't that much potential upside. It is not one of the all time great shorts
because I don't think that the company will go out of business and NFLX doesn't have a debt level that would
lead to bankruptcy.

Great post, Whitney. I have been curious about Netflix business model and your writeup was beyond anything I had
expected to find, in terms of both data and analysis. 
Your one assumption that I'm uncertain about is the rate of acquiring new customers. A lot of folks-- even among
Netflix subscribers-- are only now becoming aware of the "magical" reality and ease of the streaming service. Word of
mouth can build up new subscribers quickly, even among former users who found the DVD mailing too clunky. That
"recapture" could provide some near term tailwind and for a lot of folks the $8/month is not prohibitive for a stand-by
entertainment source. 
I was amazed at the content provider and media aspect of this story and believe your analysis is spot on. The only
positive for those industry managements is that Netflix has seeded the market, likely accelerating future earnings for
content providers. 
Thanks for your contribution and thanks even more for your contributions to education reform.

I think that your analysis has missed a key concept and quite possibly the main reason for the high valuation of
Netflix. The bet investors are making is that Netflix is a game changer, like iTunes and Amazon. iTunes changed the
game because they make it possible for me to buy only the songs l like instead of buying a bunch of OK songs on a
CD to get the song that I liked. The music CD is like my cable TV subscription. On my cable, I have probably 75
movies to watch right now. There are a few movies on right now I know that I like and I have seen many of them 5 or
6 times, because 1) they play over and over on cable and 2) I like them. But there is quite likely one movie playing
now on cable that have not seen, but I would like it too if I watched it. But I have no idea which one it is. With Netflix,
they can tell me which movies that I might like, make easy for me to select it and start watching it. And most of the
time, their suggestions are good (and getting better). Problem solved--a movie that I like to watch when I am ready to
watch it. The move industry, like the music industry, creates a lot of crap every year. But my crap is your favorite. Go
figure. So Netflix, like Amazon, has software for making recommendations. Netflix is not a movie distributor; Netflix is
a software company that helps you find what you want to watch and then streams it to you. And movie makers will
one day sell to Netflix like music makers sell to iTunes, because people want what they like. That's the bet.

Any assertion that Google is run by incompetents is laughable. Your extreme vitriol towards those who have analyzed
this stock and come up with a conclusion counter to yours says more about you then it does about them or the stock.
You seem to want to see this debate as black and white, good and evil. Jamie, this is about financial speculation, not
about attacking those who hold differing views. I suppose it doesn't occur to you that many of those who are inclined
to take the bear argument seriously are merely investors/speculators, just like you? They are not members of some
covert society out to destroy you or America or apple pie. They are individuals who have opinions about companies
and their prospects and sometimes back those opinions with hard cash. Undoubtedly many of those who have
shorted NFLX are net long the market. Your last post makes you appear to be the pot that calls the kettle black. Your
last post also leaves one with the impression you would like nothing better than to silence and obliterate the opinions
of those who disagree with you on this matter.

I believe that could be true - I haven't verified it. My point is, there are a lot of extremely emotional folks that
clearly lose control if someone says something they disagree with about a stock they are in love with. I don't
care one way or another. To me it is just an amusing indicator.


But some of these characters get hysterical and take personal shots. Some even accuse short-sellers of
being un-patriotic! That kind of nonsense makes me smile, because it is so absurd. The screeching,
threatening (almost violent!) reaction almost always shows up when there is a real reason to be concerned.
Enron, Worldcom, Lehman, and a million other terminal situations had these frenzied, manic defenders... right
up to the end. Heck, I bet there were even some of those howling about the scrutiny Bernie Madoff was under
being unfair, unjustified, whatever.


When CEOs wade into the discussion, talking about their stock being undervalued, bear attacks, etc., it just
reminds me of Ken Lay. They're better off just not even talking about the stock price and/or short-sellers. It
just seems to many of us like they are protesting too hard, focusing on something out of their control (rather
than running the business), and that they have something to hide. But maybe I'm just a "glass-is-half-empty"
skeptic. Maybe all of the above are true.


The truth is, asking questions and even presenting a short-thesis, cannot cause a stock's price to go down.
The only thing that can do that is the absence of bids.

"Netflix's core DVD-based business model is rapidly shrinking as customers shift rapidly to streaming content."


FAIL ON THAT.


The flaw in your logic mister. Cover that short! In fact, as evidenced by the SLOW adoption of FiOS by Verizon
customers, the "last mile" problem is alive and well. If you want to spend an hour or more downloading a DVD with
your DSL modem, be my guest. Most people don't have that kind of patience.


But long long term, in say 10 to 20 years, then yes everybody will have FiOS and the last mile problem will be solved,
and Netflix will be toast.


And streaming without first downloading or buffering substantially is not a pleasant user experience--unless you like
low-res and not being able to skip parts of the movie you don't like or fast forward.

Lightway: If you were reading my comment correctly, you would have noted that it was a prediction for next year at
this time. If NFLX is using 20% of the bandwidth in prime time now, it will be using much more then. 66% of users
downloaded at least one show/movie. The streaming usage of those users might likely double by next year at this
time. Plus NFLX is saying they are going to approx. double the number of users. NFLX intends for most of these new
users to be streaming users. This likely means the actual amount of NFLX traffic would be 2 to 4 fold higher during

I used to live in the Bay Area (CA, USA). I new of few if any upgrades to cable systems while I was there. The new
developments may have gotten new systems, but that's about it. If the Silicon Valley isn't upgrading, not may are. I
don't know where you got your information, but it doesn't sound very accurate. A lot of housing is 20-50 years old or

For me, I look at risk/reward. I am a bit it both camps on the fundamentals (short term neutral, long term bearish) but I
will wait for the technicals to be a bit more in my favor. I have learned that to be right but early, is the same as being

Calculate your gain or loss and real return when you close a transaction. It doesn't matter how low you might
have bought or how high you could have sold. In this game, rightness and wrongness are math based, not on

For tax purposes you can count your gains and losses on closed positions. For institutions gains and losses
should be marked to market. Bottom line, Mr Tilson has unrecognized losses with no guarantees for ever
making a profit


Not arguing with you, just a different philosophy on performance.You can have a great income statement with
closed positions but a lousy balance sheet on your open positions. Ask the banks about that.

Reeve Porter
closing my short position after this


18 Dec 2010, 09:24 PM


rsu82
NFLX is now a brand name and has some traction by being embedded in many devices. That being said I do believe
their margins will fall. They will either have to up their monthly service charge or limit the number of movies that can
be downloaded. If you up the monthly service they may lose a few customers.


For those who believe NFLX can do unlimited streaming at $8 then you also must believe that Time Warner and the
other cable companies will reduce their VOD movie rentals to $1. I say that because the cable companies typically
have to give 50% of the revenue of a VOD movie to the content owner. Also the content provider usually sets the
price of the content. As Netflix eats away at the cable companies VOD profits they will ask the content owners for the
same deal the content owner are giving Netflix.


I think it will be the other way around. The content owners will now ask Netflix to pay the same price they are charging
the cable companies. That means Netflix will have to pay $1 to $2 dollars per streamed movie....even for old dusty
content (okay...maybe just 50 cents). If this happens and a subscriber watches 5 or 6 movies in a month then Netflix
will lose money on a $8/month customer.


I know....I worked at a telecommunication company that streamed content. We typically had to pay the content
provider 50% of the revenue and this was before taxes.


We also had a couple of monthly unlimited streaming channels. Very little profit margins for the telecom company
because after giving the content provider 50% of the revenue the bandwidth cost ate up most of the other 50%
revenue. In some cases a subscriber would use so much bandwidth it was actually costing the telecom company
money to keep that subscriber.

I partially agree with you, Margins might be squeezed.. Where I don't is the expectation of pricing elasticity yet
the subscriber base to be static. As well as the discounting of the subsequent costs of DVD purchases to
decrease. This might mitigate squeeze somewhat, how much I don't know, but it doesn't seem as dire as
made out. 
Remember, t his is a two pronged attack - DVD AND streaming...

This is a very well written rationale for Mr. Tilson's short, and whilst I can see the merits in the points he raised, there
are many more that have not been raised, and I believe many in the blog has raised them. I commend this post as
"this is what makes a market", someone has to buy and someone has to sell. I agree that NFLX "appears" overvalued
and I use the term appears because it is being viewed through biased and prejudiced lenses and is in essence a
judgment call. Given Mr. Tilson's track record, his judgment and insight rightly or wrongly carries some weight.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 71/98


That being said, I would no more short NFLX than I would short GOOG, as I have no crystal ball.  
I would like to add though that in all the valuations I read so far, everyone assumes a static subs base, if at one point
NFLX had 40MM+ subs as assumed(I am a return sub - I have young kids that have become fixated on certain
characters and it's great to be able have that character"on demand") then "supposedly" they left due to the "weak"
library. Isn't it then likely that they would return with a " stronger" library?. In terms of a competitor/s, imho I do not see
any unless another 3rd party gets involved and then they would be subject to the same hurdles as NFLX. I do not
believe a content provider can be a viable competitor, as every provider will their want pride of place for their content
and revenue sharing would be a humbug because not all libraries are created equal. Just as HarperCollins and
MacGrawHill would not be able to create a bookseller to compete with Amazon or Barnes&Noble. Another caveat is
this article solely assumes American growth, should NFLX expand into Asia or Europe or both, I believe management
would not mind some margin compression in the short term. All companies experience this, the question I would ask
is what magnitude of margin compression would lead to significant fall off in the stock price? I would pose dependent
on entry and subsequent run up, many shorts are now seeking a dramatic breakdown in the growth story to provide
appropriate "compensation". I don't believe increased pricing for content would provide that breakdown. Finally, I
believe we are in a new market place, we have no idea how long the market would be depressed, the consumer is
moving away from the "instant gratification" mentality and as such "28 days wait time" isn't that bad especially as you
may still receive it through DVD mail. The consumer likes simplicity, going to one place for movies, TV shows,
documentaries, et al. and right now that place is NFLX. I don't see that changing substantially in the next 2 years. 
Disclaimer - I have no position in NFLX, but it is on my watchlist.

Our house has been happy with Netflix for some time especially the software that reminds us about movies we
missed that we would like or tells us about movies we never heard of that we would like. We get the DVDs fast and
stream when we want to. Ergo no trips to the movie theatre or rental store in years.


However, from the individual investor standpoint the best plan has been to buy then sell, pocketing the profit and
moving on spending as little time as possible on regretting missing the absolute top or the eventual sell off as
competition in streaming video cancels out the domination of the declining DVD rental business. NFLX will be a cash
cow for years but not at this valuation and the timing is too hard for this amateur. The market can stay irrational far
longer than this little guy can stay solvent although I have no doubt Whitney can calculate better and wait longer.

Good comments and interesting article. Netflix is right to charge a base fee for streaming content. That is the right
model and why people are bullish on them. They are ahead of the curve on this. Others are slow or delinquent to
follow even though it is the future (much like music).


However, their content is weak and the media is breeding both competitors and fighting the inevitable trend. It may not
work out for Netflix. In the meantime, they are still also dependent on their DVD disk maining business which should
be heavily discounted on their valuation. Because of this, they are probably over-valued. You only pay high multiples
for the new streaming content, not the garbage legacy DVD business that is doomed.

Other than that, I have been bullish on Netflix but see, like their CFO, many hurdles including their potential inability to
remain on top of their streaming business. I put technology advances as #1. As far as I can tell they are having
scalability problems and their service can suffer as a consequence. They actually need a tie up with an advanced
Internet service provider which may be costly in terms of their demands for an equitable relation in terms of their
customer's bandwith demands.


19 Dec 2010, 04:57 PM

The only "true" competitor would another third party "reseller". As the content providers would not know how
to structure a viable alternative vehicle never mind a platform. And the issues that you ascribe to NFLX would
be present for any competitor.


I think this is natural technological progression, betamax to cloud content streaming. To date only NFLX has
the branding. HULU brand is TV shows as its movie database is possibly worse than NFLX and thats run by
the content providers.


Lets go with your garbage legacy DVD business premise - if DVDs go away, NFLX is already integrating in TV
systems, Gaming systems, Computer systems - they are ahead of the curve in anticipating that move...


For the time being I think NFLX is well positioned, should they do a blockbuster and rest on the laurels
then...all bets are off

Nice thorough article. I think the growth rate slows upon higher 'pipe' costs hitting NFLX or its subscribers and
competitive offerings emerge. In addition margins compress as content costs rise substantially, especially if
subscriber growth can't keep pace for the reason above.

Not to brag, but I bought in at $59 and change this time last year and that puts me at 200%, looking at the possibility
of 300%. I missed the boat last spring like you, but for a different reason, I failed to buy NFLX Jan12 75 call contracts
when someone could have gotten them for about $1000.00 each.


Now NFLX will no doubt experience some corrections, as it already has on its upward trend, and I would like to be
there with some Put contracts I bought ahead of time, but it doesn't seem to me that anyone will be able to make as
much money long term on this company on the Bear side as they will on the Bull side.


I mean, how deep a correction, and for how long? What specific timetable of events next year?

"we we think the valuation is extreme and that the rapid shift of its customers to streaming content (vs. mailing DVDs
to customers) isn't the beginning of an exciting, highly-profitable new world for Netflix, but rather the beginning of the
end of its incredible run."


I simply disagree.


Also the assessment of Netflix's content as 'weak' made me literally laugh out loud. Every reason given as a
weakness is a strength to me. Oh well, people love to hate on a winner. And so it goes....

I thought the analysis excellent, but not one person mentioned in response that Netflix may simply start charging
higher subscription rates for a more complete library of titles (or introduce tiered streaming subscription)? I would
certainly pay $30-$50 per month to disconnect the cable box completely and I am not even a movie buff. An average
cable bill is probably closer to a $100/mnth now, there's a lot of re-pricing that could fit in-between the current $8
streaming plan and the monthly Time Warner bill.

I think this will help: 
"We depend on studios and distributors to license us content that we can stream instantly over the Internet.


Streaming content over the Internet involves the licensing of rights which are separate from and independent of the
rights we acquire when obtaining DVD content. Our ability to provide our subscribers with content they can watch
instantly therefore depends on studios and distributors licensing us content specifically for Internet delivery. The
license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. If the studios and distributors change their terms
and conditions or are no longer willing or able to provide us licenses, our ability to stream content to our subscribers
will be adversely affected. Unlike DVD, streaming content is not subject to the First Sale Doctrine. As such, we are
completely dependent on the studio or distributor providing us licenses in order to access and stream content. Many
of the licenses provide for the studios or distributor to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of
these provisions as well as other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on
short notice. For example, in December 2008, certain content associated with our license from the Starz Play service
was withdrawn on short notice. In addition, the studios have great flexibility in licensing content. They may elect to
license content exclusively to a particular provider or otherwise limit the types of services that can deliver streaming
content. For example, HBO licenses content from studios like Warner Bros. and the license provides HBO with the
exclusive right to such content against other subscription services, including Netflix. As such, Netflix cannot license
certain Warner Bros. content for delivery to its subscribers while Warner Bros. may nonetheless license the same
content to transactional VOD providers. If we are unable to secure and maintain rights to streaming content or if we
cannot otherwise obtain such content upon terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to stream movies and TV
episodes to our subscribers will be adversely impacted, and our subscriber acquisition and retention could also be
adversely impacted. During the course of our license relationship, various contract administration issues can arise. To
the extent that we are unable to resolve any of these issues in an amicable manner, our relationship with the studios
and distributors or our access to content may be adversely impacted. "

Very good analysis and thanks for posting your thesis. Seems obvious the stock is overvalued. I personally like shorts
where there is a clear income statement/cash flow statement discrepency. (ie, CF lower than what the IS would
suggest).


I had a couple of questions:


1) You say that "Acquisition of streaming content library" was a cash outflow of $115.1 million, up 74.1% from the
previous quarter's $66.2 million and up 11.5x year-over-year (from $10 million)." Was there some unusual one-time

payment with Disney/Epix/Starz that would cause a short term spike? I found nothing in the 10Q. Further, on a NINE
month basis this year, it seems Acquisition of streaming content" was $232mm, vs "Amortization of content library"
around $205mm, not as big a discrepency.


2) Does the Epix contract fully expire in 10 months? That is, are there any extension options for Netflix at pre-agreed
upon rates?


3) have you considered a case whereby, they raise rates to say $10 to $20/month, some kind of tiered pricing plan.
They could grow by more than 30% in this kind of scenario still.


Just trying to figure out the downside to the short. Personally I find the comments here illustrate how much consumers
love the service. There seems quite a bit of confusion over 1) the stock's valuation, and 2) the service they provide.
Clearly its a very good product and will continue to grow. However, I did not read any comments refuting your case
with a reasoned bull argument that clearly states the stock is worth $250-300 per share. (my downside case was that
it trades at 15x next years EBITDA, which could be as high as $850mm, for a stock price of $236/share).


Best of luck.

Your assumptions bank on cable and the other high priced villains will dominate the media world. As for myself I
cannot see spending 45 to 55 dollars a month on the stuff of cable.  
Others may have the same take. So the big media companies above may have to respect where the users are
actually. How can they charge more if the users are not there? Netflix will have the advantage.  
But if the fat cats can regulate the band width to charge extra that may cause users to rebel against such a scenario.
Most users are already ticked off about this.  
I have retreated myself, to digital antenna and windows 7 dvr function. Good bye cable.  
You may have to beware rebel companies who will join the rebels and not have the bandwidth caps. Beware bear.

It is apparent that you have to be cool either while you are losing money or making it. I noticed that using simulations I

Mr. Tilson,


I respect your position, but I believe you entirely miss the point with respect to content. I find the Netflix
recommendation engine to be among the greatest competitive strengths--far more important than *how much* content
they offer.


I don't care that my cable provider provides hundreds of movies via video-on-demand including most major releases.
When I sit down with my wife in front of the tv in the evening, we want to find something we haven't seen before that
we will enjoy and we want to find it fast. Scrolling through many pages of films listed alphabetically by genre (as
presented by our cable provider) is not helpful. It takes a long time to find something that "sounds like" it might be
interesting, and more often than not, we end up disappointed.


Netflix solves this problem. We rate everything we see, and Netflix then magically tells us whether or not we will like
any other movie. And it is usually right. I find it much more rewarding, as happened last week, to load up Netflix and
see that it thinks we would rate an obscure El Salvadoran movie (Innocent Voices) between four and five stars. We
look no further and fire it up. Guess what? It was an extraordinarly moving and fascinating film. What a rewarding
discovery. I don't know what anyone else would think of it, but the point is that the world is certainly "flattening" as
Thomas Friedman has suggested; great content can more easily be created almost anywhere (just look at how movie
production is now exploding in far-flung places such as Mumbai and Lagos); and Netflix will find what you will enjoy
(whatever that may be) from among a rapidly expanding selection, regardless of how many Hollywood blockbusters it
may offer.


One last point, we sometimes go months without exchanging our mail-delivered DVDs. Before we ordered a Roku
player, we tended to frequently order movies via video-on-demand from our cable provider (as the particular Netflix
DVD's that we had in hand might not have fit what we were looking for on any given night). What we would do is flip
through the cable VOD offerings on screen with Netflix open on our computer so we could use Netflix to check
whether we would like any particular movie before ordering it. I was never tempted to cancel Netflix because, even if I
wasn't using it to watch movies, the use of Netflix to save me from a couple miserable evenings a month watching a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 77/98


film I wouldn't enjoy was easily worth $13 a month or whatever it was that we were paying. And now that we have a
Roku player to replace our reliance on cable VOD, we canceled our HBO subscription and extended cable package
(now having only basic cable)--it saves us ~$38 a month. And we can now find something we almost surely will enjoy
much more easily via Netflix--what a great deal for such a comparatively low price.


Amazon is the only competitor that even remotely approaches this level of customization and recommendation.
Though, to me, Amazon and Netflix are complimentary. If I am looking for something particular, I look to Netflix first; if
they don't have it, then I go to Amazon. And now that I have essentially programmed Netflix with my tastes, I realize it
would require a tremendous amount of work to try to transport my ratings (hundreds of films) to some other service--
talk about "sticky"!


I have been long Netflix since 2004 and haven't sold a share.

FCC will be voting on net neutrality on Tuesday. This is a huge decision (though largely already decided), and
hopefully Seeking Alpha will be carrying some type of coverage on this issue.


The proposal in its current form will require backbone providers (cable companies, telecomms) to treat all data
equally. This means that companies like Time-Warner will not be able to treat traffic from direct competitors like Netflix
differently (like jacking up their rates to try and run them out of business).


Not sure if Reed's response here has anything to do with the timing of that announcement, but net neutrality has been
on the table for nearly 10 years, and we will finally see some concrete law put into place.


20 Dec 2010, 10:55 PM

Yeah the proposed law also allows cable companies to charge companies more who are streaming movies.

"Transparent"? This letter article was tightly scripted and controlled, just like the conference calls where
questions have to be sent in, scrubbed and evaluated and then a scripted answer is prepared and read on
tape. That hardly is transparency. Perhaps, the two philanthropic 'pals' can have an open debate where they
sell tickets to public and raise money for their favorite charity. Better yet sell some ads to be played while
'debaters' take break to caucus with their advisors.

I ditched cable long ago because NFLX has more than I would ever want to watch *and* it costs 10% to 20% of the
cost of cable TV. I've long kept the 1 DVD at-a-time plan "just in case", but I've not watched the last DVD that I got in
over a year.


My desktop computer records HDTV over-the-air for my weekly dose of the NFL.


And that brings me to the part of Netflix that I can't quite decide about. At what point, if any, are they forced to attempt
to secure sporting event rights? Those are outrageously expensive and I frankly don't understand the economics that
allow the networks and ESPN to spend billions to deliver the NFL (or MLB, etc, etc, etc).


That having been said, I'd almost certainly pony up the dough if Netflix offered the equivalent of DirectTV's NFL
Sunday Ticket package.


Anyway, point being, when NFLX starts playing around with high-cost sporting events, I'm going to take a really hard
look at the margin impact.

Robert McDonald, Contributor
Why fool around shorting or buying Netflix when there are a lot of other more sure fire ways of making a buck without
all the worry and the hassle. Buy AAPL Jan 2012 LEAPS with $320 strike price for about $50 a share and collect $80
a share when the stock goes to $400 next year, a 60% return if it goes as can be reasonably expected. By
comparison buying or shorting Netflix at this point is a shot in the dark or as may be more commonly described, a
crap shoot.


PS: Apple is not building a huge server farm in North Carolina for no reason at all and they have money in the bank to
build many more around the world to deliver music, movies, books and cloud computing to all the iPHONES, Tablets
and MacBook Airs that they are selling. Jobs also knows the entertainment world (for example his key role in Pixar
and in Disney as board member). he also knows how to strike pretty good deals and has the leverage to do so. He
does not have to buy Netflix to participate in the streaming video business -- in fact that would be a low return
business decision in comparison.


22 Dec 2010, 06:49 PM


Robert McDonald, Contributor
PS: Your return may be greater if the stock goes to $400 and you sell the LEAP before expiration when it will also
have "time value."

Firstly, an explicit assumption the analysis has made is Netflix is facing saturation. It is implicit that Netflix is confined
to the north American markets. Netflix's addressable markets are global and this offers a substantial growth
opportunity - a fact which seems not to have been considered. Many countries have the income, the latent consumer
demand and excellent Internet infrastructure to enable Netflix to hit the ground running. This is a game changer,
especially given the growth and potential in emerging markets! BTW - many US stocks that have done well during the
GFC have heavy exposure offshore - a fact not lost on smart and outward looking CEOs and boards. 
Secondly, the pricing elasticity (sensitivity) may be higher than assumed. Even at $12 per month (a 50% increase to
offset increased expenses), this is still 'peanuts' (cheap) compared to most alternatives and on par with just one visit

loyalty.I literally refused to rent Inception and Town from Blockbuster the X-Mas becuase they wanted $10 for the

Interesting analysis. I think, however, it is off the mark as it relates to the reason Netflix is succeeding. The attraction
is not necessarily the current titles but the entirety of the Netflix library. The older movies, are almost certainly more
enjoyable than the current titles. Double ditto for TV. The consumer is not stupid. They know that everything is
available for free over the internet. They don't mind paying but realize that the cable networks are over charging. I've
noticed lately that premium movie channels such as HBO and SHOWTIME have very slim offerings. It seems the first
stop for most titles is VOD at $6.99 a pop. You mean I can get an entire month of Netflix for one VOD purchase? In
the end I suspect Netflix will begin to produce its own original TV programming. One hit and it will fuel subscriptions in
the way Sopranos did for HBO. Regardless, the game has changed. The notion that the dinosaur Hollywood Studios,
networks and cable concerns will hold on to their already stale economic models is a miscalculation. Just ask the
record industry.

you will win my vote if NFLX roll out those Netflix button (Ugly big) and it they are going to acquire StarZ. Don't like

Besides, I see unlimited of competitors to come in to dilute the market. 
Going to China...out of the question. 
Talk to Youku.com first.  
Go Europe, you got LoveFilm. 
US you have HULU and Youtube (GOOG) 
AMZN will use its Cloud structure streaming and new platform to share the same space with NFLX. I just don't see
any sort competitive edge. AMZN, AAPL & GOOG have loads loads of cash to burn.. 
Even Sears will take a bite of the limited size pie. Forget about selling drill bits...They are drilling into NFLX revenue.
Content cost will only go higher as so many players will bid for them. 
Mr. Hastings will spend every bit of his energy to defend every inch/cm of his hard fought earned space.

Realornot,


NFLX will have to deal with Lovefilm but they are really small potatoes right now and if you want to believe the
that Netflix has a bad all you can stream library, Lovefilm's is absolutely abysmal.


HULU has been losing the viewership battle to NFLX for sometime now and Google still hasn't figured how to
make Youtube profitable.


Sears service will be DOA.


None of the guys you mentioned are taking revenue from Netflix because they're approaching viewers from a
completely different angle. NFLX will be fine and even if you hate the big red cable button, they're going to
continue to be the only guys integrating themselves onto every single TV connected device. That's a pretty
significant moat in itself.


05 Jan 2011, 03:57 PM


Cherry Picker
Just what the world needs...another button on your remote. I can't help wondering if this is costing NFLX
precious cash on a partnering basis. Also the fact that this is going to be on 'select' remotes makes me
wonder just how select. The line up of brands is impressive, but how many TV's will actually be sold with this
button is another thing. I can't recall NFLX promoting and advertising anywhere near as heavily as they have
been in the past few weeks. In the past the product sold itself. Apparently NFLX realizes it has to push hard to
hit its numbers. I think this next quarterly report should be very interesting. Will Hastings blow the street away
again? Tough call.


05 Jan 2011, 04:10 PM


bassmaster general
I think it's keeping them one step (or in this case two steps) ahead of everyone else. While others still only
beginning to get integrated into devices through firmware upgrades of TV connected devices, Netflix is
already getting branded into the actual hardware.


It also doesn't look like it's going to be that limited - Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba, Dynex,
Haier, Memorex, Iomega and Roku are looking to add the one touch buttons to remotes for their TVs, Blu-ray
players and media streamers.

My sources are telling me that everyone (Company and their CEO) expected NFLX to fly on the "Curious Case of

on an even keel. NFLX loses big.


And today Comcast piled on with an app on the iPad that allows for streaming videos. Now that Comcast has it, look
for all of their cable buddies to have the same. NFLX loses big here.

The differentiator is still the content, content is king, content is queen and NFLX without content is a bloody moron.
NFLX has the medium to deliver the content, unfortunately for them that has become a comodity and it's going to hurt
them a little in the short term till all of their competitors catch up. Once they catch up the company, unless they do
something else, will cease to exist.


Who has more content? If you tell me it's NFLX, then IMO you should liquidate all your holdings and put the whole
thing into NFLX and go long.


I am short NFLX and i think it should be valued at about $60 to $85. That's my bet, I am not emotional about this. At
some point I may go long but am short for now.


Long/Short is part of the game and I do not work for NFLX and am not emotionally attached to NFLX in either way. I
am here to make money and hope to do that with the short I have in place at 182 something from yesterday.

Cisco has had cable boxes for quite a while that have allowed the cable companies to do just what you're

Thanks for the article, read it and shorted it. There was not much of DD left for me to do and honestly, (I can not
believe) that the CEO had to come in and post, IMO, very weak. Anyhow, thanks again.


I'd love for you to write an update with all of the new gadgets released at CES. The "Curious Case of Remote Button"
is more of a desperation, accessing Netflix has never been an issue, with new offerings, content will kill NFLX unless
they double the subscription fees or reduce the margins, in either case you win.


Today in Phoenix, addressing what he called “the elephant in the room,” Phil Kent singled out Netflix as the fly in the
ointment, that was funny. I do not know why everyone thinks that NFLX is formidable, they outsource everything and
all of it is replacable, no IP issues there, IMO.


CSCO announcement was a killer and Comcast PR was a dagger, now I am convinced that this is going down, I'll be
patient and be rewarded.


Again an update with some color on CES updates would be awesome.

Willing to bet Whitney is simply feeling out the investor public via this article. He has been long, is long, and gauging if
he should add to his position. He's simply not dumb enough to short this name. He knows even if his thesis is dead on

I am seeing more and more cracks below NFLX floor. The ceiling is getting harder and harder to reach the past days. 
another minor headlines just hit the wires today from Comcast... 
thegadgetnews.com/2011.../ 
Yesterday this stock is looking for a slight rebound and looking for a better support and follow thru today but it did not.
Instead it gaps down today. Sentiment is quite negative. 
Do you see some kind of writings on the wall?! 
The news on the magic one touch NFLX button on certain new remotes is not getting much positive reaction from the
market.  
So why is that? Could it be the cost of doing this sort of deals? 
It is unless NFLX has some sort of revenues share deals with the TV makers then it will chip away some of its future
revenues but if it is a one time deal then it is very minor in terms of cost to the manufacturer or NFLX. 
The NFLX headlines are all over the net and news almost daily.

Not just NFLX will be hit. All other competitors will not able to reach their targets when the basic needs are getting

Lovefilm only has 1.2 million active users. While successful (ie. not losing money), it doesn't have a big

I agree that he doesn't have to apologize because ultimately, it's the traders decision.


I respectfully disagree that he's provided a good and thoughtful analysis for reasons I've already gone into on
this thread. He totally and completely misinterpreted the competitive threat (there isn't one yet), Netflix'
content, and seems like he pulled the saturation argument out of his behind.

Read the detailed financial statements provided on NFLX's website. Marketing costs were way down in Q4 from prior
quarter and are primarily the reason for offsetting an actual gross profit decline. Ignoring the costs of additional
content, which will come when it comes, is Netflix' reduced rate of marketing expected to continue and is such
subscriber growth sustainable with continued lower marketing expense?


26 Jan 2011, 06:57 PM


Bruce Whitaker, Contributor
I'm somewhat astounded by lowered marketing costs in Q4. I have never seen so many NFLX adds on
television. What are the accounting conventions for the timing and recording of these costs? I'd sure like to
know. Are they capitalized or expensed.

NFLX is a sub growth story. Straight shot to 250 til' the next quarter. NFLX racks up subs like T and VZ with no churn.

5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 87/98


Weak shorts covering will get it to new highs alone. Tilson will not cover ever, he has enough capital to keep shorting
until 300, but we will talk about that in 2H11.


I have checked with 20 of my hedge fund friends that cover tech, media, telco. No one is short this name. NO ONE!!!
You can borrow all the stock you want Whitney, go for it....


Mark is the axe in this space and Whitney will tell you this if you ask him...


Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note that the company’s record-high gross subscriber additions
were “greater than expected.” He did note, though, that Netflix’s margins were soft, and cited “streaming content costs
[as] likely the biggest factor.” But he believes the investment will pay off in more new subscribers, he said, generating
more cash and the ability to spend on more content acquisitions.


MSFT for NFLX? anyone?


26 Jan 2011, 07:29 PM


Cherry Picker
If you were right, NFLX would not have announced that it is going to discontinue publishing churn numbers
going forward--a definite red flag. Also, some basic math might give a hint at possible limitations to NFLX
growth and market saturation which could come as early as next year. Something like 55% of all US
households have high speed internet this number will grow, but not as rapidly as needed to keep NFLX
growth on its current trajectory. The percentage of the US population that is over the age of 65 is growing and
is expected to exceed 15% within the next few years. While many of these folks may be or will become NFLX
subscribers it will not be a meaningful percentage. Approximately 25% of the US population is under the age
of 18. The percentage of the US population living under the poverty level is approaching 15% and growing.
The number of households in America is roughly 115 million.


We know the population will grow, but growth has slowed with the aging of America, we know that some
seniors will be NFLX subscribers. We know that some people living below the poverty line will be NFLX
subscribers. We know that new subscribers will be added in Canada. Still, taking the demographics into
consideration and the fact that a majority of Americans will continue to rely on Cable, Satellite, and Telco TV
services while some ground will be lost, it will not be significant, and TV is unlikely to cede anywhere near as
much ground as NFLX bulls want to believe.


The only way I see NFLX stockholders making out on a buy and hold basis is if NFLX continues to dominate
the streaming market, its competitors fade and wither away rather than drive up content acquisition costs and
take market share, and more than 50% of all North American households become subscribers. If you believe
all of that, then by all means, increase your NFLX holdings. NFLX isn't priced to perfection--it's priced on the
basis of stock appreciation momentum.

5/23/2018 Whitney Tilson: Why We're Short Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 88/98


There are only 70MM households that have an internet connection potentially capable of video streaming.
According to the 2010 US Census there are a little over 117MM households in the US.
(www.census.gov/populat... ) More importantly, The US Dept of Commerce reported in 2009 that 40% of
households have no broadband or high-speed access to the Internet, while 30% said they have no Internet
access at all. (www.ntia.doc.gov/repor... )


While the US market may not be saturated now, in my opinion, estimated subscriber growth priced into NFLX
stock price is improbable at best using US market alone and I think growth expectations assume unrealistic
levels of international expansion, certainly at current margins.


Relying just on US market, it is a very good bet that 5-year estimates of 50MM subscribers won't be close to
being achieved from all the households in the US that might have Internet access that would support video
streaming. Thus a MAJOR penetration of international markets and at similar margin rates would be required
to hit such a subscriber number. Yet foreign markets have rules much further from net neutrality than the US.
In addition, Netflix has no real presence or brand value in any foreign market. Finally, as with Amazon's
recent purchase, foreign markets have real competition that will compress margins and increase content
costs.

Tilson covering his

short has to be covered by him. After that... I will wait and watch.  
As soon as the stock breaks below it's high price by -2 1/2% ... that 
is my signal to try a short. My stop will be +2 1/2 above the high

has anybody looked at NFLX's cash flow - year 2010 vs year 2009.


as far as I can tell, free cash from operations could only be sustained by releasing funds from working capital. please
see this image which is a snapshot from excel based on their published results.


the quick cash flow analysis - bit.ly/hbCEEb


assuming that such a release of cash from working capital will not always be possible, and the other trends do not
change, then NFLX's free cash flow would diminish quite a bit. 
on the other hand, the impact of the price increase may help. price increase can of course also cause some attrition.


of course, it is possible that I am reading the cash flow wrong. any comments from more informed people here would
be great!

On Jan.28, the market was down due mainly to profit takings and Egypt’s unrest. Netflix, however, moved up again to
$217.98. Three forces are responsible for this shooting: (a) Short sellers’ buybacks, (b) the effect of a surprised
number of customers (20M as of 12/31/10), (c) the role of a low beta (0.47).


(a) If Netflix’s momentum is continued, more forced buybacks are expected. It is a bad news for bears, but it gives
them more safer grounds to play again. But timing is crucial always.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/242320-whitney-tilson-why-were-short-netflix 91/98


(b) The demand and supply curves of Netflix are very stiff (almost vertical), compared with those of MacDonald’s and
Kraft Foods. Netflix’s curves are not only stiff, but kinked, and even disconnected in some parts. Any information
inducing any shift of the curves results a wide price change. For example, take the number of customers (20M). Any
surprise in this number shifts the demand curve to the right and the supply curve to the left, so that a sharp increase
in price follows. This is a powerful positive outlook. (See “Learning TANER : A Winning Strategy,” posted, for more
details of shifts in curves.)


(c) The beta of Netflix is 0.47, while that of BIDU is 1.69. Netflix is less risky than BIDU? No. I don’t think so. A low
beta (0.47) of Netflix -- less than MacDonald’s (0.50) and Kraft Foods (0.58) -- is another wild card to play. The low
beta works positively, encouraging investors as a less risky stock (in reality it is not), and/or negatively, suppressing
short/put activities, showing its seemingly low volatility.


Netflix’s direction and its sort-term swings will be revealed in a few weeks this time. Stay tuned. I have no position of
Netflix. yk

Shorting such a small ($11Billon) high growth company is just foolish in my opinion. There's so much long term value
here that even if your short did pay you off, the next thing you'll know is there're be a buy out offer that absolutely
crushes you.

Netlix market cap is bigger than the entire DVD rental industry revenue. I read the entire DVD rental market is
$9 Billion in 2010. That is for all rentals. I am not sure how you can squeeze more out of the consumer. Sure
you can make it cheaper for them to rent more movies but they only can spend so much money.


To continue this type of growth I am guessing they will have to compete against HBO, Starz, and Showtime
for additional revenue.


FYI - The entire worldwide video distribution revenue is $56 billion. There is only so much growth.

You will hear of "buy-in's" in netflix in the coming weeks. I.E. if you borrowed stock like a moron and decided to ride
out the short as you didnt have to pay any dividend interest you will be forced from Goldman, Credit Suisse, Morgan
Stanley clearning firms to buy in your short. The move from 200 to 220 in a downturn in the market is clear evidence
of scrambling shorts and clearing firms buying people in.


These postions make some hedge funds and break others. Some analysts will be fired over NFLX some will be
promoted to PM.

Trumpeting the coming of forced buy-ins doesn't sound very bullish. If there's a crush of forced buy-ins, it will
mean the stock price is getting crushed. You don't have forced buy-ins if you have a reputable broker unless
shares are being sold by the original owner. If you have a broker of size, then there would have to be a large
sell-off to trigger a wave of forced buy-ins as brokers generally don't loan out anywhere near all the shares
that are held in investor accounts. Good point, Scootger. By your past comments, I thought you were bullish
on NFLX. Doesn't sound like it in your last post.


13 Feb 2011, 03:52 PM


O. Young Kwon, Contributor
1. If Netflix’s momentum is continued, more forced buybacks are expected. Previously Netflix topped at $209.24
(intraday) on Dec 1, 2010. A new top is $218.00 (intraday) on Jan. 28. The price changed as:


11/30/2010 $205.90 
12/1/2010 $200.14 (Top: $209.24) 
12/2/2010 $193.44 
12/14/2010 $178.45 
12/31/2010 $175.70 
1/26/2011 $183.03 
1/27/2011 $210.92 
1/28/2011 $217.98 (Top: $218.00)


Already another round of battles started. A strong resistance around the previous peak ($210) showed clearly that
short sellers start to bet against Netflix. This is a negative perspective.


2. The surprise number (20M) of customers shifts the demand curve to the right and the supply curve to the left, so
that a sharp increase in price follows. This is a powerful positive outlook. (See “Learning TANER : A Winning
Strategy,” posted, for more details of shifts in curves.)


3. The beta of Netflix is 0.47, while that of BIDU is 1.69. A low beta (0.47) of Netflix -- less than MacDonald’s (0.50)
and Kraft Foods (0.58) -- is another wild card to play. The low beta works positively, encouraging investors as a less
risky stock (in reality it is not), and/or negatively, suppressing short/put activities, showing its seemingly low volatility.
In option pricing models, a low beta overstates premiums of options: A beta indicates the historical volatility of a
security and the correlation of its return with the market’s return. An understated beta tends to overstate the premiums
(or prices) of options, by enlarging its implied (or forecast) volatility. Overstating premiums distort both call and put
options on Netflix. At this level of valuation ($218.00), put options are more suppressed. Short sales are affected by
weak put options. (See “The Perplexity of a Low Beta : The Case of Netflix” posted.)


Netflix’s direction and its short-term swings will be revealed in a few weeks this time. What can you do now? It
depends on who you are. If you are day-traders or short-term momentum players, you can long Netflix, believing it will
inch up further. Or if you are short sellers or put players, you can pull triggers at a certain point, convincing yourself
that Netflix will go nowhere but south. All other investors must not take any actions. This is merely a theoretical
conclusion.

In reality, however, many investors simply either follow optimistic recommendations and articles without their own
home work, or join the bear camp, without figuring out the risk/reward equation precisely. The most vulnerable peril for
investors stems from two sources. One is your charts fail to show any reliable signals. The second is that your
valuations models are broken down because the price behaviors of Netflix have defied the assumptions (e. g., smooth
demand and sully schedules, no transaction costs, etc.) which your models are based upon.


Can the TANER System shed some light to deal with Netflix? According the daily and weekly watch list (See “DATA
and MORE,” posted for the TANER lists from Dec. 13, 2010 to Jan.31, 2011.), on Jan.13, Netflix has three votes – 1
month term (daily), two months term (daily), and 5 months term (weekly). The TANER suggests that it is not a good
time to short or put Netflix yet. We will see any change on a daily basis.

Mr Tilson shows how a bubble is formed - when people bid stocks to sky-high valuations (NFLX - 230+, P/E 78)
against a rational argument for why NFLX should probably be only valued as much a a cable company such as
Comcast. Unfortunately, the bubble can stay irrational longer than prudent investors can stay solvent.

@ Scootger - Thank you for your comment. Netflix’s upward momentum has been still very strong.


Two things, however, make me comfortable. One is that there is almost no chance of takeover, which I considered
very carefully. If my call is correct, I do not incur any heavy cost to carry my short positions for a long term (3 to 12
months) because Netflix does not pay dividend.


The second thing is Netflix’s short ratio becomes much lower now, around 20, compared to several week’s ago (over
30). Who knows a bull trap happens and collapse in a few weeks?

that NFLX was jumping when the S&P was flat or only slightly changed. This disconnect has been going on for two
years. I have been watching this stock (and many others) with minute by minute bar charts as well as daily charts for

I think it's sort of funny all of the comments showing up all of a sudden saying: He was right!


Drawdown folks.


Doesn't matter if you have a -56% dump if you had to endure an 80% rise ...


Simple drawdown

Great Analysis! Does NFLX has a concept of active users? Since this is a subscription, how many people are
sleepers (the gym membership concept)?

Subscriber numbers in US have hit the wall. International tougher road.


Absent growth, with several quarters of losses facing Netflix valuation could trend as low as book value.


Does anyone realize that is <$7/share?


This is BEFORE >$2BN of OFF balance sheet debt. When netflix 10-Q comes out, and off balance sheet liabilities are
disclosed, there will be increased talk of NFLX bankruptcy.

Prescient article. Too bad Mr. Tilson wasn't able to stay the course. To quote Keynes "The Market can remain
irrational longer than you can stay solvent". A good call though, and one that should be praised.

Excellent thesis. Especially relevant considering the decisions int he last few months to seperate the DVD and
streaming businesses, and then revoke that decision and now the rapid fall of stock price by ~40%.

If you believe you're right, you need to be patient too.


You should cover the shorts,and enjoy the better things in life with the big profit.

So right - too bad you did reverse your call for the wrong reasons.
