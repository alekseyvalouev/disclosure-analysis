Neonode: Strong Sell On Shell Games, Fraud Litigation And Hyping
Obsolete Technology
Jun. 18, 2014 2:36 PM ET105 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Neonode AB has gone bankrupt twice, and is now in its THIRD attempt to hype an
obsolete IR-touch technology, and I believe facing inevitable bankruptcy again.


Swedish court documents show NEON Exec. Chairman Bystedt faces an ongoing
lawsuit alleging fraud and shell games, where investors were wiped out after
bankruptcy.


NEON management has issued over 160 promotional press releases, yet lacks
material revenue after 3 years. Meanwhile, NEON insiders have made millions from
stock sales and compensation.


US customs import documents show NEON's much-touted HP printer deal has
produced only $154k in estimated total revenue to NEON as of 6/9/2014.


NEON's technology is commoditized, appears worthless and is rapidly becoming
even less relevant as infrared touchscreens lose market share, while capacitive
becomes relentlessly cheaper.


Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) is a reverse merger that traded for $0.50 per share on the
OTC market just a few years ago, that has gone bankrupt twice already. With promises of
future revenue, 160 promotional press releases and questionable ties to an alleged paid
stock promotion scandal, NEON now trades at an eye-popping "bubble valuation" of
$153m, despite just $4.3m of trailing 12-month revenue, which is a -31% decline from
2011 revenue.


Most importantly, Swedish court documents show NEON executive Chairman faces fraud
allegations from profiting off of the sale of a shell company that went bankrupt and wiped
the investors out. This, along with the multiple bankruptcies of Neonode in the past paints
an interesting pattern to me.


NEON has consistent cash burn, and has only survived thus far due to consistently
issuing dilutive equity to fund cash needs. Primary industry research shows current
contracts are not generating material revenue, while NEON's fundamentals are rapidly

deteriorating due to obsolete and commoditized "technology". I expect as NEON's story
continues to come unwound, NEON will need to continue issuing an increasingly large
number of shares, diluting shareholders in an accelerating manner, to fund its cash burn.


I believe NEON stock is literally worthless, and my price target is $0.00, as I believe
investors will soon refuse to fund Erikson and Bystedt's compensation and obviously
unviable project, driving NEON into bankruptcy (again).

The Neonode "Shell Game": Recycling the Same Story to Investors After Two
Bankruptcies (so far)


Neonode has gone bankrupt twice (so far) using a similar playbook: hype an unviable
business idea within a publicly traded shell, issuing optimistic forecasts, raising investor
capital and then going bankrupt. It seems this playbook also includes multiple shell
companies, subsidiaries, and often results in lawsuits and investor wipe-outs.


The first two "iterations" of Neonode, both Swedish companies, as today, named
"Neonode AB", resulted in bankruptcy and investor wipe-outs. "NEON 1.0" was formed in
2000, with current CEO, Thomas Erikson and current NEON chairman, Per Bystedt
apparently both involved. Despite extremely bullish revenue "projections" of $200m,
NEON 1.0 generated just ~$2m. Shortly after a supplier sued, alleging shell games to
deliberately avoid paying its bills, "NEON 1.0" is reported to go bankrupt in 2005.

NEON 2.0 rebooted in 2007 with a reverse merger onto Nasdaq, but its product flopped
again, resulting in another swift bankruptcy restructuring and investor wipe-out in 2008.
Swedish patents and trademarks are apparently valued at a mere ~$30k per bankruptcy
documents (translated version here).


Did NEON insiders pay back their compensation after these brutal investor wipe-outs?
With two bankruptcies already, what makes you think "this time will be different"?

please read the supporting document HERE.

Perhaps the increased involvement of Per Bystedt as a leader at NEON in 2008 means
fresh blood from a competent and ethical individual? Perhaps the "new NEON" is led by
trustworthy people?


Per Bystedt: Undisclosed Swedish Lawsuit Describes Fraud Allegations and Shell
Companies


Per Swedish court documents I found through Private Investigators and translated by
professionals, I have uncovered an ongoing lawsuit (case T-2795-13) alleging NEON's
executive chairman (joined the team in 2008) is also involved in questionable shell
companies, where he profited personally but investors were wiped out. Plaintiffs allege
fraud and deception.


Summary of Lawsuit (Full Swedish and Translated English versions)


Through a complex chain of questionable shell companies, Per Bystedt appears to me to
have sold shell company Pjaxen to another empty shell company he controls, IABO, and
ultimately to investors with a hotel in Sweden called Högfjällshotellet AB.

Per Bystedt apparently profited to the tune of 3 million SKR on the deal by, undisclosed to
the buyer, issuing himself shares and immediately selling them at a premium to the buyer!
Unfortunately for the investors, though, this purchased company allegedly had
undisclosed liabilities, and the seller was technically IABO, an empty shell controlled by
Bystedt with no assets to pay for the debts it owed.


(Chart from Swedish lawsuit documents, with my commentary)


This lawsuit is ongoing, and I believe, is very telling about the people in charge of NEON.
It is also interesting to me that it appears Bystedt, et al are not refuting the fact of
undisclosed liabilities, but are instead apparently arguing that the Hotel did not complain
quickly enough. Read the translated Plaintiff (Hotel) and Respondents' grounds for
yourself. With potential judgement given Thursday, the uncertainty here is a very
dangerous catalyst investors should consider, in my view.


Furthermore, Executive Chairman Per Bystedt also seems to have a history of failing to
notify regulators properly about his ownership and insider status changes. He was fined
15,000 Skr in 2006 for failing to notify Swedish regulators in a timely manner. (English
translation)


For much more detailed notes on the background and timeline of this lawsuit, I strongly
encourage you to read my translated notes here.


Note, I am not a Swedish lawyer, and I strongly encourage investors to look up the court
documents themselves and form their own view. I paid two translators to interpret these
documents, and made my best good faith effort to summarize these complex issues for

you. In addition, I shared the documents I view as most vital here for the public good to try
and help you with your research. If NEON had disclosed this in a transparent manner, we
wouldn't have this issue.


Why were these issues not disclosed to US investors? What does this tell you about
NEON and the people running it today?


NEON Technology is Obsolete and Has Already Lost the Market to Capacitive Touch


Even if you believe NEON is not a shell company heading for bankruptcy (again) while
insiders get rich, the technology is so hopelessly obsolete, in my view, I question how
NEON management can honestly believe what they are doing is financially viable. Let me
explain.


There is no disputing the global touchscreen market has been growing rapidly for many
years now.

1. Despite rapid touchscreen industry growth, NEON's trailing 12-month revenue is just
$4.18m, which is actually a -31% decrease from 2011 revenue of $6.06m, as cash burn
has simultaneously accelerated. If NEON has some amazing technology, how could this
be? The financial reality NEON seems to find itself in and the wildly optimistic press
releases NEON continues to put forth don't seem to mesh...


(Chart built by me using NEON SEC filings)


2. The reason is Optical Infrared seems to be the modern touchscreen equivalent of an "8-
track" player. Don't believe me? Go find someone who is in charge of deciding what kind
of touchscreen gets integrated into a phone or electronic device. If you choose to NOT do
this, then admit to yourself you are blindly following what biased management or conflicted
Wall Street analysts are telling you.

3. We can see from the "Other Technologies" category at the top of the chart below that
Optical Infrared does not seem to have had meaningful market share in global
touchscreens even going back to 2007. Even worse, that tiny market share has been
shrinking rapidly, with expectations of that trend continuing.


(Chart source, page 5)


In 2007, resistive touch had 93% market share, capacitive was 4% and the various other
types (including optical infrared) were a tiny 2.8% market share. Worst of all (for NEON),
this "Other" market share has shrunk to just 0.3% of the market now, and is forecasted to
continue to shrink, according to the presentation from touchscreen industry consulting
group Walker Mobile above. Other sources further support that infrared has the smallest
market (page 13 on the right) share of any touchscreen technology.


4. Why have NEON and the other optical infrared technologies lost their relevance? There
are many reasons why infrared optical touch has fallen, but primarily, there are very
specific performance issues with this technology that haven't been fixed yet. Meanwhile,

capacitive touch continues the relentless march of improved performance and decreased
cost. While you can argue with me or quote whatever management has told you, the years
of shrinking market share, declining sales and NEON's continued cash burn with inability
to generate material revenue seem hard to ignore.

5. Optical infrared touchscreen technology is OLD, and was originally developed as
far back as 1965 and offered to consumers in 1983 with the HP-150 PC. The fundamental
technology here is not cutting-edge, and many superior touchscreen technologies have
been invented since. Even if a company has the best, A+, top-tier, "8-track" technology,
that technology has little value in the modern world that is generations ahead.

(Image source, page 269)


1. Even in the niche IR-touch space, NEON is a weak competitor: Even if you are
stuck on the idea that optical infrared is the superior tech, which will suddenly reverse
its years of market share losses, there are many other competitors offering optical
infrared touchscreen that seem to be years ahead of NEON.


1. Winstron and Quanta were reported to be launching infrared optical touch
notebooks with Windows as far back as 2009. If NEON had critical IP or patents in
this space, why hasn't it sued Winstron or Quanta or Elotouch?


1. General Touch's proprietary Projected Infrared Touch meets Win8 Logo, and is
extremely flat with small bezel. PQ Labs has 40 patents in infrared touchscreen
technology, and boasts "the thinnest infrared screen". TimeLink appears to offer
up to 48 points of touch on a 100" LCD panel using infrared touch as well.
PulseIR has multi-touch infrared touchscreens as well in up to 103" sizes.


2. Per this 2012 document, NEON was not listed as a supplier capable of
providing 48-touch infrared touchscreen technology.


1. Per discussion with NEON investor relations, NEON appears to only be
capable of 10 fingers touch. How can NEON be expected to compete, when
competitors appear to me to offer more advanced infrared touchscreen
technology?


3. There appear to be countless other Chinese suppliers of cheap infrared
touchscreens as well.

4. Perhaps most telling, what appears to be the global leader in infrared/optical
touchscreen technology, "NextWindow", has recently shut down after
restructuring due to the uneconomic reality of the business, as optical infrared
has faced declining sales for some time now.


1. NextWindow had over $60m in 2010 sales, with 120 employees, not to
mention partnerships with HP, Sony, Dell, Asus, Lenovoa, Medion, NEC,
etc. while based in South Korea, presumably giving it superior access to
companies such as LG, Samsung, etc.


5. NextWindow was acquired in 2010 by SmartTech, and is now shut down.
6. If the global leader with revenue 10x higher than NEON with 3x the employees


and vastly superior partnerships decided pursuing optical infrared wasn't worth
doing, why is NEON still spending shareholder cash on this unviable market?


7. BOTTOM LINE: Infrared touchscreen technology is a shrinking, uneconomic,
obsolete and commoditized industry, where NEON is not even the leader. It is
not surprising to me that NEON is failing, and I question why and how NEON
management apparently is ignorant of the uneconomic position they find
themselves in.


2. Lastly, NEON seems to make it more difficult to do business with it by selling its
offering in a format that customers apparently do not prefer. Remember, NEON doesn't
sell the touchscreen component, it just licenses the technology so the customer can then
have the component built themselves. NEON sells design specs to its version of an
infrared touchscreen, and it typically bundles that with some engineering support. The
problem is that most electronics manufacturers aren't in the business of adding complexity
to their already complex manufacturing processes and partnerships. Based on NEON's
tiny and declining revenue, customers would apparently prefer to simply have one source
for their touchscreen and display and leave it at that, rather than expend additional time
and money on integrating and manufacturing some alternate touchscreen option.


3. NEON's position is unviable now, and rapidly getting worse.


1. While infrared touchscreen technology is currently inferior and losing market share, it
is actually expected to get worse.


2. Capacitive touchscreen costs declined by -20% in 2013, and is expected to decline by
another -20% in 2014, likely putting the costs at $0.40-0.70 per diagonal inch or
cheaper. It is tough for a small company to compete with global giants, where the price

of the competition relentlessly drops by -20% year after year as their performance
improves.


3. Capacitive touchscreen performance is improving rapidly as well. Capacitive has been
useful in gloved applications for years too; this is not an advantage specific to NEON.


4. The last time NEON and these executives went up against global giants in cell phones,
they quickly went bankrupt.


5. NEON is attempting to tout a technology that the market has said is inferior, faces
declining volumes and decreasing market share, at the same time, pricing (revenue) is
declining -20% year-over-year, while its competition, Samsung and Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL), are spending fortunes on R&D.


(Chart built by me with SEC filings)


Considering NEON is already burning a tremendous amount of cash with immaterial
revenue, how long can NEON survive before going bankrupt again?


4. NEON's much-touted Hewlett-Packard printer deal appears to have produced only
$154k of estimated revenue for NEON. This can be calculated using public US customs
documents. HP has already made the decision to use capacitive touchscreens in its
higher-end printers and not NEON, so increased market penetration at HP is apparently
not happening. Why did NEON not press release this important piece of news to its
shareholders?


1. It is possible to track the shipment of products imported into the US with surprising
accuracy using publicly available US customs documents. There are many services
that offer this, and some of them are even free.


2. For reference, here is an example of an HP US Customs Bill of Lading document for a
shipment of HP Officejet 8620 printers that occurred 2/17/2014. I have data as recent
as 6/9/2014 for shipment volume of these HP Officejet printers.

2. We can go through every one of these since last year, searching by product number,
and tally up the total volume of HP Officejet 8610, 8620 and 8630 printers shipped into the
US. For example, this exercise shows us there have been 136 containers of 8620 HP
Officejet printers shipped to the US since the launch.


1. This gives us a "real-time" estimated revenue model for the royalty that NEON will be
paid. I have been surprised at how little revenue from this much-touted deal actually
goes to NEON. Since this printer was launched, even though HP has shipped 255k of
these, the total royalty to NEON for the first 6 months of 2014 seems to be only $154k.
Note that NEON is burning ~$1m per month, so this $154k of estimated revenue over
6 months is barely even a drop in the bucket towards stemming NEON's consistent
cash burn.

(Chart built with my own estimates and US Customs data)


Note, I am using what I consider generous assumptions for NEON on the royalty rate for
the 8620/8630 printers. I believe true NEON royalty amount could likely be far lower.


1. Also note that these initial printer shipments likely contain excess volume necessary to
fill the supply chain, retailer inventory, etc. It is possible the run rate printer volumes
could be lower than what is stated here.


5. NEON has a history of customer loss and partnership resulting in lawsuit.


1. NEON lost Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as its customer in 2012, which is well known.
2. However, NEON also appears to have lost Volvo now as:


1. ""Volvo has been the best because Volvo's new infotainment system comes with a
capacitive display."


2. Where is the NEON press release about this?
3. NEON used to tout a relationship with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but that appears to


have resulted in a contentious lawsuit. Where is the NEON press release about this
also?


6. I Believe NEON Analyst Estimates are far too high, and will need to be revised
downward.


1. Given the deteriorating fundamentals for NEON, market dominance of capacitive and
the immaterial revenue from the HP deal, along with HP's announcement to use
capacitive touch in other applications, the consensus estimates for NEON appear far
too high and will need to be revised downward again.


2. Disgraced and allegedly illegal paid stock pumper "Tech Guru" was forecasting $58m
in 2014 revenue. Slightly less credible analysts (in my opinion) from Ascendiant and
Craig Hallum have apparently pushed out revenue estimates (again), with 2015 now

5/22/2018 Neonode: Strong Sell On Shell Games, Fraud Litigation And Hyping Obsolete Technology - Neonode, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEON) | Seeking A…

3. According to data obtained on CapIQ, NEON paid Craig Hallum almost a million
dollars in fees when Craig Hallum acted as lead underwriter for NEON's follow-on
equity offering in September, 2013. Ascendient also earned large fees for their
participation in the May 2014 offering -- $600,000 in fees for underwriting the shares,
and another $600,000 in connection with warrant exercises, as well as 117,879
warrants for Ascendient. Are these fees influencing the sell side's bullish estimates that
seem to me to be essentially impossible? Should investors be relying on these
estimates, despite this obvious conflict of interest?


4. How long will NEON shareholders tolerate this endless moving of the goal posts
before they begin to feel manipulated and misled?


5. We can see that again (not surprisingly) NEON will fail to produce the sales hockey
stick estimates that NEON analysts have been predicting literally for years. I believe it
is obvious 2014 will (again) underwhelm, as will 2015.


6. We can go end-market by end-market to show this:


1. The much-hyped HP Printer "Opportunity" has already been debunked thoroughly
above, so it's clearly off the table and I won't repeat myself.


2. Auto: NEON's only tiny deal with Volvo never materialized into anything substantial,
and then Volvo switched to capacitive touch for its newest generation of in-car
offerings.


1. Virtually every car company in the world has already developed an in-car
touchscreen offering, and they are all capacitive, or in some rare cases,
resistive technology. I was unable to find even one large car manufacturer with
any optical infrared touchscreen in their entertainment system.


2. Toyota, Cadillac & GM, Ford, VW, Honda and BMW all use capacitive
touchscreens, with Ferrari choosing resistive, and with Volvo finally catching up
and using capacitive technology now too.


3. Handsets: NEON IR has told me that it has essentially stopped pursuing this
market diligently, as capacitive is already dominant; Apple and Samsung are ~70%
of the market, and both of those vendors have invested in capacitive touchscreen
technology, so there seems to me to be essentially zero chance any optical infrared
touchscreen (let alone NEON) gets in any major handset. As evidence, no major
vendor has done this yet, and capacitive touch is only increasing in performance,
while decreasing in cost.


1. Furthermore, NVDA has sued NEON recently, and so that relationship is clearly
not going well.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2275253-neonode-strong-sell-on-shell-games-fraud-litigation-and-hyping-obsolete-technology 17/45


1. E-readers: NEON has already demonstrated an inability to generate meaningful
revenue in this segment when they partnered with AMZN, who is one of the world's
largest e-reader producers. Since NEON lost AMZN as a customer, though, the e-
reader market is now shrinking rapidly, -28% or more depending on the source.


1. Computers: Same situations as handsets, where performance is far too important
to compromise using a cheaper, inferior touchscreen technology.


1. NEON seems years behind the curve in computer and notebooks anyway, not
even receiving Windows 8 certification until early 2014, while competitors are
already selling optical touchscreen PCs. I am guessing the delay is likely
because it is extremely difficult to meet the required specs with infrared
touchscreen technology.


1. Unfortunately for NEON, the competition had Windows 8-compliant
touchscreens already on the market for 2 years, while it appears other
optical infrared touchscreen vendors are already on the market. If they are
theoretically infringing on NEON's IP, then where are the lawsuits?


2. There were computer and tablets proposed back in 2009 with optical
infrared touchscreens, and those never really caught on. I don't see why
any computer company would want to repeat a decision that was already
shown to be a failure.


3. AAPL is already firmly entrenched in capacitive touch, while MSFT recently
acquired its own touchscreen company.


1. Small Appliance Buttons: The only other application that seems even remotely
possible is the touted appliance or small button market. We have seen how much
revenue NEON generates from the HP opportunity, and refrigerators are a much
lower-volume market than printers. Furthermore, there are dozens of apparently
superior competitors any appliance manufacturer could choose over NEON. If NEON
is generating an immaterial amount of revenue from the HP printer deal with 3-4"
screens, how can selling much smaller screens in lower volumes save NEON?
Furthermore, pricing in the touchscreen market is declining -20% every year, so any
future deals will likely have to be signed with lower pricing?


The sad truth is that NEON only receives a very tiny piece of its apparently very weak
value proposition to potential customers. Even years back, before touchscreen pricing
declined dramatically, despite selling into the enormous Kindle e-reader market with 100%
market share for that product at the time, NEON generated only $3m of revenue from that

customer, despite Kindle e-reader sales of $3-4b. With NEON focusing on smaller screens
with lower industry touchscreen pricing, what does this say about NEON's future revenue
potential?


7. NEON patent value is dubious, and I believe clearly worth $0.00


1. NEON bulls claim NEON has a slide-to-lock patent worth "BILLIONS!" but I believe it is
obvious to anyone at a cursory glance that the patent is actually without any value.


2. In addition to other expert analysis, my own analysis indicates NEON's patents are
worthless. More importantly, if you look at NEON's actions, it seems clear to me they
are worthless also.


1. NEON's head of IP quoted it was actively seeking licensing deals and would be
contacting AAPL back in 2/2012.


2. Yet, NEON has not monetized a single patent yet, as far as I can tell.
3. Instead, NEON has sold more stock to get cash. If the patents could be monetized,


it would have done so by now to raise cash and dilute everyone.


3. If the patents were worth anything, they would presumably have been sold by the court
back when NEON went bankrupt. Instead, the outcome shows there is apparently
nothing of material value there.


4. Furthermore, if there was some enormously valuable treasure trove of IP and patents,
Neonode would have monetized them years back, instead of going bankrupt.


5. If NEON's touchscreen IP and patents were so comprehensive and valuable, how are
there dozens of competitors offering what appear to be equivalent or superior
technology, and yet, NEON has not sued any of them, despite announcing intentions
to do so a long time ago?


If NEON's "technology" is clearly obsolete with decreasing relevance, how does
management not know this? What are they honestly doing with this reverse-merger shell
company?

NEON CEO, Thomas Erikson collected $1.38m in compensation in 2012 alone, per
CapIQ.


2. NEON previously tied to disgraced Seeking Alpha stock pumper "Tech Guru",
who had all his public NEON articles removed by Seeking Alpha after the "Dream Team
Group" illegal paid stock pumping scandal.


1. "Tech Guru" appears to have written 8 NEON articles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) in a short
period of time.


2. NEON also featured on Dream Team Group's website several times.
3. What legitimate company would be involved with an alleged paid stock tout scandal?


What was NEON's connection to "Tech Guru"?
4. Could investors who bought NEON stock or who participated in a NEON capital raise


over this time frame (3/2013-10/2013) sue NEON, based on concerns about a
potentially illegally inflated stock price? Could these investors demand to get their
money back?


3. I find the following "estimates" from NEON in its 2011 investor presentation very
"questionable". Did NEON management honestly believe they were going to take an old
technology that has been losing market share for years, which apparently saw no serious
interest from global technology giants during bankruptcy, with estimated 9-18 month sales
cycles, and then grow revenue 2,100% in 2 years?

(From 2011 NEON Investor Presentation)


1. NEON seems very "good" to me at issuing press releases about "design wins" and
selling stock to investors, but seems to me it is bad at actually generating revenue.
See this slide stating dozens of "design wins" back in 2011; despite these promotional
proclamations, NEON failed to generate meaningful revenue and actually lost its
largest customer .

(From 2011 NEON Investor Presentation)


4. NEON Seems To Me To Be Collapsing Internally. Technology and R&D-based
companies are just teams of individuals in the lab. NEON seems to me to have constant
turmoil and turnover in key R&D, engineering and sales positions, indicating to me NEON
is falling apart from the inside out.


1. CEO Erikson is apparently so difficult to work with that the CFO allegedly complained
about discriminating against the elderly. The CFO is ~62 years old also, by the way.


2. How do you feel about these alleged comments from NEON CEO Eriksson towards
head of North American sales, Young, that Young is "old and tired and should just go
home for a drink"? Does this make you think NEON CEO Eriksson is an inspirational
leader set to dominate the world of technology?

(Quoted from 2013 Lawsuits against NEON)


1. NEON senior VP of Global Sales, Xerxes Malekani left Neonode 2 months ago, while
the head of North American sales was fired in 2013.


1. I checked LinkedIn data, and I was surprised by the number of key players that
have left the company in recent years. Of course, some level of turnover is
expected at any public company, but how can Neonode realistically expect to have
dramatic sales growth when key designers, engineers and sales people are
leaving? If the technology was legitimate and the stock about to go up a million %,
why are these people leaving?


(Chart built by me using public LinkedIn information)


1. Some of these employees had long tenures at Neonode - the employment date listed
here only reflects their most recent job. When key employees leave, it takes time to
replace them and often results in delays.


1. Xerxes Malekani, former senior vice president of Global Sales, for example, had
high-quality prior experience at VeriSign AB and Vodafone AB, so it's likely he is
highly capable. I have not spoken to Xerxes, but presumably, he would have
stayed at Neonode if sales really were going to dramatically ramp.


2. Quoting directly from Xerxes' LinkedIn profile:

Part of the Executive team. Responsible for entire enterprise global sales operation,
with HQ in Stockholm, and offices in US Japan & Korea. Targeted
customers/partners are OEM's, ODM's, EMS's.


Considering that Neonode didn't have any material OEM, ODM or EMS revenue during
this period, my guess is that Xerxes left for greener pastures.


5. NEON management has a very questionable "pattern" of consistently failing to
meet their own estimates given to investors.

(Chart sourced from NEON Press releases and my opinion on the implications)


a. Based on my chart above using some of NEON's press releases, I find NEON
management's consistent failure to apparently even meet their own guidance to be highly
questionable.


NEON Management Response: I was able to finally get in touch with NEON investor
relations. With multiple phone calls, though, I was unable to get an extensive call, and
unfortunately, I found his commentary to be promotional and without detailed insight on
the questions I asked. Instead of detailed explanation of industry dynamics along with
strengths and weaknesses or lawsuit disclosure, I instead received extensive discussion
about NEON's current definition of "design wins" that I found disappointing. When asked
about future business prospects for NEON, I only got vague platitudes. Instead of details
on revenue or why past design wins do not seem to me to become revenue, I got broad
statements about how large the market opportunity is. Given NEON's inability to generate
meaningful revenue or cash flow, I believe shareholders deserve more than that.

Comments (105)


Based on NEON's apparent links to paid stock promotion organizations (Tech Guru on
SA), wildly optimistic "estimates", failure to generate meaningful revenue despite years of
press releases, and consistently dilutive equity raises with high cash compensation, either
management is the most incompetent team of individuals I have ever seen or there is
something much worse going on. Even if you dismiss the fraud allegations and striking
similarities between NEON and the other bankrupted shell companies NEON insiders
have been tied to, NEON's fundamentals are currently very bad and rapidly deteriorating,
according to industry specialists and in my view.


NEON was a $0.50 stock trading on OTC just a few short years ago. With a much larger
share count now, I believe NEON will end up trading at a lower price on its way to
eventual bankruptcy as this obsolete and uncompetitive technology becomes increasingly
irrelevant.

Neonode is crap because of exhibit A), B), C) and also because of D), E), F), G) and when we look at H), I), J) and K)
they are also bad, however L) and M) are astonishingly crap.


I think we got the message after the first 3 reasons :- )


Why would anyone want to invest in stuff like this? For everyone of my fingers (including my toes) I can find better
stocks than this one. If management has no clue what they are doing nor the employees and if the plot all seems one
big scam, why on earth would you even bring one penny to a tent like that?

It's nice to see people realize that China isn't the only country selling garbage to shareholders. The US has
many similar companies too. It doesn't make the country bad. It just highlights the criminal elements in a
market that doesn't care about fundamentals.

They're using Neonode... all $154,000 worth of sales. At a market cap of $300,000 this might be in line with
other technology companies. So NEON only has 99%+ to fall to reach fair value. Ouch.

I bought a little of this stock for one reason: A potential PC deal.


Their touch screen technology is a cheaper alternative to the larger touch-screen players. That is why it has

I would agree that NEON insiders have made millions in selling off stock to the public. And when shareholders look
into the return on investment picture mirror, that dollar image is blacked out completely.

I am confused and don't understand what's happening here. Didn't NEON's Senior VP Corporate Finance & Investor

very near future, inflicting imminent bad pain on the shorts? The stock was about $6 at the time.

I don't know why exactly. It could either be because they think it's a good deal or to "send a message to the

He mentions specific actions they have taken to help the stock and address the high short interest. He seems
to imply that they've told the CEO to stop selling stock and buy some. The amount of stock he's sold into the
market dwarfs the amount he's bought.

Inside buying is just another one of many positive factors to consider that I mentioned above. This article did
its job to discredit this company on many levels due to horrible past performance. But as everyone knows ,
past performance is not always indicative of future performance. $3.00 per share may be the bargain of the
century. We should all know next month. They had better be able to guide forward at this point. They have
plenty of money so as far as going to zero as this author states, that is simply hogwash at least for a long
time. Even the 5 year chart is screaming buy me .

Management at NEON buying NEON stock in recent months: 
CEO Thomas Erikkson recently bought 120K shares  
Director Mats Dahlin bought 50K shares 
These open market buys were over $660,000.


No doubt this article had its desired impact with shorts now covering hand over fist while confusion reigns and the
computers follow the weakness.

How much stock have they bought relative to the amount they have sold? It is a fraction. Could be they are just
painting the tape to try to keep the stock strong until their buddies convert their warrants. The warrants convert at
$5.09 and will be worthless at any level below that. So really the stock has very limited upside as the warrants present
an overhang and lots of downside. To me the insider buying looks totally meaningless in light of all the other issues
presented.

I don't know what you're saying, that's right. The upside is more now that the stock gapped down. At $4 this is

Laurence Lavelle, Contributor
Ikarus, Give specifics.  
Dates and what dollar amount went to management private accounts after tax as a result of their private stock
sales. For the sake of discussion estimate tax %.


Recent management purchases over $660,000 stock in a small company at market prices is not the sign of
fraudsters nor hype and it is completely omitted in the article.


If I buy $660,000 stock that is my personal savings after it has been taxed then it is ~$1m gross income
allocated to one investment.


18 Jun 2014, 05:57 PM


Katalm
I'd put them 14 - 16 mil in the bank. With a burn rate of 1 - 1.3mil per month their long term outlook seems
grim.


We'll see in 9ish months. The 5M shares that were ok'd in May will seem very tempting if nothing changes.

Here are total insider purchases and sales reported to the SEC and summarized by MarketWatch:


Last 3 months: 4 Purchases 185,000 shares


Last 6 months: 4 Purchases 185,000 shares; 1 Sale 200,000 shares


Last 12 months: 14 Purchases 1,511,158 shares; 12 Sales 1,812,693 shares

Small funds/private own NEON. It looks technically weak, rumors fly, outcome is sell now. Nobody wants hassles.
Investing is hard enough.


If its false weakness then they buy back when the technicals look better. This is the general trend with current
'investing'. Stop losses are in place and they are hit, it feeds on itself as more stop losses hit and then panic.


Then there are the day traders, bots, trend chasers. They love something like this. Nowadays software trades short
term trends as well as negative words in articles. Look at timing of article and a 1 day price volume plot.


I don't have much interest in NEON but this type of article and immediate chaos is the same old story be it those
pumping to the upside or those dumping to the downside. Same old. Same old. Use it to day or swing trade but not for
investing.

Bravo. Bravo. Very well done and managed to notice some things that I have missed. I do not believe I have yet seen
the 2011 investor presentation (although I knew their projections were absurd) and the Per Bystedt suit is a really
great find. I have a similar chart of missed promises that is much larger and with a similar distribution of missed vs.
kept promises. I actually consider the CEO not wanting old people at the company to be pretty reasonable. I believe
there are even more unlisted reasons to be confident NEON will continue to be a good short. I just want to add a few
things to your analysis though:


Bystedt Suit: 
I would add that the holding company arrangement the management team uses to hold ALL of their stock makes the
relevance of the suit even more understandable. I believe it could be the case that management has organized their
holdings this way because in the probable case that their remaining holdings become worthless, the company's
management would benefit from being able to work through large deferred tax assets they create in their holding
companies for the rest of their lives. It is also worth considering the added difficulty regulators would have regulating
insider transactions initially and enforcing penalties or regulation later on if the assets were both awarded to and held
by holding companies overseas.


Patents: 
I too came to conclusion that their patents are basically worthless; the idea that they might eventually be able to retain
or sell off the patents in a way that benefits the management team would explain the rush to create as many patents
as possible while not anticipating close to the returns or IRR implicitly required by investors. I think it would be
appropriate to know how the patent rights would ultimately be handled if the company were to go bankrupt. (Even
before going as far as using bankruptcy as a downside, investors ought to ask themselves how much of all of this
patent preparation and filing is actually going to provide any return for investors and at what theoretical rate of return
is it being done). Generally speaking it is a terrible time to be long patent value regardless of the strength of the
technology (especially this type of patent).


The prospect of a short squeeze adds absolutely nothing to the INTRINSIC value of the equity. I believe that the
prospect of a short squeeze alone is causing the stock to trade at a price reflecting metrics above even relatively
bullish reasonable (not analyst) consensus estimates. In reality, despite what many have said about the shorts, it is
the longs that are in a race against the clock.

3 analysts covering this company, lowest valuation is 10$. http://yhoo.it/1lDIHjz  
Thomas Eriksson the CEO, bought 500k$ worth of the stock @ 3 $ http://bit.ly/1lDIFbD which accounts for 1.5 year of
his total compensation http://bit.ly/1lDIFbF . 
So basically the author seems to know much better about the company than the 3 professional analysts covering the

SA sent me an email saying that my previous posts were deleted because they contained an allegation of bad faith
against the author.


I guess they missed the point where I said "if the article was inaccurate" then could be no repercussions to the author.
I did question the motivation of the author because of the disclaimer posted on the authors website that basically says
"we will do what we want and hold any position we want whenever we want".


I guess it is okay to write an article on SA with a disclaimer but it not okay to write a post on SA with a disclaimer.

I sent SA a letter regarding what is being deleted and the article itself....dont expect much to come of it, other
than a "freedom of speech type of thing"...However, if you're waiting for the company to comment on an SA
article (whether it's pro or con), I'm pretty sure that is NOT going to happen IMO.


19 Jun 2014, 06:32 PM


Laurence Lavelle, Contributor
Agreed. I read Johnny's posts and they were okay to keep and mild compared to article title and contents
which SA mass emailed.


Most companies do well not to respond to articles but SA profile is now that of news outlet and this article has
title with "Shell Games", "Fraud", "Litigation", etc.


Mass SA email and market reaction within minutes is obvious. Company has to respond to this type of market
moving 'news', 'miss-information', 'short manipulation', etc., depending on one's view.


Company is responding:  
"Neonode to Host Investor Update Call Conference Call on Monday June 23 at 8:30AM EDT.  
Neonode Inc., the opticaltouch technology company, announced today that it will host a conference call to
update investors on the status of the business and to comment on the recent rumors and speculations about
Neonode and the touchscreen market.


This call will take place on Monday June 23th at 8:30AM (EDT) featuring Neonode's CEO Thomas Eriksson,
Executive Chairman Per Bystedt, CFO David Brunton and Daniel Gelbtuch (SVP of Corporate Finance & IR).
The call will consist of a general company update and we will answer pre-submitted questions.

before the last conference call...I know other investors were concerned about that as well. Looking forward to
the conference call and time will tell on this investment.

Guys, the message I heard loud and clear from SA is that is ok to make negative remarks about a company,
but not okay to make them against an author.


FYI I do not expect NEON management to address this article personally. 
I do expect them to answer the questions that are submitted that are relevant to the company's operation.


That is as much as I can say on this forum about this issue without getting deleted again.

Capacitative is already better in every way and lower cost than Neonode's old, obsolete technology. That's

I was wrong on this one...Management's poor handling in the CC and lack of a timely response tell me NEON
was the wrong call. I was in once before in early 2013 for a profit and then out after July/August 2013
conference call. Something didn't feel right...Got back in because I believed the story, the numbers and
potential future numbers...taking a painful loss and moving on. The conference calls that followed this year
gave me no comfort.The "analysts" questions seemed very NEON-sympathetic, with the exception of the last
one where the questions were more hard hitting. Still they fumbled...They also said on that call that they had
enough money by raising the $10 million and then a month later, they filed the shelf registration to raise more
money.

And that's great that NEON's officers believed in the company enough to contribute their own money...oh wait,
they didn't contribute, they INVESTED for either shares, warrants or at the very least, an interest rate. To say
on this most recent CC YESTERDAY that to us, as investors, NEON is only an investment but that for
Neonode's Upper management, it is their life...is good copy but untrue...Because it is not their life, as if to
imply they will be ruined. Further to talk of upper management's paycuts is relative...I was making 5 million
but now only 2 million or whatever...Many professional ballplayers take huge paycuts to be on a winning
team, Some succeed, Most don't...so don't cry or try to get sympathy because you took a paycut but yet
you're still a millionaire...What a stupid and irresponsible comment to make. Most people invest with their hard
earned money or their client's hard earned money and to imply that their investment in NEON is more
important than ours...well again, it's irresponsible....and simply NOT TRUE! I couldn't be more disappointed in
NEON's management. Lastly, I am not blaming anyone for my investment or my loss...I made the investment
in NEON and stood by them. They were not honest on several occasions.


Btw, I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS AS A FOLLOW UP to my first question but this first one was simple,
regarding credibility and misleading information


"Why, if Neonode's headquarters and main operations are in Stockholm, Sweden, per Thomas and only 1
development site is located in the US (Santa Clara); the other development sites are located in Tokyo and
Seoul, why are you guys repping Santa Clara, CA as your headquarters (per Etrade), when it is not?"


This is disingenuous at best...and I never heard back!


NOTE: I am not shorting NEON and have no position in them at all.

I am happy that you now see the light. Too many posters on SA refuse to hold management accountable
when they fail theirs shareholders and companies.


These guys are the worse of the worse.

The call was a joke, the company had no response for the allegations in this report, which I guess means Neonode
agrees with the report.


Specifically: 
- Per Bystedt is involved in all of the court cases mentioned here (he admitted that) -- this shows how shady
management is 
- No new sources of revenue were announced (meaning revenue is still basically zero and this stock is way
overvalued) 
- No new OEM partnerships 
- Weak attempt at verbal shell game about how Volvo is still a customer. WHERE IS THE REVENUE????????????? 
- Amazon dropped Neonode like a bad habit 
- HP is a great client -- so great that Neonode can't be bothered to talk about units shipped (let's just assume it's bad
or they would have given a number). Oh but don't worry, only part of HP's printers are shipped to the US! WHO
CARES? WHERE IS THE REVENUE??????????


The call was a joke, Neonode Inc. will be the third bankruptcy for Neonode

Ikarus,the legal proceedings were tiny and years in one case a decade old. I enjoyed hearing the one on the soccer
team late filing. They told you the Revenue from HP is not limited to an estimate of shipments to the customs in LA. I
agree there was no fluff or promises of new deals. Got lawyered up and talked to

It shows that he has a history of allegedly defrauding people will shell games. It is very highly relevant despite how
much you would like to sweep it under the rug and pretend that Neonode is not a shell fraud.

hey pump stopper , did you see this b4 you write your article, cause you may wake up one day to power you
computer or laptop using this touch solution  
http://bit.ly/1iGurrl


25 Jun 2014, 01:41 PM


Willifyouletme
I don't understand why pump stopper has spent so much time to manufactured so much material to put the company
down. You just have to look outside this article and can see the reality of how strong Neonode's technology is. I have
heard through a component supplier that HP have put Neonode is many printers more of which will be seen in the
coming couple of months, and later this year, more devices all the into 2018. I have heard through the same
component suppliers, that Neonode is getting major traction in the AIO, and Monitors segment with OEMS, and I
heard this before the Neonode press release refuting this article. Look at Mondays Unipxel call which was a amusing
that the stock went up 25%. They said they can now do a process they said they would actually be product mid Q3
2013. Yet all they said was they can now do it, and this leave a lot of room for failure as achieving the process with
high yield is a completely different story compared to just being able to do it in the lab. Again, this was something they
said would be in product last year and that Dell was going to take all their first year production...So really they are
actually further back that we were made to believe last year.... Remember that? Yet the stock went up big time... What
are people thinking?


Back to Neonode, through my component supplier contact, who is a component distributor, something is happening
with a Korean company shortly which I could not get more detail on. I do remember Neonode making some
announcement last year dealing with a Korean company.


What really upsets me about this article how the author has some concluded that Neonode's technology is obsolete,
by actually using obsolete diagrams and images? IR technology used by Neonode is unlike anything else in the
market and it has to do with their lens technology, which is what their IP is all about. Look up some Neonode patents
to be educated on this. There is no basis for authors argument and all these investors fell for it, yet Pump Stopper and
his buddies are now nicely cashed up based on this stock plunge since the article,...Makes me laugh actually...so well
done on a great piece of deception. For people take one persons opinion as gospel is so amazing to see... I mean a
declaration of fraud in this article on the basis of a 13 year old non Neonode related one way claim? Plus a football
club fine when he was chairman???? For those who sold at a loss? there is still a chance...


The last call was not the best, and management could have done it a lot better, but the message was clear especially
since the last press release which was the summary of the call... To Neonode management, take attacks like this
serious and response agressively next time... Stop the tippy toeing... Just do it!


I have responded to JJ Cohen, sorry he is no longer a supporter, but its not too late to get back in... actually its a
major opportunity as I see it.

mikeasa: If NEON's management just became aware of new material non-public information as you claim (the
surprise!), NEON's management is required to file an 8K within 3 business days. So, if nothing gets filed by
Thursday next week, the shorts would have been right not to be concerned.

No he's right Richard, Neonode management has a big surprise -- they have another patent on their old, worthless
technology! Wow! What's not surprising is the company still can't generate revenue and still has exists only because it
has been able to provide empty promises and sell stock to enrich insiders.


Attention Neonode Management: Please stop releasing worthless updates to the market and go generate revenue.
It's put up or shut up time.

no doubt this company has been a turd lately. More insider buys however last few days and looks like they might have
a deal with amazon on the new kindle 6 that ships out next week. No PR on this yet but can be found on Neons
website. This company has me scratching my head...

printers will start hitting the books soon.

No one really believes any material revenue will be generated from the "new products". If the stock ever
temporarily rallies on new product hype, I will short more.

It's fun that I've taken your money on both NEON and MNDL. I closed out NEON, looking to get short again if
the market is fooled by the current "announcement".


Neonode Inc., (NASDAQ: NEON), the optical-touch technology company, proudly announced the signing of a
technology development agreement with a leading tier-one printer OEM.


Translation:


Neonode announced a partnership that was so awesome (!!!!!!!!) that they couldn't even name the printer
OEM.

Mike - only place I presume shorts are running to, is to the bank to bathe themselves in money. 
This article above deserves an award for being one of the best withering; critical; insightful; well-written
articles Seeking Alpha has produced in the last year. Since it has been written, NEON stock has declined
perhaps around 75%. NEON has as of yet, never generated the hard revenues to butress its story. PR is one
thing. Actual revenue generation, well, that's the part they seem to struggle on.

There is still a bloated short seller with 7.5 million shares short that has no idea what will happen next.


HP revenues are ramping significantly right now. Over the next 2 quarters Neonode technology will be in every new
HP printer manufactured.


Addtionally, Neonode has Lexmark and 3rd which equal 75% of the 125M printers manufactured world wide a year. 
Do the math.  
This is just for the optical touch printer displays.
