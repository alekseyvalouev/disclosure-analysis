What's Wrong With Tokai Pharmaceuticals?
Nov. 2, 2015 10:00 AM ET24 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Tokaiâ€™s attempt at a Phase 3 trial is based on data from just 6 patients out of 87 in
Phase 2, based on after-the-fact cherry picking of data.


Tokai dramatically changed its trial design between Phase 2 and Phase 3, and the
FDA has already warned Tokai about problems with its trial design.


Insider selling has been rampant ahead of preliminary data in 2016.


Tokai just filed a massive $150 million S3 registration statement in order to raise
money before Phase 3 results are known.


Expect 60-70% near-term downside in the stock.


Summary


Tokai Pharmaceuticals (TKAI) is a one-product biotech company with a single drug in
development. Galeterone is being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer for a
very specific "subgroup of a subgroup" of patients for whom existing treatments are not
effective. The sole reason for justifying taking Galeterone into Phase 3 trials was an after-
the-fact "retrospective subset analysis" of its Phase 2 results, which saw encouraging
results in just 6 patients out of 87. The structure of Tokai's Phase 3 trial is such that failure
is virtually guaranteed. As a result, Tokai has one of the highest short interest ratios of any
stock on the NASDAQ. Insider selling has been rampant ahead of the pivotal trial results
in 2016.


Because of its trial design, Tokai is virtually guaranteed to fail in Phase 3 and the
stock will fall to cash value, a decline of at least 60%. Tokai recently filed a massive
$150 million shelf registration statement in hopes of raising money before the
Phase 3 results come public. The equity offering will add near-term pressure to the
stock price.


Background on shorting biotech stocks

The year 2014 could easily go down in history as "The Year of the Short Squeeze". Many
investors deliberately piled into controversial stocks for the sole reason that they were
heavily shorted, banking on a short squeeze to give them an excess return. It was an
unrestrained bull market and even sell-side analysts began deliberately recommending
stocks which were blatantly overvalued or even downright fraudulent on the basis that the
high short interest might cause them to squeeze higher.


But now it is 2015 and heavily shorted stocks have been behaving more rationally. When
the negative thesis becomes well understood, these heavily shorted stocks plunge as
expected.


Shares of Wayfair (NYSE:W) were among the most heavily shorted of all stocks on the
NYSE. Yet a brief report from Citron research sent the stock plunging by more than 40%.


Shares of AAC Holdings (NASDAQ:AAC) had a short ratio of nearly 40% of the free float.
But a report from Bleecker Street Research sent that stock plunging by as much as 50%.


Shares of Amira Nature Foods (NYSE:ANFI) plunged by 40% following a report from
Prescience Point, despite having a short ratio of around 40%.


More recently, heavily shorted Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) plunged
by more than 40% following a report from Kerrisdale Capital. This was despite the fact that
the stock was heavily shorted and had just 10 million shares outstanding.


The point from these examples is that a high short interest is now indicative of what
it should be: namely that a company has significant problems and is likely to see
sharp declines going forward. Unlike in 2014, investors who are short these
problematic names have now demonstrated that they are in no rush to cover their
short positions as they wait for the inevitable decline.


On the surface, shorting biotech stocks might appear to be downright stupid. If a drug wins
approval, a short seller stands to potentially lose several hundred percent (or more). If
things go right, the gains are typically limited to 70-80%. Before going short, investors
must strongly assess the probability of the decline.


As a result, when a biotech stock has a massive short interest, it is a sign that the market
has very strong reasons to be ultra confident that failure will be the outcome.


When I wrote "The Ugly Truth About Ohr Pharma" (NASDAQ:OHRP), the stock was still
sitting at around $10. Yet I highlighted the fact that the company's drug had already failed
in past clinical trials and should be expected to fail again. It was a true no-brainer and it

attracted a huge short interest. When the drug failed (as expected), the stock cratered to
around $2.00 - down by nearly 80%. Following that, I followed up with "Five Lessons from
Ohr Pharma" to highlight where investors went wrong.


I made a similar case against ZIOPHARM's (NASDAQ:ZIOP) Palifosfamide drug, which
was also all but guaranteed to fail. This could easily be deduced by looking at the history
and details of its clinical trials. When the stock was at $6.00, the short interest was
massive with huge bets that the drug would fail. As expected, the drug failed and the
share price crashed to $1.60 - down by nearly 70%. I followed up on that with "Why Retail
Got Slaughtered on ZIOPHARM". (ZIOPHARM has since been resurrected through its
collaboration with Intrexon (NYSE:XON)).


More recently, shares of XOMA (NASDAQ:XOMA) plunged by 80% following the failure of
its main drug. Yet a multi-year analysis of its clinical trials showed that it too was all but
guaranteed to fail. As usual, the huge short interest in the name should have alerted
investors that something was very wrong.


The point is that in some cases, shorting biotech stocks can be a no-brainer (and a very
high probability) win. By conducting a close analysis of clinical trial details, one can get a
very clear idea where problems exist. A huge short interest in the stock is a sure sign that
institutions have already done this work and are happy to take a lopsided bet against the
stock, hoping for returns of at least 60% based on the fact that failure is almost
inevitable.


Background on Tokai


Tokai Pharmaceuticals came public in September of 2014 when anything biotech was
virtually guaranteed a hot reception. The stock came public at $15.00 and quickly rose to
as high as $20.00. But since that time, the stock has floundered and now trades for
around $11.00.


Seeking Alpha author Stock Doctor highlighted a bull case for Tokai in an article entitled,
"Tokai Pharmaceuticals: The Small Cap Biotech With The Billion Dollar Prostate Cancer
Drug". Upon publication, the stock immediately jumped by 20%.


However, since that time, the stock has declined to new lows and has become one of the
most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq. Insider selling has been rampant and Tokai
has just filed to raise up to $150 million in an equity offering before Phase 3 results come
out.


Clearly something is amiss.

The bull case for Galeterone


Galeterone is being targeted at a very specific subpopulation of prostate cancer patients
who are treated specifically for "castration-resistant prostate cancer" or CRPC. Right now,
there are two drugs which compete for this market. Medivation (NASDAQ:MDVN) offers
Xtandi while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) offers Zytiga. Together, these two drugs
bring in over $3 billion in annual revenues.


However, there is a problem with both drugs in that they fail to show results in a sub-
subpopulation of CRPC patients with a certain truncated androgen receptor known as AR-
V7.


As a result, Tokai is going after an even smaller population within this subpopulation.


In Phase 2 trials, Galeterone appeared to show effectiveness in AR-V7 patients, such that
it could end up replacing Xtandi and Zytiga (but only in the subset of patients where those
drugs do not work). This would create a market opportunity of perhaps $500 million to $1
billion.


That is the full extent of the bull case and it rests entirely on AR-V7.


The problems with Tokai and Galeterone


First off, it should be made clear the Tokai never even conducted a Phase 2 trial designed
to test the effectiveness of Galeterone on AR-V7 patients. It also did not run a
comparative trial designed to test the drug's effectiveness versus Zytiga and Xtandi.
Instead, the company merely ran a Phase 2 trial testing Galeterone for effectiveness in
CRPC prostate cancer.


So how did Tokai come to focus specifically on AR-V7 patients?


Tokai began Phase 2 trials for Galeterone in December 2012, with no mention of AR-V7.
The study evaluated 87 patients who were specifically classified as CRPC. The data
includes 17 patients who were non-metastatic and treatment naÃ¯ve (no other drugs given)
and 39 patients who were metastatic and treatment naÃ¯ve. It also included 26 patients who
had received Zytiga and 5 who had received Xtandi.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals 5/18


Tokai was set to come public in September of 2014 with a drug that was undifferentiated
from two existing blockbuster drugs. The company needed something to differentiate
itself.


Fortunately, there was already an article in the works in the New England Journal of
Medicine highlighting the fact that both Zytiga and Xtandi had a weakness in that they
were not effective in AR-V7 patients.


Ahead of its IPO, Tokai quickly began conducting after-the-fact data mining and found
that there happened to be 6 patients out of these 87 patients who would be classified as
AR-V7 and in whom Galeterone proved effective.


In scientific terms, this is called a "retrospective subset analysis". In layman terms, it is
called data mining and "cherry picking".


Tokai was no doubt well aware of the upcoming publication in the NEJM. Dr. Mario
Eisenberger can be found as an author on the NEJM study. He also happens to be a lead
contributor on the Phase 2 trial for Tokai on Galetrone.


The following image shows the contributors to the NEJM article:

The following image shows the contributors to the Galeterone study:


(Source)


As a result, by the time Tokai filed to come public, the company had an IPO prospectus
describing its strategy as one focused on the unique AR-V7 angle.


Tokai disclosed that:


In our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of galeterone, which we refer to as our ARMOR2
trial, we observed clinically meaningful PSA reductions in patients that were
identified as having altered androgen receptors that were truncated in a
retrospective subset analysis of seven such patients. Six of these patients
showed clinically meaningful PSA reductions of at least 50%.


Structural problems with the Phase 3 trial

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals 7/18


Because of the change in strategy, it is clear that Tokai is flying blind into its Phase
3 trial. The company plainly discloses that:


For drug and biological products, the FDA typically requires the successful
completion of TWO adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to support
marketing approval. In the case of galeterone, we intend to seek approval based
upon the results of a SINGLE pivotal clinical trial. If the results of the trial are not
robust, are subject to confounding factors, or are not adequately supported by other
study endpoints, the FDA may refuse to approve galeterone based upon a single
clinical trial.


But it gets worse.


Unlike the general Phase 2 trial which was evaluating Galeterone as a standalone drug,
Tokai has launched a Phase 3 trial which compares it specifically to Xtandi. The company
also changed its endpoint to be radiographic progression free survival ("rPFS").


As a result, the company truly has no idea what outcome to expect. It is as if the
company never even conducted a Phase 2 trial at all!


From its disclosure:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals 8/18


Our ARMOR3-SV trial will be a randomized, open label clinical trial comparing
galeterone to Xtandi in 148 metastatic CRPC treatment-naÃ¯ve patients whose
prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant. The primary endpoint of the
trial will be rPFS as determined by a blinded, independent central imaging
assessment.


Once again, this is entirely different than its Phase 2 trial and gives the company no idea
what to expect.


We have not conducted any clinical trials of galeterone for patients with AR-
V7, comparing galeterone to a comparator drug or using a primary endpoint of
rPFS. As a result, the results of the clinical trials that we have conducted may not be
predictive of the outcome of our ARMOR3-SV trial.


Again, it gets worse.


As for the rPFS endpoint, the company discloses that:


we are unaware of any completed or currently ongoing pivotal trials of
treatments for prostate cancer for which the sole primary endpoint to support
initial FDA drug approval was rPFS. As a result, we cannot be assured as to how
the FDA will interpret any rPFS data that we generate in our ARMOR3-SV trial.


But we can see that the FDA has already warned the company about the use of this
endpoint:


In August 2014, we met with the FDA to discuss plans for our ARMOR3-SV trial. At
this meeting, the FDA advised us that, in its view, rPFS and the use of rPFS in
the metastatic CRPC context is limited by difficulties in bone scan
interpretation and the complexity of the criteria used to define progression,
each of which creates uncertainty as to the ability of rPFS to predict improvements in
morbidity or mortality.


The FDA specifically warned Tokai:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals 9/18


The FDA also advised us that if we used rPFS as the sole primary endpoint, this
uncertainty would need to be overcome by a statistically persuasive large
relative and absolute magnitude of improvement in rPFS as well as internal
consistency across secondary endpoints, including a supportive result in overall
survival.


The biggest and most fundamental problem here is that the Phase 3 trial designed
by Tokai is virtually guaranteed to not meet these hurdles simply due to the size of
the trial alone.


This can be seen by comparing the study size for the Galeterone trial to the trials of Xtandi
and Zytiga.

The problem with cherry picking data


Wikipedia describes Cherry Picking as follows:


The term is based on the perceived process of harvesting fruit, such as cherries.
The picker would be expected to only select the ripest and healthiest fruits. An
observer who only sees the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most, or
even all, of the fruit is in such good condition. A less common type of cherry picking
is to gather only fruit that is easy to harvest, ignoring quality fruit higher up the tree.
This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit (since it's only a
sample).


Cherry picking data can be very useful in attempting to make the case for a conclusion.


For example, within the NBA, China can point to 5 famous basketball players. They are
Mengke Bateer, Sun Yue, Wang Zhizhi, Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian.


It would be very easy to produce a "retrospective subset analysis" of a small sample of
NBA players which could conclude that Chinese nationals are somehow uniquely suited to
be basketball stars. The analysis could be designed to show this even though Chinese
nationals are the exception rather than the rule in the NBA.


This is precisely what Tokai has done with its Phase 2 data.


Testing for AR-V7 - yet another problem


Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room is the fact that there is no easy way to even test
for AR-V7 in practice. There currently exists no FDA-approved test for AR-V7.


Tokai notes that:


We need to develop an analytically validated assay that sensitively detects AR-
V7 in order to proceed with our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial and develop and
commercialize a companion diagnostic test for this assay in order to seek approval
of, and commercialize, galeterone for patients with these types of truncated
androgen receptors. We have entered into a collaboration with Qiagen to develop
and commercialize the companion diagnostic. Clinical data obtained with the clinical
trial assay in the Phase 3 trial will be used by Qiagen to support regulatory filings for
the approval of the companion diagnostic for AR-V7 and by us to support our
regulatory filings for approval of galeterone.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals 11/18


What it comes down to is that Tokai WILL be able to use a non-approved test for finding
patients for its clinical trials, but that commercial use of Galeterone CANNOT proceed until
there is an FDA-approved diagnostic test for AR-V7.


Insider selling and a massive S3 filing


Based on the information above, the rampant insider selling now becomes perfectly
understandable.


Over the course of 2015, insiders have been selling millions in stock, all at prices below
where the IPO was priced.


This includes the CEO, the CFO and the COO, as well as by partner Novartis
(NYSE:NVS). Needless to say, there have been no insider purchases in 2015.


Adding to that pressure is the fact that Tokai just filed a massive $150 million S3
registration statement to raise money via an equity offering.


Tokai currently has $83 million in cash (about $4.00 per share). However, this cash will all
be consumed by the Phase 3 trial. From the disclosure, we can see that the company
"believes" it has enough cash on hand to fund the Phase 3 trial... but NOT enough to get
to an NDA.


As a result, Tokai should be expected to launch an equity offering as soon as the S3
becomes effective, potentially in the coming days or weeks.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals 12/18


Tokai is a no-brainer short that will likely return at least 60% on the downside. The
incredibly high short interest is a reflection of the fact that the drug is virtually guaranteed
to fail its Phase 3 trial and it has no other products in the pipeline.


Prior to its IPO, and based on its Phase 2 trials, Tokai Pharma did not have a drug that
was differentiated from Xtandi or Zytiga. It did not have a drug that would be approved.


In response to findings from the New England Journal of Medicine (and AFTER the Phase
2 had already begun), the company quickly changed its strategy to target AR-V7. The
justification for this was simply a cherry picking exercise which noted effectiveness in just
6 patients out of 87.


The company dramatically changed the design of its Phase 3 trial to become a
comparison between Galeterone and Xtandi. It also changed the trial design to use rPFS
as its primary endpoint, despite warnings from the FDA about the shortcomings of this
endpoint.


There has never been a drug approved using rPFS. Despite this, Tokai is attempting to do
so with an inadequate sample size, and in a SINGLE trial rather than the TWO trials as
required by the FDA.


As a result, the trial is all but guaranteed to fail. This is very similar to what we have seen
with past biotech failures such as Ohr Pharma, ZIOPHARM and XOMA, among others.


Tokai should be expected to trade down to cash value per share.


However, the actual share price target on the downside is a moving target. Tokai will
quickly consume all of its current cash balance in the Phase 3 trial. But the company is
close to launching an equity offering to raise additional cash.


That soon-to-be-launched equity offering will be the catalyst for the first leg down in the
stock of perhaps 20-30%, leading to a total decline of at least 60-70% as we get closer to
trial results in 2016.

Thank you for holding Tokai's management accountable and protecting shareholders, bravo!

Great job. TKAI research is a long shot and based on hype from the NEMJ research. Folks who understand anything
about cancer treatment and end point analysis, knows that TKAI will most likely fail. The Phase III design is weak and
will most likely not be able to show enough power to the FDA.


Top off with large insider selling, investors should really beware. Most of the folks buying the stock have know idea the
risks of involved.

I do not understand the evil in a retrospective analysis. If you find out there is a subset of patients that respond and
you are able to identify them, what is the problem? Also If The drug is on par with enzalutamide without identifying
ARV7, but clearly is superior in a subset of patients(ARV7+) would it not be a better strategic plan to go after this
subset?

If the drug is on par (that is a big "if") with enzalutamide without AR-V7, than what is the objective of
galeterone? Enzalutamide was designed for general castration resistant prostate cancer. Galeterone's PH3
design is based on beating enzalutamide because enzalutamide was found to fail in cases where patients
showed AR-V7. The objective of galeterone is to work in cases where patients showed AR-V7.


Phase2 was an all encompassing design for castration resistant prostate cancer. Phase3 was redesigned
looking for AR-V7 and based on retrospective subgroup analysis. The big problems with this PH3 design 1)
Phase 2 data was based on 6 patients, 2) Phase 3 based on rPFS endpoint (and not PSA50), which is a big
pivot, 3) Phase 3 has a very small patient sample size compared with existing standard of care (not enough
events to show power), 4) can they find enough patients with AR-V7 to even conduct the study.


Point 3 is a big one. TKAI essentially embarked on PH3 with ZERO data from PH2, using rPFS as an end-
point.


Just my two cents! Good luck to everyone.

1.)You have to consider the Hopkin's data as well so the total is more than 6 patients.


2.)rPFS I would imagine would be included in the discussion with the FDA before beginning the trial


3.)The trial is 90% powered to detect 82% incease in rPFS


 
I am not convinced on the short thesis......

Interesting article, although I believe you do not have a full understanding of companion diagnostics. The trial is based
on a study at Johns Hopkins where no patients with AR-V7 responded to either Xtandi or Zytiga. You would not
expect them to as AR-V7 lacks the binding site for these drugs. When I say no response, it was absolutely zero.
Importantly, Tokai is using the same diagnostic assay to stratify patients as the hopkins study. Qiagen, which has a
long history of getting companion diagnostics FDA approved has developed the test Tokai is using. Trials based on
targeted therapy do not need to have large numbers like the Zytiga and Xtandi trials which are not targeted therapy.

The AR-V7 cohort, although only thought to be about 10%, is an unmet medical need. Any response in these patients
will be significant as there currently are no other options. It is the low hanging fruit for Tokai to go after. Again,
management has always said they have enough money to make it through P3. If they cannot find a partner for their
drug then they would have to raise money to bring it to market.


Stock is highly shorted because it is a company that relies on one drug and the AR-V7 story is fairly new. I believe
response will be more complicated once refractory to Xtandi and Zytiga but think the drug has a good shot with the
AR-V7 treatment naive cohort. Would be nice to get more information about the ratio required to be considered AR-V7
positive as if there is some AR left then one may get a response to Xtandi initially.

It's also important to note that rPFS is a common primary endpoint in mCRPC. Author states they are using this
instead of commonly used PSA50 which is not true. Most clinical trials use both Overall Survival and rPFS as the
primary outcome. Medivations PREVAIL P3 clinical trial used both OS and rPFS as primary endpoints. Zytiga is an
example where FDA approved drug based on rPFS as OS was not statistically significant when drug was initially
approved.

So, were there any arguments you agreed with Stock Doctor?


Not trying to stir conflict, just need to know if there's any common ground here.

Hi cwDeici,


The only real argument here is that they are reliant on one drug which certainly makes the stock risky.
However, I did the same play with Medivation and have made a small fortune. All the other arguments are
really based on a lack of understanding and twisted to fit a short argument. The stock is highly shorted
because the company is focused on one drug. The main concern with Tokai for me is the question on
response following treatment with other AR inhibitors. It appears to be much lower. So likely once put under
pressure of Xtandi or Zytiga other mechanisms of resistance besides AR-V7 expression must be in play.

One thing in common with almost all short articles - they use lots of bolded font. It is almost like they are
trying to convince themselves of their poorly reasoned arguments that take facts out of context.


A challenge for Tokai will be enrollment. As they say in their 10-K they will need to screen >1000 patients in
order to enroll 148 in their Phase 3 study. Will require quite a bit of time and many clinical sites (expensive) to

Just a note on the S-3 filing. These can be done one year after the IPO and set the stage for raising money in the
future. Does not mean raising money is imminent. Since the TKAI IPO was in September 2014 this filing is in no way
unusual - standard way of doing business for a small biotech. Obviously they would like to wait to raise money on
positive news and a higher stock price, but that may or may not be possible.

Hi Stock Doctor. Does this article change the value gap for you? And if so, by how much?

Looks like market does not agree either regardless of the short interest, which I think is high due soley to having one
drug in pipeline

What's wrong with this article? Same old format used and same tactics used to push a short agenda. Not a balanced
and unbiased article.

As a long investor I really appreciate the extra attention this article has brought TKAI - nice to see a 10% bump from
publication time. Seriously though, I agree this short case is overstated. And speaking of cherry picking, it's
disingenuous to cherry pick lines from a prospectus and make these sound like confessions that a company is up to
no good. As any IPO investor knows, a prospectus is full of disclosures that basically tell investors to do their own due
diligence and that they're at risk for losing all of their money, so the company has its butt covered.

Richard - I looked harder at your claims and do appreciate your research. You make some good points. I do think
you're overly dismissive of the data however. Yes six patients is not many. But if truly six out of seven patients
responded, and obviously Xtandi and Zytiga are not options for these patients, then that suggests galeterone does
become an important therapeutic option if the trial succeeds. See recent data from JAMA Oncology, 8/2015:


For taxane-based regimens, "The PSA response rates [at least 50% reduction in PSA] were 41% (7 of 17 men; 95%
CI, 18%-67%) in AR-V7â€“positive patients and 65% (13 of 20 men; 95% CI, 41%-85%) in AR-V7â€“negative patients, a
non-significant difference of 24% (P= .19; 95% CI for the differ-ence, âˆ’13% to 60%).


So based on that data, 41% of AR-V7 positive patients have 50% reduction in PSA with a taxane regimen. Six out of
seven patients responding to galeterone... well that compares rather favorably, though granted the numbers are low.
As anyone who has worked with them knows, the taxanes are brutal - horrible neuropathy, alopecia, neutropenia, etc.
An alternative to those would be important. I do think the study is on the small side for such a large indication and the
FDA may balk at that if the numbers are at all borderline, but I'm not so negative as you.

Article has all the hallmarks of a hit job. No point in disputing the twisted logic and data presented here. Visit the
company's web site and go over presentations for a complete and accurate picture. Also, see this video below. I'd
rather listen to an expert in the field rather than some investment banker who has has "short only" next to his title.

Well, give credit where credit is due. The author knew there was no catalysts in the near term for this stock (at the
time of the writing). As a result of poor market conditions, no catalysts, and a large short position, the stock has fallen
~50% since November 2015.


However, its really not a very sound argument to cite "cherry picking" as a negative thing. As long as there is science
as a foundation to the findings, there is nothing wrong with discovering something in a subset of data. MANY of the
discoveries over the past century have come from "cherry picking" or discovering unexpected attributes in chemicals

and drugs. Good lord, where would we be without Viagra (initially for heart treatment)!! Other accidental discoveries
include Rogaine, Botox, Propecia and Penicillin. If AR-V7 turns out to be one these accidents, I am OK with that.
