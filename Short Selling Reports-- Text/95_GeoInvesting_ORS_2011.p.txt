Questioning the Operations of Orsus Xelent Technologies
Jun. 24, 2011 11:46 AM ET13 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Introduction


We have been looking into the Orsus Xelent Technologies (ORS) story and reached the
following conclusions that are explained in more detail in this report:


ORS has no discernible business operations;
Even if the management team of ORS is conducting substantial business operations,
US shareholders may have no ownership interest in whatever the true operations are;
ORS faces an immediate liquidity crisis that if unresolved will likely force the company
to suspend operations at the end of QII or during QIII 2011.
Due diligence performed by Reuters corroborates our on-the-ground-findings.


Background


On May 23, 2010, we informed our premium users via our message boards that we were
going short ORS.


First note
Second note
Third note


ORS shares had been on fire since late May 2011, climbing from around $1.00 to a high of
$7.29 on June 14, 2011. Shares of ORS have subsequently retreated, closing at $3.19 on
June 17, 2011 as more investors have likely begun peeling away the onion on this story.


We speculate that investors were excited about what appeared to be strong 2011 first
quarter results released on March 23, 2011.

A major bullet in the 2011 first quarter release was the $12.73 vs. $(0.18) EPS
comparison for Q1 2011 and Q1 2010, respectively. However, a closer look reveals that
net income was aided by a one-time noncash gain. A review of a few of the bullets:


Sales in the quarter declined to $3.91 million, compared with $7.6 million a year
earlier.
The Company achieved income from operations in the period of $342,000.
However, mainly due to a non-cash reversal of allowance for bad debt generating
other income of $32,022,000 in the quarter, the Company reported net income of
$32.03 million or $12.73 per share, compared with a loss of $(446,000) or $(0.18)
per share a year earlier.


By our calculations, after stripping out noncash items from both years, the year over year
EPS comparison tells a different story:


2011 vs. 2010 First Quarter Adjusted EPS was nil vs. $0.33.


Here are some other figures in the 2011 first quarter 10Q:


Cash = $4,000
Account Receivables = $94.1 million or 6 times the current annualized revenue run
rate
Operating Cash Flow= ($1,000)
Tax Payable = $33 million


Investors may have also been excited about a few things addressed in the
company's 2011 first quarter release:


The renewal of its accounts receivable insurance:


The reversal of the allowance for bad debt is a consequence of the fact that
following a year-end write down of those doubtful accounts (accounts receivable) in
2010 which were not covered by an expired third party guarantee agreement, on
March 30, 2011 the Company entered into a Credit Guarantee Contract with Beijing
Xingwang Shidai Tech and Trading Co. Ltd. ("Xingwang") and Zhong Hui Guarantee
Corporation ("Zhonghui"), by which Zhonghui renewed its guarantee for any sales to
Xingwang. Under this new agreement, coverage was increased from RMB 300
million (U.S. $44.2 million) to not more than RMB 500 million (U.S. $73.6
million) up to the period ending December 31, 2011.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/276534-questioning-the-operations-of-orsus-xelent-technologies 3/9


The possibility that ORS's growth tract will awaken if it were to receive a life line:


Mr. Guoji Liu, CEO of the company, stated,


We are pressing ahead with our previously described plans for a strategic merger
and/or a capital raise and/or a loan to resolve our cash flow problem. We believe we
have made progress in this regard, but have not yet succeeded and cannot
predict the final outcome of our various discussions. It is only with success in
securing additional cash that we will be able to move forward with plans to
strengthen operations. These plans include a focus on product sales in developing
regions such as Africa and the introduction of new products that conform to
consumer demand and the needs of China's telecom operators.


Quite honestly, this is news we would have gone long on when China Hybrids were in
vogue not too long ago. As expected, such news has since led to an increase in the
company's stock price as investors possibly have re-priced its risk premium.


However, there are still significant risks to this story.


The status with the exchange is at risk:


NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwire - Apr 27, 2011) - Orsus Xelent Technologies, Inc.
("Orsus" or the "Company") reported today receipt of a letter from the NYSE Amex
LLC ("the Exchange"), which stated the Company is not in compliance with Section
1003 (a) (i) of the Exchange's Company Guide based on the Company's reporting of
less than $2 million in stockholders' equity and losses from continuing operations
and net losses in its two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2010; and
Section 1003 (a) (iv) of the Exchange's Company Guide with respect to its financial
condition, which makes it questionable in the opinion of the Exchange as to
whether the Company will be able to continue operations or timely meet its
obligations. Additionally, the Company has been advised its common shares may
not be suitable for auction market trading due to their low selling price.


The company very clearly stated that more pressing matters are at hand besides
attaining accounts receivable insurance:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/276534-questioning-the-operations-of-orsus-xelent-technologies 4/9


The Company noted the reversal in the quarter of the previously expensed bad debt
did not generate cash. The Company's most pressing concerns -- and the continuing
primary focus of management attention -- are cash flow and related going
concern issues. (2011 first quarter release)


The 2010 10K reveals that the clock is ticking for the company to resolve its liquidity
issues.


We anticipate that our cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements
only until the second quarter of 2011. We are evaluating various alternatives that
may include, among other things, a strategic merger possibility and an offering and
sale of equity, which, if successful, would improve our cash flow situation.


To be clear, ORS has been very up front about the risks it currently faces, risks that are
worthy of being aware of.


On-The-Ground Due Diligence


Based on our initial findings concerning, we decided to conduct some on-the-ground due
diligence ("OTGDD") to learn more about the company.


Our OTGDD findings follow:


We could not find evidence that ORS currently has any substantial business operations in
China;


Also based on ORS's 2010 10K filing, the company has only one PRC subsidiary, Beijing
Orsus Xelent Tech& Trading Company ("Beijing Orsus"). Beijing Orsus's official
registration SAIC address is, A206, Chengming Building, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng
District, Beijing.


Our investigator visited this address and found that Beijing Orsus has no active business
being conducted at this address. We found one other address for Beijing Orsus, 12th floor,
Block B, Chaowaimen, No. 26, Chaowai Ave, Beijing.


Under Google finance, this is ORS's address.


Our investigator also visited that address and once again found that Beijing Orsus has no
business operations of any kind at that location. Furthermore, this address belongs to a
clothing wholesale company.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/276534-questioning-the-operations-of-orsus-xelent-technologies 5/9


We also had our investigator visit two other addresses that are listed for ORS in its form
10-K filing in 2010:


1. The first address is, 29th Floor, Tower B, Chaowai MEN Office Building, 26 Chaowai
Street, Chaoyang Dist., Beijing. Our investigator found a company at this address
called Beijing Huanyitong Tech & Trading Company ("BHTT"). Based on BHTT's SAIC
file, we learned the company is 100% owned by Mr. Yongli Shi.
When reviewing the company's history we found that Yu Liu was BHTT's legal
representative and formerly owned but no longer owns 50% of the company. At the
same time, Yu Liu was and still remains a director of ORS. We believe that BHTT has
some kind of relationship with ORS since its address is listed in ORS's Form 10-K. We
do not, however, know the nature of the relationship between BHTT and ORS.
Regardless, since Mr. Shi owns 100% of BHTT, US investors have by definition no
ownership interest in what is apparently ORS's only connection to an operating
business.


2. The second address listed in the Form 10-K is, No. 1, Fuyou Street, Airport Huoyun
Road, Shunyi Dist., Beijing. When our investigator visited this address he found no
substantial business or even a sign indicating ORS occupied the address.


Key Take Away from Our OTGDD


It appears that ORS's subsidiary is not conducting any operations. More importantly, per
an address in SEC filings, the only company that may have a valid business, (Beijing
Huanyitong Tech & Trading Company), is not directly or indirectly owned by U.S.
shareholders. Instead, it is 100% owned by one Chinese individual, Mr. Yongli Shi.


Also, ORS claimed that it "on March 30, 2011, the company had entered into the Credit
Guarantee Contract with Beijing Xingwang Shidai Tech and Trading Co. Ltd. ("Xingwang")
and Zhong Hui Guarantee Corporation ("Zhonghui"), by which Zhonghui renewed its
guarantee for any sales to Xingwang." However, we still cannot confirm this news released
by ORS.


Additionally, even if this news is confirmed, based on our OTGDD ORS does not currently
conduct any substantial business activities and may not sell a material amount of products
and/or services to Beijing Xingwang Shidai Tech and Trading Co., Ltd. after March 30,
2011. Therefore, this guarantee to the accounts receivable may be useless to the
shareholders as there may not be any accounts receivable to insure.


Conclusion

The immediate short term will be critical for ORS given their statement that they only
have enough funds to sustain operations through June 30, 2011. We are currently short
this ORS, but acknowledge that its small float could send shares sharply higher if the
company is able to structure a lifesaving deal that investors are willing to trust in an
untrustworthy China Hybrid environment. We also suspect that stock promoters have
dug their heels in this name, which may have played a role in the rise in ORS shares in
the face of a tumbling ChinaHybrid market.


The Key Question is:


Even if ORS does rectify its liquidity problems or enter into game saving
transaction, can we trust the management team of a company where smoke and
mirrors seem to exist?


We choose not to believe management and deem ORS not to be investable.


If ORS does receive a lifeline in the way of financing, an acquisition or undertakes another
RTO transaction, we need to consider at what cost it will be in the current China RTO
environment. Investors will be asked to trust an RTO:


that appears to not have lived up to expectations in the past;
with SAIC filings that appear to significantly diverge from SEC filings;
which operates in an unpredictable industry that can lead to volatile quarterly financial
results;
that retains Kabani as its auditor;
that U.S. investors appear not to have a claim on operating assets.


Note: Reuters has also been following the ORS story. In general, their findings agree with
what our DD has unearthed. Reuters' more recent note was published after the close on
Friday, March 17, 2011. Please refer to the following passage from Friday's (May 17,
2011) release:


Li Yinsheng, (the personal secretary to Orsus Chief Executive Liu Guoji) gave
a new Beijing address for the company, on a different floor in the same building
listed on the website, and the new address was verified by Reuters.


We are speculating that part of the rise in ORS shares is due to investor excitement over
Reuters' validation of the "new Beijing Address." Reuters mentioned two addresses (two
different floors) of ORS in the same building and one of those is the "new Beijing address"
verified by Reuters.

Comments (13)


As we stated before, we did find two floors in the same building which may be relevant to
ORS. The first one is allegedly on the 12th floor which is currently occupied by a clothing
wholesale company, while the 29th floor location is now occupied by BHTT. Furthermore,
our investigator visited the administrative office of the building. The manager of the
building showed him the complete registration book for the building and Beijing Orsus is
not listed as a tenant.


As stated before, ORS does not claim any direct and/or indirect ownership control of
BHTT in its SEC filings. Investors should realize that the operations of BHTT on the 29th
floor are not directly and/or indirectly owned by U.S. investors. More plainly said, given the
current corporate structure, US investors do not have a claim on the cash flows of
BHTT's 29th floor operations which we assume is the "new Beijing address" mentioned by
Reuters. We have contacted Reuters to confirm with them that the "new Beijing" address
they reference is the same as the 29th floor address we visited. This is currently our
assumption.


Disclosure: I am short ORS.

ORS has confessed to not paying employees and other suppliers. I concluded they were shady long ago. They should
have liquidated long ago for investors, but it seems the 'liquidation' has been through XinWang Shidai, and if that is
true we are talking about another fraud.

The question is: how can we short it? There are no options available, and none of the main brokers can borrow
shares!


Any ideas / advice ?

Forced buy-ins by brokers. I was holding a long-term short and got bought in. That's what sucks about these
low float scams. Over the long run, it's a sure bet that it will be worthless, but holding a long-term short is risky
if your shares get recalled and you're underwater on your position. Unfortunately the shorting and delivery
rules favor the stock manipulators and help to create short squeezes.
