Richard Pearson Responds On Ziopharm
Oct. 26, 2012 1:48 PM ET87 comments
by: Richard Pearson


This article is being published in response to "The Bears Weigh in on Ziopharm" which
was published on Seeking Alpha on Tuesday and then removed on Wednesday.


Last week I posted an online article discussing a number of very significant and
concerning issues at Ziopharm Oncology (NASDAQ:ZIOP). The article was quickly pulled
from my blog at that site without my knowledge or permission. As of this writing, I still have
not been given any reason for why it was pulled. Although many people have taken
serious issue with my conclusions, the site raised precisely zero concerns about the
accuracy of anything in that article. However, the message that was sent to the world by
pulling the article left a very clear impression that I was inaccurate. For those interested,
the original article can now be found at moxreports.com, and the site is open for
comments by anyone.


I had previously posted negative articles to my blog; however, in the past the simple
solution was to give the subject company a forum to publish their own response and then
let readers make their own decision. For reasons that are not yet clear, this situation was
handled in a dramatically different way.


Following the article, ZIOP issued a very brief press release stating I was "wrong" and
then went on to state a number of reassuring facts about the company and about
Palifosfamide. Although the press release strongly implied that my individual facts were
"wrong", it is interesting that they did not specifically point to anything I said that was
different than what they were claiming in the press release. Investors should re-read the
press release along with my article to confirm this for themselves. These points are
addressed individually below.


ZIOP has now had a full week to issue a more detailed response, but they have chosen to
stick with their very brief initial response. And instead they quickly put out another
"compelling" press release showing how a different drug just achieved a key milestone. So
the message seems to be that Pali just became less important, and now we should focus
our attention elsewhere. Due to the timing of this release, I suspect that their upcoming
equity offering could be sooner than previously expected. If this isn't obvious to people, it
certainly should be.

Although ZIOP has refrained from issuing any further comments on how I was wrong, this
message did end up getting out in a prominent way. On Tuesday, an article ("The Bears
Weigh in on Ziopharm") came out on Seeking Alpha by a poster using the name Wall
Street Teacher which expanded upon the points made in the press release to include the
author's own analysis and commentary and which claimed that it pointed out some
massive mistakes in my article.


As it turns out, Wall Street Teacher has a notably exclusive publishing history regarding
ZIOP. He has written about ZIOP over 100 times on Seeking Alpha, including 8 published
articles and 24 instablogs and extensive brief bullish comments. During this time, which
spans 4 full years, he has focused on just one other company in just a few short
paragraphs on only two occasions. Effectively, Wall Street Teacher has only written on a
single company for 4 solid years: ZIOP.


This exclusive publishing history becomes all the more noteworthy when we find out that
his most recent article contained numerous material misstatements of fact.


I have posted a printed out pdf of his "The Bears Weigh in on Ziopharm" at
moxreports.com. I strongly encourage investors to re-read his entire story.


I address each of his factual misstatements below along with links to the supporting data;
however, first it seems more important to address the current investment case at ZIOP. In
other words: what do all of these things have to do with the stock price?


My investment thesis on ZIOP is far simpler than the many concerning observations I
raised in my article. Those observations are closely related, though, and serve to highlight
the non-disclosure pattern which supports my thesis entirely.


The investment thesis is this:


1. As of February 2012, ZIOP disclosed that 70% of "events" had already occurred in
Phase 2. 70% of the subjects had already died or their tumors had already progressed.
Based on this, and since it is now 10 months later, ZIOP already knows the detailed and
final conclusions which can be drawn from the data regarding OS and PFS.


2. If the data were compelling, ZIOP would have already issued a "compelling" press
release many months ago. Instead, they have only put forth very preliminary headline data
and a new "compelling" press release for an unrelated drug's Phase 1 results.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 3/49


3. Since the detailed data from Phase 2 has not been publicly released, we can come to
the conclusion that it will not be "compelling". Instead we are told to simply wait for Phase
3.


4. In order to get through Phase 3, ZIOP will eventually need to raise money through a
stock offering. But because I feel that Ziopharm has already telegraphed mediocre data in
Phase 2, ZIOP will complete its stock offering BEFORE releasing any detailed data on
either Phase 2 or Phase 3. At this time, we will all know the results. Because if the offering
is done before the release of data, then we know that it is not good.


5. At that time, the stock will make a significant correction because the answer has been
already telegraphed to the market.


6. The "compelling" press release describing Phase I data for a different drug seems to
give investors a new reason to buy the stock, diminishing the current focus on the FDA
uncertainty and stability issues with Palifosfamide. This strategy appears to have worked,
but only just a little, because the stock closed up 1.98% that day.


7. This sudden new development makes me believe that the follow on stock offering will
happen in November, sooner than I had expected.


Thesis summary:


Because ZIOP has already telegraphed its knowledge of mediocre results from Phase 2
data (by not releasing that data), ZIOP will issue stock well before releasing Phase 3 data
and the stock will fall. By December, the market would already have seen this very clearly,
so it is more likely that an equity offering would occur in November. The data which has
been expected in Q4 will ultimately be released much later (guessing March or April) and
will show mediocre results. The stock will fall further.


The points raised in my article all point to a single conclusion: that ZIOP has demonstrated
a persistent pattern of non-disclosure and lack of transparency that has extended back
many years. Examples include the undisclosed FDA warning letter, the 4 month delay in
disclosing an SEC inquiry, the delay in disclosing the termination of their CMO for 7
months, the past reassuring statements that no additional funding would be required and
the undisclosed ultra short stability of Palifosfamide.


Those are the reasons why investors (such as myself) remain short the stock despite the
obvious and terrible risk reward ratio of shorting any biotech stock with pending data.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 4/49


Keep in mind, there were nearly 12 million shares short last week and only 7 million
shares traded between all longs and shorts. So it is safe to say that there is still a huge
short bet against the stock.


Moving on, the mistakes and erroneous conclusions in the Wall Street Teacher's article
should be corrected as follows:


#1 - FDA's evaluation of Phase 2 data prior to Phase 3


Wall Street Teacher says:


"Clearly, the Phase II data is fine since the FDA approved the trial design, parameters,
and commencement of the Phase III trial. No other conclusion can be drawn. Perhaps
Pearson doesn't understand the science."


Response:


This is too simple. As it turns out, even Wall Street Teacher himself makes clear that the
FDA made absolutely no evaluation of the quality or expected outcomes of data in Phase
II, because the FDA's job was only to approve "the design, parameters and
commencement of the Phase III trial". Wall Street Teacher's statement that approval of
Phase III means good data in Phase II is wrong. Period. And any suggestion to the
contrary reflects a distinct lack of ability to "understand the science".


#2 - The independent audit was conducted AFTER the early stopping of the Phase 2
trial. ZIOP conveniently failed to mention this.


Dr. Chawla made no mention of the "independent audit" in his response dated September
14th, 2009. The Phase 2 trial was halted just 2 weeks later, which is not enough time to
even conduct such an audit. The FDA's audit in August lasted 3 full weeks just to identify
the problems, so the harder job of evaluating the impact of these problems was not
possible in just 2 weeks.


Conclusion:


Because the independent audit was conducted AFTER the early stopping of the Phase 2
trial, ZIOP had no idea as to whether or not the violations had an impact on the study.
ZIOP would have had no basis for calling these violations immaterial. By stating that the
site and data were audited without saying when this occurred, ZIOP has given a very
misleading impression to readers that the audit was done before the Rodman financing
and before the Phase 2 trial was stopped early. This was not the case.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 5/49


#3 - The Form 483 / warning letter was in fact issued to Dr. Chawla and should have
been disclosed by ZIOP under any and all circumstances because it was highly
material.


a) Wall Street Teacher incorrectly leads his readers to believe that I had stated that this
letter was issued to ZIOP, not to Dr. Chawla. This is not true. In fact, BECAUSE the letter
had been issued to Dr. Chawla and not to ZIOP, the words "Ziopharm" and "Palifosfamide"
had been redacted from the letter. I made this clear.


b) Even though the 483 and warning letter were issued to Dr. Chawla and not directly to
ZIOP, the letter was highly material to investors in the Rodman led stock offering for the
following reasons:


· Significance: Dr. Chawla had been the lead / co-principal investigator in the trials, so his
role was very important in the trial.


· Severity: The language of the letter was extremely severe, and challenged both the
"reliability and integrity of the data," which would be alarming to investors had it been
disclosed.


· Recency: The letter had been issued just 8 business days before the Rodman financing


· Rarity: It is also extremely rare for clinical trial investigators to receive such a letter (only
18 letters issued to clinical trial operators in that year, despite 13,000 FDA trials ongoing.)
This information can be found on the FDA's website and was summarized in this
presentation. Wall Street Teacher "checked" this and tells us that this data is false and that
Form 483's are not rare. They are rare for clinical investigators - very, very rare.


For one of the violations, the FDA did note that "We find your corrective measures to
prevent future recurrence to be acceptable, IF implemented as proposed". Wall Street
Teacher would have us believe that this observation applied to the entire letter, which it did
not. In fact, the FDA still noted that "we are concerned that the response is not adequate
to prevent future recurrence of the violation noted above" with the previous violation.


Conclusion:


Pointing out that the letter was issued to Dr. Chawla and not to ZIOP implies that I said
otherwise and thus my information should not be relied upon at all. It also implies that this
fact makes the letter immaterial. Neither is true. And of course, for Dr. Chawla to receive
such a letter is demonstrably an extremely rare event despite our assurances that Wall
Street Teacher "checked" this for us and provided no data.

#4 - Stability is an "issue" for Palifosfamide


Wall Street Teacher simply repeats what was said in the press release, and assures us
that there the company has no "issues" with Palifosfamide. ZIOP's response to stability
consisted simply of one reassuring sentence as follows:


"Further, the company has no issues with drug stability."


Perhaps that solitary sentence could be completely reassuring in addressing such a
complicated subject. However, the "issue" is that Palifosfamide must be administered to a
patient within 30 minutes of entering an IV bag. Comparable drugs for comparable
indications have a stability time which is measured in DAYS, not in minutes. Unless
Palifosfamide turned out to be the ONLY alternative AND was demonstrated as being
highly effective, then there would undoubtedly be commercial implications. Revenues
would be impacted. However, ZIOP made it clear that they simply have no "issues" with
instability. Prior to my article, it was never mentioned that this drug had such an
abnormally short shelf life, and following my article they have still not addressed this
impact. JMP Securities did come out immediately and say that:


"We are confident that the current formulation has no stability issues that would impact
commercial adoption should the Phase III data be supportive of regulatory approval."


Thank you JMP Securities for this objective opinion and for the underwriting services and
conference exposure provided to ZIOP over the past few years. But given that my article
was released on a Friday and JMP provided this opinion on Monday, I find it difficult to
believe that JMP spoke with very many oncologists, pharmacists or chemo nurses over
the weekend before releasing such a categorical and succinct analysis. I did however
speak with many such medical professionals, and it took me two full months to reach a
conclusion. In my report, one of my citations was to a report entitled: "Guidelines for the
practical stability studies of anticancer drugs".


I strongly encourage readers to download this report and read it in full. I would also
encourage JMP Securities to address the findings of this very recent and specific report.
To the best of my knowledge, JMP has never produced any findings whatsoever on the
subject of drug stability vs. commercial viability for ZIOP or any other company. So
presumably they conducted all of their in depth research on this completely new topic over
a single weekend.


Conclusion:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 7/49


Aside from single-sentence reassurances about having "no issues" with stability, no one -
including ZIOP, Wall Street Teacher or JMP Securities - has addressed the obvious real-
world commercial implications of an extremely expensive drug that has an ultra short and
impractical shelf life.


#5 - PPHM was highly relevant to ZIOP


Like ZIOP, Peregrine is a biotech company focused on cancer drugs


Like ZIOP, Peregrine has virtually no revenues


Like ZIOP, Peregrine had a market cap of $400-500 million


Like ZIOP, Peregrine was trading at around $5.00 per share


Like ZIOP, Peregrine's near term financial future hinged mostly on a single drug


Like ZIOP, Peregrine encountered issues during its Phase 2 trials


Conclusion:


When a pre-revenue biotech company with only one near term commercial drug prospect
encounters uncertainty in its clinical trails, there can be tremendous downside in a short
period of time. In addition, when these issues are not disclosed, they could be perceived
as being even more problematic due to increased uncertainty. Therefore, PPHM is
precisely comparable and relevant to ZIOP, despite the assurances of Wall Street Teacher
that it is irrelevant.


#6 - The SEC inquiry and termination of the CMO were not disclosed until a much
later date.


Wall Street Teacher points out that ZIOP did actually disclose the SEC inquiry and
termination of the former CMO, and he states that I simply had not even seen the relevant
8K.


In fact, not only did I see it, but I also included a quote from it and a link to it in my article.
The 8K was filed in December 2011, 4 months AFTER receiving notice from the SEC, and
7 months after the termination of the CMO. The announcement that a new CMO was hired
only came 2 months after the termination of the former CMO, during which time we had no
clue that the company had no CMO in place, or that the reason for this was a termination.


Conclusion:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 8/49


This illustrates a pattern of disclosure behavior at ZIOP which makes me believe that "the
only news is good news". This pattern is highly relevant in taking an outlook over the next
few months.


#7 - The options activity highlighted by Wall Street Teacher is not only inaccurate,
but it is also surprisingly LOW, not surprisingly HIGH.


This one seems too obvious to be an oversight. His data can be seen in his article. The
Teacher encourages us to "take a long hard look at the trading in the Oct. 4 and 5 puts. ".
And he even points out that "these puts expired on the same day the article was
released."


Unfortunately, once again the Teacher has materially misled his class and has stated
some very obvious factual errors. First, he highlights options for the WRONG month,
showing puts which expire in November - a full month after the article was written.
Second, he states that, "It is amazing that someone had the foresight to purchase these
soon-to-expire contracts prior to the publication of Pearson's article". Yet even in his
already incorrect data table, he only cites end of day numbers, including all activity before
and after the article was published. Given the volume and volatility of the stock, one would
assume that there would be substantial activity AFTER the article was published when the
stock dropped as low as $3.36. Third, although the Teacher made it a point to mention in
his article that over 7 million shares traded that day, he failed to point out that in his table
only 2,592 options traded all day, representing just 259,200 shares which is just 3% of the
share volume that day. Again, this is relatively small, not relatively large.


Conclusion:


Wall Street Teacher provided erroneous data which was not even connected to his
assertion (wrong month) and furthermore, that data does not even support the conclusion
which he draws because options activity was surprisingly LOW, not surprisingly HIGH on a
day with such volume and volatility.


Overall conclusions:


Don't trust me, don't trust Wall Street Teacher, because we both have a vested interest in
the share price of ZIOP. But please keep in mind that I use my real name in my articles
and bio information, so you know exactly who I am. Also keep in mind that I have written
about hundreds of companies over the past 4 years in both long and short articles on a
variety of websites. Wall Street Teacher seems to have a long and peculiar history of
writing about just one company over 100 times without revealing who he is or what his

connection is with ZIOP. Perhaps he's just a very passionate shareholder who has been
hanging on and buying more for a 4 year period without looking at any other stocks. Or
perhaps not. Contacting him to ask would be a great first step for anyone who is curious. I
have already done so, and continue to look into it elsewhere.


The raw data is verifiable and tells a very clear story. A comparison of all these documents
can be done in one easy place at moxreports.com, for those who care about knowing the
facts for themselves, as opposed to the interpretations of others.


With short interest standing at around 10 million shares for most of 2012 and only 7 million
shares traded (by both longs and shorts) last Friday, it seems clear that large investors
continue to make a very big bet against ZIOP despite the apparently terrible risk / reward
ratio based on something other than just the undisclosed FDA warning letter or the longer
term revenue impact of instability.


It is highly likely that ZIOP will conduct a follow-on stock offering BEFORE releasing any
Phase 3 data, and this will telegraph to investors the mediocrity of the results for
Palifosfamide. At that time, the stock will see a disproportionate drop.


So as a result, I am planning on staying short this stock until after the pre-data follow on
equity offering which I expect to occur in November. (Hint: By December, anyone would
know what is going on here, so it would be too late. Hence, November.)

Wow, I have never seen more of a persistent and pathetic unprofessional writer in my whole life of investing. Here you
are writing again after publishing an article on Forbes that shocked many longs into selling while you profited from
your gains of being short. Yet the stock rebounded due to more smart people knowing better, with a keen eye that the
Pali drug will do well (likely) and will be approved by the FDA,..... because dying patients are in need of new
therapies. You should be ashamed of yourself and I seriously hope that someone files a lawsuit against you.

See my comments below - when he called ZIOP CEO's integrity into question anyone who knows Dr Lewis
knew that his short position must have clouded his judgement. I address some of his points at the bottom in a
comment. And I am adding this dip as I did in the 3's last friday when he temporarily knocked this down.

Another one of Mr Pearson's misleading comments in the original article that Forbes deleted was that there
was little insider buying.


RJ Kirk is the best and most successful biotech investors I have seen in my 25 yrs of investing in biotech. Mr
Pearson suggested there was no insider buying - which is a total bold face lie. Form 4's are required by the
SEC when insiders buy and there are a ton of RJ Kirk buys on the open market in the high $4s and $5.xx
area and millions more in secondaries in the $5.20 and $5.75 that Kirk took a huge part of and Fidelity also
bought substantial stock. Billionaire Director RJ Kirk - who many see as the smartest biotech investors in the
world - bought his initial $29 million shrs at 4.80 and another $27 mill from 4's and 5's much on open mkt....


A quick search of SEC.gov you will find it - table below may not paste well but you get the idea. It was very
misleading that there is little insider buying.

The FDA reviewed the Phase 2 data as did ASCO. ASCO awarded it "best of ASCO". The FDA thought it was
good enough to approve a phase 3 trial design and allow patients to be dosed in that trial. This is no easy feat
- I have been in biotech for 25 yrs. An independent data monitoring committee has positively reviewed the
Picasso 3 trial TWICE and allowed it to continue. The SEC reviewed this same "lack of material disclosure
complaint" about this Ph 2 letter submitted by 2 disgruntled employees - and found out that this was not a
material matter that needed to be disclosed (probably because the FDA saw it had no impact on the results of
the trial). Lets see the SEC says there was no violation of disclosure rules but now twice in 2 weeks Mr
Pearson asserts there was. Trust me as a former CFO of a NYSE company, there was none.


The comparison to PPHM is about as laughable as it comes of course this is nothing like PPHM which
ITSELF disclosed the data descrepency and off course did not have an audit that cleared it and did not have
the FDA say the corrective measures are acceptable and of course did not have the FDA approve a
subsequent Ph 3 trial design and launch that is almost completed.

Author’s reply »  For someone who has "been in biotech for 25 years" your description of the FDA approval
process is surprisingly...wrong. Over those 25 years you would no doubt have learned that the the FDA
doesn't even remotely "pass" a drug on Phase 2 trials. Instead, the approve the design of the Phase 3 trial
and let it proceed if the sponsor chooses to as long as the sponsor can claim some level of effectiveness
based upon data which the FDA does not review. You would also know quite well that the FDA isn't even
remotely able to conduct such analysis on the numerous early-mid stage drugs that reach Phase 2 - they
don't have the budget or the staff to even make it possible. To verify this, interested parties should review the
budget and staffing data which prove the point for the FDA in 2012 at http://1.usa.gov/QPmChN  
Readers should find the level of underfunding and understaffing disturbing given the scope of the FDA's
declared mandate.


I would suggest that readers call the FDA directly, however it took me over 2 weeks to get a call back from
anyone despite the alarming messages I left concerning a public health issue. I was not calling central
recorded lines, I was calling the direct extensions of senior FDA officals, none of whom answer their phones
and all of which go straight to voice mail with no option to hit "0" to speak with a live person. For those who
wish to repeat this experiment, I am confidant that within 2 weeks or so you will no longer place much faith in
the FDA approval process or infer any significant validation due to "passing" phase 2.


Another link you may find informative is this one, which is basically "FDA approvals for Dummies" 
http://1.usa.gov/XIVgxq


But after 25 years you must know all of this. It is just surprising that you would say otherwise.


I was however impressed about your detailed knowledge of the SEC inquiry. None of the details you state
above have been made public and are known only by ZIOP and the SEC. I have made every effort to find out
more through my own discussions with the SEC and review of all public filings, and have not seen any
reference to the Phase 2 Warning Letter, or even to Phase 2 at all. This includes the 8K which you seem to be
referencing. http://bit.ly/Rgq6rG


At no point in time has the SEC given any indication that their inquiry is closed, and it certainly has never ever
stated that " this was not a material matter that needed to be disclosed".... I have personally called the SEC to
get such clarity and they will give none.


So while I wold like to "trust you" as a "former CFO of a NYSE company", the statements you have made
above are materially and provably incorrect. Unlike you, I never ask anyone to ever "trust me". Instead I
provide links to the data and the public filings that prove what I say. I also encourage people to be skeptical of
my findings and verify details for themselves. Interested parties can contact the US SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330
to learn how to get more info on this subject. It takes patience and a number of phone calls, but it will allow
individual investors to stop "trusting" you or me and determine for themselves.

Finally, you are right about one thing. PPHM did disclose its problems voluntarily. This is why I said that ZIOP
is WORSE than PPHM. Your lack of respect for proper disclosure practices is concerning given that you claim
to be the "former CFO of a NYSE company". And your repeated posting of inaccurate data regarding Kirk's
purchases, the Dec '11 8K and the FDA approval process strikes me as either sloppy to the point of
negligence, unethical, or both.

Mr Pearson says " In order to get through Phase 3, ZIOP will eventually need to raise money through a stock
offering". I strongly disagree with this assertion. If you look at the companies latest quarterly report at the link
below you will see that the company had over $110 million of cash as of June 30th. The Phase 3 trial is
nearing completion with data expected this quarter. If you asked 100 biotech experts if the company will need
to raise money to get through this Phase 3 trial, 100 would tell you that there is no way they will need
additional financing to complete this phase 3 trial. It is simply not a valid statement. Similar to the lack of
insider buying statement in the forbes article that did not highlight the ZIOP Form 4's showing an insiders
initial $29 million shrs at 4.80 and another $27 mill from 4's and 5's much on open market by an insider that
required serval Form 4's - see comment below. Similar to the comment that the company will likely issue
stock in a secondary soon - if you simply call the company they will tell you there is no secondary currently
planned.

More double speak - if the FDA had any problems with the Ph 2 trial they would not have approved a Phase 3
trial design. Also the Phase 3 is well underway and has had TWO - not one TWO - positive interim reviews by
an independent data monitoring committee and we should get data this quarter so to me to harp on a yrs old
Ph 2 when a Ph 3 is almost completed.


This of course is the very Ph 3 you told readers the companies will need a financing to complete - another
comment that shows you have not done nearly enough due diligence to opine on ZIOP or any other biotech
company. If you look at the companies latest quarterly report at the link below you will see that the company
had over $110 million of cash as of June 30th. The Phase 3 trial is nearing completion with data expected this
quarter. If you asked 100 biotech experts if the company will need to raise money to get through this Phase 3
trial, 100 would tell you that there is no way they will need additional financing to complete this phase 3 trial. It
is simply not a valid statement.


I feel rather comfortable after my due diligence that the SEC conclusion that there was no material lack of
disclosure as asserted by the disgruntled ex-employees is the same issue you are resurfacing.

1) Did you inform any investor or hedge fund that this negative article was going to be published before it

2) Did you get any of this information from the disgruntled ex employees of ZIOP who previously reported this
"lack of disclosure" to the SEC (Company issued an 8k a long time ago disclosing that that issue was
resolved by the SEC - there was no material lack of disclosure - SEC already reviewed the ex-employees
claims of lack of disclosure and clearly concluded that there was none. If this is the same issue - then Mr
Pearson's lack of material disclosure claim has already been reviewed by SEC.

Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  As is becoming common....the data you are relying on from Yahoo is wrong. Period. When
people are too lazy to read actual filings, they then post information that is wrong and other people start to
rely on that information. I will be putting out an article or instablog (depending on length) on the RJ Kirk
ACTUAL investment details shortly.


The following 8K from Jan 2011 describes Kirk's initial purchase in great detail, and it shows that yahoo's
automatically generated data is 100% wrong. http://bit.ly/TUimlr


If you look at the details he ended up acquiring a 14.5% stake in ZIOP for just 9 cents per share. I am not
kidding nor am I lying. If you are not already aware of this fact, then it is only because you have not read the
filings.


As shown in filing describing the Channel Partner Agreement: 
Kirk / Intrexon "paid" $11.6 million for an initial tranche of ONLY 2.4m shares = $4.80 per share. That is why
Yahoo says $4.80 per share.


However he also immediately received 3.6m shares for FREE ! If you do the math, that means he really only
paid $1.91 per share.


That initial purchase also entitled him to 3.6m MORE FREE SHARES upon Phase 2 dosing, which he
received last week. This means he has now received 9.7m shares under the Channel Partner Agreement in
exchange for $11.6m cash. This is $1.20 per share. (feel free to check my math).


It gets better, under that same agreement from 2011, ZIOP has now already GIVEN BACK to Intrexon
$10.7m. See here.


http://bit.ly/RufXtt


So the economics of this transaction are as follows: 
1. Kirk/Intrex gives $11.6m to ZIOP 
2. Kirk/Intrex receives a total of 9.7m shares ($1.20/sh) 
3. ZIOP then gives Kirk/Intrex back his money ($10.7m) 
4. So Kirk's real cost is....$900,000 for 9.7m shares 
5. This is only 9 cents per share - effectively free

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 15/49


This is the true look-through economics of the transaction and is how any institutional investor would look at
them. This is also why Kirk could feel safe saying "he didn't even bother to due due diligence" on Pali - see
link.


http://onforb.es/TUilxR


It reflects how much did Kirk ACTUALLY pay vs. how many shares he received. Yahoo states that Kirk paid
$4.80 on 9.7m shares, which we know is wrong because Kirk received fully 75% of those shares for FREE.
Yahoo says that Kirk "paid" $29m for these shares, even though he only paid $11.6m as expressly shown in
the filing.


So please check your numbers before posting things like this. This is obviously very detailed and requires
more than just clicking Yahoo and reading. I am well aware of this and I assume that it was an accident /
oversight on your part.


The subsequent numbers on Yahoo are mostly (but NOT ALL) correct.


After the initial 9.7m shares at 9 cents, Kirk did spend an additional $27m at average prices of $5.28 per
share over 18 months. (the yahoo numbers on these purchases are mostly correct and consistent with SEC
filings)


The net result of all of this is that following his new free shares received last week, Kirk owns 18% of ZIOP at
an all in price of $1.92 (almost identical to his initial CPA price). 14.9m shares total, all in in price of $1.92.


Kirk has been able to achieve that even though the stock during that time has ranged from $3.85-$7.70 (prior
to my article)


So Kirk was able to acquire 18% of the company at a price which is LESS THAN 1/2 OF THE 2 YEAR LOW.


Based on this, I continue to state that Kirk is in fact a genius.


Unfortunately, the rest of us do not have the ability this way and are forced to punt on a biotech stock at $5.00
+/-. If this stock drops by 60%, RJ Kirk will not lose a single dime. Unlike the rest of the world, ie. retail
investors in ZIOP.

Author’s reply »  because you didn't specify the saline content. are you assuming the standard 0.9% saline
solution which is typically used by hospitals because it is approximately the same salt content as human
blood ? or are you referring to something like the 14.6% solution that Abbot resulted in the lawsuit with Abbott

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 16/49


salt content helps all fast decay drugs with stability, so clearly the 14.6% would be better for ZIOP...except
that it is in shortage across the country...oh, and even with 14.6% the drug is still less stable than any other
chemo drug for comparable indications (ie. same problem) - in answer to your question though...in 0.9% the
solution must be put into IV bag within 60 minutes, with 14.6% (if even available) this goes to 120
minutes...but ZIOP knows that 14.6% is often not even available which is why they specifically point this out in
their docs....this means they DO in fact KNOW about the stability "issue" because their own docs point out the
problem.... and if you ask any random chemo nurse about the reality of 60-120 minutes in a real chemo ward,
they will tell you that it is an "issue" for sure.


and to be clear - I already addressed the saline stability of Pali in my original article on Oct 19, since you
haven't read it, perhaps you should spend a few moments and do so.


so...ummm...what was your point again ? was it that "Pearson doesn't know the answer" or was it that "Pali
has stability issues". I assume it was the later, because your question proves my point. again.


ps - thanks again for the comment !


30 Oct 2012, 04:47 PM


bio.bobby
My specific question is what precisely is the half life of palifosfamide in the 0.9% saline that you state is being
used.


Pretty simple question that has an exact answer in hours/minutes. That you are explicitly not answering this
makes it pretty clear you don't actually know what this value is. Given this is half your thesis, this strikes me
as a weak argument.


So, yes, my point is "Pearson doesn't know the answer".

Entire basis of the misleading post above is that Kirk gets "free" shrs which he avgs into his shares bought for
$5.75, $5.20, etc. So untrue its disturbing.


I have only commented on two articles in Seeking Alpha. Both from short sellers with twisted innuendo and
leaving things out. Last one was a yr ago when a short seller put an article out like Mr Pearson did telling you
he was short IOC when it went down to 39 and 40. I challenged his misleading article and the stock
eventually went from $39 to $90 plus.


I have better things to do with my time - but this Kirk buy post is particularly misleading. Kirk has bought
millions this yr in a secondary at $5.20. Millions more at $5.75 - $10 million. More on open market - in the high

Mr Pearson is very misleading calling certain shares - free - which of course is totally wrong. Once again he
quotes only the negatives from a document and leaves out the most important part:


Free?!?! - not quite. The rights to all cancer indications of Intrexon - many think this technology will change
medicine.. and Mr Pearson calls the shares "free". This is more deceptive than some of the things in that IOC
article. The result will be the same though. ZIOP will more than double and Mr Pearson will be proven wrong.


"On January 6, 2011, ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Exclusive Channel Partner
Agreement (the “Channel Agreement”) with Intrexon Corporation (“Intrexon”) that governs a “channel
partnering” arrangement in which the Company will use Intrexon’s technology directed towards in vivo
expression of effectors in connection with the development of two existing clinical-stage product candidates
and generally to research, develop and commercialize products, in each case in which DNA is administered
to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer
(collectively, the “Cancer Program”). The Channel Agreement establishes committees comprised of Company
and Intrexon representatives that will govern activities related to the Cancer Program in the areas of project
establishment, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical and regulatory matters, commercialization
efforts and intellectual property.


The Channel Agreement grants the Company a worldwide license to use specified patents and other
intellectual property of Intrexon in connection with the research, development, use, importing, manufacture,
sale, and offer for sale of products involving DNA administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer
effectors for the purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer (“ZIOPHARM Products”). Such license is
exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of
ZIOPHARM Products, and otherwise is non-exclusive. Subject to limited exceptions, the Company may not
sublicense the rights described without Intrexon’s written consent."

Author’s reply »  Apologies, when I used the term "free" I should have used what was in the 8K. The shares
are not "free" they were given to intrex for $0.001 (ie. one tenth of one cent....) But once again, you got me.
One tenth of one penny is not actually free. In fact it means that on this tranche, Kirk paid $3,660 (three
thousand six hundred sixty six dollars) in exchange for 7.495% of the entire company !! What a great deal,
even I would buy ZIOP at that price. And note, that was only PARTIAL consideration given to Kirk, meaning
that he got even more of these (almost, but not quite) FREE shares. see below.


[Here is the first tranche 7.495% of company at $0.001 per share] 
[The caps emphasis was added by me. No change to any language] 
At the same time, the Company has agreed to issue to Intrexon a number of additional shares of Company
common stock equal to 7.495% of the number of shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding
prior to such issuance (the “First Tranche Shares”) at a purchase price equal to the $0.001 par value of such
shares, which price will be deemed paid in PARTIAL CONSIDERATION consideration for the execution and
delivery of the Channel Agreement.


[Here is the second tranche...an ADDITIONAL 7.495% also for $0.001 per share - but as you note, not
actually "Free"]


The Company has also agreed to issue additional shares of Company common stock to Intrexon upon dosing
of the first patient in a ZIOPHARM-conducted Phase II clinical trial in the United States, or similar study as the
parties may agree in a country other than the United States, of a product that is created, produced, developed
or identified directly or indirectly by the Company during the term of the Channel Agreement and that, subject
to certain exceptions, involves DNA administered to humans for expression of anti-cancer effectors for the
purpose of treatment or prophylaxis of cancer. Upon satisfaction of such contingency, the Company has
agreed to issue to Intrexon an additional number of shares of Company common stock equal to 7.495% of the
number of shares Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Tranche
Closing (the “Second Tranche Shares”) for a purchase price equal to the $0.001 par value of such shares,
which price will be deemed paid in Partial CONSIDERATION for the execution and delivery of the Channel
Agreement.

You continue to purposely mislead. In transactions cash is often not the only thing companies receive.


Companies buy other companies and pipelines for stock all the time - and don't receive cash at all. You are
totally and purposely misleading with your comments.


The company received the rights to ALL cancer indications of ZIOP for shares - and also got the best biotech
investor in the world (and Fidelity has followed) to continue to invest in secondaries at $5.20 and $5.75. Your
myopic view of calculating only the cash is ludicrous. It is obvious you are purposely misleading. There would
be a line if ZIOP offered this IP after the IL-12 melanoma results and Ph 2 commencements that would pay a
lot more than ZIOP did. No one will ever get such a broad deal again.


I am personally going to submit a request to the SEC because of these comments and ask them to review the

The assertion that ZIOP released the IL-12 data to divert attention from pali is ridiculous. The company had stated
many times over the last year that IL-12 data was on the way.


You're right about one thing Pearson - WST is long and therefore biased. You are short and therefore biased. The
difference is that WST is a decent human being who is writing about a company that he believes in and that is trying
to cure cancer. You are scum colluding with hedge funds to steal shares from people who work for a living.

This guy continues with doublespeak and innuendo on ZIOP. Its clear to me why Forbes pulled a similar ZIOP short
piece he wrote - to me it sites negatives and leaves out important information. 50 of 50 people I know who have read

5/22/2018 Richard Pearson Responds On Ziopharm - ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIOP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 22/49


it and then the JMP report and company PR felt the article was misleading.


Now he again makes up the totally false suggestion that ZIOP is about to issue stock before the Phase 3 data - a total
lie - all you have to do is call the company and they will tell you clearly and loudly - THERE WILL BE NO
SECONDARY BEFORE THE DATA.


The Phase 2 data was great - it was awarded "best of ASCO" status and the company was meticulous is recruiting
the ph 3 patients - a big positive that shorts distorted as a negative. Its rather clear that with a 2029 patent and
possible additional indications like SCLC and even a combination with IL-12 (amazing data in melanoma announced
yesterday) - that Big Pharma will likely partner palifosfamide similar to deals that ECYT and others got. I have
followed ZIOP for yrs and am a large investor and am so confident in the Ph 3 data, I pray they do a deal AFTER the
data and not before because they could get $200 million up front if the data is good + milestone future payments of a
lot more.


Mr Pearson also totally ignores that RJ Kirk is a director, partner and big backer of ZIOP so funding will not be an
issue. Fidelity has also followed Mr Kirk into Clinical data and into ZIOP.


But why should we be surprised that Mr Pearson's comments above support his short thesis when we see what he
did with his previous ZIOP short report that was pulled from Forbes. The whole basis of his comments were that the
Picasso 2 trial (best of ASCO) somehow must have bad results. He mentions a mis-dosed patient - and 50 of 50
people I talked to who read his article assumed he was referring to the Picasso 2 trial. Alas - we find that that patient
WAS NOT EVEN IN THE Picasso 2 trial. Sure he lumped it in with other things so later he could defend that he didn't
say it - but again 50 of 50 people I talked to believed he was saying it was the Picasso2 trial - as that trial was what
his article was about.


He mentions OS outcome for this ph 2 trial when this trial was not even powered for OS - like many Ph 2 trials. He
also doesn't mention that the FDA panel and final approval of Votrient clearly makes the bar for approval in deadly
Sarcoma PFS.


Again - Pearson quotes the FDA letter with some of more negative comments but leaves out ""We find your corrective
measures to prevent future recurrence to be acceptable, IF implemented as proposed". You be the judge - why leave
that out if you want a balanced article.


He says there was no unusual option activity? Funny - I trade ZIOP options every month - write covered calls, sell
naked puts and follow them closely and there was CLEARLY some unusual Oct 5 and Oct 4 put options bought in the
last week of expiration right before he published his article (during the slow lunch period in nyc on the very day
October options expired with a corresponding amazing amount of sell volume coming in concurrently)...If he thinks
someone buying Oct 4 options with a day left that are 80 cents out of the money is not unusual, well he needs to take
an options lesson. That is the type of option you would only buy if you knew something negative was coming. (As
were the Oct 1 Puts printed when the stock was in the high 4's the week before - meant to scare imo and the unusual
amount of April calls sold to open before this article came out). It is a certainty with all the complaints to the SEC on
last Fridays action, that the SEC will investigate those put buyers. That investigation is likely ongoing. I am sure they
will look to see also if any hedge fund covered a substantial amount of their huge short position (10-11 million shares
short with a stock that trades 300-400k is impossible to do efficiently without something negative coming out). Lets
see if the short interest declined when it is updated soon.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 23/49


Its probably all a coincidence - but I look forward to the SEC investigation results. I would ask Mr Pearson to answer 2
questions:


1) Did you inform any investor or hedge fund that this negative article was going to be published before it was?


2) Did you get any of this information from the disgruntled ex employees of ZIOP who previously reported this "lack of
disclosure" to the SEC (Company issued an 8k a long time ago disclosing that this issue was resolved by the SEC -
there was no material lack of disclosure that Mr Pearson suggests - SEC already reviewed it an clearly concluded
that)


I'm not surprised this guy is back publishing again. The day before his article came out the stock was trading at 4.67 -
his article and the concurrent selling that came in during lunch on wall street when volume is lower and selling can
crush a small cap dropped it to 3.36. But after Forbes pulled his short article and some analysts disclosed important
facts like that the mis-dosed patient Mr Pearson disclosed in his Picasso2 slam piece was not actually in Picasso 2
and the company confirmed they have no stability issues - well the stock rebounded to over $5. (Higher than the close
the day before his article came out). Since he disclosed that he was shorting more on the yahoo message board in
the 4's - this means his article not only did not have a long term effect once the company and a JMP analyst
addressed his allegations and clarified some things, and his knew shorts are underwater. So here he is again - with a
rehash of the same innuendo and doublespeak. You a can decide his motives for leaving the important sentence form
the FDA form out or why he didn't tell you the mis-dosed patient wasn't actually in the trial most of his article was
about - I already have and I am buying this dip he is again causing today just like I bought his last dip to the 3's one
week ago that didn't last. And I await the ongoing SEC investigation and implore all to ask the SEC to investigate the
action last Friday including the unusual put activity. You can ask them to investigate at this site:

Thanks for the article. I have been in and out of ZIOP (currently out). What initially drew my attention was the different
approach Pali was taking on an existing and effective drug (albeit one with serious side effects).


Unfortunately my DD was not extensive enough to find the stability issues. If true (and I am going to investigate
further on my own), this will be a commercial hurdle.

Since Mr Pearson brings up the IL-12 results - might as well make this board useful and give you my thoughts on it. I
had one biotech stock that went up 100 times from when I bought it over 12 yrs ago. Since then I have been
searching for a small cap that may just may - if everything goes right - could do something similar. I searched and
searched and in the $1.83 area started buying ZIOP yrs ago and continue including todays purchase in the $4.xxs
after the stock fell after the above article was published. Now I am VERY excited about this IL-12 systemic response
in melanoma (even in patients who failed ippy). PLEASE DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE


This ZIOP IL-12 trial was a dose response trial showing amazing Rheo Switch on/off correlation and 71% activity at
high does with better tolerability than expect.. Recommend everyone review this....


What is of paramount importance about this early IL-12 71% activity at higher doses is that THIS WAS ONLY A DOSE
RESPONSE TRIAL to see which dose is tolerable - sometimes seeing efficacy in these trials doesn't even matter -
and in these trials FDA process is by the book – very strict – and yet 5 out of the 7 patients (71%) had a clinical
response in a disease where some think 35% is excellent.


This is an amazing early result in my opinion. And as I said before – to me this is a proof of concept of that the Rheo
Switch works – Direct- intra-tumoral injection of IL-12 a drug that previously was seen as a drug that could cure
cancer but was too toxic before patients could get enough dose. But here the drug dose not work until you take an
oral Ligand (then it switches on) then when it gets to too toxic level – you take a drug holiday and stop taking the oral
Ligand. (switch toxicity off). Then when toxicity abates – take the Ligand again and switch it on.


This medicine is the most precise targeted intra-tumoral medicine I have ever heard about in 25 yrs of biotech
investing. I personally think its going to change medicine.


71% response with a great Rheo Switch on/off correlation. Company very happy with tolerability – better than even
they expected.


And Phase 2 is already underway with the first patient on drug. I expect some breast cancer next target news soon
with world-class Breast Cancer expert Larry Norton – former ASCO president – leading the way (Contract extended to
November –not December 31 but November – with big bonus if patient is dosed based on his protocol). It is no
coincidence breast cancer was highlighted as one of 2 next targets for Il-12 at the June investor day I attended in
NYC and that right after that statement Norton had a presentation on breast cancer. MAKE sure you go back and
listen to the June investor webcast (at least the IL-12 part and Dr Norton’s presentation) and review the slides at
these links:

Previous post and PR:


Read ZIOP PR with 71% melanoma activity in patients at high dose. Direct injection of IL-12 into tumors with ability to
switch off when toxic could change breast and other cancer treatments forever imo 
This is getting exciting. Early but it makes so much sense. Yrs ago IL-12 was going to be the cancer cure but it was
too toxic. The intrexon technology allows direct injection into melanoma, breast, head and neck cancer tumors - but
the drug only works if you then take an oral ligand.


Then when toxicity increases you can take a holiday from the ligand and then start it up again later.


I encourage everyone to listen to the R&D day and read the pdf slides on ZIopharm's website. I beleive strongly the
Pali ph 3 data will be good and could lead to a deal after data with $200 million up front and maybe another $800
million possible in milestones, etc. That would drive the stock to $9-$10 at least and give you Intrexon for free - ZIOP
OWNS ALL THE CANCER INDICATIONS. No one will ever get this broad a deal from intrexon. At the end of the day -
the Palifasfamide deal may be a rounding error. Do your own due diligence but do it quickly.


Next up breast cancer with ex ASCO president Larry Norton imo. Note the breast cancer hint dropped in the Drs
quotes in the PR:


ZIOPHARM Oncology Announces Compelling Clinical Activity in Phase 1 Study of Ad-RTS IL-12 in Advanced
Melanoma and Dosing of First Patient in Phase 2 Study 
NEW YORK, Oct. 25, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZIOP), a biopharmaceutical
company focused on the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies, today announced that
compelling clinical activity was seen in its Phase 1 study of Ad-RTS IL-12, a novel DNA-based therapeutic candidate,
in advanced melanoma. Based on early activity, and determination of a biologically effective dose, the Company also
announced that the study has advanced to Phase 2 in which the first patient has been dosed.


Initiation of the Phase 2 study follows the successful, dose-escalation Phase 1 study in which clinical activity was
observed in 5 of 7 (71%) patients dosed at the two highest dose levels. The data also showed a correlation between
T-cell immune responses and clinical outcome, with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. A total of 13 patients were
enrolled in the Phase 1 study, and were treated with a range of doses of an orally administered activator ligand. Three
serious adverse events (SAE) were reported: two related to therapy (pyrexia and cytopenia), and one unrelated (deep
vein thrombosis). Unrelated to the study therapy, one patient death was reported due to bacterial sepsis and
progression of disease. The Company expects to submit full results of the study for presentation at a major medical
meeting.


The Phase 2 multi-center, single-arm, open-label expansion study will enroll up to 15 patients with unresectable Stage
III or IV melanoma and further evaluate the safety and efficacy of intratumoral injections of Ad-RTS IL-12 in
combination with an oral activator ligand. Data from this study are expected in the first half of 2013.


"ZIOPHARM, working with our DNA therapy platform, is ushering in a paradigm shift in how we treat cancer, one that
transforms our ability to deliver therapy, leading to better, safer treatment and ultimately, to cures," said Samuel
Broder, M.D., Chairman of Intrexon Therapeutic Opportunities Committee and former Director of the NCI (National

Cancer Institute). "We look forward to seeing additional data as ZIOPHARM expands the Ad-RTS IL-12 DNA program
into multiple indications, including breast cancer, and to the introduction of the next generation of DNA-based
therapeutic candidates for oncology."


"This Phase 1 study demonstrates that IL-12 dosing, delivered and controlled through a pioneering DNA therapeutic
strategy, is both tolerable and clinically active," stated Hagop Youssoufian, M.D., President of Research and
Development and Chief Medical Officer of ZIOPHARM. "An important early sign of this effect was manifested in
lesions not injected with Ad-RTS IL-12, where clinical response was observed, indicating systemic, anti-cancer
immune activity. We also saw activity in patients who had been previously exposed to ipilimumab, as well as other
forms of immunotherapy, suggesting that Ad-RTS IL-12 may provide benefit for patients with advanced disease."


In connection with the achievement of this milestone, ZIOPHARM announced today that it will issue 3,636,926 shares
of the Company's common stock to Intrexon Corporation in accordance with the terms of the Exclusive Channel
Partner Agreement (ECP) between the companies entered into in January 2011. All of the shares issued to Intrexon
will be unregistered but certain registration rights in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement entered into
by the companies at the time of the ECP.


About ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.:


ZIOPHARM Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new
cancer therapies. The Company's clinical programs include:


Palifosfamide (ZIO-201) is a potent bi-functional DNA alkylating agent that has activity in multiple tumors by evading
typical resistance pathways. Palifosfamide is in the same class as bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide.
Intravenous palifosfamide is currently being studied in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial
(PICASSO 3) for the treatment of first-line metastatic soft tissue sarcoma and is also in a pivotal Phase 3 trial
(MATISSE) for first-line metastatic small cell lung cancer. Additionally, the Company is developing an oral capsule
form of palifosfamide.


Ad-RTS IL-12 is currently being tested in a Phase 2 study. Ad-RTS IL-12 is a novel DNA therapeutic that is delivered
to the patient's tumor thereby localizing expression of the therapeutic modality, interleukin-12 (IL-12), a protein
important for an immune response to cancer. ZIOPHARM's DNA therapeutics are being developed in partnership with
Intrexon Corporation employing a revolutionary synthetic biology platform that permits targeted, controlled production
of therapeutic proteins in humans. This is achieved by placing IL-12 under the control of a proprietary biological
"switch" (the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System®, RTS®) to turn on/off the therapeutic protein expression at the tumor
site.


Indibulin (ZIO-301) is a novel, tubulin binding agent that is expected to have several potential benefits, including oral
dosing, application in multi-drug resistant tumors, no neuropathy and a tolerable toxicity profile. It is currently being
studied in a Phase 1/2 trial in metastatic breast cancer.


Darinaparsin (ZIO-101) is a novel mitochondrial- and hedgehog-targeted agent (organic arsenic) currently in ongoing
studies with Solasia Pharma K.K.


ZIOPHARM's operations are located in Boston, MA, and New York City. Further information about ZIOPHARM may

Another ridiculous comment. Anyone who follows ziop has been excitingly awaiting the melanoma IL-12 data since
this summer's R&D investors day on Tues June 19th at the NASDAQ marketsite. On page 47 of the handout at that
meeting (available at ziopharm.com under investor relations section) Under "Ad-IL12 metastic melanoma they printed
IN BOLD "Significant Data expected in 2H 2012". Another baseless accusation by short seller Pearson - this data has
been planned for months. (See my detailed comments on this compelling IL-12 data later near the bottom of the
comments below). 
Pearson says - The "compelling" press release describing Phase I data for a different drug seems to give investors a
new reason to buy the stock, diminishing the current focus on the FDA uncertainty and stability issues with
Palifosfamide. This strategy appears to have worked,

Your comparison to PPHM is hilarious. How is the share price or market cap relevant to any of this? There are
thousands of stocks in the world with a market cap of $500M or a share price of $5/share. The rest of your criteria
describe pretty much every microcap biotech out there. I would say Ziopharm is better than most in that they are not
entirely dependent on pali - they have a completely distinct platform that just moved into phase 2. Look at companies
like ARNA or AFFY is you want to see a company depending on 1 drug.

I sent the following email to the company this past Tuesday and have heard nothing back. I just resent my email. I
have been very excited about Palifosfamide for personal reasons but, without a meaningful answer from the company
on this issue, am starting to worry about their integrity. Anyone who has been in a hospital getting, or with someone
getting, chemo for any period of time knows that a 1 hour shelf life after constitution of the IV big is a problem, unless
Ziopharm has a method/protocol for dealing with this to make it NOT a problem. Ziopharm could put this question to
rest NOW by telling us why it is not a problem- what method or protocol did it put in place to make sure that chemo
was started within 1/2 hour of constitution of the IV bag. If it turns out this is a problem impacting commercial viability,

Ziopharm will have serious issues on many fronts. Personally, I will feel lied to and wronged in the extreme. I am
posting this here because the company hasn't gotten back to me.


Dr. Lewis,


Mr. Pearson's article in Forbes was disgusting in the way he manipulated readers into feeling there was some sort of
conspiracy at Ziopharm. However, I have not seen an adequate answer to the stability question. To me, this was the
only valid point in the article- I did not know that there was only 1 hour allowed from IV bag constitution to infusion. I
have listened to you speak many, many times, have read your SEC documents and I do not believe this limitation was
made clear. Of course, I’m not yet clear if this has any commercial impact at all and that is why I am writing you.
Ziopharm’s response on this point did not answer the question, which is: does the one hour stability limit impact the
commercial reach of palifosfamide? I have unfortunately spent many hours in the hospital with a loved one receiving
chemo for sarcoma. If the IV bag can be mixed by the nurse at bedside, this would actually answer the question.
Typically the nurses can coordinate and overcome timing issues on the oncology floor. If the IV bag has to be mixed in
the hospital pharmacy and run up to the room, then many hospitals would not be comfortable committing to handle
this, and they would not want to risk losing a very expensive round of chemo. Often, the nurses have little control over
operations of the pharmacy and delivery from pharmacy to the oncology floor. If the latter, such practical limitations
may not impact FDA approval, but may impact commercial reach. Absolutely, some clinics/hospitals can handle this.
Others might not be able to. I appreciate an explanation as to why this is NOT an issue; such an explanation would go
a long way to get investors comfortable that this drug, if approved, can actually be used in the lion's share of hospitals
that treat cancer patients. Just saying “… the Company has no issues with drug stability” is incomplete; can you say
that the drug’s stability does not have practical implications that would impact the likelihood of hospitals and clinics’
being willing to use the drug?


Thank you.

I never received anything back, and still haven't.


If you do get a response, many readers would certainly like to see it, so I hope you will consider posting their

Listen - this is a public company under SEC rules accused by Mr Pearson of not disclosing a material event that was
REVIEWED IN DETAIL BY THE SEC AND FOUND NOT TO BE MATERIAL. 
Because of the damage his Forbes article (that forbes later deleted) did to the stock price 2 friday's ago - ZIOP
management did the almost unprecedented public company response - actually issuing a PR countering what the
blogger said and stating clearly THERE IS NO STABILITY ISSUES. I used to be on the board of directors and was a
NYSE COO and CFO. There is no way a company should reply to individual stability questions after they already
publicly have stated their is no stability issues.


There are many misleading comments in Mr Pearson's articles so I would take his stability comments with a grain of
salt. For instance Pearson says "In order to get through Phase 3, ZIOP will eventually need to raise money through a
stock offering" Absolutely ridiculous comment. Given the company's cash balance and the fact that the phase 3 trial is
nearing conclusion - this is an illogical and misleading statement. Its not the only one - the lack of insider buying, the
innuendo that the IL-12 data was released because of pali problems, the idea that the company is now more likely to
do a secondary near term - its all rather silly if you ask me. I bought 6000 shares on the dip this article caused on
Friday just like I bought on the dip to the 3's Mr Pearson's article caused 2 Fridays ago before Forbes purposely
deleted his column.

I very much hope Palifosfamide succeeds. There was another sarcoma drug not long ago that I was rooting
for- the company that owns that drug also responded publicly to a blog saying that the drug would fail phase
III. Seeking Alpha had hundreds of posts on both sides of that argument. That company was Keryx and it did
fail. I hope this is different. However, I am very alarmed that I did not know (after following Palifosfamide
development for two years) that the drug had to be given within 1/2 hour of constituting the IV bag for a 1/2
hour infusion (total 1 hour shelf life). Unless (a) the company has some special method of getting around this
severe timing issue or (b) Pearson provided protocols that are not the actual protocols for this Phase III trial,
then it IS AN ISSUE. If it turns out that hospitals and clinics did have issues delivering this drug within the 1/2
hour of IV bag constitution to start the 1/2 hour infusion or if it turns out that most other hospitals/clinics
cannot handle the logistics, then Ziopharm's lack of disclosure will be a big issue for them. If it turns out there
is no 1 hour time constraint, then Pearson is full of it. The company said there is no stability issue-- did they
mean, there's no stability issue as long as the chemo starts pumping into the patient within 1/2 hour? If so,
that is not a meaningful statement and they know it. Many hospitals pharmacies that mix chemo aren't even
located in the SAME BUILDING FOR GOODNESS SAKE. If the 1/2 hour limitation is false, they could easily
have given specifics. But since you're so positive, just keep buying shares- you should be thrilled. You should
be thanking Pearson.

obviously false and so easily be proven false, you have made it clear that no one should believe anything you
say. Once again, for your reference, the 8K which you blatantly misquote is here: http://bit.ly/Rgq6rG. It
contains no mention of the FACTS that you claim. And again, the SEC can be reached at  
http://1.usa.gov/viWoSv# 
1-800-SEC-0330 (general number as a starting point...you really want to speak with enforcement)


Readers will ultimately want to speak with the division of enforcement regarding ZIOP. They will not confirm
the conclusion of any inquiry or investigation until it has been formally closed. So far I have been unable to
confirm conclusion of the inquiry into ZIOP. So people can draw their own conclusions.


While you are there (enforcement), you may feel free to submit a complaint regarding my writing and
activities. But before doing so, you should read the definition of "Manipulation" as defined by the SEC on that
page. The only way I get in any trouble whatsoever is if I knowingly provided untrue information. Given the
number of links I have painstakingly included to publicly available information for each and every point I have
made, it will be very difficult for anyone with any experience to point to anything I said as being inaccurate.


This is in stark contrast to the blatantly and provably false statements you have made in these lengthy and
numerous comments, which I have refuted along with links so that other readers can verify.


But again, please feel more than free to submit your complaints to the SEC. I am very, very comfortable with
my legal position in this matter due the factual nature and demonstrable proof of everything I have said. And
in fact, if the SEC starts taking a closer look at me, the only way they can evaluate me is to evaluate the
serious observations I have made. Given the very clear fact patterns I have highlighted, I feel strongly that if
the SEC decides to focus on the issues at ZIOP (including the press release on Oct 19, and extending back
to 2009), that they will develop a keen interest in ZIOP. Given that I have already written out a 4 year road
map, an investigation would now be very easy for them. Unless of course they have already started one....


Also, now you have graduated from "former CFO" to COO, CFO and board member. What should we expect
of you next, "former biotech billionaire" ?


I find it very interesting that a very small number of anonymous posters with such impressive backgrounds
such as yours and that of Wall Street Teacher make such a persistent and impassioned defense of ZIOP by
posting information which is verifiably false even upon a quick glance at the filings you reference. Just like
WST, you have now attracted my attention. Hopefully you do not have an undisclosed relationship with any of
the companies you write about, because if so, you can be sure I will uncover it, now that you got my attention.

You can conclude that your material lack of disclosure claim is different than the disgruntled ex employees
claim that SEC concluded had no merit go ahead. Again I ask have you talked to them - if so did you learn
that their claim was different than yours - I think not.


I am an individual investor looking for my next 100 timer in biotech and after yrs of research started buying
ZIOP at $1.83 yrs ago thinking its a candidate. The IL-12 results recently - give me great hope. I have no
undisclosed relationships with any company I write about.

Author’s reply »  Thanks for your comment.


And for the records, I too hope that we will see more treatments for STS as well as other cancers.


Some people have taken issue with the fact that I have directed my comments towards a company which is
focused on helping people with a hard to treat, terminal illness. They feel that this is unconscionable.


To these people, I have suggested this: 
If this drug works so well, why has ZIOP not released the detailed results of Ph 2 ? Why did ZIOP halt the Ph
2 trials early, BEFORE ever auditing the Chawla data and before the FDA issues were even resolved ? If
these issues didn't matter, then why didn't ZIOP disclose ? Only ZIOP knows the answer to these questions,
and ZIOP isn't telling us.


ZIOP's share price is where it is because the company has led us to believe that it has a drug with great
potential for treating STS.


If it turns out that this drug is marginal (or useless) then ZIOP wil have distracted investors and the medical
profession from other drugs which could have greater effectiveness. IF this is the case, then ZIOP would have
knowingly strung people along for years, while they are trying to figure out a new direction for the company (ie
Intrexon 5-10 year plan).


That would clearly be unconscionable, and my pointing it out would no doubt be a virtuous deed, for
investors, for the medical profession and for cancer patients.


This has not happened yet. No one will know until we actually see Ph 3 data, which I believe we will see in
March / April (or later).


I encourage all readers to feel free to refer back to this and any other of my messages, and feel free to thank
me or chastise me accordingly.

Listen, it absolutely useless trying to respond to Mr. Pearson and using the Mr. in front of his name is not even
justifiable. Here is a person who took the time to scour the depths of hell to drag up whatever negative information he
could find, then take up a large short position, then publish his article in Forbes, and take advantage of his ploy to
MAKE $$$ at everyone else's expense.


He first stated on his blog that Forbes removed his article because the article didn't fit within their type of format. Now
he states this on his blog site: [Authors note: This article appeared online on Friday, October 19th, 2012 in a different
location. A few hours later the story was taken down from that website without any notice or explanation to the author.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 32/49


The website in question raised precisely zero questions or issues regarding the accuracy of the piece.]  
Oh so now you say you were not given a reason why your article was taken down, but earlier you stated it was
because it didn't fit within Forbes type of format. In other words you lied when you posted that this is why Forbes took
down your article. Seems as though you were protecting Forbes at first and now you say the heck with it. Why would
that be? Did Forbes tell you that you were done writing articles for them? I would think so!


Then in an exchange of emails with Mr. Pearson, he even resorted to calling my responses retarded when I
challenged him on a few issues, such as:


I would like to reiterate my point of, it was not so much what you said that was inaccurate, but rather how you misled
everyone by omitting important details that should have been included in the article. For instance, regarding the
warning letter, which was issued to Dr. Chawa, not Ziopharm. You left out a VERY IMPORTANT quote from the FDA:
“We find your corrective measures to prevent future recurrence to be acceptable, if implemented as proposed.” Plus
Ziopharm has responded to your article stating “The Form 483 was issued directly to the independent investigator, not
to ZIOPHARM, and had nothing to do with any outcome measures of the Phase II PICASSO study.” Plus you failed to
mention that the patient mentioned in the FDA’s warning letter was not even in the PICASSO II trial.


Then this:


I also found it very odd that you would leave out that this investigation was brought about due to Brian L. Hamilton,
M.D., Ph.D., and Donna S. Cohen(Dr. Hamilton’s spouse) initiating this action with the FDA after being fired by
Ziopharm(ZIOP). Plus the fact that you were indeed in contact with the both of them when writing this article. If you
had nothing to hide as you claim, why would you not disclose this?


Then I questioned him on why he has not responded to the article by Adam Feuerstein in "The Street" that discounts
everything he published and he stated that Adam didn't really say anything worth responding to. In other words he
wasn't about to go head to head with Adam, because if what Adam stated was incorrect then he would have been all
over him, like he is doing here. You see Adam knows his science and Pearson knows that and that scares him.
otherwise why wouldn't he respond.


Then there is the statement on his blog that states this: “MoxReports focuses both on stocks which are undervalued
as well as overvalued, and thus does not have a bias towards long or short investors.” 
Are you kidding me, no bias? He shorted the stock and yet he has the audacity to claims this.


I could go on all day about this author, but I have decided to just ignore him for now on.


The author, Mr. Pearson is out to profit from his short position and he will go to all lengths to try and keep his story in
the headlines. He will disclose only what he wants and not ALL the facts. As a matter of fact Mr. Pearson took this as
a compliment when I stated his article was very misleading and instead of inaccurate. This should tell you what kind of
person you are dealing with. He will simply give you small sound bites of what is accurate and which is advantageous
to his short position while leaving out many other important facts as I have shown above. This way he can state that
he posted factual data, even though he twisted it in a way to benefit himself.

I find both of Mr Pearson's articles lack any real significant information and they both mislead both me and my
fellow investor friends. The Phase 3 result as people have pointed out has already been reviewed twice by
the DMC. Who cares about a Ph 2 from 2009? Not me.  
His stability arguement is weak at best.  
His assertion that the company timed the IL-12 info because of his palifosfamide blogs is just not accurate -
anyone who follows this company was hoping for this data in Sept or October - exactly when it came. 
His idea that the company must raise financing to get through a Ph 3 that is almost done with $100 mill in the
bank is purposely deceitful in my and others opinions and show a lack of sophistication re costs of trials. 
Leaving out the key FDA comment after printing the negatives was the glaring spotlight of his intentions for
me. 
Seen a lot of short selling attacks in the last 17 yrs - this one was not even a good one.

Author’s reply »  Dear Steve,


I continue to thoroughly enjoy our lively online debate.


I also appreciate the fact the you were "wrong" in calling me inaccurate, and have now switched to just
misleading (but accurate).


Thank you again for spending so much time to help flush out what is accurate and what is not. I know that this
matters to you.


Some people focus in on selective items that in isolation might help to support a historical view that they cling
to in spite of new information.


But you take a big picture view and evaluate new information strictly based on its relevance and content,
without disregarding it due to a simple dislike of the messenge


I congratulate you, sir, for your ability to keep calm, cool and objective in a dynamic and intellectually
challenging situation.


Over the long term, this ability of yours will continue to serve you well, and I firmly believe that you will
prosper accordingly.


Regards,


Rick

Stability question information - I found this info below very informative to be good information on how ZIOP fixed the
stability issue long ago ---


ZIOPHARM developed a new formulation of palifosfamide (palifosfamide-tris) to overcome several limitations
associated with the original palifosfamide-lysine formulation. The limitations associated with palifosfamide-lysine



https://seekingalpha.com/author/richard-pearson

https://seekingalpha.com/article/954821-richard-pearson-responds-on-ziopharm 34/49


include the need for -70°C conditions when storing long-term, short post-reconstitution stability, and a 2:1 ratio of salt
to active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Palifosfamide-tris has the capability of being stored at -20°C for at least 6
months, has twice the reconstitution stability compared to palifosfamide-lysine, and has a 1:1 salt-to-API ratio.
ZIOPHARM continued to work closely with nephrology experts who believed that lysine, in of itself a nephrotoxin,
especially when combined with palifosfamide, exacerbated the renal toxicity. Thus the absence of lysine would be
predicted to abrogate nephrotoxicity. In addition, as ZIOPHARM gained more experience with palifosfamide in its
lysine form, dosing schedule and dose adjustments were made and the observed renal toxicities changed accordingly
(i.e significantly reduced, even when administering effective high-dose palifosfamide). Thus, with the change to the
tris-salt form we have equivalency, and have observed a significant decrease in the number of reported renal toxicity
and have experienced no Fanconi Syndrome. Indeed, in the current randomized trial it is unclear as to whether there
is any difference in toxicity between the combination arm (pali + dox) and the control arm (dox alone).

Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  ummmm....yes, Pali tris is the well-known "stabilized form" of Palifosfamide. Their first attempt at
stabilizing Pali lysine was totally unworkable, so they DOUBLED the stability time with Pali tris, which is still so
unstable that it only has 30 min in bag, and is far far less stable than comparable drugs for comparable indications.
The fact that they have gone through to formulations to get here shows that they KNEW this was an "issue" - the
current Tris formulation is by no means "fixed".


Some people (ie. longs) are starting to find this out by contacting the company directly or by speaking to chemo
professionals (ie. oncologists, pharmacists, chemo nurses)


I suggest you do the same, rather than simply taking a guess about what the use of Tris means.


Really ! Call ZIOP and ask them. Did they every even study the commercial impact of 30 minute limit in the bag ?
Why do they expressly note that 14.6% NaCl should be used "if available"...and then specifically point out that one
should use 0.9% NaCl when 14.6% is not available ? It is because the recognize the stability "issue" (aka "problem")
and attempt to use a non standard diluent to help boost stability. But since 14.6% is typically "not available", they let
us know that hospitals will be using 0.9% in practice - ie. it is an "isssue" (aka "problem")


dont trust me on this. ask ZIOP directly and then ask a few chemo nurses in practice.

There clearly is no stability issue - another misleading comment meant to distort the truth. Many drugs need to be
used in 30 minutes after mixing - including the antibiotic currently being used to treat the steroid related meningitis
outbreak. There are other cancer drugs with similar. In fact Pali has better stability than others. It can be stored for 6
months at approved temperature and as this post on investor village cites - pali is quite stable for 2.5 after
reconstitution. Another think to add to the SEC complaint about the thousands of puts bought before the Forbes
article that was eventually deleted and the millions of shares of short covering that just happened to occur after he
released the article during the low volume NYC lunch period on option expiration friday


Pali-Tris is quite stable (2.5 hrs after reconstitution!)


http://bit.ly/Rt8gFj


In an effort to find a stabilizing formulation of IPM a series of different IPM-salts were evaluated. A lysine salt of IPM
(ZIO-201; IPM-lys) a zwitterionic species, offers several advantages relative to the IPM free acid, such as enhanced
solubility and stability over a wide pH range, improved non-deliquescence characteristics and a more favorable
dissolution rate. This formulation allowed the development of IPM for intravenous administration. ZIO-201 is currently
in Phase 2 clinical trials for sarcoma. 
Since an oral formulation of ZIO-201 will significantly increase convenience and flexibility in cancer treatment, its
activity by oral administration was tested in mouse cancer models. Oral administration of ZIO-201 to mice bearing
P388 leukemia increased life span by 150% compared to vehicle controls, demonstrating not only oral bioavailability
of ZIO-201 but also activity against leukemia. Similarly, a comparison of oral and systemic administration of ZIO-201
in MX-1 breast cancer xenografts showed a decrease in tumor growth similar for both routes of administration: 80%
for intraperitoneal and 65% for oral. The maximum tolerated dose for oral administration was four times that of
intraperitoneal, which also coincided with the maximal efficacious dose. These results indicate that the stabilized form
of IPM is orally active and support the clinical development for oral ZIO-201.


Introduction 
ZIO-201 has potent anti-tumor activity in a large number of preclinical tumor models when administered systemically.
It is active in ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide resistant cell lines and in human osteosarcoma xenografts. Preclinical
data indicate that ZIO-201 has better pharmacodynamics than IFOS and CPA making it a potentially more effective
and safer alternative to both. A series of different IPM salts were evaluated for their increased stability and solubility.
Two formulations, IPM-lys and IPM-Tris were found to have the most favorable stability profiles. Oral availability of
ZIO-201 was established in preclinical models having potential utility in metronomic treatment of cancer.

Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thank you for pointing this out.


As we know, JMP has a direct dialogue with ZIOP, so before putting out this comment, they could have easily gotten
clarity from management on the following key information....yet those chose to leave it vague.


1) WHEN was the independent audit conducted ? Was it before or AFTER the early stopping of the Ph 2 trial ?


as I have previously demonstrated, Chawla made no reference to it in response to FDA on Sep 14, but the trial was
halted within just 2 weeks as a success. FDA audit lasted 3 weeks, and was simpler in scope because it only sought
to identify problem areas, not to "prove" that there was no impact on data. any sensible analyst should have asked
WHEN the "independent audit" was done, rather than simply repeat a blanket statement by mgmt.


2) JMP's statement about the overdose has been widely misinterpreted to mean that the letter "had nothing to do
with" Ph 2. Which is obviously incorrect, because it did.


3) anyone who goes to clinicaltrials.gov can quickly see that Chawla has been involved in over 300 clinical trials. his
participation in other trials does nothing to fix the violations in this particular trial. in fact, investors in ZIOP could care
less about his violation-free performance in other trials, because all they care about is the "reliability and integrity" of
the data in the trial for ZIOP's Pali. Is JMP really telling us that we should ignore the violations in the one study we
care about, just because Chawla didn't have violations in other studies ??


None of this is to even remotely suggest that Chawla is a bad doctor or an incompetent clinical investigator. The only
implications are that a) there were problems in a study that we care about,  
b) the problems were not disclosed by ZIOP,  
c) the study was concluded PRIOR TO the independent audit and  
d) PRIOR to the resolution of Dr. Chawla's regulatory probs (2010), e) PRIOR TO the early halting of Phase 2 as a

f) ZIOP continued to use Chawla despite past violations (if his regulatory issues were resolved, and the data
independently verified etc, this decision could be defensible.... but given that the Ph 3 study has over 150
investigators involved, why would it be so necessary to include Dr Chawla, when a safer more conservative decision

JMP on Pearson short article that Forbes later deleted after detailed review of Pearson comments


• Concerns over Forbes article are largely unwarranted; reiterate Market Outperform rating and $10 sum-of-the-parts
based price target of ZIOPHARM Oncology. On Friday, an article published on the Forbes website raised concerns
relating to Ziopharm's lead development candidate palifosfamide, specifically bringing into question the validity of the
Phase II results and the commercial viability of the drug's stability. Based on our review of the concerns raised in this
article, along with the press release issued by Ziopharm on Friday afternoon and the additional color we learned from
our discussion with management, we remain confident in the strength of the Phase II results and likelihood of positive
Phase III results. We continue to anticipate top-line PFS results from the Phase III (PICASSO3) trial by year-end
2012. 
• Key point of debate relates to questions of investigator conduct. The most important issue raised by the Forbes
article is the claim that violations by Dr. Chawla (Sarcoma Oncology Center, Santa Monica, CA) may bring the validity
of the palifosfamide Phase II (PICASSO2) results into question. The article cites a warning letter sent from the FDA to
Dr. Chawla noting multiple protocol violations. As detailed on page 2, we believe that the nature of the questions
raised by the FDA are unlikely to have impacted the clinical outcome measures of the PICASSO2 trial, specifically the
PFS endpoint. Moreover, we gain comfort that an external review of the data (by a former FDA auditor) concluded that
the protocol violations had no impact on the trial’s results. 
• Drug stability does not concern us. The second point of the debate raised by the Forbes article was related to the
stability of palifosfamide and the commercial implications. Developing a stable 
formulation of palifosfamide has been a key focus during the development program and Ziopharm reiterated that it
has no issues with drug stability. We do not view this issue as a hurdle to clinical or regulatory success and
management stated to us that, while continuing to seek improvements is a focus, the palifosfamide-tris formulation
being used in Phase III is commercially viable. 
• No question of management credibility in our opinion. While we acknowledge that the article may have caused
investors to assess conviction in the potential for positive PICASSO3 results, we remain confident in management
and its execution in conducting the Phase III trial. We have comfort in Ziopharm's disclosure relating to the FDA's
actions against Dr. Chawla as we believe the protocol violations extended to the investigator’s involvement with
multiple drugs, and was not specific to palifosfamide. In contrast, we have less information to support the credibility of
the author, and note that the article now appears to have been removed from the Forbes website.

JMP Securities"the stability of palifosfamide has been a key development achievement for Ziopharm . We are
confident that the current formulation has no stability issues that would impact commercial adoption"


JMP SECURITIES 
"The Forbes article calls into question the practical and thus commercial viability of palifosfamide given the drug's
instability in solution once it is reconstituted. The article specifically notes the PICASSO2 protocol which instructs that
the drug is to be administered by IV infusion over the course of approximately 30 minutes, and that administration
must be completed within one hour of reconstitution. The protocol adds that stability can be increased up to a total of
2.5 hours in solution by adding 14.6% sodium chloride. The Forbes article claims that palifosfamide is instable in
solution compared to other cancer drugs, quoting a study that finds that 24-hour stability times create logistical
difficulties in hospital settings, and other studies that purportedly discuss the challenge that a two-hour wait time for
chemotherapy presents.


As we stated on page 1, the stability of palifosfamide has been a key development achievement for Ziopharm. There
have been more than 300 clinical sites worldwide involved in palifosfamide trials, 
ranging from large academic institutions to independent oncology centers. We are confident that the current
formulation has no stability issues that would impact commercial adoption should the Phase III data be supportive of
regulatory approval.

truths like the company will have to get financing to finish this almost done Ph 3 trial and that there is no real

After reviewing the information that Mr. Pearson provided, and after getting no response from Ziopharm regarding one
issue he raised regarding drug stability (one hour window for starting infusion after constitution of the IV bag), I still
believe that Palifosfamide is likely to be approved, and I do believe that it is likely to have a net positive, albeit

incremental, benefit to sarcoma patients. Thanks to Mr. Pearson, however, my enthusiasm for Ziopharm has been
tempered. I view this as very helpful. In fact, I want to thank Mr. Pearson for digging up issues about which I was
heretofore unaware. Of course, Mr. Pearson has his own motivations; I simply looked further into issues he raised that
I thought had merit and ignored the ones that I thought were overblown or had no merit. I am not a medical
professional so my rationale may be significantly flawed. 
My view is that Palifosfamide is likely to be at least as effective as ifosfamide for sarcoma. Unless Ziopharm is
completely corrupt, Palifosfamide avoids the most serious toxicities of ifosfamide. The significant toxicities of
ifosfamide cause pain, anguish, misery and cost, both while the drug is being administered and down the road if
patients are lucky enough to survive the initial disease. This benefit will be understood and given VERY strong weight
by the FDA, in my opinion. The one hour window between IV bag constitution and infusion will cause hospitals some
operational issues; some hospitals may not be willing to commit to this. But, net-net the drug is likely to be viewed as
a benefit in treating a disease for which there has been little good treatment news in years. It is rare that someone
posts useful information on Seeking Alpha- Mr. Pearson did a lot of digging and provided links to documents (such as
the Palifosfamide protocol) that I did not find on my own. Ultimately, I still differ with his conclusion, but he may still be
proven right. 
In sum, I'm looking at the following + / - for Palifosfamide:


Positives: 
+ should be at least as effective as ifosfamide 
+ should avoid the worst toxicities of ifosfamide-- should cost less to treat severe toxicities (long term costs for
survivors and current treatment costs (e.g. brain scans in cases of encephalopathy) 
+ should eliminate much of the patient misery caused by cases of encephalopathy.


Negatives: 
- drug will cost a lot more than ifosfamide 
- drug doesn't appear to be significantly more effective than ifosfamide in combination with doxo (phase II data) 
- stability of drug causes some operational issues for hospitals to grapple with; drug has to be hooked up to patient
within one hour of IV bag constitution. Some hospitals may not commit to this.


I think this drug looks like the type that should be approved for this disease. I don't think it's going to be a game
changer for people with sarcoma, but will be of incremental benefit. At worst, it should make a patient's final months
less miserable. This will count for a lot.

TY Hope4Future for your fair balanced response, which is something the author has not provided due to his biased
short position.


There are pros and cons to every drug and every company in this business and when an author focuses entirely on
the cons due their bias of shorting the stock, readers tend to give their articles very little credibility. And when an
author intentionally leaves out certain details like his meeting with the 2 former employees who were fired by
Ziopharm when conducting his research, it makes it out to be a hatchet job only.

Oh and let's not forget about the fact that he left out the important detail that the patient who was incorrectly dosed
was not even in the trial. Then again why would he if he wanted to make a financial gain with his short position.


Just the fact that Forbes removed his article the same day he published it should be all that needs to be said in
regards this author's credibility.


In his own blog he first stated that Forbes removed his article because it did not fall within their venue. Then later he
changed and said that Forbes was wrong to remove his article and bashed them for it. It makes one wonder if he has
now been forever blocked to publish another article for Forbes.


It is unfortunate that SA does not have the same standards as Forbes when it comes to what is allowed to be
published on their site. SA failed to realize that this author purposely left out important facts and details in his article
for obvious reasons. Yet the author will claim that he can substantiate all that he has posted, but will not admit that he
intentionally left out important information to tell the complete story, because of his short position influence.


The market also rejected his article as the pps quickly rebounded once all the facts were revealed and that the author
had shorted the stock prior to his article and let his buddies know when he was going to publish article, so they could
profit from it too.


I would not be surprised if he comes under scrutiny by the SEC after investors lodge their complaints with them. I
think Mr. Pearson has no credibility left in the market place and any further articles by him will be of little consequence
due to the fact that nobody will take them seriously ever again.


What is sad about this whole thing is that many retail investors were hit hard and lost a lot of money at the hands of
this short selling manipulative author. If anything good is to come of this, it should be that one should never panic sell
without seeking the facts first.


As to you Mr. Pearson, as I am sure you heard many times already; How do you sleep at night knowing that you cost
so many so much just so you could profit?


Your greed has now landed you in hot water with Forbes, whereas you will no longer be allowed to publish anything
on their site ever or that they will not trust you to publish another article until it has been fully proofread and double
checked for professional journalism. Plus you will be most likely investigated the role you played in the sudden jump
in the short interest and put options just prior to your article being published. If those investors who took part are
found to be of any acquaintances of yours, you could be facing some hefty fines and possible jail time. That's what
greed gets you!

how this delay could have happened. If it was because of pace of enrollment, Lewis would have known months ago
that this delay was likely. There is absolutely NOTHING in the Phase II data to suggest that PFS in one arm of the trial
could delay the required number of PFS events by an additional FOUR MONTHS !!!!??? Pearson said there would be
a capital raising prior to announcement of top line results. The company was asked this question point blank last night
and refused to say "no, we will not raise dilutive capital before March". When Celsion's CEO was asked this question
a month ago, he responded definitively that he would not raise dilutive capital prior to announcement of top line
results; that is called confidence in your drug. Why didn't Lewis do this? They have the cash to get through March. If
they believe in their drug, how could they even consider raising dilutive capital prior to what will surely be a massive
increase in stock price if the Phase III top line results are positive? This is really upsetting to me. Someone talk me off
out of my anger please.

Hope, you should change your name to NoHope! Just sell and go away if you have so much doubt. The conference
call was my first of ZIOP to listen to, and he sounded very confident. IMO, there is a more likelihood of a large benefit
from PALI than anything bad, because of what we know that with Pali there is less toxicity and more likely less
dropouts from the study. If also as told the patient population is worse, to include ages over 60, in this trial, then any
extension, would not likely to only occur in the SOC side only, since we know that Pali does work. The reason the
answer we got on financing was answered as such is that they know that eventually they will have to plan ahead for
more money, and sure, you would likely go ahead and obtain that if there is good data and the price rising in a huge
way. If there was some bad stroke of luck and the price falls, I guess they would have to ask Kirk for a cash infusion
or a secondary, but I doubt any bad news occurs. I was very disgusted when this author wrote this article and the
Forbes article. I have never been to subject to such bizarre negligent activity toward my investment ever, and even if
apparently interesting discussion is raised, it was surely done to create doubt late in the game, and force the price
down, out of greed and profit for a short seller, or many sellers. I find that very unethical and wrong, and even if not
illegal, I question the motive.

Hope4Future
Please don't get personal. I have listened to Lewis on conference calls now maybe 20 times. He has never been
anything less than extremely confident about any of his drugs on any of his conference calls. Of course he can raise
money AFTER the top line results are announced. He will get a much better price per share is Pali results are good. I
believe the analyst was asking if he'd raise capital prior to the Pali data coming in. If he raises money BEFORE top
line results are announced it means he isn't confident about Pali and just wants to ensure he can keep his company
going for another period of time in the hopes that one of his other drugs will gain momentum, and that he is willing to
put his own longevity in this company above value to shareholders. He has enough money to get through the end of
March. If he raises dilutive capital prior to that you will have a lot of insight into what this extremely confident CEO
cares about. I wish he had just said "no dilutive capital will be raised prior to March announcement of Pali data". He
didn't. Rather than be a cheerleader for a confident CEO, I was hoping that my post would spur shareholders to send
letters and emails to the company to ask them to show some confidence in Pali and don't issue dilutive capital prior to
disclosing Pali results. My interest here is in treatments for Sarcoma- Threshold Pharmaceuticals just announced 21.5

The trial is blinded - when you add three months to a trial that only needs 3 month PFS for approval and you have a
great handle on the control group dox and know what that does over the yrs and doesnt do and dox is in both arms - it
is very likely this means palifosfamide is working better than originally expected. Key again - good handle on control
arm and only 3 months PFS needed for approval. This extention is a good thing as BP says:


http://yhoo.it/TNURXb


Also JMP Securities says:


JMPSecurities -Confidence remains in ZIOP success - Reiterated $10 target & Outperform


JMP SECURITIES 
INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS


• Phase III results slip by three months - our confidence in a successful outcome remains unchanged; reiterate Market
Outperform rating and $10 price target for ZIOPHARM Oncology. 
Ziopharm announced yesterday that based on a review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) it now
expects interim PFS data for the palifosfamide Phase III trial in sarcoma by the end of 1Q13, roughly one quarter
behind our previous expectation for data by YE12. The timing of the PFS analysis is event-driven and we do not
believe this delay has any impact on the likelihood of a successful outcome. We continue to anticipate positive results
from the trial based on results from the PICASSO Phase II trial, historical evidence for the efficacy of ifosfamide in
sarcoma and Ziopharm's rigorous trial design and conduct. Our $10 target remains derived from a sum-of-the-parts
analysis of palifosfamide U.S. revenue and ex-U.S. royalties in STS, as well as assigning pre-POC value for Intrexon-
driven assets.


• IDMC review affirms that trial is non-futile. The IDMC communicated to the company that the rate of PFS events was
lower than originally projected and an updated projection of 1Q13 was provided. We note that management remains
blinded to the data reviewed by the IDMC as is not aware of the number of events that have occurred in the trial to
date. As part of its review of the data, the IDMC conducted a futility analysis and concluded that continuing the trial
was non-futile. It should be noted that while the trial can be halted for futility, there is no stopping rule for efficacy.


• Updating model following 3Q12 results. We are updating our model to reflect 3Q12 financial results (Figure 1)
reported last week in the company's form 10-Q. Ziopharm reported EPS loss of ($0.23), compared to our estimate of
($0.30) and consensus of ($0.31). The primary differences between estimated and reported results were lower than
expected R&D spending and a one-time non-cash charge of $3.9MM related to the change in fair value of warrants.
Total operating expenses were $21.9MM, with R&D expenses of $16.2MM compared to our estimate of $19.2MM and
SG&A expenses were $5.7MM, vs. our $4.9MM. The company ended the quarter with cash of $95MM which we view
as sufficient to fund operations through 2H13.

Thanks. The more data points the better. biothoughts- do you have a sense as to why Ziop never published OS for it's
phase II? That would be very helpful, especially as Threshold announced over 21 months OS in its Phase II
yesterday. If its more than 21 months, it would very, very good news to people with sarcoma. If its 14 months or better,
it is still good news as it would be equal to ifos/dox with less toxicity. Its hard to imagine Ziop doesn't have the data.
Any thought?

This is very good news imo. Quotes from analysts:


o JP Morgan - "Picasso3 did pass the IDMC’s interim futility analysis" (this means they are seeing Pali efficacy or it
would have been halted for futility).


"ZIOP remains confident in the PFS performance of the control arm--is relatively confident this should not be the case
given the data recently presented at ESMO for ifosfamide (a pro-drug for palifosfamide)" - Dox has been tested and
retested and the control arm is not suddenly going to be the reason the trial is lasting longer especially since Dox is in
both arms. - I bet its Pali-Dox. This is great news as we only need to get to the Votrient approved endpoint 2 months
PFS.


" We continue to see a relatively high probability of Phase 3 success for palifosfamide in first-line metastatic STS.
Reiterate $8 target and Outperform"


o Brinson Patrick: "Picasso Delay a Positive. Use current volatility/price as an attractive entry point. Outperform"


We View the PICASSO 3 Delay as Positive News


ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc. (ZIOP) yesterday announced that, after an analysis of progression-free survival (PFS)
events by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) the palifosfamide PICASSO 3 trial in frontline
metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (mSTS), the projected timing for the triggering event and announcement of top-line
PFS results has been delayed from this quarter to the end of 1Q13. We believe the anticipated analysis of PFS in
PICASSO 3 will be in favor of the palifosfamide treatment arm. With the shares currently at the lower end of values
derived from our valuation analysis, we believe significant upside exists and reiterate our Market Outperform rating
and 12-month price target of $7.


We View the Delay as Positive News PICASSO 3 is designed with 85% power to detect a 0.60 hazard ratio (HR) ratio
PFS advantage with palifosfamide. The company designated PFS as the primary endpoint for accelerated approval,
and designated overall survival (OS) as the endpoint for full approval. The update on the trigger event’s delay likely
also delays the timing of top-line OS data release, and thus may be viewed by some investors as negative news. We
had believed the timing of top-line PFS data release this quarter as aggressive and only modeled modest sales of
Palifosfamide in 2014 ($12.9MM), with the expectation for 3Q14 accelerated approval and full approval gained in
2015. As the IDMC recommended that PICASSO 3 proceed as designed and conducted with no changes, we remain
confident that PICASSO 3 will demonstrate a PFS benefit with palifosfamide.


We Recommend Using Share Volatility as an Entry Point The announcement of top-line PICASSO 3 PFS results is a
binary event that we anticipate will be a key positive share driver. We recommend taking advantage of recently

Hope, it is due to that Pali showed very strong efficacy based on PFS in P2 so Ziop stopped Pali's P2 trial and moved
to P3 trial upon FDA agreement. It saved time and money for Ziop. There will be PFS and OS for Pali in P3 in 2013.


Delayed announcement helps to lose a lot of option premium. Shorts people will feel more pain when option
expiration date is coming soon. I bet that there will be short squeeze in near future.

(announcement to be made in last week of March).


12 Feb 2013, 05:46 PM

The big issues for ZIOP include


1) Why did they fail to get an SPA for the phase 3 study? From 2011 10-K: "Although we did engage in the SPA
process, we, with guidance from the FDA, elected to initiate the trial without having obtained SPA agreement from the
FDA. "


2) Different patient groups. The OPEN LABEL phase 2 study was 1st or second line in unresectable or metastatic
STS, the DOUBLE BLIND PLACEBO CONTROLLED phase 3 study is in first line metastatic STS.


3) ECOG status of patients in phase 2 study (could be 0 or 1) was never disclosed. The phase 3 study permits ECOG
0, 1, 2. Not the same.


ZIOP had a nice run, but this is starting to remind me of ONTY or CLSN.


13 Feb 2013, 12:38 PM


Hope4Future
bio.bobby, 
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think I recall the reason they didn't get an SPA is because the FDA wanted OS
as primary endpoint and ZIOP wanted to risk going with PFS. My impression about this may be from Dr.
Lewis going out of his way, time and again, to remind us that there is now a precedent for PFS as primary
endpoint. I believe THLD does have an SPA with OS as primary endpoint; however, I do believe that for
sarcoma PFS is a valid primary endpoint and maybe the FDA has come around to this view as Dr. Lewis says
(again and again). 
Regarding first or second line, have you seen a breakdown of percent in P2 that were second line? I haven't.
Would be interesting to see how many second line patients there were. For several types of sarcoma dox/ifos
is first line, so it seems to make sense to replace ifos w/ palifos in first line. 
Regarding your last point, I hope the similarities are form rather than substance! (yes, there are some high
level similarities with CLSN). We'll know soon enough.

bio.bobby
I think your recollection of why no SPA is correct. I find this troubling, as the FDA will have to approve the
drug, not Jonathan Lewis. You're also correct that THLD has an SPA for the same indication using OS as
endpoint. To me this is troubling. Why would the FDA approve one drug on PFS and force another company
to get OS data?


From ZIOP's 2010 ASCO presentation, there were 23 1st line patients and 10 2nd line patients in both
groups. Response was not broken down by prior treatment, though. Given the pali + dox signal in phase 2
was arrived at based on 10 events, this could be an issue.


Also troubling, PFS for dox arm in ZIOP's phase 2 study seems low.


14 Feb 2013, 08:23 AM


WalkTheTalk, Contributor
BioBobby,


You has a good point that there are 10 events in in Pali+dox group in P2. But please remember that it is P2
which you just need statistical small enough sample size to prove the concept. They proved the concept with
very good p value (P <0.02) as following: 
PFS:  
– Hazard ratio is 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191-0.951) favoring palifosfamide + doxorubicin (p-value = 0.019)  
– Median improvement 3.4 months (4.4 vs 7.8 months) 
• Response Rate: 23% vs 9%  
• Safety: Clinically similar between arms


In addition, FDA agreed that they need 3 months of PFS in their Pali P3. So it is very approachable for them
to reach. However, since P3 is much larger sample size and double blinded, it is hard to predict the final
results.


I agree OS is important. However, Doctors agree if there is any drug which improve quality of life of metastatic
STS and there is no other drug to improve OS, they will prescribe it for their patients. FDA will consider to
approve it. Pali was indicated to improve quality of patient life significantly in P2 trial.


14 Feb 2013, 12:48 PM


bio.bobby
" since P3 is much larger sample size and double blinded, it is hard to predict the final results"


I agree with you here, and really don't know if pali will succeed or not. I do wish ZIOP would disclose the
ECOG status of the patients in the P2 study, and am baffled that they have not.


As with all companies that go from open label studies to proper dbl blind studies, I worry about the effect of
equipoise. I did come across a 2012 Europrean J. Cancer study in which first line STS patients on
doxorubicin had PFS of 6.4 months. As with all cancer studies, it can be tough to compare across trials.

Thank you for pointing out this trial w/ 6.4 months in Dox arm. The EORTC trial w/ 4.6 month median PFS in
dox arm had > 2/3 of patients with lung mets. As you say, it's tough to compare across trials. The learning
curve is steep!


The 2010 ASCO Pali P2 abstract says "Randomization was well-balanced for age, histological subtype and
line of therapy". I'm learning that unfortunately what biotech execs DON'T say in public is often more
important than what they do say, so now I'm wondering why ECOG PERFORMANCE STATUS or lung mets
(which is typical for sarcoma) wasn't included in the statement about what was balanced. Sounds like this
concerns you as well.


(Thanks for the details breaking down the 33 in each arm into 23 1st line and 10 second line- I couldn't find
this, not in the abstract)


14 Feb 2013, 03:11 PM


WalkTheTalk, Contributor
Hope, Pali P3 trial would have been stopped if DMC decided it as futility. Since DMC allowed it to keep going until it
have enough PFS events, it indicated that it is not futility so far. Enough PFS events also increased probability of
efficacy of Pali if control event is similar as in the P2. Based on their P2 results, they selected patients in specific
group to minimize control effect. For example, the numbers of patients over 60 in P3 are more than in P2 due to
patients with age over 60 are usually not affected by Dox in control group. it may explained why they selected
different patient groups for first line treatment. Dr. Lewis, CEO of Ziopharma, has strong proven clinical trial
experience to design this trial. But they don't know the final result until the data is opened and analyzed. We will know
the real results at the end of March. Knock on wood.
