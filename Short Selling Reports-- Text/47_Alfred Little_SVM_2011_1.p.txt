SilverCorp Management Fails To Refute Evidence Its Earnings Are Off
5X
Sep. 21, 2011 3:36 PM ET68 comments
by: Alfred Little


SilverCorp Metals (NYSE and TSE: SVM) management asserts that its key operating
subsidiary Henan Found Mining Co. Ltd. ("Henan Found") is highly profitable, having
made 850,723,013 RMB ($125 million) combined net income in 2009 and 2010
attributable to its two shareholders as follows:


77.5% to Victor Mining Ltd., SVM's 100% owned offshore subsidiary
22.5% to Henan Non-Ferrous Geological Mineral Resources Co., Ltd.
("HNGMR"), SVM's Chinese State-owned JV partner


Under Chinese international accounting standards, HNGMR reports its 22.5% share of
Henan Found's net income as investment income on its audited financials. We obtained
original stamped copies of HNGMR's audited 2009 and 2010 financials (available here
with translation here) that in our experience should be highly reliable due to the fact that
HNGMR is a Chinese state-owned enterprise ("SOE") with no incentive to hide earnings
or evade tax. HNGMR includes its share of earnings from Henan Found along with
earnings from minority stakes in five other companies. To determine precisely the amount
of proportional income from its 22.5% investment in Henan Found, we obtained the
financials of each of HNGMR's five other minority holdings (available here). From these
records we calculated the amount of HNGMR's investment income from Henan Found as
shown in the following table that breaks down the sources and amounts of HNGMR's
investment income in 2009 and 2010:

5/18/2018 SilverCorp Management Fails To Refute Evidence Its Earnings Are Off 5X - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (NYSE:SVM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/295110-silvercorp-management-fails-to-refute-evidence-its-earnings-are-off-5x 2/19


HNGMR's share of income from its investment in Henan Found for 2010 was only
22,118,311 RMB, or 93,708,627 RMB less than the 115,826,938 RMB that Henan Found
reported, a difference of 524%.There is no possible excuse for this variance. This
strongly indicates that Henan Found's 2010 earnings disclosed by SVM are likewise
overstated by 524%.


In 2010 Henan Found was SVM's only profitable subsidiary. Hence SVM's reported net
income appears to be overstated by at least 5X.


SVM management responded (here, page 8) by disclosing that an "allocation exists"
whereby 70% of HNGMR's dividend from Henan Found is actually paid to a never before
disclosed additional non-controlling interest holder of Henan Found they abbreviate
"HNGMR's 1st Bridge" without providing the legal name of this "separate legal entity" for
investigators to be able to verify its existence, ownership or financial records. A thorough
search found no such separate legal entity in the ownership records of Henan Found or
HNGMR.


Our analysis above shows that HNGMR's investment income reported for 2010 from
Henan Found is less than 1/5th of the amount Henan Found reported paying. Rather than
explaining this serious discrepancy SVM management simply changed the subject and
offered up a false and confusing look at dividend payments from Henan Found to HNGMR
and the undisclosed "1st Bridge" entity.


SVM management falsely claims that HNGMR and the "1st Bridge" entity are subject to an
additional 12.5% tax on dividend payments from Henan Found. There has been no such
tax in China since January 1st, 2008.


According to the Income Tax Law published in 2007 (link here for the Tax Law and here for
its Implementation), the dividend or bonus received by a resident enterprise for its
investment in another resident enterprise is exempt from the income tax. As Henan Found
and HNGMR are both resident enterprises, the dividend Henan Found paid to HNGMR is
exempt from tax.


To completely disprove SVM management's claim, let's assume HNGMR did pay the
12.5% income tax on the dividends from Henan Found. SVM claims this tax payable
amounted to 2,883,022 and 3,437,125 RMB in 2009 and 2010.


If we take a look at HNGMR's financial reports, we see pretax profits for 2009 and 2010 of
20,213,989 and 31,065,876 RMB, respectively. Income tax payable is only 175,783 and
373,865 RMB for 2009 and 2010, respectively, completely inconsistent with the tax

payable claimed by SVM management. How is this possible unless HNGMR, as we
showed in accordance with the Income Tax Law pays no income tax on dividends from
Henan Found?


Furthermore in SVM management's calculation of the alleged 12.5% tax paid by HNGMR
on dividends received management miscalculated.


The correct formula is:


Dividend Income / (1 - 12.5%)*12.5% = tax payable


For 2009, for example:


20,925,000/(1-12.5%)*12.5%=2,989,285.71 RMB tax payable


It does not match with the 3,437,125 RMB that SVM management calculated in their
response. Anyone familiar with Chinese taxation can verify the calculation above.


In conclusion, SVM management completely failed to refute the strong evidence we
presented showing the company's earnings are inflated at least 5X. We encourage SVM's
auditor and independent directors to take a careful look at these facts.

Jason,


Just keep buying like the insiders and SVM. You should do an article on Seeking Alpha for tomorrow morning and
smack Al around. Obviously, Al did this to get his scare tactic / short and distort headline on Yahoo. If you do, please
use the link below and mention Al's legal problems with DEER and how he offered to stop his false allegations against
them if they dropped legal remedy. Finally, where is his cash allegation and the other previous. Thanks.

I have to chime in here. The people that post about SVM are children. I have never seen so much venom aimed at
shortsellers. Being short a stock is just as good as being long, you can make money either way. It's just that being
short is selling first and buying later. It's the opposite order as going long.


Al has provided very important info here, that if you are short or long the stock, you should want to know about. Using
his information, I decided the best way to make money is to go short SVM.


The Henan Found subsidiary is the only source of income the company has. It is 22.5% owned by a Chinese
government entity. Being a SVM shareholder means you are the owners of the company, and you should want to
know all about the other owner of the subsidiary. Al has found that HNGMR is only making 1/5th of what it should if
Henan Found is as profitable as Silvercorp says it is.

Silvercorp says there is another entity called "1st Bridge" that HNGMR's dividends go to. This is Silvercorp's words,
not Al's. This entity has never before been known about, and Al can't find it anywhere on the internet. It's like it doesn't
even exist.


FWIW, I called the British Columbia Exchange Commission, and there is an investigation underway at this moment on
Silvercorp. This is the webpage for the investigation, I spoke with Mike Pesunti.

Adam,


Every single lie from Alfred little and others have been responded to and debunked by SVM. So far its SVM
20-something, anonymous authors ZERO. In a day or two your post here will look very foolish.


Interesting how you link the article to the BCEC from 2 weeks ago when they first heard about the anonymous
letter. How come no reference of the RCMP or the FBI assisting Silvercorp to find the anonymous authors?
Doesnt support your point of view to highlight that?

The webpage states: "B.C. regulator reviewing anonymous complaint against SilverCorp Metals Inc.".


The investigation is into the anonymous complaint, not SVM.


I think you are just trying to create more FUD. It looks like your "short and cover below $6" play is no longer a
conservative play?

When i look at the explosion in the size of the short position in svm in a matter of days there is NO ONE going
to convince me that there isnt naked short selling going on here !!!! 
This short & distort scheme being perpetrated by the anonomyous fraudsters stinks to high heaven!!!! 
For those that are legitimately short svm you have taken that position because the info that has been
presented to you has led you to the conclusion that your best opportunity for profit is to go short and that is
what a market is all about . Time will tell how it all plays out . Best of luck!

That press release that your referring to is dated September 9. It's old news. It has nothing to do with the
latest Alfred Little hit piece. Silvercorp is cooperating with the investigation and the BCSC wants the author of
the complaint to come forward. That's all old news. I think the best way for you not to lose money is to cover
your short.

No, I am not. I am not working with him or anyone else, only for myself. I also realize that my articles really
don't affect the stock at all. In fact, if anything, the stock went up after my article was written. So all this anger
and venom at writers posting about shorting stocks is all a waste.


And even if someone writing to short a stock does affect it, that's no reason to try to bully the short seller.
Luckily, we live in a country where free speech is allowed, we're lucky we don't live in China or the Middle
East for example, where people can't speak their mind about companies. We need more financial
transparency, not less. Notice on the long-short section on Seeking Alpha, the long articles always vastly
outweigh the short articles. In this stock market, take a random stock and the odds it will go up or down is 50-
50. Therefore, investors should be just as willing to go short as long, if they are smart. As an investing
community on Seeking Alpha, we need to stop bullying writers who recommend shorting stocks, and treat
them the same way as writers who are long stocks. OK, rant ended.

The anonymous authors are doing nothing wrong in my opinion. You don't think these things that I shined a
light on in my article are at all shady? And this AL article here has not been addressed. Silvercorp says
there's another unknown entity that's getting money which is why HNGMR reported so much less income. At
the same time, HNGMR was able to sell parts of Henan Found in an auction for a 10th of the value of the
NYSE listed common stock. I don't know what's going on behind the scenes at Silvercorp, and I think they
should have full disclosure of every financial detail at this point.

Adam, the real issue is that you publish the article AFTER you have shorted the stock.


Most people will have no issue if you were to publish your article first, then wait a few days before shorting the
stock.

Adam Gefvert, CFA, Contributor
OK, next time I'll do that. I've realized that my posting about a stock will have nothing to do with the share
price, at least for a few days.


22 Sep 2011, 07:20 AM


goldnsilverbuyer
What's shady is the fact that you directed us to a press release that was almost 2 weeks old and had nothing
to do with the latest allegation. You probably wanted to spread fear among the owners of the stock by making
us think that BCSC had suddenly taken a new negative view of the company. There is NO proof of that. I ask
you which is worse being a child or a stock manipulator? Without repentance there can be no forgiveness!


22 Sep 2011, 07:57 AM


Adam Gefvert, CFA, Contributor
Someone wanted to know about the investigation. I never said it was news. You think me posting that had
something to do with driving the stock price down? This is what I'm talking about censorship. We live in a free
country, nobody should be censored from speaking their mind, even if it does "spread fear". People are
intelligent enough to make up their own minds based on the facts.


22 Sep 2011, 08:04 AM

So in effect you support terrorists. Terrorists speak their mind and "spread fear". You may need psychiatric

Apparenly the RCMP and FBI disagree. I got a feeling its not just out of their good hear they are assisting

pone
And people who go long a stock don't buy the stock before they publish their research?


Isn't Barrons magazine covered from the front page to the back with hedge fund and global fund managers
who bought some stock at 40 cents, that is worth $1, and when the stock is at 90 cents they come out with an
article in Barrons telling us it is worth $1? The entire point of Barrons is for Smart Money (the fund managers)
to sell their greatly appreciated holdings to the dumb money (the subscribers to Barrons). Why not publish all
your venom towards that kind of wide scale manipulation of investors? I don't see a problem with Alfred Little -
who is in the big scheme nobody - publishing very relevant observations about filings and corporate
structures.


I don't take any position regarding SVM specifically, but there is no difference between the shorts and longs in
terms of acting on their self interest. The only difference is that when a long publishes an opinion she gets
ignored, and when the same person publishes a short opinion there are pages of hate mail.

Buster01
Definitely added to SVM stock in the last few days. I foresee this stock only going up. At first, I think Alfred Little was
an actual person/group with real plans to fraud the market; now I just think it's a couple desperate people trying to get
the stock low enough to cover their poorly timed shorts.


Disclosure: I am very long on SVM.

How many times do people have to learn? A company operating in China with a multitude of discrepancies in their
financials. Over the past 4 months Seeking Alpha had become chalf full of blog posts on companies that were made
days before the auditor resigns and the company gets delisted. The blog posts written by guys with business degrees
who arrogantly dismiss the short reports and talk about how cheap the company is based on their CLAIMED earnings.
Oops.......I guess you just lost 90%. Haha. Ask Glen Bradford.


Anyone claiming that they added to their long position here is obviously an amatuer. If you like silver stocks go with
one of the hundreds of other ones trading at around the same multiple that don't have the risk of being halted
tomorrow. The stock hasn't even gone down enough to say it is extremely cheap compared to its peers. Many of you
young "investors" may experience your baptism by fire experience that all traders go through with SVM.


P.S.


Even if the FBI and RCMP are trying to find the identity of Al that does not mean that SVM is not overstating their
earnings as Al claims. It merely means they are trying to find out who he is. The RCMP will not be the ones
determining if SVM has made misrepresentations or if Al is lying so who gives a shit if they want to talk to him. Even if
he did exaggerate on DEER look how the stock has performed. There is little to be gained from being long and
potentially much to be lost. Do not be irrational. Switch into something else. Anyone long this stock at this point is a
numbnut!!!!!!!!!!!

I do not have to prove anything to say that the risk/reward is not worth being long. You are not looking at this
situation the right way. It is a just a stock You should have no emotional attachment to. Who cares if it is or
isn't a fraud. Not worth the risk. It is only slightly cheaper than peers but with 90%+ downside based on a
possible news event that you know you cannot be sure of. Be honest with yourself. You look at yourself in the
mirror and ask if you really can be absolutly certain it is not a fraud. Buy another silver stock if you like silver.

Agreed Jules86; going long on SVM at this point is a gamble. I don't believe in gambling when it comes to my
money, I believe in investing in solid, undervalued companies which will grow for many years to come. At this
point, SVM doesn't meet this criteria.


You people are missing the big picture. Whether SVM has overstated its earnings or not, Chinese companies
have built a reputation for shady business practices/dealing and investors should be weary of putting money
in them. Remember Sino Forest Corp? Or the fake "Apple Stores" they found in China a month or so ago?
Even Robert Kiyosaki said he did a mining deal in China and got burned.


So the Chinese have built a reputation of deceptive business practices and it allows short sellers to attack
them, and its their own fault. I know one thing, I'm done with SVM and I'm glad I got out. If all this blows over
and they're truly innocent then I might reinvest, but for now I'm looking at other companies/industries.

I'm glad you're out too. You have no idea of the meaning of the words solid and undervalued when it comes to

else to blame.

Deathstalker, I think the main issue is that many of us who are long and have no plans to sell are blown away
by how gulliable many people are, with all due respect, including yourself. The short term volatility doesnt
really bother me that much. But its amazing that all it took was an anonymous post from an author with no
identity and most likely no expertise for you and many others to write off an entire investment. For some
reason I got a feeling people that are this gulliable dont just fall for short plans. Do you also buy stocks based
on such pure speculation?


Actually you are missing the big picture. You sound like a trader, not an investor. The only time i want my
stock high is when im ready to sell. Otherwise I want it to be cheap when Im still buying. I dont plan to to sell
SVM for years. In the meantime im snapping up shares are great prices.

22 Sep 2011, 10:36 AM


Deathstalker_Scorpion
dreadlordnaf, I'm not a trader; when I buy a stock, I plan to hold it for at least a year at the bare minimum, and
will hold it indefinitely so long as the company perform wells and the stock is undervalued.


I read SVM's entire annual report for 2010, if I was speculating why would I do that? The fact is, I invested
because this company "appeared" to have sound fundamentals, but as we all know, appearances can be
deceiving.


Ever read the Art of War by Sun Tzu? The Chinese love deception, the trouble is, they've been caught in so
many deceptions that it is hard to tell the real from the fake. China, unfortunately, has built a reputation for
deception, and because of this rep, it is easy for short sellers to target Chinese owned companies like SVM.


At first, I ignored the allegations against SVM because they were anonymous. Then Muddy Waters came out
and that is when I got concerned, because these guys exposed Sino Forest Corp, and they have a solid
reputation. So you have Muddy Waters and Alfred Little targeting them, and my question is, whose next? I
just don't think this investment is worth the risk. But hey, maybe I'm wrong, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.


24 Sep 2011, 03:32 PM


Deathstalker_Scorpion
goldnsilverbuyer, the fact is, unless you're an insider at SVM, you have absolutely no clue what is really going
on. You're going based on what Riu Feng and the management are telling you, and, this information may or
may not be true.


Remember Enron? Yeah, Ken Lay said everything was okay to, and we see how that turned out. My point is,
you can't trust SVM management. They might be telling the truth, but then again, Muddy Waters and Alfred
Little may be telling the truth. All I know is, someone is lying, and until the truth comes out, I don't want to be
involved with this company. At this point, whether you're for or against SVM, you're gambling, if you're short or
long, you're gambling. I'm neither, I'm not long or short. Investing in SVM at this point is like flipping a coin.


Some of you guys sound way too emotional to be investors. I sold my SVM shares at a loss and didn't blink
an eye. I felt no sorrow whatsoever, because I've lost money before and I will lose money again. Everybody
loses sometimes, even Buffet has lost. But you guys are too emotional and I think you may want to rethink
investing because if this company tanks some of you guys sound like you may jump off a cliff. Just saying.

Right now svm is cheaper than nearly all major silver miners by every valuation you can apply based on svms
numbers which it is looking more & more like they are legit.

Gefvert, the link you provide takes you to a press release dated September 09. There is nothing there about Alfred
Little latest allegation. Yes, the BCSC is investigating the allegations against SVM and would like the author of the
complaint to come forward. It's all old news. I suggest that if you wish to avoid losing money you cover your short.

Remember BRE-X? which was a somewhat higher level of a scam, however one should not forget the lessons of the
past, and proceed with caution, due diligence, if your long, CYA with some puts, if the info above is correct, the stock
will completely tank, if not it will rise with the intrinsic value of the company. put your money and investments in due
diligence, not faith in management.

Understanding just a "little" about how accounting works would help here!


In fact:


(1) HNGMR accounts for its equity investment in Henan Found on a COST BASIS because it is a "non-controlling
interest".


(2) Cost basis accounting requires dividends and profit distributions to be recorded as investment income, NOT the
pro-rata share of income as alleged by A-L. Profit distribution (otherwise known as dividend) is NOT the same thing
as profit/earnings: the excess of profit over dividend is RETAINED earnings. Get it? RETAINED!!! As in NOT
PAID...Please hire an accountant if you don't understand this and meanwhile consider stopping your embarrassing
"analysis" of financial statements!


(3) HNGMR is an apparatus to give the Henan Geological Brigades an ownership stake in the projects they have
been exploring and advancing in the province since after World War II ... but the exploration licenses themselves were
held by the specific brigade members who worked on a particular project. These brigade members were the ones who
vended the licenses to Henan Found in exchange for the 70% of the cooperative's profit-sharing in the project. This is
what Silvercorp means by "1st Bridge" -- better stated as "1st Brigade" -- with the 70% of distributed profits that
HNGMR pays to their individual brigade members who held the original exploration licenses. Now this is a bit of a
sensitive issue -- a matter purely between HNGMR and the Brigades (certainly none of our business) -- so Silvercorp
is understandably not going to trumpet it to the world. But apparently you won't stop beating a dead horse, so there
you go!


(4) This gets back to the recent "auction" ... it was most likely brigade members who own the entity that acquired the
5% of Henan Found from HNGMR ... at essentially book value. A nice deal, made available to the same guys who

vend it at all and could still be holding 100% (of course it probably wouldn't be producing millions of ounces of silver

Assume that SVM made a distribution or dividend to HNGMR. Do the SVM filings show that dividend or
distribution in any amount approaching the numbers being reported by HNGMR on its Chinese state filings?

anyway its surprising so many people dont know basic accounting or reading of the reports when the internet gives so
much info already.


anyway guys research please. 
dont take anyone's word for it. The people from wall street are all  
playing this scamming game pump and dump short and distort naked shorting etc then use articles from mass media

I am long SVM because no other silver stock has the potential that this one has. I will gladly take the risk for the
possible rewards. And to my judgement, the risks are minor. This stock has the potential to get over 30.00 in a year,
What other stock at this price has that potential.

Adam,


I have been speaking with Simon Moore via email. He has dodged almost every question I've posed to him. Here are
a few important ones.


1. I asked Simon Moore to answer yes or no to whether or not he provided his ACTUAL identity to the BCSC, FBI,
SEC, Canadian Royal Mounted Police, etc. He refused to answer due to "legal reasons." I informed Mr. Moore that
there is absolutely no legal barrier that should prevent him from being able to answer yes or no. He again refused to
answer and has stopped responding to my emails.


2. I asked Mr. Moore if he was planning on accepting SVM/DEER's subpoena. He again refused to even address my
question. I pressed further and told him that as an SVM investor, even I would have to reconsider my long position if
he were to come forward. Coming into the public light would open himself up to criminal prosecution which would
speak volumes about A-L's report. If it was based on fact then he'd have nothing to fear. A-L/Simon Moore continue to
stay in the shadows. If what they're posting is based on truth then what are they so afraid of?


3. I pointed out that A-L's allegations on lower than expected silver concentrate in the ore they analyzed is to be
expected as only LOW GRADE ore is sent to the mill for further processing. High grade ore goes directly to the
smelter. Had A-L reconciled the two totals, the total silver concentrate would have been much closer to the figures
SVM has provided. Furthermore A-L would have had to analyze TRUCKLOADS of ore to get a legitimate reading. A
handful of rocks, pebbles, and dust isn't adequate.

I literally laughed out when I saw SVM's ridiculous explanation to tax treatment on Henan Found's dividend to its JV
partners, as well as its incorrect calculation of tax on dividend. I guess this type of accounting error is something that
one would regularly expect from a legitimate $1B company, huh? Interesting, if that table of dividend calculation in
SVM's rebuttal to Alfred Little report was the same company has given to the auditor, it's a sure evidence of fraud.


For those who wondered why I haven't responded to some of the comments, questions and personal attacks on SA,
I'm in China checking out what trick SVM is trying to pull off on its investor tour. I'm also seeking my official opinions
and comments on all SVM's purported "official" documents, especially the lack of proof to substantiate its income
taxes payment. Will respond some of the fallacies (such as the preposterous explanation about Chinese tax law
treatment on inter-corporate dividend) put out by SVM in its press releases and rebuttals when I return.

Chris Wu, do you have something to add to tour review below, as you are trying to put a negative spin on
SVM's latest rebuttals and investment tour. This is written by an analyst that was part of the tour you mention
in your comment. Very curious to see if you have different insight, if you were actually following the tour as
you say. Which fund are you employed by?


On Site at Silvercorp 
By Jeff Clark, BIG GOLD


I’m writing from China, where I’m attending Silvercorp Metals’ (http://bit.ly/nR61Ft) mine tour with other
analysts and reporters. While I could cut the trip short to return to our Summit this weekend, we felt it was
more important to stay for the entire tour in light of recent events.


We met with company principals the first morning, including CEO and Explorer’s League honoree Rui Feng at
their downtown Beijing offices, where the bulk of the discussion centered around a point-by-point rebuttal of
the charges made by the now-infamous short sellers. With a reporter’s camera snapping, it became apparent
to me that Rui and company have shifted from playing defense to going on the offensive.


“We have eight attorneys now,” Rui explained. “We’re going after these guys.” He admitted that fighting the
allegations is getting 100% of his focus right now, something that might be concerning under normal
circumstances, but he’s bound and determined to assure shareholders that their investment is sound.


In addition to the lawsuit against some of the short sellers announced last Friday, SVM has hired well-known
forensics accounting firm KPMG to audit the company’s books. They’ll be reviewing every scrap of paper,
from bank statements to tax receipts, to make their own determination on the soundness of SVM’s finances. A
report is expected in about two weeks, and other than seeing ore with our own two eyes, this will arguably be
one of the most important steps in fighting the allegations.


Securities regulators are also on the offensive. Not only are they conducting their own investigation into the
source of the accusations, other Chinese companies previously targeted by the short sellers are pooling their
resources with regulators and SVM. While we don’t know that they’re all innocent, a number have taken
aggressive countermeasures; some have been so successful that their stocks have rebounded dramatically.


The tour has been more thorough and transparent than even I expected. We’ve been privy to internal
company documents, one of which is a daily tonnage report – something Rui sees every morning. It’s
abundantly clear that if operations were exaggerated, it would have to be quite an elaborate hoax. We met
with officials from two smelters the company uses, easily seeing that the grades they report match what SVM
has documented. We met with the company’s principal accountant in China; a random review of one day’s tax
receipts and the SVM’s internal spreadsheet show the numbers match. We also met with four officials from
the National Tax Bureau, who informed us in no uncertain terms that SVM’s subsidiaries have generated
substantial revenue to the local county. “We welcome any scrutiny,” they added.


I also asked many parties what they thought of the allegations. “They don’t know what we know,” said the
deputy general manager at the Ying mine. “They can sell the shares if they want, but we will buy them.” The

https://seekingalpha.com/article/295110-silvercorp-management-fails-to-refute-evidence-its-earnings-are-off-5x 17/19


county tax officials informed us they were never contacted by any party regarding revenue or tax receipts.
“The allegations are simply not true,” we heard through an interpreter. I asked an official at one of the
smelters we visited what he thought of the allegations; he laughed. We had dinner with four local government
officials, with the interpreter telling us the mayor was “pissed off” at the short sellers. And what about the
workers themselves? “Many are angry,” Rui told us. “And some just laugh at the accusations.”


But perhaps the most important aspect of the trip and of determining if there is any truth to the accusations is
the ore. We saw the parade of trucks drive by us, watched the weighing process, randomly leafed through
stacks of records documenting the ore that’s passed through the gates, witnessed the ore being transported
by boat and rail cart, looked on in amazement at the new 2,000-tonne-per-day mill in full operation, and
observed piles of finished product waiting to be shipped to the refineries. And yes, we toured the Ying mine
itself and saw with our own eyes those sparkling veins full of high-grade silver. I’ve got pictures of all this, and
I didn’t hide behind any trees to get them.


We have a lot more on the agenda; by the time you read this I’ll be on my way to meet with another tax office
and tour the GC and BYP mines. I’ll be filing a full report, complete with pictures and recommendations, for
International Speculator and BIG GOLD readers sometime next week. If you have a vested interest in this
stock, this is one report you won’t want to miss. I can tell you right now it will contain not only a complete
analysis of every aspect of the company, but a very specific recommendation of when to buy.


In the meantime, based on my extensive discussions with management; review of reams of both internal and
public documents; conversations with government, tax, and refinery officials; interviews with workers and
supervisors; observations of plant operations; and putting my hands on high-grade veins running throughout
the Ying mine, I have a message for the short sellers.


You’d better think about covering.

I wanted to say one more thing in regards to those of you who accused me of being a trader of speculator; a couple of
months ago, I could have sold SVM at a profit. I purchased SVM shares at around $8 bucks and the stock price briefly
rose to around $10 or $11.


Well, If I was a true speculator or trader I would have sold all my shares the moment I earned that profit...............I
didn't. The reason I didn't is because true value investors don't sell their stock until the stock reaches fair market
value, and I didn't feel SVM had achieved that yet. So this proves I'm not a true speculator otherwise I would have
sold the first chance I gained a profit. At this point, I wish I had sold it then.

The Globe ran an article yesterday about the president of SVM, they made him out to be an outstanding Canadian
with a great track record. I believe in the volatility of the company and will hold my call and put options. I just hope a
black swan doesn't happen while I am in this vulnerable position, i.e. the stock gets frozen or taken off the market for
some unknown reason.

Alfred Little has gotten himself//themselves sued, so their information had better be right. Frankly, I don't believe it.
Full disclosure: I don't own SVM. But allowing for the possibility that the accusations are correct, Alfred did
prospective investors a favor. If he's wrong, he's toast. Either way, these allegations resulted in what could turn out to
be an awesome bargain if/when SVM is seen to have successfully made their case, and is then exonerated.


If you feel SVM is innocent, consider buying 1/21/12 $15 Calls this week. After SVM stock taking such a beating,
these are now down over 90% ytd. You can own 10 contracts for less than $150. The fact that silver has been
smashed for nearly 30% in a week also makes this a great time to buy these. The 52 week high for the $15 Strike is
3.88, but you can buy it for .10 or .15 today. Should SVM return to its previous highs (52wk high is $16+), that small
bet could well provide a 10 bag return.


Especially if you're an existing SVM shareholder, this is a GREAT way to make lemonade out of the lemons Alfred
Little has served up for you (and may just go to prison for). Don't get mad; get ahead. Judo the situation and make
some money.


Revenge is best served cold.
