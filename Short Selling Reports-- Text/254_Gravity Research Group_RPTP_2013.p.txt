Raptor Pharmaceutical Corporation: A Dose Of Reality For Investors
Aug. 29, 2013 7:15 AM ET17 comments
by: Gravity Research


We have published an initiating coverage report on Raptor Pharmaceutical Corporation
(NASDAQ:RPTP) on August 29, 2013, with a price target of <$4.00. A PDF version of the
full 68-page report can be found at gravityresearchgroup.com/reports.


Raptor Pharmaceutical Corporation ("RPTP") recently had its flagship drug, Procysbi,
approved by the FDA to treat nephropathic cystinosis ("cystinosis"). RPTP currently trades
at $12.72/share and analysts have set a median price target of $13.00/share. However,
we believe that the present value of future cash flows RPTP can expect to earn from
Procysbi is less than $4.00/share even under ideal conditions, including 100% peak
cysteamine market share, universal acceptance by payers, and an average selling price of
$250,000/year in the US and $150,000/year in the rest of the world. We assign zero value
to RPTP's pipeline due to strong evidence that the fundamental theories behind its leading
indications are flawed.


1) Raptor Pharmaceutical Corporation ("RPTP") is attempting to sell Procysbi in the
US for an average selling price of $250,000 per patient per year: more than 25x the
price of current market leader Cystagon when the two drugs are nearly identical
and the most significant benefit to patients is that Procysbi only needs to be taken
twice a day as opposed to four times a day. Predictably, payer reception has been
mediocre. Achieving a true average selling price of $250,000/patient/year would require
an even higher sticker price (as high as $400,000/patient/year depending on how much
RPTP can squeeze from patients without private insurance)-making Procysbi within
spitting distance of being the most expensive drug on the market.  This seems outrageous
given that the only difference between Procysbi and Cystagon (the current market leader
for cystinosis patients) is enteric coating. Enteric coating is a commonly-used barrier
applied to many oral drugs and supplements that are unstable in acidic environments but
can be safely released in basic solutions. For the most part, this is used to prevent
treatments known to have negative side effects when digested in the stomach from being
digested there. The enteric will prevent those treatments from being digested until they
reach the intestine, which contains a more basic medium. Procysbi consists of a standard
capsule filled with tiny cysteamine spheres coated with enteric, whereas Cystagon is a
standard capsule filled with cysteamine powder. Unfortunately for RPTP, its Phase 3

clinical trials indicated that, rather than reducing negative side effects by being absorbed
in the intestine, the enteric coating on Procysbi made them worse when compared with
Cystagon.


All the other top-priced drugs are novel formulations for orphan diseases, cancer, and
other indications. While insurance companies and government payees accept high prices
for drugs that are expensive to develop, RPTP acquired the rights to Procysbi six years
ago for $2.6mm, with FDA approval nearly guaranteed. Enteric coating has been around
for over 100 years, and we were unable to find any case in which an approved drug was
coated with enteric and the resulting drug was denied FDA approval. The bar is set low
when a minor tweak such as enteric is being added to a drug that has already been
approved-the company sponsoring the clinical trials must simply show that their drug is
not significantly worse than what is already out there in terms of efficacy and safety.
Analysts believe that insurers will unanimously cover the drug without questioning the
pricing. Management and bulls have contended that since the community of patients is
small and each insurer has no more than a handful of patients, they will not bother
denying coverage.


We disagree. An insurance company interviewed by BioCentury indicated that long-term
clinical benefit and cost savings, neither of which are readily apparent, would be
necessary for the firm to consider covering Procysbi. The fact that zero insurance
companies have signed up for RPTP's capitation program indicates to us that even
companies who have currently granted coverage want to keep the option of canceling it
later.


While there will be some coverage, we believe investors underestimate the risk of
formularies and insurers rejecting Procysbi in favor of Cystagon, and approvals in the near
future will still be subject to constant scrutiny should the drug not provide a significantly
better long-term prognosis for patients. At least one payer has already elected not to
cover the drug at all.  Further, the term "coverage" can be misleading. While some
insurance companies may technically cover the drug, nearly all the payer formularies
we found with Procysbi listed classify the drug as "non-formulary", which
translated to increased copayments for patients (as high as 50% of the price!) if not
a total inability to access the drug. These included Wellcare,  Coventry,  MVP
Healthcare,  Unity Health,  Univera Healthcare,  Medica,  Arkansas BlueCross
BlueShield,  Group Health,  and Health Alliance.  Given the extraordinary price and
lack of differentiation compared with existing therapy, this was no surprise to us. An
industry veteran predicted it as well in May 2013 (emphasis added):

"Gary Owens, chair of Tower & Watson Rx Collaborative P&T Committee, said that
Procysbi will surely be excluded from closed formulary plans, or only covered
under exception. About 20%-25% of plans are closed formulary. He does not
envision that new patients will be started on Procysbi, unless they have
trouble tolerating Cystagon. And he expects use of the drug to be hemmed in by
clinical edits to verify that it isn't being wrongly prescribed or a patient being
controlled on Cystagon isn't requesting Procysbi for what the plan considers a trivial
reason."


We would consider the convenience of taking doses twice a day as opposed to four times
to be a "trivial reason", and believe RPTP's planned international expansion will be even
more challenging than the US. There are precedents of governments and private payers
refusing coverage for truly novel orphan drugs that are necessary for patients to survive
with no viable alternatives. Soliris, is the only drug available to treat two life-threatening
orphan indications: paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ("PNH") and atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome ("aHUS"). Government healthcare in Ontario and New Zealand do not
cover Soliris at all, and the UK has refused to cover Soliris for aHUS without further
information on costs and benefits. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence, has publicly stated that drugs should not cost more than £20,000 to
£30,000 per quality-adjusted life year.  Soliris has no similar alternatives, while Procysbi
does-we believe that there will be significant resistance to the prices RPTP is proposing
within most European countries that analysts have not factored into their valuations of
RPTP. Even in the event that Procysbi is accepted by payers, it is very likely that it would
be covered with stipulations: perhaps it would only available to children, or only available
to take at night, or only available as a fail-step solution for patients. Any of those
limitations would drastically reduce the potential market size for the drug. Additionally,
payers are constantly re-evaluating coverage, and coverage today doesn't necessarily
translate to coverage tomorrow-especially if sufficient evidence of long-term advantages in
taking Procysbi as opposed to Cystagon fails to materialize


2) Based on RPTP's Phase 3 trials, Procysbi caused nearly three times as many
negative side effects as Cystagon: RPTP claims to investors that Procysbi improves the
side effects and quality of life for cystinosis patients. However, outside of reducing the
number of times patients have to take pills from four times to two times each day,
Procysbi's published clinical results indicate the opposite. Rather than improving the side
effects for patients, Procysbi made some of them dramatically worse, with three times as
many gastro-intestinal side effects reported when compared with Cystagon, and new
adverse side effects that weren't even present when patients were treated with

Cystagon!  See http://www.procysbi.com/docs/Procysbi-Full-Prescribing-Information.pdf
for RPTP's comparison of adverse reactions taken directly from its prescribing information
(Cystagon is "Immediate-release cysteamine").


While there have been claims regarding a reduction in odor, these were based on only
four patients, and we find the significance of those results to be highly suspect due to the
fact that half of the patients reporting lesser odors were also taking decreased cysteamine
doses.  Additionally, some caretakers and patients are reporting the exact opposite
(along with other negative side effects) on the Cystinosis Research Network Facebook
page:


"So here is a thought...Procysbi is awesome! It allows us to sleep through the night
and live less by the clock. However, the odor that emanates from her breath and
body is far worse and for far longer than [C]ystagon (Kacy had virtually no odor). I
worry about this socially."


"Jen Laura smelled worse on [RP]103, and Susan Laura threw up tons. Dr[.] Dohil
was suggesting she try of mixture of both but I don't think she would even try it
again"


"I thought Tanner didn't have an odor and then found out he was flushing it down the
toilet."


"Landon started Procysbi and has been having a hard time in the morning with
vomiting."


"I couldn't tolerate Procysbi - I had 12 [hour] nausea that made it impossible to drink
enough. It resulted in a significant bump in my creatinine (which returned to baseline
upon stopping the Procysbi). I'm back to Cystagon."


Predictably, patients on Cystagon and Procysbi have to take roughly the same total
amount of the active drug (cysteamine). Giving the same drug at half the frequency,
requires the patient to take twice as much drug per dose in order to achieve a similar
response. When the drug already produces a number of unpleasant side effects, doubling
the dose doesn't minimize those complications, but magnifies them as indicated by the
clinical results. We believe initial success in launching the drug may be misleading,
and that there will likely be a moderate number of patients who try the drug, but
stop taking it due to the increased adverse effects

3) There is limited evidence of demand for the drug over its competitor, Cystagon:
RPTP scrounged 43 patients for its Phase 3 trials, while a concurrent clinical trial for
Cystaran, a drug developed by Sigma Tau to treat corneal crystal buildup in cystinosis
patients, produced approximately 300 patients


4) Analysts currently have a median price target of $13/share for RPTP. We believe the
market is currently massively overvaluing RPTP due to errors in analysis and certain
critical factors that analysts covering the stock are not taking into account. These include
the following items:


a. Analysts are grossly overestimating the total market size for Procysbi: Certain
analysts have modeled out numbers that would require RPTP to not only take 100% of the
estimated market of cystinosis patients currently on Cystagon, but also add additional
patients on top of that. We find this to be absurd-cystinosis is a very serious, life-
threatening disease, and the symptoms are very distinct. Patients experience excess
build-ups of the amino-acid cystine in cells, and if left untreated with cysteamine, the
cystine will build up into detectable crystals. The kidneys and eyes are particularly
vulnerable to crystal formation, and we could not find any other diagnosis with similar
symptoms. We are confident that any patient with a competent nephrologist would have
diagnosed cystinosis immediately. Management, to its credit, has publicly stated on
numerous occasions (as recently as August 8, 2013) that the US market in particular
appears to be 400-500 cystinosis patients, and that there is no reason to revise those
numbers.


b. Analysts are not accounting for the significant headwinds RPTP faces in its
attempts to convince payers and patients to accept its drug at the price it is
suggesting. These include the following issues:


i. Procysbi is priced at over 25x its competitor without significant positive differentiation


ii. Procysbi has been documented as causing nearly 3x as many instances of negative
side effects compared with Cystagon and patients starting the drug following FDA
approval have made complaints about those adverse effects, including vomiting and body
odor described as "room-clearing". This leads us to believe that the initial success in
launching the drug may be a red herring, and that there will likely be a moderate number
of patients who try the drug, but stop taking it due to the increased adverse effects


iii. Lack of demand among patients for a new drug


See points 1, 2, and 3 for more details on these issues.

c. Analysts are failing to account for the 35% of the target US market that do not
have private insurance per RPTP Management, failing to account for patients who
have capped insurance or significant deductibles/copayments, and failing to
account for the fact that many insurance companies have already classified
Procysbi as "non-formulary": RPTP, through its RaptorCares program, offers financial
assistance with deductibles and premiums, or Procysbi itself at no charge for such
patients. This further limits the maximum possible revenue RPTP can expect to generate
through Procysbi. RPTP Management explicitly stated that 35% of the target population
was without private insurance during a recent call.  Per our discussions with an industry
expert, subject to state-by-state decision, Medicaid may choose not to reimburse RPTP
more than the going price for Cystagon (approximately $10,000/patient/year), and patients
unable to afford any private insurance are unlikely to be able to pay or be interested in
paying anywhere near RPTP's asking price. Investors should take into consideration
capped insurance policies, copayments reimbursed via RaptorCares, or any other
nuances that would negatively impact the true average selling price.


d. Analysts have not accounted for the fact that a citizen petition could bring an end
to RPTP's Procysbi exclusivity in three years: Subject to a citizen petition (typically
filed by a competitor), the FDA may choose to revoke RPTP's orphan drug designation.
There was a very similar case in 2012 where the FDA revoked an orphan drug
designation for a company that produced a treatment that was nearly identical to an
existing one after the manufacturer of the existing treatment filed such a petition. This
would limit RPTP's timeline to truly monetize Procysbi to three years rather than seven.
After three years, generic competition would be permitted to enter. If this were to happen,
we believe the resulting fair value of the equity would be less than $2.50/share.


e. Even without a citizen petition, US exclusivity will expire in 2020 and the patents
covering Procysbi are unlikely to hold up in court: Generics will likely file Abbreviated
New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") and enter the market when exclusivity expires (2020 in
the US and likely 2023 in the EU). After that point, RPTP will no longer be able to sell its
drug anywhere near an average price of $250,000/patient/year. We did not come across
any analyst models that incorporated the impact of generic manufacturers. This is virtually
guaranteed if Procysbi experiences any success-precedents have shown generic
companies trampling each other to file ANDAs and Paragraph IV certifications to compete
with orphan drugs with minimal revenue. One company booked $35.1mm from an orphan
drug in FY 2010, and following the lapse of exclusivity in 2011, no less than five other
companies challenged its relevant patents.

f. Analysts are underestimating the royalties and costs RPTP will owe to third
parties: RPTP has to pay UCSD "mid-single digit" royalty fees, Healthcare Royalty
Partners three tiers of royalty fees of between 2% and 12.25% of Procysbi revenue, and
additional fees for distribution and manufacturing. Analysts are projecting gross-to-net
revenue costs of as low as 2%.


g. It is impossible to arrive at certain analysts' price targets even using their own
models and the assumptions they provided: Consistent with our statement that even
using ideal assumptions RPTP is worth significantly less than it is currently trading at, we
observed that it is impossible to arrive at certain analysts' price targets even using their
own models and the assumptions they provided. This was frequently due to analysts'
basing price targets off of forward multiples (such as revenue) as a means of valuation
rather than profitability. We believe this is fallacious, and drugs should be valued as cash-
generating assets with a finite life-revenue typically reaches its peak relatively quickly and
the life cycle ends when the drug loses exclusivity or patent protection. Certain analyst
valuations also contained human mistakes (such as significant errors in discounting to
present value, forecasting based on incorrect inputs for prior periods, and miscalculating
share counts).


Other disturbing inputs and assumptions we came across in analyst models include the
following:


a. Implicitly assuming that Procysbi will successfully price near the top of all available
drugs by using the price of $250,000/patient/year across all patients, including those on
Medicaid, those without any medical coverage, and those with capped insurance or large
co-payments that would be covered by RPTP. This would be groundbreaking because it
would mark the first time a delayed-release version of a much cheaper drug successfully
priced near the top of all drugs in existence


b. Removing General & Administrative and Research & Development expenses from the
equation when valuing the future cash flows from Procysbi


c. Assuming a >50% Quarter-over-Quarter decline in Research & Development expenses


d. Using a 2.5% discount rate on future cash flows despite all the risks present


e. Valuing RPTP's other clinical pursuits at hundreds of millions of dollars despite strong
evidence that those indications will not produce any meaningful revenue in the future


f. Grossly understating the interest expense despite the fact that it is clearly spelled out in
the loan agreement

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1663702-raptor-pharmaceutical-corporation-a-dose-of-reality-for-investors 8/20


g. Using seemingly arbitrary share counts in future periods that ignore the dilutive effects
of Management options, warrants, and stock-based compensation. In the course of our
research, we did not come across any analyst models that properly accounted for the
current fully-diluted share count


Based on our calculations, the maximum possible present value of cash flows that RPTP
could generate for shareholders is less than $4.00/share. The target price is based off of
assumptions that we made in order to arrive at the greatest possible value of future cash
flows, and are far more bullish than our view of realistic scenarios that may play out for
RPTP. Below are some of the key assumptions:


a. RPTP would be able to quickly gain 100% global market share of current cysteamine
patients


b. RPTP would be able to successfully sell Procysbi domestically for the
$250,000/patient/year average selling price it has announced to investors, implying an
even higher sticker price in the US for private payers


c. RPTP would be able to successfully sell Procysbi for an average price of
$150,000/patient/year in the EU and the rest of the world


d. RPTP, via its RaptorCares program, would refund a conservative 10% average copay
across private payer patients in the US with no co-payments refunded in the EU or the
rest of the world


e. We believe that after 2023, RPTP will be unable to maintain profitability without a new
drug approval, and we believe there is compelling evidence that nothing in its current
pipeline will materialize. We did not assign any value to the pipeline outside of Procysbi for
cystinosis patients, and assumed that rather than face losses following FY 2023, RPTP
would dissolve operations and distribute all cash to shareholders


We believe that even at $4.00/share, RPTP leaves investors with significant additional
potential downside.


5) A citizen petition could bring an end to RPTP's Procysbi exclusivity in less than
three years, and the patents covering Procysbi are unlikely to hold up in court:
While RPTP's US patents covering Procysbi will not expire until 2027, Procysbi comes off
exclusivity in the US in less than seven years. Subject to a citizen petition (typically filed
by a competitor), the FDA may choose to revoke RPTP's orphan drug designation. There
was a very similar case in 2012 where the FDA revoked an orphan drug designation for a
5/20/2018 Raptor Pharmaceutical Corporation: A Dose Of Reality For Investors - Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. (NASDAQ:RPTP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1663702-raptor-pharmaceutical-corporation-a-dose-of-reality-for-investors 9/20


company that produced a treatment that was nearly identical to an existing one after the
manufacturer of the existing treatment filed such a petition. This would limit RPTP's
timeline to truly monetize Procysbi to three years rather than seven.


Unfortunately for RPTP investors, the two flimsy patents it holds on its Procysbi drug are,
in our opinion, virtually indefensible in court due to the fact that 1) using enteric coating is
not a new or novel method of drug delivery, and 2) even if it were, there are countless
ways to produce enteric coating and historical court precedents have shown that its use in
drug delivery leaves massive loopholes for generic manufacturers to walk through. While
RPTP's patents relating to its delayed-release cysteamine last until 2027, we believe that
investors will soon find that those patents, like many other drug delivery patents
depending on non-proprietary formulations, will not be considered novel or non-obvious in
court, and will easily be overturned by generic competition. Precedents have shown that
such patents are consistently rejected or circumvented even for much larger
pharmaceutical companies with significantly more sophisticated drugs. Cystagon is
produced by Mylan Laboratories, one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in
the world-if there were any commercial success selling Procysbi at the prices RPTP has
proposed, it would be foolish to think that Mylan would not jump at the chance to file an
Abbreviated New Drug Application and compete with Procysbi immediately after the
exclusivity period runs out. There are historical precedents showing that the concept of
combining existing drugs with enteric is not novel, and patents for such drug delivery
methods do not hold up in court. There is a specific precedent where Mylan was able to
bypass a set of patents held by AstraZeneca for a drug that contained "a sugar seed, a
drug layer, two sublayers, and an enteric coating"-it would be ill-advised to think that a
patent on enteric coating alone is going to stave off competing generic pharmaceutical
companies


We believe there is zero chance of RPTP's patents holding up in court-- what really
matters is the exclusivity period granted by the FDA, and RPTP's exclusivity period
expires in less than seven years from today. On top of that, given that Procysbi is merely a
modified version of Cystagon and not a new chemical entity or a drug that would not be
suggested by prior art, there is a meaningful possibility of a generic company successfully
filing a petition to revert RPTP's exclusivity back from "orphan drug exclusivity" status to
"other exclusivity" status-cutting the exclusivity period down from seven years to three
years. Even if insurance companies were willing to foot the astronomical bill for Procysbi
now, you can be sure they would cut off support the moment a cheaper generic version
hits the market

6) We believe the other indications RPTP is pursuing with cysteamine have shown
little to no evidence of efficacy, and given the functionality of cysteamine as an
irreversible binding agent (which leaves little mystery as to by-products or indirect
effects caused by the drug), the fact that it has been FDA-approved for treatment of
cystinosis since August 1994,  and its horrendous side effects, it is unlikely RPTP
will be able to find new, undiscovered uses for the drug in the future. For example, it
has already been tested on indications including HIV, schizophrenia, and depression, with
unfavorable results. The consistent, horrendous side effects of cysteamine are extreme
and preclude it from being used for any indications unless it is demonstrated to have a
novel, necessary, and irreplaceable benefit. Those side effects include a resulting body
odor that has been described as "room-clearing" by caretakers of cystinosis patients,
vomiting, nausea, and other pains and discomforts. Pediatric patients frequently go out of
their way to avoid taking pills (even disposing of them to avoid parental scrutiny) because
of these side effects, despite the fact that not taking the medication significantly shortens
their life expectancy. In addition, the reported negative side effects were nearly three times
more frequent for patients taking RP103 (Procysbi) than for regular cysteamine. RPTP's
pipeline includes the following:


a. RPTP is testing RP103 (enteric-coated cysteamine microspheres within a capsule,
already FDA-approved for cystinosis and marketed as Procysbi) to treat Huntington's
Disease because it increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor ("BDNF") levels, and
investors are waiting for Phase 2 results from a study taking place in France. There has
been past speculation that increasing BDNF levels in Huntington's Disease patients would
be beneficial. The study commenced in October 2010 and was scheduled to last for 18
months, with potential for an additional 18 month extension. To date, no results have been
reported. However, it has been shown through another study completed in May 2011 that
BDNF levels are completely irrelevant for patients with Huntington's Disease,  making
RP103 useless even if RPTP's current study verifies its hypothesis. Further, SSRIs, of
which there are dozens of brands (such as Paxil, Zoloft, Luvox, etc.), have already been
proven to increase BDNF levels, without the negative side effects of cysteamine. Many
SSRIs are now off-patent and selling for less than $1/pill. Even if BDNF levels had been
determined to be significant for Huntington's Disease patients, there would be no market
for cysteamine


b. RPTP is also testing RP103 (enteric-coated cysteamine microspheres within a capsule)
to treat Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. RPTP's theory of why cysteamine would be
useful in treating the disease is that RP103 will produce glutathione as a by-product,
which would then improve the NAFLD condition. However, 1) glutathione has explicitly

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1663702-raptor-pharmaceutical-corporation-a-dose-of-reality-for-investors 11/20


been shown not to be impacted in patients with the disease (a 2007 study published by
Nara Medical University in Japan showed that glutathione levels were "similar" between
healthy volunteers and patients with NASH)  and 2) even if it were relevant, the result
can be replicated by purchasing glutathione's precursor as a cheap over-the-counter
supplement at a fraction of the cost of RP103 and without the horrendous side effects


c. RPTP's other indications (other than the above indications and cystinosis) for RP103
and RP104 (enteric-coated cysteamine tablets) and drug delivery systems are all
"preclinical" and have not proven any efficacy. Investors should recognize that cysteamine
as a medication does not involve sophisticated chemical reactions to produce a response.
It is an irreversible binding agent which binds to cystine and removes it from a person
(which helps cystinosis patients), and has been FDA-approved for nearly 20 years. If there
were other ailments which would benefit from the use of cysteamine, they almost certainly
would have been discovered by now. Further, cysteamine carries horrendous side effects
that have been well-documented in medical studies as well as by cystinosis patients and
caregivers-the only way it would be accepted as a treatment would be if there were no
other treatments that produced a comparable outcome. As such, we believe it is extremely
unlikely that cysteamine will be used to treat any other diseases


d. Convivia, RPTP's proposed treatment for Asian Flush, has been around for nearly 20
years and we believe it will never be approved or marketable in any market due to the fact
that, while preventing production of the acetaldehyde, it also prevents the breakdown of
ethanol and could lead to serious bodily harm, coma, or death. We believe its position as
a drug to be used for recreational purposes with steep consequences will prevent it from
ever being approved by any responsible drug oversight commission. RPTP announced an
"exclusive agreement" with Uni Pharma to develop and commercialize Convivia in 2010
with no subsequent developments

What he forgot to say was.... Cystagon has to be taken every 6 hours. Now couple this with the fact that most patients
are diagnosed within the 1st year of life and you can see the serious limitations. of giving it to a 1-year-old Not
surprisingly, the disease is not controlled effectively by Cystagon in 80% of patients, putting their kidneys and other
major organs at risk. Procysbi allows parents to open the capsules for the infant and sprinkle it on baby food
(applesauce was used in the extension study and showed bioequivalence with the capsule) or when older it can be
simply taken whole. The coating means the drug does not smell or taste bad, regardless of the cherry-picked
quotes.... But as Raptor investors know Procysbi is the side-show, the funding for its pipeline for which the size of the
market is huge. RP103 is also in development for Huntington's disease, where cystine also plays a role. Huntington's
is a horrible genetic neurodegenerative disease resulting in death within 15-20 years of symptom onset. There are no
therapies available to slow the disease. RP103 is currently in a phase 2/3 trial. Interestingly, the French government is
funding the clinical expenses, so financially it's a low risk study. The results are not out but the author has already
condemned it citing a different study with a link (no.21 which unsurprisingly doesn't work) which is ridiculous.... The
company estimates the market potential for this indication at over $2 billion.


RP104 is in development for non-alcoholic streatohepatitis, a progressive inflammatory liver disease. If left untreated,
up to 25% patients progress to cirrhosis and increased risk of liver failure and liver cancer. There is currently no
approved treatment and the market is estimated by Raptor to be $2 billion in the U.S. alone.


A good day to pick up some shares....

Jason: 
Have you ever ingested cysteamine bitartrate? The side effects are the reason for the resistance to Cystagon
and will and are the same reason for the resistance to Procysbi. Putting an enteric coating on a horrible drug
doesn't solve that basic problem. The smell patients are complaining about is what is expelled after the drug
is ingested. It is the basic reason NO ONE would ever take this drug regardless of how it was dressed, for
any disease not leading to death. The drug used to treat a Tylenol overdose has exactly the same problem.
You never give it to a patient unless you are convinced the overdose they took is large enough to wipe out
their liver. No one has effectively been able to solve that basic problem by formulation.


BDGF is affected by an number of medications, and so cysteamine bitartate will never be the drug of choice
to enhance BDGF levels in Huntington's Disease. Patients can't stand the drug when they have to take it. If
they don't have to take it, they won't.


A fatty liver is common in patients who drink alcohol, only some of whom will go on to get a cirrhotic liver. Do
you honestly think an alcoholic who isn't willing to stop drinking alcohol would willingly ingest a horrible drug
with these kinds of side effects? It helps to be realistic when investing, but if you don't mind investing with the
belief the sky is the limit, I say go for it!

Author’s reply »  Jason,


Thank you for your response. We appreciate you taking the time to comment, and would like to take to clarify
each of the issues you raised.


First, while the powder likely does taste awful, many young patients who are unable to reliably swallow pills
(<6 year old) have gastronomy tubes to avoid dealing with that. That is how they have successfully been able
to take Cystagon in the past. The medicine is inserted via a small tube surgically inserted through the
patient’s abdomen. This is not rare among young pediatric patients with conditions that require constant
dosing. We also note that Procysbi has not been FDA-approved for patients under six years old, although a
doctor can always choose to overrule the FDA there (though the lack of approval would likely give insurance
companies even more pause about covering the drug for that particular patient).


The real concern with Procysbi isn’t the smell of the drug—it’s the smell emanating from patients after taking
the drug (along with other negative side effects). The quotes we included in the report were not cherry-picked,
and the clinical results from RPTP’s own Phase 3 trials (where negative side effects increased by nearly 3x
among users on Procysbi compared to Cystagon) speak for themselves. There were some positive
comments on the Facebook page regarding the fact that Procysbi only needs to be taken twice a day, but that
is the only benefit to patients, and similar to the first quote included in our report (repasted below), those
comments frequently devolved into complaints about the worsened side effects:


"So here is a thought...Procysbi is awesome! It allows us to sleep through the night and live less by the clock.
However, the odor that emanates from her breath and body is far worse and for far longer than [C]ystagon
(Kacy had virtually no odor). I worry about this socially."


It is true we only included five complaints, but keep in mind that RPTP reported in its Q2 conference call that
it had only shipped 49 prescriptions as of August 2, 2013. The complaints are snowballing: here are additional
quotes that we did not include in the report that have been posted on the Facebook group within the last two
days:


“I'm hoping to get some advice on the odor with procysbi. Kathleen never really had a problem when on
cystagon, it was always very mild. She was started on 750mg of procysbi twice daily which she tolerated well
and we did not notice any odor at all. They wanted to increase her to 1110 mg of procysbi twice daily but she
did not tolerate it at all. She seems to be tolerating 975mg well enough but the smell is really significant. I just
don't think it is fair to send her to school (a new school) having to deal with the odor. We just bought some
chlorofresh to try but wondering when it is recommended to give it? She takes procysbi at 6am and
6pm...should I give it with the procysbi or a few hours later when the smell gets bad? Is one tablet twice a day
of the chlorofresh enough? Thx.”


“hi liz! we are having the same problems with john ben and ava. Ava threw up all over the lunch table on the
first day of school and had to come home. John Ben gets sick during the night and during the day. He has

missed so many of his classes already. The odor is so much worse than cystagon. I will try the Chlorfresh, but
maybe just straight cholorphyll would be better? hope you are all well....best- kim”


“For kids odor is much worse and lasts all day too on 12hr. Our son is worse though which is weird it used to
be opposite and headaches/bellyaches still issue for both. We will be starting chlorofresh etc.  
Anyone else have issue with headaches after taking meds? They don't have PTC either. I know its the
cysteamine.”


“Brittany Laura had a horrible time with the new drug, I hope it gets better for you all”


“Brittney, someone in the adult group said he started getting migraines after starting Procysbi.”


“Our Oliver (aged 22) never had nausea with Cystagon, but has had nausea with Proscysbi. He is supposed
to be on 15 tabs morning and night but his stomach can't tolerate more than 12. He started on only 10 tabs
per dose and his first WBC labs were pretty good. 1.29.”


For publicly accessible complaints, we think this represents an unusually large portion of total customers. We
encourage you to join the Facebook group and see for yourself: http://on.fb.me/1cp2Rrr.


Finally, we also encourage you to review the points we made regarding RPTP’s pipeline. Bentio is right on the
mark—as we stated, RPTP believes that Procysbi can be used to treat Huntington’s Disease due to
increasing BDNF levels. This is based on past speculation that increasing BDNF levels would help
Huntington’s Disease patients. However, it has been shown that BDNF levels are not different between
normal people and HD patients. We apologize about the link—it must have been lost in translation when we
converted to the Seeking Alpha format. Here it is: http://bit.ly/1cp2Q71. Relevant quote:


“We found that BDNF protein levels were not reliably different between groups, whether measured in plasma
(52 controls, 26 preHD, 105 HD) or serum (39 controls, 5 preHD, 29 HD). Our experience, and a re-analysis
of the literature highlighted that intra-group variability and methodological aspects affect this measurement,
especially in serum. We also assessed BDNF mRNA levels in blood samples from 47 controls, 25 preHD, and
70 HD subjects, and found no differences among the groups. We concluded that levels of BDNF in human
blood were not informative (mRNA levels or plasma protein level) nor reliable (serum protein levels) as HD
biomarkers.”


Further, even if BDNF levels were a reliable biomarker, there are dozens of drugs that increase BDNF levels,
including numerous antidepressants, many of which are off-patent, sell for <$1/pill, and don’t carry the side
effects of Procysbi. Here is a link to a website that contains a list of around 30 drugs that improve BDNF
levels in patients and contains links to the relevant studies showing that each of those drugs


Regarding NASH, the proposed benefit from taking cysteamine would be increased glutathione levels.
However, 1) glutathione has been explicitly shown not to be impacted by NASH (see link:
http://1.usa.gov/1cp2Rrz) and 2) even if it were relevant to NASH patients, taking cysteamine is an overly
burdensome route to reach that endpoint— to reiterate, the side effects from taking cysteamine (Procysbi or
Cystagon) are horrendous. Patient compliance is mediocre even among cystinosis patients who will die
without proper treatment. Glutathione is an over-the-counter supplement available for cheap:
http://bit.ly/1cp2Q73. There is no circumstance where a doctor would prescribe Procysbi to increase a

patient’s glutathione levels. By the way, for NASH, there is a treatment—stop drinking and engage in diet and

Thanks for additional information from you Jason. Im long RPTP.


I think the author of this article never think about patients suffering from nephropathic cystinosis. 
Imagine you are the patient and need to take the medicine Cystagon strictly every 6hrly to treat nephropathic
cystinosis without failed.


Right now, RPTP comes out with their medicine PROCYSBI only need to take twice daily which reduce the patients
suffering for just to need to remember taking medication every 6hrly even in the middle of the night. 
I really hope RPTP's PROCYSBI can have more use in other medical condition in the future.

Is this Gravity the one that will draw their short portfolio to ground zero? 
Dear Gravity, only another 2 months of pain, till the next quarterly call. R will announce outstanding figures, far ahead
the initial forecast and they will probably start 2014 with the portfolio for usd 100 m sales next year 
And your shorts will be destroyed. Very happy to know that your squeeze will add to the uptrend in the coming

My question is, why wud an insurance company agree to pay (and some have per the q2 report) $250k/year for a
patient on RP103? Why not simply refuse? Why not say "we'll cover it, but at a lower price"? Say $20k/patient/year.


If an insurance company agrees to pay $250k/year/patient that increases their expenses. In order to maintain the
same profit level they need to charge more to their subscribers

Did any of you read the full report, or just comment based on your beliefs? I read the whole report and I was
convinced anyone long on this stock is a fool. I don't know if the stock is worth $4 or $8/share, but $12-$15, no way.


Do any of you understand what a formulary is? When an insurance company decides what it will pay, it looks at where
the drug is in the formulary. Very expensive drugs that do the same thing as another drug either are placed in a higher
tier on the formulary (with less insurance support) or they are not placed in the formulary at all (and receive no
insurance support). If Raptor cannot get their product on the formularies they are not going to get their product
reimbursed by health insurance companies.


Actually, the claim Cystagon doesn't work or is unacceptable is not really true. Cystinosis leads to death by the teens
if untreated. Today, the oldest cystinosis patient is about 40 years old. Cystagon has been on the market about 20
years. There are real problems with cystinosis and cysteamine bitartrate is a horrible drug to take. But putting it in a
enteric formulation doesn't solve the real problems and recent patient complaints (detailed in the report) suggest
Raptor has not been very forthright about those issues. This is just a couple months into launch when few people are
taking the Raptor product.


You go long on rptp if you like, but personally there seem to be real issues regarding future growth, product cost,
limitations to future earnings and product pipeline that have not been detailed before in any other report I have seen. I
have seen many small companies fly high only to fall on their face after reality set in. Does Dandrion or Affymetrix ring
any bells?

Interesting. Of the 1000's of trades today there were only 6 above 10,000 shares and they were a total of 80,000, and
all except 20,000 at the close which is typically a market maker working its inventory, 
46,000 were an up tick (price increase) which is likely a buy and 35,000 a down tick/sell. So there is nothing seemly
negative or positive happening with the majority, the "big guys".  
PS, As far as cost, 125 patients with high rates of morbidity who may be helped is not a far reach for even the most
evil actuary.


29 Aug 2013, 04:38 PM


HamburgerToday
The Author has a few problems with his thesis, most of which revolve around insurance. He obviously has a basic
understanding but not an in depth one.


Drugs do not need to be on a formulary for coverage. That's a simple fact. Utilization Management departments would
make decisions on a case by case basis.


A drug that isn't even on the market, won't be in formularies published in July unless there was an overriding reason
for the medical directors to have their staff research it starting 6 to 8 months earlier, during their normal annual cycle.
A brand new cure for cancer that really has real potential this time (instead of all the cancer cure pumps over the
years) might meet the criteria for a drug that is being anxiously awaited and therefore on people's radar well ahead of
time.


Medicare and Medicaid are usually the last to include them in formularies although that is also starting to change with
Obamacare.


Speaking of Obamacare, those 35 million people the author claims would need $250k for the drug because they are
uninsured will actually have coverage available to them in October of this year.


The Author also fails to recognize that every company with an expensive drug has a free drug program for poor
people. Heck they kind of have to, just to get Mediciad to accept their innovator status for the 23.1% reimbursement
rate vs the 100%, right?


There is much more missed, forgotten, or misleading statements regarding the healthcare insurance industry but
based on what I read, I chalk it up to the Author not actually knowing these things because he never worked in the
industry or close to it.


All that being said, I tend to agree with the conclusion the company is hard to value. Not sure why the Author then
established a value of $4? If you can't value it, you can't...


For this company to truly be worth anything, the drug would have to really be effective in cases the other is not. My
research doesn't indicate a UM review would come up with a rationale. So therefore I can't value the drug at all.
Maybe I simply don't understand this particular disease and drug though. I'll give longs the benefit of the doubt on
that. This disease isn't in my area.


So I have no position long or short but did want to point out the author needs to research the healthcare industry
much better before making such bold statements.

There should be concerns about differences between what the company is reporting and the reality of the
marketplace.. Getting approval and working out a payment method for a drug off formulary is far more difficult
than getting approval for a drug on formulary. Even if the insurance company decides to pay, they will likely
assign significant co-pay to the patient once they know the exact same drug is on the market in a different
formulation. Assessments that ignore that real risk to the market share are faulty.


Analysts estimates of Procysbi taking the entire cystinosis market appear premature. Payment for this drug is
well in excess of Cystagon which will (not might) meet with substantial resistance from payer's, including
Medicare and Medicaid. This also has not been considered by analysts.


The significant delay between physician prescription, approval and shipping is reflective of that cost
resistance. It will be even worse in Europe where universal health care is the norm, not the exception.


The company got approval from the FDA not by showing its drug was better than Cystagon, but by showing
its drug was equally effective to Cystagon in terms of drug bioavailability and exposure. The question is, "How
will Raptor ever show the same drug with equivalent drug bioavailability on a per gram basis is better than the
exact same drug in a different formulation?" That said, how is Raptor going to justify its 25 fold greater price,
and what health insurance would willing pay it without that proof? If Raptor cannot make a dent in this market,
how will it make a dent in any other market with a drug that has such horrible side effects the only people
even willing to take it are those who would die without it?


I'm not a financial analyst, but one doesn't have to be to understand when someone is selling a pig with
lipstick. I'm just amazed Raptor has gotten this far and to this degree of promotion without being seriously
questioned by people who should understand how to fairly evaluate its risk. Clearly, I was mistaken.

Cystinosis Family
Cystinosis is a horrific disease that destroys every cell in the body and affects every organ. Taking cystagon every 6
hours is almost impossible and because of that compliance is low and patients die at an average age of 27/28 years
old. Any improvement in treatment is heralded. The author cites one organization's FB page as authoritative which is
a mistake. He cites several negative comments by family members and/or patients without doing any research or
asking any questions to verify the statements. Just to clarify - the mother who wrote that her son threw the medicine
out because he couldn't tolerate it...she was referring to her child's inability to tolerate cystagon, not Procysbi. And the
other mother who talked about her child throwing up - her child has never taken Procysbi/RP103!. The author should
have done real research if he was truly interested in what the community feels about Procysbi. Odor is an issue
whether for cystagon or Procysbi - it is a horrible side effect but personally, I would rather my child have the horrible

smell twice a day versus four times a day. The author cited additional comments from the same FB page (by the way,
the page is a closed group so how did the author access the site?). There are pages of wonderful comments on open
forums about Procysbi - I wonder why the author failed to cite those comments? Titrating the dose does not mean that
Procysbi does not work, it means the dose has to be adjusted so that the patient can tolerate the drug - we learn from
each other. It has always been true that if the odor is really strong, the dose should be lowered. Since Procysbi is a
delayed-release medication, there is naturally some dosing issues initially. The other outrageous comment pertains to
the author's comparison of the number of patients in the Raptor study (43) vs the Sigma Tau study (300). The Sigma
Tau study was done in partnership with the NIH. The NIH is the hub of care for cystinosis patients so when patients
are seen at the NIH, they are seen at the NIH eye institute. The eye study is simple and merely involved an eye exam,
keeping a log of the dosing schedule and follow up visits. No blood draws, hospital stays, etc. The most significant
difference between the Raptor and Sigma Tau studies is the number of years each study lasted. The Sigma-Tau study
took over 20 years! It took 20 years before the drug was finally and thankfully approved last year. The only way we
could get the eye drops was to be part of the study! The two drugs and their road to approval and patient involvement
cannot be compared. As a community, we do not applaud the cost of the new drug but what we know is that it is life
changing for our patients. Like any drug, some people may not tolerate it but most will and for the first time in their
lives, our patients will be able to sleep through the night. For patients, improvement of quality of life is paramount until
we find the cure. It is a shame that the author did not seek out other cystinosis sites to balance out his analysis - he
counted on random comments made on a private FB site and made assumptions about the commentators.
