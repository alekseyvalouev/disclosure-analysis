Travelling through China with the Universal Travel Group:
fly from Beijing to Yichang – pick up your tickets at
Shenzhen airport!
I am close friends with the major investor in a small but well placed online travel business. If you ever
need a modestly priced hotel in Australia by far the best site is www.checkin.com.au. It does not have
the best range – but it fulfils the function of the discounter – running on the thinnest margin and being
a place where hotels can (quietly) shift their excess inventory. If you want a business hotel in Sydney
don't bother with anything else – checkin.com.au is the best deal. If you want a romantic getaway in
the Blue Mountains there are plenty of other suggestions though you might get lucky with the
discounter.


Travel booking companies have – for the reasons stated above – interested me. And – being in my
business – I like a cheap stock.


So a fast growing online hotel and airline booking company in China trading at a PE ratio of about 5
caught my eye. I can't resist a bargain.  Here is the company description from the footer of their press
releases.


Universal Travel Group is a leading travel services provider in China offering package
tours, air ticketing, and hotel reservation services via the Internet and customer service
representatives. The Company also operates TRIPEASY Kiosks, which are placed in
shopping malls, office buildings, residential apartment buildings, and tourist sites. These
kiosks are designed for travel booking with credit and bank cards, and serve as an
advertising platform for Universal Travel Group. The Company's headquarters and main
base of operations is in Shenzhen in the Pearl River Delta region of China. More
recently, Universal Travel Group has expanded its business into Western China,
opening a second home base in the Chongqing Delta region, and other attractive,
under-penetrated tier-two travel markets throughout the country. For more information
on the Company, please visit http://us.cnutg.com .


But we at Bronte insist on at least some due-diligence and so we spent some time fiddling about in
their website. I will cut to the chase. We will not be buying the stock.  Too Jabberwocky for us.


Background: the claims made by Universal Travel Group


The Universal Travel Group (NYSE:UTA) is a consolidation of small-scale travel agents and group
tour companies in China. None of these are very attractive as a stock investment. The real appeal is
in an online-booking travel company that company presentations compare to Priceline, Expedia and
CTrip.  (CTrip is the dominant Chinese online-booking service. It trades on the Nasdaq, has a market
capitalization just below $6 billion and has a price-earnings ratio just above 50.)


The UTA website gives a business description. I have included in here the screen-shots from the
website in case the websites change in response to this blog. Here is the screen-shot.

I should quote this because it is worth coming back to. They claim to have “convenient online
payments”, “more than 170 countries overseas, more than 30,000 hotels”, “more than 200
professional staff”, “over 300 UTG customer representatives across the country ready to provide 24/7
service”, “primary agent of domestic and international airlines” and an “IT Team … composed of
specialists from all across the world [which] includes experts who specialize in customer management
systems, call center system, order processing system, air ticket reservation system and service
quality monitoring system. With over 5 years experience in e-development, they will ensure your
experience goes smoothly and efficiently.”


This sounds – at least by this description – as a competent standard hotel-and-flight booking engine.
The website you see above is a little strange because it does not have a tab to book cars and on a
business trip I normally take a car – but that seems a small omission. [CTrip does have a car-tab on
their website but it is small and you discover that all rental cars include a driver which is probably a
necessity for a gweilo like me driving in China.]


So far – so good.


Alas when you start to use this site you wind up going down a rabbit hole of Lewis Carroll proportions.


Trying to book a flight: Beijing to Yichang


I most certainly was not going to buy an online travel company without checking out their IT – and
what better way to do that than by using it.


Fortunately UTA has an English language travel booking site (http://en.cnutg.com/). On it I tried to
book a one-way flight from Beijing to Yichang. That is a trip I made largely by rail in the early 1980s
which was – I can assure you – a different time in China.  Anyway fairly quickly it gave me three
options. A screen-shot is here.

This is fairly convincing. They are the same flights that I found when I did the same search on
CTrip.com. Indeed the prices were identical – and the main advantage of CTrip was that it also told
me the pricing on alternate days in a neat graphical format. CTrip also gave me some neater phone
options – including skype.


There were some oddities – the site had no box (pop-up or otherwise) which explained ticket
conditions. You did not know whether these were non-refundable tickets or whether flight times could
be changed and under what terms. Those conditions were clearly available on CTrip.


This gets really surreal when you try to actually book one of these flights. Here is what happens when
I try to book a ticket on flight CA1823 on Universal Travel Group's website. First I get taken to a page
where it asks me to identify myself by passport or ID card. I chose an Australian passport (but used a
fake number). It also asked me how I wanted to pick up the ticket: at the company, the airport or
onsite delivery. I chose the airport. It gives me a payment option – being cash or credit. The screen-
shot is below.

Now there are again some odd things about this – most notably the airport address they want me to
pick the ticket up at. It is Counter 42, 43 Terminal B, Bao'an International Airport, Shenzhen. Now
remember I am booking flight from BEIJING to YICHANG. There is no indication that I will ever be in
Shenzhen. It is 1200 miles from Beijing to Shenzhen – it might be a little out of my way to collect the
ticket. In the American context this is like flying from New York to Greensboro North Carolina and
being asked to pick up the ticket in Miami.


We did the same search in Chinese and we got the same bizarre result.


By contrast – when I did the booking button on CTrip.com it made me register as a customer – and
then took me to a much more sensible page with options to give addresses and mobiles both inside
and outside China and with payment options including credit cards and Paypal. It also had highly
sensible pop-up boxes which told me the conditions of the ticket (for instance under what terms I
could change my flight times).


But – just to be convinced – I needed to see whether I could book a ticket for delivery at an airport
1200miles from my starting airport. So I tried it using the cash booking option. It would let me – but
when I finally pressed finish it gave me this auto-generated page:

Being a sucker for punishment I translated the Chinese and found a standard set of error codes. I got
the same when I tried to buy with credit – and at no stage was I given a box to put my credit card in or
a link to Paypal.  I did these screenshots using chrome browser. I reproduced them all except the
above error using Firefox.  In Chinese I gather there is slightly more browser-choice instability.


Ok – it looks like this travel site is all front-end, no-back end – there is no actual booking, no
mechanism of collecting payment – no nothing really.


The company in its stock-promotion spiel says that it allows for “convenient online payments” but
there was no mechanism here for making any payment. In this day-and-age it is not difficult to take
PayPal. That payment option can be set up very quickly.


Could all this be just because we are doing this in English and this is a Chinese company?


By this stage we wondered if we were going insane – was this a real company at all? We had a friend
repeat precisely this experiment in Hanji. His results differed in one important way – which is when
you actually gave a phone number and confirmed a booking they said a consultant would ring you
back.

Also – the prices were consistently 2 percent cheaper than if you were querying in English.  Finally –
and this was to my view key – there was a SKYPE ME button just like on CTrip.Com.  You could not
pay online – but this was lead generation for an off-line travel company.  There was something there –
it just wasn’t “instant reservations” and “convenient online payments”.


Note: no international airlines


There is one more strange thing about this website – there is no opportunity to book international
flights.  The web page pictured above however describes the company as a Primary Agent for
international airlines.


Hotels


The bit of this business I have thought most about is hotel booking. That is my close friend's business.
If a Chinese travel company is compiling inventory in foreign hotels they must be obtaining that
inventory from someone. I thought I might book a hotel near home and check the company that way.
Fortunately on the front page they had an “International Hotels” option. I thought I might book
something in Sydney and take my wife somewhere nice. And having done that I might even work out
whose inventory they were selling. (That would be of interest to my friend's business – which is after
all – a business of sourcing and trading in hotel inventory.)


Here is the International Hotel booking page.

Ok – so I tried to pick a Sydney hotel for next Friday night – which seems like a nice time to take my
wife out. Alas my precious darling will be disappointed. They do not have a hotel in Sydney that night.
Nor any other night I tried.


So let’s try somewhere else – how about New York, NY? Same result.


But if you look at the site it advertises rooms at St Giles The Tuscany – which is a quite nice hotel in
New York – so I pressed that link.


It brings up something that looks like the right hotel (albeit with a bad and blurry photo). But the
buttons that say “hotel description” or even the button that says “book” do not work. Here is a screen-
shot.



http://lh3.ggpht.com/_AL2FXcy6tvw/TJBQJjqUVVI/AAAAAAAAB7c/Ku7KOQo9GqQ/s1600-h/clip_image010%5B1%5D.jpg

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/travelling-through-china-with-universal.html 8/24


I am inquiring to book a hotel. I have got to the right page – and – yes – the button that says “book”
does not work. Have you ever known a shop that will show you all the inventory but not let you buy?


But it is worse than that – I tried half a dozen other hotels that they advertised on the left hand side of
their page.  Every time it bought up the same indistinct photo.  All the hotels were identical.  I know
that one business hotel is more or less like another and when you are cocooned in one it does not
matter whether you are in Auckland or Helsinki – but this is ridiculous.  The photos were literally
identical.  No wonder the picture naming the hotel is blurred.


We did the same queries in Chinese and found the same thing… for instance we were unable to find
any hotels in Sydney or New York on any night we tried.


Maps


The website has a maps tab.  This is a really useful feature for a travel booking company because
you can make a lot of money booking travel at short notice to people on the road.  I wanted to fiddle
with that.  Alas it did not work – it mapped a small area around Shenzen – which is not much use
picking a hotel in Yichang. 


But it was far worse than that – the website was far-from-optimized for use on a mobile phone
(running on an iPhone it produced two error codes in presentation which the iPhone asked if I wanted
to ignore).  This is serious for a travel website which people often want to refer to on the road.  It is
doubly serious for a travel website in China because in China more than most places people interact
with the internet through their phone.  


Talking about phones


Well I thought that maybe their website was dysfunctional – but at least I might be able to book on the
phone. There was a phone number (400 888 9966). I rang it using the trusty Google Voice which
would have represented me as ringing from within China. There was a message to press “6” for
English – which I pressed – and then they fed me through an endless Chinese menu. I pushed
buttons at random and was left on music on which I waited for 30 minutes.


I figured I needed a Chinese speaker to do this – so my friend came to my rescue.  After some
dropped lines and the like he found that – underlying this and at the other end of the phone was a real
travel agency.  You could book both domestic and international flights on the phone.  Indeed the
website has an international flights tab in Chinese – and when you get through to the booking screen
they indicate that they will phone you.  Do not think for a minute that this company is entirely fictional



http://lh5.ggpht.com/_AL2FXcy6tvw/TJBQRy2NG3I/AAAAAAAAB7s/RgrgvZdgkNU/s1600-h/clip_image012%5B2%5D.jpg

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/travelling-through-china-with-universal.html 9/24


– we are sure that there is a travel agency underlying this company but it is not an internet travel
agency with “air ticketing and hotel reservations via the internet”.  It is an old – limited dial up travel
agency – precisely the type that is being disintermediated by the CTrips and Pricelines of the world. 


The phone was answered in Cantonese. This company purports to be a nation-wide service and my
friend expected a conversation in Mandarin. When my friend was talking in Mandarin the conversation
changed.  If this were a national company (as it purports to be) it would have answered in Mandarin.


By this stage I was more than a little intrigued by this company. I dug around their website a little
further – and found beta versions of their website. One site was even labeled as such – it was
http://beta.cnutg.com/ . Here is a screen-shot of that page.





The copyright date at the bottom (2009) suggest this was not done very long ago. The page itself is
sketchy and dysfunctional. The bookings tend to go nowhere (surprise) and the English language tab
does not work at all.


Customer Management


This company claims it has IT experts who specialize in customer management systems.  They too
are strangely missing.  For instance in the main website in the top corner are four options - “Sign In”,
“Register Now”, “Order Management” and “My Account”. They lead to the same page – so there is
really no distinction between them. Once you sign in there is no “Order Management” because they
are as noted unable to take an order. But before that there is something which stands out like a sore-
thumb. There is no “forgot my password” option. The cookies on the site do not remember your ID.
(CTrip remembers your ID and remembering your ID is key to getting repeat business.)


My travel-business entrepreneur friend will tell you that repeat business is the key to profitability in
one of these travel booking businesses because the customer acquisition is very expensive. Google
(or in China Baidu) really do take their cut as key words are very expensive in travel. This company
has not even got the basics of customer retention right.


But I want to bring you back to core claims of the company which I repeated above. They described
their “IT Team … composed of specialists from all across the world [which] includes experts who
specialize in customer management systems, call center system, order processing system, air ticket
reservation system and service quality monitoring system. With over 5 years experience in e-
development, they will ensure your experience goes smoothly and efficiently.”


Now look at their English Language IR site

The business behind this can't book any travel on any website we found. 


According to the investor relations website the core business of Universal Travel Group (the flight
booking service) apparently has 248 employees at the end of 2007 and presumably many more now
as they have (at least according to the accounts) grown like a weed.  For starters I will stick with 248
as a minimum number. Here is the website screen-shot.





The woman sitting in the center is the CEO/Founder – her name is Ms. Jiangping Jiang and strangely
for a hyper-successful travel executive she speaks no English.  That said – the text here says that
they have entered into sale agent agreements with all the domestic airline companies and “over 30
international airline companies”.


UTA is – according to their (stock) promotion the fastest developing air-tickets agency in the domestic
civil aviation industry...


It all looks very professional but only at first glance…


The NYSE drops its guard


I would not be surprised if this stock were listed on the Pink Sheets or even the AMEX. This sort of
stuff you can find on the UK's AIM board – but the New York Stock Exchange is special.  They have
higher standards!  To date the SEC has only forcedly delisted a single NYSE listed company for fraud
– and that was ACLN.

The NYSE must be pretty sure of itself.  UTA has received one of the highest honors in capitalism...
they opened the floor of the NYSE.  It is an honor I doubt will ever be bestowed on me. 








How the company represents all of this in their accounts


By my reckoning this is a company where you can almost not bother looking at the accounts – you
could short it off the website.  But – being an accounting junky I am going to look at the accounts
anyway.


First I want to look at the 10K. There they break down the business by section -


You can see why the stock is sold on the Air-tickets and Hotel booking business. Air-tickets it seems
have an 84 percent gross margin. Hotel bookings a 67 percent margin. Tours have a 13 percent gross
margin.


There is one thing which jumps out like a sore thumb in this table - and that is there is no elimination
line in the revenue break-down. Surely the Tours business buys stuff from the air-tickets or hotel
businesses? 


That lack of an elimination line is enough to question the company’s accounting.  If they don’t trade
with each other at all then they do not belong together – and there is no reason to have them within
one corporate structure.


However I am less concerned with the revenue line than with the cost line.  Look at the cost of
services in the air-tickets and hotel business. The air ticket business had cost of services of 2.7 million
dollars – and this is for a business that claims to have 24/7 offices all over China, delivery in over 50
cities and an IT Team of specialists across the world.


The company fortunately even gives us a break-down of costs in various sections.

This global team of IT and CRM specialists comes cheap – website maintenance for the core airline
booking company comes to $44 thousand. No website maintenance is listed for the hotel business at
all.


It is of course consistent with my discoveries about the website.  There is no functional website, no
booking system, no payment system, no international airline tab except in Chinese, no rental car tab,
and photos of all the international hotels being identical. 


As it is impossible to pay (despite them claiming “convenient online payments”) it is likely that there is
no substantial revenue in that business. 


The company is however not entirely fictional – there was a real kiosk travel business – and there is
an underlying travel agency. 


The company claims in its core business to have 248 employees at YZL as of the end of 2007 – but
given growth and acquisitions that number has grown.  This business claims staff costs of  $436
thousand.  That is about $1800 per person per year using the low 248 employees number.  This
business would normally include some IT staff and other above-average wage earners – indeed one
of the slides above says that the hotel booking business has “over 200 professional staff”.  The
minimum wage in Shenzen is 1100 Remimbi per month which is $162 per month or $1940 per year. 
At a first cut this company is paying under minimum wages.  In the claims at the top of this post they
claim over 300 UTG customer representatives in just the call center.  I guess a lot of people might be
part time and there are very few higher-wage staff such as IT workers.  But whatever – either they
don’t have the staff or they are very lowly paid or the accounts are wrong. 


Total salaries are just over $500 thousand – and the company has claimed to have IT staff around the
world, a 300 seat call center and over 200 professional staff. 


The company also claims to have telecommunications expense of about $75 thousand annually.  With
over 300 people in the call center (as per their stock promotion quoted above) these call centers
would be the cheapest in the world to run bar none.


However here I am comparing the salary bill to minimum wages.  A quick Google search tells you that
sales managers in Shenzhen are very highly paid by Chinese standards.  Here is an article from 2007
that suggests the average salary for a Shenzhen sales manager is over USD40 thousand.  There has

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/travelling-through-china-with-universal.html 13/24


been wage inflation in Shenzhen since then.  Average salaries in Shenzhen are only a fraction of
those lofty levels but still roughly 4 times minimum wage.  It seems impossible that there is a 300
person telephone center function here at those salaries and the cost base detailed in the annual
financials – however I can only point out inconsistencies – I cannot verify whether the annual filing
(10K) or the 300 person phone center statement is correct.


But hey – I am being kind to them.  I am using the end 2007 employee numbers.  The 10K has the
following employee disclosure:


Employees


At the current time, including our officers, we have approximately 780 full-time
employees, including 80 administrative employees, 200 marketing employees and
approximately 500 employees working at our three call centers. None of our employees
is a member of a union and our relationships with our employees are generally
satisfactory. In accordance with Chinese Labor Law, we provide social security and
medical insurance to all our employees.


Total staff and salaries costs are – as I noted – just over $500 thousand.  And for that money – less
than $700 an employee per year – they not only pay them but they provide social security and
medical insurance.  (I don’t think I need to go through the proxy, work out costs of the executive staff
and hence – by subtraction – work out the costs of the non executive staff.  If you do it though you will
conclude that – if there really are almost 780 non-executives and they are only paid that then they
must have a truly miserable existence.  Whatever – it is unlikely that their relationships with “780
employees” at that total staff cost would be “satisfactory”.)


Thinking about the costs from a business perspective


I want to think about these costs from a business perspective. There is almost no customer
acquisition cost in the accounts. In this business getting customers in is really expensive. Travel
related click fees are amongst the most expensive clicks on Google – and I presume that they are on
Baidu too. Indeed in a thin-margin business like www.checkin.com.au if you aggressively seek
additional customers you grow quite nicely but eventually with negative margins. You will make
money only if the customers return and book more flights/hotels without paying additional click fees to
Google. This is a company that – at least in its accounts – is growing like a weed with zero customer
acquisition expenses – and with an entirely dysfunctional website.


Is there any case for owing this stock at any price above zero? 


I want to head this one off at the pass. It is pretty clear from this analysis that the main reason for
owning the stock of Universal Travel Group is dubious. The online booking engine is dysfunctional  –
and the massive margins that it claims (84 percent for plane tickets) are thus also dubious.


All the profits that the company claimed it made out of the travel booking business (by far the bulk of
its claimed profits) are similarly dubious – though there is a real travel company which might be
making some profits.


The company claims in its most recent quarterly balance sheet to be carrying 43 million in cash and
accounts receivable of almost 20 million. If the airline and hotel business are dubious then the profits
generated that cash are dubious. In that case the cash itself is dubious.


I know people will buy this as Ben Graham net-net stock if it collapses. Unless this company can get a
big four audit firm to sign-off for them I think you can – at least for the moment question the entire
balance sheet. They have however just appointed a new auditor. I quote the press release: the Board
of Directors, in consultation with its Audit Committee, has appointed Goldman Kurland Mohidin
("GKM") as the Company's independent auditor to replace Acquavella, Chiarelli, Shuster, Berkower &
Co., LLP, effective September 1, 2010. I don't know who GKM are – and I will be thrilled if any of my
readers can – off the top of their head – name three other companies they audit.  Whatever: I think
that GKM can take it as read that this is a higher-than-normal-risk audit assignment. And the first thing
to do – confirm the existence of that $43 million cash stash.


How the company is behaving?


The company is not behaving as if this is a cash rich company. The company has one real business –
1523 travel kiosks which appear in company promotional literature as electronic booths. I think this
was (at least at one stage) a real travel booking business and remains one albeit off the internet.  The
kiosks were places that people without a computer or phone could book travel online using a touch
screen. I have not seen any of these kiosks but have spoken to people who have. They just sold them
for 40 million CNY – or about $5 million. They proudly note however that they get to keep the travel-
related revenue from these kiosks for the next two years. As this was the foundation business for the
company it seems unlikely they would sell it especially as the accounts suggest they are awash with
cash.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/travelling-through-china-with-universal.html 14/24


They did not announce whether they had a gain or loss on the sale of that business – but someone I
know was told (last year) by the company that the cost base of these kiosks was about $6000 each.
On those figures they are taking a largish loss. This is not the behavior of a company with a strong
business swimming in cash.


The company has however been buying other businesses – such as a hotel booking business in
Chonquing. But the other company websites including this one http://www.cba-hotel.com/ have –
when worked on – a similar Alice-in-Wonderland character. That site produces similar errors when it
gets around to payment time. It is however browser sensitive.  If you use Firefox or Microsoft Internet
Explorer you wind up at pages which are gibberish – not even recognizable Chinese. (I relied on
Chinese friends to tell me that though – I can't tell the real Chinese from the gibberish Chinese.) 
Whatever browser you use you wind up with the strange inability to book anything. 


The CBA-hotels.com site however does have a forgotten password option – they will text your
password to your mobile phone.  If someone has a Chinese mobile phone I would love them to test
that.


Still – other people have a different impression of this website.  One broker (Emissary Capital) report
described this website as follows:


In August 8, 2007, UTG acquired Shanghai Lanbao Travel Service Company Limited, a
centralized real-time booking system that provides consumers and travel related
businesses with hotel booking services via the internet and mobile phone text-
messages. The company owns and manages the award winning China Booking
Association website, http://www.cba-hotel.com/, which receives approximately 200,000
visitors daily. The network is open to more than 200,000 hotels, 5,000 booking centers
and 8,000 travel agencies and tourist companies throughout China. Its intra-hotel
network includes more than 3,000 franchise hotels and 800 hotel booking businesses
and agencies across China. The company’s China Booking Association website,
http://www.cba-hotel.com, receives about 200,000 visitors daily and, in 2006, made
about 500,000 hotel reservations.


Maybe the good analyst at Emissary had a different experience on the website to us.  They paid cash
and stock for that business.  The stock I presume has found its way to the NYSE and hence to retail
and institutional investors in America.


Did we find that there was anything real about the company in our investigation?


Yes. There are non-fictional elements here. As far as we can tell the company really does run tours.
The margins for this tour business are higher than most tour businesses report – and given the
accounts are clearly more generally questionable I would not put much store in its value – but there is
some value here. 


More to the point there is a real telephone based travel agent here – one that does not present as a
national agent (the phone is answered in Cantonese).  But as there is a travel agent there will be
some sales. 


We also were surprised that some things we found on Google and Baidu in Chinese that were more
supportive of this company than most of this blog post. The company press released that it had
received some awards:


Universal Travel Group (NYSE:UTA) ("Universal Travel Group" or the "Company"), a
leading travel services provider in China offering package tours, air ticketing, and hotel
reservation services online and via customer service representatives, today announced
that it was presented with three awards at the 16th Annual Asian Tourism Golden Travel
Awards Ceremony, held in Beijing on August 29, 2010.


Universal Travel Group was honored with the Top Ten Golden Asian Travel Agency and
Top Rated Travel Agency in Greater China Award, and Ms. Jiangping Jiang, Chief
Executive Officer of UTA, received the Most Influential Figure in the Travel Industry in
Greater China Award.


"We are honored to receive these awards which recognize the strides we have made in
building a leading travel service business in China," stated Ms. Jiang. "We are
committed to providing excellent service and a wide variety of travel offerings to our
customers and look forward to continuing to expand our air ticketing, hotel reservation
and package tour business across China."


Now awards are – by their nature – public and tourism awards are doubly promoted – so we thought
we might find some references to these awards on the web. Alas – there is not a single reference in
Google to these awards without the word “universal” in it. A Google Search which insists on the
phrase “Annual Asian Tourism Golden Travel Awards” and the absence of the word “universal”
presents no results. We thought that the company might have made up the awards. But alas searches
using Chinese characters pulled up a few additional references. We can find a 16th annual award and

Relationship with Priceline


The company claims a relationship with Priceline in their conference call.  They claim that Priceline
entered this to strengthen their position in China – and that 8000 hotels will be available for online
booking through this relationship.  We have not found them. 


But then I encourage readers to fiddle with the website and see if you get something better.  And if
you are travelling in China and you want to use their services I would love to hear back from you.

John, 
 
Due diligence and the fascinating things that we discover. As someone who has looked at
deals in China and in these same sectors, I am not surprised.  
 
Background checks and accounting DD can throw even more funny stuff. Most HK and
NYSE listed Chinese companies employ offshore-onshore structure -- if one were lending
it could be a real problem to enforce as we would not have any recourse to the onshore
entity. 
 
This blog item brought back memories of sew such deals in this space. Fought one and
won, fought the other and lost --- and we invested in this. Only time will tell, but my gut
says that we'll get out at less than 50c to the $. 
 
In my experience I would say that there is little capital discipline in general in such
companies. And financial systems are weak at best.

What need is there for such a big accounts receivables line? In this sort of business, the
customer usually pays upfront and cash payment can't make up $20 million. There must
be a lot of tours going on! Wotif has receivables of $5.2 million, and it presumably does a
lot more business in terms of total transaction value (TTV). 
 
There's a rotten fish in there waiting to be found.

John Hempton is just like the other bloggers trying to take down chinese micros. No clue

Idiotic. Maybe John hacked UTA's website?

John, 
 
While your analysis is very detailed, I find it very odd that you did not contact the
company and pose these questions to them and post their responses as well. 
 
You provided a very one-sided view of UTA and I would like to see the other side of the
story. As a prudent investor, it is important to not only look at your allegations, but also
UTA's responses to your allegations. 
 
The fact that you did not give UTA a chance to respond or even make the aware of your
findings -- leads me to believe that you are merely advancing your own agenda against
UTA.  
 
So why DID you decide NOT to confront UTA with your questions or suspicions? Is it to
help increase the profits on your short position on UTA?

John, 
 
Great work. It's a shame that short-sellers are misunderstood. Shorts are amongst the
most skilled fundamentally oriented investors out there... period. To respond to another
comment, John has no duty to confront management. He (1) made a full disclosure of his
position, (2) his facts and analysis are reasonable as well as thorough. Owners of this
stock should have exercised the same discretion as John has in doing this public service.

Any experience traders and investors know fully well why you wrote the article which has

of fully understand the 10k is also evident. I did not see anywhere where you reach out to
the company and ask them questions(such as how salaries are paid). You also fail to
mention to the readers that you loaded up the puts on Monday before you posted your
finding on Wed. I do not own the stock but I found that you're unethical and have hurt a
lot of investors for your personal gain. I am pretty sure all this will be cleared out soon but
by then, you and your friends already banked it in. Great job. Mission accomplish.

John, their business isn't completely internet based obviously. How do you know how
their commission structure works btw? Maybe their customer service reps are paid on
commission depending on customer satisfaction. You don't understand their business;
perhaps it would have been wiser to ask the company before ripping them apart and
causing their stock to crash 25%.  
 
You defamed them and now they said they are looking for legal recourse. You either lied
or made a mistake by saying UTA's staff salaries are only 500k, when there was over
$1,000,000 paid in commission in the 3 months ending DEC 2009. Even if there is validity

in some of your claims the compensation part of your rant is erroneous. That is a big
problem because it's wrong.  
 
You also claim their website doesn't work but it requires a Chinese based phone number
to complete the sale. They actually provide better service this way by using human beings
to confirm purchases

I find it hysterical that the rabid Chinese nationalists and likely parties related to the
company have decided to post here. It might be worth noting that when companies are
not guilty of fraud they tend to deny it in the press release rather than saying they are
seeking legal counsel. If the company thought these claims were baseless they would
have said so.

Good work, John. A few disparate thoughts: 
 
The terms of the mergers are peculiar. See eg 
http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100329/UNIVERSAL-TRAVEL-GROUP_8-
K/v179028_ex10-1.htm 
All of the recent (1 yr)acquisitions seem to share this rather comical guarantee: the
acquired agencies and principals must work on behalf of UTA for five years and grow
their biz (Article IX) or UTA can get a full refund of their purchase price (Article XII)! No
risk for UTA- yay! ;-) 
 
Besides the auditor change, of course the CFO's brief tenure was of no consequence. 
 
Some years ago, I believe I was the first person to publicly state the ACRT fraud. Rather
than blog about it, I contacted some journalists and the SEC. Though I provided much
detail (more than your original UTA post), no one responded. So I broke the news on the
Yahoo board (since vanished), with similar responses to what you are now experiencing. 
My cynical takeaway was basically that the powers that be don't care, and there's no
point in trying to save the true believers. So henceforth, I just quietly short and keep the
details to myself. 
Too much time and frustration for me, and your skin seems to be thicker. 
 
Am working on a concept about regarding when to BTC: perhaps when the longs are
somewhere between the third and fourth stages of grief.

The reaction to your post certainly reminds me of the reception to David Einhorn's expose

As for UTA, if it is indeed fraudulent, it is defrauding not just its own investors, but also all
Chinese companies. US listed Chinese microcaps routinely trade for 5x PE, because
people are automatically baking in "fraud risk". This makes it hard for really worthy
companies to raise capital and grow and improve the Chinese economy... which is the
real tragedy here. 
 
As for UTA, the people who bought the stock with little DD should lose their shirts. It's
only fair.

There's been a lot of comments on UTA but nothing on Check-in. I'm wondering if it is as
attractive an investment as UTA. You give it a good wrap but I'd never heard of it. When I
look at the site I see a layout that looks similar to Wotif.com but not as slick. The few
hotels I checked were the same price as Wotif and the only difference I saw was a
A$3.50 booking fee as against A$4.95 for Wotif. If they do have an advantage over Wotif
its not obvious and the internet is a brutal winner take all game. Visits to websites,
websites within a category and pages within a website usually follow a Zipf distribution i.e
number 2 gets half the traffic of number 1 number 3 a third etc. Most of the costs are fixed
for a web service and there is probably not much difference in quality between the first
few, therefore costs for the first few are similar but revenue for number 1 is 3 times
number 3. Number 1 is creaming it and after the top few everyone else is going hungry.
To put this in perspective, Check-in was up to 200,000 room bookings in 4 years
according to the last press release on their site in November 2006. They have probably
increased a bit in the last 4 years but Wotif does that in 12 days using the numbers from
their Dec 2009 annual report. I checked them against Wotif and a few others on Alexa
and its bad for Check-in. Wotif has 12 times the 3 month reach and has doubled it in the
last two years while check-in is about the same. The other Alexa statistics suggest less
bookings per visitor as well. 
 
You said Check-in operates on "the thinnest margin" but compare this to Wotifs fat Profit
Before Income Tax of 55% of Total Revenue in the 6 months to Dec 2009.  
 
The harsh reality of Zipf is that you can be almost as good as the rich guy and starve.

Check-in is privately held. It is the DEEP discounter. Wotif is the mass market leader. 
 
Check-in is not as slick. It is just cheaper. It has relationships with hundreds of hotels who
trust it to sell excess inventory.

I'm thrilled to get a response. 
 
I think you are wrong on check-in's "DEEP" discounts. I can't find evidence that check-in
is cheaper than Wotif. On the front page "Todays Hot Deals" shows one hotel in Sydney,
Glenferrie Lodge. Wotif has the same hotel with all the same packages. Looking at the
first four on Sydney CBD "hot deals" page I see Amora Hotel Jamison, Four Seasons
Hotel, Hilton and Quay Grand Suites and all are exactly the same as Wotif, even for
availability.  
 
Wotif started life using the model you describe but they took so many bookings they
became mainstream. There was a time when Wotif had everything cheaper than
elsewhere. I had a bizarre experience once when I wanted to stay an extra night in a
hotel and the clerk wanted twice the Wotif price. I stood at the counter with the clerk and
booked the next night on Wotif so I didn't have to check-out and back in. He didn't even
need the confirmation from Wotif he was happy to see it confirmed on my laptop.


September 20, 2010 at 10:03 AM


Ken Taylor said...


But those days are past. I've noticed that hotel pricing has become much more dynamic
than it used to be and I think this makes more sense than trying to partition websites into
different markets. People migrate to better web sites in no time so a business model that
relies on few people knowing about you is doomed.  
 
Wotif takes 10% (is check-in any cheaper?) so a lot of hotels want to cut them out. I've
also had two occasions when the hotel didn't want to honour the Wotif prepaid booking,
sorted in the end, but a pain because you've already paid and all the angst is with you.
They've already got the money, so if you don't check in that's even better and they wont
hesitate to send you away and keep the money if you don't have your credit card or can't
meet some pedantic criteria they've dreamed up. 
 
These days if you can be bothered to put in the effort you make a short list from Wotif and
contact the hotel direct either by phone or through the hotel website. You often get a
lower price but more often, particularly with small hotels, get much better terms. Like
sometimes I finish early and go home and don't want to pay for an unused hotel room if I
can help it or things change and I don't turn up. 
 
A small hotel was recently trying to get me to cut out Wotif on the next booking for a
discount and I asked them how they managed their inventory across all these web
booking services. They told me they use recently developed software which manages it
automatically. It spreads the inventory across the services, monitors sales and shifts
inventory from one site to another as required. It is probably this software rather than
human intervention that is responsible for the offerings on every booking service being
identical.

Ken Taylor said...


Zipf dooms check-in in their current form. Their only chance is to define a new category
and own it. The problem I have with my strategy of using Wotif for reference then going
direct is the extra effort (too much usually). Can check-in find a way of making this
easier? They've already got the inventory data feeds, so its a good start. Get hotels on
side by feeding customers into their systems, letting them bill the customer direct and
helping them with dynamic pricing which only big hotel chains do well. I've colleagues
trying to do something similar to check-in in Indonesia so we've debated this a few times. 
 
If they can find a better model, the Wotif margins show there is money to be made and in
the web space a new model quickly kills the old.

stuff on which I can talk knowledgeably - but not in this forum... 
 
But check-in has something valuable - albeit a small niche. It is a deep discounter but
only when they can find inventory... they have relationships with a lot of hotels. 
 
This post is by-and-large not about check-in which has a small niche which may or may
not be sustainable. Check-in is not listed and is not rightly the subject of a stock-picking
blog. 
 
It is about CNUTG which has no niche at all... 
 
Anyway send email.

John, 
 
I've enjoyed your skewering of this clearly dodgy Chinese travel company. 
 
But I have to say your mates Aussie online hotel booking company check-in.com.au ain't
all that flash either. 
 
My wife just had a horrendous experience booking a hotel in Melbourne for this coming
weekend (Nov 29 and 30). She found the hotel and rate she wanted (The Rialto) but got
some weird 'code 505' error message when she tried to complete the credit card booking
via the website. 
 
At that point she had no idea if the booking had been successful or not. 
 
So she phoned the check-in.com.au contact number and was told that not only had the
booking not gone through to the actual hotel - but that our credit card has been charged
TWICE for the transaction. They then asked her to phone the hotel directly herself to
make the booking (great service eh!). This she did. But the sucker punch is that they have
told here it will take 6 days to reverse the credit card transaction. 
 
In some ways it would have been better if it worked liked the UTC site and didn't take any
credit card booking at all!! 
 
Cheers 
Mark Leydon

I have some internet marketing experience so here is my comment 
 
UTA website has a global traffic rant of 12,000 now that's a bit to much for fraud don't you
think so? Also when you type in the website in goolge it returns 30,000 results. Again
that’s a bit to much for a fraud company, isn’t it? 
 
And to make my point more clear lets compare that traffic to Bronte Capital website traffic
which is 3,963,955. 
 
The way I see it Universal Travel is 330 (3,963,955/12,000) times more legit business
