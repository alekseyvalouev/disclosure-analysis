China Finance Online: This Did Not End Well Last Time

Summary


This is not the first time JRJC has gone up on the news of a partnership.


In October 2007 the stock traded almost exactly the same, and the stock declined
substantially after that.


The stock is trading similar to PLUG in March, and that stock has declined almost
50% since then.


If history is correct, then JRJC would have already pre-announced earnings if they
were positive.


There is an excellent story in Seth Klarman's book "Margin of Safety" about market
crazes. As the story goes:


There is the old story about the market craze in sardine trading when the sardines
disappeared from the traditional waters in Monterey, California. The commodity
traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared. One day a buyer
decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started
eating. He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good. The
seller said, "you don't understand. These are not eating sardines, they are trading
sardines."


It should be clear to anyone involved in the markets that China Finance Online
(NASDAQ:JRJC) is a "trading sardine." If one needs confirmation of that simply type in
"$JRJC" on Twitter or StockTwits and see how many people are trading it. I suspect that
when the traders trading JRJC stop and take a bite of it, as always happens, they will be
sorely disappointed. I have covered just some of the fundamentals in a previous article, so
I will not rehash those here, even though there is more to the story.


The three highest volume days in JRJC's trading history have come in the last week.

Looking at the table above one notices two things. The first should be that it seems highly
unlikely that a company would have the three highest volume trading days in its history
occur back to back to back. The odds of that occuring are very low. (The same pattern
was present in Plug Power (PLUG)). And two, this pattern has emerged in this name
before (in October 2007).


The next question is obviously what happened in October 2007 and what the
consequence of it?


It was another hyped deal. And the pattern was almost exactly the same, eerily similar in
fact. On October 1st JRJC announced a partnership.


China Finance Online ("CFO"), a leading financial information, data and analytics
provider in China, today announced it has formed a strategic alliance with China
Center for Financial Research of Tsinghua University ("CCFR"), one of the most
reputable universities in China, primarily in the area of financial database
development.


The days after this announcement were the second and third highest in dollar volume
traded in JRJC's history.

So how did the buyers of that announcement of the partnership fare? As it turns out not
well.


This is not the first time such an event has occurred in the shares of JRJC. First in 2007
on the news of a partnership, and again in 2014 on the news of a partnership.


When traders eventually take a bite of the JRJC sardine they will likely not like what they
taste. It has happened before.


The last time we saw a similar story as the one that is playing out in JRJC right now was
PLUG. The trading dynamics in JRJC are very similar to PLUG's in March.

On March 8th LongShortTrader published a post about "anomalous trading activity" in the
shares of PLUG power. The YTD high in PLUG power came just two days later. Since
then PLUG shares have fallen by around 40%. The trading in JRJC is strikingly similar to
the trading in PLUG back in March.


The Fundamentals of The Sardine


Eventually someone will bite into the sardine. What will they taste? Well it all comes down
to fundamentals. Seeking Alpha contributor "3D Analytics" believes that JRJC is a rapidly
growing, undervalued company that is worth $20/ share and will pre-announce record
earnings any day now. I disagree.


While I don't believe that there are only human traders trading this, there are some. They
likely believed that the news that JRJC announced is a game changed. The press release
reads:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2457985-china-finance-online-this-did-not-end-well-last-time 5/14


China Finance Online Co. Limited ("China Finance Online", or the "Company"), a
leading web-based financial services company that provides Chinese retail investors
online access to stocks, commodities and wealth management products, today
announced that it has launched China's first independent web-based
securities trading platform, "Zhengquantong ("Securities Master")", on the
leading financial portals it operates, www.jrj.com and www.stockstar.com. Securities
Master is the product of a new strategic partnership China Finance Online has
entered into with the largest brokerage firm in China, CITIC Securities Co., Ltd.
(SHA: 600030) ("CITIC"), to seamlessly integrate China Finance Online's state-of-
the-art, web-based architecture with CITIC's robust trading and settlement system.


That sounds bullish. And if that's all you read then it would be bullish. As Citron Research
pointed out on Twitter, however, that is not the only story. Citron quoted from the annual
report:


Competitors with larger customer base and greater market visibility, such as Alibaba
Group (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Limited (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Baidu, Inc.
(NASDAQ:BIDU), recently launched their respective internet-based financial
platform which provides financial services similar to that of Yinglibao. In the future,
banks and fund management companies may also enter this market and offer similar
services to customers. Because of such expected influx of new market entrants,
competition in this industry may become more intense. Many of our new
competitors, especially Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, have greater financial and
marketing resources than we do. Thus, we may not be able to compete effectively or
provide a compelling service alternative for potential customers. Our financial results
may suffer as a result.


This clearly sounds more bearish. 3D Analytics also believes that JRJC will pre-announce
record earnings any day now. While this may happen, I am skeptical. JRJC pre-
announced record revenues on May 9th and reported the Quarter on June 19th. That
means that they pre-announced 29 days before the call. JRJC has historically reported
second quarter earnings during the second week of September. If they pre-announced it
at the same time as before they would have pre-announced already. While I cannot say
for certain whether they will or will not pre-announce earnings, it would appear that they
would have already pre-announced.


While JRJC is clearly not trading on fundamentals at the moment, it will eventually and
when that happens I believe the stock will fall substantially. It has happened before.

I think it pulls back but its a TERRIBLE comparison and article to try to save your puts.


The last pump was to what 40$ not 10$ which is obviously a huge difference.


The two deals are completely different- The deal they just signed is with largest brokerage firm in China which is
significant.

It's still a terrible comparision because the reaction to each deal and the stock's response was entirely
different each time, as he pointed out.

If history repeats, stock should go much higher before crashing again. I will not be surprised to see $20+ in
coming weeks before it is topped.


That means, it is still too early to buy put now.


You are right that JRJC is now a trading stock as can be seen in its daily trading volumes.


PLUG - After it went back to $4.00, stock has been moving up steadily recently as the company's
fundamentals improved a lot and more good news are ahead.

$JRJC balloon is going to go splat. Your chart comparison to plug is right on. this thing was just being "traded" around
like hot potato these last few days. Translation: there will be a legion of bagholders. See you at $5


28 Aug 2014, 02:54 PM

Maybe the reaction will be to 40$-That's little more extreme than a move to 10$.


When the stock was spiked 40$ I guess they were doing only 40 million in revenue 
Now it spiked to 10$ and the company I think will around 75-100 million annually in sales.


The company is 2-3x bigger today at 10$ then it was at 40$. You got lot crowded shorts blowing people up.

"This clearly sounds more bearish."


Not really. Every company's annual report contains risk factors, which by definition are things that sound potentially
bearish.


That particular section is not concerning at all to me, because I don't really care if their competitors launched financial
service platforms similar to Yinglibao. This is their old business and they have mostly transitioned away from it in favor
of their commission-based businesses.


What I do care about, is the fact that absolutely no one in China has an online trading platform similar to
Zhengquantong.


You're right, this time won't be different. The last time JRJC launched an online trading platform (the metals site), it led
to an enormous increase in revenues. In that sense the news of their stock trading portal will not be different at all -

except perhaps in the magnitude of the revenue increase.


BTW, they don't have to pre-announce, even if they do have record results. They are already covered by announcing
the "meaningful information", which is the launch of the trading platform. They are under no obligation to pre-
announce record earnings.


The SEC strives to ensure that “all investors … have access to certain basic facts about an investment prior to buying
it, and so long as they hold it. To achieve this, the SEC requires public companies to disclose meaningful financial and
other information to the public. This provides a common pool of knowledge for all investors to use to judge for
themselves whether to buy, sell, or hold a particular security. Only through the steady flow of timely, comprehensive,
and accurate information can people make sound investment decisions.”


They are 100% covered with the announcement of the platform alone. In fact, as a foreign company, the requirements
of their quarterly reports are very lax (they don't need to publish 10-Q or 8-K's). More info here: http://bit.ly/1mYO22X

Author: The last stock offering of Plug (Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan??) has big time buyers of the stock option
institutional wise. Was it 4.25 or5.25 per share? I don't see many changes in their ownership of Plug so where is the
drop off in price coming from. Short interest without checking it at this moment seems to have decreased rather than
increasing so where is the drop off in price coming from. Employee ownership has increased rather than decreased
so where is the drop off in price? You seem to equate Andy Marsh and Plug Power with the same code of ethics you
characterized China companies as possessing which you equate with the drop off in price with Plug. That doesn't
seem to be a big enough reasoning behind this article. could it be that those you bought into the stock when it was still
a casino stock have taken their just profits and moved on. There are enough day traders and speculators and impulse
buyers to steer the price of a stock adding to that the influence of the Jim Cramer's. I'm getting the opinion that
Seeking Alpha has gets a contributor who takes a Cramer article or "The Street" articles and puts a different slant on
them to the extend they seem like sister publications. I realize their are a lot of people capable of pulling the China
Syndrome and applying fear which makes the uncertain scramble for safety like the Toro run in Spain. Is this simply
jumping on the band wagon. Tomorrow I fear we'll have the other side of the story to offset this one. How can a
publication have a bad track record with tit for tat (for lack of another phrase) For each stock sold there has to be a
buyer. It's not a department store operation.

As a disciple of Citron, we assume you are short PLUG as well. Good luck. (We fail to understand why you would
correlate a viable and growing business such as PLUG to the "sardine" situation you outline, as smelly as that
sounds).

This article is incredibly poorly written. The biggest error you made is to not even look at the companies Sc Filings
and see the S-8 filed on 8/7/2014. 32 MILLION SHARES for EMPLOYEE BENEFIT plan. The float is 9m shares,
massive dilution whenever these JRJC guys decide to give themselves a bonus. That is the reason for being bearish.
Fluff poorly written, misleading press release shortly following 32m shares of employee benefits is why this stock will
be back to $5 shortly.

You need to look into the details. Those stock plan figures are based on ordinary shares, not American
ADR's. That's why it says: "Ordinary Shares, $0.001 par value HK". The "HK" is for Hong Kong. These are
ordinary shares of the company issued in Hong Kong.


It says that the value of each share is $0.844 which is based on the average trading price of those shares on
August 5, 2014. Each ADR is worth 5 ordinary shares, so the ADR price on that date was 5 times $0.844, or

$4.22.


It also says that the total value of the shares at that price is $27M. With the share price increase since 8/5, the
value now is $63M.


JRJC's market cap today is $215M, so this plan would dilute by up to 29%. Not a ridiculous amount, but still
very significant.


From looking at the filings we can see that this stock plan was reviewed and approved by not one but two of
the top-4 auditors in the world, and also by another legal firm. So it is pretty serious! Clearly they want to
cover themselves from any shareholder lawsuits which could be filed if the stock plan were deemed to be
excessive or undeserved.


Anyway, my guess is that they are expecting to report some pretty good numbers for this year and a good
outlook for 2015, resulting from the new stock trading platform.


We'll see how it plays out! Good luck and happy trading.

begin to come out. thanks citron!

After all the excitement air in the baloon has gone and the tradding trend starts slipping down as you can see the
chart on the last 7 days tradding after the news. 
If there aren't any more news this duck is going down around $5.50 in the next month or so by then I will consider to
dig in.

you're "long puts" that will make sure to confuse the uneducated retail investor!

Can you short the stock? I tried it but cannot get the shares to short. I use scotTrade and sogo trade. Both
have no shares to give to me to short the stock.


I only do day trading on JRJC now, long or short. Quite profitable last few days, averaging 10% gain per day.
If I can short it, I can make more money.


I see no reason the company releases its pre-earning Sept 2. 8/18 news release was in fact its pre-earning
news release.

JRJC - it was down to as low as 8.88 last Friday. I do believe that it was me who cost the stock down.


I put a $9.12 limit buy order when the stock was at $9.45 around 2:00pm.


It took almost 2 hours for the market maker to bring stock down, filled my order and earned the commission.


Then I added big at 8.90. My 9.12 buy was a small order and I knew that mm will push the stock down further once
my 9.12 order was filled. He wanted to scare me and gave me the impression that stock is going to break down and
force me to sell for a loss.


My practice proved that this stock is manipulated but one can still be quite profitable if he knows how to play with
market makers.


As this is a very volatile stock now, one can make 10% gain in a single day.


I made four trades on JRJC last Friday. I sold it at 10.14 in pre-market trading which I bought it at 9.35 Thursday.
Then bought at 9.49 and sold at 9.60; bought it back at 9.43 and sold at 9.60 again. The last trade was bought at 9.12
and then 8.90.


Actually I outlined all my trading strategy on JRJC before I actually made the trades.


My prediction for Tuesday: it should be an up day for JRJC. Let us find out whether my prediction is correct after
market closes tomorrow.

It looks like the last earnings release was 6/16, so we will probably have the next release sometime around
9/16. I'm not sure where Bloomberg and WSJ got the 9/2 date but sometimes they estimate these dates and
get it wrong.


I'm hoping that this quarter will be a record number... I am cautiously optimistic about it. If the platform was
just launched a few weeks ago, it could take a little time for it to ramp up. Who knows. To me it doesn't really
matter, I am in JRJC for the long haul, not a short-term trade. In ten years I think their market cap will be
measured in billions, not millions.

JRJC had a down day. But it did jumped to $9.75 at open, which gave a nice price for me to dump the shares
I hold last Friday.


My prediction: stock may go back to uptrend at around $7.50.

Deepfryer999
Nice jump today. Sold a small portion of my shares for $9.25. I'll re-invest that same money if it drops back down to
~$8.50. It seems pretty range-bound, at least until the earnings come out.

alexa.com ranking and the sites still sit at 44 and 66. 
Theoretically we should the sites improve in their ranking....


If they don't pre-announce substantial increased revenue before the next quarter then I think it's safe to assume that
the platform is being adopted slowly.


Let's see if the stock will re-gain it's 50 day MA maybe after the protests settle down.

Agreed. And it's worth mentioning that those ranking are already incredibly impressive, especially for a small-
cap company. In the global rankings they are ahead of all the largest brokerages like E-trade, Fidelity,
TDAmeritrade, etc.

Assuming that chinese investors were ready to trade online, as this platform has already become available and is
being promoted by very serious firms... 
why do you think no earnings are being released to stop the fall of the stock...The only answer has to be that there
earnings are not there yet...


any thoughts?

They just announced Q2 earnings a little over a week ago, so it will be a couple more months before they
announce Q3 earnings. The metals platform generated revenues pretty quickly after it was launched, so
hopefully we will see the same kind of quick results from the stock platform.


I don't think they should worry about short-term price variation. It is still up for the year.
