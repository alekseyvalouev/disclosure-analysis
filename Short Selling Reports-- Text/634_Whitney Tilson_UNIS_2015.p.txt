How Wall Street Enables Stock Promotions: A Case Study Of Jefferies
And Unilife
May 20, 2015 7:22 PM ET55 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Unilife, which I believe is a pure promotion and likely a total fraud, continues to miss
guidance and expectations.


The analysts at Jefferies, however, continue to rate the stock a “Buy” and urge
investors to have “continued patience."


This isn’t surprising, as the analysts are deeply conflicted due to Unilife’s ongoing
need to raise capital.


I believe these conflicts are widespread on Wall Street and lead even reputable firms
like Jefferies to sully themselves.


It's well known to experienced observers that much of the research published by Wall
Street firms is corrupted by their desire to do banking business for the companies their
analysts are rating. If a particular firm's analysts write negative research reports on a
company and slap a "Hold" (or, heaven forbid, "Sell") rating on its stock, then the company
is likely retaliate by looking elsewhere the next time it hires an investment bank to, say,
lead a debt or equity offering. Thus, it's little wonder that analysts generally pump stocks
and rarely issue sell ratings.


In fairness, after the crackdowns by Eliot Spitzer and again after the Great Recession, I
suppose that Wall Street research has become slightly less corrupt than it used to be (or
at least analysts are more careful in what they put in emails!). But the conflicts of interest
haven't gone away so investors would be well advised to view analyst reports with a great
deal of skepticism, especially in the seedy underbelly of the market where the diciest,
most fraudulent and promotional companies are.


Sadly, in many cases, the analysts of reputable firms ignore countless warning flags and
promote companies like this for a simple reason: greed. The worst companies are, by
definition, almost always losing a lot of money and thus need to regularly issue debt and
equity, making them lucrative banking clients.

A case in point is the pumping by the analysts at Jefferies of a stock I'm short, Unilife
(NASDAQ:UNIS), which I think is an obvious promotion and likely a total fraud. It's so
egregious that I did something last October that I've never done before: I wrote to the
analysts, calling them out, and sent a copy to the CEO of Jefferies, Richard Handler.


Three quarters have now elapsed since then (the company just reported earnings a week
ago Monday) and everything I predicted has come true, as the company burns through
cash at an incredible rate and spirals toward what I believe is inevitable bankruptcy - yet
the Jefferies analysts are still pumping the stock, maintaining a Buy rating and continuing
to preach the mantra of "continued patience" to investors. (Click here to read their report
from last October and here for last week's update.)


I'm sharing the emails I sent to Jefferies last October plus one on Tuesday because I'm
disgusted with this kind of behavior (which is by no means limited to Jefferies) and I think
shining a light on it might do some good.


Background on Unilife


Unilife describes itself this way:


Unilife Corporation is a U.S.-based developer and commercial supplier of injectable
drug delivery systems. Unilife's broad portfolio of proprietary technologies includes
prefilled syringes with automatic needle retraction, drug reconstitution delivery
systems, auto-injectors, wearable injectors, ocular delivery systems and novel
systems. Each of these innovative and highly differentiated platforms can be
customized to address specific customer, drug and patient requirements. Unilife's
global headquarters and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities are located in York,
PA.


While this sounds great, and there's a thin veneer of legitimacy in the form of numerous
deals with brand-name firms, they never seem to amount to anything, as the company
hasn't had a single dollar of product sales in years, despite endless promises.


In my view, Unilife is a pure promotion and likely a total fraud. I don't have space here to
make the full argument for why I believe this, so here are links to various articles that lay it
out quite well:

Emails to Jefferies Analysts Last October


After Unilife reported yet another quarter of dismal results and endless hype last October,
the Jefferies analysts, Raj Denhoy, Anthony Petrone and Imron Zafar, reiterated their
"Buy" rating, which led me to send this email to them on October 9th:

Subject line: UNIS a buy -- really???


Dear Raj, Anthony and Imron,


I normally don't waste my time writing to analysts, but your report this morning on
Unilife really takes the cake.


Let me get this straight… the company just reported the following:


*$8.4 million in unrestricted cash


*$55.4 million in debt


*Not a single dollar in product sales (that's right, when costs of goods sold is zero,
that means they didn't sell a single syringe (and it's not just last quarter - this has
been true for the entire trailing 12 months)


*Net debt skyrocketed from $18 million to $47 million in three months


*By your own projections, they will continue to burn $12-15M/quarter for the
foreseeable future (I promise it will be a lot higher)


It is blindingly obvious that this company is teetering on bankruptcy and, barring a
miracle, the equity will soon be worthless.


Yet you have a BUY rating on the stock, based on a valuation of 4x your revenue
estimate (which I promise they won't hit) three years out?


Look, I get it: to stave off the inevitable a little while longer, the company will have to
do a big equity offering, irrespective of price, which will crush the stock - but
generate a lot of fees for the bankers - and of course you want to be at that table as
long as possible. But a "buy" - really???


I think you're knowingly participating in a scheme that is incinerating (and will
continue to incinerate) retail investors (the only ones foolish enough to own a dog
like this), and I think that's wrong. In fact, I think this is a telling case study of so
many things that are rotten, both on Wall Street and in the sleazy corners of our
markets. I'm going to do my best to let as many people as possible know what you're
doing.


Best regards,


Whitney Tilson

Managing Partner


Kase Capital


Full disclosure: of course I'm short this - very profitably - and am quite certain that I
will never have to cover.


Emails With Jefferies' CEO Last October


I also forwarded this email to the CEO of Jefferies, Richard Handler, with the following
note:


Subject line: Your analysts' shameless pumping of Unilife


Dear Mr. Handler,


I thought you might be interested in the email below that I sent last night to your
team of analysts who have shamelessly pumped a well-known promotion, Unilife (a
Jefferies banking client), which is truly one of the most ridiculous and worthless
companies I've ever encountered in my 16-year career as a hedge fund manager.


Perhaps I should be thanking them for helping to give me a better entry point on the
short side last December at $4.55 (I have yet to cover a single share and hope never
to have to, as my price target is a penny), but what's going on here is just so wrong -
and so totally inconsistent with what you wrote in your recent quarterly letter:


"People who take short cuts, are political, prioritize themselves above others,
take excessive risks for personal gain, don't value capital, or are unethical are
outright cancers. These types of people will not only flourish in the next crisis,
but most probably they will cause it."


Can you not see that this type of behavior by your employees and your firm, which,
sadly, is all too common on Wall Street, is just the kind of cancer that you're
(correctly) railing against?


Sincerely yours,


Whitney Tilson

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3200576-how-wall-street-enables-stock-promotions-a-case-study-of-jefferies-and-unilife 6/22


To his credit, he and, later, Jefferies' General Counsel, Mike Sharp, both replied promptly
and courteously and said exactly the right things. (You'll have to take my word for it, as I
asked Sharp for permission to share the emails he and Handler sent me, but he declined.)


I replied to Handler:


Thanks for your reply. I know you're not going to get into an email discussion with a
short seller, but if you want, I can send you plenty of background material.


This isn't a good company doing pioneering, innovative work that, like many early-
stage companies, has missed some deadlines; rather, it's a pure stock promotion
(and, in my opinion, likely a total fraud if the history of the CEO and a former
employee whistle-blower are to be believed).


The history here is instructive: the CEO is Australian and he ran the exact same
scam in Australia roughly a decade ago, in which the stock skyrocketed 10-fold and
then collapsed. So now he's brought his bag of tricks here - and your analysts are
falling for it hook, line and sinker (or at least pretending to, in order to support the
banking relationship).


The attached Forbes article from a year ago, How Is A $329M Syringe Company Still
Unprofitable After 11 Years?, lays the story nicely (it even quotes your analyst).
Here's an excerpt:


Unilife is a parable of broken promises, Keystone Kop-like execution, self-
enrichment by top executives-and the triumph of story over substance.
"Shortall doesn't have any medical background. He's not a technical guy. He
doesn't have a finance background," says a former Unilife executive. "His
position is as an entrepreneurial sales guy getting out there and selling the
dream."


He's been chasing that dream for some time.


Best regards,


Whitney


I was impressed with both Handler's and Sharp's responses - they handled it perfectly -
and at that time, Jefferies had not conducted any banking business with Unilife since
2012, so I decided not to write this article back then.

Email to Jefferies' Analysts This Week


I've decided to write this article now, however, because two things have changed: 1)
Jefferies has led a lucrative banking deal with Unilife; and 2) The company has reported
three dismal quarters that affirm everything I wrote to the analysts last October, yet
nevertheless they're still pumping this stock with a "Buy" rating and urging investors to
have "continued patience" so I sent them the following email last week:

Subject line: UNIS a still a buy - really???


Dear Raj, Anthony and Imron,


I'm the hedge fund manager and occasional short seller who appeared in the
Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) story by 60 Minutes - and I'm also short UNIS.


I last wrote to you on Oct. 9th last year, the day UNIS reported Q4 '14 earnings,
warning you that this company is "a pure stock promotion (and, in my opinion, likely
a total fraud…)."


Let's take a look at what's happened in the three quarters since then, relative to the
estimates in your Buy report on that day (9/9/14):


*Revenue in the first three quarters of FY 2015 has been a mere $9.7 million, 47%
worse than the $18.3 million you projected.


*UNIS hasn't booked a single dollar of product sales vs. your estimate of $7.3
million.


*EBITDA of -$52.6 million, 49% worse than your estimate of -$35.3 million.


*A net loss of $64.8 million, 31% worse than your estimate of -$44.9 million.


*Cash burn (operating cash flow minus cap ex) of $47.8 million vs. your estimate of
"$12-$15 million/quarter."


*Share count of 131.2 million, 29% higher than your estimate of 102 million.


*Despite hugely dilutive share issuances that raised $57.1 million, net debt has fallen
by a mere $4.1 million (from $47.0 to $42.9 million).


It's not like UNIS just had a bad nine months because these horrific results are
consistent with what the company has been reporting for years. In light of this, it
should have filed for bankruptcy long ago, but it so far has cheated fate thanks to a
remarkable ability to fool enough analysts and investors to maintain a high enough
share price to issue equity and keep the con going.


It's clear that you're worried - for example, the subtitle of your report is "Still Waiting
on Those Commercial Sales" - yet you maintain a Buy rating and continue to preach
the mantra of "continued patience" to investors.

You're like Charlie Brown, with (Unilife CEO Alan) Shortall playing the role of Lucy,
pulling the football away at the last minute, with you landing on your backs every
time.


At what point are you going to wake up and stop being snookered by a master con
man????

Why Is Jefferies Sullying Itself?


I believe that Jefferies is a reputable firm, so why would it sully itself to even be associated
with a company like Unilife, much less endorse it with a buy rating, much less actually
raise capital for it?


In fairness, the main answer, I think, is that the Jefferies analysts may genuinely believe
Unilife's story. Reasonable people can disagree about controversial stocks and my views
on Unilife are opinions, not facts. Thus, if you asked the Jefferies analysts, "Do you
believe Unilife is a promotion and/or fraud?", they'd of course say no - and I think they'd
even pass a lie detector test to this effect.


But as Charlie Munger has often warned, self-interest bias is incredibly powerful. One of
Munger's favorite quotes, by Upton Sinclair, is: "It is difficult to get a man to understand
something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."


And there's some powerful self-interest at work here: you need look no further than the
equity offering Unilife did in January that raised $44.7 million for the company, which
shows that Jefferies was one of two "Joint Book-Running Managers" - here's the cover

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3200576-how-wall-street-enables-stock-promotions-a-case-study-of-jefferies-and-unilife 10/22


Conclusion 


I’m saddened by the heavy losses that inexperienced individual investors suffer when they
get sucked into promotions and/or frauds like Unilife, and I’m disgusted by the fact that
reputable firms like Jefferies facilitate this. That said, I don’t think Jefferies is doing
anything illegal – rather, this is simply run-of-the-mill self-interest bias at work.

The real message here is that this kind of behavior is widespread on Wall Street,
especially in the seedy underbelly of the market, so investors beware!


PS – I don’t read the message boards for the articles I publish, but I do want to hear
thoughtful comments and questions so I invite my readers to communicate directly with
me via Seeking Alpha messaging. I will post my answers on the message board.


Disclosure: The author is short UNIS.


The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions. The author
is not receiving compensation for it. The author has no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

1. JPMorgan owns about 15% of UNIS. So did they just buy it because its a scam too. 
2. Maquet Cardiovasculars (Gettinge Group -parent companies) last President did't even have a college degree. So
why would you need to be a "technical degree" to run a business?


Bottom line your just short the stock. Well thats pretty dangerous if they sign another big contract, which could happen
any time.

The CEO of Jefferies name is Dick Handler? That's hilarious. I think he should use some of his earnings from
scamming the public to change his name.

Brian Smith, Jr., Contributor
You think JPMorgan shows up as a holder because they believe in UNIS?! Thanks for the laugh. JPM shut
down its prop trading desk several years ago because of the Volcker Rule. What you're seeing is a mix
between private wealth clients and index/sector funds. Trust me, there's no fundamentals-driven investment
professional at JPM who's buying UNIS.


This sort of conclusion is evidence of what Tilson refers to as the "scheme that is incinerating (and will
continue to incinerate) retail investors (the only ones foolish enough to own a dog like this)." If analyst
research were objective, UNIS would be bankrupt, and retail investors wouldn't be trying to rationalize their
investments in a company that has literally missed every target and timeline it has ever set.

this is a great article and covers an issue all too often not discussed in public. I think there was an

much much (much) lower.

This is a fantastic article, thank you for writing it. If more retail investors understood how they are being churned by
the Wall Street capital raising machine there would be fewer investors losses in companies like Unilife, Arena,
Neonode, etc. Most likely nothing will change but a few wise novice investors may learn something from this article.

Wow, is this considered research these days? I guess you are calling Sanofi a fraud too then, paying $5M upfront for
an exclusive 15 yr deal with UNIS. Funny how such a big reputable company could have the wool pulled over their

penned by a hedge fund short trying to exit a large position.

Sanofi is so big they can throw $5 million up front at a flyer. It's a tax write off. Who cares. Big companies
need to have a toe in the water in various R&D projects even though it will never pan out. If Unilife really had
something, they would have revenue by now. The Sanofi relationship is a tired device to help them raise
capital. SHOW ME THE REVENUE!

What a fraud you are. You “don’t have space here to make the full argument”, but remarkably you have the audacity
to reference the likes of Adam Gefvert, Kerrisdale Management, The Pump Stopper and Richard Pearson, whose
articles are riddled (as is yours) with half-truths, innuendo, outright lies and and slander. To suggest that they “lay it
out quite well” just enables you to associate yourself with trash, without getting any of it on your coat. Incredible.


20 May 2015, 09:11 PM


dslezak2016@kellogg.northwestern.edu
Let me start with stating that this seems like a pump to me mainly because it doesn't appear to reflect
acknowledgment of the underlying business. Mainly, 1) the business is not your standard manufacture and sell type of
business. It is actually customized delivery business. So I recommend taking a tour of the factories to see for yourself.
What you will noticed is that they increased their R&D spending at the same time as Abbvie paid for the right to
negotiate. UNIS then uses this money to create the product for Abbvie and enters an agreement with Abbvie. This
guarantees them sales of the product vs. creating something you think is revolutionary and then having to convince
everyone that it is revolutionary.  
2) They just hired some smart and expensive people. You'd think that they don't need that type of talent to be
scamming. 
3) Finally, if you have conversation with their CFO you will noticed that he is pretty comfortable with the contract they
already brought to public which will start generating revenues as they develop the products. Again, the company
comes, orders product, UNIS develops it, tests it, and it goes to market. So not much scam in the fact that it just takes
a while to get to market. Either way, the backlog is amazing, the revenues are amazing, and once products are
developed its a cashflow machine without much marketing cost at all. So either way if hedge funds and whomever
keeps pumping short for this, I will be loading up on cheap shares.  
4) Lastly, it'd shock me that banks wouldn't see through this as they review contract as part of lending money to a
negative cash flow company which is what they still are.


20 May 2015, 09:21 PM


pennywatchdog
dslezak, this is not a "pump", pump and dump involves someone who hypes the company endlessly to drive
share prices up, and then sells them at the artificial high he has created. A true pump and dump involves
insiders selling. Sometimes when a company has paid for things with shares, as is common with young
biotechs, these shares are high-jacked by third parties who then become the perpetrators of subsequent

What this author does is called "Short and Distort". He first finds shares to borrow so he can go short. Then
he publishes a damning article about the company to spread fear to unsuspecting and usually new investors

who will then sell, driving the price lower, the lower it goes the more money he makes on his short. Tilson is
an expert at this, but all it takes is true believers to fight back with facts to refute any fictions he has created.


From the arguments expressed here I believe this company has great potential, it is hard to hold long when
price keeps dropping as impatient investors drop out, and then to have this fear-monger show up when the
price is already at a 52 week low is just ludicrous! Hold on true believers, ignore this joker, buy more at this
low if you can, sounds like the next earnings report will tell who is right here...

Another possible fraud, VIPS, is also 'generously' covered by Piper Jaffray.


Guess who underwrote the IPO???

What hypocrisy!


This article is a testimony to Mr. Whitney Tilson's own "self-interest bias".... as it is he who stands to profit the most
should Unilife not succeed. He doesn't just want you to lose all of your investment, he wants you to lose it fast. He
wants to see the absolute failure of a small American business and the unemployment of hundreds of American
taxpayers. He wants shareholders of Unilife to lose their entire investment... Well, not their entire investment.... I
believe he is hoping you get a penny back.


Mr. Tilson's salary, literally depends upon his profits... which are your losses. The more you lose, the more he
makes..... the faster, the better.


In my opinion, it would be a shame if anyone gave this article any credibility at all.

Yes, the motivation is obvious. 21,000,000 short interest (30 days to cover) as of Apr 30.... that is going to be
one tight window to scramble out of when the stampede begins on the next deal announcement. A
formalization of the AbbVie agreement would certainly get things rolling in that regard and that could come
any day now. An exclusivity payment related to that agreement could easily top $50M.

It's entertaining to read these comments. I've been reading them since I started following UNIS in 2011. It's
like lambs to the slaughter. I have made money shorting this stock 5x (5/5). It's sad kind of but I'll take it if
people want to give their money away.

Sorry I don't agree. Author did make money form shorting. But he is honest and reveal that. This is not
important. He told us the whole story. Yes you could say he was trying to maximize his shorting by cancelling
'Buy' rating suddenly. This is just a guess, which is easy rejected by jury. But I see his motivation is to reveal
this 'fraud' to the public and try to stop it as soon as possible. Speaking out needs courage. This is a small
world, they (analysts, big moneys, professional investors, etc) know each other and take care of each other,
leaving retail investors helpless.

Look at the price action after the media coverage at Feb. POS 101. The CEO is a fishy dude with a fishy history.
During their last CC, he got irritated by skeptics as if he was being treated unfairly. Adding the Sanofi deal...as usual.
Typical, lame..


So many promises..no delivery.


Jefferies...what can I say..another POS. From now on, instead of shitting on newbies they should start a show
smudging on each other. Hope this article can be that catalyst.


Nice work Mr Tilson.

Actually sighting a investment bank writing a bullish piece(s) to secure dealflow is somewhat lame. This has been
going on for as long as ever. If there was a shred of evidence that he uncovered at let's say regarding the deal
announcements or the facilities like the LL piece, I would maybe look at this article differently. But to simply suggest
Jeffries wrote a bullish piece to try and get on the book is nothing new at all. You see this going on everywhere. I
wonder if the author sat down with the management or vistited the facilities to see what's really going on. I will say it
has been a stock that trades in a very particular pattern. So putting "short" attacks out towards the bottom has also
been a common theme with this stock.

unilifebeliever
Author, get your facts right before writing an article- 
1) the company doesn't have cost of sales because they are in research and development and have stated on many
cc's that it is the reason why when analysts ask. 
2) name any other company in the world that has signed deals with sanofi, abbvie, AstraZeneca, Hikma and a few
others. 
3) first of all have a look at their products and what their competitors produce, they absolutely smash bd and west
pharma. 
4) the reason they have signed these deals and not made major revenues is because they have to get fda approval
and that can take 2 years I think because the drug has to sit in the container for a certain period.

UNIS $15.50 Price Target


Griffin Securities  
May 14, 2015


Awaiting the Next Large Deal


Negotiations are moving along with several pharmaceutical 
companies.


The closest to completion is probably the commercial 
supply agreement with AbbVie that became public in January 
when Unilife received $5 million for giving the drug company 
the right to negotiate an exclusive contract. During the recent 
conference call, the Company alluded to other discussions, and 
we believe some are potentially transformative.


Are drug companies interested in Unilife’s products since 
they will participate in the “Internet of Things”?  
We believe the answer is “most likely,” though we can only speculate at 
this juncture. The Company’s devices are distinct with respect 
to their designs and drug delivery capabilities. But the built-in 
communication capability of the Lisa™ reusable autoinjector and 
Precision- and Flex-Therapy™ wearable injectors is what truly 
sets them apart. By incorporating WiFi, G4, and/or Bluetooth 
technology into these devices, Unilife stands with the “Internet 
of Things” innovators that include Apple, Samsung, and the 
manufacturers of electronic components Skyworks Solutions and 
Freescale Semiconductor. Unilife is using the technology to 
improve patient care via better compliance with prescribed drug 
regimens.


Timing of the next deal is important.


The Company closed the March quarter with $39 million of cash on hand after raising 
$44.7 million via an equity financing in the quarter and receiving 
$5 million from AbbVie. Operations consumed $11.2 million and 
$4.6 million was invested in capital equipment. More investments 
in clean rooms and manufacturing equipment are likely, as the 
Company has two high-speed syringe production lines in place 
and another two on order that should arrive this calendar year. 
As a result, a deal that provides a sizable upfront payment

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3200576-how-wall-street-enables-stock-promotions-a-case-study-of-jefferies-and-unilife 18/22


would likely remove any uncertainty over the need for an external 
financing in the near future.


We are maintaining our BUY recommendation on UNIS 
shares. The ongoing investments in production facilities and 
equipment suggest that large shipments of syringes and possibly 
other devices are “just around the corner.” Commercial supply 
agreements are in place with Hikma and Sanofi, and management 
has indicated that wearable injectors will be needed soon for 
clinical trials. A deal with AbbVie or another drug company that 
generates significant business in the coming fiscal year (starts 
July 1st) may transform Unilife into a profitable corporation.

Ikarus, this stock is NOT GETTING SMOKED AFTER THIS ARTICLE.


The price at the time of this article release on 052015 at 7:22pm was 2.85. The price now two days later is
2.60, so unless this guy is a million shares short he really is not making much money on a .20 cent drop. The
price has been in decline since 042015 for whatever reasons, I don't know, but it does not appear that this
short is doing much more than was already happening. It has been in a general down trend for a year now,
but it seems that a 52 week low was achieved on 092914, and the trend seems to have reversed since then.
There seems to be support at this level at @ 2.60, it has been my experience that if the longs are right and

express so vehemently you can stop this short now. Some shorts are a good thing, but most shorts I have
seen are based on sheer hyperbole, and usually they attack a stock that is already down. Tilson is well-known
for setting up elaborate short schemes, he is always short the stock, and he exaggerates and prevaricates
and always has "evil" on his agenda.

Tilson, still waiting on answer if you are writing to big pharma regarding your concerns that UNIS is a scam. Hikma
which supplied 13% of generic pharmaceuticals in the US is going to launch 20 drugs using UNIS devices by 2017
and Biodel got tremendous results for their diabetes drug using UNIS dual chamber auto-reconstitution device
recently---NDA by end of 2016 for launch in 2017. Also Sanofi just got themselves into a mess because after getting
into a contract in 2013 for Lovenox syringes (150Million annual minimum), they quickly secured ANOTHER
agreement in 10/2014 for the more expensive wearable injectors. What is AbbVie ( a 96B company) and Sanofi (a
$121B company) thinking? According to you, they must be idiots for not seeing what you see. Please answer and
save us all with your insight. You are looking more and more like the scam and I want you to have opportunity to
provide more clarity.


22 May 2015, 11:12 AM


unilifebeliever
wannamillion, what I find funny is that Abbvie's patent on Humira runs out in 2-3 years and they are looking at
new devices for auto-immune diseases? Coincidence or not that they have turned to Unilife to fight off generic
competition? Yet this Tilson guy believes Unilife is being pumped.
