Executive Summary: 


This report will show that Marubeni has failed to recognize material asset 


impairments of large overseas commodity and agricultural investments. Once the 


market recognizes these substantial losses there is material downside to the stock 


price. We estimate asset impairments of ¥150-200 billion (US$1.2-$1.7 billion) 


and a 40% downside price target for the stock price. Based on Toshiba Corp’s 


precedent, we also believe there is potential for Marubeni to incur fines as 


Japan’s regulators go after companies that purposely delay making impairments.

Introduction 


Japanese trading companies are the last trading companies left standing in 2015. (Share price changes: 


Marubeni -9.7%, Glencore - 70.8%, Noble – 65%). Marubeni is the smallest of the major sogo shosha but 


by some metrics the highest levered by Japanese and global standards. Its business is built on trading in 


a wide array of products and materials, and investing in natural resources and other industries. Over the 


last decade, the investment side has become an increasingly key part of Marubeni’s overall business and 


profit. As Marubeni set a goal of overtaking larger rivals
1
, the company increased its investments, 


funded by bank borrowings, with a strong focus on multi-billion dollar commodity assets. The company 


did not meet its goals. Instead, it has leaned on very aggressive accounting to manage its financial 


statements. Our research shows that such practices are no longer sustainable and major writedowns are 


now in the offing. 





Using publicly available information, industry checks and research, we aim to present in this report a 


clinical review of Marubeni’s financials and of the marquee investments the company made as it set off 


to catch-up with rivals. We have identified data points that show — despite Marubeni’s own poor 


disclosure — that impairments on several of the investments are now inevitable. The research also 


presents a case for considering Marubeni as having deliberately avoided its obligations under IFRS 


accounting rules in recognizing impairments. We show how Marubeni’s leverage and strategy motivates 


them to delay impairments and also highlight that such tactics are no longer being overlooked in Japan. 


This month’s record fine of Toshiba Corp., one of Japan’s top blue chips, was based  around this issue: 


deliberate delays in booking losses.  





Finally, we show how Marubeni’s investment model is based on large cash outlays and with little profit 


in return. We believe this echoes issues raised at other trading houses such as Noble Group Ltd. (ticker:  


NOBL SP) and Glencore (ticker: Glen LN).  





All this implies a material downside to Marubeni’s share price. We believe the market is missing both 


the severity of Marubeni’s accounting issues and its leverage, which will be painfully exposed once the 


impairments come through. In our assessment, Marubeni’s shares are worth 40% less than  the close on 


Dec. 16, 2015.

 Y150bn - Y200bn of writedowns in the wings.  Writedowns are required  at some of Marubeni’s 


largest assets (Gavilon, Roy Hill).  We estimate impairments at just those two could reach ¥150 


bn – Y200 bn, with a significant potential for more to mature. The rout in iron ore alone should 


spark a major writedown at Roy Hill. Today analysts long-term price midpoint for ore is $65/mt – 


half of what Marubeni expected four years ago. And if we take SGX Iron Ore Futures prices as a 


guide, which has future prices stretching to Dec 2018 at $34.13 a metric ton, then the equity 


value of Roy Hill would be zero and the writedown at that asset alone would number Y150bn to 


Y170bn. 


 Risk of restatement of last year’s earnings. Marubeni likely intentionally delayed impairments 


when it performed the mandatory impairment test of assets at the close of its last fiscal year 


(March 31, 2015). Rather than reflect the market situation in all commodity markets, Marubeni 


selectively opted to mark writedowns in some products (oil, coal) while ignoring a consistent 


thought process for others (iron ore, grain). This resulted in impairments that were miniature 


versions of what our research shows were due. Just these admissions sent Marubeni’s stock 


tumbling and one credit rating agency to change the company’s outlook to negative. We believe 


with more realistic asset impairments now inevitable, earnings can no longer be managed.  


 Regulators’ awakened interest in impairment delays portends Y5.1bn fine.  Regulators have 


taken a dim view, resulting in a record fine of Y7.4bn, for similar transgressions at Toshiba. 


Toshiba failed to recognize losses, which led to overstated earnings and engaged in continuous 


fund raising on the back of this misleading information. We believe Marubeni has engaged in 


both of these practices as well. Toshiba’s fine was calculated at Y7.4bn, or 2% on the amount of 


bonds it issued over the relevant period. Should regulators take a similar approach to Marubeni, 


its fine could amount to ¥5.1bn. 


 Potential credit issues. We believe the forthcoming writedowns will be highly problematic for 


Marubeni from a credit perspective. The company has a debt to LTM EBITDA ratio of 12.8x while 


its debt to LTM Free Cash Flow was at 1,573x and expected to be at 39x in FY16. The situation is 


likely to worsen in FY17. Though Marubeni maintains an investment grade rating with credit 


agencies, it remains the most levered of all Japanese trading companies. The rating agencies 


focus substantially on debt to capitalization ratios and equity to risk weighted assets and we 


believe this has partially motivated Marubeni to delay asset impairments. With high leverage 


and low margins driving the core business of a trader, we believe any potential credit 


downgrade and its associated increase in borrowing costs will drastically hurt profits. The ratings 


agencies are already taking note.
2
  


 “Buffer” against appropriate accounting. We believe Marubeni’s use of a “buffer” is 


inconsistent with IFRS. It strikes us as opaque even by Japanese trading companies’ standard 





2
 S&P Rating Action January 27, 2015
7 | P a g e  





and, as the report notes, is a view that analysts regularly covering the company share. This 


buffer makes it extremely hard to gauge the true quality of Marubeni’s earnings as well as what 


value it ascribes to individual assets. 


  Valuation drop concern.  We believe there is material downside to Marubeni’s share price.  Our 


target price for Marubeni stock is Y390, implying a 40% downside. We apply a 0.5x price / book 


multiple to an adjusted book value of Y780/share (which includes Y175bn of potential 


impairments to Marubeni’s stated book value). As our report shows, Marubeni has been the 


worst investor of its peers on both an absolute Yen basis and as a percentage of book value. 


After Y1.6 trillion in investments and capital expenditures, Marubeni has lower earnings and 


cash flow than it did 5 years ago. This also represents severe underperformance on a relative 


basis as Marubeni is the only sogo shosha that’s seen no meaningful increase in its average 


operating cash flow for the period FY11 to FY15 compared to the average for the period FY00 to 


FY10, despite the massive investments. Added to its top-of-the-group leverage, we believe 


Marubeni should trade at a ~20% discount to peers such as Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Mitsui. 


An additional valuation data point would be other less leveraged global commodity trading 


companies, such as Glencore and Noble trade at 0.35x – 0.40x book and we believe Marubeni 


should — at most — trade at a 20% premium to these companies. This also supports our 0.5x 


P/B target multiple. 





We believe our analysis only scratches the surface of some of Marubeni’s investments which are vast 


and extend to hundreds of joint ventures and subsidiaries. With the mood in Japan turning more 


towards corporate governance and Japan focused on making its equity markets more transparent and 


attractive to foreign capital, we believe Marubeni is the kind of company that will incur increased 


scrutiny. We are cautiously optimistic that this report and other investigations into the company can 


help bring about positive changes in Japan and avoid further crises.

See No Writedown, Hear No Writedown, Speak No Writedown 
 


We believe that through an allergic attitude to booking impairments Marubeni has been presenting 


investors with padded financial statements. In a similar way to Toshiba selling investors debt based on 


misleading financial numbers, Marubeni raised more than ¥353bn over the last four years on the back 


of, we believe, inadequate representations of its economic condition. While Marubeni’s management 


may be believe they have discretion over the size and timing of writedowns there is a strict accounting  


requirement for companies to assess investment values at the end of each reporting period in light of 


indicators of impairment. These indicators are listed in the accounting standards below. From the 


International Accounting Standards Committee: 

















I Know What You Did Last Summer: The Toshiba Case Study 


We believe Toshiba provides an illustrative case study of improper accounting and the issues it creates.  


The engineering company has been mired in scandal throughout 2015 after a report indicated they’d 


massively overstated past earnings due to a failure to recognize losses. The stock has sold off 


significantly and even though the company has since implemented some writedowns and published an 


independent investigation report the share price has yet to recover. Moreover, the Tokyo Stock 


Exchange has threatened to delist the company and has designated it as a “Security on Alert”.
9 | P a g e  








Toshiba’s transgressions have been summed up by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission 


(“SESC”). The commission found that the company delayed the booking of losses, done at the instruction 


of past presidents, and meanwhile raised funds from investors on the back of this inaccurate financial 


information. The result is that Toshiba has had to revise down earnings by a total of ¥225bn over 7 


years. Toshiba was slapped
3
 with a record


4
 fine of ¥7.4bn, based on the amount of bonds it sold during 


this period of misstated results. The SESC found that investors’ interest was particularly harmed by the 


inflation of results for FY2011 and FY2012. For those two years alone Toshiba has since downgraded 


pretax earnings by more than ¥80bn. 


As recently as last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange found another instance
5
 of hidden impairments in 


Toshiba’s accounting. The company had failed to disclose past charges at Westinghouse (one of its 


subsidiaries), which was also a violation of bourse requirements. We believe it’s fair to say that timely 


disclosure of impairments is a topic that’s only growing in attention in Japan today.

Psst, Don’t Tell Marubeni, But Commodities Are Down 





Beginning in the early 2000’s, commodities have been on an incredible bull run due to soaring Chinese 


demand for raw materials. Japanese trading companies made aggressive entries  into this space, with a 


number of large investments into mining and energy assets coming very late in the commodity cycle 


and, hence, at the top of the market. 





Historically, Marubeni grew from a linen trading operation in Osaka in the mid-19th century and came 


fully into its own as an independent company in the late 1940s. The company developed in post-war 


Japan on the back of textiles, machinery, chemicals, and later retail, power generation and food 


materials. Marubeni’s foray into commodities came later than most of its domestic peers. Seeing the 


handsome profits more commodities-focused trading houses such as Mitsui & Co. reaped from basic 


raw materials, Marubeni made a play for several large-scale projects. It bid aggressively and made 


massive investments at the peak of the market in order to catch up. Unfortunately for Marubeni  


commodity prices started to fall in 2011. 





Let’s look at when Marubeni made many of its key commodities investments. The company agreed with 


a partner to take over Canada’s Grand Cache coal mine — one of its biggest investments in coal — in 


fiscal 2011 and was sold for a $1 this year. The same fiscal year (ended March 31, 2012) Marubeni also 


made its first investment in iron ore in 30 years
6
. The following year, Marubeni agreed to pay a company 


record $3.6 billion for the equity of U.S. firm Gavilon, for the purpose of boosting its grain supply
7
. So, 


when did the prices of these commodities peak? Coal and iron ore hit their peak in 2011 and corn in 


2012. Marubeni could not have picked a better time to buy — from the seller’s perspective. 





After the peak years of 2011-2012 commodities have corrected sharply. As of December 2015, a number 


of metals are posting new multi-year lows and commodity producers and trading companies are seeing 


large declines in their share prices. The price of the underlying commodity is one of the key drivers of 


value in any natural resource asset.  As such, we have seen some writedowns from the Japanese trading 


companies including Marubeni in some of their energy assets. However, the same effort has not gone 


into reflecting today’s economics in the base and bulk commodities space.

Iron Ore 


Commodities have come off across the board, but iron ore has been particularly hard hit due to an 


overabundance of supply and weakness in demand.  Iron ore is a metal primarily used in steel for 


structural engineering applications.  Most of the demand in recent years has come from China in order 


to construct  buildings and infrastructure.  While iron ore’s price is just one of the signals of the 


slowdown in China’s GDP, the ore has been in the news given the severity of its demand-supply 


situation. With prices posting multi-year lows almost every week, and with the major producers 


continuing to add low-cost production there is no end in sight. It seems that major iron ore producers 


are even estimating  how much they can mine with robots to cut costs in such an environment. In any 


case, the outlook seems grim: 


- BHP, Rio take to mining robots to counter iron-ore bear market 


o Sydney Morning Herald (September 11, 2015) 


- The relentless bear market in iron ore 


o Business Insider (November 18, 2015) 


Iron ore is a very important commodity to Marubeni as one of its largest acquisitions is the stake in Roy 


Hill iron ore mine in Australia.  Marubeni first invested in Roy Hill in March 2012.  Since the investment, 


iron ore has effectively gone down in a straight line.. Iron ore was trading at  US$147/mt at date of 


transaction announcement and has plummeted to US$39/mt earlier this month, a decline of 73%:
12 | P a g e  








Source:  Bloomberg 


As commodities have traded in cycles, one might guess that another iron ore bull market may be just 


around the corner. Not so, say industry analysts. The consensus forecast for long-term iron ore prices 


has also come off significantly as commodity researchers and economists point to a new paradigm in the 


iron ore industry, which features continuous new supply from major producers and a weakening of 


demand out of China. Thus, some analysts are pegging their long-term iron ore estimates in the US$40’s 


$50’s and $60’s per ton. Just today GS lowered its estimates to $40 a ton for the next 3 years.

- JPM (Sept 4, 2015) 





Or we can look at the SGX Iron Ore futures which are in backwardation, ie a downward sloping curve 


and Dec. 2018 contracts are trading at US$34/mt 


Because mining assets have long mine lives, this long-term price assumption is the most important input 


into any commodity asset valuation as it drives the bulk of the valuation.  As such, mine values are highly 


sensitive to long-term price estimates. Thus, the declining iron ore price and expectation of continued 


declines have manifested themselves in not only poor financial results at iron ore miners, but also hurt  


share prices substantially as the expectation is for price weakness to continue.

The market is sending a very clear message here: the fundamental value of commdity-related 


companies has fallen along with their earnings power.  If the market is telling us this, why isn’t Marubeni 


listening and marking down its resource investments appropriately? 


Writedowns, the Awakening 


As previously discussed, companies conduct an impairment test each year in order to determine the 


appropriate carrying value of various investments on the balance sheet.  Though Marubeni has 


historically conducted this test and written down some of the smaller assets, a number of its largest 


investments remain either completely unimpaired or insufficiently impaired despite deteriorating 


fundamentals and plummeting market values.  This report aims to walk through some of Marubeni’s 


largest investments and explain what makes us believe that the impairments it’s made so far do not 


represent full market realities and should be much greater in scale

10 Years Late to the Party: How Marubeni Got Into Iron Ore via Roy Hill  


Roy Hill is an iron ore project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia that’s currently being developed 


by Hancock Prospecting (“Hancock”).  Hancock is a private mining company owned by Gina Rinehart, the 


daughter of an iron ore magnate.  The asset
8
 is a 55 million ton per year iron ore project with access to 


rail and port so that it can bring the product to market.  The project sits approximately 115km north of 


Newman, and consists of a conventional open pit, bulk mining operation from multiple production 


benches, a wet processing plant, 344km single line, heavy haul railway and a purpose-built dedicated 


two-berth iron ore port facility at Port Hedland.  Roy Hill is said to have a defined mineralization of more 


than 2.3 billion tons of +50% Fe iron ore, of which 1.2 billion tons is +55% Fe, enough to sustain a mine 


life of more than 20 years.  This is a very large project and is a very big investment by Hancock and its 


partners. 


In March 2012, an Asian consortium comprised of Marubeni, POSCO and STX purchased a 25% stake in 


the project for A$3.2bn of equity to meet ongoing project development costs.  In addition, POSCO and 


STX acquired a 5% equity interest in Roy Hill as a result of a conversion of an existing perpetual note that 


had previously been entered into with Hancock Prospecting.  All in all, Marubeni invested A$1.5bn for 


12.5% of Roy Hill.  This implied an equity value of A$12bn for 100% of the project’s equity, a very lofty 


valuation for a development stage asset.  In July 2013, Marubeni subsequently purchased STX’s 2.5% 


stake for an undisclosed amount bringing its total investment to an estimated ¥150bn — ¥170bn.  After 


Marubeni’s equity investment, Roy Hill secured US$7.2bn in project financing, which was provided by a 


number of export credit agencies and commercial banks, according to statements from the two 


companies.  The project received substantial support from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, 


Korea Eximbank, Korea Trade Insurance Corporation, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance and 


Export-Import Bank of the United States.   


The project was scheduled to begin production in Sept 2015
9
, but the first shipment missed 


commissioning targets
10


. It took place three months later, on Dec. 10
11


. 


The consortium also secured off-take contracts in excess of 50% of the output
12


 for the life of the mine.  


These off-take contracts are standard within the industry and are agreements to buy the iron ore of the 


mine at the price of an underlying benchmark price at the time of the purchase.

Examining press releases
13


 for off-take contracts at other projects signed with trading companies such as 


Glencore, Noble, and others, we see that the underlying price for the off-take is generally the 


benchmark 62% Fe iron ore index.  To highlight, these contracts secure a buyer for the iron ore, but they 


do not lock in a price that’s materially different from the underlying benchmark. This is important since 


one of the arguments that companies use to defend themselves against the need to impair an asset is 


the existence of long-term contracts. Marubeni does the same in its Dec. 10, 2015 press release, the 


Japanese language version of which states that “Japanese and other Asian steelmakers are eagerly 


awaiting the high-grade iron ore originating from this asset and more than 90% of the production 


volumes are already tied up in long-term contracts.” However, if a long-term contract locked in buyers 


at prices that did not reflect those today, in other words at prices that didn’t move with the economics 


of the market, that would mean clients locking themselves in for at least 20 years at a single price point. 


Given that iron ore prices are less than a third of where they were three years ago, Marubeni’s clients 


would hardly be “eagerly awaiting” their ore. 


So, we understand that the price of the only commodity that Roy Hill produces has plunged and that the 


project’s off-takes and long-term contracts cannot shield it from that market reality. We know that the 


project has suffered delays, which can only add to costs. We know the Roy Hill investment was made at 


the top of the iron ore market. When it came to the impairment test for earnings in the fiscal year ended 


March 31, 2015, however, Marubeni opted not to impair Roy Hill at all.  


In January 2015, Marubeni issued a presentation revising down its consolidated earnings forecast for the 


year due to the possibility of one-time losses to the sum of Y120bn. These were the reasons given:

The Company took impairments in several businesses citing “the backdrop of falling resource prices”, 


yet it did not impair the asset exposed to iron ore — among the weakest performing commodities in the 


last three years.  This begs the question, why didn’t Marubeni impair one of its most challenged assets? 





Here is the Marubeni explanation: 





Source: Jan 2015 Investor Presentation 


The problem is, neither of the reasons cited above conform to the definition of an impairment test nor 


are they generally satisfactory explanations. Impairments are due to be realized if the carrying amount 


of an asset no longer exceeds its recoverable amount. Moreover, the project did suffer delays and
18 | P a g e  





production did not commence “on schedule” as advertised
14


 in September 2015 and shipped its first 


shipment earlier this month. 


While Roy Hill may be a good asset that’s positioned at a decent part of the cost curve, both the “cost-


competitive edge” argument and the argument of on-schedule development completely ignores some 


key external sources that indicate the need for an impairment, which were highlighted earlier (see p. 5) 


from the IAS 36.12, including declines in market values and negative changes in markets / economies.  


Here we turn again to the charts of iron ore prices and the shares of iron ore mining companies since 


Marubeni made the investment in Roy Hill. These clearly show that there have been very negative 


changes in the iron ore markets and this has been reflected in declining market values of iron ore mining 


companies. 


What’s even stranger is that Marubeni is not in disagreement with the concept of the rule: that a major 


decline in the underlying commodity price should drive an impairment of the fundamental value of a 


resource asset.  Reading through the notes of the company’s most recent annual financial statements, 


one can see that Marubeni took impairments on some of its oil & gas assets and explained this through 


the following: 








Source:  Marubeni 2015 annual report 


In FY15, Marubeni wrote down some oil & gas assets “as a result of downward revisions in estimated 


future cash flows due to the decline in crude oil prices”.  Over FY15, Brent oil declined from US$108/bbl 


to US$55/bbl — a decline of 49%.  Over the same period, iron ore declined from US$117/mt to 


US$51/mt — a 56% drop.  If Marubeni wrote down some of its oil & gas assets due to downward 


revisions in estimated future cash flows sparked by a decline in oil prices, shouldn’t they have written 


down Roy Hill on the same basis? Iron ore fell even more than oil. How could Roy Hill not suffer any 


downward revision in estimated future cash flow?  Marubeni’s logic in writing down some of its oil & gas 


assets appears to be sound. The company does not, however, consistently apply it to other assets

including Roy Hill. Which, coincidentally, happens to be one of its largest investments in the last 5 years. 





One improbable theory would be to say that Roy Hill, at the time of Marubeni’s investment, assumed 


iron ore prices would drop to where they are today (US$39/mt). A note by UBS from the time of the 


investment, however, shows that Marubeni’s iron ore price assumption back then was $110/tonne.    





Source:  UBS report on RH acquisition (April 2, 2012) 


Another improbable theory is that they have to wait until production starts to know what extraction 


costs are and hence where to mark the asset. That also does not hold water. IFRS demands a true and 


fair representation of the assets on a yearly basis. In any event production has now started and thus 


even this fig leaf would no longer be available to the company.  


Thus, iron ore prices dropped below expectations and so did the future cash flow estimates. It seems 


clear Marubeni should have booked some impairment losses at Roy Hill.  The question now is how big 


should the impairment those impairments be and when should they have taken place? 





There are a number of ways that any reasonable market participant would value an asset like Roy Hill.  


All of these methodologies point to the same conclusion:  the carrying value of Roy Hill on Marubeni’s 


balance sheet is beyond excessive.  Not only is the carrying value incredibly high based on today’s 


market conditions, it was also high for the market conditions on March 31, 2015 — the end of 


Marubeni’s last fiscal year and the time of the last major impairment test.  Which suggests that 


Marubeni overlooked the accounting rules that specify what merits as an impairment and presented an 


audited set of financial statements that do not accurately reflect the economic nature of its business. In 


other words, it misled investors.
We ran Roy Hill through various standard asset valuation models and here are our findings:

1. Roy Hill Compared with Fortescue 


Fortescue is the world’s fourth-largest producer of iron ore.  Its assets are also located in the Pilbara, 


where it operates the Chichester and Solomon hubs.  Beyond its iron ore assets, Fortescue also owns 


and operates its own rail and port infrastructure and thus, similar to Roy Hill, is a fully integrated iron 


ore producer.  Roy Hill is in Fortescue’s backyard, with their rail lines overlapping quite significantly, as 


demonstrated by the map below: 





Source:  Pilbara port authority document 


Today, Fortescue produces 165Mt of iron ore per annum.  While  negatively affected by iron ore prices, 


Fortescue has been able to bring its cash costs down materially, with realized C1 (net direct) cash costs 


of US$27/mt in FY15 and guidance towards even lower cash costs of US$18/mt in Q1 FY16 (for a break-


even cost of US$39/mt)
15


.  Based on Fortescue’s forecasts of a delivered cost to China of US$25/mt, it 


appears the per ton economics of Fortescue are similar to those of Roy Hill (at its run-rate production).  


This can be corroborated through research analyst reports, which provide an estimate of costs generally 


ranging between US$20 and US$25/mt for Roy Hill
16


.  We have seen Fortescue and Roy Hill sit next to

each other on analyst forecasts for iron ore cost curves. If they’re able to realize similar pricing for their 


product then one could assume that the unit economics of the projects looks similar.  Marubeni’s 


management further corroborate this by indicating at their Nov. results briefing that projected cash 


costs had fallen to around US$20/t
17


. 








Source:  BaML research report 


As such, given the similarity of exposures and economics, we believe Fortescue represents a very good 


comparable with Roy Hill.  We believe the most appropriate valuation methodology for two assets with 


similar economics and extended mine lives is on an EV / production basis which effectively gauges how 


much the market is paying for each ton of iron ore produced a year.  Fortescue is triple the size of Roy 


Hill in terms of production capability and is currently producing and generating cash flow, and yet the 


market has assigned Fortescue a total value that is lower than what Marubeni tells investors Roy Hill is 


worth:

We should add at this point that this analysis is actually highly favorable to Roy Hill because it assumes 


that Roy Hill is also a fully ramped production facility, when in reality it has yet to get there. And will 


likely be subject to a potentially lengthy ramp-up period, given the size of the asset.  Despite all this, the 


market is valuing Fortescue at a multiple that would imply Roy Hill has no remaining equity value. Zero. 


It’s clear that the market is valuing iron ore assets differently now than when Marubeni first purchased 


Roy Hill.  The enterprise value of Fortescue has effectively been on a straight line downwards over the 


period despite bringing production up from 65Mt to 165Mt and bringing down C1 cash costs from 


US$48/mt to US$27/mt.  Even though Fortescue has maintained its production schedule (in a similar 


way that Marubeni said that Roy Hill is “meeting its construction schedule”) and has halved its costs, the 


market has still taken a view that the fundamental value of this asset has dropped by half. (Incidentally, 


Roy Hill has only said that it would be able to bring down their original cash costs, without specifying by 


how much.)

Since Marubeni has not taken any impairments on its Roy Hill investment so far, we can calculate  that: 


An initial purchase of 12.5% of the equity for A$1.5bn implied a total equity value of A$12bn.  At today’s 


exchange rate, this would imply a total enterprise value of US$16bn for Roy Hill (AUD$12B implied 


equity value plus US$7.2B of debt).  Would any market participant pay US$16B for this asset today when 


they could purchase all of Fortescue for 70% of this amount — and get triple the production to boot?   





The analysis begs the conclusion that Marubeni has intentionally kept the mark on its Roy Hill 


investment elevated.  The DCF / multiples based approach corroborates this thesis. 


Discounted Cash Flow 


Many analysts value mining assets using a discounted cash flow model of a project’s reserve / resource 


base.  This is effectively an analysis that projects all of an asset’s future cash flows and then discounts 


them back to get the value today.  This is done by compiling a number of estimates including commodity 


prices, operating costs and capital expenditure requirements in order to build a forecast of an asset’s 


ability to generate cash flow over the life of its reserve / resource base.  Though Roy Hill is a private 


company, there are sufficient data points in the market in order to build a discounted cash flow model. 


The result gives us a value that is again far below what Marubeni marks it at.   





We used various data points provided by industry analysts to produce what, we believe, is a realistic 


picture of how a reasonable market participant would value the asset.  Here are our assumptions: 


 
DCF Assumptions:      Source

FX      AUD/USD 0.70 Spot, Bloomberg 


Discount Rate    % 10% BHP WACC 9.4%, Rio Tinto 9.2%, FMG WACC approx. 9%  


       adjusting for current debt trading levels 


We believe these assumptions are reasonable with the key drivers being the long-term iron ore price 


(analyst consensus currently sits at $65/mt) (SGX 3 year futures are at $34/mt today) and cash costs 


(we’re effectively taking management guidance that’s corroborated by analysts covering the company). 


Based on these assumptions, a discounted cash flow analysis implies an enterprise value of between 


US$11bn and $13bn, implying an equity value of Y70bn to Y100bn for Marubeni’s stake. That’s a steep 


drop from what Marubeni paid for the equity in the first place.
25 | P a g e  





The next logical question to ask would be: Was this discounted cash flow valuation materially different 


on March 31, 2015 (i.e. during Marubeni’s last impairment test)?  At this point, the iron ore price was 


already $55/mt and long-term analyst expectations were already coming down with estimates generally 


in the range of $70 - $75/mt
18


. The 3 year futures on the SGX at the time were trading at $49/mt.  Cost 


estimates would likely have been slightly higher and the AUD forward curve was then stronger. Beyond 


this, the assumptions would have been largely the same. Thus, we can say that the discounted cash flow 


analysis done at the time of the impairment test would have produced a similar conclusion to the one 


we have today.  


Multiples 


The last approach one could use to value Roy Hill would be to apply an EBITDA multiple to Roy Hill’s 


normalized EBITDA at run-rate production.  This is often a short-cut, a convenient methodology that an 


analyst will use to calculate a back-of-the-envelope valuation for an asset or company.  The multiples 


used for this methodology are, generally, the average Enterprise Value / EBITDA of a company’s peer 


group.  As per the assumptions highlighted above, at 55mt of annual iron ore production and with a 


long-term price assumption of $65, as well as an all-in cash cost of US$28/t (incl. shipping costs), we 


estimate that the asset could generate annual EBITDA of approximately $1.9bn.   


We believe that the EV / EBITDA multiple of iron ore comparables is the appropriate valuation metric 


because it provides a decent indication of where iron ore companies trade at today. Thus an analyst 


could come to an estimate of Roy Hill’s value based on the earnings multiples of its peers / comparable 


companies. Again, we provide the figures for the end of fiscal year at Marubeni (March 31, 2015) and for 


today.

26 | P a g e  





Roy Hill’s closest competitors’ trade at 5-6x EBITDA.  Applying these multiples to what Roy Hill could 


earn on a normalized basis in the future implies a value for Marubeni’s stake in Roy Hill of Y40bn to 


Y60bn.  Similarly, a valuation analysis completed at the time of Marubeni’s last impairment test would 


have resulted in a similar valuation (Y50bn to Y70bn). So, not only do the numbers indicate a need for a 


large impairment today, they show that Marubeni should have been taken the writedown at the end of 


its last fiscal year.  





On top of this, let’s not forget that the peers we chose are highly flattering for Roy Hill as Rio Tinto / BHP 


/ Vale are all highly diversified mining companies, holding some of the top tier assets in the world and 


producing at scale in each one. If Roy Hill was a publicly traded company, it would likely trade  at a lower 


multiple than those comparables and likely closer to Fortescue’s multiples. 


What’s even more amazing about these estimates is that they are all based on the assumption of a 


strong recovery in iron ore prices, as industry analysts estimate. While we don't have a crystal ball on 


future iron ore prices, if they don't recover from the current US$39/mt, no standard valuation 


methodology would be able to show that Roy Hill has any equity value.  





For example, were we to use in our valuation models the SGX Iron Ore Futures pricing – which has iron 


ore trading at $34.13 a metric ton in Dec. 2018 – then the equity value of Roy Hill is easily zero and the 


writedown from this asset alone amounts to Y150bn to Y170bn.
27 | P a g e  














It is painfully obvious that Marubeni should have written down Roy Hill a long time ago and that the 


impairment is simply inevitable. But, don't just take our word for it:

Gavilon: Prepare for a Feast (of Impairments)  


Gavilon is a commodity management firm based in Omaha, Nebraska that was focused on agriculture 


and energy.  Gavilon’s agriculture business consisted of (i) grain and ingredients – the origination, 


storage and distribution of grains, oilseeds, feed and food ingredients and (ii) fertilizers. According to the 


company, grain storage capacity of roughly 9Mt makes it the second-largest grain merchandiser in the 


U.S.
19


  Gavilon was previously owned by hedge fund and private equity investors (Ospraie, General 


Atlantic, Soros Fund Management and a unit of Egypt’s Orascom Construction Industries). 


In a deal first announced in May 2012, Marubeni agreed to pay $3.6bn and take over $2bn of Gavilon’s 


debt to complete its biggest-ever acquisition
20


. This was more than double what the previous owners led 


by Ospraie paid for the asset four years earlier
21


. It was also 8%
22


 higher than the reported price tag just 


three weeks before the deal was announced. At the time, Mitsubishi was also said to be interested in 


acquiring Gavilon
23


. This may have contributed to Marubeni’s raising their bid at the final moment to 


clinch the deal. 





A year later, with the deal waiting for regulatory approval, Marubeni managed to renegotiate the 


purchase to cut out the energy business and drop the equity price tag. The Japanese firm finally 


acquired Gavilon’s agriculture and chemicals assets for US$2.7bn (page 134 of 2014 Marubeni AR) in 


equity value and assumed US$1.1bn in debt (page 135 of 2014 Marubeni AR).  


So, did the deal re-negotiation help Marubeni land a bargain? Marubeni paid a value far in excess of 


book value and booked ¥125bn in goodwill alone
24


.  Goodwill in accounting is an intangible asset that 


arises when a buyer acquires an existing business in excess of the book value of its net assets. And yet, 


at an equity value of US$2.7bn or ¥274 bn, Marubeni actually paid 38x what they eventually earned a 


year forward from the asset on a net income basis. So, for every dollar Marubeni paid, the company got 


2.63 cents in net income. To put that into perspective, had Marubeni put the money into a 30-year U.S. 


Treasury paper, they would have earned a greater return
25


. Clearly, Marubeni overpaid. 


Since the acquisition, Gavilon’s business has performed extremely poorly and is performing well below 


Marubeni’s own expectations:

The business has underperformed for a number of reasons, however, one key rationale that drove the 


purchase of the business was a desire to supply China’s burgeoning import market.  Daisuke Okada, 


head of Marubeni’s food division, was the face of the transaction and consistently quoted by the press 


including this quote explaining the deal rationale: “We believe North America will be the supplier of 


Chinese grain demand, so that is what we are most attracted to in Gavilon.”
27


  He was also quoted as 


saying Gavilon would be positioned to supply China’s demands if shortages arise
28


.   


Nearly a year after the transaction was  announced and before it had closed, Marubeni received 


approval from China on the Gavilon takeover
29


.  As part of the approval, the go-ahead was given on the 


basis that Marubeni and Gavilon continue to operate separate soybean sales units in China so as not to 


limit industry competition
30


.  This also included a ban on Marubeni’s U.S. units from buying soybeans 


from Gavilon in principle, prohibiting the two from exchanging data on soybeans
31


.  So much for deal 


synergies.

Additional press reports in 2014 indicated additional struggles in China for Marubeni such as:  the 


emergence of COFCO
32


, a Chinese state-owned trader intent on building its own trading house,  defaults 


from Chinese buyers caused by weaker underwriting standards, as well as the detainment of employees 


at Marubeni’s Chinese unit Columbia Grain Trading
33


.  All in all, this was how one Japanese trading 


house analyst summarized the Gavilon purchase: “I can’t say this is a really, really bad deal, but it will 


take them some time to get their money back”
32


. 


Despite all of this, Marubeni is said to be looking to increase its investment in Gavilon in an attempt to 


turn around the division’s disappointing performance
34


.  But, does this sound like a business that is 


performing well and that deserves a carrying value in excess of its book value?  We do not believe that it 


does and research analysts covering the stock agree: 





- Daiwa (Jan 2015) 


Marubeni itself recognizes that this business has performed extremely poorly.  The company has begun 


to writedown some of the goodwill initially booked with the purchase. In FY15, it wrote it down by 


¥50bn.  We believe this was insufficient. Gavilon’s earnings have fallen off a cliff — we believe by at 


least 50% (as per analyst estimates below) — and the performance at Gavilon is not improving:  


Gavilon’s performance in the first half of this fiscal year has been flat relative to last year.  There doesn’t 


seem to be light at the end of the tunnel. 


In terms of valuation, what further compounds these company specific issues is the decline in the 


multiples for the broader agriculture trading industry.  Though there aren’t any perfect comparables for 


Gavilon, our research indicates that Archer Daniels Midlands (“ADM”) and Bunge represent the closest 


publicly traded peers.  The valuations of these companies has contracted since Marubeni closed the 


acquisition.

Though it’s unclear exactly  how much the asset should be impaired, as Marubeni’s disclosure on 


Gavilon is poor, we have been able to piece together a picture of how the asset has performed since 


Marubeni took over. The picture is rather bleak.  





As Marubeni closed in on the acquisition, Citi
35


 estimated that Gavilon’s net profit was generally around 


US$300mn with energy accounting for at most 20% of that.  This would imply a net profit of US$240mn 


(in today’s terms, approximately ¥30bn in net profit) versus the most recent annual profit Gavilon 


posted: ¥11.5bn.  We believe earnings since Marubeni purchased the asset have likely declined by at 


least 50%.  Ironically, according to a note by JPMorgan published on May 30, 2012, Marubeni 


management explained the acquisition by describing “the core grain business model as characteristically 


stable, with little volatility in earnings”.  Characterizing the soft commodities business as stable and 


lacking in volatility flies in the face of decades of evidence showing the industry as one defined by its 


cyclicality. The business has exhibited anything but stable earnings. This calls into question the depth of 


knowledge of the space by Marubeni at the time of the acquisition and hence the wisdom of their 


decision at the time.  





So, what would be a fair impairment? Analysts name Marubeni’s estimated investment exposure to

Gavilon as between ¥250bn and ¥275bn (as per Mizuho / Daiwa research reports published in Oct 


2015). The business has seen earnings slide by at least 50% and multiples in the U.S. grain industry have 


contracted.  We believe that an additional impairment of at least ¥75bn to ¥100bn would therefore be 


appropriate. 


Perhaps most telling of all is that Daisuke Okada, who was a managing executive officer, the face of the 


transaction and head of the Marubeni’s Foods division, resigned as a director in April 2014 once it 


became clear what a disaster Gavilon had turned out to be.  Someone whose name and picture was so 


prominently displayed in the company’s annual report in 2013 is nowhere to be found in the 2015 


edition
36

Marubeni Is Top of Its Class: In Terms of Debt  


Marubeni exhibits the highest leverage amongst Japanese trading companies.  At 12.8x debt / LTM 


EBITDA and with a 69% debt / book capitalization, and 75% debt / pro-forma book capitalization the 


company is highly levered.  Had Marubeni taken impairments as we believe it should have, the debt to 


capitalization ratio would be much higher.  Instead, in maintaining inflated  carrying values Marubeni 


has preserved its credit ratios, maintained its investment grade rating (Baa2/BBB) and continued to raise 


low cost debt.

Not booking impairment losses and keeping inflated carrying value on assets is particularly important to 


Japanese trading companies because rating agencies focus on a the sector’s capital adequacy as 


opposed to cash flow adequacy:

Part of the Japanese trading companies’ competitive advantage is their scale and ability to secure cheap 


financing.  It’s clear that they’re incentivized to keep their carrying values inflated in order to preserve 


their credit rating. The continuous cycle of borrowing cheaply, investing inopportunely, writing down 


value and then returning to borrow some more seems to be a hallmark of Marubeni.  





In some ways, trading companies have moved away from their core trading functions towards 


investments because the nature of the original business is volatile and margins are thin. When the 


mistakes on the investment front filter through to Marubeni’s core trading, however, the company 


could face material losses.  After all, Marubeni’s average net income margin over the last 5 years has 


been only 1.5%. 


Given the potential risks, we believe rating agencies need to take a more critical look at the book value 


of Marubeni’s assets, especially because of its track record of bad investments and late impairments. It 


is these book equity values that drive the credit ratios that determine a company’s credit ratings, and in 


the end an investor’s desire to invest / lend. 


The spotlight may be already turning. Standard & Poor’s has put its credit outlook on Marubeni’s debt to 


“Negative” and Moody’s lowered  their outlook from positive to stable.

Marubeni’s Little Helper: Introducing the “Buffer” 


One thing the credit agencies – and financial regulators – may want to scrutinize more closely with 


Marubeni is a curious accounting technique. Embedded in Marubeni’s earnings guidance in FY16 is a 


Y20bn “buffer”. What does this buffer do? Well, it makes sure that in times of trouble Marubeni can 


cover potential shortfalls or losses with the “buffer” and prevent any chance of missing its profit 


guidance. Sounds wonderful! If only every company was doing this…. Except they are not. A publicly 


traded company has an obligation to declare its true financial condition. Clouding the numbers with an 


inexplicable accounting technique shows yet again how Marubeni manages its earnings more than the 


business.  





Below are some examples of analysts trying to explain Marubeni’s management forecasts and the 


impact of the “buffer”: 





- JPMorgan (May 9, 2015) 





- Daiwa (June 1, 2015) 





- Mizuho (May 12, 2015)
Our Valuation Thesis 





Based on the above research, we believe there is material downside to Marubeni’s share price.  Our 


target price for Marubeni is Y390 or a 40% downside from today’s market price.  We apply a 0.5x price / 


book multiple to an adjusted book value of Y780/share (which includes Y175bn of potential impairments 


to the Company’s stated book value). 


We believe the market is missing both the severity of the Marubeni’s accounting issues as well as the 


embedded leverage within the Company.  Amongst the trading companies, Marubeni exhibits the 


highest leverage and some of the most problematic investments yet it trades at a premium to all but 


one of its Japanese trading company peers.  We do not think this makes sense.   





Given the issues Marubeni faces with its history of bad investments and high leverage ratios, we believe 


the Company should trade at a ~20% discount to peers such as Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Mitsui.  The 


company has both on an absolute Yen invested as well as a percentage of book value basis the company 


has been the worst investor of the large trading companies. On an absolute value basis, Marubeni has 


spent over Y1.6 trillion on investments and capital expenditures and to date has less earnings and cash 


flow than it did 5 years ago.

i) 40% stake in Grande Cache Coal, a C$1bn acquisition (on a 100% basis) made in Nov 2011 of 


coal assets in Canada
37





ii) 35% stake in shale assets from Hunt Oil, in a $1.3bn deal (including future drilling costs) 


made in Jan 2012
38





iii) 30% stake in the Niobrara shale from Marathon Oil, in a US$270mn deal made in April 


2011
39





The end result of these investments was the sale of Marubeni’s stake in Grande Cache for US$1 and 


partial writedowns at Eagle Ford and a full writedown of Niobrara
40


.  These were investments made only 


a few years ago.  It isn’t easy to lose this much money in such a short period of time! What this shows 


is a record of extremely poor investments followed by the destruction of shareholder equity.   








Dude, Where’s My Return? 





We believe the Company has also underperformed on a relative basis.  Marubeni’s ability to destroy 


shareholder value is further highlighted when analyzing the failure of its Y1.6 trillion of investments 


from FY11 to FY15 to generate any meaningful increase in operating cash flow (“OCF”), particularly 


when compared to its peers. As per the table below, Marubeni is the only trading company that has 


seen no meaningful increase in its average OCF for the period FY11 to FY15 compared to the average in 


the period from FY00 to FY10, despite all the massive investment it has made. Its peers on the other 


hand have generated average OCF increases of between 59% to 102% from period to period, with two 


of the trading companies spending 13% to 17% less. Marubeni should be trading at a significant discount 


to its peers in light of the value destruction it has conducted.

As such, we believe Marubeni’s should trade at a P/B multiple of ~0.5x adjusted book and hence our 


price target of ¥390.  This target P/B multiple would be a 15% discount to Mitsubishi, the leading 


Japanese commodity trading company.  Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo currently trading at between 


0.6x and 0.66x book (with Mitsubishi trading the lowest at 0.6x). 


Another data point to keep in mind is the discount the market allocates when there are concerns with 


disclosure. Hong Kong-based Noble Group has faced issues with transparency regarding its accounting 


disclosures this year. Last year Glencore faced accusations that it lacks transparency and fails to match 


U.K. accounting rules. Glencore and Noble currently trade at a far larger discount to book (0.35x and 


0.40x book respectively) despite carrying far less leverage than Marubeni does across all leverage 


metrics (versus EBITDA, cash flow and book capitalization).  This is particularly important as both 


Glencore and Noble have seen their share prices drop by 72% and 63% year-to-date due to the market’s 


increasing concerns over their leverage in addition to the issues of transparency. And yet, both 


companies have leverage levels that are materially lower than Marubeni’s.  We believe Marubeni should 


at most trade at a 20% premium to these companies and thus we believe this is supportive of our 0.5x 


P/B target multiple.

In many a corporate suite, the idea of announcing writedowns or losses on investments is seen as a loss 


of face; a personal embarrassment for the executives that is avoided and shunted further down the road 


for the successors to "manage." But, we think it's worth remembering what Toshiba's then President 


Atsutoshi Nishida said at a meeting in December 2008 when he was told by staff of upcoming operating 


losses: "The figure is so embarrassing that we cannot announce it this coming January." 





The moment of pride turned out an outright financial lie, which snowballed with each year. When the 


truth finally hit this year, the snowball had turned into an avalanche. And this is how the current 


president of Toshiba, Hisao Tanaka, described it: "The biggest erosion of our brand image in our 140-


year history."
