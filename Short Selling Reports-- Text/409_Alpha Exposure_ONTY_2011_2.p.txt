Oncothyreon: Analyzing Trial Data and Concluding Likely Success
Jul. 29, 2011 5:39 AM ET50 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Oncothyreon (ONTY) is a controversial stock. There has been a great deal of debate
regarding the likely outcome of the Phase III START trial for the cancer vaccine Stimuvax.
While a number of items are in serious dispute, there is one conclusion on which both the
bulls and bears can agree: the median overall survival for the entire trial population at the
time of the first interim look was approximately 33 months.


Based on this point of agreement, this article will explore the likely outcome of the START
trial by examining the record of past trials in this patient population and the implications of
these trials on START’s null hypothesis, which is that there is no statistical difference in
overall survival between the control and treatment arms of the trial. By so doing, we will
show that the evidence overwhelmingly favors rejecting the null hypothesis and that the
START trial is likely to be successful.


The START trial is randomized 2:1 between the treatment arm and the control arm. It is
designed to determine with 90% power whether or not Stimuvax (the treatment) results in
a 6-month or greater improvement in median overall survival relative to the control arm.
With the aggregate population currently estimated to show a 33-month median overall
survival, a 6-month improvement can be seen if the control population is living 29-months
or less while the treatment population lives 35-months or more. Mathematically, this would
be represented as (1/3) * 29 + (2/3) * 35 = 33. With this in mind, we can examine the
probability that the control population is living at least 29 months.


Before examining any scientific literature, it is important to understand the enrollment
criteria and timing for the START trial so that we can be sure to compare trials on a like
basis. The most important enrollment criteria for the START trial are:


(1) stage IIIa or stage IIIb unresectable NSCLC

https://seekingalpha.com/article/283006-oncothyreon-analyzing-trial-data-and-concluding-likely-success 2/18


(2) stable disease or better after completion of chemoradiation


(3) ECOG score of 0 or 1


(4) no plural effusions


(5) patients can have either concurrent or sequential chemoradiation before trial
enrollment


While there are a myriad of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the five listed above are the
most important for determining comparable trials. A full list of the criteria can be seen
here.


In addition to understanding the enrollment criteria, it is also important to know the timing
for the START trial. Randomization into the START trial occurs between four and twelve
weeks after the conclusion of chemoradiation (i.e. one to three months after
chemoradiation). This means that patients in the START trial will have been getting treated
for NSCLC for roughly four months by the time they are randomized into the trial: about
two months of waiting after about two months of chemoradiation (the total chemoradiation
time will depend on whether it is sequential or concurrent). Because there is a four-month
delay between patients starting chemoradiation and being randomized in the START trial,
we estimate that roughly 25% of all stage IIIa and IIIb patients who begin chemoradiation
would ultimately be ineligible for the START trial.


Now that we understand what needs to be believed for the null hypothesis (29-months of
survival), who gets enrolled in the START trial, and when they are enrolled, we can
examine the eight Phase III and Phase II trials that we believe are most similar to the
START trial and what their implied equivalent lifespan is to the START trial. From most
recent to oldest, these trials are:


1) The Lu Trial: Lu was a phase III trial published in 2010. It enrolled Stage IIIa and Stage
IIIb patients with an ECOG of 0-1. Malignant plural effusions were excluded though
cytologically negative plural effusions were allowed. Median overall survival in the control
arm was 15.6 months and the treatment arm was 14.4 months for about 15 months across
the entire population. Median survival was measured from randomization, which took
place before initial chemoradiation. This was a first-line trial so we need to adjust for the
roughly 25% of patients that would be ineligible for START and dropped prior to START
randomization and the four month delay that would be seen in the randomization date for
START relative to the Lu randomization date. We also need to adjust because the method

https://seekingalpha.com/article/283006-oncothyreon-analyzing-trial-data-and-concluding-likely-success 3/18


of staging may not have required imaging and because of the presence of cytologically
negative plural effusions. In aggregate, we would expect this to equate to an 18 month
overall survival in the START population.


2) The Bastos Trial: Bastos was a Phase II trial published in 2010. It enrolled Stage IIIa
and stage IIIb patients with an ECOG of 0-1. Both malignant pleural and pericardial
effusions were excluded. Median overall survival was 14.8 months. Median survival was
measured from randomization, which took place before initial chemoradiation. This was a
first-line trial so we need to adjust for the roughly 25% of patients that would be ineligible
for START and dropped prior to START randomization and the four month delay that
would be seen in the randomization date for START relative to the Bastos randomization
date. Staging was done with CT or PET scans, so no other adjustments need to be made.
In aggregate, we would expect this to equate to a 15 month overall survival in the START
population.


3) The Movsas Trial: Movsas was a Phase II trial published in 2010. It enrolled Stage IIIa
and stage IIIb patients with an ECOG of 0-1. Both malignant pleural and pericardial
effusions were excluded. Median overall survival in the control was 16.1 months from the
point of randomization. Randomization in this trial took place after chemoradiation and all
patients were staged with advanced imaging (CT, MRI, or bone scan), so no additional
adjustments need to be made. Note that enrollment took place before chemoradation and
that 78% of the patients enrolled were fit to be randomized (i.e. met ECOG score of 0-1
and restaging in week 10 showed no evidence of recurrence or progression). This is
consistent with our prior 75% estimate. In aggregate, we would expect this to equate to a
16 month overall survival in the START population.


4) The Bradley Trial: Bradley was a Phase II trial published in 2010. It enrolled
unresectable NSCLC patients with stage I-IIIb but it stratified the group, so we can
analyze just the IIIa and IIIb population. Patients had a Zubrod PS of 0-1 (like an ECOG 0-
1) and were staged with advanced imaging (CT, MRI, or Bone Scan). Supraclavicular
lymph node metastasis, pleural or pericardial effusions were all excluded so the patients
were a bit healthier than in START. Median overall survival in the Phase IIIa and Phase
IIIb subset was 21.6 months. Median survival was measured from randomization, which
took place before initial chemoradiation. This was a first-line trial so we need to adjust for
the roughly 25% of patients that would be ineligible for START and dropped prior to
START randomization and the four month delay that would be seen in the randomization
date for START relative to the Bradley randomization date. We also need to adjust

https://seekingalpha.com/article/283006-oncothyreon-analyzing-trial-data-and-concluding-likely-success 4/18


because of the stricter exclusion of patients with supraclavicular lymph node metastasis.
In aggregate, we would expect this to equate to a 21 month overall survival in the START
population.


5) The Garrido Trial: Garrido was a Phase II trial published in 2009. It enrolled Stage IIIa
and stage IIIb patients with an ECOG of 0-1. The two separate treatment arms had
median overall survivals of 13.1 and 14.7 months. All plural effusions were excluded and
patients were staged with CT or bone scans. Median survival was measured from
randomization, which took place before initial chemoradiation. This was a first-line trial so
we need to adjust for the roughly 25% of patients that would be ineligible for START and
dropped prior to START randomization and the four month delay that would be seen in the
randomization date for START relative to the Garrido randomization date. In aggregate,
we would expect this to equate to a 14 month overall survival in the START population.


6) The Kelly Trial: Kelly was a phase III trial published in 2008. It enrolled Stage IIIa and
stage IIIb patients with an ECOG of 0-1. Patients were staged with a CT scan and both
pleural and pericardial effusions were excluded. The control arm had a median overall
survival of 35 months and this trial is therefore the most frequently cited trial by bears on
ONTY as to why we might expect the control arm to live in excess of 29 months. We
covered this trial in detail in our original post, which can be found here. In short, the Kelly
trial went through two separate prequalification chemoradiation stages whereas the
START trial is only going through one stage of chemoradiation. As a result, the Kelly trial
eliminated the 57% of the total patient population, whereas we expect START to eliminate
only about 25%. This is backed up because the first round of chemoradiation in the Kelly
trial only eliminated 25% of the participants. Normalizing the Kelly trial to the START trial
results in an expected median overall survival in the comparable population of about 22
months.


7) The Hanna Trial: Hanna was a phase III trial published in 2008. It enrolled Stage IIIa
and stage IIIb patients with an ECOG of 0-1. Patients were staged with a PET or CT scan
and both malignant pleural and pericardial effusions were excluded. There were 203
patients initially enrolled of which 147 were randomized. The 72% randomization factor is
equivalent to the 75% we assume for the START trial. The control arm, which was part of
the 72% that were randomized, had a median overall survival of 23.2 months from the
time of enrollment in the trial. Normalizing for the difference between the enrollment time
in the Hanna trial relative to the enrollment time for the START trial equates to a 20 month
overall survival in the START population.

8) The Nyman Trial: Nyman was a phase II trial published in 2008. It enrolled Stage IIIa
and stage IIIb patients with a PS of 0-1. The method of patient staging and the treatment
of pleural effusions were unclear. Median overall survival in the trial was 17.8 months.
Median survival was measured from randomization, which took place before initial
chemoradiation. This was a first-line trial so we need to adjust for the roughly 25% of
patients that would be ineligible for START and dropped prior to START randomization
and the four month delay that would be seen in the randomization date for START relative
to the Nyman randomization date. We also need to adjust for the unclear treatment of
pleural effusions and the possibility of staging mistakes. In aggregate, we would expect
this to equate to a 20 month overall survival in the START population.


We chose these eight trials as the most representative of the patient population being
treated in the START trial. While some of the trials require extensive adjustments to make
them apples-to-apples, such as Kelly, others are nearly identical, such as Movsas.
Importantly, none of the trials gave us any reason to expect a median survival that even
approaches 29-months.


In contrast to our diligent approach of looking for trials that are comparable to the START
trial, we believe that Oncothyreon’s vocal short seller Martin Shkreli has chosen trials that
are not representative of the START population. In addition to the Kelly trial, he chose the
following three trials:


1) The Franca Trial: Franca was not a trial. It was a review of patient medical charts
focused on resected NSCLC patients whereas the START trial focuses on unresectable
NSCLC. Resected means that a surgeon has gone in and cut out the cancer whereas
unresectable patients cannot be operated on. As a result, reseted patients have always
had and will always have a much higher median overall survival.


2) The Gadgeel Trial: Gadgeel was a phase II trial in 2011. It enrolled Stage IIIa and
stage IIIb patients with a PS of 0-1. Patients were staged with PET or CT scans and
malignant pleural effusions were excluded. It did not have a control arm but it did have a
treatment arm that showed 34-months of overall survival. The treatment arm received
Cisplatin and Alimta (pemetrexed) concurrently during initial chemoradiation. Docetaxel
was given once initial chemoradiation was complete. This is different from START in two
respects: (1) the use of Alimta is not allowed at any time during the START trial (though it
may be used once a patient progresses and is removed from the trial) and (2) the use of
Docetaxel is not allowed at any time during the START trial (though it may be used once a
patient progresses and is removed from the trial). This was a first-line trial so we need to
adjust for the roughly 25% of patients that would be ineligible for START and dropped prior

https://seekingalpha.com/article/283006-oncothyreon-analyzing-trial-data-and-concluding-likely-success 6/18


to START randomization and the four month delay that would be seen in the
randomization date for START relative to the Gadgeel randomization date. We are not
sure how to normalize this to the overall survival in the START population.


3) The Chang Trial: Chang was a phase II trial in 2010. It enrolled Stage IIIa and stage
IIIb patients with a Karnofsky scores of 70-100. Patients were staged with PET or CT
scans and malignant pleural effusions were excluded. It did not have a control arm but it
did have a treatment arm that showed 29.4 months of overall survival. The treatment arm
received concurrent chemoradiation and the radiation therapy used proton beam therapy.
This is different from START in two respects: (1) START patients may have either
concurrent or sequential chemoradiation (concurrent has a roughly 3-month benefit to
overall survival) and (2) START patients do not have proton beam therapy (there are only
3 sites in the US that give this to lung cancer patients). This was a first-line trial so we
need to adjust for the roughly 25% of patients that would be ineligible for START and
dropped prior to START randomization and the four month delay that would be seen in the
randomization date for START relative to the Chang randomization date. In aggregate,
adjusting only for the use of concurrent chemoradiation, we would expect this to equate to
a 28 month overall survival in the START population.


In total, this article has reviewed eleven recent papers. Of the eleven papers, ten
concerned trials and one concerned a chart review in a patient population largely
irrelevant to the START trial. In the ten relevant trials, only two suggested that it was at all
likely for the control group in the START trial to live in excess of 29-months. One of these
two trials, Kelly, had a far different design than START. Normalizing for the design
differences between the trials suggests that the Kelly population would have about 22
months of median overall survival when placed on a like basis with the START population.
That leaves only one trial that showed a median overall survival of greater than 29
months, the Gadgeel trial. Gadgeel was a very small trial (28 patients), had no control
arm, and the treatment arm received multiple treatments that are not available to START
patients. Nonetheless, Gadgeel shows us that it is possible that the control group is living
in excess of 29-months.


The trials that I have reviewed strongly suggest that the control group is living somewhere
on the order of 20-months, which is in-line with the expectations of Merck KGaA when
they designed the START trial. There is still an explanation that the bears will cling to: new
drugs such as Alimta, Tarceva, and Avastin are extending lifespans. There are, however,
problems with this contention:

Comments (50)


(1) Avastin is only approved for use during initial chemoradition and is not approved as a
second-line therapy. Patients are not eligible for START if they used Avastin in their initial
chemoradiation therapy. Avastin showed a roughly 2-month improvement in median
overall survival


(2) Tarceva is a second line therapy that patients are allowed to use only once they are
removed from the START trial due to progression. Tarceva’s improvement in median
overall survival is 3.3 months as a second line therapy, but it would probably be less if
used as a third-line therapy for patients coming out of START


(3) Alimta is approved for use during initial chemoradition, as a maintenance therapy, and
as a second-line therapy. Patients are not eligible for START if they used Alimta in their
initial chemoradiation therapy. Alimta showed a roughly 0.4 month improvement in median
overall survival as a second line therapy


Clearly, it is difficult to imagine any of the above treatments substantially extending the
median overall survival of the control group.


In order to assess Oncothyreon as a stock, let us pose the only important question: Is it
likely that the control group has a median overall survival of more than 29 months? If you
believe that this group is living in excess of 29-months, then you would logically believe
that the trial is likely to fail. In contrast, if you believe that the control group is living less
than 29-months, then you would conclude that the trial will succeed. I submit that the
historic literature from similar trials is overwhelmingly in favor of the control group living
less than 29-months and that the START trial therefore has a 90+% probability of success.

Author’s reply »  I have looked into the Theratope phase 3 study and believe that the median expected survival for
the patient population was approximately 25-months. This is based on the data that was available in 2004 from the
M.D. Anderson Survival Data study from the journal of clinical oncology in August, 1996. This study showed the
following median survivals:


(1) complete response: 44 months median overall survival 
(2) partial response: 26 months median overall survival 
(3) stable disease: 18 months median overall survival


The weighted average of patients in the Theratope trial was 10% complete response, 56% partial response, and 34%
stable disease or minor response. This gives a weighted average expected median overall survival of 25.1 months.
The actual observed median overall survival in the control group was 22.3 months, so reasonably close to what we
would have expected.

Bio Burt
Thanks. Interesting that you think expected survival was 25 months. The phase 2 study of Theratope (Clinical
Breast Cancer, Vol. 3, Suppl. 4, S134-S138, February 2003) showed that survival for Theratope was 19.1
months compared. If the data indicated that expected survival would have been 25 months, why would Merck
have paid for this study to start? Isn't 19 < 25?

Author’s reply »  There was a major change in the patient population being treated between the Phase 2 and
Phase 3 trials for Theratope that would suggest a much higher median overall survival in the Phase 3 trial
than in the Phase 2 trial. Here is a quote from an old Cannacord research report about the difference between
the trials:


"There is a major change in the type of patients being enrolled in the Phase III trial. The Phase I and Phase II
trials enrolled metastatic cancer patients who had not responded to standard treatments and had progressive
disease. This is the standard ethical design but the worst type of patient on which to test a new cancer
therapeutic. The Phase III trial is enrolling patients who had received and responded to first line
chemotherapy for distant metastatic breast cancer. These patients will have either non-progressive disease
(stable 
disease – SD or partial response – PR) or no evidence of disease (complete response – CR), and will be

enrolled at approximately a four to one ratio. The type of patient being enrolled in the Phase III trial is
probably more responsive to an antibody-based treatment than those enrolled in previous trials."


Accordingly, it does not surprise me that you would expect a much higher median overall survival in the phase
3 trial.


29 Jul 2011, 01:06 PM


Bio Burt
Interesting. Thank you for clearing that up.


I think I recall seeing that the phase 2b study of Stimuvax was done in stage 3b and stage 4 NSCLC patients,
but that the phase 3 study is being done in stage 3a and 3b NSCLC patients. I assume that these groups
would also have different expectation of survival?


29 Jul 2011, 01:31 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  You are correct that the patient populations between the phase 3 and phase 2 trials are
different. The phase 2 control group had stage 3b and stage 4 patients in it and the median overall survival
was 13.0 months. In the stratified stage 3b subset of the phase 2 trial, the median overall survival of the
control group was 13.3 months. Both of these median survivals (13.0 and 13.3) are below my expectations of
about 20 months in the control arm of the phase 3 trial.

Author’s reply »  The patient weighted median survival in the theratope trial should have been 25.1 months. I wrote a
long reply about the Anderson study from 1996 that produced this data, but it is now missing. Here are the stats:


10% theratope patients had complete response x 44 months median OS = 4.4 months 
+ 
56% theratope patients had complete response x 26 months median OS = 14.6 months 
+ 
34% theratope patients had stable disease or minor response x 18 months median OS = 6.1 months 
= 
25.1 months expected median overall survival across the control.


The phase 3 actually saw 22.3 months, so this was within reason vs initial estimates.

(1) Merck was in the middle of renegotiating their SPA with the FDA and had requested, prior to the data unblinding,
that a number of patients included in the first interim look be removed from the analysis and replaced. They were
therefore concerned that the FDA would not be receptive to an NDA that included data from these patients.


(2) We don't know the p-value needed to unblind the trial at the first look. This p-value is determined based on the
amount of alpha merck wants to spend. This removes alpha that is otherwise available at the end of the trial. Merck
may have chosen an extraordinarily high bar.


(3) The control was living 26-27 months so the p-value was not statistically significant


(4) Merck may have been unable to estimate the median overall survival in the treatment arm within an acceptable
standard deviation due to a low number of events.


Of course, it is also possible that the control was living 29-35 months and the drug did not show any benefits.

"Because there is a four-month delay between patients starting chemoradiation and being randomized in the START
trial, we estimate that roughly 25% of all stage IIIa and IIIb patients who begin chemoradiation would ultimately be
ineligible for the START trial."


Can you elaborate on this? I don't understand how you get to a 25% ineligibility estimate from a 3 month delay..?


Also, "though it may be used once a patient progresses and is removed from the trial"


Does that mean the patient went from stage 3 to stage 4 cancer? Are they automatically removed from the trial when
they reach stage 4 cancer, and ineligible to get the Stimuvax treatment?


thank you.

Author’s reply »  There is a delay because enrollment occurs after chemoradiation and after a 4-12 week
waiting period post chemoradiation. We believe that the combination of these is about 4 months. In contrast,
most of the trials we reviewed enrolled patients before chemoradiation.


In answer to your question about stage 3 vs 4, it is "yes" - progression is either moving to stage 4 or death.

thanks for your reply. How do you get the 25% estimate? I'm seeing wide ranges for this dropout estimate.
Further how do you estimate that these dropouts live for ~6mo? Did you talk to an oncologist about this?

Also you are estimating 1 mo for chemo.. where are you basing this from and what is your estimate for
sequential chemo radio therapy?

Author’s reply »  Our 25% estimate is supported by the Movsas, Kelly, and Hanna trials as explained above.
In each of these trials patients were enrolled before chemoradiation and then randomized only after
chemoradiation assuming that the randomization criteria (ECOG 0-1 etc) were met. As a result of the
enrollment pre-chemoradation and the randomization post-chemoradiation there was a forced dropout rate of
22-28% in these three trials. Hence our 25% estimate. This was supported by doctor calls, as was our 6-
month estimate.

Author’s reply »  I believe we are estimating 2-months for chemoradiation. We may be too short by a month or two
here, but it is more conservative to be short than long on this estimate.

From an oncologist, when asked about control for start:


Because that's a very different population, including only patients doing well after completing chemo and
radiation, whereas all of the other trials it's bing compared to enrolled people before the chemo/radiation.
Since 30-40% of the patients in the trials show progression or problematic complications before they would
get to be eligible for the START trial, and because these patients are the ones who would typically do poorly,
if you siphon off the patients destined to do poorly and are left with only an enriched population of people
more likely to do well, you get skewed results.


The people who are creating buzz around the median survival in START either don't understand this or are
trying to manipulate people. The financial world is salivating over this kind of misleading misinformation, but I
don't think you can draw any conclusions until the actual trial results are reported.

Have you seen this study?


cancergrace.org/lung/2.../


At the World Conference on Lung Cancer in San Francisco a couple of months ago, Dr. James Rigas from
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center presented the results of a trial that tested maintenance Tarceva vs. placebo after
chemo and radiation for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. This trial enrolled “all comers”, a broad
population that was not selected by smoking status or EGFR mutation or any other factor that might predict a higher
chance of benefit with Tarceva. All patients received chemotherapy (in this case low dose weekly cisplatin and

randomized to receive daily Tarceva at 150 mg daily, and the other half received a placebo.


Both arms did pretty well, with the median OS 26.9 months on the placebo arm, and 23.6 months on the Tarceva arm:

Author’s reply »  Ok - I found a presentation and I think that you've got a patient population that is not
dissimilar to many of the other studies I referenced above. The differences between this and START are: (1)
This study measures survival from before chemoradiation whereas START measures from after
chemoradiation and (2) this trial takes ECOG 2 patients and START does not (though historically ECOG 2
patients have been < 10% of enrollments in similar trials such as Phernambucq, Saitoh and Cagler). Also, Dr
West was incorrect re: all comers as lung function was an inclusion factor: "Adequate pulmonary function
(FEV >= 1.0L or predicted FEV >0.8L)" and so were "Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion" as were
"Peripheral neuropathy >= grade 2" - see: clinicaltrials.gov/ct2... - this is more stringent than START which
does not have a lung function criteria. So if you take the placebo at 26 months and then subtract 3-4 months
for chemoradiation + the mandatory wait period between chemo and START enrollment and you get about
23-24 months equivalent OS in the START population.

you also have to adjust for the 25-30% that live 6 months, so shouldnt it be 27+ post adjusted?


16 Sep 2011, 03:40 PM


ibancap
.25 * 6 + .75x = 27


solving for x = 34 months. then subtract 3-4mo for chemo + wait period = 29 or 30.


16 Sep 2011, 03:58 PM

Using 29 months, this trial would still suggest support for Stimuvax, assuming the current trial has an total OS
of 33 months.

cutting it close dont you think?


Take Gandara trial done 10 years ago. MST was 26 months. Adjusting for 30% living at 6mo, and subtracting
3mo for chemo duration + waiting period results in 31 months MST. Readers should take note that Seth
conveniently left this out.

Author’s reply »  Using words like "conveniently" implies some sort of bad faith or attempt to manipulate on
my part and I think it's unwarranted here. If that tone on your part continues, I will stop this conversation. So,
that being said, some thoughts on your replies:


1) The docs we consulted with were all lung cancer specialists and the studies we referenced all showed
~25% of patients who progressed.


2) It is incorrect to assert that 25% of patients live only 6 months. If you estimate survival using an exponential
survival curve, a MST of 23-24 months from the start of treatment suggests that roughly 14% of patients die
within 6-months and 17% are alive at 5-years. This is very close to the actual statistics for stage 3 lung
cancer.


3) As regards Gandara, you should note that there was no control arm and that the 26-mos median OS you
mention happened only in the treatment arm. I specifically chose control arms to measure the control arm of
this study against. However, if you were to insist on using Gandara, I would point out that 88% of the patients
in Gandara completed consolidation chemo yet according to the study design "In the absence of progressive
disease, consolidation docetaxel was initiated." This suggests that our 25% estimate for the number of
patients who progress is too conservative.


This means that the Gandara math actually looks like the following:


26 = 0.12 * ~6 mos + 0.88 * (MST START + 3)


Solving for MST START = 26 months


Hence, it would appear that the good results seen in Gandara are largely as a result of the absence of people
who progress in the initial chemoradiation and not because the group that receives consolidation chemo
(which only comes with stable disease or better - just like START) is performing really well.

I'm not necessarily implying bad faith (though it is prudent to be very skeptical). We all fall for the trap of
contorting reality to fit our thesis; I am pointing out that readers should be hyper aware of this.


1) I dont believe 3 studies is adequate to conclude 25% drop outs. As mentioned earlier, a doctor with lung
cancer focus and extensive clinical trial experience suggest this is way too optimistic.  
2) You are contradicting yourself here. Earlier in the comments you said "This was supported by doctor calls,
as was our 6-month estimate." Thinking about it conceptually, you'd expect patients who don't respond to
chemo to have a drastically reduced survival outlook than those who do. I worry whether 6 mo is too
optimistic, though I admit I have no idea.

Author’s reply »  I guess that we will agree to disagree on the portion of patients who would not be eligible for
START. To summarize, you can point to one well-informed doctor who estimates 30-40% progress whereas I
had 3 oncologists tell me it was a range of 10-30% and found 5 papers that discuss drops due to progression
(Hanna, Rigas, Gandara, Movsas, and Kelly). In aggregate, these trials enrolled nearly 1,200 patients and the
total randomized was approx 73% after including Rigas which was an outlier at only 64% randomization.


As regards the 6-months part, I think that you are confusing MST and total survival. The people who progress
may have a MST of 6-months but this does not mean they are all dead at 6-months. Also, you need to
differentiate for such a short period between measuring from before CRT and after.

I agree with you that there is much more evidence on the positive side but the beauty of disproving something
is that you only need one solid disconfirming evidence. I am not saying dr. west's opinion is solid evidence but
so far I'm reluctant to dismiss it until I see more evidence. I'd rather side on the cautious side since if I'm
wrong I'd lose nearly all of my money.

Author’s reply »  Do you have any reason to support this contention re: 25%? I clearly referenced 3 papers
showing a range of 22-28% of patients who don't make it from enrollment to randomization when the
intermediate step is chemoradiation. We did 5 doc checks before we abandoned it as useless because
everyone just pulls a number out of thin air. We asked three docs about progression numbers and we got
10%, 20-30%, and 20% as estimates. I think your Dr West is too high at 30-40% but who knows.

Were your doctors lung cancer specialists? 30% is also pretty high.. it skews the numbers quite a lot. Dr West
specializes in lung cancer clinical research


cancergrace.org/facult.../ 
West maintains a strong clinical research focus on lung cancer; he currently serves as the principal
investigator on several clinical trials of chemotherapy and novel agents and has authored numerous peer-
reviewed as well as invited publications. He has been actively involved with the SWOG Lung Cancer
Committee on multiple recent and ongoing protocols, and he leads several investigator-initiated trials at his
own institution.

Seth - perhaps to give some perspective on ibancap's points you can elaborate on the statement you statement you
made in the first article:


"We have spoken to doctors and they believe the four-month time difference should offset the fact that ONTY’s trial
starts with a healthier patient population. An oncologist with experience as principal investigator for lung cancer
clinical trials stated she would expect average survival for patients who reach stable or better disease after first line
CRT to be 20-22 months."
